Kennedy spent their honeymoon in 1953 at Hearst's mansion in Beverly Hills, but it does not mention anything about John F. Kennedy's death place being Beverly Hills, California.\n\nHowever, I found a hint of information related to the triple: \"Coincidentally, dwellings spread across the five-acre compound have a combined 55,000 square feet of living space, which is the size of the White House in Washington, D.C.\"\n\nUnfortunately, this information does not provide any direct connection between John F. Kennedy's death place and Beverly Hills, California.\n\nAfter re-reading the text again, I found another hint: \"The property, which is three blocks from Sunset Boulevard and the Beverly Hills Hotel, was used years later as Kennedy's West Coast presidential election headquarters, according to TopTenRealEstateDeals.com.\"\n\nThis statement implies that the mansion in Beverly Hills was related to John F. Kennedy's presidency, but it does not explicitly state that he died there.\n\nGiven these hints and the lack of explicit information about John F. Kennedy's death place being Beverly Hills, California, I would evaluate the triple as:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"output\": \"no\"\n}\n```\n\nNote: If you could provide more context or clarify what you mean by \"death Place,\" I may be able to give a more accurate answer!"

Later in the document, it mentions Mildred Estelene Biddle's funeral service, but there is no information about her spouse being L. Scott Caldwell or any other name matching him.\n\nHowever, when I look at the entire text again, I see that Lori Smith is a case processor and she also mentions Satsuki Mitchell as the sister of Debbie Allen. And then later in the text, it talks about Ivan L. Fleming's funeral service. However, when looking closely, I realize there is no information linking Scott Anglin with Mildred Estelene Biddle or her husband, but instead, Lori Smith is also a case processor for Caldwell & Cowan Funeral Home.\n\nFinally, after reading the entire text again carefully and considering Satsuki Mitchell being mentioned as Debbie Allen's sister and the context of the names provided, I conclude that it's possible to confirm Scott Anglin having a different spouse. But it was not directly mentioned in the given text."
