        "text": "So much so, that Rob Moody, the famous cricket archivist, once made a compilation of the best Inzamam run-outs, capturing some of his most unfortunate dismissals across formats.\n\nThe only Pakistan batsman to hit over 10,000 runs in ODI cricket, Inzamam enjoyed a stellar career that spanned 375 matches, but one particular dismissal is likely to stand out as one of his most bizarre moments in the format.\n\nClose to a year before he retired from international cricket in 2007, Inzamam was captaining Pakistan on India’s tour to the country, which involved a five-match ODI series. Chasing a target of 305 in 47 overs in the first ODI in Peshawar, Inzamam walked in at six, with Pakistan having slipped from 232-2 to 244-4, and then 265-5.\n\nWith Inzamam having quickly progressed to 16 off 18, Pakistan would have fancied their chances of reaching the steep target, but after somewhat of a brainfade, had to take the long walk back for ‘obstructing the field’.\n\nOff the second ball of the 44th over, Inzamam pushed a delivery down the ground to mid-off and walked out of his crease, possibly eyeing a quick single. Suresh Raina, the then 19-year-old, quickly picked up the ball and threw it back towards the batsman. Inzamam, still out of his crease, nonchalantly blocked the throw with his bat, but was left stupefied when the Indian fielders went up in an appeal.\n\nUmpire Simon Taufel and Asad Rauf had a quick chat, following which Taufel raised his finger. Inzamam, possibly unaware of the finer details of the obscure law, went up to Taufel in protest, talking rather animatedly as the Indian team formed a huddle in the background. After the brief chat, he walked off shaking his head, having been at the centre of a rare dismissal.\n\nWatch the dismissal here:"
