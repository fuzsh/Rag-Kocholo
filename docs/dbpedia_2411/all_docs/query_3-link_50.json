        "text": "Rohit Sharma is the kind of skipper who stands by his players. So when Pakistan legend Inzamam-ul-Haq accused Arshdeep Singh of ball-tampering because he got reverse swing in the 15th over, ‘Hitman’ was not going to hold back.\n\n\"Abhi kya jawab du mein iskey bhai? (What answer will I give?) If you are playing in such warm conditions and the wickets are this dry, the ball will reverse on its own. The ball is reversing for all teams. Not just for us. You know sometimes, thoda dimaag ko kholna bhi zaroori hai. (It's important to use your brain). You have to understand where we are playing. Matches are not taking place in England or Australia. That's all I'll say,\" Rohit said while speaking to reporters at a press conference.\n\n\"If Pakistan bowlers did this, there would have been hue and cry. We know how to reverse it really well. If Arshdeep can reverse it in the 15th, there's been some serious work done on the ball. If Bumrah does it you can understand, his action is like that. When others with a specific action or speed do it, it means the ball has been prepared in a special way,\" Inzamam had earlier said to a Pakistani news channel.\n\nThis is not the first time that Pakistani former cricketers have taken pot shots at India’s success. During the 2023 ODI World Cup, Hasan Raza had claimed that there was a chip in Mohammed Shami’s ball that allowed him to get so many wickets. Inzamam was not the only one to accuse Arshdeep. Former Pakistan captain Saleem Malik too claimed that Arshdeep had tampered with the ball.\n\nRohit’s reply was both witty and also the type to shut down any kind of accusation. He used facts and cricket logic to explain why the reverse swing had been generated. The difference is clear. One side only has accusations that are baseless, the other side can counter it with facts.\n\nIndia and Pakistan have had contrasting fortunes in this T20 World Cup. Pakistan failed to make it to the Super 8s, lost to USA and also failed to chase a target of 120 against India. India have won all games and are in the semis. They take on England and the winner will play South Africa in the final on June 29.\n\nSo what’s wrong with these Pakistani experts? Time and again they make bizarre claims and one wonders; is it because their team is doing so badly and ours is doing well? We shall never know!\n\nInzamam was a great player and is known to be a humble man. In fact, more often than not, one hears nothing but praise of Indian cricketers when he speaks. This just came out of the blue and as Rohit said, he needs to use his brain.\n\nIndia are two games away from a second title. They beat Pakistan by five runs in a thriller in 2007 to become the first champions. In 2014, they made it to the final again but Sri Lanka humbled them by six wickets. In 2016 and 2022 they ended up losing in the semis. In fact, the team they are playing in the semis this time is the same one that crushed them two years back.\n\nIt all began on June 1 with 20 teams. Afghanistan surpassed all expectations and made it to the semis where their dream run was ended by the rampaging South Africans. Now India and England shall fight it out for the remaining spot. We could see a first-time champion and it will end South Africa’s ICC title drought that has lasted 26 years."
