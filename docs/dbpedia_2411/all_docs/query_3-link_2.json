        "text": "When it comes to classic run-outs, massive sixes and bulky strokes, only one name is associated to these cricketing traits and that is of Inzamam-ul-Haq. A man with a dominating presence and cricketing instinct to die for, Inzy as he was fondly known, was one of the best in business. At a time when Inzamam was still finding his feet in international cricket, former great Imran Khan rated him as the best batsmen in the world against a solid pace attack.\n\nWith a magical willow and thumping effect, Inzamam scored at a prolific rate all throughout his career. Be it against the fast bowlers or against a spin attack, Inzamam was gifted with amazing footwork and placement skills. His 329 against the New Zealanders is rated as one of the best Test innings played by a cricketer. However, the sleeping giant got caught in a rough run with his willow, but he did not count himself out and made a massive comeback into international cricket scoring an unbeaten 138 against Bangladesh in Multan, soon after the poor run in the 2003 cricket World cup.\n\nRecognized for his composure, Inzamam was sure to lead his nation some day and so he did. Who can forget the match against England, where Inzy and his Men forfeited the Test after umpire Darrell Hair docked five runs for ball tampering. When Pakistan was eliminated from the 2007 World Cup, followed by the mysterious death of Coach Bob Woolmer, Inzamam announced his retirement from international cricket in 2007. One of the greatest batsmen churned by Pakistan, Inzy fell agonisingly two short of Javed Miandad's record for the highest Test aggregate by a Pakistan batsman."
