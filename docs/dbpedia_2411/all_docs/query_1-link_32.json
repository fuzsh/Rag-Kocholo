        "text": "Jonty Rhodes wasn’t just a cricketer, he was a trailblazer and icon of the game.\n\nRhodes was a solid batsman who averaged in the mid 30s in both Test and ODI cricket, having featured in as many as 245 matches in the latter format, where he was also renowned for his incredible running between the wickets.\n\nHowever, it was his out-of-this-world fielding that truly set him apart. His agility, anticipation, and acrobatic catches redefined what was possible on the cricket field. His iconic run out of Inzamam-ul-Haq in the 1999 World Cup is a highlight reel unto itself, a moment forever etched in cricket history.\n\nRhodes’ impact transcended statistics. He inspired a generation of young fielders, not just in South Africa but around the world, while his dedication to fitness and fielding drills became a blueprint for aspiring athletes.\n\nThis passion has also translated into his life after cricket, with Rhodes having taken on a variety of coaching roles where he brings unique training drills to the fore, particularly in the Indian Premier League.\n\nHis focus on fielding revolutionised training methods, emphasising athleticism and anticipation as much as catching technique.\n\nRhodes has effectively served as an ambassador for the sport, particularly in India where his passion for the game an the country’s culture resonates deeply with fans.\n\nJONTY RHODES WAS A UNIQUE SPORTSMAN\n\nWhen Rhodes eventually retired after the 2003 World Cup, he did so with a legacy that transcended across borders as the impact of world-class fielding suddenly become a high valued commodity.\n\nAfter retiring from cricket Rhodes was employed by Standard Bank as an account executive and was involved with the bank’s cricket sponsorship roles.\n\nHowever, he then transitioned into a variety of coaching roles, which took him from South Africa to India to Kenya and even Sweden at different times.\n\nBefore the start of 2023 season of IPL, Jonty was appointed by Lucknow Super Giants as their fielding coach, and this is a role that he retained into the 2024 tournament that is currently under way.\n\nINDIA IS HIS HOME AWAY FROM HOME\n\nAlthough Rhodes regularly returns to South Africa, him and his family interestingly settled in the picturesque seaside Indian state of Goa a few months ago.\n\n“The entire family has made Goa our home, we have moved into a small house,” he commented during a recent interview. “Goa is treating us too well. This is my home, wherever we are, we would like to contribute. Goa has given us a lot, now we will also want to give back.”\n\nRhodes is an active user of social media on Instagram and X, highlighting an incredibly active lifestyle, his variety of brand partnerships as well as his passion for motorbikes and surfing."
