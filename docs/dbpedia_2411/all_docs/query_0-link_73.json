India Win by 4 Runs\n\nAs India-Pakistan begin their cricket rivalry in India after 5 years, we take a look at the top 5 cliff-hangers that made the contest between the two sides a bite-your-nail action-packed thriller....\n\nIndia and Pakistan played their first ODI on Oct 1, 1978 at Quetta (Pakistan). It was a 40-over match in which India scored 170/7 batting first. Man-of-the-match Mohinder Amarnath's all-round performance (51 & 2/38) helped India beat Pakistan (166/8) by 4 runs. Chetan Chauhan & Kapil Dev made their ODI debuts with this match.\n\n__PAGEBREAK__\n\n2. Pakistan Win by 1 Wicket\n\nDuring the Austral-Asia Cup final at Sharjah on April 18, 1986, riding on Gavaskar's 92, India scored a challenging score of 245/7. Pakistan was in a mess but man-of-the-match Javed Miandad (116* off 114 balls) stood guard â€“ Pakistan needed four runs to win the match off the last ball of Chetan Sharma; Javed Miandad hit a 6 to help Pakistan win by 1 wicket.\n\n__PAGEBREAK__\n\n3. Pakistan Win by 4 Runs\n\nPakistan won the toss and batting first scored 257/7 in their 50 overs during the 6th match of the Wills Trophy on Oct 23, 1991 at Sharjah. None of the Indian players could score even a fifty, and India (253/6) in the end fell short of 4 runs.\n\n__PAGEBREAK__\n\n4. Pakistan Win by 2 Wickets\n\nIn their Day/Night encounter of the 2nd match of the Carlton & United Series on Jan 10, 2000 at Brisbane, batting first Indian top order crumbled in front of Shoaib Akhtar (3/19) and their innings was wrapped up for 195 in 48.5 overs. Indian bowler J Srinath (4/49) tried to keep things in control; however, Pakistan got to the 196 mark with 1 over remaining.\n\n__PAGEBREAK__\n\n5. India Win by 5 Runs"
