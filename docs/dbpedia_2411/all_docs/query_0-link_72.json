        "text": "Karachi, Guess who is coming to Pakistan? It’s the fielding guru Jonty Rhodes, whose image of flying in the air to run-out great Inzamam-ul-Haq in the World Cup 1992 is still etched in the memories of fans around the world.\n\nSo gear up to have a glimpse of Jonty at the National stadium as excitement is rising on the last eight matches of the HBL PSL matches starting from Saturday – including the March 17 final.\n\nRhodes said he was looking forward to matches in Karachi.\n\n“I was in Pakistan in 2015 and 2016, so I am looking forward to going back,” Rhodes told the official website of HBL Pakistan Super League.\n\n“It’s good for us to be able to go and grow the game in Pakistan,” said Rhodes, also part of South Africa teams in 1994, World Cup 1996 and 1997.\n\nRhodes featured in 52 Tests and 245 ODIs for South Africa and has passed his fielding skills and techniques to players around the world.\n\n“What I have seen (in the HBL PSL) certainly will go a long way to ensuring that Pakistan cricket stays at the top and remains very competitive for a long time because these young players have real skills.”\n\nRhodes termed HBL PSL as exciting.\n\n“It’s been interesting because the wickets here (in UAE) have been slow,” said Rhodes. “The pace bowlers are able to dominate and they are young pace bowlers. They have played three editions and this is fourth. I think some of the batting is making some mistakes.\n\n“They are not learning from the players from around them. But standard wise, there are good individual players and they have performed well for Pakistan but on a global scale. Babar Azam is one and he is world number-one in the ICC T20I rankings and you can see why,” said Rhodes."
