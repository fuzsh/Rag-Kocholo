        "text": "RAWALPINDI, March 16: Champion Sachin Tendulkar smashed his 37th One-day International century on Tuesday but his heroics went in vain as Pakistan rode on the genuine pace of Shoaib Akhtar and Muhammad Sami to score a 12-run victory in the second day-night match at the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium.\n\nShoaib playing in his 100th ODI before his home crowd took three wickets with Sami matching that number to restrict the tourists to 317 all out in 48.4 overs as they chased Pakistan's 329 for six wickets.\n\nIndia needed 14 runs from the last 10 balls but Sami dismissed Ashish Nehra to complete victory in what was the first-ever International in Rawalpindi between the two sides.\n\nAs long as Tendulkar who scored 141 was at the crease, India had a chance of making it but after his dismissal in the 39th over with India 245 for four, hopes seemed to fade.\n\nTendulkar crossed the 13000-run mark in his 330th ODI and along with Rahul Dravid stayed together for a fourth wicket partnership that produced 105 runs. Tendulkar flogged the Pakistan attack in a 135-ball innings that featured 17 classy boundaries and a six off Shahid Afridi. He was caught brilliantly by Abdul Razzak in the deep off Shoaib Malik.\n\nAfter Shoaib rocketed in to uproot Virender Sehwag's off stump for 26 in the 9th over it appeared that the local hero might work up the kind of magic he has done in the past. And he did by picking up the wickets of Muhammad Kaif for seven and Zaheer Khan for a duck.\n\nShahid Afridi dismissed skipper Saurav Ganguly cheaply for 15 but Dravid scored a useful 36 in their bid for victory. For Pakistan openers Yasir Hameed and Shahid Afridi, playing his first ODI in almost a year, laid the foundation for a big total score with blazing half centuries.\n\nIn an opening stand that yielded 138 runs, the two put the moderate Indian attack to the sword with Afridi smashing 10 boundaries and four mighty sixes in scoring 80 off just 58 balls. It was his 23rd half century.\n\nHe eventually fell trying to loft a delivery from Yuvraj Singh in the 19th over but seemed to have done his job well. His partner Yasir appeared more patient in comparison though and needed 108 balls 86, his 8th half century. A mix up with captain Inzamamul Haq, who ran all the way to the striker's end saw Yasir yet to start off. Yuvraj had all the time to run him out and he did.\n\nThe reliable Yousuf Youhana, who had cracked 73 in the opening match of the series in Karachi last week, failed on this occasion, managing only 24 runs. The Indian attack, despite its mediocrity, kept achieving breakthroughs at regular intervals with paceman Ashish Nehra on a hat trick in the 40th over.\n\nAfter removing Inzamam off the first ball of the over, Nehra sent back Moin Khan off his next delivery for a duck. Shoaib Malik denied him the hat trick.\n\nWith Pakistan 284 in the 46th over, Younis Khan became Nehra's third victim after scoring a run-a-ball 28. Later Shoaib Malik and Abdul Razzak, who completed his 3000 runs in ODIs, boosted the total.\n\nShoaib Malik remained not out on 30 while Razzak too stayed unconquered on 31. Nehra, was the top Indian bowler with three for 44 off his quota of 10 while Zaheer Khan went wicketless in the seven overs he bowled. Yuvraj who took two of the wickets was the pick of Indian bowlers.\n\nBoth sides made two changes. Pakistan dropped Imran Farhat, bringing in Shahid Afridi while paceman Shabbir Ahmed replaced Rana Naveed-ul-Hasan. India susprisingly played fast bowler Nehra, who only on Monday had been ruled out because of a swollen knee. Uncapped off spinner Ramesh Powar replaced Murali Kartik with Vangipurappu Laxman coming in for Hemang Badani.\n\nScoreboard\n\nPAKISTAN:\n\nYasir Hameed run out 86\n\nShahid Afridi b Yuvraj 80\n\nYousuf Youhana b Yuvraj 24\n\nInzamamul Haq b Nehra 29\n\nYounis Khan c Dravid b Nehra 28\n\nMoin Khan lbw b Nehra 0\n\nShoaib Malik not out 30\n\nAbdul Razzaq not out 31\n\nEXTRAS (LB-6, W-14, NB-1) 21\n\nTOTAL (for six wkts, 50 overs) 329\n\nFALL OF WKTS: 1-138, 2-191, 3-225, 4-249, 5-249, 6-284.\n\nDID NOT BAT: Shoaib Akhtar, Mohammad Sami, Shabbir Ahmed.\n\nBOWLING: Balaji 6-0-47-0 (4w); Zaheer Khan 7-0-72-0 (2w); Nehra 10-0-44-3; Sehwag 5-0-39-0 (1nb); Yuvraj Singh 10-1-41-2 (1w); Powar 6-0-35-0 (5w); Tendulkar 6-0-45-0 (2w).\n\nINDIA:\n\nV.
