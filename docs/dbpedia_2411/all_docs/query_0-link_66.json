        "text": "“One thing to note – and this is something I strongly believe in – is that some of the newer players were picked directly for their first-class performances which will really encourage the players who are doing well at that level.\n\n“What that will prove to aspiring first-class players is that they too can be picked for the national team and also the fact, when given the chance, they are good enough to play international cricket and perform well at that level. All in all, I believe this sort of selection policy will greatly benefit Pakistan cricket.”\n\nThe former skipper also responded to claims that he had shown partiality towards his nephew Imam-ul-Haq.\n\n“When it comes to the selection of any batsman, we take the advice of the head coach, Mickey Arthur, and the batting coaches as well. The batting coaches are aware of what work the player has done during the off-season and is a good indicator of his progress,” Inzamam responded.\n\n“In Imam’s case, we asked for a report from the Pakistan batting coach, Grant Flower, and he praised Imam and recommended that he should be included in the side as he has the potential to become a good international player.\n\n“Based on that, we gave Imam a chance to play in the Test side in Ireland and England. Now I am not saying that Imam’s performances during those games were exceptional or he does not have flaws, but what I see in him is the potential to become a better player, as long as he continues to work hard. Now, it depends on the player to avail the chances he gets.”"
