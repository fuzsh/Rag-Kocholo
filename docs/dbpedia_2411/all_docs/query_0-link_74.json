        "text": "How did Day 2 pan out?\n\nPakistan resumed from their overnight score of 245/1 on Day 2. Azhar Ali and Imam-ul-Haq stretched their score past 300. Australian skipper Pat Cummins dismissed Imam in the 121st over. Pakistan captain Babar Azam played a sturdy knock but departed due to an unfortunate run-out. Azhar was the last Pakistani batter to depart. Mohammad Rizwan and Iftikhar Ahmed remained unbeaten as Pakistan declared.\n\nAzhar Ali slams his 19th Test ton\n\nFormer Pakistan captain Azhar raced to his 19th century in Test cricket. He is only behind Younis Khan (34), Inzamam-ul-Haq (25), Mohammad Yousuf (24), Javed Miandad (23) in terms of Test tons among Pakistani batters. Azhar ended up scoring 185 off 361 balls with the help of 15 fours and 3 sixes. He shared two century stands (with Imam and Babar).\n\nAzhar attains this feat\n\nAzhar now has the sixth-highest score by a Pakistan batter against Australia. He also occupies the fifth spot on the tally (205* at MCG, 2016). Former Pakistan batter Saleem Malik has the highest such score (237 at Pindi, 1994).\n\nImam slammed his maiden Test ton\n\nImam gave Pakistan a salubrious start in the first Test. He batted throughout the first day along with Azhar. The former slammed his maiden ton in Test cricket. Imam smashed 157 off 358 balls (16 fours and 2 sixes). The left-handed batter now has the fourth-highest score by a Pakistani opener in a Test match against Australia.\n\nMohammad Rizwan completes 1,000 runs in Test cricket"
