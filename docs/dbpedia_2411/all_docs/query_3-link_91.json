He had defended the ball back to Harmison and being the prick that he was, threw the ball hard at the stumps even though Inzi was clearly within his crease. This had become part of the \"look at us, we're hard ****s\" aspect of the English bowling attack, and Jones had bonked Hayden on the hip earlier in the year doing this.\n\nAnyway, Inzi reflexively jumped out of the way of the ball while taking evasive action, and the throw hit stumps while he was midair. This was erroneously given out. So understandably Inzi was confused.\n\nThe 2nd incident was against India a few months later. My memory is hazy but I think he was backing up when the throw came in straight at him, and he blocked it with his bat instead of taking evasive action. This was rightly given out."
