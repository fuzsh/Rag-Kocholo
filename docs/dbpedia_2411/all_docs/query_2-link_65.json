        "text": "Inzamam-ul-Haq, one of the modern-day greats, was Pakistan’s best batsman during his career that lasted between 1991 and 2007. As a 21-year-old, Inzamam made crucial contributions towards Pakistan’s 1992 World Cup triumph and went to lead the team in the 2000s as the senior player of the team. He had a successful record as the captain of Pakistan by leading a young team during his tenure. Though Inzamam’s career ended in controversial circumstances, his stature was never spoiled and remains a hero to his nation.\n\nOn the occasion of Inzamam-ul-Haq’s 48th birthday, we look at his achievements in International cricket:\n\n144 – The 144 sixes hit by Inzamam in the ODI cricket are the 2nd most by a Pakistan player. Shahid Afridi hit as many as 351 sixes in the ODI format.\n\n162.16 – Inzamam’s S/R during 37-ball 60 against New Zealand in the 1992 semi-final is the 2nd highest for a Pakistan player in a World Cup innings. Imran Khan had an S/R of 169.69 during his 33-ball 56 against Sri Lanka in the 1983 CWC game.\n\n184 – His innings of 184 against India in 2005 is the highest individual score by any player in career’s 100th Test match.\n\n193 – His 193 sixes are the 2nd most by a Pakistan player in International cricket behind Afridi’s 476 sixes. Inzamam hit 144 sixes in ODIs, 48 in Tests and one in the T20Is.\n\n206 – Runs Inzamam scored in boundaries during his triple century against New Zealand. He hit 38 fours and nine sixes in his innings of 329 in the 2002 Lahore Test. The 206 runs are the 3rd most runs by any player in boundaries in a Test inning.\n\n329 – The 329-run innings by Inzamam against the Kiwis in 2002 is the 2nd highest individual score in Test cricket for Pakistan. Hanif Mohammad scored 337 against West Indies in 1958 Bridgetown Test. His 38 fours in that innings are the joint most for a Pakistan player in a Test inning while the nine sixes are the 2nd most in an innings behind Wasim Akram’s 12 sixes during his double ton.\n\n2076 – Number of boundary fours by Inzamam in International cricket. He hit 1105 fours in Test cricket and 971 fours in ODI cricket. No other Pakistan player hit as many fours as Inzamam.\n\n8830 – He is the 3rd highest run-getter among the Pakistan player in the Test format. He scored 8829 runs for Pakistan and one run in the two innings he played in the Super Test for ICC World XI in 2005.\n\n11739 – Runs scored by Inzamam-ul-Haq in his ODI career. He is the only Pakistan player with 10000 runs in this format. Inzamam is the 6th highest run-getter in this format."
