        "text": "Former Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul-Haq yet again attacked Indian cricket and the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) for having ‘different rules’ for them at the 2024 T20 World Cup.\n\nThe cricket legend criticised the T20 World Cup schedule, saying that Pakistan never received benefits like India getting their semi-final venue being pre-decided.\n\nALSO READ | ‘BELIEVE’: BCCI Secretary Jay Shah’s Message to the Indian Team Who Are One Step Away From Glory\n\n“If you see the two semi-finals, only the India-England game does not have a reserve day. That’s because, India have won all of their games and they will qualify to the final if the game is abandoned,” Inzamam was quoted as saying on Hungama, a show on Pakistan channel 24 News HD.\n\n“There are different rules for each match!”\n\n“When Pakistan were in a strong position in the Asia Cup, we suddenly had a reserve day for just one match,” he said, suggesting that India get a favourable scenario each time.\n\n“India are in so much power right now that not even England can do anything. Cricket is being run by just one force.”\n\n“It is not the Big Three anymore, it’s the Big One,” Inzamam added.\n\nInzamam had earlier hinted at a possible ball tampering by India against the Aussies. Speaking on a Pakistani talk show, he had questioned Arshdeep Singh getting the ball to reverse in the 15th over.\n\n“Arshdeep Singh when he was bowling the 15th over, the ball was reversing. is it too early (for reverse swing) with the new ball? This means the ball was ready for reverse swing by the 12th or the 13th over, Umpires should keep their eyes open (to spot) these things,” said Inzamam during a talk show.\n\nALSO WATCH | ‘Sometimes Dimag Ko Kholna Zaroori Hai’: Rohit’s Unfiltered Response to Inzamam’s Ball-Tampering Allegations\n\nIndia skipper Rohit Sharma has responded to the allegations ahead of the semi-final against England.\n\n“What can I say? Don’t you see the rough surfaces and the heat here? This isn’t Australia or England. Here the conditions will result in the ball reverse swinging in 12-15 overs. It’s happening for all teams and not us alone. Sometimes dimag ko kholna zaroori hai (people need to open their minds and think),” he had said."
