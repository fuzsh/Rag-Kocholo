        "text": "GladiatrsInBlue said:\n\nIt would have been good if there were awards for players that haven't been doing great in Cricket. Like poorest player of the year, poorest test cricketer of the year, undeserving test cap earner of the year and chucker of the year.I have fair ideas as to who would have been the winners in such competition of losers\n\nThere r some other awards who also should've been there.\n\nBest performer against weak teams i.e Bangladesh & Zimbabwe\n\nIrfan Pathan\n\nMost incapable Captain\n\nSaurav Ganguly\n\nPoorest test cricketer of the year\n\nSaurav Ganguly\n\nChucker of the year\n\nHarbhajan Singh\n\nmarc71178 said:\n\nSo which would you say deserve to be in any of the categories - the only one I could think would be Marhsall in the emerging, but I'm not sure if he meets the criteria.\n\nI would have thought Vettori for ODI's\n\nHis last 15 ODI's since the start of the 2004/2005 season against Australia though to the latest oneday series for the world are..\n\n15 245 83 30.62 0 1 21 4/33 26.09\n\nHis bowling economy rate in those 15 matches was an incredible 3.65 per over.\n\nNot to mention 9 of the 15 games were against Australia.\n\nHis stats in the last 12 months are even more impressive .....\n\n20 307 83 34.11 0 1 31 4/33 22.03\n\nI would have thought the above stats are an argument in themselves\n\nzinzan12 said:\n\nI would have thought Vettori for ODI's\n\nHis last 15 ODI's since the start of the 2004/2005 season against Australia though to the latest oneday series for the world are..\n\n15 245 83 30.62 0 1 21 4/33 26.09\n\nHis bowling economy rate in those 15 matches was an incredible 3.65 per over.\n\nNot to mention 9 of the 15 games were against Australia.\n\nHis stats in the last 12 months are even more impressive .....\n\n20 307 83 34.11 0 1 31 4/33 22.03\n\nI would have thought the above stats are an argument in themselves\n\nHe deserved a nomination but wouldn't win..\n\nNZTailender said:\n\nAnd I'll have to say KP but I really hope Aftab Ahmed gets it.\n\nIf Aftab does get it then it will be on the back of THAT shot, and nothing else. But then again, he won't get it.\n\nnick-o said:\n\nNOMINATIONS\n\nPlayer of the Year\n\n# Andrew Flintoff (England)\n\n# Inzamam-ul-Haq (Pakistan)\n\n# Jacques Kallis (South Africa)\n\n# Adam Gilchrist (Australia)\n\n# Glenn McGrath (Australia)\n\nTest player of the year\n\n# Adam Gilchrist (Australia)\n\n# Inzamam-ul-Haq (Pakistan)\n\n# Jacques Kallis (South Africa)\n\n# Glenn McGrath (Australia)\n\n# Shane Warne (Australia)\n\nOne-day player of the year\n\n# Andrew Flintoff (England)\n\n# Adam Gilchrist (Australia)\n\n# Brett Lee (Australia)\n\n# Kevin Pietersen (England)\n\n# Andrew Symonds (Australia)\n\nEmerging player of the year\n\n# Aftab Ahmed (Bangladesh)\n\n# Ian Bell (England)\n\n# Dinesh Karthik (India)\n\n# Kevin Pietersen (England)\n\n# AB de Villiers (South Africa)\n\nPlayer of the Year -Flintoff\n\nTest Player of the Year-Shane Warne\n\nOne Day Player of the Year-Brett Lee\n\nEmerging Player of the Year-KP\n\nWell Pietersen has snatched both the emerging player and ODI player of the year awards. Taufel has the umpire of the year for the 2nd year in a row.\n\nODI team of the year is: Marvan Attapattu (c) Adam Gilchrist, Rahul Dravid, Kevin Pietersen, Inzamam-ul-Haq, Andrew Flintoff, Andrew Symonds, Daniel Vettori, Brett Lee, Naved Rana and Glenn McGrath. Jacques Kallis is the 12th man.\n\nPlayer of the year is yet to be mentioned.\n\nFlintoff and Kallis joint players of the year, and Kallis outright Test player of the year. Fair enough, considering the majority of the Ashes fell outside of the voting period.\n\nODI team of the year as Jono posted, Test team as follows:\n\n1. Virender Sehwag (India)\n\n2. Graeme Smith (South Africa)\n\n3. Ricky Ponting (capt, Australia)\n\n4. Jacques Kallis (South Africa)\n\n5. Brian Lara (West Indies)\n\n6. Inzamam-ul-Haq (Pakistan)\n\n7. Andrew Flintoff (England)\n\n8. Adam Gilchrist (wk, Australia)\n\n9. Shane Warne (Australia)\n\n10. Chaminda Vaas (Sri Lanka)\n\n11. Glenn McGrath (Australia)\n\n12th man: Anil Kumble (India)\n\nCongratulations to England on a near clean-sweep - they clearly dominated the shortlists and rightly so, given their performances over the past two years or so. And England got the Spirit of Cricket award, too - that's going to **** Ponting off no end, which is why I completely agree with the decision.\n\nI was a little disappointed that Warne didn't win the Test player of the year award I thought he deserved it...his performance in the ashes was brilliant but then again most of the ashes series fell out of the time period for this award...which is kind of sad.But if whole of the ashes series was considered I'm sure Shane Warne would've won that award. The rest of it was fair enough...but I didn't get why Simon Taufel won the Umpire of the year award! Well I'll get to see what actually happened on tv tomorrow."
