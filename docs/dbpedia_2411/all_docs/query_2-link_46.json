        "text": "Pakistan made sweeping changes to their playing XI for their must-win match against Bangladesh in the World Cup 2023 on Tuesday in Kolkata as they dropped opener Imam-ul-Haq and all-rounder Mohammad Nawaz. The decision by the team management was taken a day after their chief selector Inzamam-ul-Haq, also Imam's uncle, resigned from the role amid an investigation into alleged conflict of interest in the team selection process.\n\nadvertisement\n\nPakistan retained leg-spinner Usama Mir while Shadab Khan missed out yet again. Shadad, who is also the vice-captain of the team, picked up a concussion injury in Pakistan's defeat to South Africa in Chennai last week. Usama had come in as a concussion substitute in that game.\n\nPAK vs BAN, World Cup 2023 Updates\n\nOn Tuesday, Bangladesh won the toss and opted to bat on a hot afternoon at the Eden Gardens in Kolkata. Shakib Al Hasan's side dropped all-rounder Mahedi Hasan and brought back Towhid Hridoy.\n\nImam, who was in fine form in the lead-up to the World Cup, has struggled to get going, managing just 162 runs in 6 matches with just one fifty=plus score.\n\nFakhar Zaman played Pakistan's opening match against the Netherlands but did not find a place in the team after the game due to illness.\n\nOn the other hand, Mohammad Nawaz struggled to chip with either bat or ball, managing just 81 runs and 2 wickets in 5 matches. Captain Babar did not look impressed with Nawaz as the left-arm spinner offered freebies to tail-ender Keshav Maharaj in their heartbreaking defeat to South Africa in Chennai.\n\nPAK vs BAN, TEAM NEWS\n\nBangladesh (Playing XI) - Litton Das, Tanzid Hasan, Najmul Hossain Shanto, Shakib Al Hasan (C), Mushfiqur Rahim (WK), Mahmudullah, Towhid Hridoy (In for Mahedi Hasan), Mehidy Hasan, Taskin Ahmed, Mustafizur Rahman, Shoriful Islam.\n\nPakistan (Playing XI) - Abdullah Shafique, Fakhar Zaman (In for Imam-ul-Haq), Babar Azam (C), Mohammad Rizwan (WK), Saud Shakeel, Iftikhar Ahmed, Agha Salman (In for Mohammad Nawaz), Shaheen Afridi, Usama Mir (In for Shadab Khan), Mohammad Wasim, Haris Rauf.\n\nWHEN INZAMAM QUIT\n\nPakistan cricket is going through a crisis situation as Babar Azam's men have struggled in World Cup 2023 with 4 successive defeats, a streak that began after they lost to India in Ahmedabad. Chief selector Inzamam resigned from the role even as allegations of conflict of interest came up over the last week. The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) formed a five-member committee to investigate the allegations.\n\nInzamam said he would cooperate with the investigation and that he wanted the PCB to conduct a transparent inquiry. The former Pakistan captain offered to resume the role as chief selector if he is not found guilty.\n\nAs it emerges, Inzamam is a shareholder in \"Yazo International Limited,\" a company owned by cricketers' agent Talha Rehmani.\n\nThis association has raised eyebrows, given that Rehmani represents some of Pakistan's leading cricketers, including Babar Azam, Mohammad Rizwan, and Shaheen Shah Afridi."
