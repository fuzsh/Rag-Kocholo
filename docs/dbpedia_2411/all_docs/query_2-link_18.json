We also understand that any changes, if required, will have to be worked out by our team with our opponents for a suitable date, which will be as per the guidelines issued. If such changes need to take place, we understand that we need to inform Oman Cricket well in advance before the originally scheduled date of the match.\n\n7. We, our team, shall make every effort to play all matches that are scheduled, and should we default, a walk-over shall be awarded to the opponent as laid out in the playing conditions and also we shall be liable not only to forfeit the complete or the remaining balance of the deposit amount but also face the consequences of any other penalty as may be decided by Oman Cricket.\n\n8.

Teams and Players Registration Restrictions (SENIOR DIV)\n\n· We understand that Champions & Runners-Up of the previous season (i.e.) 2023-24, will be promoted to the next higher division as per the proposed grouping sent to all based on Teams rankings for Season 2023-24. However, the final decision for the above will be on Oman Cricket. This shall be applicable for only the ‘A’ division downwards.\n\n· We understand that the final grouping would differ from the already circulated group list due to reasons such as Teams that participated in the season 2023-24 have opted not to participate in the new season 2024-25.\n\n· Premier Division teams will be allowed to register a Maximum of 25 players including a maximum of 5 Visit Visa players for the entire season. Only two Visit Visa players can be nominated to play in the playing eleven at any given point in time.\n\n· We understand that all teams, except Premier Division, would be able to register not more than 20 players, excluding Omani nationals.\n\n· We understand that Oman Cricket shall strive to limit the number of teams in each division to eight teams. However, if the need arises to increase or decrease the number of teams in a specific decision, Oman Cricket shall take necessary action and that will be binding on us.\n\n· It is important to note that if a promoted team does not wish to participate in the higher division they will be allowed to participate in their 2023-24 division by registering a maximum of three players from their registered players for the 2023-24 season.\n\n· If a team of 2023-24 changes their name, they will continue to participate in the same division and if promoted they shall play in the new division, subject to the number of teams of Season 2023-24 withdrawing their participation in 2024-25. Such a team is required to submit a letter from the franchise/team owner on the company letterhead stating they will play with the new name and provide the old name of the team. We understand that this communication can be made only by the Team owner and in case of such a person is not available, then the Team Manager(s) of 2023-24 and 2024-25\n\n· If a promoted team of 2023-24 does not participate in season 2024-25 and if eight or more players from that team register for a new team or in any team of any division of season 2023-24 then that team will be placed in the division where these players had participated in season 2023-24.\n\n· Except in case of being promoted due to ranking in the previous season, teams wanting to play in a higher division than the one that they played in the 2023-24 season, should register a minimum of eight players who have played in the division in which they wish to play in the season 2024-25. (e.g. a team that has played in ‘F’ div in season 2023-24 wishes to ply in ‘C’ Div for the new season then they should register a minimum of 8 players who were registered in ‘C’ Div in season 2023-24). However, the final decision to allow teams) to play in the preferred division shall rest wholly on Oman Cricket.\n\nKindly note any e-mails regarding the above will not be entertained.\n\n· For New teams registering (team name not changed) for Season 2024-25, the grouping will be decided based on the player’s registration. For the sake of clarity: if the new team has 8 or more players who have played in a particular division or higher, they will be placed in the appropriate division in the grouping.\n\n· Withdrawal of Team after Deadline\n\nA new team may, like any other team, have provided their preferred division at the time of team registration and if OC is unable to accommodate the team in their preferred division, the team shall have the option to withdraw their registration within 24 hours from the time OC provides the final grouping, which might be at the Captain’s Manager’s meeting. The request for withdrawal of such a team has to be sent to Oman Cricket from the registered email id of either the Manager or the Captain with the Name, Contact Number of the Manager or the Captain respectively sending the email.\n\nIf a team decides to withdraw from the tournament after the deadline, the team shall be subject to the following:\n\n1. The team will be de-registered from Oman Cricket with automatic de-registration of the players registered for the team for the season 2024-25\n\n2. The team shall be charged a withdrawal fee of RO 100.000\n\nIn the case of (i) above, the de-registered players shall have the option to play for any other team and OC shall be informed with all the player’s registration documents accordingly.
