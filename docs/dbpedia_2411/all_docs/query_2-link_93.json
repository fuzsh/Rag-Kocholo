        "text": "by Vijay Tagore • Last updated on\n\nInzamam-ul-Haq has stepped down from his position as national chief selector © AFP\n\nThe turmoil within the Pakistan team continues to persist, with Inzamam-ul-Haq resigning from his position as the chief selector of the national team. Simultaneously, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has formed a five-member committee to investigate allegations of conflict of interest in the World Cup squad selection process.\n\nThe PCB on Monday said it has set up a panel to inquire following which Inzamam, a Pakistan legend and a former captain, said he would like to step aside pending inquiry.\n\nThe PCB earlier said, \"Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has set up a five-member fact-finding committee to investigate allegations in respect of conflict of interest reported in the media pertaining to the team selection process. The committee will submit its report and any recommendations to the PCB Management in an expeditious manner.\"\n\nThe development comes amid reports that Inzamam (53), who played 120 Tests and 370 ODIs, is associated with a player management firm which manages among others, Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan.\n\n\"We are cricketers and we are available all the time to serve the country. Since I am facing an inquiry, and as the nature of my job is, I should step down and let them conduct the probe. I am a human and it hurts. I have a 20-year cricket career during which I represented Pakistan. I am not someone who people don't know. When such allegations are levelled, it hurts,\" The Dawn website quoted him as telling the television channel.\n\nPakistan has been below par in the ongoing World Cup, having lost four of their six games so far and are virtually out of contention for a semifinal berth leaving an unlikely mathematical possibility. Among the defeats was one against Afghanistan, a relative new entrant to the world of cricket. They play Bangladesh at the Eden on Tuesday.\n\nLater the PCB confirmed Inzamam's resignation through a statement saying it appreciates the former captain's decision. \"The PCB appreciates and acknowledges Inzamam's decision to voluntarily step down during this investigation,\" the Pakistan board statement said and also provided a comment from the outgoing chief selector.\n\n\"I am stepping down from the post to offer the PCB the opportunity to conduct a transparent inquiry about the conflict of interest allegations raised in the media. If the committee finds me not guilty, I will resume my role as the chief selector,\" Inzamam said.\n\nInzamam was appointed as the chairman of the national men's committee on August 7. He was also the chairman of the junior men's selection committee.\n\n© Cricbuzz\n\nShareTweet\n\nTAGS\n\nRELATED STORIES"
