        "text": "Inzamam-ul-Haq makes a disappointing Test farewell\n\nNEAR MISS The burly batsman fell a mere three runs short of overhauling Javed Miandad's Pakistan Test run record on his final international appearance yesterday\n\nAP\n\nInzamam-ul-Haq made a disappointing exit from international cricket yesterday as Pakistan settled for a draw in the second Test against South Africa.\n\nPakistan -- needing a world record 457 runs for victory to level the two-match series -- ended up at 316-4 on the final day.\n\nMohammad Yousuf (63) and captain Shoaib Malik (20) were the unbeaten batsmen at the crease as Pakistan gave up its run-chase after lunch.\n\nA century by Younus Khan (130) on the last day hinted at a chase, but ultimately South Africa won the series 1-0 after recording a 160-run victory in the first Test at Karachi last week.\n\nIt was South Africa's first away Test series victory against a major subcontinent opponent since beating India in 2000.\n\n\"We controlled nine out of 10 days of Test cricket and kept them under pressure,\" South African captain Graeme Smith said.\n\n\"It's been a great team effort with couple of good individual performances too,\" her said.\n\nInzamam's last innings in Test cricket lasted only two deliveries.\n\nHe flicked his first delivery for three runs. In the next over, he attempted a big shot off left-arm spinner Paul Harris but misjudged the line of the ball and was stumped.\n\n\"I thought first Test was the pressure game, but now I believe the last one was the more pressure one,\" Inzamam said.\n\n\"Sometimes it does happen, but I am leaving after spending 16 golden years in international cricket,\" he said.\n\nInzamam, who played 120 Test matches, fell three runs short of breaking Javed Miandad's Pakistan Test record of 8,832 runs.\n\nAs the 37-year-old Inzamam walked back to the dressing room he waved his bat for the last time to around 5,000 spectators.\n\nAll the South African players applauded while the Pakistan players lined up on the boundary to give a last send off to their former captain, who ended his career with 8,830 runs and 25 centuries.\n\nEarlier, Khan thwarted South Africa's attempt of making a clean sweep in the series.\n\n\"We thought of going at the target, but when we lost [Younus] Khan and Inzamam in quick time, we aborted our plans,\" Malik said.\n\n\"It's a great sign for us that we lost only four wickets in four sessions and we can only improve more from here on,\" he said.\n\nResuming at the overnight 108-1, Khan and Kamran Akmal (71) extended their partnership to 161 after Hashim Amla dropped an easy chance when Khan was on 83.\n\nKhan capitalized on the chance and completed his 14th Test hundred off 180 balls that included 14 boundaries.\n\nHe gave Pakistan a glimmer of hope when he started the run-chase aggressively. He hit paceman Makhaya Ntini for three successive boundaries in the third over of the day and then drove Kallis for two more fours in the next over.\n\nThe introduction of Harris in the 10th over of the morning slowed the scoring rate and also earned South Africa a much-needed breakthrough when Akmal dragged one back onto his stumps.\n\nKhan and Yousuf gave up the chase in the second session and added 89 runs in nearly two and a half hours before Khan's innings ended when he edged Kallis behind the wicket."
