        "text": "Hyderabad: Many former players of the Pakistan cricket team have been in the news and some for wrong reasons, who were seen wenting out their frustration on India and its players or on their team for the poor performance in the T20 World Cup.\n\nEarlier, former wicket keeper Kamran Akmal was in the news for his distasteful comments on Arshadeep Singh and the Sikh community, for which he later apologised.\n\nJoining the club is Pakistan's former captain and one of the finest batters in the history of the game, Inzamam-Ul-Haq. In a TV talk show, Inzi alleged that team India had tampered with the ball and pointed out that Arshadeep Singh was able to reverse swing the ball as early as 15 over. He said, \"Arshadeep was able to reverse swing the ball by 15 over itself, it means that the ball was ready by 12 over, for the ball to be ready that early, they (team India) must have done something serious.\" \"If Pakistan had done something like this, then a lot of voices would have been raised,\" he added.\n\nHe also opined that the umpires should be more vigilant. Agreeing with his opinion, his former team-mate Salim Malik also said on the show that \"Eyes remain shut when it comes to certain teams.\"\n\nThe allegations by the former Pakistani players have set the internet on fire.\n\nMeanwhile, team India will face England on June 27 in the Semi-final clash at the Providence Stadium in Guyana."
