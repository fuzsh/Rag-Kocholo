        "text": "Former Test captain Inzamam-ul-Haq is poised to return as Pakistan's team chief selector, raising speculation about the composition of the national selection committee. A source within the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) confirmed to PTI news agency that Inzamam has given his consent to resume the role of chief selector, a position he held from 2016 to 2019.\n\nThe PCB's Cricket Technical Committee, consisting of members like Misbah ul Haq, Inzamam, and Muhammad Hafeez, has been deliberating over the composition of the new selection committee. The fate of director Mickey Arthur and head coach Grant Bradburn, who are currently part of the selection panel, will be decided next week. Their continued presence in the committee is subject to evaluation by the committee members.\n\n“The Cricket Technical Committee members including Misbah ul Haq, Inzamam and Muhammad Hafeez have been discussing the new selection committee and it is yet to be decided whether Arthur and Bradburn should remain members on it,” the PCB source told PTI.\n\nThe key figure in the decision-making process is captain Babar Azam, as his opinion on whether the inclusion of the team director and head coach in the selection panel has benefited the team will play a crucial role. Once Babar's views are taken into account, Misbah will present his recommendation to PCB chairman Zaka Ashraf. The Cricket Technical Committee will also finalize its recommendation for the chairman based on these inputs.\n\n“Once Babar’s views are taken, the Cricket Technical Committee will also finalize its recommendation for the Chairman,” the PCB source added.\n\nThe crux of the decision lies in whether only Inzamam will take over as the new chief selector or if the entire selection committee will undergo a revamp. Previously, during Najam Sethi's tenure as the head of the Cricket Management Committee (CMC), a new-look selection committee was introduced, which included Arthur, Bradburn, and secretary Hasan Cheema, responsible for data analysts for the Pakistan team. Notably, no other former Pakistani player was named on the committee, and it was headed by Haroon Rasheed from the old CMC.\n\nNext week's decision is crucial, as removing Arthur and Bradburn from the selection process could potentially create discontent, as they had taken up coaching positions with the assurance of having a say in selection matters. While Arthur has yet to physically join the team due to his commitments with Derbyshire, he is expected to take charge during the latter part of the Asia Cup and will be available for the World Cup in India and the subsequent tour to Australia later in the year. Inzamam has previously worked with Arthur during his tenure, which included the team's successful 2017 Champions Trophy campaign and the 2019 World Cup."
