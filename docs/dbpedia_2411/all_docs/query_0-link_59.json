        "text": "Knees bent and arms stretched, Rhodes flying mid air was one of cricket's awesome sights. Played 245 one-dayers, scored 5,935 runs and once took five catches in an innings in 1993. A multi-talented sportsman, like the modern day AB de Villiers, Rhodes turned down selection in the national hockey team for the 1996 Olympics. Retired in 2003.\n\nDropped along with Makhaya Ntini for the England one-day series, Gibbs has struggled with consistency in recent years but can still be explosive on his day. Has scored over 8,000 ODI runs, including a magnificent 175 runs from 111 balls to form part of the greatest 50-over game against Australia three years ago. Like Rhodes, regarded as one of the most prolific fielders in South Africa's history.\n\nPlayed 171 one-dayers for South Africa, scoring 3,576 runs. Big-hitting 'Zulu' was also an adaptable fast bowler and finished with 192 wickets before his international retirement in 2004. Perhaps best remembered for coming to the wicket with South Africa needing 39 runs off 31 balls in the 1999 World Cup semi-final against Australia. He proceeded to club 23 off 12 deliveries to leave South Africa requiring nine off the last over but was left stranded after an infamous mix-up with Allan Donald.\n\n'White Lightning' led South Africa's pace attack for over a decade after re-admission to international cricket in 1991. He went on to become the first South African and the 15th bowler in Test history to reach the landmark of 300 wickets, including 80 alone in 1998. Ended his career with 272 wickets from 164 ODIs.\n\nFormed formidable attack with the pace and bounce of Allan Donald and the pairing was the catalyst for much of their country's success in the late 1990s until Donald's retirement in 2002. After Hansie Cronje admitted to match-fixing claims in 2000, Pollock was thrust into the captaincy and lifted the nation by leading South Africa to a series victory over reigning world champions Australia. Although he memorably failed to guide South Africa to the Super Sixes stage at 2003 World Cup after a Duckworth Lewis mix-up, he continued to provide sterling service for his country until retirement in 2007.\n\n: Pollock consistency"
