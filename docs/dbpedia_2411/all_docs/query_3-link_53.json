In a surprising turn of events, Inzamam threatened to quit his role as chief selector not once, but twice, in just one month. Let's delve into the reasons behind these shockwaves in Pakistani cricket.\n\nInzamam's first resignation threat came as a bolt from the blue. It was reported that he was deeply frustrated with the interference of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) in his selection decisions. According to sources close to Inzamam, the PCB had been pressuring him to include certain players in the squad for the upcoming series against a major cricketing nation.\n\nInzamam, known for his strong-willed character both as a player and as a selector, was apparently unwilling to compromise on his principles. He believed that selections should be made solely based on merit and performance, rather than external influences. In his first threat to resign, he made it clear that he would not be part of a system that undermined the integrity of his position.\n\nIn response to Inzamam's initial resignation threat, the PCB held discussions with him to resolve the issues. They assured him of their support and reiterated their commitment to an impartial selection process. After these discussions, Inzamam withdrew his resignation and agreed to continue in his role as chief selector.\n\nHowever, just when it seemed that the storm had passed, Inzamam stunned the cricketing world once again with his second resignation threat, which occurred barely a month after the first incident. This time, the trigger seemed to be the criticism he faced from former cricketers and the media regarding his selections for the national team.\n\nInzamam's tenure as chief selector had been marred by controversies and debates over player choices. Critics argued that he was favoring certain players, showing bias towards certain regions, and not giving opportunities to deserving talent. Frustrated by the ongoing scrutiny and criticism, Inzamam publicly threatened to resign, stating that he couldn't work in an environment where his decisions were constantly questioned.\n\nThe ongoing drama surrounding Inzamam-ul-Haq's position as chief selector raises several questions about the state of Pakistani cricket. The need for transparency in the selection process, free from political and regional pressures, is apparent. The PCB must ensure that the chief selector has the autonomy to make decisions that are in the best interest of Pakistani cricket.\n\nInzamam-ul-Haq's threats to quit his role have exposed the challenges and complexities of managing cricket in Pakistan. As a cricketing icon, his decisions hold immense weight, and his resignation would undoubtedly leave a void. However, it also highlights the urgent need for reform in the administration of cricket in Pakistan to avoid such situations in the future.\n\nIn conclusion, the dual resignation threats from Inzamam-ul-Haq as chief selector have sent shockwaves through Pakistani cricket. It's a reminder of the high stakes, politics, and passionate following that cricket enjoys in the country. The PCB now faces the crucial task of addressing these concerns to ensure that the sport continues to thrive in Pakistan without being marred by controversy."
