        "text": "Synopsis\n\nHarbhajan Singh criticized Inzamam-ul-Haq for saying that the Indian cricketer desired to embrace an Islamic preacher's teachings. Harbhajan, expressing his frustration on X, slammed Inzamam for spreading false information, emphasizing his pride in being Indian and Sikh. Inzamam claimed in a viral video that Harbhajan was impressed by Maulana Tariq Jameel's teachings.\n\nHarbhajan Singh has lashed out at ex-Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul-Haq for claiming that the former Indian cricketer wanted to follow an Islamic preacher's teachings. Harbhajan took to X and vented out his anger by reposting a video in which Inzamam was talking about how the star spinner would accompany other Indian players to listen to the teaching given by Pakistan's Islamic preacher Tariq Jameel and was highly impressed by it.\n\n\"Yeh kon sa nasha pee kar baat kar raha hai ? I am a proud Indian and proud Sikh..yeh Bakwaas log kuch bi bakte hai,\" Harbhajan, a Rajya Sabha MP from the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), wrote on X.\n\nInzamam said in the viral video said: \"Maulana Tariq Jameel would talk to us during our playing days and preach Islam after evening prayers. We used to invite Irfan Pathan, Mohammad Kaif and Zaheer Khan to come and offer Namaz with us and some other Indian cricketers would come to listen to the Maulana.\"\n\nIn the video, Inzamam narrated the conversation he had with Harbhajan and how the Indian cricketer expressed his desire to follow Jameel. Inzaman said that Harbhajan told him that \"my heart says I will follow the person's (Maulana Tariq Jameel) words.\"\n\nInzamam-ul-Haq had last month resigned as chief selector midway through the ODI World Cup after PCB initiated a conflict of interest investigation against the former Pakistan captain. Reports alleged that Inzamam is a shareholder in \"Yazo International Limited\" a company owned by Talha Rehmani, who serves as an agent for prominent Pakistan cricket players.\n\nHe was appointed as the chief selector in August ahead of the World Cup. \"PCB has set up a five-member fact-finding committee to investigate allegations in respect of conflict of interest reported in the media pertaining to the team selection process. The committee will submit its report and any recommendations to the PCB Management in an expeditious manner,\" PCB posted a media statement on X, formerly Twitter.\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News on\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News on\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\nWhy Akasa’s losses are mounting when IndiGo is posting record profits\n\n10 stocks that can defy the yen upheaval, as Sensex comes out of Dow shadow\n\n3 key things Nirmala Sitharaman can do to restore Buddha’s legacy, draw global tourists\n\nAnalysing Hindenburg’s three key allegations against Sebi’s Madhabi Buch\n\nThree reasons why Tata Motors has taken a contrarian view on hybrids\n\nFor multiplex operators like PVR Inox, Cinepolis, is it interval or curtains?\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3"
