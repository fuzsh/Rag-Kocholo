        "text": "Here are the 5 best innings of Inzamam-ul-Haq. He is one of the greatest batsmen ever, with over 20,000 runs in international cricket. As the former captain of Pakistan, he was known for his relaxed style and smooth strokes, which helped his team win many matches. Though he sometimes faced criticism for his physique and running between the wickets, his presence was always a challenge for opposing bowlers.\n\nLet’s check out his top five innings:\n\n5. 122 vs India\n\nIn the first match of the historic ODI series in 2004 in Pakistan, India scored a huge total of 349 runs due to some poor bowling by Pakistan and excellent batting by India. At that time, reaching such a high target was almost impossible, so Pakistan needed a miracle. However, Pakistan’s chances were hurt early when their aggressive openers, Hameed and Farhat, got out. Inzamam then played a remarkable innings, partnering with Yousuf and Younis to get Pakistan close to the target. Despite their effort, Pakistan fell short by 5 runs. Inzamam scored a brilliant 122 runs off 104 balls.\n\nALSO READ: Top 10 Best Left Handed Bowlers in Cricket History\n\n4. 92* vs South Africa\n\nIn the second Test of the 2007 series in South Africa, Pakistan was behind 0-1. In the first innings, Pakistani bowlers did an excellent job and got the South African team out for just 124 runs. Pakistan then had to bat, and some small contributions from Akmal and Younis put them in the lead. After they got out, Inzamam, batting at number 7, scored a key 92 runs with the lower-order batsmen around him. This gave Pakistan a significant lead of 141 runs, which was crucial for the game. Pakistan eventually won by 5 wickets. Inzamam, the captain, was named Man of the Match for his important innings and good leadership.\n\n3. 60 vs New Zealand\n\nIn the 1992 World Cup semi-finals, when Inzamam came in to bat, Pakistan was 124 runs away from the target set by New Zealand, with only about 15 overs left. The conditions in Auckland favored New Zealand, so they were expected to win. However, Inzamam played a fantastic innings, scoring 60 runs off just 37 balls, and led Pakistan to victory. This performance made Inzamam famous internationally. Pakistan went on to win the World Cup by defeating England in the final.\n\nALSO READ: Top 10 Best Defenders Ever\n\n2. 329 vs New Zealand\n\nInzamam scored his highest ever Test score with a brilliant 329 against New Zealand in Lahore. His amazing batting left the New Zealand bowlers unable to stop him. Thanks to his triple century, Pakistan set a huge total of 643 runs and won the Test by an innings and 324 runs.\n\n1. 148 vs England\n\nInzamam scored 148 runs against England at Lord’s in the first innings of the first Test in 1996. While wickets were falling at the other end, he stayed solid and scored a tough century in difficult conditions. His innings helped Pakistan reach 340 runs, which was crucial for their victory in the Test. He also scored 70 runs in the second innings.\n\nREAD MORE:"
