        "text": "Former captain and legendary batter Inzamam-ul-Haq has lambasted the Pakistan team after their early exit from the T20 World Cup 2024. Paksitan’s only wins of the tournament came against Canada and Ireland after suffering defeats against the USA and India. The loss to USA in particular hurt them big time as the tournament debutants progressed to the Super 8s.\n\nT20 World Cup 2024: News | Schedule | Results | Points Table\n\nThe biggest problem for Pakistan had been their poor batting. Apart from skipper Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan, the lack of runs from other batters impacted Pakistan’s chances.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInzamam in his assessment blamed the selection for the batting tragedy, saying that the team was stuffed with openers while they failed to find middle-orders batters which was “shameful”.\n\n“Jis tarah ki selection hui hai, aisi selection nahi karni hai. Pehle se lekar paanchwi tak sab openers hi khel rahe hai. Koi middle-order hi nahi hai Pakistan me. Badi sharamindagi hoti hai ki poore Pakistan me koi middle order batsmen hi nahi hai, jisko hum select kar sake. (This is certainly not the way a team should be selected. From No. 1 to No. 5, all are openers. It is shameful that we cannot find middle-order batters in Pakistan),” Inzamam said.\n\nRead: What caused Pakistan’s unceremonious exit from the T20 World Cup\n\nThe former Pakistan selector also added that the team has been a disjointed unit for a while with multiple reports of factions within the team.\n\n“This struggle is not limited to the T20 World Cup. They struggled in a similar manner in the Asia Cup as well. Asia Cup is done. ODI World Cup is done. Even in the 2-3 series after that Pakistan was never on top, never united. Individual performances was all you could see, sometimes from Babar, from Rizwan and from Shaheen. You didn’t see them perform as a unit,” Inzamam added."
