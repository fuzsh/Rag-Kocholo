Inzy isn't. So Rohit wins that easily.\n\nAs just a pure batsman, irrespective of the format, in either of their eras, if the question were asked:\n\nWho is the best batsman in the world?\n\nThere was a phase when Inzy's name would pop into the Sachin, Lara, Ponting list.\n\nRohit's never has, unless the questioner pointedly asked about white-ball cricket.\n\nI enjoyed watching Inzy and love Rohit.

I don’t think we can attribute that simply to inflated stats or better bowlers. In fact he’s probably the most prolific in his era after Kohli himself. In last few years you could even make the case he has been the best overall. I don’t think at any point Inzi has achieved that.\n\nAs for tests tbh the stats haven’t changed much. There’s still hardly anyone averaging around 50.\n\nThere is a case maybe in terms of tests outweighing. But I honestly think there is a huge difference in LOI between them.\n\nTera Gawaandi\n\nFirst Class Player\n\nJoined\n\nMar 28, 2011\n\nRuns\n\n2,754\n\nIt's unfair to compare Inzi to ODI ATG Rohit.\n\nLet's do a fair comparison with his contemporary Rahul Dravid.\n\nODIs -\n\nInzi and Dravid have exact same ODI stat, both played around 350 matches, both average 39 at SR around 72\n\n10 Centuries for Inzi and 12 for Dravid\n\nBoth scored 83 50s.\n\nOut of Inzi's 10 100s, 4 against India, 4 against SL, 1 against Zimbabwe, 1 New Zealand.\n\nOut of Dravid's 12 100s, 2 against Pakistan, 3 against SL, 3 against WI, 2 New Zealand, 1 UAE, 1 Kenya.\n\nInzi averages 26 in Australia, 34 in Eng, 24 in NZ, 27 in SA\n\nDravid averages 33 in Australia, 46 in Eng, 38 in NZ, 45 in SA\n\nInzi averages 57 at Home, Dravid 43 at home.\n\nBoth averages highest on Pakistan pitches, 57 for Inzi, 50 for Dravid\n\nInzi averages 23 in 35 WC matches and his highest score is 81. Dravid averages 62 in 22 matches and he has 2 100s in WC. Again both have same strike rate of 75 in WCs.\n\nSame story in ICC Championship Trophy, Inzi averages 21 with not a single 50, Dravid averages 49 with 6 50s.\n\nTests -\n\nInzi played 120 matches, Dravid 164.\n\nBoth scored a 100 every 8 innings, Inzi 25 in 200 innings and Dravid 36 in 286 innings.\n\nBoth average similar Inzi 50 and Dravid 52\n\nInzi averages 30 in Aus, 42 in Eng, 31 in SA, 60 in NZ\n\nDravid avg 41 in Aus, 68 in Eng, 30 in SA, 64 in NZ\n\nInzi avg 53 home, 45 away\n\nDrvaid avg 51 home, 53 away\n\nInzi has clearly underachieved for someone who is touted as most talented Pakistani batsman ever. With ODI stat's like these, Inzi's place would not be secure in Indian ODI team. He would not face Prasad, Kuruvila, Ishant, BalaJii instead would be against Waqar, Aqib, Wasim, Akhtar, Mushtaq, Saqlain.\n\nPakpak\n\nODI Debutant\n\nJoined\n\nJan 31, 2009\n\nRuns\n\n8,851\n\nHaving said that in ODIs Inzamam > Babar for sure. He can be more destructive than Babar.\n\nInzi was garbage in any crunch games unless it was not a WC and unless not against India. I'd take Babar over him in crunch games anyday. Against India though in bilaterals Inzi was a beast. Although where Babar hasnt had any biltaerals against India even if he did unlike Inzi he'd face a top bowling attack versus the pop tarts Inzi faced vs India.\n\nravisurya\n\nTape Ball Regular\n\nJoined\n\nMar 18, 2018\n\nRuns\n\n453\n\nInzi by a country mile. Sharma is many rungs below as a test batsman.\n\nkron\n\nFirst Class Captain\n\nJoined\n\nSep 5, 2023\n\nRuns\n\n4,382\n\nA prime Inzi better than RS\n\nMuch much better. Not even close. Rohit. Just pull up his record in tests outside Asia.\n\nAlso in odi it's a farce. Batting friendly era. Yea the bowlers are quality but the rules are so rigged in favour of batting. Inzi was a better batsman even in odi for me.\n\nkron\n\nFirst Class Captain\n\nJoined\n\nSep 5, 2023\n\nRuns\n\n4,382\n\nA Prime Rohit on song is 100 times better than Inzi in his prime on song. Inzi cannot hit a double even in flat decks on tiny grounds.\n\nInzi is limited even though he seemed to have lot of time while playing pacers.\n\nYea rohit is great at hitting double centuries in pointless bilaterals\n\nkron\n\nFirst Class Captain\n\nJoined\n\nSep 5, 2023\n\nRuns\n\n4,382\n\nAverages in modern times are inflated.\n\nIt was harder to bat during Inzi's time.\n\nInzi faced much better bowlers than Rohit also.\n\nDon't agree about better bowlers. Those same bowlers would struggle in current era too with the modern rules.\n\nBut I do agree it was a tougher era for batsman. So yes inzi>>> rohit\n\nChamp_Pal\n\nT20I Debutant\n\nJoined\n\nMar 3, 2022\n\nRuns\n\n7,538\n\nYea rohit is great at hitting double centuries in pointless bilaterals\n\nYou have to look at Rohit's centuries in World cups and Champions Trophy too. Rohit is a beast in big tournaments.\n\nInzi also played a boat load of meaningless bilaterals too. He only had 10 centuries after playing 380 ODI's. With a weak batting lineup, he had a ton of opportunities to score centuries against weak bowling attacks of India, Srilanka, New Zealand and England. Only Australia, WI and South Africa had formidable bowling attacks.\n\nInzi was a good ODI batsman. There is no question about his talent. But he massively underachieved. He can blame his own poor fitness.\n\ncharlie007\n\nTape Ball Star\n\nJoined\n\nJun 15, 2017\n\nRuns\n\n602\n\nIf I had to choose 1 batsman between Inzi and Rohit to bat for my life, I’m dying for sure. They are both a good 2 levels below Tendulkar the Test and Tendulkar and Kohli the ODI batsmen.\n\nNow that being out of the way, if talking about batting in a WC, I’d choose Rohit without a second thought. Same with batting against the best attacks in the world in their conditions, Inzamam would fold like a player having 2,3,6 in poker. In a long career, these averages speak a lot.\n\nIn Tests, however, while Rohit Sharma has improved a lot over the years, I would put Inzamam ahead. His record too in tests, as mediocre as it may be in South Africa and Australia that have had the greatest bowling attacks overall in combination with their alienness for Asian batsmen (movement and bounce) is somewhat more reliable than Rohit\n\nGiven I’d like to live a bit longer than a day, I’d choose Inzamam.\n\nBut make sure as hell, running between the wickets is not included in the analysis.\n\nBouncerGuy\n\nSuper Moderator\n\nJoined\n\nAug 29, 2023\n\nRuns\n\n16,448\n\nTBH it was not a fair comparison again between these 2 greats but Inzi edges out Rohit overall because of the era he played in. Rohit is a modern-day ODI great but he is not that good in Tests so Inzi for sure. Rohit has scored heavily in the tournaments where Inzi failed at it, but if you look at the quality of bowling they both faced, inzi had to face McGrath, and lee type bowlers and the rules then were also a bit tough then nowadays which are more inclined towards batting.\n\ncharlie007\n\nTape Ball Star\n\nJoined\n\nJun 15, 2017\n\nRuns\n\n602\n\nTBH it was not a fair comparison again between these 2 greats but Inzi edges out Rohit overall because of the era he played in.

Yes, different bowlers, different rules, and different conditions changes the equation a lot. But as the game evolves, there are other changes too. In Inzi’s time 250 was a decent score, but now 350 is quite gettable, and so the batting style and approach changes too, aggression becomes very important and hence risks are greater.\n\nBTW, this is supposed to be the most bowling friendly era stats wise, there was an article about it. So it’s all very subjective.\n\nIt’s never a fair comparison across eras.\n\nHitman\n\nTest Debutant\n\nJoined\n\nFeb 25, 2013\n\nRuns\n\n14,238\n\nIn ODI's, Inzamam was merely a good batsman with pathetic records in World Cups and Tournament Finals. Rohit is much, much better than him.\n\nIn Tests, Inzamam was much better anyday."
