        "text": "ODI cricket history through Impact Index – part 1\n\nInterestingly, all the major cricket-playing nations are involved in bilateral ODI cricket in the next 2 months (perhaps for the last time in such a concentrated period – this is almost like a solar eclipse, in a cricketing context). We take this opportunity to present a perspective on each country’s ODI cricket history over the next few weeks.\n\nWe begin with Pakistan. From 1973 to 2012 (before the current series in Sri Lanka), Pakistan played 772 matches and won 416 with a win-loss ratio of 1.25. Their highest score is 385, lowest 43. They won the World Cup in 1992 and reached the final in 1999.\n\nWe present three lists – of players, batsmen and bowlers. The minimum qualification to be on these lists is to have played 75 matches. A match is considered in this system only when there is a result, and if the player has bowled or batted, as the case may be.\n\nHere are the highest impact ODI players in their history.\n\nIt is interesting that bowlers dominate Pakistan’s impact charts in a format of the game naturally dominated by all-rounders and batsmen. Given the outstanding bowlers Pakistan has produced over the years, that should not be a surprise.\n\nIt is interesting also to note that Wasim Akram was not an all-rounder technically (he did not cross an IMPACT of 1 in batting) – he was easily the biggest big match player in Pakistan’s history though – and his 12 SDs (series/tournament-defining performances) tally puts him at the very top with Sanath Jayasuriya in ODI cricket history in this regard (8 of these 12 performances came just from bowling; the remaining 4 were all-round efforts). He also is the second-highest impact captain for Pakistan (after Imran Khan – who is, not surprisingly, up there as an all-round player as well).\n\nShahid Afridi is interestingly a higher impact bowler than a batsman in this format and despite just captaining in 33 matches, a successful leader as well, at least on paper (an important point which is otherwise lost in all the controversies around him). His tally of 7 SDs makes him the second-highest impact big match player in Pakistan’s ODI history.\n\nMohammed Hafeez’s all-round effectiveness is largely lost in conventional analysis – his overall consistency makes him a very high impact player. Aamer Sohail very narrowly makes it as an all-rounder (Bowling IMPACT just touches 1) – he was a big match player as well. Saqlain Mushtaq, Abdul Qadir and Waqar Younis are the other specialist bowlers on this high impact list.\n\nThe specialist batsmen come later on this list - Saleem Malik (at 15) and Inzamam-ul-Haq, Javed Miandad and Saeed Anwar (at 16, 17 and 19).\n\nMoin Khan and Kamran Akmal are the two wicketkeepers on this list – interestingly Moin Khan does not cross a Batting IMPACT of 1 and yet his 3 SD performances register a high impact for him – he was a big match player all right (Akmal has a higher Batting IMPACT but no SD – so his overall impact is lower).\n\nThese are the highest impact ODI batsmen in their history.\n\nPerhaps the only big surprise here would be the presence of Salman Butt in the list of highest impact 10 Pakistani batsmen. Though he narrowly passes the minimum qualification of 75 matches, his batting consistency and singular SD suggested a batsman of considerable potential – the 2010 spot-fixing scandal ended a more promising career than what conventional analysis have perhaps indicated.\n\nInterestingly, Aamer Sohail is the only all-rounder on this list (though, just about).\n\nIt is also immensely interesting that Javed Miandad has only 1 series/ tournament-defining performance to his credit in his career – it is one of the most famous ODI moments in Pakistan’s history – and is a great example of how a stirring dramatic moment can form impressions of a player right through a career.\n\nNOTE: Our minimum qualification is 75 matches, but if we were to reduce that to, say 50, Zaheer Abbas becomes Pakistan’s highest impact batsman ever, by a big distance. His Batting IMPACT of 2.38 (in 62 matches) with one SD also puts him amongst the ten highest impact batsmen in ODI cricket history then. Umar Akmal (58 matches, 1.76) is amongst Pakistan’s ten highest impact batsmen too then.\n\nThe stories that unfold on various batting parameters are revealing.\n\nWhen it comes to Runs Tally IMPACT (proportion of match runs made through career), the highest impact batsmen are Saeed Anwar, Javed Miandad and Rameez Raja.\n\nThe highest Strike Rate IMPACT batsmen (highest strike rates relative to all the matches in their careers) are Shahid Afridi, Abdul Razzaq and Saeed Anwar.\n\nThe best Pressure IMPACT batsmen (those who absorbed the most pressure that came about due to fall of wickets) are Javed Miandad, Younis Khan and Mohammad Yousuf.\n\nThe batsmen with the highest Partnership Building IMPACT (who built the most partnerships in the middle) are Mohammad Yousuf, Javed Miandad and Misbah-ul-Haq.\n\nThe best Chasing IMPACT batsmen (who registered the highest impact while chasing a target) are Misbah-ul-Haq, Mohammad Yousuf and Saeed Anwar.\n\nThe batsmen with the lowest failure rates (a failure is seen in this system as an inability to register an IMPACT of even 1 in a match) are Saeed Anwar, Javed Miandad and Misbah-ul-Haq.\n\nThe Highest Impact Batting Performances in Pakistan’s ODI history\n\n1. Ijaz Ahmed – 139 not out off 84 v India, Lahore, 1997 – Batting IMPACT 12.18\n\nOn a pitch where India made heavy weather of scoring 216 (perhaps weighed down with the series at 1-1), Ijaz Ahmed finished the match off (with Afridi) before a relatively weakened Indian attack knew what hit it.\n\n2. Mohammad Yousuf – 129 off 131 v Sri Lanka, Sharjah, 2002 – Batting IMPACT 9.22\n\nWalking in at 33-2 at the Sharjah Cup final, Yousuf Youhana (as he was called then) controlled the innings immaculately and took his team to an unassailable score of 295. A star-studded Sri Lankan batting line-up collapsed for 78 to give that innings mythical status.\n\n3. Javed Miandad – 116 not out v India, Sharjah, 1986 – Batting IMPACT 9.07\n\nPerhaps the most celebrated batting performance in Pakistan’s ODI history, Miandad walked out to bat at 39-2 as Pakistan chased down a more-than-decent 245 at the Australasia Cup Final. He took charge while wickets fell at regular intervals around him, and stood out of his crease with 4 balls required off the last ball. Chetan Sharma produced the perfect full toss and it was swung away for the most debilitating six in Indian cricket history. The innings had an IMPACT of 9.07 within a match context but in a historical context (which cannot yet be measured, despite attempts like this), this was as high impact as a single\n\nblow in cricket has ever got.\n\nThe above performances are all within the series/tournament context. The highest impact batting performance within a match context in Pakistan’s ODI history is Rameez Raja’s 119 off 155 balls against New Zealand in Christchurch, during the group stages of the 1992 World Cup. Chasing New Zealand’s 166, and coming in at 9-2, Raja compiled 75% of the required runs in about 3 hours of batting. Bizarrely, Mushtaq Ahmed (who took 2-18 in 10 overs) got the Man-of-the-Match award even though his match impact was about 70% below Raja’s.\n\nIjaz Ahmed’s unbeaten 139 off 84 v India (Lahore, 1997) and Inzamam-ul-Haq’s unbeaten 85 off 67 v New Zealand (Sharjah, 1999) are the next highest impact innings within a match context.\n\nThese are the highest impact ODI bowlers in Pakistan’s history."
