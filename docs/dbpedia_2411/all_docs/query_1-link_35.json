        "text": "robelinda2\n\nA seemingly random YouTube channel, one might watch one of their videos and be forgiven for thinking that \"robelinda2\" is one of many innocuous channels that has the one useful video that somehow got viral. But this not-for-profit effort by a pleasant (or so I assume) Australian chap named Rob Moody is a treasure trove of old, new, classic, funny, and often random cricket clips. From Lasith Malinga's debut spell against Australia to a hilarious clip of a cricketer getting stuck in the boundary fence and losing his boot, robelinda2 will scratch most of your cricket itches. I'd recommend any of the videos containing sledging from some of Australia's modern greats like Adam Gilchrist, or Mitchell Johnson. The Australian sense of humour really shows with the video titles, which do a great job of hooking you in with an Inzamam-ul-Haq runout, but making you stay for the Shane Warne legbreak that turns a mile.\n\nFantail\n\nFantail is a cricket equipment manufacturer based out of New Zealand. I don't play cricket and even if I did, I wouldn't get my bats from New Zealand, but what I love about Fantail is their YouTube content. They used to upload regular videos of restoring busted up old bats, which had an odd calming effect on me that I keep going back for whenever I need it. They have videos of making custom bats to order for their fans, or making replicas of famous, more expensive bats by other manufacturers. The polite looking gentleman who runs the channel does an excellent job, and his Kiwi accent (with the buzz of a mechanical saw in the background) just adds to the atmosphere of calm these videos induce.\n\nweCricket\n\nThis is a channel run by two cricket fans and amateur cricket players from England, who just like to have a bit of fun with the game of cricket. They don't like Virat Kohli, but appreciate his greatness, and they often have a go at bowling machines to see if they're any good. Dan and Kez have tried to play the video game Cricket 19 blindfolded, done impressions of famous cricketers, played with a GBP 5 bat to see how it compares to GBP 450 one. Other than all the craziness, they do have videos where they just sit down and talk about the current issues in the world of cricket. These videos are not as fun, but the two channel-runners always look slightly underprepared and that adds to the entertainment."
