        "text": "Controversies• Invitation to Non-Muslim players to accept Islam\n\nIn 2020, there was a controversy when he said in an interview that while playing club cricket in England, he, along with fellow Pakistani bowler Saqlain Mushtaq and Indian batsman Wasim Jaffer, gave the Dawat of Islam (Invitation to non-muslims to accept Islam) to many non-muslim players of different countries in the dressing room after the match. He said, \"I, Saqlain Mushtaq, and Wasim Zafar (Indian Muslim cricketer) used to convert Non-Muslim cricketers to Islam in England.\"\n\n• Calling Indian players selfish\n\nHe appeared in an episode of the chat show of Ramiz Raja and said that most of the Indian players during his playing years were selfish and played for their own records, and most of the Pakistani players played for the team. He said, \"When we played against India, their batting was more powerful than us on paper. But even our batsmen scored 30 or 40 runs, it was for the team, but for India, even if they scored 100 runs, they played for themselves, so, that was the difference between the two sides.\"\n\n• Beating an Indian fan\n\nInzamam was playing in a match in Sahara Cup at Toronto, Canada in 1997, when an Indian fan started calling Inzamam Aloo (Potato) and Motu (Fat Boy), using megaphone or loudspeaker, which angered him. Inzamam was fielding at slip at that time, and whenever Inzamam put his hands on his back, the fan said that Inzamam was feeling potatoes in his stomach. Inzamam became so angry at the fan's catcalling that he went into the stands and tried to beat him up with a bat. The security personnel took Inzamam out of the stands and also evicted the fan from the stadium.\n\n• Refusing to continue the test match at Oval\n\nPakistan was playing a test match against England at Oval in 2006, and Inzamam was the captain of the Pakistan in that match. During the match, umpire Darrell Hair decided that Pakistani team tampered with the ball and awarded 5 runs to England following which Inzamam approached Hair and asked him the basis of his decision. When Hair did not give any satisfactory response, Inzamam decided to discontinue the match, which was the first instance in history when an ongoing test match was forfeited. In an interview, he referred to Hair as biased towards Pakistan, and the decision was a breach of ICC rules and said, \"He felt that the ball was tampered and awarded five runs to the opposition and as per ICC rules, it meant we were proved guilty of doing it. So I went up to Darrell Hair and asked him what exactly was wrong with the ball. As per ICC rule the umpire informs a player if he’s guilty before awarding those five runs. However, I was not informed. Then I decided that I cannot lead a team like this and waited 15-20 minutes to show everyone the entire team protested against the decision. Hair too refused to come out in the field and continue with the match. I feel that if Hair refused the third umpire should have continued with the match from there. But the umpires are selected by ICC for their events, so ICC backed him.\"\n\n• Dispute with Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB)\n\nDifferences between Inzamam and PCB became headlines in 2013 when he said that PCB did not approach him to accompany Pakistani team as a batting consultant on their tour to South Africa; however, PCB chairman Zaka Ashraf said that the board approached Inzamam; however, they could not reach an agreement about the terms and conditions of the contract. Inzamam further added that there were some problems with the PCB chairman due to which he was not contacted.\n\n• War of words with Rohit Sharma\n\nAfter India beat Australia by 24 runs in a T20 World Cup Super-Eight game in June 2024, he made ball-tampering allegations India. According to Inzamam, he felt it was unreal to see the ball reverse-swinging in the 15th over of the Indian innings bowled by Arshdeep Singh. Rohit Sharma later responded to him and suggested he should 'use his brain' to which Inzamam replied and said he should not teach him about the reverse swing."
