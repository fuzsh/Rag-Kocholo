Inzamam-ul-Haq - the name is an institution in Pakistan cricket. The man is an all-time great and a legend in many ways. The only Pakistani with over 10,000 ODI runs, a World Cup Winner and an entertainer to the core.

Not known to be the fastest runner between wickets, Inzamam still has a record worthy of mentioning. He has also represented Pakistan in 5 World Cups and played some top-notch innings along the way.

Who can forget the epic 60 vs New Zealand in the 1992 semifinal or the brilliant 329 against the same opposition in a Test in 2002? It remains the 2nd highest Test score by a Pakistani batter.

The numbers back him as well.

In 120 Tests, Inzamam has scored 8830 runs at an average of 49.60. In 200 innings with 22 not-outs, the man has 25 hundreds and 46 fifties which are just amazing. In 378 ODIs, he scored 11,739 runs at an average of 39.52. In 350 innings with 53 not-outs, Inzamam hit 10 centuries and 83 fifties. At one point he did hold the record for the most ODI 50s. He was also the 2nd batter ever to cross the 10,000-run barrier in the format. In his only T20I appearance, he made 11 not out.

Blessed with both power and timing, Inzamam was a deadly prospect when on song. Those across the border know it all too well. His epic 184 in Bengaluru in 2005 helped Pakistan win the Test to draw the series. Under Inzamam's leadership, Pakistan won a historic ODI series 4-2 after being 2-0 down on Indian soil.

Inzamam shall go down in history as the gentle giant who let the bat do the talking. Yes, he was a poor runner, but his record is exceptional in spite of it.
