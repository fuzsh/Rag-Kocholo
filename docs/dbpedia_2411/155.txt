A fresh-faced Inzamam-ul-Haq truly announced himself on the global stage with a savage display of hitting that propelled Pakistan to their first World Cup final in 1992, flattening the celebratory mood at Eden Park, Auckland, as co-hosts crashed out.

The 22-year-old could have no better foil than the vastly experienced Javed Miandad at the other end as Pakistan, set 263 runs to win, sought to recover from 140-4 after both Rameez Raja and Imran Khan failed to turn starts into match-winning knocks.

Strong off his legs and quick to pounce on anything leg-side, Inzamam rattled to a 31-ball fifty, his solitary six a towering inside-out drive that just about cleared the boundary rider.

Nimble between the wickets, the pair put on 87 for the fifth wicket before Inzamam chanced his luck once too often and was run out sprinting to the striker’s end by Chris Harris’ direct hit.

New Zealand skipper Mark Crowe watched anxiously from the sidelines after pulling a hamstring while compiling a majestic 91 off 83 balls in his side’s healthy total of 262-7 as the match went down to the wire.

Wasim Akram came and went but Miandad stood firm and gave plenty of strike to wicketkeeper Moin Khan, who stuck two fours and a six in an 11-ball 20no that sealed New Zealand’s fate with six balls still remaining.

Inzamam was duly named man of the match and would go on to play a pivotal role in the final, striking 42 runs off just 35 balls, to power Pakistan to a total that proved to be beyond England’s reach.
