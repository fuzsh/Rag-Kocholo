Be it for religious or moral reasons, some men and women have found no justification for breaking their conscientious objection to violence. In many cases, this objection has lead to severe punishment at the hands of their own governments, usually lengthy prison terms. Peter Brock brings the voices of imprisoned conscientious objectors to the fore in ‘These Strange Criminals.’ This important and thought-provoking anthology consists of thirty prison memoirs by conscientious objectors to military service, drawn from the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, and centring on their jail experiences during the First and Second World Wars and the Cold War. Voices from history – like those of Stephen Hobhouse, Dame Kathleen Lonsdale, Ian Hamilton, Alfred Hassler, and Donald Wetzel – come alive, detailing the impact of prison life and offering unique perspectives on wartime government policies of conscription and imprisonment. Sometimes intensely moving, and often inspiring, these memoirs show that in some cases, individual conscientious objectors – many well-educated and politically aware – sought to reform the penal system from within either by publicizing its dysfunction or through further resistance to authority. The collection is an essential contribution to our understanding of criminology and the history of pacifism, and represents a valuable addition to prison literature. peter brock is a professor emeritus in the Department of History at the University of Toronto.\n\nIllustration by Lowell Naeve\n\n‘THESE STRANGE CRIMINALS’ An Anthology of Prison Memoirs by Conscientious Objectors from the Great War to the Cold War\n\nEdited by Peter Brock\n\nUNIVERSITY OF TORONTO PRESS Toronto Buffalo London\n\n© University of Toronto Press Incorporated 2004 Toronto Buffalo London Printed in Canada ISBN 0-8020-8707-8 (cloth) ISBN 0-8020-8661-6 (paper)\n\nPrinted on acid-free paper\n\nNational Library of Canada Cataloguing in Publication ‘These strange criminals’ : an anthology of prison memoirs by conscientious objectors from the Great War to the Cold War / edited by Peter Brock.

The editor, Peter Brock, tells us that his intent is to contribute to the ethnographic study of the prison and prison(er) culture, and to add the distinctive perspective of this category of prisoners to the literary genre of prison writing. Firmly located within the twentieth-century history of pacifism and antiwar movements, this collection introduces a spirited group of political dissidents, their view of the prison and the societies that created them, and it succeeds brilliantly. The prison emerges from these narratives, its characteristic features highlighted by their numbing repetition, and the spirit and resistance of the authors shines through as testimony to their significance as moral and political commentators of their eras. The historical organization and contextualization of the narratives, and the representative scope of this selection allow Peter Brock to capture the heartbeat of the universal prison experience: the essential loss of freedom and self-determination to the dominating and immutable power of the prison. In recounting their carceral experiences, these writers also succeed in elucidating their age and societies, and the moral philosophies that inform their movements and communities. The editor’s introductions to each historical period, the biographical sketches of the writers, and the footnotes provide the essential context for broadly locating these narratives, and serve to connect them to a multiplicity of academic disciplines and interests. They ground the ideological positions of the writers within their traditions of radical dissent. They also locate the prison, and its changing forms of penal discipline and regime. The editor’s decision to provide long narrative pieces contributes significantly to this accomplishment. The broad range of writers selected and their order of presentation combines to produce a flowing and integrated exploration of political dissent and its penal\n\nx\n\nForeword\n\nsuppression in the twentieth century. The majority of the writers are well educated, articulate, and politically conscious. Their accounts provide critical insights into the operation of the prison. Generally progressive for their era, often their analysis and understanding predates similar discoveries and conclusions in penology. For example, Hobhouse, Lonsdale, Axford, and Hassler present the essentials of the ‘proven failure of imprisonment’ argument that only becomes established in penology in the 1970s. Indeed, Price provides a distinctly ‘penal abolitionist’ argument that is consistent with the contemporary analysis of that social movement. This selection of prison writing also mirrors the range of styles and formats that characterize this genre through the centuries. In memoirs, letters home, political tracts and pamphlets, the reader encounters a plethora of traditional voices. These include the astonishment and horror of the innocent and naive’s first encounter with penal justice (Wigham); the moral denunciation of the reformer (Hobhouse); and the ‘How to Resist’ strategies of the prisoner activist (Miller). While these narratives are generally defiant, the ‘bitter humour’ of Hamilton epitomizes the defiant contempt of the carnivalesque style of prison writing. These resisters write from the heart and accost the prison, ‘the insolence of its sadistic staff’ (Hamilton), and the ‘endless round of petty routine, overlaying the ever present fear and hostility’ (Hassler) that constitute its regimes. These accounts provide an opportunity to study the ethnography of the prison from a unique set of lenses, that of prisoners of conscience, who successfully overturned the debilitating stigma of criminalization, and were able to resist the consequent transformation of their social identity into that of the socially discredited criminal and convict. Unlike common ‘criminals,’ they are able to take the moral and intellectual high ground, from which they cast moral condemnation upon their captors and the prison institution. The absence of guilt or remorse is obvious: ‘Four years of my life for refusing to kill?’ (Osborne), ‘I was rather proud of my status’ (Brock). Outside community and political support served to further legitimate their stance and strengthen their resolve to resist. Ioan Davies (1990) in Writers in Prison argues that many prisoners of conscience write from the margins of their society and the prison. This is clearly the case for most of these writers, especially those imprisoned in the regime of ‘silence and solitude’ dominant during the first two world wars. Their marginal position provides the distance and relative detachment desired in the participant observer and ethnographer of the prison. Often their accounts evoke the alienated detachment of\n\nForeword\n\nxi\n\nMersault in Albert Camus’s L’Etranger or the wonder and incredulity of Kafka’s ‘A Report to the Academy’ and ‘In the Penal Colony.’ Those incarcerated for long periods (Hamilton) and, to a lesser extent, those imprisoned in the congregate labour and reformative regimes of the United States (Osborne, Miller) are drawn into the centre of prison culture and prisoners’ traditional resistance to the domination of the prison. In Hamilton we encounter the perfect synthesis. The radical humanist /political agitator integrated into the collective resistance of the prisoner community for whom ‘resistance is the only outlet for independence.’ This is another instance in which the selection of writers enriches the text. These narratives serve to illuminate the prison. There is a consistency in the prisoners’ accounts, produced by their encounters with the universals of the prison institution. This consistency attests to the immutable and enduring characteristics of the carceral. The induction into the prison and its routinized humiliations stands out as a defining moment in the experience of incarceration. The loss of autonomy, the mortifying invasion of privacy (strip searches, showers, lavatory), poor diet and lack of medical attention, the cell, and the transformation of social identity into that of convict are thoroughly addressed in these accounts. ‘It was just awful. It was degrading to think that your fellow human beings could treat you like that, it’s almost too horrible to describe because you can’t really believe that conditions could exist like that in 1942’ (Wigham, p. 251 below). The growing sense of lost autonomy that envelops the prisoner, though resisted, permeates these accounts. This experience of the loss of control was heightened during the air raids on Britain during the Second World War. ‘And then you’d hear the sirens going, and hear gunfire and bombs dropping, and then this would aggravate the girls; you know there would be terrible tension ... All night you were left hearing and knowing that you’re trapped, knowing you can’t get out, you can’t possibly ... you had no escape’ (Wigham, 250–1). Of particular note are the abusive and harassing ‘screws’ who feature prominently in the pervasive degradation of the carceral experience. Save for the accounts of a few imprisoned souls resting in the bosom of the Lord, the staff is usually portrayed as ‘sullen and officious,’ the ‘hectoring and sadistic type,’ and a major source of the pains of imprisonment. The analysis of the deference and demeanour relationships of ‘convict and screw’ are insightful, and elucidate the power relations of the total institution in the daily routines of carceral life. For the penologist, the diverse locations and penal eras from which these narratives\n\nxii\n\nForeword\n\nare drawn provide a clear depiction of the enduring features of penal domination and regime. While the physical hardships of imprisonment play a part, especially in the accounts of First World War COs, it is the psychological hardship, and the recognition of the debilitating effects of imprisonment upon the mental, spiritual, and social well-being of the prisoner that are most discussed. The constant surveillance of the panoptic gaze, the loss of control and self-determination, the mental debilitation of isolation and solitary confinement all feature prominently in these accounts, as they do in penology and prison ethnography generally. Surviving prison necessitates resistance to its domination, ‘so as not to assist in [one’s] own imprisonment’ (Wetzel). Above all, these are accounts of the resistance of the righteous, whose moral position and political insights, educated and articulate voices, stand in condemnation of the prison and the society that imprisons. This is writing as resistance. These are consciously constructed moral denunciations of the prison as an institution whose intent is to ‘break the spirit,’ and which succeeds only in creating the delinquent, hardening criminality and ensuring recividism. Though some of these biographical narratives were written years or decades after the experience of imprisonment, these authors still rankle at the pervasive degradation they endured and their treatment at the hands of staff, which attests to the indelible marks left by the experience. This seems to be the case for editor and contributor Peter Brock, whose own carceral experiences underscore this endeavour, adding a rare and insightful dimension to the organization and selection of the texts. The multilevel analyses and diverse discourses of this anthology provide a wealth of information, and suggest new research questions for a range of scholarly disciplines and interests. The vitality of this marvellous cast of characters stands out as a testimony to the human spirit. Their moral and political commentary is as pertinent to the present as it was to the past. Indeed, in the current age of mass imprisonment, such moral direction is badly needed. Brock’s anthology rescues these voices from the dustbin of history and gives them new life and relevance. This anthology significantly adds to the timeless portrait of the universal prison, and reaffirms the indictment of this institution as ‘treason to social justice.’ Robert Gaucher, PhD Department of Criminology University of Ottawa November 2003\n\nPreface\n\nThe narratives printed in this anthology represent a sampling from prison memoirs composed by conscientious objectors (COs) from five countries (and a sixth in an appendix). They deal with the two world wars and the Cold War era. There were, of course, COs in other countries during the period covered by this book as well as during other time periods than the ones included here – for instance, the interwar years. I trust, though, that I have presented sufficient materials to be of use to at least two classes of readers. First come students of penology, to whom the observations of ‘these strange criminals’ (the phrase is that of Britain’s pacifist Bishop E.W. Barnes of Birmingham in 1941) should prove a useful addition to the prison ethnography produced during the same period by ‘common criminals.’ In fact, I do not think penologists, even the new school of ‘convict criminology,’ have realized the extent of prison memoir writing by twentieth-century conscientious objectors (indeed by COs since the 1890s). One of the purposes I hope this volume will fulfil is to bring this genre of prison literature to their notice. Second, students of peace history cannot, I believe, fail to find here a new understanding of what it has meant to be a pacifist in wartime – whether the war was a great war, a good war, or a cold war, or the Vietnam War. ‘Are they embittered, or have they an inward spiritual peace? Does anger distort their vision ...?’ asks Bishop Barnes of these memoirists. The narratives printed here, from the pens of religious objectors as well as from ‘non-religious’ whose inspiration has been humanist or philosophical or political, will answer the bishop’s questions. Introducing the report he compiled in 1948 on British wartime prisons, Mark Benney, ex–professional burglar turned amateur penologist, wrote that ‘if it is agreed that ex-prisoners are not the most trustworthy of witnesses ... conscientious objectors are obviously a class apart from the ordinary run of prison inmates ... No one,’ he went on, ‘will believe\n\nxiv Preface\n\nthem prone to deliberate misrepresentation or distortion of fact ... On the other hand, the very qualities of conscience which sent them to prison will make them perhaps more rigorous in their judgments and certainly more limited in their experience than is wholly desirable in a prison witness.’ Yet every historic witness has his or her shortcomings, which the careful reader should be trained to take into consideration while assessing the value of any memoir. I have chosen to give fairly extensive extracts from my sources instead of the gobbets and snippets favoured by some anthologists. The latter method may sometimes be appropriate, though I have usually felt rather frustrated by its use. In the present instance I trust readers will find the ample space permitted each author to be rewarding. The documents printed below, though limited in terms of gender (because among the few women COs – in the eyes of the law – very few have been jailed) and in the time span and area covered, do, I believe, add a new dimension to our perception of the carceral experience over the last century. The introductions in this book are intended merely as background to the prison narratives that follow. They do not aim at providing a detailed account of pacifism and conscientious objection in the countries and during the periods covered. For this, I would refer readers to the relevant sections of my book, co-authored with Nigel Young, Pacifism in the Twentieth Century (Syracuse, NY: Syracuse University Press, 1999). Some readers, of course, may wish to move straight to the narratives themselves, which form the core of the book. Good luck to them! I do indeed think that these texts, together with the notes appended to them, can be read with profit without further introduction. On the other hand, the introductions can assist a reader needing more informational support. I should note that I have interpreted the term ‘memoir’ rather more broadly than is perhaps usual, so as to include fragments as well as selfcontained units. I have also, in two cases (Lonsdale and Wigham, pp. 232 and 243), extended the definition of conscientious objection ‘to military service’ so as to include women objectors in Second World War Britain who were jailed for refusing, respectively, to perform firewatching duties under compulsion (a libertarian objection) and to obey a direction under wartime industrial conscription. The terms ‘jail’ and ‘prison’ have been used interchangeably here. But in the United States jails are city or county institutions, intended primarily for persons with short sentences, whereas those sentenced to more than twelve months,\n\nPreface xv\n\nafter a brief stay in a jail, are sent to a prison of one type or another, whose inmates are usually known as convicts or felons. I would like to thank Christine Chattin for producing a neatly typed diskette out of the untidy materials I presented to her. I would also like to thank William Hetherington, Honorary Archivist of the Peace Pledge Union (London), for helping me in my search for documentation, and Malcolm Thomas, Joanna Clark, and Josef Keith, who provided me with the same kind of assistance at the Library of the Religious Society of Friends (London). The staff of the Imperial War Museum (London) Sound Archive were also most helpful during my visits to the museum. At the University of Toronto Press Len Husband, Humanities Editor, and Frances Mundy, Editor, Managing Editorial Department, have been very supportive of my project, while John St James proved an extremely competent copy-editor. My warm thanks go out to the three of them. Lastly – but by no means least – it is a pleasure to express my gratitude to the Interlibrary Loan department of the Robarts Library, University of Toronto, for their assistance to me throughout the years.

It was associated there, in particular, with three religious sects, the Quakers (known also as the Society of Friends), the Mennonites, and the German Baptist Brethren (known today as the Church of the Brethren). Mennonites and Brethren, who had sought refuge in North America from their original homeland in Central Europe, rarely went to jail on account of their conscientious refusal to bear arms, since they usually succeeded in reaching an acceptable modus vivendi with the state on this issue. Not so the Quakers – either in Great Britain, where the sect had originated in the 1650s, or in the West Indies or in North America, where Quakers were already to be found in comparatively large numbers in the colonial era. Throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, on both sides of the Atlantic, the authorities imposed a draft for service in the militia, which mustered regularly and in case of a military emergency. It was, however, always possible to opt out by paying a small fine in lieu of serving. Mennonites and Brethren did not object to paying this, since they regarded it simply as rendering to Caesar his due. But Quakers believed it was wrong to do so and ‘disowned’ members of their Society who paid a fine: a penalty that, of course, they also imposed on those who actually bore arms (until the practice of disownment lapsed in the course of the nineteenth century). The state, according to the Quakers, had no right to demand money from its citizens because they were acting according to what their consciences told them was right. As a result, Quaker militia-draftees had their goods distrained for their refusal to pay commutation in lieu of bearing arms, or, if they did not possess sufficient property, they were briefly jailed. The traditional British militia draft eventually faded out in the 1830s. Henceforward military recruitment relied solely on the voluntary system, although in the early years of the twentieth century, especially among Conservatives, voices were heard calling for the imposition of conscript service for the country’s youth. Most Liberals and Socialists, by contrast, opposed military conscription as undemocratic and contrary to the English idea of freedom. In the United States – and in Canada, too – the militia system had become increasingly moribund during the antebellum period. After the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861, military conscription was imposed both in the North and in the Confederate States. All the peace sects encountered difficulties in preserving their pacifist witness intact; in the South they were associated in the minds of the authorities with anti-\n\n4\n\n‘These Strange Criminals’\n\nslavery. Although on both sides of the fighting line some COs suffered imprisonment, peace came in 1865 before there was time for more rigorous conscription laws to come into effect. The United States then returned to the voluntary system until in 1917 conscription was reintroduced. Meanwhile, throughout the European continent, universal military service became the rule, with a loophole for non-resistant Mennonites who, in Prussia and Russia, could perform respectively non-combatant army and civilian forestry service in lieu of bearing arms.1 Though during this age of Realpolitik English-speaking countries were fortunately free of the burden of military conscription, compulsory military training for teenagers, the so called ‘boy conscription,’ was introduced in Australia and New Zealand in 1911 and continued until the outbreak of war. In both countries the small minority of pacifists, including some Quakers, resisted the implementation of the law and were willing to see their sons go to prison rather than train. Opponents of boy conscription also included a number of socialist antimilitarists. These people were not necessarily absolute pacifists. They certainly condemned international war between capitalist states unreservedly, but most expressed willingness to fight in defence of a post-revolutionary regime and also, when the right moment arrived, to take up arms in order to achieve the new socialist order. Many of the British and American COs jailed in the First World War were drawn from this category of antiwarist: the authorities were often unsympathetic to their claim to CO status – as they were to humanist objectors – since they did not usually base it on any religious motivation. The outbreak of war in August 1914 had changed the situation radically. In Britain public pressure to introduce military conscription grew, even though some members of the Liberal government still regarded the idea with abhorrence. In July 1915 came national registration of male adults, and in January of the next year the first Military Service Act was passed. It came into force in March. At first only unmarried men between the ages of eighteen and forty-one were affected, but by the beginning of 1918 all able-bodied males between eighteen and fifty-six became liable to conscription. Provision was made for conscientious objectors; on paper, at any rate, this was remarkably generous. Tribunals could grant COs, including non-religious objectors whom they judged to be sincere, either unconditional exemption or assignment to civilian employment considered ‘of national importance’ or to non-combatant service in the army.\n\nThe Great War 5\n\nThe flaw lay in the fact that the tribunals, whether local or appeal, which made the decisions were not set up specifically to deal with conscientious objection. Their major concern was in fact to deal with the growing manpower shortage. A military officer sat on every tribunal; his view usually carried most weight in CO as well as in other cases heard. Thus unconditional exemption was granted very rarely, assignment to the army’s Non-Combatant Corps, unacceptable to a large number of COs, being the most frequently imposed condition of exemption. Tribunals also tended to disfavour non-religious objectors, even when these men were clearly sincere in their objection to fighting. Pacifists and antimilitarists soon began to organize to resist conscription and to support war resisters after its introduction. The No-Conscription Fellowship, set up near the end of 1914, became the focal point of resistance. Membership eventually reached almost 10,000, with 6000 members belonging to the socialist Independent Labour Party (ILP) and Quakers forming the next largest component. Many young Quakers adopted the ‘absolutist’ stand and steadfastly refused to accept anything but unconditional exemption. The Quaker Society of Friends, while it did not officially take a stand on this issue, gave full support to all its members who went to jail as absolutists.2 Almost all denominations produced at least a few COs. Yet there were scarcely any Catholics and not many Anglican COs. All but a handful of the established church’s clergy supported the war. An exception was E.W. Barnes, the future Bishop Barnes, who, as Master of the Temple in London, courageously voiced his pacifism. Quaker absolutists, and ILP unconditionalists like Clifford Allen or Fenner Brockway, constituted the majority of those COs who went to prison in the First World War. But other COs found themselves in jail, too, if their application had been rejected or their tribunal had given them an unacceptable alternative to combatant service. A few libertarians had refused to apply for exemption at all and thus had not appeared before any tribunal. According to Constance Braithwaite,3 ‘up to the end of July 1919 a total of 5739 objectors were sentenced by court martial.’ Arrests had begun as early as March 1916 – either for failing to obey an army call-up notice or for ignoring assignment to civilian alternative service when the assignee was ‘deemed’ to be a soldier ‘in the reserve.’ In that case, writes Braithwaite, ‘the usual procedure was for the man to be arrested by the police and ... taken before a magistrate ... formally fined £2 (very often never paid) and handed over to the military escort\n\n6\n\n‘These Strange Criminals’\n\nwho took him to the unit to which he had been called up ... On arrival at his unit the objector, if determined to continue his resistance, soon committed some act of technical disobedience, such as refusing to salute or to wear khaki. He was now ... subject to the provisions of army law.’ Court martial and imprisonment followed. A few COs were shipped to the battle zone in France and there subjected to various brutalities and even sentenced to death, though this was finally commuted to ten years’ penal servitude as the result of protests at home. Most CO defaulters did not have to face the possibility – probability – of death as this group had done. Still, their fate was still not an easy one. To quote Braithwaite again: ‘A sentence of imprisonment did not release from the army: at the end of his sentence an objector was returned to his army unit where, if he again disobeyed orders, he spent a few days in the guardroom and then received a further sentence from a court-martial.’ From a total of nearly 6000 jailed objectors, around 850 ‘were in prison for twenty months or more’ and ‘some were in prison for nearly three years’ as a result of the same kind of cat-and-mouse treatment that had been handed out to suffragettes in the pre-war years. In addition, most COs were sentenced to ‘hard labour ... considered by the law to be the most severe form of imprisonment.’ Before long, owing in part to pressure from the COs’ friends inside parliament and outside, the British government made certain concessions. In the first place, in July 1916 it set up what became known as the Home Office Scheme, a system of civilian alternative service under semi-penal conditions. Most jailed COs, who were not absolutists, accepted the Scheme and were released from prison. In addition, the conditions of imprisonment for those COs who refused to accept the Scheme were alleviated in a number of ways. Provision, for instance, was made for the release of those in poor health; the preliminary period of solitary confinement of men sentenced to hard labour was shortened; visits were allowed more frequently as well as conversation at exercise periods, although the silence rule remained otherwise in force; and COs exchanged the broad-arrow prison uniform they had worn hitherto along with ordinary criminals for their own clothes. The Armistice came on 11 November 1918, but COs remained in jail. Release of those who still had time to do took place between April and August 1919. In New Zealand conscription came into force in June 1916. The small Labour Party, which opposed the war, took a strong anticonscriptionist stand, and several of its leaders were jailed for sedition as a result of\n\nThe Great War 7\n\ncarrying on antiwar propaganda. The government provided for conscientious objection, but, in contrast to the mother country, it interpreted this in a very narrow spirit. In fact, it granted exemption only to members of pre-war pacifist sects – and then only with respect to combatant service. As a result, the CO exemption clause of the conscription act in practice applied only to Quakers and Christadelphians, both very small denominations and both conscientiously opposed to serving in the armed forces. Thus, this kind of exemption failed to provide any relief to either Quaker or Christadelphian COs, and they ended up in jail too. Unaffiliated Christian pacifists, like the Baxter brothers for instance, had no option, of course, except prison – or worse – if they chose to remain loyal to their principles.4 The United States did not enter the war until 6 April 1917. The Selective Service Act passed by Congress next month exempted from combatant service only COs who belonged to a pacifist sect. All males between the ages of twenty-one and thirty were required to register for service. Registration took place on 5 June. What exactly would be required of COs whom the local boards found to be genuine within the meaning of the act remained unclear. Thus, even on paper American CO legislation proved much less liberal than the corresponding English legislation. Its implementation only added to the confusion; in practice it frequently proved unfair and harsh.5 Apart from a few non-registrants, almost all COs found themselves in one of the army camps set up throughout the country. This unsatisfactory situation stemmed in large part from the weakness of the American pacifist movement at this time and its almost total lack of representation in Congress. The three peace churches – Quakers, Mennonites, and Brethren – supported their COs but lacked a political ally such as the No-Conscription Fellowship furnished in Britain. True, the American Socialist Party courageously opposed the war, but its leaders, such as Eugene V. Debs, were savagely persecuted by the wartime authorities. And much the same harsh treatment was meted out to the country’s conscientious objectors who resisted conscription.6 Eventually the president, recognizing the legitimacy of non-religious objections to military service, had designated the Medical, Quartermaster, and Engineering Corps as suitable locations for conscientious objectors. But while over 16,000 of the COs deemed sincere by their local boards had agreed to serve in the army either as combatants or non-combatants, 3500 men remained in camp. During the final months of the war most of these men were furloughed to work on farms or in\n\n8\n\n‘These Strange Criminals’\n\nhospitals, or with the American Friends Service Committee on overseas relief. However, some COs were not offered this alternative or rejected it on principle. Considered ‘sullen and defiant,’ they were put on trial.7 Courts martial then sentenced 450 COs to periods of imprisonment of up to twenty-five years; a few were given life or even sentenced to death (though this was never carried out). Among those convicted were members of the peace churches or other Christian denominations as well as socialist, anarchist, and humanist objectors. A CO from one of America’s German peace sects, Maurice Hess, expressed the convictions of this group of objectors in the following words: ‘I do not think I am seeking martyrdom ... But ... I know the teaching of Christ, our Savior. He taught us to resist not evil [and] to love our enemies ... I pray God for strength to remain faithful.’8 Typical of the absolutists was the socialist CO Jacob Wortsman, who in 1917 stated to his court martial: ‘I cannot accept military service in any capacity or perform work of any sort under compulsion ... I remain firm by my conviction and will suffer any length of incarceration ... in preference to submitting to a violation of my principles.’9 But others, ready to accept civilian alternative service, did not escape harsh prison terms. In prison COs, along with ordinary criminals, were frequently subjected to various brutalities,10 not present usually in British jails of that time. At least one CO, ‘unable to withstand the isolation and torment of confinement,’ committed suicide.11 In the fearsome Fort Leavenworth detention barracks, COs, led by Evan Thomas, went on strike in November 1918 to protest prison conditions for COs there. After a couple of months success was gained. ‘Emboldened by this example, the entire inmate population gained a new respect for the war resisters.’12 In January 1919 a general strike at Fort Leavenworth, undertaken jointly by COs and other inmates, took place; and again the strikers met with success. Through the COs’ influence, no violence had been used by the strikers; the prison administration promised a number of reforms. (Once the COs had been released, however, the authorities reneged on these promises.) Release for American COs in jail came even more slowly than for their British counterparts. But by the end of November 1920 no more COs remained in prison. Despite the inordinately extended sentences handed out to COs, as to other military offenders, in fact no objector was kept in prison for much longer than three years. Still, more than enough time would, I think, be fair comment here! We may note that in contrast to English-speaking countries France, though the homeland of modern democracy, made no provision of any\n\nThe Great War 9\n\nkind for conscientious objectors of any sort – until the mid-1960s. Indeed, universal military service had made its first appearance with the French Revolutionary government’s levée en masse of 1792. In France almost all those who called themselves ‘pacifists’ supported the idea of national defence if la patrie was in danger. The egalitarian democracy that produced this measure did not favour the claims of a dissident antimilitarist minority. The conscript sufferings that French anarchist and anarcho-syndicalist antimilitarists – and a handful of religious pacifists, too – continued to endure over the decades are largely explained by this background.13\n\nNotes 1 Prussia (via the new North German Confederation) introduced universal military service in 1867 and the Russian Empire followed in 1874. Other countries on the European continent adopted this system at various dates during the second half of the nineteenth century. Conscientious objectors, other than the Prussian and ‘Russian’ Mennonites, were usually jailed for shorter or longer terms depending on the laws and practice of the country concerned. COs, of course, were nowhere very numerous, although some were to be found in small numbers in Russia, as well as in Germany, Austria-Hungary, Serbia and Bulgaria, Scandinavia, Switzerland, and the Netherlands. I know of only two European CO prison memoirs composed before 1914. One of them I have co-edited in an English translation, Peter Brock and John L.H. Keep, eds., Life in a Penal Battalion of the Imperial Russian Army: The Tolstoyan N.T. Iziumchenko’s Story (York, UK: William Sessions Ltd, 2001). The other memoir is also by a Tolstoyan, this time a Slovak medical doctor named Albert Škarvan, who, after induction into the Austro-Hungarian army, refused further service on grounds of conscience. He published his prison memoir in Russian and Slovak versions. For an abridged English version of this work, see Peter Brock, ed., Life in an Austro-Hungarian Military Prison: The Slovak Tolstoyan Dr. Albert Škarvan’s Story (Syracuse: Syracuse University Press, 2002). 2 For Quaker absolutist COs, see Thomas C. Kennedy, British Quakerism, 1860–1920: The Transformation of a Religious Community (Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 2001), 1–3, 9, 329–40, 348–56, 366. Chapters 7, and 9–11 are invaluable for the study of Quaker pacifism in the early twentieth century. 3 See Constance Braithwaite, Conscientious Objection to Various Compul-\n\n10\n\n‘These Strange Criminals’\n\nsions under British Law (York, UK: William Sessions Ltd, 1995), 147–56 (‘The Fate of the Law-Breakers’). For background, reference may also be made to John Rae, Conscience and Politics: The British Government and the Conscientious Objector to Military Service, 1916–1919 (London: Oxford University Press, 1970) and David Boulton, Objection Overruled (London: MacGibbon and Kee, 1967). Rae is critical of some of the assertions found in the classic treatment by the Quaker John W. Graham, Conscription and Conscience: A History, 1916–1919 (London: George Allen and Unwin, 1922), whereas Boulton follows Graham’s interpretation fairly closely. A new approach to the study of COs and antiwarism in First World War Britain can be found in Cyril Pearce, Comrades in Conscience: The Story of an English Community’s Opposition to the Great War (London: Francis Boutle, 2001). The community dealt with here is left-wing Huddersfield. Pearce stresses ‘the importance of the local experience and ... perspectives anchored firmly outside London’ (p. 25) and calls for the revision of previous views on the subject. Another very useful addition to the literature, though also covering a restricted field, is David Rubinstein, York Friends and the Great War, Borthwick Paper no. 96 (Borthwick Institute of Historical Research, University of York, 1999), esp. 17–20. ‘The Quakers were usually recognized as genuine pacifists ... The tribunals had more difficulty with lesser known sects ... and even more trouble with members of groups (like the Wesleyans ...) who did not go along with ... their church’ in support of the war – and especially with non-religious objectors.

Hennacy had entered prison an anarchist atheist not a pacifist. In prison, ‘locked up ... in solitary,’ he read the New Testament for the first time since childhood; the Sermon on the Mount converted him to Christian pacifism. Hennacy became a Catholic in 1952.

The antimilitarist réfractaire Louis Lecoin (1888–1971), who devoted almost the whole of his adult life to the struggle for peace, has left an account of his time in prison as a First World War CO. See Louis Lecoin, De prison en prison (Antony-Seine, published by the author, 1947), 87–94, 96–105 (also found in another version of his autobiography, self-published in Paris under the title Le cours d’une vie, in 1965). Clearly, conditions in the military prisons in which Lecoin was incarcerated outdid in horror those existing in the jails where British and Americans COs were lodged. The United States might have its Alcatraz, but after all Devil’s Island was French! Lecoin was finally released from prison a couple of years after the armistice.\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nBritain\n\nSTEPHEN HOBHOUSE\n\nIn the First World War, imprisoned COs in British jails had a rough time. Indeed, they were not singled out for especially harsh treatment; towards the end of the war the government even conceded them a few privileges not granted to common criminals. Still, despite some recent reforms, conditions in British jails in that period reflected the severe regimen of the penitentiary system introduced some fifty to a hundred years before.1 In particular, prisoners regarded the rule of silence, dietary punishment, and the broad-arrow uniform with abhorrence. Jailed COs came to share their feelings as they had come to share their plight. After the war was over, two CO ex-prisoners collaborated to produce a lengthy and extensively researched report that constituted a devastating critique of the whole British prison system. It appeared in 1922 under the title English Prisons Today. Its joint authors were the saintly Quaker Stephen Hobhouse and the fiery socialist Fenner Brockway.2 Their work, which was sponsored by the Prison System Enquiry Committee (not an exclusively pacifist body), initiated a new wave of prison reform, the impact of which is still felt today. Stephen Hobhouse (1881–1961) was born into a wealthy Liberal patrician family. Brought up as a member of the established Church of England, he was given a sound classical education, first at Eton College and then at the University of Oxford. As the eldest son he was expected to follow in his father’s footsteps in politics or one of the liberal professions. Instead, influenced by the prophetic writings of Tolstoy, Stephen, with the support of his wife Rosa, renounced his inheritance and adopted voluntary poverty as his lifestyle; the couple went to live in Hoxton, a slum district in East London. At the same time, they joined the Quaker Society of Friends: a move that strengthened their attachment to pacifism. Husband and wife now became active in Quaker service. When conscription came in 1916, Hobhouse, along with many other young Quaker activists, took the unconditionalist stand and, as a result, soon found himself in prison.\n\nStephen Hobhouse 15\n\nIn his pamphlet An English Prison from Within, largely reprinted below,3 Hobhouse foreshadows the critique that he and Brockway were to present in their famous report.\n\n[My] aim ... is to give the reader a record of the writer’s impressions of our prison system, and, in particular, of its moral and mental effect upon convicted prisoners. It is based upon some twelve months’ experience of prison life, of which four months were spent in a large London prison, and nearly eight months in a smaller county gaol. My offence happened to be that of ‘disobedience’ to military orders on the ground of conscientious objection to all war; but I do not wish to lay any stress on the nature of the offence, or on the justice of the two successive sentences imposed, except in so far as these considerations gave us a different outlook from the ordinary ‘criminals’ occupying the adjoining cells. We objectors to conscription were not conscious of any guilt involved in the act for which we were committed to gaol; on the contrary, we were, more or less powerfully, sustained in our endurance by a faith in the righteousness, and, in many cases, in the supremely Christian character of the cause for which we conceived ourselves to be suffering loss of liberty and a measure of persecution. Rightly or wrongly, this was our conviction, and it reacted, of course, upon our impressions of prison, and differentiated them in some important respects from those of a hardened or a penitent ‘offender.’ But the main tendencies of the system, its general effects on character and mentality, seemed to me to be sufficiently clear, and to be of a similar nature for all prisoners involved. Almost all conscientious objectors court-martialled have received sentences of ‘hard labour’ (which may be repeated indefinitely) varying from 112 days to two years; and, until the last week of my imprisonment* we were treated, with a few unimportant exceptions, in the same way as other prisoners undergoing ‘hard labour’ in the third division. At the end of 1917, a few privileges were accorded to objectors who had been at least twelve months under sentence; of these the only ones of value were the permission to have books sent in from the outside, and the provision daily of two periods of exercise, at which talking in pairs is allowed ... ... The prison system as it exists to-day, with but slight variations, throughout the British Isles ... was inaugurated during the second half * I was discharged in December 1917, as the result of the Government’s undertaking to release men suffering materially in health.\n\n16\n\nThe Great War / Britain\n\nof the eighteenth century in one or two local experiments that came to nothing; it was given a partial trial at the famous Millbank Penitentiary opened in 1816, but was only really developed in the forties of the last century, when the principle of entire separation was adopted by the Government as the result of a Commission of enquiry into the methods of American penitentiaries. During the period 1840–60 some sixty new ‘cellular’ prisons were built, beginning with the ‘model’ institution at Pentonville as we have it to-day. Only from 1877, when the Prison Act placed all gaols under the newly-formed board of Prison Commissioners, has the present uniformity of discipline held sway. Before the opening of Millbank, with its 1000, and Pentonville, with its 520 separate cells, indiscriminate herding together of offenders was the general rule. Practically, therefore, the present regime of silence and solitude is less than eighty years old. Have its results in any way justified even this term of existence? It may be premised that the usual ‘hard labour’ sentence begins with a month of strict confinement to one’s cell (apart from exercise and chapel), accompanied by a fortnight’s plank bed and other disabilities. After the first month, good conduct secures one the privilege of ‘associated’ but silent labour during part of the day. The characteristics of the system, as impressed upon me by many dreary weeks of experience, seemed to group themselves around three main heads, which I propose to illustrate successively: firstly, discomfort for the body and starvation for the soul; secondly, the attempt to crush out the sense of individuality and the instinct to serve others; and, lastly, entire absence of trust, and government by fear. These characteristics are dominant enough to give the impression that they represent the guiding objects of the system; and they seem to stamp it as essentially deterrent and punitive, without the reformative elements that one would hope to find there. As might be expected, the most obvious feature of prison is the disappearance of every kind of luxury and comfort, and the restriction of ‘supplies’ to those required to satisfy the most elementary needs of food, clothing, housing, and cleanliness. To the general principle of this the idealist can take little exception; and, though unpleasant and, in some respects, damaging to health, it need have no terrors to a man who is robust in body and determined in will. But, unfortunately, months of forced abstemiousness seem unable to kill a man’s desire for self-indulgence. We found that the solitude and monotony, combined with other circumstances, led us to devour our food with a greed of\n\nStephen Hobhouse 17\n\nwhich we should have been heartily ashamed elsewhere; and a typical inscription on doors or walls was: ‘Roll on, another week, and then I’ll have a good smoke outside.’ The insistence upon the daily cleaning of cell and utensils tends, doubtless, towards good habits; but, to one accustomed to a daily bath, the hurried weekly prison bath, and the wearing of the same underclothing day and night for a fortnight, seemed a mockery reminiscent of ‘white-washed sepulchres,’ when associated with the requirement of a constant and scrupulous daily polish of the ‘tins’ which form the cell’s chief furniture. While, however, bodily needs are cared for up to a certain point, social and spiritual needs, so essential for the purposes of reformation, are almost completely neglected. To those of us who were registered as Quakers, our fortnightly half-hour of united worship, and our fortnightly ten minutes with our visiting minister, were brief glimpses of Heaven; and other prisoners who were Catholics or Nonconformists may have had advantages of a similar kind, though far too fragmentary to be of much avail. But the usual prisoner, nominally ‘Church of England,’ is supposed to subsist entirely, as far as his soul is concerned, on three or four ‘chapels’ a week, for the most part formal and unspiritual in character, together with occasional visits from the chaplain, who, it is to be feared, usually finds that the professional nature of his appearances erects insurmountable barriers between him and the occupant of the cell. I say this while rendering an admiring tribute to the efforts which I know some chaplains make to touch the souls of their imprisoned flock. But, in the main, the system neutralises their efforts; and, in all probability, few of them understand the psychology of the prisoner’s mind. The result of this neglect of the soul – and I have more to say which will emphasise this – is well described in a letter written from a London prison by a man who is now in the second year of his sentence. ‘Men,’ he writes, ‘are animalised here. The Governor is responsible to the State for keeping the bodies of the men it sends him for the period stated. I have seen the book marked “Body Receipt Book.” It took me some time to find a fitting comparison for this well-run machine, clean and regular, but it is that we are treated as bodies without souls. The reforming zeal of John Howard surely did not intend the solitary system to become (I cannot describe it better otherwise) a human dog-kennel.’ This treatment of a man as a dog, or, by an equally apt comparison, as a component part of a machine that needs little or no attention beyond watching and oiling at fixed intervals, leads on naturally to my second\n\n18\n\nThe Great War / Britain\n\npoint. Nearly every feature of prison life seems deliberately arranged to destroy a man’s sense of his own personality, his power of choice and initiative, his possessive instincts, his conception of himself as a being designed to love and to serve his fellow-man. His very name is blotted out, and he becomes a number; A.3.21 and D.2.65 were two of my designations. He and his fellows are elaborately counted, whenever moved about from one location to another, in the characteristic machine-like way;– ‘15 men, correct,’ ‘38 men, correct’; so the warder has to report many times in the day. He is continually, of course, under lock and key, ignored except as an object for spying. When not locked up, he can hardly move a muscle except under orders. There is usually a fixed and unvarying monotony about the daily and weekly round. In default of other interests, one’s soul dwells longingly on the few incidents like the weekly bath, the weekly change of socks and towel, the daily dinner and march round the exercise-ring, that break the dulness of life. The scanty contents of one’s cell must be arranged, subject to the daily inspection, in exact uniformity with the arrangement of every other cell. This does not, it is true, apply to the evening and night-time; and it is a real satisfaction to be able to choose on which portion of one’s cement floor the bed board is to be laid down. There is an almost complete denudation of personal property, and of that sense of selfexpression and choice in things which is its chief spiritual value. The only articles that I could call absolutely my own were my spectacles, my wife’s letters, four small photographs, and two books – the Weymouth New Testament and Fellowship Hymn-book – which are allowed to Quakers. Otherwise everything is on loan, usually for short periods, until mending or washing is required, or until one is shifted to another, but barely distinguishable cell.* Still more detrimental than this more than monastic suppression of self is the deliberate removal of all a man’s opportunities to serve his fellow, to do him a good turn, to interchange thoughts and greetings with him. On a large printed card, which forms one of the chief features of the cell-landscape, there is written:– ‘Rule 1. Prisoners must observe silence. Rule 2. They must not communicate, or attempt to do so, with one another.’4 Two other keystones of the system, which appear lower down, read to the effect that no prisoner must ‘leave his cell or other appointed location without permission’; and that no prisoner may, * From a hygienic point of view, the promiscuous wearing of different articles of underclothing (often inadequately washed) is a defect that needs attention.\n\nStephen Hobhouse 19\n\n‘without express authority, hand to, or receive from, another prisoner any article whatever.’ Even apart from the specific mental injuries caused by the enforced silence, it is clear how completely these rules destroy the healthy, normal activities of human intercourse. Designed to prevent collusion and conspiracy among the prisoners, and to make it difficult for them to corrupt one another, they succeed in making courtesy, friendliness, and acts of goodwill either an impossibility or a crime. One instance, within my own experience, will give an idea of the monstrous folly of such regulations. Since April 1917, the prison rations have been severely curtailed; and there is good evidence to show that many men are suffering seriously from underfeeding. Nearly all of us constantly knew what hunger means; and an extra crust of dry bread would be to most a great prize. A friend of mine was seen by one of the warders handing to another prisoner, who, as he doubtless supposed, needed it more than himself, a piece of bread. He was reported to the Governor for breaking the last rule quoted above. (To do warders justice, I believe most of them would wink at such an offence.) And for this crime my friend had all his ‘privileges’ suspended; his term of imprisonment was prolonged by a day or two; and he was awarded three days of solitary confinement in his cell on a diet of bread and water, the cell being absolutely stripped of every movable thing except his stool and his bible. The receiver of the bread suffered a similar punishment. What are we to think of a system which treats as crimes, requited by savage penalties, acts that, outside a prison, are among the most lovable and beautiful that human life can show? It is needless to say that this prohibition of intercourse, this driving of a man back exclusively upon himself, his own defects, his own grievances, his own needs, promotes the habit of selfishnes to a most grievous extent. I found myself that almost the only outlet for the altruistic instincts was praying for others; a fine art in which, it is to be feared, the majority of ordinary prisoners have not been taught any proficiency. And prayer without scope for action is woefully insufficient. At the same time, the cruel contempt with which one appeared to be treated roused bitter and aggrieved feelings which it needed a great effort to suppress. Apart from actual brutality, harsh words sank in deep. I remember one Sunday so foggy that my small window did not admit enough light for either sewing or reading. As it happened, we had no morning chapel, and there was nothing to do except pace mournfully round one’s chilly cell. On remonstrating in the evening\n\n20\n\nThe Great War / Britain\n\nwith a friendly warder for not having given us some artificial light, he answered smilingly, ‘You aren’t worth it; it’s not a work day.’ And this rebuff chanced to come immediately after evening chapel, at which I allowed myself to get hopelessly self-conscious and irritable, because, while I was singing the Te Deum and looking round about me to get a sense of fellowship with the other faces, the warder’s harsh voice broke in with ‘Number Two Sixty-five, look to your front.’ It is a hard struggle for men to keep back bitter thoughts, when almost the only breaks to the deadly monotony are such remarks as these. There are, it is true, one or two redeeming features, which must be mentioned, so as not to exaggerate this aspect of my subject. Out of every thirty or forty men, one fortunate man, selected as ‘cleaner,’ has freedom to move about his landing and do small things for the various occupants of the cells, e.g. empty their slops and fill their water-tins, and assist the warder in the distribution of rations. There was one such man whom I was tempted to consider something of a materialist. His philosophy of life was ‘to be honest with oneself.’ But then he told me that by being ‘honest with himself’ he meant, e.g., not putting aside one of the larger pieces of bread for his own consumption, when handing them out at meal time, although hunger sorely tempted him to do so at the expense of some other prisoner. And there are a few, but very few, other privileged occupations in prison which afford opportunities for active goodwill. Again, what I have said above as to the absence of the power of choice and the sense of possession must be qualified in two or three ways. First there is a certain amount of choice allowed as regards the library and ‘educational’ books, which may be changed weekly. Then, some outlet for one’s feelings is supplied by the possession of a slate on which inscriptions may be made and erased at one’s pleasure (though this is no real substitute for the use of pen or pencil). And – of much greater value – there are the monthly visits from the outside world, and the monthly letters in and out, which are allowed, under restrictions, after the first three months. The brightest ornaments of one’s cell are one’s little pile of books, the photographs of family and friends, of which four may be sent in, and the letters from home, for which, by a flash of rare illumination, the Prison Commissioners provide a little wooden rack. But these few exceptions do not touch the tendency of the whole system, though they represent small but praiseworthy efforts to redeem it. The vast majority of men work away mechanically at their mat-making or mail-bag sewing, and have no opportunities such\n\nStephen Hobhouse 21\n\nas those of the ‘cleaner’ or library-assistant. And I am afraid that a considerable proportion of ordinary prisoners have not learnt to aspire to any books beyond a sensational novel or magazine, and have no homes capable of acting as sources of inspiration to the monthly letter or visit. It will be readily inferred from what I have already said that prisons are characterised by an almost complete absence of trust in the honour or obedience of the prisoner; and that the warders and Governor rule not by love but by the fear which punishment and the threat to punish inspire. The regulations that hang on the wall of each cell give a portentous list of some twenty or thirty different forms of activity, for which punishment is prescribed; and the attempt to indulge in any one of these is punishable equally with the activity itself. As we were moved about to and from chapel or workshop or exercise-ring, warders were stationed at different vantage points, with the object of cutting off every effort to communicate with the next man. ‘Keep that tongue quiet or you’ll soon be having a change of diet,’ was a frequent exhortation. Every step and action is watched and spied upon. The gardening gang, for instance, has to move about as if they were roped together. Whenever one man has the smallest job in another part of the garden, e.g. emptying out some weeds or fetching some vegetables for replanting, the whole party has to down tools and accompany him; otherwise the warder in charge would be temporarily out of sight or hearing of one portion or other of his gang. The whole effect is ridiculous in the extreme, and not calculated to produce good work. Compared with this constant and wearing bondage outside one’s cell, the stern walls, barred windows, and locked door of that small chamber furnish a certain sense of freedom. But even here there is no true privacy. About once a month there is a surprise search of everything in one’s cell and of one’s clothing, to detect forbidden articles. One’s person is searched too on the return from the laundry or the garden, lest a piece of soap or a raw vegetable should be hidden there – and, in fact, so hungry were we, that I have seen many a root grabbed from the soil surreptitiously, at exercise or while gardening. Every cell door is provided with a glass spy-hole, through which the inmate can be inspected at any hour of the day or night. The warder walks about outside in soft slippers like a cat, and noiselessly slips aside the spyhole’s cover. In this way, even when one’s daily task is fully completed, one may be threatened with punishment by a harsh voice for lying down before bedtime or for standing upon one’s stool to gaze longingly\n\n22\n\nThe Great War / Britain\n\nout of the scanty and heavily-barred window – an action which exposes one to the suspicion of attempting to communicate with the man in one of the adjoining cells. The want of confidence in the prisoners is accompanied by a corresponding want of confidence in the warders. These officers are also spied upon by the Chief Warder and Governor; and such is the fear of collusion or bribery, that a warder is forbidden to engage in ‘familiar’ conversation with a prisoner, and is not supposed to say anything to him that does not bear upon his work or the prison rules. This rule is largely disregarded, but, as warders themselves have complained to me, it makes it practically impossible for them to exercise a lasting reformative or uplifting influence on a prisoner. Yet, if any one could help to reform him, it would be, not the Chaplain or Governor, but the warder, who has to supply all his needs, direct his work and control his movements. The harshness and solitude of prison make one peculiarly sensitive to any token of kindness or compassion that breaks through the machine-like routine; and I have often poured blessings inwardly upon a warder for some kindly look or word. I have heard the better warders denounce the present system as ‘tyranny’ from their point of view also, and express regret, on grounds of humanity, that they ever entered the prison service. Considering the nature of the tasks imposed upon them, it is less surprising that some of them should become harsh task-masters than that others should preserve, in spite of it all, so much of the milk of human kindness. The only criticism one can make of most warders – and that only tentatively – is that they do not relinquish a profession in which daily actions of direct or indirect harshness to their fellow-beings are inseparable from the routine of duty. I will add one little incident to show that the trouble usually lies much less with the character of the warders than with the system which they have to enforce. At one of the monthly visits allowed after the first three months of a sentence, I was given the exceptional privilege of seeing my wife, with only a long table between us, instead of through the usual double set of bars or wire gauze. One of the strictest warders was ‘taking’ the interview, and at the end my wife asked to be allowed a parting kiss. The warder bluntly refused, and the interview ended. Whereat I, knowing that other warders (in defiance, of course, of the rules) would have allowed it, forgot my principles and murmured a vicious ‘You brute!’ beneath my breath.5 But I had not long been back again in my cell and was trying to change my curse into a blessing, when I heard a key in the lock, and the tyrant of our visit came in, and,\n\nStephen Hobhouse 23\n\nin a way that indicated how deeply moved he was, begged me to believe that he felt as unhappy over the incident as we must be feeling, and that there was nothing more hateful than having the duty of ‘standing between man and wife.’ My faith in humanity was renewed. Such being the leading characteristics of the system, I will now attempt to illustrate further from my own personal experience what I regard as the most deplorable and immoral of all the rules. This is the attempt to enforce complete silence and separation upon prisoners. In the first place, this regulation, together with the absence of trust that is so conspicuous, brings to bear upon almost every prisoner an overpowering temptation to swerve more and more from the path of truthfulness and openness of conduct, and to fall into varying degrees of dishonesty, deception, and artfulness. In point of fact hardly any prisoners keep the absolute rule of silence during a single day of their term. Some warders, sensitive to the inhuman nature of the restriction, wink more or less openly at talking between prisoners, at least whenever there is no danger of a sudden invasion from the Chief Warder or Governor; but they do this at considerable risk, for they may be fined, and even discharged, for allowing conversation. On the other hand, it is practically impossible for the strictest and most dutiful warder to detect all breaches of the rule. There are brief occasions on the exercise-ring or elsewhere, when the prisoner is actually too far away from him to be overheard; more often it is due to the simple fact that the warder’s eyes cannot be turned in the direction of every prisoner at once. Talking without detection in a special kind of whisper, that will not carry more than a yard or two, becomes a fine art; as does also the swift handing of a note or other harmless article to one’s neighbour, while the warder’s attention is directed elsewhere. It is easy to imagine to what a pitch of skill the professional thief or burglar develops this artfulness. I used to watch them as we sat together in the workroom, where, at regulated intervals, some thirty of us were sewing our bags in apparent silence. Under the pressure of the cruel and unnatural restrictions nearly all of us conscientious objectors were also driven to similar forms of underhand communication. From the first, I personally took every opportunity of exchanging cheerful greetings and scraps of news with my companions in misfortune. Apart from the much-needed outlet for selfexpression, it seemed a religious duty to pass on words of cheer and interest. At one time a single brief remark could be thrown out, at another a considerable conversation, protracted probably by interrup-\n\n24\n\nThe Great War / Britain\n\ntions, might even be carried on. In this way one’s various companions gradually became distinct personalities, and one could love them and pray for them with far more reality. And one’s efforts, some successful and some unsuccessful, to communicate with different men added a spice of adventure to the monotony of the day. But gradually, as the months passed by, I felt increasingly the disloyalty to the spirit of absolute Truth entailed by the calculation and concealment without which the prohibited conversation would have been impossible. The sin against Truth was of a very subtle and excusable kind, but it was real; and one slight shade of untruthfulness led on to another of a darker hue. Words thrown out quickly and boldly, when one was momentarily out of range of the warder’s eyes and ears, might be blameless enough. But it is different when one habitually turns round to examine that officer’s location and attentiveness, before venturing a whispered remark; or when one actually contracts the habit of closely watching his eyes, and regulates one’s speech or silence in accordance with their direction at the moment, adopting involuntarily expressions of innocence when those suspicious eyes are turned upon oneself. And even when an unusually friendly warder openly winked at our whispered conversation, we were really involved in the deception, which he, by secretly allowing us to break the rules, was practising on the authorities responsible for the discipline. Some may think it ridiculous to be conscientious about such minute and excusable breaches of the code of truth, but there seems to me no doubt that their cumulative effect was to create an atmosphere of falsehood, suspicion, and dishonesty which affected adversely every one in the prison; and that, to those who had previously acquired no rooted love of truth, prison was a school of artfulness and deceit, as effective as human ingenuity could devise. In any case certain incidents, into which I need not enter here, caused me, when I had spent about eight months in prison, to decide that, cost what it might, I must once and for all break the meshes of calculating concealment in which I, along with the others, was entangled, and must make an open protest to the Governor against the inhuman rule which lay at the root of the whole trouble. The result was that, in order to prevent my carrying out my intention of talking openly to my fellow-prisoners, I was removed to a cell at a distance from the others, had a separate track to myself for the daily exercise, and spent the rest of my time, with the exception of four (or at most five) weekly periods of ‘chapel,’ in solitary confinement in my cell, where, of course, talking to other men was impos-\n\nStephen Hobhouse 25\n\nsible. On an average nearly twenty-three hours of every twenty-four were spent inside my locked door for about four months preceding my release. I was now almost completely removed from temptation to untruthfulness, but, on the other hand, I felt the full pressure of the undiluted ‘solitary’ or ‘separate system,’ as distinguished from the ‘system of silent association’ – for so they were called when first introduced. I rejected the very few opportunities that brought me within speaking range of fellow-prisoners, and was entirely dependent for conversation on the warders and the three chaplains, two Church and one ‘Quaker.’ The occasional visits of the chaplains amounted in the aggregate to fifteen or twenty minutes in the week; and the warders, though, for various purposes, they mechanically unlocked my cell door nine or ten times in the twenty-four hours, were as a rule either unwilling or too busy to listen to one’s remarks or to say anything beyond the different formulas of the day, ‘All right?’ ‘Exercise,’ ‘Empty slops!’ ‘More bags or thread wanted?’ etc.* At first, indeed, I used to treasure up remarks on some rare point of interest, which I might fire off, so to speak, as a means of relief, when the warder next faced me; but the opportunity even for this seldom occurred, and failures so depressed me that, as the weeks passed by and mental stagnation increased, I almost ceased to make the effort to address my keeper. I had a Greek Testament and other good books from the prison library, but my tasks of sewing, cellcleaning, etc., left me little time to read; and, in any case, the isolation weakened the power of mental attention, so that I seemed to have no capacity for reading beyond about an hour daily. Thus cut off from new impressions, and having no outlet for the expression of the obvious and the casual, my mind tended to become choked with trivialities and the somewhat sordid details of one’s cell life. Besides, I was in a poor state of health, and my ailments were increased by the overpowering temptation to dwell upon them. A foolish rhyme or jingle would form itself in my brain, and go on repeating itself endlessly in the most wearisome fashion. And it may be imagined that there was a weakening of one’s power of resistance to more positive temptations of evil, to complaint and bitterness, to ill-will and despair. More, however, than the restless dwelling on trivialities and the battling with temptations I dreaded the occasional appearance * This is, in actual practice, what the advocates of the regime have called association with the prison staff, insisting that it is a separate, and not a solitary system!\n\n26\n\nThe Great War / Britain\n\nof a spell of dazed vacancy of mind, of indifference to everything; for this seemed to be the prelude to the decay of mind and will, which, as I had been told by a prison chaplain, is a not uncommon result of long imprisonments. And in my case I felt that a complete physical breakdown also could only be avoided by a maintenance of my will-power unbroken; for, in the confinement of my small and often very cold cell, the measure of health that I had was dependent upon a daily regime of physical exercises and other devices undertaken often very much against the grain and with the sacrifice of much of my leisure time. That no permanent mental damage made its appearance during this last and hardest phase of my imprisonment, I attribute entirely to the spiritual equipment with which I was providentially, thanks to my past life, endowed. My principal means of salvation during this period were these: my faith in a personal God revealed in a human Christ; the practice of prayer, especially prayer for others; the habit of talking aloud to God and to my wife; the sense of the love of friends outside; the sense of the justice and holiness of the cause for which I was suffering; and the sight of the courage of my companions in that cause. I am mentioning these facts, in order to emphasise the point that I had means of resistance to the deadliness of prison conditions, which very few, if any, of the ordinary offenders for whom prisons are intended could be expected to possess. I entered prison with all the advantages of a robust philosophy of life, buoyed up by the belief that I was fighting in a good cause, and without any sense of guilt other than that which is inseparable from the Christian outlook upon the world. Yet, with all these advantages, I seem only to have just managed to preserve my mental balance up to the time of my release. I ask myself how I could possibly have survived, if I had possessed little or no faith in a spiritual world, if I had been the victim of unregulated and violent passions, if I had done things for which my conscience smote me, and over which my solitude forced me to brood unceasingly, if I had felt myself friendless, unloved, and unloving, cast out by the society to whose sins against me I imputed my own misery. It is not difficult to conceive the tortures of soul, to which the complete isolation of prison must drive an individual to whom this description might apply. And in a greater or less degree it probably applies to a large proportion of the occupants of our prisons. Some men, I suppose, are so hardened that the sensitiveness to mental torture is almost absent. But, if so, prison life does nothing to bring about the revolution which would be their only salvation, and only confirms them in their\n\nStephen Hobhouse 27\n\ndesperate condition. For other men, where penitence or the capacity for it is present, the possibility of amendment is almost removed. Man is essentially a social being; and to take away altogether the healing power of human intercourse, the opportunities for self-expression, and the possibility of doing a good turn to others, is a crime against nature, a deliberate assault upon the citadel of mental and moral life. The human brain is not proof against more than a very limited amount of mental suffering; and both common sense and the actual results of the discipline indicate that, where prison does not simply confirm a man in his hardened state of vice, it ends by breaking down his mind and willpower, so as at least to render him a useless member of society and, in the worst cases, to drive him to insanity. To sum up, the wickedness of the regime of enforced silence lies herein: if observed, it inevitably tends to produce mental as well as moral decay; if surreptitiously disregarded, it promotes a special form of demoralisation, an undermining of the standard of truthfulness and sincerity. The present method is a mixture of the two systems which competed with one another for favour in the minds of the 19th-century reformers, viz. the ‘solitary’ or ‘separate system,’ and the ‘silent associated system.’ My own experience of some months of associated labour and opportunities for stealthy intercourse, followed by four months of solitary confinement, enabled me to isolate the effects of each method. In the experience of most prisoners, the two systems, with their characteristic features, are intermingled in varying proportions, but without, I think, much loss of the evil effects of each ... In the upbuilding of a new world out of the ruins of to-day, which is the hope and desire of every patriot, the reform of our prisons will be not the least important part. If the evidence of some of those, who are passing through prisons now, may serve to establish true principles, by which these institutions may become schools of reformation instead of places of demoralisation and torture, their imprisonment, whatever its other results, will not have been in vain.\n\nNotes Source: Stephen Hobhouse, An English Prison from Within (London: George Allen and Unwin, 1919), 13–34, 36. 1 Philip Priestley, in his anthology of modern prison writings, Jail Journeys:\n\n28\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nThe Great War / Britain\n\nThe English Prison Experience since 1918 (London and New York: Routledge, 1989), 2, 3, states that, although ‘in 1895 the report of the Departmental Committee on Prisons, the Gladstone Report ... declared a policy in which “deterence and reformation” were to be the “primary and concurrent objects,” ... so far as the male adult prisoners were concerned, twenty years went by and the conscientious objectors of the First World War arrived in their hundreds at Wormwood Scrubs, Wandsworth, and other prisons up and down the country, to find regimes as harsh and as destructive in their effects on human beings as anything the Gladstone Committee had felt moved to criticise.’ My italics. Brockway included a lively account of his incarceration as a First World War CO in the two versions of his autobiography, Inside the Left: Thirty Years of Platform, Press, Prison and Parliament (London: New Leader Ltd, 1947), originally published by George Allen and Unwin in 1942, and Towards Tomorrow (London: Hart-Davis, MacGibbon, 1977). He spent time in Walton Prison, Liverpool, and the prison at Lincoln as well as three London jails – Pentonville, Wandsworth, and Wormwood Scrubs. For another version of his experiences as a CO, see The Autobiography of Stephen Hobhouse: Reformer, Pacifist, Christian (Boston: Beacon Press, 1952), 155–68, 171–5; published in the United Kingdom in 1951 as Forty Years and an Epilogue by James Clarke and Co. In his unpublished autobiography (‘Escape from Paganism,’ Library of the Religious Society of Friends, London, TEMP MSS 4-12, fol. 47), another CO, John H. Brocklesby, records the damage the silence rule did to him as a result of spending around two and a half years in prison. After release, he writes, ‘I found myself with a peculiar mental defect which was a direct result of the silent system in prison. In conversation I would suddenly become tongue-tied. I was fully aware of the idea I wished to express but the words to express it would not come ... The prison authorities allowed us to exercise our legs; also our digestive faculties at meal times, [which] were not impaired, rather the contrary. But one’s faculty of communicating with one’s fellows ... is made to rust away.’ In August 1917 Hobhouse’s aunt, Kate Courtney, and her husband, the distinguished statesman and publicist, Leonard Lord Courtney of Penwith, both of them convinced pacifists, had visited Hobhouse in Exeter Prison. Kate wrote in a privately published War Diary: ‘We went into a long bare room with a table on one side of which we sat, while Stephen came and sat on the other, and a good-natured warder sat a little way off ... I don’t know if I broke prison rules, but I kissed [Stephen] heartily coming and going. Rosa had warned me not to do so, as she had asked the warder if she might\n\nStephen Hobhouse 29 kiss her husband ... Ask a warder if I might kiss my own nephew, certainly not! So I just put my arms around his neck and gave him a good hug, and the warder like a true gentleman, looked out of the window!’ Quoted in Sybil Oldfield, Women against the Iron Fist: Alternatives to Militarism, 1900– 1989 (Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1989), 39.\n\nE. WILLIAMSON MASON\n\nSoon after the introduction of conscription early in 1916 the author of the following document, a young pacifist socialist, had received the first of three successive court-martial sentences of imprisonment for refusing induction into the army. As an absolutist, Edward Williamson Mason refused on each occasion to accept alternative service of any kind. He served his first sentence of 112 days’ hard labour in Durham Prison. In letters to a friend, dated 27 and 28 November 1916 and written soon after his release from prison in the army camp at Catterick, he gives his impressions of life in jail and discusses, too, whether COs should, or should not, accept the Home Office Scheme of alternative service under semi-penal conditions, recently promulgated by the government in an effort to clear the jails of their mounting CO population. Mason writes sensibly, but occasionally his style becomes rather stilted. Then too many clichés give his narrative an artificial flavour. Still, the letters he wrote after his release to a friend describing his prison experiences often have a vividness that conveys what these meant to a sensitive individual.\n\n... So you want to know all about my prison life? ... Prison either makes or blasts a man. It either makes him self-reliant or else it stuns him into a coma, a mental vacuity which time and habit turn into an inability to do anything except under obedience. Unless one has something self-assertive within one that thwarts the ravages of silence and isolation one will be surely damned. The sepulchral silence or reverberating noises of a prison ward seem to wrap one in an impenetrable cloak that suffocates. The banging of iron doors and gates, the jingling of keys, the heavy, measured tread of the officers as they walk along the galleries, the jangling of food tins, the clanking of the rope mill, all, all, have at first a deadening effect upon the brain. The\n\nE. Williamson Mason 31\n\ndull monotony, the weary repetition of commands, the regular meal times, the same rotation of food, and the systematic working of all departments, work their depressing ravages upon prisoner and warder alike. Initiative, self-assertion, individuality, are crimes – nay, almost impossibilities. Prison discipline enforces habits, rigid habits, of the body; and, in cases of men of ordinary mental powers, of the mind as well. It is this sub-conscious struggle between discipline and mind that embitters the first few months of a first offender’s imprisonment. But with those who can live the life of the mind, the mind gradually becomes detached, as it were, from the working of the body. The rigid discipline facilitates this process, the machinery of one’s life becomes so stereotyped that any one whose mind is active can ignore it. Slowly but surely one becomes a being of bodily habit and mental endurance and cheer – that is, if one has the necessary mental strength. The prison routine is rarely noticed, except, strangely enough, upon the one day (Sunday) when it is suspended or different from the weekday. Once the mind is free the prisoner has worked out his salvation, he has little to fear and much to hope. The pleasure of having worn away another day or week without pain or grief adds to his steadily growing stock of fortitude; the satisfaction of finding himself still undismayed, still courageous, although all alone in a cold bare cell, is an emotion which makes him swell with pride and joy. To this type of man imprisonment for a principle is the greatest blessing that can befall him. But there are other types who unfortunately commence the prison routine struggle with a determination in excess of their powers of resistance. Up to a certain point their endurance awakens admiration, they resist the gnawings and filings of discipline with apparent success. But suddenly, alas, their hard case of courage is penetrated and the soft inside ruthlessly shattered, and they pine away in a silence and despair most pitiful to see. Others, a splendid, glorious few, of whom I was not, stood firm and defiant come what might. And yet they too suffered. With some their eyes were wild, with others kindly and sympathetic, yet others were furtive and appealing for a word of sympathy and encouragement. But alas, who could give it them? Could their fellow C.O.’s, who were suffering through youthfulness and struggling for themselves? All were mere lads, unaccustomed to spiritual strife or emotional conflict, all called suddenly to face a test which might have shaken the wisdom and experience of a man of fifty.\n\n32\n\nThe Great War / Britain\n\nI hear that some of our cause call traitors those who accepted the Home Office offer of work. We who are now absolutists do not do that, we who have perhaps been fortunate in getting spiritual succour to inspire us. No, those alone who were absolutists from the first have perhaps the questionable right to call the alternativists traitors, but they do not, for they alone know through sympathy and experience what their brethren suffered. Not one of those who accepted was older than thirty, many, very many, were mere lads of nineteen or so; what can you expect from such immature material? I know you will say the question is not one of age; I submit that has a great deal to do with it. Lads, full of frolic and caprice, intense lovers of sport, conversant, in so far as it is possible to be conversant in clubs and debating societies, with modern social problems, the majority regular attendants at nonconformist chapels, I say they did well, but undoubtedly they might have done better. To make a decision requires mental strength; to carry it out, courage; to persist until the final triumph, the mettle of a martyr. I say they did well, and I only wish they had done as I did in rescinding their decision to accept alternative service. But I at least cannot blame them, I at least should understand and sympathise with them, for I was of them until you showed me the higher way. Knowing what I suffered and knowing that I should have fallen irredeemably without exterior aid, I deprecate the stigmatisation of those who fell as I fell, and had no helping hand to raise them as your hand raised me. Oh, it was pitiful to see the men who at first refused the Home Office scheme* gradually dwindle in number as, one by one, they slunk down to the Governor and asked him to write to the Home Office rescinding their decision. To see a man one day pacing the exercise yard with resolute step, steady eye, and open mien and bold, gradually, as time wore on, look as though he had been whipped and had his tail between his legs, fearing to look at you in case you penetrated his secret intention of accepting Home Office work, endeavouring to appear so as to avert or allay suspicion; oh, it was pitiful. But the furtive look was in his eyes. That was the sign of spiritual defeat, the curse of the furtive eye. At last he would slink down to the Governor, and if asked by a fellow* What is said here is of course only applicable to a certain percentage of those who accepted the Home Office Scheme. Many conscientious objectors are convinced believers in Alternative Service, and were able to accept the scheme without any conscientious scruples.\n\nE. Williamson Mason 33\n\nC.O. why he had been ‘cased’ (to be ‘cased’ is to go before the Governor as a case of disobedience or what not) he would bluster, blush, ejaculate something unintelligible and hurry away. Or he would lie a brazen lie, or give some ridiculous excuse of childish explanation; but his furtive eye betrayed him. He was under that human necessity to justify himself to himself, in order that his ego should not be affronted before itself and droop its head before the searing truth that he was not strong enough to stand the test he was undergoing. They were men to be pitied, and I sympathise with them with all my heart, but words of cheer were of no avail; they gave in and went, two by two, to Wakefield1 or elsewhere. And although we felt a pang of regret at their departure – the fall of a comrade – we were more determined than ever to go on come what might. ‘The gentleman C.O.’s,’ as we were called, walked the paradeground with a firmer and a merrier tread than ever. The fall of a comrade is a painful sight, especially when he tries to excuse his failure by brazen subterfuges. One feels humiliated at his degradation and squirms at the sight of his furtive eye ... Prison trials are mostly spiritual rather than material to a sympathetic nature. But to some the physical discomforts are predominant. How [my friend,] poor Fleckner used to complain of insufficient food, and dozens of others, too, unfortunately! The first words I overheard upon my first visit to Chapel were: ‘By gum, when I do get out I’ll eat and eat.’ Food obsessed the prisoners’ minds, and most surely were they punished for their incapacity to rise superior to the obsession. How often did I counsel Fleckner, for his own sake, not to think of nothing else but food, to try to forget it, to tighten up his trouser straps as hungry navvies do. But no, not a snatch of secret conversation but contained some reference to hunger. He certainly punished himself far more than prison need punish any man. The warning of his example, I hope and believe, was not wasted upon me. I often used to listen during the long hours of the night to the many disturbances which broke the heavy silence. The muffled boots of the warder as he went from cell to cell to peep in to see what the prisoner was doing; the delirious man suffering from hallucinations, shouting in sheer terror and despair through being alone in the dark with the horrors of his mind, screaming out to a warder: ‘Oh God, oh God, talk to me. Say anything, only for God’s sake talk to me.’ And the warder’s response, both kindly and soothing, but express-\n\n34\n\nThe Great War / Britain\n\ning inability to do anything for the suppliant. Then the groan of despair from the wretched prisoner as the warder went away and left him in his mental hell. Imagine the thrill of horror felt by a young conscientious objector who overhears all this as he lies upon his sleepless bed, his heart yearning for those he loves and overwhelmed by the thought that he must be away from home two years in a prison. Imagine further, what horror and anguish he would feel at the sight of a convict suddenly stopping near-by and clutching his (the convict’s) face until the blood ran from his cheeks because of his finger nails tearing the flesh, shuddering, sweating, bending over at the knees, gasping out spasmodically exclamations of sheer terror and despair, as the full realisation of the meaning of a two years’ sentence flooded his not too powerful mind; and then falling in a heap like a limp rag. The warders meanwhile look on with indifference, saying to the horror-stricken C.O.: ‘Oh, he’ll get over that.’ ... How horrible it is to see eyes usually submissive burst out into wild fires of passion, and the prisoner shout out, stamp, rave, and smash something in desperation at the suffocating blanket of discipline, and after the fury has passed relapse into his usual quiet demeanour. The prison system which compels youths or first offenders to witness such sights is an accursed thing, and the responsibility for hardening such men into confirmed criminals rests upon those who defend it. Some of the sights I saw I shall never forget, and had my prison clothes been a criminal’s garb and not a suit of honour, I should have left the prison a worse criminal than I entered it.
