Through innovative monographs and collections, scholars explore the intertwining relationships shared between culture and language, asking how such relations might help us better understand what it means to be human. Studies in the series are empirically grounded, conceptually critical, and theoretically aware. Language and culture are approached as embodied semiotic modeling processes inclusive of speech, sign, and social performance but not limited to observable behavior—thus encompassing social and cognitive dimensions of human experience. To promote the analysis and interpretation of language in cultural contexts and culture in linguistic constructs, the series welcomes a nonrestrictive range of linguistic approaches, using mixed methodologies to treat topics ranging from the embodied human person and evolutionary dimensions of human existence to the vast array of human sociocultural/rhetorical dynamics and speech variation practices. Semiotic, cognitive, and multimodal approaches to linguistic anthropology are particularly welcome, as are diachronic, cross-cultural, and cross-linguistic comparisons.

It is a book that only one person in the history of the universe could have written. If it were less unique, it would be less full of truth. His house may be seen from everywhere, but it is built upon four cornerstones, spelled out in the climactic chapter 6, revealing the implicit intellectual infrastructure that is alluded to throughout. The universe, knowledge of it, and communication about and within it are all fourfold: rational, natural, social, and cultural. If ever there were to be foundations for the study of communication, this would be it, drawing at once from philosophy, natural science, social science, and the humanities. This is at once a foundational vision of communication studies as interdisciplinary inquiry and a vision—of full Aristotelian grandeur—of both knowledge and the cosmos. Martin Heidegger liked to complain that modern thought only took efficient causation from Aristotle’s fourfold understanding, neglecting the much fuller architectonic structure. That is certainly not the case in this book! Look at those fourfold quadrants in chapter 6 and get lost in what Charles Sanders Peirce called “the play of musement.” Look at the table on virtue and see if you will ever think about anything the same way! Wisdom, episteme, phronesis, and techne: the four cornerstones of our condition, and of this book. Reading Communication will make you wiser, more knowledgeable, savvier, and more artful. Every page bristles with the evidence of Professor Klyukanov’s wide reading. Many of his sentences abound with profuse references to the names of other authors. It is citationally dense, a forest with both old-growth trees and a lot of brush. Or maybe it is better compared to a field whose abundant flowers have been widely sampled by busy bees to make the honey. The book\n\nx\n\nForeword\n\nis thus not only a theory of being a communicative animal embedded in community; it is a performance and demonstration of how to do it. Every claim is anchored in a history of conversation with colleagues, philosophers, and even poets. Hegel once said of his friend and rival Schelling, perhaps intending a mild insult, that he had conducted his philosophical education in public. In this case, I would take that as praise. Klyukanov opens up his mind and library and shows us the unfolding revelatory process. This book is Platonic in its ambition for cosmic wholeness, Aristotelian in its understanding of human beings as political, logos-possessing animals and of human understanding as fourfold, and Romantic in its insistence that analogy can be poetic in the most robust and ancient meaning of that term as making. But it keeps returning to the happy philosophical homeland of phenomenology and pragmatism. If communication is to build a house, these have always been exceedingly fertile fields. This is an author who loves language, the sine qua non of communication (though this book is characteristically nondogmatic in thinking about many forms, including what we still call nonverbal communication). You sense in both the frequent etymologies and the Nabokovian relish of writing in English (a second tongue for the author) a poet’s voice breaking through. Look at the treatment of the Russian word obshchezhitie, which lies at the heart of the book’s vision and is indeed hard to translate. I’d tinker with symbiosis, shared living, or even communicobiology, but in Soviet times this word could also mean a communal apartment, a hostel, or even a dorm. Here you have all the messiness of joint living, all the inconvenience and pleasure of hospitality, all the collisions and affections that pop up when different souls and bodies come into the same space and time. This term obshchezhitie captures for me the many resonances and layers of this book and even something of its form. In a term like this, you see a poet and translator at work in full wisdom, episteme, phronesis, and techne. Indeed, Professor Klyukanov recently published a Russian translation of Shakespeare’s sonnets, another act of obshchezhitie between languages. I like to think of this book and that translation as secret partners, realignments in cosmic orientation in different ways, as distinct acts of hospitality and harboring. Each work asks us to reach out to life forms we might consider alien. Or even monstrous. This is perhaps the most provocative claim of the book. Philosophy can dare to be monstrous. But monstrous here does not only mean aberrant, horrifying, or beyond the pale. This is not the Kraken, Moby-Dick, or Godzilla. Look at Figure 6.6 in chapter 6, the universe as a fourfold: Nature, Society, Humanity, and Monstrosity. One of these things is clearly not like the other! But notice the boldness of what Professor Kly-\n\nForeword\n\nxi\n\nukanov is up to: what is called monstrosity here is what philosophers from Plato and Aristotle to Kant would have called God. “That than which nothing greater can be conceived” is the famous definition of God by Anselm, the medieval philosopher. That is indeed shatteringly monstrous in the most dire and exhilarating sense! Hegel, shying away from theological language though still thinking theologically, would call it “the absolute.” Nature, Society, Humanity, and God: that’s a pretty fine fourfold. Each corner, like those of the house of communication, is monstrous (i.e., beautiful, sublime, and fracturing our lazy habits of thought). Communication is above all the effort to think freely, boldly, even monstrously. Let’s see if its readers can rise to its invitation.

That subject, labeled obchenie and derived from the word obchii (“common”), was explored by philology, linguistics, psychology, semiotics, culturology, translation studies, and so on—not by something that would be called “communication study” or “communication studies.” Later, when I became a faculty member in the Department of Communication Studies in the United States, I discovered that I had been studying communication most of my academic life—like Molière’s Monsieur Jourdain, who had been speaking prose all his life and didn’t even know it. Today, kommunikatsiya—another word meaning “common”—is a widespread label in Russian academia, found in the names of departments, curricula offerings, problematics of scientific conferences, areas of research, and ever-growing publications. Influenced to a large degree by how communication is theorized, researched, and taught in western, especially English-speaking countries, the area of “communication study” or “communication studies” in Russia—often, but not always, called kommunikativistika—has also inherited the debates about its place among other disciplines, such as philology, linguistics, sociolinguistics, psychology, psycholinguistics, pragmatics, semiotics, rhetoric, and so on. Thus, I try to draw on both cultural traditions of my academic background to address the question what defines communication scholarship. While I am not one of those “communication scholars” who may “spend sleepless nights pondering ontological matters” (Waisbord 2019: 122), I have given this question much thought, the results of which are presented in this book. The present book continues my previous research into the nature of communication and its study (Klyukanov 2010b, 2013a, 2013b, 2017, 2019;\n\nCommunication\n\nKlyukanov and Holba 2015; Klyukanov and Leontovich 2017; Klyukanov and Sinekopova 2019) and especially the ideas expressed in my book A Communication Universe: Manifestations of Meaning, Stagings of Significance (2010a). Although the two books go hand-in-hand, that book focused on the former; this one, in its turn, focuses on the latter. The present book addresses both ontological and epistemological views on communication, beginning with the notorious identity and legitimacy crises of communication study. I argue that this is the main reason the study of communication is usually presented in metaphoric terms—Schramm’s metaphor of “a great crossroads” (1959) being, perhaps, the most famous. I try to go beyond metaphoric views in order to understand what communication is, not what it is like. To that end, the focus of this book is on the scientific study of communication (i.e., its systematic examination). Looking at how communication scholarship is presented, we notice that when it is viewed as a field of study or studies, the bounds of communication scholarship are not clearly defined; when it is viewed as a discipline, it is found “undisciplined”; and when it is as a science, it is found “insecure.” Thus, the first chapter gives an overview of the study of communication as a hundred flowers blossoming, setting out to explore both the nature of communication and how it is scientifically investigated. To determine the status of communication study in this light may seem an exercise in utter futility, and yet . . . The second chapter looks at the nature of communication in the literal sense (i.e., conceptualized from the perspectives of natural science in terms of processes and interactions of matter and energy). Special attention is paid to the body and the brain as its most complex organ. Both spatial and temporal aspects of communication as a natural object are discussed. It is argued that any research into the physiological, physical, chemical, biological, and neurological aspects of communication, regardless of its publication outlet and “ownership,” should be considered legitimate if it is focused on the empirical study of communication as connection growing out of the factuality of sensorium bringing together humans and nonhumans—everyone and everything not just in the world but of the world. Further, the chapter shows how such entanglements of different kinds of beings result in the emergence of organized structures. It is shown how such naturally occurring communication can be explained best through Conversation Analysis. While this view of communication may appear simple and devoid of depth, its importance is emphasized, for it deals with the most direct and immediate forms of establishing connection. Chapter 3 covers more familiar ground: communication as a social phenomenon. A quick overview of its conceptualization is given, from Plato and Aristotle to Compte and Mead, who put communication in the socialscientific spotlight. It is shown how the study of communication can be considered a social science due to a number of unifying themes, such as the fo-\n\nIntroduction\n\ncus on the links between individual action and social relations, importance of rules and norms, and action that lies at the basis of communication as a social process. It is noted that while modeling their approach on natural science, social scientists still seek to develop their own methodology; in this light, “the problem of the method” is specially addressed. In a similar vein, tensions between self and society, inherent in social communication, are viewed as parallel to tensions between the micro-level and macro-level manifestations of social communication. It is emphasized that such tensions cannot be resolved once and for all since they keep social communication going. Finally, it is noted that although the social study of communication is often treated as a “human science” (Geisteswissenschaften), there is more to what it means to be human. In chapter 4, the study of communication is discussed from the perspective of humanities, focusing on the manifestations of the human spirit. To distinguish it from the social science perspective that studies social actions and institutions, the humanities study of communication is treated as cultural science that is aimed at understanding what makes us human by investigating all products created by humans through various stages of history. In other words, the study of communication as cultural science investigates the process and result of cultivation—of the human, by the human. It is shown how the search for the meaning of the human spirit is carried out by investigating various expressive means of keeping it alive (rhetoric), sign processes involved in the creation of meaning (semiotics), and the overall nature of interpretation and understanding (hermeneutics). Finally, communication is presented as a process of correspondence through significant expressions; in this light, humanity remains one integral whole as long as people correspond with/to themselves as being human. Chapter 5 deals with philosophy of communication. Here, philosophy is conceptualized as a science focused on the whole encounter with the world. It is shown how communication, as a synthetic process of connecting parts into a whole, lends itself to philosophizing, which is viewed as different from communication theorizing. Several possible designations for this science are considered, and “rational science” is chosen as the most appropriate, while keeping in mind its elements of monstrosity, also addressed in the chapter. Although philosophy may appear to be divorced from life, it is argued that this is not the case, and the main “job duties” of the philosopher of communication are presented, such as critical reflection, formulating postulates that determine possible action, special attention to language, and so on. It is emphasized that, overall, the philosopher keeps vigil for experience to be unfolding in such a way that the unity of the subject (oneself) and the object (everyone/everything else) is established.\n\nCommunication\n\nIn chapter 6, the natural, social, cultural, and rational scientific perspectives on communication are brought together in one unifying framework of the semiotic square, which is a well-known means of mapping out various semantic categories and relationships between them. The chapter looks at a number of important categories addressed to this point, such as intellectual virtues, kinds of reasoning, and forms of communication activity. Each category is presented in the form of the semiotic square and discussed in more detail. It is also shown that the semiotic square is grounded in kinesthetic relationships and should not be viewed as an abstract framework detached from everyday experience. It is emphasized that the semiotic square can be seen in terms of anatomic body planes only up to a point because the fourth dimension is not a place but a realm of consciousness. The importance of this fourth position is specially noted. It is also shown how, conceptualized dynamically, every operation in the semiotic square results in markedness, which is briefly discussed. Chapter 7 takes as its premise Aristotle’s statement about Being “said in many ways.” In this light, each of the four sciences is presented as a way of saying something about communication; it is argued that each view exists only insofar as the other three are concealed in the background and can be brought to light. For instance, any study conducted by natural science is a case of social communication, including discursively formed judgments, decisions, and actions; cultural expressions and their interpretation; and philosophical reflection. Thus, it is shown how all four scientific views are interconnected; how easy or difficult it is to establish a connection between the four scientific perspectives on communication depends on the distance between them. Chapter 8 brings back the question, raised in the first chapter, about what defines communication scholarship. Several key works on that subject over the past five decades are discussed. It is shown that the question whether the study of communication is a science sui generis remains open. Hence, it is necessary to see if communication can be viewed as an object in itself (i.e., if communication scholars perceive the same object). Based on the framework of phenomenology of perception, it is discussed how the identity of any object is created by its surrounding objects; as they recede into the periphery, the main object of perception is disclosed. In that sense, it is argued that speaking of communication study as such would be possible only if it could overcome the perspectivism of experience. It is stated that, in reality, we cannot look at communication as separate from other objects and that we always deal with its manifestations, captured in the four scientific perspectives discussed in the book.\n\nCHAPTER\n\nLet a Hundred Flowers Blossom ‰Í\n\nCommunication Studies: It’s Something Else! Almost half a century ago, George Gerbner wrote that “if Marx were alive today, his principal work would be entitled Communications rather than Capital” (Gerbner 1983: 358). Of course, we can only speculate on what Marx would do or write—especially today: maybe he would work for the World Bank and write analytical reviews on macroeconomics for its Boards of Directors. Or, perhaps, he would study philosophy and the history of science, developing the ideas from his third manuscript, where he wrote: “The whole of history is a preparation, a development, for ‘man’ to become the object of sensuous consciousness and for the needs of ‘man as man’ to become [sensuous] needs. History itself is a real part of natural history and of nature’s becoming man. Natural science will, in time, subsume the science of man, just as the science of man will subsume natural science: there will be one science” (Marx 1988: 111). Again, we can only speculate on what Marx meant by “one science” and what his new work would be called; that it would focus on communications (or communication), though, is more than likely. Today, alongside “homo sapiens,” “homo faber,” “homo ludens,” and so on, “the man” is seen as “homo communicans,” “homo communicates,” or “homo communicativus”—these terms share the same root and show very clearly how the human is viewed in the twenty-first century. There is no lack of scientific attention to communication as the defining characteristic of humans. More and more scholarly journals are devoted to the study of various aspects of communication. More and more academic conferences are held to discuss various issues related to communication.\n\nCommunication\n\nNew and newer interest groups are formed within regional, national, and communication associations. Few colleges and universities can be found without a department of communication offering the whole gamut of courses—a gamut that keeps expanding. Communication is clearly an important area of study—or studies, referring to a detailed investigation or an activity of gaining knowledge. It is in this sense that Wilbur Schramm talked about the beginnings of communication study in America (1997), or the international history of communication study was presented (Simonson and Park 2016). Today, departments of communication studies are ubiquitous (even though hardly any departments of physics studies or departments of history studies exist). The broad area in academics of communication study or studies is usually presented as a field “in ferment” (Fuchs and Qiu 2018). In this light, several questions may be posed. First, can a field be in ferment, or it is more accurate to speak about “the field, fermented’” (Pooley 2016a), or, perhaps, going “from field to ferment”—the way beer-makers do? Second, can the fermentation of a field occur by itself, or does it need a specific starter set of cultures; and if so, what might be those cultures? And third, is there any fermentation timeline for the field of communication studies? In 1983, Journal of Communication published a special issue, “Ferment in the Field,” followed by two similar issues in 1993 and 2008. In a manner of speaking, these three issues can be viewed as equivalent to three stages of fermentation—primary, secondary, and tertiary—used in beer brewing. Thirty-five years after the original “Ferment” issue, yet another issue of Journal of Communication was published (Fuchs and Qiu 2018) to reflect on the past, present, and future of communication studies: this time, similar to the change from “communication study” to “communication studies,” “ferment” was replaced by “ferments”—probably to emphasize a diversity of activities in the field. This, though, takes the process of fermentation beyond its tertiary stage, and one cannot but wonder when we can see the final product. “Fermentation” in this case does not refer to the literal phenomenon of the chemical breakdown of a substance by bacteria, yeasts, or other microorganisms; rather, it is used as a metaphor for a slow and steady force for transformation (Katz 2020). A metaphor says that something is something else; there are a number of metaphorical attempts to address the status of communication study—this “muddle of a field” (Waisbord 2019: 121)—and to give it some kind of shape, if only by saying what it is like. One of the most well-known metaphors for communication research is that of “a great crossroads,” proposed by Schramm (1959). It should be noted that Schramm viewed communication research as a crossroads (cf. the discussion of communication studies at the crossroads [Timcke 2016]).\n\nLet a Hundred Flowers Blossom\n\nIn other words, it is not the field of communication studies facing a crossroads; rather, the field itself is a crossroads where “many pass but few tarry” (Schramm 1959: 8). Another spatial metaphor, albeit of a constricting nature, is proposed by Jefferson D. Pooley, who laments that communication scholars toil away in obscurity exiled to the margins of the university; as a result, our scholarship is not read because “ideas flow in, but—like the Hotel California—they can never leave” (2016a: 622). Though you can check out any time you like, you remain trapped in what at first appears inviting and tempting. Often, a more dynamic nature of the field of communication studies is highlighted. For instance, Kaarle Nordenstreng likens it to surfing (2007). While this metaphor emphasizes the ease with which researchers glide along the waves of various topics and theories, Nordenstreng sounds a concern about this “surf syndrome” because such an approach to the study of communication runs the risk of becoming superficial and devoid of depth. Once its dynamic nature is highlighted, the question becomes how far one can surf in the field, as it were. Some believe that “communication has been far too bashful and timid in its ambitions” and must boldly go “where others dare not” (Wilson 2013). Others, however, think communication scholars are like a “motley assortment of guerrilla bands that raid other disciplines for tools and texts” (Simonson 2001: 20). The field is even discussed in terms of “academic imperialism” (Waisbord 2016: 872). In the same vein, the International Communication Association (ICA) is sometimes “perceived as a colonizing academic organization that tries to shape communication scholarship around the world” (Wiedemann and Meyen 2016: 1,504). Many more metaphors of the field of communication study exist, and still many more could be created: our metaphorical vision is limited only by our imagination, and the field could be called many other things. It should be noted, however, that by viewing the field metaphorically, we inevitably acknowledge—explicitly or implicitly—its so-called status: hence we hear about “the so-called communication theories” (Deetz 2010: 41). Without denying its heuristic potential, we should go beyond viewing the field metaphorically and saying what it is like to a less figurative approach and conceptualizing what it is. To that end, the study of communication is often presented not like a crossroads or the Hotel California, but as a discipline.\n\nAn Undisciplined Discipline? It seems that to recognize it as a discipline or branch of knowledge, it is enough to simply state that “communication as a discipline has the . . . responsibility of understanding communication in its entirety” (Hornsey, Gallois, and Duck 2008: 752). Such tautological statements may be true by virtue\n\nCommunication\n\nof their logical form but shed no light on why communication is a discipline or what kind of discipline it is. Those who try to conceptualize communication along those lines cannot seem to agree on its place as a discipline, seeing it as a part of the humanities (Apel 1972; Emauel 2007), social sciences (Vroons 2005), or “as a practical discipline insofar as it effectively marshals its available institutional and intellectual resources to address ‘problems of communication’ in society” (Craig 2008: 8). It is no surprise that numerous dissenters have emerged, given the lack of agreement on the place of communication study among those who view it as a discipline. Where for some “undisciplined knowledge and hospitality to multiple disciplines sound fine” (Waisbord 2019: 150), for others this is not the case. It is noted that “if communication studies is a discipline, it should periodically discipline itself ” (Simonson 2001: 20; Kane 2016). In the same vein, “the undisciplinary nature of the field of communication” (Shepherd 1993: 84) is emphasized. Stuart Hall believes constituting communication as a self-sustaining, disciplinary specialty is an “altogether misguided attempt” (Hall 1989: 43). Davis Swanson echoes this view, stating that “it is not a discipline, at least not in any traditional sense, and it will be helpful to discard the contrary view once and for all” (Swanson 1993: 169). Overall, the case of communication studies is considered particularly remarkable, “even amid the chaos of the disciplines” (Waisbord 2019: 122). Moreover, “as an undisciplined discipline, communication generates disorder in the ‘disciplinary system’ and contributes to the phenomenon of ‘chaos of disciplines’” (Vlăduțescu 2013: 493). In addition to those who view it as a discipline yet cannot agree on its specific nature, as well as those who do not consider it a discipline in any traditional sense, attempts are made to ensure its legitimacy by simply declaring—in one broad stroke—the disciplinary centrality of communication studies (Morreale et al. 2000; Waisbord 2019; Wang 2011). Over the years, scholars have asserted the interdisciplinary nature of communication studies. Today, we often hear of “the almost systematic advocacy for interdisciplinarity and the consideration of communication studies as a [sic] interdiscipline” (Kane 2016: 89). Some believe the field of communication studies can be viewed as transdisciplinary, while others argue that it should be considered a “post-discipline” (Waisbord 2019). Sometimes, being recognized as a discipline does not seem to be a matter of first importance: “More important is whether it continues to provide a center of scholarly excitement, a gathering place for scholars to talk and work and publish and debate with each other and to piece together their ideas on understanding the nature of communication (Schramm 1983: 17). In this respect, as noted earlier, communication departments, journals, and associations keep proliferating, and numerous conferences provide gathering places for scholars to\n\nLet a Hundred Flowers Blossom\n\ntalk and share excitement over their understanding of communication. And yet, how tenable are such opinions and beliefs about the (“inter-,” “trans-,” “post-”) disciplinary centrality of communication studies? John Peters’ admission from over thirty years ago that “communication has come to be administratively, not conceptually, defined” (1986: 528) is echoed by James Anderson and Geoffrey Baym, who note that this fractured discipline is “held together not by paradigmatic coherence, but by tenuous administrative arrangements” (2004: 603). Will the tenuous administrative arrangements, propped up by various prefixes, continue to prove a center for communication studies? Or should we be concerned that a time may come in communication studies when, as vividly described by William Butler Yeats in his poem “The Second Coming,” “Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold; / Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world, / . . . The best lack all conviction, while the worst / Are full of passionate intensity”? While we are hopefully not anywhere close to such a rapture, it can hardly be unequivocally stated that nothing is rotten in the state of communication studies; whether as a field or a discipline, we must admit that it is in a state of crisis, which cannot be disguised by simply asserting its centrality or somewhat modifying its designation by adding various prefixes.\n\nA Crisis That Is Always with You As Umberto Eco has remarked, in some situations “the crisis sells well” (Eco 1986: 126). Indeed, those who cry “crisis” may do so for reasons that promise them personal benefit. They are usually seen as the “detractors—scholars who champion theory-driven studies” (Waisbord 2019: 129). Such scholars can hardly be blamed for self-serving interests; it can be recalled that in the ancient Greece, theoria meant transcending one’s particularity and abandoning oneself to something greater (Peters 2005). In this light, those saying that the study of communication is in crisis do not try to cash in on such pronouncements; rather, they call our attention to its condition. To understand the nature of this crisis, let’s consider several cases in which scholars address crises in other sciences. One of the most well-known is Edmund Husserl’s attempt to highlight “the crisis of European sciences” (1989) by showing how their empiricism, manifest in the form of facts of natural science and mathematical formulas, fell short at providing an adequate epistemology because it was divorced from life. As a way to overcome this crisis, he developed his method of transcendental phenomenology, aimed at returning to the real ground of human experience and penetrating into the essence of the nature of knowledge.\n\nCommunication\n\nAnother case is that of Michele Foucault, who also addressed the crisis in knowledge in modernity, which he set out to resolve in his archeology of the human sciences. From that perspective, the process of humanistic inquiry is based on various discursive formations operating as social technologies in different historical periods. Such technologies are set in motion when individuals question the knowledge previously held unquestionable. An example is Foucault’s analysis of the origins, history, and problems of the medical institutions and practice, presented in his lecture “The Crisis of Medicine or the Crisis of Antimedicine?” (2004). One more scholar who develops his theory as a response to a crisis of modern society is Jürgen Habermas. For him, money and power in advanced capitalist societies colonize the lifeworld and displaced communicative forms of solidarity. He proposes overcoming this crisis by applying evolutionary views to the study of forms of social communication. By establishing a connection between knowledge, language, and action, Habermas aims to recover the capacity of social theory to provide normative foundations for undistorted intersubjective communication. These three cases represent different attempts to address a crisis that is a result of an anomaly that has not been identified and cannot receive an adequate explanation within the existing theoretical framework. Each of these attempts correlates with the nature of knowledge: in the natural science (Husserl’s transcendental phenomenology), in the humanities (Foucault’s archeology of knowledge), and in the social science (Habermas’ theory of communicative action). These three cases, therefore, are examples of epistemological crises arising when anomalies are encountered that cannot be explained by the accepted paradigm of normal science: once such a crisis has been adequately addressed, a paradigm shift occurs (Kuhn 1962). In other words, “the shift is epistemological because the fundamental change is about what we consider to be the core knowledge of the system” (Stobbs 2011: 104). It is important to emphasize that when normal science is unable to solve a problem, a crisis occurs that results in a revolutionary paradigm shift and “a new normal.” It involves a change in how knowledge is structured and developed, but still within a certain scientific field that has a clear designation, such as “natural science” or “social science.” The situation with the so-called communication science is different. For example, it is sometimes characterized as “healthy eclecticism,” and yet the concept of eclecticism presupposes choice and gathering, implying not just diversity (for example, various roots of communication study), but also a unification of those roots in some new coherent framework. It is noted “that paradigmatic analysis is pervasive in the field of communication research” (Jensen and Neuman 2013: 232). Indeed, numerous paradigms coexist and continuously evolve. What may appear as a healthy situation, though, can be seen quite differently if we admit that a development of a discipline\n\nLet a Hundred Flowers Blossom\n\ntakes the form of permanent revolution or a series of constant revolutions; that way, all syntagms are proclaimed innovations while the paradigmatic structures themselves become unstable or never materialize. In this light, “the crisis cannot be disguised by calling the discipline poly-paradigmatic” (Leydesdorff 2002: 129). With that in mind, it is not surprising that some communication scholars get “a distinct impression that the discipline is experiencing a high degree of ‘methodological schizophrenia’” (Hanna 1982: 43), while others acknowledge that “the field increasingly suffers from epistemological erosion” (Donsbach 2006: 444). Many communication scholars would share the sentiment that, “to establish the centrality of a discipline, we need a dominant paradigm that can effectively guide and frame research” (Wang 2011: 1,463). Read another way, this statement means no such paradigm exists. In the same vein, when speaking on whether, as sociology or political science do, US communication research has one main journal, Jefferson Pooley states, “We have no flagship to sink” (2015: 1,253). It is not clear why we would want to sink it if we had one, or why “we are better off without a flagship” (2015: 1,248); that flagship (if it existed) would, perhaps, be better off without us. In light of the situation with the so-called “communication science,” briefly outlined above, it is quite understandable that we hear the calls “to face paradigmatic issues” and “to consider a paradigm shift” (Wang 2011: 1463). While it is easy to feel sympathetic toward such calls, it is impossible to simply will a new paradigm into existence. With its so-called “poly-paradigmatic” character, the study of communication, whether labeled a discipline or a science, may appear highly dynamic to some and shifty to others; yet it is difficult to identify an anomaly that requires a paradigm shift. Additionally, according to Kuhn, a scientific community needs to be present that accepts a certain set of knowledge and methods for solving problems—without it, one cannot speak of any paradigms. In this case, it is difficult to identify the boundaries of such a community since it is difficult to think of a topic that would not relate to communication in one way or another. It is easy to create yet another interest group within a communication association, and the number of presenters at communication conventions is limited, it seems, only by the size of meeting rooms. All this can hardly be considered normal. The crisis of communication study, thus, is not a result of an anomaly that could not be adequately addressed by normal science; rather, it is a result of a lack of what can be considered normal science, in the first place. We may have always been “inter-” or “trans-” or “post-disciplinary,” but we have never been normal. The disciplinary crisis of communication studies is sometimes explained by the fact that it has “too much geography and too little history” (Peters 2012: 500). Here, the term “geography” is meant to indicate the discipline’s conceptual territory (i.e., trying to cover too much ground). Today, by add-\n\nCommunication\n\ning communication theories from various places around the globe, geography takes on its literal—spatial—meaning. While certainly a welcome trend, academic globalization does not make the task of theorizing communication any easier: conceptualizing communication in terms of so much geography—in fact, the entire globe—requires time. And, although contemplating communication has a long history, going back at least to Aristotle’s Rhetoric, it has a short past as a field trying to specify its unique perspective (Schramm 1983) and to establish its disciplinary status (Pooley 2016b). In light of “the perennial fragmentation and hyper-specialization of communication studies” (Waisbord 2019: 8), we hear appeals not only for a diversity of views, but also for their unity. One such appeal, for instance, has an eloquent title: Finding Birds of a Feather: Multiple Memberships and Diversity without Divisiveness in Communication Research (Stanfill 2012). Just as birds look for similar ones by their plumage, the author encourages communication scholars to strive for diversity that brings them together. Interestingly, the Russian equivalent of this English proverb—“Rybak rybaka vidit izdaleka” (“A fisherman always spots another fisherman from afar”)—captures this idea even better as it emphasizes not the joint activity (“flight”) but the recognition of similar interests by those who nonetheless remain at a distance from one another. The English expression, in its turn, arose to refer to situations where there is some danger, and it is necessary to “flock together.’” The field of communication studies, though, does not seem to face any danger from other disciplines, even of a broad nature, such as cybernetics or semiotics; its main problem is internal and consists in the necessity and inability to cope with its own legacy (Shepherd 1993). The roots of the communication studies crisis can be understood more deeply if we recall the meaning of “separation” found in the ancient Greek word krísis (“crisis”). For instance, it is noted that a crisis in philosophy manifests itself in three forms: separation of philosophers with their metareasoning from the general culture, separation of philosophers from one another, and separation of philosophers from philosophy itself (McCumber 2013). We get a rather gloomy picture of complete disunity (i.e., separation of philosophers from everything and all, including themselves). “Separation,” however, can be understood not only in the sense of alienation; “to be separate” means also “to be different from others,” and in English, these two meanings are expressed by the words “to divide,” “to disconnect,” “to set apart,” and “to distinguish.” With this in mind, the crisis of communication studies consists in their inability to distinguish themselves—as a field, a discipline, or a science—from the rest. In this light, the field of communication study can be viewed as a patient unable to understand one’s own boundaries. A series of constant revolutions, mentioned earlier, takes the form of different turns: “a turn toward social epistemology,” “a postmodern turn,” “an interpretative turn,” “a critical turn,” “a cultural turn,” “a reflex-\n\nLet a Hundred Flowers Blossom\n\nive turn,” “a linguistic turn,” “a discursive turn,” “a naturalistic turn,” and so on. If we recall that the word “crisis” goes back through the Latin language to the ancient Greek kríno,—which means not only “separation,” but also “a turning point in the course of the disease”—we can view communication study as a patient who is constantly tossing and turning, unable to find a normal state of health and calm down. All this “brings up old questions about what defines communication scholarship” (Waisbord 2019: 89). Such questions are old because the study of communication is characterized by “long-standing identity issues” (Swanson 1993: 163). Moreover, it is stated that “this identity crisis has been with us for as long as we have existed in academia” (Donsbach 2006: 439). Almost thirty years ago, John Peters stated that “the field has been in a perpetual identity crisis—or rather legitimation crisis” (1994: 133), which is still true today. However, since the latter is caused by the former, this could be rephrased as “the field has been in a perpetual legitimation crisis—or rather identity crisis”; all this in spite of “various attempts to solve the identity problem in communication sciences by providing typologies for this still rather chaotic field” (Kirtiklis 2011: 43). When we face the question of what defines communication scholarship, we should remember that “to define” means “to specify distinctly,” “to set a limit to something.” In other words, unlike the examples of epistemological crises briefly discussed earlier, the crisis of communication studies is ontological in nature (i.e., the very object of its inquiry needs to be specified and its limits established). Communication scholars may not “spend sleepless nights pondering ontological matters” (Waisbord 2019: 122), but if we acknowledge “the lack of ontological center of communication studies” (Waisbord 2019: 8), we must admit that pondering ontological matters is crucial. In this regard, “one possible starting point is to pose the question if, by ‘communication,’ theoreticians understand the same thing” (Kane 2016: 96). After all, ontology is “the scaffolding upon which structures of scholarship are crafted” (Anderson and Baym 2004: 603), and many would agree that it is “a unique foundational ontology that grants fields of study their disciplinary status” (Shepherd 1993: 91). If that is lacking, communication studies will continue to experience “methodological schizophrenia” and suffer from “epistemological erosion.”\n\nWhat’s in a Name? One can see how the identity crisis of communication studies, due to a lack of ontological center, is manifested in the problem of their designation. It is noted, for instance, that the area of communication theory “had been touched . . . in a thousand different ways long before that label appeared”\n\nCommunication\n\n(Pooley 2016b: 12). The study of communication has been conducted in many “fellow subject areas” (Cobley 1996: 31), most contributions made by philologists, linguists, psychologists, literary critics, semioticians, culturologists, and philosophers of language. When communication scholarship is compared to “a large collection of Russian dolls of nested fields and subfields” (Waisbord 2019: 121), it is difficult to see what makes communication scholarship different from other “dolls” (i.e., other fields or disciplines), testifying to the difficulty and importance of ontologizing and naming it as a distinct subject of study. Indeed, this “long-standing area of academic inquiry” (Waisbord 2019: 88) still “does not have a fully accepted title” (Vlăduţescu 2013: 493). To qualify for a specific designation, certain features or characteristics of an object need to be identified, making it possible to refer to that object. As mentioned earlier, the study of communication is characterized as an “inter-,” “trans-,” or “post-discipline.” Similarly, it is defined as “an integrative science” or “a synoptic science” (Donsbach 2006). Such broad designations, however, are deemed ontologically problematic (Kane 2016). Academic departments focusing on communication also exhibit a variety of names. An NCA analysis of 790 communication departments found a total of 116 individual department names, including Communication, Communications, Communication Studies, Communication Arts, Communication Arts and Sciences, Communicology, and more (NCA C-Briefs 2011). This list will become even longer if cognate names are added from other cultural traditions, such as the German Zeitungswissenschaft (Pooley 2016) or the Russian “kommunikativistika.” Of course, one can find in such a variety of names a “remarkable intellectual diversity” (Waisbord 2019: 11). As a result, it becomes tempting to dismiss the necessity of having one clear and accepted designation. For instance, a Russian scholar notes that while naming the field of communication inquiry is worth discussing, the debate about its title should not obscure the key issue: that the Higher Attestation Commission (a national government agency that oversees awarding of advanced academic degrees) must recognize the existence of this science and provide the opportunity to defend dissertations in this area (Dzyaloshinsky 2017). This way, a call is made to solve the legitimacy crisis by officially recognizing this area of inquiry first, and letting it figure out its name and thus solve its identity crisis second. Meanwhile, the relationship between cause and effect should be reverse: this area will be recognized and legitimized (including by the Higher Attestation Commission) only after it identifies the essential features of its object and has a distinct and fully accepted designation. The problem with naming the field cannot be disregarded: the erosion of a designation links directly to the epistemological erosion noted earlier. In-\n\nLet a Hundred Flowers Blossom\n\nstead, a designation is needed, and it needs “to provide rigor, flexibility and robustness” (Vladutsescu 2013: 498). The importance of this cannot be overstated because if something is designated a certain way, the eidetic moment of the name appears (i.e., an outline of its meaning drawn) (Losev 1993: 93). Once something is denoted in such a meaningful way, we can find the object of this designation; for example, knowing what “a tour guide” means, we can find such a person in a crowd (Stepanov 2004). Unfortunately, the area of communication inquiry cannot be found as easily as we find a tour guide in a crowd, and the more names that are used to denote “communication inquiry,” the more difficult it becomes to recognize it “in a crowded field of disciplines, fields, and post-disciplines” (Waisbord 2019: 132). At the same time, calling this area of inquiry simply “communication (studies)” does not solve the problem either, as the essential characteristics of its object still need to be specified. Stating that the study of communication focuses on the inquiry into processes of human communication does not reveal the essence of either. Any designation is a balance between how an object is signified and how it is designated; this way, one can see not only what the object is, but also its indication by the scholar as a subject. Thus, the object of physics is not physics but rather matter and general forms of its motion; the object of biology is not biology but instead living things and their interaction with the environment, and so on. In the case of communication study, the line between designation and signification is blurred, and so limiting this area (defining it) becomes problematic. On the one hand, the name for this area of inquiry is not a proper name, and so this area cannot be easily referred to without any signification. On the other hand, too many names for this area do not make it easy to signify it by limiting the class of included objects; when Schramm says, “the doors from communication open on almost every corner of human life” (1983: 16), one wonders what the corners devoid of communication might be. Thus, the name for the study of communication is not something desirable but essential: it is a sine qua non for this area, be it a field, a discipline, or a science.\n\n“An Insecure Science” So, the field of communication study is “sometimes qualified as a discipline, sometimes as an interdiscipline, sometimes as studies, sometimes as a science” (Kane 2016: 95). Qualified as a field, the study of communication enjoys a lot of freedom; after all, a “field” by definition is a broad and open expanse of land. In this light, the edges marking communication (study, studies, theory, etc.) as a field are usually difficult to determine. Once it is conceptualized as a discipline, the study of communication is expected to meet more\n\nCommunication\n\nspecific criteria, such as forming a branch of knowledge with a set of certain methods and patterns of inquiry into a defined object of study. When attempts are made to conceptualize the study of communication as a science, the stakes are higher because the classification presupposes a systematically organized body of knowledge in a given area with a distinct identity. Hence, the critical question: “What is communication science?” (Berger, Roloff, and Roskos-Ewoldsen 2010). Although numerous attempts have been made to provide answers to this question, it is admitted that “communication research . . . is the quintessential ‘insecure science’” (Pooley 2016a: 623). For the study of communication to be conceptualized as a science, rather than a field or a discipline, communication research needs to secure its place among all other sciences. When Schramm writes about the doors from communication opening on almost every corner of human life, he notes that “communication researchers can go through any of these doors” and “can make themselves at home with scientists and social scientists from a dozen other fields and disciplines” (Schramm 1983: 16)—something, undoubtedly, to be lauded. In the first place, though, communication researchers should make themselves at home with themselves. And for that to happen, the (identity and legitimization) crisis of communication studies needs to be adequately addressed. No one can deny that “it is challenging to think about communication as a science” (Hartley and Potts 2016: 632). This challenge is usually met by drawing on the traditionally accepted distinction between science and art. In this sense, for example, the study of communication is viewed as drifting “away from science and into the humanities” (Hartley and Potts 2016: 629). For example, it is discussed alongside rhetoric and cultural studies—the areas implicitly deemed outside of its scope. The study of communication is often labeled “social scientific study of communication” (Berger, Roloff, and Roskos-Ewoldsen 2010: 7). That it is modeled on natural science is clear: “For communication scientists, the problem to be solved is one of identifying and then explaining regularities by constructing and testing theories” (Berger, Roloff, and Roskos-Ewoldsen 2010: 7). At the same time, the scope of communication study is very broad; for instance, it is noted that “communication theory has most typically drawn upon the humanities and the social sciences, with occasional forays into the natural sciences” (Peters 2003: 398). When the question is posed where one turns “for the resources with which to get a fresh perspective on communication” (Carey 1989: 23), the answer should be to itself. “Scientific” is usually understood as something “empirically based, experimentally testable, and theoretically formalizable” and “assumed to be . . . exact” (Witzany 2018: 91). It is in this light that “communication science” is usually understood. However, such understanding is restrictive: for exam-\n\nLet a Hundred Flowers Blossom\n\nple, “there is nothing in its etymology to compel us to restrict . . . ‘science’ to the fields where the greatest exactitude is attainable” (Andreski 1984: 24). The term “science” goes back to both Latin and Greek words for “science,” derived from the Proto-Indo-European root *skei, meaning “to cut, split.” The essence of science, therefore, is in the idea of separating, and while it is usually distinguished from art or philosophy, science needs to be viewed first as something “cut” (different) from life. Any close inspection requires discipline, stepping away from just going about one’s life, as it were, and taking the time to examine it scientifically. One can examine something thoroughly and grasp it intellectually only if one is apart from it—the etymology of “discipline” going back to dis (“apart”) and capere (“take hold of ”). This is articulated most famously by Plato in Apology: “The unexamined life is not worth living.” Science searches for true ideas so that life is illuminated by the light of that knowledge. Plato, of course, focused on the importance of philosophical examination in one’s own life, caring about—and even craving for—virtue; hence, his phrase is sometimes translated as “The unchallenged life is the one that’s not worthy of us.” However, the old Greek verb in the statement is etazo, meaning “to inspect closely, to test,” and this applies not only to examining one’s motivation in order to live authentically, but also any scrutiny. Anything examined, be it oneself, the natural world, and so on, sheds light on life and makes it worth living. Plato’s name perhaps is not the first one that comes to mind when thinking “science”; yet he carried out a number of fundamental “splits” (see also his “Divided Line”) that underlie science as “examination of life”: the world of the world of ideas from the world of physical objects, knowledge from opinion, dialectics from rhetoric, oral speech from writing, the subject from the object. Although his sympathies are clear (the first part of each pair is unmarked), “all metaphysics, including its opponent, positivism, speaks in the language of Plato” (Heidegger 1972: 67). Thus, when speaking of “communication science,” it should be kept in mind that “what is peculiarly and technically termed Sciences, will by no means be confined . . . to the domain of such Sciences as deal with the material world, nor even to the whole range of Sciences now existing . . . . On the subject of human speculation, . . . all the cases whether inert matter or living bodies, whether permanent relations or successive occurrences, be the subject of our attention” (Whewell 1967: 3). Often, when communication scholars argue over various problems, “their very arguments over communication rely upon communication used unproblematically” (Tuckett 2014: 481). Hence, to get a fresh perspective, we need to look more critically at communication and its scientific examination, problematizing both. More specifically, just as, for example, Husserl’s transcendental phenomenology addressed the crisis by going “back to things themselves” (i.e., the life-world of subjective experiences of people\n\nCommunication\n\nfrom which scientific knowledge grows), the study of communication needs to identify what constitutes the true scientific foundation of conceptualizing communication. In other words, “finding common intellectual ground is . . . necessary to remind ourselves and tell others why communication studies matters” (Waisbord 2019: 153). Earlier, the importance of ontology as the scaffolding for communication scholarship was noted; however, the concept of scaffolding is somewhat mechanistic, and so such common intellectual ground can be better conceptualized in more organic terms as soil—something favorable to growth. Finally, it should be remembered that “crisis” is an alarming time rather than a fortunate combination of circumstances, which presents a certain opportunity that should be welcomed. “Crisis,” as noted earlier, is a critical moment in the course of the disease, and its outcome may be unfavorable; that is why such moments call for careful judgment. The identity crisis that has been with the study of communication for as long as we have existed in academia is quite a lingering moment, and a judgment may be past due. A hundred flowers can blossom year after year only if their soil does not lose its quality as a breeding ground. Otherwise, they become faded and wither away.\n\nCHAPTER\n\nThe Nature of Communication ‰Í\n\nThe Matter of the Fact The study of communication can be conceptualized from the perspective of natural science because “the sheer phenomenon of communication is, of course, natural and universal in the sense that all biological species of a certain complexity do it in some way, and every human culture has ways of doing it” (Craig 2005: 660). Communication is often studied as a biological event through communibiology. Although, as the name suggests, its focus is on communication as a biological process, communibiology draws from other natural sciences, such as chemistry, neuroanatomy, and neurophysiology, among others. The nature of communication is also explored from the perspectives of physiology, neuroscience, earth science, and so on—the sciences focused on the material universe. In fact, the natural sciences are full of consideration of the substances, processes, and interactions of matter and energy that are “central concerns and topics of communication theory” (Peters 2003: 399). Let’s look at some of these concerns and topics. All communication processes are rooted in natural elements; this applies even to the so-called “new media” (Peters 2015). It is impossible, though, to approach the nature of communication without considering “the mother of all media, the body” (Peters 2015: 187). The body draws much scholarly attention; even a special interdisciplinary field of the so-called body studies exists. The body can be thematized as a material frame (of a human or an animal) that is a stable object—“skin-bounded, . . . biomechanical entity” (Lock and Farquhar 2007: 2)—an observable and analyzable datum. Here, we encounter “a non-personal body, systems of anonymous functions, blind\n\nCommunication\n\nadherences to beings that I am not the cause of and for which I am not responsible” (Merleau-Ponty 1962: 216). So thematized, everybody—every body—can be examined and discussed in the same way so that universal principles at work can be discovered. Both humans and animals come to know the world by sensing it and drawing distinctions: here, “sensations are forced upon us . . . . Over their nature . . . we have . . . no control” (James 1907: 593). Sensations provide us with rich information about the world; that we cannot conceptualize every sensation only testifies to the richness of the stimuli we receive. It is important to emphasize that the world we come to know this way is real for everybody (i.e., there is no individual reality). This kind of knowledge, sometimes labeled “knowledge by acquaintance” (James 1890: 217), can also be called “knowledge from reality,” which is crucial for the survival of every organism—both human and nonhuman. The body is often discussed in the context of nonverbal communication, including the study of gestures, facial expression, posture and gait (kinesics), body movement through space (haptics), vocal characteristics that are not a part of the verbal language system (paralinguistics), tastes (gustorics), and smell (olfatics). These forms of nonverbal communication are based on the five main senses—what is known as “the fivefold sense classification.” All the senses at the basis of the fivefold classification of the body language are external—whether “remote” (vision and hearing) or “contact” (touch, taste, and smell). However, there is more to communication than meets the naked eye, unaided ear, or bare hand; the body as an object can be examined more deeply with the help of scientific instruments. For instance, “among the communibiological paradigm’s biggest advantages is that researchers in the field have access to the most powerful and accurate tools ever available for studying human biological systems” (Yegiyan 2017: 172). This way, the role of the body’s internal senses, such as thermoregulation and balance, comes to light. One’s temperament, for instance, depends on the density and temperature of blood flow. As warm-blooded animals, people always maintain approximately the same body temperature (36.6 degrees Celsius—98.6 degrees Farenheit). While the ability to maintain stable temperature allows humans to exploit colder climates and rise to a higher level of evolution, this requires more energy to be directed toward the vital activity of thermoregulation. That is why a person needs heat—solar heat, maternal heat, and any other heat resulting from interaction with others (read: with other bodies). Coldblooded animals do not need as strong a connection to others because if their body temperature drops below a certain level, they simply enter a state of anabiosis—temporary suspended animation or greatly reduced metabolism. It is no coincidence that “isolation calls” or “isolation behavior” are\n\nThe Nature of Communication\n\nfound primarily among warm-blooded animals, which indicates their stronger attachment to others. Cold-blooded animals that require less amounts of energy compared to warm-blooded animals can survive the absence of connection to others more easily, existing on their own, unlike humans who suffer in isolation—for example, in times of epidemics and pandemics that require social distancing. For instance, cow hugging is now considered therapeutic because a cow’s warmer body temperature (along with a slower heartbeat) can make hugging them a soothing experience (El-Beih 2020). In this light, conceptual metaphors, such as “affection is warmth,” are based on the primary physiological characteristics of the body temperature. Also, parallels can be drawn between cold-blooded and warm-blooded creatures and Marshall McLuhan’s concepts of “cool media” and “hot media,” which are also metaphoric expressions. One’s temperament is dependent not only on the body’s temperature, but also the types of liquids in the body. According to the humoral theory of temperament, commonly associated with the ideas put forward by Hippocrates and expanded on by Galen, there exist four types of liquids or humors in the body—blood, phlegm, yellow bile, and black bile—giving rise to four temperaments—sanguine, phlegmatic, choleric, and melancholic. These ideas are said to be even older, dating back to the ancient Egyptian and Mesopotamian physicians. According to Avicenna, for instance, the humors are not the liquid components in the body, but rather the chemical mixture(s) derived from various digested foods; in today’s scientific terms, yellow bile, for example, is homologous to fat (Abu-Asab, Amri, and Micozzi 2013). Whether seen as liquid components or digested foods in the body, temperament is conceptualized as a “proper mixture” or an internal balance crucial for survival and evolution. These ideas may appear simple and naïve, but they contributed to laying a foundation for the scientific method: first, human behavior came to be viewed in terms of causes and effects, and second, countless differences between people were grouped together into a typology. As a result, these ideas have been employed through the centuries; for instance, the Jesuits of the so-called Old Company (1540–1767) applied them to organizational and performance aspects of the colleges and various government positions—for example, “the ‘blood humor’ was classified as unsuitable for religious and ascetic life” (Barea 2011: 2,336). The body, therefore, is not simply an anatomical entity, but also a biochemical organism that needs food as a source of energy. The most complex organ in the body is the brain, which consumes a large amount of energy relative to the rest of the body; in this sense, “brain food” is not a metaphor since one’s brain literally runs on nutrients. The brain is often personalized; for instance, it is said to “recognize faces,” “decide when to work and when to rest,” and so on. However, as Thomas Fuchs hu-\n\nCommunication\n\nmorously notes, this is simply not the case, “for my brain is certainly not married, not a psychiatrist, and it has no children” (2018: 44). In reality, the brain’s most important function is not thinking: the brain is a control center responsible for the regulation of all body systems so they can work efficiently and remain in balance. Unlike homeostatic regulation that reflects reactive responses, the brain functions according to the principle of allostasis, serving as the integrative center for anticipatory and longer-term regulation (Schulkin 2011). The concept of allostasis is studied, for example, in relation to communication and stress (Storlie 2015), while the concept of allostatic load is found to be “particularly relevant with the research on conflict, aggression, and violence” (Knapp and Daly 2011: 108). It is noted that some hormones promote allostasis; for instance, according to preliminary research, intranasally administered oxytocin is said to improve the ability of anticipating the actions of others and facilitating cooperative behavior (Quintana and Guastella 2020). The body, while a spatially extended object with distinctive characteristics, exists in relation to other natural entities, including the Earth: the word “human” goes back to the Proto-Indo-European root *(dh)ghomon-, literally meaning “earthling, earthly being.” As geo-beings, humans cannot help but be connected to our planet itself, as well as the sun, the moon, and the stars. This connection highlights the temporal nature of the body, as demonstrated by chronobiology that reveals how the body is connected to physical (rather than cultural) geography. One such factor is found in circadian rhythms—the natural processes that regulate the body by oscillating in predictable patterns of approximately twenty-four-hour light/dark cycles coinciding with the Earth’s rotation. The circadian rhythms of the human body are determined by a combination of endogenous and exogenous factors: on the one hand, by geological processes in the bowels of the Earth’s crust, and, on the other hand, the gravitational field and solar radiation (i.e., by the rotation of the Earth around its axis, and, therefore, by a change in illumination). The circadian rhythms of living organisms do not exactly correspond to one such revolution and fluctuate within twenty– twenty-four hours (in humans they are ten–twenty minutes longer than the twenty-four-hour period); that is why such rhythms are called “circadian” (i.e., near-daily or approaching daily). In English, two special words were created to denote such a rhythm—“diurnal” and “nocturnal”—to convey the main parts of the twenty-four-hour day. Any verbal label, however, can only be an approximate designation of the natural processes themselves—in this case, the rotation of the Earth around its axis and thus the nature of light. Our body in this respect is better at communication, analogously connected to those entities with which it is naturally in sync (and can be—because of culture—out of sync).\n\nThe Nature of Communication\n\nIt should also be remembered that the body exists in the magnetic field of the Earth; we may not be able to see, hear, or taste it, but we cannot escape it. In this regard, magnetic resonance imaging could be carried out without expensive equipment—(almost) naturally—if not for the numerous noises (many of artificial—human—origin: magnetic fields created by power lines, transport systems, or electrical appliances) that distort the connection between the human and other natural bodies. As a result, special medical instruments must be used to produce a clear image of the processes and structures inside the body. Studies carried out with the help of MRI demonstrate the natural (physiobiological) basis of human communicative activity. Communication, thus, can be viewed as our synchronization with the natural rhythms of the Earth as bodies resonate with its magnetic field. It is of such synchronization that Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz wrote concerning the harmony of things in the beats or vibrations of sounding bodies at specific intervals (Leibniz 1890), anticipating future research into the effects of nonverbal synchronization on the processing and acceptance of messages. Today, such issues are also studied within the framework of biotremology (Hill et al. 2019). Studied this way, synchronization goes deeper than, for example, synchronized head nods in a conversation. By the same token, “resonance” in the Resonance Theory, used in different ways by two well-known communication scholars—George Gerbner and Tony Schwartz—to refer to a process by which a mass media message is received and interpreted based on a person’s real-world experiences, is but a metaphor, unlike the notion of resonance in neuroscience, for example, in the theory of Communication Through Coherence proposed by Pascal Fries (2015). Even described in such broad strokes, it is clear that we can learn much about communication by conceptualizing it as a natural process.\n\nBack to the Thing Itself Scholars have been actively exploring communication as a natural object. Admittedly, the field of communication studies “did not accept this view of communication with open arms” (Hickson and Stacks 2010: 267). Many scholars studying communication from the human science perspectives were critical of such research, their reactions ranging from skepticism to fear. The physicalist orientation of this approach was seen as possibly opening the door to “improving” communication by using various pharmacological drugs, especially in the area of the activity of the limbic system responsible for our emotional behavior and easily affected by psychotropic substances (Earp and Savulescu 2020). Also, many scholars feared that their conceptual territory was being invaded and colonized; if communication is\n\nCommunication\n\nan activity that can be explained in terms of natural entities and processes, then there is little, if anything, for them to research and teach. However, rather than making dismissive comments about humanists and social scientists in the field of communication, most communibiologists do their best to address critical reactions to their approach. They point out that the field of communication studies as a whole would be threatened only if all the communication process were conceptualized as biological, which is not the case (Hickson and Stacks 2010). They emphasize the fact that “communibiologically oriented scholars work toward the broader understanding of the linkages among imperatives, neurobiological processes, and behavior in a communication context” (McCroskey, Valencic, and Beatty 2001: 26). As a result, while it may not be embraced by every communication scholar, today the communibiological perspective finds its place in the field of communication studies (Infante, Rancer, and Womack 2003; Beatty, McCroskey, and Floyd 2009). Most recently, communibiology is presented, along with biopsychology, in the twelfth edition of Theories of Human Communication, by Stephen W. Littlejohn, Karen A. Foss, and John G. Oetzel (2021). While these perspectives are discussed in that textbook in chapter 3 (“The Communicator”), they could also be discussed in other chapters, for example, those dealing with the message (chapter 4) or the medium (chapter 5). At the same time, it is noted that the links between communicative behavior and biology “are actively studied outside of the communication discipline” and “most of the research remains entirely unknown to communication scholars” (Floyd 2014: 5, 15). Communication scholars resent the fact that such research is conducted and published “in journals housed in academic disciplines outside of our own” (Boren and Veksler 2011: 24), calling on everyone to make a concerted effort to publish more research in their own journals; the issue here, then, is “a focus on ownership of research that is, by definition, of and about communication” (Boren and Veksler 2011: 24). But who owns communication, and, by extension, its research? Those who publish in journals such as Brain Communications, Science and Environmental Communication, Nature Communications, or Communications Biology clearly focus on communication and have something to say about it. To quote Robert Craig, “communication is undoubtedly an important fact of nature that can be studied empirically” (Craig 2005: 660). We see traditional communication scholars studying it empirically that way, as well: two recent examples are The Handbook of Communication Science and Biology (Floyd and Weber 2020)—a volume in the ICA series (with Craig as the series editor)—and the research conducted at the Institute of Communication Science at Friedrich Schiller University in Germany. Also, traditional communication scholars publish research in “their own” communication journals, such as Communication Research, or Communication Research Reports, where most of the articles are\n\nThe Nature of Communication\n\nempirical. Surely any research into the literal nature of communication, whether or not it is published in a journal deemed “our own,” has the capacity to explain communication in deeper and broader ways. If it is published in a journal deemed “not our own,” should we disregard it? And what about the entire field of communication sciences and disorders? It can hardly be a field “outside of our own” because it, too, deals with communication in a scientific way. Through the study of disorders, not only do we become aware of the norm, but we also can take steps toward making interactions more successful between those who suffer from such disorders and those who do not, for example, in situations involving stuttering (Fogle 2019) or dementia (Rone-Adams et al 2013). Any research into the physiological, physical, chemical, biological, and neurological aspects of communication, regardless of its publication outlet and “ownership,” “reconfigures the relations between humans and animals, humans and matter, and humans and their milieu” and “helps us understand about our vital existence” (Rose 2013: 17). So, rather than looking at who publishes research and in what journals, we should focus on the ontological and epistemological foundations of the research. Ontology, which is “the scaffolding upon which structures of scholarship are crafted” (Anderson and Baym 2004: 603), within the study of communication is often implied by default, assuming we all know what is being discussed. It is noted that “ontology, whatever else it is, is usually just forgotten infrastructure” (Peters 2015: 38). We forget that communication is part of nature (i.e., the world with an intrinsic way of growth, what the earliest Greeks called “physis”). Since they considered everything as living, nature for the ancient Greeks was found in “mountain and sea, plant and animal, houses and human beings, gods and heaven” (Heidegger 2018: 67). The ancient Greek thinkers who tried to comprehend nature as “physis” were called physiologists or natural philosophers, the former focusing on the substantial properties of things, while the latter’s approach to nature was more speculative. Gradually, “gods and heaven” came to be seen as part of the metaphysical realm—something to be considered by theology and philosophy. When general natural entities and processes are identified, they are often viewed in terms of durable meaningful “sediments”; human language is an extreme case of sedimentation (Merleau-Ponty 1962; see also: Jaroš and Pudil 2020). However, it is important to conceptualize communication not simply as sedimentation (i.e., information that “settled down”) but as a matter of energy dispersion; the former is found in the mathematical theory of communication, where probabilities denote relative frequencies, while the latter exclusively focuses on the physical characteristics of communication. The latter, then, treats information as nothing but physical; in this sense, it\n\nCommunication\n\nis “the thermodynamic theory of communication” that is “self-consistent by relating all information generation, transmission and interpretation to the principle of increasing entropy” (Karnani, Pääkkönen, and Annila 2009). Human beings are part of nature—primates of the family Hominidae, the Genus Homo. It is common to acknowledge “the animal in the human”; in the words of Merleau-Ponty, for people “there is no word or behavior that does not break free from animal life” (2012: 195). This view goes back to Aristotle, who famously stated that “man is by nature a political animal.” According to this animalistic view, humans and animals share crucial functions, such as the capacity to breathe; the word “animal” goes back to the Proto-Indo-European root *ane-, meaning “to breathe.” We can understand why this function was taken as a basis for conceptualizing the animal and the human in the same way: the process of breathing can be seen with the naked eye and is ubiquitous, oxygen taken for granted. Breathing, however, as a biological process of bringing air into the lungs (inhalation) and releasing it to the atmosphere (exhalation) differs from respiration, which is a chemical process of exchanging oxygen and carbon dioxide between the cells and blood vessels; that is why breathing is also known as “external respiration.” In this regard, trees and plants technically do not breathe, although respiration does occur in them, as well as in other natural organisms. One can literally see this with the help of a dendrometer; when, for instance, Zach St. George, the author of The Journeys of Tree, saw the pumping heart of a balsam fir, he came to see it in a way unexpectedly similar to the way he was alive (see McAlpin 2020). By the same token, while not exactly light on their feet, trees move, albeit at an infinitesimal, glacial pace, and plants are also adept at traveling (Mancuso 2020). We see that in many cases, talk of plant learning and memory is not just metaphorical, but also matter of fact (Ruggles 2017). Hence “man” is by nature not only an animal, but also a tree and a plant. So, it is not that “we have never been human” (Haraway 2008)—we have never been just human. The fact that “for man, everything is constructed and everything is natural” (Merleau-Ponty 1962: 189; emphasis added) highlights the continuous nature of our involvement in the natural world. In specific situations, one or the other comes to the foreground: “sometimes, it is restricted to the action necessary for the conservation of life, and accordingly posits around us a biological world . . . . Sometimes . . . the meaning aimed at cannot be achieved by the body’s natural means; it must then build itself an instrument, and it projects thereby around itself a cultural world” (Merleau-Ponty 1962: 169; emphasis added). Even though the distinction between these two planes is abstract, it still must be drawn for scientific purposes; as mentioned earlier, the essence of science lies in the idea of separating (making a “cut”). For instance, Merleau-Ponty himself, while interested in nature and the body,\n\nThe Nature of Communication\n\nfocused mostly on human animality and was primarily concerned with how corporeality relates to consciousness; this puts his project “in a distinctly and indelibly humanistic framework” as his “transcendental claims . . . lack any direct ontological import” (see Smyth 2007: 179). He even stated that “man [humanity] is a historical idea and not a natural species” (Merleau-Ponty 1962: 170); compare this with Foucault’s view of “man” as an “invention” (Foucault 1973: xxiii)—a statement that may find a sympathetic ear, for example, in the studies of gender and ethics, but would receive little support from natural scientists. Natural science, because of its focus on the empirical study of real objects, is “prejudiced in favour of the world” (Merleau-Ponty 1962: 53)—a bias that, according to phenomenology, needs to be corrected. In MerleauPonty’s words, “the ultimate task of phenomenology as a philosophy of consciousness is to understand its relationship to non-phenomenology. What resists phenomenology within us—natural being . . . —cannot remain outside of phenomenology and should have its place within it” (1964: 178). That task was to be accomplished by bracketing out the world and overcoming the natural attitude. In essence, phenomenology aimed “to rethink ‘nature’—and thus also naturalism, the traditional nemesis of phenomenology” (Smyth 2007: 177). However, nature is “the excess of being over the consciousness of being” (Merleau-Ponty 2003: 38) and so will always remain partly outside; the only way to completely overcome nature/natural is by throwing it out with the “ism” of “naturalism.” We cannot access an “unfiltered” nature since “all corporeality is already symbolism” (Merleau-Ponty 1988: 166). But we can move away, as far as possible, from reflecting on our subjective experience, focusing instead on the significance (ontological import) of our direct contact with the natural world. This way, an explicitly nonphenomenological position can be taken, choosing its “starting point to be the objective, materialistic, third-person world of the physical sciences” (Dennett 1989: 5). This position does not aim to reveal transcendent essences of intentional experience; rather, its stance belongs to the realm of explanation and prediction of behavior and connection of all objects. This theoretical position is sometimes applied to all entities viewed on one continuum. For instance, the Intentional Systems Theory (Dennett 1989) aims to chart the continuities between all kinds of things—persons, animala, plants, clams, and even “the lowly thermostat.” According to this theory, the demand for a bright line between literal and metaphorical meaning is deemed ill-motivated—for example, deciding if an entity is seeking or “seeking”—as long as “what is going on” can be explained. Overall, in Charles S. Peirce’s words, “meaning, we have, therefore, simply to determine what habits it produces” (Peirce 1923: 43). In this light, when we read\n\nCommunication\n\nthat “meaningful interspecies relations, whether grounded in philia, eudaimonism, or politics, instead require an attentiveness both to a given animal’s needs as well as desires” (Sharpless 2016: 15), it is clear that animals here are perceived closer to humans, associated with the intentionality of the mind rather than something simply made known; were “needs and desires” placed in quotes, they would be viewed as “natural” creatures and so further away from humans. The fewer the quotes, then, the more literal (original, natural) something is perceived. The nonphenomenological position, choosing as its starting point the material world, “is perhaps not the philosophically most sophisticated one” (Reuter 1999: 82), but this is exactly the point; in fact, the less philosophically sophisticated it is (i.e., the further away from reflection) the better: the more direct its ontological import and the closer it is to the primordial ground of being. This way, we get as close as we can to the first nature, understood as “the totality of objects that can be given as primally present and that make up a domain of common primal presence for all communicating subjects . . . in the first and original sense. It is spatial-temporal-material nature: The one space, the one time, the one world of things for all” (Husserl 1989: 171). Such a position is shared by many scholars who study communication, and it does not really matter in which departments they work and in which journals their research is published. They are clearly “prejudiced in favour of the world” in the spirit of Gadamer’s understanding of prejudice as something positive, trying to pierce into “the anonymous darkness of our pre-personal natural origins” (McMahon 2015: 282). In this sense, nature can be seen as “a sort of time of sleep” (Merleau-Ponty 1968: 267). Whereas phenomenology calls on everyone to be awake in every single experience of one’s life, the natural scientific objectivity can be best achieved in a state of sleep, as it were, facing the task of going back to the unarticulated. Since the goal of phenomenology is to study phenomena—appearances of things in a conscious intentional act—its main slogan should be rephrased as “going forward to the appearances themselves.” It is when we examine communication as a natural object that we try to unbracket the natural attitude and go back to the thing itself (i.e., “the pre-subjective ground of the thinghood” [Dalton 2018: 31]—the first nature). The notion of the first nature (erste Natur) was conceptualized by Friedrich Schelling to refer to the primordial character of “the originary unity from which consciousness emerges” (Bech 2013: 172). Merleau-Ponty develops these ideas and, similar to Schelling’s view of nature as “Over-being” (Ubersein), describes it as “an abyss of the past,” which “always remains present in us and in all things” (Merleau-Ponty 2003: 38). Schelling sees nature as a universal drive to express “the pure form of our Spirit,” found not only in “the noble Form [Gestalt] which seems to have shed the chains of matter” but\n\nThe Nature of Communication\n\nalso “moss, in which the trace of organization is hardly visible” (see Gorodeisky 2019. Merleau-Ponty, as noted earlier, may not have searched for the pure forms of consciousness in the manner of Husserl, yet his approach to nature is still mostly philosophical and the thrust of his work is phenomenological: it is indicative, for instance, that nature often appears in his phenomenological engagement with paintings (i.e., artifacts). The first nature calls on us to pay attention to any traces of organization, even hardly visible, such as moss, and those visible only with the help of scientific instruments. To study communication as part of the first nature, we should take a lead from Schelling’s Naturphilosophie, focusing on Natur rather than Philosophie. This approach should be removed as far as possible from the Romantic conception of nature: just as physis is not about “gods and heaven,” the natural scientific view is not about the pure forms of Spirit. Every natural object seeks to preserve its essence, remaining itself in the process of any transformation; that is why “Nature is thrifty in all its actions,” in the words commonly assigned to Pierre Louis Maupertuis—hence the task of conceptualizing communication as something that remains constant through changes of perspective as it is observed and manipulated from any angle. It is such an invariable essence that natural-scientific thought aims to capture in the form of episteme as a comprehensive account derived from indisputable principles—“that what we know through epistêmê cannot be otherwise than it is” (Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics: 1139b). Since the Greek term physis was replaced by the Latin natura, and nature became investigated by natural science, episteme has been considered an ideal of scientific knowledge. Such knowledge explains everything and everybody “as a prepersonal adhesion to the general form of the world, as an anonymous and general existence” that “plays the role of an innate complex beneath the level of my personal life” (Merleau-Ponty 1962: 86). Such knowledge is achieved by progressing from particulars to universals (i.e., by induction). Although this way of inquiry starts with particulars, each of them is not treated individually but anonymously used for the sake of general principles. The effect of all individual dimensions (situations, persons, etc.) on communicative behavior is deemed negligible—not worth considering (Beatty, McCroskey, and Floyd 2009). In this respect, when studying communication as a natural object, general statements need to be formulated that directly reflect its regular properties that exist independently of the researcher. This goal can be best reached through observation, experimentation, and measurement; such regularities are generalized into laws, the way the “biological bases” of communication are “best explained by recourse to, some kind of covering law” (Berger 1977: 16). When induction is viewed as “the natural process by which generalities or concepts arise in our mind” (Jaroszyński 2007: 34), different opinions are\n\nCommunication\n\nfound as to who or what is responsible for this process of arising. A human researcher is usually taken as the agent behind this process, for example, “the theorist is attempting to identify (to induce) a set of generalities” (Sharrock and Anderson 1991: 157). However, the situation can be seen as reverse, for example, “the things induce us to look for the universal principles” (Marias 1967: 76). The Latin induction is derived from the Greek epagoge, translated as “to bring or lead in, or on”; here, “the leader” is not humans or things, but nature (revealing) itself.\n\n“One Same Something” How, and how far, can we pierce into communication as the natural “abyss of the past” that is “present in us”? The primordial ground prior to reflection can be found in the body. It is important to note that one can speak not only of human or animal bodies, but also bodies of plants or bodies of water, and even rocks are bodies of undifferentiated mineral matter or solid organic matter. As far as humans are concerned, the natural beginnings of communication are often found in the first parent-child interactions when “in response to the unsuccessful grasping movement of the child, there arises a reaction not on the part of the object, but on the part of another person” (Vygotsky 1997: 105). This way, the proprioceptive system develops, providing the child with information of the position of his/her body relative to the environment, which is fundamental not only for the child’s motor planning, but also his/her language development, and can be linked to later autistic-like communicative behaviors or other problems in social interaction, such as inappropriate openings (Echeverría-Palacio, Uscátegui-Daccarett, and Talero-Gutiérrez 2018). “Proprioceptive” and “in/appropriate” share the same root for a reason. Even before that starting point of interaction that can be observed with the naked eye, though, prenatal connection of the mother and the fetus is formed. In the words of Martin Buber, “the pre-natal life of a child is a pure natural association, a flowing toward each other, a bodily reciprocity” (1970: 76). To put it less poetically in terms of natural science, “molecular interactions and cellular exchanges between mother and fetus or embryo in pregnancy generate an intimate symbiosis of two different lives” (López Moratalla 2009: 303). Also, to cite Buber again, “the womb in which it [the child] dwells is not solely that of the human mother” (1999: 76), since all humans are children of the Earth. In scientific terms, this refers to, among other things, the maternal-fetal circadian communication during pregnancy as key maternal hormones synchronize daily rhythms in the fetus\n\nThe Nature of Communication\n\nto regulate gestation duration (Bates and Herzog 2020). Most natural scientists will probably agree with Buber when he says that “the longing for relation is primary” (1999: 76). This way, consciousness is developed as (being) “with knowledge” that comes from the originary unity of the thinghood—“reality’s concrete pulses” (James 2018: 39). Such direct knowledge from reality—the “knowledge by acquaintance” of which, for example, James and Merleau-Ponty spoke—is the knowledge of what kind of connection is needed for one’s existence and how far one can bear its weight so that a connection can endure. In this light, communication is the bearable weightiness of being. Thus, communication emerges out of the factuality of sensorium, “the factum brutum [i.e., brute fact] of something present-at-hand” (Heidegger 1962: 174). More specifically, it is driven by the need of orienting moving bodies in their interactions with one another so that opportunities for action, or affordances (Gibson 1986), can be established. Communication as connection, therefore, stems from a general basis of expressive movements and takes the form of gestures, bringing together humans and nonhumans. As Hannah Arendt writes, all creatures “are not just in the world, they are of the world, and this precisely because they are subjects and objects—perceiving and being perceived—at the same time” (Arendt 1978: 20). Such corporeal interconnectedness “creates meanings which are transcendent in relation to the anatomical apparatus, and yet immanent to the behaviour as such, since it communicates itself and is understood” (MerleauPonty 2003 220). This way, meaning is conceptualized as a basic capacity of differentiating a value of one’s connection to another. In this light, meaning (M) can be seen as “the relation between an organism (O) and its . . . environment (E), determined by the value (V) of E for O” (Kravchenko 2008: 80). In this light, communication is not equated with “intention” as a mental effort but encompasses any gesture of turning one’s attention to the outside. As Gregory Bateson writes, “it can be argued that all perception and all response, all behavior and all classes of behavior, all learning and all genetics, all neurophysiology and endocrinology, all organization and all evolution— one entire subject matter—must be regarded as communicational in nature” (1972: 287). For example, “ants communicate by their antennae; dogs by the pricking of their ears; and so on” (Bateson 1972: 297). In other words, meaning that is communicated through behavior can be different, a certain hierarchy of levels, which depends on the value of connection between an organism and its environment. For instance, four levels in the semiotic hierarchy can be isolated (see Zlatev 2009): the level of Umwelt with biological value; the value of natural Lebenswelt with phenomenal value; the level of cultural Lebenswelt with significational value; and the level of discourse with normative value. The last level is where norms of\n\nCommunication\n\ncommunication appear that involve conventional signs, not just habits. As noted earlier, meaning can be simply viewed in terms of habits produced (i.e., something held by dealing with the outside; the Proto-Indo-European root of the word “habit,” *ghebh-, meaning “to give or receive”). Convention, in its turn, presupposes a formal agreement,"
