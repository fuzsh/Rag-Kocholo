        "text": "In this chapter, the case of a blended university course will be described in detail. The main focus of this description will be on how some constructivist principles – such as knowledge building, active and self-directed learners, collaborative learning, communities of learners and practice - can be applied to compose the architecture of a blended university course. The course carefully integrates online activities with face to face meetings. Several educational models are also combined to guide the design of individual, small-group and collective activities able to exploit issues such as digital identities, E-Tutor, online role-play, and E-Portfolio. Principles of constructivism were always followed when setting activities and meetings. The description provided is mainly useful for teachers and educators interested in implementing a blended course with clear references to constructivist pedagogy. In addition, theoretically founded roles, tasks, and activities are outlined. The thoughtful mix of pedagogical models, online and face to face activities, individual-dyads-small group and collective learning contexts is the strongest point of this course.\n\nIndustrial Revolution 4.0 has influenced many sectors, which are now a lot changes entering to human life by the presence of information technology.The use of power and data in the massive digital technology has become unlimited caused by its development at this present time. This study is aimed at developing the appropriate blended course materials of English for Specific Purposes for students of English Education Study Program, Languages and Arts Faculty, Universitas Negeri Medan. This study is focused on ESP Blended Learning Course Materials for Students of Seventh Semester of English Education Study Program. Research and Development (R & D) design is applied through six stages, there are 1). collecting information and data, 2). data analysis, 3). new materials design based on the needs analysis, 4). experts validation, 5). new material revision, and 6). final product. The instruments of collecting data are by applying two strategies: interview and questionnaires. The results sho...\n\nThe paper describes the first experience of providing a course on the theory and practice of integrating ICT in foreign language teaching to students of the Faculty of Foreign Language and Area Studies. At the same time, the course is presented in a new format, as a combination of traditional lecturing in a classroom and distance learning, i.e. in a blended mode. Presenting the course in a blended mode immediately immerses the students into a learning environment based on ICT. Thus, they have to learn about how to use ICTs for didactic purposes by practically using them. A distance (online) learning component was introduced into the described course particularly with the view of organizing, monitoring and controlling students’ homework in the period between the face-to-face classes. It was meant to further develop their cognitive skills, their ability to think critically and independently, and their capacity to apply their theoretical knowledge to finding the solution to a practical problem: in other words, to make them acquire professional and informational competences.\n\nBlended learning is a mix of classroom, self-directed, synchronous, and asynchronous approaches designed to optimise learning outcomes. Hence, it is a combination of online learning and traditional classroom learning intended to deliver educational contents in a personalised nature. It has changed the teacher-centered approach to student-centered approach and has restructured the learner’s role, thereby re-conceptualising and revitalising learning styles. This study provides a comprehensive picture of the short online course developed and delivered while pursuing a Post Graduate Diploma in E-learning Programme of IGNOU and tries to assess the course in terms of planning, development and delivery to support the theoretical postulations. Further, the study also tries to summarise the results of the course offered in the blended mode.\n\nThe use of e-learning has been recommended at all levels of the educational system, thus in higher education as well, but it is very often reduced to downloading teaching materials from the teachers' websites. Students rarely participate in forums discussing some teaching topics, and they even less use the learning management system in their educational process (Dukic & and Madaric, 2012). Among the learning management systems, the web application Moodle, which is based on the principles of constructivism and constructionism, is particularly popular. Constructivism assumes that learning is a social process where individuals learn through interacting with other people (Pritchard & Woollard, 2010), while constructionism additionally includes correlation of knowledge and social action (Burr, 2003). To encourage students to learn through interaction, researchers conducted an action research with the attempt to explore the possibilities of initiating discussions on the network forum of the Moodle system. The research was organised within the Pedagogy course in the first year of the teacher studies during the two academic years. The most important advantages of this way of learning proved to be the freedom and flexibility of participation, the possibility of exchanging experiences and ideas, reflection and collaborative learning. Discussions on web forums have shown also certain deficiencies such as inadequate and unequal activity of all participants, the lack of connection to the discussions of other participants (monologue form of writing), the lack of criticism, too long texts, technical problems and the problem of availability of computers connected to the Internet. This research has shown that it is possible to organise a constructivist e-learning in higher education students enjoy participating in."
