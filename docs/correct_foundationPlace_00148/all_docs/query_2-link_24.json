All processing jobs under it are linearly connected by predefined processing components, which can process the inputs and generated outputs in a pipeline sequence. Its users include Apache Lenya, Daisy CMS, Hippo CMS, Mindquarry, etc. It is usually used as a data ETL tool or relay for data transfer between systems.\n\nCVE-2020-11991 is related to StreamGenerator. When using the StreamGenerator, Cocoon parses a user-provided XML. A specially crafted XML, including external system entities, could be used to access any file on the server system.\n\nRisk Level\n\nHigh Risk\n\nVulnerability Risk\n\nA specially crafted XML, including external system entities, could be used to access any file on the server system.\n\nAffected Versions\n\nApache Cocoon <= 2.1.12\n\nSuggestions for Fix\n\nThe vulnerability has been officially fixed in the new version. Tencent Security recommends you:\n\nUpgrade to the latest version (2.1.13) of Apache Cocoon.\n\nUse Tencent Cloud WAF that supports detection of and defense against XXE vulnerabilities like CVE-2020-11991.\n\nNote:\n\nBack up your data before installing the patch to avoid accidental losses.\n\nReferences"
