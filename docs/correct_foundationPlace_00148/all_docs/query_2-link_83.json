Extend the source file, and make whatever changes to that file.\n\n• If you modify any of the files that ship with Webtop, and they are subsequently updated, you will have to rework your customizations. This can be a costly and very frustrating task.\n\n•There are several application layers in the /webtop directory. • Each layer has its own configuration and UI files. In particular, each layer has an app.xml file. By repeatedly extending app.xml, we establish the hierarchy of the layers.\n\n•Applications higher in the stack have their configuration files read before files lower in the stack. Configuration files in a higher level override configuration instructions in files in lower levels.\n\n•The foundation of the application layers is the wdk layer. The wdk layer defines most of the controls, actions, and components used to create WDK applications. These application widgets are used for both desktop and web-based applications."
