Report edited by : Carlo Daffara, email: [email protected] Document page: http://guide.conecta.it Created in the context of the FLOSSMETRICS and OpenTTT EU project; project websites: www.flossmetrics.eu www.openttt.eu Cover image by Sven Geier, http://www.sgeier.net/fractals/\n\npage 1\n\nTable of Contents Introduction................................................................................................................................................3 Infrastructural software..............................................................................................................................5 ERP/CRM................................................................................................................................................23 Groupware................................................................................................................................................35 Document management............................................................................................................................46 Content management systems..................................................................................................................50 VoIP, conferencing and messaging...........................................................................................................54 Graphics and CAD...................................................................................................................................59 Desktop....................................................................................................................................................67 Engineering and manufacturing...............................................................................................................71 Vertical business applications..................................................................................................................81 Elearning applications..............................................................................................................................91\n\npage 2\n\nIntroduction This software catalog is a companion document of the FLOSS guide for small and medium enterprises prepared in the context of the FLOSSMETRICS EU project; it is based on the work of the Innov7 OpenTTT project (www.openttt.eu), that helped in the identification of needs through a large number of interviews and audits within European SMEs interested in FLOSS. Within the project we identified two main areas of interest: horizontal (expressed by companies across a wide range of industry domains, like ERP systems or security software) and vertical (specific to a single industry area, like machine maintenance). As one of the hurdles identified by SMEs in the FLOSS adoption process is the identification of suitable solution, we have collected a sample of applications in the following areas: • infrastructural software: tools and applications for the management of system and networks, security, digital identity and provision of basic services like backups and remote computing • ERP/CRM: business management, including specialized modules like warehouse management and production planning, and customer relationship management • groupware: Email, groupware, calendaring and project management page 3\n\n• • • • • • • •\n\ndocument management CMS: content management systems for web sites VoIP (voice over IP), conferencing, instant messaging graphics/CAD (computer aided design) desktop applications and platforms engineering and manufacturing related applications vertical business applications and data exchange e-learning applications\n\nThis catalog should be considered just a way to provide potential users initial suggestions, and in no way it can be considered exhaustive; the inclusion of a project should not be seen as a specific endorsement by the Commission or the FLOSSMETRICS and OpenTTT project. The text and images are from the respective projects whenever available, otherwise text and screenshots were prepared by the author. We welcome any addition and suggestion, both in terms of changes to existing descriptions and new additions. The preferred format is a half or full page text with one or two screenshots of sufficient resolution for the printed media; text should present actual capabilities of the software presented in its open source form (for software that is available in a FLOSS version and a commercial one) in the available version. Changes should be submitted to the author, at the email address [email protected] ; future versions will be released at the address http://guide.conecta.it/\n\npage 4\n\nInfrastructural software 2X terminal server http://www.2x.com 2X ThinClientServer PXES edition makes the move to thin client computing easy by delivering a solution to convert existing PCs to thin clients and centrally manage thin client devices from any vendor (HP, Neoware, Wyse, Maxspeed and more).

There are 3 modes provided: Basic, Enhanced, GUI Enhanced; Basic mode provides normal screen presentation. No extras are provided. This describes most of the emulators that I have used or downloaded and tried. Also; the tn5250 for linux falls in this category as well (Please; this is no slight on this emulator just an example for me to use without naming names. I used it until I started this project). Enhanced mode provides other functions like cursor progression, windows, continued edit fields, edit masked fields, etc... This is where Client Access falls in (and more). The GUI part comes in by manipulating the 5250 stream and painting the fields like gui constructs in windowing systems, gui looking popup windows in place of windows, painting the PF keys on the screen as buttons (hot spots) so when clicked it will send the appropriate aid key, as well as the enhanced functions described above. Among the features: • Support for non displayable characters • Hot spots for the function keys • Message Wait Notification • Attribute settings for screen/session • File transfer from host - You can export files from the host in different formats • Scripting - you can write scripts using the python language. • Spool file export - you can export spool files from the host into PDF or Text format.\n\nUntangle http://www.untangle.com Untangle delivers an integrated family of applications that help you simplify and consolidate the network and security products you need, in one place at the network gateway.

It consists of: a PIN, stored in the user's head; a small, lightweight client that encapsulates the private/public keys; and a server that stores the public keys of the client's and the user's PIN. When the user wants to login to a service, they start the client and enter their PIN, which is encrypted and sent to the server. If the PIN is correct, the account active and the encryption valid, the user is sent a onetime passcode to use instead of a static password. You can think of WiKID as 'certificates on steroids'. It is more secure than certificates because the required PIN is only stored on the server, so it is not susceptible to offline passive attacks. It is easier because user enrollment is automated and you don't have to deal with a full certiticate infrastructure. You can also compare WiKID to hardware tokens: it is much easier to implement, more extensible, yet just as secure. Stealing either the token or the PIN does you no good. You must steal both, just like a hardware token.

Compiere/Adempiere http://www.compiere.com/company/index.php http://adempiere.red1.org/ One of the most important open source ERP projects, Compiere (and the recently created fork Adempiere) are complete and sophisticated mid-tier ERP systems. Among the features: •\n\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\nStandard and Customizable Financial Reports - Generate standard financial and managerial reports including Balance Sheet, Profit and Loss, Statement of Cash Flows and many others. Additional reporting options include customizing reports with Compiere's internal report writer, data access using your choice of 3rd party report writers, or data exports for analysis in spreadsheet or OLAP tools. Comprehensive Financial Management - Compiere offers comprehensive financial management capabilities. All functional elements of Compiere are global-ready, supporting the complexities of businesses that span multiple organizations, currencies, accounting schema, tax laws and languages. Compiere enables you to customize the system to meet your needs without risking violation of accepted accounting and tax rules. Customer-specified Chart of Accounts - At the heart of every financial accounting system is a chart of accounts. Compiere ships with several charts of accounts for you to use. It also provides a streamlined process for you to continue using your own chart of accounts. Accounting Rule Enforcement - Compiere strictly enforces base accounting rules to ensure balanced accounting entries and overall system integrity. An example of a base rule is that the system will reject an entry if the accounting date is in a closed period. Tax Calculation and External Reporting - Most tax entries are created by the transaction. Compiere calculates, manages and applies multiple taxes (e.g. GST/PST) as well as local tax. Tax rules create correcting tax entries for Sales Tax and VAT systems. Compiere automates the preparation of reporting to external tax agencies. Banking Relationship Management - Compiere automates the management of your banking relationships and accounts. Compiere supports the import and export of bank statements using OFX, IFX and SWIFT\n\npage 24\n\nformats. Quotations - Compiere provides for the creation and printing of customer quotations based on general or customer specific price lists. Quotations can be made \"binding,\" in which case they reserve inventory. Quotations may also be modified at any time and can be automatically converted to a Sales Order without additional data entry. Sales Orders - A Sales Order is the \"fulfillment control document\" that is the foundation for generating Sales Order, shipment and invoicing documentation. In addition, Vendor Purchase Orders may be created automatically for the items specified on a sales order and directly shipped to the customer if appropriate. Different types of sales orders cause different business process behavior in Compiere. For example, a \"Prepaid Order\" will not allow shipments until payment occurs. A \"Point of Sale\" order assumes the customer is at the counter with the goods in hand and generates all transactions including stock decrement, invoicing, and payment through the entry of a single document. A \"Standard Order\" by comparison, will check availability before accepting the order then queue the order for fulfillment by the warehouse and then generate an invoice in the next invoice run or otherwise in accordance with the invoice rules for that customer. Compiere supports the following Sales Order Situations: Standard order, POS order, credit order, warehouse order, prepay order, RMA. Shipments - Based upon the details captured on the Sales Order, one or more shipments can be generated immediately or automatically when inventory subsequently becomes available. Compiere automatically back orders unavailable items. Compiere can be configured to allow shipments to be effected from the shipment documentation or alternatively provide for a more disciplined warehouse approach by requiring explicit confirmation of picking and/or shipment prior to the generation of invoice documentation. Confirmations can be used to manage movements of inventory from, say, a receiving area to 'put away' areas from which it then becomes available for further processing.\n\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\nOther specific functionalities: • • • • • • • • • • •\n\nproduct catalog price lists bill of materials distribution and multi-warehouse control material receipts, replenishment costing of products and services material receipts, vendor invoices CRM, sales management, customer tracking, customer profitability analysis integrated e-commerce point of sale integrated reporting\n\nSeveral extensions and plugins exist, for example the Libero manufacturing customization (adds MRP, CRP, shop floor control, capacity control) or localised master structures for individual countries balance codes.\n\nCREAM http://www.campware.org/en/camp/cream_news/ Cream is a multilingual customer relationship management (CRM) system for media organizations that features\n\npage 25\n\npowerful modules for sales automation, customer service, subscription management, incoming and outgoing email, template-based HTML newsletters, and a WYSIWYG editor.
