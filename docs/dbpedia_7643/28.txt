From Graz, we made our way to Thal, birthplace of Arnold Schwarzenegger…

– but first, a leisurely lunch beside Thalersee lake… where apparently Arnold proposed to Maria in a small row boat…

…and then… I certainly was not prepared for what we found when we reached Arnold’s childhood home…

Last I checked, Arnold wasn’t a transformer, but…..

This (below) is the house in which he grew up with his entire family occupying just the second floor – and with no electricity, and no running water…

The surrounding area seems to have changed little since he lived here…

…and now on to our next stop… The world-famous Lipizzaner Stud Farm!
