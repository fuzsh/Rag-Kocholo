        "text": "GRAZ, Austria (AP) – California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger returned to his Austrian hometown Sunday for the first time since severing official ties with the city two years ago after a flap about the death penalty.\n\nThe governor was welcomed at the airport in the southern city of Graz by friends and current and former local politicians, including Alfred Gerstl, a former leader of the upper house of parliament often described as his mentor, the Austria Press Agency reported.\n\nThe news agency reported that Schwarzenegger would attend Gerstl’s 84th birthday celebration Sunday evening. He will also visit Britain and France as part of his short European tour.\n\nSchwarzenegger, accompanied by his daughter, Katherine, and one of her friends, did not take questions from journalists and disappeared into a limousine after his welcome.\n\nThe spat between Schwarzenegger and the city began in 2005, when Graz authorities stripped the governor’s name from the city’s soccer stadium after he refused to block the execution of a convicted California gang founder.\n\nSchwarzenegger returned Graz’s highest award, its ring of honor, which was given to him by city officials in 1999. In a letter to the city two years ago, Schwarzenegger said the ring had “lost its meaning and value to me.”\n\nGraz officials also removed all references to Schwarzenegger on the city’s Web site.\n\nSchwarzenegger was born in 1947 in the village of Thal, just outside Graz, where he began his bodybuilding career. He immigrated to the United States in 1968 and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1984, but he has retained his Austrian citizenship."
