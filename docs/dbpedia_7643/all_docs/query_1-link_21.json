        "text": "Arnold Schwarzenegger's childhood home in Austria has opened as a museum.\n\nIt came as the former Mr Universe, who went on to be a Hollywood star and governor of California, turned 64.\n\nOn display at the museum are his childhood bed, a motorbike from one of the Terminator films, some of his first dumb-bells, and a copy of the desk he used as governor of California.\n\nMr Schwarzenegger left the village of Thal, near the city of Graz, in 1966, but has given the project his blessing.\n\nA plaque by the door reads \"Arnold Schwarzenegger's Birth House Museum,\" although one of the locals later told me he was born in a nearby hospital.\n\nHe lived with his family in the modest first floor flat from his birth in 1947 until 1966 when he left to pursue his dreams of winning the Mr Universe competition.\n\nIt was a humble beginning. The flat had no electricity and no running water.\n\nThe museum shows the house's original pit toilet, and a 1950s kitchen, with a washstand and jugs for collecting water.\n\nIn one of the rooms, the star's childhood bed is on display. \"This is where he first started to dream of success,\" the curator, Peter Urdl told me.\n\nIt was while he was living in Thal, that he first started pumping iron.\n\nAs well as trophies and photographs from his early days of bodybuilding, the museum also has some of his first dumb-bells.\n\nAnd it has his original home work-out machine, a pulley with weights attached which hung in a door frame inside the flat.\n\nThe museum charts his obsessive training routine and describes how his success at bodybuilding led him eventually to Hollywood.\n\nAnd it has a collection of Schwarzenegger movie memorabilia, including a Harley Davidson motorbike from one of the Terminator films and a sword from Conan the Barbarian.\n\nThe museum also has a section dedicated to his time as governor of California, including a facsimile of his desk.\n\nAlthough he lives half a world away, Schwarzenegger's exploits are closely followed in Austria.\n\nA number of his policies as governor were controversial here, including his support for the death penalty.\n\nHis name was taken off a stadium in the neighbouring town of Graz in 2005, when he rejected pleas to spare the life of a California gang leader."
