Also, the \"Butcher of Tashkent\" flies the coop.",

        "text": "No sooner had the Austrian city of Graz begun a petition to remove the name \"Arnold Schwarzenegger\" from its football (sorry, soccer) stadium than the governor of California fired off a fax. You can't use it anyway, wrote Gov. Schwarzenegger to Graz Mayor Siegfried Nagl, in German: \"In the future, the use of my name to advertise or promote the city of Graz in any way is not allowed.''\n\nThe dust-up between Schwarzenegger and his hometown is a consequence of last week's execution of death-row inmate Stanley \"Tookie\" Williams. When the governor refused to pardon Williams, a reformed L.A. gangster with high-profile defenders around the world, an anti-Schwarzenegger groundswell stirred in the Austrian Green party, and led to a motion in Graz City Council to reconsider using his name. As long as Schwarzenegger was a world-famous bodybuilder and Hollywood action star -- and lately a governor of the most populous American state -- it seems Graz and the rest of Austria were happy to post his name on buildings to lure tourists. But letting Williams die was another matter. Capital punishment is both illegal and unpopular across Europe.\n\n\"In all likelihood,\" wrote Schwarzenegger, \"during my term as governor I will have to make similar and equally difficult decisions. In order to spare the responsible politicians of the city of Graz further concern, I withdraw from them as of this day the right to use my name in association with the stadium. You will receive related correspondence from my legal counsel shortly.\"\n\nGraz is the nearest big city to Thal, the village where Schwarzenegger was born. He went to school in Graz and trained in an old gymnasium there as a teenager. When the city fathers built a new soccer stadium in 1997, they put Schwarzenegger's name on it; but ever since he was elected governor of California in 2003 local politicians have used the name as, well, a political football.\n\n\"It's an issue that commonly comes up whenever they want to express displeasure with him as governor,\" said Rob Stutzman, the governor's communications director, \"and it becomes tiresome ... You can threaten to take the name off the stadium many times, but you can only take it off once, and then it's done.\"\n\nThe earliest Graz would have considered removing the name by itself was January 19. Schwarzenegger beat them to it. He has also sent back a \"ring of honor\" awarded to him by Graz in 1999. \"Since official Graz appears to no longer accept me as one of their own, this ring has lost its meaning and value to me,\" Schwarzenegger wrote. \"It is already in the mail.\"\n\nThe \"Butcher of Tashkent\" made a flying visit to Germany for cancer treatment, but now he's gone, SPIEGEL ONLINE has learned. Uzbek Interior Minister Zokirjon Almatov, 56, is responsible for torture and other abuses in his own country, including a massacre in the city of Andijan last May, according to Human Rights Watch. But early last week he turned up in a cancer clinic in Hanover. The United Nations' special rapporteur on torture, Manfred Nowak, had called for his arrest, but German authorities were slow to react.\n\nAlmatov was in charge when soldiers fired into crowds of unarmed Uzbek protesters last May. Officials say 187 people died -- all \"terrorists,\" in the government's estimation -- but eyewitnesses and human rights groups put the toll at 500 or more. Survivors filed a lawsuit against Almatov in Germany last week, hoping to force his arrest, and the New York-based Human Rights Watch also lodged a complaint. German law allows prosecution of cases of torture and crimes against humanity regardless of where they are committed.\n\nUzbekistan was an ally in America's war on terrorism until May. But the bloody Andijan crackdown provoked an international outcry, and when Washington protested, the Uzbek government in Tashkent responded by kicking American forces out of a military base and asking NATO troops to leave.\n\nAlmatov never should have entered Germany; since May he'd been banned from the EU. Berlin has suggested it let him fly to Hanover in spite of the ban for \"humanitarian reasons\" -- because Almatov was so ill -- but critics catch a whiff of horse-trading. Germany, alone in NATO, still has permission to use Uzbek airspace, and German troops are still based in southern Uzbekistan, near the Afghan border.\n\nBerlin has invested € 9.2 million since 2002 in improving an Uzbek airport it uses as a hub in a European peacekeeping mission to Afghanistan. Former Chancellor Gerhard Schröder's government established this relationship but Angela Merkel's new administration had to renew it, in recent negotiations, to keep German troops in place. The new Assistant Secretary of Defense, Friedbert Pflüger, called the negotiations \"a great success.\"\n\nBut dealing with Tashkent comes at a price -- especially since Germany howled about recent \"torture flights\" by the United States. \"We would have preferred a quicker reaction,\" said Lotte Leicht, from Human Rights Watch, referring to Germany's slow response to the lawsuit last week. \"It's not exactly a secret who Almatov is.\""
