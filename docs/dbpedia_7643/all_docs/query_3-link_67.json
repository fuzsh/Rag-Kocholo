        "text": "But you also remember the documentary’s locations — particularly the mountains and peaks of the Austrian Alps of his childhood to Venice Beach in LA, where his biceps bulged. He is a man who has seen it all — and now we want to see it too.\n\nIt is the sort of origin story that can help to flip a narrative. The fleshing out of a lump of flesh. He is anti-Putin and Trump — picking the right enemies as in Terminator 2, when he stopped killing humans and went for evil robots instead.\n\nIn Arnold, he says sorry for historical groping and apologises for fathering a child with the housekeeper. And, well, once that is out of the way, we can get back to his uncomplicated best: fun cinema from the 1980s, derided by critics because film critics hate fun. Yet Hollywood simply does not make them like Schwarzenegger any more — maybe that is why we remain so obsessed with him.\n\nJonathan Dean\n\n1. Thal and Graz\n\nTo see Arnie’s childhood home\n\nThe world’s most famous Arnold was born in a sleepy rural hamlet near Graz, in Austria’s deep south. Tiny Thal sits amid an immaculate landscape of sub-Alpine meadows that look freshly groomed by cattle auditioning for Styria’s Next Top Heifer. His authoritarian father, Gustav, was the chief of police here, and the house where he grew up has since become the Arnold Schwarzenegger Museum (£10; arnieslife.com). Nearby Graz, Austria’s second biggest city, was the young Arnold’s first window onto the world, although it lacks the grandeur of Vienna or Salzburg. It was at the cinema in Graz in the early 1960s that he was inspired by the Hercules films, starring the bodybuilder Reg Park, which started him on a journey towards a musculature described by the broadcaster Clive James as looking like “a condom full of walnuts”. His mother, Aurelia, became seriously concerned when, instead of girls, the teenaged Arnie started to hang pictures of oiled male bodies on his bedroom wall. Stay in Graz’s imposing Hotel Weitzer.\n\nDetails Room-only doubles from £104 (hotelweitzer.com)\n\n2. Lakeland, Austria\n\nTo see where Arnie romanced Maria Shriver\n\nAlthough he rarely returned to Thal once he had moved to the US (not even for the funerals of his father and brother), he brought his future wife, Maria Shriver (John F Kennedy’s niece), back and proposed to her in a boat on Thal’s little lake. Compared with the mountain-cupped holiday lakes of Carinthia, it isn’t much more than a muddy puddle. If Maria had had the choice, she might well have opted for the romance of Wörthersee and Millstättersee, with their Italianate beau rivage villas and ultra-clean mountain water. Here, picture-book schloss hotels such as the Velden have a long tradition of hosting romancing aristocrats.\n\nDetails Room-only doubles from £323 (falkensteiner.com)\n\n3. Ötztal, Austria\n\nTo be an Arnie action hero\n\nArea 47 (named after the 47th parallel it sits on) sounds like a setting for a Terminator movie, and its tag line is equally Arnie-tastic: “Come as a person — leave as a hero” (area47.at). This adrenaline-charged complex in Ötztal offers practically every stuntable sport, both in the 20,000 sq m waterpark and climbing centre and the surrounding mountains. There are almost vertical slides, a giant swing and Austria’s highest high-rope climbing garden. Explore canyons, dangle off cliffs, become a human missile and learn to fly. So the hills are alive, not with the sound of music, but with whooping and cussing. Stay up the valley at the futuristic Aqua Dome spa hotel, which could also be part of a Terminator film set.\n\nDetails Half-board doubles with spa use from £331 (aqua-dome.at)\n\n4. Kitzbühel, Austria\n\nTo work out like Arnie\n\nArnie likes to describe himself as a farm boy done good, and his idea of paradise is a home in the hills with a hot tub and his own petting zoo, which includes Lulu the donkey and Whiskey the miniature horse, both allowed in the house. To emulate that, head for Stanglwirt, a hotel in the hills by Kitzbühel where Arnie is a regular guest, along with hosts of other celebs. Besides its resident ponies, its own herd of cattle, and loads of alfresco hot tubs, the Stanglwirt also has a 500 sq m fitness garden. Even if the man himself is not pumping iron in situ, his picture is on the wall.\n\nDetails B&B doubles with spa use from £496 (stanglwirt.com)\n\n5. Miami Beach, US\n\nTo channel extrovert Arnie\n\nArnie was in London when he was invited to a bodybuilding competition in Miami at the age of 21. He’d long set his sights on America, so he got on a plane without a backward glance. In those days (the late 1960s), South Beach’s Ocean Drive was fabulously glamorous, with celebrities and supermodels sashaying out of art deco mansions. These days it is still an extrovert place of music and every type of cuisine, along with museums and galleries. Stay at the Betsy, a South Beach classic, whose elaborate gym has Peloton-connected bikes.\n\nDetails Room-only doubles from £255 (thebetsyhotel.com)\n\n6. Muscle Beach, Los Angeles, US\n\nTo lift weights like Arnie\n\nMiami didn’t do it for Arnie, but the City of Angels most certainly did. In particular, the community of fellow bodybuilders at Venice Beach’s Gold’s Gym, where he became a leading light and where he still drops by (goldsgym.com). Adjacent Muscle Beach, also one of his stomping grounds, is people-watching at its eye-popping and biceps-bulging best, and a regular parade of eccentrics and wannabe stars strut their funky stuff along the boardwalk. There’s a giant Arnie mural behind the Muscle Beach nutrition building, and you might see the man himself passing through on his mountain bike. Stay by the sands in the light-filled Air.\n\nDetails Room-only doubles from £97 (airinvenice.com)\n\n7. Martha’s Vineyard, US\n\nTo see where Arnie got married\n\nArnie and Maria were married in 1986 (they divorced in 2021) on Cape Cod, the refined peninsula in Massachusetts celebrated for its unadulterated beaches and the upmarket island of Martha’s Vineyard. This is the weekend retreat of the Boston intellectuals, and it is also the home of the extended Kennedy clan, who must have looked askance at the over-muscled and heavily accented “Austrian Oak” knocking on their door. The couple married in the Kennedy church at Hyannis Port, and Arnie barely knew more than a handful of the guests. Among a select group of old-school hotels in typical Cape Cod style, the Chatham Bars Inn on Aunt Lydia’s Bay is the most legendary, and even has its own farm.\n\nDetails Room-only doubles from £307 (chathambarsinn.com)\n\n8. Sun Valley, Idaho, US\n\nTo ski like Arnie\n\nArnie, like most Austrians, is a seriously accomplished skier, and still pushes himself on the slopes. He’s a regular visitor to Aspen, Colorado, and was there this May for three days of high-altitude skiing. When asked why he still does it when it “wipes him out”, he shrugged. “Because it’s tough to do, especially at my age.” Aspen has other connections for him: his first movie success, Stay Hungry, was launched here in 1976. But the ski resort of Sun Valley in Idaho is his preferred personal retreat, and the location of his elaborate mountain mansion, where he drives around in a Hummer while chewing on a Cuban cigar. In Sun Valley he has skied occasionally with Clint Eastwood, also a regular of the resort. An iconic 1997 photo by Annie Leibovitz of Arnie on skis, advertising the resort, hangs on the walls of the Sun Valley Lodge, where Eastwood has stayed.\n\nDetails Room-only doubles from £261 (sunvalley.com)\n\nAndrew Eames\n\nVote for your favourite holiday companies to win spectacular prizes\n\nVote for your holiday heroes in the Times and Sunday Times Travel Awards to win fantastic prizes, including a week in the Maldives, a gourmet break in Oxfordshire and three nights at an upmarket beach resort in Andalusia.
