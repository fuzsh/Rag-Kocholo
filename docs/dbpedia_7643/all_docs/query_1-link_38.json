        "text": "Bodybuilder, Mister Universe, actor, governour, the life of Arnold Schwarzenegger cannot be summed up in one word! But before setting out in the world and becoming the most famous Austrian alive – he spend his youth growing up in „Thal“ a town close to Graz. And his birthplace now hosts the only official Arnold Schwarzenegger Museum worldwide!\n\n„Come with me if you want to live” - and see the museum ;-)\n\nWe will get to the museum by public transport (Bus 40 from „Jakominiplatz“ and Bus 48 from „Graz Gösting“ to „Thal Thalersee“). The event ends after the guided tour – so you can decide on your own how and when you want to go back. Public transport tickets are not included!\n\nIt will take us about 10min uphill from the bus stop to get to the museum.\n\nPlease be very punctual, because of the bus schedule, we won’t be able to wait for you! We would miss our connection bus which only runs every half an hour!\n\nHARD FACTS:\n\nMEETING POINT: 03:00 p.m. sharp at Jakominiplatz, in front of Bus Stop Line 40 (in front of McDonalds)\n\nSIGN-UP: during the office hours starting on the 22nd of May 2024\n\nPRICE:\n\n4€ with ESNcard\n\n7€ without ESNcard\n\nWHAT`s included: ticket and guided tour\n\nnot included:\n\ntickets for public transport from Jakominplatz to the museum and back are your own responsibility"
