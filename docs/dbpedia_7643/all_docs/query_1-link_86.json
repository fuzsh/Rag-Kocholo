        "text": "Arnold Schwarzenegger was born on July 30, 1947 in Graz Thal, the son of a gendarme. He discovered bodybuilding while he was still at school and began to train regularly at the age of 15. In 1966, he was elected \"Mr. Europe\" and in 1967 he was elected the youngest \"Mr. Universe\" in London. By 1980, he had won the title \"Mr. Universe\" five times and \"Mr. Olympia\" seven times. These successes made him one of the most important individuals in the history of bodybuilding.Schwarzenegger emigrated to the USA in 1968. In 1973, he began to study business management and economics, graduating in 1980. He acquired American citizenship in 1983, and in 1986 he married the journalist Maria Shriver, a niece of John F. Kennedy. The couple have four children. His well-trained body led him to the film industry. In his first role in 1970, in \"Hercules in New York\", his voice had to be synchronised because of his very strong accent. Schwarzenegger achieved an international reputation 12 years later with the film \"Conan the Barbarian\" (1982). Films such as \"Terminator\", \"Total Recall\", \"Kindergarten Cop\" and \"True Lies\" made him one of the highest-earning Hollywood actors. In his honour, the newly renovated Graz \"Liebenau\" stadium in his home country was renamed the \"Arnold-Schwarzenegger Stadium\".\n\nPolitically, this moderate Republican was for a long time relatively inactive (apart from his function as consultant for American sport). On October 7, 2003, Arnold Schwarzenegger (nicknamed by many the \"Governator\") was elected governor, and on November 17, 2003 before 7,500 invited guests he was inaugurated as the 38th Governor of the US state of California."
