        "text": "VIENNA, Austria -- Officials in Arnold Schwarzenegger's hometown of Graz quietly and under cover of darkness removed giant metal letters spelling out his name on a soccer stadium.\n\nThe California governor asked that his name be taken from the 15,300-seat arena after critics in his birthplace, where opposition to capital punishment runs high, scorned him for refusing to block this month's execution of convicted killer Stanley Tookie Williams.\n\nLate Sunday night or early Monday, authorities in the southern Austrian city unbolted the 20 letters spelling out the action star-turned-politician's name from Arnold Schwarzenegger Stadium. They timed the work to take advantage of the Christmas lull to avoid attracting attention \"and keep the media from taking photos,\" a local city hall official said.\n\nCapital punishment is illegal in Schwarzenegger's native Austria, where many people consider it barbaric. Opposition had run especially high in Graz, whose official slogan is \"City of Human Rights.\"\n\nAfter Williams' Dec. 13 execution triggered a firestorm in Europe and reignited calls for Graz's stadium to be stripped of Schwarzenegger's name, the governor opted for a pre-emptive strike: A week ago, he dashed off a letter to local officials asking that his name be removed and said he was returning an ornate ring of honor that Graz officials gave him in 1999.\n\nThe sign atop the main entrance to the stadium in Graz, about 120 miles south of Vienna, reads simply, \"Stadium Graz Liebenau,\" as it was known before it was renamed in Schwarzenegger's honor in 1997.\n\nCalls to the city hall in Graz went unanswered on Monday, a national holiday. Last week, Graz Mayor Siegfried Nagl wrote to Schwarzenegger urging him to reconsider his decision to cut ties to the city. Nagl said he reassured Schwarzenegger that most local residents still admire him despite fierce opposition to his pro-death penalty stance.\n\nNagl said he was worried that severing ties to Schwarzenegger potentially could cost the city millions in tourist revenue. But the movement to scrap Schwarzenegger's name from the stadium, led by local officials of the pacifist Green Party, had gained momentum in recent weeks, and a majority of the city council in Graz was said to support the idea.\n\nWilliams, 51, who founded the murderous Crips gang three decades ago, was put to death by injection at San Quentin Prison for the 1979 shotgun murders of a 7-Eleven clerk and three motel owners.\n\nWhile on death row, Williams wrote children's books warning against gang life. Those efforts attracted supporters who lobbied for clemency, arguing Williams had redeemed himself."
