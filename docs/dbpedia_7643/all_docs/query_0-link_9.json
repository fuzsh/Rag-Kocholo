Not only did he become one of the most well-known actors in the world and wed a Kennedy in the person of television journalist Maria Shriver, but Schwarzenegger also went a step further: he got himself elected governor of the State of California in a quirky 2003 contest that had the Republican action hero pitted against not only the current Democratic governor in an overwhelmingly Democratic state, but also a political lineup that resembled nothing so much as a guest list for the Jerry Springer Show.\n\nBlessed with an unusual physique that limited his acting roles, Schwarzenegger rose to fame through his work on action films such as Predator, The Terminator, True Lies, and Collateral Damage, balancing those films with the lighter fare—Twins, and Kindergarten Cop—that endeared him as well to a less-action-oriented audience. This balancing act extended into Schwarzenegger's off-screen life as well; a successful real estate investor and restauranteur who was the first U.S. civilian to own a military transport vehicle, he also motivated young people to improve their health as chairman of the President's Council on Physical Fitness from 1990 to 1993, and has served as international weight training coach for the Special Olympics since 1979. \"Arnold is the embodiment of the Superior Man,\" film director John Milius explained to Rolling Stone contributor Bill Zehme, describing the public Schwarzenegger. \"Arnold is the Nietzschean man. There's something wonderfully primeval about him, harking back to the real basic foundational stuff: steel and strength and will.\" That strength and will came in particularly handy when he took on the governor's job in California and faced a host of budgetary crises and a failing bond rating.\n\nThe Determination to Excel\n\nArnold Alois Schwarzenegger was born on July 30, 1947, in Graz, Austria, and grew up in the village of Thal, where his father, Gustav Schwarzenegger, a champion curler who had served in the German Strumabteilung, or SA, during the Nazi regime, was the police chief. During Schwarzenegger's childhood, Austria was still recovering in the wake of World War II, and such luxuries as indoor plumbing, telephones, and refrigerators were nonexistent in his home until Arnold was a teenager. Family life was regimented by Schwarzenegger's father, a strict disciplinarian who valued nutrition and athletics; Arnold and his older brother, Meinhard, woke daily at dawn to begin their morning chores, after which they had to complete an exercise routine before breakfast.\n\nSchwarzenegger began playing soccer as a child, and at the age of twelve was playing wing for the Graz Athletic Club's senior-level team. Beginning weight-lifting as a way to strengthen his legs for soccer, he soon became fascinated with the transformative power of bodybuilding. By the age of fifteen soccer was history, and Schwarzenegger was now studying anatomy and developing training routines designed to maximize the results of his hard work. His parents, concerned by their son's new obsession, only allowed Schwarzenegger to go to the gym three times a week. Unwilling to compromise, he set up a gym at home in an unheated room, where he worked out daily, regardless of the cold.\n\nAfter graduating from high school in 1965, Schwarzenegger enlisted in the Austrian army, where the familiar regimentation appealed to him. In addition to his responsibilities as a soldier, which included driving a tank, Schwarzenegger continued his strenuous training regimen. Unlike the Schwarzenegger home, where meat had been served once a week, the army diet was rich in protein, and Schwarzenegger's physique grew by leaps and bounds. After just one month of military service he won his first body-building title, Mr. Junior Europe, in Stuttgart, Germany. Because he had left his base without permission to compete in Stuttgart, Mr. Junior Europe was greeted by a one-year sentence in the brig upon his triumphant return to base.\n\nSchwarzenegger's training consisted of daily sessions that routinely lasted five hours. He ignored the pain and fatigue that resulted from these intense workouts; in fact, he considered exhaustion an indication of progress, and firmly believed that each hour spent in the gym brought him closer to his goals. In 1967 the twenty-year-old Austrian earned the Mr. Universe title, the youngest champion in the history of that event. The following year, Schwarzenegger made his first visit to the United States to defend his crown at the Mr. Universe competition in Miami, Florida, but finished second to Frank Zane. Fitness pioneer Joe Wieder, impressed by Schwarzenegger's early success, invited the Austrian bodybuilder to live and train under his patronage. Schwarzenegger moved to Los Angeles, where Weider provided him with an apartment, a car, and a weekly salary. In exchange, Schwarzenegger contributed articles discussing his innovative training methods to Weider's body-building magazines, including Muscle and Fitness. Weider's backing allowed Schwarzenegger to devote himself almost exclusively to training, and at Gold's Gym in Venice, California, he focused his energies on recapturing the Mr. Universe crown.\n\nFrom Bodybuilding to Business\n\nIn 1969 Schwarzenegger recaptured the Mr. Universe title, going on to become the first person to win all three major body-building competitions: Mr. Universe, Mr. World, and Mr. Olympia. At the peak of his career the 6-foot 2-inch Schwarzenegger weighed in at 235 pounds during competition, with a chest of 57 inches, a waist of 34 inches, and biceps of 22 inches. When he retired from body-building in 1975, having invested wisely in a series of small businesses, as well as in real estate, he could boast six consecutive Mr. Olympia victories and five Mr. Universe titles. In 1980, at age thirty-three, Schwarzenegger came out of retirement to take his seventh and final Mr. Olympia title.\n\nHaving found success in body building, Schwarzenegger now turned his attention full-time to one of his main life goals: becoming a film actor. He enjoyed the attention of the public, and as early as 1970 he had appeared in the title role in the low-budget Italian television production Hercules Goes to New York. Three years later he briefly appeared in Robert Altman's The Long Goodbye, and in 1975, the year he retired from bodybuilding, landed the breakthrough role of body-builder Joe Santos in Bob Rafelson's Stay Hungry. This film pits Santos against a group of land-hungry developers in Birmingham, Alabama, who want to demolish the gym where Santos and his comrades train. While the movie received little attention from critics, Schwarzenegger impressed critics with his confidence and unaffected manner, and in 1976 he was awarded the Golden Globe for best new actor.\n\nIn 1977 Schwarzenegger appeared in the critically acclaimed documentary Pumping Iron, directed by George Butler and Robert Fiore. The film, which follows world-class body-builders preparing for competition, depicts body-building as an artistic endeavor, bringing audiences into the gym where \"sculpting\" takes place. Culminating in a bodybuilding contest, the film reveals the depths of rivalry and tension that develop between contestants in such close quarters. In this setting, Schwarzenegger plays on his opponents' anxieties as easily as he moves heavy weights, and shows the full range of attributes that made him a champion. Although he was not acting in a role, critics were again stirred by Schwarzenegger's charismatic presence on screen, and Pumping Iron brought him to the attention of a wider public.\n\nStars in First Feature Film\n\nIn 1982 Schwarzenegger appeared in his first feature film role. John Milius's Conan the Barbarian, based on the pulp novels of Robert E. Howard, pits a sword-wielding Schwarzenegger against an evil sorcerer and his minions. The film—along with Schwarzenegger's performance—was almost universally panned by critics, who found the actor's heavy German accent difficult to comprehend and his movements on screen stiff and unconvincing. Audiences, apparently, thought otherwise. Conan the Barbarian and Richard Fleischer's sequel, Conan the Destroyer, were box office hits, earning $100 million and $80 million respectively.\n\nTwo years later came the film that catapulted Schwarzenegger to the top of the action-film industry, James Cameron's The Terminator. The film opens in the year 2029, after civilization has been destroyed in a nuclear war initiated by a supercomputer wrongly entrusted with the defense of the United States. The computer has since spawned an army of machines whose purpose is to exterminate residual humans. Schwarzenegger assumes the role of a murderous cyborg, or Terminator—a robotic skeleton and digital brain encased in human flesh—that is sent back through time to the year 1984. His mission: to assassinate the mother of the yet-to-be-born man who will lead the human resistance against the post-holocaust machine army. Knowing only the woman's name—Sarah Connor—the Terminator begins systematically killing women with that name. The Sarah Connor in question (Linda Hamilton) manages to elude the cyborg, and is eventually joined by Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn), a human soldier who has traveled backward in time to protect her from the Terminator. The remainder of the picture is a tense, extended chase sequence during which Reese and Connor must constantly outmaneuver the relentless and virtually indestructible Terminator.\n\nFilmed on a moderate budget, The Terminator was another box-office success for Schwarzenegger, earning $100 million. The title role required only convincing physical acting and the monotone delivery of appropriately timed one-liners, thereby making assets out of Schwarzenegger's acting liabilities, according to New Yorker contributor Terrence Rafferty, who dubbed the film a \"smart, unpretentious, thoroughly enjoyable thriller—an ideal B movie.\" This pattern of violence interspersed with comic relief established the formula for Schwarzenegger's next few films. The Terminator also gave Schwarzenegger his trademark line: \"I'll be back.\"\n\nCommando (1985) and Raw Deal (1986) both feature Schwarzenegger in high-action, predictably violent roles. While reviewers found neither film notable, both grossed the enormous sums that were becoming routine for Schwarzenegger features. Although reviews of his performances were generally not positive, critics noted continued improvement in Schwarzenegger's acting, and acknowledged that he had gained fluency of movement and physical poise on screen.\n\nAs with other challenges he had mastered, Schwarzenegger gained proficiency as an actor through dedication and hard work. Early in his career he took acting lessons, but as his career gained momentum he decided that the Hollywood sound-stage was the best learning atmosphere. \"I think the best practice you can get—the thing that makes you feel most comfortable and grow as an actor—is to work with different directors and different talented actors. It's on-the-job training,\" Schwarzenegger explained to Pat H. Broeske in Interview. \"The things that I have always worked on are the accent and the movement. Not that I want to get rid of the accent completely, because it has become a trademark, a signature.\"\n\nOther films followed in the wake of The Terminator, among them 1987's Predator, which finds Schwarzenegger cast as the leader of a military hostage-rescue mission into a Central-American jungle that goes awry when it is discovered that an alien being is behind the hostages' deaths. Featuring cutting-edge—for its day—special effects, Predator was nominated for an Academy Award for best visual effects. Red Heat, released the following year, was the first American motion picture to include scenes filmed in the Soviet Union. In this film Schwarzenegger stars opposite Jim Belushi as a Moscow-based KGB detective who has come to the United States in pursuit of a Russian drug czar. While Newsweek reviewer David Ansen found the costars' onscreen relationship unconvincing, Peter Travers expressed a different opinion in his People review, asserting that \"Schwarzenegger and Belushi prove they can crack heads and jokes with the best of them.\"\n\nSchwarzenegger's acting career reached another turning point with Twins. Forsaking his usual action-hero role, he teamed with diminutive actor Danny DeVito in this comedy about fraternal twins separated at birth who are reunited in a search for their birth mother. The brothers are the result of a genetic experiment in which Schwarzenegger's Julius inherits their parents' positive genetic traits, while DeVito's Vincent receives the leftovers. After birth the brothers are spirited away from their mother; Vincent is abandoned in an orphanage and enters a life of crime, while Julius is raised and educated in affluence. Time reviewer Richard Schickel praised both stars' performances, and added that \"The whole movie has a warmth about it that never slops over into sentiment: there is much more here than tall-guy, short-guy jokes.\" \"The muscle-bound Schwarzenegger demonstrates a remarkably delicate comedic touch,\" added Maclean's contributor Brian D. Johnson. \"Suddenly the brute from The Terminator and Red Heat does not seem to have a vengeful bone in his body.\"\n\nChairs President's Council on Physical Fitness\n\nIn 1990 Schwarzenegger's life expanded in yet another direction when he was named by President George Bush to chair the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports. Armed with his reputation as a fitness expert and the slogan \"Fitness for the '90s,\" Schwarzenegger traveled throughout the United States for the next three years, hoping to change Americans' attitudes about fitness. In an essay published in Newsweek, he called the lack of physical fitness among young people \"America's secret tragedy,\" and advocated greater involvement on the part of schools and parents in getting children to exercise regularly. Adults and senior citizens, too, need to make a commitment to regular activity to remain vigorous and productive, Schwarzenegger noted, explaining to Newsweek interviewer Suzie Boss that during the 1980s \"the only gain in fitness in this country has been by adults who can afford health clubs and workout videos. The inner cities have been left out, and our children have been left out.\" To promote his recommendations, Schwarzenegger coauthored a series of books on children's fitness. Arnold's Fitness for Kids: A Guide to Health Nutrition and Exercise consists of three volumes, each directed toward a specific age group. The guides emphasize play over competition, and \"provide sound advice for getting kids to stay in shape and eat wisely,\" affirmed a Publishers Weekly reviewer.\n\nSchwarzenegger returned to the screen in 1990 in Dutch filmmaker Paul Verhoeven's Total Recall. Based on a story by noted sci-fi writer Philip K. Dick, the film takes place in 2084, as Quaid (Schwarzenegger), a construction worker bored with life on Earth, decides to take a virtual vacation to recently colonized Mars. He hires a company to implant memories of a fictional trip to Mars in his brain, but the procedure backfires because Quaid's memories have already been altered. In fact, he is not Quaid at all, but Hauser, an agent of the tyrant Cohaagen (Ronny Cox), who controls the supply of air on Mars. Quaid/Hauser does not sort out his dual identity immediately, however, and only after journeying to Mars does the mystery unravel. At $50 million one of the most expensive films produced to date, Total Recall bursts with violence, gadgetry, and special effects. Time film critic Richard Corliss described the movie as a \"mammoth, teeming fantasy vision on film.\" Other critics were more ambivalent; Jack Kroll in Newsweek admitted that while the altered memory/lost identity plot holds a certain appeal, \"ultimately mayhem beats memory to a pulp.\"\n\nSchwarzenegger balanced the over-the-top action of Total Recall with Kindergarten Cop, taking on the role of a Los Angeles detective who tracks the estranged wife and son of a wanted criminal to a small town in Oregon. When his search is frustrated because no one can identify the wife and child, he goes under cover as a kindergarten teacher as a way to discover the young son's identity. Ralph Novak in People gave Schwarzenegger high marks for his performance as a kindergarten teacher, characterizing his interaction with the children as \"irresistible\" and calling the action hero \"witty, charming, subtle, tough and most impressive—a Cary Grant with pecs.\" \"I loved Kindergarten Cop,\" the actor told Pat H. Broeske of Interview. \"It was one of the few times when I could look at a movie of mine and say that I think my performance was good. I believed myself in it, and that's hard for me to do,\" he confessed.\n\nFour years after Kindergarten Cop, Schwarzenegger rejoined DeVito and director Ivan Reitman for Junior. In this 1994 film he plays a self-absorbed geneticist conducting research on a super-fertility drug. Losing funding for his research before the drug can be tested, he is persuaded by friend Dr. Larry Arbogast (DeVito) to try the drug on himself. Arbogast steals a frozen human egg, which Hesse fertilizes and injects into himself; coupled with the fertility drug, this causes Hesse to become pregnant. \"When the Big Guy starts showing, and begins to get that radiant glow, Junior hits its mellow, endearing comic stride,\" wrote Newsweek's Ansen.\n\nMega-Star of Mega-Buck Movies\n\nSchwarzenegger has revisited his Terminator role in two films, Terminator 2: Judgment Day and Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines, which combine with the original to create a cohesive and entertaining sci-fi saga. James Cameron manned the helm on the first sequel, popularly known as T-2, in which John Connor (Edward Furlong), son of Sarah Connor and the destined leader of the human resistance during the so-called \"machine wars,\" is now a troubled teen. In an interesting twist on the first film, Schwarzenegger's T-800 model has been reprogrammed and sent back in time to protect John from a second, more technologically advanced terminator, the T-1000 (Robert Patrick). With the help of his cyborg protector, John manages to free his resourceful mother (Hamilton) from the mental institution she has been locked away in following her unsuccessful efforts to warn of impending nuclear disaster. Together the trio attempt to halt the chain of events leading to that apocalypse, all the while contending with the dogged T-1000, whose liquid-metal composition makes it impervious to harm.\n\nWith its budget of $100 million, Terminator 2 was, by 1991 standards, the most expensive film ever produced. In addition to the requisite explosions and chase scenes, it introduced audiences to the startling visual effect of \"morphing\" created by cutting-edge computer-animation. Schwarzenegger's grisly makeup for the film's final sequences also reached new heights of realism, and the application of the make-up required to depict a face half gone took five hours. While the film was an uncontested blockbuster, some critics continued to quibble. Finding T-2 inferior to The Terminator, Time's Corliss described the film as a \"humongous, visionary parable that intermittently enthralls and ultimately fails.\" The critic noted, however, that Terminator 2 clearly \"establishes Schwarzenegger as a stolid icon with a sense of humor.\"\n\nOver a decade would pass before Schwarzenegger once again reprised his role as the Terminator, much to the chagrin of the series' legions of fans. Finally, in 2003 the Jonathan Mostow-directed Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines reached theatres and brought closure. John Connor (Nick Stahl) is now a young man living in anonymity on the streets; Sarah Connor is dead. The T-800 is again sent to Earth to protect John—as well as the future Mrs. John Connor (Claire Danes)—from a particularly formidable foe: the seemingly indestructible T-X (Kristanna Loken). As the two cyborgs battle for John's life, the Terminator begins to evolve into self-awareness, a pivotal moment in the sci-fi series. People reviewer Leah Rozen praised the long-awaited film, noting that T-3 \"manages to further its story and characters while paying homage to its past.\" She also commented on the \"whopping helping of self-mocking humor\" sprinkled throughout the screenplay. Noting that Schwarzenegger \"still enunciates like a man who bought a 'Teach Yourself English' kit . . . and then lost half the tapes,\" New Yorker contributor Anthony Lane admitted that the actor's shtick \"allows him to find slivers of pathos in his deadpan calm.\" Noting Schwarzenegger's \"durable charms\" in his Terminator role, Lisa Schwarzbaum added in her Entertainment Weekly review that \"Arnold's famous 'doan doo dot' Teutonic-Conehead monotone\" continues to \"work its low-tech magic\" on film audiences.\n\nSchwarzenegger found another box-office hit in Jim Cameron's True Lies, playing an American intelligence operative who not only deals swift punishment to the enemy, but, as New Republic critic Stanley Kauffmann observed, has \"James Bond characteristics: suavity and erudition.\" Some of this suavity must be hidden, however, as, unlike Bond, Schwarzenegger's Harry Tasker also has a cover: a family who thinks he's a computer salesman. Frustrated by neglect, Tasker's wife (Jamie Lee Curtis) suspects her husband of cheating, and ultimately becomes caught up in his current assignment: preventing a terrorist group from detonating an atomic weapon. Although cited for stereotypical depictions of Arab terrorists and a sexist treatment of Helen, True Lies captivated many filmgoers due to its intriguing plot, humor, and high action content. \"Cameron's script is often ingenious and always original,\" noted Ralph Novak in his review of the film for People.\n\nFilmed for $120 million, Eraser, a 1996 action-thriller, also drew praise from critics. Here Schwarzenegger is Kruger, a top-notch agent in the federal witness protection program whose specialty is helping witnesses assume new identities by \"erasing\" their old ones. He is assigned to protect Lee Cullen (Vanessa Williams), who wants to testify against her employer and thereby stop the illegal export of an advanced weapons system known as the Rail Gun. When ties between Cullen's employer and the U.S. government surface, Kruger—and filmgoers—don't know whom to trust, in a film described as \"good action fun, with spectacular stunts and special effects . . . and high energy\" by Roger Ebert in the Chicago Sun-Times. Corliss, reviewing the film in Time, admitted that Eraser \"could have been a fiasco; instead, it smartly remythologizes this indispensable Hollywood icon\"; \"for the first time in a while,\" he concluded, \"[Schwarzenegger's] character is as solid as he is.\"\n\nWhile he had become one of the most well-known actors in the world, for Schwarzenegger life as an action hero has a down side: a certain amount of wear and tear. His first film, Conan the Barbarian, had resulted in a fall down a hill while being chased by dogs. During the making of Terminator 3 he suffered a serious rotator-cuff injury to his shoulder that kept him out of commission for several weeks. Although seemingly indestructible—as an actor, Schwarzenegger consistently worked to minimalize any affects of ageing that would be visible to the public—in 1997 the fifty-year-old actor was also forced to undergo open-heart surgery to correct a congenital heart-valve malfunction.\n\nMovie Mimics Life--and Death\n\nSurgery aside, middle age did not seem to slow Schwarzenegger, who continued to take physically demanding roles in action films. End of Days and The Sixth Day garnered lackluster praise from critics, despite drawing well at the box office; in the first, a horror thriller released in 1999, Schwarzenegger stars as an ex-cop-turned-supernatural-demonfighter; in the second he plays a man whose world is turned upside down when he discovers that he has been cloned—and that his clone has taken over his life. Schwarzenegger's third action picture of the new millennium, Collateral Damage, was scheduled for release in the fall of 2001, but was temporarily withdrawn from distribution because the plot—a Columbian-based terrorist blows up innocent civilians in Los Angeles and plans the same for Washington, D.C., unless Schwarzenegger can shut him down in time—hit too close to home after the real-life terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Unfortunately, for most critics, the wait wasn't worth it; Rozen dubbed Collateral Damage a \"pointless revenge fantasy\" in People, and Owen Gleiberman observed in Entertainment Weekly that \"Schwarzenegger, at 54, is long past being able to run, leap, and knuckle people's heads in with his old Teutonic vigor.\"\n\nFrom Terminator to \"Governator\"\n\nIn response to the national tragedy Schwarzenegger served on the board of New York City's Twin Towers Fund for the victims of September 11, and also contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars toward this effort. And perhaps in response to critics of his most recent films, he began to trade in his role as an action hero for an increasingly active role in public policy-making, particularly in his home state. His efforts to promote a California ballot initiative to provide funds for after-school programs for children proved successful, as did the $1 million of his own money that he donated to the cause.\n\nWhen the political events in California began to play out like a script for the Theatre of the Absurd, the time was ripe for Schwarzenegger to act on the Republican principles he had held for many years. Dissatisfied with the performance of their current governor, Democrat Gray Davis, California voters hit upon a novel idea: hold a recall election a year into Davis's term, and accept all comers on the ballot. On August 6, 2003, fresh from a visit to U.S. troops stationed in Iraq, Schwarzenegger announced his candidacy for governor of California on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. The announcement put to bed rumors of the actor's political aspirations, but awoke a host of new rumors regarding everything from his father's Nazi affiliation to a chronic tendency to grope young, attractive women. Although a backlash against the conservative Austrian-born actor was mounted, Schwarzenegger easily won the election held in early October, becoming California's thirty-eighth governor.\n\nOne of Schwarzenegger's first acts as governor-elect was to cease lame-duck Democrat Davis's ability to spend state funds. Sworn in on November 17, 2003, the actor-turned-politician quickly took a hard line on state spending, hoping to turn around California's sagging, close-to-bankrupt economy which boasted a $14 billion indebtedness by election day. He also derailed, during his first days in office, an incongruous plan to issue drivers' licenses to illegal immigrants as a way to fill state coffers. In his first state-of-the-state address Schwarzenegger warned state residents that the road to recovery would be a difficult one, and in the days to come he proved this to be true: under the knife went cuts in unessential programs for the poor and disabled, along with reductions in the state funds allotted to health care, local governments, and schools. While his proposals were deemed ruthless by some, Schwarzenegger found increasing support within the California legislature.\n\nIf you enjoy the works of Arnold Schwarzenegger\n\nIf you enjoy the works of Arnold Schwarzenegger, you might want to check out the following films:\n\nWill Smith in I, Robot, 2004.\n\nSylvester Stallone in First Blood, 1982.\n\nBruce Willis in Die Hard, 1988.\n\nDespite the criticism leveled at Governor Schwarzenegger from some partisan quarters, he retained the support of California voters nervous over the continued monetary demands of big government. Rather than governing Terminator-style, as many pundits anticipated, the former actor has \"shown that the art of compromise is neither a lost art, nor something favoured only by wimps,\" according to a London Financial Times writer who added that \"the former body-builder has redefined what constitutes political strength.\" Also rallying Californians has been Schwarzenegger's continued efforts to give something back. In December of 2003 he announced that he would refuse to accept the $175,000 salary he was entitled to as governor, and the following March he arranged to serve as executive editor for two body-building magazines published by American Media Inc. on the condition that the fitness publisher donate $250,000 a year to the California Governor's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports. Reviewing Schwarzenegger's first few months in office, an Economist writer noted that the former actor \"is proving a lot more adept than his critics had imagined.\" Schwarzenegger's efforts to promote business—and job—growth statewide while reducing spending resulted in an increase in the state's credit rating for the first time in four years, bolstering investment in state-issued bonds issued to keep California running. \"If I can sell tickets to my movies like 'Red Sonja' or 'Last Action Hero,' you know I can sell just about anything,\" a confident Schwarzenegger joked in the Economist, referring to two of his worst films. \"California is the easiest sell I've ever had.\"\n\nBiographical and Critical Sources\n\nBOOKS\n\nAndrews, Nigel, True Myths: The Life and Times of Arnold Schwarzenegger, Carol Publishing (New York, NY), 1996, revised as True Myths: The Life and Times of Arnold Schwarzenegger: From Pumping Iron to Governor of California, Bloomsbury (New York, NY), 2003.\n\nBlitz, Michael, and Louise Krasniewicz, Why Arnold Matters, Basic Books (New York, NY), 2004.\n\nButler, George, Arnold Schwarzenegger: A Portrait, Simon & Schuster (New York, NY), 1990.\n\nConklin, Thomas, Meet Arnold Schwarzenegger, Random House (New York, NY), 1994.\n\nFlynn, John L., The Films of Arnold Schwarzenegger, Carol Publishing Group (Secaucus, NJ), 1995.\n\nGreen, Tom, Arnold!, St. Martin's Press (New York, NY), 1987.\n\nLipsyte, Robert, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Hercules in America, HarperCollins (New York, NY), 1993.\n\nPERIODICALS\n\nChicago Sun-Times, June 21, 1996, Roger Ebert, review of Eraser.\n\nEconomist (U.S.), January 10, 2004, p. 24.\n\nEntertainment Weekly, February 22, 2002, Owen Gleiberman, review of Collateral Damage, p. 120; July 11, 2003, Lisa Schwarzbaum, review of Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines, p. 59.\n\nFinancial Times, April 23, 2004, p. 16.\n\nInterview, July, 1991, Pat H.

By the age of fifty-six, Arnold Schwarzenegger had tackled at least three—bodybuilding, acting, and politics. It is difficult to break into any one of these professions, yet Schwarzenegger managed to excel in each and every one. He earned thirteen world bodybuilding championships, is considered one of the most influential actors in Hollywood, and, in 2003, without ever running for political office before, he became the governor of California. If Schwarzenegger had listened to his many critics along the way, he never would have succeeded. However, with discipline, determination, and drive, he proved that an Austrian-born immigrant can achieve the American dream.\n\nThe need to succeed\n\nArnold Alois Schwarzenegger was born on July 30, 1947, the second son of Gustav and Aurelia Schwarzenegger. He was raised, along with older brother Meinhard, in the tiny village of Thal, just outside of Graz, Austria. Schwarzenegger's father, Gustav, was the local police chief, and the family lived above the police station where Gustav worked. The Schwarzenegger home was a humble one. In fact, they did not have indoor plumbing until Arnold was a teenager. This was not uncommon at the time, however, since families all over Europe were just beginning to recover from the effects of World War II (1939–45).\n\nBefore joining the police force, Gustav Schwarzenegger was a military officer, and he ran his household in strict military fashion. Both Arnold and Meinhard were required to get up before sunrise to tend to their chores. After chores came a rigorous exercise routine, followed by breakfast. Gustav also instilled a love of sports in his sons. Meinhard, who died when he was twenty-three years old in a car accident, was a boxing champion. Arnold showed promise as a soccer player. It was while performing exercises to strengthen his legs for soccer that Schwarzenegger turned to the sport that would eventually make him famous: bodybuilding.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger pursued weightlifting and bodybuilding with a passion. He trained for hours a day, both at a local gym and at home where he set up a training area in a room that had no heat. He also studied anatomy and nutrition to understand how to become physically fit. His parents worried that he was obsessed with training, but Schwarzenegger had his eyes on a goal; that goal was to leave his little village behind and become a success in America.\n\n\"I learned something from all these years of lifting and training hard.... What I learned was that we are always stronger than we know.\"\n\nMr. Universe\n\nIn 1965, after he graduated from high school, Schwarzenegger joined the Austrian army. Just one month after enlisting, he won his first bodybuilding title, Mr. Junior Europe. The competition was held in Germany, and Schwarzenegger had left his army base without permission to compete. As a result, he spent the next year in the brig, which is a holding area for people in the military who have committed offenses. After he was released, Schwarzenegger resumed his training with gusto, often spending up to five hours a day in the gym.\n\nThe Ronald Reagan Comparison\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger was not the first celebrity to hold public office. For example, professional wrestler Jesse \"The Body\" Ventura (1951–) was governor of Minnesota from 1998 until 2002, and from 1986 to 1988 actor/director Clint Eastwood (1930–) was mayor of Carmel, California. The best-known celebrity-turned-politician, however, may be Ronald Reagan (1911–2004), former governor of California (1967–1975) and president of the United States (1981–1989). Throughout his run for governor, Schwarzenegger was constantly compared to Reagan for some obvious reasons: both were actors, both were very charismatic speakers, and both were new to politics when they ran for office. But, are there other similarities?\n\nAge: Schwarzenegger and Reagan were both fifty-six years old when they became governor of California.\n\nNicknames: Reagan was known as \"The Great Communicator\" while Schwarzenegger was dubbed \"The Oak\" because of his strength and concentration.\n\nSports: Both men shared a love of sports and got their start in the world of athletics. Schwarzenegger was a bodybuilder; Reagan played football and was a swimmer. Reagan also got his first break into show business as an announcer for football and baseball games in Iowa.\n\nHis grueling schedule paid off in 1967, when, at the age of twenty, Schwarzenegger won his first Mr. Universe title. The Mr. Universe competition is an annual event sponsored by the National Amateur Bodybuilders Association (NABBA). Competitors are judged on such things as size and definition of muscles, balance and proportion of body parts, and overall presentation. The youngest person to ever win the competition, Schwarzenegger was confident that he would keep his title the following year. He was also excited because his dream of traveling to the United States was about to come true since the 1968 Mr. Universe competition was to be held in Miami, Florida.\n\nAlthough he did not win the 1968 title in Miami, Schwarzenegger was noticed by fitness pioneer Joe Weider (1922–). Weider was so impressed by the young bodybuilder that he invited him to stay in the United States and live and train with him in Los Angeles, California. Schwarzenegger jumped at the chance. Weider became Schwarzenegger's mentor, and from the late 1960s through the 1970s, Schwarzenegger devoted himself to training and competing. He reclaimed his Mr. Universe crown in 1969, and went on to dominate every major bodybuilding competition, including Mr. Universe, Mr. World, and Mr. Olympia.\n\nIn addition to being a star bodybuilder, Schwarzenegger helped popularize the sport. He wrote articles about his unique training methods for Weider's fitness magazines; he also was featured in a 1977 documentary about bodybuilding competitions, called Pumping Iron. The documentary was quite popular and gave Schwarzenegger his first taste of Hollywood celebrity. In 1980, at the age of thirty-three, he officially retired from bodybuilding to devote himself to a new career: acting.\n\nBox-office gold\n\nSchwarzenegger made a few low-budget movies in the 1970s, cast mostly in small roles that required big muscles, not big talent. In 1982 he was tapped to play the lead in Conan the Barbarian, based on the comic-book hero of the same name. Again, Schwarzenegger's strength was in his biceps, not his acting skills. Critics panned his performance, claiming that it was nearly impossible to understand his German-accented English. Audiences, however, loved the movie, which turned out to be a box-office hit. Two years later, in 1984, Schwarzenegger cemented his box-office appeal when he appeared in the movie The Terminator.\n\nIn The Terminator, Schwarzenegger played a violent cyborg (part robot, part human) who is sent from the future to exterminate the mother of humankind's future leader. He spoke seventy-four words in the movie, all delivered in a monotone, robotic voice. Audiences did not mind the lack of acting ability, and they flocked to see Schwarzenegger in the sci-fi thriller. The movie was so popular that Schwarzenegger became known for his character's famous one-liner: \"I'll be back,\" or as Schwarzenegger pronounced it, \"Awl be buck.\"\n\nAction movies like The Terminator proved to be wildly popular with people of all ages, and Schwarzenegger proved to be the perfect action hero. He followed The Terminator with a string of movies, including Commando (1985), Predator (1987), Total Recall (1990), and True Lies (1994). He also continued the Terminator movies, starring in Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991), which produced the famous line, \"Hasta la vista, baby,\" and Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003). For his role in Terminator 3, Schwarzenegger was paid $30 million.\n\nIn addition to playing the tough-as-nails hero, Schwarzenegger starred in a number of comedies, including three movies made by director Ivan Reitman (1946–): Twins (1988), Kindergarten Cop (1990), and Junior (1994). Moviegoers embraced the \"lighter side of Arnold,\" and critics admitted that Schwarzenegger was growing as an actor. Everyone agreed that he was box-office gold. In fact, in 1993, he was recognized as the International Box Office Star of the Decade.\n\nBy 2004 Schwarzenegger had appeared in nearly thirty movies, and he brought his unique style to each role. One thing he never lost was his accent. Comedians and critics made countless jokes about the way \"Ah-nuld\" talked, but Schwarzenegger seemed to take it in stride. He also explained in a 1991 interview with Pat Broeske that he did not want to get rid of his accent completely because it had become, Broeske noted, \"his trademark, his signature.\"\n\nThe family man\n\nSchwarzenegger's trademark made him a very wealthy actor, and he used his money wisely, investing in real estate and several businesses, including the restaurant chain Planet Hollywood. He was also a devoted family man. Schwarzenegger met his wife, television journalist Maria Shriver (1955–), in 1977. The couple married in 1986; they have four children, two boys and two girls. Shriver was no stranger to celebrity, considering she is part of one of the most famous families in the United States. Her mother, Eunice Kennedy Shriver (1921–), is the sister of U.S. president John F. Kennedy (1917–1963).\n\nMost people thought that the couple made a very odd pair. He was a brawny bodybuilder turned actor. She was a \"brain\" who graduated from Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., and was coanchor of CBS Morning News. He was a well-known supporter of the Republican Party. The Republican Party is considered to be the more conservative of the two major political parties in the United States. Shriver, as part of the Kennedy clan, was a Democrat to the core. Members of the Democratic Party are traditionally considered to be more liberal. Those closest to the couple, however, say they are a perfect match. Both have competitive drives; both are committed to their family; and both share a wacky sense of humor.\n\nThe Schwarzeneggers also share a commitment to politics and to social causes. Since 1979 they have been devoted to the Special Olympics, helping to raise funds and awareness. Established by Eunice Shriver in 1968, Special Olympics provides year-round sports training and sponsors annual athletic competitions for children and adults with mental retardation. There are Special Olympics programs in almost 150 countries; Arnold serves as the Special Olympics International Weight Training Coach.\n\nIn 1990 Schwarzenegger was given an incredible opportunity to spread his message about the importance of fitness when President George H. W. Bush (1924–) appointed him chairman of the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports (PCPFS). According to the PCPFS Web site, the goal of the council is to \"promote, encourage and motivate Americans of all ages to become physically active and participate in sports.\" Schwarzenegger was the perfect spokesman. With high energy and unlimited enthusiasm, he traveled across the country spreading the word that it was \"hip to be fit.\" When Democrat Bill Clinton (1946–) took over the presidency in 1993, Schwarzenegger resigned from the council.\n\nThe \"Collectionator\"\n\nSchwarzenegger had been such a dynamic public figure in the Bush administration that people wondered if he was heading for a future in politics. Schwarzenegger denied the rumors for years, claiming he was too busy being a businessman and family man. In 2002, however, he spent a good deal of time campaigning in California for state grant money to fund after-school programs for children. And, in 2003, when California governor Gray Davis (1942–) was threatened by a recall, the buzz was strong that Schwarzenegger would throw his hat in the ring.\n\nThe year 2003 was a strange one in California politics. Democrat Gray Davis, who had over twenty years of experience in politics, was governor, and had been since 1998. Throughout his first term in office, however, Davis faced a number of problems, including an outof-control budget, a sagging state economy, and electricity blackouts that left most of the state without power for some time during 2001. Californians were not happy, and they blamed Davis for the sad state of affairs. In 2002, just months into his second term of office, citizens started a campaign to recall Davis as governor. This meant that Davis, through a special election, would possibly be replaced.\n\nThe election led to media frenzy since it was the first time in California's history that a governor faced a recall. In addition, people came out of the woodwork to campaign for Davis's job. On August 6, 2003, Schwarzenegger fueled the frenzy by announcing that he, too, was going to run for governor. He made his announcement during an interview on the late-night television program The Tonight Show.\n\nSchwarzenegger spent the next several months campaigning in rather untraditional ways. For example, he chatted with Oprah Winfrey (1954–) on her afternoon talk show, and he was interviewed by disc jockey Howard Stern (1954–), who is known for his outrageous radio antics. Schwarzenegger peppered his interviews with references to his movies, promising to say \"Hasta la vista\" to new taxes and calling himself the \"Collectionator,\" since one of his goals was to ask the federal government for funds to bail California out of its economic crisis.\n\nArnold to the rescue\n\nAll of the media attention prompted voters to turn out in droves, and on October 8, 2003, the citizens of California elected Arnold Schwarzenegger governor with 48.6 percent of the vote. On November 17, during his swearing-in ceremony, Schwarzenegger commented, \"It is no secret that I'm a newcomer to politics. I realize I was elected on faith and hope. And I feel a great responsibility not to let the people down.\"\n\nThe public may have felt they needed an action hero to come to their aid, but political commentators had their doubts. Schwarzenegger was able to campaign on catchy phrases, but what would he do once in office? According to political consultant David Axelrod in a 2003 Time article, \"This isn't the movies. No one is going to throw him a ray gun so he can blow up the deficit.\"\n\nSchwarzenegger's first days in office were watched closely. He made good on several of his campaign promises, including lowering car taxes. He was also applauded for trying to get California Democrats and Republicans to work together to help solve the state's budget problems. Schwarzenegger, however, was just beginning to flex his political muscles. His state still faced a staggering amount of debt, and he tried to figure a way out without hurting social programs like education and health care.\n\nIn March 2004, voters passed Schwarzenegger's Proposition 57, which would allow the state to use bonds (low-interest, long-term loans) to slash $15 billion from the ever-growing debt. Politicians considered the proposition to be a daring move, but Schwarzenegger was used to taking chances, and he had faith that the voters would believe in him. In a rally held just after the vote, and reported on CNN, he reassured the public that his borrowing plan would \"make California the golden state that it once was.\"\n\nJust months into office, people began to speculate once again what was next for Arnold Schwarzenegger, family man, businessman, actor, and now governor. When he appeared on the television program Meet the Press, in February 2004, host Tim Russert wondered if perhaps Schwarzenegger had his eye on the White House. Schwarzenegger shooed away the question, commenting that he had been too busy tackling California's problems to think about his next move. \"I have no idea,\" he commented, \"I haven't thought about that at all.\"\n\nBut, can we believe him, since that is exactly what Schwarzenegger said when asked if he would ever run for political office? He faces one big obstacle, however. According to the U.S. Constitution, only citizens who were born in the United States are eligible to be president. Although Schwarzenegger became a citizen in 1983, he was born in Austria. A change, or amendment, to the constitution has been proposed that would make it possible for anyone who has been a U.S. citizen for at least twenty years to seek the presidency. And, as Ah-nuld has proven time and again, anything is possible.\n\nFor More Information\n\nPeriodicals\n\nBoss, Suzie. \"Hey, Kids, Get Physical!\" Newsweek (August 27, 1990): pp. 62–64.\n\nBroeske, Pat H. \"Arnold Schwarzenegger.\" Interview (July 1991): p. 85.\n\nStreisand, Betsy. \"Reality Check: Effect of Arnold Schwarzenegger's Government.\" U.S. News & World Report (January 12, 2004): p. 26.\n\nTresniowski, Alex, et al. \"What Makes Them Run?\" People Weekly (August 25, 2003): pp. 50–58.\n\nTumulty, Karen, and Terry McCarthy. \"All That's Missing Is the Popcorn.\" Time (August 18, 2003): pp. 22–30.\n\nWeb Sites\n\nRussert, Tim. \"Interview with Arnold Schwarzenegger and Ralph Nader.\" NBC News'Meet the Press (February 22, 2004). http://msnbc.msn.com/id/4304155 (accessed on May 30, 2004).\n\nSchwarzenegger.com: The Official Web site. http://www.schwarzenegger.com (accessed on May 30, 2004).\n\n\"Schwarzenegger's Inauguration Speech.\" CNN.com: Inside Politics. http://www.cnn.com/2003/ALLPOLITICS/11/17/arnold.speech (accessed on May 31, 2004).\n\n\"Schwarzenegger Wins Budget Test.\" CNN.com: Inside Politics (March 3, 2004). http://www5.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/03/03/california.proposition.ap (accessed on May 30, 2004).\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger\n\nBorn July 30, 1947\n\nGraz, Austria\n\nGovernor of California, movie star, and champion bodybuilder\n\n\"For the people to win, politics as usual must lose.\"\n\n\"D o we want philosophy or action? I want action.\"Arnold Schwarzenegger made that statement in reply to a question posed by a journalist about whether an after-school program he championed would put the government in the position of replacing moms. The statement reflects Schwarzenegger's style: He sets a goal and works tirelessly and aggressively toward it, adding charm and a knack for self-promotion as he undertakes quests for ultimate titles: he has been Mr. Universe, King of the Box Office, Chairman of the President's Council on Physical Fitness, and Governor of California. Schwarzenegger has been an action hero in movies and in real life.\n\nWorking out\n\nArnold Alois Schwarzenegger was born on July 30, 1947, in Graz, Austria, and raised in the nearby village of Thal. His father, Gustav, was a police officer. Austria at the time was still recovering from the effects of World War II (1939–45) and having been occupied by Nazi Germany, a regime, led by Adolf Hitler (1889–1945), known primarily for its brutal policies of racism. The Schwarzenegger family, which included mother Aurelia and older brother Meinhard, struggled to survive a time of scarcity and slow rebuilding. The family lacked indoor plumbing and a refrigerator until Arnold was a teenager. Schwarzenegger's father was a strict disciplinarian. He woke his sons shortly after sunrise to begin their morning chores. After chores, the boys performed an exercise routine before eating a breakfast meal planned by their father.\n\nThe Schwarzeneggers enjoyed sports. Schwarzenegger's father often pitted his two sons in competitions. Arnold was younger and often lost these competitions, which contributed to the psychological drive that led to his achievements as an adult. Schwarzenegger's father excelled at curling, an ice sport where players take turns directing their curling stones to a target area. Meinhard was a champion boxer; he died in an automobile accident at the age of twenty-three. Arnold played soccer as a child and advanced at age twelve to a senior level team, the Graz Athletic Club.\n\nWhen his soccer coach took the team to a gym to work out with weights to improve their strength and stamina, Schwarzenegger discovered he enjoyed the workouts. Around that time, he met Kurt Marnul, a professional bodybuilder who invited Schwarzenegger to train at the Athletic Union in Graz. By the age of fifteen, Schwarzenegger was studying anatomy and developing training routines to maximize the results of his hard work. Worried about his son's obsession with weightlifting (Schwarzenegger's father called it \"Austria's least favorite sport\"), his father limited Schwarzenegger's trips to the athletic club. Schwarzenegger responded by building a makeshift gym at home that would allow him to continue his training.\n\nAfter graduating from high school in 1965, Schwarzenegger enlisted in the Austrian army. The regimentation of army life was not new to him, having lived under the strict discipline enforced by his father. When he was free from duty, which included driving a tank, Schwarzenegger continued the strenuous training regimen he had devised. Meanwhile, the army diet—emphasizing meat and foods rich in protein—helped Schwarzenegger bulk up his physique. His exercise routine transformed bulk into thick muscle. After just one month of military service, Schwarzenegger entered and won his first bodybuilding title, Mr. Junior Europe, in Stuttgart, Germany. A bit too eager to compete, Schwarzenegger had left his military base without permission to compete in Stuttgart. Upon his return, he was sentenced to a military jail for having been absent without leave.\n\nUpon his release from military jail, Schwarzenegger initiated his new plan that concentrated on powerlifting, a quicker, and more strenuous type of weightlifting. He won the Austrian Junior Olympic Powerlifting championship, but in the process he realized that the stress of powerlifting would eventually wear him out rather than build up his body. He returned to a bodybuilding program with daily sessions running for several hours.\n\nMr. Universe\n\nIn 1967, Schwarzenegger won the first of his five titles in the Mr. Universe competition. Playing off his dominating performance that earned him the top bodybuilding prize, Schwarzenegger founded a business through which he could operate in a variety of functions, from investing in real estate to supplying gyms with equipment and developing diet products. In 1968, Schwarzenegger made his first visit to the United States to attend the Mr. Universe competition in Miami, Florida. Schwarzenegger lost his title, but finished second. Nevertheless, fitness pioneer Joe Weider (1922–) was impressed by Schwarzenegger and invited him to Los Angeles to train under his sponsorship.\n\nSchwarzenegger's Early Experiences with Bodybuilding\n\nIn an excerpt from Arnold: The Education of a Bodybuilder, Arnold Schwarzenegger recalls his early love of bodybuilding:\n\nDuring the early years I didn't care how I felt about anything except bodybuilding. It consumed every minute of my days and all my best effort…. When I was ten years old I got this thing that I wanted to be the best in swimming, so I started swimming. I won championships, but I felt I couldn't be the best. I tried it in skiing, but there I felt that I didn't have the potential. I played soccer, but I didn't like that too well because there I didn't get the credit alone if I did something special. Then I started weight lifting through other sports…. I won the Austrian championship in 1964 but I found out I was just too tall. So I quit that and went into bodybuilding. Two years later I found out that that's it—that's what I can be best in.\n\nWeider provided Schwarzenegger with an apartment, a car, and a weekly salary. In exchange, Schwarzenegger contributed articles on the training methods he developed to Weider's bodybuilding magazines, including Muscle and Fitness. In Los Angeles, Schwarzenegger devoted himself almost exclusively to training, intent on recapturing the Mr. Universe crown. Schwarzenegger proceeded to dominate the sport. He won six consecutive Mr. Olympia contests in addition to winning back the Mr. Universe title and adding three more to his total. He retired from bodybuilding competitions in 1975, except for a brief comeback in 1980 to take his seventh and final Mr. Olympia title. By then, he had created many other opportunities to pursue.\n\n\"I'll be back\"\n\nLiving in Los Angeles and accustomed to performing before audiences and cameras, Schwarzenegger began to pursue an acting career. As early as 1970, when Schwarzenegger was twenty-two, his physique made him ideal for the title role in a low-budget Italian television production, Hercules Goes to New York. Schwarzenegger had a small role in The Long Goodbye, a 1973 film by acclaimed director Robert Altman (1925–). In 1975, Schwarzenegger played bodybuilder Joe Santos in the film Stay Hungry, for which he won a Golden Globe award for best new actor. Pumping Iron (1977), his next film, is a documentary on body building, following several world-class bodybuilders as they prepare for competition—from working out in gyms to participation in a contest. Pumping Iron is an \"extraordinary documentary of Schwarzenegger's rise in the nascent [emerging] bodybuilding culture of the time,\" wrote Andrew Sullivan in Time magazine more than twenty-five years after the film was released. \"He took a minor and largely derided [ridiculed] sport and made it a world-wide sensation,\" Sullivan added.\n\nIn 1978, Schwarzenegger met television journalist Maria Shriver (1955–). They were married in 1986 and would have four children. Shriver is the daughter of R. Sargent Shriver (1915–), former director of the Peace Corps and the running mate of 1972 Democratic presidential candidate George McGovern (1922–), and Eunice Kennedy Shriver, sister of the late U.S. president John F. Kennedy (1917–1963; served 1961–63). Schwarzenegger's extended family, the Kennedy clan, had produced many prominent politicians. Schwarzenegger would later become a politician himself, and he shared some of the Kennedy family's activism for social programs to assist those in need. But Schwarzenegger would be elected as a Republican, not as a Democrat, of which the Kennedys are powerful symbols.\n\nIn addition to politics, Shriver also introduced Schwarzenegger to one of her favorite causes, the Special Olympics. This organization provides opportunities for physically challenged children to play and compete in sports. Schwarzenegger eagerly joined the group and brought increasingly greater attention to it as he himself became an increasingly famous public figure.\n\nDuring the 1980s, Schwarzenegger emerged as one of the most popular and bankable of movie stars. He was an obvious choice to play the lead in the film versions of Conan, a muscular sword-and-sorcery hero whose adventures were related in a series of books. What Conan the Barbarian (1982) and Conan the Destroyer (1984) lacked in artistry and acting was more than made up for in box-office success. More significant was Schwarzenegger's role as a violent cyborg (a bionic, or electromechanical, human) sent from the future to eliminate the mother of mankind's future leader in The Terminator (1984). In this film, Schwarzenegger created a screen persona that minimized his need for acting skills; his characters became larger-than-life, caught up in fast-paced life and death situations. They also maintained a disarming charm, spouting tough one-liners that fans enjoyed repeating. Schwarzenegger himself enjoys repeating his trademark line from The Terminator: \"I'll be back.\"\n\nA series of highly popular action films followed—Commando (1985), Raw Deal (1986), The Running Man (1987), and Predator (1987). In 1988, Schwarzenegger expanded into comic roles, which also met with box-office success. In Twins (1988), the tall, muscular Schwarzenegger played the unlikely fraternal twin of the short, chubby actor Danny DeVito (1944–). Kindergarten Cop (1990) had Schwarzenegger struggling to keep peace among a group of lively kids while chasing a criminal.\n\nChairman of President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports\n\nJust as Schwarzenegger had been successful expanding from a career in bodybuilding to one as an actor, and from a powerful action-hero to more comic roles, he used his Hollywood popularity to bring attention to important causes. In 1990, President George Bush (1924–; served 1989–93) named Schwarzenegger chairman of the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports. Schwarzenegger campaigned across the fifty states to change American attitudes about fitness. He contributed an essay to Newsweek magazine in which he called poor physical fitness among children \"America's secret tragedy.\"\n\nSchwarzenegger continued to be involved with the Special Olympics and added roles as a promoter of the Inner City Games and diverse charities devoted to caring for sick children. Schwarzenegger coauthored Arnold's Fitness for Kids: A Guide to Health, Nutrition and Exercise, three books each directed toward a specific age group. The guides provide advice on good eating habits and emphasize play over competiti"
