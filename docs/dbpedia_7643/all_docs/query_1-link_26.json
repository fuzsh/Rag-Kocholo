        "text": "Hello all!\n\nSaturday is for trips, fun, adventure, relaxing, skyping, all in all represents quality time. Which passes very fast. I do the laundry, the shopping, I also meditate a bit over my next week's plans, and summarize the previous days' experiences. I'm conscious about my physical well-being, so going for a run in the nearby forest is compulsory for me. And after all these I skype with my family and friends, and time is ticking and I suddenly find out that my free day has passed. Almost. Because there are a lot to do in Graz, even in the afternoon or evening. It's just the question of energy and willingness.\n\nI will write now about a short little trip which you can afford even when you're tired, or have only 2-3 hours free. If you're lazy, this trip it's perfect for you, because it doesn't require a long walk, or hiking, still you're out in nature. Just be sure, you have your bus ticket, some water, and the elan for being accompanied by Arnold Schwarzenegger. I bet you didn't know he's styrian.\n\nStep 1: go to Jakominiplatz. Step 2: get on the bus to Gösting (40). Step 3: In Gösting, get on the bus to Thalersee (48). Thal is a little village near Graz, with a beautiful lake, called Thalersee. Thal is also the birthplace of the Terminator. I didn't know this little detail before, and I'm not even a fan of Schwarzenegger, but It rocks, while I could walk in the same forest he usually did when he was young. The path in the forest is also called Arnold Schwarzenegger memorial path.\n\nThalersee is beautiful, grandiose lake. Its water is brown in some places because of the muddy soil and the various minerals it contains. At that parts you can have fun by paddle boating or fishing. In other regions the water is crystal clear and people are bathing, swimming in it. The lake is surrounded by a forest. Chill, relaxing environment. The margin of the lake is perfect for lying down and sunbathing.\n\nAt a moment I found myself faceing an interesting horizontal iron bar suspended between two trees. It was a little explanation near the trees, saying that Arnold came several times in the woods and used this bar for training, doing pull-ups with his friends.\n\nI also found the boat he used to sit in with his girlfriend. Later in this boat he asked her for marrying him. And if you want more, you can visit the Arnold Schwarzenegger museum, located in his own house.\n\nIf you want to enjoy this atmosphere longer, you can sit at the terrace near the lake, try fish specialities and have a refreshing lemonade. You'll definitely love Thalersee.\n\nP. S: Sorry for the quality of the pictures, I'm not a professional photographer.\n\nThank you for reading.\n\nBis später, Dóra.\n\n(If you're interested about more writings of mine, click here).\n\nPhoto gallery"
