Arnie deserted, won the trophy and was thrown into military jail when returning. It was only then, that the senior officers took a closer look at the trophy, which happened to be the top position of Mr. Universe junior! After that, he was officially allowed to train during his year of service.\n\nFrom then on he earned one title after the other. In 1968 he won the International Powerlifting Championship and decided to move to the USA.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger became Mr. Universe twice and Mr. Olympia each year from 1970-75.
