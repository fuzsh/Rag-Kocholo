        "text": "The newsletter, by Arnold Schwarzenegger, is growing by leaps and bounds as people find a voice of reason in Mr. Olympia’s advice. One would think that the mega-successful personality would suggest something unattainable by the fitness community. Although it could not be further from the truth. The Austrian Oak is living up to the promise of making fitness accessible to all through his years of expertise and evidence-based information. In the Monday motivation theme, the ex-Governor of California underscored hidden drivers of achievement.\n\nIn the recent edition of Arnold’s Pump Club newsletter, which has more than 431,000 village members, Arnie bared his soul about outlandish “motivations.” He understands that an individual may not always have lofty dreams of winning a title or losing massive weight. It could be as simple as getting “out of bed” or proving a point to someone. He took the example of Michael Jordan, who could not make the varsity team in his childhood, to drive the point home.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger recollects Michael Jordan’s motivation\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nThe Austrian Oak has spent decades walking the corridors of power in different disciplines. Whatever he touched turned into gold, be it bodybuilding, movies, or politics. However, the fitness icon was also driven by simplistic goals, like impressing girls. “I’ll be honest. Sometimes when I started lifting weights, the goal of being Mr. Austria or Mr. Europe wasn’t enough for me,” explained Arnie. Furthermore, he would think of the teacher who called him a “Neanderthal.” “Every time I got on the tram to go to the stadium in Graz, I saw him telling me I’d never amount to anything,” added the FUBAR actor empathically.\n\nThe Terminator then gave the example of the NBA legend, whose name has become synonymous with basketball. “Absurd goals have driven people since the beginning of time. Michael Jordan became the greatest basketball player of all time because he wanted to prove the coach that cut him in high school wrong.”\n\nRead More: Changing Lives of His 431,000 “Village” Members, Arnold Schwarzenegger Reveals an Interesting Connection Between “Sleep and Dietary Habits”\n\nTo the unversed, the NBA icon traversed a long road to fame. Moreover, Jordan faced a career upset during his sophomore year. His high school coach, Clifton Herring, selected the Chicago Bulls icon’s friends for the team but left Jordan behind. However, the resilient athlete took the challenge in stride. His improvement made Herring take Jordan back into the team. From thereon, there was no looking back for MBJ. Schwarzenegger took the example of an NBA star to show that impetus for greatness can come in any form.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nStart small but maintain consistency, advises Schwarzenegger\n\nThe young boy from Thal, who wanted to impress girls with his physique, broke taboos surrounding motivation and struggles in his Monday newsletter. Additionally, he understands that people are at various points in their life’s journey. He further adds that these covert drivers of success are not “petty.” The 7x Mr. Olympia wrote, “…. they’re kindling. You never light a fire by starting with the biggest log.”\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nNow that the fitness community has the former governor’s stamp of approval to start small, there is no reason to be left behind. Moreover, rather than over-intellectualizing goals, it is better to get moving. Do you agree with Schwarzenegger? Let us know in the comments."
