        "text": "In the iconic opening scenes of Pumping Iron, the ballet instructor putting Arnold and Franco through their paces, points out that it’s the in-between moments of the poses that are just as pertinent as hitting the pose itself.\n\nIt’s a deliberately incongruous scene purposefully crafted and chosen for both audience impact and illustrative of the lessons forthcoming.\n\nThere’s the implication that mastery requires total ownership of one’s craft and highlights that a champion is willing to do whatever it takes to be the best in their field.\n\nIt also demonstrates that the moments on stage are about more than just the mandatory poses — the audience is watching and judging those liminal transitions from one movement to the next.\n\nLikewise, on life’s stage, it’s in not just our resume or achievements, but also those in-between moments that we’re being observed and judged for our actions, choices, and values even when we’re free of the spotlight, and think that no one is watching."
