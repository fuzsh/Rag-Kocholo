        "text": "While Californians were voting on Tuesday, Finance Minister Karl-Heinz Grasser of Austria ended a television interview here about budget deficits and European Union economics with an emphatic ''Good luck to Arnold Schwarzenegger.''\n\nMr. Grasser, like Austrians in general, has been pumped up with pride over Mr. Schwarzenegger's accomplishments. That's the case even though, or maybe because, Arnold Schwarzenegger's life -- from lower-middle-class boy in the bland town of Graz to governor of California -- is as alien to the mentality of the average Austrian as a recall vote is to an Austrian political system in which official careers proceed like clockwork.\n\nMr. Schwarzenegger's career, by contrast, has all the elements that the average Austrian -- with his dreams of a tenured job in the bureaucracy that leads to early retirement, with his love for his 38-hour work week and his five weeks of holiday per year -- would despise: venturing into the unknown, enduring hard work and physical pain, testing the limits of body and mind, and drawing a road map to the top.\n\nOn the other hand, there is enough in Governor Schwarzenegger that Austrians can recognize and admire, or so they think: a touch of machismo, a moving admiration of one's mother, a bit of a sly dog, a cheeky view of the country's Nazi past, and generally what is known in Austria as ''Schm√§h,'' inadequately translatable as ''patter.''\n\nSo the hype here around California's recall was understandable, but there is something else at work, too. The frenzy is a result, at least in part, of one of the main features of the Austrian national character: the art of transference.\n\nIn Vienna in 1972, Austrians held their biggest demonstration since the Allies ended their occupation. The cause was not an end to the arms race or any of the other usual issues of the era. Instead, they were protesting the expulsion of the alpine ski champion Karl Schranz from the Olympic Games in Japan for violating his amateur status. Schranz was supposed to be our hero, winning gold medals for Austria. His being barred from certain success brought an outpouring of frustration by his countrymen, who perceived themselves as victims of dark international forces.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
