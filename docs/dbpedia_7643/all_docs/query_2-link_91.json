        "text": "LEWISTON, Idaho — A 9-foot-tall statue depicting Arnold Schwarzenegger at the height of his bodybuilding career has received a final critique by the former Mr. Universe before being sent for bronzing.\n\nThe former California governor who recently announced his return to acting visited northern Idaho on Wednesday to suggest a few modifications to the clay sculpture. It’s destined to stand in a rippling, full-flex pose outside his childhood home, which is now a museum in Thal, Austria.\n\nSchwarzenegger first commissioned Lewiston artist Ralph Crawford in the 1970s to create a small bronze that became a trophy for a fitness event. Other commissions followed, including the most recent.\n\n“(Crawford) has been known in the physique world as a Rodin,” said Schwarzenegger, referring to famed French sculptor Auguste Rodin. “Everything is very dramatic.”\n\nSchwarzenegger noted Crawford’s passion and his ability to sculpt accurate proportions when it comes to veins, muscle separation and head position.\n\nHe also said he appreciates Crawford’s method, taking months to create a sculpture.\n\n“It’s the old-fashioned way you work,” he told the Lewiston Tribune. “Work like hell. That’s part of the charm. There’s not a magic studio.”\n\nHe said he chose a bodybuilding pose because that’s what launched his career in the United States.\n\n“It was the bodybuilding that got me to America, that got me into movies, that got me the governorship,” he said. “That’s where I learned about reaching out and helping other people.”\n\nSchwarzenegger was born in 1947 in the village of Thal, just outside Graz, where he began his bodybuilding career. He emigrated to the United States in 1968 and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1984 but has retained his Austrian citizenship.\n\nHe said his childhood home where the statue will stand is a two-story building that has been restored to what it was like when he was a boy. That means it has no running water, electric wiring runs on the outside of walls, and an outhouse and primitive gym are outside.\n\nSchwarzenegger said that when he lived there and his family bathed, his mother went first, then his father, then his older brother, and then him. He said the water was black by the time it was his turn.\n\nHe said as a child he was frightened by paintings on the walls of the house that showed knights with swords and axes. His parents had them painted over.\n\n“Maybe that’s what gave me the idea of doing ‘Conan the Barbarian,'” he said.\n\nCrawford, 77, said he has already started work on a new sculpture of Schwarzenegger depicting him during his time as governor.\n\nWhile visiting Crawford, Schwarzenegger toured the artist’s home, admiring other bronzes Crawford had created of American Indians and signing autographs for Crawford’s children and grandchildren.\n\n——"
