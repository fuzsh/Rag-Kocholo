        "text": "Born in Graz, Austria in 1947, at age 15 Arnold Schwarzenegger rebelled against the wishes of this father, a stern police chief, and chose bodybuilding over a career as a professional soccer player. After winning the Junior Mr. Europe title, he arrived in the US in 1968, billed as the “The Austrian Oak.” Billed as “Arnold Strong,” Schwarzenegger made his film debut as the star of the low-budget Hercules in New York (1970). He gained worldwide notice in Conan the Barbarian (1982) and in the sequel Conan the Destroyer (1984). Throughout the '80s, he appeared in a string of box-office hits: The Terminator (1984), Commando (1985), Raw Deal (1986), Predator (1987), The Running Man (1987), and Red Heat (1988). He turned to comedy with his roles in Twins (1988) and Kindergarten Cop (1990). Throughout the '90s and early 2000s, he continued to star in action films and comedies, most of them box office hits, including: Total Recall (1990), Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991), Last Action Hero (1993), Junior (1994), True Lies (1994), Batman and Robin (1997), Collateral Damage (2002), and Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003)."
