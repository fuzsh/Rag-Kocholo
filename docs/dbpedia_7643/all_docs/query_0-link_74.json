        "text": "It was roughly three A.M., and the first lady of California was on a private jet hurtling over the red states on her way from New York to Los Angeles, showing not the slightest hint of fatigue. “The very future of the Republican Party is up for grabs,” Maria Shriver said. “There is a great analogy that someone gave me for Arnold: The Republican Party is the stern father. The Democratic Party is the permissive parent. Arnold has taken the strength of both parents. People say to me, ‘I can’t vote for a Republican,’ but I say, ‘Why not?’ People get so caught up with labels.” At first it was hard to believe that these words came from the very famous daughter of the iconic family of Democrats who invented modern entertainment politics.\n\nIt was clear that she understood, as did her husband, that America was not red or blue but full of complexities. Curled up in gray cashmere sweats, with a jumbo bag of Lite Popcorn at her feet, she had arranged the flight so that she could be home in Brentwood in time to get her children to school. Even at that late hour her gaze was piercing. She has a mane of dark hair that reaches her shoulders, and her cheekbones are less angular than they appear on TV. Her natural excitability has marked her forehead with fine lines that she has done nothing to erase. Hours earlier she had been honored by the Alzheimer’s Association for her work in calling attention to the disease her father, Sargent Shriver, the founding director of the Peace Corps, suffers from. It had been an evening of political urgencies and heightened emotions. Maria, resplendent in navy lace, had described her father’s struggles with Alzheimer’s, and those of many others, including Ronald Reagan. Around me, in the grand ballroom of the Waldorf-Astoria hotel, many people were visibly moved. Later, in her suite, we had watched the election debate between John Edwards and Dick Cheney, and all evening there had been conversation about the future of America and scientific research in a retro time, when the current administration had caused many to believe that the country was sliding backward to the era of William Jennings Bryan. That night on the plane, Shriver’s focus was, as it often is, on families, on working mothers, and on what political power can do to enlarge the individual’s possibilities in society. The larger questions were implicit: How would her husband, Arnold Schwarzenegger, the 38th governor of California, be able to influence state and national politics? How did their bipartisan marriage actually work?\n\nCalifornia’s astonishing stem-cell-research initiative would provide a useful lens. Almost two years earlier, Shriver told me, she had begun to educate herself on the potential of stem-cell research to improve her father’s condition. She and Arnold, who was in the middle of shooting Terminator 3, were at a dinner with the director Jerry Zucker and his wife, Janet. The possible benefit of stem-cell research for the Zuckers’ daughter’s juvenile diabetes had become their passion, shared by their close friends the producers Lucy Fisher and Doug Wick. Soon after that, Maria had lunch with Nancy Reagan to talk about what stem-cell research could do for Alzheimer’s and 70 other diseases. It was difficult for her to imagine then, she said, at the height of her career as an NBC news anchor, that her growing understanding could have an effect on keeping California, and for that matter America, at the necessary forefront of scientific research. As we flew across the country, Californians were debating a ballot initiative that could change the course of medical history. They would soon vote on a $3 billion plan that could potentially poach scientists from Memorial Sloan-Kettering and Harvard for laboratories, universities, and biotech centers across California. There was an atmosphere of extreme tension surrounding the initiative. Schwarzenegger, a Republican, could not campaign actively for it without hitting the propeller blade of his future in Karl Rove’s party, but his endorsement, Jerry Zucker told Maria, was crucial for it to pass. “He was worried that Arnold was going to pull away from it. There were meetings and more meetings,” she told me.\n\nIn the end, Proposition 71 passed with almost 60 percent of the vote. “This is not the way any rational nation should organize its support of scientific research,” a New York Times editorial titled “California to the Rescue” declared on November 5. The underlying message of the editorial was clear. In the days after the election, as progressive Democrats worried about their party and the future of the world, the most far-fetched of all movie scenarios was on the verge of becoming a reality—a former bodybuilder from Graz, Austria, could shape the course of American politics.\n\nSchwarzenegger’s election had appeared to be a harmonic convergence of political fortuities, but it was in fact a triumph of persona politics, long in the planning, which had generated headlines around the world. As a movie-star candidate, he captured the imagination of the public not with an original philosophy, as Reagan once had, but with his calm assumption that “by his very Arnoldness, his very Terminatorness, he could cut through the self-serving culture of the governing class in Sacramento,” according to former Reagan speechwriter Peggy Noonan. It was easy to mock his first days in office. Before arriving in the capital in November 2003, he had made plans to ship his massive Conan the Barbarian sword to decorate the Ronald Reagan Cabinet Room, and he had ordered boxes of his autobiography, Arnold: The Education of a Bodybuilder, to give out as souvenirs. He seemed to understand that his career as a superhero had become fixed in the global imagination, and that a trade representative from Osaka arriving to do business with the governor would be charmed by a book with young Arnold, bare-chested, on the cover.\n\nWhen Schwarzenegger announced his run for governor, in the summer of 2003, California was on the edge of financial collapse. The approval rating for Governor Gray Davis hovered at 26 percent, and that for the state legislature stood even lower, at 23 percent. California is one of 18 states that allow for a recall of an elected official; all that is required there is a petition submitted by l2 percent of the people who voted in the last election for that office. This recall, financed in large measure by a Gray Davis foe, Republican congressman Darrell Issa, was only the second to succeed in U.S. history. The old parties were clearly moribund, and California had become a fusion state, with a heavily Democratic base and constituencies ranging from a powerful religious right to an influential force in the biotech business, to the lucrative entertainment industry.\n\nJust inside the marble entrance of the capitol were diorama cases showing the vastness of the state Schwarzenegger now governed—the wine country, the deserts, the mountains and timberlands, Hollywood, Silicon Valley, and the farmlands, which together make the state the fifth-largest economy in the world. In Schwarzenegger’s first trips to Sacramento, Sheryl Main, a press aide with him for a decade in Hollywood, noticed layers of dust on the models of farmers in the Mendocino County case and was appalled that everything looked as if it hadn’t been cleaned in 20 years. In the last decade there had been a collapse of the dot-coms, an energy crisis that had brought to light shady deals with such companies as Enron, brownouts, blackouts, and devastating forest fires. Maria Shriver summed it up: “The state had become a joke.”\n\nDeeply intuitive and a shrewd political insider, Shriver had advised her husband on almost every aspect of his career from the earliest years of their romance, when she helped him with his poses for the Mr. Olympia contest of 1980. During the election, she had worked tirelessly, gathering the best political minds to tutor him, making suggestions to reshuffle his staff, and urging him to polish his understanding of issues close to her Democrat’s heart—the environment, educational reform, women, stem-cell research. As they walked toward his new offices in November 2003, Maria was experiencing a tangle of emotions. However happy she was for her husband’s victory, she was worried, she later told me, because she was hearing ominous noises from her bosses at NBC, where she had worked for nearly 20 years as an anchor on such shows as Dateline and Sunday Today. Because of the potential for conflicts of interest, Arnold’s election would mean the end of her television news career. In a flash, an identity she had cherished would be over because of someone else’s political ambition.\n\nAnd then they came to the wall: it was on a corridor called the horseshoe in the interior offices, and visitors would pause before it to view the putty-faced portraits of all the governors who had presided over California since the gold rush, from Peter Burnett to Pete Wilson. Maria saw it for an instant as a sketch of California’s past, present, and future, as well as of her own future and the future of women. “It was like the world had come to an end,” Arnold told me. “She said, ‘Can you believe this?’ I looked around and saw the governors. She said, ‘Where are the first ladies?’ They said, ‘We don’t have any.’And she said, ‘Then get them up there.’”\n\nFor days Maria had been helping Arnold, making calls, assembling lists for the scramble to fill more than 1,600 jobs in the state government. “There would be something wrong if I didn’t weigh in with my husband, wouldn’t there?” she asked me. “We are a team.” Like her mother, Eunice Shriver, the founder of the Special Olympics, Maria has always been a vortex of action, a magpie of information, a rattler of questions, a collector of people, but unlike her mother, she used to believe, she was at her best as an inside adviser. From the time Arnold first mentioned to her that he might run for governor, Maria said, “I was worried.… I did not like politics. I did not like the all-encompassing part of it. I worried about the kids and what it would do to our lives. I was, like, Why?” The situation became, she said, a replay of her childhood—the crowds of people in her living room when her uncles Jack, Bobby, and Teddy Kennedy planned their runs for president, and when her beloved father, Sargent Shriver, made his own run for the Democratic presidential nomination. Here it was again, she said, the invasion of her privacy, the nightmare of around-the-clock schedulers, the quixotic demands of voters, the pain of rejection, the anxieties over scandals and violence, and the intrusion on the education of her four children, Katherine, 15, Christina, 13, Patrick, 11, and Christopher, 7. She said she was afraid that everything she had worked so hard for was “now out of my control.” Her close friend Oprah Winfrey told her, “This is going to give you a chance to right what you did not like in your childhood. Deal with it.”\n\nIn the days we spent together, Maria often used the word “struggle” in our conversations. She mentioned significant books that she has read and reread—inspirational works including Gift from the Sea, by Anne Morrow Lindbergh, which extols self-reflection, and the writings of Joan Chittister, a Benedictine nun who teaches, Maria says, “that the worst things in her life turned out to be the best things.” She also sought advice from her father, who until recently sent her articles and books on theology, underlined and annotated. When CBS anchor Lesley Stahl interviewed Maria for 48 Hours, she noticed that she was carrying a canvas shopping bag filled with articles, including one on the need for forgiveness. Maria consults with her priest and her close friends and advisers, including her mother, with whom she speaks several times a day. She churns with ideas and questions, and is constantly telling her husband what this one said or what that one thought, sometimes until late at night. An exasperated Arnold tells me, “It is unbelievable. I have to say to her, ‘Maria, please, I need some sleep.’”\n\nOnce in Sacramento, Maria found that the door of the office of the first lady was marked “Special Projects.” She says she went into a swivet. “It was as basic as this: I am not a special project.” She remembered something her predecessor, Sharon Davis, had told her: “I worked at this job 24-7,” conducting book drives for schools and entertaining legislators. Yet there was no picture of Sharon Davis on that wall in the hall. Maria told me, “I got into the car and I thought to myself, You are cooked.”\n\nShe turned to another former first lady of California, Nancy Reagan, with whom she speaks frequently. “I need your advice. What am I supposed to do?”\n\n“Do whatever you want,” Nancy Reagan told her. “Because no matter what you do, you will be criticized.”\n\nMaria came up with a plan. “I wanted to make visible the role I now had … and to give an identity to the 17 million women of California. I wanted to know who they were, where they were going.… I wanted to know who I was in this new role.”\n\nFrom the moment Arnold was elected she was constantly bombarded with advice—at the supermarket, on the phone, in strolls down Montana Avenue, in her Brentwood neighborhood. “It was: Don’t be like Hillary … Be like Hillary … What are you going to wear? … How are you going to be involved? … Don’t get too involved … Be like Jackie … Don’t be too much like Jackie … I hope you are going to move to Sacramento … Don’t move to Sacramento … I hope you are going to be political … Don’t be too political … I hope you are going to keep your job … Don’t keep your job … You better keep your job!”\n\nShe telephoned her cousin Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg. “What is my issue?,” Maria later recalled asking her. Caroline told her, “Having one issue for the first lady is such an old-fashioned idea. No one ever says to Arnold, ‘You have to have a single issue.’” But Maria needed a project, and soon she found it. A few blocks from the statehouse was the California State History Museum, a neglected building in dire need of refurbishment. The trustees asked Maria for help. She recalls the scene. She told them, “‘Why don’t we do an exhibit on the remarkable women of California?’They said, ‘We can get that going next year.’ And I said, ‘No, we can get that up next month.’”\n\nThere were soon meetings on every conceivable issue. Although the California League of Conservation Voters recently issued a report sharply critical of Republican legislators’ and Schwarzenegger’s environmental record, the governor has supported California’s adoption of the country’s first automotive-greenhouse-gas regulation. Two months later Schwarzenegger signed three bills that would crack down on cruise-ship pollution near the coast. Meetings with economic advisers George Shultz, Milton Friedman, and Warren Buffett were held in the Schwarzeneggers’ house, in Brentwood, where a monumental LeRoy Neiman portrait of Arnold, as nude as the David, commands a towering wall in the entrance hall of the 11,000-square-foot Spanish-style mansion. The portrait and the meetings were sure signs that the new governor’s policies were not going to come from any previous political playbook.\n\nSince 1911, Californians have had the right to pass laws by voting for ballot initiatives on all kinds of issues—taxes, education, high-stakes casino gambling on reservations. These issues go by numbers—for instance, the notorious Proposition 13, of 1978, which severely lowered property taxes and contributed to the state’s economic crisis.\n\nSchwarzenegger is trying to clean up decades of fiscal abuse. His technique is a variation on the traditional hide-the-ball strategy of political economics. The potential of the $3 billion stem-cell proposal has thrilled progressive Democrats, but it could cost future generations of taxpayers $6 billion through the sale of tax-exempt state bonds. There is no secret to solving a debt crisis, Schwarzenegger’s critics claim. “We already know how far celebrity and charm and a wee hint of reprisal can take him,” says Marty Kaplan, director of the Norman Lear Center at the University of Southern California’s Annenberg School for Communication and a former speechwriter for Walter Mondale. “His biggest victory so far was a bond issue to postpone the day of reckoning on the state’s huge structural deficit. Charm won’t be enough to close it—he’s going to have to cut services or raise taxes or both, and he’ll need to spend his popularity on convincing voters and legislators that it’s the only way to get out of the fiscal hole we have dug for ourselves.”\n\nIt is no longer surprising to see photos of Governor Schwarzenegger like the one that appeared recently in The New York Times, in shirt and tie, sitting at his desk, with the American flag behind his head. He is way beyond those first awkward days, when he had to rely on such Terminator clichés as “I’ll be back” to rouse the crowds. Now the hard, dull work of dealing with the hundreds of bills that come before a hidebound legislature has to be attended to. He has one of the highest veto rates of any California governor in the past 30 years, having stopped 311 of the 1,270 bills sent to him. He has tried to control spending in the state-university system by doing an end run around the legislature and striking a deal with university officials to raise tuition by an average of 10 percent. The overt theme of his politics is self-reliance and a free-market philosophy. But how free a market? At the end of last year’s legislative session, Schwarzenegger vetoed a bill that would have helped Californians—including four million who cannot afford prescription-drug coverage—to buy discounted Canadian imports. For many, his veto represented the power of the big drug companies, from which, according to state records, Schwarzenegger received more than $300,000 once he announced his candidacy.\n\nThe governor lives in a suite in the Hyatt Regency Hotel, across from the capitol. “Arnold keeps his shoes in a box in the Hyatt. It is crazy,” Maria said, reminding me that her father had once been the U.S. ambassador to France. “I told my mother, ‘At least Daddy took you to Paris to a mansion. Arnold is in the Hyatt.’”\n\nLegislators who come to see the governor in the Ronald Reagan Cabinet Room or in the canvas tent he has erected in a private courtyard are occasionally treated to demonstrations with the Conan the Barbarian sword. He has been known to jump up from the conference table in meetings and brandish it dramatically to show how he will “cut the budget” of California.\n\nGold’s Gym, 1976. There was Arnold, filming Pumping Iron in a grimy weight room in Venice, California. The walls were decorated with blueprints of railroad cars. He was virtually unknown except as a cult figure in bodybuilding. George Butler, a hustling young producer-director, was making the documentary, a project that seemed mainly voyeuristic in that post-Vietnam period, but one in which future historians may see the tectonic plates of that era’s culture shifting abruptly to the self-regard of the Me Decade. Butler took every young reporter he met to the gym to stare at the freakishly muscled import from Austria. Long before reality TV, Butler had a clear sense of the future. Pumping Iron would become a classic, featuring Schwarzenegger as a young Mr. Olympia trying to move on to the next chapter. He didn’t show a whiff of awareness that he was being viewed with some degree of ridicule. Was it a lack of subtlety, or did he just not give a damn? “We would walk down the street,” Butler says, “and Arnold was stared at rudely. People would point at him and make disgusting comments. He was never discouraged by it.”\n\nSoon Arnold started investing in apartment buildings, and, however vulgar he may have appeared by conventional standards, his gaze was fixed on a distant plain. California in 1976 was in the thrall of Werner Erhard, the founder of Erhard Seminars Training, or est, who was conducting be-what-you-can-be seminars. Butler was fascinated by Arnold’s grandiose predictions for his future, and he now says he always knew that his discovery would become a symbol of the self-actualization movement. As California historian Kevin Starr says, “Gold’s Gym was Arnold’s Harvard and Yale.”\n\nThe following year Arnold was on the beach at Cannes, alone, waiting for Pumping Iron to be screened. The Belgian publicist Yanou Collart spotted him as she was posing dancers from the Crazy Horse in Laura Ashley dresses. Schwarzenegger was eager to make conversation, so Collart asked him, “Would you like to be in this picture?” “Of course,” he said. “He stood up and posed with two girls on his arms and two around his waist. I invited him to lunch,” Collart recalled. “What are your ambitions?” she asked him. “I will be the top actor in America,” he said. “Well, you are going to have to erase your accent,” Collart told him. Arnold smiled. “I will. And one day I will be president of the United States.”\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger has never shown the slightest insecurity about his life or his loyalties; some of his cronies today were with him in his bodybuilding days. A few years before Richard Nixon died, Schwarzenegger visited the disgraced president, and during one public appearance Nixon called him up to the stage. Schwarzenegger saluted Nixon’s politics, as he would again at last year’s Republican convention. Later, in Nixon’s office, the former president, who had resigned from public office rather than face impeachment for Watergate, said to him, “You know, you should think about politics. You have good instincts—how you connect with people.” Schwarzenegger told me, “He said it out of nowhere. I was ecstatic.” A few years later his in-laws were less ecstatic when he brought up Nixon in conversation. Eunice Shriver blanched, Arnold told me, and Sarge told him, “He is not an honest man.”\n\nLong before entering politics, Schwarzenegger capitalized on his own story, tamping down any negative publicity with canny strategies such as buying up photos of shoots with nude women he had done when he was very young. He asked Rabbi Marvin Hier, founder of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles, to investigate his father’s Nazi past and became a major donor to Hier’s ambitious expansion projects. More recently he became the executive editor of muscle magazines owned by American Media, which also publishes The National Enquirer and the Star. As pointed out by Connie Bruck in The New Yorker, these tabloids, which had previously found Schwarzenegger to be a worthy subject, were “virtually free of negative stories about him” during the campaign. As governor, his first official trip was to Israel, where he was greeted by crowds in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem.\n\nIn his speech at the Republican convention, Schwarzenegger used his life as a template for the Über-Republican message of self-determination: “To think that a once scrawny boy from Austria could grow up to become governor of the state of California … and speak on behalf of the president of the United States—that is an immigrant’s dream.” Schwarzenegger spun a tale of seeing Soviet tanks on the street—it turned out to be untrue—and he spoke convincingly about the history of the “Soviet boot,” a term that could have come from a Ronald Reagan speech.\n\nBackstage, before Schwarzenegger went out to the podium, Republican staffers had been startled to see him give a flawless performance of the speech, then repeat it exactly minutes later. “That was nothing,” he said when I asked him about it. “I rehearse like that with everything I do. I had already rehearsed it dozens of times.” Schwarzenegger rarely speaks spontaneously with reporters except to make jokes. He said he had worked with a special coach the night before, “who talked to me about tone, moving from a 6 to a 10, how to modulate my voice so that I would start at a low and build to a high. For me it is like reps.”\n\nArnold’s run for office happened quite suddenly, or so it appeared. He announced his “surprise” candidacy on the Jay Leno show, and word circulated that even his media advisers were caught with the wrong press release. The groundwork for his political ascent had been laid long before he decided to run. George Skelton, of the Los Angeles Times, who has been based in Sacramento since the Reagan days, got his first call from Schwarzenegger in 2001. “I am sitting at my desk one day. I had written a column about Pete Wilson, and suddenly here was Arnold Schwarzenegger on the telephone. ‘I really like your column,’ he said. I told him I would like to interview him sometime, and he said, ‘Why don’t you come to these afterschool programs I am running?’” The following month he started to explore a race for the governorship, but he was sidetracked when Garry South, a political consultant for Gray Davis, informed the media about a sensational cover story in Premiere magazine, “Arnold the Barbarian,” which detailed allegations of Schwarzenegger’s sexual misconduct as reported by a number of women, going back to his earliest Hollywood days.\n\nHis campaign soon became a crusade to finance Proposition 49, which would create afterschool programs for kids. Schwarzenegger spent $1 million of his own money on the campaign. “A year later he had this initiative going,” Skelton said. “I was impressed. He was able to break through the accent. He was not throwing out cheap one-liners like ‘girlie men’ or ‘Terminate them!’ when it was one-on-one.” For Skelton, Schwarzenegger’s vaunted star power was still a pale imitation of Reagan at his peak. “After Reagan got elected, every major network affiliate had a bureau in Sacramento, and Reagan gave a weekly press conference to push his agenda. Not this administration. They have an attitude straight out of Politics 101—stay on message.” Schwarzenegger, however, knows how to make alliances. Skelton’s daughter, Karen, a political veteran of the Clinton White House, has been hired to help Maria Shriver with the annual state women’s forum, in Long Beach. “My daughter and I disagree about him all the time,” Skelton told me.\n\nThe recall campaign lasted three months and featured a crowd of 135 candidates, including TV actor Gary Coleman, journalist Arianna Huffington, Hustler- magazine publisher Larry Flynt, and Mary Carey, a porn star. During the campaign Schwarzenegger turned up his comic vulgarity; he was the strongman in shades and a Hummer. Like Reagan, he had a commanding voice, but he spoke without nuance, in the kind of sound bites and short sentences that have come to define modern political speech. As governor, he soon achieved a 65 percent approval rating, and his first year was such a honeymoon that people started talking about him as a potential president. “Why not?” he told Morley Safer on 60 Minutes. For Schwarzenegger it would simply be a matter of amending the Constitution so that a foreign-born citizen could inhabit the White House. Just as he did on the beach in Cannes almost 30 years ago, Schwarzenegger is putting it out there. But Maria is not so sure. “Forget about it. It is not going to happen,” she told me. “The process takes years, and this is as far as it goes.” I asked if she thought there should be an amendment. “Absolutely,” she said. “America is a nation of immigrants.”\n\nThere is an internal drama in play here, enigmatic and, like the couple themselves, so unfathomable that no outsider can penetrate it. Maria has helped Arnold in every aspect of his career, and it has not been with the luminous stare of affection that biographer Edmund Morris ascribes to Nancy Reagan as her role in Ronald Reagan’s rise. It has been grinding work—digesting complicated material, analyzing tough issues, parsing diplomatic nuances, tutoring the young man from Graz in the ways and politics of the Shrivers. In Hollywood she attended many meetings, negotiated with agents, read every script. “Arnold does not like to read,” she told me. When he seemed like a political novice on national TV, she assembled experts to coach him, in what his advisers described to Connie Bruck as Schwarzenegger University. She helped find the best speechwriters, starting with Landon Parvin, who wrote his convention speech. “That speech went through 15 drafts, and Maria wrote much of it,” Arnold told me one night. “I did not,” Maria snapped, aware of how such a remark could play nationally, and how it might upset Parvin. Later she admitted, “Well, maybe a few sentences about being honored to live in California.”\n\nMaria has always been far more sensitive than Arnold about how she is perceived. “People have been clawing at me since I was eight years old, coming up to me on the street and saying, ‘I hate your family,’ or ‘I love your family.’ I always understood that all of these projections were about them and never me,” she told me. Early in her life she learned how to make a necessary detachment from the Shakespearean legacy of the Kennedy family. “I have never read one book about the Kennedys. Not one. Everything I needed to know about the family I learned from the family.” After writing her thesis at Georgetown University on the role of religion in her uncle Jack’s race for the presidency, she withdrew from family research. To date there have been more than 1,000 books about the Kennedys and 27 about her husband, ranging from Wendy Leigh’s unauthorized Arnold, which went into detail about Schwarzenegger’s affairs and his father’s Nazi history, to such cultural analyses as Why Arnold Matters and True Myths. The general scope of the books is by now familiar—Arnold’s rise as a bodybuilder with the help of his patron, Joe Weider, whom he is still close to; the allegations of steroid use, which is said to have harmed his heart; and the cases of alleged groping and grabbing of women, which have resulted in tabloid headlines. Schwarzenegger sued one tabloid over material from the Leigh book, and his publicist exacted a promise from interviewers not to mention it. Through all of this, Maria has held herself to an impeccable standard of behavior. “I thought it was extraordinary that Jackie lived and died and never spoke,” she said. “There is a lot to be said for that.”\n\nOn the telephone with me, she carried on a debate with herself concerning our interview: “Why should I do this? I never do anything without knowing the end game. I am in process now—I don’t know what any of this means. To be first lady of California, what is that? I mean, I have 300 requests a week for all kinds of stuff. The only interview I did was with Oprah, who is my best friend. Why do I want to put myself out for this?”\n\nThis is not the first time I have interviewed her. We met in 1985. Her CBS reporting career was relatively new, and so was Vanity Fair. Maria posed for the cover in pink, looking sultry and full of hope. She had worked her way up from Philadelphia and Baltimore TV stations, commuting to be with Arnold on the weekends. The day I interviewed her at home was her father’s 70th birthday, and the house was filled with survivors of Camelot, friends from the Peace Corps, and supporters of Sarge’s tries for vice president, in 1972, and president, in 1976. Maria’s four brothers, Mark, Anthony, Bobby, and Timothy, then ranging in age from 20 to 31, were watching a football game on TV. Through the din, as I reported, a telephone rang, and Maria, in Adidases and a royal-blue dress, rushed to answer it. “Hi, Courtney,” she said to her cousin Courtney Kennedy, Robert and Ethel’s second daughter. Then she yelled, “Mummy! Did Jackie go to the lunch at the Mellons’ today for Charles and Diana?” Getting no answer, she yelled more loudly: “Maaaa!” Then Eunice Shriver appeared, trailing cigar smoke behind her. “I think so,” she said. “You have to know for sure! Courtney needs to know for ABC News!” Maria was as determined as a police reporter on deadline, and Eunice, in that moment, registered both panic and pride—panic at the invasion of Kennedy privacy and pride at her only daughter’s moxie.\n\nAt CBS and later NBC, Maria was known for her tenacity, her seriousness, and her generosity. She would spend days with colleagues such as Dan Abrams reporting stories but rarely mentioning her life as the wife of a superstar. She interviewed Fidel Castro twice, rescheduling one interview so that she could be with her daughter when she started pre-school. She also interviewed Hillary Clinton as she faced the Whitewater crisis, and although the two women were fast friends, Maria’s questions were tough and fair.\n\nShe keeps her private life at a remove, and she is ferociously protective when it comes to her husband, their children, and their friends. She is outwardly exuberant, drawing people to her with the sense of an easy intimacy, but there are areas of her life that are walled off, don’t-go-there zones, and she coldly shuts down the moment she feels a glimmer of invasion. She fears, she told me, anything she cannot control. She resented the title of my 1986 Vanity Fair article: “Growing Up Kennedy.” A recurrent aim of her journalism was to illuminate the struggles of women—the trafficking of Eastern European and Latino women into the U.S. as sex slaves, for example, or women trying to get off welfare, a piece that won her a Peabody award. May be that seriousness, forged in the 1960s, is not completely in sync with an America that has made Donald Trump a hero, Paris Hilton a heroine, and her husband a governor.\n\nA great mystery, for many, has always been what generated the Schwarzenegger-Shriver marriage. For Maria it was a coup de foudre. When she met Arnold, she was 21, but she knew, she says, “immediately. It was instant and physical. I found him attractive, funny, and original. He was independent! He was alone! I traveled everywhere in a pack. I thought in a pack. I acted in a pack. I was part of an umbrella name. I was not original. I was part of ‘Which Kennedy are you?’\n\n“I did not marry the boy next door. I did not want to. People at first were like, ‘You married the other side of the tracks!’ They have trouble with the class thing. You are supposed to live a life that they project onto you.… Everyone assumed that I was supposed to marry someone like a John Kerry, some preppy that had gone to Harvard or Yale. I didn’t want to marry those boys—I did not like them. I had been around them my whole life. I interrupted the story line. I wanted out of that suffocation. I wanted someone different. I married my authentic self. And after all these years we are still engaged with each other, hot for each other, into each other. There hasn’t been a moment when I have been bored. I have worked and worked on my marriage, and it has paid off. All of my friends say, ‘I want what you and Arnold have.’\n\n“When I started going out with him, people were like, ‘What?’ And he was never bothered by that. The thing I admired about him was that he never tried to play it safe. People say to him, ‘You can’t do this or do that.’ He doesn’t care.” Arnold tells me, “This is what she fell in love with—me. This is the way I am—outrageous, out there. And it comes with things that are not all rosy.”\n\n“When I first met him, he talked a lot about visualizations,” says Maria. “He talked to me about where you wanted to be, where you wanted to go.… Arnold wanted to be a star. He wanted to be famous! I thought it was great. Everyone I knew was so serious. It was ‘You can’t do that! You have to be successful.’ Arnold was like an explosion of fresh air. ‘You want to go and do TV? Great! Do it! You have a dream? Go for it. Let’s get a convertible and ride around in it! ‘It wasn’t about saving the world then. Now it is with him. Now I am the one who wants to laugh.”\n\nDuring her first months as first lady, Maria, who was used to the freewheeling world of journalism, felt mired in the frustrations of local politics. “I said, ‘Is there anything a first lady is supposed to do?’ And they said, ‘Well, you light the Christmas tree and you pick out the Christmas ornament.’ And I said, ‘Who pays for the Christmas ornament?’ And they said, ‘You do.’It was like, ‘What?’ I feel that the whole job of being the first lady is so stagnant.… You should cut a ribbon and then go sit in the corner? It is archaic in its concept.” Seeing the wall in the hall in the capitol bereft of first ladies, Maria made advancing the state of women California a primary concern. In planning the Long Beach forum for 10,000 women, she determined to turn the event in to something grander and more important. Oprah would appear, as would some Afghan feminists, and four women would receive the first Minerva Awards, which were modeled on the Presidential Medal of Freedom. She also made plans to refocus the state history museum, replacing dusty exhibits of gold miners with mannequins of California’s great women, from the astronaut Sally Ride to the writer Joan Didion. By the time I arrived in Los Angeles, these projects had caused a flutter of bad publicity. Three trustees had resigned amid accusations that this Kennedy-family interloper was riding roughshod over the museum’s agenda.\n\nIn the hallway of the couple’s grand house, at the top of a hill in Brentwood, is a library table stacked high with books. On the cover of one, by Scott Stossel, is the smiling, elegant face of Maria’s father, Sargent Shriver, looking as youthful as he did when he launched the Peace Corps, a man lit with optimism, inspiration, and a love of family. Several times when we were together, Maria talked about him. “I never felt that he got the credit in history he deserved, the level of seriousness for what he accomplished.” Despite her loyalty to the Kennedys, Maria believes that her legacy is “much more influenced by the Shriver notion of public service.”\n\nIt was made very clear to Sargent Shriver, according to Stossel’s biography, that there would be no place for his political ambitions in the Kennedy brotherhood. He had to put aside his own desires to run for governor of Illinois and campaign for Jack, and many people think that Shriver helped swing Illinois and ensure Kennedy’s victory. After Jack’s assassination, Lyndon Johnson hinted that Shriver could be a potential running mate in 1964. He praised him publicly for his dedication to the Peace Corps and sent him as an emissary to the Pope. There was, Stossel suggests, always calculation behind Johnson’s actions, and in this case it was a desire to be inoculated against Bobby Kennedy’s political aspirations. Soon columnists were speculating that Shriver would be Johnson’s running mate. Walking on the lawn in Hyannis Port one weekend, Bobby demanded of his brother-in-law, “Did you plant this story in the paper?” Shriver told him no, according to Stossel. “Let me make something clear,” Bobby said. “There’s not going to be a Kennedy on this ticket. And if there were, it would be me.”\n\n“I never had a sense of how my father was treated until I was in my 20s,” Maria said. “I would not have dreamed of asking him about it. He is not a man who whines. He is not a person who says, ‘Why not me?’ He loves my mother and knew that she had to be loyal to her brothers.” Soon after Shriver was appointed ambassador to France, in 1968, Bobby sent a message asking him to stay in America and work on his campaign. But Eunice intervened. “We are going to Paris as the ambassadors,” she announced, according to Stossel. In Paris, Eunice laid down tires in the halls of the ambassador’s residence to make obstacle races for mentally retarded children. Maria told me, “When Arnold’s campaign started, I said to myself, ‘I want to get through it without anger.’ Because after my dad’s campaign in 1976, I was mad for a good 10 years. At people who said they were going to help and didn’t. At people who ran the other way. It ended up getting me nowhere. I wanted to keep my kids on track, no matter what happened.”\n\nWhen Arnold ran for governor, he was 56, playing out a successful action-movie career in which he had raked in a reported $30 million for Terminator 3 alone. But he was at the point where staying in the game could turn him into a caricature—Sylvester Stallone headed for Hollywood Squares. Maria told me that she did not want her children to see her father playing violent hit men, so she had pushed Arnold to change his image, playing Danny DeVito’s brainy brother in Twins and an undercover policeman in Kindergarten Cop—both enormously successful with his audience. In those films Schwarzenegger’s light side was suddenly on view.\n\nMaria’s vision of her husband is also on display in the vast bedroom and bathroom they share, in dozens of his carefully framed watercolors of Christmas trees, snowmen, and hearts reminiscent of the work of Jim Dine. Schwarzenegger has a room in the house where he retreats late at night to labor over these meticulous creations, which he paints as gifts for his family. One valentine to Maria, I noticed, had a caption that read in part, “I love you because you love me.”\n\nI catch up with Arnold one day in San Jose, where he is calling on residents to vote against Propositions 68 and 70, which concern the regulation of gambling in the state, including casinos on Indian reservations. A crowd is waiting for him outside the local civic center, as is usually the case wherever he goes. Many of them are carrying photos for him to autograph. The audiences for his “events,” as he calls them, are carefully culled, and Schwarzenegger’s speeches are thoroughly rehearsed. The events are designed like movie promotions, with a flotilla of advance men and a tacit ban on questions from the press. When he was pushing for workers’ compensation reform, he worked the malls. Waiting for Arnold to arrive, I talk to a local reporter. “Welcome to Arnold’s manufactured populism,” he says.\n\nWhen the governor appears, his sculpted hair resembles a hat, staying perfectly in place in the wind. He wears a black flight jacket, as if he just hopped off his Harley-Davidson, with DEFEAT PROPOSITIONS 68 AND 70 stitched on the front in red and blue. Schwarzenegger projects a child’s delight when he is behind a microphone. “The last time I was here, I said, ‘I’ll be back. I will be here with the people!’” he says, repeating the phrase that has become his mantra in the state. “We have to terminate 68 and 70! Let’s say, ‘Hasta la vista, baby!’ Imagine, that we cannot look at these casino books!”\n\nSheryl Main calls to tell me that the governor has finished shooting some promos and can meet me in 45 minutes, if I hurry, at Café Roma, his favorite restaurant in Beverly Hills. When I get there, I see a large Annie Leibovitz photograph of Arnold in combat fatigues in the window of the hairdresser’s salon next to the café. The image of the governor in a pinup pose reminds me of his voyeuristic appeal in the Gold’s Gym days. Inside the café, his table has already been set. The owner says he always likes to have his regular spot. One by one his pals appear—his best friend, who owns a body shop, with his son, followed by the hairdresser neighbor, with spiky hair and tattoos. The governor arrives, wearing the same flight jacket as the day before. Schwarzenegger has often been described as robotic, but in repose his face is unscarred by failure, without the lines you’d expect in a man of his age, almost pretty. The lack of external affect gives him a performer’s unknowability.\n\nWhen he was running for governor, he says, “I was the outsider.… There were 135 candidates. I knew I was the only one who was taken seriously. It was up to me to do what I did in the movies. I had better ideas.… I could get things done.… That was how I campaigned. It all went extremely well. I could get the parties together. The biggest obstacle was the debate. Nobody had ever seen me debate.… They said they wanted me to go into many different debates, but I didn’t.… I said there would be only one.”\n\nAmazingly, he got his way. In fact, the candidates were given the questions in advance in the only debate in which he participated—virtually unheard of in a major election. “They said, ‘You are afraid to debate.’ I said, ‘I will debate in the world’s championship of debates.’ They said, ‘How will you know it is the world championship?’ I said, ‘Watch the ratings. When they debate, it will be the Mr. Venice Beach championships. When I debate, it will be the world championship.’”\n\nAs Arnold was laboring over the questions and rehearsing his answers, he was interrupted. “All of a sudden I got a call from my communications director, Rob Stutzman. He said, ‘The Los Angeles Times wants to do a story. There are six women out there— they say this and this.’” There turned out to be a total of 16 women, who claimed that Schwarzenegger sexually mistreated and humiliated them. As Schwarzenegger describes this, his expression does not change. “I said, ‘Pay no attention to this. This is nonsense.’ I know what is possible that I could have done. I was very much aware that anyone could have come forward and said that I was flirtatious, which I am. That I said and did things which made people feel uncomfortable, which I did. All of these things that they complained about— which was nothing! … Those stories came out, and my poll numbers went up two points!”\n\nThen, he continues, “the next story started, and people realized, ‘Hey, wait, this is an organized campaign.’ And they did not buy into it again. Each time they came out with a story, it helped my campaign! It was just a matter of ‘O.K., keep writing.’”\n\nIt was not quite so simple for Arnold’s intensely private wife. Shriver had entered the imagination of American women through TV. It was difficult for her admirers to see her suddenly forced into the Hillary Clinton strategy, as if the tax to be paid for marriage to a high-octane male had returned her to the legacy of being a Kennedy woman. This could not have been predicted by her childhood, when she had been doted on by her father and her four brothers. “This was painful,” Maria told me. “Flat-out tough, painful, no doubt about it.” I asked her whether a part of her wondered if the stories could be true. “You have to know your own truth,” she said. “You have to know the person in front of you. You have to be able to separate what your reality is, what other people’s perceptions are.… You have to go on with your life. It is your life, your marriage, your experience.”\n\nHow does she cope? “I fight. I think, with everything, it goes back to struggle. You have to struggle in every aspect of your life.”\n\nI asked her what she said to her children. “I did not talk to them about that,” she said. “I would say, ‘People will say things about your father and your mother and your grandmother’s family. Some of it is true, some of it is not true. If you have any questions, you should feel comfortable to talk to me about it. A lot of it is politically motivated. A lot of it is stuff your father did when he was 21 or 22. You need to know your father is a good man and is doing his best to help people.’ During the campaign I kept the TV off, kept the newspapers away. I took them to the Cape and got them out of this thing.”\n\nThe story broke the day Maria hit the road with Arnold on a four-day bus tour of the state, during which he publicly apologized. “Wherever there is smoke there is fire,” he said. “I learned my lesson,” he told me. “I had several harassment lessons.… I know now what can be said and what can’t be said.… Now I would not even tell someone I like their outfit. It could go south.”\n\nMaria found herself saying to thousands of strangers up and down the state, “Who do you believe? Them or me? I am with this man, and it is for a reason.” In the end, nothing the press came up with had any influence on voters, including the women voters, 43 percent of whom voted for Schwarzenegger. California was in search of a myth, and they found it in a hero they were familiar with from the magic of the movies. At a rally in the capital, Arnold waved a broom and declared that he would “clean house” in California, thereby planting an irresistible image. At his inauguration, he spoke about his origins. “I came here with absolutely nothing,” he said, “and gained absolutely everything.”\n\nSometimes, around Arnold and Maria, it is possible to hear the positive thinking of the self-help movement, affirmations from Dr. Phil’s book Self Matters. Maria has even managed to turn certain traumatic events in her life into best-selling books for young people, including What’s Happening to Grandpa?, to teach children about Alzheimer’s, What’s Heaven?, to answer children’s questions about death, and Ten Things I Wish I’d Known Before I Went Out into the Real World, a book for college graduates in which she talks about, among other things, getting over the pain of being fired from her job as a morning co-anchor with CBS news. She told me it was much more difficult, 18 years later, to accept her forced retirement from NBC. She said about her work, “I wanted to do stories—that was my whole thing. I thought TV was the place where people formed their opinions.” After Arnold was elected, she got a call from NBC news head Neal Shapiro. “He said, ‘Extend your leave.’Then I went back for a month. There was an article in the paper saying I was politically involved, and it went downhill from there .… I had been in TV a long time. I knew what a conflict was. I knew what my integrity was. I said, ‘We can work this out.’They said no.”She wound up in a trailer finishing a one-hour special on Siegfried and Roy, with NBC Studios, the network’s entertainment division. “NBC Studios?” Maria said. “I mean, from a trailer. What was that?”In spite of her frustration, her timing turned out to be lucky.”What would I be doing now? I would be on the Scott Peterson trial. Or Michael Jackson. That is what the L.A. bureau does. It would have been all the time trash. How do you then explain to your kids that is what you did?” Arnold, she said, told her, “This is ridiculous. Move on.”\n\nJoan Didion once wrote about her state, “The future always looks good in the golden land, because no one remembers the past.” When I asked Arnold what had become of the commission he said he would convene to investigate the accusations made against him, he answered, “I said I would hire my own investigator to find out why these women had come and said all of this. Were they tricked into it?” He added, “Of course, when you get into office, you have five weeks to put your team together to run the state, so it was the last thing I thought of.”\n\nA few days later Maria articulated things differently. “If we continue to discuss it, we just keep it out there. No one has the right to bring up these subjects. They are private matters.” Her tone was far less even than Arnold’s. “I have never met anyone whose marriage is like anyone else’s. What is a normal marriage? … I am proud of my marriage. I am proud of who Arnold is. That is his story. I am like, ‘What is my story?’ I can only be responsible in the end for how I handle myself.… People come out, yak, yak, yak. I am not interested in he-said-she-said-they-said. I learned that in high school. It doesn’t get you anywhere.” Maria understands the larger truth as well as the great paradox—that of all the men in her celebrated family her husband is the one poised now to take the national stage.\n\nWhen Maria met Arnold, she was locked in the grid of her family. “That is why I call the family clones,” Arnold said. “Everyone in the family thinks exactly the same. If her mother says it is green, it is green. If her father says it is black, it is black. When you are in the family, you think this is normal, and then you meet someone from the outside and the lights go on. Here was a guy who was free.… If he wants to be a Republican, he is a Republican. If he wants to be a movie star, he is a movie star.… When Bobby Shriver got his apartment, he asked us to come and help him. I said, ‘I can see the walls already—forest green with hardwood floors.’ I said, ‘Don’t do it unless it is your favorite color.’ He said, ‘Can you believe it, Maria? I don’t know what my favorite color is.’He was upset about it. Maybe because he was always told what his favorite color ought to be.”\n\nThis, Arnold explained, was the reason “a lot of them split and came out here. Bobby came out here and found himself. Maria got away. Timmy went to Connecticut. Anthony went to Miami.” It was clear, Arnold suggested, that Maria had learned some lessons watching her father be overshadowed in the Kennedy family. “He was such a humble man and was so in love with Eunice, who was so involved in the Kennedy family in a deep way.… He never really had his day to emerge as a leader, because he was always asked by Ted or Jack to work for them. Eventually there is a time when one says, ‘I have to have my own goal.’ Maria and I could be part of a different unit, not the Kennedy unit or the Shriver unit.”\n\nSchwarzenegger has emerged as a full-bore possibility to lead the national Republican Party in the future. However, he has a very tricky path to navigate, for—putting the constitutional problem aside—the party is under the fierce influence of Karl Rove and Ralph Reed. It has become fashionable to call Schwarzenegger a Rockefeller Republican, but even Rockefeller, outside New York, had very little political capital.\n\nSchwarzenegger has become, for many, a fusion candidate from a fusion state, but within the inner sanctum of their family, there has been no discernible shift by Maria to the Republican view of things. “In the beginning I know there was some concern about me,” she said. “‘Is she going to pull him to the left? Is she trying to make him a Democrat?’ I was like, ‘Should I stay in the background?’ Arnold was like, ‘She is my partner. She is involved with everything.’ He was the one who put me out there. In the beginning it was pillow talk. Arnold was like, ‘You know what? We are in this together.’”\n\nThe plane is waiting at Teterboro, in New Jersey, to take us back to Los Angeles, and Maria rushes to change in the Waldorf on the night of the Cheney-Edwards debate. Her mother is at her side, with her arm around her—it is as if they share a single skin. “Turn on the debate,” Eunice Shriver says in the hotel suite, and suddenly there are Cheney and Edwards filling the screen. A hush comes over the room. This scene has been played and replayed in this family on innumerable occasions. “In my family, everything is about politics,” Maria tells me later. And here it is, the tension of Democrats fervently hoping for some sign that will sway the country their way. The Kerrys are close friends, and Maria has been saying that she would advise him to loosen the tie, be easier in his skin. The quiet in the room speaks volumes. After hearing Cheney talk about education, Eunice stands up in frustration—Jack Kennedy’s favorite sister and a political savant at 83. “There is such a disparity in everything he is saying and what is true on these education figures,” she says, and begins to reel off the numbers.\n\nIn the car on the way to the airport, Maria talks once more about her father. “I was home a few months ago, and he said, ‘Look at you. You are incredible.’ And then he analyzed each one of my features and said, ‘Those cheekbones! The way you talk about issues! But be careful, Maria, you could overwhelm men that you meet.’”\n\nIt is an October night in Brentwood, and the governor is coming from a fund-raiser at the estate of a mall king, where he has given a version of the stump speech I heard in San Jose, and where he has raised $1 million. He will tell me that he sees no possibility of any potential conflicts of interest in that. “I cannot be bought,” he likes to say. We are meeting at an Italian restaurant on San Vicente. Having arrived early, I can watch the room vibrate, the ions change, when Schwarzenegger enters. Maria is with him, and for the first time she looks tired from the endless hard work of politics, of being on display, away from her family, on political Code Red for any deviation from message.\n\nI say to Arnold, “Put California in a national context for me—if California were its own nation, and if you were the president of California.”\n\n“Don’t go there, Arnold,” Maria says quickly, lightly.\n\n“It is not a trick question,” I say. “Frame the state in national politics.”\n\n“Don’t go there,” Maria repeats, less lightly.\n\nArnold weighs in anyway, and speaks about the state as a country. “It is always kind of out there … great ideas, innovations, with the entertainment business all about creation.… You can see politically it does not fall in with the rest of the country.… The Republicans don’t even come here [to campaign].… They think it is all for Kerry.”\n\nA few moments pass, then Maria amends Arnold’s remark, shapes it into a better sound bite. “I think what Arnold is talking about is that Californians are at the forefront of where the country is going. I think the rest of the world looks at California and is fascinated, not just by the idea of California but how California is now governing itself. All Europeans want to know about is Arnold!” She talks about the 22 million registered American women who do not vote, about reform issues, about education issues. While Maria talks, Arnold looks down, curiously disengaged, deferring to her, not bothering to stay in the conversation, as if he understands that her grasp of certain issues is much more honed than his.\n\nThe subject returns once more to Maria’s idea about having to struggle, and Arnold looks at his wife with an expression that comes close to exasperation. “Who needs to search?” he says. “It is not searching,” she says tersely. “It is reading and applying lessons to your own life.” She mentions Joan Chittister and the abrupt change in her life when her Catholic order called her back. “It wasn’t what she wanted,” she says. “It wasn’t what she planned.” There is anger, I notice, under Maria’s tone, as if Chittister’s story were, perhaps, hers as well. Arnold looks at her, perplexed. “I am so confused with all these different theories and stories,” he says. “Life lessons,” Maria corrects him. “I understand,” he says, trying to change the subject. And then, as Maria looks at him with a surprising intensity, Schwarzenegger’s look changes from one of detachment on Planet Marriage to one of connection, as if the light has come on. It is, in this unscripted moment, possible to see the charge between them, his admiration for her complexities, her passion for the imponderables. The tension at the table immediately vanishes.\n\nI follow the couple out to the street. Arnold carries a piece of banana-cream pie the owner of the restaurant has given him to take home. Here is the new bipartisan marriage, husband and wife laughing together, on Wilshire Boulevard, Arnold’s public mask having fallen away. “Maria and her mother and her grandmother are so cheap!” he says. “If I didn’t buy her clothes she wouldn’t spend anything.”\n\nAt first, people in Brentwood said, Maria was astonished by Arnold’s announcement that he would run. “That is ridiculous,” she tells me. “Nobody was privy to our discussions! We went over it in the morning. We went back and forth and back and forth. In the final days, I was encouraging him.” Another time she says, “My mother said, ‘You cannot hold him back. This is what I had to do for your father.’” Days later, Arnold is again making jokes at her expense at another state forum: “After my speech at the Republican convention, there was no sex for 14 days.” They also say in Brentwood that Maria refused right up until the end to go to the convention with him, as if politics would keep her away from her husband’s great moment. “This was my reality,” she explains. “I was not at the Republican convention. I was there to support my husband.”\n\nOne night during the most vicious election season in recent American history, Maria Shriver was on the telephone. The next day would be her 49th birthday, she told me, and she was hobbling around on crutches. In the first inning of the opening game of the World Series, Shriver had leapt off a sofa when David Ortiz cracked a three-run homer to put the Boston Red Sox in the lead. I had called her to get her reaction to the editorial in The New York Times called “California to the Rescue.” “Wherever we go in the car, people are honking and waving and yelling, ‘Stem cells!’” she said. I could just see Arnold and Maria, the couple once joked about as officers of the Armani National Guard, cruising down San Vicente in the Hummer. That week, her brother Bobby had won an easy victory in his run for the Santa Monica City Council. For weeks Eunice Shriver had been canvassing door-to-door for him. “They want me to work the bowling alleys and the coffee bars,” she had told me late one night at a fund-raiser. “I said, ‘Never. I only go door-to-door.’” That image stayed with me as well—a door in a million-dollar bungalow in pricey Brentwood opening to reveal the sprightly Eunice Kennedy Shriver on the doorstep. “They go crazy when they see Mummy!,” Maria had said. The indefatigable engine of Camelot had suddenly migrated and landed defiantly on the blue coast of California.\n\nAs we spoke, Arnold was preparing to leave for Japan to drum up trade, acting almost presidential, realizing that if he could act the part he might, as he had predicted on the beach at Cannes in 1977, have the chance to make it real. He was also willing to discuss the possibility of amending the Constitution so that he could run for president. During election week, one anchorman had suggested a notion that sounded counterintuitive in light of current events. “Ideas are at the very center of the success of all great American leaders,” CNN’s Jeff Greenfield said, with no special emphasis. He pointed out that Ronald Reagan had proposed supply-side economics, and that Bill Clinton had risen on the issue of centrism. Now Arnold Schwarzenegger had a mandate to climb onto the national stage with the help of stem-cell research. “If Arnold Schwarzenegger can change the Constitution,” NBC’s Tim Russert said jokingly that same day, “he will surely run for president.” Maria told me she had heard something else: “People are saying the future of the Republican Party will be shaped by John McCain, Rudy Giuliani, and Arnold.” Our conversation that night was not brief, and after we hung up, I realized that Maria had not once used the word “struggle.”"
