        "text": "An image of Arnold Schwarzenegger is being shared widely on social media with a claim that he slept in front of his statue because he was denied a room in the hotel once inaugurated by him. In the post, it is also being claimed that the statue is at the hotel. Let’s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: After being denied a room in the hotel inaugurated by him, Arnold Schwarzenegger slept in front of the statue at the hotel.\n\nFact: The statue in the photo is at the ‘Greater Columbus Convention Center’. The photo was taken in 2016 when he was in Ohio for a movie shooting and visited the convention centre. According to the ‘Daily Mail’ website, he ‘pretended to sleep and possibly appear homeless as he posed underneath a statue of his former self in Ohio’. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nThe photo was posted by Arnold Schwarzenegger on his social media accounts (Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram) with the description – ‘How times have changed.’, in January-2016. He did not mention any story with respect to the photo.\n\nWhen searched for the news articles published regarding this photo in 2016, an article by the ‘Daily Mail’ can be found in the search results. In the article, the same photo was found with the following description: ‘Memory lane: The actor pretended to sleep and possibly appear homeless as he posed underneath a statue of his former self in Ohio’. Also, an article in the ‘People’ mentions that the actor ‘decided to take a catnap in front of the massive bronze statue of his bodybuilder self’.\n\nAlso, in the article by ‘E News’, it can be read that the photo was taken outside the ‘Greater Columbus Convention Center’. More about the statue can be read here.\n\nWhen similar posts went viral earlier, other fact-checkers (Snopes and Africa Check) across the world have written fact-check articles on this issue.\n\nTo sum it up, the story about Arnold Schwarzenegger sleeping in front of his statue because he was denied a room in the hotel is false"
