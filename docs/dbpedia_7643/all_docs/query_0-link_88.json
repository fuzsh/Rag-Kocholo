        "text": "Maximilian Schell was the most successful German-speaking actor in English-language films since Emil Jannings, the winner of the first Best Actor Academy Award. Like Jannings, Schell won the Oscar, but unlike him, he was a dedicated anti-Nazi. Indeed, with the exception of Maurice Chevalier and Marcello Mastroianni, Schell was undoubtedly the most successful non-anglophone foreign actor in the history of American cinema.\n\nSchell was born in Vienna, Austria on December 8, 1930, but raised in in Zurich, Switzerland. (Austria became part of Germany after the anschluss of 1938), then was occupied by the allies from 1945 until 1955, when it again joined the family of nations.) He learned his craft on the stage beginning in 1952, and made his reputation with appearances in German-language films and television. He was a fine Shakespearean actor, and had a huge success with \"Richard III\" (he has also appeared in as the eponymous prince in a German-language version of \"Hamlet\").\n\nSchell made his Hollywood debut in 1958 in the World War II film Die jungen Löwen (1958) quite by accident, as the producers had wanted to hire his sister Maria Schell, but lines of communication got crossed, and he was the one hired. He impressed American producers as his turn as the friend of German soldier Marlon Brando, and subsequently assayed the role of the German defense attorney in the television drama Urteil von Nürnberg (1961) on \"Playhouse 90\" in 1959. He was also cast in the big screen remake, for which he won the 1961 Academy Award for Best Actor, beating out co-star Spencer Tracy for the Oscar. He also won a Golden Globe and the New York Film Critics Circle Award for the role. Schell ultimately won two more Oscar nominations for acting, in 1976 for Best Actor for The Man in the Glass Booth (1975) and in 1978 as Best Supporting Actor for Julia (1977) (which also brought him the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Supporting Actor). He has twice been nominated for an Emmy for his TV work, and won the 1993 Golden Globe for best performance by an actor in a supporting role in a series, mini-series or made-for-TV movie for Stalin (1992).\n\nSchell has also has directed films, and his 1974 film Der Fußgänger (1973) (\"The Pedestrian\"), which Schell wrote, produced, directed, and starred in, was nominated for the Best Foreign Language Film Oscar and won the Golden Globe in the same category. His documentary about Marlene Dietrich, Marlene (1984), was widely hailed as a masterpiece of the non-fiction genre and garnered its producers a Best Documentary Oscar nomination in 1985. In 2002, Schell released Meine Schwester Maria (2002) (My Sister Maria), a documentary about the career of and his relationship with Maria Schell. Since the 1990s, Schell has appeared in many German language made-for-TV films, such as the 2003 film Alles Glück dieser Erde (2003) (All the Luck in the World) and in the mini-series Die Rückkehr des Tanzlehrers (2004), which was based on Henning Mankell's novel. He has also continued to appear on stage, appearing in dual roles in the 2000 Broadway production of the stage version of \"Judgment at Nuremberg\", and most recently in Robert Altman's London production of Arthur Miller's play \"Resurrection Blues\" in 2006. He died on 31st of January 2014, aged 83, in Innsbruck, Austria.\n\nChristoph Waltz is an Austrian-German actor. He is known for his work with American filmmaker Quentin Tarantino, receiving acclaim for portraying SS-Standartenführer Hans Landa in Inglourious Basterds (2009) and bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz in Django Unchained (2012). For each performance, he won an Academy Award, a BAFTA Award, and a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor. Additionally, he received the Best Actor Award at the Cannes Film Festival and a Screen Actors Guild Award for his portrayal of Landa.\n\nChristoph Waltz was born in Vienna, Austria, into a theatrical family, his mother Elisabeth Urbancic, an Austrian-born costume designer, and Johannes Waltz, a German-born stage builder. He has three siblings. His maternal grandmother was Viennese Burgtheater actress Maria Mayen, and his step-grandfather was fellow Burgtheater actor Emmerich Reimers. His maternal grandfather, Rudolf von Urban, was a psychologist and psychiatrist who wrote the 1949 book \"Sex Perfection and Marital Happiness\".\n\nWaltz attended the Theresianium and Billrothstrasse in Vienna. Upon graduation, he attended the Max-Reinhardt-Seminar before going to New York to the Lee Strasberg Institute. While in New York, Christoph met his first wife, and moved back to Vienna, then to London.\n\nDuring the 80s, Christoph worked primarily in theatre, commuting from his home in London to Germany. Slowly Waltz began to work in TV, taking one-off roles in series, and TV movies. Film roles soon followed. Attempts to break into English-speaking film and TV were, however, unsuccessful. Waltz has expressed his gratitude to have been able to make a living and support his family through acting. For thirty years he worked steadily, tirelessly, in this manner.\n\nIt was not until he met Quentin Tarantino that his career in Hollywood took off. The role of Colonel Hans Landa in Inglourious Basterds (2009) catapulted Waltz from a lifetime working in German TV/film to the new life of an international superstar and Academy Award-winning actor. He won 27 awards for his performance as Hans Landa, including the Cannes prix d'interpretation Masculin for 2009, the Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor, the BAFTA Best Supporting Actor award, and the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor (which he won again for 2012's Django Unchained (2012)).\n\nHe also has portrayed computer genius Qohen Leth in the film The Zero Theorem (2013), American plagiarist Walter Keane in the biographical film _Big Eyes (2014), and 007's nemesis and head of SPECTRE Ernst Stavro Blofeld in _Spectre (2015)_. In Quentin Tarantino's 2009 film Inglourious Basterds, Waltz portrayed SS-Standartenführer Hans Landa, aka \"The Jew Hunter\". Clever, courteous, and multilingual - but also self-serving, cunning, implacable, and murderous. Waltz played gangster Benjamin Chudnofsky in The Green Hornet (2011). That same year, he starred in Wasser für die Elefanten (2011), Roman Polanski's Der Gott des Gemetzels (2011), and a remake of Die drei Musketiere (2011). He played German bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz in Quentin Tarantino's Django Unchained (2012), a role Tarantino wrote specifically for Waltz.\n\nWaltz resides in Berlin and Los Angeles. His wife is costume builder Judith Holste.\n\nPeter Lorre was born László Löwenstein in Rózsahegy in the Slovak area of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the son of Hungarian Jewish parents. He learned both Hungarian and German languages from birth, and was educated in elementary and secondary schools in the Austria-Hungary capitol Vienna, but did not complete. As a youth he ran away from home, first working as a bank clerk, and after stage training in Vienna, Austria, made his acting debut at age 17 in 1922 in Zurich, Switzerland. He traveled for several years acting on stage throughout his home region, Vienna, Berlin, and Zurich, including working with Bertolt Brecht, until Fritz Lang cast him in a starring role as the psychopathic child killer in the German film M: Eine Stadt sucht einen Mörder (1931).\n\nAfter several more films in Germany, including a couple roles for which he learned to speak French, Lorre left as the Nazis came to power, going first to Paris where he made one film, then London where Alfred Hitchcock cast him as a creepy villain in Der Mann, der zuviel wußte (1934), where he learned his lines phonetically, and finally arrived in Hollywood in 1935. In his first two roles there he starred as a mad scientist in Mad Love (1935) directed by recent fellow-expatriate Karl Freund, and the leading part of Raskolnikov in Crime and Punishment (1935), by another expatriate German director Josef von Sternberg, a successful movie made at Lorre's own suggestion. He returned to England for a role in another Hitchcock film, Geheimagent (1936), then back to the US for a few more films before checking into a rehab facility to cure himself of a morphine addiction.\n\nAfter shaking his addiction, in order to get any kind of acting work, Lorre reluctantly accepted the starring part as the Japanese secret agent in Mr. Moto und der China-Schatz (1937), wearing makeup to alter his already very round eyes for the part. He ended up committed to repeating the role for eight more \"Mr. Moto\" movies over the next two years.\n\nLorre played numerous memorable villain roles, spy characters, comedic roles, and even a romantic type, throughout the 1940s, beginning with his graduation from 30s B-pictures Die Spur des Falken (1941). Among his most famous films, Casablanca (1942), and a comedic role in the Broadway hit film Arsen und Spitzenhäubchen (1944).\n\nAfter the war, between 1946 and '49 Lorre concentrated largely on radio and the stage, while continuing to appear in movies. In Autumn 1950 he traveled to West Gemany where he wrote, directed and starred in the critically acclaimed but generally unknown German-language film Der Verlorene (1951), adapted from Lorre's own novel.\n\nLorre returned to the US in 1952, somewhat heavier in stature, where he used his abilities as a stage actor appearing in many live television productions throughout the 50s, including the first James Bond adaptation Casino Royale (1954), broadcast just a few months after Ian Fleming had published that first Bond novel. In that decade, Lorre had various roles, often to type but also as comedic caricatures of himself, in many episodes of TV series, and variety shows, though he continued to work in motion pictures, including the Academy Award winning In 80 Tagen um die Welt (1956), and a stellar role as a clown in Die Welt der Sensationen (1959).\n\nIn the late 50s and early 1960s he worked in several low-budget films, with producer-director Roger Corman, and producer-writer-director Irwin Allen, including the aforementioned The Big Circus and two adventurous Disney movies with Allen. He died from a stroke the year he made his last movie, playing a stooge in Jerry Lewis' Die Heulboje (1964).\n\nTo paraphrase the Beatles, one could say that, like Michelle and Ma Belle, Peter Alexander and Music are words that go together well, for the Austrian entertainer (musician, singer and actor) was associated with music from cradle to tomb. Born in Vienna in 1926, the son of a banker and his wife, Peter Alexander Neumayer (his full name) entered the world of music courtesy of his grandfather who owned a music store in Pilsen. The boy was only five when he joined the Vienna Boys' Choir. And as Peter Alexander had another passion, acting, it is no wonder that he became a... singing actor ! But all in due time: In his early twenties, the young man first started studying medicine. Naturally he soon realized he was on the wrong track and changed for drama studies at the Reinhard-Seminar in Vienna. After graduating he appeared in several plays and even played in a cabaret. At the same period, Peter Alexander's love for music resurfaced and he recorded his first songs in 1951. Success was on the cards as several of his songs became big hits. He even won the German Song Contest in Munich in 1952. From then on, Peter Alexander, who had played in the theater, but never in films, started working for the big screen. Actually, his first appearances were brief and he was always billed as a singer, a dancer, a musician or himself. But his being a star of song gradually implied a star actor status. As a matter of fact, Peter Alexander soon got top-billed, and in dozens of light comedies, which attracted millions of German-speaking spectators. In such films as Ich bin kein Casanova (1959), Die Abenteuer des Grafen Bobby (1961) and nearly all the others, Alexander was not what can be called a character actor embodying a a different role in each of those films, but he was invariably the charming, well-bred, joyful man, fond of \"Festlicher Stimmung\" (festive mood) and Lust (good laughs), often named Peter, in short, close to the kind of guy he was in real life. Of course, all this had nothing much to do with art and if Peter Alexander's name is still remembered fondly by the older generation in Austria and Germany, it must be recognized that he has not left any imprint in film history. Peter Alexander was synonymous with a joyful time meant for immediate consumption and that was that. An exception though: 'Wolfgang Liebeneiner' qv)'s Schwejks Flegeljahre (1964), in which for once he did not play a nice guy close to who he was, but 'Jaroslav Hasek''s well-known \"hero\", the prototype of the dumb soldier who drives his superiors crazy. Peter Alexander 's portrayal of this archetypal character was just excellent and it makes you regret that the comedian was not offered more demanding roles during the two decades when he was at the top of his career. After 1972, as commercial German cinema was spiraling down into the abyss, Peter Alexander left his film career to devote himself to TV shows and, of course, to songs, songs, songs . He died in early 2011 at the age of 84. History does not record whether.. he sang his last words!\n\nCurd Jürgens (commonly billed as \"Curt Jurgens\" in anglophone countries) was one of the most successful European film actors of the 20th Century. He was born Curd Gustav Andreas Gottlieb Franz Jürgens on December 13, 1915, in Solln, Bavaria, in Hohenzollern Imperial Germany, a subject of Kaiser Wilhelm II. Of Franco-German parentage, Jürgens -- who was born during the closing days of the second year of the First World War -- would abandon the country of his birth after the end of World War II: Jürgens became an Austrian citizen in 1945 and lived part-time in France.\n\nJürgens entered the journalism profession after receiving his education, and married Louise Basler, an actress. Basler, the first of his five wives, encouraged him to switch careers and become an actor. He learned his new profession on the Vienna stage, which retained his loyalty even after he became an global film star. Jürgens was sent to a concentration camp for \"political unreliables\" in 1944, due to his anti-Nazi opinions. It was this experience in Nazi Germany that led him to become an Austrian citizen after the war.\n\nHis appearance in Des Teufels General (1955) (\"The Devil's General\" (1955)), established him as a star of German cinema, and his role as Brigitte Bardot's older lover in Roger Vadim's ...und immer lockt das Weib (1956) (And God Created Woman (1956)) made him an international star. Always interested in multilingual European actors with good looks and talent, Hollywood beckoned the 6' 4\" Jürgens, casting him in Duell im Atlantik (1957) as a WWII German U-boat commander in a duel with American destroyer commander Robert Mitchum. He constantly was in demand to play Germany military officers (e.g., Der längste Tag (1962), the most expensive black-and-white film ever made) -- indeed, his last role was as \"The General\" in the miniseries Agent in eigener Sache (1982) -- and Germanic villains (e.g., \"Cornelius\", the cowardly and treacherous trading company representative, in Lord Jim (1965)) for the rest of his life. One of his most famous roles in the English-language cinema was as the James Bond villain, \"Karl Stromberg\", in Der Spion, der mich liebte (1977); it was Moore's favorite Bond film.\n\nJürgens considered himself primarily a stage actor and often performed on the Vienna stage. Though the world knew him as a cinema actor, he also directed several films and wrote several screenplays and an autobiography, \"Sixty and Not Yet Wise\" (1975). His death from a heart attack in 1982 in Vienna was front-page news across Austria and Germany.\n\nAlfred Dorfer is an Austrian actor, stage comedian and script writer. He was studying \"Theatre studies\" at the University of Vienna when he met the actor Herwig Seeböck, who started to train him in acting. Dorfer discontinued his academic studies for 25 years, but made his Master in 2007, followed by a PhD-title some years later. During his absence at University he started his successful career as a stage comedian and film actor. The first milestone in this career was as a part of the comedian group \"Schlabarett\", which played two successful live show programs before they split. During that time he met Roland Düringer, who became a longtime partner in many forthcoming projects. One of this cooperation projects was the movie \"Muttertag (1994)\". In 1993 he played his first solo program as a stage comedian, which got recognition not just in Austria but also In Germany, and he played one of the main roles in the successful movie \"Indien (1993)\", which featured also his friend and comedian colleague Josef Hader. On the smaller screen he is most famous for \"Dorfers Donnerstalk (2004)\" and \"MA 2412 (1998)\".\n\nRoland Düringers grew up in Vienna, Austria, where his father was a cloakroom attendant at the famous Viennese Burgtheater. Düringer, who was at that time pupil of a \"Secondary technical college\" met (because of father occupation) the actor Herwig Seeböck, who invited him to his theatre workshops and also to be part of his theatre ensemble. The first milestone in his career was with the comedy group \"Schlabarett\", where he also met Alfred Dorfer, who got a longtime partner in many upcoming projects. The group played two extraordinary successful programs (\"Atompilz von links (1985)\" and \"Kultur gegen alle (1986)\") in front of a live audience. Afterwards the group split and Düringer started his first solo program (\"Hinterholzacht - 20 Jahre Abrechnung (1994)\" as a stage comedian. In the same year he played a lot of different roles in the Austrian cult comedy film \"Muttertag (1994)\". 1992 he played his first bigger role in the TV series \"Kaisermühlen Blues (1992)\", which is still in production and still on air in Austrian television. Maybe even more famous is the TV series \"MA 2412 (1998)\" in which he played a magistrate at the side of his friend Alfred Dorfer. Düringer reached one of his fever pitches with the feature film \"Hinterholz 8 (1998)\", which was the second most successful movie in Austrian cinemas that year and which was just beaten by \"Titanic (1997)\". Düringer used to be a motor sports and car enthusiast, before he concentrated himself on a more sustainable mode of life. 2016 he formed his own Austrian political party."
