        "text": "Capital of Styria, Austria\n\nThis article is about the city in Austria. For other uses, see Graz (disambiguation).\n\nStatutory city in Styria, Austria\n\nGraz (German: [ɡʁaːts] ⓘ) is the capital of the Austrian federal state of Styria and the second-largest city in Austria, after Vienna. As of 1 January 2024, Graz had a population of 303,270.[4] In 2023, the population of the Graz larger urban zone (LUZ) stood at 660,238.[5] Graz is known as a college and university city, with four colleges and four universities. Combined, the city is home to more than 60,000 students.[6] Its historic centre (Altstadt) is one of the best-preserved city centres in Central Europe.[7]\n\nIn 1999, the city's historic centre was added to the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites and in 2010 the designation was expanded to include Eggenberg Palace (German: Schloss Eggenberg) on the western edge of the city. Graz was designated the Cultural Capital of Europe in 2003 and became a City of Culinary Delights in 2008.\n\nEtymology\n\n[edit]\n\nThe name of the city, Graz, formerly spelled Gratz[8] and also formlerly known as Grätz, most likely stems from the Slavic gradec/gradac, which means \"small castle\". Some archaeological finds point to the erection of a small castle by Alpine Slavic people,[9] who settled in the region after the Barbarian invasions drove out the original Celts, as well as the Romans. In literary Slovene, gradec still means \"small castle\", forming a hypocoristic derivative of Proto-West-South Slavic *gradьcъ, which descends via liquid metathesis from Common Slavic *gardьcъ and via the Slavic third palatalisation from Proto-Slavic *gardiku, originally denoting \"small town, settlement\". The name thus follows the common South Slavic pattern for naming settlements as grad. Despite the Slavic root of the name, however, the city of Graz was founded by Bavarian settlers who arrived shortly after the Slavs, with which they intermixed. The city's name first appears in records in 1128, a record of 'Grez' from 1091 is disputed.\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nGraz is situated on both sides of the river Mur in southeast Austria. It is about 150 km (93 mi) southwest of Vienna (Wien). The nearest larger urban centre is Maribor (Marburg) in Slovenia, which is about 50 km (31 mi) to the south. Graz is the capital of Styria and the largest city in the federal state, a green and heavily forested region on the eastern edge of the Alps. It is located in the Graz Basin and surrounded by mountains and hills to the north, east and west. The city centre sits at an elevation of 353 m (1,158 ft), the highest point is Plabutsch mountain with 754 m (2,474 ft) at the western border. The mountain Schöckl is just a few kilometres to the north and surmounts the city by 1,100 m (3,600 ft).\n\nNeighbouring municipalities\n\n[edit]\n\nThese towns and villages border Graz:\n\nto the north: Gratkorn, Stattegg, Weinitzen\n\nto the east: Kainbach bei Graz, Hart bei Graz, Raaba\n\nto the south: Gössendorf, Feldkirchen bei Graz, Seiersberg\n\nto the west: Attendorf, Thal, Judendorf-Straßengel\n\nDistricts\n\n[edit]\n\nGraz is divided into 17 municipal districts (Stadtbezirke):[10]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Graz.\n\nThe oldest settlement on the ground of the modern city of Graz dates back to the Copper Age. However, no historical continuity exists of a settlement before the Middle Ages. The city was originally called \"Bayrischgraz\" or \"Bavarian Graz\" (i.e. German Graz) by the German founders to distinguish it from the elder \"Windischgraz\" or \"Slovenian Graz\". Bavarian Graz, however, soon eclipsed its Slovenian counterpart and henceforth Graz always referred to the German one.\n\nDuring the 12th century, dukes under Babenberg rule made the town into an important commercial center. Later, Graz came under the rule of the Habsburgs and, in 1281, gained special privileges from King Rudolph I.\n\nIn the 14th century, Graz became the city of residence of the Inner Austrian line of the Habsburgs. The royalty lived in the Schlossberg castle and from there ruled Styria, Carinthia, most of today's Slovenia, and parts of Italy (Carniola, Gorizia and Gradisca, Trieste).\n\nIn the 16th century, the city's design and planning were primarily controlled by Italian Renaissance architects and artists. One of the most famous buildings representative of this style is the Landhaus, designed by Domenico dell'Allio, and used by the local rulers as a governmental headquarters.\n\nThe University of Graz was founded by Archduke Karl II in 1585, it is the city's oldest university. For most of its existence, it was controlled by the Catholic Church, and was closed in 1782 by Joseph II in an attempt to gain state control over educational institutions. Joseph II transformed it into a lyceum where civil servants and medical personnel were trained. In 1827 it was re-established as a university by Emperor Franz I, and was named 'Karl-Franzens Universität' or 'Charles-Francis University' in English. More than 30,000 students are currently enrolled at this university.\n\nAstronomer Johannes Kepler lived in Graz for a short period beginning in 1594. He worked as district mathematician and taught at the Lutheran school, but still found time to study astronomy. He left Graz for Prague in 1600 when Protestants were banned from the city.\n\nLudwig Boltzmann was Professor for Mathematical Physics from 1869 to 1890. During that time, Nikola Tesla studied electrical engineering at the Polytechnic in 1875.\n\nNobel laureate Otto Loewi taught at the University of Graz from 1909 until 1938. Ivo Andrić, the 1961 Nobel Prize for Literature laureate obtained his doctorate at the University of Graz. Erwin Schrödinger was briefly chancellor of the University of Graz in 1936.\n\nGraz is centrally located within today's Bundesland (state) of Styria, or Steiermark in German. Mark is an old German word indicating a large area of land used as a defensive border, in which the peasantry is taught how to organize and fight in the case of an invasion. With a strategic location at the head of the open and fertile Mur valley, Graz was historically a target of invaders, such as the Hungarians under Matthias Corvinus in 1481, and the Ottoman Turks in 1529 and 1532. Apart from the Riegersburg Castle, the Schlossberg was the only fortification in the region that never fell to the Ottoman Turks. Graz is home to the region's provincial armory, which is the world's largest historical collection of late medieval and Renaissance weaponry. It has been preserved since 1551, and displays over 30,000 items.\n\nFrom the earlier part of the 15th century, Graz was the residence of the younger branch of the Habsburgs, which succeeded to the imperial throne in 1619 in the person of Emperor Ferdinand II, who moved the capital to Vienna. New fortifications were built on the Schlossberg at the end of the 16th century. Napoleon's army occupied Graz in 1797 and, in 1809 the city withstood another assault by the French army. During this attack, the commanding officer in the fortress was ordered to defend it with about 900 men against Napoleon's army of about 3,000. He successfully defended the Schlossberg against eight attacks, but they were forced to give up after the Grande Armée occupied Vienna and the Emperor ordered to surrender. Following the defeat of Austria by Napoleonic forces at the Battle of Wagram in 1809, the fortifications were demolished using explosives, as stipulated in the Peace of Schönbrunn of the same year. The belltower (Glockenturm)[11] and the civic clock tower (Uhrturm),[12] which is a leading tourist attraction and serves as a symbol for Graz, were spared after the citizens of Graz paid a ransom for their preservation.[13]\n\nArchduke Karl II of Inner Austria had 20,000 Protestant books burned in the square of what is now a mental hospital, and succeeded in returning Styria to the authority of the Holy See. Archduke Franz Ferdinand was born in Graz in what is now the Stadtmuseum (city museum).\n\nOn 2 April 1945, while the heaviest Allied bomb raid of Graz occurred, the Gestapo and Waffen-SS committed a massacre against resistance fighters, Hungarian-Jewish forced laborers, and POWs at the SS barracks at Graz-Wetzelsdorf.[14]\n\nPopulation development\n\n[edit]\n\nHistorical population\n\nThese figures only include those with primary residence status (\"Hauptwohnsitz\"). As of 1 January 2024, the city had a total population of 339,810, of which 36,196 (10.7 %) held secondary residence status and 344 had no residence.[16]\n\nLargest groups of foreign nationals[17] Nationality Population\n\n(1 January 2023) Croatia 11,196 Romania 10,305 Germany 9,226 Bosnia and Herzegovina 7,598 Turkey 5,837 Hungary 4,723 Ukraine 3,429 Syria 3,354 Afghanistan 3,349 Slovenia 3,141 Russia 2,575 Italy 2,553 Kosovo 1,873 Serbia 1,823 Slovakia 1,620\n\nClimate\n\n[edit]\n\nGraz has an oceanic climate (Cfb),[18] but due to the 0 °C isotherm, the same occurs in a borderline humid continental climate (Dfb) according to the Köppen climate classification. Wladimir Köppen himself was in town and conducted studies to see how the climate of the past influenced the Continental Drift theory.[19] Due to its position southeast of the Alps, Graz is shielded from the prevailing westerly winds that bring weather fronts in from the North Atlantic to northwestern and central Europe. The weather in Graz is thus influenced by the Mediterranean, and it has more hours of sunshine per year than Vienna or Salzburg and also less wind or rain. Graz lies in a basin that is only open to the south, causing the climate to be warmer than would be expected at that latitude.[20] Plants are found in Graz that normally grow much further south.\n\naverage temperatures: Graz Airport 8.7 °C (48 °F) / Karl-Franzens University 9.4 °C (49 °F)\n\naverage rainfall: 818 mm (32 in) with on average 92 days of rain (Karl Franzens University)\n\naverage hours of sunshine: 1,989 (Karl Franzens University)\n\nSlovene minority in Graz\n\n[edit]\n\nGraz, being the capital of the then multiethnic Duchy of Styria, was also a centre of Slovene culture, especially from the establishment of the University of Graz in 1586 until the establishment of the University of Ljubljana in 1919. In 1574, the first Slovene Catholic book [sl] was published in Graz, and in 1592, Hieronymus Megiser published in Graz the book Dictionarium quatuor linguarum, the first multilingual dictionary of Slovene.[25]\n\nIn the 19th century the student associations in Graz were a crucible of Slovene nationalism and some Slovene students there were more nationally aware than other Slovenes. This led to fierce anti-Slovene efforts by the German supermajority in Graz before and during World War II.[26] It must be noted that Slovenes only ever constituted a tiny minority in the city. This is also why Peter Kozler did not include it in his controversial map.\n\nNowadays, some Slovenian Styrians study and some have found employment there, whiles being formerly unemployed in Slovenia.[26]\n\nA symposium on the relation of Graz and the Slovenes was held in Graz in 2010, at the occasion of the 200th anniversary of the establishment of the first and oldest chair of Slovene. It was established at the Lyzeum of Graz in July 1811 on the initiative of Janez Nepomuk Primic [sl].[27] A collection of lectures on the topic was published. The Slovenian Post commemorated the anniversary with a stamp.[28]\n\nMain sights\n\n[edit]\n\nFor the year that Graz was Cultural Capital of Europe, new structures were erected. The Graz Museum of Contemporary Art (German: Kunsthaus) was designed by Peter Cook and Colin Fournier and is situated next to the Mur river. The Island in the Mur is a floating platform made of steel. It was designed by American architect Vito Acconci and contains a café, an open-air theatre and a playground.\n\nHistoric city centre\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Innere Stadt (Graz)\n\nThe historic centre was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1999[13] due to the harmonious co-existence of typical buildings from different epochs and in different architectural styles. Situated in a cultural borderland between Central Europe, Italy and the Balkan States, Graz absorbed various influences from the neighbouring regions and thus received its exceptional townscape. Today the historic centre consists of over 1,000 buildings, their age ranging from Gothic to contemporary.\n\nThe most important sights in the historic centre are:\n\nTown Hall (Rathaus).\n\nThe Castle Hill (German: Schlossberg), a hill dominating the historic centre (475 m (1,558.40 ft) high), site of a demolished fortress, with views over Graz.\n\nThe Clock Tower (Uhrturm) is a symbol of Graz, at the top of the Castle Hill.\n\nThe New Gallery (Neue Galerie), a museum of art.\n\nThe Castle Hill funicular (Schlossbergbahn), a funicular railway on the Castle Hill's slope.\n\nThe seat of Styria's provincial parliament (Landhaus), a palace in Lombardic style. It is one of the most important examples of Renaissance architecture in Austria and was built by Italian architect Domenico dell'Allio between 1557 and 1565.\n\nThe Armoury (Landeszeughaus) is the largest of its kind in the world.\n\nThe Opera House (Opernhaus), the principal venue for opera, ballet, and operetta performances. It is the 2nd largest opera house in Austria.\n\nThe Theatre (Schauspielhaus), Graz's principal theatre for productions of plays.\n\nThe Cathedral (Dom), a rare monument of Gothic architecture. Once, there were many frescos on the outer walls; today, only a few remain, like the Landplagenbild (\"picture of plagues\") painted in 1485, presumably by Thomas von Villach. The three plagues it depicts are locusts, pestilence and the invasion of the Turks, all of them striking the town in 1480. It features the oldest painted view of Graz.\n\nThe mausoleum of Emperor Ferdinand II next to the cathedral, the most important building of Mannerism in Graz. It includes both the grave where Ferdinand II and his wife are buried, and a church dedicated to St Catherine of Alexandria.\n\nThe City Park (Stadtpark), located in the middle of the city centre during the Habsburg monarchy. It was designed by German architect Johannes Schirgie von Premstätten-Tobelbad. During the COVID-19 pandemic eccentric parties were celebrated which were later dissolved by the police. The responsible,[citation needed] Jonas Fabio Cristo Pinter, an Italian club owner, was arrested and the partying stopped. The City Park (Stadtpark) should not be confused with a similarly named shopping centre in Graz, called Citypark.\n\nThe Castle (Burg), with a Gothic double-helix staircase, built between 1438 and 1453 by Emperor Frederick III, because the old castle on the Castle Hill was too small and uncomfortable. The Castle remained the residence of the Inner Austrian Court until 1619. Today, it serves as residence for the Styrian government.\n\nThe Painted House (Gemaltes Haus) in Herrengasse 3. It is completely covered with frescos (painted in 1742 by Johann Mayer).\n\nThe Graz Museum of Contemporary Art (Kunsthaus)\n\nThe Island in the Mur (Murinsel), an artificial island in the Mur river.\n\nBuildings, inner courtyards (e. g. Early Renaissance courtyard of the Former House of Teutonic Knights in Sporgasse 22) and roofscape of the old town.\n\nOutside the historic city centre\n\n[edit]\n\nEggenberg Palace (Schloss Eggenberg) a baroque palace on the western edge of Graz with State rooms and museum. In 2010 it was added to the existing World Heritage site of the historic centre of Graz.\n\nThe Mariatrost Basilica (Basilika Mariatrost) a late Baroque church, on the eastern edge of Graz.\n\nThe Jesus's Heart Church (Herz-Jesu-Kirche) is the largest church in Graz with the third highest spire in Austria, built in Gothic Revival style by Daniel Schmidbauer (Austrian politician and doctor).\n\nThe Calvary Hill (Kalvarienberg) in the Gösting area of Graz with a 17th-century calvary and church.\n\nThe Graz University Hospital is the largest hospital in Graz and one of the largest hospitals in Austria. It is the largest Jugendstil building complex in Austria and was built between 1904 and 1912. It is run by the federal state Styria and is one of the most renowned hospitals in Austria and Central Europe.\n\nThe Gösting Ruin (Ruine Gösting), a ruin of a hilltop castle on the city's northwestern edge, and Plabutsch/Fürstenstand, behind Eggenberg Palace, with a hilltop restaurant and viewing tower, as well as Buchkogel/Kronprinz-Rudolf-Warte are viewpoints for vistas of the city.\n\nGreater Graz area\n\n[edit]\n\nÖsterreichisches Freilichtmuseum Stübing, an open-air museum containing old farmhouses/farm buildings from all over Austria reassembled in historic setting.\n\nLurgrotte, the most extensive cave system in Austria.\n\nLipizzanergestüt Piber, Lipizzaner stud at Piber where the famous horses are bred.\n\nThe Steirische Weinstraße is a wine-growing region south of Graz, also known as the \"Styrian Tuscany\".\n\nThermenregion, spa region east of Graz.\n\nRiegersburg Castle, a mighty fortress that was never taken. It was a bastion against Turkish invasions\n\nPolitics\n\n[edit]\n\nFor much of its post-war history Graz was a stronghold of the Social Democratic Party of Austria (SPÖ), but since the late 1990s the party has lost most of its support on a local level. It was overtaken by the Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) in 2003, which remained the largest party in the city council (Gemeinderat) until 2021. With the decline of the SPÖ, the Communist Party of Austria (KPÖ) has become highly popular in Graz, despite its negligible presence on a national level. The party placed third with 20.8% of votes in the 2003 local election, which has been attributed to the popularity of local leader Ernest Kaltenegger. It fell to 11.2% in 2008, and recovered under new leader Elke Kahr, becoming the second most popular party in Graz with 19.9% in 2012 and 20.3% in 2017. The KPÖ's popularity in Graz allowed them to enter the Styrian provincial parliament in the 2005 election, marking their first appearance in an Austrian provincial parliament in 35 years; they have retained their seats in the subsequent 2010, 2015, and 2019 elections.[29] The 2021 municipal election saw a collapse in the ÖVP's popularity, allowing the KPÖ, once again led by Elke Kahr, to become the largest party with 29% of votes.[30] She was subsequently elected mayor in November, leading a coalition with the Greens and SPÖ.[31][32]\n\nMain article: 2021 Graz local election\n\nThe most recent city council election was held on 26 September 2021, and the results were as follows:\n\nParty Lead candidate Votes % +/- Seats +/- Coun. +/- Communist Party of Austria (KPÖ) Elke Kahr 34,283 28.84 8.50 15 5 3 1 Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) Siegfried Nagl 30,797 25.91 11.88 13 6 2 1 The Greens – The Green Alternative (GRÜNE) Judith Schwentner 20,593 17.32 6.81 9 4 1 ±0 Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ) Mario Eustacchio 12,612 10.61 5.25 5 3 1 ±0 Social Democratic Party of Austria (SPÖ) Michael Ehmann 11,325 9.53 0.52 4 1 0 ±0 NEOS – The New Austria and Liberal Forum (NEOS) Philipp Pointner 6,447 5.42 1.48 2 1 0 ±0 Others – 2,825 2.37 – 0 ±0 0 ±0 Invalid votes 1,807 Total 120,689 100.00 48 ±0 7 ±0 Electorate/voter turnout 223,512 54.00 3.39 Source: Stadt Graz\n\nCulture\n\n[edit]\n\nDuring 2003 Graz held the title of \"European Capital of Culture\" and was one of the UNESCO \"Cities of Design\" in 2011.\n\nMuseums\n\n[edit]\n\nThe most important museums in Graz are:\n\nEggenberg Palace (Schloss Eggenberg) with the Old Gallery (Alte Galerie) (paintings and sculptures from the Romanesque to the end of the Baroque period), Coin Collection, Lapidarium (Roman stonework collection), Archaeological Museum (featuring the Cult Wagon of Strettweg) a special exhibitions area and the 90,000 m2 romantic landscape gardens.\n\nMuseum in the Palace (Museum im Palais): museum of Styrian cultural history from the Middle Ages to the present.\n\nNew Gallery (Neue Galerie): visual arts from the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\nNatural History Museum: exhibition of botany, mineralogy and zoology.\n\nGraz City Museum (Stadtmuseum Graz)\n\nMuseum of Contemporary Art (Kunsthaus)\n\nCity Park Forum (Forum Stadtpark): museum of contemporary art.\n\nCamera Austria: museum of contemporary photography.\n\nArmoury (Landeszeughaus): medieval armoury comprising 32,000 pieces of armour and weaponry, largest of its kind in the world.\n\nFolklore Museum (Volkskundemuseum): museum of folk culture and folklore.\n\nDiocesan Museum (Diözesanmuseum): museum of the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nArtists House (Künstlerhaus): exhibition hall of contemporary visual arts.\n\nLiterature House (Literaturhaus): museum of contemporary German literature.\n\nMuseum of Perception (Museum der Wahrnehmung): museum of the senses, samadhi bath.\n\nChildren's Museum Frida & Fred (Kindermuseum Frida & Fred): museum for children.\n\nTram Museum: 40 historic trams, the oldest dating from 1873.\n\nKriminalmuseum: museum of criminology.\n\nAviation Museum (Luftfahrtmuseum): situated at Graz Airport.\n\nHanns Schell Collection: key and lock museum, largest of its kind in the world.\n\nAustrian Sculpture Park: seven hectares of contemporary sculpture.\n\nBotanical Garden of Graz: three architecturally interesting glass houses plus gardens.\n\nArchitecture\n\n[edit]\n\nThe city centre and the adjacent districts are characterized by the historic residential buildings and churches. In the outer districts buildings are predominantly of the architectural styles from the second half of the 20th century.\n\nIn 1965 the Graz School (Grazer Schule) was founded. Several buildings around the universities are of this style, e.g. the green houses by Volker Giencke and the RESOWI Centre by Günther Domenig.\n\nBefore Graz became European Capital of Culture in 2003, several new projects were realized, such as the Stadthalle - a multifunctional space for e.g. conventions and concerts -, the Children's Museum (Kindermuseum), the Helmut-List-Halle, the Museum of Contemporary Art (Kunsthaus) and the Island in the Mur (Murinsel).\n\nTallest buildings\n\nBuildings in Graz which are at least 50m tall:\n\nName or Address Completion Usage Height (m) floors 1.

Grazer AK also won an Austrian championship, but went into administration in 2007 and was excluded from the professional league system.\n\nIn ice hockey, ATSE Graz was the Austrian Hockey League champion in 1975 and 1978. EC Graz was runner-up in 1991–92, 1992–93 and 1993–94. Graz 99ers has played in the first division since 2000.\n\nUBSC Raiffeisen Graz plays in the Austrian Basketball League.\n\nGraz Giants play in the Austrian Football League (American Football).\n\nThe city bid for the 2002 Winter Olympics in 1995, but lost the election to Salt Lake City.\n\nStyriarte\n\n[edit]\n\nGraz hosts the annual festival of classical music Styriarte, founded in 1985 to tie conductor Nikolaus Harnoncourt closer to his hometown. Events have been held at different venues in Graz and in the surrounding region.\n\nDialect\n\n[edit]\n\nReferred to as Steirisch by locals, Graz belongs to the Austro-Bavarian region of dialects, more specifically a mix of Central Bavarian in the western part of Styria and Southern Bavarian in the eastern part.[33] The Grazer ORF, the Graz subsidiary of Austrian Broadcasting Corporation, launched an initiative in 2008 called Scho wieda Steirisch g'redt to highlight the numerous dialects of Graz and Styria in general and to cultivate the pride many Styrians hold for their local culture. Two reasons for a melding of these dialects with Standard German: the influence of television and radio bringing Standard German into the home and the industrialization causing the disappearance of the single farmer since the farming communities are seen as the true keepers of dialect speaking.[34]\n\nTransport\n\n[edit]\n\nAn extensive public transport network makes Graz an easy city to navigate without a car. The city has a comprehensive bus network, complementing the Graz tram network, which has six lines. Four lines pass through the underground tram stop at the central train station (Hauptbahnhof) and on to the city centre before branching out. Furthermore, there are eight night-time bus routes, although these run only at weekends and on evenings preceding public holidays.\n\nThe Castle Hill funicular (Schlossbergbahn), and the Castle Hill lift (Schlossberg lift), a vertical lift, link the city centre to the Castle Hill (Schlossberg).\n\nFrom the central train station (Hauptbahnhof), regional trains link to most of Styria. Direct trains run to most major cities nearby including Vienna, Salzburg, Innsbruck, Maribor and Ljubljana in Slovenia, Zagreb in Croatia, Budapest in Hungary, Prague and Brno in the Czech Republic, Zürich in Switzerland, as well as Munich, Stuttgart, Heidelberg, and Frankfurt in Germany. Trains for Vienna leave every hour. In recent years many railway stations within the city limits and in the suburbs have been rebuilt or modernised and are now part of the Styria S-Bahn, a commuter train service connecting the city with its suburban area and towns nearby.\n\nGraz Airport is located about 10 km (6 mi) south of the city centre and is accessible by bus, railway, taxi and car. Direct destinations include Berlin, Düsseldorf, Frankfurt, Hamburg, Munich, Vienna and Zurich.[35] In 2021 a two-line metro system was proposed for Graz,[36] which would make Graz the second Austrian city with a rapid transit system after Vienna.\n\nHealth\n\n[edit]\n\nIn Graz there are seven hospitals, several private hospitals and sanatoriums, as well as 44 pharmacies.\n\nThe University Hospital Graz (LKH-Universitäts-Klinikum Graz) is located in eastern Graz and has 1,556 beds and 7,190 employees. The Regional Hospital Graz II (LKH Graz II) has two sites in Graz. The western site (LKH Graz II Standort West) is located in Eggenberg and has 280 beds and about 500 employees, the southern site (LKH Graz II Standort Süd) specializes in neurology and psychiatry and is located in Straßgang with 880 beds and 1,100 employees. The AUVA Accident Hospital (Unfallkrankenhaus der AUVA) is in Eggenberg and has 180 beds and a total of 444 employees.\n\nThe Albert Schweitzer Clinic in the western part of the city is a geriatric hospital with 304 beds, the Hospital of St. John of God (Krankenhaus der Barmherzigen Brüder) has two sites in Graz, one in Lend with 225 beds and one in Eggenberg with 260 beds. The Hospital of the Order of Saint Elizabeth (Krankenhaus der Elisabethinen) in Gries has 182 beds.\n\nThere are several private clinics as well: the Privatklinik Kastanienhof, the Privatklinik Leech, the Privatklinik der Kreuzschwestern, the Sanatorium St. Leonhard, the Sanatorium Hansa and the Privatklinik Graz-Ragnitz.\n\nEMS in Graz is provided solely by the Austrian Red Cross. Perpetually two emergency doctor's cars (NEF – Notarzteinsatzfahrzeug), two NAWs (Notarztwagen – ambulances staffed with a physician in addition to regular personnel) and about 30 RTWs (Rettungswagen – regular ambulances) are on standby. Furthermore, several non-emergency ambulances (KTW – Krankentransportwagen) and a Mobile Intensive Care Unit (MICU) are operated by the Red Cross to transport non-emergency patients to and between hospitals. In addition to the Red Cross, the Labourers'-Samaritan-Alliance (Arbeiter-Samariter-Bund Österreichs), the Austrian organisation of the Order of Malta Ambulance Corps (Malteser Hospitaldienst Austria) and the Green Cross (Grünes Kreuz) operate ambulances (KTW) for non-emergency patient transport. In addition to the cars, there's also the C12 air ambulance helicopter stationed at Graz airport, staffed with an emergency physician in addition to regular personnel.\n\nInternational relations\n\n[edit]\n\nTwin towns and sister cities\n\n[edit]\n\nGraz is twinned with:[37]\n\nOther forms of cooperation and city friendship similar to the twin city programmes\n\nNiš, Serbia\n\nBanja Luka, Bosnia and Herzegovina\n\nNotable residents\n\n[edit]\n\nThe following are past and present notable residents of Graz.\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nAustria portal\n\nList of World Heritage Sites in Austria\n\nKastner & Öhler\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\n\"Graz: Stadtplanung und Stadtentwicklung (Rechnungshofbericht, 2006) in German\" (PDF). 2006.
