        "text": "“I’ll be back!”, “There is no tumor!” or “Get to the chopper!” Who did not grow up with these amazing one-liners ? I am of course talking about the famous action star Arnold Schwarzenegger who took the action movie genre by storm with classics like The Terminator, Commando, Predator and Total Recall during the 80’s and early 90’s. Arnold was born in a small village called Thal, which is a small 20 minute drive from Graz. Today his childhood home is open to the public and gives you the opportunity to visit the Arnold Schwarzenegger museum!\n\nWhen I arrived in Austria with my 30,000 km road trip through Europe I had to visit the home of Arnold! Here we go!\n\nHow do I get to the Arnold Schwarzenegger Museum?\n\nThe museum is easy to find by Google Maps. Just use the address in the navigator and it will take you right to the house.\n\nWith public transportation you can use the following options according to the museum’s website:\n\nFrom Jakominiplatz, bus No. 40, to bus stop Gösting\n\nor from central station with tram No. 1,3 or 7 to stop “Waagner Biro Straße / PVA”, then short footpath to stop Daungasse/Wasserturm, by bus No. 85 to bus stop Gösting.\n\nFrom Gösting by bus No. 48 to bus stop Thalersee.\n\nShort footpath on the federal highway along the Thalersee in the direction of the golf course.\n\nFollow on your right side the signposts uphill to the museum, Linakstraße 9.\n\nHow much does it cost to visit the Arnold Schwarzenegger Museum?\n\nAdults: Concessions*: Children from 5 to 14 years / school groups: € 8,90 € 6,90 € 3,90\n\nMy experience visiting the museum\n\nIt might look a bit small on the outside, but the museum is actually a decent size. I have spent about 1.5 hours inside and if you follow the route you will encounter different rooms that share stories of Arnold during different phases of his life.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BYa_GbZAYrV/?taken-by=theroadtripguy\n\nThe first room as all about his childhood and how he grew up in Austria and found his passion for bodybuilding and his time serving in the military. After that you can visit the political room about his time serving as the governor of California.\n\nThe third room shows his bodybuilding career and has some amazing old photos of a young Arnold posing his way into h]Hollywood and 7 Mr. Olympia titles. There is also some dumbbells, barbells and an old bench press that was used by him. As a fitness fanatic myself this was a wonderful experience!\n\nThe last room is all about his Hollywood career and all the movies that he made. It has several filmprops and unique behind the scenes material. It has the famous quote: “I’ll be back” printed on top of the staircase when you exit the last room. Well, I definitely will be back as it was a great experience for a very affordable price.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BYbQba5AT51/?taken-by=theroadtripguy"
