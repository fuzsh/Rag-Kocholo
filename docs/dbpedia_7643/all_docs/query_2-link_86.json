Their purpose is to dramatize, glamorize, and politicize the grand theatrical values of creative life.\n\nDiplomatic charm\n\n[Sweetly Suave Shukra] -ruled Purvaphalguni gentlemen are often found in the sparkling bright worlds of politics , romantic idealism, entertainment, speculative finance, and spectator sports. Yoni-born chaps often display a thick mane of leonine hair and a charming sense of humor.\n\nThey are happiest when enjoying a choreographed sport, playing music, dancing with agility and grace, or performing a richly costumed dramatic role for an appreciative audience, delighted by spectacle and applause, they glitter and smile at parties, political campaigns, gambling and games..\n\nDepending upon the placements of dhanakaraka Shukra and dhana=pati Budha, the Purvarjuni-born may also excel in financial showmanship, bargaining toward a political or commercial agreement, and the high drama of romantic relationships.\n\nLike all Shukra-governed births, bhagadaivata-born must take care to avoid the misuse of drugs and alcohol. Political success depends upon the charisma of lagnesha Surya. Financial success depends upon the dual-dhanakaraka Shukra and Budha.\n\nThemes of political celebrity, lavish musical entertainments, arts and fashion, and financial agreements may contextualize Pubba's terrestrial experience. Applies also to Chandra-Purvaphalguni.\n\nBiographical events matched to the Vimshottari Dasha calendar\n\nCalif-Gov 1947- Terminator Arnold Schwarzenegger\n\n[Ketu Mahadasha] [age birth until age 0.2 month]\n\n[Ketu-Vṛścika] [Ketu in classroom-4]\n\nWed-30-Jul-1947 Earth-birth in Graz, austria * Ketu-Budha chidra-dasha * Budha rules kārakāmsha Kanya-2 finance, 10th-from-Chandra visibility, recognition\n\n[Shukra Mahadasha] [age 0.2 month until age 20.2]\n\n[Shukra-Karkata] [Shukra-12] [Pushya-Shukra-yuti-Surya-Pushya] [Pushya-Shukra-yuti-Shani-Aśleṣa]\n\nFeb-1958 until Feb-1961 Janma Sade-Sati Dhanus\n\n[5 celebrity, display, gamesmanship, theatre, romance, idealism, speculation, intelligence, children]\n\n[age 11-14]\n\n1962 [AS age 15] in response to his intimidating, belittling father, began bodybuilding * Shukra-Shani bhukti * Shani rules 6-animosity\n\n[Surya Mahadasha] [age 20.2 until age 26.2]\n\n[Surya-Karkata] [Surya in bhava-12] [Pushya-Surya-yuti-Shukra-Pushya] [Pushya-Surya-yuti-Shani-Aśleṣa-vikala]\n\n1967 [AS age 20] won the Mr. Universe title * Surya-Surya svabhukti * Surya lagnesha\n\nSep-1968 [AS age 21] immigrate into USA * Surya-Mangala bhukti * ātmakāraka yogakaraka Mangala rules 4 + 9\n\n1969 [AS age 22] begins five-year domestic union with English language instructor, barbara Outlander * Surya-Rahu bhukti\n\n1972 [AS age 25] An assiduous goal-setter and investor in the body-building industry, aS becomes a US-dollar-millionaire by age 25 * Surya-Shukra chidra-dasha * Shukra-12 rules [Mriga-Kuja-yuti-Rahu-Kṛttikā] [10]\n\n13-Dec-1972 [AS age 25] grieved the decease of his alienated father * Surya-Shukra chidra-dasha * Shukra rules 2nd-from-pitristhana\n\n[Chandra Mahadasha] [age 26 until age 36]\n\n[Chandra-Dhanus] [Chandra in Mūla - Vichruta] [Chandra in classroom-5]\n\n1974 [AS age 27] end domestic relationship with partner B.

Their purpose is to broker agreements and balance the interests of multiple ambitious stakeholders.\n\nSocial justice, personal power\n\n[Risk-rewarding Rahu] -ruled Svatika ladies tend to be fascinating figures. By skillfully mixing and trading with different folks, svatika ladies build exotic exchange relationships. They are often found in policy organizations and government agencies, where their social equity work is distinctively multi-cultural. Their roles include trader, exchanger, negotiator, deal-maker, broker, marriage-matcher, alliance-designer, and other balancing activities that engage two mismatched sides within one functional agreement.\n\nSvatika represents Rahu's desire to amplify Shukra's quest for harmonious agreements. Rahu challenges cultural boundaries. The mix-master may skillfully combine unusual agents and mismatched agendas in order to obtain a rebalanced status. Similar to Sadachbia, the Svatika-born are mixed-system orchestrators who may take direction from Otherworldly sources. The character of Rahu is determinative.\n\nDue to their Rahu-gifted ability to think outside the box, Svatika-born may realize previously unthinkable opportunities for diplomacy and fair exchange. Their success is noted in negotiation, trade-deals, and bargaining in commodities, ideas, or services.\n\nIn politics, Nishthya ladies may be associated with social, ideological, financial, or physical integration of previously hostile or excluded participants. Vayu-born graciously mix people and environments that were once segregated, gracefully pairing various ethnicities, religions, naations, or individuals of differing practice.\n\nTheir primary pursuit of a social justice agenda is not entirely idealistic. It is ultimately motivated by their desire to obtain privilege by facilitating partnerships to enhance opportunities for trade and exchange.\n\nThemes of opportunity, fascination with appearances, and acquisition of privilege may contextualize Svatika's terrestrial experience.
