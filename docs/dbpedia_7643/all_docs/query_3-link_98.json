        "text": "The state of Styria is located in the southeast of Austria. It is the second largest Austrian state that borders with Je druhou největší rakouskou spolkovou zemí a hraničí se Slovenia. You would find interesting that Arnold Schwarzenegger was born there and was growing up there, or Elfriede Jelinek, a Nobel Prize in literature. But it was nature that makes Styria famous, rather than famous figures. No wonder a green heart is its official symbol as it symbolize a harmony between nature and man. Every visitor experienced that when he/she visited the region. Locals sometimes joke around saying: Graz is without its surroundings as a salad without pumpkin oil. Well, we look in Graz for few moments.\n\nThe Graz Region is rich for culture and traditions as well as its surroundings that keeps its naturalness and independence. You can find there places untouched by urban life as well as self-confident places with unique atmosphere. Frohnleiten an der Mur is a picturesque town with the large pilgrim church Judendorf-Straßengel, there is also an idyll town of strong>Thal - a pilgrim site of the Arnold Schwarzenegger fans from all around the world. These are only examples of the places that make Graz famous. Sport fans would like many golf courses, those who like adrenaline will enjoy hang-gliders or paragliding, tourists as well as bikers can explore hilly terrain and people fond of romance may swim in crystal clear nature lakes. The Region of Graz will satisfy your stomach. You won’t leave this place hungry since local restaurants since local restaurants with nice wine yards will offer you many delicacies. Specialties with white wine and pumpkin oil are typical and traditional elements of local cuisine. Those who like culture and history will appreciate the Stübing open-air folk museum, where visitors among 90 alpine buildings can learn that in local bathrooms people had used saunas long before they even knew what a Finnish sauna is. They can also go to an industrial complex near Deutschfeistritz, or near to Reine the oldest Cistercian monastery in the world. Except all known tourist, cultural and sport attraction please accept an invitation to some of several following attractions.\n\nAmong greatest attractions for sportsmen will be also Biking opening in Statteg.. Mountain bikers start there new season. Also biking competition for hedonists, the Tour de Mur, has a stop in Graz. But that is not everything. Except that there will also take place the Genuss Spektakel gastronomic festival where you will see roasting, mixing, baking, tasting, drinking and dancing. \"A long table in the center of an old town \" in Graz will be about gastronomic specialties. It will be for the fourth time and the event takes place right in Graz, in the center. Visitors can enjoy menu of five courses and also enjoy a unique atmosphere of this event, town and region.\n\nAlso those who love adrenalin will love Styria. New experiences in nature you will experience on a 2,5 kilometer flight to valley on the Zipline near the town of Gröbming. It is the largest facility of this kind in Europe. Up to four bold men can ride in more than 115 kilometer/hour down the valley. For less bold we offer you a hanging bridge at Dachstein from where you will have great view over Austrian mountain peaks.\n\nFor adventurers Styria offers cross-border adventure – treasure hunt in which you will solve puzzles and undergo some competitions. This unusual experience takes place on the Slovenian borderline under guidance of local guides. At the end we will return to Graz. We recommend you to visit the renowned universal Joanneum Museum that will guide you through 400 million years of the Styrian land.\n\nStyria is a beautiful land that will offer you more than you would expect. If you seek information on options of tourism, vacation or accommodation in this state you may find it HERE.\n\nText: Oskar Mažgút\n\nPřeklad: Stanislava Waniová\n\nSource and photo: steiermark.com, Dachlandschaft (c) Graz Tourismus - Harry Schiffer (45), Frohnleiten (c) Region Graz - Harry Schiffer (10), Genuss_Lange Tafel (c) Graz Tourismus - Harry Schiffer (1), Mountainbike (c) Jürgen Pail + (19), Radfahren_Frohnleiten (c) Region Graz - Tom Lamm (6), Stübing (c) Region Graz - Hans Wiesenhofer (33), Stübing (c) Region Graz - Harry Schiffer (2)"
