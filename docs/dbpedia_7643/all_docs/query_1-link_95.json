        "text": "Although it greatly depresses the staff of TheArnoldFans for not being able to finance a trip to Schwarzenegger's birthplace, we at least had our friend Christian Haase represent TheArnoldFans for us when he traveled to Thal to meet with several of Arnold's good friends at the Arnie's Life museum.\n\nTake it away, Christian!\n\n\"On July 30, I was planning on going on a trip to Thal, near Graz, in Austria. I had a reason why I came here on that date – it was the 66th birthday of our hero! The museum staff also released something very special on this day – an Arnold bronze casting. Total of only 15 pieces were made as a “limited edition”. The front shows the profile of Arnold Schwarzenegger as governor, the back the Styrian crest and the crest of Thal with the inscription: “Arnold Schwarzenegger Museum Thal” (weight: 2300 g, height: 130 mm, width: 105 mm).\n\nI was welcomed by a beautiful sunny Austrian summer and was getting really excited with each mile that I came closer. After I went through the museum for quiet a while, I finally told the receptionist, Ms Forstner, that I was representing TheArnoldFans.com. She was so kind and organized an interview slot for me with Peter Urdl, the founder.\n\nI had the chance to listen to Peter Urdl (founder of the museum and former class mate of Arnold), Helmut Gombocz (also founder of the museum), Kurt Marnul (Arnold’s first trainer in Thal and the first Mr. Austria ever) and Karl Kainrath (one of Arnold’s first training partners - until he moved to Munich). They come together here from time-to-time. After a very special birthday cake they took a picture together, which Peter will send to Arnold in the evening to say hi and wish him all the best! All his old friends were here and celebrating his birthday.\n\nWe went outside into the garden of Arnold’s birth house, which is now the museum and they were talking about their time in the 60s, when they met Arnold, worked with him, trained with him, did funny stuff together, or just talked about how proud they are of Arnold. It was an incredible time listening to all the old stories like when Arnold came to Graz, wanted to buy a smoking jacket with Peter Urdl, and after he put it on, the whole back ripped of because of his muscles.\n\nPeter Urdl and Helmut Gombacz, initiators of the Arnold Schwarzenegger Museum in Arnold’s hometown Thal (Austria), have been honored for their passionate commitment concerning the museum and keeping some extraordinary culture in this little town and its area. With their help, all Arnold fans, friends or other interested people are able to get to see the different stages of our hero’s life with some exclusive pictures and exhibits. Thus, not only TheArnoldFans are thankful for that, now even the government of Austria honored Mr. Urdl and Mr. Gombacz with the country’s highest distinction - The Golden Badge!\n\nArnold himself thanks his long-term friend with a truly thankful video. You can watch it on the facebook page of the Arnold Schwarzenegger Museum at Facebook You can find the video on March, 23. Since Arnold’s message is in German, I was feeling so free to quickly translate it for you! Please check it out right here:\n\n\"Hello Peter, hello Herbert, hello Styria representatives. Of course I would love to be with you in Graz right now - you know that I love to be at home in the Steiermark. Unfortunatelly this time it doesn’t work, but somehow I’m still with you right now. Just like at each of my visits, history comes alive to me, and very affecting. Peter, have you ever thought that something would happen, just like it does now? The two highest Styrians honor you with the highest distinction of the country. And I’ll send you congratulations from Los Angeles for this. Because it was you, who raised a monument in our Thal for me and for my life, which was really successful. If I was with you today, I would give you a big hug for that! And Helmut Gombocz as well, of course. Both of you really deserve this distinction. I would like to cordially shake hands with Franz Voves and Hermann Schützenhöfer, as a big thank you, that you can see the importance of your work and of the museum. I would also like to congratulate Franz Voves and Hermann Schützenhöfer, that they are now working together. Styria’s people deserve it. Best wishes and keep up the good work. And you know: I’ll be back!”"
