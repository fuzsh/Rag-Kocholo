        "text": "“Don’t just worry about climbing a ladder that someone else has built. No, build your own ladder. Just don’t wait for anyone else. That’s what I did.”\n\n— Arnold Schwarzenegger\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger (@schwarzenegger) is an Austrian-born bodybuilder, actor, businessman, philanthropist, bestselling author, and politician.

Since his time in the Governor’s house, he’s been working diligently to combat climate change, anti-semitism, ensure fair voting practices, help youth, work with Veterans, and inspire healthy living.\n\nPlease enjoy!\n\nListen to the episode on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Overcast, Podcast Addict, Pocket Casts, Castbox, Google Podcasts, Amazon Music, or on your favorite podcast platform.

Austria was not built by people sleeping in. America was not built by people sleeping in. People struggled, people suffered, people worked their asses off to build this country.”\n\n— Arnold Schwarzenegger\n\n“Through comfort no one ever grows.”\n\n— Arnold Schwarzenegger\n\n“Don’t just worry about climbing a ladder that someone else has built. No, build your own ladder. Just don’t wait for anyone else. That’s what I did.”\n\n— Arnold Schwarzenegger\n\n“I realized then the importance of selling. That no matter what you have—if you have a podcast, if you have a movie, if you have a painting, if you have a car, a technology, a medicine, whatever it is—if people don’t know about it, you have nothing. The more people that know about your product or about your talent, the more you can go and be successful.”\n\n— Arnold Schwarzenegger\n\n“You can be the biggest celebrity in the world, but you still get your back pain. You still get your hip pain. You still get your shoulder pain. You still get your elbow pain. You still get numb fingers. You still have to watch your heart. You still have to watch the diet. … This is all so that we stay alive longer. The time you’re born, your time is set. It’s set. The only thing that changes it is you.”\n\n— Arnold Schwarzenegger\n\n“I’m the guy that climbs up Mount Everest and sees another bunch of peaks, ‘Oh, my God, I didn’t even know they were there.’ And I climb them. That’s what I do, just a continuous climb. Nothing changes.”\n\n— Arnold Schwarzenegger\n\n“In lifting, you can only know how much you lift if you’re willing to fail.”\n\n— Arnold Schwarzenegger\n\n“I’m not a self-made man. I have to recognize that my training, my money, everything comes from a lot of different people. … When you recognize that, you now have the responsibility of going out and helping others.”\n\n— Arnold Schwarzenegger\n\nPEOPLE MENTIONED\n\nGustav Schwarzenegger\n\nLászló Papp\n\nMeinhard Schwarzenegger\n\nJoe Weider\n\nMaria Shriver\n\nSteve Reeves\n\nReg Park\n\nClint Eastwood\n\nCharles Bronson\n\nWarren Beatty\n\nKirk Douglas\n\nAnn-Margret\n\nLucille Ball\n\nJohn Milius\n\nJames Cameron\n\nDanny DeVito\n\nIvan Reitman\n\nKelly Preston\n\nTom Pollock\n\nAnnie Leibovitz\n\nAndy Warhol\n\nJamie Wyeth\n\nFranco Columbu\n\nDave Draper\n\nSergio Oliva\n\nBill Pearl\n\nMuhammad Ali\n\nMichael Jordan\n\nSargent Shriver\n\nRelated"
