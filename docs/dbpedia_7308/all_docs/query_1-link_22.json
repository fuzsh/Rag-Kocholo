        "text": "By Gloria Methri\n\nNorwegian software vendor Commercial Banking Applications (CBA), has announced that Landsbankinn in Iceland is benefitting from the seamless integration of Swift’s Transaction Screening Service (TSS) with CBA’s IBAS GBF – Global Banking Factory – which the bank uses to run its banking operations in payments and trade finance.\n\nThe integration with Swift TSS ensures that all incoming and outgoing messages, independent of banking products, are screened in real-time against the most up-to-date sanctions lists during IBAS business processing. Bank users are instantly alerted if anything suspicious is detected.\n\n“We are using Swift’s TSS functionality as part of our transaction processing within IBAS, to improve alert quality and accuracy in sanction screening and also to reduce the number of false positives being handled by our operations staff,” said Audur Bjarnadottir, Head of International Payment in Landsbankinn.\n\n“The CBA team has made the integration with Swift TSS very smooth, allowing us to benefit from automatic transaction screening in real time. This all happens as a workflow during the real-time processing of business events in IBAS GBF. The integration helps us to focus on the quality of all transactions while delivering efficiency savings and reducing the time spent on manual tasks,” he added.\n\nIBAS GBF enables all message types, including payments, trade finance and other banking transactions, to be scanned in real-time via Swift TSS whether these originate as MT messages, or in ISO-compliant MX or SEPA format.\n\nThe integration uses REST APIs and the IBAS CLL (call) framework, enabling sanction screening to be automatically executed. IBAS GBF also automates all follow-up actions, enabling transactions that pass the screening process to pass straight through, while those identified as potential hits are held and automatically flagged for further investigation."
