We have print in all different shapes and forms, digital platforms, physical backdrops, screens, wearables, all communicating in a multiple space global environment. Parachute® with its team of experts, will design your brand typeface with a cohesive visual language across the entire communication space and optimise its performance in virtually any environment. Imagining, creating and generating typefaces is our thing. We understand the needs of our clients beyond local markets, we translate the emotional aspects of your brand into the right typeface, we help you keep pace of the technology race and convey your message in style.\n\nRecently, D&AD invited Panos Vassiliou, who was appointed President of the Type Design Competition, to write an article on how typography affects the visual language of a brand. Here, in a few sentences, you will find out how typography has become the star of the visual communications industry and why it is so important for your company to invest in its own custom typeface.\n\nOUR STUDIO\n\nParachute® is more than a type foundry. It is an experimental space, a typographic playground expressed in a design studio, showroom and concept store under one roof with our creative hub Typeroom®. A place to experiment, play and create. Our team is a small visionary group of type designers, graphic designers, font engineers and copywriters who have effectively collaborated with leading international organizations to incorporate complex custom type design into their brand’s strategic plan and convey their message in style. We use the power of typography to transform living brands to global brands and local leaders to next-generation global leaders. Our work has earned numerous accolades with top honours from TDC, Red Dot, European Design Awards, Tokyo TDC, HiiiBrand, German Design Awards, Communication Arts and many others.\n\nREQUEST A QUOTE\n\nIf you would like to request a quote and talk to us about custom work or corporate licensing, get in touch and we will be more than happy to chat with you on how we can design the right typeface for your next project.
