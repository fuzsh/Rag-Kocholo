        "text": "The Challenge for Landsbankinn\n\nWhat is important to focus on when you are choosing a vulnerability management tool?\n\nWe needed to ensure our new vulnerability management program was reliable. In our evaluation, we found differences in simplicity, quality, and human factors that could have a big impact in reliability of results.\n\nWhat issues needed to be solved?\n\nWe were interested in establishing a vulnerability management program. We needed to address security threats and compliance but also wanted to understand how existing vulnerabilities could be used against us in any kind of attack. We were interested in the efficiency of moving from vulnerability identification to resolution through patching.\n\nWhy did you choose Outpost24?\n\nWhen Landsbankinn thoroughly evaluated Outpost24 for the essential activities, we gave priorities within the frameworks that were up-to-date and continuously secure. Additionally, the solution had to address our compliance requirements.\n\nAdvancement to becoming a mature security organization\n\nLandsbankinn is a great example of a financial organization taking the shift in focus from reactive to proactive security measures.\n\nThe introduction of a continuous process of vulnerability detection and enablement of reporting security process to management provided an internal process for documented and formal operational security strategy towards more scale and automation.\n\nThe vulnerability management solutions provided by Outpost24 were a big part of the enterprise security technology architecture with an emphasis on prevention, detection, and response.\n\n“We needed to get a true picture of our vulnerabilities if we wanted to eradicate them and have a secure environment.”\n\nHow did you prepare for adapting a vulnerability management program?\n\nSince we already had a vulnerability management software in place, it was more of replacing the existing technology and collaborating with Outpost24. This is where Outpost24’s knowledge was a real asset during the testing phase, which in turn made the transition a smooth process.\n\nWhat are the main benefits Landsbankinn has experienced from using Outpost24’s solutions?\n\nWhen we installed Outpost24 in our application environment, our security operations team really appreciated the ease of use of this tool, its speed to perform scans, and the flexibility to match internal processes.\n\nWhat lessons would you suggest to others planning to invest in vulnerability management?\n\nThere are various aspects that need to be taken into consideration. For example, finding a reliable partner that is willing to share experiences with you is key. Also, a solution that integrates well within your current processes and procedures. And lastly, having an approach that brings results and reports that you can fully trust is vitally important.\n\nWhich benefits has your vulnerability management program brought to you?\n\nWe have had challenges in explaining the vulnerabilities to our developers. Working with Outpost24 has simplified the task of convincing them to close the gaps."
