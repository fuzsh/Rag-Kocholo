Here are their highlights: 👨👨👧👦 Membership growth: We quadrupled our chapter's membership to nearly 120, with ESRAG's global membership now at an impressive 1600+. And the best part is, everyone can join. Join us now! https://lnkd.in/gZJPb38M 🌍 Shaping global presence: We hosted influential speakers, delivered presentations worldwide, ignited discussions, provoked change, and initiated local and regional projects in critical areas such as #biodiversity, #food, #pollution, #climate solutions, and #circulareconomy. 7️⃣ Strategic planning: Our task forces on crucial issues like clean #cooking, plant-rich #diets, and planetary #boundaries played a significant role in Rotary International's decision to add \"Protecting the Environment\" as its 7th Area of Focus. This is a testament to our collective dedication and impact. 🏁 Significant collaborations: We prepared the Rotary delegation for #COP26 in Glasgow, a milestone moment, and as we look ahead, the next climate talks are on the horizon. 👑 Generation change: Three years after Malc Rooney and Kirsten Weber co-chaired the chapter, Chris Davies and Mohammad Alramahi now succeed them. Kirsten says, 'Being part of the ESRAG movement has been a labor of love, and I'm very proud of the progress we've made, particularly in Great Britain and Ireland. All of this has been made possible through the incredible dedication, enthusiasm, and support of our members and partners; you are the driving force propelling us forward.

In an article for Yevgeniya Afanasenko, a member of the Association of Sustainable Development Experts and Principal Environmental Advisor at EBRD, spoke about the priorities of Ukraine's green recovery and why it is worth investing in a carbon-free economy. We recommend reading the article: https://lnkd.in/eVshmifC ✅ Ms. Afanasenko is a moderator of the 6th panel of the International Sustainability Forum 2023, where together with leading speakers we will discuss Ukraine's transition to a green economy and the path to decarbonization.\n\nEurope Day, celebrated annually on May 9th, commemorates the historic Schuman Declaration of 1950, which proposed the creation of a unified European community, laying the foundation for the European Union. 🌏 In the context of sustainability, Europe Day serves as a reminder of the EU's commitment to environmental stewardship and sustainable development. Across the continent, initiatives promoting renewable energy, biodiversity conservation, waste reduction, and climate action are integral parts of EU policies and frameworks. Europe's ambitious targets, such as the European Green Deal and the Paris Agreement commitments, 📜 underscore its determination to transition towards a greener, more sustainable future. Through collaborative efforts, 🤝 innovative technologies, and proactive legislation, Europe strives to lead the global fight against climate change while fostering economic prosperity and social equity for current and future generations. 💚\n\nThe ESRAG Rotary Great Britain & Ireland Chapter looks back at the time after its foundation in February 2020.
