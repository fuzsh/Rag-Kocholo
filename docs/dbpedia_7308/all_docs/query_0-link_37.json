        "text": "Investors were unimpressed by the Worldline H1 results as management blamed the economy and poor spring weather for slow growth in its merchant services division. The share price is down 90% since 2021. Looking ahead, new partnerships (such with Credit Agricole Payment Services) are expected to restore topline growth while cost-cutting, including shifting staff to low-cost countries, boosts profits. https://lnkd.in/d7BHT3V7\n\nQ2 update from Global Payments Inc. shows European merchant revenue growth slowing as the EVO acquisition drops out of the numbers. The UK has \"stabilised\" after years of underperformance. Poland and Greece are looking good and management is very bullish about Commerz Globalpay GmbH, the new bank partnership in Germany.\n\nDan Wagner is back. He's floating Rezolve AI on Nasdaq via a SPAC. Rezolve has been around for a while but I've not seen any end user announcements. Does anyone have any experience of using Resolve's products? Good, bad or indifferent? I'd like to know. https://lnkd.in/efp3sV7c\n\nAnother solid quarter for Visa and Mastercard in Europe with their combined volume up 11% in Euros. After a quiet couple of years, Visa is winning issuing portfolios again including at Lloyds Bank and Raiffeisen. Meanwhile, Mastercard reports 2x volume for Maestro cards migrated to debit Mastercard. https://lnkd.in/e8r3qAjz\n\nUK based DNA Payments Group rumoured to be considering purchase of the acquiring/acceptance business of card complete Service Bank AG of Austria for €70-€80m. Card Complete is owned by UniCredit, Raiffeisen Bank International AG and the City of Vienna. https://lnkd.in/da-33EjF\n\nThis is a strong endorsement of open banking from PayPoint plc but the valuation of \"just\" c.£50m for obconnect demonstrates there are no unicorns at the end of this rainbow. Investors in some of the more well-funded open banking start-ups will be wondering if they will make a return.\n\nBanco Sabadell is still committed to selling its merchant services business (380,000 merchants, 20% market share in Spain) to Nexi but the deal is on hold until mid-2025. Sabadell needs to defeat BBVA's hostile takeover first. BBVA has not commented on its plans for merchant services should it be successful in taking over the Catalan bank. https://lnkd.in/eiUQiRq7\n\nDespite the €170m cost of closing down its Munich operations, underlying Q2 performance PagoNxt (a Santander company) has been positive. Volume and revenue were up 9% and EBITDA doubled to €69m. This is a good example of a bank doing payments well. https://lnkd.in/ehkFx3Ws\n\nBlimey. Kevin is in trouble with the regulator. This high profile open banking start-up raised $65m but has been making significant layoffs. The employee count has fallen from 351 to 190 over the past 12 months. What's happening? https://lnkd.in/eZ5mqw5K\n\nCardnet was hit by the cost of living crisis impacting its core UK high street merchants. Volume, revenue and profits at the Lloyds Banking Group/Fiserv joint-venture all fell in 2023. However, the business is investing to return to growth and won a very good deal to become the exclusive supplier to PayPoint plc, the UK's largest ISO. https://lnkd.in/dfCcBQ8b"
