        "text": "Icelandic post-punk trio Kælan Mikla are celebrating their sisterhood with bandmate and keyboardist Sólveig with the spellbinding live music video for “Næturblóm”.\n\nOn this fantastic track, the band elaborate:\n\n“Næturblóm, meaning Nightflowers, is one of Kælan Mikla’s most euphoric songs. The lyrics to it are actually way older than the song itself and were originally a poem that [vocalist] Laufey gave to [keyboardist] Sólveig as her 20th birthday present a few years ago. It’s about how Laufey sees Sólveig as a beautiful flower that blooms in the winter darkness. An everlasting reminder of their friendship.”\n\nThe night flower herself—Sólveig, is a fantastic solo artist as well, and if you are a fan of Cocteau Twins, and Julee Cruise is highly recommended you listen to her recently released solo record Unexplained miseries & the acceptance of sorrow. That record is truly breathtaking; with vocals and synths evoking an empyrean catharsis that ascends from the very depths of sorrow.\n\nMeanwhile Kælan Mikla are set to perform at Iceland Airwaves the day before their new album Nótt eftir nótt drops, and have recorded the video for “Næturblóm” in association with the festival.\n\nAdditionally, the band, having just completed an extensive European tour with King Dude, and performing on two different festival bills with The Cure this summer, have a few dates left before the end of the year.\n\nLive Dates:\n\nNov 8 – Iceland Airwaves, Reykjavik, IS\n\nNov 9 – Den Sorte Firkant, Copenhagen, DK\n\nNov 10 – Fabrika Fest, Berlin, DE"
