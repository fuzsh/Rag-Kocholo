        "text": "The rugged and wild Icelandic nature with its mountains, cliffs, and lakes served as inspiration for this distinctive building. Additionally, its shape is inspired by Iceland's topography and forms a pentagon in its floor plan.\n\nAround 1.000 employees have been working in the bright, modern working environment since 2022.\n\nAn engineer from the Icelandic engineering firm Efla visited the SIGA Academy in Oslo, where he gained a lot of knowledge about airtight and windproof construction, especially in the window and facade area. The open cladding of a facade and related solutions were topics that were particularly relevant.\n\nThe facade of the impressive new building consists of only two materials: glass and basalt. The volcanic basalt stone weighs approximately 400kg per mÂ². The open cladding was thus very heavy that an unusual construction was required to hold the cladding in place. Further, SIGA assisted with the technical drawings."
