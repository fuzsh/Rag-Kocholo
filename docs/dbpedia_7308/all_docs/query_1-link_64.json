        "text": "Meniga is thrilled to announce having been selected as the PFM provider of Iceland’s two largest retail banks, Arion and Landsbanki, making Meniga’s PFM solution available to over 90% of Icelandic retail banking customers — the widest national reach of any PFM solution to date.\n\n“After the unqualified success of Meniga’s deployment with Islandsbanki in 2009, we are very pleased to be able to also offer Meniga’s PFM solution to the customers of Arion and Landsbanki. We are convinced that we will see the same level of high adoption and customer satisfaction that we’ve seen with Islandsbanki. We are also excited about working with all three major Icelandic banks on new offerings, to be announced soon, aimed at helping banks realize unparalleled ROI from PFM by better aligning their retail banking offerings to the possibilities offered by PFM.” Georg Ludviksson, CEO and Co-Founder of Meniga.\n\nBoth Arion and Landsbanki have around 30% market share in retail banking in Iceland and Meniga estimates that over 25% of Icelandic households will be using its PFM solution before the end of 2011.
