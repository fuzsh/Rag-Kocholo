If so, how long will it take?\n\nIf it is a valid IBAN; it may get credit to Bank's Account. Generally this account is used for quite a few Inter-Bank transfers and it may get lost.\n\nBest is your friend asks his Bank and mentions the error and you also write to your Bank. This may take a while to be sorted.\n\nThe above is based on my knowledge of Banking Industry and I have not had any such situation."
