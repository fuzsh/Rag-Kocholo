        "text": "Logi Pedro Stefánsson is a familiar face to anyone with an eye on Icelandic music. He’s created, produced, or championed many of the biggest acts in Icelandic hip hop, co-founded the label Les Frères Stefson, created the infamous 101derland studio, and, oh wait, did we forget Retro Stefson? Here are his top picks for Airwaves 2019.\n\nGDRN\n\nGDRN is a huge talent. She’s been recording her newest album here in 101derland and it’s really good. The thing about GDRN is she’s doing exactly what she wants to do and isn’t just chasing what’s hot right now. Everything she does is completely GDRN.\n\nuna schram\n\nuna schram is another huge talent. She was in a program called SNÆLDA that Unnsteinn, JFDR, a girl called Valdís, and I did together. It was a masterclass for women in music between 16 and 20, where we taught them the ropes of producing and songwriting and more. She’s very cool and I really like what she’s putting out.\n\nLoah\n\nLoah is an Irish singer/songwriter that I met in Sierra Leone. We were there together to work on some music with a bunch of British, Irish, Icelandic, and Sierra Leonean artists. She’s a solo pop artist that is, once again, a great talent.\n\nAuður\n\nAuður is on top of his game right now. He’s never been so popular. Every single song that he touches becomes popular. People just really vibe with his sound. I’d say if you are coming to Iceland Airwaves, you really have to see Auður.\n\nSIGGY\n\nSIGGY is a half-Icelandic singer/songwriter that lives in LA. She actually recorded a lot of songs in the 101derland. She makes futuristic R&B that is great stuff."
