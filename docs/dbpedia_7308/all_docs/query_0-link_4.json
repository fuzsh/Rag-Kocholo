The app is constantly being enhanced, securities in the app have been a real hit and electronic registration of mortgage papers was a great milestone. The Bank’s market share continues to grow. Surveys show that our customers are very satisfied with our services and that loyalty increases.\n\nAs these results show, the Bank’s operation is sound and stable, with fluctuating items linked to equities markets reducing profits so far this year. Interest income increases alongside growing activity as does commission income, mainly driven by successful asset management and capital market activity based on the Bank’s clear strategy. Operating expenses decrease slightly compared with the same period in 2021 and have been stable for several years.\n\nOur lending activity is robust. Lending to corporates grew by ISK 33 billion in H1, disregarding exchange rate impact. This increase was led by lending to the export sector, both the travel sector and fisheries enterprises - a clear sign of the strength of these sectors. Lending to residential housing construction continues to be a large part of the Bank’s lending activity. The lending/repayment cycle is shorter in the construction sector, leading to a balanced loan portfolio. We increased loan loss provisions against possible impairment mainly caused by growing risk from higher inflation and interest rate levels. In general, the position of borrowers is good and payment delinquency low. We are ready with varied solutions for customers who experience financial blows and encourage our customers to contact the Bank for advice and assistance.\n\nThe Bank has long been a proponent of sustainability and a new assessment by international rating firm Sustainalytics confirms for the second year in a row that the Bank is at exceedingly low risk of experiencing financial loss from environmental, social and governance factors (ESG). The Bank is among leading European banks in this field. This is an important outcome, one that solidifies Landsbankinn's reputation. It is also great to see how many companies are incorporating sustainability concerns to ensure operational success in the long term and contribute to responsible use of resources. We continue to issue Landsbankinn’s Sustainable Financing Label to companies who meet the criteria for sustainable financing.\n\nThe Bank’s success is based on strong foundations and fantastic staff. We want to foster an active and enjoyable workplace while also allowing for flexibility to work remotely in the short or longer term when it suits both parties. In the last quarter, we introduced new guidelines on remote work and flexibility that have been very well received. We also decided to ensure that employees receive 80% of wages during parental leave to support younger people.\n\nI am satisfied with our results. We intend to achieve our 10% ROE target and offer customers good and competitive terms. We are focused on simplifying life for our customers by offering smart solutions, easy access to advice and good support for business and investment activity. We are Landsbankinn, an ever-smarter bank - a modern bank with a personal approach. This results in strong customer relationships and makes Landsbankinn an exceptional partner.”\n\nKey figures from the profit and loss account for Q2 2022\n\nOperations:\n\nLandsbankinn's profit in Q2 2022 amounted to ISK 2.3 billion, compared with ISK 6.5 billion in Q2 2021.\n\nReturn on equity (ROE) was 3.5% in Q2 2022, compared with 9.8% for the same period the previous year.\n\nNet interest income in the quarter amounted to ISK 11.2 billion, compared with ISK 10.3 billion in Q2 2021.\n\nValue changes to lending and claims were positive by ISK 735 billion in Q2 2022 as compared with a positive change in the amount of ISK 293 billion in Q2 2021.\n\nNet fee and commission income was ISK 2.8 billion, compared with ISK 2.3 billion in Q2 2021.\n\nNet interest margin as a ratio of total assets was 2.6% in Q2 2022, compared with 2.5% in the same period the previous year.\n\nSalaries and related expenses amounted to ISK 3.6 billion, compared with ISK 3.7 billion in Q2 2021.\n\nOperating expenses less salaries and related expenses amounted to ISK 2.1 billion in Q2 2022, compared with ISK 2.2 billion for the same period in 2021.\n\nThe cost/income ratio in Q2 2022 was 49.3%, compared with 41.7% in the same quarter the previous year.\n\nFull-time equivalent positions at Landsbankinn were 786 as at 30 June 2022, down from 844 the same time the previous year.\n\nBalance sheet:\n\nLandsbankinn’s equity as at the end of June 2022 amounted to ISK 267.7 billion.\n\nThe Bank's total capital ratio on 30 June 2022 was 24.9%, down from 26.6% at year-end 2021.
