        "text": "Harvey Keitel (born May 13, 1939, Brooklyn, New York, U.S.) is an American film actor known for his swaggering tough-guy persona and wryly gruff delivery.\n\nKeitel served in the U.S. Marine Corps and then studied at the Actors Studio. In 1968 he made his film debut in Who’s That Knocking at My Door? (also released as I Call First). It was the first feature film directed by Martin Scorsese, and the two men later worked together on a number of notable movies, including Mean Streets (1973), Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore (1974), and Taxi Driver (1976).\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nPop Culture Quiz\n\nKnown for his Brooklyn accent and the intensity of his performances, Keitel played supporting or starring roles in such films as Bugsy (1991), for which he received an Academy Award nomination for his performance as Mickey Cohen; Thelma and Louise (1991); Reservoir Dogs (1991), Quentin Tarantino’s violent film about a botched robbery; Bad Lieutenant (1992), an NC-17 crime drama about a corrupt police officer; and Jane Campion’s The Piano (1993).\n\nKeitel’s later films included Pulp Fiction (1994), which reunited him with Tarantino; Red Dragon (2002); and National Treasure (2004) and its sequel, National Treasure: Book of Secrets (2007). He then appeared in the comedies Little Fockers (2010), Moonrise Kingdom (2012), and The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014); the latter two were directed by Wes Anderson. Keitel played a film agent in the futuristic thriller The Congress (2014); an actor in the collection of short films Rio, eu te amo (2014; Rio, I Love You); and an aging film director in the melancholically cynical Youth (2015)."
