Relive all the fun, laughter and irresistible music of Sister Act - the inspired comedy hit that packed pews everywhere!  Whoopi Goldberg stars as a sassy, low-rent lounge singer forced to hide out from the mob in the last place anyone would ever look for her - a convent.  While she's there, her irreverent behavior attracts a flock of faithful followers and turns the nuns' tone-deaf choir into a soulful chorus of swingin' singin' sisters.  But when the group earns rave reviews, her sudden celebrity jeopardizes her hidden identity.  Harvey Keitel and Kathy Najimy join a heavenly cast in this habit-forming comedy bursting with '60s Motown hits.",

        "text": "Whoopi is aware of the goofy premise, refusing to take her situation with any seriousness, even though the rest of the cast attempts a level of sincerity.\n\nSeptember 24, 2020\n\nSister Act is outrageous fun and delicious deviltry. The laughs keep coming but, best of all, there's much humanity at work. It's a movie that just, pardon me, makes you feel darn good.\n\nMarch 3, 2022\n\nIt's all pretty predictable, and if there was time you might get pissed off at the ridiculousness of it all. But things move at such a quickened pace, and the comedic timing of all involved is impressive enough to override the structural flaws.\n\nJune 1, 2019\n\nLight and fluffy as it is, \"Sister Act\" still has plenty of laugh-out-loud moments and some warm fuzzies as well as some believable action, and that makes it a 7 out of 10 in my book. But the sequel? It's more like a 5.\n\nJune 22, 2017"
