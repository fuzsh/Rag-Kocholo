        "text": "Ghost star Whoopi Goldberg has opened up about who she would like to see star in Sister Act 3.\n\nBack in 1992, The View host wowed audiences when she starred as Deloris Wilson in the hit musical comedy Sister Act.\n\nThe film follows lounge singer Deloris (Goldberg), who is forced to leave her nightlife career after she witnesses her boyfriend, Vince LaRocca (Harvey Keitel), kill a police informant. Due to the dangerous circumstances, Delores is placed in witness protection at Saint Katherine’s Convent, and of course, hilarious chaos ensues.\n\nDue to Sister Act’s critical and box office success, the film spawned a sequel in 1993 and a musical adaptation in 2006.\n\nOver the last few years, fans have been clamouring for a third Sister Act film to make it’s way to the pop culture sphere.\n\nIn 2020, Deadline reported that Sister Act 3 was officially greenlit at Disney+, with Goldberg back to reprise her role as Deloris and Tyler Perry set to produce.\n\nSince that fateful day, details surrounding the film have been kept under wraps, but that hasn’t stopped Goldberg from revealing her potential casting picks.\n\n“I’m going to ask for Keke [Palmer] to come in. I want everybody to come in. I want Lizzo to come in. I want everybody,” she said in a recent interview with Charlemagne the God.\n\n“I want the girl with the chest, what’s her name?… Nicki [Minaj] I want Nicki to come. I want everybody. I want as many people who want to have some fun because I really, desperately need to have some fun.”\n\nGoldberg’s recent comments come a few months after Perry shared an update on the film during his September appearance on The View.\n\n“I loved the idea of us making this happen, but the Hollywood system moves a little slower than I’d like to. We’ve got a good script, we’re off to a great start, we’re just trying to get everybody moving in the right direction to get it going,” the Madea Family Reunion star explained.\n\nGoldberg echoed similar sentiments during Perry’s interview, stating: “They were sort of lukewarm for the longest time, they said nobody wanted to see it, and then Tyler went in and said, ‘I want to see it,’ The next thing I knew we were on! That’s the power of TV.”\n\nHere’s to hoping Palmer, Lizzo and Minaj will be game to star in Sister Act 3"
