        "text": "Earlier this year, Sheryl Lee Ralph appeared on The View and was informed by Whoopi Goldberg that the producers of the daytime talk show were setting up an official reunion for the cast of Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit for the film’s 30th anniversary.\n\nOn Wednesday (June 5), The View brought together the adults and children who make the film the classic it is today. Alongside Ralph and Goldberg, Monica Calhoun, Ryan Toby, Tanya Trotter, Kathy Najimy, Wendy Makkena, Goldberg’s daughter Alex Martin, and more reunited to discuss the movie’s personal impact and perform “Oh Happy Day” and “Joyful, Joyful.”\n\nTrotter, who is now one half of the country-gospel duo with her husband, sang the solo from the latter. Lauryn Hill was not present for the reunion.\n\nWhen discussing the importance of the film over the past three decades, Goldberg believes the film resonates because “everybody recognizes themselves,” adding, “Worldwide, it doesn’t matter how old you are, you are the age of those kids when you see the movie. You’re the age of them and you remember your time and you remember how happy you were that you didn’t have to go to Catholic school. But then you remember how sorry you are that you didn’t get to go to Catholic school and then, you missed out on teachers like this. So I think people just feel themselves here.”\n\nRalph, who played Hill’s mother in the film, erupted in a fit of laughter after seeing how one of her infamous scenes—where she says, “Singing does not put food on the table. Singing does not pay the bills”— has turned into a modern meme.\n\n“I had no idea that scene was going to land that way. In my mind, I was channeling my Jamaican mother when I told her I was gonna be an actress,” said the Abbott Elementary star, who mimicked her mother’s reaction to such news and how she may have responded today amid her success. She also spoke on reuniting with Hill some years ago, being proud the woman she’s become, and joked about how Hill proved her wrong when it came to The Fugees.\n\nCast members Jenifer Lewis, Erica Campbell, Jennifer Love Hewitt, and Alanna Ubach submitted home videos since they were unable to participate in-person. Lewis shared a hilarious tidbit from the Sister Act 2 opening number. Campbell described the film as a “sweet memory in my life.” Hewitt shared how working on the film was “one of the greatest things that ever happened to me” and expressed interest in being in Sister Act 3.\n\nMeanwhile, Trotter revealed how Sister Act 2 “changed the trajectory of my life” because Goldberg and director Bill Duke wrote in the scene where she and Hill sang “His Eye Is On The Sparrow.”\n\nDisney confirmed in December 2020 that Sister Act 3 is in development with Goldberg set to reprise her role. Tyler Perry has been tapped to produce. In 2022, she expressed interest in having Keke Palmer and Jenifer Lewis in the cast.\n\nWatch extended clips from the Sister Act 2 reunion below."
