        "text": "Harvey Keitel, Dermot Mulroney, Richard Brake and Jackson Rathbone are set to star in director Phil Blattenberger’s crime thriller Laws of Man, which will be shopped to buyers at the Cannes Film Festival.\n\nKeitel will play a mysterious hippie preacher in the film about two U.S. marshals on a dangerous mission to arrest Benjamin Bonney, an outlaw wanted for murder, only to see a desert ambush thwart their plans. As the marshals navigate assassination attempts and looming catastrophe, they stumble onto a sinister plot that threatens the very foundations of peace and justice.\n\nThe film, earlier known as Without Consequence, is from Film Mode Entertainment, which handles worldwide sales, and Lost Galleon Films. The ensemble cast includes Jackson Rathbone, Graham Greene, Keith Carradine, Kelly Lynn Reiter and James Urbaniak.\n\nDirector Blattenberger, who also wrote the script for Laws of Man, will produce along with Dan Black and Jacob Keohane. “Laws of Man encapsulates everything we love about thrillers — good guys, bad guys, gunfights, burgeoning love,” Blattenberger said in a statement.\n\nAs a writer, director and producer, Blattenberger is best known for Condor’s Nest and Point Man. Keitel’s movie credits include Martin Scorsese’s Mean Streets and Taxi Driver and Quentin Tarantino’s Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction.\n\nRathbone had a breakout role as Jasper Hale in The Twilight Saga film series, while Mulroney most recently appeared in Anyone But You, opposite Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell. Brake played the Night King in Game of Thrones and is known as one of horror creator Rob Zombie’s main actors.\n\nKeitel is repped by Untitled Entertainment, Mulroney is repped by Paradigm, and Brake is repped by Markham Froggat & Irwin. Keohane is repped by Artists Resource, Rathbone and Carradine are repped by Innovate Artists, Greene is repped by Greene Talent, and Urbaniak is repped by Buchwald."
