He first emerged, a fully formed talent out of the legendary Actor's Studio, as the central and most compassionate figure in Martin Scorsese's semi-autobiographical early films. In spite of Keitel's later, frequent divergence from those early roles, his performances for Scorsese—especially as the anguished Charlie in Mean Streets , torn between the Catholic Church and the Mob—have continued to shadow his ongoing identification with gritty, streetwise urban characters whose greatest conflicts are nevertheless internal or even metaphysical. (It thus seemed impossible to imagine Scorsese casting any other actor, even Robert DeNiro, as Judas in his controversial Last Temptation of Christ. ) Although Keitel can be explosive on screen, his skills as an actor are most powerfully conveyed through small expressive gestures, often the result of his early training in improvisational techniques—reportedly his character's quiet, intimate dance with Jodie Foster in Taxi Driver was Keitel's idea, and it's the single scene in the film that clarifies the young prostitute's otherwise inexplicable devotion to her pimp.\n\nIn the two decades following his indelible early performances, Keitel worked constantly in interesting but often little-seen films, increasingly in Europe (especially Italy, perhaps since his association with Scorsese perpetuated the illusion that Keitel, a Jew of Polish-Romanian descent, was himself Italian-American). Along with a number of impressive performances—with his French officer in The Duellists and auto worker in Blue Collar standouts—a retrospective glance at Keitel's credits demonstrates his prescient knack for attaching himself to first-time directors who would soon thereafter become prominent filmmakers: after Scorsese, Keitel appeared in the debut feature films of Ridley Scott ( The Duellists ), Alan Rudolph ( Welcome to L.A. ), Paul Schrader ( Blue Collar ), and Quentin Tarantino ( Reservoir Dogs , which Keitel co-produced); he has also worked with such independently-minded and funded figures as Robert Altman, Ettore Scola, Bertrand Tavernier, James Toback (in three films), Nicolas Roeg, Tony Richardson, Dario Argento, Lina Wertmüller, Abel Ferrara (twice), Jane Campion (twice), Spike Lee, and Wayne Wang (in a pair of films shot simultaneously from Paul Auster scripts). In his diverse work for such a range of distinctive filmmakers, Keitel seemed to risk the pursuit of a career that was more personally rewarding than aimed at pleasing a large audience.\n\nAfter working steadily in rarely successful films, the early 1990s signaled a renaissance for Keitel, who continued to appear in diverse roles but finally again in popular and widely discussed films; he plays the sympathetic cops in Mortal Thoughts , Thelma and Louise , and Clockers (a delicate performance in Spike Lee's most focused narrative), and their nightmarish double as the (frequently naked, even crucified) Bad Lieutenant ; that the same actor could appear almost simultaneously in the light comedy Sister Act , the ultraviolent neonoir Reservior Dogs , and the art-house hit The Piano (as a half-primitive Maori) demonstrated the astonishing range of his skills to a wider audience. Although Keitel's willingness, in his early fifties, to appear nude in both Bad Lieutenant and The Piano was taken as evidence of his risk-taking as an actor, his real risks in those complex roles are far more substantial than just dropping his pants.\n\nMost recently, Keitel has reunited with director Campion as a seductive and then seduced cult deprogrammer for Holy Smoke! and paid tribute to his own military career in the patriotic submarine film U-571 , again demonstrating his graceful movement between offbeat and more conventional roles. Keitel's introductory line in Tarantino's Pulp Fiction —\"I'm Winston Wolf, I solve problems\"—may be a subtle comment on the actor's own assurance at this point in his career: his presence, in both commercial entertainments and more challenging works, now virtually guarantees at least one riveting and thoroughly committed performance in those films."
