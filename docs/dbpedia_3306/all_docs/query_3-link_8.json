        "text": "Bad Lieutenant\n\nHarvey Keitel plays an unnamed New York City lieutenant who's a lot worse than the criminals who infest his streets. A womanizer, drug abuser, alcoholic, and gambler, the bad (and unnamed) lieutenant epitomizes corruption and decadence. When his ...\n\nBe Cool\n\nBe Cool, the belated sequel to 1995's Get Shorty, has moments when we think it's going to work. It occasionally tantalizes with witty dialogue and sharp supporting performances. Alas, those are only teases - the film is priming us for something t...\n\nFrom Dusk Till Dawn\n\nIt's great fun, but certainly not great art. From Dusk Till Dawn, a special effects blood-and-gore extravaganza from director Robert Rodriguez, follows in the footsteps of such cult classics as Sam Raimi's Evil Dead series, thumbing its nose at con...\n\nGrey Zone, The\n\nAuschwitz, 1944. One of the darkest times in one of the darkest places in recent human history. The images are stark and unforgettable: furnaces belching black smoke, lifeless corpses piled atop one another like firewood, and gray ash - the inci...\n\nIrishman, The\n\nWith the freedom offered to him by Netflix, Martin Scorsese has crafted a narratively complex, visually arresting account of mob hitman Frank Sheeran (Robert De Niro) and, in the process, reunited with some old friends and brought new ones to ...\n\nMadame\n\nAh, the dinner party â€“ that wonderful stand-by for so many European films.

His latest, Moonrise Kingdom, represents one of his best, in la...\n\nNational Treasure\n\nI'm as willing as any movie-lover to accept a certain amount of ridiculousness in a movie if it serves the greater purpose of entertainment. And, when it comes to action movies, I like to think that my level of tolerance is pretty high. Hey, I en...\n\nNational Treasure: Book of Secrets\n\nHow to review a movie that's essentially a copy of its predecessor? The temptation is to simply copy what I wrote about the first National Treasure into this space with a few minor edits to account for name and location changes. Everything from t...\n\nPiano, The\n\nThe Piano is about passion, the most basic and primal element of human nature.
