His troubles come to a head when a mob lackey delivers an ultimatum: pay off his debt, or else. His fate appears sealed. But when The Lieutenant learns that a $50,000 reward is being offered to whoever catches a pair of thugs who raped a nun (Frankie Thorn), he jumps at the opportunity, hoping that he can still redeem himself.\n\n2\n\nRobert De Niro, Harvey Keitel, Richard Romanus\n\nReleased : 1973\n\nDirected by : Martin Scorsese\n\nA slice of street life in Little Italy among lower echelon Mafiosos, unbalanced punks, and petty criminals. A small-time hood gets in over his head with a vicious loan shark. In an attempt to free himself from the dangers of his debt, he gets help from a friend who is also involved in criminal activities.\n\nHarvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen\n\nReleased : 1992\n\nDirected by : Quentin Tarantino\n\nIn the gritty world of Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs, a group of seasoned criminals, including Mr. White (Harvey Keitel) and Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi), find themselves embroiled in a high-stakes diamond heist gone awry. Directed with Tarantino's signature blend of dark humor and visceral violence, the movie unfolds primarily in a warehouse, where the men grapple with trust issues and the looming threat of police capture. The film weaves a complex narrative web through flashbacks, revealing more about each character's backstory while keeping audiences on edge. A critical success, it helped establish Tarantino as a force to be reckoned with in cinema.\n\nJohn Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman\n\nReleased : 1994\n\nDirected by : Quentin Tarantino\n\nPulp Fiction, a quintessential Quentin Tarantino piece, is a genre-defying blend of crime, drama, and black comedy. The film intricately weaves the lives of two hitmen - Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson), with a washed-up boxer Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis), and a mob boss's wife Mia Wallace (Uma Thurman). Punctuated by Tarantino's signature non-linear storytelling, the movie explores themes of redemption and consequences. It bagged the prestigious Palme d'Or at Cannes in 1994, testifying to its cinematic brilliance.\n\nRobert De Niro, Jodie Foster, Cybill Shepherd\n\nReleased : 1976\n\nDirected by : Martin Scorsese\n\nSuffering from insomnia, disturbed loner Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro) takes a job as a New York City cabbie, haunting the streets nightly, growing increasingly detached from reality as he dreams of cleaning up the filthy city. When Travis meets pretty campaign worker Betsy (Cybill Shepherd), he becomes obsessed with the idea of saving the world, first plotting to assassinate a presidential candidate, then directing his attentions toward rescuing 12-year-old prostitute Iris (Jodie Foster).\n\n6\n\nHolly Hunter, Harvey Keitel, Sam Neill\n\nReleased : 1993\n\nDirected by : Jane Campion\n\nAfter a long voyage from Scotland, pianist Ada McGrath (Holly Hunter) and her young daughter, Flora (Anna Paquin), are left with all their belongings, including a piano, on a New Zealand beach. Ada, who has been mute since childhood, has been sold into marriage to a local man named Alisdair Stewart (Sam Neill). Making little attempt to warm up to Alisdair, Ada soon becomes intrigued by his Maori-friendly acquaintance, George Baines (Harvey Keitel), leading to tense, life-altering conflicts."
