        "text": "It appears now to have been both a help and a hindrance to Harvey Keitel that he should first have been widely seen, finger poised over the flame of hellfire, as Charlie in Martin Scorsese's infernally charged rock opera, Mean Streets.\n\nDavid Thompson: What inspired you to become an actor?\n\nHow significant were the three years you spent in the Marines?\n\nHow did this experience translate itself into your work at the Actors Studio?\n\nSo it’s more than the fear of standing up in front of people?\n\nHow has that affected the many roles you’ve played?\n\nYour first film, Who’s That Knocking at My Door?, was a long time in the making, as it grew from a student film into a feature…\n\n…which must have been a strange initiation?\n\nIn that film and in Mean Streets, was it a special problem for you to be playing the part of an Italian American, given your own background?\n\nI understand Scorsese had to fight to have you play the role of a redneck cowboy in Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore.\n\nDo you regret not doing more stage work?\n\nI believe you played a large part in developing the role of the pimp in Taxi Driver.\n\nJames Toback’s Fingers was the first film in which you were at the centre. How much did you contribute to that character?\n\nThe character in Fingers is an extraordinary romantic, isn’t he?\n\nYou’ve demonstrated numerous times that you ‘re willing and eager to work with first-time directors.\n\nHow was working with Ridley Scott different from American directors?\n\nYou made a lot of films outside Hollywood in the 80s. Why was that?\n\nDeathwatch was made in English. But what about films like That Night in Varennes, where all the cast were different nationalities?\n\nThough you say you’re not “bankable”, you have nevertheless been able to use your name to help get films made.\n\nHow did you become producer on Reservoir Dogs?\n\nWatching your performance in Reservoir Dogs, I was very struck by your business with the lighter, clicking your fingers in that obsessive way…\n\nI wondered how important that gesture was to you in forming the character, and how it came about?\n\nWas the relationship that evolves between your character, Mr White, and that of Tim Roth, Mr Orange, in the original script?\n\nYou often seem to be playing parts on one side or other of the law. When you’ve played cops, I believe you’ve done a great deal of research into their work.\n\nDid they know the film was about a cop steeped in corruption with an appalling drug habit?\n\nEven if that means remorselessly showing yourself in character as wrecked by drugs, and possibly alienating the audience?"
