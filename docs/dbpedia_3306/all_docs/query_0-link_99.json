        "text": "This year marks 28 years since the iconic Sister Act was released in cinemas and we don't know about you but it's a film we can watch over an over again.\n\nThe film was so successful that it spawned an equally successful sequel and a musical adaptation to boot.\n\nBut what ever happened to the all-star cast?\n\nWhoopi Goldberg — Deloris\n\nWhoopi Goldberg was already a massive star before being cast as the lead in Sister Act and she is still a prominent Hollywood figure.\n\nAfter she hung up her habit, Whoopi appeared in film and television series such as The Lion King, Star Trek: The Next Generation, Toy Story 3 and Glee.\n\nShe is also one of the regular hosts of The View in the US.\n\nMaggie Smith — Mother Superior\n\nMaggie Smith is still one of the most popular actresses in the business and is a national treasure if you ask us.\n\nThanks to her roles in Downton Abbey and the Harry Potter franchise, she's an actress that is beloved by people in numerous generations.\n\nWithout her Countess Dowager and Professor McGonagall we wouldn't have some of our most loved memes either.\n\nKathy Najimy — Mary Patrick\n\nKathy's role as Sister Mary Patrick was one of her breakout film roles but she quickly became a hot commodity in Hollywood.\n\nThe following year, she appeared in a little Disney movie called Hocus Pocus and her resume is a list of successful films and television series.\n\nThe most notable of which are Numb3rs, Wall·E, King of the Hill, Dumplin' and Veep.\n\nWendy Makkena — Mary Robert\n\nWhile she many not have reached the dizzying heights of fame as her costars, Wendy has still been working away in Hollywood.\n\nShe's appeared in such films and TV series as Judging Amy, Air Bud and NCIS along with a host of guest starring roles in other well-known series.\n\nHer most recent appearance on screen was as Dorothy in A Beautiful Day in the Neighbourhood alongside Oscar winner Tom Hanks.\n\nMary Wickes — Mary Lazarus\n\nBefore donning her habit, Mary had appeared in another religious related series called Father Dowling Investigates.\n\nShe appeared as Aunt March in 1994's Little Women, but unfortunately, she wasn't able to add many more credits to her name after Sister Act one and two as she passed away in October 1995.\n\nShe posthumously appeared in Disney's The Hunchback of Notre Dame as one of the gargoyles Laverne in 1996.\n\nHarvey Keitel — Vince LaRocca\n\nHarvey Keitel's role as Vince might not be one of his most memorable roles as he went on to become a prominent figure in some of Quentin Tarantino's films.\n\nHe played Mr White in Reservoir Dogs and Wolf in Pulp Fiction who he has recently revived for Direct Line's television adverts.\n\nHe also starred in the US version of Life on Mars, The Grand Budapest Hotel and most recently appeared in Martin Scorcese's The Irishman as Angelo Bruno."
