        "text": "Whoopi Goldberg is a real class act.\n\nDuring a special 30th anniversary cast reunion of \"The Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit\" on \"The View,\" actor David Kater recalled how Goldberg, 68, made sure the film's young stars got to celebrate their high school graduations during the movie's production.\n\n\"We couldn't go back because production wouldn't allow it because we were on location,\" Kater, 49, said in a clip from Wednesday's episode shared by People. \"I was super upset, too, 'cause I had written the song for my graduation. ... And this beautiful lady right here just surprised us with the most amazing gift, which was basically corralling everybody and giving us an on-set graduation.\"\n\nThe audience and cast clapped for Goldberg, who brushed off the praise by smiling and shaking her head, but appeared to get emotional.\n\n\"The View\" shared footage of the graduation, in which Kater and co-star Lauryn Hill are seen shaking Goldberg's hand, all in white caps and gowns. They then join fellow cast members on the bleachers of a San Francisco basketball court. The entire group is then seen throwing their caps in the air in celebration.\n\nOther stars, including Sheryl Lee Ralph, Kathy Najimy, Wendy Makkena, Ryan Toby, Monica Calhoun, Tanya Trotter, Dionna Nichelle, Alex Martin, Frank Odell Howard, Jermaine Montell, DeeDee Magno Hall, Ashley Thompson and Deondray Gossfield, as well as Mervyn Warren and Marc Shaiman, who worked on the music for the film, also made an appearance for the reunion.\n\nThe stars even came together for a performance of \"Oh Happy Day,\" with Goldberg in a full nun habit and veil. Goldberg had tears in her eyes as the performance ended, getting emotional as the camera panned to her.\n\nLast month, Goldberg reflected on her time filming the movie series, including the 1992 film and 1993 sequel.\n\nThe EGOT winner said on \"The Kelly Clarkson Show\" in May that she was able to \"mimic\" singers, like her mother, in order to perform.\n\n\"I loved being around people who sang,\" she said. \"So, of course, I've done two or three musicals, had no business doing them, but I liked it.\""
