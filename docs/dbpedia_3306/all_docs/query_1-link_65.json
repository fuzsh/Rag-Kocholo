        "text": "Erik Estrada\n\nKnown for: ChiPs\n\nNet worth: $4 million\n\n“Ponch” was one cool dude. It’s hard to fathom just how suave Officer Frank “Ponch” Poncherello from the TV series CHiPs was without teleporting to the ‘70s dimension. The show featured he and his partner patrolling the highways of Southern California mounted on CHP motorcycles. The next thing you know, People magazine named him one of “The 10 Sexiest Bachelors in the World” by 1979.\n\nThe show hit the airwaves in 1977 and ran for five seasons. In the ’90s he was paid one million pesos on a Mexican daytime soap opera to play “Johnny,” a steamy Tijuana truck driver, despite the fact he could not speak Spanish. It became the hottest telenovela in Latin American history. The man has sex appeal. Now he’s a real cop. It was his boyhood dream to become a police officer, so the CHiPs role was right up his alley. Today he patrols the Internet for crimes affecting children.\n\nJack Nicholson\n\nKnown for: Easy Rider, One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest, and The Shining\n\nNet worth: $400 million\n\nAfter appearing in a string of low budget horror movies, Jack Nicholson stepped into his own with Easy Rider, the revolutionary film which embodied ’60s counter-culture. Establishing his position on the pantheon of cinematic legends, he won his first Oscar for Best Actor in One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest playing the memorable Randle McMurphy in that Oscar-winning Best Picture. He’s known for his many iconic roles in a wide variety of films. From A Few Good Men (“You can’t handle the truth!!”) to As Good As It Gets , his range in character portrayal astounds. Amassing a net worth of $400 million, he’s made bank on many roles, but none match his Batman windfall. As the insta-iconic Joker, Nicholson raked in $60 to $90 million.\n\nSpeculation and anticipation for his return to the big screen have been swirling since his 2013 retirement after 60 years in film. He won three Oscars during his career and holds the record for most Academy Award nominations. Although unconfirmed by Nicholson, one source claims the actor suffers memory issues and is unable to memorize a script. I’m sure he’s a great improviser. In fact, he improvised one of the most iconic lines of any film: “Here’s Johnny” from The Shining. Bring Jack back!\n\nTom Hanks\n\nKnown for: Big and Forrest Gump\n\nNet worth: $350 million\n\nActor and filmmaker Tom Hanks rests high on the pantheon of cinematic gods and goddesses. As a titan of film, he’s starred in more box office smash hits that one can shake a stick at. Where to start? How about Splash . Splashing into his career starring opposite sea-goddess Daryl Hannah, one of the most beautiful models of the day, established Hanks as a Hollywood lead after television show Bosom Buddies popularized his personality. Success followed. Sleepless in Seattle is another enduring hit. Of course, his SNL work and voicing Woody on Toy Story is hilariously memorable. He won Oscars for more serious roles. He won Best Actor for Philadelphia and Forrest Gump .\n\nHanks, as a liberal and a celebrity, has been very active politically. Back when Myspace was a thing, he endorsed Barack Obama as a candidate. He’s for the environment, same-sex marriage, alternative fuels, and electric vehicles.\n\nBo Derek\n\nKnown for: Bolero and Tarzan, the Ape Man\n\nNet worth: $50 million\n\nEighties American beauty Bo Derek epitomized the movie 10 . Besides, 10, Tarzan, the Ape Man was wildly popular. Her husband John Derek directed Tarzan and Ghosts Can’t Do It. But, sadly, he died in 1998, the year Ghosts came out.\n\nGrowing up in Long Beach, California, Bo Derek skipped out on school when she was 16 to chill at the beach. (Totally normal. It’s the Eighties, right?) After learning to surf and catching some rays, she got caught by her mom her for dropping out, and she was sent back. But then she quit school altogether as she got work filming a movie with her to-be husband in Greece.\n\nClint Eastwood\n\nKnown for: The Good the Bad and the Ugly , Dirty Harry and “Go ahead, make my day”\n\nNet worth: $375 million\n\nHollywood staple, Clint Eastwood, whose renowned career spans six decades, turned 89 this year. As an actor-turned-politician, he was mayor of Carmel in California for two years, but he never quit working in the entertainment industry. Throughout his career, he’s been awarded twelve Oscars for Best Actor, Best Director, and Best Picture. He’s directed 30 films. The Unforgiven (1992) was his peak achievement bringing in nine Academy Award nominations and four Oscars. Mystic River and Million Dollar Baby were also Oscar-winning and box-office smash, directorial feats.\n\nAfter starring in TV series Rawhide, Eastwood came to prominence as a vigilante justice enforcer playing roles like Dirty Harry and the good guy with no name in The Good the Bad and the Ugly. He was so badass, President Ronald Reagan quoted his immortal Dirty Harry line, Go ahead, make my day,” at a speech to Congress. When Eastwood tired of playing the good guy vanquishing bad guys, he branched out into comedy and drama. Bridges of Madison County captured his sensitive side. Most of his career effectively defined American masculinity. The man’s a legend.\n\nTom Cruise\n\nKnown for: Risky Business and Top Gun\n\nNet worth: $570 million\n\nAs one of the prettiest faces of the 1980s, Tom Cruise’s career kicked into high gear after filming The Outsiders and Taps . He turned down the lead role in Footloose to be in All the Right Moves and Risky Business . Mr. Cruise was well on his way to becoming the highest-paid actor ever. He was 18 when he moved to N.Y.C. to be a movie star. But first, he wanted to be a priest, having enrolled in a seminary at age 14. Today, as a Scientology spokesman of sorts, it seems he achieved both. And how! Cruise has worked with all the greats in Hollywood. From Stanley Kubrick to Steven Spielberg, and everyone in between, he’s a true Hollywood legend. He’s the only actor to have worked with each of these directing greats: Oliver Stone, Martin Scorsese, Stanley Kubrick, and Steven Spielberg.\n\nHe starred in top-grossing movies throughout the 1980s and ’90s. Films like Rain Man , The Color of Money , Born on the Fourth of July , Top Gun , Mission: Impossible , Jerry Maguire , and Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles were not only top-grossing but some of cinema’s best. Besides the support Cruise gives to Scientology, he’s a generous contributor to many causes. He supports the Barbara Davis Center for Childhood Diabetes, UNICEF, and the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation.\n\nDolly Parton\n\nKnown for: “I Will Always Love You,” “Jolene” and “9 to 5”\n\nNet worth: $500 million\n\nDolly Parton grew up dirt poor on a dilapidated tobacco farm in Tennessee near the Great Smoky Mountains, but she had a dream. Dolly began composing songs as a little girl. She rose to become the Queen of Nashville. Her wide smile, platinum blonde hairdo, and well-endowed features are an enduring symbol of the 1970s. Dolly distinguished Country Music with her presence. Her fabulous talent help popularize the twangy country-western folk music genre. And, on top of it all, with that adorable southern accent, she’s just so lovable. Back at home, the country legend’s theme park, Dollywood, is the most popular tourist attraction in the state.\n\nShe played opposite Burt Reynolds in The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas and starred in another blockbuster hit called 9 to 5. She wrote the film’s catchy theme song and played the lead. She composed the tune, as she sat tapping her nails during the rehearsal of the film. The song won an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Song. Over her career, she has won nine Grammys and two Academy Award nominations. In all, she was nominated for 47 Grammys!\n\nTommy Lee Jones\n\nKnown for: The Fugitive, MIB and Coal Miner’s Daughter\n\nNet worth: $85 million\n\nAt Harvard, where Tommy Lee Jones roomed with Al Gore and graduated cum laude in 1969, he played varsity football, as well. As an all-league offensive guard, he participated in the Harvard vs. Yale game known as “The Tie,” the most famous game in Ivy League history. He also appeared in undergrad theater productions. Students would find him in the sports locker room suiting up in costume for rehearsal! Acting won out. Now we know him as the big screen’s worst tough guy in films like MIB and The Fugitive .\n\nIn between stage productions, Jones starred on daytime soap One Life to Live. It was not exactly his career dream, but the part led him on the path to the podium where he accepted an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor in The Fugitive. It also scored him a sequel. He became one of the best paid and most highly sought-after actors in the industry. Like many Hollywood greats, he’s tried his hand at directing and producing. His theatrical feature film debut, The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada earned him the Best Actor Award at Cannes.\n\nAl Pacino\n\nKnown for: The Godfather and Scarface\n\nNet worth: $165 million\n\nThroughout the Seventies and Eighties, Al Pacino played one badass mother-flipper after another. He got his start with The Godfather . Francis Ford Coppola happened to catch Pacino in The Panic in Needle Park as a heroin addict, and he could not, not-imagine Pacino’s face as mafia boss Michael Corleone. Good call. The performance remains one of cinema’s greatest achievements. He received his first Oscar nomination, of many, in that breakout film. The Godfather franchise would make him a very wealthy film legend. It’s a stark contrast to his harsh beginnings coming of age in the Bronx. A bit of a trouble maker, smoking and drinking at age nine, you can bet he got into his share of street fights. The acting was a strong interest by middle school. He began studying method acting and getting parts, but the struggles continued, scraping together bus fares to get to auditions.\n\nPacino received his first Best Actor Oscar nomination for Serpico, but he didn’t win the Best Actor Award until 1993 for Scent of a Woman playing the part of a blind ex-Army officer. He starred in other notable films including,... .And Justice for All, Dog Day Afternoon and Frankie and Johnny. He’s not done. Look out for these 2019 flicks: Al Pacino and Robert De Niro in Martin Scorsese’s film, The Irishman, and Quentin Tarantino’s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood with Brad Pitt, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Pacino.\n\nJohn Travolta\n\nKnown for: Saturday Night Fever and Grease\n\nNet worth: $170 million\n\n“ Night fever, night fever / We know how to do it ” –Bee Gees. John Travolta certainly did! He was the face and the moves of that groovy ’70s disco tune. Between the Bee Gees and John T., Saturday Night Fever was a monumental hit. Disco-mania peaked with the release of the film, and his role as a working-class disco dancer won him both a Golden Globe and an Academy Award nomination.\n\nIn the meantime, snagging the lead as Dany Zuko when he was just 18, Travolta toured with the 1971Broadway hit musical “Grease.” Several years later Grease, the movie, opened to wild success. Onto Urban Cowboy. A few flops followed. When the year 1980 rolled in, disco music and John Travolta tanked. After starring in Tarantino’s hit flick Pulp Fiction, Travolta’s career bounced high on a rebound with a box office and cult-following success, plus another Oscar nomination came his way. Movies like Get Shorty, Face/Off, Battlefield Earth, and Primary Colors have kept him in Hollywood’s good graces since then.\n\nBarbra Streisand\n\nKnown for: Yentl and “Evergreen”\n\nNet worth: $400 million\n\n“Hello, gorgeous.” Thus spoke Barbara Streisand as she greeted her first Oscar. Decked out in a flowing hippie-style sheer jumpsuit, with pants so flared she tripped on them climbing onto the stage, she received the Best Actress Award for Funny Girl , tying with Katherine Hepburn.

As a rare member of the EGOT artists club, she’s got a Tony too. Along with eight Grammys, her recording career produced 150 million album sales worldwide. She’s more than music. In 1983, Streisand pioneered the role of women in the film industry when she wrote, produced, directed and starred in Yentl . Until then, no other woman had achieved this.\n\nHer beginnings were not as grand. After the sudden death of her father when she was a year old, she and her brother teetered on the brink of poverty growing up in Brooklyn, New York. With her mom unavailable working long hours as a bookkeeper, she struggled through childhood but gradually found value in her voice. Everyone noticed it. Now she gives back.

Teaming up with Scorsese’s screenwriter, Paul Schrader, Keitel starred in his 1977 and 1978 directorial debuts. However, he fell into a slump in the ’80s, playing lackluster roles in Copkiller and in the mafia comedy Wise Guys. In the ’90s, things started picking back up.

To wit, she was nominated for two Academy Awards—Carnal Knowledge and Tommy. During the 1960s, Ann-Margret modeled for Triumph bikes. She loved riding a Triumph in the 1966 movie, The Swinger.

In 1976, the late Louise Fletcher introduced to the world of cinema the most wretched of all iconic screen villains, the evil Nurse Ratched. Lording over the psychiatric ward that held Jack Nicholson’s Randle McMurphy and his band of fellow patients, Nurse Ratched’s epic clashes with the incorrigible patient are indelible.\n\nLouise Fletcher won the Academy Award for Best Actress, and also the BAFTA and the Golden Globe Awards for Best Actress. Her rendition of the heartless Nurse Ratched made her one of three actresses ever to win all three awards. An astounding performance, indeed.

But Basinger wanted more than a modeling career, so the Cover Girl moved to Hollywood.\n\nBreaking into TV, she landed parts on the groovy Charlie’s Angels series. She broke into the film industry with a role as a Bond girl. But it was Tim Burton’s box-office hit Batman that propelled her toward the stardom she sought. Notably, her role as a femme fatale in L.A. Confidential is universally hailed as brilliant. Basinger is a vegetarian and an animal rights activist. She posed for PETA, sans fur, supporting their anti-fur campaign.\n\nPeter Ostrum\n\nKnown for: Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory\n\nNet worth: $1 million\n\nChild actor, Peter Ostrum, took a very different path than some of his American counterparts. As a boy in the 1970s, he won the role of Charlie Bucket in Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory after being selected by talent scouts while performing with children’s theatre in Cleveland, Ohio. He was 12. The movie studio offered Ostrum a three-film movie contract once filming concluded. Ostrum turned it down. He credits the decision to having spared him the tough transition from child actor to adulthood.\n\nMaking the movie on the Munich set in West Germany set was a good experience. During the filming, he developed a close relationship with Gene Wilder (Willy Wonka). Ostrum considered going back to Hollywood for a showbiz career, but he never made the move.

It’s a wonder she was able to achieve such fame. As a child, she was unable to speak until the age of nine because of a stammer and struggled so desperately with dyslexia she was expelled from four different schools. Finally, at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA), she excelled and was nominated for the BAFTA Newcomer Award in 1962 in Term of Trial .\n\nShe won an Oscar nomination for her role in David Lean’s Ryan’s Daughter which was an adapted script from “Madame Bovary” set during the Easter Rebellion of 1916 in Ireland.

As a child, he was in and out of studios and on and off film sets tagging along with his parents and older brother. Bridges had his big break with The Last Picture Show playing Duane Jackson in a coming-of-age role that earned him an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor. It typecast him as a clever slacker with a loose-cannon tendency that would find its climax as “The Dude” in The Big Lebowski , a pop-cult phenomenon.\n\nHe was also nominated for an Oscar in Starman, although his performance in Fearless is considered his best by some.

Acting lessons began at age 10, and he hooked up with the Second City comedy and theatre troupe in the Sixties.\n\nIt happened in 1966 with The Russians Are Coming, The Russians Are Coming.

Straight out of the 1970s New York punk scene, Debbie Harry and all-girl band, the Stilettos, were rocking the stage in a downtown club in 1974 when Chris Stein discovered her. He was captivated. Together they formed Blondie. As lovers, bandmates and wonderful friends, they created a unique style of music that jolted the scene. Selling over 40 million albums, tunes like, “Atomic,” “The Tide is High,” “Heart of Glass” and “Call Me” continue to inspire generation after generation. Her song “Rapture” is considered the first rap song to hit number one on the charts.\n\nDebbie Harry actively promotes supporting women. In 1980, she hosted a tea party inviting all the prominent women musicians of the time. There weren’t many, but Chrissie Hynde and Siouxsie Sioux were there. The girls had a fabulous time. She’s memorialized by Andy Warhol. His acrylic and silkscreen ink portraits of her are considered one of Warhol’s most accomplished celebrity portraits. Today one print is worth over $6 million. When the pop icon sat for Warhol at The Factory she said, “He was the master of understatement.” The two met when they bumped into each other on Broadway and 13th Street.\n\nJudd Nelson\n\nKnown for: The Breakfast Club\n\nNet worth: $8 million\n\nInveterate “Brat Packer” Judd Nelson debuted his bad-boy persona on The Breakfast Club. It came to life in 1985, when “Brat Pack” architect John Hughes’ totally ’80s flick hit the big screen rousing teen infatuation everywhere. The obsession mounted as another Hughes movie called, St. Elmo’s Fire , starring Nelson alongside Rob Lowe, Demi Moore and Andrew McCarthy opened. Sixteen Candles kicked off the frenzy over Hughes’ trademark style a year previous.\n\nJudd Nelson was raised in middle-class, Portland, Maine. He studied philosophy at the university, but after he graduated he took off to New York City for an acting career. Hitting it big was not what he expected. Reflecting back he is famously known to have said, “My Brat Pack buddies and I didn’t exactly handle celebrity very well. Success at an early age is far more difficult to handle than failure.”\n\nRobert Downey Jr.\n\nKnown for: Less Than Zero\n\nNet worth: $300 million\n\nChild actor, Robert Downey, Jr. appeared in his first movie at age 5. On the rise with our pack of 1980s teen icons, he starred in John Hughes’ classic sci-fi comedy Weird Science. Downey peaked in the quintessential Gen X role from Less Than Zero (1987), the Eighties-era opus.\n\nIn Chaplin , a maturing Downey earned an Oscar nomination and won the BAFTA for Best Actor. Drug abuse problems derailed his career to a degree, but his comebacks, most significantly with Marvel, have erased any losses. He’s one of the highest-grossing actors in the world. Robert Downey, Jr., was born in Manhattan to a filmmaker father and an actress mother. Drugs and alcohol were everywhere growing up. His dad let him smoke pot at six. He played in amazing 1990s flicks like Natural Born Killers with Woody Harrelson, and Scent of a Woman with Al Pacino.\n\nRobert Redford\n\nKnown for: Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and The Sundance Film Festival\n\nNet worth: $170 million\n\nAs a kid growing up in the ’70s and ’80s, I distinctly recall a crowd-favorite potluck dessert called, “The Next Best Thing to Robert Redford.” He was more than a household name. He was a household heartthrob.\n\nRobert Redford began acting on Broadway and television, most notably in The Twilight Zone in 1962 and on Broadway in Neil Simon’s Barefoot in the Park . Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid made him a verifiable movie star. He followed it up in 1972 with Jeremiah Jones and in 1973 with two number one box office hits, The Way We Were and The Sting , making him No. 1 at the box office for three consecutive years. Capitalizing on his success, he championed environmental causes and founded the Sundance Institute for aspiring filmmakers.

Women in Cages and The Big Dollhouse featured her lively character roles, making her the first African American to play an action hero. In Coffy , Grier plays a vigilante taking out justice on a coke dealer for addicting her sister. Black Mama, White Mama is another Blaxploitation film of Grier’s. Like a 1970s version of Orange Is the New Black , this movie takes place at a women’s prison on a fictional tropical island. Though Blaxploitation sounds bad, it had elements of black power and women’s power. The film style went out with the 1970s.\n\nMiami Vice was a crazy-popular hit TV series that ran during the heart of the Eighties, from 1985 to 1989. Pam Grier became a regular on the show. It’s difficult to explain its mass appeal like it would be difficult to explain the mass appeal of PewDiePie in 30 years. Miami Vice featured Don Johnson, a hunk of a private detective with slicked-back hair in a slick white-white suit wearing designer shades and a Rolex watch—totally ’80s—and, at his fingertips, an ever-ready, even more slick, gleaming chrome handgun. Also in the 1980s, Grier played the evil Dust Witch in Ray Bradbury’s story, Something Wicked This Way Comes, a 1983 Disney production. In the 1990s, she was Jackie Brown. Quentin Tarantino’s crime-thriller was created as a direct nod to Blaxploitation films. Award nominations and an NAACP Image Award revived her career. Factoid: Pam Grier was the first black woman to appear on the cover of Ms. Magazine, 1975.\n\nDrew Barrymore\n\nKnown for: E.T.\n\nNet worth: $125 million\n\nDrew Barrymore was born into Hollywood stardom. Almost every member of her family has showbiz creds. Her godfather, for example, is none other than Steven Speilberg. He’s also director E.T. , but no one could have predicted the rebellious ’80s teen icon she would become. She was so damn cool that Kurt Cobain and Courtney Love asked her to be the godmother of their baby daughter, Frances Bean Cobain. And she’s still wildly popular, agelessly appealing to each new generation.\n\nDespite being born to Hollywood royalty, no one could have predicted she would star in the highest-grossing film of the 1980s. Fame doesn’t come without its problems. Childhood actors are doubly cursed. For Drew Barrymore, superstardom landed her in drug and alcohol rehab by age 13. She was nine the first time she got drunk, at Rob Lowe’s birthday party, incidentally. Shortly thereafter, she was a regular at the club scene. (The hedonistic Eighties were kind of a crazy decade). She’s lucky she survived to adulthood. The fact that she’s been one of the most prolific and continuously working stars in the business, is another blessing. Drew has a philanthropic heart and has supported a wide variety of charitable organizations. Fighting hunger is one. After being named Ambassador Against Hunger for the U.N. World Food Programme, Barrymore donated $1 million to the cause.\n\nCloris Leachman\n\nKnown for: The Last Picture Show and Young Frankenstein\n\nNet worth: $21 million\n\nThis actress/comedian is best known for her hilarious role as Phyllis Lindstrom on The Mary Tyler Moore show.

In the film, she portrayed Granny in The Beverly Hillbillies (1993). Leachman set a record winning eight Primetime Emmy Awards. She also won a Golden Globe Award for her portrayal of Phyllis. Her performance in The Last Picture Show earned an Oscar. Her last role was performed in the 2018 movie I Can Only Imagine, a Christian-themed movie based on the pop-sensation song of the same title. She was born in Des Moines, Iowa on April 30, 1926. She grew up in Des Moines and lived there until she attended Illinois State to study drama, and then graduated from Northwestern University. She started her film career soon after, but not before participating in Miss America in 1946.\n\nGeneviève Bujold\n\nKnown for: Anne of a Thousand Days\n\nNet worth: $2 million\n\nAt 71 Geneviève Bujold said, “I am incapable of doing things I don’t want to do. I live modestly, so that I’m never forced to do a job to pay a mortgage, and I don’t own anything.” Her point being, “All the external decorations are less important than giving yourself the gift of time.”\n\nCanadian-born Bujold spent her childhood in Montreal’s Hochelaga Convent. It was a stifling experience. She finally got kicked out after getting caught reading an unapproved novel. She became a stage actress and then a French film actress. When she played Anne Boleyn in Anne of the Thousand Days in 1969, her performance was so spectacular she won a Golden Globe for Best Actress and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress. It was her American film debut. She went on to do other American movies like Earthquake, Coma and Dead Ringers.\n\nAnthony Michael Hall\n\nKnown for: Sixteen Candles and The Breakfast Club\n\nNet worth: $8 million\n\n“Brat Pack” go-to geek Anthony Michael Hall starred in most of John Hughes’ blockbusters, beginning with National Lampoon’s Vacation playing one of Chevy Chase’s kids. Hughes kept him in mind for Sixteen Candles , The Breakfast Club and Weird Science . But Hall, who has a slight resemblance to future tech-geek Mark Zuckerberg, turned down roles Hughes wrote for him in Ferris Bueller’s Day Off and Pretty in Pink . (Enough with the typecast!)\n\nOf the “Brat Pack” experience, Hall said, “I had the time of my life.” However, as with many of our iconic child actors from the Eighties, Hall took a two-year break to deal with a drinking problem. He returned to screen with Johnny Depp and Winona Ryder in Edward Scissorhands playing a villain. Six Degrees of Separation was another box office hit. One of Hall’s charitable efforts includes assisting at-risk youth by offering literacy programs. His initiative offers an opportunity to learn literacy in films, music, lyrics, scriptwriting, and novels.\n\nCarol Kane\n\nKnown for: Hester Street and Wicked\n\nNet worth: $5 million\n\nCarol Kane took on theatre as a child growing up in N.Y.C.

Along with the rest of the club, his career was catapulted to new heights. His film debut in Over the Edge , though it was not widely screened, got him known as an edgy, cool dude. The 1979 movie is hip again with a fervent retro cult following.\n\nHe starred in My Bodyguard, Rumble Fish, and The Flamingo Kid. He played the cute lead in a lot of movies. In Gus Van Sant’s crime drama, Drugstore Cowboy, he plays an addict on the search for drugs. One of his most memorable comedy roles is “Pat” in There’s Something About Mary. He’s still acting! In 2018 he starred in The House that Jack Built. He won an Independent Spirit Award and a Golden Globe nomination for Crash. He received a Grammy nomination for Best Spoken Word Album having narrated the inveterate Jack Kerouac’s, On the Road.\n\nCyndi Lauper\n\nKnown for: “Girls Just Wanna Have Fun,” Kinky Boots, and LGBTQ+ Activism\n\nNet worth: $30 million\n\nPop music superstar Cyndi Lauper “be-bopped” herself into a spectacular career. Suffice it to say you cannot find an ‘80s mixtape without at least one track rocking her distinctively pitched voice. “Time After Time,” “Girls Just Wanna Have Fun” and “True Colors” played on heavy rotation throughout the decade. She won Best New Artist at the 1985 Grammy Awards and Best Female Music Video at the 1984 MTV Music Awards (“Girls Just Wanna Have Fun”). As a self-proclaimed misfit—her hair’s different, her voice is different, her sweet and honest nature is a bit of an aberration in the rock world—she somehow fits in.\n\nLauper is a rare talent. She’s one of very few singers who have won an Emmy, a Tony and a Grammy. Her role on the sitcom, Mad About You, earned her an Emmy and her music and lyrics for the Broadway musical, Kinky Boots, won a Tony. Raised in Queens by a single mom, she struggled to make it, at times living on the streets as a young adult. Maybe that is why she is one of the most compassionate people. She wrote the song “True Colors” for her good friend Gregory who died of AIDs. The loss inspired her to dedicate her life to helping the gay and lesbian community. Today she’s a leading advocate for LGBTQ+ people’s rights. Her organization, True Colors United, seeks to end homelessness, emphasizing youth homelessness. She founded it in 2012 after she learned that 40 percent of homeless youth identify as LGBT.\n\nChristopher Walken\n\nKnown for: The Deer Hunter\n\nNet worth: $50 million\n\nChristopher Walken snagged his first showbiz gig as a circus lion tamer when he was 16. Next, he liked to dance, so he trained as a dancer before moving on to stage performance. He broke into showbiz proper as a stage actor in an off-Broadway musical starring alongside Liza Minnelli. The next thing he knew, he was starring opposite Sean Connery in The Anderson Tapes .\n\nWalken played the deranged and homicidal brother of Annie (Diane Keaton) in Woody Allen’s Annie Hall. He would develop a catalog of similar character roles. He won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor playing a psychologically unstable steelworker returning home from Vietnam in The Deer Hunter. Walken starved himself for a week to develop a gaunt appearance for the role. He’s played epic villains, most memorably in Batman Returns and as James Bond’s villain, Max Zorin. However, George Lucas considered casting Walken as good-guy Han Solo and he played Madonna’s guardian angel in her “Bad Girl” music video. He’s also loved for his seven SNL appearances. He’s responsible for delivering the epic, “I gotta have more cowbell” line.\n\nCandy Clark\n\nKnown for: American Graffiti\n\nNet worth: $3 million\n\nAt 18, Candy Clark moved to N.Y.C. to become a fashion model. The sky was the limit. When she landed a starring role in the raucous rock ‘n roll coming-of-age movie American Graffiti (1973) she worked with budding Hollywood legends, George Lucas and Francis Ford Coppola. That year, Screen World declared her one of the most promising movies stars in the industry. She turned out to be more like a one-hit-wonder. Well, two.\n\nIt was an exciting time. By 1975, Clark and Jeff Bridges hooked up and shared a pad for a couple of years. In 1976, she fell in love with director Nicolas Roeg when they were filming his stellar project The Man Who Fell to Earth. Clark starred in the movie and famously played David Bowie’s part the day he was too ill to film.\n\nElliot Gould\n\nKnown for: M*A*S*H*\n\nNet worth: $20 million\n\nBrooklyn native Elliott Gould made his stage debut in 1962 starring in I Can Get it For You Wholesale. It was a significant time in his life as he starred in the Broadway musical with his future wife, Barbara Streisand. The recognition brought starring roles in Drat! The Cat! And Little Murders . By 1969 he formed his own film production company, and, more notably, signed a contract to play Trapper John in Robert Altman’s seminal film M*A*S*H* . It was a smashing hit.\n\nHe flopped with Move, and I Love My Wife, but then rebounded in The Long Goodbye. He played opposite Diane Keaton in both, I Will, I Will…for Now, and Harry and Walter Go to New York. More flops. His portrayal of an aging mobster in Warren Beatty’s Bugsy brought him showers of accolades. In American History X starring Edward Norton, Gould delivered a remarkable appearance. He’s hosted Saturday Night Live a total of six times and guest-starred on Friends. He and Barbara Streisand didn’t stay married. They divorced in 1971. He went on to marry and divorce Jennifer Bogart two times.\n\nMichael Caine\n\nKnown for: Alfie and Dirty Rotten Scoundrels\n\nNet worth: $75 million\n\nBritish film icon Michael Caine was born in South London. As a young lad with a certain idealism about communism, he was sent off to fight during the Korean War. He returned to England loathing the ideology, hating combat, and searching for a new vocation. He decided to try his hand at theatre procuring a job as an assistant stage manager. More than 130 films later, Michael Caine is a master at his craft and holds the rare distinction of earning an Oscar nomination for five consecutive decades. Recognized by his cockney accent, his films have collectively grossed over $7.4 billion worldwide.\n\nCaine received his first Oscar nomination for playing a heartless heartthrob in Alfie. It cemented his Hollywood career, Gambit, Play Dirty and Get Carter followed. In the 1990s, Hannah and Her Sisters snagged him his first Oscar win. He played a respectable Scrooge in The Muppet Christmas Carol, and audiences liked him in the Batman trilogy as Alfred, the fatherly butler. As a rare conservative among the ranks of Hollywood liberals, Caine’s politics include a protest on paying taxes. He once left the U.K. until Margaret Thatcher cut the tax rate for top-earners.\n\nRob Lowe\n\nKnown for: The Outsiders and the “Brat Pack”\n\nNet worth: $60 million\n\nRob Lowe was catapulted to fame as a teen idol in the ’80s with the rest of the “Brat Pack.” The group starred in one insanely popular coming-of-age flick after another, truly defining a generation. Sixteen Candles , St. Elmo’s Fire , and, of course, The Breakfast Club featured these young men and women, most of whom became serious Hollywood legends in their own right. Our heartthrob, Mr. Lowe, ran into a dab of trouble on the way up, but he’s been recovering as an alcoholic for over two decades. Oh, and that sex-tape scandal-thing? Just think of it as a blip on the map that helped him hit his bottom.\n\nHe’s arguably more popular now than ever. His Twitter following is impressive, and fans love him on Parks and Recreation and Grinder. West Wing gave his career the lift it needed after Wayne’s World rescued him from the sex scandal thing. Lowe’s never shied away from politics. In fact, his first sex scandal incident occurred on the night before the 1988 DNC nomination of Michael Dukakis, a man he was endorsing at the convention. Operative word: “was.” Currently, he backs a Homeowners Defense Fund for government transparency in Santa Barbara and is a spokesman for the breast cancer awareness organization, Lee National Awareness Day.\n\nMichael J. Fox\n\nKnown for: Family Ties and Back to the Future\n\nNet worth: $65 million\n\nBefore Michael J. Fox played Marty McFly, he was Alex Keaton on the wildly popular 1980s sitcom Family Ties . The Canadian-born actor played a hilarious young-Republican growing up in a throw-back hippie family. The show ran from 1982 to 1989. Fox won three Primetime Emmys and a Golden Globe for the role. In the midst of it, he starred in one of the most successful movies of all time. Back to the Future was a genre-smashing sci-fi adventure comedy with a franchise that has stretched over three decades producing a Trilogy, an attraction at Universal Studios, and an animated TV series.\n\nHe also won a Primetime Emmy, two SAGs and three Golden Globe Awards for his role on Spin City . During the filming of the 1991 romantic comedy Doc Hollywood , Fox noticed an uncontrollable twitch in his finger. When he went to the doctor, he learned of his Parkinson’s diagnosis. After the sad news, he founded The Michael J. Fox Foundation to help advance research on the debilitating disease.\n\nCicely Tyson\n\nKnown for: Sounder\n\nNet worth: $10 million\n\nDiscovered as a fashion model, Cicely Tyson shot to the top of the modeling profession with her strikingly beautiful and unique look. She found her way to the stage by 1957. Tyson got her foot in the door appearing on television programs like the miniseries movie Roots which was a 1970s national sensation. She was nominated for a Primetime Emmy for her work in Roots. In 1972, Tyson was nominated for an Academy Award and a Golden Globe Award for her role in the critically acclaimed movie Sounder .\n\nShe also appeared in acclaimed films like Fried Green Tomatoes and The Help. Miles Davis fell in love with Cicely Tyson. The world-renowned jazz musician photographed Tyson for his album, Sorcerer. They were married in 1981.\n\nStevie Nicks\n\nKnown for: Fleetwood Mac and “Landslide”\n\nNet worth: $75 million\n\n“At the ripe and totally young age of 70,” as Ms. Nicks puts it, she became the first woman inducted twice into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. This time the rock icon entered the reverent Hall as a soloist. Fleetwood Mac was enshrined in 1998. Between the two, Stevie Nicks and Mac have over 40 chart-topping singles. Stevie Nicks is one of the best-selling musical acts ever. Fleetwood Mac formed in 1967 and dominated the charts throughout the Seventies and Eighties.\n\nShe may be rock and roll royalty, but she looks just like an enchanted fairy goddess on stage. Ahead of long, flowing blonde locks frame her lovely face, waif-like. Donned in beguiling gowns that cascade around her, only the sound of her voice can compare. It’s hauntingly beautiful. Her 1975 “Landslide” song continues to be one of the most popularly covered songs in rock. Stevie wrote the song on the guitar while watching the snow falling in Aspen. It took her about five minutes.\n\nJon Bon Jovi\n\nKnown for: Bon Jovi\n\nNet worth: $410 million\n\nJon Bon Jovi, lead singer of the New Jersey rock band Bon Jovi, is a staple of the 1980s. Without his songs “Bad Medicine,” “Livin’ on a Prayer,” and “You Give Love a Bad Name” wafting through the airwaves, would the Eighties have been the Eighties? Well, let’s not get too philosophical. The band formed in 1983 and became a super-pop-sensation from the hard rock/metal genre. Their third album Slippery When Wet was a worldwide smash hit selling 20 million copies. In all, the band released 14 studio albums and have been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall Of Fame and the U.K. Music Hall of Fame.\n\nJon Bon Jovi branched out into a solo career and in movies and television shows. He made appearances in Sex and the City and The West Wing. Bon Jovi is also recognized for his charitable endeavors. With too many causes to list, he formed his own foundation, The Jon Bon Jovi Soul Foundation, and helps out with Habitat for Humanity, the Special Olympics, the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation, and has raised money for Oprah’s charity.\n\nLiza Minnelli\n\nKnown for: Cabaret\n\nNet worth: $50 million\n\nBorn in Hollywood to Judy Garland and director Vincente Minnelli, Liza Minnelli befell a charmed life. She was fourteen months old when she debuted in the film on In the Good Old Summertime (1949). At sixteen, when she was trying to make it on her own in N.Y.C., she received some recognition for the play “Best Foot Forward.” But it was when her mother invited her to sing with her at a show at the London Palladium when serious recognition bumped her career. Shows sold out, audiences adored the mother/daughter duo, and it was announced to the world that Liza was coming-of-age with her own talents.\n\nAt nineteen, Liza won a Tony, and at 23 she was nominated for an Academy Award playing Pookie Adams in The Sterile Cuckoo. Her greatest performance was saved for Cabaret. Liza won an Oscar, a BAFTA, and a Golden Globe for her performance as Sally Bowles. The Seventies were very busy for the pop star. Her stage duets with Frank Sinatra were well-loved. But it was in Scorsese’s, New York, New York where she so memorably shined with her signature song.\n\nElton John\n\nKnown for: “Rocket Man” Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, “Tiny Dancer,” “Candle in the WInd” and Lion King\n\nNet worth: $500 million\n\nThe Seventies and Eighties unofficial mascot, Elton John, defined the era with his songs, by the clothes he wore and with his flamboyant array of eyeglasses. At age four he picked up piano. By the 1970s the pop music icon released seven consecutive No. 1 albums in the United States. It’s practically unprecedented. Sir Elton John and songwriter Bernie Taupin met through a weekly newspaper ad. They were 20 and 17 when they met, respectively, and their union of piano and lyric created almost 400 songs in the decades since. Before the serendipitously epic collaboration, John played in a band called Bluesology.\n\nHe’s won every major award: A Grammy, a Tony, an Academy and a Golden Globe. His song “Circle of Life” in The Lion King film won him an Academy Award for Best Original Song. The soundtrack included other sensational hits like “Hakuna Matata” and “Can You Feel the Love Tonight,” making him a smash hit of the 1990s as well. He produced Gnomeo & Juliet, the precious animated kids' film featuring his tunes. Of all the iconic media the 1980s produced, one element of the decade stands out in a terrible contrast, the AIDS epidemic. People were dying, mysteriously at first. When the epidemic came into its full, terrifying light, the research was shocking. Having unprotected sex and other fluid transfer causes it, and there is no cure. The diagnosis was a death sentence. Elton John says he risked having unprotected sex in the ’80s and realizes now he is lucky to be alive. With friends dying around him, he lived to support the cause of AIDS eradication. After his friend Freddie Mercury died in 1991, John founded the Elton John AIDS Foundation.\n\nSally Kellerman\n\nKnown for: M*A*S*H*. and Major “Hot Lips”\n\nNet worth: $2 million\n\nM*A*S*H is an Indispensable 1970s television series. But without the award-winning1970 film about the medical personnel who manned the 4077th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital in the Korean War, there may never have been that decade-long bestowal to television.\n\nSally Kellerman dazzled audiences as Margaret “Hot Lips” Houlihan, a severe Korean War nurse in M*A*S*H*. Her performance as head nurse of the 4077th earned an Academy Award nomination and a Golden Globe nomination for Best Supporting Actress. In other awards, she won the Golden Laurel for Best Comedy Performance. The film jump-started her career, although she turned down a bulk of the roles in order to focus on her singing career. She signed a contract with Verve Records and dated Grand Funk Railroad rocker Mark Farner, but we remember her best in movies like Welcome to L.A., The Player, Prêt-à-Porter and in her Twilight Zone roles.\n\nAnthony Hopkins\n\nKnown for: The Silence of the Lambs\n\nNet worth: $160 million\n\nSir Anthony Hopkins, knighted in 1993 by the late Queen Elizabeth, yet terrifies us by his horrifying portrayal of Dr. Hannibal Lecter. Decades on, a mere thought of the psychological mastermind sends shudders of fright down one’s spine. Hopkins’ depiction of that mad serial slayer (or is it “splayer”?) is an immortal fixture in the halls of American cinema, never mind that it was brought to us by a man from Wales. His accent only made him sound more terrifying. Suffice it to say he won the Academy Award for Best Actor.\n\nHopkins’ acting career began many years before he starred with Jodie Foster in that iconic 1991 horror film. He studied stage acting under the renowned Sir Laurence Oliver until he transitioned to television in 1967. He played an impressive Richard I in a 1968 movie called The Lion in Winter. It was nominated for Best Picture and starred Katherine Hepburn as well. It got him noticed. He starred in The Remains of the Day, The Elephant Man and The Hunchback of Notre Dame.\n\nKevin Bacon\n\nKnown for: Footloose\n\nNet worth: $30 million\n\nKevin Bacon was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. When he was a kid, he wanted to be a pop star. At age 17 he left home for the Big Apple looking to make it there (because if you make it there, you can make it anywhere). As a high school student, he developed a passion for the arts and wanted to become a serious actor. In N.Y.C. he found some theatre gigs and a big role in the slasher horror flick Friday the 13th . Things were picking up. He debuted on Broadway with Sean Penn and Val Kilmer. He played “Chip” in the classic frat house comedy, National Lampoon’s Animal House . Soon, he landed the monster smash hit, Footloose and became a pop star.\n\nHe’s starred in JFK, A Few Good Men, Apollo 13, and Mystic River, to name a few blockbusters. He won a Golden Globe Award and a SAG for Taking Chance, an HBO original movie. In 2007 he founded a charitable organization called SIxDegrees.org, based on the trivia game and subsequent meme, Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon.\n\nJohn Kapelos\n\nKnown for: The Breakfast Club\n\nNet worth: $1.1 million\n\nJohn Kapelos played Carl, the shady but comical school janitor in The Breakfast Club . It’s not the only John Hughes movie we remember him from. He also appeared in Sixteen Candles and Weird Science .\n\nThe 1980s character-actor appeared in 1990s movies as well. One of his best was The Deep End of the Ocean (1999) which received acclaim from Roger Ebert and The New York Times. He starred in Roxanne with Daryl Hannah and Steve Martin and Nothing in Common with Tom Hanks. In television, he’s appeared on Miami Vice, Queer as Folk, Desperate Housewives and The X-Files. Currently, he teaches acting and improv classes at the AIA Studios. He also manages his independent record label, Carpuzi Records.\n\nJean Simmons\n\nKnown for: The Happy Ending\n\nNet worth: $12 million\n\nBritish film star, Jean Simmons, found fame in 1946 starring in a film version of Great Expectations . Her role as young Estella invited rave reviews. It opened doors. After several roles in decent movies, she hit the big one—playing Ophelia in Laurence Olivier’s Hamlet . It earned her an Oscar nomination.\n\nVoted fourth-most popular star in Britain, she became a 1950s Golden Age Hollywood star with King Solomon’s Mines. It scored her an MGM contract. Relocating to L.A., she hooked up with Howard Hughes who acquired her contract. Androcles and the Lion was her first Hollywood production. Hughes could have treated Simmons better. She extricated herself from his contract after a court case. With 20th Century Fox she found leads in box-office hits The Robe and Désirée. She starred with Marlon Brando as Napoleon Bonaparte. Simmons received her second Oscar nomination for The Happy Ending (1969). She’s remembered in Guys and Dolls and Spartacus. The actress struggled with addiction and spoke out publicly to support others. She became a patron of the British drugs and human rights charity. Just days before her 81st birthday in January 2010, Simmons died from lung cancer.\n\nMorgan Freeman\n\nKnown for: Driving Miss Daisy and Shawshank Redemption\n\nNet worth: $200 million\n\nSeated high on the pantheon of Hollywood greats is the revered Morgan Freeman. Immortalized as a film legend in Driving Miss Daisy , his heartwarming performance as Miss Daisy’s gentle chauffeur earned him an Academy Award nomination.\n\nFreeman’s dream was to be an actor. He moved to N.Y.C. to follow it. Working odd jobs and doing some dancing and musical theatre, he gradually made it in showbiz. It took decades of dreaming before he hit it big in 1987 with Street Smart. The acclaim for his role Fast Black was phenomenal, and he considers it his breakthrough part. Some of Freeman’s charity work is dedicated to disaster aid, especially in Grenada after the 2004 hurricane. He’s concerned about environmental issues and raises awareness. One issue is the declining bee problem. Beekeeping is a way he helps give back to help solve the problem.\n\nLynda Carter\n\nKnown for: Wonder Woman\n\nNet worth: $10 million\n\nThe Seventies would not have been the Seventies without Wonder Woman. Lynda Carter brought the D.C. Comic title to life playing the first-ever female superhero on TV. Her original performance of the character captivated audiences for three glorious seasons. Advancement for women? Yes! As a mythical enforcer of justice, Wonder Woman was not only beautiful but important too. Secretly known as Diana Prince, Wonder Woman was the embodiment of goodness as well.\n\nLife before Wonder Woman found Lynda Carter struggling to make it in showbiz. Winning Miss World USA helped. Music was her first interest. She toured with a band playing quite a few gigs until she became disenchanted with the idea. She won beauty contests instead. Today she has a multi-million-dollar net worth. Then, however, she had only $25 left in her bank account when she got the call that landed the Wonder Woman role. Carter is a spokesman for irritable bowel syndrome due to her mom’s affliction, a staunch advocate for Susan G. Komen for the Cure, a Pro-Choice rights activist for women, a backer for legal equality for LGBT people, and she advocates for alcoholism recovery. She has been sober for 20 years.\n\nAnjelica Huston\n\nKnown for: Prizzi’s Honor and Witches\n\nNet worth: $50 million\n\nAs a deity of the Hollywood pantheon, Anjelica Huston was born and raised into stardom, Santa Monica, California, to be specific, the heart of it all. She is the daughter of ballerina Enrica Soma and actor John Huston. Her career would find her in a long-term relationship with the singular Jack Nicholson and married to renowned sculptor Robert Graham until he died in 2008. But it’s her distinctively striking beauty—severe and self-confident—with raven-black hair that sets her apart.\n\nWinning the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for Prizzi’s Honor (1985) made her a third-generation Oscar-winner in the Huston family. The film was directed by her father and starred Jack Nicholson. She received BAFTA nominations for Crimes and Misdemeanors and Manhattan Murder Mystery, both Woody Allen films. And in Witches, portraying the Grand High Witch from Roald Dahl’s well-loved children’s book, earned her another round of acclaim. She was also loved in The Addams Family as Monica Addams.\n\nKurt Russell\n\nKnown for: Silkwood\n\nNet worth: $70 million\n\nConstant lover and forever companion to knock-out Goldie Hawn, Kurt Russell is a strapping gent who once had a shot at a professional baseball career. Sidelined by a torn rotator cuff, his showbiz career went front and center. Russell was busy as a youngster. He’s one of those rare childhood stars who survive in the industry to enjoy a lucrative film career. He landed one of his first roles in the Elvis Presley movie, It Happened at the World’s Fair (1963) when he was eleven. In 1966, he starred in a Disney TV show. He met his future love, 21-year-old Goldie, on another film set, but at 16, he was a little young. It should be no surprise that he was voted “Best Looking” by the Class of 1969 at Thousand Oaks High School.\n\nHe found his way into several box office hits. In the Seventies and Eighties, Russell starred in amazing hits like Silkwood and Overboard . He played Lt. Bull McCaffrey in the hugely popular firefighter movie, Backdraft . Wyatt Earp, in Tombstone , was also a very popular role. And he’s well-loved in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.2 and the Stargate franchise. Goldie and Kurt share a double star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The honor was celebrated at the May 2017 ceremony.\n\nHarrison Ford\n\nKnown for: Star Wars and Indiana Jones\n\nNet worth: $230 million\n\nStar Wars . Raiders of the Lost Ark . Two of the best movies of the Seventies and Eighties. Respectively. The mass appeal of those two mega-franchises made Harrison Ford one of the most in-demand actors ever (practically inventing the concept of a movie franchise, alongside George Lucas, in the process). Five of his flicks are all-time box office top-grossing films. The man’s a legend. Every dude wanted to be cool like him. Every gal swooned in the presence of the silver screen king. A collective sigh released when Princess Leia finally broke the romantic tension by kissing him in The Empire Strikes Back .\n\nAll this has led to substantial net worth. However, Ford had all but quit acting to support his wife and kids by becoming a carpenter when he got set up with George Lucas. It started with American Graffiti and climaxed with the mega-franchises Star Wars and Indiana Jones. It was like a godsend collaborating with Lucas. When he landed Han Solo on Star Wars, who knew he’d become an American demigod? The friendship of Hans and Chewbacca remains one of the most indelible memories of any summer movie release.\n\nJami Gertz\n\nKnown for: The Lost Boys\n\nNet worth: $2 billion\n\nJami Gertz was discovered as a child actor who landed roles on epic 1970s sitcoms like Diff’rent Strokes and The Facts of Life . After studying drama at NYU, she began picking up significant parts in substantial films like Less Than Zero and The Lost Boys . Another blockbuster she starred in was Twister . She landed Crossroads and Jersey Girl also.\n\nGertz played that girl who wouldn’t share even “one square” of toilet paper with Elaine on Seinfeld. She could have played that girl Rachel Green on Friends but passed up the part. She did play Judy Miller on TV sitcom Still Standing. In 1989, Jami Gertz married executive Antony Ressler. Her billionaire hubby is a co-founder of a multi-billion-dollar private equity firm. The couple part-owns the MLB Milwaukee Brewers team. It’s not all fun and games. In 2012, Gertz and Ressler have named the #1 Most Generous Celebrities in the world, and in 2010, they were the top-donor of any celebrity couple.\n\nLinda Blair\n\nKnown for: The Exorcist\n\nNet worth: $16 million\n\nLinda Blair starred in The Exorcist , one of the all-time scariest movies. Playing a possessed demon child, the success of the classic 1973 horror film catapulted the child model and actress to international fame. She was just 14 years old when she won a Golden Globe Award and an Oscar nomination for the performance. She also won several roles and starred in Born Innocent and Airport 1975 . In Born Innocent , she played a sexually abused runaway teenager. The National Organization for Women and other organizations protested it for its depiction of female-to-female sexual abuse.\n\nFame wasn’t easy for Blair. A drug bust at 18 found her blacklisted in Hollywood. She managed it with B-movies. The experience produced lead roles in two cult classics. Chained Heat is a 1983 women-in-prison flick, and Savage Streets is an action movie in which she portrayed a vigilante femme fatale. In 2006, she showed up on the CW hit series Supernatural. She also hosted the 2000 Fox TV series, The Scariest Places on Earth.\n\nRobert Duvall\n\nKnown for: The Godfather , The Apostle and Lt. Col. Kilgore\n\nNet worth: $70 million\n\nAnother iconic film legend is Robert Duvall. He delivered one of the most definitive lines of the Vietnam era. The mythic phrase was victoriously belted out by the ruthless Lt. Col. Kilgore in Apocalypse Now (1979): “I love the smell of Napalm in the morning!” The war may have ended in 1975, but Duvall’s line lives on. The ’70s were prolific for Duvall, primarily in the production of malicious characters we love to hate. In The Godfather and The Godfather Part II, the phenomenal character-actor played the attorney for the Corleone mafia family. That role in Francis Ford Coppola’s classic mob film earned him an Academy Award nomination.\n\nIn MASH he played the vicious Major Frank Burns, and on Network he played the repugnant television executive Frank Hackett. He even played the contemptible Josef Stalin in Stalin. It’s his comedic nuances, the way he inserts a bit of humor into the bad guys that make his portrayals so epic. Are we surprised he was considered for Dr. Hannibal Lecter? Out of seven Oscar nominations, he was awarded an Oscar for Best Actor in Tender Mercies. Duvall’s big breaks included appearing on The Twilight zone and making his screen debut in To Kill a Mockingbird. His career has spanned six decades. And at 84, he became the oldest actor ever to receive an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor.\n\nJeannie Berlin\n\nKnown for: The Heartbreak Kid\n\nNet worth: $2 million\n\nJeannie Berlin calls her mother, actor/playwright/director Elaine May, her favorite acting mentor, and closest friend. In 1972, Berlin earned a Golden Globe and an Oscar nomination for her comedic performance in Elaine May’s comedy The Heartbreak Kid .\n\nBerlin appeared in 1970s movies Getting Straight , The Strawberry Statement , Portnoy’s Complaint, and Sheila Levine is Dead and Living in New York . In the latter, she played the lead. In television, she appeared in the series Columbo . With a decent comeback, Berlin has starred recently in Thomas Pynchon’s ’60s throwback adaptation, Inherent Vice (2014). She starred in Margaret , as well as Woody Allen’s Café Society .\n\nPaula Prentiss\n\nKnown for: The Stepford Wives\n\nNet worth: $8 million\n\nIn the 1960s Paula Prentiss was known as a comedic talent after starring in comedies like, Where the Boys Are and What’s New Pussycat? She teamed up with romantic-comedy co-star Jim Hutton for several similar films. She was loved as a comedian, although her talent for drama won acclaim as well. Especially in The Stepford Wives , a film that resonates today as a cult classic. She starred opposite big names like Steve McQueen and Rock Hudson.\n\nShe earned an Emmy nomination when she co-starred with her husband, Richard Benjamin, in the CBS sitcom He & She. The show only lasted a season, but their love has endured since 1961. They were married on October 26, 1961. The couple also appeared together in Catch-22.\n\nWarren Beatty\n\nKnown for: Reds and Bonnie and Clyde\n\nNet worth: $70 million\n\nHe made his film debut in Splendor in the Grass starring opposite Natalie Wood. Warren Beatty has a certain staying power, an omnipresence in Hollywood, an evergreen appeal. He could be the leading man at any age. Yet he’s not your average sex-symbol. He’s simply an unassuming and extraordinarily attractive man. True, male leads have a much longer shelf life, but let’s not digress. Starring in and producing film classics like Reds , Shampoo , Dick Tracy , Bonnie and Clyde , Heaven Can Wait and Bugsy , Beatty’s recognized for those 20th-century staples.\n\nAfter turning the role down for literally decades, in recent years Beatty finally agreed to portray Howard Hughes. But not for Warner Bros. who had been asking him to do it since the ’70s. Instead, Beatty co-produced, wrote, directed and starred in the 2016 film Rules Don’t Apply. Alec Baldwin, Matthew Broderick, Martin Sheen and his wife Annette Benning also starred. His opus Reds not only earned him a Best Director Academy Award, but also a personal gift of a box of cigars from Cuba’s Fidel Castro. Another role he turned down, two times--once for Oliver Stone, and once for Ron Howard—is Richard Nixon. Beatty refused because he thought the scripts were not compassionate enough. He admits being on Nixon’s former enemy list, but he has grown to feel sympathetic toward the ousted President.\n\nCher\n\nKnown for: “I Got You Babe”\n\nNet worth: $360 million\n\nIt’s hard to say whether Cher is more successful as a singer or as an actress. She’s definitely a master of reinvention. The come-back-kid has hit bottom in the industry only to bounce back with another hit. She’s the only recording artist with a No. 1 hit song spanning across six consecutive decades. She’s one of the best-selling musical artists of all time, and she’s won an Emmy, an Academy Award, a Grammy and three Golden Globes. Cher got her start in show biz after meeting Sonny Bono as a teen. The Sonny and Cher show climaxed in 1965 with “I Got You Babe.” She was 19. In 1974, the marriage fell apart, and so did the gig. Cher would bounce back, obviously, like a bouncing ball, but at the time it seemed like the Cher show had gone kaput. Undeterred, the fashion maven rocked on. Her movie career exploded with her second film performance in Silkwood . Co-starring with Meryl Streep, Cher won a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actress and was nominated for an Academy Award for the same category.\n\nShe’s a pop culture icon who's impossible to pin down. A new Broadway musical called The Cher Show attempts to do just that. The script provides three “Chers.” They call her: Babe Cher, Lady Cher, and Star Cher. Cher supports many causes. From humanitarian organizations to medical charity groups, she’s been an activist throughout her career. She’s the spokesperson for Keep a Child Alive organization, a program that helps children and families with HIV/AIDS. She’s also involved with Habitat for Humanity and Operation Helmet. She won the GLAAD Vanguard Award for her work supporting rights for gays and lesbians. Her daughter, Chaz Bono, who is now her son, transitioned from lesbian to transgender.\n\nAli MacGraw\n\nKnown for: Love Story\n\nNet worth: $6 million\n\nBorn Elizabeth Alice MacGraw in New York, she became a fashion model first, posing for Vogue and working as a stylist for the magazine. She also assisted fashion virtuoso and editor-in-chief Diana Vreeland at Harper’s Bazaar .\n\nAli MacGraw rose to stardom in the late ’60s, achieving international fame starring in Love Story (1970). Kicking it off with the film Goodbye, Columbus (1969), she won the Golden Globe Award for Most Promising Newcomer.

Apparently, she was surprised to find herself a misfit in Hollywood, for real. Author and actress, Sheedy, has not been afraid to be vocal about the industry’s penchant for body shaming, and she has spoken out as a #MeToo survivor. It’s no surprise. Her mother was active during the civil rights era with the feminist movement. Ally, in tow, attended her fair share of organized events.\n\nSheedy’s crowning achievement is an independent film called High Art. She played troubled photographer, Lucy Berliner. Her performance as the artsy lesbian with a heroin addiction was met with raving reviews. The 1998 film received the Independent Spirit Award, recognition from the Los Angeles Film Critics Association, and praise by the National Society of Film Critics. Sheedy is a card-holding “Brat Pack” member but loathes the term. She starred in St. Elmo’s Fire, Bad Boys (with Sean Penn) and WarGames.

Cate Blanchett and Kate Winslet were cast.\n\nGene Hackman\n\nKnown for: Unforgiven, French Connection, and The Conversation\n\nNet worth: $80 million\n\nGene Hackman is done with acting. He put in his 60 years and he doesn’t want to do it anymore. But, you know, if the perfect character rolls by he might just grab it. He certainly does not want to play some grandpa. What he loves to do is write, paint, and race cars. In 2016, he won the Long Beach Grand Prix Celebrity Race.\n\nHackman was born in 1930 to parents who ran a newspaper printing press. He dropped out of high school for the Marines (lying about his age to get in) but left the service after a year. He and his high school buddy, Dustin Hoffman, were slated “least likely to succeed,” yet somehow, he made it to Broadway. A fortuitous role in a 1964 Broadway play called Any Wednesday kicked off his career.

As for the “bad guy” label, he told KQED news, “I think, honestly, if you start your career playing sort of hugely immoral characters, which are always, of course, the most interesting, then you kind of get stuck with it. And if you play them with a certain relish then you really are in trouble.”\n\nMcDowell also gained notoriety as Caligula (1979). The very controversial Italian film about the rise and fall of the notorious Roman Emperor was so explicit that Penthouse produced it. During his reign, Caligula strove to increase an emperor’s unrestrained power and used it tyrannously in sadistic acts of murder and sexual perversion. He was known for his excessive sexual proclivities as well as for killing people for amusement. The perfect fit for McDowell. He also played in Star Trek Generations, Halloween II and Mississippi Murder. Look out for Fair and Balanced, in which McDowell is cast as the infamous Robert Murdoch.\n\nDiane Keaton\n\nKnown for: The Godfather and Reds\n\nNet worth: $50 million\n\nDiane Keaton is quirky, she’s funny, she’s truly adorable.

As one of the most prolific actors in Hollywood, Dern’s filmography, starring in over a hundred films spanning six decades, is a trailing list. He’s popular as the villain, having cemented that image as the bad guy in 1960s westerns like Cowboys , in which he notoriously shot John Wayne in the back. When told Americans would hate him for that, he famously quipped, “Yeah, but they’ll love me in Berkeley.”\n\nDern trained as a stage actor at The Actor’s Studio under Elia Kazan. He debuted in Kazan’s Wild River and became a talented television actor on shows such as Alfred Hitchcock Presents.

She continued to prove her genius. She’s now an EGOT club member. Hosting the popular talk show, The View earned her a Daytime Emmy Award and a lot of love.

It was so well-loved, a wildly popular 1970s TV series called Alice soon followed.\n\nLadd’s supporting role in Roman Polanski’s classic neo-noir mystery Chinatown starring Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway premiered the same year as Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore .

In Taxi Driver, Shepherd played a character whose preternatural beauty entranced and obsessed Robert DeNiro’s character.

It’s a pretty one, too. We first recognized it, and the rest of him, in Thelma and Louise as a hitchhiking charmer who Geena Davis’ “Thelma” falls for. The one-nighter proved instructive! In A River Runs Through It , Robert Redford’s 1992 blockbuster, Pitt proved his knack for serious acting, becoming the turning point in his career. Big roles began coming his way.

Another significant turning point occurred after starring in the cult-favorite, Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles .\n\nPrior to the onset of success, the Gen X favorite got bit parts in big movies like No Way Out, Less Than Zero and No Man’s Land.

They called her next.\n\nGeena Davis\n\nKnown for: The Fly , Beetlejuice and Thelma, and Louise\n\nNet worth: $30 million\n\nWith wide dimpled smiles framed by tussles of curly locks and a sweet-as-pie nature on top, Geena Davis was the sweetheart of Eighties and Nineties cinema.
