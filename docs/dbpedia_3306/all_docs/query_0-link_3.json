        "text": "The 1992 comedy stars Whoopi Goldberg as a nightclub singer who takes refuge in a convent when she witnesses her mob boyfriend (Keitel) kill an informant.\n\nThe movie was a hit and led to the sequel a year later, \"Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit,\" starring Goldberg who's now teaching a catholic school choir that included Lauryn Hill.\n\nBut it didn't star Keitel and the actor admitted he was disappointed.\n\n\"I never got that call and I said, 'What!?'\" the 82-year-old actor said. \"It was so perfect. The guy's in prison. He gets out of prison and he chases her down. My agent said, 'Harvey, you're not in the movie.' I said, 'No!'\"\n\nRelated stories\n\nIn fact, out of all the movies Keitel has done, he's only shown up in a sequel to one of them: 2007's \"National Treasure: Book of Secrets,\" the sequel to 2004's \"National Treasure.\"\n\nKeitel admitted through he's tried to be anti-sequel in his career.\n\n\"I'm not very big on sequels,\" he said. \"Now, I like to make money like anyone else does, but sometimes there's an unwillingness on my part to simply cash in.\"\n\nHowever, he certainly has a soft spot for \"Sister Act.\" When told that a third movie is in the works for Disney+, the actor got excited.\n\n\"Let's give them that plot. Finally, her ex-boyfriend gets out of jail and chases her down,\" he said.\n\nKeitel can currently be seen in the movie \"Lansky,\" centered on the life of gangster Meyer Lansky. The movie is out now in theaters and On Demand."
