        "text": "Harvey Keitel, Emile Hirsch and Ruby Rose are to star in upcoming gangster drama The Legitimate Wise Guy.\n\nThe film — being introduced to buyers at the upcoming virtual 2021 European Film Market by The Exchange — is set to tell the true story of Anthony Spilotro, considered one of the most feared enforcers to come out of the notorious crime syndicate known as the Chicago Outfit (which rose to power in the 1920s under Al Capone). Spilotro ran the outfit’s casino skimming operations in Las Vegas, where he would meet a young man dreaming of becoming a Hollywood actor. Seeing an opportunity to expand his operation, he begins to mentor and lure the aspiring actor in his criminal web.\n\nBased on an original screenplay by Nicholas Celozzi (Shattered, Momo: The Sam Giancana Story) and Jim McGrath (Kickboxer: Retaliation), The Legitimate Wise Guy is being directed by Bad Boys writer George Gallo (Midnight Run, The Comeback Trail). Celozzi produces for Monaco Films (Kickboxer reboot) and Richard Salvatore for March on Productions (The Comeback Trail), with Michael Sportelli of Monaco Films and Freddy Braidy (Rescue Dawn, Gospel Hill) serving as executive producers.\n\nProduction on the film is schedule to start in Spring 2021.\n\n“We are excited about this ensemble cast, having Harvey, Emile and Ruby makes this exciting story valuable to global distributors,” said Brian O’Shea, CEO of The Exchange, which is handling worldwide sales.\n\nKeitel is represented by The Artists Partnership and Untitled Entertainment, Hirsch by UTA and Jackoway Austen Tyerman Wertheimer Mandelbaum Morris Bernstein Trattner & Klein and Rose by Art2perform, UTA and Hirsch Wallerstein Hayum Matlof and Fishman."
