        "text": "Rehearsals for Sister Act here at Geva are about to start, coincidentally almost exactly 30 years after the movie’s initial release. While everyone is preparing for the terrific cast to join us, I couldn’t help but wonder about the differences between the musical and the original movie.\n\nSister Act (the movie) was released in theaters in May of 1992 and starred Whoopi Goldberg, Maggie Smith, Kathy Najimy, and Harvey Keitel. It followed one Deloris Van Cartier, a Black nightclub singer looking for her big break, as she gets mixed up in some mob business and is forced into hiding, and ends up in an all-white convent. It’s a great story about faith, joy, and some very cool nuns. It grossed $231.6 million in the box office worldwide and was hugely popular, getting a sequel in 1993 and a third movie currently in the works by Disney.\n\nIn 2006, a musical based on the Sister Act movie premiered at the Pasadena Playhouse in California, to great acclaim. It subsequently opened in London in 2009, and on Broadway in 2011. It was destined to be a success: with music by Alan Menken and lyrics by Glenn Slater, and book by Bill and Cheri Steinkellner, the musical is a party through and through.\n\nIf you have only ever seen the movie (and you liked it), you are sure to recognize the frankly delightful storyline. You should be prepared for a few differences, though.\n\nFirst off, the musical takes place in Philadelphia. Lovers of the Sister Act movie may recall that Goldberg’s character, Deloris, originally relocates from Reno, Nevada, to San Francisco, California. The farthest move Deloris takes in the musical is from Philadelphia to South Philadelphia. Without spoiling anything for those who are unfamiliar with the movie, this short move makes the stakes of the conflict much higher and makes the resolution that much more satisfying. Deloris is not in a new place, and yet she has everything to lose if she can’t blend in. It also means the musical takes place in a wildly different environment than the original movie. San Francisco and Philadelphia couldn’t be more different, and yet the change makes sense.\n\nThe musical also changed the time period of the story. While the movie was set in the 1990s, the musical is set in the late 1970s. While writing the adaptation, Menken and Slater decided to use ’70s pop music, disco, psychedelic soul, and funk to better encapsulate the heart of the story and the characters. To fit this music inspiration and the new setting, the time period was shifted two decades earlier.\n\nOf course, some things were changed to make the story fit the musical theatre structure. The pacing is faster, a few names are changed, and some plot points were added or removed to make actions flow smoother into each other, all of which are fairly typical of movie-to-musical adaptations, and just serve to keep the show coherent and connected.\n\nPerhaps the biggest (and best, in my opinion) difference between the movie and the musical is that the musical is extremely fun. The movie is great, don’t get me wrong. It’s well-written, well-produced, well-acted, and includes all the things that would make a good movie. The Sister Act musical, though, doesn’t take itself nearly as seriously as the movie. Every character is genuine, of course, but they all have at least one comedic moment. It knows the story is borderline unbelievable, and yet at every moment it is entertaining. Even the more serious moments have a comedic section or a humorous air about them, and both the audience and the characters are in on nearly every joke.\n\nThe characters are incredibly loveable. Deloris is hilarious, upbeat, and confident, and each nun has a certain comedic quirk that makes them much more memorable. The bad guys are goofy, and again each has their own individual quirk that makes their interactions all the more laughable. The script is a joy to read or hear, and the songs are extremely catchy and enjoyable. The whole experience makes your heart full, and you come away from it with a smile. The best way I can describe it is simply just plain fun. A perfect description is this one, by Whoopi Goldberg herself: “it’s hell-bent on being fun and silly, with a little heart thrown in.”\n\nIf all of this sounds appealing to you, Geva’s upcoming production of Sister Act is a great chance to see this musical.\n\nSister Act is a wonderful show to produce now, keeping in mind that the original productions were full of archetypes and stereotypes of both race and religion, as well as it being nearly 30 years after the movie’s release. The production’s director, Julio Agustin, is looking beyond the previously typical casting to unlock the heart of the conflict of Sister Act. He believes that “Sister Act, when told with honesty, is about flawed people saying and doing good and bad things while also having the ability to take responsibility for these.” At its heart, the musical is about coming together and overcoming a divide, whether religious, racial, or cultural. In Agustin’s words, “it is very much about what is happening today, a timely piece about generational divide, the contrast between old and new, disagreements between tradition and transition.” This production brings a modern take to a musical that is a perfect candidate for it, while still being true to its original setting (and maybe even more true than the original production).\n\nIn short, if this would be your first exposure to this wonderful adaptation (as it is mine), I highly recommend you give it a shot. It is sure to be a fabulously entertaining event that you won’t want to miss."
