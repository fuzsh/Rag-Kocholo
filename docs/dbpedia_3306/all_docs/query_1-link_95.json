        "text": "As a cinephile, my sources to build a watchlist come from all kinds of places: other people’s recommendations, appealing cast and crew, curiosity, checking boxes, etc. When I think of films recommended to me, Thelma & Louise was one of them and definitely among the best. I have to thank my mother for that. When I was a teenager, still living with my parents and a new cinephile, I used to go to that video renting store on Friday at the end of the school week where I rented new-to-me classics that I’d often watch with my mother and that she’ll discover along with me. Rebel Without a Cause, Gone with the Wind, Lawrence of Arabia, The Wild One, Bonnie & Clyde, etc. were among those. But, as I said, Thelma & Louise was a film my mother had seen before, and her recommendation was based on the fact that I had loved Bonnie & Clyde. The story is not the same, but with the armed robbery and the overall road trip concept, there is a connection to make. And my mother knew me well because I absolutely loved it, and it’s still a favourite today.\n\nSo, I think it was about time for me to discuss it. When Rob from MovieRob contacted his little crew to see if we were interested in participating in his Genre Grandeur, I thought I really should this time since I missed so many of those. The concept of what is also known as “GG” is simple. Each month, a blogger picked by Rob chooses a genre, and those who wish to participate write a review of a favourite film connected to that genre. The genre chosen can be broad. It’s not just drama or comedy as “genre” is used as a vast term. So, this month, we’re exploring films that feature and take place in desert areas. Paul of The People’s Movies chose the theme. And you see me coming. Because of its last act, I went with Thelma & Louise. I also could have taken Lawrence of Arabia because I love that film, but I already reviewed it on my blog.\n\nThelma & Louise was directed by Ridley Scott (my favourite film of his) and released in 1991. The screenplay is by Callie Khouri (the fact that it was written by a woman is very important to consider). The film stars Susan Sarandon, Geena Davis, and Harvey Keitel, and it features Michael Madsen, Christophe McDonalds, Brad Pitt, Timothy Carhart and Stephen Tobolowsky.\n\nBefore going further with the film, I rarely do this, but that review will contain some spoilers, especially since the last act is crucial when discussing the desert landscapes of the film. I will try to indicate them as much as possible. So, if you haven’t seen it yet, you can skip those parts. But, to be honest, if you haven’t seen it, I don’t know what you are waiting for!\n\n***\n\nThelma Dickinson (Geena Davis) and Louise Sawyer (Susan Sarandon) are two best friends planning to go on a fishing trip in the mountains for the weekend. They both live pretty ordinary lives in Arkansas. Thelma is a housewife who has to bear with her insufferable husband, Darryl (Christopher McDonalds), a carpet salesman who doesn’t give a shit about his wife and expects her to be home all the time to prepare meals and clean. Louise is busy working as a waitress in a breakfast restaurant and dates Jimmy Lennox (Michael Madsen), a musician, but things seem complicated. Anyway, after an act of rebellion on Thelma’s behalf, aka not asking her husband’s permission to go on a trip with Louise, the two friends are on their way for some fun and to forget their boring daily life. On the road, they stop at a roadhouse bar for a pause and to have a drink. There’s a band playing country music, and people line dance. It’s overall a pretty festive ambience. A man, Harlan Puckett (Timothy Carhart), spots Thelma and immediately starts flirting with her. The latter, now carefree and out of her trap, doesn’t seem to mind much, but Louise finds him dull and annoying. She doesn’t hesitate to blow her cigarette smoke in his face (and that’s honestly one of my favourite parts of the film). Harlan and Thelma end up dancing together and let’s say that Harlan doesn’t give Thelma much space. At some point, Louise goes to the bathroom and warns Thelma that they’ll be on their way after that.\n\nMeanwhile, Thelma, who’s not feeling well after drinking lots of alcohol and spinning endlessly on the dancefloor, says to Harlan that she has to go out for a breath of fresh air. He follows her and starts flirting with her in the parking lot and starts to be very tactile. Thelma, who’s not down for that anymore, asks him to stop. He instantly shows his true terrible nature and rapes her after slapping her face a few times. It is violent and always difficult to watch. He hasn’t heard Louise coming, and the latter points a gun at him and tells him to stop. As idiot as he is, he says something in the likes of “We were just having some fun”. To what Louise answers, her face and voice full of rage, “When a woman is crying like that, she is not having any fun!” Harlan, a disgusting rag, says he should have continued. Louise, full of hangers, ends up shooting him.\n\nThe two women drive off. Thelma suggests to call the police. Louise, who knows the justice system won’t play in their favour (and she’s right), prefers to run away. Therefore starts the wild escape of Thelma and Louise, full of danger and excitement. They are running for their life, in search of a better one, now that they can’t look back. On this transformative road trip, they will meet more men, such as the handsome JD (Brad Pitt), an ex-convict on parole. Jimmy will surprise Louise in a motel. Thelma will learn the art of armed robbery. Above all, they will stick together no matter what because that is how strong the power of friendship is. Detective Hal Slocumb (Harvey Keitel) is on the case, and he seems to be the only man who tries to understand the two ladies and doesn’t want anything bad to happen to them.\n\n***\n\nWhen Callie Khouri started developing the project in 1988, she was inspired by her own friendship with country singer Pam Tillis. And Thelma & Louise is, first and foremost, a true ode to the strength of female bounds and friendship, a direct dive into a form of sisterhood where the connection surpasses the differences of character and contradicted personalities. Thelma and Louise are already established friends as the film begins. We don’t know for how long they’ve been friends. They are about in their mid-thirties, so they could have been friends since childhood or high school. May something that simply clicked with them in recent years, a friendly love at first sight. On my side, I opt for the old friendship option. I feel like they could have become friends during high school, a time when friendships are deeply meaningful. I can perfectly picture Louise warning Thelma against marrying the stupid Darryl. I mean, where does this guy come from? He certainly doesn’t match Thelma’s sense of fun and repressed sense of adventure. In that sense, Louise acts as the elder sister figure in the duo. You feel she had more experience in life than Thelma and is here to protect her. Not just after the story’s catalyst but overall, making sure Thelma is alright. On her side, Thelma has so much to discover about life. In just a few day’s trip, she’ll live a lifetime, and her transformation is genuine. Thelma is the unlucky of the story, especially with men who abuse her in many ways. Louise is a victim of that as well, but at least she has Jimmy, who overall seems to be an ok guy. You also feel that Detective Slocumb is on her side, knowing about her past history in Texas (a taboo subject for Louise) and acting as a compassionate figure although he is on the side of the law that the two ladies are running away from.\n\nWith this in mind, the road trip idea is of primary importance. It cements Thelma and Louise’s friendship but also provokes a noteworthy change of roles. Louise, who’s the leader and sort of has a “bad girl” aura in the sense that she works and isn’t married, eventually becomes the little sister guided by Thelma’s motivation and will to go on no matter what. This turn of situation, although gradual, is particularly noticeable when [SPOILER] after a torrid night between Thelma and the sexy JD (Brad Pitt), the two friends discover that the latter, an imposter, has stolen the $ 6000 brought in person by Jimmy to help the girls. That is the last straw for Louise, who collapses and bursts into tears on the motel room floor, unable to see the end of their problems. [END OF SPOILER] Thelma, who so far had been the one having those reactions, knows she’s now the one who has to lead the pack. After clumsily telling Louise everything will be alright, she takes a firmer tone and orders her to get up and look forward instead of looking back. That’s how Thelma is now: someone who has to leave her regrets and bad memories in the past and always prefers to discover what the future is saving for her. If there are obstacles on the way, she’ll do everything to surpass them, even if it means doing a hold-up in a road convenience store in the middle of nowhere or locking a policeman in the trunk of his police car. She’s fearless. Louise now becomes the one who “follows”, and she knows they will both end in the same place. Thelma’s behaviour and style also change as the film progresses. She goes from being the proper lad, always well-groomed, to the one wearing jeans and t-shirts and smoking cigarettes, something she doesn’t seem to have done before. At this point, she and Thelma know they have nothing to lose.\n\nAlthough not the first choices, Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon were carefully selected to play the leading roles of Thelma Dickinson and Louise Sawyer. Geena Davis, already an Oscar in her pocket from The Accidental Tourist, delivers another Oscar-nominated performance as the fascinating Thelma. She’s simply sparkling and someone who, despite all the difficulties her character goes through, perfectly embodies the sense of fun. On her side, Susan Sarandon was in the film industry since the early 70s and was seen in other cult movies like The Rocky Horror Picture Show and The Hunger, already paving her way to exist in challenging films. Finding the right Louise took time, but, in the end, the final choice was the right one. Susan Sarandon perfectly embodies the maturity necessary for her character, as well as a woman with a traumatic past. One gaze, one twitch of the eye, is enough to embody her emotions. Although she lived difficult things, just like Thelma, she learns to look forward even tho she’s conscious of the danger. Sarandon was also nominated for an Oscar for her memorable performance.\n\nThelma & Louise, aside from being a film about female friendship, depicts the injustices and inequalities women live in everyday life and with the justice system. In a way, Harlan is “executed” by Louise for the crime he committed. However, Louise, the executor, is now seen as a criminal even tho she was defending her friend. Thelma’s first idea after the incident is to go to the police, which is a big no-no for Louise, who knows they don’t have any proof to incriminate Harlan. Problems like that have always happened and still happen to this day. In a way, it’s Thelma and Louise’s words against Harlan’s, except he’s now dead, so it becomes difficult to reach conclusions for someone who isn’t a witness. And when you think of it, we, the spectators, are witnesses but helpless ones. Troubles with men go on, which gives place to an interesting herd of male supporting actors, starting with Brad Pitt as JD. Pitt was still on his way to stardom when playing in the film. As JD, he knows perfectly how to play the charisma card (I mean, it’s Brad Pitt), but also how to act a bit idiot and docile to create the false aura of the good pitiful guy and, therefore, reach his means. So, once again, Thelma falls into a trap, and she and Louise face an extra obstacle. Louise’s guy, Jimmy, is portrayed by Michael Madsen, who, despite having some hanger in him and having difficulty understanding Louise, remains a decent person whose feelings for Louise are real. He doesn’t want to put any more obstacles in her already challenging situation. When he returns home after seeing Louise, he’s welcomed by the police, who are here to question him about Louise. We see his surprised reaction, but that’s the only interaction seen between him and the police. We have no idea if he told them where and when he saw his girlfriend. [SPOILER] The police end up tracking the two women’s geographical position thanks to a phone call, and that’s how they eventually manage to find them. [END OF SPOILER]. Michael Madsen plays against type in this film and is far from the eccentric and psychotic character we’ll see in the following year in Quentin Tarantino’s Reservoir Dogs.\n\nAlthough the interaction between Jimmy and the police has limited screen time, the situation is different with Thelma’s husband, Darryl, who has numerous interactions with the police, especially with Detective Slocumb. Christopher McDonald turns out to be the comic relief, although unintentional on Darryl’s part. I mean, you better take the guy seriously. So much so that he even makes the detective laugh when walking in his pizza. That’s one of my favourite moments of the film. Darryl likes to act as a very busy guy, but he’s just a spoiled teen Thelma has to look after. Interestingly, McDonald and Geena Davis were engaged in 1984, and he was thrilled to participate in this project with Davis. Maybe it was the right ingredient to play an “old couple” who can’t stand each other anymore, knowing they are trapped together. On his side, Harvey Keitel was already a well-established film figure after entering the 7th art during the “New Hollywood” Era, especially with Scorsese’s films like Mean Streets and Taxi Driver. His experience shows, and, aside from Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon, he’s the best actor in the cast. He tactfully expresses the complexity of his character by not being over the top and making sure he can be a trustworthy figure. It kind of half works, but the intentions are here. The only time we truly see him lose his temper is when he interrogates JD, knowing that the two ladies might be in even deeper problems because of him.\n\nThere are a lot of great performances by Keitel, but this one might be my favourite because of how sincere it is. One of my favourite acting moments in the film is brief and involves him and Susan Sarandon. Louise is talking to Slocumb on the phone. She doesn’t want to admit her defeat, especially because she’s scared of what might happen next if she gets caught. At the end of the call, the detective, full of compassion and with a touch of sadness in his voice, tells Louise he knows why she is running away and what happened to her in Texas. After that, Louise, tears of rage in her eyes, ends the conversation. Although Slocumb uses the verb “knows” in “I know why you’re running away”, his delivery translates it as “I understand”. I’ll let you watch the scene here:\n\nThelma & Louise, although telling a difficult story, transposes the latter on a gorgeous filming support. The various American landscapes are magnified for the screen by the masterful work of English cinematographer Adrian Biddle. He manages to give an indescribable aura to the different places we encounter. It adds to the transformations the ladies live. We see a lot of desolate spaces that seem to have no ends, that will never reach busy civilisation, just like the two friends have taken a road to nowhere. Through the camera work, we feel the heaviness of those places. Hans Zimmer’s soundtrack (my favourite composition by him) adds mysticism to these places and is often heard in decisive moments. The ladies find a joie de vivre when driving and singing along with the music playing on the car radio. Those are various popular songs, such as” The Way You Do the Things You Do” by The Temptations.\n\nBefore going further, take the time to listen to one of Hans Zimmer’s pieces for the film, “Thuderbird”, and appreciate all the melancholy it embodies:\n\nThe visual beauty of the film and the soundtrack reach a common culminant point to what we are mostly writing this review for: the desert. After seeing a lot of different places through Arkansas and New Mexico, the duo reaches the creme de la creme of American landscapes: the Grand Canyon, finding themselves at the heart of the semi-desert area of Arizona. It’s a landscape that is beyond them and certainly larger than life. However, the ending was not shot at the Grand Canyon but at Dead Horse Point State Park in Utah, an imposing and infinite desert landscape. We also see the iconic Monument Valley, often used in Westerns or road movies like The Searchers or Easy Rider. Although the two ladies are running away for their lives and manage to challenge and surpass the many obstacles, their awe is well-transmitted when they finally reach these gorgeous but imposing sceneries. After a wild car chase with the police, they arrive next to the Grand Canyon’s precipice and can’t go further. If they turn back, they’ll get caught by the police with open arms. It’s then windy and dry. They have sand all over their skins and hair and have reached the end of their possibilities. Or did they? [SPOILER] Remember how Thelma and Louise always want to go further. Instead of turning themselves down to the police, they decide to go forward. “Let’s keep going!” Thelma says to Louise. The latter asks, “What do you mean?” although she knows perfectly what she means. Thelma has made up her mind, and Louise, a true pal to the very end, goes along with her. So, after a kiss, hands in hands, they go full-spin towards the precipice, and the blue Ford Thunderbird flies over the Grand Canyon. It became one of the most iconic images in cinema history. The two ladies, knowing they couldn’t face what society has in reserve for them, preferred to keep the souvenir of each other in that poetic but brutal final decision. [END OF SPOILER]\n\nOn its release, Thelma & Louise was a commercial success and a critical one. Callie Khouri won the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay, and the film was nominated for five more: Best Director (Ridley Scott), Best Actress 1 (Geena Davis), Best Actress 2 (Susan Sarandon), Best Cinematography (Adria Biddle) and Best Editing (Thom Noble), as well as other prices at various Awards ceremonies and festivals. However, I fail to see why it wasn’t nominated for Best Picture.\n\n***\n\nIf you still haven’t seen Thelma & Louise, I urge you to do so. It’s a film to see once in a lifetime, AT THE VERY LEAST, for how powerful and beautiful it is. And well, since it’s not a too old classic, it’s not difficult to find. So, no excuses!\n\nThanks to Rob for organizing Genre Grandeur and to Paul for choosing this creative theme!\n\nSee you!"
