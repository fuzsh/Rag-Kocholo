        "text": "Maggie Smith\n\nKnown for: The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie and Professor McGonagall\n\nNet worth: $18 million\n\nBritish actress, Maggie Smith, achieved an outstanding success on the London Stage. Her illustrious career has spanned six decades. She’s appeared in more than 50 films. She won an Academy Award for Best Actress in The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie , and she won a Best Supporting Actress Award for California Suite .\n\nSmith was born in Essex and now resides in London. Her mom was a secretary, and her dad taught at Oxford University. Maggie Smith’s extensive work has made her the quintessential British film and television actor. Just think of her as the Countess in Downton Abbey. Professor McGonagall, her role in the Harry Potter film series, is also indicative of her acting milieu. As a ’90s flashback, her pretentious but bending role as Reverend Mother in the classic comedy Sister Act with Whoopi Goldberg had us rolling in the aisles.\n\nDustin Hoffman\n\nKnown for: The Graduate and Tootsie\n\nNet worth: $50 million\n\nThe Graduate propelled Dustin Hoffman into superstardom. Fame was an unexpected surprise. He found himself longing to go back to the stage after the notice barraged him with a slew of “crappy” parts. The film itself was an unexpected hit. Hoffman’s exceptional performance and a soundtrack featuring Simon and Garfunkel helped make it an enduring smash hit.\n\nAnd he has so many more amazing films! The seminal drama Kramer vs. Kramer and the unparalleled Rain Man earned him a Best Actor Award at the 1980 and 1989 Academy Awards ceremonies. Tootsie , his cross-dressing role, plays Dorothy Michaels who is actually Michael Dorsey looking for work as a starving actor and trying his luck as a woman. It was uber-popular. But Midnight Cowboy , All the President’s Men and Lenny didn’t do too bad either. We’re not going to mention the sexual harassment allegations and subsequent scandal. I mean, who wants to talk about sex scandals?\n\nJanice Rule\n\nKnown for: Missing\n\nNet worth: $10 million\n\nDancer and actor, Janice Rule began dancing at the Chez Paree nightclub at the tender age of 15. She studied dancing and acting and made the cover of Life as an up-and-coming star.\n\nRule became a psychotherapist by trade but hit it big in the 1960s getting her break in Hollywood with Joan Crawford’s 1951 movie Goodbye, My Fancy. While she was successful on Broadway with such shows as Picnic, The Flowering Peach and The Happiest Girl in the World, she preferred film. In the 1950s she began appearing in many movies including A Woman’s Devotion. She also appeared on a Twilight Zone episode. Rule starred in The Swimmer, 3 Women, and American Flyers. In Missing, a true story, political thriller, she portrayed journalist, Kate Newman. Rule died of a cerebral hemorrhage in 2003.\n\nLance Kerwin\n\nKnown for: James at 15\n\nNet worth: $1 million\n\nPopular 1970s child actor, Lance Kerwin grew up the youngest of five brothers in sunny Newport Beach, California. The ’70s heartthrob came in number 82 on VH1’s 2005, The Greatest: 100 Greatest Kid Stars.\n\nJames at 15 was once a wildly popular teen TV drama series. The made-for-TV pilot movie starred with well-liked child actress, Melissa Sue Anderson from Little House on the Prairie. The series was renamed James at 16, accordingly. He also starred in the TV movies The Loneliest Runner and Salem’s Lot. Currently sober, he’s a Christian pastor living on the Hawaii rehab ranch called U-Turn For Christ. He’s also a timeshare salesman for Wyndham Resorts on Kauai.\n\nRonee Blakley\n\nKnown for: Nashville\n\nNet worth: $1 million\n\nRonee Blakley rose to Hollywood’s attention playing a fictional country music superstar in the 1975 movie Nashville . The truth is, Blakley’s a Juilliard-trained musician who won the affections of the one and only Bob Dylan. He cast her in his movie Renaldo and Clara as “Mrs. Dylan,” and they recorded songs together. She sings background vocals in songs like Hurricane .\n\nFor the role of Barbara Jean, Blakley won Best Supporting Actress nominations across the board—an Academy, a BAFTA and a Golden Globe. Blakley starred in the legendary slasher horror flick A Nightmare on Elm Street. Most recently, we can find her in Scorsese’s Netflix film Rolling Thunder Revue: A Bob Dylan Story by Martin Scorsese.\n\nEmilio Estevez\n\nKnown for: The Breakfast Club\n\nNet worth: $18 million\n\nThis “Brat Packer” grew up in the midst of wild success. N.Y.C.-born Emilio Estevez went to the Philippines as a kid because his dad, Martin Sheen, was filming Apocalypse Now . His brother, Charlie Sheen, grew up on movie sets too. And Sean Penn and Rob Lowe were always around, like brothers. Estevez and Lowe were part of The Outsiders ensemble, with Emilio playing “Two-Bit” and Lowe as “Sodapop.” His career was preordained.\n\nIn The Breakfast Club , he played “the jock.” He was a law student and the waiter at St. Elmo’s Bar in the prominent coming-of-age St. Elmo’s Fire movie. It wasn’t the only movie he starred in with Demi Moore to whom he was once engaged. They met up again in Wisdom (1986) and Bobby (2006). Both of which he directed. Later he directed, wrote and starred in Men at Work (1990) with Charlie Sheen. In 2018 he released The Public . He starred in the film with Alec Baldwin and Christian Slater. Estevez is less willing to jump into TV or Netflix projects than some of his ilks. He doesn’t want the attention.\n\nRobert De Niro\n\nKnown for: The Godfather Part II , Raging BullI and “You Talkin’ to me?”\n\nNet worth: $300 million\n\nCinematic “tough-guy” titan Robert De Niro is known for working closely with legendary director Martin Scorcese. His lucrative career revved for takeoff with Copolla’s The Godfather Part II where he played a younger version of Marlon Brando’s Vito Corleone. It secured him a nomination for the Best Supporting Actor Oscar. It was then he hooked up with Scorsese for Mean Streets , Good Fellas , Raging Bull , and, of course, Taxi Driver . The latter gave us De Niro’s mostly improvised Travis Bickle monologue with the classic, “You talkin’ to me?” line. He was nominated for Best Actor in Taxi Driver , but he won the Oscar in 1981 for Scorsese’s Raging Bull . He was also nominated for Scorsese’s Cape Fear . Suffice it to say the pair is a legendary team. A 2019 Netflix project, The Irishman , is their latest collaboration.\n\nHe’s also known for extreme conditioning for roles. He spent four months perfecting his Sicilian dialect for Vito Corleone’s dialogue, he learned to play the saxophone, for Cape Fear he paid a dentist $5,000 to make his teeth look terrible, and he worked as a cabbie to prepare for Taxi Driver . De Niro is a long-time liberal. So, what does he think of Trump? Here goes: “He’s a punk, he’s a dog, he’s a pig, he’s a con, he’s a mutt who doesn’t know what he’s talking about, he doesn’t do his homework, doesn’t care, . . . doesn’t pay his taxes, he’s an idiot.”\n\nJane Fonda\n\nKnown for: Antiwar activist, Feminist, Klute and On Golden Pond\n\nNet worth: $200 million\n\nBorn into a Hollywood family dynasty, Jane Fonda was destined to cinematic greatness. Her father was Henry Fonda, and her mother was socialite Frances Ford Seymour. Jane’s marriages were equally influential. She married politician Tom Hayden and billionaire media mogul Ted Turner, in that order, but then divorced them both. Her first husband was French film director Roger Vadim. In the 1980s, Ms. Fonda added: “fitness expert” to her curriculum vitae. She released Jane Fonda’s Workout video in 1982. You may be asking yourself: Did it sell well? Yes. Resoundingly. It was the best-selling VHS video—ever. It sold something like seventeen million copies.\n\nAs a serious anti-war activist during the Vietnam War era, she traveled to Vietnam to support P.O.W.s. Photographed sitting on top of a North Vietnamese anti-aircraft gun, she came back with the nickname “Hanoi Jane.” Other unflattering epithets greeted her as well. \"Hippie scum\" comes to mind, for one. Her efforts landed her on the Hollywood blacklist. The 1972 image in Vietnam was as ubiquitous as the iconic \"victory\" image of the man she was protesting, President Richard Nixon. Besides being a 1970s counterculture renegade, a fitness guru, and a fixture in Hollywood, the Academy Award-winning actress is also a long-time feminist, active with causes such as V-Day.\n\nMichael Douglas\n\nKnown for: Fatal Attraction and Gordon Gekko\n\nNet worth: $300 million\n\nOliver Stone’s iconic Wall Street definitively encapsulated an epoch of American capitalism. It was ugly and dark, and its antihero didn’t fare well, but Michael Douglas absolutely nailed it as the ruthless stock market titan Gordon Gekko. Fierce delivery of a line such as, “When I get a hold of the son-a-bitch who leaked this, I’m going to tear his eyeballs out! I’m going to suck his f***ing skull!” made his performance an epic gift to cinema. The Academy agreed. Douglas took home the Oscar for Best Actor.\n\nOpening at the peak of the materialistic me-generation in 1987, Wall Street was synonymous with the times, it was like an incisive snapshot of wealth and power inside the dark entrails of American financial markets. At a time when “downsizing” was like a euphemism meaning, ‘hundreds of people will lose their job,’ Gekko depicts a merciless Wall Street trader. Questioned about why he wants to wreck a major company, Gekko, pictured above in slicked back hair (hair gel was huge in the ’80s), barks back, “Because it’s wreckable!! Alright!!” Michael Douglas has plenty of other epic films under his belt. He produced One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest, for chrissakes, winning the Best Picture Oscar. And, in Fatal Attraction, his character’s travails left viewers with an indelible fear of a new kind of terror. Romancing the Stone was huge, as was Basic Instinct. Currently, he’s active in humanitarian and political activism and stars in The Kominsky Method.\n\nSissy Spacek\n\nKnown for: Coal Miner’s Daughter\n\nNet worth: $15 million\n\nSissy Spacek was born Mary Elizbeth, but her brothers called her “Sissy,” and the name stuck. She hoped for a career in the music business but settled for film instead, after the music gig sputtered out. She enrolled at the Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute and found her way into Andy Warhol’s Factory as an extra. At that point, small film parts began rolling in.\n\nShe played the teenage girlfriend of Charlie Sheen’s mass murderer character in Badlands. But it was the supernatural horror movie Carrie that gained her enough praise to be nominated for a Best Actress Oscar. In Coal Miner’s Daughter, she truly nailed it with an Jennifer Greyscar win playing Lorretta Lynn. Loretta Lynn personally approved the role, and Sissy got to do some singing. Other popular films she starred in are JFK, In the Bedroom and Crimes of the Heart.\n\nSigourney Weaver\n\nKnown for: Ghostbuster and Queen of Sci-FI\n\nNet worth: $50 million\n\nThough not an official member of the “Brat Pack,” Sigourney Weaver was a hot ’80s movie star with a sizzling following. Back in the late-Seventies, Woody Allen set her up in a role in Annie Hall . It was a small part, all of six seconds on screen, but it got her noticed! Before long, Sigourney co-starred with Mel Gibson in The Year of Living Dangerously It received a Palme d’Or-nomination at Cannes. Ghostbusters wasn’t far behind.

As for the “bad guy” label, he told KQED news, “I think, honestly, if you start your career playing sort of hugely immoral characters, which are always, of course, the most interesting, then you kind of get stuck with it. And if you play them with a certain relish then you really are in trouble.”\n\nMcDowell also gained notoriety as Caligula (1979). The very controversial Italian film about the rise and fall of the notorious Roman Emperor was so explicit that Penthouse produced it. During his reign, Caligula strove to increase an emperor’s unrestrained power and used it tyrannously in sadistic acts of murder and sexual perversion. He was known for his excessive sexual proclivities as well as for killing people for amusement. The perfect fit for McDowell. He also played in Star Trek Generations, Halloween II and Mississippi Murder. Look out for Fair and Balanced, in which McDowell is cast as the infamous Robert Murdoch.\n\nGene Hackman\n\nKnown for: Unforgiven, French Connection, and The Conversation\n\nNet worth: $80 million\n\nGene Hackman is done with acting. He put in his 60 years and he doesn’t want to do it anymore. But, you know, if the perfect character rolls by he might just grab it. He certainly does not want to play some grandpa. What he loves to do is write, paint, and race cars. In 2016, he won the Long Beach Grand Prix Celebrity Race.\n\nHackman was born in 1930 to parents who ran a newspaper printing press. He dropped out of high school for the Marines (lying about his age to get in) but left the service after a year. He and his high school buddy, Dustin Hoffman, were slated “least likely to succeed,” yet somehow, he made it to Broadway. A fortuitous role in a 1964 Broadway play called Any Wednesday kicked off his career. It led him to a small role in Warren Beatty’s film Bonnie and Clyde which earned him a Best Supporting Actor Academy nomination. He won the Oscar for Detective “Popeye” Doyle in The French Connection. By age 40, he had cemented himself as a cinematic legend.\n\nLiv Ullmann\n\nKnown for: The Emigrants\n\nNet worth: $20 million\n\nCelebrated muse of Swedish director Ingmar Bergman, Liv Ullmann was known as “The Norwegian Angel.” Before she worked with the renowned director, Ullmann gained recognition for playing Nora in the Henrik Ibsen play, A Doll’s House .\n\nCollaborating with Bergman, Ullmann starred in ten of his films, including her most distinguished achievements. Of mention are Persona, The Passion of Anna, and Autumn Sonata. In all, she was nominated 40 times for acting awards. In Bergman’s movies The Emigrants and Face to Face, Ullmann was nominated for a Best Actress Academy Award in both films. Since the early 1990s, Ullmann’s directorial ambitions commenced with a film called Sofie. Faithless, her second effort, was acclaimed at Cannes. Her latest movie, a 2014 film adaptation of Miss Julie, was received with praise by Norwegian critics. An ongoing project that is near and dear to her heart is a film version of A Doll’s House. Cate Blanchett and Kate Winslet were cast.\n\nAlly Sheedy\n\nKnown for: The Breakfast Club\n\nNet worth: $7 million\n\nIf you’re like me, Ally Sheedy’s quirky “Allison,” an adorably messed-up high school misfit, was your favorite Breakfast Club character. Apparently, she was surprised to find herself a misfit in Hollywood, for real. Author and actress, Sheedy, has not been afraid to be vocal about the industry’s penchant for body shaming, and she has spoken out as a #MeToo survivor. It’s no surprise. Her mother was active during the civil rights era with the feminist movement. Ally, in tow, attended her fair share of organized events.\n\nSheedy’s crowning achievement is an independent film called High Art. She played troubled photographer, Lucy Berliner. Her performance as the artsy lesbian with a heroin addiction was met with raving reviews. The 1998 film received the Independent Spirit Award, recognition from the Los Angeles Film Critics Association, and praise by the National Society of Film Critics. Sheedy is a card-holding “Brat Pack” member but loathes the term. She starred in St. Elmo’s Fire, Bad Boys (with Sean Penn) and WarGames. She dated Richie Sambora of Bon Jovi in the 1980s.\n\nAli MacGraw\n\nKnown for: Love Story\n\nNet worth: $6 million\n\nBorn Elizabeth Alice MacGraw in New York, she became a fashion model first, posing for Vogue and working as a stylist for the magazine. She also assisted fashion virtuoso and editor-in-chief Diana Vreeland at Harper’s Bazaar .\n\nAli MacGraw rose to stardom in the late ’60s, achieving international fame starring in Love Story (1970). Kicking it off with the film Goodbye, Columbus (1969), she won the Golden Globe Award for Most Promising Newcomer. She’s also known for being married to pop culture icon Steve McQueen, although they divorced in 1978. He was her third husband. In a recent interview with People she said, after 31 years of sobriety, she wished she and McQueen had both grown old sober. He died in 1980.\n\nCher\n\nKnown for: “I Got You Babe”\n\nNet worth: $360 million\n\nIt’s hard to say whether Cher is more successful as a singer or as an actress. She’s definitely a master of reinvention. The come-back-kid has hit bottom in the industry only to bounce back with another hit. She’s the only recording artist with a No. 1 hit song spanning across six consecutive decades. She’s one of the best-selling musical artists of all time, and she’s won an Emmy, an Academy Award, a Grammy and three Golden Globes. Cher got her start in show biz after meeting Sonny Bono as a teen. The Sonny and Cher show climaxed in 1965 with “I Got You Babe.” She was 19. In 1974, the marriage fell apart, and so did the gig. Cher would bounce back, obviously, like a bouncing ball, but at the time it seemed like the Cher show had gone kaput. Undeterred, the fashion maven rocked on. Her movie career exploded with her second film performance in Silkwood . Co-starring with Meryl Streep, Cher won a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actress and was nominated for an Academy Award for the same category.\n\nShe’s a pop culture icon who's impossible to pin down. A new Broadway musical called The Cher Show attempts to do just that. The script provides three “Chers.” They call her: Babe Cher, Lady Cher, and Star Cher. Cher supports many causes. From humanitarian organizations to medical charity groups, she’s been an activist throughout her career. She’s the spokesperson for Keep a Child Alive organization, a program that helps children and families with HIV/AIDS. She’s also involved with Habitat for Humanity and Operation Helmet. She won the GLAAD Vanguard Award for her work supporting rights for gays and lesbians. Her daughter, Chaz Bono, who is now her son, transitioned from lesbian to transgender.\n\nWarren Beatty\n\nKnown for: Reds and Bonnie and Clyde\n\nNet worth: $70 million\n\nHe made his film debut in Splendor in the Grass starring opposite Natalie Wood. Warren Beatty has a certain staying power, an omnipresence in Hollywood, an evergreen appeal. He could be the leading man at any age. Yet he’s not your average sex-symbol. He’s simply an unassuming and extraordinarily attractive man. True, male leads have a much longer shelf life, but let’s not digress. Starring in and producing film classics like Reds , Shampoo , Dick Tracy , Bonnie and Clyde , Heaven Can Wait and Bugsy , Beatty’s recognized for those 20th-century staples.\n\nAfter turning the role down for literally decades, in recent years Beatty finally agreed to portray Howard Hughes. But not for Warner Bros. who had been asking him to do it since the ’70s. Instead, Beatty co-produced, wrote, directed and starred in the 2016 film Rules Don’t Apply. Alec Baldwin, Matthew Broderick, Martin Sheen and his wife Annette Benning also starred. His opus Reds not only earned him a Best Director Academy Award, but also a personal gift of a box of cigars from Cuba’s Fidel Castro. Another role he turned down, two times--once for Oliver Stone, and once for Ron Howard—is Richard Nixon. Beatty refused because he thought the scripts were not compassionate enough. He admits being on Nixon’s former enemy list, but he has grown to feel sympathetic toward the ousted President.\n\nPaula Prentiss\n\nKnown for: The Stepford Wives\n\nNet worth: $8 million\n\nIn the 1960s Paula Prentiss was known as a comedic talent after starring in comedies like, Where the Boys Are and What’s New Pussycat? She teamed up with romantic-comedy co-star Jim Hutton for several similar films. She was loved as a comedian, although her talent for drama won acclaim as well. Especially in The Stepford Wives , a film that resonates today as a cult classic. She starred opposite big names like Steve McQueen and Rock Hudson.\n\nShe earned an Emmy nomination when she co-starred with her husband, Richard Benjamin, in the CBS sitcom He & She. The show only lasted a season, but their love has endured since 1961. They were married on October 26, 1961. The couple also appeared together in Catch-22.\n\nJeannie Berlin\n\nKnown for: The Heartbreak Kid\n\nNet worth: $2 million\n\nJeannie Berlin calls her mother, actor/playwright/director Elaine May, her favorite acting mentor, and closest friend. In 1972, Berlin earned a Golden Globe and an Oscar nomination for her comedic performance in Elaine May’s comedy The Heartbreak Kid .\n\nBerlin appeared in 1970s movies Getting Straight , The Strawberry Statement , Portnoy’s Complaint, and Sheila Levine is Dead and Living in New York . In the latter, she played the lead. In television, she appeared in the series Columbo . With a decent comeback, Berlin has starred recently in Thomas Pynchon’s ’60s throwback adaptation, Inherent Vice (2014). She starred in Margaret , as well as Woody Allen’s Café Society .\n\nRobert Duvall\n\nKnown for: The Godfather , The Apostle and Lt. Col. Kilgore\n\nNet worth: $70 million\n\nAnother iconic film legend is Robert Duvall. He delivered one of the most definitive lines of the Vietnam era. The mythic phrase was victoriously belted out by the ruthless Lt. Col. Kilgore in Apocalypse Now (1979): “I love the smell of Napalm in the morning!” The war may have ended in 1975, but Duvall’s line lives on. The ’70s were prolific for Duvall, primarily in the production of malicious characters we love to hate. In The Godfather and The Godfather Part II, the phenomenal character-actor played the attorney for the Corleone mafia family. That role in Francis Ford Coppola’s classic mob film earned him an Academy Award nomination.\n\nIn MASH he played the vicious Major Frank Burns, and on Network he played the repugnant television executive Frank Hackett. He even played the contemptible Josef Stalin in Stalin. It’s his comedic nuances, the way he inserts a bit of humor into the bad guys that make his portrayals so epic. Are we surprised he was considered for Dr. Hannibal Lecter? Out of seven Oscar nominations, he was awarded an Oscar for Best Actor in Tender Mercies. Duvall’s big breaks included appearing on The Twilight zone and making his screen debut in To Kill a Mockingbird. His career has spanned six decades. And at 84, he became the oldest actor ever to receive an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor.\n\nLinda Blair\n\nKnown for: The Exorcist\n\nNet worth: $16 million\n\nLinda Blair starred in The Exorcist , one of the all-time scariest movies. Playing a possessed demon child, the success of the classic 1973 horror film catapulted the child model and actress to international fame. She was just 14 years old when she won a Golden Globe Award and an Oscar nomination for the performance. She also won several roles and starred in Born Innocent and Airport 1975 . In Born Innocent , she played a sexually abused runaway teenager. The National Organization for Women and other organizations protested it for its depiction of female-to-female sexual abuse.\n\nFame wasn’t easy for Blair. A drug bust at 18 found her blacklisted in Hollywood. She managed it with B-movies. The experience produced lead roles in two cult classics. Chained Heat is a 1983 women-in-prison flick, and Savage Streets is an action movie in which she portrayed a vigilante femme fatale. In 2006, she showed up on the CW hit series Supernatural. She also hosted the 2000 Fox TV series, The Scariest Places on Earth.\n\nJami Gertz\n\nKnown for: The Lost Boys\n\nNet worth: $2 billion\n\nJami Gertz was discovered as a child actor who landed roles on epic 1970s sitcoms like Diff’rent Strokes and The Facts of Life . After studying drama at NYU, she began picking up significant parts in substantial films like Less Than Zero and The Lost Boys . Another blockbuster she starred in was Twister . She landed Crossroads and Jersey Girl also.\n\nGertz played that girl who wouldn’t share even “one square” of toilet paper with Elaine on Seinfeld. She could have played that girl Rachel Green on Friends but passed up the part. She did play Judy Miller on TV sitcom Still Standing. In 1989, Jami Gertz married executive Antony Ressler. Her billionaire hubby is a co-founder of a multi-billion-dollar private equity firm. The couple part-owns the MLB Milwaukee Brewers team. It’s not all fun and games. In 2012, Gertz and Ressler have named the #1 Most Generous Celebrities in the world, and in 2010, they were the top-donor of any celebrity couple.\n\nHarrison Ford\n\nKnown for: Star Wars and Indiana Jones\n\nNet worth: $230 million\n\nStar Wars . Raiders of the Lost Ark . Two of the best movies of the Seventies and Eighties. Respectively. The mass appeal of those two mega-franchises made Harrison Ford one of the most in-demand actors ever (practically inventing the concept of a movie franchise, alongside George Lucas, in the process). Five of his flicks are all-time box office top-grossing films. The man’s a legend. Every dude wanted to be cool like him. Every gal swooned in the presence of the silver screen king. A collective sigh released when Princess Leia finally broke the romantic tension by kissing him in The Empire Strikes Back .\n\nAll this has led to substantial net worth. However, Ford had all but quit acting to support his wife and kids by becoming a carpenter when he got set up with George Lucas. It started with American Graffiti and climaxed with the mega-franchises Star Wars and Indiana Jones. It was like a godsend collaborating with Lucas. When he landed Han Solo on Star Wars, who knew he’d become an American demigod? The friendship of Hans and Chewbacca remains one of the most indelible memories of any summer movie release.\n\nKurt Russell\n\nKnown for: Silkwood\n\nNet worth: $70 million\n\nConstant lover and forever companion to knock-out Goldie Hawn, Kurt Russell is a strapping gent who once had a shot at a professional baseball career. Sidelined by a torn rotator cuff, his showbiz career went front and center. Russell was busy as a youngster. He’s one of those rare childhood stars who survive in the industry to enjoy a lucrative film career. He landed one of his first roles in the Elvis Presley movie, It Happened at the World’s Fair (1963) when he was eleven. In 1966, he starred in a Disney TV show. He met his future love, 21-year-old Goldie, on another film set, but at 16, he was a little young. It should be no surprise that he was voted “Best Looking” by the Class of 1969 at Thousand Oaks High School.\n\nHe found his way into several box office hits. In the Seventies and Eighties, Russell starred in amazing hits like Silkwood and Overboard . He played Lt. Bull McCaffrey in the hugely popular firefighter movie, Backdraft . Wyatt Earp, in Tombstone , was also a very popular role. And he’s well-loved in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.2 and the Stargate franchise. Goldie and Kurt share a double star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The honor was celebrated at the May 2017 ceremony.\n\nAnjelica Huston\n\nKnown for: Prizzi’s Honor and Witches\n\nNet worth: $50 million\n\nAs a deity of the Hollywood pantheon, Anjelica Huston was born and raised into stardom, Santa Monica, California, to be specific, the heart of it all. She is the daughter of ballerina Enrica Soma and actor John Huston. Her career would find her in a long-term relationship with the singular Jack Nicholson and married to renowned sculptor Robert Graham until he died in 2008. But it’s her distinctively striking beauty—severe and self-confident—with raven-black hair that sets her apart.\n\nWinning the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for Prizzi’s Honor (1985) made her a third-generation Oscar-winner in the Huston family. The film was directed by her father and starred Jack Nicholson. She received BAFTA nominations for Crimes and Misdemeanors and Manhattan Murder Mystery, both Woody Allen films. And in Witches, portraying the Grand High Witch from Roald Dahl’s well-loved children’s book, earned her another round of acclaim. She was also loved in The Addams Family as Monica Addams.\n\nLynda Carter\n\nKnown for: Wonder Woman\n\nNet worth: $10 million\n\nThe Seventies would not have been the Seventies without Wonder Woman. Lynda Carter brought the D.C. Comic title to life playing the first-ever female superhero on TV. Her original performance of the character captivated audiences for three glorious seasons. Advancement for women? Yes! As a mythical enforcer of justice, Wonder Woman was not only beautiful but important too. Secretly known as Diana Prince, Wonder Woman was the embodiment of goodness as well.\n\nLife before Wonder Woman found Lynda Carter struggling to make it in showbiz. Winning Miss World USA helped. Music was her first interest. She toured with a band playing quite a few gigs until she became disenchanted with the idea. She won beauty contests instead. Today she has a multi-million-dollar net worth. Then, however, she had only $25 left in her bank account when she got the call that landed the Wonder Woman role. Carter is a spokesman for irritable bowel syndrome due to her mom’s affliction, a staunch advocate for Susan G. Komen for the Cure, a Pro-Choice rights activist for women, a backer for legal equality for LGBT people, and she advocates for alcoholism recovery. She has been sober for 20 years.\n\nMorgan Freeman\n\nKnown for: Driving Miss Daisy and Shawshank Redemption\n\nNet worth: $200 million\n\nSeated high on the pantheon of Hollywood greats is the revered Morgan Freeman. Immortalized as a film legend in Driving Miss Daisy , his heartwarming performance as Miss Daisy’s gentle chauffeur earned him an Academy Award nomination.\n\nFreeman’s dream was to be an actor. He moved to N.Y.C. to follow it. Working odd jobs and doing some dancing and musical theatre, he gradually made it in showbiz. It took decades of dreaming before he hit it big in 1987 with Street Smart. The acclaim for his role Fast Black was phenomenal, and he considers it his breakthrough part. Some of Freeman’s charity work is dedicated to disaster aid, especially in Grenada after the 2004 hurricane. He’s concerned about environmental issues and raises awareness. One issue is the declining bee problem. Beekeeping is a way he helps give back to help solve the problem.\n\nJean Simmons\n\nKnown for: The Happy Ending\n\nNet worth: $12 million\n\nBritish film star, Jean Simmons, found fame in 1946 starring in a film version of Great Expectations . Her role as young Estella invited rave reviews. It opened doors. After several roles in decent movies, she hit the big one—playing Ophelia in Laurence Olivier’s Hamlet . It earned her an Oscar nomination.\n\nVoted fourth-most popular star in Britain, she became a 1950s Golden Age Hollywood star with King Solomon’s Mines. It scored her an MGM contract. Relocating to L.A., she hooked up with Howard Hughes who acquired her contract. Androcles and the Lion was her first Hollywood production. Hughes could have treated Simmons better. She extricated herself from his contract after a court case. With 20th Century Fox she found leads in box-office hits The Robe and Désirée. She starred with Marlon Brando as Napoleon Bonaparte. Simmons received her second Oscar nomination for The Happy Ending (1969). She’s remembered in Guys and Dolls and Spartacus. The actress struggled with addiction and spoke out publicly to support others. She became a patron of the British drugs and human rights charity. Just days before her 81st birthday in January 2010, Simmons died from lung cancer.\n\nJohn Kapelos\n\nKnown for: The Breakfast Club\n\nNet worth: $1.1 million\n\nJohn Kapelos played Carl, the shady but comical school janitor in The Breakfast Club . It’s not the only John Hughes movie we remember him from. He also appeared in Sixteen Candles and Weird Science .\n\nThe 1980s character-actor appeared in 1990s movies as well. One of his best was The Deep End of the Ocean (1999) which received acclaim from Roger Ebert and The New York Times. He starred in Roxanne with Daryl Hannah and Steve Martin and Nothing in Common with Tom Hanks. In television, he’s appeared on Miami Vice, Queer as Folk, Desperate Housewives and The X-Files. Currently, he teaches acting and improv classes at the AIA Studios. He also manages his independent record label, Carpuzi Records.\n\nKevin Bacon\n\nKnown for: Footloose\n\nNet worth: $30 million\n\nKevin Bacon was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. When he was a kid, he wanted to be a pop star. At age 17 he left home for the Big Apple looking to make it there (because if you make it there, you can make it anywhere). As a high school student, he developed a passion for the arts and wanted to become a serious actor. In N.Y.C. he found some theatre gigs and a big role in the slasher horror flick Friday the 13th . Things were picking up. He debuted on Broadway with Sean Penn and Val Kilmer. He played “Chip” in the classic frat house comedy, National Lampoon’s Animal House . Soon, he landed the monster smash hit, Footloose and became a pop star.\n\nHe’s starred in JFK, A Few Good Men, Apollo 13, and Mystic River, to name a few blockbusters. He won a Golden Globe Award and a SAG for Taking Chance, an HBO original movie. In 2007 he founded a charitable organization called SIxDegrees.org, based on the trivia game and subsequent meme, Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon.\n\nAnthony Hopkins\n\nKnown for: The Silence of the Lambs\n\nNet worth: $160 million\n\nSir Anthony Hopkins, knighted in 1993 by the late Queen Elizabeth, yet terrifies us by his horrifying portrayal of Dr. Hannibal Lecter. Decades on, a mere thought of the psychological mastermind sends shudders of fright down one’s spine. Hopkins’ depiction of that mad serial slayer (or is it “splayer”?) is an immortal fixture in the halls of American cinema, never mind that it was brought to us by a man from Wales. His accent only made him sound more terrifying. Suffice it to say he won the Academy Award for Best Actor.\n\nHopkins’ acting career began many years before he starred with Jodie Foster in that iconic 1991 horror film. He studied stage acting under the renowned Sir Laurence Oliver until he transitioned to television in 1967. He played an impressive Richard I in a 1968 movie called The Lion in Winter. It was nominated for Best Picture and starred Katherine Hepburn as well. It got him noticed. He starred in The Remains of the Day, The Elephant Man and The Hunchback of Notre Dame.\n\nSally Kellerman\n\nKnown for: M*A*S*H*. and Major “Hot Lips”\n\nNet worth: $2 million\n\nM*A*S*H is an Indispensable 1970s television series. But without the award-winning1970 film about the medical personnel who manned the 4077th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital in the Korean War, there may never have been that decade-long bestowal to television.\n\nSally Kellerman dazzled audiences as Margaret “Hot Lips” Houlihan, a severe Korean War nurse in M*A*S*H*. Her performance as head nurse of the 4077th earned an Academy Award nomination and a Golden Globe nomination for Best Supporting Actress. In other awards, she won the Golden Laurel for Best Comedy Performance. The film jump-started her career, although she turned down a bulk of the roles in order to focus on her singing career. She signed a contract with Verve Records and dated Grand Funk Railroad rocker Mark Farner, but we remember her best in movies like Welcome to L.A., The Player, Prêt-à-Porter and in her Twilight Zone roles.\n\nElton John\n\nKnown for: “Rocket Man” Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, “Tiny Dancer,” “Candle in the WInd” and Lion King\n\nNet worth: $500 million\n\nThe Seventies and Eighties unofficial mascot, Elton John, defined the era with his songs, by the clothes he wore and with his flamboyant array of eyeglasses. At age four he picked up piano. By the 1970s the pop music icon released seven consecutive No. 1 albums in the United States. It’s practically unprecedented. Sir Elton John and songwriter Bernie Taupin met through a weekly newspaper ad. They were 20 and 17 when they met, respectively, and their union of piano and lyric created almost 400 songs in the decades since. Before the serendipitously epic collaboration, John played in a band called Bluesology.\n\nHe’s won every major award: A Grammy, a Tony, an Academy and a Golden Globe. His song “Circle of Life” in The Lion King film won him an Academy Award for Best Original Song. The soundtrack included other sensational hits like “Hakuna Matata” and “Can You Feel the Love Tonight,” making him a smash hit of the 1990s as well. He produced Gnomeo & Juliet, the precious animated kids' film featuring his tunes. Of all the iconic media the 1980s produced, one element of the decade stands out in a terrible contrast, the AIDS epidemic. People were dying, mysteriously at first. When the epidemic came into its full, terrifying light, the research was shocking. Having unprotected sex and other fluid transfer causes it, and there is no cure. The diagnosis was a death sentence. Elton John says he risked having unprotected sex in the ’80s and realizes now he is lucky to be alive. With friends dying around him, he lived to support the cause of AIDS eradication. After his friend Freddie Mercury died in 1991, John founded the Elton John AIDS Foundation.\n\nLiza Minnelli\n\nKnown for: Cabaret\n\nNet worth: $50 million\n\nBorn in Hollywood to Judy Garland and director Vincente Minnelli, Liza Minnelli befell a charmed life. She was fourteen months old when she debuted in the film on In the Good Old Summertime (1949). At sixteen, when she was trying to make it on her own in N.Y.C., she received some recognition for the play “Best Foot Forward.” But it was when her mother invited her to sing with her at a show at the London Palladium when serious recognition bumped her career. Shows sold out, audiences adored the mother/daughter duo, and it was announced to the world that Liza was coming-of-age with her own talents.\n\nAt nineteen, Liza won a Tony, and at 23 she was nominated for an Academy Award playing Pookie Adams in The Sterile Cuckoo. Her greatest performance was saved for Cabaret. Liza won an Oscar, a BAFTA, and a Golden Globe for her performance as Sally Bowles. The Seventies were very busy for the pop star. Her stage duets with Frank Sinatra were well-loved. But it was in Scorsese’s, New York, New York where she so memorably shined with her signature song.\n\nJon Bon Jovi\n\nKnown for: Bon Jovi\n\nNet worth: $410 million\n\nJon Bon Jovi, lead singer of the New Jersey rock band Bon Jovi, is a staple of the 1980s. Without his songs “Bad Medicine,” “Livin’ on a Prayer,” and “You Give Love a Bad Name” wafting through the airwaves, would the Eighties have been the Eighties? Well, let’s not get too philosophical. The band formed in 1983 and became a super-pop-sensation from the hard rock/metal genre. Their third album Slippery When Wet was a worldwide smash hit selling 20 million copies. In all, the band released 14 studio albums and have been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall Of Fame and the U.K. Music Hall of Fame.\n\nJon Bon Jovi branched out into a solo career and in movies and television shows. He made appearances in Sex and the City and The West Wing. Bon Jovi is also recognized for his charitable endeavors. With too many causes to list, he formed his own foundation, The Jon Bon Jovi Soul Foundation, and helps out with Habitat for Humanity, the Special Olympics, the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation, and has raised money for Oprah’s charity.\n\nStevie Nicks\n\nKnown for: Fleetwood Mac and “Landslide”\n\nNet worth: $75 million\n\n“At the ripe and totally young age of 70,” as Ms. Nicks puts it, she became the first woman inducted twice into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. This time the rock icon entered the reverent Hall as a soloist. Fleetwood Mac was enshrined in 1998. Between the two, Stevie Nicks and Mac have over 40 chart-topping singles. Stevie Nicks is one of the best-selling musical acts ever. Fleetwood Mac formed in 1967 and dominated the charts throughout the Seventies and Eighties.\n\nShe may be rock and roll royalty, but she looks just like an enchanted fairy goddess on stage. Ahead of long, flowing blonde locks frame her lovely face, waif-like. Donned in beguiling gowns that cascade around her, only the sound of her voice can compare. It’s hauntingly beautiful. Her 1975 “Landslide” song continues to be one of the most popularly covered songs in rock. Stevie wrote the song on the guitar while watching the snow falling in Aspen. It took her about five minutes.\n\nCicely Tyson\n\nKnown for: Sounder\n\nNet worth: $10 million\n\nDiscovered as a fashion model, Cicely Tyson shot to the top of the modeling profession with her strikingly beautiful and unique look. She found her way to the stage by 1957. Tyson got her foot in the door appearing on television programs like the miniseries movie Roots which was a 1970s national sensation. She was nominated for a Primetime Emmy for her work in Roots. In 1972, Tyson was nominated for an Academy Award and a Golden Globe Award for her role in the critically acclaimed movie Sounder .\n\nShe also appeared in acclaimed films like Fried Green Tomatoes and The Help. Miles Davis fell in love with Cicely Tyson. The world-renowned jazz musician photographed Tyson for his album, Sorcerer. They were married in 1981.\n\nMichael J. Fox\n\nKnown for: Family Ties and Back to the Future\n\nNet worth: $65 million\n\nBefore Michael J. Fox played Marty McFly, he was Alex Keaton on the wildly popular 1980s sitcom Family Ties . The Canadian-born actor played a hilarious young-Republican growing up in a throw-back hippie family. The show ran from 1982 to 1989. Fox won three Primetime Emmys and a Golden Globe for the role. In the midst of it, he starred in one of the most successful movies of all time. Back to the Future was a genre-smashing sci-fi adventure comedy with a franchise that has stretched over three decades producing a Trilogy, an attraction at Universal Studios, and an animated TV series.\n\nHe also won a Primetime Emmy, two SAGs and three Golden Globe Awards for his role on Spin City . During the filming of the 1991 romantic comedy Doc Hollywood , Fox noticed an uncontrollable twitch in his finger. When he went to the doctor, he learned of his Parkinson’s diagnosis. After the sad news, he founded The Michael J. Fox Foundation to help advance research on the debilitating disease.\n\nRob Lowe\n\nKnown for: The Outsiders and the “Brat Pack”\n\nNet worth: $60 million\n\nRob Lowe was catapulted to fame as a teen idol in the ’80s with the rest of the “Brat Pack.” The group starred in one insanely popular coming-of-age flick after another, truly defining a generation. Sixteen Candles , St. Elmo’s Fire , and, of course, The Breakfast Club featured these young men and women, most of whom became serious Hollywood legends in their own right. Our heartthrob, Mr. Lowe, ran into a dab of trouble on the way up, but he’s been recovering as an alcoholic for over two decades. Oh, and that sex-tape scandal-thing? Just think of it as a blip on the map that helped him hit his bottom.\n\nHe’s arguably more popular now than ever. His Twitter following is impressive, and fans love him on Parks and Recreation and Grinder. West Wing gave his career the lift it needed after Wayne’s World rescued him from the sex scandal thing. Lowe’s never shied away from politics. In fact, his first sex scandal incident occurred on the night before the 1988 DNC nomination of Michael Dukakis, a man he was endorsing at the convention. Operative word: “was.” Currently, he backs a Homeowners Defense Fund for government transparency in Santa Barbara and is a spokesman for the breast cancer awareness organization, Lee National Awareness Day.\n\nMichael Caine\n\nKnown for: Alfie and Dirty Rotten Scoundrels\n\nNet worth: $75 million\n\nBritish film icon Michael Caine was born in South London. As a young lad with a certain idealism about communism, he was sent off to fight during the Korean War. He returned to England loathing the ideology, hating combat, and searching for a new vocation. He decided to try his hand at theatre procuring a job as an assistant stage manager. More than 130 films later, Michael Caine is a master at his craft and holds the rare distinction of earning an Oscar nomination for five consecutive decades. Recognized by his cockney accent, his films have collectively grossed over $7.4 billion worldwide.\n\nCaine received his first Oscar nomination for playing a heartless heartthrob in Alfie. It cemented his Hollywood career, Gambit, Play Dirty and Get Carter followed. In the 1990s, Hannah and Her Sisters snagged him his first Oscar win. He played a respectable Scrooge in The Muppet Christmas Carol, and audiences liked him in the Batman trilogy as Alfred, the fatherly butler. As a rare conservative among the ranks of Hollywood liberals, Caine’s politics include a protest on paying taxes. He once left the U.K. until Margaret Thatcher cut the tax rate for top-earners.\n\nElliot Gould\n\nKnown for: M*A*S*H*\n\nNet worth: $20 million\n\nBrooklyn native Elliott Gould made his stage debut in 1962 starring in I Can Get it For You Wholesale. It was a significant time in his life as he starred in the Broadway musical with his future wife, Barbara Streisand. The recognition brought starring roles in Drat! The Cat! And Little Murders . By 1969 he formed his own film production company, and, more notably, signed a contract to play Trapper John in Robert Altman’s seminal film M*A*S*H* . It was a smashing hit.\n\nHe flopped with Move, and I Love My Wife, but then rebounded in The Long Goodbye. He played opposite Diane Keaton in both, I Will, I Will…for Now, and Harry and Walter Go to New York. More flops. His portrayal of an aging mobster in Warren Beatty’s Bugsy brought him showers of accolades. In American History X starring Edward Norton, Gould delivered a remarkable appearance. He’s hosted Saturday Night Live a total of six times and guest-starred on Friends. He and Barbara Streisand didn’t stay married. They divorced in 1971. He went on to marry and divorce Jennifer Bogart two times.\n\nCandy Clark\n\nKnown for: American Graffiti\n\nNet worth: $3 million\n\nAt 18, Candy Clark moved to N.Y.C. to become a fashion model. The sky was the limit. When she landed a starring role in the raucous rock ‘n roll coming-of-age movie American Graffiti (1973) she worked with budding Hollywood legends, George Lucas and Francis Ford Coppola. That year, Screen World declared her one of the most promising movies stars in the industry. She turned out to be more like a one-hit-wonder. Well, two.\n\nIt was an exciting time. By 1975, Clark and Jeff Bridges hooked up and shared a pad for a couple of years. In 1976, she fell in love with director Nicolas Roeg when they were filming his stellar project The Man Who Fell to Earth. Clark starred in the movie and famously played David Bowie’s part the day he was too ill to film.\n\nChristopher Walken\n\nKnown for: The Deer Hunter\n\nNet worth: $50 million\n\nChristopher Walken snagged his first showbiz gig as a circus lion tamer when he was 16. Next, he liked to dance, so he trained as a dancer before moving on to stage performance. He broke into showbiz proper as a stage actor in an off-Broadway musical starring alongside Liza Minnelli. The next thing he knew, he was starring opposite Sean Connery in The Anderson Tapes .\n\nWalken played the deranged and homicidal brother of Annie (Diane Keaton) in Woody Allen’s Annie Hall. He would develop a catalog of similar character roles. He won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor playing a psychologically unstable steelworker returning home from Vietnam in The Deer Hunter. Walken starved himself for a week to develop a gaunt appearance for the role. He’s played epic villains, most memorably in Batman Returns and as James Bond’s villain, Max Zorin. However, George Lucas considered casting Walken as good-guy Han Solo and he played Madonna’s guardian angel in her “Bad Girl” music video. He’s also loved for his seven SNL appearances. He’s responsible for delivering the epic, “I gotta have more cowbell” line.\n\nCyndi Lauper\n\nKnown for: “Girls Just Wanna Have Fun,” Kinky Boots, and LGBTQ+ Activism\n\nNet worth: $30 million\n\nPop music superstar Cyndi Lauper “be-bopped” herself into a spectacular career. Suffice it to say you cannot find an ‘80s mixtape without at least one track rocking her distinctively pitched voice. “Time After Time,” “Girls Just Wanna Have Fun” and “True Colors” played on heavy rotation throughout the decade. She won Best New Artist at the 1985 Grammy Awards and Best Female Music Video at the 1984 MTV Music Awards (“Girls Just Wanna Have Fun”). As a self-proclaimed misfit—her hair’s different, her voice is different, her sweet and honest nature is a bit of an aberration in the rock world—she somehow fits in.\n\nLauper is a rare talent. She’s one of very few singers who have won an Emmy, a Tony and a Grammy. Her role on the sitcom, Mad About You, earned her an Emmy and her music and lyrics for the Broadway musical, Kinky Boots, won a Tony. Raised in Queens by a single mom, she struggled to make it, at times living on the streets as a young adult. Maybe that is why she is one of the most compassionate people. She wrote the song “True Colors” for her good friend Gregory who died of AIDs. The loss inspired her to dedicate her life to helping the gay and lesbian community. Today she’s a leading advocate for LGBTQ+ people’s rights. Her organization, True Colors United, seeks to end homelessness, emphasizing youth homelessness. She founded it in 2012 after she learned that 40 percent of homeless youth identify as LGBT.\n\nMatt Dillon\n\nKnown for: The Outsiders and There’s Something About Mary\n\nNet worth: $40 million\n\n“Brat Pack” tough guy Matt Dillon arose from The Outsiders a national teen idol. Along with the rest of the club, his career was catapulted to new heights. His film debut in Over the Edge , though it was not widely screened, got him known as an edgy, cool dude. The 1979 movie is hip again with a fervent retro cult following.\n\nHe starred in My Bodyguard, Rumble Fish, and The Flamingo Kid. He played the cute lead in a lot of movies. In Gus Van Sant’s crime drama, Drugstore Cowboy, he plays an addict on the search for drugs. One of his most memorable comedy roles is “Pat” in There’s Something About Mary. He’s still acting! In 2018 he starred in The House that Jack Built. He won an Independent Spirit Award and a Golden Globe nomination for Crash. He received a Grammy nomination for Best Spoken Word Album having narrated the inveterate Jack Kerouac’s, On the Road.\n\nCarol Kane\n\nKnown for: Hester Street and Wicked\n\nNet worth: $5 million\n\nCarol Kane took on theatre as a child growing up in N.Y.C. She continued to study acting at the prestigious HB Studio until making her theatrical debut in the 1966 production of The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie . She played a teenager who was raped and left pregnant in the WWII Wedding in White when she was 20 years old. Kane received an Academy Award nomination for her performance in the independent film, Hester Street (1975), leaving people agreeably surprised.\n\nKane received two Emmys and a Golden Globe nomination for her work on Taxi. She appeared on the television series from 1980 to 1983. The Princess Bride and Scrooged from the late ’80s garnered her plenty of attention. To all kinds of acclaim, she played Madame Morrible. Her face is recognized everywhere as the evil headmistress in the insanely popular Wicked Broadway musical. She premiered with the original tour on March 9, 2005.\n\nAnthony Michael Hall\n\nKnown for: Sixteen Candles and The Breakfast Club\n\nNet worth: $8 million\n\n“Brat Pack” go-to geek Anthony Michael Hall starred in most of John Hughes’ blockbusters, beginning with National Lampoon’s Vacation playing one of Chevy Chase’s kids. Hughes kept him in mind for Sixteen Candles , The Breakfast Club and Weird Science . But Hall, who has a slight resemblance to future tech-geek Mark Zuckerberg, turned down roles Hughes wrote for him in Ferris Bueller’s Day Off and Pretty in Pink . (Enough with the typecast!)\n\nOf the “Brat Pack” experience, Hall said, “I had the time of my life.” However, as with many of our iconic child actors from the Eighties, Hall took a two-year break to deal with a drinking problem. He returned to screen with Johnny Depp and Winona Ryder in Edward Scissorhands playing a villain. Six Degrees of Separation was another box office hit. One of Hall’s charitable efforts includes assisting at-risk youth by offering literacy programs. His initiative offers an opportunity to learn literacy in films, music, lyrics, scriptwriting, and novels.\n\nGeneviève Bujold\n\nKnown for: Anne of a Thousand Days\n\nNet worth: $2 million\n\nAt 71 Geneviève Bujold said, “I am incapable of doing things I don’t want to do. I live modestly, so that I’m never forced to do a job to pay a mortgage, and I don’t own anything.” Her point being, “All the external decorations are less important than giving yourself the gift of time.”\n\nCanadian-born Bujold spent her childhood in Montreal’s Hochelaga Convent. It was a stifling experience. She finally got kicked out after getting caught reading an unapproved novel. She became a stage actress and then a French film actress. When she played Anne Boleyn in Anne of the Thousand Days in 1969, her performance was so spectacular she won a Golden Globe for Best Actress and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress. It was her American film debut. She went on to do other American movies like Earthquake, Coma and Dead Ringers.\n\nCloris Leachman\n\nKnown for: The Last Picture Show and Young Frankenstein\n\nNet worth: $21 million\n\nThis actress/comedian is best known for her hilarious role as Phyllis Lindstrom on The Mary Tyler Moore show. Her Phyllis character was so popular Leachman went on to do her very own spin-off sitcom called Phyllis. She also appeared in the Mel Brooks film Young Frankenstein and continued to work with Brooks for many years.\n\nOn television, she was known as Beverly in the wildly popular 1980s show The Facts of Life. In the film, she portrayed Granny in The Beverly Hillbillies (1993). Leachman set a record winning eight Primetime Emmy Awards. She also won a Golden Globe Award for her portrayal of Phyllis. Her performance in The Last Picture Show earned an Oscar. Her last role was performed in the 2018 movie I Can Only Imagine, a Christian-themed movie based on the pop-sensation song of the same title. She was born in Des Moines, Iowa on April 30, 1926. She grew up in Des Moines and lived there until she attended Illinois State to study drama, and then graduated from Northwestern University. She started her film career soon after, but not before winning Miss America in 1946.\n\nDrew Barrymore\n\nKnown for: E.T.\n\nNet worth: $125 million\n\nDrew Barrymore was born into Hollywood stardom. Almost every member of her family has showbiz creds. Her godfather, for example, is none other than Steven Speilberg. He’s also director E.T. , but no one could have predicted the rebellious ’80s teen icon she would become. She was so damn cool that Kurt Cobain and Courtney Love asked her to be the godmother of their baby daughter, Frances Bean Cobain. And she’s still wildly popular, agelessly appealing to each new generation.\n\nDespite being born to Hollywood royalty, no one could have predicted she would star in the highest-grossing film of the 1980s. Fame doesn’t come without its problems. Childhood actors are doubly cursed. For Drew Barrymore, superstardom landed her in drug and alcohol rehab by age 13. She was nine the first time she got drunk, at Rob Lowe’s birthday party, incidentally. Shortly thereafter, she was a regular at the club scene. (The hedonistic Eighties were kind of a crazy decade). She’s lucky she survived to adulthood. The fact that she’s been one of the most prolific and continuously working stars in the business, is another blessing. Drew has a philanthropic heart and has supported a wide variety of charitable organizations. Fighting hunger is one. After being named Ambassador Against Hunger for the U.N. World Food Programme, Barrymore donated $1 million to the cause.\n\nPam Grier\n\nKnown for: Jackie Brown and Coffy\n\nNet worth: $10 million\n\nPam Grier was the queen of the early 1970s Blaxploitation movies. Women in Cages and The Big Dollhouse featured her lively character roles, making her the first African American to play an action hero. In Coffy , Grier plays a vigilante taking out justice on a coke dealer for addicting her sister. Black Mama, White Mama is another Blaxploitation film of Grier’s. Like a 1970s version of Orange Is the New Black , this movie takes place at a women’s prison on a fictional tropical island. Though Blaxploitation sounds bad, it had elements of black power and women’s power. The film style went out with the 1970s.\n\nMiami Vice was a crazy-popular hit TV series that ran during the heart of the Eighties, from 1985 to 1989. Pam Grier became a regular on the show. It’s difficult to explain its mass appeal like it would be difficult to explain the mass appeal of PewDiePie in 30 years. Miami Vice featured Don Johnson, a hunk of a private detective with slicked-back hair in a slick white-white suit wearing designer shades and a Rolex watch—totally ’80s—and, at his fingertips, an ever-ready, even more slick, gleaming chrome handgun. Also in the 1980s, Grier played the evil Dust Witch in Ray Bradbury’s story, Something Wicked This Way Comes, a 1983 Disney production. In the 1990s, she was Jackie Brown. Quentin Tarantino’s crime-thriller was created as a direct nod to Blaxploitation films. Award nominations and an NAACP Image Award revived her career. Factoid: Pam Grier was the first black woman to appear on the cover of Ms. Magazine, 1975.\n\nRobert Redford\n\nKnown for: Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and The Sundance Film Festival\n\nNet worth: $170 million\n\nAs a kid growing up in the ’70s and ’80s, I distinctly recall a crowd-favorite potluck dessert called, “The Next Best Thing to Robert Redford.” He was more than a household name. He was a household heartthrob.\n\nRobert Redford began acting on Broadway and television, most notably in The Twilight Zone in 1962 and on Broadway in Neil Simon’s Barefoot in the Park . Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid made him a verifiable movie star. He followed it up in 1972 with Jeremiah Jones and in 1973 with two number one box office hits, The Way We Were and The Sting , making him No. 1 at the box office for three consecutive years. Capitalizing on his success, he championed environmental causes and founded the Sundance Institute for aspiring filmmakers. Today, the festival of the same name is one of the world’s most prominent film festivals. Politically, Redford actively supports environmentalism, Native American rights, and LGBT rights. He’s a trustee of The National Resources Defense Council, a nonprofit environmental group based in N.Y.C. He also backs the arts and supports various political causes and campaigns.\n\nRobert Downey Jr.\n\nKnown for: Less Than Zero\n\nNet worth: $300 million\n\nChild actor, Robert Downey, Jr. appeared in his first movie at age 5. On the rise with our pack of 1980s teen icons, he starred in John Hughes’ classic sci-fi comedy Weird Science. Downey peaked in the quintessential Gen X role from Less Than Zero (1987), the Eighties-era opus.\n\nIn Chaplin , a maturing Downey earned an Oscar nomination and won the BAFTA for Best Actor. Drug abuse problems derailed his career to a degree, but his comebacks, most significantly with Marvel, have erased any losses. He’s one of the highest-grossing actors in the world. Robert Downey, Jr., was born in Manhattan to a filmmaker father and an actress mother. Drugs and alcohol were everywhere growing up. His dad let him smoke pot at six. He played in amazing 1990s flicks like Natural Born Killers with Woody Harrelson, and Scent of a Woman with Al Pacino.\n\nJudd Nelson\n\nKnown for: The Breakfast Club\n\nNet worth: $8 million\n\nInveterate “Brat Packer” Judd Nelson debuted his bad-boy persona on The Breakfast Club. It came to life in 1985, when “Brat Pack” architect John Hughes’ totally ’80s flick hit the big screen rousing teen infatuation everywhere. The obsession mounted as another Hughes movie called, St. Elmo’s Fire , starring Nelson alongside Rob Lowe, Demi Moore and Andrew McCarthy opened. Sixteen Candles kicked off the frenzy over Hughes’ trademark style a year previous.\n\nJudd Nelson was raised in middle-class, Portland, Maine. He studied philosophy at the university, but after he graduated he took off to New York City for an acting career. Hitting it big was not what he expected. Reflecting back he is famously known to have said, “My Brat Pack buddies and I didn’t exactly handle celebrity very well. Success at an early age is far more difficult to handle than failure.”\n\nDebbie Harry\n\nKnown for: Blondie, “Rapture” and “Call Me”\n\nNet worth: $20 million\n\nBest known as Blondie, Debbie Harry shot to fame after the band of the same name came together. Straight out of the 1970s New York punk scene, Debbie Harry and all-girl band, the Stilettos, were rocking the stage in a downtown club in 1974 when Chris Stein discovered her. He was captivated. Together they formed Blondie. As lovers, bandmates and wonderful friends, they created a unique style of music that jolted the scene. Selling over 40 million albums, tunes like, “Atomic,” “The Tide is High,” “Heart of Glass” and “Call Me” continue to inspire generation after generation. Her song “Rapture” is considered the first rap song to hit number one on the charts.\n\nDebbie Harry actively promotes supporting women. In 1980, she hosted a tea party inviting all the prominent women musicians of the time. There weren’t many, but Chrissie Hynde and Siouxsie Sioux were there. The girls had a fabulous time. She’s memorialized by Andy Warhol. His acrylic and silkscreen ink portraits of her are considered one of Warhol’s most accomplished celebrity portraits. Today one print is worth over $6 million. When the pop icon sat for Warhol at The Factory she said, “He was the master of understatement.” The two met when they bumped into each other on Broadway and 13th Street.\n\nAlan Arkin\n\nKnown for: The Russians Are Coming, The Russians Are Coming\n\nNet worth: $15 million\n\nBrooklyn-born and L.A.-transplant, Alan Arkin, moved out West with his family when he was 11. His father lost his teaching job in the early 1950s for refusing to answer questions about his political affiliation. It was young Alan’s introduction to the “Red Scare.” Arkin loved music and played the guitar. In 1956, he co-wrote the famous “Banana Boat Song.” His fame would come later. Acting lessons began at age 10, and he hooked up with the Second City comedy and theatre troupe in the Sixties.\n\nIt happened in 1966 with The Russians Are Coming, The Russians Are Coming. His performance as a Soviet submariner earned him a Best Actor Oscar nomination. He was nominated again for The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter. He received a BAFTA and an Oscar for Best Actor in Little Miss Sunshine, cracking us up as a foul-mouthed grandpa. In TV he was recognized for his part in The Pentagon Papers with a Primetime Emmy and, more recently, he’s been nominated three times for Best Supporting Actor in The Kominsky Method, two SAGs, and one Golden Globe.\n\nJeff Bridges\n\nKnown for: The Last Picture Show and “The Dude”\n\nNet worth: $70 million\n\nBorn in Los Angeles to a silver screen family, Jeff Bridges quite literally grew up in Hollywood. As a child, he was in and out of studios and on and off film sets tagging along with his parents and older brother. Bridges had his big break with The Last Picture Show playing Duane Jackson in a coming-of-age role that earned him an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor. It typecast him as a clever slacker with a loose-cannon tendency that would find its climax as “The Dude” in The Big Lebowski , a pop-cult phenomenon.\n\nHe was also nominated for an Oscar in Starman, although his performance in Fearless is considered his best by some. Bridges has studied Buddhism and practice Transcendental Meditation. Politically, he supports ending childhood hunger. He was the spokesman for the No Kid Hungry campaign for Share Our Strength. He’s also a supporter of the environment and backs the Amazon Conservation Team.\n\nSarah Miles\n\nKnown for: Hope and Glory\n\nNet worth: $6 million\n\nSwinging Sixties performer, Sarah Miles is a BAFTA and Academy Award-nominated, English actress who remained in film until the early Seventies. It’s a wonder she was able to achieve such fame. As a child, she was unable to speak until the age of nine because of a stammer and struggled so desperately with dyslexia she was expelled from four different schools. Finally, at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA), she excelled and was nominated for the BAFTA Newcomer Award in 1962 in Term of Trial .\n\nShe won an Oscar nomination for her role in David Lean’s Ryan’s Daughter which was an adapted script from “Madame Bovary” set during the Easter Rebellion of 1916 in Ireland. Miles’ husband, screenwriter Robert Bolt, adapted the play. It was a high point for Miles. After divorcing Bolt, Miles’ career flatlined but then sparkled one last time with Hope and Glory (1987).\n\nTalia Shire\n\nKnown for: Rocky\n\nNet worth: $20 million\n\n“Adrian!” Yes, Talia Shire played Adrian, Rocky Balboa’s adoring girlfriend, in the most famous boxing movie of all time. But she also played Connie Corleone in The Godfather , another unbelievably epic movie.\n\nNotably, Shire was born a Coppola and is the sister to the godfather of film, Francis Ford Coppola. She earned an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress in The Godfather: Part II . For her moving portrayal of Adrian in Rocky , Shire won a boatload of accolades: The New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Supporting Actress, the National Board of Review Award for Best Supporting Actress, an Oscar nomination for Best Actress and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Drama.\n\nPeter Ostrum\n\nKnown for: Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory\n\nNet worth: $1 million\n\nChild actor, Peter Ostrum, took a very different path than some of his American counterparts. As a boy in the 1970s, he won the role of Charlie Bucket in Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory after being selected by talent scouts while performing with children’s theatre in Cleveland, Ohio. He was 12. The movie studio offered Ostrum a three-film movie contract once filming concluded. Ostrum turned it down. He credits the decision to having spared him the tough transition from child actor to adulthood.\n\nMaking the movie on the Munich set in West Germany set was a good experience. During the filming, he developed a close relationship with Gene Wilder (Willy Wonka). Ostrum considered going back to Hollywood for a showbiz career, but he never made the move. With the massive proceeds, he acquired a horse. It became his love and passion, ultimately leading to a career in veterinary medicine. Royalties are yet trickling in from the 1971 film.\n\nKim Basinger\n\nKnown for: The Natural and Batman\n\nNet worth: $40 million\n\nGrowing up as an extremely shy girl from Athens, Georgia, Kim Basinger managed to take on beauty contests and win the Junior Miss Georgia title. By the time she was 20, she was a top model appearing on the cover of every fashion magazine. But Basinger wanted more than a modeling career, so the Cover Girl moved to Hollywood.\n\nBreaking into TV, she landed parts on the groovy Charlie’s Angels series. She broke into the film industry with a role as a Bond girl. But it was Tim Burton’s box-office hit Batman that propelled her toward the stardom she sought. Notably, her role as a femme fatale in L.A. Confidential is univ"
