Her confession to police lands her in a convent that seems to be the perfect hiding shelter. Her stay with the nuns helps her and the sisters, quite literally, find their true voices. This is musical comedy at its most fun.\n\nTheatre Memphis does not endorse any third-party ticket sale site for the purchase of any ticket for admission to our productions or events. When purchasing through our website or box office, you will get the best price, best seat selection and guaranteed admission. Please be aware that if you are purchasing from a patron who is re-selling their ticket, we do require an actual, original hard copy ticket for admission. Make sure you get that ticket from them when you buy it. We are not able to change the name of the purchaser in our ticket system once it has been purchased."
