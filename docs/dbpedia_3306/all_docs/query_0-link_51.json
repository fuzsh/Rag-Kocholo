        "text": "This year’s spring musical at Southern Lehigh deals with two polar elements: nuns and comedy. “Sister Act” brings together these components to form a surprisingly wonderful musical.\n\n“There are a lot of strong female roles” director Mr. Matthew Wehr said. “It’s a lot of fun, but it’s also serious, too.”\n\n“Sister Act” originated as a comedy movie. It was released in 1992, but it was later adapted to a play to be performed on Broadway. The film was directed by Emile Ardolino and starred Whoopi Goldberg, Maggie Smith, and Harvey Keitel. “Sister Act” was immensely successful, grossing $231,605,150 total and is 1992’s eighth highest grossing film worldwide.\n\n“It’s a lot more modern, fun, and lively,” sophomore cast member Colette Curry said. “The audience will have an easy time relating [to the show] compared to the [shows] we’ve done in the past, like ‘Carousel’.”\n\nThe theater department will be performing the U.S. National Tour version of “Sister Act.” The story centers around Deloris Van Cartier, a lounge singer and girlfriend to gangster Curtis Jackson. After witnessing Curtis commit murder, she runs to the police and who put her in the witness protection program. She is taken to a convent where she hides herself as a nun under the name Sister Mary Clarence, and takes on the role of choir director, leading the group to fame and success.\n\n“It’s very serious at moments, but there’s still a lot of comic relief to balance it out,” junior cast member Anthony Campolei said.\n\n“Sister Act” is both similar and different from past productions. This year’s fall play “The Crucible,” also deals with religion. Last year’s musical “Carousel,” elaborated on more serious topics, such as death and redemption.\n\n“Sister Act” is an opportunity for the Southern Lehigh cast to take a break from heavy and disconsolate topics and to focus on the more cheerful side of theater.\n\n“Certainly ‘Sister Act’ is the opposite of ‘Carousel,’” Mr. Wehr said. “It’s very similar to ‘Shrek’ or ‘the Drowsy Chaperone.’ It’s more lighthearted.”\n\nThe show features senior Giuliana Augello as Deloris, senior Lexi Brown as Mother Superior, senior Daniel Zelenkofske as Lieutenant Eddie Souther, and senior Garrison Piel as Curtis Jackson.\n\n“I definitely think the theme of the play is to not judge a book by its cover,” Augello said.\n\n“I also feel like it deals a lot with acceptance of others,” Brown said."
