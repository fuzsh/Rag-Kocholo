        "text": "Body image dissatisfaction (BID), a discrepancy between a person's ideal body and their perceived body,1 is a strong predictor of a variety of undesirable outcomes, including disordered eating behaviors such as binge eating and binge eating disorder,2,3 depression,2,4,5 and low self-esteem.2,6 Women tend to show higher levels of BID than men, and more research has been conducted with women than with men.2 In fact, much of the literature on BID has been conducted on female adolescents, college students, or individuals with obesity seeking bariatric surgery,2,6,7 whereas body image in other populations, such as individuals with chronic medical illnesses such as multiple sclerosis (MS), has only recently begun to be examined.\n\nMultiple sclerosis frequently involves the development of physical and emotional changes, including loss of function or feeling in limbs, sexual dysfunction, cognitive dysfunction, and alterations in mood.8 These changes are likely to lead to changes in body image, or the way an individual perceives, thinks, or feels about their body,1 which may lead to BID. In addition, 30% to 54% of people with MS experience symptoms of depression,8 which has been shown to correlate strongly with BID.2\n\nHowever, there have been only three studies on BID in people with MS. The first study, published in 1985 by Halligan and Reznikoff,9 found that BID was highest soon after diagnosis, and it was unrelated to the extent of disability or depression. It is worth noting, however, that this study used projective measures of body image, which, according to the authors, had questionable validity. Projective measures are no longer used due to current literature supporting the higher accuracy of objective measures.10\n\nHalligan and Reznikoff's results were also contradicted by the results of a study in 1989 by Samonds and Cammermeyer.11 This study examined 20 men with MS and found that degree of disability correlated with body image in these men to the same extent that it correlated in college-aged men. However, this study is nearly 30 years old, includes only men, and uses old measures with limited generalization. More recently, a study conducted in 2011 in Austria by Pfaffenberger et al12 found that compared with controls, individuals with MS reported significantly worse body appraisal and more negative feelings about their bodies. The authors also found a positive correlation between higher depression and higher BID for people with MS. In addition to the small number of studies in this area, two of the three studies are old and contradict one another, and the third did not assess many factors that may influence BID in people with MS, such as symptom severity, classification of MS, and medication.\n\nAlthough there is little research on the impact of MS on BID, there has been some focus on the general effect of physical disability. Research examining the impact of physical disability may shed some light on the possible relationship between MS and BID. Research on acquired mobility disability (AMD) indicates that individuals with AMD seem to have body image comparable with their peers without AMD except that individuals with AMD showed increased body attention and perceived themselves to be less healthy.13 However, increased physical disability was related to higher BID in another study on women with physical disabilities related to spinal cord injuries and polio.14 Finally, a qualitative study of seven individuals with physical disabilities indicated the presence of BID related to these disabilities.15 Therefore, it is likely that MS and its physical changes would affect BID.\n\nBecause of the strong links between BID and poor health outcomes,2,6 it is important for clinicians to be able to determine risk factors in patients that may predispose them to BID and, therefore, poorer physical and mental health. The aims of this study were to explore levels of BID in patients with MS compared with community norms and to identify factors that predict BID in patients with MS, including both physical and psychological variables. If variables are found that predict BID, future research could explore the effectiveness of interventions targeted at improving body image and, consequently, other health outcomes in people with MS.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThis study explored the prevalence and correlates of BID in a sample of people with MS. Results indicated that, overall, people with MS do not show significant differences in BID from the general population. In addition, MS-related variables did not seem to affect MS in the sample overall. These results are in contrast to a previous study showing higher levels of BID in people with MS compared with the general population.12 This lack of significance may be due to sex differences or a small sample size.\n\nSpecifically, when BID was examined separately by sex it was found that men with MS showed significantly lower BID than the general population, whereas women showed a higher level of BID (although this difference was not statistically significant). Previous literature has established that women tend to have higher levels of BID than men,7 and the BSQ has been used primarily with women, who also compose the normative sample.18 Therefore, men in this study may show lower levels of BID not because they have MS but because they are male. In addition, a larger sample size would help determine whether the difference noted for women is nonsignificant due to low sample size or due to an actual lack of a relationship between having MS and higher BID.\n\nThe analyses examining group differences indicated similar findings to one another—variables previously shown in the general population to predict increased BID, such as higher BMI, increased depressive symptoms, and being female,1,3,4,7 also predicted higher BID in this sample. The relationship between higher depressive symptoms and higher BID is consistent with the study by Pfaffenberger et al.12 However, that study did not examine BMI or female sex as predictors of the extent of BID.\n\nIn the present study, the results of the independent-samples t tests and the hierarchical linear regression were identical except that stigma was a significant predictor only in the t tests, with more stigmatizing experiences predicting higher BID. The main factor affecting the difference in significance is likely sample size; a larger sample size may be required to detect the impact of stigma on BID when using a complex analysis such as hierarchical linear regression, which requires higher power and, thus, a larger sample size. The finding that higher stigma experience predicts increased BID is consistent with previous literature on the effects of weight stigma on BID24,25; however, to our knowledge, no previous studies have examined the effect on BID of generalized stigma or stigma related to neurologic conditions.\n\nThe lack of significance for the relationships between MS-related variables and BID is likely due to low power from a small sample size and relatively complex analyses. Although this finding would conflict with previous literature12 and with patient self-report, it is possible that MS and its related factors do not affect BID. In this study, T25FW performance showed very little difference between the group of individuals with moderate/marked concern and those with no/mild concern; in fact, although the difference is not significant, individuals with more BID actually performed the walk more quickly (mean, 7.0 vs 7.3 seconds). Both groups showed a mean time that would indicate a moderate impact of MS on daily life.26\n\nIt is also worth noting that many questions on the BSQ focus on body size and shape, with a tendency toward disliking larger size. A measure developed specifically for people with MS might more accurately measure BID in this population, as these individuals may experience BID due to losing weight or the physical changes associated with MS (eg, loss of function, changes in gait, muscle weakness/spasticity). Indeed, some literature has shown a lower average BMI in women with MS versus women without MS.27 Therefore, the lack of significance may also be due to the measure being developed for the general population versus specifically for people with MS.\n\nAlthough this study is important in its examination of a little-studied topic, it has several limitations. Factors shown in the literature to be related to BID, such as eating behaviors and self-esteem,2–6 were not examined. In addition, this study included a large number of individuals receiving infusion therapies, a sample that may not be typical of people with MS and may render the results ungeneralizable. The study also used a general measure of BID rather than an MS-specific measure. Although no MS-specific measure currently exists, it is likely that data on MS-specific BID concerns are lost due to this.\n\nIn conclusion, this study examined BID in people with MS, finding similar levels as in the general population. In addition, the relationships between the examined variables echoed what has been seen in previous literature examining individuals without MS. In this study, a few variables were found to predict higher BID, including higher BMI, stronger symptoms of depression, being female, and experiencing more stigma. However, additional studies on body image in people with MS are needed. Future studies should include larger sample sizes to reduce the possibility of lower power contributing to lack of significance. These studies could examine the effects of different types of stigma (eg, weight-related, mobility-related, speech-related) on BID in people with MS. Examining sex differences in a larger sample would also help clarify the potential interaction between MS diagnosis and sex. Future research could also examine mediators and moderators of the relationships among these variables to provide an even clearer picture. The end goals are to identify predictors of increased BID in people with MS and to develop interventions focused on ameliorating these factors. Given the research showing the negative impact of BID on health behaviors, depression, and quality of life, this is an important area for continued examination.\n\nPRACTICE POINTS\n\nBody image dissatisfaction (BID) is a concern in patients with MS, at least as much as in the general population.\n\nPrevious literature on the general population has shown that as BID increases, individuals have a greater likelihood of experiencing depression, poorer eating behaviors, and poorer adherence to treatment recommendations.\n\nWomen, individuals with higher body mass index, individuals with more severe depressive symptoms, and individuals experiencing more stigma are at increased risk for BID."
