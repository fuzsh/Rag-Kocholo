        "text": "The paper will refl ect upon the possible areas of impact of the specifi c category of immovable cultural heritage in the city of Pula, Croatia. The main goal of the research was to explore how the local historic urban environment, consisting of the historic urban core with the Roman Amphitheater and the fortitications and barracks in the former military zones could contribute to the sustainable development and quality of life of the local community. The analysis of European examples of good practice will demonstrate possible models of sustainable management and valorization of these specifi c categories of heritage, which could at the same time enhance the process of urban regeneration and social revitalization. Since culture, including heritage, presents the fourth pillar of sustainable development (UNESCO, 2013a), we have applied the concept of cultural economy, which implies sustainable development based on the strategic use of local culture, local resources and local participative democracy. Confronting global trends with local commitment to sustainable development, we set the hypothesis that sustainable heritage management, based on the strategic valorization of local cultural resources, could strenghten the identity and economy of the local community, create new jobs, increase the quality of life of local residents and the pleasure of visitors, improve the image and attract investors. Our research has shown that sustainable urban development should be based on the strategic use of the city’s more valuable assets, consisting of its unique cultural, historical and natural heritage: the oldest historic city core on the eastern coast of the Adriatic and specifi c cultural resources such as the Amphitheater, the Roman monuments, the nearby Brijuni islands and the legacy of the former Austrian main naval port with its powerful fortifi cation system. Keywords: cultural heritage, historic urban environment, sustainable development, Pula"
