Pula is located in Istria, Croatia and has a population of around 58,000 people. It is situated on hilly terrain along a protected harbor. Pula has a long history dating back over 3,000 years when it was first settled. It later became an important Roman colony. Throughout its history, Pula came under Venetian and Austrian rule before becoming part of Croatia. Today, Pula's economy relies on industry such as shipbuilding as well as tourism, which has grown significantly in recent decades thanks to its mild climate, natural beauty, and cultural attractions like Roman ruins. The city has good transportation connections by road, rail, sea and air.",
