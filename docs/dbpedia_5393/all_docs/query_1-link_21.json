        "text": "3. Issues affecting the quality of birth registration data\n\nThe accuracy of information contained in the draft birth entry is the responsibility of the informant(s), usually the mother, or both parents where the registration is a joint one outside marriage. Wilfully supplying false information may render the informant(s) liable to prosecution for perjury. There are also validation checks carried out by the registrar. Therefore, it is believed that in general the information supplied by the informant(s) is correct.\n\n3.1 Registration Online System\n\nIn November 2006, a pilot for a web-based Registration Online system for births and deaths (RON), commenced in five registration districts. This enabled registrars to record births, stillbirths and deaths online. Following the success of this pilot, RON was implemented in most register offices on 26 March 2007. However, due to significant performance problems, the system was suspended on 10 April 2007 resulting in around half of registrars reverting back to using the previous electronic system, Registration Service Software (RSS).\n\nFrom 8 May 2007, almost all register offices were submitting data electronically using either RON or RSS. Any remaining birth registrations that were held only on paper at register offices were later entered onto the RON system at the ONS, or by the local registration service. Once all the birth records were available electronically, a rigorous statistical quality assurance process was completed by the ONS.\n\nWork to improve the performance of RON continued throughout 2008. During this time a further 15 registration districts moved back onto RON. By the end of 2008, the percentage of registration districts using RON for birth and death registrations had reached 56%. In 2009, this system was being used for 88% of births recorded by registrars.\n\nThe RON system was fully rolled out on 1 July 2009 with all register offices using it to record births from this date. With the introduction of RON, it became possible to carry out some additional validation checks at the point of registration, such as validation of address and postcode.\n\nWhen RSS was used, then the registrar would complete a draft entry Form 309 (Annex A (PDF,117KB) for a live birth or Form 308 (Annex B (PDF,115KB) for a stillbirth. Using RON, registrars now complete a draft entry Form 309 (Annex C (PDF,115KB) for a live birth or Form 308 (Annex D (PDF,122KB) for a stillbirth.\n\n3.2 Imputing missing data\n\nUnder the Population (Statistics) Acts (PSA), certain confidential data items are collected at the registration of a birth. Sometimes these data items are missing and how these missing data have been handled has varied over the years.\n\nPrior to 2004, the missing values were imputed using donor values from the most recently processed complete record of similar characteristics to the incomplete record. Also, there was a particular problem in 1999.\n\nIn this year, the proportion of live birth registrations without PSA information received from one register office was higher than usual due to a combination of circumstances. The missing data on those records were imputed using a random sample of data for that area from the previous three years. This was a change from the usual method but was used to improve the quality of the imputations. Procedures were put in place, which means that such a problem is unlikely to recur. For further information about this see Section C.2 of the 1999 volume of FM1 Birth statistics.\n\nFrom 2004 to 2006, all imputed values for PSA data items were re-imputed using the Canadian Census Edit and Imputation System (CANCEIS). CANCEIS selects the most appropriate donor record from the entire annual dataset. This improved the distribution of imputed mothers' ages (especially in small areas) and the distributions for each of the other PSA data items.\n\nIn 2007, a new process was introduced to link live birth registrations to their corresponding NHS birth notification record. Some data items appear on both sources and often when an item is missing from the birth registration, it will be on the birth notification, allowing us to use that value instead of imputation. From 2007, this method was used when mother's date of birth was missing from the registration record but appeared on the notification. However, some remaining missing PSA data items were still imputed using CANCEIS as in previous years.\n\nFrom May 2012, imputation of missing data on the number of previous children was discontinued because the level of missing data was very low (the number of previous live-born children is missing on less than 0.9% of live births).\n\nFor 2013 to 2017 data, missing data items were no longer imputed using CANCEIS. If the mother's age was still missing after attempting to obtain the information from the birth notification, it was imputed using the most recently processed complete record of similar characteristics to the incomplete record. Similarly, if the second parent's age or the date of marriage or civil partnership was not given, a value for the duration of marriage was imputed from a similar record with completely stated and otherwise matching particulars.\n\nHowever, with the number of missing values being so low, it is debatable whether imputation is necessary; it changes some records and makes the methodology more complex, with minimal gain statistical quality (in this case) because so few values are missing. As a result, all imputation was discontinued in March 2018. The small number of records, where mother's, father's or second parent's age is missing will now be included in the counts for \"all ages\" in our tables but excluded from any age breakdowns This affects 2018 births data onwards.\n\n3.3 Changes to the Population (Statistics) Act\n\nAs well as expanding coverage of the previous children question to all women, the question changed slightly. Before May 2012, married women were asked only for births to current and previous husbands (even if they took place before the marriage), whereas after the change, all women are simply asked to provide information on all previous births.\n\nThe information provided by women on the number of previous live-born children they had when registering their most recent birth shows higher proportions of married women saying they have previous children than had been recorded prior to the change. More information can be found in this methodology article on Quality assurance of new data on birth registrations, as a result of changes to the Population (Statistics) Act – from May 2012 onwards.\n\n3.4 Coronavirus pandemic\n\nBirth registration services in England and Wales were temporarily suspended in March 2020 because of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. From June 2020, registration services restarted where it was safe to do so. Consequently, 2020 births registrations came in much later than in normal years with 42% arriving after 42 days (the usual legal limit). Delays in birth registrations continued in 2021 and 2022, with 26% and 13% respectively arriving after 42 days. We decided to strike a balance between timeliness and completeness, and we took the 2020 annual birth registrations dataset on 12 August 2021, the 2021 annual birth registrations dataset on 16 May 2022 and the 2022 annual birth registrations dataset on 18 April 2023.\n\nWe discuss registration delays and how they affect our statistics in more detail in Births in England and Wales explained: 2020. Subsequent releases that used 2020 to 2022 birth registration data were also delayed.\n\n3.5 Stillbirths by cause of death\n\nPrior to the 2020 data year data on stillbirths by cause of death was published as part of the Child mortality (death cohort) tables in England and Wales. From the 2020 data year this table was included in the birth characteristics dataset to improve timeliness. Full details of cause of death coding and the ONS cause of death group hierarchical classification for stillbirths and neonatal deaths are provided in the User guide to child and infant mortality statistics.\n\nFrom the 2021 data year the hierarchical classification used to classify ONS cause of death groups for stillbirth and neonatal deaths has been updated to align with changes to the cause of death coding software. As such ONS cause groups from 2021 onwards are not directly comparable with 2014 to 2020 data.\n\nDual coding of the 2,371 stillbirths registered in 2020 in England and Wales enabled identification of the differences because of the reclassification. For stillbirths, 311 records (13.1%) changed cause group when reclassifying them into ONS cause groups. Of the eight ONS cause groups, three groups saw statistically significant changes in the number of records. These three cause groups were asphyxia, anoxia or trauma (antepartum/unknown), congenital anomalies and other conditions.\n\nThe asphyxia, anoxia or trauma (antepartum/unknown) cause group saw a net loss of 75 records because of the reclassification, a 16.8% decrease in the number of records. These records were reclassified mainly into the other specific conditions (86) and other conditions (25) cause groups. The largest number of new records entering the cause group came from the other conditions antepartum/unknown cause group (31).\n\nThe congenital anomalies cause group saw a 16.8% increase in the number of records, a net increase of 79 records. This increase was primarily because of reclassification from the other specific conditions (65) cause group, with a further 14 records being reclassified from several other cause groups.\n\nIn the other conditions cause group, the update resulted in a 4.3% decrease, a net loss of 51 records. A total of 89 records were reclassified into new cause groups, the largest being to the other specific conditions (45) and asphyxia, anoxia or trauma antepartum/unknown (31) cause groups.\n\nBack to table of contents\n\n4. Notes and definitions\n\nThe Office for National Statistics (ONS) produces two births datasets. Totals in each dataset differ.\n\nFirstly, the birth registrations dataset represents births that occurred in the calendar year, but includes a very small number of late registrations from the previous year. The cut-off dates and number of late registrations included in the birth registration dataset are reported in Section 4.2 and Table 1.\n\nSecondly, the linked births dataset includes birth registrations linked to their corresponding NHS birth notification to enable analysis of further factors such as gestation of live births and ethnicity of the baby. The subset of birth registrations linked to their corresponding notification is based on a true birth cohort, and does not include any late registrations. Section 4.3 provides more information and the linkage rates of birth registration to birth notifications each year are reported in Table 2.\n\n4.1 Populations used to calculate rates\n\nThe population figures used to calculate rates are generally the ONS mid-year estimates of the resident population of England and Wales.\n\nThe population estimates used are the most up-to-date when rates are produced. The specific population estimates used are detailed alongside published tables. Sometimes it is necessary to revise fertility rates following revisions to the population estimates. Such revisions are footnoted on tables. Further information on population estimates and their methodology is available.\n\n4.2 Occurrences date and registration date\n\nFrom 2001, the cut-off date for inclusion in the reference year was extended to 25 February to allow increased capture of births registered late. This change means the annual statistics are prepared on as close to a true occurrences basis as possible without further delay to publication, which provides a purer denominator for calculating infant mortality rates. To avoid artificially inflating the 2001 dataset through the increased capture of late registrations, the start date for the carryover of late registrations from births occurring in 2000 was similarly moved by two weeks.\n\nSince 2001, the following are included in annual statistics:\n\nbirths occurring in the reference year that were registered by 25 February the following year\n\nlate registrations for births occurring in the year before the reference year, that were registered too late to be included in the previous year's dataset (after 25 February)\n\nIn the 2000 volume the total number of births included:\n\nbirths that occurred in 2000 registered by 11 February 2001\n\nbirths occurring in 1999 that were registered between 12 February 2000 and 11 February 2001, that is, births in the previous year that had not been tabulated previously\n\nTotal annual births from 1994 to 1999 were derived in a similar way, except that births for all earlier years were included in the annual totals, not just births in the previous year.\n\nUp to 1993, the cut-off date was 31 January of the following year, but from 1994 this was then extended to the legal time limit by which a birth should be registered (42 days).\n\nSince the dataset for the 2000 volume, a small number of very late registrations have been excluded each year from the official statistics. Inclusion of these very late registrations in the statistical dataset was found to have an adverse effect on the quality of infant mortality data when linked with the live birth data. The annual dataset now includes only those births occurring in the reference year and late registrations of births occurring in the year previous to the reference year.\n\nEvery registrar of births and deaths is required to secure the prompt registration of births occurring within the sub-district covered. The registrar will, if necessary, send a requisition to the person whose duty it is to register the birth. Between 2008 and 2019, the percentage of births registered later than 42 days has ranged between 2% and 4%. In 2020, 42% of registrations were registered more than 42 days after birth; in 2021 and 2022, 26% and 13% of registrations respectively were registered more than 42 days after birth (the usual legal limit). We discuss registration delays and how they affect our statistics in more detail in Births in England and Wales explained: 2020.\n\nSince 2001, with the exception of 2021 and 2022, the number of late registrations that miss the cut-off date and end up in the following year's statistics has been fewer than 400. For 2021 and 2022, the number of late registrations from the previous year included in the dataset was higher than usual but still accounted for less than 1% of all births and does not affect the headline trends discussed (Table 1). There are also some very late registrations that have still not been registered some 14 months after the end of the reference year. These records are not included in any birth statistic. Since 2001, there have been fewer than 70 of these each year.\n\nDownload this table Table 1: Number of late registrations of births occurring in the previous year, England and Wales\n\n.xls .csv\n\n4.3 Birth notification\n\nThe birth notification is a document completed by the doctor or midwife present at the birth. It includes information that is not on the birth registration like gestation length and ethnicity of baby. We link birth registrations and birth notifications to produce some of our statistics as it enables us to provide breakdowns by these factors. The registrar also receives birth notification information so they can check whether all births have been registered or not.\n\nThe National Health Service Act 2006 (amended in 2013) and National Health Service (Wales) Act 2006, require notification of a birth to the local authority and clinical commissioning group (local health board in Wales) where the birth occurred. This is carried out by the hospital where the birth took place, or by the midwife or doctor in attendance at the birth.\n\nA list of the birth notifications for the sub-district is supplied to the registrar, who will then check whether every birth has been registered. The registrar will also verify each birth registered by checking it is on the health authority list.\n\nOver 99% of birth registrations were successfully linked to the corresponding birth notification. The impact on quality of the statistics is negligible, given the small number of unlinked records. From 2021, a new, more efficient linkage method was implemented. Linkage rate for the new method is well above 99% (Table 2), similar to the previous method.\n\nDownload this table Table 2: Percentage of birth registration records linked to a notification, England and Wales\n\n.xls .csv\n\n4.4 Visitors and overseas registrations\n\nBirths to residents of England and Wales that occur outside England and Wales are registered elsewhere and are excluded from our statistics. Births registered in England and Wales to mothers whose usual residence is outside of England and Wales are included in our statistics.\n\nThese births are included in total figures for England and Wales but are excluded from any sub-division of England and Wales. However, they are identified as a separate group in area tables (usual residence outside England and Wales).\n\nIn recent years, around 6,000 to 7,000 births occurring outside the UK to British nationals have been voluntarily registered annually with British Consulates, British High Commissioners, or HM Armed Forces registration centres. Most of these, however, are likely to be births to women who had emigrated from the UK: that is, had lived outside the UK for at least one year and were not residents of England and Wales. Such persons are not included in birth statistics or population estimates for England and Wales.\n\nAt any one time, some women of childbearing age (defined as age 15 to 44 years), usually resident in England and Wales, are temporarily absent overseas. Most of these women are absent for only a short period, so it is unlikely that a large number give birth while overseas. For example, we do know about the number of births to residents of England and Wales that were registered in Scotland and Northern Ireland. Since 2005, there have been about 200 such births each year in Scotland and less than 50 in Northern Ireland.\n\nThe number of births to residents of England and Wales occurring outside the country is likely to be similar to the number of births occurring in England and Wales to visitors resident elsewhere. The effect on fertility rates of the difference between the definitions used for birth event numerators and population denominators is assumed to be negligible.\n\n4.5 Abandoned children\n\nFew, if any, details are known about abandoned children and they are not included in birth statistics. However, since 1977, these infants have been included in the Abandoned Children Register maintained at the General Register Office (GRO) in Southport, England. Since 2005, the number of such cases have been extremely low.\n\n4.6 Stillbirths\n\nIn Section 41 of the Births and Deaths Registration Act 1953, a stillbirth is defined as \"a child which has issued forth from its mother after the 28th week of pregnancy and which did not at any time after being completely expelled from its mother breathe or show other signs of life\". This definition was used up to 30 September 1992. On 1 October 1992, the Still-Birth (Definition) Act 1992 came into force, altering the previous definition of a stillbirth to 24 or more weeks completed gestation. Figures for stillbirths from 1993 are not fully comparable with those for previous years. The effect of this change on figures for 1992 is analysed in Birth statistics 1992, series FM1 number 21.\n\n4.7 Births within marriage or civil partnership, and sole and joint registration\n\nFollowing the implementation of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 2008, same-sex female couples have been able to register the birth of a child as mother and second parent since 1 September 2009. The Act also made provision for two men to be officially recognised as the parents of a child through the provision of a parental order, obtainable through the courts; we do not hold the necessary information to be able to identify such births.\n\nA birth within marriage or civil partnership is that of a child born to parents who were lawfully married or in a civil partnership either:\n\nat the date of the child's birth\n\nwhen the child was conceived, even if they later divorced or were granted a civil partnership dissolution or the second parent died before the child's birth\n\nBirths occurring outside marriage or civil partnership may be registered either jointly or solely. A joint registration records details of both parents and requires them both to be present. A sole registration records only the mother's details.\n\nIn a few cases a joint registration is made in the absence of the father or second parent if an affiliation order or statutory declaration is provided. Information from the birth registration is used to determine whether the mother and father or second parent jointly registering a birth outside marriage or civil partnership were usually resident at the same address at the time of registration.\n\nBirths with both parents at the same address are identified by a single entry for the informant's usual address, while different addresses are identified by two entries.\n\nBecause of the small numbers of births registered to same-sex couples, births to same-sex couples in a marriage or civil partnership are grouped with births within marriage or civil partnership, while births to same-sex couples outside of a marriage or civil partnership are included with births outside marriage or civil partnership. The Marriages (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013 enabled same-sex couples to get married in England and Wales from 29 March 2014.\n\nBecause of the small numbers of births registered to same-sex couples, births occurring inside or outside marriage or civil partnership are not separated in the tables by whether the parents are the same or opposite sex. The number of live births to same-sex couples is in Table 3.\n\nDownload this table Table 3: Live births registered to same-sex couples, England and Wales\n\n.xls .csv\n\n4.8 Age of parents\n\nThe mother's or second parent's date of birth is recorded and translated into the age at the birthday preceding the date of the child's birth. This age is often termed \"age last birthday\". Detailed checks are carried out on those dates of birth that imply that the age of the mother is over 50 years or under 16 years.\n\nFor births registered under the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 2008, the age of second parent has been grouped with age of father. Given the relatively small number of births registered to same-sex couples, this has a negligible impact on the statistics.\n\nThe method by which missing values for mother's and father's or second parent's age have been imputed changed in 2004. From 2004 until the 2017 data year, if either the mother's date of birth or the father's or second parent's date of birth (where applicable) was not given, and mother's date of birth could not be gained from the birth notification (used from 2007 onwards), an age was imputed. This imputation was discontinued for 2018 data onwards. See Section 3: Issues affecting the quality of birth registration data for further details.\n\nTable 4 shows the percentage of records where parents' dates of birth were not stated at registration. Figures from 2007 onwards show the percentage of records still with no date of birth following birth notification matching. The impact of missing dates of birth on quality of the statistics is negligible, given the small number of records this affects.\n\nDownload this table Table 4: Percentage of records where parents’ dates of birth were not stated at registration (live births and stillbirths), England and Wales\n\n.xls .csv\n\n4.9 Country of birth of each parent\n\nThe country of birth of each parent for children born in England and Wales has been recorded at birth registration since April 1969. This is coded to country of birth for statistical purposes. The details for country of birth groupings can be found in the Parents' country of birth dataset on the country code listings tab. Birthplace does not necessarily equate with ethnic group.\n\n4.10 Place of birth and area of usual residence\n\nPlace of birth is categorised as follows:\n\nNHS establishments – generally hospitals, maternity units and maternity wings\n\nnon-NHS establishments – including private maternity units, military hospitals and private hospitals\n\nat home – denoting the usual place of residence of the mother\n\nelsewhere – including all locations not covered in the other categories: most of these are at a private residence not that of the mother, or are on the way to a hospital\n\nArea of usual residence\n\nA birth is assigned to an area according to the usual residence of the mother at the time of birth, as stated at registration. However, a birth may take place in an area other than that of the mother's usual residence and so an area of occurrence is also assigned.\n\nBirths that take place at home or elsewhere are not allocated a health area of occurrence.\n\nUntil the 2010 data year, we assigned area of usual residence using a lookup product (the National Statistics Postcode Directory). This product associated postcodes with a number of geographical levels (for example, local authorities and regions). The postcode was allocated to each level of geography using a point-in-polygon methodology. Although this method is spatially accurate, it does not provide the stable building blocks needed for comparing geographies at different levels.\n\nSince the 2011 data year, we have assigned area of usual residence by first linking each postcode to an output area using this same point-in-polygon methodology and then linking to all higher geographies by using a population-weighted, best-fit lookup to output area. This means that postcodes are allocated to a higher geography based on where the output area population weighted centroid lies. This is in line with the Geography Policy for National Statistics.\n\nSwitching to the new area allocation method had negligible impact on birth statistics down to local authority level. However, the new method improves comparability of birth statistics for subnational areas over time.\n\nFor more information about these methods, see National Statistics Postcode Products. An assessment of this change in methodology was also published in 2013: Assigning life events data to subnational areas: an assessment of a change to the methodology.\n\nNumbers and birth rates by mother's usual area of residence or place of birth are based on boundaries in place when the area derivation was conducted (for example, boundaries for 2019 births are based on the May 2020 National Statistics Postcode Lookup (NSPL)). The postcode of the woman's address at the time of the birth is used to determine the local authority she was living in.\n\nUntil the 2016 data year, annual birth statistics by mother's usual area of residence were produced using the boundaries that were in place during the year the birth occurred. For 2017 data onwards, figures produced in annual publications are based on the latest boundaries available at the time of the first release of birth statistics for that year and the same boundaries are used throughout the annual releases, with the exception of the 2020 data year. For 2020 data the first release was delayed but we used the May 2021 NSPL for consistency with previous years and the deaths registration data. Figures produced in ad-hoc publications will be based on the latest boundaries available.\n\n4.11 Multiple births\n\nMultiple births arising from a single pregnancy are counted as one maternity or paternity, although each child born is considered separately in analyses of birth statistics.\n\n4.12 Previous live-born children, true birth order, registration birth order and marital birth order\n\nPrior to May 2012, when a birth was within marriage, the informant was asked for the number of previous children, by the mother's husband and any former husband, for both live births and stillbirths. This allowed determination of the registration birth order. If the number of previous live-born children was not given, a value was imputed from a similar record with completely stated and otherwise matching particulars.\n\nBetween 2005 and 2011, the percentage of live births with information on the number of previous live born and stillborn children missing was 0.1% or less.\n\nHowever, the wording of the question before 2012 meant the number of previous live births was deficient for fertility statistics in three respects:\n\nat registration, the question on previous live births and stillbirths was not asked where the birth occurred outside marriage or within or outside a civil partnership\n\nat the registration of births and stillbirths occurring within marriage, previous live births where the woman had never been married to the father were not counted\n\nbecause of the ambiguous nature of the question (see Annex A and C) it is possible that births that occurred outside marriage, where the woman subsequently married the father, were not always counted\n\nThe proportion of births occurring outside marriage has risen steadily in recent years. Therefore, to account for the problems caused by the way the question was asked up until May 2012, the information collected on birth order at registration was supplemented to give estimates of overall or true birth order (that is, a measure that includes births both within and outside marriage). The supplementary information was obtained from the General Lifestyle Survey (GLF), formerly the General Household Survey (GHS).\n\nPrior to the 2004 volume of Birth statistics, information from the GHS surveys from 1986 to 1996, 1998 and 2000 was used to produce the estimates of true birth order. In the 2004, 2005 and 2006 volumes, additional information from the GHS for the years 2001 to 2003 was incorporated. For the 2007 and 2008 volumes and the 2009, 2010 and 2011 births releases, this information has been further supplemented by incorporating GHS or GLF data from the 2004 to 2006 surveys. The method of estimation is described in a Population Trends article.\n\nAmendments to the Population (Statistics) Act (PSA) 1938 meant that from May 2012, information is now collected at all birth registrations on the total numbers of previous live births and previous stillbirths that the mother has had (not just those with the current or former husband). This has simplified the question asked by registrars and provides improved coverage. These changes mean that true birth order can now be obtained directly from the birth registration.\n\nThe differences between how a hypothetical mother might have answered the question before and after the amendments to the PSA are shown to illustrate.\n\nHypothetical birth history scenario to illustrate the problems that the question on previous children may have caused before the amendments to the Population (Statistics) Acts\n\nActual birth history: 1st birth while cohabiting with man A\n\nHow birth order is likely to have been recorded since the amendments to the PSA: 1; the mother will say she's had no previous children, so this would be treated as the first birth\n\nHow birth order may have been recorded in the data before the amendments to the PSA: the mother wouldn't have been asked about previous children as this birth did not occur within marriage\n\nActual birth history: 2nd birth while married to man B\n\nHow birth order is likely to have been recorded since the amendments to the PSA: 2\n\nHow birth order may have been recorded in the data before the amendments to the PSA: 1; the mother is likely to have answered that she's had no previous children to her current husband or a previous husband, so this would be treated as the first birth\n\nActual birth history: 3rd birth while cohabiting with man C\n\nHow birth order is likely to have been recorded since the amendments to the PSA: 3\n\nHow birth order may have been recorded in the data before the amendments to the PSA: the mother wouldn't have been asked about previous children as this birth did not occur within marriage\n\nActual birth history: 4th birth after marriage to man C\n\nHow birth order is likely to have been recorded since the amendments to the PSA: 4\n\nHow birth order may have been recorded in the data before the amendments to the PSA: the mother is most likely to have answered that she had two previous children with either her current husband or a previous husband (that is, her second and third children), so this would be treated as the third birth\n\nWe expect that the way the question has been asked since the amendments to the PSA captures \"true birth order\". The way the question was asked before the amendments to PSA captures what we call \"registration birth order\". For information, we also define \"marital birth order\" in some statistics – this is slightly different again; in the previous example there would have been two births while married, the first being birth two and the second being birth four.\n\nAn article describing the changes that have occurred to our birth statistics as a result of improvements to the Population (Statistics) Act is available. It provides background to the changes and provides high-level findings from the new data collected in 2012 and 2013.\n\nAn investigation of Childbearing by registration status in England and Wales, using birth registration data for 2012 and 2013 examines the patterns and characteristics in birth registrations following the improvements to the data collected at birth registration. The principal characteristics explored in the article relate to whether a woman has previously been married and whether the birth is the mother's first child or subsequent child.\n\n4.13 Birth intervals\n\nFigures showing median birth intervals are available in Birth characteristics. The median intervals between first, second, third and fourth births are derived by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) from a 100% extract (5% sample for estimates up to and including 2006) of new claims for Child Benefit from all births occurring in the UK, whether within or outside marriage. A zero interval is assumed for births resulting from a multiple maternity.\n\n4.14 Gestation\n\nGestational age is measured in completed weeks. For stillbirths, gestation is recorded at birth registration and is therefore available on our annual birth registration datasets. For live births, gestation is recorded on the birth notification but not at birth registration. For this reason, gestation for live births is not available on our annual birth registration datasets but is available on our annual linked births dataset where birth registrations have been linked to birth notifications.\n\nGestational age is highly correlated with birthweight. For gestational age recorded as less than 22 weeks, this was considered as valid if there was a plausible birthweight (less than 1,000 grams); a separate category was created for gestational age less than 22 weeks and inconsistent birthweight (1,000 grams or more), which is reported separately.\n\nGestational age is grouped as follows:\n\nEmbed code\n\nEmbed this interactive\n\nNotes\n\nA stillbirth is a baby born after 24 or more weeks completed gestation and which did not, at any time, breathe or show signs of life.\n\n4.15 Birthweight\n\nBirthweight is measured in grams. For live birth registrations received on the Registration Online System (RON), birthweight is passed electronically to us from the notification by the midwife or doctor in attendance at the birth. These details are then supplied to the registrar. For stillbirths, details of the weight of the foetus are supplied on a certificate by a doctor or midwife. The certificate is then taken by an informant to the registrar. If the birthweight is missing, but the registration is linked to the birth notification then the birthweight from the notification is taken.\n\nIn cases where no birthweight is recorded, the birth is included in the total \"all weights\" but not distributed among the individual categories. In 2020, the methodology towards birthweights was adjusted. From the 2019 data year onwards, implausible birthweights have been removed from individual categories but are included in the total \"all weights\". Assessment of what was implausible was based on the recorded birthweight and gestational age. A birthweight was considered implausible when:\n\na liveborn male weighed less than 230 grams or greater than 6,000 grams\n\na liveborn female weighed less than 249 grams or greater than 6,000 grams\n\na stillborn male or female weighed less than 230 grams or greater than 6,000 grams\n\nThe removal of implausible birthweights was to increase the accuracy of our birthweight statistics. The impact on quality of the statistics is negligible given the small number of records this affects. Table 5 provides figures for records where no birthweight was recorded.\n\nDownload this table Table 5: Percentage of births where birthweight was not recorded, England and Wales\n\n.xls .csv\n\n4.16 Duration of marriage or civil partnership\n\nAt registration only the month and year of marriage or civil partnership are recorded, so the calculation relates to the interval in completed months between the middle of the month of marriage or civil partnership and the date of the child's birth.\n\nPrior to March 2018, if the date of marriage or civil partnership was not given, a value for the duration was imputed from a similar record with completely stated and otherwise matching particulars. Imputation was discontinued in March 2018 to make processing more efficient but maintain accuracy. Since 2008, the percentage of all live births with a missing date of marriage or civil partnership has been around 1%.\n\nFor women who have been married or formed a civil partnership more than once, duration refers to the length of the current marriage or civil partnership.\n\n4.17 Birth cohorts\n\nBirth statistics analysed by year of occurrence and by age of mother have been available since 1938. The tables in the Childbearing for women born in different years package (formerly known as Cohort fertility) show these statistics in cohort form: by the year of birth of the mother rather than the year of birth of the child.\n\nThe year of birth of the mother is by necessity approximate because, prior to 1963, data are available only by calendar year of occurrence and age of mother at childbirth. For instance, women aged 32 years giving birth to children in 2012 could have been born in either 1979 or 1980; for convenience however, such women are regarded as belonging to the 1980 cohort. Tables refer to age in exact years.\n\n4.18 Socio-economic classification as defined by occupation\n\nInformation on occupation of the mother or father is coded for only a sample of 1 in 10 live births. Combining this with the employment status, a code for socio-economic classification (or social class in previous volumes) may be derived.\n\nFrom 1991 to 2000, occupation was coded using the Standard Occupational Classification (SOC): SOC 1990 and occupation codes were allocated to the Registrar General's Social Class. Since 2001, the National Statistics Socio-economic Classification (NS-SEC) has categorised the socio-economic classification of people.\n\nThe Standard Occupational Classification is revised every 10 years and in 2011 SOC 2010 replaced SOC 2000. A report outlining the impact of re-basing the NS-SEC on SOC 2010 is available.\n\nNS-SEC has eight analytic classes, the first of which can be subdivided:\n\n1 Higher managerial and professional occupations 1.1 Large employers and higher managerial occupations 1.2 Higher professional occupations 2 Lower managerial and professional occupations 3 Intermediate occupations 4 Small employers and own-account workers 5 Lower supervisory and technical occupations 6 Semi-routine occupations 7 Routine occupations 8 Never worked and long-term unemployed\n\nStudents, occupations not stated or inadequately described and occupations not classifiable for other reasons are added as \"not classified\".\n\nThe reduced method for deriving NS-SEC is used for reporting NS-SEC in birth statistics.\n\nFrom the 2012 data year, we have used the combined method for reporting NS-SEC for birth statistics. This uses the most advantaged NS-SEC of either parent and creating a household level classification rather than just using the father's classification. The combined method means that sole-registered births where information on the father is not available are now included in published birth statistics by NS-SEC.\n\nFollowing this change, the publication Births by socio-economic status of father was discontinued and a new set of NS-SEC tables were published in the Births by parents' characteristics release.\n\nUp until the 2011 data year, live birth statistics by NS-SEC used the father's NS-SEC. Historically, the decision to use the father's NS-SEC was based on the premise that many mothers either do not have a paid occupation or choose not to state their occupational details at birth registration.\n\nThe sample figures in tables are weighted to agree with known totals derived from the 100% processing of birth registrations by mother's age and previous live-born children. This ensures consistency with sub-totals in the same table and improves the quality of sample estimates. Numbers of live births for each NS-SEC class and age group may differ between tables because of the method used to weight the 10% sample.\n\nFor example:\n\nAppendix Tables 1 and 2 published alongside the NS-SEC tables show standard errors for selected numbers of births and percentages. If the estimated weighted number in a particular category was 50,000, then the standard error of that estimate would be approximately 640.\n\nBased on statistical theory, this means that for the type of distribution being considered there is about a 95% chance that the \"true\" number in the population lies within two standard errors of the estimates. This true number is that which would have been obtained had all the information been collected, rather than a 1 in 10 sample.\n\nIn this example, the 95% confidence interval would be:\n\n50,000 ± (plus or minus) 1,300, or 48,700 to 51,300.\n\nIn other words, we could say that we are 95% confident that the true value, if we had collected all the information instead of 10%, lies somewhere between 48,700 and 51,300.\n\n4.19 Ethnicity\n\nUp until 2019, ethnic groups were divided into nine categories:\n\nBangladeshi\n\nIndian\n\nPakistani\n\nBlack African\n\nBlack Caribbean\n\nWhite British\n\nWhite Other\n\nAll Others\n\nNot Stated\n\nIn datasets for the year 2019 and earlier, those with “English”, “Scottish”, “Welsh” and “Northern Irish” ethnicity were included in the “White Other” category.\n\nIn datasets for the year 2020 and later, ethnic groups are divided into 12 categories:\n\nBangladeshi\n\nIndian\n\nPakistani\n\nAny other Asian background\n\nBlack African\n\nBlack Caribbean\n\nAny other Black background\n\nMixed and multiple ethnic group\n\nAny Other ethnic group\n\nWhite British\n\nWhite Other\n\nNot Stated\n\nSince the change, those with “English”, “Scottish”, “Welsh” and “Northern Irish” ethnicity are included in the “White British” category.\n\nBack to table of contents\n\n11.

Comparisons of unstandardised mean ages are affected by changes in the structure of the population by age, marital status and parity. This measure should only be used when requiring a mean for a particular year. Unstandardised means are calculated using only numbers of births by single year of age of mother.\n\nBack to table of contents"
