The overall external position has also strengthened. The overriding economic policy challenges are to reduce the size of government sustaining growth, diversify the economy, and improve its quality. The monetary and fiscal policy stance on the global food and fuel price shocks has been commended by Executive Directors. Sustaining growth, broadening its sources, and improving its quality are key policy priorities of the government.",

        "text": "Appendix I: Exchange Rate Assessment 1\n\nDifferent measures of exchange rate assessment provide evidence of some degree of overvaluation, although the misalignment is not in excess of 10 percent. Taking into account the confidence bands surrounding the various estimates, it is fair to conclude that by and large the real effective exchange rate (REER) is broadly in line with macroeconomic fundamentals from a medium-term perspective.\n\n1. Alternative estimates suggest that the real effective exchange rate in Botswana is only slightly overvalued (Figure 1). In particular:\n\nMacroeconomic balance approach (MB): This approach assesses the exchange rate by estimating the gap between the underlying current account balance and its norm, taking into account Botswana’s macroeconomic fundamentals. The degree of exchange rate under- or overvaluation is determined by the size of the gap and the elasticity of the current account relative to the real effective exchange rate. The MB indicates an overvalued exchange rate, in the order of 4–6 percent under the baseline scenario and 15–17 percent under the alternative scenario that assumes a delayed fiscal consolidation. This assessment assumes that fiscal consolidation proceeds as planned and that the overall budget balance returns to a moderate surplus over the medium term. The underlying current account balance is calculated to be consistent with the sustainable fiscal position under the NMPB approach.\n\nEquilibrium real exchange rate approach (EREER): This approach estimates the level of the equilibrium real exchange rate based on macroeconomic fundamentals and then compares it to the observed real exchange rate. The difference between the levels is the amount of under- or overvaluation of the real effective exchange rate. The EREER estimates that the exchange rate is currently overvalued by 9 percent.\n\nExternal sustainability approach (ES): In the case of Botswana, this approach has been calibrated to calculate the norm current account balance consistent with a buildup of net foreign assets that takes into account the need to accumulate savings ahead of declining diamond receipts. In this case also, the gap between the underlying and norm current account balances reflects the degree of under- or overvaluation of the real effective exchange rate. The ES approach indicates that the exchange rate is overvalued by 11 percent.\n\nThe purchasing power parity approach (PPP): Proposed by Rodrick (2008), this approach builds a stylized model following three steps: (i) define the concept of relative prices using the PPP approach (PPP exchange rate); (ii) estimate a panel regression of the ratio of the PPP exchange rate to the market exchange rate as a function of GDP per capita at “PPP dollars” and (iii) evaluate the residual of the model to determine the degree of misalignment. The PPP approach shows an exchange rate that is overvalued by about 8 percent in 2010.\n\n2. Other non-price competitiveness indicators suggest that Botswana is close to its peer countries in terms of overall competitiveness (Figure 2). It scores slightly above average compared to other middle-income countries (MICs) in terms of strength of institutions, financial market development, and labor market flexibility. Still on other metrics it scores below the average for MICs worldwide. For example, health and education are below middle-income average. Infrastructure and macroeconomic environment scores are broadly in line with countries with similar income level and characteristics.\n\n3. In general, Botswana has the conditions to be as competitive as other middle-income countries. Improving the return on investment in tertiary education is important to placing the country in a competitive position as the economy moves beyond the diamond sector.\n\nAppendix II: Long-Term Fiscal Sustainability Benchmarks\n\n1. This appendix applies the permanent income hypothesis framework to derive numerical benchmarks to guide Botswana’s medium-term fiscal policy toward the goal of long-term fiscal sustainability.1 A key long-term fiscal challenge facing producers of exhaustible natural resources is to decide how to allocate government wealth (including mineral wealth) across generations. This challenge is met by targeting a fiscal policy that preserves the government wealth. The standard permanent income hypothesis (PIH) argues that the preservation of wealth would require that spending in each period be limited to the permanent income or the implicit return on government wealth. To compute this “permanent” income, the projected stream of mineral revenues is transformed into a hypothetical annuity with the same net present value as the revenues. The annuity reflects the permanent portion of the country’s mineral wealth. The benchmark amount of spending that the government can then permanently sustain is equal to the sum of the annuity and non-mineral revenues. The benchmark fiscal balance is then calculated by setting annual expenditures equal to this level and saving the difference between actual and the hypothetical annuitized mineral revenues.\n\n2. The numerical exercises in the appendix compare the staff’s medium-term fiscal projections (which are consistent with the government’s fiscal framework) against the fiscal benchmarks derived from the PIH approach. The staff projections assume the reaching of a balanced budget by FY2012/13, along a steady, but gradual, diamond market recovery.\n\n3. The benchmarks derived from the PIH suggest that Botswana’s current fiscal position is not sustainable. Under the baseline scenario (scenario (a) in Table 1 below) in which the annuity is held constant as a share of non-mineral GDP, the sustainable nonmineral primary deficit is 8.1 percent of non-mineral GDP. This deficit is consistent with a spending level of 27 percent of GDP on average from FY2011/12 to FY2015/16, which is lower than the staff’s medium-term expenditure projections of 30.7 percent of GDP for the same period. The benchmarks non-mineral primary deficits average about 10 percent of GDP between FY2011/12 and FY2015/16, when we assume a more optimistic rate of return on mineral wealth (scenario (b)) or higher non-mineral revenues (scenario (c)). When the annuity is held constant in real per capita terms (scenario (d)), or simply in real terms (scenario (e)), the sustainable non-mineral primary deficits are wider initially, but narrow gradually to a range of 9 to 11 percent of non-mineral GDP by 2015-16. The assumptions used to calculate the benchmarks are summarized in Box 1.\n\nTable 1.\n\nMedium-Term Fiscal Outlook and Sustainability Benchmarks\n\nSource: IMF staff calculations.\n\nTable 1.\n\nMedium-Term Fiscal Outlook and Sustainability Benchmarks\n\nNonmining Overall Balance Primary Balance 2010/11 2015/16 2010/11 2015/16 (Percent of (Percent of GDP) nonmining GDP) Staff projections −22.8 −9.3 −5.8 4.1 Sustainability benchmarks: Revenue projections minus expenditure that follows “permanent” income (a) Baseline assumptions −8.1 −8.1 4.2 4.9 Baseline revenues1 and baseline interest rate assumption (b) Conservative assumptions −9.6 −9.6 3.2 3.9 Baseline revenues and optimistic interest rate assumption (c) Optimistic assumptions −10.0 −10.0 2.9 3.6 Optimistic mineral and non-mineral revenues and optimistic interest rate assumption (d) Constant per capita purchasing power −11.2 −9.0 2.1 4.2 Baseline assumptions (e) Constant real purchase power −13.8 −10.7 0.3 3.1 Baseline assumptions\n\nSource: IMF staff calculations.\n\nTable 1.\n\nMedium-Term Fiscal Outlook and Sustainability Benchmarks\n\nNonmining Overall Balance Primary Balance 2010/11 2015/16 2010/11 2015/16 (Percent of (Percent of GDP) nonmining GDP) Staff projections −22.8 −9.3 −5.8 4.1 Sustainability benchmarks: Revenue projections minus expenditure that follows “permanent” income (a) Baseline assumptions −8.1 −8.1 4.2 4.9 Baseline revenues1 and baseline interest rate assumption (b) Conservative assumptions −9.6 −9.6 3.2 3.9 Baseline revenues and optimistic interest rate assumption (c) Optimistic assumptions −10.0 −10.0 2.9 3.6 Optimistic mineral and non-mineral revenues and optimistic interest rate assumption (d) Constant per capita purchasing power −11.2 −9.0 2.1 4.2 Baseline assumptions (e) Constant real purchase power −13.8 −10.7 0.3 3.1 Baseline assumptions\n\nSource: IMF staff calculations.\n\n4. The robustness of the PIH benchmarks was confirmed against structural budget deficit estimates prepared using Chile’s structural fiscal balance approach. Staff estimates suggest that the sustainable structural balance path for Botswana is closely correlated with the path for the non-mineral primary deficit derived using the PIH framework (Table 2). The structural balance is defined as the difference between the expected structural mining revenues and the expected non-mining structural expenditures. Expected structural mining revenues are those derived by assuming that the economy is operating at its potential and diamond prices are at their long-term levels.\n\nTable 2.\n\nStructural Balance Estimates, 2009/10–2015/16\n\nSource: IMF staff estimates.\n\nTable 2.\n\nStructural Balance Estimates, 2009/10–2015/16\n\n2009/10 2010/11 2011/12 2012/13 2013/14 2014/15 2015/16 (In percent of non-mining GDP) Structural revenues 36.9 32.5 34.6 36.2 38.4 39.6 39.8 Structural Expenditures 63.5 53.6 51.1 49.7 48.3 47.5 46.1 Structural balance −26.6 −21.1 −16.5 −13.5 −9.9 −7.9 −6.3 Memo item: Rolling correlation with NMPB under PIH framework 0.712 0.744 0.721 0.703 0.759 0.771 0.762\n\nSource: IMF staff estimates.\n\nTable 2.\n\nStructural Balance Estimates, 2009/10–2015/16\n\n2009/10 2010/11 2011/12 2012/13 2013/14 2014/15 2015/16 (In percent of non-mining GDP) Structural revenues 36.9 32.5 34.6 36.2 38.4 39.6 39.8 Structural Expenditures 63.5 53.6 51.1 49.7 48.3 47.5 46.1 Structural balance −26.6 −21.1 −16.5 −13.5 −9.9 −7.9 −6.3 Memo item: Rolling correlation with NMPB under PIH framework 0.712 0.744 0.721 0.703 0.759 0.771 0.762\n\nSource: IMF staff estimates.\n\nBox 1.\n\nBotswana: Assumptions Used to Calculate Benchmarks\n\nProduction of diamonds reaches a peak of 31 million carats in 2017 and begins a sharp decline from 2020.\n\nThe nominal US dollar price of diamonds is adjusted annually by the rate of change in the CPI of the advanced economies, so it stays constant in real terms. The dollar price is converted to pula using the period average nominal exchange rate.\n\nThe initial stock of wealth accumulated into the pula fund is 47 percent of GDP at end-December 2011. This is added to the value of mineral wealth still in the ground in calculating the total value of mineral wealth.\n\nThe real return on mineral wealth is 4.2 percent, based on the average real return of the Norwegian Pension Fund over the last 10 years.\n\nThe income from annuitized diamond revenue is spread until 2050.\n\nThe annuity is assumed to stay constant in terms of real non-mining GDP.\n\nThe Pula Fund\n\nThe Pula Fund was originally established in November 1993 under the Bank of Botswana Act (1975). It was re-established in its current form under the Bank of Botswana Act (1996) to provide greater flexibility in the management of international reserves, and greater certainty in the forecasting of annual “dividend” payments to the government from the BoB. The Act came into operation on January 1, 1997.\n\nUnder the Act, Botswana’s international reserves are split into two portfolios: (i) the Liquidity Portfolio, to provide the foreign exchange needed for normal day to day international transactions; and (ii) the Pula Fund, to be invested in long-term assets to achieve higher returns. The Pula Fund, managed by the BoB, is composed of the Government Investment Account (GIA), which reflects both savings from accumulated fiscal surpluses and inflows of additional of government debt, together with the broader accumulation of national savings in excess of the BoB’s target for liquid reserves. This target is based on six months of import cover, and when import cover deviates from this level by more than three months in either direction resources are transferred, as appropriate, into or out of the liquidity portfolio. Pula Fund assets are invested in long-term instruments overseas across a range of major currencies and in a mixture of long-term fixed income securities and equities. The Act charges the BoB with managing and determining investment policy of, and the payment of dividends accruing from, the Pula Fund, in consultation with the Minister of Finance and Development Planning. Together with the Liquidity Portfolio, the Pula Fund has been held with a global custodian since 1993.\n\nWhile the Act provides a legal framework for the establishment, management, and auditing of the Fund, it does not specify the objective of the Fund in the context of overall fiscal policy and rules on the operation of the Pula Fund, particularly concerning payments into the Fund, withdrawals from it, and their uses. However, since its inception it has been broadly understood that as well as serving as a revenue stabilization fund, the Pula Fund is a fund for future generations that provides a holding ground for subsequent domestic investment when productive opportunities for such investment are identified."
