        "text": "You're not imagining it. There are more ticks in the Poconos these days.\n\nMichael Pula, the director of Monroe County Vector Control, said there were about 50 ticks submitted, bagged and waiting to be examined at his office on the Tuesday after the Memorial Day weekend. That's double what the office usually gets on a busy day, he said.\n\nThis weekend might not be any different.\n\nVector Control accepts drop-offs of ticks at its Stroudsburg office. Pula said there had been a steady stream of ticks coming in to the office this year, the most since the office started doing risk analysis for tick bites since 2006.\n\n\"It's been constant, every day that we're in,\" he said.\n\nThe Northeast Infectious Disease Diagnostic Laboratory in Minisink Hills has been just as busy. Melissa Shaw, an East Stroudsburg University graduate student working at the lab, said she tested about 20 ticks in May, when tick season normally doesn't begin in earnest until June.\n\n\"And we have more people just calling in asking questions about ticks,\" she said.\n\nIt's stayed busy in June, with the office getting about 10 ticks a week for testing, according to Jane Huffman, a biology professor at ESU.\n\nAn increase in the tick population raises concerns for a rise in cases of Lyme disease, which, according to the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, can cause joint inflammation, impaired memory or in extreme, untreated cases, paralysis. Ticks carry Lyme disease.\n\nPennsylvania had the highest incidence of Lyme disease in the country in 2009, according to the Centers for Disease Control, and more ticks could mean more Lyme disease cases.\n\nAlmost 17 percent of all confirmed cases in the country were from Pennsylvania that year.\n\nMonroe County had 133 reported cases in 2009 and Pike County had 32.\n\nHowever, the state ranked eighth in incidence rate — the number of cases per 100,000 people.\n\nThe 2010 statistics still are being finalized, according to the state's Department of Health.\n\nAn increase in the tick population could raise those cases, local officials said.\n\nPula said over the last five years there would be mid-week days with no tick submissions, and a busy day would be about 10 dropoffs.\n\nThis year, the office is getting at least five to 10 dropoffs every day, and on busy days the office sees about 20 to 25.\n\nVector Control can determine how long a tick had been attached to a human, but not whether the tick carried Lyme disease. When the time is more than 24 hours, Pula said he recommends a doctor visit.\n\nThe Northeast Infectious Disease Diagnostic Laboratory, part of East Stroudsburg University's Applied DNA Sciences office, does test whether the tick carried Lyme disease. For $75, any tick can be tested, Shaw said.\n\nIf the tick population is up, there are only theories for the reason. Pula said Vector Control has been doing outreach over the last five years to let people know about the collection of ticks, and maybe it's catching on now.\n\nHowever, Huffman said it could be linked to an increase in local deer population.\n\n\"It's cyclical,\" she said. \"Sometimes we see a higher number of ticks, sometimes it's smaller. But there definitely seems to be more ticks this year.\"\n\nUse fine-tipped tweezers to remove a tick. If you don't have tweezers, put on gloves or cover your hands with tissue paper, then use your fingers. Do not handle the tick with bare hands.\n\nGrab the tick as close to its mouth (the part that is stuck in your skin) as you can. The body of the tick will be above your skin.\n\nDo not grab the tick around its bloated belly. You could push infected fluid from the tick into your body if you squeeze it.\n\nGently pull the tick straight out until its mouth lets go of your skin. Do not twist or \"unscrew\" the tick. This may separate the tick's head from its body and leave parts of its mouth in your skin.\n\nAvoid the removal remedies you may have heard such as using nail polish remover, alcohol or petroleum jelly or using heat, such as a lighter to make the tick detach from the skin. You want to remove the tick as quickly as possible, not waiting for it to detach.\n\nTIPS TO PREVENT TICK BITES\n\nWear long sleeved shirts and tightly woven clothing this is light in color when walking in wooded areas so the ticks can be seen more easily.\n\nWear your shirt tucked into your pants, and your pants tucked into your socks or boots.\n\nWalk in the center of trails through the woods to avoid picking up ticks from overhanging grass and brush.\n\nKeep grass trimmed at home as short as possible.\n\nApply tick repellents to your clothing, shoes and socks before going out.\n\nCheck yourself, your family, and your pets routinely for ticks, especially after a trip outdoors. Remember to check the hard-to-see areas such as the groin, armpits, and scalp.\n\nShower and shampoo your hair if you think you may have been exposed to ticks.\n\nCheck your clothes for ticks and wash them immediately in order to remove any ticks.\n\nThe Monroe County Vector Control is located at 38 N. 7th St. in Stroudsburg. It can be reached at (570) 517-3891.\n\nHow to remove a tick"
