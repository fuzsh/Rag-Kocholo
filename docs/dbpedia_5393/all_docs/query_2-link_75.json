The total population presents one overall measure of the potential impact of the country on the world and within its region. Note: Starting with the 1993 Factbook, demographic estimates for some countries (mostly African) have explicitly taken into account the effects of the growing impact of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. These countries are currently: The Bahamas, Benin, Botswana, Brazil, Burkina Faso, Burma, Burundi, Cambodia, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Republic of the Congo, Cote d'Ivoire, Ethiopia, Gabon, Ghana, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Thailand, Togo, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.\n\nSource: CIA World Factbook - This page was last updated on Saturday, September 18, 2021\n\nSee Also\n\nPopulation by year chart\n\nPopulation rank chart\n\nPopulation - comparative map\n\nPopulation, total - thematic map - World Bank indicator\n\nPopulation, total - country comparison - World Bank indicator\n\nPopulation clock\n\nPopulation growth rate\n\nRelated Data From the International Monetary Fund"
