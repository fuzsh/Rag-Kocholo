        "text": "6. English local authority comparisons - total unpaid care in 2011 and comparison with 2001\n\nThere is a 6.8 per cent difference in the amount of unpaid care provided by the residents of North East Derbyshire (13.3 per cent) and Wandsworth (6.5 per cent). This means that twice as much care is being provided in North East Derbyshire when compared with Wandsworth (Figure 5).\n\nFigure 5: Local authorities with highest and lowest provision of unpaid care, ranked by the total of all durations of care combined with duration specific categories\n\nSource: Census - Office for National Statistics\n\nNotes:\n\nPercentages are rounded values to one decimal place.\n\nOf the top ten authorities providing the least care overall, nine are London boroughs, eight of which are inner London boroughs. Those authorities whose usual residents provide the most unpaid care are more mixed in their regional make-up; the majority have significant rural based populations and only St. Helens and Sefton in the North West region are major urban settlements in the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs urban – rural classification. (Disability in England and Wales, 2011 and Comparison with 2001 provides more information).\n\nThere is a strong relationship between the percentage of an authority’s usual residents who are limited in daily activities1 and in the amount of unpaid care their residents provide; for example, four authorities in the top ten with the highest percentage of unpaid carers (East Lindsey, Bolsover, West Somerset and Wyre) also feature in the top ten authorities with the highest prevalence of disability.\n\nDifferences in care provision are also present by a measure of area deprivation2. Although Liverpool, the most deprived local authority in England based on the Indices of Deprivation 2010 average summary score, has a younger age structure than Hart, the least deprived, Liverpool has a higher percentage of unpaid carers. Disability-free life expectancy 3 was 10 years higher for men in Hart than Liverpool (249.5 Kb Excel sheet) in 2007-09 suggesting care needs are likely to be manifesting at earlier ages in Liverpool which may explain the higher level of unpaid care in Liverpool despite its younger age structure. An interactive map which enables information on the extent of unpaid care to be accessed for each local authority in England and Wales in 2001 and 2011 is available.\n\nAnother interesting question to ask is whether there is an unmet need for care, which could be related to the supply of care home facilities. The 2011 Census enumerated residents of medical and care establishments, which enables an assessment of how equally these facilities are distributed across local authorities. If there is an unmet need for care, it might be expected that the rate of medical and care establishment enumerations per 1000 population would be lower in those authorities where unpaid care levels are high.\n\nRother has the highest medical and care enumeration rate (Table 1) and is ranked 18th highest on percentage of all care durations. However, North East Derbyshire had the highest percentage of unpaid carers, but its medical and care enumeration rank is 181st. The 2011 Census suggests that local authorities with the lowest medical and care establishment enumeration rate also have lower levels of unpaid care; however, among those with the highest rates, their unpaid care ranking is more contrasting.\n\nTable 1: Local authorities ranked by Medical and Care enumeration rate in 2011, with percentage of unpaid care provision\n\nEnglandPer cent1, Rank Local authorityMedical and Care establishment enumerations21-50 hours or more per 1,0003Rank%Rank Rother18.6112.418 Worthing16.4210.4175 Hastings15.9310.5168 Arun15.6411.1116 Torbay15.6512.320 Tendring14.9612.613 Reigate and Banstead14.879.5254 Eastbourne14.8810.6154 Taunton Deane14.7910.6153 Isle of Wight14.21011.942 Camden3.43177.9315 Westminster3.23187.2321 Hammersmith and Fulham2.93196.8324 Broxbourne2.83209.7245 Hounslow2.83218.8291 Slough2.73228.3305 Newham2.53238.0311 City of London2.43247.8316 Hackney2.23257.3320 Tower Hamlets1.63267.6318 Source: 2011 Census 1.

Per thousand usual residents, 2011\n\nDownload this table Table 1: Local authorities ranked by Medical and Care enumeration rate in 2011, with percentage of unpaid care provision\n\n.xls (26.1 kB)\n\nCompared with 2001, only four of the ten local authorities providing the highest percentages of unpaid care (1-50+ hours) in 2011 were in the top ten in 2001; these were North East Derbyshire, Staffordshire Moorlands, St Helens and Bolsover. The smallest change has been in North East Derbyshire where it has remained constant as the local authority which provides the most unpaid care.\n\nTable 2 ranks the 10 authorities with the highest percentage increases and decreases in the provision of all durations of care between 2001 and 2011.\n\nTable 2: Authorities ranked by the highest percentage increases or decreases in the provision of care between 2001 and 2011\n\nEnglandPer cent1, Rank Local Authority2011 (%)2001 (%)2011 (Rank)2001 (Rank)Change 2001-2011 (%)2Change in carer number Isles of Scilly10.08.022431025.048 Eden11.39.78420217.21,144 West Somerset12.710.976416.4574 Purbeck12.710.996516.3857 Gosport9.98.623029315.51,631 Stevenage10.28.819827715.41,518 Torbay12.310.7208814.92,226 Teignbridge12.110.62910414.42,234 East Lindsey13.011.422814.02,858 Fareham10.69.314624014.01,798 Waltham Forest8.28.6308289-4.42,450 Bradford9.810.3242138-4.83,046 Southwark7.27.6322319-4.92,210 Sheffield10.410.917959-5.01,315 Middlesbrough10.210.819674-5.5-445 Newham8.08.5311297-5.73,941 City of London7.88.3316304-6.2-22 Newcastle upon Tyne9.210.1273152-9.0-457 Barking and Dagenham8.79.7295197-10.3281 Tower Hamlets7.68.6318292-11.12,559 Sources: 2001 Census, 2011 Census 1. Percentages are rounded to one decimal place 2. Percentage change in unpaid care between 2001 and 2011 is calculated by subtracting per cent providing care in 2001 from per cent providing care in 2011 and dividing the resulting figure by per cent providing care in 2001 and multiplying by 100.\n\nDownload this table Table 2: Authorities ranked by the highest percentage increases or decreases in the provision of care between 2001 and 2011\n\n.xls (26.1 kB)\n\nWest Somerset and Purbeck had the biggest changes in rank from the 64th and 65th highest respectively in 2001 to the 7th and 9th highest in 2011 (Table 2). When ranking authorities on the basis of the percentage change in care provision, 271 authorities experienced increases and only 55 authorities experienced decreases. The Isles of Scilly had the highest percentage increase in unpaid care, but its population is small and therefore had only a modest change in absolute numbers. All 10 of the top providers of care in 2011 (Figure 5) have seen increases in the percentage of carers over the decade. Of these top 10 providers of care in 2011 the largest increase was in West Somerset, which saw a percentage increase of 16.4 per cent. East Lindsey, the authority with the highest percentage of people with activity limitations was among the top 10 authorities with the highest increases in care provided.\n\nAuthorities experiencing the largest falls were urban conurbations. However, as can be seen in table 2, although all experienced a percentage fall, in all but three cases, the absolute number of carers increased, because of increases in population size over the ten years. The northern cities of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, Sheffield and Bradford, and the town of Middlesbrough had the greatest fall in their ranking between 2001 and 2011 for the amount of care provided, but of these only Newcastle-upon-Tyne and Middlesbrough actually saw the absolute number of carers fall.\n\nWhat these results show is that unpaid care has risen in the majority of authorities, and even in those which experienced a percentage fall, absolute numbers have increased in 320 authorities and decreased in only 6; in Birmingham the absolute number of unpaid carers increased by more than 9,000, while in Newcastle-upon-Tyne the number of unpaid carers fell by 457.\n\nA comparison of unpaid care across all authorities in England in both 2011 and 2001 is shown in Map 1 and Map 2 respectively. The darker colours signify higher percentages and the lighter colours lower percentages with the ranges kept constant between 2001 and 2011. The key shows the number of authorities within each range in brackets.\n\nThe maps show a general increase in care provided across most English authorities, with the exception of London boroughs which are largely unchanged. Those areas with higher levels of unpaid care in 2001 were largely similar in 2011, but the extent of care increased. The coastal areas in the East of England, the South West and North West, and the central belt across the East Midlands have the highest concentrations of unpaid care in 2011 which is partly explained by higher concentrations of retired people in these authorities.\n\nMap 1: Prevalence of unpaid carers by local or unitary authority in England, 2011\n\nMap 2: Prevalence of unpaid carers by local or unitary authority in England, 2001\n\nAn interactive map which enables information on the extent of unpaid care to be accessed for each local authority in England and Wales in 2001 and 2011 is available.\n\nNotes for English local authority comparisons - total unpaid care in 2011 and comparison with 2001\n\nPeople with health problems or disabilities which are long-lasting and reduce a person’s ability to carry out the activities people usually do day-to-day, such as house keeping, cooking, paying bills, as well as self-care tasks such as washing and dressing without help. Other limitations include mobility difficulties, reaching, stretching and lifting objects, as well as sight, hearing and communication problems.\n\nIMD Summary score rank is based on the average of LSOA ranks and takes account of material characteristics such as income, environment, housing quality, unemployment, access to services and education.\n\nDisability-free Life Expectancy is an estimate of the average number of years a person would live without a long-standing illness or disability which limits daily activities if he or she experienced the specified population’s age-specific mortality and disability rates for that time period throughout the rest of his or her life.\n\nBack to table of contents\n\n7. English local authority comparisons - provision of 50 or more hours of unpaid care by local authority and 2001 comparisons\n\nAs shown above (Figure 5), there is twice as much total unpaid care provided by the residents of North East Derbyshire compared with the residents of Wandsworth. As care is often related to health problems and disabilities which limited daily activities, it is expected that unpaid care would be higher in those authorities with the highest prevalence of people who are ‘limited a lot’ in daily activities and have older age structures. Figure 6 plots the percentage of an authority’s usual residents who provide 50 hours or more care per week against its percentage of people who are ‘limited a lot’ in daily activities.\n\nFigure 6: Per cent ‘limited a lot’ and per cent providing 50 hours or more unpaid care, by local authority in England in 2011\n\nSource: Census - Office for National Statistics\n\nNotes:\n\nPercentages are rounded values to one decimal place.\n\nFigure 6 shows a consistent increase in the highest levels of care provided (that is 50 or more hours per week) with increases in activity limitation. While this is to be expected, there is clearly an additional burden on relatives, friends and other informal carers in authorities with higher prevalence of activity limitations, such as East Lindsey and Knowsley and, therefore, greater reliance on unpaid carers to support the social care needs of its residents compared to authorities such as the London borough of Wandsworth.\n\nThere is a sizeable contrast in the age structure of Wandsworth and Knowsley (Figure 7), with Wandsworth having a relatively high proportion of its population in the 30-39 age group and relatively low population of state pension age. Conversely, Knowsley has a larger population of state pension age. Wandsworth’s population is also likely to be more transient and therefore less likely to have family links in the immediate vicinity, mitigating the likelihood of local care commitments. Knowsley’s population is more rooted, and has a higher proportion aged 45 and over, a population group at higher risk of both activity limitation and needing to provide care for family members and friends.\n\nFigure 7: Age structure of Wandsworth's and Knowsley's usually resident population at 2011 Census, by sex\n\nSource: Census - Office for National Statistics\n\nNotes:\n\nPercentages are rounded values to one decimal place.\n\nIn terms of the change in those providing 50 hours or more unpaid care between 2001 and 2011, Table 3 ranks authorities on the percentages of their respective usual resident populations which provide 50 hours or more unpaid care in 2011, including the highest and lowest ten. All authorities, other than the City of London, had a growth in absolute numbers. In East Lindsey, the highest authority in 2011 for 50 hours or more unpaid care, the absolute number of carers increased by almost 1,400. Of the top ten authorities, eight were concentrated in the northern regions or the East Midlands.\n\nConversely, those authorities with the smallest percentages in 2011 were located in London, the university centres of Oxford and Cambridge and the affluent authorities of Elmbridge and Hart. All these authorities had smaller increases in 50 hours or more unpaid care compared with 2001, but all other than the City of London experienced a growth in absolute numbers ranging from 336 unpaid carers in Hart to 822 in Lambeth.\n\nTable 3: Authorities ranked by the highest percentages of 50 hours or more unpaid care provision in 2011 with the percentage of carers in 2001 and the change in unpaid carer numbers\n\nEnglandPer cent1 Local Authority2011 (%)2001 (%)Change in carer number East Lindsey4.13.31,374 Knowsley4.03.5570 St. Helens3.73.01,217 Halton3.63.1870 Blackpool3.63.1696 Torbay3.62.81,102 Bolsover3.53.5206 Tendring3.52.81,060 Sunderland3.53.01,262 Rotherham3.43.01,478 Elmbridge1.41.2431 Hart1.41.1336 Lambeth1.41.3822 Hammersmith and Fulham1.41.2555 Oxford1.41.3405 Wandsworth1.31.2758 Cambridge1.31.1340 Richmond upon Thames1.31.1475 Kensington and Chelsea1.21.0438 City of London0.91.1-12 Sources: 2001 Census, 2011 Census 1.

Care provision for small area groupings in England and Wales\n\nThe inequality that exists between populations is often explained in terms of area disadvantage. Measures of health status such as life expectancy and health expectancy are shown to be more favourable in some geographical locations than others and to be strongly patterned with material factors such as income, environment, housing quality, unemployment, access to services and education. These factors can be brought together into an index (such as the English Indices of Deprivation which can be applied to small areas such as lower super output areas (LSOAs) to give a measure of relative material disadvantage experienced by a specific area compared with other areas.\n\nIn order to present a picture of unpaid care and the scale of inequality that exists between population groupings, these small areas are amalgamated, on the basis of their relative level of disadvantage. The Index of Multiple Deprivation 2004 and 2010 in England, and the Welsh Index of Multiple Deprivation 2005 and 2011 in Wales, are used to group areas into tenths (deciles). Percentages of unpaid care are then calculated for these deciles.\n\nIn England there were 32,844 LSOAs with enumerated populations in 2011; use of the ONS Census Geography lookup file enables the total number of census LSOAs to be assigned an Indices of Deprivation 2010 score. LSOAs were then ranked according to their level of deprivation and grouped into tenths (deciles), with each decile consisting of approximately 3,284 LSOAs.\n\nIn Wales there were 1,909 LSOAs enumerated in the 2011 Census; the use of the ONS lookup file enables the total number of census LSOAs to be assigned a WIMD 2011 rank so that nine deciles in Wales consisted of 191 areas, and one decile 190 areas.\n\nIn England, the difference in the percentage of unpaid care between the most and least deprived areas is modest, with levels of care lower in the more deprived areas at both time points. Between 2001 and 2011, the level of care has remained largely flat among the three most deprived area deciles, but increases have occurred in the least deprived deciles (Figure 9).\n\nFigure 9: Percent providing unpaid care by LSOA IMD deciles, England 2001 and 2011\n\nSource: Census - Office for National Statistics\n\nNotes:\n\nIndex of Multiple Deprivation 2004.\n\nIndex of Multiple Deprivation 2010.\n\nIn descending order of deprivation, i.e decile 1 represents the most deprived ten per cent of Lower Super Output Areas in England and decile 10 represents the least deprived ten per cent of Lower Super Output Areas in England.\n\nPercentages are rounded to one decimal place.\n\nIn Wales percentages of unpaid care for each decile were higher than those in England (Figure 10). As with England, unpaid care was slightly lower in the more deprived deciles in both 2001 and 2011. Only decile 3 experienced a slight fall in unpaid care between 2001 and 2011, with the greatest increases occurring from the middle to the least deprived deciles.\n\nFigure 10: Percent providing unpaid care by LSOA WIMD deciles, Wales 2001, 2011\n\nSource: Census - Office for National Statistics\n\nNotes:\n\nWelsh Index of Multiple Deprivation 2005.\n\nWelsh Index of Multiple Deprivation 2011.\n\nIn descending order of deprivation, i.e decile 1 represents the most deprived ten per cent of Lower Super Output Areas in England and decile 10 represents the least deprived ten per cent of Lower Super Output Areas in England.\n\nPercentages are rounded to one decimal place.\n\nOf interest is the lower level of provision of unpaid care in the more deprived deciles for the last two censuses in both England and Wales. This is surprising given that levels of either ‘Very good’ or ‘Good’ general health are lower in the more deprived deciles and rates of activity limitation are higher. A possible explanation for this could be that people in less deprived areas live longer, and therefore their populations are somewhat older and more at risk of surviving into states of dependency, whereas in the most deprived areas the mortality rate is higher.\n\nAnother potential influence is where care is being provided. Those living in less deprived areas could be providing care for people in more deprived areas, where need is likely to be greater, which would counter any relationship with deprivation. These uncertainties can only be untangled using more detailed census data tables following future releases of multivariate statistics.\n\nFurther analysis will be needed to support this provisional finding by comparing decile age structures and taking account of any future revisions to the English Indices of Deprivation, 2010 and the Welsh Index of Multiple Deprivation, 2011 using 2011 Census data.\n\nBack to table of contents"
