        "text": "Pula (Pula Croatian, Italian Pola) is the largest city in the historical region of Istria in Croatia, and the eighth-largest city in the country, situated at the southern tip of the Istrian peninsula, with a population of 57,460 in 2011.\n\nIt is known for its multitude of ancient Roman buildings, the most famous of which is the Pula Arena, one of the best preserved Roman amphitheaters. The city has a long tradition of wine making, fishing, shipbuilding and tourism. It was the administrative centre of Istria from ancient Roman times until superseded by Pazin in 1991.\n\nThe town is well known for its many surviving buildings from the Roman period, including the auditorium of the century, called the local arena. Arena is one of the best preserved amphitheatres from antiquity and is still used today during the summer film festivals. Two other notable and well-preserved structures are the first century triumphal arch, the Arch of Sergius and the Temple of Apollo built in honor of the first century Roman emperor, Caesar Augustus. It is also possible to ride through the old narrow streets with pavement novel of the city, which were built medieval and Renaissance buildings.\n\nAs a result of its rich political history, Pula is a city with a cultural mix of peoples and languages of the Mediterranean and Central Europe, ancient and contemporary. City architecture reflects these layers of history that have left over the city. Residents are fluent in foreign languages, especially Italian, and German or English."
