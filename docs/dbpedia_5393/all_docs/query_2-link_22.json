        "text": "In 1242, Zagreb (called Gradec at the time) was proclaimed a Free Town of the Kingdom by the Golden Bull of Croatia-Hungary, King Bela IV. Later, in 1557, Zagreb was proclaimed the capital of the Croatian state for the first time . This facilitated the transfer of the Croatian government from Varaždin to Zagreb at the end of the 18th century.\n\nWhen it comes to culture in Croatia, the city of Zagreb is pinnacle of art. It hosts 38 cultural institutions, including 10 city museums, the most significant of which are the Zagreb Municipal Museum, the Museum for Arts and Crafts. and the Museum of Contemporary Art.\n\nPicture: street of Zagreb © Ivo Pervan, ONT Croatie\n\nText: www.zagreb.hr: The City of Zagreb, Official Site"
