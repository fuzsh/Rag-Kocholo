        "text": "Welcome to Botswana\n\nThe Botswana Destination Guide will provide a historical overview, scholarship information, health and safety tips, plus identity-specific resources to ensure students feel prepared with insight and resources for their global experience in Botswana. The information shared below is a bird eye’s view and meant to provide some country-specific context. We encourage students to conduct further research and chat with relevant points of contact including advisors, program leaders, international student services at the host campus, internship coordinators or peers who have traveled to Botswana, to gain a greater understanding of their host country and/or city.\n\nOverview\n\nBotswana is a land-locked country the size of Texas located in Southern Africa and bordering on Namibia, South Africa, Zimbabwe and Zambia. Most of Botswana’s 2,182,719 (July 2015 est.) citizens reside in the eastern portion of the country. The capital city of Gaborone is home to an estimated 247,000 people. Botswana achieved independence from Great Britain in 1966, and is one of the fastest growing economies in the world.\n\nIt has one of the highest standards of economic stability, education and health care in sub-Saharan Africa. The economy is dominated by diamond mining and tourism. Tourism ranks second in Botswana after the diamond industry. Botswana is famous for its wildlife and over 40% of the country is given over to national parks, reserves and private concessions.\n\nTravelers should explore some of the Best Places to Visit in Botswana. Recognized as a World Bank Upper Middle-Income Country, the average Numbeo Cost of Living in Botswana is 45% lower than in the United States (aggregate data for all cities, rent is not taken into account). Renting in Botswana is 72% lower than in the United States. On the micro level, the average cost for a three-course meal for two at a mid-range restaurant is between $19-30 USD (about 200-350P - Botswana Pula) while a meal at an inexpensive one might cost about $3-7 USD. Travelers can also enjoy a movie for around $5USD.\n\nAccording to the Institute of International Education (IIE) Open Doors Report 2017, almost 266 students from the United States studied abroad in Botswana, this is roughly a 4.7% decrease from the previous year recorded.\n\nBotswana’s climate is described as semiarid. It is characterized by warm winters and hot summers. The geography of Botswana is dominated by the Kalahari Desert in the southwest region of the country. The arid climate causes periodic droughts and seasonal winds that can carry sand and dust across the country. There are two main seasons in Botswana, the green season (November - March) and the flood season (June - October). The flood season is most popular for tourists because that is when the floods arrive in the wetlands in the Okavango Delta which makes it the best time for game viewing and boat cruises. The green season is most popular for bird watching. The green season is wet, lust and of course the vegetation is very green! The colors are at their brightest and most vibrant at the end of the season in March and are perfect for photography.\n\nBotswana, although sparsely populated, has a relatively modern and well-maintained transportation infrastructure. The major urban centers, including Gaborone, are connected by paved highways. There are also highways connecting Botswana to its neighbors, including South Africa. There are four international airports and a rail system serving the major towns across the country.\n\nAdditional resources:\n\nCIA World Factbook\n\nLonely Planet Botswana\n\nUS State Department Report on Relations with Botswana\n\nCDC Report on Botswana\n\nCities & Education\n\nIn Botswana there are seven years of schooling in primary education, three years of schooling in junior secondary education, and two years of schooling in senior secondary education.\n\nThe education system at the primary level in Botswana is the joint responsibility of the Ministry of Education and Skills Development (MoESD) and the Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development (MLGRD). Secondary education in Botswana is not mandatory or free. Families must be able to afford private schools in order to provide education for their children. Most schools in Botswana are run by the government because the government serves as the main source of educational funding. The government has started to develop early childhood education facilities to provide education to lower income families.\n\nThe University of Botswana, established in 1982, is the first institution of higher education in Botswana. It is now spread across four campuses in three different cities and serves an average of 14,000 undergraduates across six different faculties. In 2005, the Government initiated a project to build an international university dedicated to the sciences and technology. In 2011, this university, Botswana International University of Science and Technology (BIUST), enrolled its first class. International students from over 15 countries are enrolled at BIUST.\n\nThe capital of Botswana is Gaborone, one of Africa’s fastest-growing cities. It is located in the south close to the South African border. Gaborone is home to one of the offices of the 16-nation Southern African Development Community, which focuses on regional development, economic growth, and poverty relief.\n\nAmerican students interested in public health and environmental sustainability often choose Botswana as their destination choice. In addition to exchange programs, there are also short term programs to Botswana led by study abroad program providers and faculty-led programs affiliated with universities. Some study abroad program providers with programs to Botswana include:\n\nCIEE\n\nISEP\n\nResources to help you prepare for studying in Botswana:\n\nSix Early Lessons from Life in Botswana, Haley Church\n\nAdvice from an Arts and Science Student in Botswana, CIEE\n\nStudy Abroad in Botswana, UCSB EAP\n\nMy Favorite Things About Botswana, Allen Ortega\n\nEvents & Tourism\n\nFor those interested in wildlife and safaris, Botswana is a great destination for study abroad. The flora and fauna of Botswana is a must see! Botswana’s terrain is mostly flat which provides you a sustainable option of participating walking safari tours to see the beauty Botswana has to offer. Walking tours are unique as they provide you an opportunity to not only see but also smell and hear the nature that thrives in wilderness without the smell of diesel or healing the noise engine of a car running.\n\nThe Chobe National Park is one of the most biodiverse parks in Africa and has a population of nearly 50,000 elephants. The Nata Bird Sanctuary is a must-see destination for any bird lover, containing over 165 protected species of birds. The Okavango Delta is a population destination for locals and tourists because it is home to some of the world’s most endangered species of large mammals, including the cheetah, white rhinoceros, black rhinoceros, African wild dog and lion. The Okavango Delta is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage site. Another UNESCO World Heritage site in Botswana worth seeing is Tsodilo, also known as “Louvre of the Desert.” Tsodilo is one of the world’s highest concentrations of rock art comprising over 4,500 preserved paintings.\n\nBotswana has demonstrated a true commitment to conservation of environment, wildlife, and cultural heritage. 38% of its land is protected for wildlife and nature conservation. Those who have a love for the outdoors and wildlife will feel right at home in Botswana!\n\nGaborone is the capital of Botswana. Unless you are traveling by land you will likely fly into Botswana via Gaborone’s international airport located north of the city. Gaborone is one of Africa’s safest city and often described as tranquil. Its downtown is home to the Main Mall and an array of monuments, government buildings and restaurants. Not too far from downtown is the Gaborone Game Reserve, and Kgale Hill which provides amazing panoramic views and sights of monkeys and birds,\n\nRead this two short articles to plan your visit to the capital, Gaborone:\n\nEat, Drink, Explore, Gaborone\n\nExploring Bots One Plate at a Time\n\n(Nice video of Gaborone, Botswana: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_twAHu7T2IU)\n\nDiversity & Inclusion Climate\n\nCapital: Yaounde’\n\nPopulation: 2,214,858\n\nLanguage(s): Setswana 77.3%, Sekalanga 7.4%, Shekgalagadi 3.4%, English (official) 2.8%, Zezuru/Shona 2%, Sesarwa 1.7%, Sembukushu 1.6%, Ndebele 1%, other 2.8% (2011 est.)\n\nReligions:Christian 79.1%, Badimo 4.1%, other 1.4% (includes Baha'i, Hindu, Muslim, Rastafarian), none 15.2%, unspecified 0.3% (2011 est.)\n\nEthnic groups:Tswana (or Setswana) 79%, Kalanga 11%, Basarwa 3%, other, including Kgalagadi and white 7%.\n\nBotswana is home to a number of ethnic groups including the Tswana 79%, Kalanga 11%, Basarwa 3%, and Kgalagadi 3% (2007 est).

The majority of people speak the languages of their respective ethnic groups which include: Kalanga, Kgalagadi, Shona, Mbukushu, and Ndebele.\n\nSetswana is the national language and English is the official language of Botswana. Although it is the official language, as of the 2001 census, less than 3% of the population of Botswana speaks English. Setswana is a Bantu language that is a member of the Niger–Congo language family. The Setswana language also has official status in South Africa and Zimbabwe.The largest population of Setswana speakers are in South Africa, which is Botswana’s neighbor in the southern border.\n\nResources to learn Setswana:\n\nAn Introduction to Setswana Language, Peace Corps\n\nLearn Setswana for Free, Live Language Project\n\nAs a nation Botswana emphasizes nonethnic citizenship and liberal democracy. The dominance of the country led by Tswana political leaders has fostered a nonethnic government where the language and customs of the majority, Tswana are prominent. Batswana is a plural term that represents “people of Botswana.” An individual is referred to as a Motswana.The people of Botswana are prideful and always put their identity as s Motswana first before their ethnic identity.\n\nRead this US Today article on racial harmony in Botswana: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2019/01/31/botswana-offers-u-s-valuable-lesson-achieving-racial-harmony/2731108002/\n\nStaying Healthy & Safe in the Botswana\n\nHealth\n\nHigh quality healthcare is available in the capital city of Gaborone. Outside of the capital however, quality healthcare facilities are not readily available and healthcare services in general are rudimentary. Only about 70% of the population has access to clean water, and less than 60% have access to modern sanitation. Additionally, although the government has taken strides to education and provide services, it is estimated that almost 25% of the population is infected with HIV/AIDS. Students should be aware of the high rate of HIV/AIDS and should always, just like at home or any other country, engage in safe sexual activities.\n\nTuberculosis and malaria are also still a concern in Botswana. Malaria is not an issue in the capital, Gaborone, but if you plan to travel to areas with malaria risk, regions that are about 2 hours, including the Okavango Delta, you will need to prepare malaria pills. Before traveling abroad, make sure you are up to date with your immunizations. Visit the CDC’s website to learn more about the recommended vaccines you may need before traveling to Botswana.\n\nLocals may categorize illnesses as “European” or “African” and will seek remedies and health services accordingly. You do not have to partake in any local health care or remedies that you are not knowledgeable about or feel uncomfortable with even if someone local that you trust vouches for the treatment. If you have access to your physician in the U.S., it may be best to consult with them first before participating in receiving any medical services you are unsure about.\n\nSafety\n\nVisitors should be aware that Botswana received a crime rating of “high” from the U.S. State Department and criminal incidents continue to occur regardless of location. The biggest crime threats remain confrontational thefts. Cell phone, laptop computer, and iPod thefts are increasingly common.\n\nStudents should leave important personal belongings in the safety of their dorms or homes.
