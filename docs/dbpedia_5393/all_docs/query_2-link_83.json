There are three beaches connected to the boardwalk: Valkane, Gortan Cove and Valsaline (Mornar). Near the boardwalk there is a recreational path with exercise devices. There are free parking spaces along the whole length of the boardwalk. During the day, Lungomare is filled with walkers and recreation lovers, and in the evening it becomes filled with young people. We recommend the walk around the magnificent sunset before evening hours. Lungomare Pula\n\nValkane beach Pula Valkane is the most notable and most furnished beach in Pula.
