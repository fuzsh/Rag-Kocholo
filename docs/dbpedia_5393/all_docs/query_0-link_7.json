        "text": "In 2011, Croatia covered 0.54% of Europe, with 0.61% of the population of Europe, and only 0.06% of the world’s population. It also had a slightly higher average population density than Europe. With 75.7 people per square km, it was slightly more densely populated than Europe as a whole (68.6 per km2). However, Western Europe is significantly more populated than Croatia, with an average of 165 people per km2, while Eastern Europe (45 per km2), and especially Northern/Scandinavian Europe (25 per km2) are much less densely populated. Of the 45 European countries, in 2011 Croatia ranked 25th in size, and 28th in population size (25th in 2001), which means that 27 countries had larger populations. Croatia ranked only 37th in terms of population density. When compared to the entire inhabited world, Croatia is an averagely populated country, since the average population density, including the sub-ecumene, is 47.3 people per km2. On a global scale, Croatia is ranked 123rd in size, and 117th in population size. Inhabitance in Croatia is not uniform. The most populated counties are those of northwest Croatia, significantly above the country’s average, while Pannonian and Adriatic Croatia are more or less the same, and rather less inhabited (fewer than 60 people per km2). Some narrow parts of Adriatic Croatia are populated above the average, as well as zones of larger cities and their urban regions in the continent. The least populated parts of Croatia are the mountainous areas, where population size and density have been decreasing for quite some time.Today’s relatively homogeneous population profile in the Republic of Croatia within existing borders, where Croats comprised a large majority in 1991, with a population of 3,736,356 , or 78.1% and 3,986,000, or 89.6% in 2001, is the result of continuous retreat, especially in the face of very aggressive waves of immigrants from the East.According to the last census of 2011, the percentage of Croats had increased to 90.4%, although their numbers had somewhat decreased (3,874,321). As well, 86.3% of the population (2011) profess to be Roman Catholics. The population in Croatia, according to the 2011 Census, is distributed among 6,756 settlements, the components of 127 towns and 429 municipalities in 21 counties (including the City of Zagreb), that is two 2nd level European statistical regions. At that time, 523 villages had fewer than ten residents, and 150 were no longer inhabited. Almost two-thirds of the settlements in Croatia (4,120) had fewer than 200 inhabitants. Croatia has 204 urban settlements or settlements with town characteristics, and 6,552 settlements with predominantly rural and mixed features, including about 7,500 village units or hamlets. In 2011, there were more than 200 urban settlements in Croatia, but only one had more than 500,000 inhabitants – Zagreb, 688,163 (City of Zagreb, 790,017, including Sesvete, 54,085 etc.). Two cities had between 100,000 and 200,000 – Split, 167,121 (City of Split, 178,102) and Rijeka 128,314 (City of Rijeka, 128,624) - while five cities had between 50,000 and 100,000 - more prominent Osijek, 83,104 (City of Osijek, 108,048) and Zadar, 71,471 (City of Zadar, 75,062) and less prominent Pula, 57,460 (City of Pula 57,460), Slavonski Brod, 53,531 (City of Slavonski Brod, 59,141) and Karlovac, 46,833 (City of Karlovac, 55,705). Eight cities and towns had between 25,000 and 50,000 inhabitants in 2011: Varaždin, Šibenik, Sisak, Vinkovci, Velika Gorica, Dubrovnik, Bjelovar and Vukovar."
