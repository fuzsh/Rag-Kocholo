        "text": "Poreč (Parenzo, Parents or Parentium) is a town in Croatia located on the west coast of the peninsula of Istria.\n\nPoreč is at 45.2258 degrees north latitude and 13.593 degrees eastern length. It lies at an altitude of 29 meters.\n\nThe city, which is almost two thousand years old, is located in the harbor which is protected by the isle of St. Nicholas. In the city itself according to the population census in 2011 there are 9.790 inhabitants, most of them live in suburbs. The city of Poreč, as a whole, has a total of 16,696 inhabitants according to the same 2011 census. The town of Poreč belongs to three islands and / or islets classified as MPNN (small, occasional and uninhabited islands and islets): Altijež, Regata, Sveti Nikola and six smaller altitudes (curves of different shapes and sizes): Barbaran, Butaceja , Karbula, Safarel, Žontuja and Žontujić.\n\nAlthough unknown outside the borders of Europe, Poreč has been one of the main centers of Croatian tourism since the 1970s. Poreč's thirty hotels, 13 campsites, nudist camps, 16 apartment complexes, villas, bungalows and family houses. It's an incredible number given the size of the city itself. The tourist infrastructure is deliberately scattered along the 37-kilometer coast between Mirna and the Lim Channel. In the south there are large independent centers like Blue Laguna, Green Laguna, White Cove and Brulo. To the north are Materada, Cervar Porat, Ulika and Lanterna. More than 30% of tourists are staying here on the west coast of Istria as the most intensive tourist destination in Croatia. This summer \"suburb\" has its own hotels, beaches, campsites, marinas, department stores, transportation facilities, playgrounds, entertainment and various shops. In the summer season in Porestina, there are also 120,000 people temporarily. As people swim outside the city during the day, in the evening there is a tourist boom in the old town, which is then full of walkers from all European countries, and services are offered to them by shops, restaurants, disco clubs and bars, as well as numerous galleries.\n\nPula may not be the largest city of Croatia, but it takes the 8th spot when it comes to size and is the largest city of Istria with population counting 57, 460 citizens and more. What makes Pula distinctive among other Croatian cities is its tradition of winemaking, fishing, shipbuilding, and booming tourism. In addition, it has also been Istria's administrative centre since ancient Roman times. While to an unobserving eye Pula may seem like a usual workday city, wealthy Roman architecture makes Pula stand out not just in Croatia, but worldwide. The star of the show is the remarkably well-preserved Roman amphitheatre, smack in the heart of the city, which dominates the streetscape and doubles as a venue for summer concerts and festivals.\n\nAmphitheatre: Pula’s most famous and imposing sight situated in the heart of the city is this 1st-century oval amphitheatre, which lies above the harbour northeast of the old town. This mesmerizing construction, made completely out of local limestone, is called the Arena by locals and tourists alike. Throughout history it was used for hosting gladiatorial contests. With the capacity to accommodate around 20,000 spectators. Nowadays, Arena represents Istria's popular tourist attraction, but it is also the place of mass entertainment events, such as concerts and competitions.\n\nLightning Giants: A sight not to be missed while visiting Pula is its star evening attraction, a lighting display at the city's 19th-century Uljanik shipyard, regarded as one of the world's oldest working docks. Renowned lighting designer Dean Skira has lit up the shipyard's iconic cranes in 16,000 different colour shades, which bring them to life four times every evening on the specified hour and last for 15 minutes.\n\nTemple of the Augustus: While this temple is the only visible remnant from the Roman era on the Forum, it was regarded as Pula’s central meeting place from antiquity through the Middle Ages, and it has still preserved this function today. The temple, whose building process took a lot of time to finish, from 2 BC to AD 14, is open to public throughout the year, now housing a small museum of Roman sculpture with the occasional temporary show.\n\nZerostrasse: This underground system of tunnels was built before and during WWI to shelter the city's population and serve as storage for ammunition. Now tourists can walk through several of its sections, which all lead to the middle, where a photo exhibition shows early aviation in Pula.\n\nTriumphal Arch of Sergii: While it cannot bear the title of the oldest Roman monument, this triumphal arch that was built in honor of the powerful Sergii family’s participation in the pivotal Battle of Actium in France. It dates to about 30 BC and despite its great age. The arch has preserved its shape till today.. When it was built the arch was a city gate leading up from the naval port. Carved into the stone are friezes depicting cupids and garlands, and just beneath this you can still spot a relief of a horse-drawn battle chariot.\n\nKastel, a Venetian fortress overlooking Pula, dates from the 1600s. The powerful-looking walls which leave every visitor speechless were designed in a star configuration, which was a state-of-the-art design in order to repel artillery after the arrival of gunpowder. Kastel was created with the purpose to serve as Venetians’ main stronghold, defending Pula’s harbour as well as the entire upper Adriatic.\n\nSituated inside the Austro-Hungarian fortress Verudela, Pula’s Aquarium is regarded as the largest in Croatia. The aquarium is a useful option for rainy days or the hottest afternoons in summer, as well as a magnificent place for those traveling with children. Blending neatly with the fort’s stone architecture, tanks with freshwater and marine species native to Croatia and the Adriatic, together with tropical displays, a turtle rescue centre (the only one to be found in Croatia) and an entire room devoted to sea horses, are an unforgettable sight. The centerpiece of the attraction is the shark tank, which is found in the former atrium of the fortress.\n\nHistorical attractions aside, Pula is a busy commercial city on the sea that has managed to retain a friendly small-town appeal. It is conveniently located and with a short bus ride, a series of beaches can be reached at the resorts that occupy the Verudela Peninsula to the south. Further south along the indented shoreline, the Premantura Peninsula hides a spectacular nature park, the protected cape of Kamenjak."
