        "text": "Discussion\n\nThe skeletal sample from Pula comprises the minimum of 48 individuals. Such a number of samples are susceptible to random statistical variation (Bedić et al., 2013), especially when analysing individual pathologies of a smaller sample size. For this reason, the discussion and interpretation of the results of this analysis have to be taken with caution.\n\nThe demographic distribution is evenly split between the adults and subadults. Childhood, especially infancy, is considered a period of life with increased mortality (Manifold, 2014). Some estimates place subadult mortality in pre-industrial societies (including Roman period populations) at approximately 50% (Pearce, 2001). Subadult mortality is considered an important indicator of the level of development and overall health of the population (Gonzalez & Gilleskie, 2017; Esmaeilzadeh et al., 2021). Nowadays, subadult mortality is in a constant decline, but it is still more prevalent in developing countries due to unfavourable hygienic, economic, and social conditions (Esmaeilzadeh et al., 2021). In 2020, infant mortality rate was 0.4% in Croatia and 0.3% in the European Union (Rodin et al., 2021). In comparison, the subadult mortality under one year of age in Pula is much higher (50% of subadults and 25% of the total sample). This is typical of ancient populations where infant mortality is estimated between 30 and 40% (Scheidel et al., 2008; Caroll, 2011; Pilkington, 2013), mostly because of exposure to the disease and malnutrition. The overall high frequency of subadult burials in Pula is also consistent with the prevalence of subadult burials in other Roman period sites, where subadults make up 20–40% of the sample (Pearce, 2001; Novak, 2008; Novak & Šlaus, 2010a, Caroll, 2011).\n\nGenerally speaking, life expectancy in the Roman world is estimated to be around 20 to 30 years, depending on the region and the socioeconomic conditions of the population (Scheidel et al., 2008). In archaeological sites on the Croatian territory, the average age at death is between 30 and 45 years (Novak, 2008; Bedić, 2017; Hincak & Zglav Martinac, 2016; Vyroubal & Bedić, 2020; Šlaus 2021). Most adults in the Pula sample died between the ages of 20 and 35, which is slightly younger than other Croatian sites from this period, but this difference is nonsignificant and likely due to the small sample size. Overall, it seems that the skeletal sample from Pula, by its demographic characteristics, is not different from other Roman period assemblages from the region (Novak, 2008; Bedić et al., 2013).\n\nDental pathologies, especially caries, occur in high frequency in Pula, affecting females slightly more than males, but this difference is minimal and insignificant, and possibly because of a small sample size. The diet in the Roman period was based on grains (mostly in the form of wheat porridge/puls, bread, millet, and barley) with mostly vegetables and fruit as an addition – this type of diet, consisting mainly of carbohydrates, is typical of a society whose economy is based on agriculture (Scheidel et al., 2008; Bedić et al., 2009). Carious lesions during the Roman period (including Croatian sites) occur with low frequency – usually less than 10% of teeth (Manzi et al., 1999; Bonfiglioli et al., 2003; Šlaus, 2006; Novak, 2008; Bedić et al., 2009; Diéguez Ramírez et al., 2017; Vyroubal & Bedić, 2020; Vergidou et al., 2021). In comparison, the frequency of caries in Pula is twice as high as expected for the period. This may also be due to the small sample size, but it may also result from poor dietary habits with low-quality and cariogenic foods, such as carbohydrates (Newbrun, 1979; Giacaman, 2018) (e.g. millet porridge).\n\nAlveolar disease and tooth loss can result from dental plaque and caries (Bonfiglioli et al., 2003; Šlaus 2006). In the Roman Empire, dentistry was, generously stated, still in its infancy. Dental medicine consisted mainly of pain management by taking opium, saffron, and other remedies. Tooth removal was avoided and performed in case of crown destruction or infection (Fejerskov et al., 2012). These practices could easily lead to the development of a tooth abscess or other complications. The prevalence of abscesses and AMTL is low in Pula (5.3%). This makes sense given the high mortality of younger individuals at the site, as the development of severe alveolar disease requires time (Bonfiglioli et al., 2003). Individuals in Pula probably died before caries could spread and cause an infection that led to tooth loss. This is confirmed by the fact that almost all cases of caries in Pula were mild (category one or two) and affected less than half of the tooth surface. The prevalence of AMTL in Pula is consistent with other Roman period populations from the region, generally under 10% (Šlaus, 2006; Novak, 2008; Vyroubal & Bedić, 2020).\n\nLinear enamel hypoplasia (LEH) is a good indicator of metabolic stress in childhood (Littleton & Townsend, 2005; Novak et al., 2009; Dąbrowski et al., 2021). In the Pula sample, LEH is present in almost all examined incisors and canines, representing a very high prevalence of enamel defects in this population. In other Croatian Roman period populations, LEH is present in approximately 40-60% (Šlaus, 2006; Bedić, 2017; Vyroubal & Bedić, 2020) of the studied teeth. Considering this, we can presume there were certain factors in Pula that contributed to the widespread physiological stress during childhood. This high frequency is probably not related to the small sample size, as the defects were consistently present in every individual. High rates of LEH were linked to the increased physiological stress in the population because of disease, nutritional deficiencies (Littleton & Townsend, 2005; Dąbrowski et al., 2021), lifestyle based on agriculture, increase in population (Cohen & Armelagos, 1984) and population aggregation (Ham et al., 2020). This stress could result from weaning when children transition from consuming breast milk to other foods that contain microorganisms that can cause digestive distress, reduce appetite, and cause nutritional deficiencies. Depending on the food, nutrient deficiencies can also be caused by a sudden switch to an unbalanced grain-based diet (Manifold, 2014). Individuals with LEH may have a shorter life expectancy than people without these defects, as stress exposure in early life is found to be associated with higher mortality in earlier life stages (Littleton & Townsend, 2005; Stutz et al., 2021). Lower socioeconomic status and poor living conditions that caused LEH are likely to persist into adulthood and that continuous stress could contribute to the individual’s earlier death. Furthermore, malnutrition and illnesses in childhood may weaken the individual’s immune system, making them more susceptible to other diseases later in life (Šlaus 2006).\n\nLEH appears to be associated with an increased risk of caries development. Research on the children from the US in the 1990s found a positive correlation between LEH and caries, as weakened tooth enamel is more sensitive and more susceptible to bacteria colonisation (Hong et al., 2009). It is interesting that in the same study, LEH defects occurred in only 3.9% of subadults showing the low prevalence of LEH in the modern world, especially when compared to Roman period Pula. The high LEH prevalence in Pula points to the poor living conditions and widespread metabolic stress in childhood during the weaning phase and the transition to solid foods (first to third year of life, when the enamel of permanent teeth is formed) (Cunningham et al., 2016). LEH is probably the contributing factor leading to relatively high caries rates and is probably related to the high mortality in younger individuals in the Roman period Pula.\n\nCribra orbitalia is mostly associated with anaemia and iron deficiency, but various other conditions could also cause such lesions (Wapler et al., 2004; Šlaus, 2006; Brickley, 2018). In Pula, CO occurs only in subadults. Subadults are more susceptible to anaemia because of higher iron requirements due to rapid growth (Özdemir, 2015). Changes in diet, insufficient diet, parasites and diseases can also lead to the occurrence of anaemia (Facchini et al., 2004; Šlaus, 2006; Gebreweld et al., 2019). The frequency of CO in subadults in Pula is 27.3%, which is lower compared to other Roman-era sites where CO is present with 40–60% (Facchini et al., 2004; Novak & Šlaus 2010b). The absence of CO in adults from Pula could indicate severe acute illness that led to the death of the individual before any marks could form on the bone (Pine et al. 2009).\n\nThe widespread presence of porotic hyperostosis and possible cases of scurvy and rickets also shows a high level of physiological stress in the studied population (Šlaus, 2006; Rohnbogner, 2015). Scurvy is associated with vitamin C deficiency (Gandhi et al., 2023) and rickets with vitamin D deficiency (Sahay & Sahay 2012). Possible scurvy recorded in Pula points to poor living conditions – the individuals likely had a lower socioeconomic status and did not have access to balanced and varied food. Most of the graves discovered at the Ozad Arene site were burials in stone tombs covered with roof tiles and were usually reserved for the poorer citizens of the Roman society (Godinović, 2021).\n\nThe “sabre shin tibia” is an isolated find in the bone assemblage E4-SJ049 containing multiple individuals – no other similarly sized bones or bones showing similar pathological changes were unearthed. Due to the isolated nature of the find, and the mild deviation of the bone, any diagnosis of specific causes (such as syphilis, rickets or other metabolic diseases) is not viable.\n\nInfectious diseases are one of the major causes of death in archaeological populations, particularly in childhood (Ortner & Putschar, 1981). Since in most cases specific diseases cannot be identified, these diseases are grouped as non-specific diseases that manifest themselves in a form of periostitis (Ortner & Putschar, 1981; Bedić et al., 2013). Periostitis can also occur due to number of other conditions, including trauma, infections, metabolic, congenital and genetic conditions (Pilloud & Schwitalla, 2020). Periostitis is common in Roman period sites in Croatia, especially in subadults with a frequency between 50 and 70% (Šlaus, 2006; Novak, 2008, Bedić, 2017). In Pula, only 25% of the subadults had periostitis, which is surprising considering the high prevalence of other conditions pointing to poor living conditions. As in the case of CO, it is possible that severe acute illness caused an individual’s death before periostitis changes on the bones could form. Bone fragmentation and relatively poor preservation of the cortex may also contribute to the underrepresentation of periostitis in Pula.\n\nAs a result of disc herniation (Kyere et al., 2012), Schmorl’s nodes in archaeological populations are associated with the mechanical load of the spine (Faccia & Williams, 2008; Bedić et al., 2013) and heavy labour (Hincak & Zglav Martinac, 2016). In Pula, their prevalence is twice as high as the prevalence in the composite Roman period Croatian sample (Novak, 2008). While it is possible that the Roman period inhabitants of Pula performed more physically demanding activities than their contemporaries, it is more likely that this difference results from the random statistical variation due to a small sample size.\n\nIn Croatian archaeological samples from the Roman period, males exhibit significantly higher prevalence of spinal alterations, which points to clear division of labour, where the males were engaged in more physically demanding tasks (Šlaus, 2006; Novak 2008; Vyroubal & Bedić, 2020). Therefore, it is interesting to note that there is no difference in the overall frequency of Schmorl’s nodes between the sexes in Pula. These results could be influenced by the small number of identified males and females at the site (the sex of the most adult individuals could not be established) and should be taken with caution. The absence of a difference in the frequency of Schmorl’s nodes between sexes suggests that both sexes were equally included in physically demanding work. However, it is likely that there was some sort of division in the types of tasks performed by males and females. Females exhibit Schmorl’s nodes on the cervical vertebrae which are absent in males. This could be attributed to the practice of carrying heavy loads on the head, as those activities have been found to contribute to the accentuated degenerative changes in the cervical spine (Joosab et al., 1994; Dave et al., 2021). Occupational activities involving lifting heavy loads have been thought to increase the risk of spine degeneration, with some evidence linking occupational heavy labour with disc degradation and disc bulging (Macedo & Battié, 2019). Back and, to the lesser extent, neck pain has been linked to the disc degeneration due to various factors including aging and occupational activities – with disc disease in the lumbar spine causing pain because of heavy lifting, and frequent spine bending and twisting (Williams & Sambrook, 2011).\n\nOsteoarthritic changes are a commonly found in archaeological populations and associated with the aging process. Today, OA is primarily associated with older individuals who have surpassed the age of 60 (Loeser, 2011), but OA changes can occur as early as the age of 40 (Šlaus, 2006). In the Roman period Pula, OA was present in the number of younger individuals around the age of 30. Lumbar vertebrae were most affected, suggesting that hard physical labour may be a contributing factor. When compared to other Roman period Croatian samples (around 10-15% (Šlaus, 2006; Bedić, 2017)) it is evident that the occurrence of spinal OA is more widespread in Pula. When compared, the prevalence of spinal OA in females in Pula is four times higher than in other similar samples (the results should be taken with caution as they could be impacted by the small number of identified males and females in the sample). The reason for this difference is not clear. Maybe females in the Roman period Pula were doing more strenuous labour, but it is also likely that the difference is due to the statistical variation because of the small number of females in the sample. We cannot tell with certainty whether age played a significant role (and to what extent) because of the mentioned sample size, but also due to an almost non-existent difference in average age between the sexes in Pula.\n\nIn Pula, bone fractures were not a common find, with only five recorded cases in total. All fractures were well healed, most likely occurring long before the death of the affected individual. The bones healed in more or less anatomically correct positions, thus indicating the possibility of medical treatment such as the realignment and immobilisation of the affected bone. Low number of long bone trauma is consistent with the data observed in other Roman period populations (Novak & Šlaus, 2010a; Vyroubal & Bedić, 2020). In Pula, the prevalence of skull fractures (3.6%) is notably lower than other Roman period Croatian samples (15-28%) (Novak, 2008; Novak & Šlaus, 2010a; Vyroubal & Bedić, 2020). Bone fractures can result from intentional violence or from accidents and/or occupational activities (Walker, 1989; Dittmar et al., 2021). Two cases of a distal ulna fracture in Pula could be possible indicators of violence as such fractures usually occur as a result of a defensive reflex where the person raises their arm to protect the face and head from the attacker (Šlaus, 2006, 2021). Facial and cranial fractures are also indicative of potential acts of violence, as the head is an attractive target for the attacker due to the nigh-instantaneous incapacitating effect on the victim (Walker, 1997). The potential cause of the frontal bone injury in Pula could not be established because of the fracture being discovered in the mass bone assemblage. However, this fracture could have also resulted from a fall and/or some other accident.\n\nIn one case, multiple congenital anomalies of the sternum were found. These anomalies were most likely asymptomatic and were medically insignificant. The variations in the sternal anatomy are relatively common and are asymptomatic in most cases (Choi et al., 2017; Gans et al, 2021). They can be found in 4-14% of modern populations (Choi et al., 2017; Sungur et al., 2020; Gans et al, 2021). The formation of the sternal foramen occurs due to the incomplete fusion of segments during foetal development (Choi et al., 2017).\n\nThe occurrence of two bifid ribs is an interesting find. Rib anomalies are a relatively common occurrence, occurring in approximately 2% of the human population, with bifid ribs being one of the more common anatomical anomalies (Andrea et al. 2016; Rajić Šikanjić et al., 2017). This anomaly probably occurs because of incomplete fusion of the sclerotomes during embryonic development (Rathinasabapathi & Perumallapalli, 2015). Usually, it is unilateral and occurs as an independent anatomical variation. However, in rare cases, it may occur in more complex conditions, such as the Gorlin-Goltz syndrome, Jobs syndrome, or Kindler syndrome (Rathinasabapathi & Perumallapalli, 2015; Rajić Šikanjić et al., 2017; Tsoucalas et al., 2019; Galassi et al., 2023). In Pula, both individuals that had bifid ribs were well-preserved, with most skeletal elements present. As no other major skeletal pathologies were found, bifid ribs were most likely the result of individual and pathologically insignificant anatomic variations.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe human skeletal sample from the Ozad Arene site in Pula comprises the remains of a minimum of 48 individuals. Based on its demographic characteristics, this skeletal sample represents a typical Roman period population from the region. The prevalence of caries in Pula is higher than expected for the period, probably due to the diet based on grain likely in the form of bread and porridge. That, in combination with poor oral hygiene, contributed to the development of the disease. The frequency of linear enamel hypoplasia is significantly higher compared to other Roman period populations indicating overall poor living conditions and widespread metabolic stress during childhood. The presence of cribra orbitalia, porotic hyperostosis, and possible cases of scurvy and rickets further support the idea of increased metabolic stress during childhood that likely persisted into the adulthood. The studied individuals from Pula probably belonged to a lower socioeconomic status, lacking access to a well-balanced and sufficiently nutritious diet. The relatively low number of cases of periostitis and CO could indicate the possibility of severe acute illnesses that could lead to a quick death of the individuals. The presence of Schmorl’s nodes and osteoarthritis changes indicate a continuous mechanical strain on the spine due to hard physical labour. Skeletal traumas are infrequent in Roman period Pula, suggesting that violence was not prevalent within the community.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe authors would like to thank Mario Novak from the Institute for Anthropological Research for the assistance and help in laboratory analysis and writing of the paper.\n\nReferences\n\nAndrea, A., Tardieu, G., Fisahn, C., Iwanaga, J., Oskouian, R.J., & Tubbs, R.S.
