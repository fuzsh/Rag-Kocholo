        "text": "Where is Croatia?\n\nCroatia is a Central European and Mediterranean country, bordering Slovenia to the west, Hungary to the north, Serbia to the east and Bosnia and Herzegovina to the south; the country also has a long maritime border with Italy in the Adriatic Sea. These borders total 2,028 km altogether.\n\nCroatia has an unusual shape (similar to a croissant!) that is unlike any other country in the world. This unusual shape is as a result of five centuries of expansion by the Ottoman (Turkish) empire towards Central Europe. (Although having said this, the Turks never actually conquered the country; they did however control some of Croatia’s neighbours such as Serbia and Bosnia and Hercegovina.) If you’re interested, we have more on Croatia’s past on our history of Croatia page.\n\nCroatia covers a land area of 56,691 square kilometres and has a population of 3.88 million people (2021 census – quite a fall from 4.29 million people recorded in the 2011 census). Almost 90% of the population is Croat (the majority of whom are Roman Catholics) and there are also Serbian, Bosnian, Hungarian and Italian minorities.\n\nMain towns and cities in Croatia\n\nThe main population centres are Zagreb, the capital (with a population of about 770,000), Osijek in the northeast (population: 97,000), and the ports of Rijeka (population: 108,000) on the northern part of the coastline, and Split (population: 160,000) towards the south. Other well-known towns and cities include Dubrovnik, Makarska, Porec, Rovinj, Opatija, Zadar and Sibenik.\n\nCroatia has an amazing 5,835km of coastline, 4,057km of which belongs to islands, cliffs and reefs. There are 1,244 islands and islets in the Adriatic, although only about 50 are populated. The largest island is Krk (near Rijeka) which has a land area of 462 square km, whilst other famous islands include Hvar, Brac, Korcula and Pag.\n\nCroatian language\n\nCroatian is the official language, which is written in the Latin script. The Croatian alphabet has 30 letters – all the letters of the English language, minus the q, w, x, and y but with the addition of č, ć, dž, đ, lj, nj, š and ž. See our Croatian for Travellers section for a more detailed guide and an introduction to the Croatian language!\n\nClimate and Weather\n\nThe climate is Mediterranean along the Adriatic coast, meaning warm dry summers and mild winters, with 2,600 hours of sunlight on average yearly – it is one of the sunniest coastlines in Europe! The interior of the country has a continental climate with hot summers and cold, snowy winters.\n\nTo learn more about Croatia, take a look at:\n\nHistory of Croatia\n\nHistory of this part of Europe and of the Croatian people\n\nCroatia Today\n\nThe political situation in present-day Croatia\n\nCroatian Flag & Anthem\n\nSee and listen to the national flag and anthem of Croatia\n\nTop Souvenirs from Croatia\n\nFind out what typically Croatian products to buy to take home for yourself or to give as gifts\n\nFamous Symbols of Croatia\n\nLearn about some of the things that Croatia is famous for, including the cravat, Maraschino liquer and the Dalmatian dog\n\n15 Things You May Not Know About Croatia\n\nA humorous look at some famous and not-so-famous things about the country\n\nCroatian Sports Teams & People\n\nIncluding Croatian football, tennis and skiing\n\nFamous Croats\n\nOther famous people from Croatia (or of Croatian descent), including those from science, literature, entertainment and other fields\n\nCroatia at the Eurovision Song Contest\n\nFind out how Croatia has fared over the years in the best song contest of all time\n\nFilming Locations in Croatia\n\nFind out where famous big and small screen productions – including Game of Thrones and Star Wars – were filmed in Croatia\n\nCroatian Cuisine\n\nLearn what dishes can be commonly found in the country\n\nWhat Other People Say About Croatia\n\nRead some articles on Croatia through the years to find out more about the country\n\nTop Facts\n\nPopulation 3.8 million (2021 census)\n\nCapital Zagreb\n\nOther main cities (by population) Split, Rijeka, Osijek\n\nLanguage Croatian, using the Latin alphabet\n\nCurrency Euro (as of 1 January 2023)\n\nArea 56,691 square kilometres\n\nMain religion Roman Catholic\n\nMain ethnic group Croatian (almost 90% of the population is Croatian)"
