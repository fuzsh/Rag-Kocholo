        "text": "Suppose that an arbitrary electric circuit with a network of capacitors is connected to a d.c. e.m.f. device. Herein we address several related questions. What is the equivalent capacitance of the network? What is the voltage and charge on each capacitor? How long will it take to charge the network and will all capacitors be charged at the same time? Finally, the most challenging among these questions: how, in fact, are capacitors being charged? We answer these questions using theory and experiment adapted to the undergraduate level.\n\nACS Style\n\nVelimir Labinac; Marko Jusup; Tarzan Legovic; Ljubomir Spiric.

To increase the accuracy of the oxygen utilization assessment, we developed linear (L-MOD) and non-linear models (NL-MOD) for the dynamics of decomposition and accumulation of the organic matter, oxygen utilization and ammonium production. The models are based on mass-balance stoichiometric reactions for conversion of organic matter into bacterial biomass under aerobic conditions. Organic matter is represented by a general chemical formula sensitive to protein, carbohydrate and lipid content. The mass of organic matter is expressed in chemical oxygen demand (COD) units, providing more convenient tracking of oxygen utilization. Degradable part of the organic matter is distinguished from a non-degradable part. The model results are compared with the data sets from simulated aquaculture pond experiment.\n\nThe aim of our study is to expand the world-wide knowledge about pollutant transport in sediments of medium-sized meandering rivers and to explain barium distribution in Kupa River (Croatia), as it showed as an ideal “natural laboratory”. Sampling was performed twice at the same places with the time span of 15 years to see the changes in Ba concentrations after that period. Ba was analyzed using ICP-MS method on clay + silt sediment fraction (<63 µm). Modelling was performed in R environment (R version 3.5.1, 2018) and for solving the sediment transport equation of Ba in Kupa River a program based on finite differences is constructed. After barite mine ceased operation in 1990, Ba is still entering Kupica and Kupa rivers, as karstic underground still contains large amounts of barite waste. Ba concentrations in Kupa River sediments are still increasing consequently along the whole river length, except in Kupica River and first downstream sample in Kupa River. It seems that in this part of river course erosion exceeded deposition processes. Also, there is an indication of changing the way of underground Ba transport. Erosion and deposition processes lead to formation of peak of Ba concentrations in the lower course of the Kupa River. Most important conclusion is that the mentioned peak was formed under one or two flood episodes, when sediment eroded from the upstream locations and was brought and deposited in the lower course of the river. Our modelling predicts that Ba source will not cease completely during the next 20 years.\n\nThe electrochemical method of polarographic maximum based on the interfacial instability of a positively charged interface dropping mercury electrode/sea-water, allows a direct characterization of single events of coalescence and transformation of aggregates of fluid surfactants into adsorbed monolayers at the interface (relaxation times 10 – 500 ms, aggregation numbers > 109). Highly surface active aggregates, resembling those of unsaturated lipids, were detected in the sea surface microlayer samples and in the mixing layers in the estuaries, although the unsaturated lipids represent only a minor fraction (<10%) of the aquatic organic matter. Products of flocculation of dissolved organic matter during estuarine mixing resemble closely fluid vesicles released by marine microflagellate, such as Dunaliella tertiolecta, that was studied in a greater detail. The analysis of complex electrochemical responses in natural heterodispersion is developed using artificial dispersions of oleate and methyl oleate in sea-water, as models.\n\nRecent research in machine learning pointed to the core problem of state-of-the-art models which impedes their widespread adoption in different domains. The models’ inability to differentiate between noise and subtle, yet significant variation in data leads to their vulnerability to adversarial perturbations that cause wrong predictions with high confidence. The study is aimed at identifying whether the algorithms inspired by biological evolution may achieve better results in cases where brittle robustness properties are highly sensitive to the slight noise. To answer this question, we introduce the new robust gradient descent inspired by the stability and adaptability of biological systems to unknown and changing environments. The proposed optimization technique involves an open-ended adaptation process with regard to two hyperparameters inherited from the generalized Verhulst population growth equation. The hyperparameters increase robustness to adversarial noise by penalizing the degree to which hardly visible changes in gradients impact prediction. The empirical evidence on synthetic and experimental datasets confirmed the viability of the bio-inspired gradient descent and suggested promising directions for future research. The code used for computational experiments is provided in a repository at https://github.com/yukinoi/bio_gradient_descent.\n\nLoggerhead turtle is an endangered sea turtle species with a migratory lifestyle and worldwide distribution, experiencing markedly different habitats throughout its lifetime. Environmental conditions, especially food availability and temperature, constrain the acquisition and the use of available energy, thus affecting physiological processes such as growth, maturation, and reproduction. These physiological processes at the population level determine survival, fecundity, and ultimately the population growth rate—a key indicator of the success of conservation efforts. As a first step towards the comprehensive understanding of how environment shapes the physiology and the life cycle of a loggerhead turtle, we constructed a full life cycle model based on the principles of energy acquisition and utilization embedded in the Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) theory. We adapted the standard DEB model using data from published and unpublished sources to obtain parameter estimates and model predictions that could be compared with data. The outcome was a successful mathematical description of ontogeny and life history traits of the loggerhead turtle. Some deviations between the model and the data existed (such as an earlier age at sexual maturity and faster growth of the post-hatchlings), yet probable causes for these deviations were found informative and discussed in great detail. Physiological traits such as the capacity to withstand starvation, trade-offs between reproduction and growth, and changes in the energy budget throughout the ontogeny were inferred from the model. The results offer new insights into physiology and ecology of loggerhead turtle with the potential to lead to novel approaches in conservation of this endangered species."
