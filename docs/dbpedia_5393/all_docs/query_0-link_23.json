        "text": "After centuries in which Pula saw little progress, the second half of the nineteenth century saw the city make a great leap forward with rapid development as it took on the role of the chief naval harbour of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Young people poured in from all parts of the multinational monarchy in search of jobs. But Pula was not just a naval base, it was also a town shared by the small native population, the newly arrived workers at the Arsenal, and the officers and enlisted men serving the imperial navy. It was in this cosmopolitan setting that Pula saw the founding of sporting associations and clubs espousing class, social and national interests.\n\nSporting organisations of Austrian officers and civil servants, and associations gathering ethnic Italians and wealthy merchants, were founded during this period, and Pula was also home to successful Croatian sporting associations espousing national equality in the Austro-Hungarian Empire.\n\nA local chapter of Hrvatski sokol, an association promoting exercise and national self-awareness among Croats and other Slavs, was founded in Pula in 1897.\n\nThe association was led by Lacko Križ (son-in-law to Matko Laginja) and had 130 members in men’s and women’s sections.\n\nThe newly founded Veloce Club Polese also had a football section, and 1899 is thus considered the date of the founding of the first football club in Pula. Further solidifying this year as the beginning of organised footballing activity in Pula is the fact that the district administration issued a permit in August of 1899 for the founding of the Club Iris, which featured football as its most active and popular activity.\n\nFootball, of course, was played in Pula prior to the founding of the Veloce Club Polese and the Club Iris.\n\nPula’s many greenswards were the most suitable areas in which to play with a ragball (known to the kids in Pula as a krpenjača or balla de strassa). Besides fisticuffs, rivalries among the young boys from the town’s various quarters (Kaštanjer, Monvidal, Barake, Veruda, Šijana, Monte Paradiso, Montezaro and others) would be played out by testing their mettle at football matches.\n\nThe first matches following the laws of the game were staged at the foot of Montezaro hill, at the Exerzierplatz, a level field used to train soldiers facing what is now the Karlo Rojc Culture Centre. Going head-to-head were teams drawn from the multinational crews of boats stationed at the Austro-Hungarian Empire’s chief naval port and from among the cadets of the military engineering school (the Maschinenschule).\n\nThe day after the football grounds were opened, all able-bodied men in Pula were drafted into military service and by late July of 1914 the Austro-Hungarian Empire had declared a state of war with Serbia. War was at the doorstep and the threat to the security of the state saw a ban on many sporting and club activities.\n\nF.C. Olimpia was one of the few clubs that did not cease its activities and at the start of the war it played a match at the Exerzierplatz pitch against a team drawn from the battleships anchored in Pula’s harbour.\n\nThe newly founded club was named after Giovanni Grion, a Pula resident born in 1890. At the start of the First World War, he deserted the army of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and joined the Italian military as a volunteer. He died during fierce fighting near Asiago in June of 1916. After the war he was celebrated among Italian nationalists in the Istrian peninsula as a hero.\n\nJust a few days after the founding of the F.G. Grion club, in early December, youth in Pula who opposed the pro-fascist Grion club revived the Veloce Club Polese association and founded clubs based on residence in city quarters, social status, or national orientation. Thus, by the end of 1919, Pula had seen the founding or revival of the Giovani Calciatori Polesi, Calcio Audax, C.S.I. Polese, C.S. Intrernazionale, Alievi Sportivi Polesi, U.S. Primavera and other clubs.\n\nThose opposed to the pro-regime and pro-fascist Grion association gathered at the Dei sete moreri football grounds a few hundred metres from the Grion pitch. In November of 1921 working class Pula residents, inclined towards socialism, joined former players and fans of A.S. Edera to revive the activity of the club, which had been shut down nine years earlier by the Austro-Hungarian authorities.\n\nEvery match between city rivals Edera and Grion was charged with an atmosphere of opposing political views, both on the pitch and between the players, and even more so in the packed bleachers, with matches typically ending with police interventions to separate the quarrelling fans.\n\nPula mayor and F.G. Grion president Luigi Bilucaglia issued a proclamation to the city’s residents calling on them to support the erection of a sports centre to provide athletes in the city with ideal conditions in which to achieve greater success and to spread the glory of Pula’s sports achievements. The stadium design was produced in the municipal technical bureau by Pula architect Guido Brass.\n\nThe city’s stadium was opened on 28 October 1931, just short of two years from the start of construction, to mark the 19th anniversary of the fascist “March on Rome” with a match pitting Grion against Triestina in the presence of the Prince of Piedmont and the princess Marie-José.\n\n1932, its first season of play at the new stadium, saw the Grion side qualify for Italian Serie B league competition. Two years later, during the 1933/34 season, the squad clinched the number six spot in the Serie B league, the best ranking Pula footballers saw in the period between the two world wars.\n\nVittorio Zucca was Pula’s most successful athlete in the period between the two world wars. A versatile athlete, Grion footballer, and one of the pioneers of football in Pula, he was also an Italian record holder in the 100- and 200-metre dashes. He competed in the Olympic Games in Antwerp in 1920 and Paris in 1924.\n\nThe Anglo-American military administration did what it could to move the tense relations and conflicts between the followers of opposed political views off the streets of Pula and channel the emotions to the football pitch, organising frequent matches pitting A.S. Pola against U.S. Operaia, with British and American troops standing between the frequent conflicts between the vying supporters.\n\nOne of the most bizarre events in Pula’s history, certainly not only as it relates to football, took place just four hours after the tragic explosion of ordnance at Pula’s Vergarola beach that took 65 lives and injured over a hundred Pula residents.\n\nThat day, 18 August 1946, saw a return match played at the city’s stadium for promotion to the Yugoslav 1st League pitting Pula’s USO squad and the Kvarner team out of Rijeka.\n\nItalian émigrés, including a number of footballers, had begun moving out of Pula even before the governments of Italy and Yugoslavia signed a peace treaty on 10 February 1947, based on the conclusions of the Paris Peace Conference, which saw Pula integrated into Croatia, then part of the Yugoslav federation.\n\nJust five days after its founding, on the occasion of Republic Day, Pula played host to Zagreb’s NK Dinamo for a friendly match with the newly created NK Pula and its line-up of the top players of the former USO and Proleter squads.\n\nAs the Croatian league season progressed most of the club’s players followed many other Pula residents—dismayed with the rigid attitude of the communist regime—and emigrated to neighbouring Italy.\n\nFaced with this reality Pula’s officials opted to shut down NK Pula and in July of 1947 revived the NK Proleter club they had shut down a year earlier.\n\nThere was disappointment in Pula after yet another unsuccessful qualification bid to land a team in Second League competition. Society figures and policy makers reacted quickly: just a day after the match the general assemblies of both NK Uljanik and NK Pula met with a single agenda item: to merge the two clubs.\n\nThe building now home to the Croatian Veterans’ Centre was the venue at 6 o’clock in the afternoon of Tuesday, 1 August 1961, for the founding meeting of NK Istra, presided over by Antun Babić, president of the People’s Committee of Pula. Mijo Pikunić was appointed the first president of the club, with Ivan Cukon and Edo Girardi, presidents of the merged clubs, serving as his vice-presidents.\n\nNK Istra and NK Uljanik played their final league match under these names at the Veruda pitch on 22 March 2003. NK Uljanik won the match 3–nil to retake the pinnacle of Pula footballing after over forty years in the shadow of NK Istra.\n\nThat year saw NK Istra also relegated out of the Second League; from the 2003/04 season it competed in the Croatian Third League.\n\nIn 2003 NK Uljanik achieved certainly the zenith of footballing in Pula and Istra County as a whole. Having eliminated First League squads Osijek and Kamen Ingrad, the team based out of the shipbuilding company secured a bid in the finals of the Croatian Football Cup where it met Hajduk of Split. The achievement was all the greater as it was the first time since Croatian independence that a Second League team had achieved this feat. Hajduk ultimately took the Cup title, winning 1–nil in Pula and 4–nil at home in Split.\n\nIt was evident that NK Uljanik had outgrown both its labour union and amateur roots, and the name borne by a state owned and subsidised shipyard. Ahead of the 2003/04 season the management opted to rename the club NK Pula 1856 (the year referencing the founding of the shipyard in Pula).\n\nHaving clinched the first spot in the southern division of the Second League the former NK Uljanik, now sporting its new name NK Pula 1856, had to best NK Međimurje of Čakovec in a qualification fixture to earn promotion to the First League. A 2–nil loss at the away game in Čakovec was followed by the home match at Pula’s stadium. The match went into extra time and a penalty shootout. The hero of the day was young Pula goalkeeper Ervin Radulović; he blocked four penalty attempts and led the Pula squad into the First League.\n\nIn late 2009 the general meeting of NK Istra 1961 chose Russian businessman Mikhail Shcheglov to the helm of the club, the first foreign national to lead a Croatian sports team. The meeting also re-registered the club, transitioning from an association to a sports joint stock company, the first step to privatisation.\n\nThe completion of all works on Pula’s new stadium was celebrated on 11 February 2011 with a friendly match between the Croatian and Czech national sides. The capacity crowd of 9,000 at the new stadium cheered the Croatian team to a 4–2 win.\n\nIn June of 2015 a consortium of American investors represented by lawyer Michael Glover purchased a majority stake in the club from Mikhail Shcheglov.\n\nAfter three seasons of league competition the American stakeholders backed out of their investment during the 2017/18 season, putting NK Istra in a precarious financial position that put the club’s future in jeopardy. Pula’s footballers, faced with no sources of financing, and left to the resources of a handful of the friends and supporters of the club, wrote some of the most dramatic and moving pages in Pula’s footballing history.\n\nIn spite of the challenges the players that did not abandon the club during the winter break, a number of players loaned from other clubs, the juniors led by coach Darko Raić Sudar, and captain Aljoša Vojnović went forward with training ahead of the spring leg of the season. In two qualification matches with NK Varaždin the team held on to its First League spot.\n\nThe NK Istra 1961 line-up for the deciding qualification match in Varaždin: Marijan Ćorić, Aleksandar Jovičić, Ivan Zgrablić, Franjo Prce, Antonio Pavić, Aljoša Vojnović, Kristijan Jakić, Renato Escobar Barufi, Dino Halilović, Goran Roce, and Andrea Ottochian.\n\nThe Karbonina pitch was revamped in 2010 with the installation of artificial turf and floodlights. Generations of Pula footballers could wistfully recall the old Karbonina pitch where lower ranked Pula teams honed their skills, with the first matches starting early Sunday morning and the final games running to the last rays of the setting sun.\n\nFrom 1912 this was the site of the A.S. Edera club football grounds, Pula’s first proper pitch.\n\nOnce turf had been installed at the city’s stadium, the Karbonina pitch was the site of matches played by city clubs Avijatičar, Duga, Staklar, Šijana, Uljanik and all the junior squads of Pula’s clubs.\n\nA vital chapter in Pula’s football story has been written by the fans of the sport. Among the most venerable were Marcello Stiglich, remembered by older Pula residents as a fiery fan of the Grion club and for his memorable catchphrase, “sempre allegri, mai pasion, viva il Grion,” cheering on his favoured squad after it was promoted to the Serie B of the Italian championship in the 1931/32 season, certainly the most momentous achievement of Pula footballers in the period before the Second World War.\n\nIn the period following the great war we remember Mr Rudella, a devotee of Pula’s top club, USO. He never missed even the club’s training sessions.\n\nWhen NK Istra was formed in 1961 by the merger of NK Uljanik and NK Pula its greatest fan was the then already eighty-two-year-old Toni Zorzetti from the Kaštanjer quarter.\n\nOne of the legendary NK Istra fans of the 1960s was Rudi, also remembered as Pula’s last active porter. A fixture of the city, always on the move, he always returned a greeting with the words “Viva Istra”, and older Pula residents remember him by his nickname Rudi Viva Istra.\n\nRudi was followed by the cheerleading enthusiasm and thunderous voice of Capitano. Providing him support from the roofs of the ticket booths were the Zimolo twins, fondly known to all as the “Banana” brothers. A few years later they would go on to be the unrivalled leaders of Pula’s football fans.\n\nWith Pula’s top club active in First League competition, 1992 saw the founding of Demoni, the first organised fan club. Always true to the city’s top footballing association the group worked with the club during its rechristening in 2007 to NK Istra 1961. Along with the support they provide at home and away matches, Demoni fans are active in humanitarian activities."
