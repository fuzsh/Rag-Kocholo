It lies at the southern tip of Istria (peninsula) at the head of the Bay of Pula and has a large, almost landlocked harbour in which there is a naval base and the Uljanik shipyards.\n\nConquered by Rome in the 2nd century bce, Pula by the 2nd century ce was the seat of a Christian bishop, and in later centuries it was part of the territories of Byzantium, of the Franks, and of Venice. In 1380 the Genoese exacted revenge raids on Pula. For some 400 years Pula declined in importance, until the 19th century. Plagues reduced the population to only hundreds in the 1630s. Austria took the town in 1797; after 1866 it became the main harbour and arsenal of the Austro-Hungarian navy. It passed to Italy in 1920 and after 1947 became part of Croatia (then part of Yugoslavia).\n\nThe town’s outstanding monument is the elliptical Roman amphitheatre completed about 80 ce and seating 23,000. A temple of Augustus and a Byzantine basilica were extensively restored after the destructive conflict between Genoa and Venice. The Kaštel, on the hill at the centre of the old town, is a museum and was previously a fortress."
