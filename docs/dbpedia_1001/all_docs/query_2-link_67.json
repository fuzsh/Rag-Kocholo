        "text": "The American Civil War began in 1861, lasted until 1865, and was ruinous by any standard. Within months of President Lincoln’s inauguration, seven southern states began the secession from the Union and declared the Confederate States of America. This split in the fabric of the country began a bitter war, concluding in the death of more than 750,000 soldiers. When the South finally surrendered, the Confederacy collapsed, and slavery was abolished. To understand the conflict, take a look back at the primary documents that highlight decisions of generals, the everyday drudgery of soldiers, and the photographic images of battle.\n\nHundreds of websites offer insight into the American Civil War. This guide is not comprehensive, but it highlights a diverse collection of free websites of primary sources for the study of the war. These websites include digitized newspaper archives for both the Union and Confederate sides of the struggle, collections of letters and diaries, digitized photographs, maps, and official records and dispatches from the battlefields.\n\nCopyright © 2015 Susan Birkenseer\n\nArticle Views (By Year/Month)\n\n2024 January: 2669 February: 2430 March: 2453 April: 3505 May: 3689 June: 1744 July: 1139 August: 1283 2023 January: 1551 February: 1336 March: 1652 April: 2011 May: 3310 June: 1416 July: 1085 August: 997 September: 1341 October: 1593 November: 2876 December: 2607 2022 January: 3502 February: 3133 March: 3216 April: 3593 May: 3426 June: 1420 July: 895 August: 980 September: 1587 October: 2015 November: 2599 December: 1955 2021 January: 3625 February: 3332 March: 3757 April: 3740 May: 5152 June: 2135 July: 1583 August: 2092 September: 3313 October: 3463 November: 4134 December: 3615 2020 January: 3132 February: 2922 March: 2954 April: 2972 May: 3542 June: 2430 July: 1974 August: 1921 September: 2994 October: 3672 November: 3436 December: 3934 2019 January: 3803 February: 2986 March: 2980 April: 3176 May: 4734 June: 2280 July: 1484 August: 1611 September: 2520 October: 2982 November: 3509 December: 3284 2018 January: 909 February: 1363 March: 1526 April: 2251 May: 3333 June: 1904 July: 861 August: 1446 September: 2369 October: 3103 November: 4170 December: 3578 2017 April: 3 May: 292 June: 21 July: 26 August: 59 September: 96 October: 414 November: 576 December: 465"
