It has evolved to become an invaluable tool in the assessment of the littlest of hearts for diagnosis, pre-interventional management and follow-up care. Although mentioned in a number of consensus and guidelines documents, an up-to-date, large, stand-alone guidance work for the use of cardiovascular magnetic resonance in pediatric congenital 36 and acquired 35 heart disease endorsed by numerous Societies involved in the care of these children is lacking. This guidelines document outlines the use of cardiovascular magnetic resonance in this patient population for a significant number of heart lesions in this age group and although admittedly, is not an exhaustive treatment, it does deal with an expansive list of many common clinical issues encountered in daily practice.\n\nKeywords: cardiac magnetic resonance, congenital heart disease, pediatrics, children, acquired pediatric heart disease\n\nIntroduction\n\nBackground\n\nThe role of imaging and the modalities utilized in pediatric and congenital heart disease (CHD) is continually evolving. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is now a standard modality in imaging CHD and is considered a “one-stop-shop” with the capability of visualizing anatomy and assessing ventricular function, blood flow and tissue characterization. It is utilized in conjunction with other imaging modalities in almost all instances including echocardiography, invasive angiography, cardiac computed tomography (CT) and nuclear medicine. The spectacular improvements in diagnosis, treatment and follow-up in this patient population is in part due to the use of this multimodality imaging approach.\n\nThere is significant literature supporting the use of CMR in pediatric CHD and acquired heart disease, however, there is wide practice variation among centers for which patients undergo CMR. Availability, diagnostic accuracy, economics and patient burden all play a role in which imaging modality is utilized for various diagnostic categories in the different centers. Echocardiography has been and remains the front line imaging modality for most CHD patients, however, the objectives and frequency of use of echocardiography have changed with the increased utilization, established and evolving capabilities of CMR and cardiac CT.\n\nAlthough there are current guidelines in adult CHD which involve CMR,1 pediatric CHD and acquired pediatric heart disease are unique and distinct entities which has different requirements and needs such as smaller structures, higher heart rates, complex unknown anatomy and the more pressing concern of avoiding ionizing radiation. Currently, there is only a consensus document that is available on CMR which is dedicated to pediatric CHD and pediatric acquired heart disease,2 an old CMR consensus documents with only small sections on pediatrics and CHD3,4 and an old appropriate use criteria (AUC) document with again, only small sections on pediatrics and CHD.5 A document describing technical protocols has been published but does not set forth guidelines or indications.6 Finally, CMR is included in the most recent AUC for multimodality imaging in the follow-up care of patients with CHD with given scenarios which is different than guidelines document for the use of CMR at all stages of care.7\n\nPurpose of this Guidelines Manuscript\n\nThe primary objective of this document is to present guidelines based on the existing literature supporting CMR for commonly encountered pediatric CHD and acquired pediatric heart disease. It is beyond the scope of this paper to delineate CMR physics, technical details and protocols focused on imaging children, as there are excellent guidelines for this published elsewhere.6,8 Where literature is sparse or non-existent, consensus opinion of the writing group is presented. The document includes both disease specific (e.g., single ventricle) and technique specific (e.g, ventricular function) sections focused on pediatric CHD and acquired heart disease. Each section includes a brief introduction followed by a review of the literature supporting use of CMR with formal recommendations for indications at the end of the section.\n\nThese guidelines are intended to assist providers in the decision to utilize CMR. They represent an extensive review of the available current scientific evidence. Many clinical scenarios are complex and some may not be covered exactly by the document; final judgement as to whether CMR is appropriate for a particular patient requires individualized decision making. In those situations, clinical decision making should consider the quality and availability of data in the area where care is provided. When these CMR guidelines are used as a basis for either regulatory or payer decisions, the goal should be improvement in quality of care. The writing group acknowledges that there may be some institutions that do not have access to or have expertise in CMR performance and as such, other imaging modalities such as cardiac CT may be considered.\n\nThis document is not a multimodality or cross-sectional imaging guideline for all the diseases mentioned or an in depth analysis of a comparison between imaging modalities. It is primarily a work on CMR indications. Where appropriate, a few comments are made regarding other imaging modalities. As a general rule, in emergency situations (e.g., pulmonary thromboembolism, shunt occlusion, and other unstable conditions) and in relative or absolute contraindications of CMR (e.g., presence of a pacemaker, a defibrillator, metals causing severe artifact or in claustrophobic patients who do not wish to be sedated) cardiac CT or cardiac catheterization may be considered.\n\nSelection of Writing Committee Members\n\nA panel of acknowledged CMR experts was selected and rigorously reviewed by the Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (SCMR) to develop these guidelines, to grade the level of clinical evidence and to write recommendations based on current knowledge of CMR and other imaging modalities. The writing group was composed of pediatric cardiologists and radiologists from both North America and Europe, representing different geographical regions, gender, ethnicities, races, perspectives and scopes of clinical practice. Representatives from the American Heart Association (AHA), the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Society for Pediatric Radiology were included in the writing group. Representation by an outside organization does not necessarily imply endorsement.\n\nDocument Development Process\n\nRelationships with Industry\n\nEach member of the writing committee reported all relationships with industry and other entities relevant to pediatric CMR. Every effort was made by members to avoid actual, potential or perceived conflicts of interest.\n\nCommittee Meetings, Evidence and Literature Review\n\nAfter numerous planning meetings, various sections of this document were written and developed by multiple committee members. Each section was distributed to the entire committee, reviewed, extensively discussed and edited at monthly meetings. All committee members had the opportunity to question and respond which allowed for rigorous debate. Final guideline recommendations were made by consensus agreement of the writing committee; the vast majority of recommendations were unanimous. When all sections were drafted, they were merged and sent out for review to the committee for final approval. Following peer review, the writing committee chair engaged authors to address reviewer comments and finalize the document for approval by participating organizations.\n\nThe recommendations listed in this document are evidence-based whenever possible. An extensive evidence review was conducted through March 2021. The literature searches were limited to studies conducted in human subjects and published in English. The references selected for this document are representative and not all-inclusive.\n\nDocument Approval\n\nThe final version of the document was submitted to the SCMR publications committee and the SCMR Board of Trustees for review and approval. After their comments were incorporated and the document approved, the document was circulated to those organizations who contributed representatives to the writing committee (AHA, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Society for Pediatric Radiology) along with the North American Society for Cardiac Imaging, the European Association of Cardiovascular Imaging and the American Society of Echocardiography to review this document and to give their approval.\n\nClass of Recommendation and Level of Evidence\n\nThese guidelines are classified using a standard evidence-based methodology developed by the AHA/ American College of Cardiology (ACC) Task Force.9 The class of recommendation (COR) is indicative of the strength of the recommendation which takes into account the estimated magnitude and certainty of benefit, in this case, medically relevant diagnostic information relative to the risk of CMR. The level of evidence (LOE) rates the quality of scientific evidence that supports the COR based on type, quantity and consistency of data from imaging studies. COR and LOE are determined independently. See Table .\n\nThe driving force for the development of these guidelines is based on an appreciation of the increasing use of CMR and a realization that the indications for pediatric CMR lack global consensus. Given the historical predominance of catheter based angiograms which chronologically was followed by echocardiography and the emergence of cardiac CT and CMR, it is clear there is a need for guidelines to optimize use of CMR. Although the guideline committee was aware of the lack of high levels of evidence with supporting randomized trials regarding pediatric CMR for many indications which is common for imaging modalities, a guideline document based on expert consensus with supporting literature nonetheless was deemed to be clinically useful.\n\nDiseases\n\nSingle Ventricle\n\nBackground\n\nThe patient born with single ventricle (SV), where only one pumping chamber effectively exists, is one of the most complex of all CHD. Nearly all patients require reconstructive surgery or heart transplantation. During reconstructive surgery, which ultimately leads to the Fontan procedure,10 varying loads and physiology are imposed on the ventricle. To further complicate matters, SVs are not one lesion but rather a collection of many different types which fall under the same diagnostic category.\n\nAs an umbrella category for a vast array of lesions and with different terminology, it is difficult to state the exact incidence precisely. In one of the most comprehensive collections of studies on incidence, per million live births, a mean of 266 for hypoplastic left heart complexes, 222 for hypoplastic right heart complexes, 132 for pulmonary atresia, 79 for tricuspid atresia and 120 for “single ventricle” whose details were not delineated in studies was found.11 Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) has been noted to occur in 0.016–0.36% of all live births and in pathologic series, represents 1.4–3.8% of CHD12–14 Tricuspid atresia prevalence ranges from 0.3 to 0.7% of all patients with CHD and occurs in ~ 1 in 15,000 live births.15\n\nOne of the major problems with a unified imaging strategy of SVs as a group is the variable anatomy; for example: (A) D-loop vs L-loop, (B) right (RV) vs left ventricle (LV), or (C) anatomic true SV versus a “functional” SV. As can clearly be seen, there can be a seemingly hopeless number of complex combinations, however, the underlying theme is that only one usable ventricle is present or both ventricles are connected in such a way that separating them into 2 pumping chambers is impossible.\n\nAnother issue with a unified imaging strategy of SVs as a group is that during the various stages of surgical reconstruction, as noted above, the physiology of the cardiovascular system changes dramatically. The ultimate goal of surgery is to completely separate the systemic and pulmonary circulations and place them in a “series circuit.” In the native state, some patients, such as those with HLHS will always require surgical intervention—the Norwood Stage I procedure,16 which includes a systemic to pulmonary artery or ventricular to pulmonary artery (Sano)17–21 shunt (Figure ), an atrial septectomy, and an aortic to pulmonary anastomosis. The SV pumps to both the systemic and pulmonary circulation in parallel, imposing a volume overload. Once pulmonary vascular resistance has dropped adequately (~ 3–6 months of age), a bidirectional superior cavopulmonary connection is performed. Since blood needs to go to the head/arms first before entering the pulmonary circulation, the ventricle does not pump directly to the pulmonary circulation and is therefore not technically volume loaded; it has been demonstrated, however, that systemic to pulmonary collaterals are present22 which can be quantified by CMR and puts a volume load on the ventricle.23 At approximately 2–5 years of age, directing inferior vena cava (IVC) blood into the lungs is performed to complete the Fontan operation.\n\nFinally, a third issue with a unified imaging strategy is that surgical reconstruction can vary greatly. To perform an aortic to pulmonary anastomosis, a Norwood or Damus-Kaye-Stansel procedure can be used. For a bidirectional superior cavopulmonary connection, a hemiFontan or bidirectional Glenn (BDG) can be performed. For a Fontan, a myriad of ways have been employed as modifications such as a lateral wall tunnel, an extracardiac conduit, or an atrio-pulmonary connection (not performed anymore), all with or without a fenestration.\n\nIndication of CMR in SV\n\nPrior to any surgery, CMR is not used frequently in the native state; generally, echocardiography is sufficient to allow for anatomic and hemodynamic characterization. Occasionally, if certain aspects of the anatomy are not delineated by echocardiography, such as pulmonary artery (PA) or pulmonary venous anatomy, CMR will be employed at this juncture (cardiac CT may be considered as an alternative if ventricle function, flow or tissue characterization information is not needed [ie anatomy alone], keeping in mind the radiation risk). In addition, if a “borderline” ventricle is present, CMR may be used to aid in the decision of a 1- versus 2-ventricle repair (Figure ).\n\nAt all surgical stages, echocardiography is universally employed and at younger ages, this may be adequate. However, in older individuals, echocardiography many not be sufficient because of poor acoustic windows. In addition, cardiac catheterization may be used at all stages for diagnosis, however, it is invasive, incurs radiation and is not feasible to be utilized for routine follow-up.\n\nAnatomy\n\nCMR has been used for many years to evaluate the anatomy of the SV patient and has been validated against catheterization and surgical observation.24–28 This is performed in both 2D, 3D and now 4D formats with or without contrast media (Figure ). For all stages of surgical reconstruction, CMR should be utilized to assess patients whose echocardiogram has not definitively demonstrated the anatomy listed in Table for surgical planning. CMR should be utilized in place of invasive angiography for this anatomy unless an intervention is planned. CMR has been utilized for many years, dating back to the late 1980’s and early 1990’s, to delineate native viscero-atrial situs, intracardiac anatomy29 and ventriculoarterial connections and is now considered standard of care. Generally, when performing each stage of surgery, however, echocardiography for anatomy is almost always supplemented by another imaging modality such as CMR27 or in some institutions, catheterization or cardiac CT (Figures and ).\n\nAt each stage of surgical reconstruction, in addition, certain aspects are focused on. Prior to the BDG/hemiFontan stage, CMR is directed towards evaluation of the aortic arch to assess for coarctation and the aortic to pulmonary anastomosis (if present). Further, pulmonary blood flow is delineated by visualization of the systemic to pulmonary or Sano shunt (if present), pulmonary stenosis, the pulmonary arteries and aortic to pulmonary collaterals. At the BDG/hemiFontan stage, besides reassessment of the aortic arch, the superior cava connections (e.g., right or left superior venae cavae (SVC) or Kawashima connections to the PAs) are visualized along with the pulmonary arteries, aortic to pulmonary and veno-venous collaterals (Figure ). Finally, after the Fontan, the entire systemic venous pathway, especially the IVC to PA connection is focused on, including the branch pulmonary arteries.\n\nVentricular and Valve Function\n\nCMR should be utilized to quantify 3D function which can be followed on a routine basis throughout all stages of surgical reconstruction and beyond. This includes regional wall motion abnormalities, ventricular volumes and mass, ejection fraction and cardiac index as delineated in Table . CMR has been the gold standard for biventricular volumes and function for many years and has been applied many times to the SV patient throughout staged surgical reconstruction (Figure ).30–35 Ventricular performance parameters have been demonstrated to correlate with exercise performance34 and has been shown to correlate with transplant free survival after Fontan.36\n\nValve function, including atrioventricular and semilunar valve regurgitant volume and fractions, using phase contrast CMR (PC-CMR) or a combination of PC-CMR with ventricular volumes, should be assessed. PC-CMR has been used in the past to quantify valve function in CHD.37–39 Valve function is a significant issue in SV patients. For example, Mahle et al. has demonstrated that 6% of patients have moderate to severe atrioventricular valve regurgitation.40 Cohen et al. has shown that neoaortic regurgitation was present in 61% of patients up to 21 years of followup with progression in 49%.41\n\nPhysiology and Hemodynamics\n\nPC-CMR has been used extensively in SV patients42,43 to assess physiology and hemodynamics. Important indices in the care of the SV patient are cardiac index as this is generally decreased, pulmonic flow (Qp)/systemic flow (Qs) which generally is close to one, flows to both lungs and systemic to pulmonary collateral flow23,44–48 which has been linked to short term outcomes such as hospital stay and presence of pleural effusions (see Qp/Qs and collateral flow section).49 In the BDG stage, cardiac catheterization cannot assess Qp because of systemic to pulmonary collaterals.43 Flows to both lungs are important parameters to determining the need for branch PA dilation, especially in SV patients where a patulous aortic reconstruction can compress the central PA. As mentioned in the forgoing paragraphs, PC-CMR is also used in the measurement of valve function.\n\nTissue Characterization For Myocardial Scarring\n\nCMR has been utilized to evaluate both discrete myocardial scarring50 as well as diffuse fibrosis.51 Myocardial scarring may be an etiology for regional wall dysfunction as well as a nidus for arrhythmia. For example, diffuse fibrosis has negatively correlated with strain51 while discrete fibrosis has been linked to adverse ventricular mechanics and ventricular tachycardia.50 Myocardial scarring is commonly found around the os of the Sano shunt with accompanying regional wall motion abnormalities (Figure ).\n\nIn part, because of the comprehensive assessment of anatomy, ventricular function, hemodynamics and tissue characterization that can be performed by CMR, a recent scientific statement from the AHA has recommended CMR be performed every 2–3 years after reaching the Fontan stage for evaluation.52\n\nCMR Prior to BDG and Fontan Reconstructions\n\nIn the past, a pre-operative echocardiography and cardiac catheterization prior to BDG and Fontan was the standard of care. In the past 15 years, however, it has been demonstrated that a select groups of patients can undergo CMR and echocardiography alone to safely undergo surgery.\n\nIn a retrospective study prior to BDG,53 Brown et al. studied the utility of cardiac catheterization in 114 SV patients, 51 of which were without suspected issues requiring catheterization after non-invasive imaging but nevertheless underwent the procedure. Only two had unsuspected findings, both of which were branch PA stenosis that could’ve been diagnosed by CMR. Twenty-five percent had complications from catheterizations, most of which were transient with 24% requiring transfusions and 14% needing an intensive care unit stay.\n\nIn a follow-up prospective trial, Brown et al.54 randomized 81 routine SV patients prior to BDG to CMR or cardiac catheterization and assessed the outcome after surgery. The cardiac catheterization group had more minor adverse events (75% vs 5%, P < 0.001), higher cost ($34,447 vs $14,921) and longer preoperative stay (2 vs 1 day) relative to the CMR group. There was one major adverse event in the CMR group in a patient with a Blalock-Taussig shunt who developed shunt thrombosis and required cardiopulmonary resuscitation and extracorpeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO); 4 days later the patient underwent routine BDG and was in good clinical status at 3-month follow-up. The operative course, the number of successful BDG and the frequency of postoperative complications were similar. At 3-month follow-up, there was no differences in clinical status, oxygen saturation or frequency of reintervention.\n\nPrior to Fontan, Ro et al.55 studied 99 SV patients retrospectively and listed a set of criteria to determine who might benefit from cardiac catheterization and who may be able to safely proceed to surgery without it. These criteria were clinical as well as echocardiographic based and 46 fell into the category of those who could forgo catheterization. The criteria identified all patients who died or did not proceed to Fontan as well as 9 of 11 who required intervention; it had a negative predictive value of 93% (those who can forgo catheterization) with a sensitivity of 81%. However, the positive predictive value was only 25% and the specificity only 52% and the authors thought that this may be partly due to the inability of echocardiography to adequately assess the branch PAs. They suggested the addition of CMR would substantially increase pre-operative predictive values.\n\nAnother study assessed 3 groups prior to Fontan27 (119 patients in total); all patients underwent echocardiography, however, 41 patients underwent CMR only, 41 patients underwent catheterization only and 37 patients underwent both catheterization and CMR. No clinically significant differences were noted in patient characteristics, hemodynamics or clinical status prior to or after surgery between the CMR only and the catheterization only groups with CMR adding information in 82% of patients. Parameters such as cardiopulmonary bypass time, circulatory arrest time, days in the intensive care unit, other surgical procedures, surgical complications, interventions after Fontan, the incidence of pleural effusions, length of stay in the hospital and oxygen saturation at discharge were similar in all 3 groups. Diagnostic success at surgery relative to all imaging modalities was ≥ 95%. In the group that had both CMR and catheterization, measurements of blood vessels were similar and there were no discrepant findings. Echocardiography could not delineate completely the pulmonary arterial anatomy in 46–53% of patients.\n\nSummary of Recommendations\n\nPreoperatively or prior to commitment to either a univentricular or biventricular circulation, CMR is reasonable to determine anatomy, physiology and ventricular function not elucidated by echocardiography or to aid in determining one vs. two ventricle repair (Class IIa, Level of evidence B).\n\nPrior to BDG, if there is no primary indication for an intervention or there is no indication of increased pressures or pulmonary vascular resistance by echocardiography, CMR is indicated to determine anatomy, physiology, hemodynamics and ventricular function for use in surgical planning in routine cases (Class I, Level of evidence B). See Table\n\nPrior to Fontan, if there is no primary indication for an intervention or there is no indication of increased pressures (e.g., end-diastolic or Fontan pressures) or pulmonary vascular resistance by echocardiography, CMR is indicated for use in surgical planning in routine cases (Class I, Level of evidence B) (See Table ).\n\nAfter Fontan, CMR is beneficial to follow asymptomatic patients routinely (Class I, Level of evidence B) every 2–3 years, especially when they reach the teenage years and is indicated in the symptomatic patient if there is no primary indication for an intervention or there is no indication of increased pressures (eg end-diastolic or Fontan pressures) or pulmonary vascular resistance by echocardiography\n\nPrior to surgery or at any stage of surgical reconstruction, CMR can be useful to evaluate anatomy and ventricular function including volumes and mass and valve function (Class I, Level of evidence B). Tissue characterization such as late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) may be useful in prognostication (Class I, Level of Evidence B)\n\nPrior to surgery or at any stage of surgical reconstruction, CMR can be useful to evaluate hemodynamics such as flows, cardiac index, Qp/Qs, flows to both lungs, fenestration flow (if Fontan) and systemic to pulmonary collateral flow (Class I, Level of evidence B).\n\nTetralogy of Fallot\n\nBackground\n\nTetralogy of Fallot (TOF)56 is the most common cyanotic CHD and has a prevalence of ~ 6% of all CHDs57 and an average incidence of 32.6 per 100,000 live births11 (~ 1660 babies born each year with TOF in the United States58). The main pathologic basis is antero-cephalad deviation of the developing conal septum which causes a malalignement type ventricular septal defect (VSD), resulting in an “overriding aorta’’ and right ventricular (RV) outflow tract (RVOT) obstruction, ultimately leading to RV hypertrophy. Repair typically consists of VSD closure and relief of RVOT obstruction, typically by placement of a transannular patch, which in most instances results in severe pulmonary regurgitation (PR) from disruption of pulmonary valve integrity; RV volume overload typically ensues.59 Another commonly used approach is placement of an RV to pulmonary artery conduit instead of a transannular patch which may also result in PR and RV volume overload. Definitive repair is generally performed in infancy with survival rates of > 98% in multiple series.60–65 Because of the high success rate in childhood, the number of repaired TOF patients has been increasing over the years with adult survivors of TOF repair now outnumbering children in a number of regions.66 The 30 year survival rate is > 90%67,68\n\nDespite these successes, complications related to residual anatomic and hemodynamic abnormalities are nearly universal. In the vast majority of patients, as mentioned, relief of the RVOT obstruction leads to PR and RV volume overload with resultant reduced RV and LV performance and are at risk for poor clinical outcomes. Multiple studies that have investigated resting RV and LV function after TOF repair69–74 consistently found diminished RV and LV performance with decreased RV ejection fraction (RVEF) and LV ejection fraction (LVEF), mostly in patients with PR. Patients with RV volume overload are at risk for sudden death, ventricular arrhythmias, increased New York Heart Association (NYHA) class and decreased exercise performance.\n\nExercise capacity is significantly decreased in TOF survivors and deserves special attention.75–77 This exercise incompetence may result from either primary LV dysfunction or by “ventricular-ventricular” interaction, where the dilated RV impinges on LV geometry causing poor performance.78–88 When TOF patients were studied at rest and during exercise testing, the incremental exercise response of LVEF in TOF patients was depressed relative to controls and LVEF during exercise correlated with both RV end diastolic volume index (RVEDVI) and the severity of PR.77 When comparing exercise performance in TOF patients and controls, significant differences exist in peak workload, maximal heart rate and systolic blood pressure.76 A review of 22 exercise studies89 found that 14 showed a significant relationship between PR with abnormal RV function and decreased exercise capacity. Further implicating RV volume overload are studies that demonstrate once the RV volume overload is abolished by pulmonary valve replacement (PVR), exercise tolerance improved.87,88\n\nNumerous other residua can be present. Residual or recurrent RVOT obstruction or pulmonary stenosis may be present at any age and commonly occur in the first several years after the initial repair; RV to PA conduits commonly need to be upsized as the patient grows and later on may become calcified and stenotic. Scar tissue from surgical relief of the infundibulotomy as well as the use of a patch to enlarge the RVOT results in non-contractile myocardium which may progress to aneurysm formation. Residual atrial septal defects (ASD) or VSD, branch PA stenosis, tricuspid regurgitation as well as aortic dilation and aortic valve regurgitation may all occur. Arrhythmia and conduction disturbances are commonly encountered.90 A recent study suggests that TOF survivors have a higher degree of RV and LV diffuse fibrosis compared to normal, raising the possibility of an etiology for conduction disturbances or decreased exercise performance91,92; the degree and time course of this fibrosis has yet to be defined. Table lists complications commonly seen in TOF.\n\nIndication and the Role of CMR in TOF\n\nCMR has been utilized for years to assess anatomy (Figure ), ventricular function including ventricular volumes (Figure ), blood flow (Figure ) and myocardial tissue characterization (Figure ) in TOF survivors91,92,95,96,98 Multiple CMR techniques have been utilized for anatomical assessment of the RVOT, branch pulmonary arteries (PAs) (Figure ) and aorta including electrocardiographically (ECG) gated balanced steady state free precession (bSSFP), unbalanced gradient echo imaging, dark blood imaging (which is much less susceptible to metal artifact) and contrast enhanced imaging to create 3D image sets. CMR is the gold standard for reliably and accurately measuring 3D ventricular volumes and performance generally utilizing bSSFP cine imaging and is the imaging modality of choice (Figure ). PC-CMR93 is employed to measure flow and velocity, focused on PR (Figure ), flow to both lungs, cardiac index, Qp/Qs, tricuspid regurgitation (alone or in combination with cine imaging) and aortic to pulmonary collateral flow. Parametric native T1 mapping94 can determine diffuse fibrosis and recent studies in children with repaired TOF have demonstrated extracellular volume (ECV) expansion91,92; in adult, TOF survivors showed a higher rate of adverse clinical events in TOF patients with ECV ≥ 30% than those with < 30% (Figure ).95 Finally, myocardial strain by CMR using feature and tissue tracking allows for strain measurements with standard cine96 and has recently demonstrated to be prognostic in adult TOF survivors.96 Normal values for pediatric strain has recently been published.97\n\nPrior to surgery in young children, echocardiography is primarily utilized for the management and care of the patient with TOF and CMR is generally not routinely indicated. There are a few exceptions such as:\n\nLack of visualization of various structures such as the branch PAs by echocardiography\n\naortic arch anomalies\n\ndiscontinuous branch PAs\n\naorto-pulmonary collaterals (Figure )\n\ncomplex TOF or situs anomalies\n\ninconsistent clinical data that may indicate the need for an intervention other than routine repair.\n\nAfter surgical repair, numerous sequelae can be present and CMR is indicated to assess nearly all of them:\n\nPR (Figure 8) PR is a major issue and CMR is the only technique that allows for accurate quantification of not only of regurgitant volumes but regurgitant fraction as well (using PC-CMR)98,99 with echocardiography only having a modest correlation with CMR.37 It has been utilized since the early to mid 90 s for this evaluation98,100 and has been demonstrated to positively correlate with RV end-diastolic volume (RVEDV).101,102 In the absence of residual intracardiac shunts and other valve insufficiency, the difference in ventricular stroke volumes would equal the PR volume by PC-CMR.\n\nRV (Figure 7) Cine CMR is the gold standard in determining quantitative biventricular size and mass and has been so for many decades.32,103–106 PR results in RV dilation with decreased function, risking morbidity and mortality,107 and the effects of RV dilation on LV function108 are important to follow by CMR. In a large cohort of patients spanning the gamut of ages, RV hypertrophy relative to RV volume was predictive of death and ventricular tachycardia.109 RVEF has been associated with impaired exercise performance.110 Typical values for RV dilation and hypertrophy in TOF have been published by many groups.102,111–113\n\nIt has been known for a number of years that intrinsic regional RV wall function is decreased in TOF survivors using CMR.114 Relatively recently, both RV and LV strain from routine cine CMR has been performed using either CMR feature tracking or tissue tracking of the myocardium. Both RV global longitudinal strain (GLS) and LV global circumferential strain (GCS) by CMR have emerged as predictors of poor outcome across a wide gamut of age ranges including pediatric and adolescents and may be useful in prognostication.96\n\nFibrosis has been noted by CMR in TOF survivors and has clinical implications. LGE or discrete fibrosis, has been utilized to assess viability of the myocardium for many years115 and in the TOF population, has been found to be present in both the RV and the LV. This increased signal intensity also occurs at the site of patch material such as the VSD and the transannular patch (Figure ).116 Patients with poor ventricular performance, exercise intolerance and arrhythmias have demonstrated increased amounts of LGE throughout all age ranges117,118 and LGE in children positively correlates with increasing RVEDV and PR.119 RV diffuse fibrosis using T1 mapping has also been shown to be increased in TOF survivors in children,91 however, the significance is unknown at this time.\n\nA published recommendation from the American Society of Echocardiography, developed in collaboration with SCMR and the Society for Pediatric Radiology recommends yearly CMRs based on RV performance parameters (eg RVEDVI ≥ 150 cc/m2, RVEF ≤ 48%) and every 3 years if the RV does not fall into these ranges for anyone 10 years of age or older; for those younger, it is ordered to address specific questions not addressed by echocardiography.120\n\nLeft Ventricle As mentioned above, numerous studies have documented LV dysfunction in repaired TOF patients for a few reasons and therefore, CMR evaluation of the LV takes on a key position in evaluation. CMR has demonstrated that this dysfunction is directly related to adverse outcomes such as ventricular tachycardia and death across all age ranges.121 LVEF has been associated with impaired exercise performance110 and as mentioned above, LV GCS has correlated with poor outcome.96 In addition, a small study has shown that LV diffuse fibrosis in children is associated not only with biventricular enlargement but is also associated with poor exercise performance122 and impaired LV mechanics123; long term clinical outcomes have yet to be elucidated.\n\nAnatomy Important elements to image by CMR are residual lesions of the RVOT (e.g., RVOT aneurysm, the presence of an RV muscle bundle and RVOT and annular obstruction (Figure )), the branch PAs and surgical reconstructions such as RV to PA conduits.124 CMR in many instances is able to visualize these structures with higher fidelity than echocardiography, especially in the older child and adolescent. Although echocardiography is generally utilized to estimate the RV systolic pressure by measuring the peak tricuspid regurgitation (TR) velocity and the pressure drop across the RVOT and annulus by assessing the peak velocity by Doppler, in-plane PC-CMR may be utilized for this, although uncommon.\n\nSince the mid to late 90’s CMR has been known to be a highly sensitive technique to assess the branch PAs in TOF.125 It has been validated against X-ray angiography126 and is superior to echocardiography.127 Branch PA stenosis or dilation (such as in TOF with absent pulmonary valve leaflets) should be noted. Physiologically, using PC-CMR, differential PA blood flow is obtained by CMR and has shown to be accurate128–130 even in the presence of stents,131 and may be used as a component in the decision making process to determine the need for intervention on the branch PAs.\n\nLeft Sided Structures Aortic root and ascending aortic dilation are known phenomenon seen in TOF and not only can significantly dilate in a high proportion of patients in the late teens and adulthood132 but also may cause considerable pathology.133 In addition, right aortic arches occur in ~25% of TOF along with branching abnormalities and the occasional vascular ring. These structures are routinely and easily imaged by CMR with and without contrast. Aortic regurgitation (AR), associated with aortic root and ascending aortic dilation, occurs in TOF134 and should be quantified by CMR38 using PC-CMR.\n\nResidual Shunting Residual ASD and VSD flow can be present after surgical repair and can be diagnosed by echocardiography. CMR has utility not only visualizing these structures when inadequate echocardiography windows are present, but the strength of the modality is to quantify net shunting via PC-CMR with internal checks (see Qp/Qs section). In addition, in TOF patients with pulmonary atresia and multiple aortic to pulmonary collaterals, CMR again can visualize and quantify the shunt which has been performed since the 1990s.135,136\n\nOther Considerations TR occurs not uncommonly in TOF and is also generally seen by echocardiography. CMR can quantify atrioventricular valve regurgitation in 2 separate ways for internal consistency and accuracy. Spatial relationships of the cardiovascular system and the airways can be important such as in TOF with absent pulmonary valve leaflets along with the relationship of the sternum in case of reoperation and CMR is useful in defining this anatomy. Coronary artery anatomy, for years a staple of CMR, can be defined as well in case of stenting the RVOT and main PA (see Coronary Artery section).\n\nIt should be noted that in certain circumstances, where the necessary airway or coronary anatomy cannot be obtained by CMR, or if visualization within a stent is needed for delineation of size, cardiac CT may be considered as an alternative.\n\nPulmonary Valve Replacement PVR deserves special attention in that it eliminates PR, decreases RV volume overload and improves symptoms including TR and exercise intolerance87,88,137,138 but the threshold ventricular volumes above which a PVR should be performed is unknown.139–144 Indexed end-diastolic volumes have ranged in various studies from 140 to 180 cc/m2. Other parameters to consider for PVR include large RVOT aneurysms, RVOT obstruction, sustained tachyarrhythmias related to RV volume overload, left to right shunt with a Qp/Qs > 1.5, severe AR or dilation.145 CMR has played a major role in attempting to determine the optimal timing of PVR and is indicated for baseline and follow-up evaluation of the TOF patient for PVR.\n\nSummary of Recommendations\n\nPrior to definitive TOF surgery, CMR can be useful to delineate various anatomic structures when there is a lack of visualization by echocardiography. In addition, it can be beneficial to delineate, aortic arch anomalies, discontinuous branch PAs, aorto-pulmonary collaterals and complex TOF anatomy or situs anomalies as an adjunct to echocardiography (Class IIA, level of evidence C).\n\nAfter definitive TOF repair, CMR is reasonable to delineate anatomy, physiology, blood flow, ventricular function and tissue characterization. In specific, assessing biventricular performance (ventricular volumes, ejection fraction, cardiac index), valve function (PR, TR, AR) and flows to both lungs are crucial to quantify (Class I, level of evidence B). RVOT, branch PA and aortic root/aortic anatomy are important to evaluate and measure (Class I, level of evidence B). Discrete myocardial scarring is important to identify (Class I, level of evidence B).\n\nCMR is indicated to evaluate RV volumes as a baseline, every 2–3 years if not dilated and ≥ 10 years of age or yearly if dilated and in the range to be considered for PVR (Class I, level of evidence B).\n\nAnnual CMR is useful when surgery is being considered to evaluate RVOT aneurysms or obstruction, sustained tachyarrhythmias related to RV volume overload, left to right shunt with a Qp/Qs > 1.5, severe AR or dilation if being considered for PVR (Class IIA, level of evidence B).\n\nIf the child requires sedation or anesthesia for CMR, this modality is reasonable to delineate anatomy, physiology, blood flow, ventricular function and tissue characterization when echocardiography suggests pathology or cannot visualize structures (Class IIA, level of evidence B). This can be performed as a baseline in childhood and prior to reaching the teenage years (Class IIB, level of evidence C).\n\nMyocardial strain (Class IIA, level of evidence B) and diffuse fibrosis (Class IIB, level of evidence C) by CMR might be considered for prognostication.\n\nTransposition of the Great Arteries\n\nBackground\n\nTransposition of the great arteries (TGA) is anatomically defined as a ventriculo-arterial discordance and is the second most frequent cyanotic CHD with a prevalence of 0.2–0.3 / 1000 livebirths with a male predominance of 1.5–3:1,13 accounting for 5–7% of all CHD.146 This section will focus on TGA with D-looped ventricles with repair using the arterial switch operation (ASO);L-looped TGA and repair with an atrial inversion operation is in the section on systemic RVs. The ASO is nowadays the surgical technique of choice for repair of TGA147 consisting of (1) transecting the aorta and the main PA at the level of the sinotubular junction, (2) removing the coronary ostia from the original aortic root and transferring them with a piece of surrounding tissue (button) to the neo aortic (pulmonary) root, (3) relocating the PA anteriorly and connecting it to the previous aortic root, and (4) relocating the aorta posteriorly and anastomosing it to the neoaortic root (native pulmonary root). With this technique, the branch PAs most commonly straddle the ascending aorta (LeCompte maneuver). Any additional intracardiac communication is closed during the surgery. This procedure allows both anatomical and functional repair restoring ventriculo-arterial concordance.\n\nASO can be performed successfully with low mortality rate.148 Nevertheless, potential postoperative complications include supravalvar and branch PA stenosis, coronary ostial occlusion/narrowing with subsequent myocardial ischemia and LV dysfunction, AR and neo-aortic root dilatation.149 Coronary artery complications after ASO have been reported in up to 10% of cases.150,151 Early detection of coronary artery lesions is essential for preventing ischemia and potentially life-threatening events. Notably, hearts after the ASO operation are denervated, and chest pain is not a reliable symptom of ischemia in these patients.152\n\nAdvanced imaging in patients with TGA after ASO is targeted to detect all potential residual findings requiring medical or surgical treatment. These include ventricular dysfunction, supravalvar pulmonary or aortic stenosis, branch PA stenosis, coronary artery stenosis/occlusion, neo-aortic or pulmonary valve regurgitation and, neoaortic root dilation.153 Even though there is one meta-analysis that concludes that coronary surveillance is not needed,154 multiple studies have concluded otherwise.150–152,155\n\nIndications for CMR\n\nPrior to ASO\n\nEchocardiography is the first line imaging modality prior to ASO and in most cases, CMR is not indicated. Occasionally there may be anatomic or physiologic abnormalities not delineated by echocardiography (e.g., branch PAs) and for those few cases, CMR is useful to delineate this missing information prior to surgery. When it is necessary to delineate the coronary anatomy or if echocardiography fails to do so, CMR has become more utilized; however, at the current time, it is not widespread and standard of care remains cardiac catheterization with cardiac CT as a backup.\n\nAfter ASO\n\nCMR is indicated and can depict almost all common potential residual findings after ASO (Table ).\n\nVentricular Function\n\nCMR is considered the modality of choice for quantification of biventricular volumes and function, especially the RV (Table ).6,8,156,157 CMR has a high accuracy and reproducibility and is therefore the ideal modality for repeated measurements during follow up.158,159 In ASO patients, CMR can recognize diminished ventricular function in ASO patients at times when echocardiography fails to do so (Table ).160 Moreover, advanced imaging with CMR can provide potential causes of ventricular dysfunction in the same examination (eg myocardial scarring, myocardial perfusion imaging if an adenosine stress CMR is being performed).\n\nMild biventricular dilation is not uncommon after the ASO operation. LV dysfunction has been observed in up to 20% of the cases and is correlated to clinical symptoms.161 In presence of ventricular dysfunction, concomitant evaluation of myocardial perfusion and scar imaging are essential for assessing coronary artery obstruction. RV dysfunction is rarer but can occur in combination with RVOT obstruction or stenosis of the branch PAs. Therefore, in presence of RV dysfunction, imaging the RVOT and the PAs is mandatory. Due to the position of the RVOT located immediately posterior to the sternum and of the branch PAs straddling the ascending aorta, visualization by transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is rarely sufficient as patients grow and postoperative scar tissue often limit clear visualization of these structures.\n\nCoronary Arteries, Myocardial Perfusion and Viability\n\nAfter coronary artery transfer by the ASO, the origin of both coronary arteries is usually in a different position than normal, facing the anteriorly positioned neopulmonary artery (Figure ). Depending on its individual position, the proximal left coronary artery may show a tangential course which must be distinguished from true coronary artery obstruction. Moreover, it is still unclear whether this steep angle of origin may promote stenosis long term.162,163 Whole-heart CMR (3D balanced bSSFP, contrast enhanced inversion recovery gradient echo imaging using gadolinium or ferumoxytol) enables accurate detection of the abnormal origin and course of the coronary arteries even in very young patients with CHD164,165 and patients with TGA after ASO are no exception.166 Thus, evaluation of the coronary origins and courses routinely added to the CMR protocol167 (see section on CMR for coronary arteries).\n\nIn the cases with symptoms, LV dysfunction or coronary narrowing, evaluation of first-pass perfusion and viability can be performed by CMR.168 Myocardial perfusion, typically with the vasodilator adenosine,169,170 can be safely and accurately performed in children.171–177 In 56 myocardial first-pass perfusion scans performed in children, a sensitivity of 87% and a specificity of 95% have been described when compared with coronary angiography171 (Figure ). Another group reported on 64 first-pass perfusion exams in 48 children and found a positive predictive value of 80% and a negative predictive value of 88% for detecting coronary lesions.173 There are some studies of TGA after ASO which did not find any scar or perfusion defects,178 however, there are others, using regadenoson as a vasodilator stress agent, which detected myocardial perfusion defects in up to 30% with very good agreement with coronary angiography.179\n\nLGE can be found in up to 20% of the patients with TGA after ASO, some of which occur in a non-coronary pattern with small focal enhancement in the septal-free wall junction (possibly residuals from thromboembolic events during Rashkind maneuver and/or cardiopulmonary by-pass). Elevated diffuse myocardial fibrosis has been observed in a cohort of pediatric ASO patients178,180; the prognostic significance of this finding remains unclear.\n\nPulmonary Arteries\n\nCMR is effective and superior to echocardiography for detecting complications of the PAs after the Lecompte maneuver.181–183 As the cross-section of the PAs is ellipsoid, the antero-posterior dimension is usually smaller than the supero-inferior one184 (Figure ). PC-CMR measurements provide accurate quantitative differential lung perfusion and add crucial hemodynamic information to the anatomical images.185–187 An unbalanced lung perfusion > 70:30 is usually taken as cut off for the need of an intervention in the PA branches.188 By combining CMR anatomic findings with flow measurement, CMR has demonstrated that orientation of the neo-pulmonary root and diameter of the neo-aortic root are major determinants of the degree of branch PA stenosis.189 With 4D flow, the hemodynamics in the main PA and in branch PAs can be even better understood.190,191\n\nNeoaortic Root Dilation\n\nNeoaortic root dilatation is a common finding during long term follow up and has been described by CMR in up to 76% of the patients.161 Neoaortic root dilatation progresses over time and is strongly associated with significant semilunar valve regurgitation. CMR is superior to other modalities for quantification of neoaortic valve regurgitation.192 Older age at time of ASO, presence of VSD, and previous PA banding are described risk factors for neoaortic valve regurgitation.193–195 CMR data has also demonstrated that aortic arch geometry (Figure ) has a significant influence on the severity of neoaortic root dilation, with more acute aortic angles associated with larger neoaortic root and higher incidence of regurgitation.196\n\nEven though reoperation on the neoaortic valve in the currently studied adult patients was rarely necessary, the potential progression of both neoaortic root dilatation and valve regurgitation should have accurate imaging follow up.197 CMR is the ideal modality as it provides both diameters of the neoaortic root measured in different planes and reproducible quantification of the neoaortic valve regurgitation (Figure ).\n\nSummary of Recommendations\n\nPrior to surgery, CMR is useful in evaluating anatomy and physiology required for medical or surgical management in patients with TGA which is not delineated by echocardiography (Class I, Level of evidence C).\n\nA comprehensive CMR examination should be performed during routine follow-up of patients who received an ASO and is complimentary to echocardiography (Class I, Level of evidence B)\n\nCMR is beneficial for quantification of biventricular volumes and function in TGA after the ASO (Class I, Level of evidence B).\n\nCMR is beneficial for visualization of the coronary arteries in TGA after the ASO (Class I, Level of evidence B).\n\nCMR is recommended for evaluation of the main PA and branch PA stenosis with assessment of differential pulmonary flow (Class I, Level of evidence B)\n\nCMR is recommended for measure of neoaortic root enlargement and quantification of neoaortic valve regurgitation (Class I, Level of evidence B)\n\nVasodilator stress perfusion CMR imaging is useful in symptomatic patients to test for ischemia (Class I, Level of Evidence B) and may be considered as an initial, non-invasive screening test for myocardial perfusion defects and therefore detection of potential coronary artery obstruction. (Class IIB, Level of evidence B)\n\nIn the case of suspected myocardial perfusion defects, CMR may be considered for visualization of coronary ostial stenosis (Class IIB, Level of evidence B)\n\nCMR is useful in screening for myocardial scarring with LGE (viability imaging) or in confirming the diagnosis in cases of symptomatic individuals, given manipulation of the coronary arteries in this lesion (Class I, level of evidence C).\n\nPulmonary Venous Anomalies\n\nBackground\n\nAnomalies of the pulmonary veins (PVs) can be congenital or acquired after an intervention or during the progression of a disease. Congenital PV lesions are rare and occur with a prevalence of 0.6–1.2 / 10 000 livebirths.11,198 Partial anomalous PV connection (PAPVC) is the most frequent observed lesion and can occur in isolation but more frequently in association with an ASD (specifically a sinus venosus ASD) (Figure ). In presence of a sinus venous ASD of the SVC type, a right upper PV connecting to the SVC is common whereas in a sinus venosus ASD of the IVC type, the right lower PV will connect to the inferior margin of the right atrium. Another condition associated with PAPVC is Turner Syndrome in which typically the left upper PV connects to the innominate vein.199 In Scimitar syndrome, usually all right PVs connect anomalously to the IVC200,201 which may occur below the diaphragm (Figure ).\n\nTotal anomalous pulmonary venous connection (TAPVC) occurs in four different formations defined by the location of the connection of the PVs to the right-sided circulation. In order of prevalence, the sites of connection are: supracardiac (Figure ), infradiaphragmatic (Figure ), cardiac, and mixed type. TAPVC can occur in isolation or in association with complex CHD such as heterotaxy syndrome.202–204 As variations of the course of the PVs are not infrequent, accurate imaging of each PV is mandatory prior to surgery. Moreover, obstruction in the PV pathway is not rare and can be caused by (a) stenosis of each PV, (b) stenosis at the site of connection, (c) extrinsic compression of the connecting channel, (d) compression of the vertical vein in between the left bronchus and the left PA (supracardiac type) (Figure ), (e) in the infradiaphragmatic type, compression in the small esophageal hiatus, in the ductus venosus or in the capillary system of the liver (Figure ) or other solid parenchymal organ.205 TAPVC with obstruction of the PV drainage causes severe symptoms of pulmonary congestion in the first days of life and requires immediate surgical or catheter based relief. Unobstructed TAPVC usually leads to significant left to right shunt and heart failure in the first weeks of life.\n\nFinally, congenital stenosis of one or more PVs can occur, a progressive disease which leads to a dismal outcome (Figure ).206 This can occur with or without associated CHD, and unilateral PV stenosis can lead to flow asymmetry to the lungs (i.e., decreased flow to the lung associated with the PV stenosis). It is not uncommon to have recurrent and/or progressive PV obstruction or even death after surgical repair.207\n\nCMR Indication in PV Anomalies\n\nCMR is nearly always performed after an echocardiography for all PV anomalies (Figures , , , , ). In presence of an ASD, particularly of the sinus venosus type (Figure ), CMR is indicated for ruling out a PAPVC whenever TTE is not conclusive.208,209 Greater than 4 PVs may be present and therefore, echocardiography delineation of only 4 PVs without searching for others in lesions associated with PAPVC is not sufficient and CMR is mandatory. In patients with limited acoustic windows, CMR is indicated to delineate other PVs even if 4 are visualized on echocardiography. Besides providing clear information on the exact location of PV connection and drainage required for proper planning of all surgical corrections such as the Warden operation,210,211 CMR is useful to assess size and function of the dilated right heart, assessing the contribution of the anomalous vein(s) to the left to right shunt and to measure Qp/Qs (Figure ). In case of isolated PAPVC, quantification of Qp/Qs and right heart dilation is a major determinant of indication for surgical repair.\n\nCMR is the modality of choice for evaluation of Scimitar syndrome,212,213 demonstrating not only the anomalous drainage of all right PVs into the IVC (Figure ) with the typical shape of an Arabic sword (scimitar) but also the associated anomalies including dextrocardia, right lung hypoplasia, horseshoe lung, aberrant systemic arterial blood supply to the right lower lung. In addition, in TAPVC, CMR is an important tool for visualization of each single pulmonary vein, their exact site of insertion (especially in mixed TAPVC), drainage, and if present, site of obstruction. (Figure ). Moreover, shunt fraction and blood flow distribution to each lung can be quantified.\n\nIn congenital stenosis of one or more PVs, CMR angiography provides exact depiction of the location of stenosis, number of veins affected and can be repeated during follow up (Figure ). PV stenosis is also a possible complication after surgical TAPVC repair214,215 and if all PV are not affected, pulmonary flow redistributes among the different lung segments. Recognition of the severity of obstruction can be difficult by echocardiography as severely diminished flow may not induce turbulence seen by color flow Doppler at the site of stenosis; on the other hand, turbulence may be visualized at a PV vein which is normal size but has increased flow across it. For congenital PV stenosis and after surgical repair for TAPVC, CMR can clearly depict PV stenosis216,217 and delineating not only peak velocities in them (with PC-CMR) but also flows in each PV and PA.\n\nFlows in the PVs can be assessed quantitatively218 and qualitatively.219 The normal PV flow curve consists of 2 forward waves during systole and early diastole as well as a short wave of reverse flow during late diastole at atrial contraction. This normal flow profile can be altered in several conditions or if atrial compliance is disturbed. In presence of unilateral PV stenosis, a redistribution of flow occurs within the lung and can be assessed by measuring the flow in the pulmonary arteries by CMR; this is correlated with particular changes in flow profile.220,221 Flow profiles are also affected directly within the PVs; proximal to a focal stenosis, flow loses its triphasic profile similarly as observed by using Doppler echocardiography.219 On the other hand, peak PV flow velocities > 100 cm/s indicate significant obstruction.217\n\nIn complex CHD, particularly heterotaxy syndrome, PV anomalies are frequent and occur in a wide anatomic variety.204 Due to anatomic complexity, echocardiography is often insufficient to describe all diagnostic features required for surgical and medical management. In these lesions, CMR has an important role for surgical planning or staged palliation222,223 especially in SV patients. The PV may become impinged between the dilated heart and the spine or the descending aorta (Figure ). PV occlusion may increase the overall resistance to pulmonary flow which has a negative impact on the Fontan circulation and ultimately clinical outcome.\n\nIn general, in comparison to other modalities, cross sectional imaging is superior to echocardiography or conventional angiography due to 3D data acquisition which enables a targeted multiplane reformatting and therefore, visualization of each single PV without superimposition of other vascular structures.224,225 CT has the same ability to delineate anatomy. CMR has been validated against lung perfusion scintigraphy for measurement of differential lung perfusion and has been shown to be a similarly accurate and robust modality.187,226 In patients with CHD, CMR flow has been shown to be even more accurate (especially in the presence of systemic to pulmonary collaterals) and to overcome some pitfalls associated with scintigraphy.188\n\nSummary of Recommendations\n\nIn patients with PV stenosis or suspected anomalous PV connection, whether PAPVC or TAPVC, CMR should be performed for anatomic evaluation whenever echocardiography is insufficient (Class I, Level of evidence B).\n\nCMR is useful to understand the hemodynamics of PV anomalies such as calculating any shunt (Qp/Qs) caused by anomalous PV connection and associated intracardiac lesions as an indication for surgical repair (Class I, Level of evidence B) as well as quantifying differential lung perfusion with flow redistribution (Class I, Level of evidence B).\n\nCMR examination should be performed for assessing PV anatomy in cases with complex CHD when there is a clinical or imaging suspicion of anomalies of PV connection or drainage, particularly heterotaxy syndrome (Class I, Level of evidence B)\n\nCMR angiography should be performed for surgical planning of repair of PV anomalies (Class I, Level of evidence B)\n\nIt is reasonable to perform at least one CMR examination during follow up after surgical repair for PV anomalies (Class IIA, Level of evidence B).\n\nCoronary Artery Disease\n\nBackground\n\nCategorically, pediatric coronary artery pathologies can be either congenital or acquired. Acquired lesions can also be sub-categorized as either “disease” based or “surgically” based. Congenital lesions would include those related to anomalous aortic origin of a coronary artery (AAOCA) from an inappropriate sinus (e.g., anomalous origin of the left coronary from the right sinus of Valsalva), anomalous origin from a different vessel such as anomalous origin of the left coronary from the PA, and/or anomalous course of a coronary artery (eg intraseptal) or exit (eg coronary cameral fistulae as seen in pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum). “Acquired disease” based lesions would include Kawasaki disease whereas “surgically” based lesions would include alterations of the locations of the coronary ostia or their proximal courses related to corrective surgeries such as the arterial switch operation (Jatene procedure)227 or Ross procedure.228 Clearly, many of these diseases lend themselves to potentially decrease myocardial perfusion, possibly resulting in ischemia and infarction.\n\nEchocardiography, CT, and CMR are the most commonly used non-invasive imaging modalities for the evaluation of pediatric patients with coronary artery pathologies. Echocardiography is the most easily available with its inherent mobility and high temporal resolution and remains the front-line imaging modality. In many instances, echocardiography is utilized as a screening tool for progression of disease (e.g., Kawasaki’s disease) or may suggest a pathology as an incidental finding (e.g., an echocardiography for evaluation of physical examination findings of a murmur that suggests AAOCA).\n\nCardiac CT, with state-of-the-art dual-source or volume CT scanners, compared to CMR performed on 1.5 T or 3 T CMR scanners, has slightly higher isotropic spatial resolution (0.5–0.6 mm), faster total examination and scanning time and can, at times, accommodate high heart rates (> 120 bpm) despite a modest temporal resolution for nearly all scanners of 75 ms, although the fastest scanner can obtain a resolution of 66 ms. The drawbacks are that CT requires ionizing radiation and rapid bolus intravenous injection of iodinated contrast agent along with possibly administering medication to slow the heart rate (e.g. propranolol). Cardiac CT typically is limited to morphologic imaging due to radiation exposure concern.\n\nCMR is generally utilized to confirm the diagnosis by echocardiography as well as to allow for visualization of longer segments with whole-heart coverage229 in addition to assessing myocardial function (both regional and global), perfusion177 and infarction (ie viability imaging).50,172 Further, CMR adds anatomic information as well in the same patient such as those with TGA after ASO.172 CMR can obtain in-plane resolution of 0.5–0.6 mm230 at 3 T in children and can usually obtain 1–1.2 mm isotropic resolution at 1.5 T. CMR can also obtain coronary images without the need for contrast in the pediatric age range165,231,232 in multiple different formats (eg bright blood or dark blood)233 although contrast can enhance the imaging.234 Newer techniques,235,236 currently utilized in several pediatric centers, take advantage of the significant increase signal afforded by the iron-particle blood pool contrast agent, ferumoxytol, and have shown very promising results with sub-mm isotropic whole-heart coverage even in infants with high heart rates (Figure ) (0.6-0.8 mm in-plane resolution at 1.5 T with slightly lower resolution in the z axis).\n\nIndications for CMR to Assess Coronary Arteries\n\nCongenital\n\nFollowing screening echocardiography for suspicion or diagnosis of AAOCA, CMR should be used to confirm the presence of AAOCA and further characterize the location and shape of the ostium and proximal and mid-segment course of the anomalous coronary artery (Figures , ). It should also be used to assess biventricular function both globally as well as regionally to assess regional wall motion abnormalities which may be due to AAOCA. Finally, viability can be performed on a routine basis to determine if there is any discrete LGE due to myocardial infarction. Vasodilator stress perfusion CMR should be reserved for special cases.\n\nIn a prospective study of 50 patients (age range, 18 days to 18 years), Hussain et al.229showed that whole-heart coronary artery CMR has a success rate of 94% for the detection of coronary origins. Brothers et al. demonstrated prospectively in a small group of patients the multifaceted utility of CMR by characterizing stenosis, perfusion and fibrosis both prior to and after surgery in children with AAOCA.167 The latest techniques using ferumoxytol overcomes previous spatial limitations (Figure ) even in small infants. Detailed depiction of the anomalous coronary artery and its proximal course can also be achieved with high in-plane sub-mm spatial resolution coronary CMR imaging with a targeted approach and 3D endovascular view of the morphology of the ostium can be performed (Figure ).237 Most recently, in one institution, a large cohort of 5,169 asymptomatic volunteers (11—18 years of age) were screened with CMR for cardiomyopathy and anomalous coronary artery origin from the opposite sinus with an intramural segment (ACAOS-IM). There were 23 such cases (6 left-ACAOS-IM and 17 right-ACAOS-IM)238,239 establishing a prevalence of 0.4%.\n\nOther important anatomic findings of the coronary arteries can be detected by CMR such as a conal branch coursing anteriorly across the RVOT and/or position of left main coronary and proximal left anterior descending (LAD) artery with respect to RVOT, significant in patients with TOF.240 In a prospective study of whole-heart coronary CMR in 100 patients (age 2 months–11 years; median 3 years), of the 58 patients who underwent surgery, all CMR coronary artery findings were confirmed including 4 cases of coronary anomalies.165 In addition, coronary anomalies of “course” such as an intraseptal or retroaortic course, are important to delineate and have been demonstrated by CMR.237 Finally, anomalies of exit such as those with pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum with coronary cameral fistulae or a RV dependent coronary circulation can be delineated by CMR, especially important because of the sequelae of myocardial infarction (Figure ).\n\nAcquired\n\nCMR can be used to assess for the morphology including size, shape, and location of coronary aneurysms in diseases such as Kawasaki’s disease (Figure ). Similar to other CHD, it should also be used to assess global and regional ventricular performance, viability and perfusion (perfusion in select cases).\n\nMavrogeni et al.241 has shown in a prospective study of 16 patients (age range 3–8 years) that coronary CMR correlated completely with invasive cath for size and location of aneurysms. There were no cases of stenoses for comparison. Suzuki et al.242 and in related work by Takemura et al.242 showed in a retrospective study with a larger cohort of 106 Kawasaki disease patients (median age 13 years, range: 4 months–33 years) and a smaller cohort of 35 consecutive pediatric KD patients (under 6 years of age) that imaging of coronary arteries in pediatric patients with Kawasaki disease can routinely be performed with a 96% success rate. High sub-millimeter spatial resolution imaging that is used for AAOCA has been successful in young patients with Kawasaki disease.243,244 In addition, CMR should also assess for global and regional ventricular dysfunction, coronary perfusion, and myocardial scarring/LGE during the convalescence and follow up of the Kawasaki disease patients.245,246 Advanced imaging of characterization of the coronary vessel wall has also been shown to be possible.246\n\nCMR can be used to characterize the anatomy of the coronary arteries following surgery in which the position and/or origin of the native coronary arteries have been altered such as after the Ross procedure or TGA after ASO (Figure ). Taylor et al. reported in a prospective study of 50 asymptomatic pediatric TGA patients after ASO (age range 6–16 years) a comprehensive CMR examination including coronary artery CMR, cine imaging for ventricular function, and myocardial characterization for scarring.172 In 100 patients after ASO, Rodriguez et al. studied 100 whole heart 3D CMRs and found coronary artery stenosis in nearly 11%.166\n\nImaging coronary artery walls for vasculopathy in transplant patients247 including those in the pediatric age range248 and in other diseases such as Takayasu’s arteritis249 is an emerging application of CMR coronary imaging but should be considered experimental at this time.\n\nSummary of Recommendations\n\nFor patients with suspected AAOCA or other congenital anomalies of origin, course or exit, CMR is recommended to depict the origin and detailed anatomy of the vessels for both diagnosis and pre-operative planning (Class I, Level of evidence B).\n\nFor patients with Kawasaki disease or other acquired “diseased” based coronary pathology, CMR is recommended to accurately depict the size, shape, and location of coronary aneurysms (Class I, Level of evidence B).\n\nFor patients with acquired “surgically” based coronary pathology such as TGA after ASO or Ross procedure, CMR is recommended to evaluate the post-operative coronary anatomy as part of a clinically indicated comprehensive CMR examination. (Class I, Level of evidence B)\n\nCMR should be utilized to assess the secondary effects of congenital coronary anomalies or acquired pathology such as effects on myocardial function (e.g., regional wall motion abnormalities, end-diastolic volume, ejection fraction), perfusion and infarction (Class I, Level of evidence B) both prior to and after repair (if surgery) or in followup.\n\nCoarctation of the Aorta and Bicuspid Aortic Valve\n\nBackground\n\nCoarctation of the aorta is the most common left sided obstructive heart lesion with a mean incidence of 409 per million live births11 and a prevalence of ~ 7% of patients with CHD.198 Coarctation is a discrete or relatively discrete narrowing of the proximal descending thoracic aorta, most commonly located in the juxtaductal region, immediately distal to the left subclavian artery (Figure ) although it may occur anywhere in the thoracic (Figure ) and abdominal aorta. It can be simple or complex with arch hypoplasia and tortuosity and associated with other significant intracardiac CHD such as HLHS, TGA or truncus arteriosus. Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is frequently identified in patients with coarctation with studies reporting an incidence of > 50% and up to 85% (Figure ).250 Coarctation is part of a spectrum of aortopathies; genetic aortopathies are addressed elsewhere in this manuscript.\n\nIf not detected prenatally or with pulse oximetry screening, neonates with coarctation of the aorta may present in clinical distress with significant metabolic acidosis and respiratory failure at the time of ductal closure.251 The lesion may be ductal dependent, requiring prostaglandin infusion and other supportive measures for resuscitation and survival of the patient until more definitive treatment can be undertaken. Accurate detailed diagnosis is essential prior to any intervention. Echocardiography is the first line imaging modality and may be all that is needed in infants with simple coarctation or associated intracardiac defects. If portions of the aorta proximal or distal to the coarctation or branching vessels are not well visualized, CMR can provide full anatomical details and may be superior to echocardiography.252\n\nCoarctation may also present later in childhood or early adulthood, usually in the setting of referral for hypertension or heart murmur and diminished lower extremity pulses. Depending on the age of the patient, chest X-ray may demonstrate rib notching such as when significant large collateral vessels may be present. When a native coarctation of the aorta is first diagnosed in an older child or adult by echocardiography, CMR is then used to define the anatomical and hemodynamic severity in preparation for treatment by surgery or in the cardiac cath lab. Echocardiography may demonstrate the unusual arch anatomy and abnormal Doppler flow patterns through the obstruction, but due to limited acoustic windows, may not allow for full visualization of the coarctation or its proximal and distal segments, aortic arch branching abnormalities, or the presence and magnitude of associated collateral vessels which are all important pieces of clinical information to aid in determining the appropriate method of intervention.\n\nIn infancy and early childhood, coarctation of the aorta is most commonly repaired surgically with methods including subclavian flap repair, patch aortoplasty and simple or extended end-to-end anastomosis. In some situations, coarctation may be initially treated with balloon angioplasty with or without placement of a stent. In more unusual complex anatomical situations, bypassing the severe arch obstruction with a LV apical or ascending to descending aorta conduit may be rarely undertaken (Figure ). Regardless of method of initial repair, long-term complications that require monitoring include residual coarctation, recoarctation, associated arch hypoplasia or tortuosity, aneurysm formation near the site of repair (Figure ), dissection, hypertension and endocarditis. Abnormalities of the aorta will often impact LV function. Long-standing hypertension leads to LV hypertrophy and ventricular dysfunction, as well as increased incidence of coronary heart disease and multiple other sequelae eventually leading to premature morbidity and mortality.253,254\n\nIndication for CMR\n\nImportant anatomic and hemodynamic data is obtained with CMR having been utilized for many years in the assessment of coarctation of the aorta. Multiple techniques, including non-contrast and contrast CMR sequences are used to provide a complete anatomical 3D analysis (Figure ). Collateral vessels can be visualized providing flow to the descending aorta distal to the obstruction and CMR can be utilized to quantify this flow both prior to and after intervention (See Colateral flow section of this document) (Figure ).255–260 Anatomic measurements throughout the aorta can be applied and compared to published normative data.261 Cine bSSFP provides visualization of the flow disturbance in the narrowed and dilated regions of the aorta and PC-CMR is used to assess flow, estimate gradients (Figure )262 and quantify collateral flow255,256,258–260 (see Qp/Qs and collateral flow section).\n\nCMR is used as preplanning for intervention, as well as continued surveillance of the entire aorta and function of the systemic ventricle.263 After surgical coarctation repair, CMR is the preferred imaging modality.252,264,265 Monitoring for restenosis is important and visualization of collaterals and measurement of flow volume increase from the coarctation repair site to the diaphragm aorta level is more reliable for assessment of recoarctation than arm-leg blood pressure drop.259 Aneurysms may occur at the repair site (Figure ) and patients with poorly controlled hypertension may be at risk for dissection. The most cost-effective approach to care of patients with coarctation after balloon angioplasty or surgical repair is clinical assessment and CMR in every patient.266 In adults, guidelines recommend CMR imaging of coarctation repair for routine follow up at intervals as much as every 1–3 years depending on the patient’s physiologic state1 and similar reasoning may be thought of in older children and young adults.\n\nAfter stent placement, CMR is safe and may be chosen to evaluate areas around the stent and other vascular or intracardiac concerns, including BAV, as well as the effects of residual abnormalities such as LV hypertrophy, cardiac index and collateral flow but is not absolutely dependable for visualizing the interior of the stent although dark blood imaging can visualize patency (but not exact dimensions). With the advent of ferumoxytol, in stent visualization has improved for bright blood imaging but exact dimensions remains still elusive. If visualization of the interior of the stent is needed, CT and invasive angiography may be performed.\n\nBesides collateral flow measurements and cardiac index, 4-dimensional (4D) flow CMR imaging has been utilized to determine flow and visualize 4D flow patterns in coarctation of the aorta both prior to and after repair.267–269 There has also been recent work using 4D flow CMR to measure pressure drop in the aorta of patients with coarctation.270,271 Although promising, 4D flow is not yet routinely performed in clinical practice across all centers.\n\nPhysiologic assessment of the effects of coarctation on the LV can be assessed by CMR as it is the gold standard for this evaluation.272 LV mass, ventricular volumes, global and regional ventricular dysfunction should be routinely assessed. LV myocardial strain can be assessed using tissue or feature tracking and can be abnormal with LV hypertrophy and systemic hypertension.273 Diffuse fibrosis and increased ECV may be increased in hypertensive heart disease,94,274 although not routinely performed clinically. All of these methods for determining LV status will provide important data for making clinical decisions.\n\nSummary of Recommendations\n\nAt the initial diagnosis of coarctation by echocardiography, CMR is recommended to provide conclusive anatomical and functional details needed prior to treatment or to decide if treatment is needed including anatomy of the coarctation, LV hypertrophy, cardiac index and the presence of a BAV etc. if these are not fully delineated by echocardiography (Class I, level of evidence B).\n\nCMR is reasonable to assess collateral flow in patients with coarctation of the aorta, especially if it is unclear from other criteria that treatment is needed (Class IIA, level of evidence B).\n\nAfter surgical repair of coarctation, CMR is indicated to monitor the status of the aorta and to visualize restenosis or aneurysm formation (Class I, level of evidence B).\n\nAfter stent placement, CMR can be useful to provide anatomic and hemodynamic assessment of the aorta surrounding the stent, but not to accurately visualize in-stent stenosis (Class IIA, level of evidence B).\n\nAfter coarctation repair, CMR is recommended to assess the aorta and LV function every 1–3 years in children and adolescents, similar to adults, if echocardiography is insufficient or pathology is suspected (Class I, level of evidence B).\n\nCMR holds the potential to assess LV myocardial strain and diffuse fibrosis/increased ECV in patients with coarctation to assess effects on the LV and may be considered for this purpose (Class IIB, level of evidence B).\n\nBicuspid Aortic Valve\n\nBackground\n\nBAV is the most common congenital cardiac abnormality with a prevalence estimated from 0.5 to 2% in the general population and has a 2:1 male to female ratio.11,275,276 Some families demonstrate an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern.277 Unless associated with significant stenosis or regurgitation or other LV outflow tract lesions, young individuals are often asymptomatic (Figure ). Critical and moderate to severe aortic stenosis associated with abnormal valve morphology often requires intervention during infancy or early childhood. Later in life, patients may be at risk for associated complications such as ascending aortic dilation with aneurysms (Figure ) and dissection, aortic stenosis, AR, and endocarditis, all of which could eventually require aortic valve replacement and other aortic surgery. Many cases of BAV diagnosed after childhood may not need intervention until after the fourth decade and beyond.\n\nThere are multiple types of valve morphology under the rubric of BAV in children and adolescents.278 The most common type is fusion of the right and left coronary commissures (70%) followed by fusion of the right and non-coronary commissures (28%); fusion of the left and non-coronary commissures is the least common. The vast majority of patients with coarctation have fusion of the right and left coronary commissures while fusion of the right and non-coronary commissures is most commonly associated with aortic regurgitation.278 Other types of morphology include partial or complete fusion of one or more of the commissures of the coronary cusps with associated cusp asymmetry and complete or incomplete raphe, as well as “true” symmetric BAV cusps without raphe. Some severely malformed valves are labeled “unicommissural” which may or may not be classified under this label (Figure ).279,280\n\nIndication for CMR in BAV\n\nHistorically, TTE, when acoustic windows are adequate, has been reported as highly sensitive and specific for diagnosing BAV.281 If not well visualized by echocardiography, CMR can determine aortic valve anatomy (Figures , ). In a more recent analysis comparing pathology specimens with TTE and CMR images, the ability to assess valve morphology was higher with CMR when compared to TTE (96% vs 73%).282 Valve morphology has not been definitely associated with severity of disease other than a small subgroup of patients with preferential dilation of the sinuses of Valsalva who have right-left coronary cusp fusion. Flow abnormalities associated with the different types of aortic valve have been characterized, but clinical implications are still being identified.279\n\nFor aortic valve morphology, CMR planimetry for aortic valve area has been demonstrated to have the best sensitivity and specificity of all non-invasive methods when compared to invasive catheterization and has high reliability and reproducibility.283–285 Valve area by CMR can be obtained using velocity time integrals and compares favorably to echocardiography.286 Other ways to measure aortic valve area by CMR include Hakki’s formula287 and the continuity equation.\n\nCMR can assess hemodynamic effects of associated stenosis and AR from aortic valve disease. This includes LV hypertrophy and dilation as well as functional volumetric analysis, changes in strain or fibrosis and ECV expansion. In those with significant aortic valve dysfunction, CMR is advantageous for serial evaluation of LV volumes and mass. The standard for determining ventricular sizes and volumes is CMR.272 Though quantitative evaluation of AR volume can be calculated by the difference between RV and LV volumes (assuming no intracardiac shunting, atrioventricular valve insufficiency or PR), PC-CMR sequences allow for direct measurement of forward and reverse volume used to calculate a regurgitant fraction, as well as peak velocity of the jet in the prescribed plane286; checks on the data include subtracting the flow of caval return, main PA flow or the sum of branch PA flowfrom aortic forward flow making CMR more accurate. CMR also allows for assessment of myocardial blood flow with first-pass perfusion at rest and stress, as well as tissue characterization with myocardial LGE for fibrosis and viability. All this information by CMR provides assistance in determining timing for aortic valve intervention or replacement.3\n\nCMR allows for evaluation of the ascending aorta (Figure ) as it relates to BAV disease and should be utilized when the morphology of the aortic root or ascending aorta cannot be viewed well or measured accurately by echocardiography. Once the aorta is dilated, serial yearly evaluation should occur.288 Because of its strong association with coarctation of the aorta, patients diagnosed with a BAV should also undergo imaging for coarctation of the aorta.250 CMR has also been used to evaluate shear wall stress of the aorta in patients with BAV.289 See Genetic Aortopathy section and the 4D flow imaging subsection.\n\nSummary of Recommendations\n\nIf echocardiography is unable to visualize morphology of a BAV or visualize the aortic root or ascending aorta adequately, CMR is indicated to provide the needed information. (Class I, level of evidence B)\n\nCMR should be used for serial monitoring in the setting of BAV valve with associated aortic stenosis or AR and to quantify these hemodynamics (Class I, level of evidence B).\n\nCMR is useful for serial monitoring of the size of the aortic root and ascending aorta in the setting of BAV. (Class I, Level of Evidence B)\n\nCMR is recommended for serial monitoring of the effects of aortic stenosis and AR on the LV (e.g. LV volumes, EF and mass) (Class I, Level of Evidence B) and to obtain direct measurement of AR volume, peak flow velocity and aortic valve area when determining need for aortic valve/aortic surgery (Class IIA, Level of Evidence B).\n\nCMR is beneficial to determine lesions associated with BAV such as coarctation of the aorta, interrupted aortic arch other left sided obstructed lesions (Class I, Level of Evidence B).\n\nGenetic Aortopathy\n\nBackground\n\nGenetic disorders associated with aortopathy include Marfan syndrome (MFS), autosomal dominant Vascular Ehlers-Danlos (EDS), Loeys-Dietz (LDS), aneurysms-osteoarthritis syndromes, Turner syndrome, Noonan Syndrome and non-syndromic familial thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections (FTAAD). These group of disorders are associated with altered connective tissue composition leading to a combination of cardiovascular, skeletal and often ocular manifestations.\n\nThe cardiovascular features include valvular and vascular disease, in particular aortic dilatation with increased risk of dissection, aneurysm, rupture and death. The aortic dilation most often affects the aortic root and ascending aorta but can also affect the more distal aorta including the transverse arch and descending aorta. These disorders have variable effect on other cardiac structures. For example, mitral valve prolapse (MVP) is a feature of MFS and LDS, but not EDS, which in turn has a higher risk of coronary artery dissections than the other aortopathies. Turner syndrome is due to the partial absence of an X chromosome, and phenotypically has short stature and ovarian insufficiency, in addition to aortic dilatation, BAV, PAPVR and aortic coarctation. Noonan Syndrome is considered a renin-angiotensin system (RAS)opathy, a group of disorders which have mutations in the signaling proteins for RAS/mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and results in cardiovascular, facial and lymphatic anomalies. Inheritance and penetrance of all these conditions is variable, with many patients representing new sporadic mutations. The diagnosis of these conditions is most often in infancy, due to the combination of musculoskeletal, facial and cardiovascular anomalies. However, the progressive nature of the associated vasculopathy means that lifelong cardiovascular imaging surveillance is required. Table contains a summary of the genetic aortopathies.\n\nIndications for CMR\n\nAortic Size Measurements\n\nA small study comparing reproducibility of aortic measurements at multiple levels in both pediatric BAV and genetic aortopathy patients showed that echocardiography derived measurements were systematically smaller by 5–7% and were less reproducible than CMR measurements, particularly in dilated aortic roots and in the descending aorta.290 Most of the genetic aortopathy patients have the potential for complex abnormalities that may affect the entire aorta necessitating comprehensive evaluations. Furthermore, the presence of concomitant skeletal abnormalities renders echocardiography less reliable due to poor acoustic windows. The need for accurate and reproducible aortic size measurements is of utmost importance as aortic size is considered a surrogate for aortic dissection, surveillance recommendations and surgical interventions in genetic aortopathies.291 The 2010 published guidelines for diagnosis and management of thoracic aortic diseases including genetic aortopathies with surgical repair recommendations for genetic aortopathies are purely based upon aortic size.291\n\nThe aortopathy in Turner syndrome is complicated by the presence of short stature necessitating a Turner specific z-score (TSZ) developed for 2D echocardiography.292 In patients > 15 years of age, a unique index, the aortic size index (ASI), was proposed (ASI = maximum aortic diameter/bodysurface area) and has been shown to be a better predictor of vascular complications than traditional Turner z score analysis.293 The AHA recently published a scientific statement on the management of Turner syndrome and recommends CMR at diagnosis and CMR surveillance due to the high incidence of undiagnosed vascular anomalies such as coarctation, PAPVC, systemic venous anomalies and coronary anomalies. In low risk Turner syndrome patients, imaging surveillance can be performed every 5–10 years, but with increased frequency of surveillance in patients with high ASIs (> 2.3 cm/m2).294\n\nThe natural history of most genetic aortopathies is one of a thinned aortic wall which progressively dilates and loses distensibility thereby heightening the risks of aneurysm formation and dissection throughout its length, but particularly at the root.295 Cohort studies have shown that nearly 60% of MFS patients will have aortic root dilatation by age 35 years and that the aorta increases further with age.296–298\n\nValvular Disease\n\nAs the root dilates, aortic leaflets fail to fully coapt and AR increases. Echocardiography is the mainstay of AR surveillance but a systematic review of 11 articles comparing quantification of AR by CMR to semiquantitative evaluation with echocardiography confirmed that direct aortic measurements using PC-CMR at the sinotubular junction/aortic valve are highly reproducible and accurate and predicts those who progress to surgery with high overall sensitivity and specificity.299 Similarly, the 2014 AHA/ACC guidelines recommend CMR for quantification of AR in patients with moderate or severe AR with suboptimal echocardiography images and evaluation of LV systolic function and volumes.300 Atrioventricular valve disease is more common in MFS compared to other genetic aortopathies with some studies demonstrating > 65% prevalence of mitral valve disorders. Infants and children with MFS present early with tricuspid and mitral valve fibroxanthomatous thickening and prolapse.301,302 CMR has emerged as an important noninvasive modality to diagnose and characterize MVP and help quantify mitral regurgitation.303–306\n\nLeft Ventricular Function\n\nDilated cardiomyopathy is an under-recognized clinical feature of aortopathy syndromes. Myocardial dysfunction is often considered to be the consequence of valvular insufficiency and ventricular volume overload,307 however, in a subgroup of aortopathy patients without significant valvular dysfunction or aortic dilatation, subclinical cardiac dysfunction has been described,308 attributed to a combination of increased aortic wall stiffness and extracellular matrix abnormalities. CMR is the reference standard for evaluating biventricular function as mentioned previously3,309 and can be used to evaluate ventricular performance.\n\nSystemic Vascular Screen\n\nAlthough aortic aneurysms generally occur at the aortic root in many patients (Figure ), approximately 50% of patients with LDS syndrome have aneurysms remote from the aortic root, including the head and neck vessels, intracranial berry aneurysms, abdominal branch arterial aneurysms and iliac artery aneurysms. Current recommendations are that LDS patients have annual CT/CMR examination from head to pelvis. CMR, which avoids ionizing radiation and ability to combine both non-contrast and contrast enhanced angiography to achieve whole body evaluations, has distinct advantages over a full body CT with runoff, especially for repeat examinations over time. Non-vascular abnormalities including Chiari I malformation, vertebral subluxations, diaphragmatic hernias, pectus abnormalities and scoliosis are frequently unsuspected clinical findings found on whole body evaluations.310 Patients with Turner syndrome have increased incidence of PAPVC, systemic venous anomalies such as left SVC/interrupted IVC, congenital portosystemic shunts and coronary artery anomalies, many of which are not appreciated on echocardiography, yet relatively easily appreciated on CMR.\n\nAortic Dissection\n\nAortic dissection is a catastrophic complication of aortic wall disease associated with high mortality and morbidity. In acute symptomatic dissection, rapid imaging diagnosis is essential. CMR can be used to diagnose dissection, distinguish aortic pseudoaneurysm from dissection and assess intimal flaps and aortic branch vessel involvement.311–313 Multiple CMR sequences, both contrast and non-contrast enhanced, all provide specific and unique information including exact positioning of the intimal flap and ability to distinguish slow flow from thrombus in the false lumen.\n\nVertebral Tortuosity Index (VTI)314\n\nIncreased arterial tortuosity of the head and neck vessels, particularly the vertebral arteries, has been described in LDS, MFS and Turner syndrome (Figure ) and can be calculated easily by CMR. VTI is defined as [(actual vertebral artery length/straight vertebral artery length-1) × 100] measured from vertebral artery origin to C2 if included in the study. Higher VTIs (> 50) have been associated with major adverse clinical outcomes, including a more severely dilated aortic root, increased rate of cardiac surgery, younger age at dissection and death.314\n\n4D-Flow CMR in Aortopathies\n\n(Figure ) Hemodynamic quantification is a major advantage of CMR over other imaging modalities in genetic aortopathy. Multiple studies have demonstrated that BAV-related aortopathy patients, expressing abnormal wall shear stress, may develop significant alterations in elastin fiber and extracellular matrix protein compositions predisposing patients to further aortic dilatation and heightened risk for dissection.315,316 Less is known about genetic aortopathies, however, emerging 4D- flow CMR data suggests that similar findings are present in pediatric genetic aortopathy patients and become more pronounced over time.317,318\n\nAdvantages of CMR MR has been shown to be very accurate in the diagnosis of thoracic aortic disease with sensitivities and specificities that can exceed echocardiography.319–321 CMR provides a multiplanar evaluation of the thoracic aorta and its branch vessels and can conceiva"
