        "text": "Abstract\n\nNusinersen has shown significant functional motor benefit in the milder types of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). Less is known on the respiratory outcomes in patients with nusinersen-treated SMA. The aim of this study was to describe changes in respiratory function in pediatric patients with SMA type 2 and 3 on regular treatment with nusinersen within the iSMAc international cohort and to compare their trajectory with the natural history (NH) data published by the consortium in 2020.This is a 5-year retrospective observational study of pediatric SMA type 2 and nonambulant type 3 (age ≤18 years) treated with nusinersen. The primary objective was to compare the slopes of decline in forced vital capacity % predicted (FVC% pred.), FVC, and age when FVC dropped below 60% between the treated patients and a control group from the natural history cohort. Data on peak cough flow and the use of noninvasive ventilation (NIV) and cough assist were collected.Data were available for 69 treated patients, 53 were SMA type 2 and 16 type 3. The mean (SD) age at first injection was 8.5 (3.2) and 9.7 (3.7) years, respectively. The median (interquartile range) treatment duration was 1 (0.7; 1.9) and 1.2 (0.9; 1.9) years, respectively. At the time of the first nusinersen injection, 24 of 52 (46%) patients with SMA type 2 and 2 of 16 (13%) patients with SMA type 3 were on NIV. Forty-three of 53 (81%) and 4 of 16 (25%) patients used cough device. FVC% pred. in treated patients with SMA type 2 declined annually by 2.3% vs 3.9% in NH (p = 0.08) and in treated patients with type 3 by 2.6% vs 3.4% NH (p = 0.59). Patients treated reached FVC <60% later than untreated (12.1 vs 10 years, p = 0.05). A higher percentage of treated vs untreated patients maintained FVC% pred. equal/above their baseline after 12 (65% vs 36%) and 24 (50% vs 24%) months, respectively. NIV use among treated did not significantly change throughout 1-year follow-up.This study included the largest real-world cohort of pediatric patients with milder SMA types. The results suggest a positive role of nusinersen in delaying the respiratory decline in patients treated longer than 1 year when compared with natural history. Larger cohorts and longer observation are planned.This study provided Class III evidence that nusinersen slows progression for patients with SMA types 2 and 3 compared with a natural history cohort.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1212/CPJ.0000000000200298\n\nView details for PubMedID 38932995\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC11196214\n\nAbstract\n\nSeveral studies have shown the efficacy of new disease-modifying therapies in slowing down type II SMA progression using the Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded (HFMSE). This research aims to enhance understanding of activity changes across age groups post-nusinersen treatment using shift analysis, compared with untreated individuals. Retrospective data from the, international SMA consortium (iSMAc) dataset were analyzed, assessing individual item changes over 12 months. Shift analysis was used to determine the gain or loss of abilities, defining \"gain\" as a positive change between scores from 0 to either 1 or 2 and \"loss\" as a negative change from either 2 or 1 to 0. The cohort included 130 SMA II patients who underwent 12-month assessments from their first nusinersen dose, with age range between 0.6 and 49.6 years. One-third of the entire cohort experienced at least a loss in one activity, while 60% experienced a gain, particularly notable in children aged 2.5 to 5 years and 5 to 13 years. Overall, the study demonstrates a positive impact of nusinersen treatment on SMA II patients, showing a trend of increased activity gains and decreased probability of ability loss across different age groups.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.nmd.2024.05.003\n\nView details for PubMedID 38936290\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: The natural history of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is well understood, with progressive muscle weakness resulting in declines in function. The development of contractures is common and negatively impacts function. Clinically, joint hypermobility (JH) is observed but is poorly described, and its relationship with function is unknown. Methods: Lower-limb ROM (range of motion) assessments of extension and flexion at the hip, knee, and ankle were performed. ROMs exceeding the published norms were included in the analysis. The functional assessments performed included the six-minute walk test (6 MWT) and the Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale-Expanded (HFMSE). Results: Of the 143 participants, 86% (n = 123) had at least one ROM measure that was hypermobile, and 22% (n = 32) had three or more. The HFMSE scores were inversely correlated with hip extension JH (r = -0.60, p = 0.21; n = 6) and positively correlated with knee flexion JH (r = 0.24, p = 0.02, n = 89). There was a moderate, inverse relationship between the 6 MWT distance and ankle plantar flexion JH (r = -0.73, p = 0.002; n = 15). Conclusions: JH was identified in nearly all participants in at least one joint in this study. Hip extension, knee flexion and ankle plantar flexion JH was associated with function. A further understanding of the trajectory of lower-limb joint ROM is needed to improve future rehabilitation strategies.\n\nView details for DOI 10.3390/jcm13092634\n\nView details for PubMedID 38731167\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC11084694\n\nAbstract\n\nSpinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a rare and progressive neuromuscular disorder with varying severity levels. The aim of the study was to calculate minimal clinically important difference (MCID), minimal detectable change (MDC), and values for the Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded (HFMSE) in an untreated international SMA cohort.The study employed two distinct methods. MDC was calculated using distribution-based approaches to consider standard error of measurement and effect size change in a population of 321 patients (176 SMA II and 145 SMA III), allowing for stratification based on age and function. MCID was assessed using anchor-based methods (receiver operating characteristic [ROC] curve analysis and standard error) on 76 patients (52 SMA II and 24 SMA III) for whom the 12-month HFMSE could be anchored to a caregiver-reported clinical perception questionnaire.With both approaches, SMA type II and type III patients had different profiles. The MCID, using ROC analysis, identified optimal cutoff points of -2 for type II and -4 for type III patients, whereas using the standard error we found the optimal cutoff points to be 1.5 for improvement and -3.2 for deterioration. Furthermore, distribution-based methods uncovered varying values across age and functional status subgroups within each SMA type.These results emphasize that the interpretation of a single MCID or MDC value obtained in large cohorts with different functional status needs to be made with caution, especially when these may be used to assess possible responses to new therapies.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1111/ene.16309\n\nView details for PubMedID 38656662\n\nAbstract\n\nCurrently approved therapies for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) reverse the degenerative course, leading to better functional outcome, but they do not address the impairment arising from preexisting neurodegeneration. Apitegromab, an investigational, fully human monoclonal antibody, inhibits activation of myostatin (a negative regulator of skeletal muscle growth), thereby preserving muscle mass. The phase 2 TOPAZ trial assessed the safety and efficacy of apitegromab in individuals with later-onset type 2 and type 3 SMA.In this study, designed to investigate potential meaningful combinations of eligibility and treatment regimen for future studies, participants aged 2-21 years received IV apitegromab infusions every 4 weeks for 12 months in 1 of 3 cohorts. Cohort 1 stratified ambulatory participants aged 5-21 years into 2 arms (apitegromab 20 mg/kg alone or in combination with nusinersen); cohort 2 evaluated apitegromab 20 mg/kg combined with nusinersen in nonambulatory participants aged 5-21 years; and cohort 3 blindly evaluated 2 randomized apitegromab doses (2 and 20 mg/kg) combined with nusinersen in younger participants ≥2 years of age. The primary efficacy measure was mean change from baseline using the Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale version appropriate for each cohort. Data were analyzed using a paired t test with 2-sided 5% type 1 error for the mean change from baseline for predefined cohort-specific primary efficacy end points.Fifty-eight participants (mean age 9.4 years) were enrolled at 16 trial sites in the United States and Europe. Participants had been treated with nusinersen for a mean of 25.9 months before enrollment in any of the 3 trial cohorts. At month 12, the mean change from baseline in Hammersmith scale score was -0.3 points (95% CI -2.1 to 1.4) in cohort 1 (n = 23), 0.6 points (-1.4 to 2.7) in cohort 2 (n = 15), and in cohort 3 (n = 20), the mean scores were 5.3 (-1.5 to 12.2) and 7.1 (1.8 to 12.5) for the 2-mg/kg (n = 8) and 20-mg/kg (n = 9) arms, respectively. The 5 most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse events were headache (24.1%), pyrexia (22.4%), upper respiratory tract infection (22.4%), cough (22.4%), and nasopharyngitis (20.7%). No deaths or serious adverse reactions were reported.Apitegromab led to improved motor function in participants with later-onset types 2 and 3 SMA. These results support a randomized, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial of apitegromab in participants with SMA.This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03921528).This study provides Class III evidence that apitegromab improves motor function in later-onset types 2 and 3 spinal muscular atrophy.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1212/WNL.0000000000209151\n\nView details for PubMedID 38330285\n\nAbstract\n\nSpinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a neuromuscular disorder characterised by progressive motor function decline. Motor function is assessed using several functional outcome measures including the Revised Hammersmith Scale (RHS).In this study, we present longitudinal trajectories for the RHS in an international cohort of 149 untreated paediatric SMA 2 and 3 patients (across 531 assessments collected between March 2015 and July 2019).We contextualise these trajectories using both the Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded (HFMSE) and Revised Upper Limb Module (RULM). At baseline, this cohort included 50% females and 15% of patients had undergone spinal fusion surgery. Patient trajectories were modelled using a natural cubic spline with age, sex, and random effects for each patient.RHS and HFMSE scores show similar trends over time in this cohort not receiving disease modifying therapies. The results confirm the strong correlation between the RHS and RULM previously observed in SMA types 2 and 3a. Scoliosis surgery is associated with a reduction of 3 points in the RHS, 4.5 points in the HFMSE for the SMA 2 population, and a reduction of 11.8 points in the RHS, and 13.4 points in the HFMSE for the SMA 3a populations. When comparing the RHS and RULM, there is a lower correlation in the type 3a's than the type 2 patients. In the SMA 2 population, there is no significant difference between the sexes in either the RHS or HFMSE trajectories. There is no significant difference in the RULM trajectory in the SMA 2 or 3a participants by sex.This study demonstrates that the RHS could be used in conjunction with other functional measures such as the RULM to holistically detect SMA disease progression. This will assist with fully understanding changes that occur with treatments, further defining trajectories and therapy outcomes.\n\nView details for DOI 10.3233/JND-230211\n\nView details for PubMedID 38427497\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: Long-term, real-world effectiveness and safety data of disease-modifying treatments for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) are important for assessing outcomes and providing information for a larger number and broader range of SMA patients than included in clinical trials.OBJECTIVE: We sought to describe patients with SMA treated with onasemnogene abeparvovec monotherapy in the real-world setting.METHODS: RESTORE is a prospective, multicenter, multinational, observational registry that captures data from a variety of sources.RESULTS: Recruitment started in September 2018. As of May 23, 2022, data were available for 168 patients treated with onasemnogene abeparvovec monotherapy. Median (IQR) age at initial SMA diagnosis was 1 (0-6) month and at onasemnogene abeparvovec infusion was 3 (1-10) months. Eighty patients (47.6%) had two and 70 (41.7%) had three copies of SMN2, and 98 (58.3%) were identified by newborn screening. Infants identified by newborn screening had a lower age at final assessment (mean age 11.5 months) and greater mean final (SD) CHOP INTEND score (57.0 [10.0] points) compared with clinically diagnosed patients (23.1 months; 52.1 [8.0] points). All patients maintained/achieved motor milestones. 48.5% (n = 81/167) experienced at least one treatment-emergent adverse event (AE), and 31/167 patients (18.6%) experienced at least one serious AE, of which 8/31 were considered treatment-related.CONCLUSION: These real-world outcomes support findings from the interventional trial program and demonstrate effectiveness of onasemnogene abeparvovec over a large patient population, which was consistent with initial clinical data and published 5-year follow-up data. Observed AEs were consistent with the established safety profile of onasemnogene abeparvovec.\n\nView details for DOI 10.3233/JND-230122\n\nView details for PubMedID 38250783\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground and purpose: At 12months in the phase 2 TOPAZ study, treatment with apitegromab was associated with both an improved motor function in patients with Type 2 or 3 spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and with a favorable safety profile. This manuscript reports the extended efficacy and safety in the nonambulatory group of the TOPAZ study at 36months.Methods: Patients who completed the primary study (NCT03921528) could enroll in an open-label extension, during which patients received apitegromab 20mg/kg by intravenous infusion every 4weeks. Patients were assessed periodically via the Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale-Expanded (HFMSE), Revised Upper Limb Module (RULM), World Health Organization (WHO) motor development milestones, Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory Computer Adaptive Test (PEDI-CAT) Daily Activities and Mobility domains, and Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Fatigue questionnaire.Results: Of the 58 patients enrolled in TOPAZ, 35 were nonambulatory (mean age 7.3years). The mean change at 36months in HFMSE score from baseline was +4.0 (standard deviation [SD]: 7.54), and+2.4 (3.24) for RULM score (excluding n=7 after scoliosis surgery). Caregiver-reported outcomes (PEDI-CAT and PROMIS Fatigue) showed improvements from baseline over 36months. In addition, most patients (28/32) improved or maintained WHO motor milestones achieved at baseline. The most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse events were pyrexia (48.6%), nasopharyngitis (45.7%), COVID-19 infection (40.0%), vomiting (40.0%), and upper respiratory tract infection (31.4%).Conclusion: The benefit of apitegromab treatment observed at 12months was sustained at 36months with no new safety findings.\n\nView details for DOI 10.3389/fneur.2024.1419791\n\nView details for PubMedID 39105058\n\nAbstract\n\nOnasemnogene abeparvovec is a recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) vector-based gene therapy for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). Patients with elevated titers of anti-AAV9 antibodies (AAV9-Ab) should not receive onasemnogene abeparvovec because of potential safety and efficacy implications. We conducted a retrospective study to describe the seroprevalence of anti-AAV9 binding antibodies for pediatric patients with SMA in the United States. At initial testing, 13.0% (115 of 882) of patients (mean [SD] age, 26.29 [33.66] weeks) had elevated AAV9-Ab titers. The prevalence of elevated titers decreased as age increased, with 18.2% (92 of 507) of patients ≤3 months old but only 1.1% (1 of 92) of patients ≥21 months old having elevated titers. This suggests transplacental maternal transfer of antibodies. No patterns of geographic variations in AAV9-Ab prevalence were confirmed. Elevated AAV9-Ab titers in children <6 weeks old decreased in all circumstances. Lower magnitudes of elevated titers declined more rapidly than greater magnitudes. Retesting was completed at the discretion of the treating clinician, so age at testing and time between tests varied. AAV9-Ab retesting should be considered when patients have elevated titers, and elevations at a young age are not a deterrent to eventual onasemnogene abeparvovec administration. Early disease-modifying treatment for SMA leads to optimal outcomes.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.omtm.2023.101117\n\nView details for PubMedID 37822718\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC10562739\n\nAbstract\n\nDisease-modifying treatments have transformed the natural history of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), but the cellular pathways altered by SMN restoration remain undefined and biomarkers cannot yet precisely predict treatment response. We performed an exploratory cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteomic study in a diverse sample of SMA patients treated with nusinersen to elucidate therapeutic pathways and identify predictors of motor improvement. Proteomic analyses were performed on CSF samples collected before treatment (T0) and at 6 months (T6) using an Olink panel to quantify 1113 peptides. A supervised machine learning approach was used to identify proteins that discriminated patients who improved functionally from those who did not after 2 years of treatment. A total of 49 SMA patients were included (10 type 1, 18 type 2, and 21 type 3), ranging in age from 3 months to 65 years. Most proteins showed a decrease in CSF concentration at T6. The machine learning algorithm identified ARSB, ENTPD2, NEFL, and IFI30 as the proteins most predictive of improvement. The machine learning model was able to predict motor improvement at 2 years with 79.6% accuracy. The results highlight the potential application of CSF biomarkers to predict motor improvement following SMA treatment. Validation in larger datasets is needed.\n\nView details for DOI 10.3390/jcm12206696\n\nView details for PubMedID 37892834\n\nAbstract\n\nNusinersen has been shown to improve or stabilize motor function in individuals with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). We evaluated baseline scoliosis severity and motor function in nusinersen-treated non-ambulatory children with later-onset SMA. Post hoc analyses were conducted on 95 children initiating nusinersen treatment in the CHERISH study or SHINE long-term extension trial. Participants were categorized by baseline Cobb angle (first nusinersen dose): ≤10°, >10° to ≤20°, and >20° to <40° (no/mild/moderate scoliosis, respectively). Outcome measures included the Hammersmith Functional Motor Score-Expanded (HFMSE) and the Revised Upper Limb Module (RULM). Regression analysis determined the relationships between baseline scoliosis severity and later motor function. For children with no, mild, and moderate scoliosis, the mean increase in HFMSE from baseline to Day 930 was 6.0, 3.9, and 0.7 points, and in RULM was 6.1, 4.6, and 2.3 points. In the linear model, a 10° increase in baseline Cobb angle was significantly associated with a -1.4 (95% CI -2.6, -0.2) point decrease in HFMSE (p = 0.02) and a -1.2 (95% CI -2.1, -0.4) point decrease in RULM (p = 0.006) at Day 930. Treatment with nusinersen was associated with improvements/stabilization in motor function in all groups, with greater response in those with no/mild scoliosis at baseline.\n\nView details for DOI 10.3390/jcm12154901\n\nView details for PubMedID 37568304\n\nAbstract\n\nMuscle atrophy, muscle weakness and localised pain are commonly reported following musculoskeletal injury (MSKI). To mitigate this risk and prepare individuals to return to sport or physically demanding occupations, resistance training (RT) is considered a vital component of rehabilitation. However, to elicit adaptations in muscle strength, exercise guidelines recommend lifting loads ≥ 70% of an individual's one repetition maximum (1-RM). Unfortunately, individuals with persistent knee pain are often unable to tolerate such high loads and this may negatively impact the duration and extent of their recovery. Low load blood flow restriction (LL-BFR) is an alternative RT technique that has demonstrated improvements in muscle strength, hypertrophy, and pain in the absence of high mechanical loading. However, the effectiveness of high-frequency LL-BFR in a residential rehabilitation environment remains unclear. This study will compare the efficacy of high frequency LL-BFR to 'conventional' heavier load resistance training (HL-RT) on measures of physical function and pain in adults with persistent knee pain.This is a multicentre randomised controlled trial (RCT) of 150 UK service personnel (aged 18-55) admitted for a 3-week residential rehabilitation course with persistent knee pain. Participants will be randomised to receive: a) LL-BFR delivered twice daily at 20% 1-RM or b) HL-RT three-times per week at 70% 1-RM. Outcomes will be recorded at baseline (T1), course discharge (T2) and at three-months following course (T3). The primary outcome will be the lower extremity functional scale (LEFS) at T2. Secondary outcomes will include patient reported perceptions of pain, physical and occupational function and objective measures of muscle strength and neuromuscular performance. Additional biomechanical and physiological mechanisms underpinning both RT interventions will also be investigated as part of a nested mechanistic study.LL-BFR is a rehabilitation modality that has the potential to induce positive clinical adaptations in the absence of high mechanical loads and therefore could be considered a treatment option for patients suffering significant functional deficits who are unable to tolerate heavy load RT. Consequently, results from this study will have a direct clinical application to healthcare service providers and patients involved in the rehabilitation of physically active adults suffering MSKI.ClinicalTrials.org reference number, NCT05719922.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1186/s12891-023-06693-3\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 001032457700001\n\nView details for PubMedID 37461024\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC10351180\n\nAbstract\n\nMyotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is a genetic neuromuscular progressive multisystem disease that results in a broad spectrum of clinical central nervous system (CNS) involvement, including problems with memory, attention, executive functioning, and social cognition. Fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity along-tract data calculated using diffusion tensor imaging techniques play a vital role in assessing white matter microstructural changes associated with neurodegeneration caused by DM1. In this work, a novel spectrogram-based deep learning method is proposed to characterize white matter network alterations in DM1 with the goal of building a deep learning model as neuroimaging biomarkers of DM1. The proposed method is evaluated on fractional anisotropies and mean diffusivities along-tract data calculated for 25 major white matter tracts of 46 DM1 patients and 96 unaffected controls. The evaluation data consists of a total of 7100 spectrogram images. The model achieved 91% accuracy in identifying DM1, a significant improvement compared to previous methods.Clinical relevance- Clinical care of DM1 is particularly challenging due to DM1 multisystem involvement and the disease variability. Patients with DM1 often experience neurological and psychological symptoms, such as excessive sleepiness and apathy, that greatly impact their quality of life. Some of DM1 CNS symptoms may be responsive to treatment. The goal of this research is to gain a deeper understanding of the impact of DM1 on the CNS and to develop a deep learning model that can serve as a biomarker for the disease, with the potential to be used in future clinical trials as an outcome measure.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1109/EMBC40787.2023.10340468\n\nView details for PubMedID 38083393\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling indicates that the higher dose of nusinersen may be associated with a clinically meaningful increase in efficacy above that seen with the 12-mg approved dose.OBJECTIVE: Here we describe both the design of DEVOTE (NCT04089566), a 3-part clinical study evaluating safety, tolerability, and efficacy of higher dose of nusinersen, and results from the initial Part A.METHODS: DEVOTE Part A evaluates safety and tolerability of a higher nusinersen dose; Part B assesses efficacy in a randomized, double-blind design; and Part C assesses safety and tolerability of participants transitioning from the 12-mg dose to higher doses.RESULTS: In the completed Part A of DEVOTE, all 6 enrolled participants aged 6.1-12.6 years have completed the study. Four participants experienced treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), the majority of which were mild. Common TEAEs of headache, pain, chills, vomiting, and paresthesia were considered related to the lumbar puncture procedure. There were no safety concerns regarding clinical or laboratory parameters. Nusinersen levels in the cerebrospinal fluid were within the range of modeled predictions for higher dose of nusinersen. While Part A was not designed for assessing efficacy, most participants showed stabilization or improvement in motor function. Parts B and C of DEVOTE are ongoing.CONCLUSIONS: The findings from Part A of the DEVOTE study support further development of higher dose of nusinersen.\n\nView details for DOI 10.3233/JND-221667\n\nView details for PubMedID 37393513\n\nAbstract\n\nCharcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) due to GJB1 variants (CMTX1) is the second most common form of CMT. It is an X-linked disorder characterised by progressive sensory and motor neuropathy with males affected more severely than females. Many reported GJB1 variants remain classified as variants of uncertain significance (VUS). In this large, international, multicentre study we prospectively collected demographic, clinical and genetic data on patients with CMT associated with GJB1 variants. Pathogenicity for each variant was defined using adapted American College of Medical Genetics criteria. Baseline and longitudinal analyses were conducted to study genotype-phenotype correlations, to calculate longitudinal change using the CMT Examination Score (CMTES), to compare males versus females, and pathogenic/likely pathogenic (P/LP) variants versus VUS. We present 387 patients from 295 families harbouring 154 variants in GJB1. Of these, 319 patients (82.4%) were deemed to have P/LP variants, 65 had VUS (16.8%) and 3 benign variants (0.8%; excluded from analysis); an increased proportion of patients with P/LP variants compared with using ClinVar's classification (74.6%). Male patients (166/319, 52.0%, P/LP only) were more severely affected at baseline. Baseline measures in patients with P/LP variants and VUS showed no significant differences, and regression analysis suggested the disease groups were near identical at baseline. Genotype-phenotype analysis suggested c.-17G>A produces the most severe phenotype of the five most common variants, and missense variants in the intracellular domain are less severe than other domains. Progression of disease was seen with increasing CMTES over time up to 8 years follow-up. Standard response mean (SRM), a measure of outcome responsiveness, peaked at 3 years with moderate responsiveness (change in CMTES (DeltaCMTES) = 1.3 ± 2.6, p = 0.00016, SRM = 0.50). Males and females progressed similarly up to 8 years, but baseline regression analysis suggested that over a longer period, females progress more slowly. Progression was most pronounced for mild phenotypes (CMTES = 0-7; 3-year DeltaCMTES = 2.3 ± 2.5, p = 0.001, SRM = 0.90). Enhanced variant interpretation has yielded an increased proportion of GJB1 variants classified as P/LP and will aid future variant interpretation in this gene. Baseline and longitudinal analysis of this large cohort of CMTX1 patients describes the natural history of the disease including the rate of progression; CMTES showed moderate responsiveness for the whole group at 3 years and higher responsiveness for the mild group at 3, 4 and 5 years. These results have implications for patient selection for upcoming clinical trials.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1093/brain/awad187\n\nView details for PubMedID 37284795\n\nAbstract\n\nMyotonic dystrophy type 1 is a dominantly inherited multisystemic disease caused by CTG tandem repeat expansions in the DMPK 3' untranslated region. These expanded repeats are transcribed and produce toxic CUG RNAs that sequester and inhibit activities of the MBNL family of developmental RNA processing factors. Although myotonic dystrophy is classified as a muscular dystrophy, the brain is also severely affected by an unusual cohort of symptoms, including hypersomnia, executive dysfunction, as well as early onsets of tau/MAPT pathology and cerebral atrophy. To address the molecular and cellular events that lead to these pathological outcomes, we recently generated a mouse Dmpk CTG expansion knockin model and identified choroid plexus epithelial cells as particularly affected by the expression of toxic CUG expansion RNAs. To determine if toxic CUG RNAs perturb choroid plexus functions, alternative splicing analysis was performed on lateral and hindbrain choroid plexi from Dmpk CTG knockin mice. Choroid plexus transcriptome-wide changes were evaluated in Mbnl2 knockout mice, a developmental-onset model of myotonic dystrophy brain dysfunction. To determine if transcriptome changes also occurred in the human disease, we obtained post-mortem choroid plexus for RNA-seq from donors without neurologically unaffected (two females, three males; ages 50-70) and myotonic dystrophy type 1 donors (one female, three males; ages 50-70). To test that choroid plexus transcriptome alterations resulted in altered CSF composition, we obtained CSF via lumbar puncture from patients with myotonic dystrophy type 1 (five females, five males; ages 35-55) and non-myotonic dystrophy patients (three females, four males; ages 26-51) and Western blot and osmolarity analyses were used to test CSF alterations predicted by choroid plexus transcriptome analysis. We determined that CUG RNA induced toxicity was more robust in the lateral choroid plexus of Dmpk CTG knockin mice due to comparatively higher Dmpk and lower Mbnl RNA levels. Impaired transitions to adult splicing patterns during choroid plexus development were identified in Mbnl2 knockout mice, including mis-splicing previously found in Dmpk CTG knockin mice. Whole transcriptome analysis of myotonic dystrophy type 1 choroid plexus revealed disease-associated RNA expression and mis-splicing events. Based on these RNA changes, predicted alterations in ion homeostasis, secretory output, and CSF composition were confirmed by analysis of myotonic dystrophy type 1 CSF. Our results implicate choroid plexus spliceopathy and concomitant alterations in CSF homeostasis as an unappreciated contributor to myotonic dystrophy type 1 CNS pathogenesis.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1093/brain/awad148\n\nView details for PubMedID 37143315\n\nAbstract\n\nIn the previously reported Comparative Enzyme Replacement Trial With neoGAA Versus rhGAA (COMET) trial, avalglucosidase alfa treatment for 49 weeks showed clinically meaningful improvements in upright forced vital capacity (FVC) percent predicted and 6-minute walk test (6MWT) compared with alglucosidase alfa.To report avalglucosidase alfa treatment outcomes during the COMET trial extension.This phase 3 double-blind randomized clinical trial with crossover in the extension period enrolled patients 3 years and older with previously untreated late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD) between November 2, 2016, and February 10, 2021, with primary analysis after 49 weeks. Patients were treated at 55 referral centers in 20 countries. Efficacy outcomes were assessed at 97 weeks and safety outcomes to last follow-up, with data cutoff at February 10, 2021. Data were analyzed from May to June 2021.Random assignment (1:1) to receive 20 mg/kg of avalglucosidase alfa or alglucosidase alfa by intravenous infusion every other week for 49 weeks; thereafter, all patients received 20 mg/kg of avalglucosidase alfa every other week.The primary outcome was the least squares (LS) mean change from baseline in FVC percent predicted. Secondary outcomes included the LS mean change from baseline in 6MWT, muscle strength, motor function, quality of life, and disease biomarkers. Safety and tolerability were also assessed.Of 100 participants from the double-blind treatment period, 95 entered the extension period. Of these, 51 (54%) were men, and the mean (range) age was 48.3 (10-79) years. At the start of this study, mean upright FVC percent predicted was similar between treatment arms, and 6MWT distance was greater in the avalglucosidase alfa arm. From baseline to week 97, LS mean (SE) FVC percent predicted increased by 2.65 (1.05) for those who continued avalglucosidase alfa and 0.36 (1.12) for those who switched to avalglucosidase alfa. The LS mean (SE) 6MWT distance increased by 18.60 (12.01) m and 4.56 (12.44) m, respectively. For participants who switched to avalglucosidase alfa, FVC percent predicted remained stable (LS mean [SE] change from week 49 to 97, 0.09 [0.88]) and 6MWT distance improved (LS mean [SE] change from week 49 to 97, 5.33 [10.81] m). Potentially treatment-related adverse events were reported in 29 patients (56.9%) who continued avalglucosidase alfa and in 25 patients (56.8%) who switched.In this randomized clinical trial extension, maintenance of positive clinical outcomes was demonstrated for patients continuing avalglucosidase alfa treatment and, to a lesser extent, patients who switched from alglucosidase alfa. No new safety concerns were observed.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02782741.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1001/jamaneurol.2023.0552\n\nView details for PubMedID 37036722\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC10087094\n\nAbstract\n\nDysferlinopathy is a muscle disease characterized by a variable clinical presentation and is caused by mutations in the DYSF gene. The Jain Clinical Outcome Study for Dysferlinopathy (COS) followed the largest cohort of patients (n=187) with genetically confirmed dysferlinopathy throughout a three-year natural history study, in which the patients underwent muscle function tests and muscle magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We previously described the pattern of muscle pathology in this population and established a series of imaging criteria for diagnosis. In this paper, we describe the muscle imaging and clinical features of a subgroup of COS participants whose muscle imaging results did not completely meet the diagnostic criteria. We reviewed 184 T1-weighted (T1w) muscle MRI scans obtained at the baseline visit of the COS study, of which 106 were pelvic and lower limb only and 78 were whole-body scans. We identified 116 of the 184 patients (63%) who did not meet at least one of the established imaging criteria. The highest number found of unmet criteria was four per patient. We identified 24 patients (13%) who did not meet three or more of the nine established criteria and considered them as \"outliers\". The most common unmet criterion (27.3% of cases) was the adductor magnus being equally or more affected than the adductor longus. We compared the genetic, demographic, clinical and muscle function data of the outlier patients with those who met the established criteria and observed that the outlier patients had an age of disease onset that was significantly older than the whole group (29.3 vs 20.5 years, p=0.0001). This study expands the phenotypic muscle imaging spectrum of patients with dysferlinopathy and can help to guide the diagnostic process in patients with limb girdle weakness of unknown origin.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.nmd.2023.02.007\n\nView details for PubMedID 36972667\n\nAbstract\n\nMyotonic dystrophy type 1 results from an RNA gain-of-function mutation, in which DM1 protein kinase (DMPK) transcripts carrying expanded trinucleotide repeats exert deleterious effects. Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) provide a promising approach to treatment of myotonic dystrophy type 1 because they reduce toxic RNA levels. We aimed to investigate the safety of baliforsen (ISIS 598769), an ASO targeting DMPK mRNA.In this dose-escalation phase 1/2a trial, adults aged 20-55 years with myotonic dystrophy type 1 were enrolled at seven tertiary referral centres in the USA and randomly assigned via an interactive web or phone response system to subcutaneous injections of baliforsen 100 mg, 200 mg, or 300 mg, or placebo (6:2 randomisation at each dose level), or to baliforsen 400 mg or 600 mg, or placebo (10:2 randomisation at each dose level), on days 1, 3, 5, 8, 15, 22, 29, and 36. Sponsor personnel directly involved with the trial, participants, and all study personnel were masked to treatment assignments. The primary outcome measure was safety in all participants who received at least one dose of study drug up to day 134. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02312011), and is complete.Between Dec 12, 2014, and Feb 22, 2016, 49 participants were enrolled and randomly assigned to baliforsen 100 mg (n=7, one patient not dosed), 200 mg (n=6), 300 mg (n=6), 400 mg (n=10), 600 mg (n=10), or placebo (n=10). The safety population comprised 48 participants who received at least one dose of study drug. Treatment-emergent adverse events were reported for 36 (95%) of 38 participants assigned to baliforsen and nine (90%) of ten participants assigned to placebo. Aside from injection-site reactions, common treatment-emergent adverse events were headache (baliforsen: ten [26%] of 38 participants; placebo: four [40%] of ten participants), contusion (baliforsen: seven [18%] of 38; placebo: one [10%] of ten), and nausea (baliforsen: six [16%] of 38; placebo: two [20%] of ten). Most adverse events (baliforsen: 425 [86%] of 494; placebo: 62 [85%] of 73) were mild in severity. One participant (baliforsen 600 mg) developed transient thrombocytopenia considered potentially treatment related. Baliforsen concentrations in skeletal muscle increased with dose.Baliforsen was generally well tolerated. However, skeletal muscle drug concentrations were below levels predicted to achieve substantial target reduction. These results support the further investigation of ASOs as a therapeutic approach for myotonic dystrophy type 1, but suggest improved drug delivery to muscle is needed.Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Biogen.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/S1474-4422(23)00001-7\n\nView details for PubMedID 36804094\n\nAbstract\n\nThe Revised Hammersmith Scale (RHS) is a 36-item ordinal scale developed using clinical expertise and sound psychometrics to investigate motor function in participants with Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA). In this study, we investigate median change in the RHS score up to two years in paediatric SMA 2 and 3 participants and contextualise it to the Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale-Expanded (HFMSE). These change scores were considered by SMA type, motor function, and baseline RHS score. We consider a new transitional group, spanning crawlers, standers, and walkers-with-assistance, and analyse that alongside non-sitters, sitters, and walkers. The transitional group exhibit the most definitive change score trend, with an average 1-year decline of 3 points. In the weakest patients, we are most able to detect positive change in the RHS in the under-5 age group, whereas in the stronger patients, we are most able to detect decline in the RHS in the 8-13 age group. The RHS has a reduced floor effect compared to the HFMSE, although we show that the RHS should be used in conjunction with the RULM for participants scoring less than 20 points on the RHS. The timed items in the RHS have high between-participant variability, so participants with the same RHS total can be differentiated by their timed test items.\n\nView details for DOI 10.3390/jcm12051920\n\nView details for PubMedID 36902710\n\nAbstract\n\nRisdiplam is a survival of motor neuron 2 (SMN2) splicing modifier for the treatment of patients with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). The JEWELFISH study (NCT03032172) was designed to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of risdiplam in previously treated pediatric and adult patients with types 1-3 SMA. Here, an analysis was performed after all patients had received at least 1 year of treatment with risdiplam.Patients with a confirmed diagnosis of 5q-autosomal recessive SMA between the ages of 6 months and 60 years were eligible for enrollment. Patients were previously enrolled in the MOONFISH study (NCT02240355) with splicing modifier RG7800 or treated with olesoxime, nusinersen, or onasemnogene abeparvovec. The primary objectives of the JEWELFISH study were to evaluate the safety and tolerability of risdiplam and investigate the PK after 2 years of treatment.A total of 174 patients enrolled: MOONFISH study (n = 13), olesoxime (n = 71 patients), nusinersen (n = 76), onasemnogene abeparvovec (n = 14). Most patients (78%) had three SMN2 copies. The median age and weight of patients at enrollment was 14.0 years (1-60 years) and 39.1 kg (9.2-108.9 kg), respectively. About 63% of patients aged 2-60 years had a baseline total score of less than 10 on the Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale-Expanded and 83% had scoliosis. The most common adverse event (AE) was upper respiratory tract infection and pyrexia (30 patients each; 17%). Pneumonia (four patients; 2%) was the most frequently reported serious AE (SAE). The rates of AEs and SAEs per 100 patient-years were lower in the second 6-month period compared with the first. An increase in SMN protein was observed in blood after risdiplam treatment and was comparable across all ages and body weight quartiles.The safety and PD of risdiplam in patients who were previously treated were consistent with those of treatment-naïve patients.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1007/s40120-023-00444-1\n\nView details for PubMedID 36780114\n\nAbstract\n\nOBJECTIVE: Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) reduces health-related quality of life (QOL) in children. We have previously developed and validated the English and Italian versions of the pediatric CMT-specific QOL outcome measure (pCMT-QOL) for children aged 8-18. There is currently no parent-proxy CMT QOL outcome measure for use in clinical trials, which could provide complementary information in these children and adolescents. This study describes the validation studies conducted to develop the parent-proxy version of the pCMT-QOL outcome measure for children aged 8-18years old.METHODS: Development and validation of the parent-proxy version of the pCMT-QOL outcome measure for children aged 8-18years old was iterative, involving identifying relevant domains, item pool generation, prospective pilot testing and clinical assessments, structured focus-group interviews, and psychometric testing, conducted on parents of children with CMT seen at participating sites from the USA, United Kingdom, and Australia.RESULTS: We utilized previously described methods to develop a working parent-proxy version of the pCMT-QOL measure. From 2010-2016, the parent-proxy pCMT-QOL working version was administered to 358 parents of children with CMT aged 8-18, seen at the participating study sites of the Inherited Neuropathies Consortium. The resulting data underwent rigorous psychometric analysis, including factor analysis, test-retest reliability, internal consistency, convergent validity, IRT analysis, and longitudinal analysis, to develop the final parent-proxy version of the pCMT-QOL outcome measure for children aged 8-18years old.INTERPRETATION: The parent-proxy version of the pCMT-QOL outcome measure is a reliable, valid, and sensitive proxy measure of health-related QOL for children aged 8-18 with CMT.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1111/jns.12538\n\nView details for PubMedID 36748295\n\nAbstract\n\nNovel Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) treatments have demonstrated improvements on motor measures that are clearly distinct from the natural history of progressive decline. Comparable measures are needed to monitor bulbar function, which is affected in severe SMA.To assess bulbar function with patient-reported outcome measures (PROs) and determine their relationships with clinical characteristics.We recruited 47 non-ambulatory participants (mean (SD) age = 29.8 (13.7) years, range = 10.3-73.2) with SMA. PROs including Voice Handicap Index (VHI) and Eating Assessment Tool-10 (EAT-10) were collected alongside clinical characteristics and standardized motor assessments. Associations were assessed using Spearman correlation coefficients and group comparisons were performed using Wilcoxon rank sum tests.A majority of the 47 participants were SMA type 2 (70.2%), non-sitters (78.7%), 3 copies of SMN2 (77.5%), and using respiratory support (66.0%). A majority (94%) reported voice issues primarily in 8/30 VHI questions. Problems included: difficulty understanding me in a noisy room (87.2%); difficult for people to hear me (74.5%); and people ask me to repeat when speaking face-to-face (72.3%). A majority (85.1%) reported swallowing issues primarily in 3/10 EAT-10 questions: swallowing pills (68.1%); food sticks to my throat (66.0%); and swallowing solids (61.7%). The two PROs were moderately associated (rs = 0.66).Weaker individuals with SMA experience bulbar problems including difficulties with voice and swallowing. Further refinement and assessment of functional bulbar scales will help determine their relevance and responsiveness to changes in SMA. Additional study is needed to quantify bulbar changes caused by SMA and their response to disease-modifying treatments.\n\nView details for DOI 10.3233/JND-221573\n\nView details for PubMedID 36776075\n\nAbstract\n\nRisdiplam is an oral, survival of motor neuron2 (SMN2) pre-mRNA splicing modifier approved for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). SUNFISH (NCT02908685) Part 2, a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, investigated the efficacy and safety of risdiplam in type 2 and non‑ambulant type 3 SMA. The primary endpoint was met: a significantly greater change from baseline in 32-item Motor Function Measure (MFM32) total score was observed with risdiplam compared with placebo at month 12. After 12months, all participants received risdiplam while preserving initial treatment blinding. We report 24-month efficacy and safety results in this population. Month 24 exploratory endpoints included change from baseline in MFM32 and safety. MFM‑derived results were compared with an external comparator. At month 24 of risdiplam treatment, 32% of patients demonstrated improvement (a change of≥3) from baseline in MFM32 total score; 58% showed stabilization (a change of≥0). Compared with an external comparator, a treatment difference of 3.12 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.67-4.57) in favor of risdiplam was observed in MFM-derived scores. Overall, gains in motor function at month 12 were maintained or improved upon at month 24. In patients initially receiving placebo, MFM32 remained stable compared with baseline (0.31 [95% CI - 0.65 to 1.28]) after 12months of risdiplam; 16% of patients improved their score and 59% exhibited stabilization. The safety profile after 24months was consistent with that observed after 12months. Risdiplam over 24months resulted in further improvement or stabilization in motor function, confirming the benefit of longer-term treatment.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1007/s00415-023-11560-1\n\nView details for PubMedID 36735057\n\nAbstract\n\nSpinal muscular atrophy (5q-SMA; SMA), a genetic neuromuscular condition affecting spinal motor neurons, is caused by defects in both copies of the SMN1 gene that produces survival motor neuron (SMN) protein. The highly homologous SMN2 gene primarily expresses a rapidly degraded isoform of SMN protein that causes anterior horn cell degeneration, progressive motor neuron loss, skeletal muscle atrophy and weakness. Severe cases result in limited mobility and ventilatory insufficiency. Untreated SMA is the leading genetic cause of death in young children. Recently, three therapeutics that increase SMN protein levels in patients with SMA have provided incremental improvements in motor function and developmental milestones and prevented the worsening of SMA symptoms. While the therapeutic approaches with Spinraza®, Zolgensma®, and Evrysdi® have a clinically significant impact, they are not curative. For many patients, there remains a significant disease burden. A potential combination therapy under development for SMA targets myostatin, a negative regulator of muscle mass and strength. Myostatin inhibition in animal models increases muscle mass and function. Apitegromab is an investigational, fully human, monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to proforms of myostatin, promyostatin and latent myostatin, thereby inhibiting myostatin activation. A recently completed phase 2 trial demonstrated the potential clinical benefit of apitegromab by improving or stabilizing motor function in patients with Type 2 and Type 3 SMA and providing positive proof-of-concept for myostatin inhibition as a target for managing SMA. The primary goal of this manuscript is to orient physicians to the evolving landscape of SMA treatment.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1186/s12887-022-03671-x\n\nView details for PubMedID 36329412\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: Risdiplam is an orally administered therapy that modifies pre-mRNA splicing of the survival of motor neuron 2 (SMN2) gene and is approved for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy. The FIREFISH study is investigating the safety and efficacy of risdiplam in treated infants with type 1 spinal muscular atrophy versus historical controls. The primary endpoint of part 2 of the FIREFISH study showed that infants with type 1 spinal muscular atrophy attained the ability to sit without support for at least 5 s after 12 months of treatment. Here, we report on the safety and efficacy of risdiplam in FIREFISH part 2 over 24 months of treatment.METHODS: FIREFISH is an ongoing, multicentre, open-label, two-part study. In FIREFISH part 2, eligible infants (aged 1-7 months at enrolment, with a genetically confirmed diagnosis of spinal muscular atrophy, and two SMN2 gene copies) were enrolled in 14 hospitals in ten countries across Europe, North America, South America, and Asia. Risdiplam was orally administered once daily at 0·2 mg/kg for infants between 5 months and 2 years of age; once an infant reached 2 years of age, the dose was increased to 0·25 mg/kg. Infants younger than 5 months started at 0·04 mg/kg (infants between 1 month and 3 months old) or 0·08 mg/kg (infants between 3 months and 5 months old), and this starting dose was adjusted to 0·2 mg/kg once pharmacokinetic data were available for each infant. The primary and secondary endpoints included in the statistical hierarchy and assessed at month 12 have been reported previously. Here we present the remainder of the secondary efficacy endpoints that were included in the statistical hierarchy at month 24: the ability to sit without support for at least 30 s, to stand alone, and to walk alone, as assessed by the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, third edition gross motor subscale. These three endpoints were compared with a performance criterion of 5% that was defined based on the natural history of type 1 spinal muscular atrophy; the results were considered statistically significant if the lower limit of the two-sided 90% CI was above the 5% threshold. FIREFISH is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02913482. Recruitment is closed; the 36-month extension period of the study is ongoing.FINDINGS: Between March 13 and Nov 19, 2018, 41 infants were enrolled in FIREFISH part 2. After 24 months of treatment, 38 infants were ongoing in the study and 18 infants (44% [90% CI 31-58]) were able to sit without support for at least 30 s (p<0·0001 compared with the performance criterion derived from the natural history of untreated infants with type 1 spinal muscular atrophy). No infants could stand alone (0 [90% CI 0-7]) or walk alone (0 [0-7]) after 24 months of treatment. The most frequently reported adverse event was upper respiratory tract infection, in 22 infants (54%); the most common serious adverse events were pneumonia in 16 infants (39%) and respiratory distress in three infants (7%).INTERPRETATION: Treatment with risdiplam over 24 months resulted in continual improvements in motor function and achievement of developmental motor milestones. The FIREFISH open-label extension phase will provide additional evidence regarding long-term safety and efficacy of risdiplam.FUNDING: F Hoffmann-La Roche.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/S1474-4422(22)00339-8\n\nView details for PubMedID 36244364\n\nAbstract\n\nOBJECTIVE: The paucity of longitudinal natural history studies in MPZ-neuropathy remains a barrier to clinical trials. We have completed a longitudinal natural history study in patients with MPZ-neuropathies across 13 sites of the Inherited Neuropathy Consortium.METHODS: Change in Charcot Marie Tooth Examination scores (CMTES) and Rasch modified CMTES (CMTES-R) scores were evaluated using longitudinal regression over a 5-year period in subjects with MPZ-neuropathy. Data from 139 patients with MPZ-neuropathy were examined.RESULTS: The average baseline CMTES and CMTES-R scores were 10.84 (SD 6.0, range 0 - 28) and 14.60 (SD=7.56, range 0 - 32), respectively. A mixed regression model showed significant change in CMTES at years 2-5 [mean change from baseline of 0.87 points at 2years (p=0.008)]. Subgroup analysis revealed greater change in CMTES at 2years in subjects with axonal as compared to demyelinating neuropathy [mean change of 1.30 points, (p=0.016) versus 0.06 points, (p=0.889)]. Patients with a moderate baseline neuropathy severity also showed more notable change, by estimate, than those with mild or severe neuropathy [mean 2 year change of 1.14 for baseline CMTES 8-14 (p=0.025), versus -0.03 for baseline CMTES 0-7 (p=0.958) and 0.25 for baseline CMTES ≥15 (p=0.6897)]. The progression in patients harboring specific MPZ mutations was highly variable.INTERPRETATION: CMTES scores are sensitive to change over time in adult patients with axonal but not demyelinating forms of MPZ-neuropathy. Change in CMTES was greatest in patients with moderate baseline disease severity. These findings will inform future clinical trials of MPZ-neuropathies. This article is protected by copyright.

It has been suggested as a surrogate outcome measure for clinical trials. Here, we investigated the prognostic utility of T2H2O to identify changes in muscle function over time in limb girdle muscular dystrophies.Patients with genetically confirmed dysferlinopathy were assessed as part of the Jain Foundation Clinical Outcomes Study in dysferlinopathy. The cohort included 18 patients from two sites, both equipped with 3-tesla magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) systems from the same vendor. T2H2O value was defined as higher or lower than the median in each muscle bilaterally. The degree of deterioration on four functional tests over 3 years was assessed in a linear model against covariates of high or low T2H2O at baseline, age, disease duration, and baseline function.A higher T2H2O at baseline significantly correlated with a greater decline on functional tests in 21 out of 35 muscles and was never associated with slower decline. Higher baseline T2H2O in adductor magnus, vastus intermedius, vastus lateralis, and vastus medialis were the most sensitive, being associated bilaterally with greater decline in multiple timed tests. Patients with a higher than median baseline T2H2O (>40.6 ms) in the right vastus medialis deteriorated 11 points more on the North Star Ambulatory Assessment for Dysferlinopathy and lost an additional 86 m on the 6-min walk than those with a lower T2H2O (<40.6 ms). Optimum sensitivity and specificity thresholds for predicting decline were 39.0 ms in adductor magnus and vastus intermedius, 40.0 ms in vastus medialis, and 40.5 ms in vastus lateralis from different sites equipped with different MRI systems.In dysferlinopathy, T2H2O did not correlate with current functional ability. However, T2H2O at baseline was higher in patients who worsened more rapidly on functional tests. This suggests that inter-patient differences in functional decline over time may be, in part, explained by different severities of the active muscle damage, assessed by T2H2O measure at baseline. Significant challenges remain in standardizing T2H2O values across sites to allow determining globally applicable thresholds. The results from the present work are encouraging and suggest that T2H2O could be used to improve prognostication, patient selection, and disease modelling for clinical trials.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1002/jcsm.13063\n\nView details for PubMedID 36058852\n\nAbstract\n\nFEVAR is an established customized treatment for aortic aneurysms with three current commercially available configurations for the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) - a single-wide scallop, large fenestration, or small fenestration, with the scallop or large fenestration most utilized. Outcomes comparing SMA single-wide scallops to large fenestrations with the ZFEN device are scarce. As large fenestrations have the benefit of extending the proximal seal zone compared to scalloped configurations, we sought to determine the differences in seal zone and sac regression outcomes between the two SMA configurations.We retrospectively reviewed our prospectively maintained complex EVAR database and included all patients treated with the Cook ZFEN device with an SMA scallop or large fenestration configuration at its most proximal build. All first post-operative CT scans (1-30 days) were analyzed on TeraRecon to determine precise proximal seal zone lengths, and standard follow-up anatomic and clinical metrics were tabulated.A total of 234 consecutive ZFEN patients from 2012-2021 were reviewed, and 137 had either a scallop or large fenestration for the SMA as the proximal-most configuration (72 scallops and 65 large fenestrations) with imaging available for analysis. Mean follow-up was 35 months. Mean proximal seal zone length was 19.5±7.9 mm for scallop vs 41.7±14.4 mm for large fenestration groups (P<.001). There was no difference in sac regression between scallop and large fenestration at one year (10.1±10.9 mm vs 11.0±12.1, P = 0.63). Overall, 30-day mortality (1.3% vs 2.5%, P=.51) and all-cause three-year mortality (72.5% vs 81.7%, P=.77) were not significantly different. Reinterventions within 30 days were primarily secondary to renal artery branch occlusions, with only one patient in the scallop group requiring reintervention for an SMA branch occlusion.Despite attaining longer proximal seal lengths, large SMA fenestrations were not associated with a difference in sac regression compared to scalloped SMA configurations at one-year follow up. There were no significant differences in reinterventions or overall long-term survival between the two SMA strategies.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.avsg.2022.07.013\n\nView details for PubMedID 36058451\n\nAbstract\n\nThe myotonic dystrophies (DM1 and DM2) are dominantly inherited disorders that cause pathological changes throughout the body. Many individuals with DM experience cognitive, behavioral and other functional central nervous system effects that impact their quality of life. The extent of psychological impairment that will develop in each patient is variable and unpredictable. Hence, it is difficult to get strong supervision information like fully ground truth labels for all cognitive involvement patterns. This study is to assess cognitive involvement among healthy controls and patients with DM. The DM cognitive impairment pattern observation is modeled in a weakly supervised setting and supervision information is used to transform the input feature space to a more discriminative representation suitable for pattern observation. This study incorporated results from 59 adults with DM and 92 control subjects. The developed system categorized the neuropsychological testing data into five cognitive clusters. The quality of the obtained clustering solution was assessed using an internal validity metric. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can discover interesting patterns and useful information from neuropsychological data, which will be be crucial in planning clinical trials and monitoring clinical performance. The proposed system resulted in an average classification accuracy of 88%, which is very promising considering the unique challenges present in this population.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1109/EMBC48229.2022.9871626\n\nView details for PubMedID 36086274\n\nAbstract\n\nOBJECTIVE: The long-term favorable safety profile of nusinersen provides an opportunity to consider a higher dose. We report on the relationships between nusinersen cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) exposure, biomarker levels, and clinical efficacy.METHODS: The analyses used data from the CS3A and ENDEAR studies of nusinersen in participants with infantile-onset spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). Steady-state CSF trough (Ctrough ) levels, plasma phosphorylated neurofilament heavy chain (pNF-H) levels, body weight, and Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Infant Test of Neuromuscular Disorders (CHOP INTEND) scores were selected as parameters of interest. A validated population pharmacokinetic (PK) model was applied to predict the nusinersen CSF Ctrough . PK/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) models used nusinersen CSF Ctrough measurements, which were time-matched with CHOP INTEND scores.RESULTS: Higher nusinersen CSF exposure was associated with a greater decrease in pNF-H levels and greater efficacy, as measured by change in the CHOP INTEND score from baseline. These findings indicate a dose-response relationship between CSF nusinersen levels and treatment response. The higher dose is predicted to lead to approximately a 2.4-fold increase in nusinersen CSF levels with fewer loading doses. PK/PD modeling indicates that a higher concentration of nusinersen may predict an additional 5-point increase in CHOP INTEND score beyond that observed with 12mg.INTERPRETATION: Our data indicate that a higher dose of nusinersen may lead to additional clinically meaningful improvement in efficacy when compared with the currently approved 12-mg dose. The efficacy, safety, and PK of a higher nusinersen dose are currently under investigation in the ongoing phase 2/3 DEVOTE study (NCT04089566).\n\nView details for DOI 10.1002/acn3.51562\n\nView details for PubMedID 35567345\n\nAbstract\n\nINTRODUCTION/AIMS: There is debate about whether and to what extent either respiratory or cardiac dysfunction occur in patients with dysferlinopathy. This study aimed to establish definitively whether dysfunction in either system is part of the dysferlinopathy phenotype.METHODS: As part of the Jain Foundation's International Clinical Outcome Study (COS) for dysferlinopathy, objective measures of respiratory and cardiac function were collected twice, with a three-year interval between tests, in 188 genetically confirmed patients aged 11-86years (53% female). Measures included forced vital capacity (FVC), electrocardiogram (ECG) and echocardiogram (echo).RESULTS: Mean FVC was 90% predicted at baseline, decreasing to 88% at year three. FVC was less than 80% predicted in 44 patients (24%) at baseline and 48 patients (30%) by year three, including ambulant participants. ECGs showed P-wave abnormalities indicative of delayed trans-atrial conduction in 58% of patients at baseline, representing a risk for developing atrial flutter or fibrillation. The prevalence of impaired left ventricular function or hypertrophy was comparable to that in the general population.DISCUSSION: These results demonstrate clinically significant respiratory impairment and abnormal atrial conduction in some patients with dysferlinopathy. Therefore, we recommend that annual or biannual follow-up should include FVC measurement, enquiry about arrhythmia symptoms and peripheral pulse palpation to assess cardiac rhythm. However, periodic specialist cardiac review is probably not warranted unless prompted by symptoms or abnormal pulse findings.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1002/mus.27524\n\nView details for PubMedID 35179231\n\nAbstract\n\nMyotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is known to affect cognitive function, but the best methods to assess CNS involvement in multicenter studies have not been determined. This study's primary aim was to evaluate the potential of computerized cognitive tests to assess cognition in DM1.We conducted a prospective, longitudinal, observational study of 113 adults with DM1 at 6 sites. Psychomotor speed, attention, working memory, and executive functioning were assessed at baseline, 3-months and 12-months using computerized cognitive tests. Results were compared with assessments of muscle function and patient reported outcomes (PROs), including the Myotonic Dystrophy Health Index (MDHI) and EQ-5D-5L.Based on intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs), computerized cognitive tests had moderate to good reliability for psychomotor speed (0.76), attention (0.82), working memory speed (0.79), working memory accuracy (0.65), and executive functioning (0.87). Performance at baseline was lowest for working memory accuracy (p < 0.0001). Executive function performance improved from baseline to 3-months (p < 0.0001), without further changes over one year. There was a moderate correlation between poorer executive function and larger CTG repeat size (r = -0.433). There were some weak associations between PROs and cognitive performance.Computerized tests of cognition are feasible in multicenter studies of DM1. Poor performance was exhibited in working memory, which may be a useful variable in clinical trials. Learning effects may have contributed to the improvement in executive functioning. The relationship between PROs and cognitive impairment in DM1 requires further study. This article is protected by copyright.

The drug modifies pre-mRNA splicing of the SMN2 gene to increase production of functional SMN. We aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of risdiplam in patients with type 2 or non-ambulant type 3 spinal muscular atrophy.METHODS: In this phase 3, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, patients aged 2-25 years with confirmed 5q autosomal recessive type 2 or type 3 spinal muscular atrophy were recruited from 42 hospitals in 14 countries across Europe, North America, South America, and Asia. Participants were eligible if they were non-ambulant, could sit independently, and had a score of at least 2 in entry item A of the Revised Upper Limb Module. Patients were stratified by age and randomly assigned (2:1) to receive either daily oral risdiplam, at a dose of 5·00 mg (for individuals weighing ≥20 kg) or 0·25 mg/kg (for individuals weighing <20 kg), or daily oral placebo (matched to risdiplam in colour and taste). Randomisation was conducted by permutated block randomisation with a computerised system run by an external party. Patients, investigators, and all individuals in direct contact with patients were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in the 32-item Motor Function Measure total score at month 12. All individuals who were randomly assigned to risdiplam or placebo, and who did not meet the prespecified missing item criteria for exclusion, were included in the primary efficacy analysis. Individuals who received at least one dose of risdiplam or placebo were included in the safety analysis. SUNFISH is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02908685. Recruitment is closed; the study is ongoing.FINDINGS: Between Oct 9, 2017, and Sept 4, 2018, 180 patients were randomly assigned to receive risdiplam (n=120) or placebo (n=60). For analysis of the primary endpoint, 115 patients from the risdiplam group and 59 patients from the placebo group were included. At month 12, the least squares mean change from baseline in 32-item Motor Function Measure was 1·36 (95% CI 0·61 to 2·11) in the risdiplam group and -0·19 (-1·22 to 0·84) in the placebo group, with a treatment difference of 1·55 (0·30 to 2·81, p=0·016) in favour of risdiplam. 120 patients who received risdiplam and 60 who received placebo were included in safety analyses. Adverse events that were reported in at least 5% more patients who received risdiplam than those who received placebo were pyrexia (25 [21%] of 120 patients who received risdiplam vs ten [17%] of 60 patients who received placebo), diarrhoea (20 [17%] vs five [8%]), rash (20 [17%] vs one [2%]), mouth and aphthous ulcers (eight [7%] vs 0), urinary tract infection (eight [7%] vs 0), and arthralgias (six [5%] vs 0). The incidence of serious adverse events was similar between treatment groups (24 [20%] of 120 patients in the risdiplam group; 11 [18%] of 60 patients in the placebo group), with the exception of pneumonia (nine [8%] in the risdiplam group; one [2%] in the placebo group).INTERPRETATION: Risdiplam resulted in a significant improvement in motor function compared with placebo in patients aged 2-25 years with type 2 or non-ambulant type 3 spinal muscular atrophy. Our exploratory subgroup analyses showed that motor function was generally improved in younger individuals and stabilised in older individuals, which requires confirmation in further studies. SUNFISH part 2 is ongoing and will provide additional evidence regarding the long-term safety and efficacy of risdiplam.FUNDING: F Hoffmann-La Roche.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/S1474-4422(21)00367-7\n\nView details for PubMedID 34942136\n\nAbstract\n\nDysferlinopathy is a muscular dystrophy with a highly variable functional disease progression in which the relationship of function to some patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) has not been previously reported. This analysis aims to identify the suitability of PROMs and their association with motor performance.Two-hundred and four patients with dysferlinopathy were identified in the Jain Foundation's Clinical Outcome Study in Dysferlinopathy from 14 sites in 8 countries. All patients completed the following PROMs: Individualized Neuromuscular Quality of Life Questionnaire (INQoL), International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ), and activity limitations for patients with upper and/or lower limb impairments (ACTIVLIMs). In addition, nonambulant patients completed the Egen Klassifikation Scale (EK). Assessments were conducted annually at baseline, years 1, 2, 3, and 4. Data were also collected on the North Star Assessment for Limb Girdle Type Muscular Dystrophies (NSAD) and Performance of Upper Limb (PUL) at these time points from year 2. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and Rasch analysis was conducted on ACTIVLIM, EK, INQoL. For associations, graphs (NSAD with ACTIVLIM, IPAQ and INQoL and EK with PUL) were generated from generalized estimating equations (GEE). The ACTIVLIM appeared robust psychometrically and was strongly associated with the NSAD total score (Pseudo R 2 0.68). The INQoL performed less well and was poorly associated with the NSAD total score (Pseudo R 2 0.18). EK scores were strongly associated with PUL (Pseudo R 2 0.69). IPAQ was poorly associated with NSAD scores (Pseudo R 2 0.09). This study showed that several of the chosen PROMs demonstrated change over time and a good association with functional outcomes. An alternative quality of life measure and method of collecting data on physical activity may need to be selected for assessing dysferlinopathy.\n\nView details for DOI 10.3389/fneur.2022.828525\n\nView details for PubMedID 35359643\n\nAbstract\n\nThe aim of the study was to establish 24-month changes in a large cohort of type II and III spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) patients assessed with the Revised Upper Limb Module (RULM), a tool specifically developed to assess upper limb function in SMA. We included 107 patients (54 type II and 53 type III) with at least 24-months follow up. The overall RULM 24-month changes showed a mean decline of -0.79 points. The difference between baseline and 24 months was significant in type II but not in type III patients. There was also a difference among functional subgroups but not in relation to age. Most patients had 24-month mean changes within 2 points, with 23% decreasing more than 2 points and 7% improving by >2 points. Our results suggest an overall progressive decline in upper limb function over 24 months. The negative changes were most notable in type II, in non-ambulant type III and with a different pattern of progression, also in non-sitter type II. In contrast, ambulant type III showed relative stability within the 24-month follow up. These findings will help in the interpretation of the real world data collected following the availability of new therapeutic approaches.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.nmd.2021.10.009\n\nView details for PubMedID 34980538\n\nAbstract\n\nRef: Different trajectories in upper limb and gross motor function in spinal muscular atrophy INTRODUCTION: The Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded (HFMSE) and the Revised Upper Limb Module (RULM) have been widely used in natural history studies and clinical trials. Our aim was to establish how the scales relate to each other at different age points in spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) type 2 and 3, and to describe their coherence over 12 months.METHODS: The study was performed by cross-sectional and longitudinal reanalysis of previously published natural history data. The longitudinal analysis of the 12-month changes also included the analysis of concordance between scales with changes grouped as stable (+2 points), improved (>+2) or declined (>-2).RESULTS: Three hundred sixty-four patients were included in the cross-sectional analysis, showing different trends in score and point of slope change for the two scales. For type 2 the point of slope change was 4.1years for the HFMSE and 5.8 for the RULM, while for type 3 it was 6years for the HFMSE and 7.3 for the RULM. One-hundred-twenty-one patients had at least 2 assessments at 12-month. Full concordance was found in 57.3% of the assessments, and in 40.4% one scale remained stable and the other changed. Each scale appeared to be more sensitive to specific age or functional subgroups.DISCUSSION: The two scales, when used in combination, may increase the sensitivity to detect clinically meaningful changes in motor function in patients with SMA types 2 and 3.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1002/mus.27384\n\nView details for PubMedID 34327716\n\nAbstract\n\nOBJECTIVE: We report longitudinal data from 144 type III SMA pediatric and adult patients treated with nusinersen as part of an international effort.METHODS: Patients were assessed using Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded (HFMSE), Revised Upper Limb Module (RULM), and 6-Minute Walk Test (6MWT) with a mean follow-up of 1.83years after nusinersen treatment.RESULTS: Over 75% of the 144 patients had a 12-month follow-up. There was an increase in the mean scores from baseline to 12months on both HFMSE (1.18 points, p=0.004) and RULM scores (0.58 points, p=0.014) but not on the 6MWT (mean difference=6.65m, p=0.33). When the 12-month HFMSE changes in the treated cohort were compared to an external cohort of untreated patients, in all untreated patients older than 7years, the mean changes were always negative, while always positive in the treated ones. To reduce a selection bias, we also used a multivariable analysis. On the HFMSE scale, age, gender, baseline value, and functional status contributed significantly to the changes, while the number of SMN2 copies did not contribute. The effect of these variables was less obvious on the RULM and 6MWT.INTERPRETATION: Our results expand the available data on the effect of Nusinersen on type III patients, so far mostly limited to data from adult type III patients.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1002/acn3.51411\n\nView details for PubMedID 34165911\n\nAbstract\n\nSpinal muscular atrophy is a progressive, recessively inherited monogenic neurologic disease, the genetic root cause of which is the absence of a functional survival motor neuron 1 gene. Onasemnogene abeparvovec (formerly AVXS-101) is an adeno-associated virus serotype 9 vector-based gene therapy that delivers a fully functional copy of the human survival motor neuron gene. We report anti-adeno-associated virus serotype 9 antibody titers for patients with spinal muscular atrophy when they were screened for eligibility in the onasemnogene abeparvovec clinical trials (intravenous and intrathecal administration) and managed access programs (intravenous). Through December 31, 2019, 196 patients and 155 biologic mothers were screened for anti-adeno-associated virus serotype 9 binding antibodies with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Of these, 15 patients (7.7%) and 23 biologic mothers (14.8%) had titers >1:50 on their initial screening tests. Eleven patients (5.6%) had elevated titers on their final screening tests. The low percentage of patients with exclusionary antibody titers indicates that most infants with spinal muscular atrophy type 1 should be able to receive onasemnogene abeparvovec. Retesting may identify patients whose antibody titers later decrease to below the threshold for treatment, and retesting should be considered for patients with anti-adeno-associated virus serotype 9 antibody titers >1:50.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.omtm.2021.02.014\n\nView details for PubMedID 33768131\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: Nusinersen showed a favourable benefit-risk profile in participants with infantile-onset spinal muscular atrophy at the interim analysis of a phase 2 clinical study. We present the study's final analysis, assessing the efficacy and safety of nusinersen over 3 years.METHODS: This phase 2, open-label, multicentre, dose-escalation study was done in three university hospital sites in the USA and one in Canada. Infants aged between 3 weeks and 6 months with two or three SMN2 gene copies and infantile-onset spinal muscular atrophy were eligible for inclusion. Eligible participants received multiple intrathecal loading doses of 6 mg equivalent nusinersen (cohort 1) or 12 mg dose equivalent (cohort 2), followed by maintenance doses of 12 mg equivalent nusinersen. The protocol amendment on Jan 25, 2016, changed the primary efficacy endpoint from safety and tolerability to reaching motor milestones, assessed using the Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination section 2 (HINE-2) at the last study visit, in all participants who successfully completed the loading dose period and day 92 assessment. The statistical analysis plan was amended on Feb 10, 2016, to include additional analyses of the subgroup of participants with two SMN2 copies. Adverse events were assessed in all participants who received at least one dose of study treatment. The study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01839656).FINDINGS: Between May 3, 2013, and July 9, 2014, 20 symptomatic participants with infantile-onset spinal muscular atrophy (12 boys and 8 girls; median age at diagnosis 78 days [range 0-154]) were enrolled. Median time on study was 36·2 months (IQR 20·6-41·3). The primary endpoint of an incremental improvement in HINE-2 developmental motor milestones was reached by 12 (63%) of 19 evaluable participants. In the 13 participants with two SMN2 copies treated with 12 mg nusinersen, the HINE-2 motor milestone total score increased steadily from a baseline mean of 1·46 (SD 0·52) to 11·86 (6·18) at day 1135, representing a clinically significant change of 10·43 (6·05). At study closure (Aug 21, 2017), 15 (75%) of 20 participants were alive. 101 serious adverse events were reported in 16 (80%) of 20 participants; all five deaths (one in cohort 1 and four in cohort 2) were likely to be related to spinal muscular atrophy disease progression.INTERPRETATION: Our findings are consistent with other trials of nusinersen and show improved survival and attainment of motor milestones over 3 years in patients with infantile-onset spinal muscular atrophy, with a favourable safety profile.FUNDING: Biogen and Ionis Pharmaceuticals.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/S2352-4642(21)00100-0\n\nView details for PubMedID 34089650\n\nAbstract\n\nObjective: To determine changes in motor and respiratory function after treatment with nusinersen in adults with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) during the first two years of commercial availability in the USA.Methods: Data were collected prospectively on adult (age >17 years at treatment initiation) SMA participants in the Pediatric Neuromuscular Clinical Research (PNCR) Network. Baseline assessments of SMA outcomes including the Expanded Hammersmith Functional Rating Scale (HFMSE), Revised Upper Limb Module (RULM), and 6-Minute Walk Test (6MWT) occurred <5 months before treatment, and post-treatment assessments were made up to 24 months after nusinersen initation. Patient-reported experiences, safety laboratory tests and adverse events were monitored. The mean annual rate of change over time was determined for outcome measures using linear mixed effects models.Results: Forty-two adult SMA participants (mean age: 34 years, range 17-66) receiving nusinersen for a mean of 12.5 months (range 3-24 months) were assessed. Several motor and respiratory measures showed improvement distinct from the progressive decline typically seen in untreated adults. Participants also reported qualitative improvements including muscle strength, stamina, breathing and bulbar related outcomes. All participants tolerated nusinersen with normal surveillance labs and no significant adverse events.Conclusions: Trends of improvement emerged in functional motor, patient-reported, and respiratory measures, suggesting nusinersen may be efficacious in adults with SMA. Larger well-controlled studies and additional outcome measures are needed to firmly establish the efficacy of nusinersen in adults with SMA.Classification of Evidence: This study provides Class IV evidence regarding nusinersen tolerability and efficacy based on reported side effects and pulmonary and physical therapy assessments in an adult SMA cohort.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1212/CPJ.0000000000001033\n\nView details for PubMedID 34476123\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: Spinal muscular atrophy type 1 is a motor neuron disorder resulting in death or the need for permanent ventilation by age 2 years. We aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of onasemnogene abeparvovec (previously known as AVXS-101), a gene therapy delivering the survival motor neuron gene (SMN), in symptomatic patients (identified through clinical examination) with infantile-onset spinal muscular atrophy.METHODS: STR1VE was an open-label, single-arm, single-dose, phase 3 trial done at 12 hospitals and universities in the USA. Eligible patients had to be younger than 6 months and have spinal muscular atrophy with biallelic SMN1 mutations (deletion or point mutations) and one or two copies of SMN2. Patients received a one-time intravenous infusion of onasemnogene abeparvovec (1·1 * 1014 vector genomes per kg) for 30-60 min. During the outpatient follow-up, patients were assessed once per week, beginning at day 7 post-infusion for 4 weeks and then once per month until the end of the study (age 18 months or early termination). Coprimary efficacy outcomes were independent sitting for 30 s or longer (Bayley-III item 26) at the 18 month of age study visit and survival (absence of death or permanent ventilation) at age 14 months. Safety was assessed through evaluation of adverse events, concomitant medication usage, physical examinations, vital sign assessments, cardiac assessments, and laboratory evaluation. Primary efficacy endpoints for the intention-to-treat population were compared with untreated infants aged 6 months or younger (n=23) with spinal muscular atrophy type 1 (biallelic deletion of SMN1 and two copies of SMN2) from the Pediatric Neuromuscular Clinical Research (PNCR) dataset. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03306277 (completed).FINDINGS: From Oct 24, 2017, to Nov 12, 2019, 22 patients with spinal muscular atrophy type 1 were eligible and received onasemnogene abeparvovec. 13 (59%, 97·5% CI 36-100) of 22 patients achieved functional independent sitting for 30 s or longer at the 18 month of age study visit (vs 0 of 23 patients in the untreated PNCR cohort; p<0·0001). 20 patients (91%, 79-100]) survived free from permanent ventilation at age 14 months (vs 6 [26%], 8-44; p<0·0001 in the untreated PNCR cohort). All patients who received onasemnogene abeparvovec had at least one adverse event (most common was pyrexia). The most frequently reported serious adverse events were bronchiolitis, pneumonia, respiratory distress, and respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis. Three serious adverse events were related or possibly related to the treatment (two patients had elevated hepatic aminotransferases, and one had hydrocephalus).INTERPRETATION: Results from this multicentre trial build on findings from the phase 1 START study by showing safety and efficacy of commercial grade onasemnogene abeparvovec. Onasemnogene abeparvovec showed statistical superiority and clinically meaningful responses when compared with observations from the PNCR natural history cohort. The favourable benefit-risk profile shown in this study supports the use of onasemnogene abeparvovec for treatment of symptomatic patients with genetic or clinical characteristics predictive of infantile-onset spinal muscular atrophy type 1.FUNDING: Novartis Gene Therapies.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/S1474-4422(21)00001-6\n\nView details for PubMedID 33743238\n\nAbstract\n\nThis study aims to determine clinically relevant phenotypic differences between the two most common phenotypic classifications in dysferlinopathy, limb girdle muscular dystrophy R2 (LGMDR2) and Miyoshi myopathy (MMD1). LGMDR2 and MMD1 are reported to involve different muscles, with LGMDR2 showing predominant limb girdle weakness and MMD1 showing predominant distal lower limb weakness. We used heatmaps, regression analysis and principle component analysis of functional and Magnetic Resonance Imaging data to perform a cross-sectional review of the pattern of muscle involvement in 168 patients from the Jain Foundation's international Clinical Outcomes Study for Dysferlinopathy. We demonstrated that there is no clinically relevant difference in proximal vs distal involvement between diagnosis. There is a continuum of distal involvement at any given degree of proximal involvement and patients do not fall into discrete distally or proximally affected groups. There appeared to be geographical preference for a particular diagnosis, with MMD1 being more common in Japan and LGMDR2 in Europe and the USA. We conclude that the dysferlinopathies do not form two distinct phenotypic groups and therefore should not be split into separate cohorts of LGMDR2 and MM for the purposes of clinical management, enrolment in clinical trials or access to subsequent treatments.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.nmd.2021.01.009\n\nView details for PubMedID 33610434\n\nAbstract\n\nMitofusin-2 (MFN2) is one of two ubiquitously expressed homologous proteins in eukaryote cells, playing a critical role in mitochondrial fusion. Mutations in MFN2 (most commonly autosomal dominant) cause Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2A (CMT2A), the commonest axonal form of CMT, with significant allelic heterogeneity. Previous, moderately-sized, cross sectional genotype-phenotype studies of CMT2A have described the phenotypic spectrum of the disease, but longitudinal natural history studies are lacking. In this large multicentre prospective cohort study of 196 patients with dominant and autosomal recessive CMT2A, we present an in-depth genotype-phenotype study of the baseline characteristics of patients with CMT2A and longitudinal data (1-2 years) to describe the natural history. A childhood onset of autosomal dominant CMT2A is the most predictive marker of significant disease severity and is independent of the disease duration. When compared to adult onset autosomal dominant CMT2A, it is associated with significantly higher rates of use of ankle-foot orthoses, full-time use of wheelchair, dexterity difficulties and also has significantly higher CMT Examination Score (CMTESv2) and CMT Neuropathy Score (CMTNSv2) at initial assessment. Analysis of longitudinal data using the CMTESv2 and its Rasch-weighted counterpart, CMTESv2-R, show that over 1 year, the CMTESv2 increases significantly in autosomal dominant CMT2A (mean change 0.84±2.42; two-tailed paired t-test P=0.039). Furthermore, over 2 years both the CMTESv2 (mean change 0.97±1.77; two-tailed paired t-test P=0.003) and the CMTESv2-R (mean change 1.21±2.52; two-tailed paired t-test P=0.009) increase significantly with respective standardized response means of 0.55 and 0.48. In the paediatric CMT2A population (autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive CMT2A grouped together), the CMT Pediatric Scale increases significantly both over 1 year (mean change 2.24±3.09; two-tailed paired t-test P=0.009) and over 2 years (mean change 4.00±3.79; two-tailed paired t-test P=0.031) with respective standardized response means of 0.72 and 1.06. This cross-sectional and longitudinal study of the largest CMT2A cohort reported to date provides guidance for variant interpretation, informs prognosis and also provides natural history data that will guide clinical trial design.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1093/brain/awaa323\n\nView details for PubMedID 33415332\n\nAbstract\n\nPompe disease is a rare, progressive neuromuscular disorder caused by deficiency of acid α-glucosidase (GAA) and accumulation of lysosomal glycogen. We assessed the safety and efficacy of avalglucosidase alfa, a recombinant human GAA enzyme replacement therapy specifically designed for enhanced mannose-6-phosphate-receptor targeting and enzyme uptake aimed at increased glycogen clearance, compared with the current approved standard of care, alglucosidase alfa, in patients with late-onset Pompe disease.We did a randomised, double-blind, phase 3 trial at 55 sites in 20 countries. We enrolled individuals (aged ≥3 years) with enzymatically confirmed late-onset Pompe disease who had never received treatment. We used a centralised treatment allocation system to randomly allocate participants to either avalglucosidase alfa or alglucosidase alfa. Participants and investigators were unaware of their treatment allocation. The primary outcome measure was change from baseline to week 49 in upright forced vital capacity percent (FVC%) predicted. We used a hierarchical fixed sequential testing strategy, whereby non-inferiority of avalglucosidase alfa compared with alglucosidase alfa was assessed first, with a non-inferiority margin of 1·1. If non-inferiority was seen, then superiority was tested with a 5% significance level. The key secondary objective was effect on functional endurance, measured by the 6-minute walk test (6MWT). Safety was assessed, including treatment-emergent adverse events and infusion-associated reactions. The modified intent-to-treat population was the primary analysis population for all efficacy analyses. The safety population was the analysis population for safety analyses. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02782741. We report results of the 49-week primary analysis period.Between Nov 2, 2016, and March 29, 2019, 100 participants were randomly allocated avalglucosidase alfa (n=51) or alglucosidase alfa (n=49). Treatment with avalglucosidase alfa resulted in a least-squares mean improvement in upright FVC% predicted of 2·89% (SE 0·88) compared with 0·46% (0·93) with alglucosidase alfa at week 49 (difference 2·43% [95% CI -0·13 to 4·99]). Non-inferiority was shown because the lower bound of the 95% CI for the difference far exceeded the predefined non-inferiority margin but did not exclude 0 (p=0·0074). Superiority was not reached (p=0·063), so formal testing was stopped, as per the testing hierarchy. Improvements were also seen in the 6MWT with avalglucosidase alfa compared with alglucosidase alfa, with greater increases in distance covered (difference 30·01 m [95% CI 1·33 to 58·69]) and percent predicted (4·71% [0·25 to 9·17]). Treatment-emergent adverse events potentially related to treatment were reported in 23 (45%) of 51 participants in the avalglucosidase alfa group and in 24 (49%) of 49 in the alglucosidase alfa group, and infusion-associated reactions were reported in 13 (26%) participants in the avalglucosidase alfa group and 16 (33%) in the alglucosidase alfa group. Of the five trial withdrawals, all in the alglucosidase alfa group, four were due to adverse events, including two infusion-associated reactions. Serious treatment-emergent adverse events were reported in eight (16%) participants who received avalglucosidase alfa and in 12 (25%) who received alglucosidase alfa. One participant treated with alglucosidase alfa died because of acute myocardial infarction determined to be unrelated to treatment. Antidrug antibody responses were similar in both groups. High and persistent titres (≥12 800) and neutralising antibodies were more common with alglucosidase alfa (in 16 [33%] participants) than with avalglucosidase alfa (ten [20%]).We consider that this study provides evidence of clinically meaningful improvement with avalglucosidase alfa therapy over alglucosidase alfa in respiratory function, ambulation, and functional endurance, with no new safety signals reported. An open-label extended-treatment period is ongoing to confirm the long-term safety and efficacy of avalglucosidase alfa, with the aim for this therapy to become the new standard treatment in late-onset Pompe disease.Sanofi Genzyme.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/S1474-4422(21)00241-6\n\nView details for PubMedID 34800399\n\nAbstract\n\nPrevious natural history studies suggest that type II SMA patients remain stable over one year but show some progression over two years. Since nusinersen approval, there has been increasing attention to identify more specific age-related changes. The aim of the study was to establish 12-month changes in a cohort of pediatric type II SMA treated with nusinersen and to establish possible patterns of treatment effect in relation to different variables such as age, baseline value and SMN2 copy number. The Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded and the Revised Upper Limb Module were performed at T0 and 12 months after treatment (T12). Data in treated patients were compared to available data in untreated patients collected by the same evaluators.Seventy-seven patients of age between 2.64 and 17.88 years (mean:7.47, SD:3.79) were included. On t-test there was an improvement, with increased mean scores between T0 and T12 on both scales (p < 0.001). Using multivariate linear regression analysis, age and baseline scores were predictive of changes on both scales (p < 0.05) while SMN2 copy number was not. Differences were also found between study cohort and untreated data on both scales (p < 0.001). At 12 months, an increase in scores was observed in all the age subgroups at variance with natural history data. Our real-world data confirm the treatment effect of nusinersen in pediatric type II SMA patients and that the data interpretation should take into account different variables. These data confirm and expand the ones already reported in the Cherish study.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.nmd.2021.03.012\n\nView details for PubMedID 34099377\n\nAbstract\n\nThis phase 2, double-blind, placebo-controlled, hypothesis-generating study evaluated the effects of oral reldesemtiv, a fast skeletal muscle troponin activator, in patients with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). Patients ≥ 12 years of age with type II, III, or IV SMA were randomized into 2 sequential, ascending reldesemtiv dosing cohorts (cohort 1: 150 mg bid or placebo [2:1]; cohort 2: 450 mg bid or placebo [2:1]). The primary objective was to determine potential pharmacodynamic effects of reldesemtiv on 8 outcome measures in SMA, including 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) and maximum expiratory pressure (MEP). Changes from baseline to weeks 4 and 8 were determined. Pharmacokinetics and safety were also evaluated. Patients were randomized to reldesemtiv 150 mg, 450 mg, or placebo (24, 20, and 26, respectively). The change from baseline in 6MWD was greater for reldesemtiv 450 mg than for placebo at weeks 4 and 8 (least squares [LS] mean difference, 35.6 m [p = 0.0037] and 24.9 m [p = 0.058], respectively). Changes from baseline in MEP at week 8 on reldesemtiv 150 and 450 mg were significantly greater than those on placebo (LS mean differences, 11.7 [p = 0.038] and 13.2 cm H2O [p = 0.03], respectively). For 6MWD and MEP, significant changes from placebo were seen in the highest reldesemtiv peak plasma concentration quartile (Cmax > 3.29 μg/mL; LS mean differences, 43.3"
