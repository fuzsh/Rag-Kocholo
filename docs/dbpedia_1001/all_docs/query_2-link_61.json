        "text": "LAW 1802 v00 A Due Process Hearing Simulation: Protecting The Rights of a Student With a Disability\n\nJ.D. Seminar | 2 credit hours\n\nThis interactive skills-based course will put students in the roles of counsel and witness in a simulated due process hearing under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (“IDEA”). Due process hearings are similar to bench trials, with opening statements, direct and cross-examination of witnesses and closing arguments, however, they are conducted in front of a hearing officer. The due process hearing in this course involves claims that a public school district has violated the IDEA by: (i) failing to appropriately evaluate and identify a third grade student with a disability; and (ii) failing to provide a “free and appropriate public education” to the student.\n\nThrough reading assignments and classroom discussion, the students will become familiar with key provisions of the IDEA, and ethical considerations arising in IDEA proceedings. They will also become familiar with the materials in the Due Process Hearing Packet provided by the instructor and containing everything the students need to create their hearing strategy and conduct the hearing. The students will be assigned to teams and tasked with collaboratively creating a hearing strategy to present their client’s case, and then individually preparing and presenting certain pieces of the case (e.g., opening statement, closing argument, direct and cross-examination of witnesses). The students will not prepare pleadings or any of the written submissions normally involved in due process proceedings.\n\nThe hearing will be conducted in phases, to allow for constructive peer and instructor feedback and self-reflection (through discussion and journal entries) after each phase, as follows: Phase 1 Opening statements; Phase 2 Complainant’s case in chief/Respondent’s cross and objections; Phase 3 Respondent’s case in chief/Complainant’s cross and objections; Phase 4 Closing Arguments. At the conclusion of the hearing, the students will discuss the merits of each party’s case, lessons learned, and whether their perspective on ethical considerations raised at the beginning of the course has changed, now that they have “stood in the shoes” of counsel litigating the educational rights of a child with a disability.\n\nPrerequisite: J.D. students must complete the required first-year program prior to enrolling in this course (part-time and interdivisional transfer students may enroll prior to completing Criminal Procedure, Property, or their first-year elective).\n\nRecommended: Prior or concurrent enrollment in Evidence.\n\nNote: This course is only open to J.D. students.\n\nLAW 1861 v00 A Friend of the Court: Tools for Effective Amicus Advocacy\n\nJ.D. Seminar (cross-listed) | 2 credit hours\n\nLitigating Liberty introduces students to the practice of public interest litigation under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The class will examine cases from the perspective of the lawyers who fight constitutional battles and explore topics like how to select the right client, identify the right claims, and file in the right jurisdiction. The class will also discuss how to choose the right moment in history to bring suit and how to effectively utilize the media. There will be particular emphasis on teaching real-world litigation skills, such as how to approach motions to dismiss and discovery. Students will then act as the practitioners themselves and fight for their cases on summary judgment, giving students practical experience in the day-to-day life of a constitutional litigator.\n\nLAW 1849 v00 Abolitionism and the Law Seminar\n\nJ.D. Seminar | 3 credit hours\n\nThis seminar will cover the history and present of abolitionist movements in the United States and the role of law in resisting or hastening abolition, mainly of slavery, but also of prisons and policing today. The first half of the course will present a legal history of abolitionism. Students will learn about the founding constitutional accommodations to slavery and the role of the Supreme Court in enforcing those constitutional protections of enslavers prior to the Civil War. They will also learn about the modes of abolitionist resistance to slavery, including freedom suits by enslaved persons and legal challenges on behalf of fugitives as well as abolitionists’ petitions to state and federal legislatures to end slavery. They will read and engage with iconic primary abolitionists texts from the colonial, revolutionary and pre-Civil War eras to understand the moral, constitutional, and political arguments levelled against slavery. They will also read and understand the original intentions of the drafters of the Reconstruction Amendments and engage with their conception of “abolition democracy,” that is, the democratic society they hoped to create to ensure freedom and equality for the formerly enslaved. The second half of the course will engage with abolition now, particularly the legal and social movements for abolition of modern slavery, prisons, and endemically violent policing. Students will read excerpts from signature works on contemporary abolitionism, including key law review articles on prison and policing abolition and on “abolitionist constitutionalism.” They will grapple with the relevance of abolitionist thought to modern aspirations concerning individual freedom, equality, and democracy.\n\nLearning Outcomes: (1) Students will learn about the role of abolitionists and abolitionist thought in shaping American law and guarantees of freedom and equality. (2) Students will demonstrate an ability to produce an original, high quality research paper. (3) Students will demonstrate an ability to give constructive feedback on the work of their peers. (4) Students will engage in critical analysis of the gap between our professed founding ideals of freedom and the reality for historically and presently subordinated persons and develop concrete ideas in their papers on what to do about it.\n\nMutually Excluded Courses: Students may not receive credit for this seminar and Reconstruction and Civil Rights Seminar.\n\nLAW 534 v01 Access to Health Care and Coverage: Law and Policy\n\nJ.D. Course (cross-listed) | 3 credit hours\n\nThe law governing access to health care has been in flux and in legal dispute in recent years. This course will examine America's programs for health care access and finance, including employment-based private insurance, Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, and VA. The course will also examine the enactment, implementation, and litigation of the Affordable Care Act. In addition to these payment systems, the course will also at laws affecting non-comprehensive systems such as emergency rooms, public hospitals, and community health centers. No previous knowledge of health law is required.\n\nNote: The course will not focus on biomedical ethics, medical malpractice, or pharmaceutical regulation.\n\nThis is a required course for the U.S. Health Law Certificate.\n\nLAW 1879 v00 Access to Justice, Legal Empowerment, and Social Movement Lawyering Seminar\n\nJ.D. Seminar (cross-listed) | 2-3 credit hours\n\nBeginning in the 20th Century, various approaches have arisen in the United States to improve access to civil justice and use the law to empower marginalized people and communities. This course critically examines the role of lawyers in these efforts. In particular, it considers what roles lawyers play to further access to justice, empower people through the law, and work alongside social movements. After exploring studies of peoples’ experiences of the justice system, we consider the function of courts in entrenching poverty and inequality, the potential and limits of technologies in increasing access to justice; and the challenges of rural access to justice. We then turn to global and national legal empowerment initiatives to consider bottom-up approaches to making legal rights and protections available to marginalized people. In the last part of the semester, we will explore the opportunities and challenges in social movement lawyering and consider the synergies and disjunctions between these lawyering practices and efforts to enhance access to justice.\n\nLearning Outcomes: By the end of this course, we hope you will be able to:\n\ndescribe and discuss the different dimensions of the access to justice crisis in the United States and the various approaches being pursued to address it;\n\ngain an understanding of marginalized people and communities’ experiences of the justice system;\n\nunderstand what role state and local court processes and procedures play in exacerbating the justice gap;\n\narticulate and critique the theories of change underlying traditional and more expansive approaches to access to justice, legal empowerment, and social movement lawyering;\n\nunderstand the role of the regulatory framework in facilitating or inhibiting new models to increase access to justice.\n\nNote: J.D. students must register for the 3 credit section of the seminar if they wish to write a paper fulfilling the J.D. Upperclass Legal Writing Requirement. The paper requirements of the two-credit section will not fulfill the J.D. Upperclass Legal Writing Requirement.\n\nLAW 3166 v00 Access to Reproductive Healthcare Under the Law (How We Got to Dobbs and What’s Next?)\n\nLL.M. Seminar (cross-listed) | 2 credit hours\n\nThe course will look at the legal treatment of reproductive rights in early America through the mid-1800’s and to the legalization of abortion. We will examine how we got from Roe v. Wade to Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Care and discuss the legal and practical impact of the Supreme Court’s reversal of Roe, as well as state attempts to ban or restrict abortion. The course will directly address Institutional Learning Objective 8 by requiring students to think critically about the law’s claim to neutrality and its differential effects on subordinated groups, including those identified by race, gender, indigeneity, and class and consider whether one person’s moral or ethical position should prevail when that position has disparate negative impacts on marginalized communities. We will look at how the law is intersecting with issues of race, sex, class, religion, sexual orientation, and politics to shape the culture of the country and our individual lives. The course will conclude with a review of the current legal battles relating to abortion, emergency contraception, assisted reproduction and gender affirming care, and discuss the legal theories at play, which are being used by both sides of the debate in competing iterations.\n\nPrerequisite: Constitutional Law.\n\nNote: This course meets the upper-level graduation requirement for JD students matriculating in Fall 2022 and later under the following Institutional Learning Outcome, which provides that the course will provide students with an \"[a]bility to think critically about the law’s claim to neutrality and its differential effects on subordinated groups, including those identified by race, gender, indigeneity, and class.\"\n\nLAW 300 v08 Accounting for Lawyers\n\nJ.D. Course | 2 credit hours\n\nThis course introduces students to the basic elements of financial statements and how the financial statements can provide information on the operations, prospects, and financial condition of a business or entity. We will discuss the accounting principles or concepts used in preparing financial statements; how to account for certain specific items such as receivables, inventories, fixed assets, intangible assets, liabilities and contingencies, and revenue and expenses; and how the basic transactions of a business flow through the financial statements. We will also discuss the role and responsibilities of independent auditors, senior company executives, and the audit committee of the board of directors in the preparation of the financial statements. Finally, we will study the financial statements of various companies to see what these financial statements reveal about the companies, and we will study some examples of accounting fraud and discuss how perpetrators of the fraud violated applicable accounting principles.\n\nThis course is designed for students with no prior accounting background or experience. Students who have completed one or more university level accounting courses or have practical training in accounting should not enroll in this course unless they obtain instructor permission.\n\nMutually Excluded Courses: Students may not receive credit for both this course and the graduate courses, Basic Accounting Concepts for Lawyers, Basic Accounting for Lawyers, or Financial Reporting and Accounting. Students MAY receive credit for this course and Business and Financial Basics for Lawyers.\n\nLAW 3091 v01 Addiction and Mental Health Law\n\nLL.M Seminar (cross-listed) | 2 credit hours\n\nAccording to a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) 2021 survey, nearly 1 in 3 adults had either a substance use disorder or a mental illness in the prior year, and 46 percent of young adults 18-25 had either a substance use disorder or a mental illness. Due to the increased prevalence of these chronic disorders, and their nexus to the public health crisis of suicide, opioid addiction, and homelessness, it is critically important for lawyers and advocates to have a strong understanding of behavioral health law from the constitutional to local regulatory level.\n\nThis course is a practice-based seminar that is designed to improve the students’ practical legal skills – writing, analysis, oral communication, issue spotting, and attention to detail – while examining key laws, legal decisions, and policies in Addiction and Mental Health Law. This seminar will explore the framework of laws and policies promoting human rights, dignity, and recovery for people with substance use disorders and mental health conditions. It will highlight systemic and community responses to addiction, mental health, and related social issues as well as the use of litigation, legislation, advocacy, grants and financial incentives as tools for prevention and reform.\n\nDiscussions will include:\n\nInstitution-based issues such as the involuntary detention and civil commitments of individuals with a serious mental illness, restraint and seclusion, the right to appropriate treatment under Youngberg v. Romeo, institutional reform under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and Monell v. Department of Social Services of the City of New York, and the Department of Justice’s authority under the Civil Rights for Institutionalized Persons Act;\n\nForensic issues such as pretrial competency, Not Guilty By Reason of Insanity, and forced medication for competency purposes under Sell v. United States;\n\nCommunity-based issues such as deinstitutionalization, rights of an individual to receive services in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs, housing discrimination, Medicaid, rulemaking and administrative adjudications under the Administrative Procedure Act, behavioral health provider licensure and regulation, and the False Claims Act;\n\nFederal and state/local initiatives such as 911 diversion programs and co-responder law enforcement teams, mental health courts and diversion, harm reduction strategies, e.g. decriminalization of fentanyl testing paraphernalia, federal State Opioid Response grants, rapid rehousing initiations, and liberalization of 42 CFR Part 2 to facilitate increased information sharing for Substance Use Disorder treatment records;\n\nUnderstanding the Triple Aim in healthcare, data, outcome measures, and healthcare finance structures for behavioral health, including Medicaid and commercial insurance;\n\nRole of the health care and criminal justice systems and trends in reforms; and\n\nCultural competence in legal advocacy and practice.\n\nGuest lectures and discussion will provide real world case studies on laws and policy reforms impacting addiction and mental health.\n\nMutually Excluded Courses: Students may not receive credit for this course and Addiction and Mental Health Law and Policy.\n\nLAW 3091 v00 Addiction and Mental Health Law and Policy\n\nLL.M Seminar (cross-listed) | 2 credit hours\n\nAddiction and mental health have increasingly become an integral part of the broader policy landscape. This shift has been accelerated by the impact of social issues such as the overdose epidemic, suicide and homelessness. This seminar will explore the framework of laws and policies promoting human rights, dignity, and recovery for people with substance use disorders and mental health conditions. It will highlight systemic and community responses to addiction, mental health, and related social issues as well as the use of litigation, legislation, advocacy and financial incentives as tools for reform.\n\nDiscussion will include:\n\nEvolution of responses to addiction, mental health, and related social issues;\n\nHuman rights, deinstitutionalization and the rights of an individual to receive services in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs;\n\nStatutory and regulatory frameworks promoting access to treatment, including the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act;\n\nUnderstanding data, outcome measures, and healthcare finance structures for behavioral health, including Medicaid and commercial insurance;\n\nThe role of litigation to promote accountability and protect civil rights;\n\nThe impact of stigma, the dignity of risk, and harm reduction philosophy;\n\nRole of the health care and criminal justice systems and trends in reforms;\n\nThe impact of globalization and comparative analysis of international drug policy;\n\nCultural competence in legal advocacy and practice.\n\nGuest lectures and discussion will provide real world case studies on laws and policy reforms impacting addiction and mental health.\n\nLAW 025 v00 Administrative Law\n\nJ.D. Course (cross-listed) | 3 credit hours\n\nThis course considers the constitutional, statutory, and other legal limitations on what government agencies can do and how they can do it. What constraints govern the power of agencies to make law, decide cases involving private parties, and investigate citizens? How much \"due process\" must government agencies give citizens whose lives they affect; what limits has Congress imposed on the procedures for agency decision making; and to what extent can people call on courts to check what they regard as abuses of governmental power? These are among the questions addressed in the course, which draws together problems ranging from the legitimacy of New Deal institutions to the dramatic procedural innovations of recent federal administrations and problems created by renewed Congressional interest in the details of agency decision making.\n\nRecommended: For Professor Nager's section: Prior or concurrent enrollment in Constitutional Law I: The Federal System.\n\nMutually Excluded Courses: Students may not receive credit for both this course and the first-year elective by the same name or the first-year course, Government Processes.\n\nLAW 025 v06 Administrative Law\n\nJ.D. Course | 3 credit hours\n\nThis course is designed to introduce you to the core institutions and processes of the modern administrative state. You will come to understand the tremendous power exercised by administrative agencies as well as the significant constraints under which they operate. You will learn the procedures governing the key categories of administrative action; the doctrine governing judicial review of administrative action; and non-judicial mechanisms of agency control within the Constitution’s separation-of-powers framework.\n\nLearning Goals: By the end of the semester, you should be able to:\n\n(1) Identify the legal framework (statutory, constitutional, doctrinal) that applies to a particular issue of administrative action;\n\n(2) Apply the relevant legal framework to a given set of facts; and\n\n(3) Evaluate the merits of the legal framework against a variety of normative goals.\n\nYou should also (4) be conversant in contemporary debates about the administrative state and be able to articulate and justify your views.\n\nMutually Excluded Courses: Students may not receive credit for this course and the upperclass course with the same title.\n\nNote: This course is a first-year elective. First-year day students select an elective offered in the spring.\n\nLAW 025 v08 Administrative Law\n\nJ.D. Course | 3 credit hours\n\nVirtually all areas of law today involve a substantial element of administrative law. This course introduces you to the role of administrative agencies and how law and political factors shape their powers and work. This includes materials on how they are empowered and constrained by the Constitution, Congress, presidents, and the courts. We also study ways in which agencies generate law and develop policies. This class coverage includes, among other topics, materials on citizens’ abilities to petition, shape, and litigate over agency actions; changing views of presidents’ roles and powers over agencies; and statutory factors and doctrine shaping judicial review of agency law interpretation, reasoning, responsiveness, policy shifts, and engagement with science and facts.\n\nMutually Excluded Courses: Students may not receive credit for both this course and the first-year elective by the same name or the first-year course, Government Processes.\n\nLAW 1611 v00 Administrative Law and Public Administration Seminar\n\nJ.D. Seminar | 2-3 credit hours\n\nAdministrative law scholars have observed an increasing disconnect between the legal framework and doctrine governing agencies, on the one hand, and the way that the administrative state actually operates, on the other. For example, administrative law tends to concern itself with external sources of control over agencies, while in fact most of the work of the administrative state takes place in day-to-day internal operations. In this seminar, we use administrative law as a jumping off point to study a complementary set of frameworks and practices that govern and explain the operation of the administrative state: those drawn from public administration and political science. Lawyers who understand these complementary tools will be better prepared to advise clients on their interactions with institutions in the administrative state; to work within the institutions of the administrative state themselves; and to design and reform those institutions in the first instance.\n\nThis course is also a writing-intensive class that satisfies the Upperclass Legal Writing Requirement. To that end, each of you will devote a considerable amount of time this semester to developing a paper proposal about a conflict, crisis, or controversy within the operations of a government institution; researching your idea in depth; and both drafting and revising a substantial paper of at least six thousand words (exclusive of footnotes) that meets the different elements of the Writing Requirement. The last month of the semester will be devoted to workshopping these papers—that is, giving feedback to and receiving feedback from your colleagues.\n\nLearning goals:\n\nBy the end of the course, students will be able to describe and discuss the core insights of the texts we will read; to assess the merits of these insights; and to apply these insights to everyday situations relevant to the institutions of government in D.C. and beyond. Students will also have written a paper of publishable quality analyzing and assessing a conflict, crisis, or controversy within the operations of a government institution using the lens of the tools we have studied.\n\nPrerequisite: Administrative Law (1L elective or upper level course) or the 1L electives, Legislation and Regulation or Leg-Reg: Introduction to Congress and the Administrative State.\n\nNote: This seminar requires a paper. J.D. students must register for the 3 credit section of the seminar if they wish to write a paper fulfilling the Upperclass Legal Writing Requirement. The paper requirements of the 2 credit section will not fulfill the J.D. Upperclass Legal Writing Requirement.\n\nLAW 1787 v00 Adoption Law & Policy Seminar\n\nJ.D. Seminar | 2-3 credit hours\n\nAdoption Law & Policy is a seminar that addresses the fundamental and evolving issues that arise when adoptive families are created by law. Topics may include: (1) an overview of the history of adoption law and current trends in adoption policy and practice; (2) the adoption process including an examination of the differences between agency and independent adoption, and the form, timing and revocability of parental consent to adoption; (3) placement criteria (including the race and sexual orientation of the adoptive parent); (4) constitutional rights of nonmarital fathers; (5) adoption of Native American children and the Indian Child Welfare Act; (6) confidentiality and openness in adoption practice; (7) international adoption; and (8) and government law and policy on the adoption of children from foster care. Throughout the semester we will consider the broader historical, societal and political elements shaping adoption law.\n\nNote: This seminar requires a paper. J.D. students must register for the 3 credit section of the seminar if they wish to write a paper fulfilling the Upperclass Legal Writing Requirement. The paper requirements of the 2 credit section will not fulfill the J.D. Upperclass Legal Writing Requirement.\n\nLAW 1905 v00 Advanced Administrative Law Seminar – The Consumer Protection Agencies\n\nJ.D. Seminar | 2 credit hours\n\nThe course’s goal is to familiarize students with the challenges consumer protection agencies face. The course will focus on the Federal Trade Commission, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and the Food and Drug Administration. The course will require significant readings about contemporary policy issues, and those readings will be the launching point for in-class discussions. Many of the readings will come from the Federal Register and the Administrative Conference of the United States; others will critique the work of one or more of the consumer protection agencies. During seminars, students will often engage in role-playing: some students will take on the role of senior agency officials, others will be lawyers for consumer groups that seeks to force the agency to take certain actions (regulatory or enforcement), or lawyers representing a company or trade association opposing regulation or to stave off enforcement actions.\n\nPrerequisite: Administrative Law.\n\nLAW 1528 v00 Advanced Antitrust Seminar: Antitrust and Intellectual Property\n\nJ.D. Seminar (cross-listed) | 2-3 credit hours\n\nThe intersection of antitrust and intellectual property underlies many key debates in contemporary competition law and presents topics of recurring importance. This advanced seminar introduces students to the antitrust/intellectual property interface, including the economics of innovation, the debate over the relationship between the two fields, and the impact of the evolution of that relationship on the antitrust analysis of specific practices. Topics include the economics of innovation, licensing practices, product design and tying, patent settlements, patent pools, standard setting, the acquisition of intellectual property rights, patent assertion entities, the assertion of IP rights, antitrust counterclaims in U.S. litigation, and select contemporary debates. Grades will be based on bi-weekly papers written in response to the assigned readings; class participation can increase, but not decrease, the course grade.\n\nLearning Objectives:\n\nStudents taking this course will:\n\nDevelop an understanding of the basic economics of innovation and their application of those principles to antitrust law and its intersection with intellectual property law.\n\nAcquire an overview of key aspects of the intersection of antitrust and intellectual property in U.S. law, both in litigation and agency settings.\n\nExplore recurring tensions between antitrust and intellectual property through the lens of particular practices.\n\nDebate competing positions on the antitrust laws’ application to cutting-edge issues in IP-rich industries.\n\nPrerequisite: For J.D. students, prior or concurrent enrollment in Antitrust Law or Antitrust Economics and Law. (Note that prior enrollment strongly recommended; concurrent enrollment accepted.) For LL.M. students: prior U.S. antitrust litigation experience or U.S. antitrust coursework is strongly recommended.\n\nNote: A limited number of students may register for the 3 credit section of this seminar if they wish to write a paper fulfilling the Upperclass Legal Writing Requirement. Students who register for the 3 credit section will write fewer weekly response papers, in addition to the paper for the Upperclass Legal Writing Requirement.\n\nLAW 1716 v00 Advanced Constitutional Law Seminar: Challenges to Liberal Democracies\n\nJ.D. Seminar | 2-3 credit hours\n\nThis seminar examines the challenges to constitutional democracies from illiberalism, i.e. the concentration of power that relies on elections, limits judicial independence, and abuses the rule of law in the name of the people. Many so-called democracies have serious flaws in their election systems, limited judicial independence, and elected leaders who are not held in check by functioning rule of law processes/checks and balances.\n\nIn the United States, efforts have been made to change rules for voting, draw electoral districts to give extreme partisan advantage, and use federal government agencies as weapons to thwart checks and balances. In this seminar we apply a multidisciplinary approach to the American situation, putting legal (in particular constitutional) transformation in the center. Specific topics include constitutional amendment, limitations on judicial independence, control over the media, takings and other restrictions of the free market, voter suppression and gerrymandering, plebiscites (e.g., Brexit), and threats to fundamental rights.\n\nIn addition to considering Turkey and the countries of East Central Europe, where voters have chosen autocratic leaders, we will also examine the Russian approach which has served as a model for many emerging illiberal regimes as well as a financial and intellectual support for illiberal movements from France to Italy and elsewhere, to better understand developments in the U.S. In addition, the course will consider how crises, such as public health issues or civil unrest, are used as justification for limiting true democracy.\n\nIn addition to examining the legal structures that permit this abuse of the democratic form, this course will also address the critical question of whether a democracy is sustainable in the face of ethno- or religious populism. Are there sources of constitutional resilience to save the remaining constitutional regimes?\n\nRecommended: Prior or concurrent enrollment in Constitutional Law I: The Federal System.\n\nNote: This seminar requires a paper. J.D. students must register for the 3 credit section of the seminar if they wish to write a paper fulfilling the Upperclass Legal Writing Requirement. The paper requirements of the 2 credit section will not fulfill the J.D. Upperclass Legal Writing Requirement.\n\nLAW 1265 v00 Advanced Constitutional Law Seminar: The Creation of the Constitution\n\nJ.D. Seminar (cross-listed) | 2-3 credit hours\n\nFew events have had as much impact on American history than the framing and ratification of the Constitution. This seminar is designed to offer students with serious interests in history, political theory, and constitutional law an opportunity to learn more about these events by reading some of the best scholarship on the creation of the Constitution and by writing an original research paper on an appropriate topic of their choosing. The seminar will examine how the Constitution was framed, ratified, and implemented during both the founding of the Republic and the “Second Founding” during and after the Civil War. Special attention will be given to founding-era controversies involving slavery, federalism, and implied powers, and to how these issues influenced the adoption and interpretation of the Reconstruction Amendments.\n\nPrerequisite: Constitutional Law I: The Federal System (or Democracy and Coercion).\n\nNote: J.D. students must register for the 3 credit section of the seminar if they wish to write a paper fulfilling the J.D. Upperclass Legal Writing Requirement. The paper requirements of the two-credit section will not fulfill the J.D. Upperclass Legal Writing Requirement.\n\nLAW 1648 v00 Advanced Corporate Finance: Quantitative Analysis and Valuation\n\nJ.D. Course (cross-listed) | 2 credit hours\n\nThis two-credit course provides an introduction to basic quantitative analysis and valuation techniques in corporate finance. Students will learn the fundamentals of valuation as it relates to a variety of assets, including bonds, stocks, options, and derivatives. Our class discussion will also touch on real problems that students are likely to face in legal practice.\n\nTopics covered include: analysis of basic financial statements; net present value and internal rate of return; dividend discount model; bond pricing, yields, and the term structure of interest rates; the capital asset pricing model (CAPM); weighted average cost of capital; arbitrage pricing theory; free cash flow analysis; efficient and alternative theories of capital markets; capital structure and leverage; dividend and payout policy; put and call option pricing; the BlackScholes model; warrants and convertibles; and real options. If time permits, we will also touch on more advanced pricing techniques that use stochastic processes such as random walks.\n\nIn addition to teaching these tangible skills, the course will develop students’ mathematical intuition, which will enable them to navigate financial problems with more confidence in their professional and personal lives. This mathematical intuition will be built up through three problem sets I will assign. These problem sets will also enable students to gain familiarity with Microsoft Excel, which we will use at various points during the semester.\n\nOur readings will consist solely of free online materials. Primarily we will be relying on Ivo Welch, Corporate Finance, 4th Edition, 2017 (available at: https://book.ivo-welch.info/read/index4.html). Class attendance is mandatory and along with participation will count for 10% of the final grade. Problem sets will count for 20% of the final grade, with the remaining 70% determined by a comprehensive 3 ½ hour final exam.\n\nRecommended: Prior or concurrent enrollment in Corporations or Corporate Finance or Business Basics for Lawyers or Business Essentials: A Mini-MBA for Lawyers or Accounting for Lawyers.\n\nLAW 1776 v00 Advanced Criminal Law Seminar: Race and Poverty in Capital and Other Criminal Cases\n\nJ.D. Seminar (cross-listed) | 1 credit hour\n\nThis course addresses the issues of race, poverty, mental illness, and other issues of fairness and equality in the criminal courts, particularly in death penalty cases. Topics include procedures for imposing the death penalty and racial disparities in capital sentencing, the impartiality and independence of elected judges in the state courts, competency for trial and other issues involving the mental health and intellectual functioning of people accused of crimes, and practices and procedures regarding clemency.\n\nCourse Goals and Learning Objectives: Students will develop knowledge and understanding of issues regarding the imposition of the death penalty, the impartiality of judges, the treatment of people with mental disorders and intellectual disabilities in the criminal courts, and the consideration of applications for clemency. Students will engage with the views of Supreme Court justices, lower court judges, legislators, governors and commentators with regard to issues of fairness and discrimination in the state and federal governments in carrying out the death penalty since the Supreme Court allowed its resumption in 1976. The course will also address decision-making in the state courts. The overwhelming majority of cases – both criminal and civil – are decided in the state courts. In most states, judges are elected. Students will consider issues of whether judges are influenced by political considerations or have biases with regard to people of color who come before them. Students will learn the grounds for disqualification of a judge who may be biased and the law and procedures for resolving those issues. Students will also learn that the criminal courts deal with a significant number of people with serious mental disorders. Students will learn the legal standards for competency to stand trial, competency to waive appeals, and competency to be executed, as well as the procedures for deciding those issues. Students will also learn how the President of the United States and governors decide whether to commute death sentences and other severe sentences and practices regarding applications for clemency. Finally, as part of the course, students will learn how to analyze issues and set out their views in writing and orally, supporting their positions with solid legal reasoning and proper citation to the relevant authorities.\n\nRecommended: Criminal Justice and/or Criminal Law.\n\nNote: WEEK ONE COURSE. This seminar will meet for one week only, on the following days: Monday, January 8, 2024, through Friday, January 12, 2024, 1:30 p.m. - 4:05 p.m. This course is mandatory pass/fail and will not count toward the 7 credit pass/fail limit for J.D. students.\n\nATTENDANCE IS MANDATORY AT ALL CLASS SESSIONS. Enrolled students must be in attendance at the start of the first class session in order to remain enrolled. Waitlisted students must be in attendance at the start of the first class session in order to remain eligible to be admitted off the waitlist. All enrolled students must attend each class session in its entirety. Failure to attend the first class session in its entirety will result in a drop; failure to attend any subsequent class session in its entirety may result in a withdrawal. Enrolled students will have until the beginning of the second class session to request a drop by contacting the Office of the Registrar; a student who no longer wishes to remain enrolled after the second class session begins will not be permitted to drop the class but may request a withdrawal from an academic advisor in the Office of Academic Affairs. Withdrawals are permitted up until the last class for this specific course.\n\nLAW 032 v00 Advanced Criminal Procedure\n\nJ.D. Course | 2 credit hours\n\nAdvanced Criminal Procedure picks up where Criminal Justice leaves off and is primarily interested in the decisions that lawyers (as opposed to the police) confront in the criminal justice system. This course will cover topics that criminal defendants face from “bail to jail”, including charging decisions/prosecutorial discretion, bail and pre-trial detention, plea bargaining, effective assistance of counsel, and sentencing. This course will examine the responsibilities and the power allocated to each of the players in the criminal justice system, including judges, prosecutors, defense counsel, law enforcement, and defendants. At each stage, we will ask whether the system is working optimally, how the process may be improved and the pressure points where the system may be changed. Throughout the course, students will step into the shoes of the prosecution and defense to evaluate the strategic choices made during the trial. Readings will include a review of the relevant Rules of Criminal Procedure, United States Supreme Court caselaw, pleadings from assorted topical cases, and late-breaking newspaper articles.\n\nPrerequisite: Criminal Justice (or Democracy and Coercion) or Criminal Procedure.\n\nRecommended: Evidence and Criminal Law.\n\nMutually Excluded Courses: Students may not receive credit for both this course and Advanced Criminal Procedure and Litigation or Criminal Justice II: Criminal Trials.\n\nLAW 032 v03 Advanced Criminal Procedure and Litigation\n\nJ.D. Course | 2 credit hours\n\nThis course addresses the law, strategy, and ethical considerations of criminal procedure and litigation beginning with the decision to commence an investigation and/or charge through sentencing. Topics to be explored will include the prosecutorial decision to charge, representation (e.g., conflicts) of and compensation (e.g., forfeiture) by client issues, grand jury practice, immunity and plea negotiating, discovery, motions practice, prosecutorial and defense misconduct, selected trial issues, and sentencing. Materials for this course will include court opinions, pleadings from actual cases, Department of Justice manuals and policies, and news and law articles. The course may be organized around an actual case from its investigation inception, through pre-trial motions and discovery, to trial and verdict.\n\nPrerequisite: Criminal Justice (or Democracy and Coercion) or Criminal Procedure.\n\nMutually Excluded Courses: Students may not receive credit for both this course and Advanced Criminal Procedure or Criminal Justice II: Criminal Trials.\n\nLAW 029 v00 Advanced Environmental Law: Climate Change (Project-Based Practicum)\n\nJ.D. Practicum (cross-listed) | 4 credit hours\n\nIn a project-based practicum course, students participate in a weekly seminar and work on a project under the supervision of their professor. This project-based practicum course will focus on the evolving legal and policy developments concerning global climate change, and provide students the opportunity to engage in hands-on work with policymakers in addressing the issue. Students will participate in a two hour/week seminar and carry out ten hours/week of project work including regularly scheduled meetings with professor and Georgetown Climate Center attorney advisors.\n\nSEMINAR: This seminar covers the current understanding of climate change science and impacts, international and domestic policy approaches, technological and adaptation responses, and legal and regulatory cases and developments. Class participation and attendance will be graded.\n\nPROJECT WORK: Students will prepare papers and make presentations in class and to outside partners on topics being analyzed for state and local governments through the work of the Georgetown Climate Center of Georgetown Law. Students work with the professors and advisors to develop professional-quality work products that can be shared with outside partners. The Center works with states and communities on crafting policy strategies to reduce emissions that contribute to climate change and to adapt to the consequences of climate change.\n\nPrerequisite: Environmental Law. J.D. students must complete the required first-year program prior to enrolling in this course (part-time and interdivisional transfer students may enroll prior to completing Criminal Justice, Property, or their first-year elective).\n\nMutually Excluded Courses: Students may not take another practicum course or a clinic at the same time as a project-based practicum course. Students may enroll in an externship at the same time as a project-based practicum course.\n\nNote: This course may be suitable for evening students who can regularly attend class and participate in calls or meetings during the day as students interact with professors, advisors, and/or clients.\n\nThis is a four credit course. Two credits will be awarded for the two-hour weekly seminar and two credits for approximately ten hours of project work per week, for a minimum of 11 weeks. Both the seminar portion and the project work will be graded. Students who enroll in this course will be automatically enrolled in both the seminar and project components and may not take either component separately. After Add/Drop, a student who wishes to withdraw from a practicum course must obtain permission from the faculty member and the Assistant Dean for Experiential Education. The Assistant Dean will grant such withdrawal requests only when remaining enrolled in the practicum would cause significant hardship for the student. A student who is granted permission to withdraw will be withdrawn from both the seminar and project components. Regular and punctual attendance is required at all practicum seminars and students are required to devote the requisite number of hours to their project. If a student must miss seminar, project work, a meeting or a deliverable, he or she must speak to the professor as soon as possible (ideally beforehand) to discuss the absence or missed assignment. Unless the professor indicates otherwise, a student with more than one unexcused absence from the practicum seminar (out of 13 total seminar sessions), or one week of unexcused absences from the fieldwork or project work (out of a total of 11 weeks of fieldwork or project work), may receive a lower grade or, at the professor’s discretion, may be withdrawn from the practicum course. In practicum courses, students do not provide legal advice, prepare legal documents, appear in court or before agencies, or do any course work that is construed as practicing law under D.C. Court of Appeals Rule 49 (Unauthorized Practice of Law). No attorney-client relationship is created by students’ work in this practicum course.\n\nLAW 1712 v00 Advanced Evidence\n\nJ.D. Course | 3 credit hours\n\nThis course will take an in-depth look at issues involving the law of evidence. The topics discussed will likely fall into three categories. This first category concerns constitutional limitations on evidence rules such as the Confrontation Clause, a criminal defendant’s constitutional right to present a defense, and the impeachment of jury verdicts. The second category concerns advanced problems involving character, hearsay, experts, and privileges. The third category concerns the process of proof in civil and criminal cases and will focus on topics such as burdens and standards of proof, evidentiary presumptions, and judicial notice.\n\nPrerequisite: Evidence.\n\nMutually Excluded Courses: Students may not receive credit for this course and Advanced Evidence Seminar.\n\nLAW 1712 v01 Advanced Evidence Seminar\n\nJ.D. Seminar | 2 credit hours\n\nThis course will take an in-depth look at issues involving the law of evidence. The topics discussed will likely fall into three categories. This first category concerns constitutional limitations on evidence rules such as the Confrontation Clause, a criminal defendant’s constitutional right to present a defense, and the impeachment of jury verdicts. The second category concerns advanced problems involving character, hearsay, experts, and privileges. The third category concerns the process of proof in civil and criminal cases and will focus on topics such as burdens and standards of proof, evidentiary presumptions, and judicial notice.\n\nPrerequisite: Evidence.\n\nMutually Excluded Courses: Students may not receive credit for this seminar and Advanced Evidence.\n\nLAW 168 v00 Advanced Evidence: Supreme Court and the Constitution Seminar\n\nJ.D. Seminar | 3 credit hours\n\nThis seminar examines advanced subjects in evidence that were not treated or not treated in depth in the basic Evidence course but are important to trial practice.\n\nPrerequisite: Evidence.\n\nLAW 1089 v00 Advanced Evidence: Trial Skills\n\nJ.D. Skills | 2 credit hours\n\nThis course will bridge the gap between the academic subject of evidence and the practitioner’s course of trial practice by teaching students how to use evidence as a functional tool in the courtroom. There will be brief overviews of the law, but the vast majority of this course is dedicated to teaching students through realistic examples how particular rules are used during trial and when and how to make objections. The course is structured and allocates time according to the importance of topics. For example, the evidentiary doctrine of judicial notice will be addressed, but the course will take time to examine evidentiary issues that are used in most trials, such as party admissions or business records. Through practical exercises, students will prepare arguments and defend their arguments through thoughtful researched positions (as is done in real trial work.) These practical exercises will make up the majority of the course work. Students will also learn how to lay the foundation for introducing evidence into a trial as exhibits. Once the item or document is introduced, students will learn how to effectively use the exhibits in the presentation of their case. The course will culminate in a final assignment where students learn and practice how to write, argue, and defend evidentiary motions in limine, a fundamental component of litigation practice.\n\nPrerequisite: Evidence.\n\nStrongly Recommended: Trial Practice.\n\nMutually Excluded Courses: Students may not receive credit for both this class and Trial Practice and Applied Evidence. Students may take this course and Trial Practice.\n\nNote: FIRST CLASS ATTENDANCE IS MANDATORY. Enrolled students must be in attendance at the start of the first class session in order to remain enrolled. Waitlisted students must be in attendance at the start of the first class session in order to remain eligible to be admitted off the waitlist.\n\nLAW 1745 v00 Advanced Foreign Intelligence Law\n\nJ.D. Course (cross-listed) | 3 credit hours\n\nForeign Intelligence (FI) law as a field is marked by a complex statutory and regulatory framing. Increasingly, it is coming into play in ordinary Article III courts in the United States, as well as in European courts overseas. Simultaneously, new and emerging technologies present fundamental challenges to the traditional FI collection paradigms. This course, accordingly, provides students already broadly familiar with the contours of the national security infrastructure and foreign intelligence collection with the opportunity to do a deep dive with a particular eye towards ways in which technology alters threat vectors and presents new opportunities, and risks, to the foreign intelligence regime.\n\nIt begins with the constitutional framing and historical background undergirding the introduction of statutory and regulatory measures. The course then dissects the 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) and its expansion in 1994 to incorporate physical search and again in 1998 to include the use of pen register and trap and trace devices, as well as certain business records. The attacks of 9/11 led to additional changes, with further alterations implemented by the 2008 FISA Amendments Act. Discussion centers on targeting, querying, and minimization procedures adopted by the National Security Agency/Central Security Service, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and National Counterterrorism Center, as well as reports detailing use of FISA.\n\nThe course next turns to new technologies that have fundamentally shifted the type of information available to the intelligence community (IC). Special emphasis is given to technologies of import for metadata: social network analytics and algorithmic sciences. It looks at how these technologies mesh with the legal analysis, with particular attention paid to FISA sections 215 and 702.\n\nThe course then addresses Executive Order 12333, delving into the associated DoD Directives, Instructions, Manuals, and Annexes; Attorney General Guidelines; CIA Regulations and Directives; and parallel regulatory and policy documents throughout the IC. With the advent of the Internet of Things, next generation social media, 6G networks, artificial intelligence and machine learning, the landscape is about to again shift. Accordingly, the course will further address new and emerging technologies, looking at how they fit – or fail to fit – current law.\n\nThe course ends with a unit focused on doctrinal developments (specialized Article III courts, geographic Article III courts, and European tribunals), as well as Article II deliberations introduced via Executive Order in autumn 2022.\n\nPrerequisite: Constitutional Law I or Democracy and Coercion.\n\nNote: THIS COURSE REQUIRES PROFESSOR PERMISSION TO ENROLL. Interested students should email Todd Huntley (todd.huntley@law.georgetown.edu), Director of the National Security Law Program, explaining any relevant school or professional experience and attaching a resume.\n\nLAW 2073 v00 Advanced International Commercial Arbitration\n\nLL.M Course (cross-listed) | 3 credit hours\n\nThis course will provide an indepth study of specific topics in international commercial arbitration from both a theoretical and practical perspective. Topics to be considered will include:\n\nthe arbitration agreement - the separability doctrine, choice of law, parties to the agreement (including non-signatory issues), competence-competence, enforcement of the agreement and other types of national court intervention;\n\ncomplex arbitrations - multiparty and multicontract issues, joinder of parties, consolidation of cases, parallel proceedings;\n\nthe arbitral tribunal - selection of arbitrators, duties of arbitrators, independence and impartiality issues, challenges of arbitrators;\n\nthe arbitral proceedings - bifurcation, interim measures, evidentiary rules, the conduct of hearings; and\n\nthe arbitral award - drafting of awards, enforcement and setting aside of awards, the 1958 New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Awards.\n\nThe course will refer to arbitration rules, case law, statutes and international conventions.\n\nPrerequisite: International Commercial Arbitration, Introduction to International Commercial Arbitration, or permission of the instructor.\n\nMutually Excluded Courses: This course is mutually exclusive with the other spring course by this same name (LAWG/J 888).\n\nNote: Please note, the date for the final class session will be announced at the start of the semester.\n\nLAW 710 v00 Advanced International Taxation\n\nLL.M Course (cross-listed) | 2 credit hours\n\nThis course is designed for those students who wish to gain a deeper understanding of the effect of certain U.S. rules governing the taxation of U.S. persons doing business overseas and foreign persons doing business in the United States. The course will cover a broad range of topics with particular emphasis on the tax consequences of cross-border reorganizations, liquidations and taxable acquisitions and dispositions. The course will cover the tax consequences of outbound transfers of assets, foreign-to-foreign transfers of assets, and inbound transfers of assets. Students will be expected to have a working knowledge of corporate taxation, and transactional aspects of subpart F and the foreign tax credit rules.\n\nPrerequisite: Corporate Income Tax Law I (or Corporate Taxation); International Tax (or U.S. International Outbound Tax).\n\nRecommended: Prior or concurrent enrollment in Corporate Income Tax Law II (or completion of Corporate Taxation).\n\nLAW 301 v03 Advanced Legal Research\n\nJ.D. Course | 2 credit hours\n\nIn this advanced course, students will learn the concepts and skills needed to research complex legal problems. This course will cover a wide range of legal research topics, including statutes, legislative history, court and government documents, administrative materials, practitioner tools, secondary sources, and specialized legal research. Students will also gain hands-on experience developing, implementing, and documenting appropriate research strategies, conducting research in an efficient manner, and citing resources appropriately for a professional-level work product.\n\nGrading will be based on class attendance and participation, a series of research assignments, and a take home exam.\n\nLearning Objectives:\n\nAs a result of this class, students will be able to:\n\nClassify different primary and secondary legal resources, regardless of format.\n\nEvaluate the costs and benefits of particular resources, regardless of format, and articulate major differences between resources.\n\nAnalyze a legal research problem and then design, execute, and document an efficient research plan.\n\nPrerequisite: Legal Practice: Writing and Analysis.\n\nMutually Excluded Courses: Students may not receive credit for both this course and Legal Research Skills for Practice.\n\nLAW 036 v06 Advanced Legal Writing and Practice for Judicial Clerks and Civil Litigators\n\nJ.D. Seminar | 2 credit hours\n\nThis two-credit seminar is designed to help students develop the legal writing and practice skills necessary to succeed as judicial law clerks and civil litigators. Students will have an opportunity to build upon the written and oral advocacy skills learned in first-year Legal Research and Writing by using those skills in a practical setting that simulates the litigation process. Throughout the semester, each student will play the role of advocate, law clerk, and judicial decision-maker and should expect to research and write a motion to dismiss and a bench memorandum (both about a single fact pattern). Students will also learn to reflect on their own writing process, collaborate effectively, and edit their own written work and the work of their colleagues—all critical skills for lawyers to develop early in their careers.\n\nClass format will vary from week to week. Some classes will be seminar-style discussions, others will simulate courtroom experiences, and others will feature guest speakers. One class session will be dedicated to the clerkship application process and clerkship experience and will feature advocates who have clerked in the state and federal courts. Class participation and attendance will count toward the final grade.\n\nThe out-of-class time commitment associated with the class will also vary from week to week. There will be some light reading for the course, particularly early in the semester, but for the most part students can expect to spend the bulk of out-of-class time actively engaged in research, writing, editing, or argument preparation--all of which may become time-intensive at key junctures of the semester.\n\nThrough this course students can expect to develop their research and writing skills, understand how to approach cases from multiple perspectives, and learn practical strategies for navigating the real-world challenges of litigation and legal workplaces. The instructor(s) will provide individualized feedback on student writing at multiple points during the semester, and the course will integrate opportunities to revise based on that feedback. By the end of the semester, students can expect to have generated approximately 40 pages of legal writing and produced two substantial writing samples that can be used to apply for judicial clerkships and/or litigation positions.\n\nLearning Objectives:\n\nStrengthen legal research, writing, and editing.\n\nDraft brief and bench memorandum.\n\nDeliver oral argument.\n\nPrerequisite: Legal Practice: Writing and Analysis.\n\nMutually Excluded Courses: Students may not receive credit for both this seminar and Advanced Legal Writing: Practical Skills from Retail Industry Examples, Advanced Legal Writing: Legal Writing as a Discipline, Advanced Legal Writing for International Business Lawyers, or Writing for Law Practice.\n\nNote: Students may not withdraw from this class after the add/drop period ends without the permission of the professor.\n\nLAW 1541 v00 Advanced Legal Writing and Practice: National Security Law in the Private Sector\n\nJ.D. Seminar | 2 credit hours\n\nOver the past decade, the practice of \"National Security Law\" as its own discipline in private practice has emerged, partially as a response to market demand for assistance with national security-related agencies, regulations, and issues, and partially as a realignment of several different areas of law into one holistic practice that benefits from cross-sectoral and cross-regulatory experience. (The relevant areas of law include government contracting, international trade, data privacy and security, telecommunications, transactional matters involving foreign direct investment, and other related issues.) This class is designed to prepare students to succeed as national security law practitioners by creating opportunities to develop skills relevant to the various stages of relevant matters, including counseling, investigations, administrative advocacy, and litigation. We will simulate the roles of law firm associate, law firm partner, law clerk, and judge through oral presentations and substantial writing projects (which may be used to develop writing samples suitable for applying to clerkships or other roles). Students will also learn to edit their own work and the work of others. Class format will vary week-to-week and include practice simulations, guest speakers, and seminar-style discussions.\n\nEach student will complete three primary assignments:\n\nA memorandum or similar piece of writing for counseling (~10 pages)\n\nA motion, brief, or similar piece of advocacy writing (section) (~15 pages)\n\nOral presentation related to the second writing assignment (~7 minutes)\n\nLearning Objectives:\n\nImprove legal writing and research skills through “real world” applications of national security law topics.\n\nDevelop a deeper understanding of the structure and function of legal advice or legal arguments.\n\nPractice techniques to more effectively edit and critique one’s own writing.\n\nProduce 1-2 pieces of writing that could be used as writing samples.\n\nPrerequisite: Legal Practice: Writing and Analysis.\n\nLAW 1532 v00 Advanced Legal Writing for International Business Lawyers\n\nJ.D. Seminar (cross-listed) | 2 credit hours\n\nThis course is designed to provide students interested in transactional practice with hands-on insight into the cross-border practice of business law by creating a simulated law-firm environment in which students are asked to complete tasks as if they were junior associates.\n\nThe principle objectives of the course are to teach students how to communicate clearly, concisely, and appropriately in a business-law setting, and how to apply and adapt these skills to situations involving international, cross-cultural, and even multinational business transactions. Students will practice these skills through a variety of written and oral communication exercises based on actual cross-border transactions similar to those they will likely encounter as a junior transactional associate at a law firm. The focus of this course will be on practical skills, rather than on theoretical analysis.\n\nAlthough some of our discussions and exercises will involve reviewing contract provisions and students will become familiar with basic contract structure, this is not a course on contract drafting. Rather, the focus is on developing the student’s practical lawyering skills such that he or she is able to effectively communicate with parties from all sides of a cross-border business transaction and to recognize and overcome the principle cultural, linguistic, and other barriers to cross-cultural communication.\n\nEnrollment by both JD and LL.M. students is encouraged. Class time generally will be split between lecturing and in-class exercises and discussion. The majority of the in-class exercises will utilize fact scenarios from actual deals and will involve students working in small groups or teams.\n\nPrerequisite: Legal Practice: Writing and Analysis.\n\nRecommended: Prior or concurrent enrollment in Corporations is recommended but not required.\n\nMutually Excluded Courses: Students may not receive credit for both this seminar and the Advanced Legal Writing Seminar, Advanced Legal Writing and Practice for Judicial Clerks and Civil Litigators, Advanced Legal Writing: Legal Writing as a Discipline, Advanced Legal Writing: Practical Skills from Retail Industry Examples, or Writing for Law Practice.\n\nNote: Students may request a withdrawal from an academic advisor through the due date of the final draft of Writing Project #2.\n\nLL.M. STUDENTS: THIS COURSE REQUIRES DEPARTMENTAL PERMISSION TO ENROLL. LL.M. students cannot register or put themselves on the waitlist for this course through MyAccess. Students interested in taking this course should send an e-mail to lawgradprog@georgetown.edu indicating their interest in the course and their previous exposure to U.S. legal writing by 5:00 pm on Tuesday, June 11, 2024.\n\nLAW 1798 v00 Advanced Legal Writing in Practice\n\nJ.D. Seminar | 3 credit hours\n\nThis seminar is designed to reinforce and build upon of the legal writing skills introduced in the first year Legal Practice class as well as to ensure mastery and develop efficiencies in terms of the legal writing process and product. The seminar will focus on efficient and effective prewriting techniques; will give students ample opportunity to hone their writing skills and, to a lesser extent, their research skills; will allow students to learn effective rewriting and revising techniques by participating in the commenting process; and will help students develop collaborative working skills.\n\nThe course will be run like a law firm, with students performing assignments for a supervising attorney. Over the course of the semester, the students will write at least three significant documents, with smaller interim writing assignments. The assignments will focus primarily on writing for a litigation practice, and may include inter-office memos or email memos, pleadings, briefs, client correspondence and advise letters, case and witness prep documents, and slide decks. Discussion topics will include litigation strategy, writing techniques, and professional demands and concerns. Students will have opportunities to work in teams, to strategize and write both individually and collaboratively, and to write as they will be expected to write in practice, including using email correspondence, preparing drafts for colleagues, and ultimately finalizing work product for a client and the court. At least one major assignment will be a collaborative assignment with a classmate. Professor DeLaurentis will guide the in-class discussions and provide individualized comments and grades on each major assignment.\n\nLAW 1895 v00 Advanced Legal Writing with Generative AI\n\nJ.D. Seminar | 1 credit hour\n\nGenerative Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI) is rapidly transforming the way we make decisions, conduct business, and express ourselves. It is likely to change how our students practice law when they enter the profession. At a minimum, as young lawyers they need to be familiar with this technology and its impact on the law. See ABA Model Rule 1.1., Comment 8, which requires lawyers to keep abreast of changes in the law and its practice, including the benefits and risks associated with relevant technology. In this new course, students will learn the fundamentals of Gen AI, discuss the risks and benefits of using Gen AI for legal writing, be introduced to ethical and legal issues surrounding Gen AI use in lawyering, and engage with tools and techniques for effectively using Gen AI. The core focus of this course is for students to practice using Gen AI and to develop best practices for using Gen AI in their legal writing.\n\nPrerequisite: Legal Practice: Writing and Analysis.\n\nMutually Excluded Courses: Students may not receive credit for this course and Gen AI and Big Law.\n\nNote: This course is offered on a mandatory pass/fail basis. This course does not count toward the seven credit pass/fail limit. This class will meet in Spring 2025 on the following dates: 1/15, 1/22, 1/29, 2/5, 2/12, 2/19 and 2/26.\n\nATTENDANCE IS MANDATORY AT ALL CLASS SESSIONS. Enrolled students must be in attendance at the start of the first class session in order to remain enrolled. Waitlisted students must be in attendance at the start of the first class session in order to remain eligible to be admitted off the waitlist. All enrolled students must attend each class session in its entirety. Failure to attend the first class session in its entirety will result in a drop; failure to attend any subsequent class session in its entirety may result in a withdrawal.\n\nLAW 1623 v00 Advanced Legal Writing: Intellectual Property and Technology Transactions\n\nJ.D. Seminar | 3 credit hours\n\nThis three-credit seminar offers an opportunity for J.D. students interested in transactional practice to hone their legal writing, negotiating, and real-world transactional skills in a small workshop environment. Students will review, write and analyze a variety of transactional documents – including full-length contracts, unique contractual provisions, and simulated client correspondence – and will develop individualized goals for improving their writing and transactional skills throughout the semester. While this course will teach drafting, deal-structuring, negotiation, and related skills that are generally applicable for any type of deal or transactional practice, it will focus on intellectual property and technology transactions and will teach those skills through a semester-long simulation based on a fictional startup company. The course will also focus on improving students' abilities to critically assess their own and others' legal writing and to provide helpful feedback to colleagues in a professional setting. Students will receive peer critique during most classes, as well as individualized feedback from the professor on most drafts of documents.\n\nProfessor permission is not required. Background in intellectual property or technology is not required.\n\nParticipation in the in-class exercises and simulations will be a key component of student evaluation.\n\nLearning Objectives:\n\nMy primary goal for the course is to give you real world transactional experience that you can use on day one out of law school. In addition, this course aims to expose you to new and emerging technologies and complex intellectual property licensing constructs, and give you the ability to analyze and negotiate different types of deals from both a legal and business perspective.\n\nPrerequisite: Legal Practice: Writing and Analysis or the equivalent first year legal writing course.\n\nMutually Excluded Courses: Students may not receive credit for both this course and Advanced Legal Writing: Transactional Practice or Information Technology Transactions: Strategy, Negotiations and Drafting.\n\nNote: Students may not withdraw from this class after the add/drop period ends without the permission of the professor.\n\nLAW 036 v05 Advanced Legal Writing: Legal Writing as a Discipline\n\nJ.D. Seminar | 2 credit hours\n\nThis seminar will focus on legal writing as a discipline. It will impart to students both the foundational and advanced tools to excel in all forms of legal writing and communication, from litigation briefs and judicial opinions to office memoranda and corporate documents. Through this seminar, students will gain a leg up in the marketplace, attaining a rare skill applicable to all types of legal positions.\n\nTo write and communicate effectively, attorneys must use language in a focused manner and make complicated information clear. This seminar will teach students how to master these skills. Students will learn how to draft both routine and complex legal documents by applying writing principles and techniques based on how readers process information most easily. The seminar will use a case problem with a federal constitutional issue. The first part of the seminar will focus on three overarching principles of the discipline of legal writing. It will involve brief writing assignments centered on each principle, based on the case problem. The second part of the seminar will apply the three principles to drafting and editing various legal documents common to many law practices.\n\nWhile each assignment will require individual writing, the seminar also will involve significant collaboration among students, primarily through weekly peer review and discussion. The instructor will provide individualized comments on each major assignment and evaluate students based on the assignments and participation.\n\nPrerequisite: Legal Practice: Writing and Analysis.\n\nMutually Excluded Courses: Students may not receive credit for both this seminar and the Advanced Legal Writing Seminar, Advanced Legal Writing and Practice for Judicial Clerks and Civil Litigators, Advanced Legal Writing: Practical Skills from Retail Industry Examples, Advanced Legal Writing for International Business Lawyers, or Writing for Law Practice.\n\nNote: THIS COURSE REQUIRES PROFESSOR PERMISSION TO ENROLL.\n\nLAW 1730 v00 Advanced Legal Writing: Practical Lawyering Skills and Strategies\n\nJ.D. Seminar | 3 credit hours\n\nThis three-credit seminar offers an opportunity for J.D. to hone their legal writing skills in a small workshop environment, while learning the skills and strategies of lawyers in practice. Students will represent a client in a simulated case, prepare relevant documents for their client, and discuss and debate relevant strategies. In addition, they will learn and participate in a number of in-class oral presentations related to the representation of the client. Students will build on skills in legal discourse introduced in the first year Legal Practice course, including crafting effective written analysis, understanding and meeting the expectations of the audience and the purpose of the projects, organizing documents to enhance clarity, and developing effective time management strategies. Students will learn to critically assess their own and others’ legal writing and to provide helpful feedback to colleagues in a professional setting. This course is designed as a workshop, with in-class and out-of-class writing and rewriting, in-class oral presentations, peer critique, individualized feedback from the professor, self-critique and reflection, and collaborative work.\n\nPrerequisite: Legal Practice: Writing and Analysis.\n\nNote: Laptop Policy: You are required to bring a fully powered laptop or tablet to class. We will be using the online text book, TeachingLaw.com, and doing substantial writing during class time.\n\nIn Fall 2024, this class will meet on 10/4 from 12:00 p.m. - 6:30 p.m. and 10/5, 10/6, 11/9, and 11/10 from 9:00 a.m. - 6:30 p.m. ATTENDANCE IS MANDATORY AT ALL CLASS SESSIONS. Enrolled students must be in attendance at the start of the first class session in order to remain enrolled. Waitlisted students must be in attendance at the start of the first class session in order to remain eligible to be admitted off the waitlist. All enrolled students must attend each class session in its entirety. Failure to attend the first class session in its entirety will result in a drop; failure to attend any subsequent class session in its entirety may result in a withdrawal. Enrolled students will have until the beginning of the second class session to request a drop by contacting the Office of the Registrar; a student who no longer wishes to remain enrolled after the second class session begins will not be permitted to drop the class but may request a withdrawal from an academic advisor in the Office of Academic Affairs. Withdrawals are permitted up until the last class for this specific course.\n\nLAW 363 v02 Advanced Mediation and Dispute Systems Design\n\nJ.D. Seminar | 3 credit hours\n\nThis seminar is an interactive workshop designed to introduce students to the theory, principles and practice of dispute systems design with the goal of training students to assume this new and creative professional role. Lawyers are increasingly being called upon to act not simply as litigators or deal-makers, but also as “process architects” for institutions, organizations and governments. In addition, they are being asked to design, tailor and manage systems to handle \"streams\" of disputes in an effective and efficient manner, such as those arising from commercial transactions, mass torts, natural disasters, government programs and restorative justice initiatives.\n\nThis course focuses on the study and practice of dispute systems design - understanding the structure and design choices made by, and the challenges presented to, organizations. This includes examination of court processes and other government or private systems for managing conflict. Dispute systems designers also develop and improve upon mediation and other alternative dispute resolution (ADR) service programs, as well as provide assessments of their appropriateness in various contexts. Knowledge and skills of dispute systems design are transferable to the emerging needs of practicing attorneys who are more and more frequently called upon as systems designers. Many lawyers, even if they never take the design initiative to lead a project, often serve as stakeholders and representatives of bar or professional associations recruited by systems designers to participate in the design process. This course also enhances the basic mediation and conflict management skills learned in other ADR related courses by application to the dispute system design framework.\n\nStudents will be expected to read, write, discuss, critique and participate in simulated exercises. After an overview of dispute systems design theory and principles, students will, through readings, discussions and exercises, study seven actual systems that reflect dispute systems design principles. Then through a series of additional hands-on role plays and simulations, students will have the opportunity to develop systems design skills and work on a mock consulting team during class. Simulations will lead students through the various stages or architecture of systems design, from taking design initiative through assessment, creating processes and systems and implementation. This course also focuses on advanced mediation and dispute systems design topics, including recent developments in neuroscience and their potential impact on dispute resolution, choice architecture and “nudge” principles, the impact of mediator orientations on program design, restorative justice practices, and transformative mediation. The practical and ethical implications of systems design work will also be explored, as well as opportunities for synthesis of systems design skills into legal practice.\n\nThe course meets over two weekends (Friday afternoon through Sunday). Due to the intensive and interactive nature of the seminar, attendance at all class sessions is mandatory. Grades will be based on class participation including teamwork, discussions and simulations (25%), the quality of a 6-page journal analyzing a class consulting team simulation and applying dispute systems design principles (25%), and a 14-page client proposal on a topic of the student's choice (revising a current system or designing a new system to resolve disputes) which demonstrates application and mastery of dispute systems design knowledge and skills (50%).\n\nPrerequisite: A law school skills-based class on negotiation or mediation is required, such as Negotiations Seminar; Mediation Seminar; Mediation Advocacy Seminar; Negotiations and Mediation Seminar; or Multiparty Negotiation, Groups Decision Making and Teams. The two-credit sections of International Negotiations Seminar do not satisfy the prerequisite for this class.\n\nNote: This seminar is open to J.D. students only.\n\nATTENDANCE IS MANDATORY AT ALL CLASS SESSIONS.

Course (cross-listed) | 1 credit hour\n\nIn a significant minority of public corporations, a single person or entity has the power to choose the directors of the corporation and determine the outcome of stockholder votes. Many private corporations operate with this governance profile. Corporations fitting this profile are described as “controlled.”\n\nIn the standard model of the corporation, the power to direct and oversee the business and affairs of the entity rests with the board of directors, who are obligated as fiduciaries to act in the best interests of the company and its stockholders. When a party other than the board of directors has the ability to control the corporation, it upsets the standard model, with knock-on effects for a variety of corporate doctrines.\n\nThis course examines the nature of control and its implications. In addition to covering these issues in the context of public companies, the course will examine their implications for privately held companies and touch on their application to alternative entities.\n\nCourse enrollment is limited to 32. Students are expected to possess a basic understanding of the law applicable to alternative entities and corporations. An introductory course in corporations or business associations is a prerequisite.\n\nLearning Objectives:\n\nAfter taking this course, students will understand the following topics:\n\nWhat constitutes control? What are the different types of control and what factors contribute to its existence?\n\nWhat fiduciary duties do controllers owe? When and why do they arise?\n\nHow does the presence of a controller affect corporate doctrines such as the standard of review, demand futility, and ratification?\n\nWhat devices can be used to mitigate the effects of control, such as special committees, majority-of-the-minority votes, and enhanced-independence directors?\n\nWhat are the implications of particular methods of maintaining control, with particularly emphasis on the currently trending device of dual class stock?\n\nPrerequisite: Corporations.\n\nNote: ATTENDANCE IS MANDATORY AT ALL CLASS SESSIONS. Enrolled students must be in attendance at the start of the first class session in order to remain enrolled. Waitlisted students must be in attendance at the start of the first class session in order to remain eligible to be admitted off the waitlist.

Course (cross-listed) | 1 credit hour\n\nThis course will explore corporate litigation in the Court of Chancery in the context of mergers, acquisitions, and other transactional structures.\n\nThe course is divided into three parts. Part I will begin with a discussion of Delaware’s place in the world of corporate litigation. This will include the mechanics of initiating a lawsuit to challenge a deal, together with the Court’s role in resolving preliminary and logistical issues, before turning to the substantive law governing motions for expedition and motions for preliminary or permanent injunctive relief. Finally, we will discuss the section 220 actions for accessing corporate books and records.\n\nPart II will focus on corporate litigation, in theory and in practice. We will discuss structural matters relating to where to file and who represents a class in competing lawsuits, and focus a significant amount of our time on recent changes in corporate litigation following Corwin. Then we'll turn to other key issues in stockholder derivative litigation relating to the board of directors.\n\nIn Part III, we will discuss non-stockholder M&A litigation of two categories trending in different directions on the Delaware dockets: appraisal and material adverse effect (or material adverse change) litigation.\n\nWhile the class is divided into three parts, we may cover more or less than a single part on each of the three class days.\n\nIn addition to reading cases, students will be asked to read parts of briefs actually filed in Delaware corporate litigation. Selected students will be assigned to (informally) argue the briefed issues as assigned. Following in-class argument, we will discuss the outcome of the actual ligation.\n\nBy the end of this course, students will be familiar with the common issues arising in corporate transactional litigation; which actions may be brought directly and which must be pursued derivatively; which are statutory and which arise under the common law; and what current “hot” corporate litigation issues are currently being litigated in Delaware.\n\nPrerequisite: Corporations.\n\nNote: ATTENDANCE IS MANDATORY AT ALL CLASS SESSIONS. Enrolled students must be in attendance at the start of the first class session in order to remain enrolled.

Course (cross-listed) | 1 credit hour\n\nThrough the lens of Delaware law, this course will review the roles of the board of directors, senior officers, and stockholders in overseeing a corporation, monitoring management conduct, and promoting compliance. The course will consider the director’s duty of oversight, its origins, and how it has evolved. The course will examine whether senior officers owe a similar duty of oversight, or whether different duties apply. We will delve deeply into the derivative action, which is the primary enforcement mechanism through which stockholders can address management misconduct. As part of this effort, we will explore the various stages of the derivative action and consider its strengths and weaknesses.\n\nAs its source materials, the course will examine recent derivative lawsuits.\n\nCourse enrollment is limited to 35. Students are expected to possess a basic understanding of the law applicable to alternative entities and corporations. An introductory course in corporations is a prerequisite.\n\nLearning Objectives:\n\nAfter taking this course, students will be able to answer the following questions:\n\nWhat standards apply to a board and senior officers when overseeing a corporation, monitoring for misconduct, and promoting compliance?\n\nWhat is the duty of oversight, how did it arise, and how has it evolved?\n\nWhat is the nature of a stockholder derivative action, the various stages of the proceeding, and its strengths and weaknesses?\n\nAre stockholder derivative actions an effective way of policing management misconduct? Is the Delaware corporate model particularly prone to management misconduct?\n\nCan a corporation serve morally good ends?\n\nPrerequisite: Corporations.\n\nNote: ATTENDANCE IS MANDATORY AT ALL CLASS SESSIONS.

Students will gain hands-on experience practicing technology advocacy. The course first reviews key issues in technology policy and advocacy, such as competition, content moderation, net neutrality, privacy, AI & bias, and cybersecurity.\n\nArmed with the basics of current technology policy issues, students then learn advocacy tools to “make” technology policy. Students will review and draft collateral materials used for technology policy advocacy, including white papers, talking points, comments, “op/eds,” earned media coverage, and more, gaining an appreciation for the differences from, and complementary relationship with, traditional legal materials and legal practice. Students will be introduced to the legislative process (committee hearings and markups, bicameral action, budget procedure); independent agency rulemaking and adjudication (comments, ex parte presentations, Administration and congressional input); relevant enforcement proceedings (Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission merger review); and related advocacy in the courts (amicus briefs).\n\nThis is a skill-intensive course with writing assignments, workshops, presentations, peer support, and simulations. It will have a final assessment with a written and oral component. There are no prerequisite courses required. Classes will incorporate pre-class preparations and in-class skill-building exercises.\n\nMutually Excluded Courses: Students may not receive credit for both this course and Technology Policy and Practice.\n\nNote: This course is only open to LL.M students admitted into the LL.M in Technology Law & Policy program or the Master of Law and Technology program.\n\nLAW 127 v00 Advocacy Tools for Public Interest Lawyers\n\nJ.D.

Seminar | 1 credit hour\n\nThrough role plays set in the context of interaction with clients, fact-finding, negotiation, litigation, and transactional work, this Week One simulation course will teach first-year students how ethics issues arise in practice and how lawyers may run afoul of rules that govern professional responsibility. During the course’s four days, students will be involved in one or more of the following matters:\n\nA court sanctions hearing relating to allegations of abuses in civil discovery;\n\nA disciplinary hearing considering conflict of interest claims against in-house counsel because of her alleged representation of both a university and its president during a criminal investigation;\n\nA simulation of interaction with clients and negotiations relating to the sale of a helicopter;\n\nA simulation of an internal law firm investigation of alleged associate and partner abuses in billing.\n\nIn each of these situations, students, working in teams and in various roles will be assigned responsibility for meeting with clients, fact-finding—reviewing documents and interviewing prospective witnesses, researching pertinent ethics rules, engaging in negotiations, and making arguments either in a court or disciplinary hearing setting. Through these role-playing assignments, students will learn how to analyze rules of professional conduct, engage in fact-finding, and serve as advocates in various settings. Upper-class teaching fellows will serve as clients, potential witnesses, and decision-makers in the disciplinary setting.\n\nNote: This course does NOT meet the J.D. Professional Responsibility graduation requirement. For a list of the PR series courses, please see the Legal Profession/Professional Responsibility cluster essay.\n\nThis course is mandatory pass/fail, and does NOT count against the 7-credit pass/fail limit for J.D. students. This optional, elective course is for first-year J.D. students only. Details regarding the registration process will be provided to students during the fall semester via email, information sessions, and on the Week One website.
