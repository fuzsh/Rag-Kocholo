        "text": "The political and social upheaval\n\nthat resulted from the English Civil War in the seventeenth century [effectively\n\ntwo conflicts between 1642 -1646 and 1647/48] led to the development of a set of radical ideas centred around\n\nmovements known as ‘Diggers’ and ‘Levellers’\n\nThe Diggers [or ‘True Levellers’] were led by William Everard\n\nwho had served in the New Model Army. As the name implies, the diggers aimed\n\nto use the earth to reclaim the freedom that they felt had been lost partly\n\nthrough the Norman Conquest; by seizing the land and owning it ‘in common’\n\nthey would challenge what they considered to be the slavery of property. They\n\nwere opposed to the use of force and believed that they could create a classless\n\nsociety simply through seizing land and holding it in the ‘common good’.\n\nTo this end, a small group [initially 12, though rising to 50] settled on\n\ncommon land first at St George’s Hill and later in Cobham, Surrey and\n\ngrew corn and other crops. This small group defied the landlords, the Army\n\nand the law for over a year. In addition to this, groups travelled through\n\nEngland attempting to rally supporters. In this they had some successes in\n\nKent and Northamptonshire. Their main propagandist was Gerard Winstanley who\n\nproduced the clearest statement of Digger ideas in ‘The Law of Freedom\n\nin a Platform’ published in 1652. This was a defence and exposition\n\nof the notion of a classless society based in secularism and radical democracy\n\nThe relatively small group of followers of Digger ideas was never particularly\n\ninfluential and was quite easily suppressed by Cromwell and Fairfax.\n\nThe most significant of these movements were The Levellers whose revolutionary\n\nideas resonated throughout the succeeding centuries, mostly notably in the\n\ndemands of the Chartists in the nineteenth century.\n\nThe Levellers’ ideas found most support in the ranks of the ’New\n\nModel Army’, formed by Oliver Cromwell in 1645 and were largely responsible\n\nfor the defeat of the Royalist forces led by Charles I, particularly in the\n\ndecisive Battle of Naseby in June 1645.\n\nBy the end of the first civil war in 1646 Leveller ideas were particularly\n\ninfluential and culminated in the Putney Debates where ordinary soldiers debated\n\nrevolutionary ideas with their generals; it was at this series of meetings\n\nthat Leveller Colonel Thomas Rainborough argued the case for universal suffrage:\n\n“I think that the poorest he that is in England hath a life to live\n\nas the greatest he, and therefore truly, sir, I think it is clear to every\n\nman that is to live under a government ought first by his own consent to put\n\nhimself under that government.”\n\nUnfortunately, this outbreak of democracy within the ranks of the army was\n\nrelatively short-lived; the outbreak of the second civil war in 1647 allowed\n\nthe generals to reassert their authority and Leveller influence began to wane.\n\nAn attempted mutiny by Leveller soldiers was brutally suppressed in Burford,\n\nOxfordshire in 1649; leaders were executed by Cromwell’s soldiers and\n\nothers were tried for high treason.\n\nWhy this brutal suppression? What did the generals find so threatening about\n\nthe Levellers?\n\nWho were the Levellers?\n\nThe Levellers were a relatively loose alliance of radicals and freethinkers\n\nwho came to prominence during the period of instability that characterised\n\nthe English Civil War of 1642 – 1649. The most prominent Levellers were\n\nJohn Lilburne, Richard Overton, William Walwyn, John Wildman, Edward Sexby\n\nand Colonel Thomas Rainborough.\n\nWhat bound these people together was the general belief that all men were\n\nequal; since this was the case, then a government could only have legitimacy\n\nif it was elected by the people. The Leveller demands were for a secular republic,\n\nabolition of the House of Lords, equality before the law, the right to vote\n\nfor all, free trade, the abolition of censorship, freedom of speech and the\n\nabsolute right for people to worship whatever religion [or none] that they\n\nchose. This programme was published as ‘The Agreement of the People’.\n\nThese ideas came out of the social classes from which the Levellers originated;\n\nthey were mainly skilled workers and peasants and the ‘petty bourgeoisie’.\n\nSince many of them had fought in Cromwell’s New Model Army they were\n\nused to discussion, argument and the free dissemination of ideas; it was this\n\nintelligent debate allied to the need for discipline that had led to the defeat\n\nof the Royalists and the victory of the republic.\n\nThe Levellers were essentially radical idealists; their demands could be seen\n\nas a form of early socialism [they were pretty much the same as the demands\n\nof the Chartists some two hundred years later], but they had little or no\n\nunderstanding of the workings of a capitalist economy. It is unfair, though,\n\nto expect this of them since capitalism as an organised form of social production\n\nwould only assert itself much later in the development of Britain as an industrial\n\nnation.\n\nIndeed, it is important to note that their views on the social order were\n\nnot particularly progressive; these were rooted in the notion that prior to\n\n1066 and the Norman Conquest a democratic society had existed in Anglo-Saxon\n\ntimes where the land was held in common by the people [perhaps this is in\n\nline with Karl Marx’s idea of the concept of ‘primitive communism’;\n\nthat is, the form of social organisation that existed in pre-industrial society].\n\nThe victory of William the Conqueror in 1066 had enabled him to impose a form\n\nof foreign [that is, Norman] domination on the people. [1] This enabled him\n\nto reward his followers with huge swathes of land seized from the formerly\n\n‘free men’ of England. This was particularly so in the North of\n\nEngland where opposition was brutally suppressed.\n\nThe Levellers argued that since God had created all men as equals, the land\n\nbelonged to all the people as a right. Their programme was, then, essentially\n\nan attempt to restore the situation that they believed had existed previous\n\nto the Norman Conquest; they wanted to establish a ‘commonwealth’\n\nin which the common people would be in control of their own destiny without\n\nthe intervention of a King, a House of Lords and other potential oppressors.\n\nThe Agreement of the People was drawn up by a committee of Levellers including\n\nJohn Lilburne which was to have been discussed at a meeting of the commonwealth\n\narmies at Newmarket in June 1647. In brief this is what they asked for:\n\n· Power to be vested in the people\n\n· One year Parliaments, elected by equal numbers of voters per seat.\n\nThe right to vote for all men who worked independently for their living and\n\nall those who had fought for the Parliamentary cause\n\n· Recall of any or all of their MPs by their electors at any time\n\n· Abolition of the House of Lords\n\n· Democratic election of army officers\n\n· Complete religious toleration and the abolition of tithes and tolls\n\n· Justices to be elected; law courts to be local and proceedings to\n\nbe in English [not French!]\n\n· Redistribution of seized land to the common people\n\n\"[T]here had never been anything like such a spontaneous outbreak of\n\ndemocracy in any English or Continental Army before this year of 1647, nor\n\nwas there anything like it thereafter till Workers’ and Soldiers’\n\nCouncils met in 1917 in Russia\" [2]\n\nIt is hardly surprising, given this programme of demands,\n\nthat the rich and powerful felt threatened by the Levellers. This is particularly\n\nso, given that some of the Leveller demands, almost 400 years on, have still\n\nnot been met! Since Leveller demands went so much further than Cromwell and\n\nother republican leaders could even begin to meet, then they had to be crushed.\n\nThe outbreak of the second civil war gave them the opportunity to do this\n\nand so the movement which would have surely rid the people of the parasitical\n\nclasses once and for all was brutally put down.\n\nThe final victory of the Parliamentary forces later in 1648 not only led to\n\nthe execution of the King, but also the suppression of Leveller ideas for\n\na time.\n\nLeveller ideas, though, posed a real challenge to the power and authority\n\nof Cromwell particularly with their attitude to the situation in Ireland.\n\nThe New Model Army had been set up to defend Parliament at home, not to act\n\nas a mercenary force which would advance the imperialist ambitions of the\n\nEnglish ruling class. The Catholics in Ireland, it was argued, had a claim\n\nto freedom and equality which was just as valid as that which the Levellers\n\nwere arguing for at home.\n\nIn ‘The English Soldier’s Standard’, it was argued that\n\nmilitary intervention in Ireland would only mean that the Irish would become\n\na subject people exploited by precisely those who the Levellers were struggling\n\nto overcome in England. The point was that influential levellers were implacably\n\nopposed to the reconquest of Ireland.\n\nWhen significant elements of the New Model Army refused to embark for Ireland\n\nit was obvious that a crucial point had been reached. Radical elements had\n\nto be crushed in order for Cromwell to assert his authority. This was achieved\n\nat Burford in Oxfordshire where Fairfax and Cromwell surprised the Levellers\n\nand defeated them [albeit it with only a handful of casualties]. From this\n\ntime [May 1649] the New Model Army was completely in the control of Cromwell.\n\nThis does not mean, though, that Leveller ideas were totally eradicated. On\n\nMay Day 1649, the third and final version of the ‘Agreement of the People’\n\nwas published. This is the last collective statement of the Leveller leaders\n\nand is their most complete political programme. Its preface stated:\n\n“Peace and freedom is our design; by war we were never gainers,\n\nnor ever wish to be.”\n\nIn this version of the Agreement, there is a restatement of essential Leveller\n\nideas, though there is a divergence between them and the aims of the Diggers\n\nto eradicate the ownership of private property. In all other respects, the\n\nprogramme is not dissimilar to earlier versions; the emphasis is still on\n\nuniversal [male] suffrage, accountable government, religious toleration, civil\n\nrights, and so on.\n\nLeveller ideas mainly appealed to the dispossessed in society; that is, those\n\nwho were most threatened by what the Levellers were proposing were unlikely\n\nto be persuaded by appeals to the ‘common good’. Since the Levellers\n\nwere unable to mobilise their followers to any great degree and, given their\n\ndefeat at Burford, they lacked the ability to challenge the army or government,\n\nit is almost inevitable that they were unable to pose any future threat to\n\nthe ruling class or [restored] Monarchy.\n\nNevertheless, this is not to say that Leveller ideas are irrelevant or were\n\nconsigned to the ‘dustbin of history’. Both the Levellers and\n\nDiggers are of crucial importance to the development of working class history\n\nsince they stand in the proud tradition of English radicalism and challenge\n\nto the ruling orthodoxy.\n\nLike the Tolpuddle Martyrs and the Chartists of a later period, the Diggers\n\nand Levellers posed a serious threat to the ruling class; their direct appeals\n\nto the poor and dispossessed resonate throughout the centuries – whilst\n\nthe language and mode of expression may have changed, the essential demands\n\nof these radicals remain as vibrant and necessary today as they were when\n\nthey were first put.\n\nSome 450 years after the Diggers established their commune at Cobham, we still\n\nneed to establish the common ownership of property and the development of\n\nsociety based on need, rather than profit. The words of Winstanley echo throughout\n\nthe centuries:\n\n“When men take to buying and selling the land, saying ’This\n\nis mine’, they restrain other fellow creatures from seeking nourishment\n\nfrom mother earth…..so that he that had no land was to work for those,\n\nfor small wages, that called the land theirs; and thereby some are lifted\n\nup into the chair of tyranny and others trod under the footstool of misery,\n\nas if the earth were made for a few and not for all men.”\n\nOur task must to be rescue the words of the Diggers and Levellers from obscurity\n\nand to locate them quite firmly in the context of working-class history and\n\nstruggle; to seek inspiration from their words and actions; to ensure that\n\nall of these disparate voices are united under the common theme of working\n\nclass resistance to poverty and oppression\n\nJim Fox\n\nFrom Revolutions Per Minute"
