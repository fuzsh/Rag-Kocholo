An occupational licensing board that is provided access to the database pursuant to this section may access the database to investigate a complaint, report or other information that indicates fraudulent, illegal, unauthorized or otherwise inappropriate activity related to the prescribing, dispensing or use of a controlled substance. The Board may terminate the access of an occupational licensing board that accesses the database for any other purpose.\n\n2. The Board and the Division must have access to the program established pursuant to NRS 453.162 to identify any suspected fraudulent, illegal, unauthorized or otherwise inappropriate activity related to the prescribing, dispensing or use of controlled substances.\n\n3.

Except as otherwise provided in subsection 1, the occupational licensing board may access the database of the program established pursuant to NRS 453.162 to determine which practitioners are prescribing the controlled substance to the patient. The occupational licensing board may use this information for any purpose it deems necessary, including, without limitation, alerting a practitioner that a patient may be fraudulently obtaining a controlled substance or determining whether a practitioner is engaged in unlawful or unprofessional conduct.\n\n4. The Board or Division may withhold any report required by subsection 3 if the Board determines that doing so is necessary to avoid interfering with any pending administrative or criminal investigation into the suspected fraudulent, illegal, unauthorized or otherwise inappropriate prescribing, dispensing or use of a controlled substance.\n\n5. The Board and the Division shall cooperatively develop a course of training for persons who are required or authorized to receive access to the database of the program pursuant to subsection 7 or NRS 453.1645 and 453.165 and require each such person to complete the course of training before the person is provided with Internet access to the database.\n\n6. Each practitioner who is authorized to write prescriptions for and each person who is authorized to dispense controlled substances listed in schedule II, III, IV or V for human consumption shall complete the course of instruction described in subsection 5.

The Board shall register an applicant to dispense controlled substances included in schedules I to V, inclusive, unless it determines that the issuance of that registration would be inconsistent with the public interest. In determining the public interest, the Board shall consider the following factors:\n\n(a) Maintenance of effective controls against diversion of controlled substances into other than legitimate medical, scientific, research or industrial channels;\n\n(b) Compliance with state and local law;\n\n(c) Promotion of technical advances in the art of manufacturing controlled substances and the development of new substances;\n\n(d) Convictions of the applicant pursuant to laws of another country or federal or state laws relating to a controlled substance;\n\n(e) Past experience of the applicant in the manufacture or distribution of controlled substances, and the existence in the applicants establishment of effective controls against diversion of controlled substances into other than legitimate medical, scientific research or industrial channels;\n\n(f) Furnishing by the applicant of false or fraudulent material in an application filed pursuant to the provisions of NRS 453.011 to 453.552, inclusive;\n\n(g) Suspension or revocation of the applicants federal registration to manufacture, distribute, possess, administer or dispense controlled substances as authorized by federal law; and\n\n(h) Any other factors relevant to and consistent with the public health and safety.\n\n2.

The Board may limit revocation or suspension of a registration to the particular controlled substance with respect to which grounds for revocation or suspension exist.\n\n3. If a registration is suspended or revoked, the Board may place under seal all controlled substances owned or possessed by the registrant at the time of suspension or the effective date of the revocation. No disposition may be made of substances under seal until the time for taking an appeal has elapsed or until all appeals have been concluded unless a court, upon application therefor, orders the sale of perishable substances and the deposit of the proceeds of the sale with the court. When a revocation becomes final, the court may order the controlled substances forfeited to the State.\n\n4. The Board may seize or place under seal any controlled substance owned or possessed by a registrant whose registration has expired or who has ceased to practice or do business in the manner permitted by the registration.

The Board may suspend, before the hearing, any registration with the institution of proceedings under NRS 453.236, or where renewal of registration is refused, if it finds that there is an imminent danger to the public health or safety which warrants this action. The suspension continues in effect until the conclusion of the proceedings, including judicial review thereof, unless sooner withdrawn by the Board or dissolved by a court of competent jurisdiction. In the event of such a suspension the Board shall conduct a hearing at the earliest possible date, but in any event, the hearing must be conducted no later than 15 days after the date of suspension unless a continuance is requested by the registrant or the registrant otherwise prevents the holding of the hearing.\n\n(Added to NRS by 1971, 2011; A 1977, 73; 1979, 1664; 1991, 1657)\n\nNRS 453.246 Recordkeeping and inventory requirements for registrants.
