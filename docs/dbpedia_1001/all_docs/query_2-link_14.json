        "text": "A portrait of Odilia van Wassenaar (Fig. 3) shows that these new styles extended even to the Netherlands, which had long lagged in adopting European dress trends. But, as Daniel Delis Hill notes in his History of World Costume and Fashion (2011): “The last of the cartwheel ruffs finally vanished by the 1650s even in Holland and Germany” (411). Van Wassenaar wears the long, pointed bodice that gives her torso an elongated look; it would have been worn over a simple chemise (called a smock or shift in England). The bodice itself was boned in this period so no additional stays or corset needed to be worn. Skirts were full, featuring many cartridge pleats at the waist to create the volume—this can be seen in the portraits of both Parmentier and van Wassenaar (Figs. 2-3). These skirts were separate from the bodice and hung naturally from the waist without rigid understructures like the farthingales seen in the 16th century, though a bum roll would often be tied on to create a bit of fullness and attractively set off the narrow waist.\n\nWhile the upper torso appeared rigid, the lower half was more fluid in strong contrast to the fashions in 1650s Spain, where the farthingale was still worn at court. As Velázquez’s portrait of the Infanta Maria Teresa (Fig. 4) attests, the farthingale in this period had become very elliptical, creating an incredibly wide silhouette; the bodice now extended down over the farthingale in a large peplum. Maria Teresa in 1660 will undergo a dramatic style transformation when she marries King Louis XIV and becomes Queen Consort of France, adopting French-style dress.\n\nIndeed, France dominates fashion in the second half of the 17th century—a leadership they would retain in womenswear arguably up to the present day. England was in no position to challenge them as “about 1650 … Puritan styles, already worn among the middle classes, were imposed on society at large by the austere government of Cromwell” (Boucher 273). In a portrait of Jeanne de Marigny (Fig. 5), we see the same pointed bodice and short, off-the-shoulder sleeves adopted in Sweden; as Millia Davenport notes in The Book of Costume (1948): “The neckline of the bodice becomes wider, more horizontal and tends to slip off the shoulders.” (519) But in France the lace at the neckline and cuffs has been abandoned in favor of nearly translucent gauzy fabric: “a simple swathe of linen along the necklines marks the move away from heavy lace collars” (Cumming 88).\n\nMary Stuart, Princess Royal and Princess of Orange, dresses in her 1640s style [see “Fashion Icon” section below] in a portrait by Gerrit van Honthorst (Fig. 6), but soon adopted these new French style trends (her mother, Henrietta Maria, was French—see “Fashion Icon” in the 1630-1639 overview). Note the small dog in the portrait, which became a common companion in female portraits of this period (see also Figs. 1, 3, 14). In this case the dog has added significance as it’s a “King Charles spaniel…a favourite breed of Charles II and his sister Henrietta Anne, and became almost symbolic of that generation of Stuarts” (Mould).\n\nA later portrait thought to be of Mary (Fig. 7) shows her now with the same gauzy fabric edging the neckline of her very low-cut bodice, which comes to a point in the front, just as de Marigny’s does (Fig. 5). Also as Valerie Cumming notes in A Visual History of Costume: The Seventeenth Century (1984): “The rigid line of the bodice was softened by fuller sleeves in the 1650s,” as in this portrait (88). Note that the sheer fabric is pinned to the center front of the bodice with a jeweled brooch as was common at the time; another example can be seen in the portrait of Elisabeth van Nassau-Beverweerd (Fig. 8).\n\nAs discussed above, bodices and skirts were separate in this period and so didn’t always need to coordinate, though they typically did in portraiture. A genre scene by Gerard ter Borch the Younger (Fig. 9) shows us a young Dutch woman in a pink skirt paired with a cream bodice with the sleeves attached via green ribbons. Her hair is up in a simple cap. The side view offered allows us to just make out that her bodice is laced up the back, as indeed all these boned bodices were in the period.\n\nRibbon embellishments were becoming more and more popular for men’s and women’s wear as can be seen in the portrait of Beata Elisabeth von Königsmarck (Fig. 10). Her silver satin bodice has decorative blue-ribbon closures along the center front, which coordinates with the blue scarf that edges her neckline and similar ribbons gathering her full sleeves at the elbow.\n\nIn England, styles of the 1640s continued as in Joan Carlile’s portrait of an unknown woman (Fig. 11)—Carlile is notable as one of the first British women artists to paint professionally in oil. The shimmering off-the-shoulder satin bodice is extremely low-cut, and she holds a sheer scarf in her right hand. The portrait is somewhat unusual in that it reflects the rigid line fashionable at the time; it had become quite common to be painted instead in classicized, draped versions of informal dress of the day. Dutch painter Peter Lely specialized in this sort of drapery painting and produced countless versions of it for British aristocrats (Figs. 12-14).\n\nLely’s portrait of Elizabeth Murray, Lady Tollemache (Fig. 12) depicts her in a brown satin gown that mimics the lines of fashionable dress, but softens them, with no boning apparent in the bodice. She is perhaps meant to be wearing a nightgown, an informal, comfortable style of dress worn without stays (though not worn to sleep in), here accessorized with a blue satin scarf wrapped around her shoulders. Notably Lely depicts a young black servant, whose identity is now lost, alongside Murray, proffering her a platter of roses. The servant is dressed in a blousy striped shirt and wears a prominent large pearl earring in his left ear. It’s possible the young man is a slave as slavery was technically legal in England until 1772, though Britain also had long had a small free black population. It became quite common to feature black slaves or servants alongside white women in 17th-century portraiture (see another example in the “Fashion Icon” section below and in subsequent decade overviews).\n\nMary Stuart was the eldest daughter of King Charles I of England and Henrietta Maria of France. She was the first to hold the title of Princess Royal. She became Countess of Nassau upon her marriage to William II of Orange, when she was nine and he was fifteen. Three years later, in 1644, she moved to the Netherlands. According to the National Portrait Gallery, “Mary was distinguished as a young girl for her intelligence and beauty.”\n\nIn 1647 after his father’s death, William II became the stadholder; a portrait from that same year shows the teenage couple (Fig. 1) with Mary in a bright yellow satin dress with low-cut bodice and full, elbow-length sleeves. The dress was either popular with Mary or with portraitists as she was also painted in a green (Fig. 2) and red version (see Fig. 6 above).\n\nTragically William II, only 24 years old, died of smallpox in November 1650 and the couple’s only child, Willem, was born a few days later. Mary, now a widow at age 19, became Dowager Princess of Orange and co-regent for her son, who had immediately become Prince of Orange as his father was dead. She would serve as co-regent until 1660.\n\nA 1652 portrait depicts her as Princess of Orange and widow of William II (Fig. 3). As the Rijks Museum explains:\n\n“White is the colour of mourning for people of royal blood. Mary was already a widow by the time she turned 19. Her husband, the Stadtholder William II, died in 1650 of smallpox. Two years later she had herself portrayed as his widow, holding an orange in her hand as a reference to the House of Orange. At the left is the stadtholders’ gate of the Binnenhof with a view of The Hague.”\n\nThe dress has the fashionable pointed bodice of the 1650s and the transparent gauzy scarf pinned at the neckline then at the height of fashion. While Mary was reportedly frustrated that as a widow she could not dance at parties, she did apparently enjoy dressing up in costume as a remarkable 1655 portrait (Fig. 4) records (Brown). The Royal Collection Trust explains: “It was perhaps painted to record the Princess’s appearance at an entertainment in The Hague early in 1655, where she appeared ‘very well dressed, like an Amazon.’”\n\nThe red feathered cloak was likely Brazilian in origin as Brazil was a Dutch colony at the time as the Trust details: “In the seventeenth century such cloaks were worn by Indians living in the North-East of Brazil.” The elaborately feathered and pearl-draped turban is likely intended to enhance the “exotic” character of the dress but has no known association with Brazil. The white satin dress she wears beneath the cloak closely resembles the one worn in the van Honthorst portrait discussed above (Fig. 7 above). She seems to have favored French fashions and visited Paris and her mother Henrietta Maria in 1656 to great success; according to Rebecca Starr Brown:\n\n“Mary arrived decked out in her finest jewels and gowns, to the point that it garnered raised eyebrows from her mother, who stated her daughter ‘is not like me; she is very lofty with her ideas, with her jewels and her money. She likes splendour.’”\n\nThis seems somewhat disingenuous as Henrietta Maria had dressed quite splendidly in her time as queen [see “Fashion Icon” of 1630-1639].\n\nMary was only 24 and impressed the French with her beauty and fashionability; with one courtier remarking: “The Princess of Orange outshone all our ladies, although the Court was never more crowded with handsome women” (Brown).\n\nShe lived to see her brother Charles II restored to the throne and declared King of England, reuniting with him, her siblings and mother in London in 1660. Unfortunately, she contracted smallpox and died shortly after arriving in England at only age 29. Thus, she did not live to see her son Willem become William III, King of England, in the so-called Glorious Revolution of 1688 (which ousted her Catholic brother James II in favor of her Protestant son).\n\nA posthumous portrait in 1664 depicted her yet again in her Brazilian feather cloak, but now with a black servant or slave with large pearl earring alongside her attaching a pearl bracelet to her wrist. There is no information as to the man’s identity, but he could be meant to represent the increasing Dutch presence in Africa, where they were heavily involved in the Atlantic slave trade. Sheldon Cheek, assistant director of the Image of the Black Archive & Library at Harvard University’s Hutchins Center, explains:\n\n“Slavery was technically illegal in the Netherlands at this time, as it was throughout Europe, but the situation was still porous… Often, Africans would be brought into the Netherlands by means of the Dutch slave trade, presented as ‘gifts’ to the wealthy.” (Cook)\n\nAs the portrait was painted four years after her death, it’s not clear whether it reflects Mary’s actual household. While at the time he would have been seen merely as a sign of colonial success and as a fashionable accessory to the scene (see Fig. 12 above), today the man’s presence is a powerful reminder of the human suffering that made such fashionability and magnificence possible."
