Yet the year 1949 represented only the military victory of the CCP, and in the following decades the new rulers of China would attempt to recreate state and society on a previously unimaginable scale. This course explores the dramatic years following the establishment of the PRC and follows the mass campaigns and political upheavals that marked Chinese history under the rule of the Communist Party. Attention will be given to both mass movements in the countryside and events that largely affected urban dwellers and intellectuals. Overall, this course aims at understanding the large-scale structural changes of the revolutionary era of 1949 to 1976 and its aftermath, as well as what these changes meant for the lives of individual Chinese citizens.\n\nHISC 6310 China in Revolution, 1900-1949\n\nChina's twentieth century was irrevocably and profoundly marked by the Chinese Revolution. But how are historians to define the Chinese Revolution, both in setting its temporal boundaries and interpreting the meaning behind the event? Is it possible to determine the causes of the Revolution, or to elucidate why it took the path that it did? What did the Revolution mean for different social groups, as well as the individual? This course, an intensive reading seminar, is designed to address these issues by engaging a wide range of scholarship. Key topics include the legacy of the Republican Era, the rise of the Chinese Communist Party, land reform, and the impact of the revolutionary era on the lives of women.\n\nHISC 6410 Empire and Rebellion in China\n\nDuring the Ming and Oing dynasties, Chinese emperors faced the enormous challenge of maintaining control over a vast and populous polity. This seminar will explore the methods utilized in the late imperial age to control the populace. These methods-most notably the state, legal, and family systems-were never fully effective in enforcing the will of dynastic rulers. As such, we will also investigate the possibilities for resistance against imperial rule and the Confucian worldview. While control and resistance will be the main themes for this seminar, other topics such as the roles of the environment and identity in history will add to our understanding of the late imperial age. Please note that this is a reading and writing intensive course that will rely heavily on the peer-review process.\n\nHISC 6510 Imperialism in East Asia\n\nDespite a continuing debate over the exact definition of imperialism, there is no doubt that this phenomenon looms large in the history of modern East Asia. This course explores unequal power relations between nation-states, not only between Europe and Asia, but within East Asia itself. Please note that this is an intensive seminar, with equal emphasis on reading, writing, and in-class discussion.\n\nHISC 6610 Seminar on Modern Japan\n\nJapan's rapid transformation from a traditional agrarian society to a modern nation-state has been one of the most intensely studied and debated topics in the historiography of Asia. This course explores the continuities and contrasts in Japanese history from the late Shogunate period to the disasters of the Pacific War; particular emphasis will be placed on how Japan came to be defined as a modern nation. Please note that this is a reading and writing intensive course that will utilize both peer-collaboration and peer-review.\n\nHISC 6910 Special Topics in Asian History\n\nCourses offered by visiting professors or permanent faculty. For description, consult the department.\n\nNotes: For special offering, see the Schedule of Classes.\n\nModern Europe\n\nHISE 1210 Europe and a Wider World: From the Renaissance to 1789\n\nEuropean history from the Middle Ages to the French Revolution: the Renaissance and the Reformation, the origin of the modern state and of capitalism, the beginnings of colonialism, the scientific revolution, and the Enlightenment.\n\nHISE 1220 The Emergence of the Contemporary World Since 1789\n\nThe impact of the French Revolution and Napoleon; reaction and revolt; the growth of nationalism; the industrial revolution and the rise of socialism; international rivalry, imperialism, and the coming of World War I; rise of totalitarianism and the failure of international security; World War II and postwar developments.\n\nHISE 1510 Napoleon in Russia 1812\n\nThis seminar is a close study of Napoleon's invasion of Russia in 1812, the impact it had upon the Russian Empire, and the place that it came to occupy in Russia's historical memory.

The Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union on June 22, 1941, inaugurated one of the bloodiest wars in history. The Soviet victory following devastating defeats and losses at the war's outset, was indispensable to the overall Allied victory. The Soviet victory was won at enormous cost, whether in human lives lost or in the physical devastation of the country. The victory also transformed the Soviet Union into a superpower and left the Soviet Union in control of much of Eastern Europe.

J. Simpson, some sensational legal contests have captured the public imagination and resonated in American history and culture. Why do some trials garner such attention while others, perhaps equally sensational, do not? Clearly, they reflect deeper anxieties and tap into larger themes in American culture. This course will focus on trials like these that have captured the public imagination and ask what these trials reveal about the larger society.

The Service Learning component of the course, when offered, will involve working with local public history agencies in the preparation and presentation of slavery-related materials at their individual venues.\n\nHISU 3361 Slave Rebellions: Am Reg Hist\n\nWhat happened when enslaved Africans, African-Americans and other people of African descent used organized armed resistance to fight the institution of slavery?

Only in the case of the Haitian Revolution (1791-1804) did a slave rebellion actually succeed. But all slave uprisings left behind fascinating stories--filled with heroism, tragedy, violence; disputed evidence, and angry historical debate. This seminar-style class will delve into all of these questions mostly through weekly readings in both documents and other texts.

We will explore that diversity and also seek commonalities between religious movements and their impact on the larger society. In such a survey, the emphasis will necessarily be on those formal religious movements that have made a major impact on American culture, but the importance of less mainline groups and popular belief will also be discussed.

Beginning in the 1960s, scholars began to question the assumption that rituals. customs, and social practices were fixed or experienced the same by everyone. By inserting women into their analysis of U.S. history, historians quickly determined that our understanding of key historical events, economic change, and social customs was incomplete and often failed to capture the lived experiences of most Americans. Historians of women and gender have reimagined the ways we might think about the past, causing us to reconsider assumptions about labor, sex, and politics. In this course, you join the enterprise committed to enlarging our sense of what it has meant to live in or engage with the United States by investigating the experiences of women and men.\n\nHISU 6350: History of Gender-Based Violence in the United States\n\nThis course draws upon historical and theoretical literature, memoir, film, and fiction to examine the history of gender-based violence in the United States.
