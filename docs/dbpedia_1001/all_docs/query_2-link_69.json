Home of many religions, over thousands of years it has seen dozens of dynasties ruling diverse peoples speaking scores of languages and worshiping both many gods and the One. This course offers a rapid jaunt through South Asia’s historical contradictions: from the sublime peaks of its myriad philosophies to its brutal postcolonial realities; from its depleted jungles to its teeming cities; from its ageless epics and arts to its obsession with Bollywood and cricket today.

It is used by scholars from various disciplines and has different meanings. However, usually it is used to indicate some profound change that took place since the 1970s. Some even use it to describe the three decades that have followed the postwar period. In this seminar we will approach neoliberalism from a historical perspective, including the history of neoliberal ideas, neoliberal transformations in a number of selected countries, the 2008-9 economic crisis, the neoliberalization of higher education, and the contentious relationship between neoliberalism and democracy.

In their definition, “Big History seeks to understand the integrated history of the Cosmos, Earth, Life, and Humanity, using the best available empirical evidence and scholarly methods.” The vocabulary, concepts, and environmental fears driving the project are distinctly twenty-first century. However, humanity has sought the exact same goals for longer than two millennia already. The course will sample how ancient Greek philosophy and science were used in order to propose practically and morally relevant “Big History” at different times and places: Graeco-Roman antiquity, the Christian and Muslim Middle Ages, and the modern period.\n\nBig History as Astronomy, Astrology, and Philosophy: From Antiquity to the Big Bang: Read More [+]\n\nRules & Requirements\n\nPrerequisites: Priority given to freshmen and sophomores\n\nHours & Format\n\nFall and/or spring: 15 weeks - 4 hours of seminar per week\n\nAdditional Details\n\nSubject/Course Level: History/Undergraduate\n\nGrading/Final exam status: Letter grade.

On the other hand, the countries of the region remain beset by enormous challenges, from the shadow of terrorism, the threat of nuclear war, the increasingly rapid slide into authoritarianism, the growth of religious violence and fundamentalism, resource scarcity and the looming environmental catastrophe – to name only a few. This course will explore this paradox through works of reportage, fiction and contemporary history from across the Indian subcontinent today.\n\nThird World Problems: Contemporary South Asia in Historic Perspective: Read More [+]\n\nRules & Requirements\n\nPrerequisites: Priority given to freshmen and sophomores\n\nHours & Format\n\nFall and/or spring: 15 weeks - 4 hours of seminar per week\n\nAdditional Details\n\nSubject/Course Level: History/Undergraduate\n\nGrading/Final exam status: Letter grade.

In focusing on key elements of material culture and emphasizing how they have been viewed at specific moments in Chinese history, the course teaches students of history how to achieve a more balanced picture of the past drawn from both visual and literary records. Inevitably, the course tries to determine for a particular temporal and geographical setting what's ordinary or conventional and what's not; also to rethink the metaphors that currently dominate thinking about history in China. No prior acquaintance with Chinese history is required for the course.\n\nTopics in Chinese History: Reading the Visual in Chinese History: Read More [+]\n\nHours & Format\n\nFall and/or spring: 15 weeks - 3-3 hours of lecture and 0-1 hours of discussion per week\n\nSummer:\n\n6 weeks - 7.5-7.5 hours of lecture and 0-2 hours of discussion per week\n\n8 weeks - 6-6 hours of lecture and 0-1.5 hours of discussion per week\n\nAdditional Details\n\nSubject/Course Level: History/Undergraduate\n\nGrading/Final exam status: Letter grade.
