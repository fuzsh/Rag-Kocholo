        "text": "You would have to be stoned to see it. I saw it in Atlanta as a result of a Film Festival in 1973 and I have never,ever forgotten it. And no, I wasn't stoned when I saw it because I was in grad school and couldn't smoke because the school had a solid rep for throwing out anyone with a \"drug\" violation. . BUT even in a cold sober state, it was one of the silliest dope smoking movies I have ever seen. I don't know how you could get a copy, but it definitely is worth the try! there are enough 70s references to make it almost a documentary of the weed culture of the time. If you are ever having a 70s party, this would be the film to find. I don't know where you could get it since it was released before VCRs or DVD's- but if you find it, post where to get it!"
