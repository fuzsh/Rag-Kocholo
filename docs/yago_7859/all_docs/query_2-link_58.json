        "text": "Streaming is extremely convenient, and I use it, yet my physical media purchasing has never slowed. Apocalypse Now is a great film, and about 3 years ago, I picked up all 3 cuts along with Hearts Of Darkness on 4K Blu-ray/UHD in a 6-disc set from Lionsgate, new, for $17.99 on Amazon. They had that price for months, and felt like they couldn't give the set away---\n\nThen why bother to remaster anything, right? Just pull whatever is in the vault and throw it on a platform? I'm all for access, but I'm also about studios making money from their libraries as those budgets do trickle down to people like you and I when restorations and remasters are needed....with the golden days on physical media behind us, that $2.95 or $4.95 per title keeps what remastering work flowing somewhat.\n\nI grew up loving It Came From Hollywood. It was my introduction to cult movies, Ed Wood, 50s monster movies, and other good stuff. Paramount announced a DVD over a decade ago, going as far as commissioning artwork for the cover, then canceled it do the complicated rights issues (every movie in the film needed to be re-licensed, I think).\n\nHowever, it is currently watchable on YouTube. That's as good as it's probably going to get for It Came From Hollywood. Given that most of the film is short clips from other movies, I can live without 4K HD for this one.\n\nOn the other hand, Scream Factory has reissued Terror in the Aisles (1983 clip film about horror movies) on blu ray. I don't know why that one made it to disc.\n\nI think one reason is that the studio is worth more if everything is remastered. They also then have the ability to license it out to somebody else to release. I just watched a new Warner Bros.-produced documentary on Paramount+ streaming... why it's not on Max, I have no idea.(The studios and streaming channels are sometimes very incestuous.)\n\nThere's also the problem of deterioration: the film libraries continue to disintegrate and fall apart, year after year, and they have to digitize them all just so they can hang on to a barely \"reasonable\" version of the film or TV show. If the film completely turns to dust, then the studio has literally lost money, even for something they're not doing anything with.\n\nI've complained literally a hundred times over the past 17 years on this group how frustrated I am that the studios, networks, and distributors don't digitize every short, TV show, movie, trailer, every piece of film and videotape that survives in their warehouses and make them all available in some form to viewers. Just purely from the history point of view, it all deserves to be restored.\n\nIf it were up to me, the really old shows & films prior to (say) 1980 would all be up at a budget price: say, $2.95 (or even less) for a film and 10 cents for a TV show (or maybe $3-$4 for a season). It's a question of gauging interest and charging an appropriate amount. I get that very few people might pay $99 for a boxed set of every Beverly Hillbillies episode, but they might pay $29.95 for all 274 episodes on streaming.\n\nIn general, big-budget studio films of the last 30-40 years will probably live forever, because they've already been mastered and saved. And there are far worse films than this (some of which I worked on).\n\nYeah, really obscure indie films can be really, really hard to find. The handful that were super-successful -- I think I mentioned Dolemite and Sweet Sweetback's Badass Song as just two of them -- somehow made a lot of money, so they survive. There's a ton of films up on IMDB (like Towing) that exist, but aren't necessarily easy to find.\n\nVinegar Syndrome has found some very interesting films that had home video releases in the 1980s and 1990s, mostly on VHS, that just evaporated and never wound up on DVD and Blu-ray. Some of these are so awful you wonder why it's worth the time to preserve them, but I say every film has some fans out there, and sometimes the fact that it's bad is sort of the point of the film.\n\nSwear to god, I mastered Inchon in 1981 when it was released. Nobody saw it. You figure it's directed by a guy who did three James Bond films, plus it starred Laurence Olivier, Jacqueline Bisset, Ben Gazzara, Toshiro Mifune, and Richard Roundtree... how could it fail? Famously, it's cost $46 million dollars -- an incredible number 40 years ago -- and made five million dollars. One of the legendary failures that really hurt MGM at the time.\n\nI remember people harped on the Rev Moon ting a lot. Closest I got to seeing it was the clips on whatever show Gene and Roger were doing (not sure if it was still Sneak Previews or if they made the move to At the Movies), but they weren’t thrilled with it.\n\n@Vidiot: I would gladly do a trade-off. I'd send three terrible \"big-budget\" studio flix to the incinerator in return for finding/reviving three 'lost' '70s movies like SUMMER RUN (1973), REDNECK MILLER (1976) and CONVENTION GIRLS (1978).\n\n\"Convention Girls\" did exist as of 2014, I believe, on a battered 35mm print that was director Joseph Adler's (1940-2020) personal copy. But he's deceased now and who knows what happened to his print of CONVENTION GIRLS? Somehow it never garnered any kind of homevideo release from any country. I looked for it! I even bought a poster of \"Convention Girls\", which from the reviews I've read along with old news clippings via the Temple of Schlock website, is more like a slightly-adult version of NASHVILLE than a raucous \"raunch-fest\". I'd like to see it.\n\nSUMMER RUN (1973) was also known as \"Harry\" and \"The Backpack Girls\"; it was retitled twice for its re•releases in drive-in theaters in the mid-70s and then vanished. I don't know of any way to see it •or• if there is a print extant anywhere. Same with REDNECK MILLER. Could well be gone.\n\nSomething Weird Video rescued a great deal of \"B\"-movies of all genres from certain destruction, at least.\n\nI saw Inchon on release (as I did every film that played at my hometown cinema), and it was fully funded by Sun Moon, and his church got the hit/loss of over 40M. MGM only took a bath on the P&A—-I do have the soundtrack LP ( it was a give-a-way tie-in when I saw it), and I see an expanded CD soundtrack release will be hitting the market soon. Those wacky Jerry Goldsmith fans!\n\nI’m not writing this off by saying there is nothing to worry about, yes, more can be done, more needs to be done, yet all the major studios have robust archive programs, and their libraries are nothing like the shape they were in around the late 1970s when you started in the business. Sure, it’s not perfect; there are problem areas and challenges, and someone can always pull up a title and say, “SEE, EVERYTHING IS DETERIORATION” to get people up in arms, but the studios have improved greatly and are on the right track since the late 80’s.\n\nNow, Independent productions, like what you addressed later with the titles you do for VS, are an entirely different conversation, and many/most have some serious issues attached to them.\n\nPer the LOC copyright catalog, a 35mm print of CONVENTION GIRLS was placed on deposit in 1977, so in theory, the LOC should still have this print in their collection....if it's not gone VS. Link to the listing below:\n\nWebVoyage Record View 1\n\nAs for SUMMER RUN, there is no 35mm print on deposit, but there are 2 3/4 tapes on the feature at the LOC. Sadly, there is nothing on REDNECK MILLER in the LOC catalog. I checked UCLA, and they hold nothing on these 3."
