Arnold, Gerald, Helga, the three protagonists as in the series, set out on a quest to save their neighborhood from a greedy, sinister developer who wants to tear it down and put up a enormous mall. Hey Arnold!: The Jungle Movie was released as a TV sequel in 2017.\n\nDirected by Tuck Tucker. Written by Craig Bartlett and Steve Viksten.\n\nArnold\n\n[edit]\n\nIt's not flat. It's just a little low on air. [The ball pops and deflates]\n\nWe can refuse to sell our houses.\n\nThat went well.\n\n[stepping on to the roof] Deep Voice!\n\nHelga Geraldine Pataki\n\n[edit]\n\nIf only I could find the guts to tell you. If only I weren't such a coward. If only I had your strength.\n\n[watching from a roof] Blockapalooza, hah! Please.\n\nI was walking, until you knocked me down, football head.\n\nSo? What's your point?\n\nEugene Horowitz\n\n[edit]\n\nThis is our neighborhood!\n\nHow can they tear it down!?\n\nHow can they turn our smile into a frown!?\n\nWe may be just a few, but if me and you and you\n\nBut I thought the occasion called for it. [singing] We may be just a few\n\nDialogue\n\n[edit]\n\n[First lines; The movie begins with we see the city's locations and Harold, Iggy and Lorenzo are playing baseball before Willie drives with his ice cream truck; A kid is giving money to Willie, having his ice cream and Willie reads the newspaper; Harold throws a baseball to Park; Park strikes out and the woman is at the window looks up to a baseball while putting clothes in the basket; we see Brainy and Harvey are at the market; Sid and Stinky are splashing water; the construction workers look up at the helicopter with a black wrecking ball; as the wrecking ball hits the apartments and pouring liquid on the family photo]\n\nGerald Johanssen: I'm telling you, Arnold, your ball is flat.\n\nArnold: It's not flat. It's just a little low on air. [The ball pops and deflates]\n\nGerald Johanssen: Like I said, your ball is flat. Hey, I still can't believe we let those fifth graders beat us.\n\nArnold: Well, the important thing is we tried our best.\n\nGerald Johanssen: The important thing is we got our buns whooped.\n\nArnold: Come on Gerald, we had fun. And we almost beat 'em.\n\nGerald Johanssen: Why do you do that Arnold? Why do you always have to look on the bright side?\n\nArnold: Somebody has to. [Arnold and Gerald notice FTi helicopters, and a crowd of citizens] Mr. Green, what's going on?\n\nMr. Green: It's Scheck. He wants to buy up the whole neighborhood so he can knock it down and put up a fancy mall.\n\nArnold: Who's Scheck? [The crowd is watching TV]\n\nReporter: [on TV] The plan, which was approved by the mayor just moments ago, would allow Future Tech Industries to redevelop a six-square-block area between 33rd and 39th Streets. Oh, I understand the president and CEO of Future Tech Industries, Mr. Scheck, is about to make a statement.\n\nMr. Scheck: [on TV; To the mayor] Thank you. I just want to say I'm delighted at the mayor's support of our renewal plan.\n\nGerald Johanssen: Nice suit.\n\n[A man with a white mustache shushes him]\n\nMayor Dixie: [on TV] I am behind Mr. Scheck's project one hundred percent. [camera flashes]\n\nMr. Scheck: [on TV] Although some of you in the affected area may have concerns about how this plan will impact your homes and businesses, let me assure you; change is good. This plan represents the end of urban decay, the end of your broken-down shops and apartment buildings, the end of antiquated and dilapidated storefronts. It's time for a new world. Out with the old, in with the new.\n\nArnold: What's wrong with old things? Some old things are great.\n\nHarold Berman: Yeah, like Mrs. Vitello.\n\nMrs. Vitello: [hits Harold over the head with flowers] Whippersnapper.\n\nHarold Berman: Ow!\n\nMr. Green: This has been goin' on for months. The city council recommended against it, but the mayor's lettin' him do it anyway. I never figured he could pull it off.\n\nGerald Johanssen: What does it mean?\n\nMr. Green: It means they want us to sell out, move away so this Scheck character and his big corporation can move in.\n\nCrowd: No!\n\nHarold Berman: No way!\n\nMr. Scheck: [on TV] It's time to put the past behind us. I have seen the future, and it's Future Tech Industries.\n\nPhoebe Heyerdahl: But this is our neighborhood!\n\nRhonda Lloyd: They can't just tear it down.\n\nEugene Horowitz: [singing] This is our neighborhood! / How can they tear it down!? / How can they turn our smile into a frown!? / We may be just a few, but if me and you and you. [Arnold switches off the stereo]\n\nArnold: Stop! Stop singing, Eugene. This is serious. [A truck carrying a bulldozer is speeding down the street]\n\nCrowd: Oh, my gosh.\n\nMr. Green: We can't take this lying down. We should do something!\n\nHarold Berman: Yeah, but what can we do?\n\nArnold: We can refuse to sell our houses.\n\nGerald Johanssen: Well, I'll sign a petition!\n\nArnold: Yeah. Let everybody know this is our neighborhood and we're not giving it up without a fight!\n\nHelga Pataki: [watching from a roof] Hah! Arnold! What an annoying little goody two-shoes. What a dopey little dreamer. What a corny little cornball. Always going around trying to get everyone to look on the bright side and do the right thing. How I despise him. And yet... I love him! I love him! I love his unerring sense of right and wrong. I love his unfailing insistence on the needs of the many over the needs of the few. But most of all I love the way his hair smells when I get real close behind him and he doesn't know I'm there, but then he turns and looks at me funny and I scowl at him and make an excuse for being so close, and then I insult him just to cover up the secret, adoring feelings for which I have so long and painfully harbored. Oh, Arnold!\n\nArnold: Mr. Green can write the petition.\n\nMr. Green: Say no more, Arnold. I'm already working on it.\n\nHelga Pataki: If only I could find the guts to tell you. If only I weren't such a coward. If only I had your strength.\n\nArnold: We'll take it around the neighborhood and get everybody to sign it.\n\nHelga Pataki: But what if you lose? What if the neighborhood is torn down, and you have to move away, and we are separated, and we never see each other again, and I never, ever seize the chance to tell you how I really feel about you? Oh, Arnold, how I love you.\n\n[Brainy appears from a chimney, dressed up as a chimney sweep. Helga smacks him]\n\n[Helga comes home]\n\nHelga Pataki: Dad! [To Miriam sleeping on a table] How's it going, Miriam?\n\nMiriam Pataki: Oh. Molasses, it's you. [Helga hears voices and comes to see what's going on]\n\nBig Bob Pataki: Okay, great, but where's the store go?\n\nNick Vermicelli: [Big Bob, Nick Vermicelli, and three other guys are seen gathered around a model of the neighborhood on a table] Alright. Right here. Big Bob's Beeper Emporium. Big sign, can't miss it from the freeway, and the overpass drops you big-bang-boom right in the parkin' lot.\n\nBig Bob Pataki: That's good. Yeah, right in the stinkin' lot.\n\nHelga Pataki: Dad?\n\nBig Bob Pataki: What do you want, Olga?\n\nHelga Pataki: It's Helga, Dad.\n\nBig Bob Pataki: Right, Helga. That's what I said.\n\nHelga Pataki: Could I talk to you?\n\nNick Vermicelli: We gotta split anyway, Bob. We'll talk.\n\nBig Bob Pataki: Right, we'll talk. And send me the paperwork, I can't wait to get started. Hey, can I keep this pop-up thing? [He points at the model]\n\nNick Vermicelli: You got it. [Nick and the other men leave the room]\n\nBig Bob Pataki: Alright. [to Helga] You know what this is? It's our future. See, here's where my new Super Beeper Emporium is gonna go up, right after we rip down the flower shop, and Green Meats and the rest of the block.\n\nHelga Pataki: Uh yeah, well, uh, about all that, Dad... I mean a lot of people are gonna have to move away and sell their businesses.\n\nBig Bob Pataki: Yeah, what's your point?\n\nHelga Pataki: Well, I was just wondering if this whole tear-down-the-neighborhood Future Tech thing is really necessary.\n\nBig Bob Pataki: Of course, it's necessary. It's more than necessary. It's progress. You can't have progress without a little pain. No pain, no gain.\n\nHelga Pataki: But what's wrong with leaving things the way they are?\n\nBig Bob Pataki: I'll tell you what's wrong with it, missy. Leave things the way they are and Big Bob's Super Beeper Emporium doesn't happen.\n\nHelga Pataki: But, Dad...\n\nBig Bob Pataki: Hey-hey-hey-hey-hey! I'll say this once, and I want you to hear it, little lady. Change is good. When the new Big Bob's Super Beeper Emporium goes up, the cash is gonna roll in and you'll forget all about the old neighborhood. And do you know why? Because we'll be rich. And that means you'll be rich. You can have that pony you've been wantin'.\n\nHelga Pataki: Dad, I wanted a pony when I was five.\n\nBig Bob Pataki: Uh. Well, what do you want now?\n\nHelga Pataki: I don't know.\n\nBig Bob Pataki: Well, make up your mind, 'cause once this neighborhood goes down and my store goes up, you can have anything you want. And I mean anything.\n\nHelga Pataki: [looks at fashion magazine] Anything?\n\nBig Bob Pataki: That's what I said. We're gonna be stinkin' rich, girl. Rich. What's more important than that, huh?\n\n[Arnold comes home, FTi truck passes by]\n\nArnold: Grandpa?\n\nGrandpa Phil: That's my name. Don't wear it out. (shark jaws fall down)\n\nArnold: Grandpa, I'm worried.\n\nGrandpa Phil: Oh, don't worry, Arnold. We won't sell the boarding house. We're behind you all the way. Right, Pookie?\n\nGrandma Gertie: [in cheerleader outfit] Home team, home team, woo!\n\nArnold: But what if Scheck gets everyone else to sell?\n\nGrandpa Phil: Then I guess they'll bulldoze down the neighborhood, short man. Pookie and I will have to move to an old folks' home and who knows what'll happen to you. You'll probably be sent to a foster home in some Midwestern state like Manitoba or... wait, no, that's not a state, that's a province. Oh, no, Arnold! You'll be a Canadian!\n\nArnold: Grandpa, I'm serious.\n\nGrandpa Phil: I know, Arnold, but we're not cooked yet. Whatever happens, we'll all be OK, even if we have to become Canadians. You know, they have very good bacon there. Canadian. Bacon. This thing on? Come on, Arnold. Work with me.\n\nArnold: Goodnight, Grandpa. Goodnight, Grandma.\n\nGrandma Gertie: Go, team! [Grandpa sits on the shark jaws]\n\n[The next morning. FTi helicopters and a group of workers install huge Scheckvision TV screen on a roof. A crowd is watching at it]\n\nCrowd: Awesome!\n\nWorker: Release.\n\n[The workers unroll a huge sheet with \"SCHECKVISION MALL-PLEX — INFORMATION HEADQUARTERS\" written on it, and hang it below the screen]\n\nArnold: What's going on?\n\nStinky Peterson: You must be a sound sleeper, Arnold. They've been hammering on it all mornin'.\n\nSid: Look!\n\n[On the Scheckvision screen it's written \"30 DAYS UNTIL CONSTRUCTION BEGINS\"]\n\nStinky Peterson: Willikers!\n\nSid: It's so wicked awesome.\n\nArnold: You guys! It's not awesome. It's terrible! Read it. We've got thirty days left to save the neighborhood.\n\nStinky Peterson: Look, it's that Scheck feller.\n\nMr. Scheck: [on the Scheckvision screen] It's time for a new world. Out with the old, in with the new. I have seen the future and it's Future Tech Industries.\n\nStinky Peterson: He sure gives me the willies.\n\nGerald Johanssen: But you gotta admit, he looks good in a suit.\n\nArnold: [annoyed] Gerald.\n\nGerald Johanssen: I know, I know. I'm just saying.\n\nArnold: Come on! [The boys run away]\n\n[Arnold, and other citizens of the neighborhood are trying to organize protests against tearing down the neighborhood. Helga is not sympathetic to them. The days on the Scheckvision screen are cointing down]\n\nMonkeyman: [after receiving a leaflet from Arnold] Monkeyman!\n\n[The Scheckvision screen shows: \"6 DAYS UNTIL CONSTRUCTION BEGINS\"]\n\nJolly Olly Man: Yeah, six days to go, and then sayonara, suckers!\n\nArnold: Six days. Enough time to try maybe one last big... thing. But... but what?\n\nRhonda Lloyd: How about a party? You always throw the most outré parties, Arnold.\n\nArnold: Yeah, a party. A block party. With music and food.\n\nRhonda Lloyd: And finger sandwiches. Ooh!\n\nHarold Berman: Yeah, and food!\n\nArnold: We'll have a concert! The music will be so loud that we'd end up on the news. And then people will get excited about it, and the mayor will have to change her mind. And she'll stop the bulldozers.\n\nFriends: Yeah!\n\nStinky Peterson: What do we call it?\n\nRhonda Lloyd: How about the \"Save the Neighborhood Debutante Ball\".\n\nKids: Nah...\n\nGerald Johanssen: Block Power, baby.\n\nStinky Peterson: Blockenanny.\n\nEugene Horowitz: Block Till You Drop. [Falls down] Ow.\n\nGerald Johanssen: It's a Block Thing. I would know.\n\nSid: A Block Party... Party?\n\nArnold: How about... Blockapalooza?\n\nKids: Yeah!\n\n[Arnold and Gerald are giving away passerbys leaflets with \"SAVE THE NEIGHBORHOOD — BLOCKAPALOOZA !MUSIC - FOOD - FUN! This Saturday!\" writtin on them]\n\nArnold: Blockapalooza.\n\nGerald Johanssen: This Saturday is the day.\n\nArnold: Blockapalooza!\n\nGerald Johanssen: Don't forget to get your tickets while they're hot!\n\nNick Vermicelli: [getting a leaflet] \"Save the neighborhood\"? \"Blockapalooza\"? This we don't need. [Pulls out a cell phone and calls somebody] Yeah it's me Nick. I think we got a problem.\n\n[Ernie Potts plays accordion; Oskar Kokoshka and Mailman Harvey play saxophone; Grandpa (wearing a rasta wig) is on drums; Mr. Hyunh plays guitar; Suzie Kokoshka is a DJ; Grandma is tap dancing. Arnold and Gerald are at controls. They all play some kind of strange pokla rock music, and Grandpa smashes one of Suzie's records, annoyed by her DJ techniques. The crowd is cheering]\n\nHelga Pataki: [watching from a roof] Blockapalooza, hah! Please.\n\nReporter: [for TV] It's called Blockapalooza, a last-ditch effort to save a forgotten neighborhood from the wrecking ball. A classic story of the little guy pitted against the corporate giant.\n\n[Nick Vermicelli and Big Bob are watching TV at Big Bob's house]\n\nBig Bob Pataki: What the heck are they doing? They'll mess up the whole deal!\n\nNick Vermicelli: Forget about it. It's all taken care of.\n\nArnold: [on TV] You know what this is about. It's our last chance to stand up and tell Future Tech Industries that we won't sell. We won't let 'em tear down our neighborhood.\n\n[The crowd on TV screen is cheering]\n\nNick Vermicelli: One of our guys intercepted their permit, thereby making the whole assemblage illegal.\n\n[Police cars suddenly appear at the party]\n\nOfficer: Go, go, go!\n\n[The crowd is panicking. Police breaks up the party. People are running away]\n\nGerald Johanssen: [to the officer] Hey, what's going on?\n\nRiot Cop: Never got any permit.\n\n[Nick Vermicelli and Big Bob are laughing at the TV screen]\n\nVoice: Please disperse from this area at once!\n\nArnold: Grandma?\n\nGrandma Gertie: Bring on your worst. We shall not be moved. [She chains herself to the door of the Sunset Arms]\n\nOfficer: Come on. Nice and easy. [Grandma almost bites him]\n\nGrandpa Phil: Hey! Stop, that's a frail old lady!\n\nGrandma Gertie: [while she and the door she's chained to are carried into the S.P.A.T. car] Never give up Arnold. Never give in. Save the neighborhood. One if by land, two if by sea. Put the lime in the coconut. Mix it all up. [The car speeds away while she laughs]\n\nArnold: [returns home] Grandma?\n\nErnie Potts: [carrying his things downstairs] She's still in jail.\n\nArnold: But I thought they were just gonna keep her for one night.\n\nErnie Potts: She keeps trying to escape. Thinks it's a game. Fourth time they had to put her back.\n\n[We see Grandma trying different ways to escape, only to be thwarted every time]\n\nArnold: Hi, Mr. Hyunh. Have you seen Grandpa?\n\nMr. Hyunh: Oh, Arnold. We may never see each other again. [Runs away sobbing]\n\nOskar Kokoshka: Hey, Mr. Hyunh, can I help you clean out your refrigerator?\n\n[Arnold comes up to his room]\n\nArnold: Von Scheck?\n\nGrandpa Phil: I wonder if he's related...? [Telling about the Tomato Incident] Anyway, Von Scheck's men attacked the neighborhood, but the locals used guerrilla warfare. They made a barricade of turned vegetable carts and fought with whatever they had. They had lots of tomatoes. They were British tomatoes, which were small and hard and really hurt if you got hit with one. That did it. The redcoats were in full, ignominious retreat. That's why we eat American tomatoes, Arnold. Although I had one recently from Chile. Very juicy.\n\nArnold: Grandpa, did that actually happen?\n\nGrandpa Phil Of course. I sliced it up and put it in a sandwich.\n\nArnold: No. Don't you see? This is our answer.\n\nGrandpa Phil Yes. Yes, Arnold! Juicy tomatoes from Chile! Why didn't I think of that?\n\nArnold: No, the Tomato Incident. If that battle took place right in the boarding house, this whole neighborhood should be a national landmark.\n\nArnold: [to the bus driver] You're going up to the peninsula?\n\nMurray: Don't talk to the driver while the bus is in motion.\n\nGerald Johanssen: But the bus isn't in motion.\n\nMurray: [starts the bus] Now it is. Get behind the yellow line.\n\nMr. Scheck: \"Sir. Sir. Yes, sir. Sir.\" Is that all you can say?\n\nGuard: No, sir. I mean, yes, sir. Sir!\n\nBridget: Who'd touched my button? [Arnold and Gerald are smiling in a slightly perverse way]\n\nArnold and Gerald Johanssen [in unison]: Me!\n\nGerald Johanssen: [choosing spy equipment] Do these belts come in any other color?\n\nBridget: Black or pink?\n\nGerald Johanssen: Uh, we'll take black.\n\n[Trying to think up a way to save the neighborhood.]\n\nOskar Kokoshka: Maybe we could paint the house with vanishing cream. Then it would be invisible.\n\nErnie Potts: That is the stupidest idea I ever heard. What if it rains? Ding-dong! You ever think about that, Kokoshka? It'll wash the vanishing cream off, and then everyone'll see us.\n\nOskar Kokoshka: Oh boy, you're right.\n\nErnie Potts: What we gotta do is build a dummy neighborhood one block over.\n\nErnie Potts: Yeah? Just one little detail, Gramps. Where you gonna get the explosives?\n\nGrandpa Phil: From you, of course. Just go down to your job site and lift a couple hundred pounds of explosives when no one's looking. Huh?\n\nErnie Potts: That's the craziest thing I ever heard, especially considering I got twice that much under my bed. [The rest of the boarders look at him incredulously] What? Hey, we all got our little peccadilloes.\n\nMurray [continuous quote]: I drive twenty-five miles per hour. No exceptions, no discussion.\n\nGerald: [about the bus driver] I wonder what bee got in his boxers.\n\nMurray: Hey, you'd have a bee in your boxers too if you were in my moccasins. My girlfriend left me two weeks ago. Her name is Mona she said she wanted a whole man.\n\nGerald: \"A whole man\"? What's that mean?\n\nMurray: [shows them his prosthetic leg] I lost the real one in the war.\n\n[They run away to the street. A street phone rings. Gerald picks up]\n\nGerald Johannsen: Hello?\n\nDeep Voice: [on the phone] Good job getting the key.\n\nArnold: Wait. Deep Voice. Where are you?\n\nDeep Voice: Don't worry about that. I'm watching all your movements.\n\n[We see the figure of the Deep Voice standing on the other side of the street]\n\nDeep Voice: I'm everywhere and I'm nowhere, but mostly I'm... everywhere.\n\nGerald Johannsen: Come on, Deep Voice, cut the voodoo dolly mumbo jumbo, okay?\n\nArnold: Yeah, why do you have to be so mysterious?\n\nDeep Voice: You two seem confused about who's calling the shots here. I am. Without me, you'll never get the document, you'll never save your neighborhood. You've got to get into Scheck's office. His safe deposit boxes are in a room behind his desk.\n\nArnold: We have to get back into his office?\n\nDeep Voice: Right. Only this time, don't get caught. You've got to find a way to distract security away from the main entrance. Now, it's exactly two A.M. The bulldozers roll at seven. What are you waiting for? [Hangs up]\n\nGerald Johannsen: Man, that Deep Voice is a pain in the... [He's cut by a bus passing by with its brakes hissing]\n\nArnold: Come on. [The boys run to the bus]\n\nGerald Johanssen: [to the bus driver] Hi, it's us. How you been?\n\nMurray: Oh, so it's the two juvenile delinquents who busted my door.\n\n[Grandma finally escapes through the sewer. Gerald points out at security cameras]\n\nGerald Johannsen: Those cameras detect any motion. If we even move, they'll see us. [Arnold pulls out the remote-control car] Arnold, this is no time for playing with a toy car.\n\nArnold: I'm not playing, Gerald. [The car speeds down the hall, and camera turns to watch it]\n\nHead of Security: [seeing something on the screen] What was that?\n\nGuard: Come on, let's check it out. [Two guards run away]\n\nArnold: We can get to Scheck's office this way. Come on. [The boys get into Scheck's office] Deep Voice said to look in the room behind his desk. [Gerald pulls a book from a shelf, and it opens a secret door]\n\nGerald Johanssen: What are you waiting for? [The boys see a huge number of safe deposite boxes. They sigh] Well, we'd better get started.\n\n[The men move TNT boxes from above into the tunnels]\n\nErnie Potts: That's the last of it, Gramps.\n\nGrandpa Phil: Now all we have to do is run this wire up to the street and wait for the bulldozers to come. Then, we blow a huge hole, and they fall right in.\n\nOskar Kokoshka: Sounds great, Grandpa. Now let's get out of here.\n\nMr. Hyunh: Yes! It is still very creepy.\n\n[We hear bangs the door, Nick wakes up and gets to his feet. He turns on the light and door opens. Big Bob enters and he is angrily]\n\nBig Bob Pataki: WAKE UP, YOU WEASEL!! I JUST READ THE FINE PRINT!! SO IT'S GONNA BE SCHECK'S BEEPER EMPORIUM, IS IT?! YOU WERE TRYIN' TO DOUBLE-CROSS ME!!\n\nNick Vermicelli: I don't know what are you talking about, Bob.\n\nBig Bob Pataki: I READ THE CONTRACT, PALLY!! I GET A NEW BEEPER EMPORIUM, BUT SCHECK GETS FIFTY-ONE PERCENT OF MY COMPANY!!\n\nNick Vermicelli: Okay, okay, so it's true. But you signed a contract, so there's nothing you can do about it. The ink's dry.\n\nBig Bob Pataki: YOU WERE IN ON IT THE WHOLE TIME!! YOU KNEW HE WAS GONNA SHAFT ME!!\n\nNick Vermicelli: Yeah, so what if I did? It's a free country.\n\nBig Bob Pataki: REALLY? WELL, THEN IF IT'S A FREE COUNTRY, I GUESS I'M FREE TO BEAT THE LIVIN' SNOT OUTTA YA!!\n\nNick Vermicelli: Now, Bob, don't get crazy!\n\nBig Bob Pataki: TOO LATE!!\n\n[Bob grabs Nick by the throat; Nick grabs a trophy and strikes it against Bob's head. Once they get in the kitchen, Nick pulls out an egg mixer that he uses for self-defense. Bob in turn uses a spatula. The two continue fighting each other until Nick splashes pickle juice on Bob, and he rips off his shirt, now looking and acting like the Incredible Hulk. Hulk-Bob lunges at Nick, but slips on the pickle juice and crashes against the fridge]\n\nNick Vermicelli: Um... Bob?\n\n[Nick slams the Refrigator Door in Hulk-Bob's face, knocks him out. As Nick goes to the sink to wash himself. Nick looks in the mirror and finally notices that the key is gone]\n\nNick Vermicelli: The key, what happened? Oh, no. That dream I had, that angel... That wasn't no angel, it was that football-headed kid! It was really happening! He must've stole the stinkin' key! [phones to Scheck] Yeah, Mr. Scheck. It's me, Nick. Listen, I got bad news. I think I lost the key. Yeah, the key. I think that football-headed kid took it. I don't know, I was asleep. I think he snuck in and stole it. Yeah, I know, I'm stupid, stupid!\n\n[Arnold and Gerald are check the boxes]\n\nGerald Johanssen: [tiredly] 997.\n\nArnold: Aah.\n\nGerald Johanssen: 998.\n\nArnold: Nope.\n\nGerald Johanssen: 999. [The key finally matches the box. Arnold opens it]\n\nBoth: Empty?\n\nArnold: Where's the document?\n\nMr. Scheck: [from behind their backs] Looking for something? [Arnold and Gerald are startled] Well, here you are, back again. After I patiently explained that your mission is completely hopeless, it still is. Though I'm less inclined to entertain you after you broke into my building for the second time. Did you think you could get away with this? There are cameras everywhere. I record everything that goes on, day and night. Did you think I'd let you win, let you save your little neighborhood? Don't you realize who I am? I am Alphonse Perrier Du Von Scheck. [Scheck turns on the light revealing historical art] I can trace my ancestry back to the founding fathers. [Scheck angrily turns to a framed painting] You know when we lost control of this city? When that ridiculous Tomato Incident took place in your pathetic little neighborhood. [Scheck takes the painting from the wall, breaks it in half, and flings to the floor] Tearing it down and putting my name upon its place will be revenge of the sweetest kind. [Grins evilly]\n\nArnold: But the document. Where's the document?\n\nMr. Scheck: [laughs evilly, reaches into his jacket, and pulls out the document and a lighter] Unfortunately, like your little plan, it's about to go up in smoke.\n\n[Arnold runs. The phone on the wall rings, and he picks up]\n\nDeep Voice: [on the phone] Don't go out in the hall yet. It's swarming with guards.\n\nArnold: Wait, how do you know I'm here? Where are you?\n\nDeep Voice: Don't worry about me. The point is you've got the evidence you need to save the neighborhood. Now we've got to get you safely out of the building.\n\n[He notices the shadow figure of the Deep Voice, and comes closer to him]\n\nDeep Voice: If you're caught now, all is lost.\n\nArnold: [looking at the cloaked figure] Huh, Deep Voice. Tell me how I can get out of here?\n\n[Arnold drops the phone receiver and comes to the Silhouette of Deep Voice]\n\nDeep Voice: Okay, Arnold, listen. You've got to wait until the guards have gone to the other side of the building. I have a plan to distract them, but it'll only buy you a few minutes.\n\nArnold: [steps on to the roof] Deep Voice! [thunder booms]\n\nDeep Voice: [hiding the face] Don't come another step closer. Pay no attention to that man with the Voice Box.\n\nArnold: Who are you?\n\nDeep Voice: Uh-uh, n-no one in particular. [we can see a bit of Pink Clothes underneath the trench-coat]\n\nArnold: [approches while Deep Voice moves back to the edge of the roof] No more games, Deep Voice, I'm not doing anything until I know who you are.\n\n[A stilt breaks, Deep Voice stumbles and falls on to the ground, reveals it was only Helga in Disguise]\n\nArnold: Helga, you, you're Deep Voice?\n\nHelga Pataki: [still in voice box] Heh, heh. [normal voice] Looks like it.\n\nArnold: But I don't get it. How come, how come you couldn't just tell me what you knew? Why'd you have to make up all this crazy secret identity?\n\nHelga Pataki: [nervously] No reason.\n\nArnold: But Helga, you just risked everything to help me save the neighborhood.\n\nHelga Pataki: So, what's your point?\n\nArnold: That's a pretty amazing thing to do for someone you claim to hate.\n\nHelga Pataki: Yeah, well, I'm a pretty amazing person, Football Head.\n\nArnold: But, I thought you were on your dad`s side. I thought you were gonna get rich off the whole deal.\n\nHelga Pataki: Money isn't everything.\n\nArnold: Helga, why'd you do it?\n\nHelga Pataki: [nervously] It's my Civic Duty.\n\nArnold: Helga.\n\nHelga Pataki: Because I love a good mystery?\n\nArnold: I think I need to go lie down.\n\nHelga Pataki: I'll go with you!\n\nArnold: [to Murray driving really fast] Is there anything we can do?\n\nMurray: Yeah, you can get on your knees and pray this hunk of junk holds together long enough to get us uptown in one piece!\n\nArnold: Don't you wanna save all those people's homes?\n\nMurray: Not my problem, kid.\n\nArnold: Don't you care that every building from 33rd to 39th street is going to be demolished?\n\nMurray: [eyes widen] 33rd to 39th Street?\n\nArnold: That's right.\n\nMurray: Hey, that's where Mona lives. [yanks a lever switching the bus from \"Uptown\" to \"Express\" mode, then pulls the gear shift] Hang on to your goodies, kids! We've got a neighborhood to save!\n\nGrandpa Phil: [As he and the boarders prepare for the bulldozers] Hey, where's Arnold?\n\nMr. Scheck: Is the overpass wired?\n\nNick Vermicelli: Yes.\n\nMr. Scheck: Blow it.\n\nNick Vermicelli: Ehm, just so it would have been straight, boss, this is pretty serious.\n\nMr. Scheck: Serious?\n\nNick Vermicelli: Yeah, you know, as in 15 to life.\n\nMr. Scheck: [angrily] Just do it, you incompentent morons!\n\nBob: [discovering the trench the boarders have made] Hey, what's goin' on? 286-DX plunger, high-gauge wire, C-47 tubing. I know what you're up to - you're planning to blow the street up, make a hole big enough to stop the bulldozers from knocking down the neighborhood. You could do serious jail time for that.\n\nGrandpa: Well, I...\n\nBob: You need any help?\n\nArnold: [sees Gerald praying in Hebrew] I didn't know you were so religious.\n\nGerald: Neither did I.\n\nScheck: [last words as he gets arrested] I would've gotten away with it if it wasn't for that meddling football-head, the kid with the weird stack of hair and that brat with the 1 eyebrow.\n\nHelga: [slams the door of the prison truck] Tell it to the judge, you big donut hole!\n\nBob: Yeah, tell it to your cellmate in Holsom!\n\nArnold: You didn't really mean all that, did you? You don't really love me, right?\n\nHelga: Right.\n\nArnold: You were caught up in the heat of the moment, right.\n\nHelga: Right!\n\nArnold: You actually hate me, don't you?\n\nHelga: Of course I hate you, you stupid football head, and don't you ever forget it! Ever!\n\n[at the end of the movie]\n\nArnold: Now you're looking on the bright side.\n\nGerald: Somebody has to.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nSpencer Klein as Arnold\n\nPaul Sorvino as Alphonse Perrier du von Scheck\n\nJennifer Jason Leigh as Bridget\n\nFrancesca Marie Smith as Helga Geraldine Pataki / Deep Voice\n\nJamil Walker Smith as Gerald Johanssen\n\nDan Castellaneta as Grandpa Phil, Nick Vermicelli, Jolly Olly Man\n\nTress MacNielle as Grandma Gertie, Mayor Dixie, Red\n\nChristopher Lloyd as Coroner\n\nMaurice LaMarche as Big Bob Pataki, Head of Security\n\nSam Gifaldi as Sid\n\nChristopher P.
