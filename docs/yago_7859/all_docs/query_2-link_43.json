To help, we’ve plucked out the 50 best films currently streaming on the service in the United States, updated regularly as titles come and go. And as a bonus, we link to more great movies on Netflix within many of our write-ups below. (Note: Streaming services sometimes remove titles or change starting dates without giving notice.)\n\nHere are our lists of the best TV shows on Netflix, the best movies on Amazon Prime Video and the best of everything on Hulu and Disney Plus.\n\n‘Collateral’ (2004)\n\nWhat could have been a formulaic action flick is transformed into an unpredictable, introspective two-hander, thanks to the moody direction of Michael Mann and the thrilling performances of its leads. Go-to good guy Tom Cruise is frighteningly convincing as a businesslike contract killer, the kind of villain who never raises his voice and always gets the job done; Jamie Foxx is sympathetic as a cabby who becomes a combination of chauffeur and hostage. The best moments in “Collateral” are the quiet ones, in which these two desperate and disparate characters contemplate their stations in life, and their limited options for change. “Mann makes thrillers the way that John Ford made westerns,” our critic wrote, “using genre as a way into meaning rather than as an escape.”\n\nWatch on Netflix"
