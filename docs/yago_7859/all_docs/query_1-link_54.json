        "text": "Ernst Toller, the pastor at the center of First Reformed, is a deeply unsettled leader of a church that hardly anyone attends. Played by Ethan Hawke, Toller starts a daily diary to record his observations and insecurities, reasoning that the text can function as an open prayer to God. By drawing attention to Toller’s journal, director Paul Schrader is able to illustrate the quiet torment that many a stoic soul has likely faced. But later, when First Reformed depicts Toller’s attraction to political extremism, the movie adopts the logic of an absurd thriller, dashing its potential as a believable rumination on spiritual struggle.\n\nThe kookiness of First Reformed kicks into gear when Toller meets Michael, the deranged husband of a pregnant woman named Mary. Michael wants Mary to have an abortion, as he believes it would be wrong to bring a kid into a world that will be irrevocably damaged by climate change. Michael then stumps Toller when he asks the minister if God can forgive humankind for the harm it has brought to the planet. Toller can’t bring himself to say, “Yes.” That he failed to utter the simple answer, which any believer would know, is a sign that Toller has lost his way.\n\nMichael soon blows his head off with a gun. Toller, while shocked by the suicide at first, appears to tacitly identify with Michael’s fatalistic point of view, growing more curious about a bomb-laden vest that Michael devised. This is when First Reformed throws credibility to the wayside. The viewer is supposed to believe that Toller, in a very short period of time, would buy into Michael’s particular worldview, so much that he would consider wearing the leftover suicide vest himself to kill a congregation.\n\nTo his credit, Schrader establishes an intriguing dichotomy between how Mary and Michael affect Toller’s sensibilities. The characters’ names here are important. Mary, of course, brings to mind the mother of Jesus Christ. This association is interesting because Toller is part of a Protestant faith, which doesn’t focus on Mary as much as the Catholic faith. Mary seemingly brings a sense of clarity or wholeness to Toller that he wasn’t finding in his church, as suggested when the two engage in a non-sexual bonding ritual of sorts. The name Michael, on the other hand, recalls God’s famous archangel. In chapter 12 of the book of Daniel in the Bible, Michael is said to come during a “time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation.” In line with this passage, Michael in First Reformed introduces Toller to the most troubled time of his existence. Even during his intimate rite with Mary, Toller can’t push away visions of a ruined natural world.\n\nAs fascinating as Mary and Michael’s influence on Toller is, it’s difficult to accept Toller’s plan to kill himself and churchgoers over climate change as a logical outcome of his spiritual predicament. Such a plot twist implies that Schrader wanted to spice up Ingmar Bergman’s Winter Light, which involved a similar pastor in doubt, with the frightening possibility of political violence—the threat of which is a source of post-9/11 anxiety. At one point after trying on Michael’s suicide vest for the first time, Toller observes, “I have found another form of prayer.” The backdrop for this realization is an ominous landscape with a rusted ship and purple sunset. While Schrader’s imagery here is stunning, Toller’s dialogue comes off as a convenient, contrived way to justify his transition from religious backsliding to terrorist philosophy. It’s simply not convincing.\n\nWhen Toller can’t go through with his murderous plot, he begins grunting like an animal and takes off his robe and shirt and wraps his torso in barbwire. As Toller pours himself a glass of drain cleaner, Schrader cuts to the church service that Toller was going to bomb, cynically highlighting a robotic vocal rendition of “Leaning on the Everlasting Arms.” Right before Toller can consume his deadly drink, Mary interrupts him, leading the two to a passionate embrace and kiss, complete with a showy circular pan, before the screen goes black. One gets the sense that with this abrupt ending, First Reformed intended to move from a sense of horror to one of intense relief. But given that Toller’s acceptance of political extremism seems preposterous in the first place, the entire scene is almost comical in how it desperately shifts from one dramatic point to the next, not unlike a Dan Brown novel.\n\nAs an action hero, Wesley Snipes is the total package. He uses Shotokan Karate and Hapkido to gorgeous and lethal effect. He delivers one-liners as if they were natural everyday speech. He seems like a guy you could have a beer with. Passenger 57 conveys all of this, but the film also doesn’t forget the impact of race.\n\nThis is not insignificant, as Passenger 57 is the very movie that made Snipes an action star with mass appeal, putting him in the same sphere with established names such as Sylvester Stallone (who would later perform with Snipes in 1993’s Demolition Man). Before Snipes’ breakthrough here, black action roles tended to be secondary if they were not associated with the blaxploitation movement. Despite being mainstream, Passenger 57 trumpets a certain realness about Snipes as an artist that has been underappreciated. With its hostage-killing terrorists and confined spaces, the movie is often thought of as another variation on Die Hard, and as a 1990s action flick on a plane, it could be compared to Con Air and Air Force One. These comparisons are limited in that Bruce Willis, Nicolas Cage, and Harrison Ford do not face the social obstacles that Snipes does in Passenger 57. And while the film’s most famous line, “Always bet on black,” makes direct hilarious reference to Snipes’ race, that dialogue doesn’t even begin to sum up how much of a role skin color plays in Passenger 57.\n\nIn the film, Snipes is an airline security expert named John Cutter who has landed a new counterterrorism job. Appropriately, he winds up on a plane with an actual terrorist (played by Bruce Payne). Before the fireworks start, so to speak, Cutter is mistaken for talk show host Arsenio Hall by an elderly white lady from L.A. It’s a clever comedic moment, as it hints at the fact that Cutter, who conceals his irritation from the woman sitting next to him, is not your average [white or Asian] action hero. (In an earlier scene, Cutter is told by another character that he would make “a hell of a Republican,” referring to the expectation that Cutter, because he is black, must be a certified Democrat.)\n\nOnce the action ramps up, so too does the emphasis on Cutter’s status in society. At one point the hijacked plane must land in Louisiana due to fuel loss. Cutter is seized by local authorities after he disembarks the plane. Despite his repeated claim that he’s in the business of airline security, Cutter is perceived as a suspect. The situation worsens thanks to Payne’s shrewd villain, who tells the cops via radio that the “black man” is a fellow terrorist.\n\nIt takes Cutter’s martial arts ability to ultimately free himself from the clutches of the sheriff’s department. But what happens next is Passenger 57’s greatest segment, where the film fully contextualizes Snipes’ particular trial as an action hero. Cutter begins chasing the lead terrorist and his stooges through a county fair. As has been the case for the entire movie, the overwhelming majority of people around Cutter are white. But in the intensity of the chase, the largely white crowd here carries significant metaphorical power, as it becomes obvious that Cutter is not only physically navigating through individuals to catch the bad guy—he’s having to navigate a social order just to have a shot at stopping the bad guy. This message is further driven home when Confederate flags can be seen in the background as Cutter jumps off a Ferris wheel and carries on with his pursuit.\n\nAfter an absurd ride on a merry-go-round and another trip into the sky, Cutter finally emerges the victor, ceremoniously kicking the terrorist villain out of the plane. Snipes the action sensation was solidified with this climax, as beforehand the actor had mainly starred in dramas and comedies. And yet the conclusion of Passenger 57 still has fun with the fact that Snipes is not your prototype star that dominated high-profile action movies for so long. The same elderly white lady from L.A. thanks Cutter in the plane for his heroism by leading a “Woof! Woof! Woof!” chant among the passengers, forever connecting Snipes’ ascension to action-movie legend with the Arsenio Hall Show.\n\nMany noteworthy Italian pictures of the 1960s and 1970s are critiques of bourgeoisie culture to some degree. Works by Fellini, Antonioni, Pasolini, Ferreri, and others present high living as risible, discomfiting, and revolting. So on one level, it’s natural that the debut of Marco Bellocchio, Fists in the Pocket, often receives the same anti-bourgeoisie label as movies like La Dolce Vita and La Grande Bouffe. But even if Bellocchio wanted Fists in the Pocket to be a damning indictment of a privileged class, the unpleasant mental and emotional illness of the young male protagonist takes center stage to the extent that the film—rather than make a coherent point about culture—wallows in sensational, unfunny misery.\n\nFists in the Pocket concerns a family without a father. There’s a blind mother and four children, three of which are young men, with the oldest, Augusto, maintaining his status as the de factor leader of the household through abuse and manipulation. One of the other brothers, Alessandro, is the lead character who develops an infatuation with the idea of killing family members to make life easier, particularly for Augusto, who wishes to marry and move out.\n\nFists in the Pocket is like an energetic, demented riff on the Ingmar Bergman family drama, where Alessandro’s plot to murder his not-so-loved ones gradually becomes a reality. If we are to interpret Fists in the Pocket as critical of the bourgeoisie, sympathy for the killer seems required. We must pity Alessandro and somehow see the intended “altruism” in his murders in order to find a larger meaning in the film’s proceedings—namely, that the institutions of family and religion are impotent at best when it comes to reducing the potential for tragedy.\n\nThis type of interpretation doesn’t hold up. The family situation in Fists in the Pocket is over the top with face slaps, gross negligence, and downright hatefulness, but it’s presented without clear cultural and political context. Bellocchio is good at shocking one’s senses with familial turmoil and intrigue, but his jabs at religion are beside the point—unlike the case in Luis Bunuel’s Simon of the Desert, where critique of Christian norms is inseparable from the film’s purpose—and nowhere near as visually unforgettable as the statue of Mother Mary hanging from a helicopter in Fellini’s La Dolce Vita.\n\nIt’s almost as if you have to buy into a presumptuous type of contempt for certain segments of society so that Fists in the Pocket can register as outstanding cinema. Perhaps what some fans of this movie aren’t completely admitting is their fascination with the freeing possibilities of deviant violent behavior. A fetish for impending destruction is exactly what gives aimless and trapped Alessandro a reason for being. And as terrifying as Alessandro’s actions are, he doesn’t leap into depravity like someone diving into a pool; instead, he dips his toe into the water at first, displaying the curiosity of a cat when it comes to extinguishing a family member’s existence.\n\nThis level of humanization that Bellacchio affords Alessandro as he goes through with his hellacious deeds makes the repulsive material in Fists in the Pocket more palatable for voyeurs. The most disturbing scene of Fists in the Pocket involves no violence against kin, though. I’m referring to the ending that shows Alessandro convulsing and groaning on the floor as an emphatic opera record plays. If you give Alessandro the benefit of a doubt, he’s having a seizure. There’s also an interpretation that perceives an exorcism in this scene. What I see is an egomaniac volunteering his body for a horrific display of chaos and upheaval. Fists in the Pocket’s flirtations with darkness seem more like the beginnings of a nihilistic fad in popular entertainment rather than anything approaching critical, valuable thought.\n\n1. Lars von Trier – Imagine the brashness of Quentin Tarantino without funny dialogue or popular appeal, and you may begin to grasp how Lars von Trier pushes people’s buttons. Even in a film with spiritual considerations like Breaking the Waves, von Trier has a one-dimensional, cynical perception of what makes human beings tick. His thinking often seems too silly to be shocking, which is the intended effect. More than anything, his work is gimmicky from a visual standpoint. From the piss-colored imagery of The Element of Crime to the mixture of color and black-and-white in Europa to the artificial stage design of Dogville, it’s as if von Trier chooses unconventional approaches just because he can, not because they’re impressive, imaginative, or necessary.\n\n2. Peter Jackson – Mainstream movie culture was soiled by Peter Jackson’s fanboyish desire to elaborate upon everything. Jackson might as well have made a deal with the devil when he turned The Hobbit, a breezier read than The Lord of the Rings, into three long films. Earlier in the century, the bloated and pointless Return of the King won numerous awards despite its infamously exhausting ending, which I think about every time I’m watching a movie that doesn’t know when or how to conclude. And King Kong was abominable Spielberg wannabe-ism if I’ve ever seen it. The quality of Jackson’s earlier work (Dead Alive, Heavenly Creatures) prevents him from taking the top spot on this list.\n\n3. Steven Soderbergh – I don’t think the Solaris remake is as bad as some people make it out to be. Ocean’s Eleven, while superfluous, is a pretty entertaining way to kill some time. And isn’t it true that Soderbergh has directed a wide variety of stuff? But when variety leads one from Sex, Lies, and Videotape, which was not as scandalous as its title suggests, to The Good German, one of the worst movies of the 2000s, should we not question what the overall point of his filmography is? Throwing everything but the kitchen sink at audiences might temporarily placate the postmodern world’s addiction to content, but Soderbergh’s approach turns the movies into a disposable art form.\n\n4. David Fincher – If there’s one thing David Fincher wants to advertise, it’s that he’s a DARK, DARK director. Alien 3 has a more nihilistic tone than Alien, Aliens, and Alien: Resurrection, and Seven employs such gruesome ideas that one is likely relieved that Fincher chooses to focus on the aftermaths of the film’s serial killings. But for such a DARK, DARK director, he sure can be overly conventional, as demonstrated by the largely ho-hum camera angles in The Social Network; the needless attention on brands, such as McDonald’s fast food, in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo; the use of the beyond-trite “hallucinations of a mentally unstable protagonist” plot twist in Fight Club; and the depiction of crazy bitch syndrome in Gone Girl. Perhaps darkness = convention?\n\n5. James Cameron – James Cameron directed action very well before he became the ultimate high-tech people pleaser with Titanic and Avatar. I’ve had a lifelong affinity for the Terminator series and other Arnold Schwarzenegger vehicles like True Lies, but when you consider that many less-celebrated directors (John McTiernan, Paul Verhoeven, John Milius) have done just as well with Ahnuld stealing the show, Cameron doesn’t seem as special of a filmmaker. What strikes me, too, is how relatively vapid his movies can be notwithstanding their grand appearance. Aliens is a rip-roaring flick, but it has none of the psychological or cultural power of its predecessor Alien. Granted, the aim of Aliens is much different than that of Alien, but ultimately I don’t find myself thinking about Aliens all that much at this point in my life. Cameron, at his best, is as limited as he is effective.\n\n6. Richard Linklater – Although he deserves some credit for his occasional populist leanings and a willingness to experiment, Richard Linklater has a habit of making dull movies. Take Boyhood, which walks in the footsteps of Francois Truffaut’s Antoine Doinel tales. Linklater records the same actor over the course of years to capture the idea of growing up, but the boy in question is patently uninteresting. I often ask myself why anyone would want to follow some of Linklater’s characters, as the only thing worse than watching an aimless example of naturalism like Before Sunrise is imagining one’s self having conversations with these fictional snooze-inducing people.\n\n7. Quentin Tarantino – Quentin Tarantino changed movies with Pulp Fiction, and 2019’s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is the most culturally incisive picture the director has ever produced. But so much of Tarantino’s recent work doesn’t stand the test of time, whether because the movie in question is tiresomely unoriginal (Kill Bill), nothing more than a simple novelty (Death Proof), or akin to a guilty white teenager’s version of American history with assists from spaghetti westerns and John Woo theatrics (Django Unchained). Also, I get it! He loves movies. Don’t most of us?\n\n8. Spike Lee – Spike Lee is a frustrating artist. Sometimes he’s electric and uncompromising, as with Do the Right Thing and Bamboozled. Other times, he can’t generate as much energy because of clumsy or pedestrian concepts, as with Inside Man and Clockers. BlacKkKlansman was the final confirmation that Lee is most definitely overrated. For such a provocatively titled movie, BlacKkKlansman leans away from the fascinating history of the original book and panders to people who think they’re woke with fantasy elements like a racist cop dramatically getting what he deserves in the end.\n\n9. Hayao Miyazaki – One can’t deny Hayao Miyazaki is an important figure in Japanese animation, but if you listen too much of the hype, you would think he’s the greatest anime director of all time, and he’s not. That distinction should go to Miyazaki’s fellow Studio Ghibli artist Isao Takahata, and visionaries like Katsuhiro Otomo and Satoshi Kon are part of the discussion, too. Besides that, some of Miyazaki’s films, while solid, are not exactly revelations (Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind, Howl’s Moving Castle, Ponyo). And Princess Mononoke remains the most overrated anime film for its tediously delivered message about the environment.\n\n10. Martin Scorsese – Without a doubt, Martin Scorsese is the most accomplished director on this list. Movies like Raging Bull, The Last Temptation of Christ, and Taxi Driver have rightfully cemented their place in film history. But later in his career, Scorsese has been less awe-inspiring as a storyteller and even sort of clueless at times. Scorsese regurgitated the same type of fashionable, quasi-critical decadence multiple times (Goodfellas, Casino, The Wolf of Wall Street) before he released The Irishman, which had good intentions but came far too late, as other movies (Once Upon a Time in America, The Godfather Part III, The Funeral, Pain & Gain) had already provoked similar reflections on what it means to be a male criminal for life (i.e., an idiot of sorts). It’s also still dumb-founding that Scorsese bothered with Shutter Island, whose seen-it-a-billion-times-before plot twist is the sort of thing I would expect from an amateur or a hack, not an all-time great like he truly is.\n\nNote: This review is based on the 105-minute U.S. version of the film.\n\nThe moral of the martial arts movie Fearless is not so different than the prediction of Christ in Matthew 5:5: “Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.” Or at least, becoming merciful or gentle appears to be the whole point of Fearless if you judge the story by the personal evolution of its protagonist Huo Yuanjia (played by Jet Li), who represents two different meanings of the word “fearless”—the first meaning associated with ambition, the second with grace. The transformation of Huo is followed, however, by larger-than-life international conflict, where countries prove their worth by sending their men to win fights. In the ideological dressing of the film’s ending, Huo’s philosophical journey, where he rejects his base desires to walk in the footsteps of his honorable father, is justified not because it makes him spiritually whole, but because it leads him to his legendary status as a symbol of China’s superior cultural strength.\n\nDirector Ronny Yu—who, interestingly, was behind the camera for Bride of Chucky (1998) and Jason vs. Freddy (2003)—is straightforward but effective with how he constructs the melodrama of Fearless, largely tying Huo’s development as a character to the concept of “face” in Chinese culture. After Huo as a young boy watches his father, a martial arts master, intentionally lose a fight in front of a large crowd, he wants to prove that his family isn’t worthless, and so he sets out to be the most dominant and ruthless fighter in the nation, a sort of Michael Jordan of early 20th-century China. Huo’s mother tries to tell Huo that his fighting style, wushu, is about self-restraint, but Huo hates losing, as illustrated when he prays at his father’s grave, telling his departed dad that his fist wasn’t fast enough.\n\nThrough visual technique and metaphor, Huo’s passion for winning is tied to alcohol and more specifically the notion of being drunk on power. During one moment, Huo seems to experience an auditory hallucination in which a crowd cheers him on, with dizzying camerawork implying drunkenness. In the pivotal scene where Huo childishly picks a fight in his friend’s restaurant, the brawl makes its way into a wine cellar, and the two combatants get bathed in wine as they continue their property-destroying tirade. Afterward Huo celebrates victory with his men, their shadows bustling about like drunkards. Later, when Huo sees the corpses of his mother and daughter—the result of his selfish and aggressive behavior—he’s not far removed from an inebriated driver shocked to find himself near dead bodies.\n\nFearless then takes a dramatic detour that borders on Christian storytelling, with multiple shots of Huo being in and around water, trumpeting his baptism and moral conversion. With slow motion, Yu especially fetishizes the water that a blind woman (a cliche in stories of redemption) uses to wash Huo’s hair. Huo comes to understand why his father chose to not obliterate his opponent and, instead, allow him to win. The martial artist eventually confesses sin at his daughter’s grave: “I was not a good father.”\n\nIt’s after this miraculous change within Huo that Fearless ratchets up a sense of political anxiety rooted in actual Chinese history. The film’s depiction of an imperialistic presence of British, American, Japanese, and other forces in Shanghai points to China’s need for a champion who can defeat anyone in martial combat. The British and American characters here are one-dimensional, which is not surprising or offensive, but their cartoonish qualities are striking considering the movie’s otherwise serious vibe. The caricatures are intentional, in that they help build the narrative that China, even when vulnerable or seemingly down and out, passes the eye test better than other countries.\n\nHuo’s final opponent, Tanaka, is Japanese. Fearless doesn’t stereotype Tanaka but rather reveals an understated connection between Huo and Tanaka, reflecting similarities in communication and values between Asian cultures. The movie is decidedly not pro-Japan, despite this nicety. Though Tanaka isn’t obliterated by Huo’s punches and kicks, he faces a more profound defeat than the Westerners in that he is deeply compelled to announce that Huo is the better man—which, in this case, also makes Huo the better patriot of a better country. After the national heroes are forced to submit to or acknowledge Huo’s greatness, we’re left with the realization that Huo justifies his existence as an extension of China’s pride. The takeaway is this: if Huo hadn’t restored China, his newfound morality wouldn’t have mattered, and Jet Li’s Fearless wouldn’t have been made.\n\nA Ship Bound for India is among the worst Ingmar Bergman films, but you wouldn’t know that just by sight. Compared to Crisis (which was shot well enough), A Ship Bound for India is a step forward visually, partly due to the fact that the film takes place around water, which allows Bergman to capture richly detailed imagery, such as the ruggedness of a rocky beach, that the more confined settings of Crisis could not afford. A Ship Bound for India has been doomed to obscurity, however, for a melodramatic script that is clumsy at best and irresponsible at worst with how it presents the relationship between the two young leads, Birger Malmsten and Gertrud Fidh.\n\nJohannes (Malmsten) works for his father, Captain Blom, who runs a marine salvage business. Blom epitomizes the horrible father role, as he verbally and physically abuses both Johannes and his spouse Alice, and is planning to sail away with Sally (Fidh), a mistress many years younger than him. In addition to ridiculing Johannes for having a hump on his back, Blom humiliates his son in front of Sally by talking to him as if he’s five years old.\n\nThe actors’ performances are solid enough, but the script loses its way once it begins to dole out poetic justice to Blom by having Johannes and Sally fall in love. Simply put, the romance is anything but hot between these two supposed lovebirds. Shortly after meeting Sally, Johannes turns to alcohol after Blom slaps him in the face with a glove, the ultimate disrespect. Johannes tries to take advantage of Sally as she yells and struggles. His own mother interrupts him before he can begin the vile deed, what Johannes describes as “the beauty and the freak.”\n\nThe next day, Sally casually forgives Johannes. The two behave as if nothing happened the previous night, and they start running around like old high-school sweethearts. (Bergman attempts to drive home the “love at second sight” pretense with dramatic music, but it’s such an obvious trick that betrays the intelligence of the legendary director.) Now, perhaps one can explain this absurd 180-degree turn by the fact that Sally doesn’t often think highly of herself, but the lack of meaningful conversation about Johannes’ aggressiveness functions as a distraction from the ensuing sweet moments of the affair. It doesn’t help that Malmsten and Fidh fail to gel as actors. The couple’s first kiss on the floor is incredibly staged with extraordinary lighting, but the romantic act comes across as a cold process.\n\nThe poor chemistry between the lovers is most apparent in the concluding scene. Sally has one of her many self-hating outbursts in this segment, telling Johannes that there’s no point to them being together, but Johannes chases Sally, even busting through a door to get near her. Sally finally breaks, “If you want me, you can have me.” Johannes’ next line reveals a man who is not aware one iota of his own flaws: “I must say, there’s never a dull moment with you.” A Ship Bound for India preposterously thinks Johannes’ creepster behavior warrants happy-ending music. And Bergman, usually keen about the darkness that lurks in humanity, seems like a clueless guy just making a movie."
