        "text": "The gang gets together and talk about the goriest movies they have ever seen. We got zombies rampaging in New Zealand, robots machine gunning business men, an Italian movie would couldn't even show clips of, and a shape shifting alien that is basically gore come to life. James even goes into a brief history of gore in cinema. Find out what him, Justin, Kieran, and Tony from Hack The Movies consider the goriest films they have ever seen.\n\nThis week James and the gang talk about what action movies they think are underrated. See James talk about how the the action trio the DRAGONS will kick ass FOREVER. Listen to Justin talk about his taste for WASABI. Get in the passenger seat with Kieran as he brings up a movie that's more his SPEED! And stick around until the end so Tony can give you the RUNDOWN on the best action movie ever!\n\nJoysticks (1983) is one of the first video game movies ever. Sure, it's about an arcade, but it's mostly about the awful slobs that run the arcade. Anything video game related just proves how much the writers didn't know about games. Though, it's great to see Joe Don Baker.\n\nWhat's the best Indiana Jones movie? Raiders of the Lost Ark or Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. They're basically the same film beat for beat, one's just more shiny and the other more classic. Tough decision, but the goons at Cinemassacre Video are here to answer it in this Rental Review!\n\nActors often get recasted in movies and TV. But here's our picks for the strangest, most weird recastings. From budget issues to actors just not melding well with their crews, almost every long running series will be forced to recast their actors. From Batman, to Iron Man, to Family Matters, to yes, even Twin Peaks. Even Rental Reviews is getting recasted! (thankfully)\n\nRoad House. The best movie ever... and the worst movie ever. It's about Dalton (Patrick Swayze), the best bouncer for hire in the country, who must clean up a bar called the Double Deuce. There's drinking, romance, explosions, and bare-knuckle fist fights. Plus, everyone loves Sam Elliot. Sadly Kieran will not be in this episode, but you'll get to find out what Tony calls Road House his favorite movie.\n\nThe Running Man takes place in the dark dystopian future of 2019. The gang watches this movie starring Arnold Schwarzenegger and talks about the crazy premise, over the top characters, and if any of its predictions of the future came true? They also pick apart some of the most ridiculous one liners Arnold has ever delivered. How would you rank this movie and who is your favorite stalker in the movie? NOTE: We forgot to mention it in the review but this movie was Written by Steven E. de Souza who's movies we have talked about before and directed by Paul Michael Glaser who played Starsky in Starsky and Hutch.\n\nPrepare yourself! ...for the other Mortal Kombat movie from 1995... that nobody wanted! On this episode of Cinemassacre Rental Reviews the guys Test Their Might against Mortal Kombat: The Journey Begins. It's a 3D and 2D animated movie that came out before the live action film. It was supposed to be a tie-in for the movie, but doesn't make any sense and looks like garbage. The 3D animated Reptile in the real movie looks better.\n\nWith Endgame finally here, we decided on a spoiler free reflection on the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) as a whole. But, why does James only like the individual Marvel movies and not The Avengers? Kieran certainly does. Justin barely cares about anything, but he likes the Avengers. There's been 21 movies over a decade, it's basically the Star Wars of this generation.\n\nOn this episode of Rental Reviews we'll take you back to the past, before rental stores, to the early 20th century... for a Three Stooges Retrospective! If you don't already know, The Three Stooges were a comedy team (american vaudeville) that created tons of shorts from 1922 until 1970. In their almost 200 film run, there were a ton of classic physical farce and slapstick moments that are still funny to this day. James, Tony, and Kieran will talk about Moe, Larry, and Curly... plus the other more forgotten members of this titanic comedy tour de force.\n\nThe Fifth Element! The greatest movie ever made, that James feels indifferent about. Hmm, guess Tony and Justin will have to find out why in today's Cinemassacre Rental Review! This 1997 Sci-fi action comedy follows Korben Dallas (Bruce Willis) and Leeloo (Milla Jovovich) on their adventure to return the Fifth Element to a shrine to save the universe against evil.\n\nLast Action Hero! Arnold Schwarzenegger's best action film, because it parodies all his other action films. It's the story of young Danny Madigan getting sucked into the fictional Jack Slater films using a magic movie ticket. But he should watch out for the evil villain Benedict (Charles Dance from Game of Thrones). Danny and Jack must band together to save both their worlds. In today's review, James, Justin, and Kieran will guide you through Last Action Hero and why it's so popular, yet underrated.\n\nThe sequel to Godzilla (2014) is here. Godzilla: King of the Monsters! This sequel offered more monsters and ties together the MonsterVerse. James, Kieran, and Tony discuss and review the film. James went in with a list of things he wanted to see, let’s see how that turned out. Spoiler alert: Not well.\n\nThe Spice Girls were a huge pop group in the 90s, which led to them getting a debut feature film, Spice World, in 1997. Special guest Erin Plays!! The Spice Girls consisted of Emma Bunton (Baby Spice), Geri Halliwell (Ginger Spice), Melanie Brown (Scary Spice), Melanie Chisholm (Sporty Spice) and Victoria Addams (Posh Spice). But I guess James didn't get the Girl Power memo and needs Erin from Erin Plays and Justin to fill him in. Tony sat this one out, per usual! ...or did he??\n\nR.O.T.O.R. (AKA Blue Steel) is what happens when you try to mix Robocop with The Terminator but cut the budget by A LOT! James and the gang talk about probably the least effective worst killer cyborg they have ever seen. Enjoy the awful dubbing, Ed Wood style editing, and the slowest martial art ever seen. Side Note: This is Kieran's favorite Christmas movie.\n\nCome on down to Cinemassacre Video!! Well, the Live panel anyway. James, Justin, Kieran, and Tony put on a panel at TooManyGames 2019. But what movie did they show? Well, a bunch. This is technically a clip show, but they show you the clips.\n\nPlan 9 from Outer Space is celebrating it's 60th Anniversary, so we decided to do a review! It's also the one year anniversary of Rental Reviews, so we went back to our original four person style. Plan 9 is Ed Wood's most popular film from 1959, that most people consider the worst movie ever made.\n\nDumb and Dumber is up for review this week at Cinemassacre Video! It's the comedic cross-country story of two good-hearted but incredibly stupid friends. It came out in 1994 and was directed by Peter Farrelly. Starring Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels, it tells the story of Lloyd Christmas (Carrey) and Harry Dunne (Daniels), two dumb but well-meaning friends from Providence, Rhode Island, who set out on a cross-country trip to Aspen, Colorado, to return a briefcase full of money to its owner, thinking it was abandoned as a mistake but was actually left as ransom money.\n\nOn this episode of Rental Reviews, the guys at Cinemassacre video review the first Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles film, which closely follows the storyline from the Mirage comic books, in addition to some of the more lighthearted elements of the cartoons. The film tells the origin story of Splinter and the Turtles, their initial encounters with April O'Neil (Judith Hoag) and Casey Jones (Elias Koteas), and their first confrontation with The Shredder and his Foot Clan. The first sequel, titled Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze, expands on the Turtles' origin story while claiming the distinction as Vanilla Ice's film debut.\n\nDuel was one of Steven Spielberg's earliest films. It came out in 1971 and is definitely a precursor to Jaws. The chase scenes anyway. It's basically Jaws, if it was about a truck instead of a shark. David Mann (Dennis Weaver), a mild mannered electronics salesman, is driving cross-country on a two-lane highway when he encounters an old oil tanker driven by an unseen driver who seems to enjoy annoying him with dangerous antics on the road. Unable to escape the demonic big rig, David finds himself in a dangerous game of cat and mouse with the monstrous truck. When the pursuit escalates to deadly levels, David must summon his inner warrior and turn the tables on his tormentor.\n\nTrue Lies is a 1994 American action comedy thriller about a fearless, globe-trotting, bad guy-battling secret agent that has his life turned upside down when he discovers his wife might be having an affair with a used car salesman while bad guys smuggle nukes into the United States. It was written, directed, and co-produced by James Cameron. It stars Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jamie Lee Curtis, Tom Arnold, Art Malik, Tia Carrere, Bill Paxton (the Dinkster), Eliza Dushku, Grant Heslov and Charlton Heston.\n\nWelcome to the inaugural episode of Retail Reviews!! Mike Matei is getting ready to open his game store and had Ryan and Kieran stop by to help set up.

(other familiar faces coming soon)\n\nIn the summer of 1962, a new kid in town is taken under the wing of a young baseball prodigy and his rowdy team.

He narrowly escapes the manhunt, but it will take his former commander to save the hunters from the hunted.\n\nWhat's better? Jurassic Park 2 or 3? Today on Rental Reviews the guys argue over what the best Jurassic Park sequel is. Tony is going with JP3. Let's see how wrong he truly is!! The Lost World: Jurassic Park is a 1997 American science fiction adventure film and the second installment in the Jurassic Park film series. Whereas, Jurassic Park III is the 2001 third installment and sequel to The Lost World.\n\nIt's a Blob VS. Blob showdown at \"Cinemassacre Video 2\" today. The Blob (1958) was a drive-in favorite, this sci-fi classic follows teenagers Steve (Steven McQueen) and his best girl, Jane (Aneta Corseaut), as they try to protect their hometown from a gelatinous alien life form that engulfs everything it touches. 30 years later, in 1988, a remake was created. In that film, in a tiny California town, high school students discover a strange, gelatinous substance that melts the flesh of any living creatures in its path. So basically the same thing, just expanded. Get it? Expanded? Like THE BLOB???!\n\nA group of young shopping mall employees stay behind for a late night party in one of the stores. When the mall goes on lock-down before they can get out, the robot security system malfunctions, and goes on a killing spree. See what James, Justin and Kieran have to say about this ridiculous film.

Two Brooklyn plumbers, Mario and Luigi, must travel to another dimension to rescue a princess from the evil dictator King Koopa and stop him from taking over the world. Is it all bad or is there some good to be found in this film?\n\nThe future is now! Blade Runner takes place a week from this episode of Rental Reviews airing. (Nov 20, 2019) So, we decided to finally review this film. Blade Runner is a 1982 science fiction film directed by Ridley Scott,,and is loosely based on Philip K. Dick's novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? (1968). In the movie Deckard (Harrison Ford) is forced by the police Boss to continue his old job as Replicant Hunter.

Clark's continual bad luck is worsened by his obnoxious family guests, but he manages to keep going knowing that his Christmas bonus is due soon.\n\nIt's the Year 2000 (+20) on this episode of Rental Reviews. James, Kieran, and Justin jump back 20 years to when Y2K was an actual computer bug that many people were worried about. Well, worried enough to spend millions fixing the problem and selling VHS tapes to scare people at home. Think of the 2012 end of the world scare, but way worse. People were even doing prepper type stuff by collecting food, water, and the basic essentials when the world shut down.\n\nWelcome to Cinemassacre Rental Reviews' Febru-Carrey. Four Jim Carrey movies all February long. While his later films are good, Ace Ventura was how most were introduced to Jim Carrey and his famous style of comedy to the screen. When the dolphin mascot of Miami's NFL team is abducted, Ace Ventura (Jim Carrey), a zany private investigator who specializes in finding missing animals, looks into the case. Soon Miami Dolphins players are kidnapped too, including star player Dan Marino (Dan Marino), making Ace's sleuth work even more pressing. Working with Dolphins representative Melissa Robinson (Courteney Cox), Ace closes in on the culprits, but not before many ridiculous misadventures.\n\nWelcome to Cinemassacre Rental Reviews' Febru-Carrey. Four Jim Carrey movies all February long. The Truman Show (1998) is the film people remember when thinking of Carrey's more serious roles outside of slapstick comedy.

Executive producer Christof (Ed Harris) orchestrates \"The Truman Show,\" a live broadcast of Truman's every move captured by hidden cameras.

Unfortunately, under the mask's influence, Ipkiss also robs a bank, which angers junior crime lord Dorian Tyrell (Peter Greene), whose goons get blamed for the heist.\n\nWelcome to Cinemassacre Rental Reviews' Febru-Carrey. Four Jim Carrey movies all February long. This week the gang does Man on the Moon. The movie traces Andy Kaufman's (Jim Carrey) steps from childhood through the comedy clubs and television appearances that made him famous, including his memorable appearances on Saturday Night Live, Late Night with David Letterman, Fridays, and his role as Latka Gravas on the sitcom Taxi, which was popular among viewers but disruptive for Kaufman's co-stars. The film pays particular attention to the various inside jokes, scams, put-ons, and happenings for which Kaufman was famous, most significantly his long-running feud with wrestler Jerry \"The King\" Lawler and his portrayal of the bawdy lounge singer Tony Clifton.\n\nIt's a Jackie Chan Drunken Double Feature!! Today the guys review Drunken Master 1 and 2.

Flash Gordon is the hero of a space opera adventure comic strip created by and originally drawn by Alex Raymond. First published January 7, 1934. It inspired George Lucas to make Star Wars after he couldn't get the rights to Flash Gordon... but after Star Wars became wildly popular a modern Flash Gordon film was made in 1980. In the film, NASA scientists are claiming the unexpected eclipse and strange \"hot hail\" are nothing to worry about, Dr. Hans Zarkov (Topol) knows better, and takes football star Flash Gordon (Sam Jones) and travel agent Dale Arden (Melody Anderson) with him into space to rectify things.

With the help of a race of Hawkmen, Flash and the gang struggle to save their home planet.\n\nCinemassacre reviews Born Free in this Rental Review. Born Free (1966) is the heartwarming true story of a British couple who teach their pet lioness how to survive in the wilds of the African jungles. Joy and George Adamson (portrayed by real-life married couple Virginia McKenna and Bill Travers) involuntarily domesticate several lions while living in Kenya. They keep one, named Elsa, until she is fully grown, and rather than turn her over to a zoo, they decide to train her to live like a wild animal so that they can release her into her natural habitat. Geoffrey Keen is a sympathetic government official who convinces the Adamsons that they should set Elsa free to avoid being ordered to place her in captivity. The film, based on Joy Adamson's book, is poignant and emotional without ever becoming banal or overly sentimental. The title song and film score both won Academy Awards.\n\nCinemassacre reviews Dennis The Menace on Rental Reviews. In Dennis The Menace (1993) mischievous Dennis Mitchell (Mason Gamble) makes the life of neighbor George Wilson (Walter Matthau) miserable with his overactive energy and inadvertent troublemaking.

But when burglar Switchblade Sam (Christopher Lloyd) breaks in to steal George's gold coin collection, he takes Dennis as a hostage, and crusty George must save the boy.\n\nCinemassacre reviews Night Killer (Italian: Non aprite quella porta 3). It's a 1990 Italian horror film directed by Claudio Fragasso. On its release in Italy, it was promoted as being part of the The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. The film is not part of the series and bears little content from the previously released films. In the movie, a serial killer with a rubber-like Freddy Krueger mask terrifies the city of Virginia Beach.\n\nIn this episode of Cinemassacre's Rental Reviews, Justin and James review Drop Dead Fred from 1991. An unhappy housewife gets a lift from the return of her imaginary childhood friend, Drop Dead Fred.

He causes chaos around her home and neighborhood, but nobody can see him except her. When she grows up and has an emotional crisis, he returns to \"cheer her up\" in his own unique way, causing more chaos than ever before. The supporting cast included Carrie Fisher, Ron Eldard, Tim Matheson, and Bridget Fonda.\n\nIn this episode of Cinemassacre's Rental Reviews James, Justin and Kieran review G.I. Joe: The Movie from 1987, which capped off the first two seasons of the TV run. In the movie, G.I. Joe's Special Task Force finds its mission to preserve peace and freedom threatened by the evil Golobulus. Created at the height of the G.I. Joe craze in the 1980s, G.I. Joe: The Movie was intended as a theatrical release to be closely followed by The Transformers: The Movie. However, the G.I. Joe film encountered unexpected production delays which allowed the Transformers feature to be released first. Due to the poor box office performances of The Transformers: The Movie and My Little Pony: The Movie, G.I. Joe: The Movie was instead released direct-to-video as well as aired on television in syndication, first in feature-length format and later split into a five-part miniseries format as part of the series' syndication package.\n\nMORTALL KOMMBAAATTTTT!!! Mortal Kombat Legends: Scorpion's Revenge is a 2020 American direct-to-video adult animated martial arts film based on the Mortal Kombat franchise.

So, we decided to just review the classic original Top Gun. The Top Gun Naval Fighter Weapons School is where the best of the best train to refine their elite flying skills. When hotshot fighter pilot Maverick (Tom Cruise) is sent to the school, his reckless attitude and cocky demeanor put him at odds with the other pilots, especially the cool and collected Iceman (Val Kilmer). But Maverick isn't only competing to be the top fighter pilot, he's also fighting for the attention of his beautiful flight instructor, Charlotte Blackwood (Kelly McGillis).\n\nThe video store was a wild place in the 90s, every movie was trying to get your attention. So, a lot of companies went down the path of making their films look as crazy as possible. In this Cinemassacre Rental Reviews the guys found some of their favorites. Also, spoiler alert, this is the LAST episode of Rental Reviews. (It's also our 100th episode. Good spot to cap it off.) The guys are still working on the channel and their goal is to focus more on solid, scripted videos; from the reoccurring shows (like AVGN, YKWBS, and Retail Reviews) to new, one-off content like location tours, collections, and in-depth reviews. And if you're still craving Rental Reviews, we'll probably do some podcasts soon after we update the website. So, stay tuned... and thanks for watching these last two years!!!\n\nGreat. Star Wars Episode 9: The Rise of Skywalker. While setting up to film another batch of Rental Reviews we found out about the Episode 9 trailer premiering at Star Wars Celebration. So James, Kieran, and Tony sat down to talk about their thoughts on this movie and new Star Wars in general.\n\nIt is a very good time to be a Godzilla fan. The biggest Japanese monster of all time is getting his third American-made production on the big screens, internationally, with Godzilla: King of the Monsters (2019), finally with Mothra, Rodan and King Ghidorah. But if you wanna know what that’s all about and where it all came from, here's my top 5 picks for the new watcher.\n\nGodzilla vs Kong is right around the corner. But will it be too dark? There seems to be a growing cliche, that monsters usually fight in darkness and rain, such as the first two Legendary Pictures Godzilla films. It's my hope that Godzilla Vs Kong will give us some daytime fighting, like in Kong: Skull Island, and most of Godzilla's classic fights.\n\nIt may be March-al Arts but James and Tony didn't want to miss out on another Leprechaun review. So enjoy this bonus video for Leprechaun 2 and Happy St. Paddy's Day! A leprechaun (Warwick Davis) surfaces in Los Angeles to claim a bride, as his previous object of affection was denied to him a thousand years before in Ireland. He kidnaps teenager Bridget (Shevonne Durkin), grotesquely murdering anyone who gets in his way. It falls to Bridget's boyfriend, Cody (Charlie Heath), to rescue her. Cody enlists the aid of his perpetually tipsy uncle, Morty (Sandy Baron), who decides to go after the homicidal leprechaun's pot of gold.\n\nBob Ross is definitely one of my childhood heroes. He's probably the first person that got me into art, even before film making. For those who don't know, Bob Ross was an American painter, art instructor, and television host. He was the creator and host of The Joy of Painting, an instructional television program that aired from 1983 to 1994 on PBS in the United States, and also aired in Canada, Latin America, and Europe. Ross went from being a public television personality in the 1980s and 1990s to posthumously being an Internet celebrity in the 21st century, with his talent and kindness leading to major popularity with fans online many years after his death.\n\nTHE THING is an underrated classic. Oh, did you think I meant John Carpenter's The Thing from 1982?? No, I mean the Howard Hawks original film from 1951 called The Thing from Another World, which usually has been referred to as just \"The Thing\". It's an American black-and-white science fiction-horror film based on the 1938 novella Who Goes There? by John W. Campbell. In the movie, a U.S. Air Force crew and scientists find a crashed flying saucer and a humanoid body frozen in the Arctic ice. Returning to their remote research outpost with the body still in a block of ice, they are forced to defend themselves against the still alive and malevolent plant-based alien when it is accidentally defrosted.\n\nJames, Justin, and Kieran traveled to the last Blockbuster Video that's located in Bend, Oregon!! They took a road trip down from Portland, after Portland Retro Gaming Expo weekend October, 2019. The sights, sounds, and smells of their old stomping grounds was like something else. A flash from the past, where you would always go every Friday night to get the newest movie releases, hottest games, or obscure b-movie rentals. Sadly, Blockbuster's 9,000 world-wide locations dwindled down to just one. But, that comes with everything turning digital... or with movies just slapped into the Red Box at your local grocery store. Regardless, the Last Blockbuster in Bend is a tribute to anyone who lived in the 90s, especially with their museum section and classic memorabilia everywhere. Thanks to the owner Sandi for allowing us to film in the store! And, sorry that our audio isn't the best, the store is very active.\n\nHere are some forgotten film franchises that world has forgotten about. James sets up some criteria and goes over a ton of worthy contenders of the biggest franchises to be discontinued and rarely talked about today, and some that might be best forgotten. Even some with 40+ movies to their series. Enjoy this Cinemassacre review!\n\nRemember that scene in Troll 2, where the teens are watching that movie in their TV? It shows a guy in an ape costume touching a glowing egg, then getting shot in the air like a rocket! What with that? Well, that movie is called GRUNT from 1983, and it's some weird Italian caveman movie. Let's dive into the history of how I figured it out. Enjoy this Cinemassacre review!\n\nAqua Teen Hunger Force! One of my favorite shows in the early 2000s. It's about a trio of fast-food items that work together to solve mysteries in an edgy adult cartoon. The brains of the group is Frylock, a floating box of fries, but Master Shake does a lot of the talking, most of it aimed at making life miserable for Meatwad, a sweet-natured ball of meat. Recurring characters include neighbor Carl, supercilious Mooninites (lunar creatures) Ignigknot and Err, and mad scientists Dr. Weird and Steve. Enjoy this Cinemassacre review!"
