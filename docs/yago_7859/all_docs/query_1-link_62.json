        "text": "Yes, sigh! It's me again, Ms. Balogh -- I must confess your novels provoke almost a burden of superlatives in me and test every linguistic tool in my mental cupboard to express myself where your achievements are concerned. OK, I admit it -- I am a conceited, intellectual snob; I have an extremely high I.Q. from which I have derived enormous pride and pleasure ever since I encountered Thornton W. Burgess's Mrs. Peter Rabbit at age 8-9 [too bad this website doesn't furnish me with the italics I would otherwise use here -- and yes, I am also 'picky' about the marvels of the English language! But perish the thought that I might be criticizing you for that deficiency -- your website undoubtedly \"cost a pretty penny,\" deservedly so, and I am so grateful to you for it] and have delighted in feeding that mind with voracious reading ever since -- not just with reading and formal education (M.A. in Theatre* from one of this nation's great universities, UNIV. OF ILLINOIS Urbana-Champaign) but also extensive travel in this country, the British Isles and western Europe. And lest anyone scoff at the acquisition of a THEATRE* education, allow me to inform anyone and everyone that that subject encompasses all the cultural riches of western civilization (as well as much of that of Asia -- I did a paper on Oriental theatre in graduate school,) starting with the prehistoric cave paintings in Southern France. I have never found any companionship equal to the riches of my own beautiful, well-tended mind, although I would not have missed my two marriages for \"all the tea in China,\" for want of a better comparison! And by gosh and by golly -- NOBODY, BUT NOBODY can equal the stratospheric quality of Ms. Balogh's prodigious output on the period of exquisite intelligence, manners and customs that constitutes the English Regency. Ms. Balogh rightly chose that era for her expertise, to my unending delight. Lest I wander into the arena of the trite, I elect now to exit this message in order to return to the delights of my latest Balogh novel and the thoroughly scrumptious mental and emotional feast that Ms. Balogh never fails to deliver. [Sorry, Ms. Balogh, I simply cannot contain my gratitude and enthusiasm where your works are concerned. And believe me, I DO (italics, again) KNOW what agonizing labor crafting English and any other [well, I can do a very small bit of French -- just enough to appreciate the way interpreting a British heritage into smooth, satisfying prose can be -- not to minimize the creation and development of all your delicious characters! Sigh! There I go again, with what my teachers denounced as \"run-on\" sentences. Oh well, I suppose warning you \"not to look a gift horse in the mouth\" applies here . . . . Mm. Now for that cup of hot chocolate mixed with coffee that constitutes the ultimate \"pick-up\" for me, with the possible exception of my gin and tonic at the end of the day. Well, perhaps \"pick-up\" isn't the correct choice of words for G&T's soothing effects on my psyche. *I absolutely refuse to accept the way the low-lifes of the U.S. have chosen to denude our beautiful English words of their historical (Norman French) spellings and other marvels.\n\nHi Mary, I am in the process of re-doing my current website, done at a time when I was a different person. A different writer. I had just retired and was going to Ireland, specifically to research the area I had chosen as a setting for my first attempt at a self-published book, \"Mulligan's Dream\". My biggest mistake was my ignorance of the writing process, the need for professional editing, and also the need to have a website that really worked. I suppose my site worked for a while, but being extremely introverted, and gifted with ADHD, (a latent discovery), I had no clue how to go about anything. Fast forward eight years, and my writing style has changed considerably. I no longer write contemporary, having found my love of historical novels first by reading your books and those of Stephanie Laurens and the like, and also by the topic of my fourth book, \"A Winter Sky\". The heroine of that book is psychic, and falls into a past life, set at Ballycarbery Castle at Bosses Point, County Kerry. I knew I had to visit in order to write this series as each story uses Ballycarbery Castle in some way! My retirement trip was a godsend, helped by a friend's ex-husband who had moved back to Kerry after their divorce. Thanks to his knowledge of the area, I spent nearly three very productive weeks between Kerry and Cork, holidaying and researching. Once I began writing A Winter Sky, it was clear I was nearly done with this contemporary series, five books in all under the main title, \"The O'Farrell Legacy\". Enter the Regency Era, and a brand new start. I'm now beginning a new chapter of my own life. At nearly seventy, I am settled quite nicely into an era that I must have lived and enjoyed, though probably as a middle class worker rather than of the peerage. However, I find that writing about the peerage has taught me a lot, as there is no end to the amount of research one can do! And now I'm a member of the Regency Fiction Writers, a group that between the lot of them, know almost all there is to know about that time period. You have been a great mentor to me, even if you don't know me, other than a name on your Facebook page that loves all your entries and memes. I like the simplicity of your website and will show it to my web designer so that he knows what I am looking for. I also now have a professional editor and cringe when I think about those first five books and how badly they needed her touch, but alas, never got it. Jayne Barnard has been the best addition to my writing life ever! Thank you for being such a generous person, gifting us with your books, so beautifully written. You are an inspiration to us other writers who, while we struggle to live up to your example, continue to read, and re-read, all your stories. Thank you so much! Sonia Gay\n\nDear Mary, Please, no need to post this, as it is just a personal note of thanks. It was two years ago, with, and under the urging of others, that I started reading Romance novels - and being a guy to boot, which I assure you was not something I had ever envisioned (O silly me). Now to preface this by forty-five years or so, this romance genre only came to my notice as I observed ladies reading them on buses, on park benches, and who knows were else. I don’t recall even my mother or grandmothers engaged in these types of books, either – would have notice that. Thus, as fast as the observations were made, and in all honesty, the genre was quickly forgotten. So, jumping forward again in time, and under said urging, I embarked into the world of reading in-depth from many authors, the world of Romance novels. What a surprise. What a learning experiences, which brings me to your books. It was the Survivor series that I had started reading of yours first – very unique, which brought me to your other series, which brought me to your individual books going back to your earlier roots, including novellas. Now I may have missed a book or two that was unavailable, however I think I’ve read near all of your work. This brings me to your writing style, your rich characters, plots, historical placements (love the Welsh aspect) and meaning – yes, meaning. From my perspective, you have been able to plumb the depths of what it means to be human – no matter the station; wealth, knowledge, poverty to abject poverty, hunger, war and trauma both physical and mental. The deps of love and hurt, and the unknown or discovery, or even rediscover of self. The depths of, to use modern psychological words, sociopathy to psychopathy – our evil and our inherent goodness juxtaposed, all wrapped up into the human constitution. You do it very well. This has been a very interesting process and you uniquely, thoughtfully and passionately, have grasped human nature as a writer. Yes, I had watering-pot moments. A quick shout-out to your most recent work Remembering Love, it was excellent. What stood out for me beyond possibly all your other books (albeit a hard measure), was in one way the straightforward simpleness of the story, with a deeper and profound focus on the question of truth and lies (the crux), and the pain and suffering that can ripple through so many lives under the umbrella of choices. This book seemed to hold particular insightful meaning so applicable to us all. Lastly, and this is something that will likely go with me unto my last breath, and possibly beyond, is getting to know and having memory of probably hundreds, if not a thousand of your characters that represent all of us in humanity in so many infinite ways. Mary, I think your gift is that you help people. With my highest regards,\n\nDear Mary, I have been re-reading the Westcott series while waiting (ehm, counting down the days, actually) for the next one to come out and it struck me again how talented you are at writing secondary characters. Such a name is inappropriate to describe the ones in your books, in fact. They never feel like they are in the background, mere shadows moving about behind the scenes while the real action takes places between the two main characters on the stage. They are a tangible presence, enriching each page and making the romance more vivid. I love that chapter in \"Someone to Care\" when all the Westcotts and various in-laws get their invitations to Lady Estelle's party and everyone sends their acceptance. I can almost hear their voices reading the letters and debating whether or not to go, all the while knowing perfectly well that they won't be able to keep away. All those people, all those names... and you write them beautifully. It truly is a gift. The downside is, of course, that the avarage reader (that would be me, for one) cannot help but becoming very invested in said \"secondary\" characters, and hoping that they will somehow find their way into a book or a novella of their own. There are no words to say how happy I was to find out that you're planning a book about Matilda: I've had a soft spot for her ever since she encouraged Elizabeth to follow her heart. At the same time, I wonder about the Lamarr twins. Bertrand is pure hero material... What a delight it would be to read his story! His troubled childhood, his strict upbringing, the high standards of honour to which he holds himself - all that could fill a book and fulfill some lady's dreams of happiness, I have no doubts. Estelle was such a pleasure to read, this little bird spreading her wings for the first time and taking flight. I wonder where she could fly to, how her life would change with a whole new family and perhaps, in the future, someone special to love. I even wonder about Araminta Scott, Elizabeth's friend who made the most fleeting of appearances in \"Someone to Trust\": what would she do with her freedom, and would she even think of her situation as such, given that she lost a beloved parent? My thoughts are running away with me. I guess what I really want to say is that this is the reason why I read, and why I read your books. It's never just the one story. It's thousands of other stories you can read or fantasize about, and they are all in a book, all in those pages, if you find the time to read them, and read beyond them. Thank you.\n\nMary Balogh, While I have read practically all your books I have been able to get my hands on, for some reason, I keep returning to \"Unforgiven,\" When I first read it, I was much younger, and I was unable to understand the constant tension and friction both Kenneth and Moira had in their relationship. Even after they got married and were thinking about making their marriage work, I didn't understand the friction. I finished reading at the time and I went back again to read it once more, I still didn't get it. But I absolutely loved the trope of childhood loves/friends having some misunderstanding and reuniting. Plus your masterful writing and deep exploration of hurt emotions and conflict kept me coming back to this book. I finally understand where that underlying tension and friction was from, when I read it again as I just turned 25. I guess I'm old enough to understand why they were constantly fighting and that underneath that constant conflict, was love. They both loved each other and had probably never stopped. It transformed the entire way I looked at that book and those characters because while I logically understood their feelings and actions, It finally clicked for me emotionally where their actions were coming from. They were all coming from their love for each other, whether it was the resentment, the hatred, the constant fighting, it was all because they cared for each other and simply had too much pride and fear of possible hurt feelings to express that love to each other openly. It took me years to understand that undercurrent of love, but now I do and I adore that book even more. After rambling away like this, all I want to say is, please KEEP writing! Your books give me joy and solace. I keep coming back to them over and over again. I deeply admire your characterizations. And I want you to know that your books make a difference. There have been countless times where they have given me some bit of wisdom that I have not gleaned before. So, I'm going to selfishly ask you to keep writing. And I can't wait for Abby's book in the westcott series. And would sincerely implore you to write Winifred's book. She is such an endearing and precious child! I would love to read about her as an adult.\n\nThis is a note from a Saskatchewan reader, written on Earth Day and a few days after the Duke of Edinburgh’s funeral—‘our’ duke here in Canada and throughout the Commonwealth. I discovered your books through the small public library in the nearby village in late 2019. (Saskatchewan has a truly amazing interconnected library system.) The first things that crossed my path were Christmas themed. The author’s note in one said that you were Canadian; the next note included that you lived in Saskatchewan. Well! That information prompted an internet search which led to this lovely website and there it was stated that you had lived, married, taught and written in Kipling, Sask. I grew up in that general area, leaving for university in 1971 but remaining in the province. Given this geographic link, and the fact that you were a well known local author but unknown by me, I read more. My local library had Someone to Wed and Only Beloved in the local collection. After reading them, I was hooked. It was such a timely discovery to make as Covid descended. The library system and Indigo(on-line) have kept me ‘in Balogh’ for over a year now. Thank you for creating this amazing body of work. There are so many gems. By this point, I have been able to read the majority of your work. If one had to pick, your novels about people returning from war are probably the most gripping. That said, the Huxtable series, which is not war related, is not often mentioned in the notes left in your guest book and deserves light shone on it. Constantine Huxtable threads his way through the series as a complex and mysterious character and then, in A Secret Affair, we have the pleasure of being in his mind—and Hannah’s too. It is a masterpiece. I read (and reread) your books on paper. They are such interior works that it does not seem to me that they would translate well to film. The dual perspectives of the main characters are so interesting. There are recurring themes in your books that seem important to our time. Contact with nature is healing—your characters are ‘forest bathing’ on a regular basis. One can overcome incredible emotional pain and physical limitations and question social norms. Art and music are of great value. You can change life (all life) for the better in your sphere of influence. Animal companions can make a great difference. Love, including sexual love, is the great healer. And one final comment: I often have to stop reading because my eyes are closed and I am laughing too hard to see the text. Looking forward to Harry’s and Estelle’s stories.\n\nYep, just as I figured -- the only possible choice at Barnes & Noble after exhausting all your titles on the shelf is an author who has so little respect for her readers and the Regency period as to dispense with any pretense of authenticity whatever. Fortunately, I assured myself when I paid for the three I selected in desperation today that I could return them and get my money back. Sigh! So much more satisfying to go back to the dozen or so Balogh titles on my shelf and delight in re-reading them. Fortunately for me, you have been a prolific author. In my own interest I must soon conduct a more diligent search through your many titles in order to settle on some not locally available that I can order through B&N. I discovered Georgette Heyer in the 1950s and was delighted to find that same meticulous care for character and period in your books, along with generous doses of tasteful sexual episodes. Rather than settle for a poor \"knock-off' I may as well go back to a Texas novelist who is at least rooted in her locale and moreover has enough respect for herself and her readers to stick to it. Unfortunately, that author doesn't always 'hit the mark' on the heart strings where I'm concerned. as you never fail to do. I am going to add something deeply personal here and tell you that I suffer from hereditary Major Depression but have overcome that with God's help, a decade of psychological counseling and my Catholic faith. I happily live alone with two sweet cats and subsist on a meager Social Security pension. Reading top notch fiction like that which you create contributes mightily to my satisfaction in my circumstances and overall well-being. At the risk of conceit I can tell you that I possess an extremely high I.Q., a hungry mind that would devour me had I not fed and watered it daily since my earliest memories in the crib. Since that time my intellect and imagination and the splendid education I diligently sought have enriched my life beyond measure. In my determination to leave behind an ignorant Southern rural heritage I went at self-education 'hammer and tongs' starting in my early teens with Great Books like Ivanhoe, War and Peace, Madame Bovary (oof! depressing!) and other classics. Looking over the list of your many titles is such a consolation, along with an awareness that you do not repeat yourself. Thank you, thank you, thank you! Believe me, I know enough about writing to recognize that it's hard work. As Winston Churchill, one of the two heroes of my life* expressed his determination to save the civilized world from Nazism, writing demands \"blood, sweat, tears and toil.\" *Rosa Parks, the black lady who refused to give up her seat to a white man on a bus in Montgomery, Alabama and sparked the dismantling of segregation, is my other hero.\n\nWell, well, well. I’m not sure there is a greater pleasure than finding that one has so much in common with one’s favorite author. Like Mrs Balogh, I am not a reader of romance. Also like her, I found my reading list had narrowed rather significantly (and alarmingly) as the pandemic raged on, to not just romance books, but historical romances. And not just any historical romances, but Mrs. Balogh’s. I just cannot seem to get enough of the Baloghverse. And oh guys, I am deep into her oeuvre indeed. So deep that I came on to this website in a rage, finding that Secrets of the Heart and Tangled were not even available on Ebook. I’d thought perhaps they could be procured here on direct sale. No such luck, I’m afraid. It is deuced infuriating. I have a strange and rather mystical relationship with books. I believe that I read them at just the very moment that the author’s message could yield that pure kernel that would strike at the heart of me, always excruciatingly, so that I could be soothed and learn my lesson. Always, the lesson. A book could sit for years on my shelf without my being able to get past the first 15 pages, until just that singular moment when I would be confused, bewildered, in agony over for some dreadful experience, and I would finally pick up that tome and find that after all, someone (fictional) had gone through just that very same dread, that same agony, and had been able to overcome it with more or less some aplomb or at the very least, fortitude. This was how Norwegian Wood helped me come to grips with my best friend’s suicide, or The Idiot showed me that I was not so very alone in being beleaguered by a friendship with an all-too-real Nastassya Filippovna. Early on during the pandemic, I finally read Chuck Pahlaniuk’s Doomed. Then around May, two months into the lockdown, when I began to realize that yes, there is such a thing as too much Netflix and Chilling, I picked up Rushdie’s Quichotte. The timeliness of my reading them (in hard copy, guys, that’s how long I’ve had them) is downright eerie. So I have been just baffled by this romance binge. I am single and well into my dotage (which I assume is one’s 30s) with not even the dimmest prospect for romance. Why the devil have I been devouring these romances, one after another? I mean yes, these are great books. But what use I could get from them escapes me. The only time I ever remember to be sort of regretful that I am not in a relationship, and indeed haven’t been for a long time, is when someone else points it out. I would then worry and make a resolution (I’ll go on a date, ask x or y out..right away! Tomorrow!) to fix my solitary state, before promptly forgetting again. Vaginismas is not even annual event for me; it is every three years. When I read Someone to Wed around November last year, and then some time after that, The Proposal, I became extremely uncomfortable. Gwen was assailed by such ineffable loneliness that she would go and visit on the basis of really a very slight acquaintance. Wren was similarly besieged but crystallized her need for companionship, affection, and intimacy a lot better, and so proposed marriage on the basis of, um, no acquaintance. I thought I understood and related to both heroines. This was a frightening thought. Deuce take it, was I lonely?!? Was I reading these romance novels as some sort of escapist fantasy into a world where heroes both stalwart (Oh be still my heart, Adam Kent!) and simple (LOL Gerald Stapleton) persevered to not just win the love of intrepid heroines, but be worthy of them? And whatever happened to the Mystical Power of Lessons From Books? It’s not as if I’m going to step out to the supermarket and meet my Alistair Munro and these books are preparing me for the encounter. Sharing carriages with strangers is forbidden right now. So are balls. I do not have a ready answer, because I’m really not that smart. Or perhaps I am too cowardly to admit the implications of the same sort of self-awareness with which Lady Mornington came to terms in gracefully dignified fashion. What I can admit, is how much these romances have been adventurous glimpses into possibilities that would have been the reality of love and relationships for me, had I been half as brave as any Balogh heroine. Reading these novels during this pandemic has, if anything, thrown my solitude into sharp relief. I have been socially distanced for the better part of fifteen years, after a series of betrayals by everyone who claimed to love me. There was a returning lover! There were Lies! A seduced bosom bow ending in death! There was a letter! There was an old friend with a weird obsession! There was a sister who let the side down! It was all a great tragedy to rival any Russian novel. The result was that if anyone starts to talk to me about loving me, my immediate reaction is literally to grit my teeth and grimace against the inevitable onslaught of betrayal, more excruciating pain, and a general disillusionment with Aristotelian justice. I thus perfected ghosting and emotional and physical distancing before they were even things. I became, rather like Imogen, marble. Well, ok, I am about as far from Nordic marble as Chloe is from sense when she married an heir to a dukedom and expected to not ever return to London (girl, really??), so it’s more accurate to say I became granite. There was one instance in which I quite literally ran from a lovely guy that I met on one of my travels, only realizing some three months later that I had actually fallen in love with him over the course of a day that was just breakfast, a short temple run, and a 4-hour kayak trip deep in the jungles of Laos. I was horrified to be reminded of it when I read Only A Kiss. And of course, the hero was no Percy, running after me and asking, “why are you marble, or rather, granite?” I had not realized how I’d ended up being quite alone in 2020, by design as well as by pandemic, until I read Heartless. [I couldnt comprehend how everyone was calling Luke “heartless” when to my mind he was behaving perfectly reasonably before his love for Anna started breaking him down.] I thought Anna was insipid and I could not for the life of me relate to her; I had no trouble identifying at all with Lucas Kendrick. I have made myself quite heartless; behind me are enough burnt bridges to span oceans and I am surrounded by scorched earth. Understand, this is not an indictment of my choices. I am not even convinced I am lonely. But I would hate to be a slowtop and fail to grasp that I might be letting life get the best of me in a way that I definitely never intended if I continually spurn any and all attachments. Damnation, we should go on in quiet dignity like Fleur Hamilton, not Sybil, and refrain from whoring ourselves out as far as possible, and never castigate ourselves too much if it should ever become necessary. Dash it all, these books might have begun to make me believe that trying to find love again might be worth it. Perish the thought! Although how I can ever entertain any declaration of love that is not “something in me recognized you...my pearl beyond price”, or a proposal that doesn’t go, like, “well, coco, I think you had better marry me”, I really do not know."
