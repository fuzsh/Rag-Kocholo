        "text": "A prolific author of action-adventure features, de Souza wrote or co-wrote some of the biggest box office hits of the 1980s, specializing in tongue-in-cheek actioners for such stars as Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis. His fast paced scripts, full of succinct, often memorable dialogue alternating with bursts of weapon fire, car crashes or exploding buildings, all deftly crafted with style and humor, have made him a steady force in the genre for more than a decade."
