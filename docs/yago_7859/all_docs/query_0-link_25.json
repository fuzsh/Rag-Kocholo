        "text": "Synopsis\n\nFrom the films promotional materials: \"Arnold Berman is a klutz. Just ask his cousin Kenny, who has to put up with him over summer vacation from college. Arnold has to be seen to be believed: an uptight, unreal, super-straight Business major whos a whiz at accounting and a failure at everything else. Kenny and his pal Rollo turn Arnold on to a little grass to loosen him up, but they dont realize the demons theyve set free: for the now-swinging Arnold becomes a pothead Horatio Alger and soon has them all in the midst of a multi-million-dollar grass-dealing firm complete with snazzy executive offices, a fleet of delivery trucks, group insurance, and a little league team. All of this does not escape the attention of either the local police or the local \"organization,\" and the result is a free-enterprise free-for-all in which the customers are as high as the company stock.\"\n\nReception\n\nThe film won the Special Jury Prize at the 1972 Atlanta Film Festival. It was released in a few venues the following September, with promotion and advertising all but absent when the film’s distributor went into bankruptcy at the same time. Nonetheless, it received some favorable notices and had an extended run at the First Avenue Screening Room in New York as part of its Midnight Movie series along with Satyajit Ray films and Dance, Girl, Dance.\n\nThe soundtrack, by the band Adom, and produced by East Coast Records, has become something of a cult collectible, and the “Marijuana!” cut (the lyrics simply repetitions of that one word) has been heard frequently on Dr. Demento."
