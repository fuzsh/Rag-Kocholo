        "text": "“I saw Roddy McDowall the other night and he said, ‘It’s so wonderful to see you. You know, whenever I want to really enjoy myself I get a print of The Magnificent Ambersons and run it.’ I said, ‘You idiot! You’re in a good picture of mine! Why don’t you run that?’ ‘Oh?’ he said. I had to practically remind him that he’s in Macbeth!” — Orson Welles to Peter Bogdanovich\n\nBy Scott Ross\n\nMade as a personal challenge at the Poverty Row Republic Pictures studio for under $1 million and in only 24 days, Orson Welles‘ second major tilt at “The Scottish Play” after the so-called “Voodoo Macbeth” in Harlem is one of the great Shakespeare movies, especially in its restored edition which returns his actors’ Scots burrs, re-dubbed by the filmmaker at the insistence of Republic. Welles made only three Shakespeare pictures — the others are Othello (1951) and Chimes at Midnight/Falstaff (1965) — but I would rather watch the weakest of these than nearly any of Olivier’s much more vaunted and popular versions. (The exception is his 1955 Richard III.) Welles shot Macbeth on Republic’s craggy Western cavern sets, re-dressed to reflect a dark Medieval landscape and the brutality and madness of a play largely unrelieved by laughter: The only really comic character, the Porter (Gus Schilling), is effectively rendered mute in Welles’ version; this is not a picture in which humor is indulged, or even permitted. Its vision is that of a nightmare, where pleasure is abandoned and the forces of light, as represented by the new Christian religion, are themselves oppressive and effectively subsumed by the darkness surrounding them. I do not mean necessarily what Welles referred to in conversation with Peter Bogdanovich as “the underground, Druidical people” personified by the Three Weird Sisters, their order disappearing in the face of a relentless, well-funded adversary, so much as the egoistic struggle of men determined to be in charge, and to lord it over everyone, witch, noble and commoner alike. Alan Napier’s Holy Father, a character not in the play, most of whose meagre dialogue was assigned to him from the words of others in the play, seems to me a rather sinister figure, as grimly sanctimonious as the Witches are creepily manipulative.\n\nMacbeth is one of Welles’ most stark and disturbing movies and its look is remarkable, particularly considering the limitations placed on its filming. Shot to Welles’ Expressionist standards in deliberate shadow by John L. Russell, who was later the director of photography for Hitchcock on Psycho the picture is one of almost unrelieved gloom and tension. It isn’t as violent as it might be — this was 1948, after all, not 1971 — but the threat of violence hovers over the entire picture like the unidentified body hanging from a gibbet in the main playing area. Long before this Macbeth reaches the suicide of his wife and his numb, desolate “Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow” soliloquy, his kingdom is one blasted by hopelessness.\n\nEven granting that the scenarist/director/star cut the text ruthlessly Macbeth is also beautifully acted, particularly, and perhaps unexpectedly, by the radio actress Jeanette Nolan. Hers is a notably sexy Lady Macbeth; Welles introduces her clothed in clinging costume and in a glamorous pose languidly reading her husband’s letter, and the woman’s sexuality is seldom far from the surface of Nolan’s portrayal. I do not mean Welles’ inclusion of Lady M’s characteristic (and frequently misinterpreted) phrase, “Unsex me here” but the way, when she urges Macbeth “To bed!,” which she does twice, she doesn’t always mean “go to sleep.” This is especially true when she whispers it to him urgently after the killing of Duncan; Nolan’s Lady Macbeth seems sexually aroused either by the murder her husband has committed, and by her own bloody involvement in the killing, or because by brutally stabbing the old king and his drugged bodyguards he has proven to her a masculinity she doubted he possessed. (Yet do I fear thy nature; It is too full o’ th’ milk of human kindness/To catch the nearest way.) Critics of the time, and since, have sneered at Nolan’s performance but she played the role in Welles’ stage production of the play, which preceded the movie and from which he worked out his approach to filming it, so certainly he appreciated what she’d done.\n\nWelles’ Macbeth is also mesmerizing; it’s one of his finest portrayals, marred only by some very poor post-production dubbing on his part. Welles shot the picture silent (and, he claimed, required his actors to mouth their lines to pre-recordings), requiring the cast to loop their lines, something he had done very effectively in parts of his other pictures, especially the winter ball and snow sequences in The Magnificent Ambersons. Since everyone praises Orson Welles for his sound work I am going to speak heresy here by noting that he himself was terrible at dubbing lines generally, and especially bad at it in Macbeth. This becomes a particular problem when he dubs multiple voices, as he did in The Lady from Shanghai, Othello, The Trial and Falstaff and one is repeatedly confronted by characters who sound like no one but Orson Welles trying to disguise his voice and doing a bad job of it, in addition to which their lips don’t match the words they’re supposed to be speaking. In Macbeth the poor lip synchronization detracts from Welles’ otherwise affecting performance, especially during his soliloquies. If you can get past this defect his Macbeth is compelling, especially after Duncan’s murder and his own investiture as King, when he deteriorates drastically, and rapidly, taking to carrying a horn of wine with him and drinking from it liberally. Welles’ command, as a director and as an actor, is evident especially in the long murder sequence which runs for what seems like a reel without a cut, utilizing those imposing stairs he borrowed from his earlier Harlem production, and elaborated upon.\n\nIn the strong supporting cast, Dan O’Herlihy as Macduff is the standout, and I am always struck by how Malcom, the dead king’s hardened heir, will not allow Macduff his full measure of grief when he discovers that his wife and children have been murdered, yet O’Herlihy’s disbelieving “All my pretty ones?” rends the heart. If Roddy McDowall forgot he had been in Macbeth I have always thought it may have been because those were lean years for the former child star, as adolescence and young manhood always is for a young actor who is suddenly raised to unexpected heights of adulation and then just as quickly dropped from them; it took McDowall another decade to shed his childhood and become recognized as a consummate character actor, so perhaps he simply wanted to forget those times. In any case, he acquits himself well here, as does Edgar Barrier as Banquo, John Dierkes as Ross, Keene Curtis as Lennox, Peggy Webber as Lady Macduff, Brainerd Duffield as the First Murderer and William Alland (immortally the reporter Thompson in Citizen Kane) as the Second Murderer. Jerry Farber is a striking presence as Banquo’s son Fleance as is Erskine Sanford as Duncan, although Welles cut most of his lines. I’ve never cared for his daughter Christopher Welles as Macduff’s young son not much because she isn’t terribly good (it’s a small role, after all) but because as a boy she both looks and sounds like what she was: a little girl. Her screams as her character is murdered, however, bring about what Emily Dickinson once called zero at the bone.\n\nJacques Ibert composed a splendid, spare score which, fortunately, you can find on a Naxos collection,* and the art direction by Fred A. Ritter and set decoration by John McCarthy Jr. and James Redd could, under the niggardly circumstances of the budget, scarcely be bettered. (All those jagged edges, including the horizontal iron bars over the castle windows that resemble nothing so much as monstrous thorns designed to keep people in as well as out.) Fred A. Ritter’s costumes — which the director had a hand in — are rather good except when, at the climax, Welles was forced by time constraints and the availability of battle helmets to go with something he accurately compared to the crown of the Statue of Liberty. The recent Kino Lorber Blu-ray includes a lengthy Overture by Ibert, which must have come as a real surprise to American movie audiences in 1948.\n\nThe entire picture, at least for now, can be seen here.\n\n*Ibert’s underscore for the sequence after the murder of Duncan must surely have inspired John Williams when he came to compose the music for Jabba the Hutt in Return of the Jedi.\n\nText 2024 by Scott Ross\n\nBy Scott Ross\n\nBabes in Toyland (1961) Walt Disney’s first live-action musical is a candy-coated bomb containing some pleasant old Victor Herbert tunes kitted out with new Mel Leven lyrics to replace some of the more dated, fustian originals by Glen MacDonald (the best of them is the comic tango “Castle in Spain,” an amusing turn for Ray Bolger, camping it up as the mustache-twirling villain), a few nice visual touches, Henry Calvin and Gene Sheldon performing homages to Laurel and Hardy, Annette Funicello as Mary Contrary, Tommy Sands doing a drag bit as a gypsy fortune-teller, Tommy Kirk as a hapless inventor and Ed Wynn as a surprisingly cranky and hypocritical Toymaker. The rest of it is over-fed, cloying operetta-fantasy that must have seemed, even in the year of my birth, at least 50 years out of date; I can’t imagine what today’s children would make of it. The best items are the funny little animated curlicues devised by Ward Kimball, who was also responsible for the marching wooden soldiers. (Co-author with Joe Rinaldi and Lowell S. Hawley of the screenplay, Kimball was the original producer until he ruffled Walt’s feathers and was replaced.) Jack Donohue directed, with numbing literal-mindedness. The wrong-headedness of the thing is exemplified by George Bruns and Jud Conlon speeding up the haunting ballad “Toyland” and turning it into a march.\n\nThe Celluloid Closet (1995) The partly-successful documentary based on Vito Russo’s groundbreaking book has much to recommend it but is missing its author’s essential voice, and his anger.\n\nThe Devil’s Brother, aka Fra Diavolo (1933) Whenever Laurel and Hardy are on the screen, this adaptation by Jeanie Macpherson of the 1830 Daniel Auber/Eugène Scribe opéra-comique is wonderful. Unfortunately there’s a plot, and songs, that have nothing to do with them. But coming as it did before strict enforcement of the Production Code began, The Devil’s Brother is sexually frank in a way movies ceased to be after January 1935: It’s perfectly obvious that the rich women who are his unwitting victims are having it off with Dennis King’s murderous jewel thief Fra Diavolo, or (as with Thelma Todd) are about to. The direction by Hal Roach and Charles Rogers is pleasant, as is the cinematography by Hap Depew and Art Lloyd, and the sequence in which Stan is supposed to be filling tankards with wine but gets nearly as much down his own throat as he does the vessels Ollie hands him, growing more and more inebriated, is a classic of its kind, as is his enactment of the game “Kneesey-Earsie-Nosey.” Todd is both luscious and amusing, and L & H’s perennial foil, James Finlayson, appears to good (if too brief) effect as her jealous husband. If you care about such things, Roach directed the musical sequences and Rogers the “book” scenes.\n\nCapricorn One (1977) When I was 16, this crowd-pleasing paranoia thriller written and directed by Peter Hyams about a faked NASA Mars landing satisfied my post-Watergate cynicism about my government and my concomitant delight in seeing dogged investigative reporters (remember them?) portrayed on the screen. Hyams, a sort of poor-man’s Alan J. Pakula, keeps his story moving fast as three astronauts (James Brolin, Sam Waterston and O. J. Simpson back when he was remembered more for his prowess on the football field than for If I Did It) are blackmailed into participating in a massive hoax, escape and are pursued across the desert by a pair of creepily anonymous high-tech black helicopters. Meanwhile, a wobbly reporter (Elliott Gould), tipped off by a NASA employee (Robert Walden) who then mysteriously disappears, latches onto the story and begins piecing it together.\n\nWatching Capricorn One for the first time since it was released I was as pleasantly surprised by how much of it still works as I was annoyed by the things in it, such as Telly Savalas’ profane crop-duster, that seem a sop to then-fashionable audience expectations of low-comedy relief, and the Waterston character’s irritating joke-monologue as he climbs a mesa (why?) What’s most enjoyable about it are Jerry Goldsmith’s superb action score with its propulsive earworm of a main theme; Gould’s performance as the reporter; David Doyle as his cheerfully nasty editor; Hal Holbrook as the duplicitous NASA official heading the operation; and the rich supporting performances of Brenda Vaccaro, Karen Black, David Huddleston, Barbara Bosson and James Karen. Bill Butler provided the occasionally rapturous cinematography and James Mitchell the effective editing. The action set-pieces are generally well-directed by Hyams and there is a moment during the obligatory Hey-wait-my-brakes-are-gone! sequence with Gould where his car sails off a bascule bridge that is, if you have a phobia about these things, absolutely terrifying.\n\nI am, of course, being slightly facetious when I imply there are no more serious investigative journalists in America. There are plenty. But none of them — not one — works for the corporate press (newspaper or magazine) nor for any of the broadcast radio, television or cable networks, staffed as they are almost exclusively by CIA assets or former security-state officials and employees. The names Lee Fang, Aaron Maté, Max Blumenthal, Whitney Webb, Glenn Greenwald, Matt Taibbi, Anya Parampil, Michael Tracey, Johnny Vedmore, Emma-Jo Morris, Michael Shellenberger and Kit Klarenberg are likely unknown to you, unless you make an effort to seek out their reporting or happen to catch a Congressional hearing in which they are as likely as not to be insulted, demeaned, slandered and even threatened by censorship-loving Democrats like that corrupt carpetbagger Stacey Plaskett or her colleague, the equally sleazy and anti-democratic Debbie Wasserman Schultz. But with our permanent government writing the stories it feeds to its lackeys in the corporate media and dictating to social websites what speech it will permit Americans to utter and which beliefs we are now allowed to hold, a free press, essential to a free people, is largely dead in the Land of the Free.\n\nThe Jerk (1979) I wish Steve Martin’s screen debut had been a better, funnier, movie. Taking off from Martin’s old “I was born a poor black child” stand-up routine the screenplay by him, Carl Gottlieb and Michael Elias posits his character as less a jerk than a congenital idiot, but I suppose The Moron wouldn’t have played as well on theater marquees. The picture, directed by the redoubtable Carl Reiner, is almost militantly unfunny; the laughs are so intermittent they could scarcely pad out a 30-minute television episode let alone a full-length movie. When something in the picture is amusing, it tends to elicit a smile rather than an actual laugh, as when Martin sings a dopey song in the bathtub or when he leaves Bernadette Peters near the end, a sequence largely ad-libbed by him. The only genuinely hilarious bits in The Jerk are M. Emmet Walsh’s turn as an incompetent sniper and the verbal payoff to Martin kicking Gottlieb in the testicles. (The screenwriter says even he didn’t know about the punch-line until he saw the rough-cut.) But it’s a measure of the movie’s failure that Bill Macy, Dick O’Neill, Maurice Evans, Jackie Mason and Reiner himself don’t have a funny line or bit between them.\n\nPeters is charming as Martin’s love interest but it’s hard to believe her as a woman nearly as stupid as he is. The nicest scene in the picture, when they sing “You Belong to Me” together on the beach as he strums a ukulele, is undercut when, at its climax, she’s made to produce and play a trumpet in imitation of a Louis Armstrong riff. That should give you an idea of how incompetent and annoying The Jerk really is: Its makers couldn’t even trust a moment as sweet as that impromptu duet without trying to wring a dumb joke out of it.\n\nThe Taking of Pelham 1-2-3 (1974) One of the most entertaining thrillers of its era; like Rio Bravo, it’s a movie I have over the decades seen repeatedly, and with undiminished pleasure. The picture follows the narrative of John Godey’s 1973 bestseller but Peter Stone’s sharp, often funny screenplay changes and improves on it. It’s also one of the best-cast movies of the 1970s, from Walter Matthau’s Transit Authority lieutenant faced with a highjacked subway train held for ransom and Robert Shaw as the chillingly methodical leader of the group of crooks to Doris Roberts as the Mayor’s deadpan wife and Tom Pedi as the hot-headed Transit manager Caz Dolowicz, a name that lives on in glory among us Pelham aficionados. It’s a quintessential New-York-in-the-’70s movie, and nearly everybody in it is pissed off at the world; the bad humor of its many characters adds to the picture’s flavor, and its wit. Its director, Joseph Sargent, handles the pace, the suspense and the look of the movie admirably, the editing by Gerald B. Greenberg and Robert Q. Lovett couldn’t be more apt, and Owen Roizman’s rich cinematography looks especially good in the recent 4K UHD transfer. David Shire’s brief, 12-tone-inspired score is terse and infectious — it’s one of the things about the picture you remember most, along with Matthau’s hangdog look and Martin Balsam’s head-cold.\n\nAmong the terrific actors in the supporting cast are Earl Hindman as a relatively mild-mannered highjacker; Héctor Elizondo as his polar opposite, a frighteningly mercurial, psychopathic killer; James Broderick as the train motorman; Dick O’Neill as a sour, belligerent Transit Authority controller; Lee Wallace, everyone favorite Ed Koch stand-in, as the Mayor (although Wallace’s presence predates Koch’s in Gracie Mansion by four years); Tony Roberts as the disgusted deputy mayor; Jerry Stiller as Matthau’s coeval; Kenneth McMillan as a Borough commander; and Julius Harris as the Deputy chief inspector, recipient of a priceless greeting by Matthau. The train’s passengers are well-delineated and believable except for Anna Berger as the mother of two obnoxious boys; she so overdoes every emotion you begin to long for the gunmen to summarily dispose of her. Berger is one of the very few aspects of the picture that let it down.\n\nPlanet of the Apes (1968) There are some fantasy notions so good they seem blazingly original and at the same time so creatively logical you almost can’t believe no one thought of them before their authors set them down. Pierre Boulle’s Monkey Planet was one of them, a tongue-in-cheek science-fiction novel that turned on the ultimate cosmic joke: A sphere in which apes evolved from human beings, who are in turn ruled by their evolutionary superiors. (The book is more satirical than the eventual movie: Its narrative is in the form of a missive left in space, an interstellar message-in-a-bottle picked up by a skeptical married couple who, at the end, are revealed as chimpanzees.) The movie, imaginatively directed by Franklin J. Schaffner from an intelligent screenplay credited to Michael Wilson and Rod Serling, was an enormous success for its producer Arthur P. Jacobs in 1968, eventually siring four sequels of varying quality, and several remakes in the modern era. All that from a little French speculative novel published 60 years ago.\n\nCharlton Heston has one of his best roles as the cynical American astronaut Taylor, delighted to be leaving Earth and his fellow humans, whom he despises. The bitter joke at the core of the movie is that he more than gets his wish. He’s well-matched by his co-stars, especially Kim Hunter as the curious, compassionate scientist Zira, Roddy McDowall as her cautious fiancé Cornelius and James Whitmore as the President of the Assembly who makes Taylor defend himself in a rather too pointed spoof of the Scopes trial. (That “See-No-Evil, Hear-No-Evil, Speak-No-Evil” imagery should have been reconsidered by everyone concerned because it makes the movie momentarily something it otherwise never is: Silly.) Leon Shamroy’s fine-grained images are splendid, and the simian prosthetics created by John Chambers are still remarkable 55 years on. Jerry Goldsmith’s score is one of his most original and inventive, particularly in the big action set-pieces, such as Taylor’s capture and his later (momentary) escape.\n\nSide-note: I can no longer contemplate Maurice Evans’s orangutan authoritarian Dr. Zaius without also thinking of the chorus in the hilarious Andrew Lloyd Webber parody Planet of the Apes musical featured in an early episode of “The Simpsons.” Even his name seems funny to me now.\n\nBeneath the Planet of the Apes (1970) Arthur P. Jacobs’ first sequel to Planet of the Apes suffers from a sense of being rushed — not in its production but in the more perfunctory aspects of its story: The astronaut played by James Franciscus barely meets Cornelius and Zira before they give each other a few scraps of exposition and abruptly part. The chimpanzees are hardly in the movie; neither, at his own request, is Charlton Heston, although Maurice Evans returns as Dr. Zaius, as do Kim Hunter as Zira and Linda Harrison as Nova, her role even more thankless than in the original. Due to the poet-screenwriter Paul Dehn’s particularly weird sense of drama, Franciscus and Heston are confronted with intelligent human mutants who communicate, threaten and destroy telepathically, worship an unexploded cobalt bomb and wear humanoid masks over their ruined faces. (Dehn wrote the story with Mort Abrahams.) If the picture has any distinction, it’s in this aspect, and the art direction (by William Creber and Jack Martin Smith) and set decoration (by Walter M. Scott and Sven Wickman) of the underground remnants of New York. Ted Post’s direction is functional, but the visual effects are almost stunningly bad. The mutants are a clutch of splendid character actors including Victor Buono, Jeff Corey, Thomas Gomez, Don Pedro Colley, Natalie Trundy and Gregory Sierra, and James Gregory memorably portrays a militant gorilla general. The best thing about Leonard Rosenman’s futuristic score is the witty inversion he composed for the mutant bomb-worshippers of “All Things Bright and Beautiful.”\n\nText copyright 2023 by Scott Ross\n\nBy Scott Ross\n\nAs ever, click the links on the capsules for more complete reviews.\n\nThe Story of a Three-Day Pass (1968) Melvin Van Peebles’ debut as a screenwriter/director is a modest, lively, often amusing little picture about a black soldier stationed in France (Harry Baird) enjoying an extended pass from his American base and romancing an engaging if enigmatic Parisian girl (Nicole Berger) and about which extravagant claims are now being made due largely to the race of its maker. Based by Van Peebles on his own novel La Permission, the movie has a loose, impressionistic structure and an alternately playful and pretentious approach to imagery some of which works and much of which, like the filmmaker’s own score, is irritating. It also doesn’t help that the good-looking Baird is such a non-actor and so clearly out of his depth; at moments of disengagement I kept thinking how much better Hari Rhodes would have been. The picture’s tone is generally realistic yet Baird’s white Captain (Hal Brav) is a cartoon — a funny cartoon, but a cartoon — and almost everyone and everything in the movie is set up to betray Baird, in a more or less racist fashion. While Van Peebles showed obvious talent here, both as a writer and a director, no amount of special pleading can turn The Story of a Three-Day Pass into a retrospective masterpiece. Yet The New Yorker‘s resident idiot critic Richard Brody calls this mélange of styles and attitudes “among the great American films of the sixties.” Pull the other one, Brody. Overpraising a man’s work because he is or was black is as bad as underpraising it for the same reason. It not only does not redress the original injury; it adds a new layer of racism to it.\n\nThe French Lieutenant’s Woman (1981) Another movie adaptation of a novel that resisted transmigration to a performance medium, but one with many compensations and much to recommend it. John Fowles’ thoroughly engaging 1969 book was a literary experiment evoking the conventions of the Victorian novel while simultaneously critiquing and commenting on them. Even those movie critics who had never read Fowles’ novel knew in 1981 that it contained three separate endings, one conventionally happy, one conventionally un-happy, and one entirely speculative, ambivalent, and purely literary. Although I feel that this technique could, with sufficient wit, imagination and budget, have been translated to the screen, Harold Pinter’s solution was, in addition to depicting two endings, imposing a contemporary love story in which the (fictional) leading actors appearing in the movie, both married to others, enact their own parallel love affair, clever but not entirely satisfying. What’s best about it are the way it permits, through the actors’ research into the period, some of Fowles’ observations about Victorian England to seep into the narrative, and the ending, in which Pinter makes it devastatingly clear that the young actor playing the leading man in the film-within-the-film has, like his Victorian counterpart in the story, confused the actress with her role.\n\nKarel Reisz, an interesting British filmmaker who alas directed far too few movies, did a splendid job of calibrating the performances of the actors, the intricacies of Fowles’ and Pinter’s work, and the exquisite cinematography by the great Freddie Francis, especially of the Lyme Regis locations including that rather terrifying harbor wall called The Cobb at the end of which the eponymous character habitually stares out to sea. The dual characters of the English Sarah Woodruff and the American actress Anna were among Meryl Streep’s most important early roles and although I am often ambivalent about her at once splendid technique and concomitant, almost Brechtian, emotional distance from us, seeing The French Lieutenant’s Woman again after several decades’ abeyance I am happy to reassess my original, somewhat underwhelmed, perception of her performance. She understands, and conveys, the ambivalence of Sarah, both as her unintended swain Charles Smithson (Jeremy Irons) perceives her and as John Fowles the author does. Sarah’s motivations are ultimately unknowable, perhaps even to herself, and it seems increasingly clear through the narrative that the opinion of the kindly Dr. Grogan (Leo McKern) that she is mentally and emotionally unbalanced is correct. Pinter makes clear that Sarah is a frustrated artist in an age which did not admit of, much less encourage, a woman — especially a single woman, and one of dubious “moral” repute — to such pursuits. In this Sarah Woodruff’s position is not unlike Virginia Woolf’s fictional sister of Shakespeare in “A Room of One’s Own,” driven mad by her gift and by her society’s determination that she not be permitted to express it. Streep plays that too, silently, giving the character a vivid inner life, one of the most difficult things for any actor to accomplish on film. She also slyly comments on the action, at one point laughing quietly when in their climactic confrontation scene she is knocked to the floor by Irons. It’s a dazzling, almost Pirandellian moment of the kind which it is now I suppose compulsory to refer to, breathlessly, as “meta,” an obligation from which this writer begs his leave. Speaking of such things, there’s a wonderfully conceived and edited moment when Streep as Ana, rehearsing indoors with Irons, trips and, after a cut, is caught in her fall by him in the woods where Charles and Sarah are meeting. That’s a marvelous juxtaposition, beautifully achieved and without ostentation.\n\nIrons too was on the cusp of an impressive movie (and theatrical) career and his work as Smithson is intelligent and perceptive. Betrothed to a young girl (Lynsey Baxter) far too silly and inconsequential for him, Smithson offers a moment of gentlemanly kindness to Sarah, and becomes fatally bound to her. Irons locates Charles’ privileged sense, as the potential heir to a fortune, of snobbish noblesse oblige as well as his own essential frustrations, and his basic decency. The supporting roles are perfectly cast, from the calculating Baxter and the splendid McKern to Hilton McRae as Charles’ valet Sam, Emily Morgan as Sam’s inamorata Mary and Patience Collier as Sarah’s truly horrific old termagant employer. Fowls in the novel gets the last laugh on her when, as she stands before the Pearly Gates expecting if not demanding immediate admittance, he consigns her to Hell. Even as she’s falling from Heaven she’s sure it’s all the fault of her old earthly rival in the piousness game.\n\nSwiss Family Robinson (1960) The very entertaining Disney adaptation of the 1812 Johann David Wyss novel minus its sanctimonious Christian tone but with pirates. Astonishingly, the entirety of the movie’s dialogue had to be dubbed by the actors after filming was completed due to ambient location noise. It’s frequently noticeable, but for the most part remarkably well done. John Mills and Dorothy McGuire make a splendid team as Father and Mother, James MacArthur (often shirtless, which must have made a lot of teenage hearts flutter in 1960) a robust Fritz, Tommy Kirk (who also stirred a few juvenile libidos) a charming Ernst, Janet Munro a lovely interloper and Sessue Hayakawa the leader of the pirates. Lowell S. Hawley wrote the very good screenplay, well directed by Ken Annakin and beautifully shot by Harry Waxman. It’s an attractive movie with an attractive cast, always excluding the almost unrelievedly obnoxious Kevin Corcoran, whom I have actively loathed since my own childhood. I’m no advocate for the beating of children, but having watched Corcoran’s terminal brattiness in too many pictures like this one I’d happily make an exception in his case.\n\nKotch (1971) Katharine Topkins’ 1965 novel begins promisingly and quickly devolves into a deadly combination of relentless intellectual cleverness on the part of the author and gently militant annoyance by her protagonist. Although Joseph P. Kotcher is essentially harmless, he’s also an increasingly senescent, educated pill who drives everyone around him to distraction with his endless verbal rodomontade. What attracted Jack Lemmon to this material and convinced him to make it his directorial debut I can’t imagine, especially since the screenwriter John Paxton’s adaptation is all too faithful to the book. It’s worth seeing once for Matthau’s finely judged performance, which does its best to make “Kotch” palatable; for Lemmon’s clean, uncluttered direction; and for the other performers, who include Deborah Winters as the bright pregnant teenager Kotch adopts, Charles Aidman as his guilt-ridden son, Jane Connell as a jolly social worker, Larry Linville as the girl’s single-minded salesman father and Felicia Farr, otherwise known as Mrs. Lemmon, as Kotch’s disapproving daughter-in-law. Marvin Hamlisch’s score is one of his most pleasant, with a tender, memorable theme for Kotch.\n\nThe Prime of Miss Jean Brodie (1969) The screen adaptation of Muriel Spark’s great short novel. It’s not nearly as good as its source, but it’s beautifully acted and thoroughly entertaining.\n\nHarry & Tonto (1974) It’s fashionable now to claim that Art Carney won the Best Actor Academy Award over Pacino in The Godfather Part II and Nicholson in Chinatown for sentimental reasons, which only points up how stupid most awards really are. Carney had nothing to apologize for, nor did anyone who voted for him. Harry & Tonto only looks, and feels, better with the passing of the years, a serio-comic King Lear that ends not with tragedy but with the grin of a young child building castles on the sands of a Santa Monica beach under Harry’s benign supervision.\n\nThe Great Northfield Minnesota Raid (1972) If you put the best of the writer/director Philip Kaufman’s take on the failed 1876 bank robbery by the Younger/James gang together with what also works in The Long Riders, Walter Hill’s 1980 fantasy on the same event, you might if you were a judicious editor come up with about one-third of a good movie. At least the Dave Grusin score in this one hasn’t been mixed to drown out the dialogue the way Ry Cooder’s was in the Hill picture, nor does Kaufman rely on stunt casting (all those brothers playing brothers) and dragging in people such as “the coward Robert Ford” who weren’t even there. And although Kaufman was stuck with Cliff Robertson for his star he at least also had Robert Duvall (as Jesse James) as a counterbalance. The supporting cast is excellent and includes Dana Elcar, Donald Moffat, Jack Manning, Elisha Cook, Royal Dano, Barry Brown, Nellie Burt, Liam Dunn and, as narrator, the stentorian tones of Paul Frees. The picture was well written but plagued by pretty terrible post-production dubbing, especially by Herbert Nelson, playing the chief detective from Pinkerton. At least at 98 minutes the movie has the virtue of brevity.\n\nWatermelon Man (1970) Melvin Van Peebles’ sophomore effort as a director is a very funny absurdist fantasy, written by Herman Raucher, about a cheerful liberal bigot who wakes up black. Despite Van Peebles’ attempts to turn Watermelon Man into a statement of militancy — the ending feels grafted onto a narrative that can’t support it — the movie makes its satirical points broadly but with wit and originality. Godfrey Cambridge stars as the hotshot insurance agent Jeff Gerber, in the best and largest movie role this gifted comedian ever had, and he’s a marvel. Gerber is a smiling, seemingly congenial creep who operates as if the entire world exists only to gratify his needs. He has a glib answer for everything (and everyone) and is so nonchalantly competitive he races his bus on foot every morning while the passengers urge their driver to leave him in the dust. When his ethnicity changes overnight he’s thrown into an uncharacteristic panic. Nothing in his ordered world makes sense any longer, and even his liberal wife (Estelle Parsons) whom he previously accused of deliberately watching on television nothing except race-riots, draws away from him.\n\nParsons’ character, and her performance, are the movie’s most perfect, subtle attack on phony liberal pieties, but she’s hardly alone: The lubricious Norwegian secretary (Kay Kimberley) in Cambridge’s insurance office who wouldn’t give Gerber the time of day when he was white now paws him at every opportunity, and when he calls her on her own bigotry she immediately screams “Nigger!” at him. Then there’s the counterman played by the great old character player Mantan Moreland whose servile, shuffling, “hyuck-hyuck-hyuck” mask with Gerber when he’s white instantly drops away when Gerber is black. W. Wallace Kelley’s color cinematography is garish, like a period Universal TV movie of the week gone berserk but Van Peebles’ sharp, effective direction holds the enterprise together. His music, as was the case with the earlier The Story of a Three-Day Pass, is good when it isn’t terrible, as in the “Love, That’s America” song that plays over Cambridge disgustedly quitting a garbageman job and which is sung, gratingly off-pitch, by its composer.\n\nCambridge, whose comic persona was of a man of above-average intelligence who is amused by much and startled by very little and who was one of the brightest entertainment figures of his era, was not so much ill-used by American filmmakers as ignored. He had a good role in Theodore J. Flicker’s great political satire The President’s Analyst (1967) and an even better one as a Yiddish-speaking cabbie in Bye Bye Braverman the next year, starred as Chester Himes’ Gravedigger Jones in the delightful Cotton Comes to Harlem (also 1970) and its sequel Come Back, Charleston Blue (1972), had a cameo as himself in the enjoyable comedy Five on the Black Hand Side (1973), and not much else. (He died in 1976, at the obscenely young age of 43.) His performance as Jeff Gerber should have opened every door to him. Why didn’t it?\n\nTanner ’88 (1988) The innovative 11-part political series created and written by Garry Trudeau and directed by Robert Altman with a master’s eye for understated satire.\n\nThey All Laughed (1981) I wanted to like this romantic comedy written and directed by Peter Bogdanovich a great deal more than I eventually did. It’s congenial, beautifully shot on its New York City locations by Robby Müller and (for the most part) engagingly acted by its ensemble cast. But it’s needlessly convoluted and ultimately adds up to very little. Bogdanovich was so busy coming up with plot complications for his extremely slight narrative he neglected to give us individualized characters. Worse, the few who are exceptionally singular are also exasperating (Colleen Camp) or obnoxious (Blaine Novak). The dialogue, as was often the case when Bogdanovich wrote by himself, is a collection of moderately bright, would-be humorous wisecracks whose style seems borrowed from the sophisticated screwball comedies by others, notably Howard Hawks, Leo McCarey and Ernst Lubitsch, the comic filmmakers he most admired.\n\nNone of this gives me any pleasure to express because unlike many if not most of his contemporary critics I like Bogdanovich’s pictures in the main and several of them (Targets, The Last Picture Show, What’s Up Doc?, Paper Moon) as much as any movies I’ve ever seen. I’m especially sorry not to be as charmed by They All Laughed as I hoped to be because the circumstances surrounding its completion and release (the horrific murder of the writer-director’s inamorata Dorothy Stratten, his attempt at releasing the movie himself, his subsequent bankruptcy and period of unemployability) were so shattering to its maker. Stratten, by the way, is not only beautiful and exceptionally photogenic; she is also, in an underwritten role, very good. Certainly she is better than Camp who, as the most voluble character in the movie, proves a staggering incompetent. Worse, she never once sounds like an actual human being, only like a character in a self-consciously clever motion picture. There is one moment in They All Laughed I found profoundly moving: When Audrey Hepburn, after a brief romantic interlude with Ben Gazzara which restores her sense of herself as a desirable woman, flies off in a helicopter. I hasten to add that I teared up not because of the situation but due to this being for all intents and purposes (who counts Spielberg’s Always?) Hepburn’s final moments in a movie.\n\nThe Honey Pot (1967) A typically verbose (and typically clever) adaptation by the writer-director Joseph L. Mankiewicz of a Frederick Knott play based on Thomas Sterling’s novel The Evil of the Day, itself suggested by Ben Jonson’s play Volpone. Although, in patented Mankiewicz fashion the picture is at least 20 minutes too long, it’s also witty, sumptuously filmed and appointed, and played to a fare-thee-well by a cast of veterans including Rex Harrison, Susan Hayward, Capucine, Edie Adams and Adolfo Celi. Cliff Robertson as usual comes off as a stiff, unpleasant amateur but he’s more than offset by the sparkling performance of Maggie Smith as the only innocent in the bunch. Smith is such a marvelous comic (and dramatic) technician she absolutely steals the movie from Harrison, that peerless light comedian, a feat that until seeing The Honey Pot I would not have thought possible. Mankiewicz’s trio of distaff above-the-title players were, when they saw the results, not best pleased. They thought they were the stars.\n\nThat title, by the way, is pretty lousy but Mankiewicz’ original, The Tale of the Fox, wasn’t much better. According to Kenneth L. Geist, Mankiewicz’s biographer, The Honey Pot was conceived and written as a much more ambitious and reflective movie, in which the conventions of filmmaking in general (and this movie in particular) are commented on satirically on film and in voice-over, somewhat as W.C. Fields did in Never Give a Sucker an Even Break but with even greater daring and brio. It sounds fascinating, and far more interesting than what, under the aegis of the nervous literalists at United Artists, Mankiewicz ended up with.\n\nFunny Lady (1975) is perhaps the greatest single argument I’ve ever seen against long-term movie contracts. Barbra Streisand owed Ray Stark one more picture under hers, and this entirely unnecessary follow-up to Funny Girl was what they came up with. To her debit, Streisand liked the hard-edged Fanny Brice of the Jay Presson Allen/Arnold Schulman screenplay, which in no way reflects the nice woman Brice reputedly was. But then her second husband Billy Rose (James Caan) wasn’t the man the movie depicts either. The picture mixes up the dates outrageously, and in the cynical near certainty that no one who shelled out $2.50 to see Funny Lady would know the difference except perhaps some of the show-biz savvy fags in the audience whom the filmmakers had nothing but contempt for anyway. Thus Roddy McDowall is wasted as Bobby Moore, Fanny’s chorus-boy-friend-cum-secretary while serving as the butt of ugly comments by Rose. The entire thing is schizophrenic: A gay-courting near-drag-show with musical numbers seemingly enacted by a self-conscious Streisand impersonator that simultaneously loathes queers and insults them relentlessly. Well, what can one expect from a project directed and choreographed by a professional closet-case like Herbert Ross?\n\nThe last time we see Bobby it’s in a portrait on Fanny’s piano, a well-known publicity shot from The Poseidon Adventure in which McDowall sports his chief steward’s costume. That should give you some idea of the movie’s concern with verisimilitude. But that’s as nothing compared to the haphazard way years (and shows) are depicted in Funny Lady. The movie has Brice meeting Rose in the 1930s when the two were already married by 1929, and Fanny (as she puts it) “falling in like” with Billy during the production of their revue Crazy Quilt, produced in fact years after they were wed. And then there’s the matter of her pining endlessly, and fruitlessly, after dreary old Nick Arnstein (Omar Sharif). At least she’s allowed, finally, to feel nothing for him, but not until the picture’s last third. There’s so much wrong with Funny Lady that it’s almost impossible to find anything about it that’s right. Once you’ve exhausted Albert Whitlock’s wonderful matte work and Streisand’s good voice and amusing way with a quip you’re left with the horrible Ray Aghayan and Bob Mackie costumes that seem designed to make her look bad, the “Don’t Rain on My Parade” rip-off number where instead of chasing her love in a tugboat she flies off in a biplane, and the movie’s absolute nadir, the Harry Warren “Great Day,” in which a turbaned Fanny stands like a Caucasian goddess while black singer-dancers writhe around below her pedestal, worshiping her. Caan seems to have been encouraged to overact appallingly, and the Kander and Ebb songs aren’t up to their usual high standard. The sole exception is the wistful “Isn’t This Better?” but it’s badly staged and lit in near total darkness. James Wong Howe’s cinematography is well below par for this peerless innovator (he was ill, and filling in for the fired Vilmos Zsigmond) and just when you think you’ve seen everything, Ben Vereen emerges in his “Clap Hands, Here Comes Charlie” dance routine where, with jaw-dropping insensitivity, he’s dressed to resemble a watermelon, all whites and garish greens and pinks.\n\nCaan, whose occasional vocals were derided by record critics when the soundtrack album was released, actually sings with an exceptionally pleasant light baritone. But the way Billy Rose has been written is an insult to the people to whose songs he routinely added his own name when he’d been little more than a lyrical editor. E.Y. Harburg said Rose was a great editor but that’s not the same as writing a lyric, and to hear Caan’s Billy Rose berating the Crazy Quilt chorus performing Harburg and Harold Arlen’s “It’s Only a Paper Moon” (a song that wasn’t even from that show) for not respecting “his” words is insufferable. If ever a lyric reflected Harburg’s sensibilities, it was that one. And the poor man was still alive when this atrocity taking his credit away hit the screens. What a thrill that must have been for him.\n\nText copyright 2022 by Scott Ross\n\nPost-Script on Funny Lady, March 2023\n\nBy Scott Ross\n\nKing Rat (1965) An evocative, thoughtful yet curiously uninspired adaptation by Bryan Forbes of James Clavell’s debut novel, the first in his so-called Asian Saga. (The book, and the movie, are fictionalized memoirs of Clavell’s experience as a British prisoner of war in the Japanese camp at Changi.) This is one of those movies which while it honors its source and is by no means bad is difficult to work up much enthusiasm for. It’s a quality I’ve noticed before in Forbes’ work, notably Scéance on a Wet Afternoon (1964); considering the excellence of the Mark McShane novel on which it was based, the picture should have been a classic but lacks some almost indefinable element — the je nais se quoi of art — that might have lifted it into the Pantheon. The same is true of King Rat. It’s decently enough done, and it’s certainly well cast (George Segal, James Fox, Tom Courtenay, John Mills, Leonard Rossiter, Denholm Elliott, Alan Webb) but it’s a bore to write about. Forbes is workman-like, and earnest, but the divine spark was never lit in him. He lacks, say, both the crazy inspiration of a John Huston and the image-mad power of a David Lean. The result is work that holds your interest and is thoroughly respectable, but who wants respectability from a movie? Segal, Fox and Courtney embody their roles perfectly, although the latter’s is noticeably truncated, and the black and white photography is by Burnett Guffey, who two years on from this would light Bonnie and Clyde. The John Barry score, with its odd use of the cimbalom for a story taking place in Singapore is nonetheless splendid, anchored to one of his indelible main themes, which captures the essential melancholy and aloneness beneath King’s gregarious façade. But Clavell’s book, once you’ve finished it, haunts you. At the end of the movie all you’re liable to be thinking about is what you want for dinner.\n\nBreakheart Pass (1975) A dandy mystery thriller in the guise of a conventional Western which despite the then extremely popular Charles Bronson in the lead somehow failed to find its audience. Based by Alistair MacLean on his 1974 novel, which itself reads like an extended treatment for a screenplay, the picture has pace, intelligence, excitement, and character: Everything we look for in a good escapist movie and including as well a plot whose modest but intriguing complications would almost certainly preclude its being made today.\n\nEven so, Bronson was reportedly unhappy that the true nature of his character’s role in the story was revealed earlier than MacLean chose to do in his book and he was right to be upset; as much as anything else in the novel it’s the central mystery of just who the hell “John Deakin” is that keeps the reader happily turning the pages. But the picture has much to compensate for the lapse, including glorious Idaho location cinematography by the great Lucien Ballard; top-notch editing by Byron Brandt that takes in a blood-curdling sequence involving runaway train-cars filled with Union soldiers*; and a cast of old pros: Ben Johnson, Richard Crenna, Charles Durning, Ed Lauter, David Huddleston, Roy Jenson and Eddie Little Sky. Bronson’s wife Jill Ireland represents the younger generation, as the plucky dame who becomes Bronson’s confederate, and the former boxer Archie Moore (once a very fine if physically mis-cast Joe Mott in the live television version of The Iceman Cometh) has a fight with Bronson on top of the speeding locomotive traveling over elevated tracks above an unforgiving gorge that is the last word in white-knuckle stuff. Tom Gries directed with understated flair, and Jerry Goldsmith wrote one of his characteristically intense, propulsive scores.\n\nAt the time of the movie’s release Kevin Thomas in the Los Angeles Times called Breakheart Pass “a fun if familiar picture but is played so broadly on such an elementary level that it can hope to satisfy only the most undemanding of viewer.” I presume Thomas meant that superfluous “of” to distinguish his intellectual capacities as far greater than those possessed by us mere undemanding types. And by sheerest coincidence while writing this I came across, in the liner rotes for Film Score Monthly’s release of the Quincy Jones score for The Split (1968) a quote from the same critic in which he uses the self-concocted word “incredibilities.” Apparently Thomas was himself undemanding, at least as far as correct grammar was concerned.\n\nBullitt (1968) Steve McQueen’s allure eludes me. A performer who continually asks to have his lines reduced may be, as McQueen labeled himself, a “reactor,” but he’s not an actor. John Wayne called himself a reactor too, and while he knew he registered most forcefully without dialogue, or when it was minimal, he wasn’t afraid of words. As for the man’s alleged “cool,” what we most often see in him is a blankness onto which the audience projects whatever it thinks he’s thinking. And while I prefer to avoid comparing actors, which seems to me an exercise in futility, if you imagine every role for which McQueen became famous cast instead with Paul Newman, I think you can see what I mean about his essential lack. As Frank Bullitt he’s rather good, in his limited way, although it’s the picture itself, and the way it was written, directed, photographed and scored, that give Bullitt its most memorable qualities.\n\nAlan R. Trustman and Harry Kleiner’s screenplay, based on a clever, conventional 1963 police procedural novel by Robert L. Fish (writing as “Robert L. Pike”… get it?) set in New York City, is sharper, more elliptical and more ambiguous than its source, except in the area of ethnicity: The movie, as was common practice at the time (due perhaps to the threat of protest by Mafia front groups, or the interference of J. Edgar Hoover?) de-emphasized the presence of Italian mobsters in the narrative; “Johnny Rossi” in the Fish novel becomes “Johnny Ross” in Bullitt, and La Cosa Nostra is only ever referred to as “The Organization.” Still, I suspect a reasonably knowledgeable pubescent in 1968 could have figured out what was being implied. What resonates are the characters, and the way Bullitt chafes against the system, especially as represented by the politically ambitious San Francisco D.A. played, with mercurial oiliness, by Robert Vaughan. Lt. Frank Bullitt’s iconoclasm is made clear by the distinctive way he wears his gun holster (a trick McQueen picked up from Detective Dave Toschi, who would later become famous for his role in the SFPD’s investigation of the “Zodiac” killings) and by his Highland Green Mustang GT, which gets a memorable workout in the movie’s justifiably famous second act chase. The use of San Francisco, where nearly all the picture’s scenes were filmed, is equally distinctive, and makes you wonder why so few American movies were ever made there.\n\nThe chase, in which Bullitt pursues the killers played by the veteran stuntmen Paul Genge and Bill Hickman, deserves every plaudit it’s been given (in spite of that green Volkswagen Beetle that keeps popping up beside McQueen as he speeds over the hills and which he repeatedly passes) but William A. Fraker’s beautiful deep-focus cinematography offers far more than chases. The British Peter Yates directs with quiet assurance; the supporting cast, which includes Don Gordon, Robert Duvall, Georg Stanford Brown, Al Checco and a luminously beautiful Jacqueline Bisset as Bullitt’s architect girlfriend, is splendid; and the score by Lalo Schifrin is one of the era’s finest. Anchored to a main title theme that can trace its lineage to Schifrin’s own “Mission: Impossible,” the score is largely diegetic. But when underscore is required, the composer delivers his characteristically snaky rhythms and casually infectious melodies in a way that is both un-insistent and compelling; take special note of the way that theme accompanies Pablo Ferro’s distinctive credits. If Bullitt is “cool,” it’s largely Schifrin who makes it so.\n\nPrince of the City (1981) Like Serpico (1973), this Sidney Lumet-directed (and co-written) picture, based in reality, moves up the time-frame and changes the names of the participants. The former I assume was a result of budgetary constraints, the latter due perhaps to our strange libel laws. Despite these compromises, it’s an extremely well-crafted movie which while it skirts greatness is nonetheless as impressive today as it was when it was new. All the more so since this sort of big, expansive picture, made without unnecessary flourishes and concerning itself with what Faulkner called “the human heart in conflict with itself,” and which alone, he felt, made for good writing, is seldom produced any longer. It’s a slightly fictionalized account of the travails of Bobby Leuci, whose activities exposing corruption in the NYPD and motivated by his overwhelming sense of guilt over his own were recounted in Robert Daley’s 1978 book. Lumet (and Jay Presson Allen, his co-scenarist) move the action from the late 1960s and early 1970s to what appears to be the late ’70s and alter the identities of the participants, including a young Rudy Giuliani. Although Lumet and Allen are scrupulous about not vilifying the people involved, it is virtually impossible to view the sanctimonious, entrapment-happy Federal prosecutor played by Bob Balaban with anything less than disgust, an emotion his real-life progenitor also engendered in the readers of Daley’s book.\n\nPrince of the City runs nearly three hours and famously has over 100 speaking roles yet never feels long. Although Allen had originally wished only to produce the picture, in part because she was uneasy about the book’s structure, she and Lumet did an artful job of juggling a complicated narrative even as they, to a degree, fictionalized it for popular consumption. For Lumet, this sort of picture was as natural as the summer sun and it’s doubtful any of his contemporaries could have planned and delivered such a long, complex movie with such economy and fluidity. Treat Williams, known primarily at that time for his stage work and, on film, for his smashing performance as Berger in the underrated Miloš Forman-directed movie of Hair (1979) and who is in nearly every scene of the movie, gives an exceptionally layered performance as “Danny Ciello,” conflicted, guilt-ridden, arrogant, loyal, compassionate and all too believably human. Also in the large cast: Jerry Orbach (in his first good movie role as one of the men Danny is loath to rat out), Paul Roebling, James Tolkan, Lindsay Crouse, Ron Karabatsos, Lee Richardson, Lane Smith, Lance Henriksen and Cynthia Nixon. (Alan King, who had recently starred for Lumet and Allen in their very funny adaption of her novel Just Tell Me What You Want has a cameo as himself.) The superb, muted and deliberately claustrophobic photography is by Andrzej Bartkowiak.\n\nLumet was never sure how he felt about Bobby Leuci, an ambivalence pretty obviously shared by Robert Daley in his original book. Was he sincere in his desire to confess, and to root out police corruption, or was he an opportunist? Or (and this seems likeliest) both at once? That quality, of not taking sides, is one that runs through the projects Sidney Lumet directed and it deepens his best work, which very much includes this movie. When, at the end, as Danny is about to give a police lecture and a young detective on hearing his name rises and leaves saying, firmly but quietly, “I don’t think I have anything to learn from you,” the moment is exactly right; the look on Treat Williams’ face suggests that while the dismissal stings, Danny can’t blame the cop in the least for wanting no part of him.\n\nThe Great Waldo Pepper (1975) A slightly flawed masterwork of collaboration between William Goldman and the director George Roy Hill containing some of the most exhilarating airborne flight sequences ever filmed.\n\nThe Man Who Killed Don Quixote (2018) Terry Gilliam famously attempted to film this comic/dramatic fantasy, in a significantly different version, in 2000, the disasters attending it documented by Keith Fulton and Louis Pepe in what became their fascinating Lost in La Mancha. Gilliam should have quit while he was behind. And since he is one of the most inventive and ingenious filmmakers alive, I get absolutely no pleasure from saying that.\n\nLacking both the time and the inclination to assay what I consider, on a reading admittedly aborted after several hundred pages, one of the most overrated of all “classic” novels, I’ll simply note that Don Quixote is not merely overlong but annoying, repetitive, weirdly discursive and often downright dull. Doubtless its literary satire meant something to 17th century readers, particularly in Spain, but we moderns are left mostly with famous narrative scraps: The Don and the madness which leads him to believe he is a knight-errant; his chaste devotion to his mythical Lady Dulcinea; the resolute peasant pragmatism of his squire Sancho Panza; the battle with the windmill. And if I am put off by Gilliam’s source, I am even more alienated by his choice of leading man. If there is a more charmless, unappealing young actor around these days than Adam Driver, I don’t know who he might be.\n\nIf the picture was a mess, it might at least have been an entertaining mess. If you didn’t know Terry Gilliam was the director and co-author (with Tony Grisoni) I would defy you to guess he was behind the camera. Only fleetingly is there ever a sense of inspiration, or a flash of that daring and intoxicating go-for-broke fantasy which is the sine qua non of Gilliam’s style. Instead the movie feels formless and inert, as if it had been worked on too long and compromised beyond its maker’s ability to come to grips with the material. Only rarely are you amused or intrigued, and never moved. The only saving graces are Jonathan Pryce’s performance as the old man who embodies Quixote, the ethereal beauty of Joana Ribeiro as the object of Driver’s affections, the lovely music by Roque Baños and the often-exquisite cinematography by Nicola Pecorini. Even they aren’t enough to salvage the last shreds of your interest.\n\nWhat is sometimes more tragic than a dream deferred, is a dream realized.\n\nMurder by Death (1976) Neil Simon’s spoof of literary and cinematic murder mystery sleuths is, like a Mel Brooks movie of the period, a scattershot affair; much of what was funny then is still quite funny now, and the big laughs tide you over the more airless passages. It’s a movie that couldn’t be made today, and not merely because its cast is irreplaceable. (Well. Truman Capote should have been replaced, with an actor, but that’s another matter.) What I’m referring to is Simon’s parody of Charlie Chan, and Peter Sellers’ casting in the role. Never mind that “Sidney Wang” takes off, not from Earl Derr Biggers’ intelligent and articulate Chan but from the “Confucius say…” Hollywood movie version of him, or that he is made no more ridiculous than the figures in the picture based on Sam Spade, Hercule Poirot or Nick and Nora Charles (Elsa Lanchester’s “Miss Marbles” is for some reason treated less savagely, although she is more Girl Guide than little old lady). It’s the “Yellowface” issue, and the deliberate comic stereotype, that would doom the character today.\n\nThat’s not to mention two of the movie’s best and funniest characters, the blind butler and the deaf-mute maid. When I was 15, the sight of Nancy Walker “screaming her head off” nearly put me on the theater floor, and I fell completely in love with Alec Guinness’ sightless but unflappable manservant. I still find nothing offensive about them. Again, Simon isn’t poking cruel fun at the blind or the deaf but at the absurdity of these characters being employed as domestics. That Guinness, blissfully unaware that the woman can neither hear nor speak and Walker, equally uncomprehending of his blindness, are unable to communicate is a sick-joke that is inherently hilarious and is made more so by the peerless comic playing of those two old pros. The others (Sellers, Lanchester, David Niven and Maggie Smith as “Dick and Dora Charleston,” James Coco as the gluttonous “Milo Perrier” and Peter Falk and the marvelous Eileen Brennan as “Sam Diamond” and his Girl Friday) each have moments in which to shine, especially Falk and Smith. His Bogart imitation is more than creditable, and her sparkling way with a funny line reaches a kind of apotheosis when Niven whispers the meaning of necrophilia into her ear and she smiles wickedly before offering a masterpiece of upper class understatement. And when Simon has the inspired gall to invoke an old vaudeville line, Smith gives in to it, gloriously. Estelle Winwood, who was apparently never young, is even funnier as an elderly nurse than she was as “Hold Me, Touch Me” for Mel Brooks in The Producers and only Capote disgraces himself, although he’s less annoying now than he was when the picture was new if only for the opportunity he affords to study one of the more outré literary figures of the post-war era without having to worry that he’ll write another bad book.\n\nThe director, Robert Moore, was very successful in the theatre, where he staged among other things The Boys in the Band, Deathtrap, They’re Playing Our Song, Woman of the Year and Simon’s collaboration with Burt Bacharach and Hal David Promises, Promises. He had no particular style as a moviemaker but he knew how to frame a scene to the best advantage of his gifted cast, and how to pace what they do and say. In this he was aided immeasurably by the marvelous “old dark house” set designed by Stephen Grimes, Dave Grusin’s witty underscore and the wonderful poster and main title caricatures of the cast by Charles Addams.\n\nThe Ninth Configuration (1980) Among screenwriters and novelists, William Peter Blatty was perhaps the greatest argument against a strict Jesuit education. In a world which needs the healing laughter of a good comedy far more than an impassioned sermon on the afterlife, this gifted comic writer felt he wasn’t doing enough to convince the world that his God exists. Hence, the book and movie The Exorcist, and even the phenomenal success of those didn’t satisfy him. Going back to a previous novel (Twinkle, Twinkle, “Killer” Kane) that he felt was too formless Blatty sharpened and re-worked it as The Ninth Configuration, book and movie. And here I may seem to contradict my own critique of Blatty because, in spite of its author’s hectoring about faith, the final result is among the wittiest of post-war pictures, containing nearly as many quotable lines as All About Eve. Yet for all its strengths, which include a first-rate cast, it’s still a sermon, and not a very subtle one.\n\nFilmed in Hungary due to its financer, PepsiCo’s, stipulations, The Ninth Configuration concerns a government-run asylum peopled with psychological drop-outs from the Vietnam war and what happens when a new director, Colonel Kane, is brought in to run the place. In a series of Shavian arguments, Kane and the astronaut Captain Cutshaw engage in debate about, among other things, the nature of life, the existence of a deity and the possibility of life after death, surrounded by the most entertaining collection of creative loons this side of a Marx Brothers epic. It’s a one-of-a-kind movie, crammed with marvelous performances, scintillating dialogue and surprising moments of near-slapstick hilarity. And if the ending feels a last desperate act of proselytizing you may not mind when the rest of it is so unique and engaging.\n\nAlthough Blatty originally and disastrously cast the Scottish Nicol Williamson as Kane, Stacy Keach proved an inspired substitution, as did Scott Wilson as Cutshaw. Best among the supporting players are Ed Flanders as the asylum’s quietly acerbic resident physician with an agenda of his own, Jason Miller as an inmate determined to adapt Shakespeare for dogs and Neville Brand as the exquisitely frustrated Regular Army C.O. The splendid ensemble cast also includes George DiCenzo, Robert Loggia, Joe Spinell in an inspired performance as Miller’s carping assistant and, as a pair of sadistic motorcycle thugs, Steve Sandor and Richard Lynch. Aside from the evangelistic ending, I have only two additional complaints: I wish Moses Gunn’s role was larger, and that there was a little more of Barry De Vorzon’s very good music score. But if Blatty’s bent to religious propaganda was obsessive, it has to be admitted that he could certainly be an enjoyable nudze.\n\nSeven Days in May (1964) John F. Kennedy, who had been very keen on the movie of Richard Condon’s novel The Manchurian Candidate, which John Frankenheimer directed, was also enthusiastic about the potential of this adaptation of the Fletcher Knebel/Charles W. Bailey II thriller, to be directed by Frankenheimer as well. Kennedy had good reason to be; like the fictional President of the book, he was surrounded by traitors. Chief among these on the military front were the rabid anti-Communist General Edwin Walker and Kennedy’s own Air Force Chief of Staff, General Curtis LeMay, a monstrous psychopath who in addition to being the main model for the Burt Lancaster character here, was also the likely prototype for Dr. Strangelove‘s General Jack D. Ripper. Whether LeMay was involved in Kennedy’s assassination is, as with so many aspects of that murder, unproven (and probably unproveable). That he certainly shed no tears over JFK’s grave may be inferred with impunity. Kennedy knew to his cost that some of his worst enemies were not outside Washington but within his own Administration.\n\nThe President, alas, did not live to see the final product, for which he’d offered Frankenheimer the use of the White House, and by the time it hit the nation’s screens in 1964, the movie was doomed to low receipts by a ticket-buying public quite understandably wary of yet another violent coup, even if this one was fictional. Rod Serling’s adaptation is taut, and respectful of an almost perfectly-plotted novel, in which the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (Lancaster) plans the removal of the President (Frederic March) over a treaty with the Soviet Union. The picture is beautifully cast, with March giving one of his finest screen performances. Although the character’s name, Jordan Lyman, is a little too close to Lyndon Johnson for comfort, Lyman is, thankfully, no LBJ. March depicts with delicacy and precision a decent man who knows his actions are unpopular but who obeys the dictates of his conscience. That’s how you know the movie is fiction.\n\nLancaster gives one of those performances of his which, like his J.J. Hunsecker in Sweet Smell of Success, are measured, inflexible, cold, and vaguely terrifying; his final face-off with March is one of the great scenes in 1960s American movies. Ava Gardner has a good scene with Kirk Douglas, Martin Balsam as March’s Chief of Staff makes you genuinely sorry when he’s removed from the narrative, Hugh Marlow and Whit Bissell are appropriately oily as two of the conspirators, John Houseman gives a nicely judged performance (his first on film) as a shady Admiral, and a young woman called Colette Jackson contributes a wonderful cameo as a bar-girl perspiring in the Texas heat. Douglas is asked to play it stalwart and well-intentioned as the Marine Corps Colonel who unwittingly stumbles onto the plot against the President and gives roughly the sort of performance you’d expect; if you like him, which I do, you’ll enjoy it well enough. Best of all in the supporting cast is Edmond O’Brien as a bibulous Senator enlisted to investigate the existence of a secret military base, his rich, slightly ham-actor baritone memorably caressing his lines. Interestingly, while the time of the movie’s action is unspecified (the poster says 1970 or 1980 “or possibly tomorrow”) Frankenheimer approached it as if it was indeed the future, with video hookups and devices that would not have seemed all that out of place in 2014… (DARPA probably developed them 50 years before that.) Jerry Goldsmith composed a brief, effective score performed solely by percussive instruments. For some reason everyone who writes about this music feels compelled to say “piano and percussion,” as if they’re not the same.\n\nVictor/Victoria (Broadway, 1995) The ill-advised stage musical adaptation by Blake Edwards of his wonderful 1982 comedy, filmed for Japanese television on its Broadway opening night. Edwards had the notion when the movie was still relatively new, and Robert Preston was attached as well as Julie Andrews until he had second thoughts, deeming the project unworkable and “an ego-trip” for Edwards. To make matters even more dismal, Henry Mancini died while the show was being written, his and Leslie Bricusse’s new songs are, almost to a number, boring, and the two written by Frank Wildhorn are even worse. Andrews famously lost her singing voice as an indirect result of reprising her movie role here, the Rob Marshall choreography is his usual uninspiring mélange of borrowed styles, Tony Roberts overdoes his nelly queen interpretation of Toddy appallingly, and the only surprises are Gregory Jbara’s wonderful performance in Alex Karras’ old role and Rachel York’s wildly funny interpretation of Lesley Ann Warren’s.\n\nThe Wind and the Lion (1975) Early 20th century history re-written as a paean to Theodore Roosevelt, and as only John Milius could have conceived it. Yet somehow, beyond its support of gunboat diplomacy and its hagiography of one of the worst imperialists in American history, it’s so intelligent, and so entertaining, you almost forgive its determined machismo. This is due in large part to the actors: Sean Connery as the Berber Raisuli who kidnaps an American widow and her young children, John Huston as John Hay and the great Brian Keith in a wonderful turn as TR — less the Roosevelt of history perhaps than of Milius’ besotted imagination; of the real TR the British Ambassador once warned his superiors, “We must never forget that the President is seven years old.” As the widow, Candice Bergen gives her standard slumming job, but the movie’s most appalling performances are those of Geoffrey Lewis as the Moroccan US Consul-General Samuel R. Gummeré and, even worse, Steve Kanaly as the most avid of the American invaders. The widescreen cinematography by Billy Williams is glorious, and Jerry Goldsmith’s score is one of his very best, with a genuinely rousing recurrent main theme and a gloriously rhapsodic liebeslied for Connery and Bergen. The form of the narrative is right out of a Boy’s Own adventure, but Milius’ attempts to tell it through the eyes of Bergen’s son (Simon Harrison) are ineffective; a dream sequence near the end which strives to make this notion concrete falls about as flat as an un-stuffed qatayef. But Milius does get points for depicting the love story tacitly and the kidnapped boy and girl not as the usual squeamish and terrified victims but as the cold-bloodedly curious beings children of their age actually are.\n\nSpeaking of children, in her scenes as the young Alice Roosevelt, Deborah Baxter seems so completely infatuated by Father that the look on her face as she gazes at him borders on the incestuous. Or was that meant by the filmmaker as a comment on the future Mrs. Longworth’s pathology?\n\nThe Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean (1972) John Milius again, this time as screenwriter solely, with John Huston directing. Hollywood (very much including Milius) liked to depict Bean as a hanging judge but history tells us he was no such thing. Walter Brennan won one of his 37 assorted Academy Awards playing Bean in the William Wyler-directed The Westerner opposite Gary Cooper, where his death was every bit as fabricated as the mythic end the screenwriter concocted for him here. For Milius and Huston, Roy Bean becomes a kind of Pecos Bill figure, and when at the climax he disappears into a burning building on horseback chasing down his nemesis and never re-emerges, he’s been given a mythic exit out of American folklore cross-pollinated by its Classical European counterpart. It’s an odd picture, which Milius, who had originally hoped to direct it with Warren Oats, claims Huston and his star, the “cutsie-pie” Paul Newman, ruined. But it’s also an engaging one, once you acclimate to its tall-tale characters and structure. Despite Milius’ complaints, Newman gives into the nonsense completely and he’s vastly entertaining. The large, starry cast includes Anthony Perkins as an itinerant preacher, Tab Hunter as an early victim of Bean’s jurisprudence, Anthony Zerbe as a dangerous San Antonio hustler, Ava Gardner as Bean’s idol Lillie Langtry, Ned Beatty as his barkeep, Jacqueline Bisset as his daughter and, as if Bisset wasn’t stunning enough, a luminous Victoria Principal as his common-law wife. Roddy McDowall fulfills, in his unique fashion, the role of Bean’s pompous banker antagonist and the best of the actor cameos are those by Stacy Keach as the psychotic Albino “Bad Bob” and Huston himself in a rich comic bit as Grizzly Adams. (If you’re of my generation it might interest you to know that Bean’s pet bear is Bruno, who performed on television as “Gentle Ben.”) There’s also a terrible, headache-inducing atonal score by Maurice Jarre which includes a pretty but pointless ballad performed by Andy Williams over a dopey picnic sequence that smacks of the producer trying to recapture the joy of Newman’s musical bicycle ride with Katharine Ross in Butch Cassidy. Need I say that it doesn’t?\n\n*At 79, Yakuma Canutt ended his storied career as the picture’s second unit director and oversaw that sequence.\n\nText copyright 2021 by Scott Ross\n\nBy Scott Ross\n\nGreat Expectations (1946) One of David Lean’s best early features as a director, adapted from the Dickens novel by himself, the director Ronald Neame, Anthony Havelock-Allan, the actress Kay Walsh and Cecil McGivern. Gorgeously and disturbingly photographed by Guy Green and beautifully designed by John Bryan, the movie effectively telescopes the events of the book, at least until its unfortunate ending. Walsh wrote it, and while I take no issue with the notions of the adult Estella (Valerie Hobson) in danger of becoming the representation of her dead guardian nor of Pip (John Mills) bringing light to Miss Haversham’s rooms by opening the draperies, the sudden conversion of Pip’s former tormentor from brooding would-be recluse to laughing girl in love is risible, the only bad moment in the entire picture.\n\nI could have done with more of Ivor Barnard’s Wemmick, Eileen Erskine’s Biddy and O.B. Clarence as Wemmick’s Aged Parent, but it’s the rare literary adaptation that gives us so much and yet leaves us wanting more. While at 38 John Mills was a decade and a half too old for the role of Pip, and looks it, he gives a lovely performance, balancing hope, despair and resolution, and the supporting cast is superb: The young Alec Guinness (whose own stage adaptation of the book gave Lean the notion of making the picture), endlessly cheerful and accommodating as Herbert Pocket; Martita Hunt, equally deluded and calculating as Miss Haversham; Bernard Miles, gentle and sweet-natured as Joe Gargery; young Anthony Wager as the boy Pip, quietly stalwart and movingly buffeted less by fate than the selfish ruses of his elders and “betters”; Jean Simmons, astonishingly beautiful and exquisitely ruthless as the young Estella, so ethereally lovely it’s difficult to accept the much plainer Hobson as an older version of the character; Francis L. Sullivan, coolly shrewd as Jaggers, whom Pauline Kael memorably described as “that alarming upholder of the law”; and, supremely, Finlay Currie, at first frightening, then entirely endearing as the convict Magwich, whose cunningly staged first appearance in the cemetery at the beginning of the picture caused contemporary audiences to gasp and jump in their theatre seats, and still startles the unwary today.\n\nNotorious (1946) The second Hitchcock picture I saw as a teenager, at a late show screening (the first was North by Northwest, on television) Notorious, which I loved at 16, now seems to me to encapsulate everything both good and bad about its maker. Nothing in the nearly perfect script by the redoubtable Ben Hecht (and, as usual with him, an un-credited Alfred Hitchcock) is to blame for my uneasiness; it’s all to do with the alternately fussy and indifferent approach to the staging and photography. Why, for example, send a certifiably great cinematographer (Gregg Toland) to Rio to film rear-screen backgrounds and then make no attempt whatsoever to match them with your foreground shots, which seem phony in the extreme? Why make such a fetish of an elaborate crane shot from high in a mansion down to Ingrid Bergman’s hand, ludicrously clutching a key she has earlier tried desperately to conceal her possession of? Why show more care at framing a goddamned coffee cup than you do shooting your actors? These sorts of grandiloquent gestures, empty of feeling, which so delighted me in my movie-mad adolescence — Hitchcock’s slavish devotion to things rather than to people — are precisely what have turned me against so much of his work in the intervening decades.\n\nThat said, the picture is still endlessly fascinating for the way it plays its lovers against each other, the Cary Grant character’s wounded masculine pride militating against his very real feelings for Bergman’s estranged daughter of a Nazi spy. It’s a curiously perverse reaction, in that he sets her up as a lure for another Nazi (Claude Rains) and then faults her for succeeding so well; he’s a pimp who, like the mec in Irma La Douce, becomes insanely jealous of the whore on whom he makes his living. Hecht and Hitchcock’s distrust of the American government is obvious, astounding for the period, and wiser than either knew: The same sorts of intelligence agents they depict casually manipulating people here, in the pursuit of stopping old National Socialists from developing a hydrogen bomb, are stand-ins for the very men busily smuggling similar “ex”-Nazis into the Western Hemisphere after the war, expressly to work on our bombs. Neither could have been aware at the time of Operation Paperclip, but one can well imagine the professional Zionist Hecht’s reaction had he found out. But Grant and Bergman make a great team, he alternately doting on and sniping at her and she with that radiant anguish for which she pretty much held the patent in the 1940s. And Rains is oddly moving as their quarry; when he’s left to face certain death at the hands of his collaborators at the end, you ache for him in a way that feels uncomfortably ambiguous.\n\nOliver & Company (1988) The Disney animated feature just preceding The Little Mermaid, and pointing towards it. Its fulsome character design had a richer visual palette than was the case in ’70s Disney animation and, especially in the Bette Midler number, the picture suggested the Broadway and movie musical-savvy direction the studio, influenced by the lyricist/librettist Howard Ashman, was about to head. (Imagine: A Hollywood studio letting itself be directed by a lyricist!) Oddly, the characters were offset by stylized backgrounds in which all of the locations and most of the humans in them are rendered abstractly. The four exceptions in this loose adaptation of Oliver Twist are Fagin (Dom DeLuise), Sykes (Robert Loggia), the little rich girl (Natalie Gregory) who adopts the kitten Oliver (Joey Lawrence) and her butler Winston (William Glover). Fagin’s gang here are a pack of canine strays led by Billy Joel’s Dodger, who against his instincts gradually finds his resistance to Oliver melting, and which includes a preternaturally dumb Great Dane voiced by Richard Mulligan and a pompous, cultured bulldog given life by the great Roscoe Lee Browne. The Cheech Marin character Tito is roughly as annoying as an actual Mexican hairless, and Sheryl Lee Ralph’s Rita, whose singing voice was provided by Ruth Pointer, has too little to do to make a real as opposed to a vague impression. No Nancy, she. Midler, giving voice to the rich family’s pampered show poodle, also has a limited character to portray, one with no counterpart in Dickens. But she got a great, Busby Berkeley-like number called “Perfect Isn’t Easy” with apposite music by Barry Manilow and smart, funny lyrics by Jack Feldman and Bruce Sussman.* (For years I erroneously believed Ashman had written them but his work here was limited to the lyrics for Barry Mann’s opening anthem “Once Upon a Time in New York City”; still, that misapprehension is a compliment to Feldman and Sussman.) Oliver and Company is not, strictly speaking, a musical — it doesn’t have enough songs to qualify, few are related as the Midler number is either to plot or to individual character and, written by different teams, the score consists of too many warring styles for an organic feel — but it edges toward the form, and the staging of the numbers by the animating directors gives a hint of what was to come at Disney in the next few years.\n\nThe picture, if thin, is also sunny and agreeable despite the genuinely threatening presence of the homicidal Sykes, his menacing Doberman pets and a hair-raising subway and elevated chase at the climax that on a big theatre screen was suspenseful, and even, at times, genuinely terrifying. (It, and Sykes’ massive limousine, like Big Ben in Disney’s previous feature The Great Mouse Detective, were rendered by early computer animation, and look it.) George Scribner directed, and among the names associated with the movie are a number that would become prominent in the years to come: Kirk Wise, Roger Allers, Gary Trousdale, Tony Anselmo, Hendel Butoy, Andreas Deja, Mike Gabriel and the supervising animator Glen Keane.\n\nCactus Flower (1969) When I first saw this one as an adolescent, on television in the summer of 1973, it delighted me. Watching it again, via HBO in the mid-’90s, it seemed flat — smirky and unsatisfying. Seeing it a third time recently, on Blu-ray, it struck me as bright and extremely funny. Since the movie hasn’t changed in a half-century, I assume I have. (All right, I know I have. I’m being coy for a reason.) If I see the picture again in a decade, will I go back to finding it dated and un-funny?\n\nMaybe nostalgia has something to do with it. I was eight when the movie opened, and an immoderate fan of “Laugh-In,” on which Goldie Hawn was the adorable resident giggler. (The giggles were real; she couldn’t help it.) When she was given the Academy Award for the picture in 1970 there were grumbles, especially from the admirers of Dyan Cannon (Alice in Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice) and Susannah York, superb in They Shoot Horses, Don’t They? Seeing Cactus Flower now, when the award controversy has faded from most memories, it’s possible to simply enjoy Hawn’s performance as Walter Matthau’s kooky mistress for what it is: a very deft bit of comic acting accented by that charming wide-eyed wonder of Hawn’s which somehow cleanses the mildly risqué farce set-up, making it feel, despite her short skirts and dancer’s gams, about as erotic as a toothpaste ad.\n\nIt was, by the way, the dialogue and the performances I found so amusing this time around, not the wholly unconvincing plot (I.A.L. Diamond out of Abe Burrows via the French playwrights Pierre Barillet and Jean-Pierre Grédy). The spunky diegetic Quincy Jones score, a mélange of ’60s pop hit arrangements, also helps, augmented as it is by a lovely title song for which Cynthia Weill wrote the felicitous lyrics and Sarah Vaughan provided the lilting vocal. And speaking of nostalgia, it’s difficult not to feel something of the like watching Walter Matthau and Ingrid Bergman play out this essentially harmless silliness. Matthau of course was a master of the form, languid and wry, but Bergman makes the comedy feel completely grounded even as she gives in gloriously to the nonsense in which her character becomes enmeshed. 54 when the movie was made, she looks fabulous… but then she always did. Gene Saks, who the year before made the best of all Neil Simon movies with The Odd Couple, keeps the plot rolling along at a fast enough pace you don’t have much time to reflect on how ludicrous (and basically French) the whole thing is.\n\nMidas Run (1969) Equally silly and inconsequential but with far less to recommend it, this comic caper from the same year as Cactus Flower has several small assets but, alas, only a single great one. The smaller include the featured players such as Ralph Richardson, Adolfo Celi, Maurice Denham, Cesar Romero (in an exceptionally nasty role as a rich, sadistic roué), John Le Mesurier and Roddy McDowall; a pair of pleasant lovers in Anne Haywood and Richard Crenna; a spritely Continental score by Elmer Bernstein; a reasonably intelligent and occasionally amusing if utterly unlikely screenplay by Ronald Austin, James D. Buchanan and Berne Giler; some lovely photography by Kenneth Higgin; and brisk editing from Fredric Steinkamp. The jewel, of course, is Fred Astaire. Taking on the unaccustomed role of a British MI6 agent, Astaire elevates his usual purring elegance only slightly. When he literally strides into the picture at the beginning and all you see are his legs, it takes only a moment to recognize that famous walk of his — purposeful yet festooned with infinite grace. It’s a close as he gets to dancing in the picture, but it’s enough.\n\nThe movie, a modestly budgeted flop on its release, is merest fluff. Yet the director, one Alf Kjellin, known mostly for his acting, takes a few things with almost unnerving seriousness, such as the big lovemaking scene between Crenna and Heywood, which he shoots and edits in the worst and most self-consciously “arty” manner imaginable, even for 1969; the few paying patrons of this one must have looked at each and wondered whether the projectionist had suddenly slipped in a reel from I Am Curious (Yellow). And along with Romero’s “Joker Meets The Marquis de Sade” sequence, the screenwriters also have Crenna at one point needlessly taunt McDowall by comparing him to an interior decorator, a line that reminds you precisely why Stonewall had to happen.\n\nDie Hard (1988) If you ignore the inevitable franchise it spawned, to diminishing returns of pleasure, Die Hard remains an entertaining “high concept” picture, stylishly directed by John McTiernan and sharply adapted by Jeb Stuart and Steven E. de Souza from a much darker novel by Roderick Thorp, a brief sequel to his earlier brick of a bestseller The Detective. And if Bruce Willis’ smirk is too often on display, most of the supporting actors are poor, a few of them (Paul Gleason, William Atherton, Robert Davi and especially the appalling Hart Bochner) are wretched and none were helped by the sour dialogue they were given, still the structure is sound, Michael Kamen’s score and Jan de Bont’s cinematography decided assets, and Willis, Bonnie Bedelia, Reginald VelJohnson and Alan Rickman are all in excellent fettle.\n\nExcalibur (1981) John Boorman’s low-budget epic out of Mallory, planned from the early 1960s, co-written by Rospo Pallenberg and filmed largely in the lush, sylvan vicinity of the director’s own Irish home, seemed thin and cold when it was new. It still seems thin and cold, but somehow I mind that less now. It certainly feels, by 21st century standards, no more undernourished than the latest American franchise or tent pole picture, or whatever they’re calling these things now and if nothing else it contains in Nicol Williamson’s marvelous performance as Merlin one of the great, hammy jobs by an outsized actor.\n\nWhatever my reservations at 20, I was always impressed by Boorman’s vision, and his ability to express it on a minimal budget: The picture is lush and, within the limitations of low cash-flow and the special effects capacities of the time, magical. My only real cavil now has to do with the musical score. I don’t mind the overlays of Wagner and Orff — the use of excepts from Parsifal during the quest of Sir Percival (Paul Geoffrey) is very much to the point, and the “O Fortuna” out of Carmina Burana is more or less right for the Arthurian period. The problem is that Trevor Jones’ original compositions clash so badly with the interpolations. But Alex Thomson’s cinematography has both heft and delicacy and the production design (Anthony Pratt), art direction (Tim Hutchinson), set decoration (Bryan Graves) and costume design (Bob Ringwood) could scarcely be improved upon. And along with Nigel Terry’s very fine Arthur and Helen Mirren’s deliciously witchy Morgana, the striking pulchritude of a frequently naked Nicholas Clay as Lancelot, the Pre-Raphaelite beauty of Cherie Lunghi as Guenevere and the fiercely patricidal Mordred of Robert Addie you can also savor the robust early appearances of Gabriel Byrne, Liam Neeson and Patrick Stewart.\n\nSummertime (1955) Has any European city ever been given so rapturous a cinematic frame as Venice gets in this David Lean adaptation of the Arthur Laurents play The Time of the Cuckoo? Nearly every image in the picture shimmers with the ecstasy of a besotted lover’s glance, yet nothing in its feels like mere picture-postcard ostentation. Jack Hildyard’s color cinematography perfectly captures the lure of the city and the Katharine Hepburn character’s fascination with it, and seeing the movie in a good print can make you feel as if color photography was invented solely for this movie.\n\nLean, working with the novelist H.E. Bates and an un-credited Donald Ogden Stewart, condensed the Laurents play and flattened it, to the dramatist’s chagrin. It isn’t as fully peopled as The Time of the Cuckoo, and I think losing the moment where the Hepburn character makes trouble for the young married couple at her pensione out of pettiness over her own heartbreak is a mistake. I suppose it was done so the movie audience would not hate her, even momentarily, and the hint that she is capable of it must have been deemed enough.\n\nCecil Beaton infamously wrote about Hepburn’s bad skin in his diaries, and the color photography emphasizes how poorly she was aging. I also find her performance as a middle-aged Ohio(!) spinster finding romance with a philandering Venetian a bit much generally, what with its self-conscious posturing and overplayed emotional responses that make you long for Ingrid Bergman or Olivia de Havilland, both of whom were considered for the role. But Hepburn has some good, true moments, particularly in her scenes with charming little Gaetano Autiero as her unofficial ragazzi tour-guide. Rossano Brazzi makes a strong impression as her somewhat opportunistic lover, Jane Rose (who was in the play) and MacDonald Parke provide rich comic relief as the American tourists who stretch but never break the patience of everyone around them, and the recurrent musical theme by Alessandro Cicognini is a honey. Lean’s direction seems to me exactly right, whether the action takes place in the expanse of the Piazza San Marco or in one of Alexander Korda’s beautifully designed interior sets and it’s obvious that this, the director’s first picture in color, expanded his already impressive sense of vision enormously.\n\nExperiment in Terror (1962) A tight little thriller written by the Gordons and directed by Blake Edwards with a strong feeling both for the suspenseful elements and for the city of San Francisco, which he and his gifted cinematographer Philip H. Lathrop shot with clear eyes and a little, perhaps inevitable, romanticism, in crisp black and white.\n\nAs the young bank teller targeted by a possibly homicidal thief Lee Remick acts with that ineffable mixture of strength and vulnerability which were her particular forte, and she is especially effecting in the opening sequence in which she is first accosted by her tormentor, filmed by Edwards in long, and very tense, takes that would be unheard of in today’s filmmaking climate, where the camera doubtless would be flying over her head and rotating madly around her body.\n\nThe young Stefanie Powers makes a strong showing as Remick’s teenage sister, and the last shot of her, traumatized into wide-eyed catatonia, makes you worry for her future. Ross Martin, hidden even from the opening credits and deliberately shot obliquely by his director until well into the picture, is properly frightening, so much so that when he shows up in drag late in the proceedings you aren’t even tempted to giggle. Patricia Huston is splendid as a woman with a secret, Anita Loo and Warren Hsieh as a “subject of interest” to the cops and her invalid son get a couple of fine scenes, Ned Glass has an excellent role as a paid police stool-pigeon, Roy Poole and Clifton James good ones as FBI agents and even Glenn Ford is better than usual as the chief investigator. Henry Mancini wrote one of his distinctive suspense scores, appropriately taut and creepy but with time out for some contemporary jazz and a little ersatz Gay Nineties pop for the sequence in the ludicrously overstated theme-bar.\n\nIt Happened One Night (1934) Frank Capra’s best movie, with a nearly perfect screenplay by Robert Riskin from Samuel Hopkins Adams’ 1933 novella “Night Bus,” concerning a runaway heiress’s misadventures on the road. Riskin cannily mated Adams’ charmingly wiseacre picaresque with the then-popular “newspaper picture,” and turning Peter Warne (Clark Gable) from an unemployed engineer to a fired reporter automatically raised the stakes for the leads. (It also grounds Warne’s educated wit and savvy.)\n\nGable and Claudette Colbert were both reluctant stars of the movie but Gable gradually understood while filming how good it, and his role, were; Colbert never did. Both were given Academy Awards — in the first such “clean sweep,” so did Capra, Riskin and the picture itself — and they’re a terrific comic/romantic pair, deftly batting sharp wise-cracks at each other as they slowly fall in love. Walter Connolly shines as Colbert’s millionaire father, Alan Hale has a funny sequence as an aria-singing crook, Ward Bond effectively portrays a surly bus driver, and Roscoe Karns is appropriately nasty as a smug, vulgar opportunist.\n\nIt Happened One Night is sometimes described as a screwball comedy, and it isn’t, really. But there’s not a line, a scene or a moment in the picture that plays false, and Capra’s populism is blissfully and blessedly unfettered by his usual simultaneously grandiloquent celebration of, yet ambivalent unease with, The People. If there is anything else in his work as unabashedly sexy as the “Walls of Jericho” sequence, or as effortlessly charming as the joyous impromptu sing-along on the bus in this movie, I’m unaware of it. Very few pictures provide as much unalloyed pleasure as this one and if there are people who hate it I don’t want to know who they are.\n\nMurder on the Orient Express (1974) The perfect escapist movie with which to mark the beginning of the end of a truly terrible year, the worst of whose machinations were pretty obviously manufactured. An all-star enterprise, and what stars! Who have we now to compare with the likes of Albert Finney, Martin Balsam, Ingrid Bergman, Sean Connery, John Gielgud and Wendy Hiller? Who like Paul Dehn to write, Sidney Lumet to direct, Tony Walton to design, Geoffrey Unsworth to photograph and Richard Rodney Bennett to score?\n\nNote to ambitious actor/directors: This is how you make a glamorous movie mystery whose stylistic flourishes compliment, yet do not overwhelm, the material.\n\nI Bury the Living (1958) Steven H. Scheuer in his Movies on TV deemed this atmospheric little B-movie chiller “3⁄4s of a good thriller,” which seems exactly right. Generally well-written by Louis A. Garfinkle and effectively directed by Albert Band, it’s a little overstated — characters tell each other what they should already know, never a good sign — the ending is a bit of a letdown, Gerald Fried’s hysterical score is appallingly bad, and Theodore Bikel’s old-age makeup is wretched. (Although that may owe more to the otherwise good Blu-ray remastering than to the black-and-white original. In a time when the reporters’ faces in the screening room at the beginning of Citizen Kane, deliberately obscured by Orson Welles, get fully revealed by digital ignoramuses, one never knows.) But within the parameters of its flaws and budgetary limitations lies a compelling story about a reluctant cemetery chairman (Richard Boone) who may or may not have telekinetic abilities, the retiring caretaker (Bikel) both more and less than he seems, and a map that at times appears malevolently alive. Boone gives his usual peerless performance, Band had a keen eye for framing, Frederick Gately’s cinematography is effective and despite the picture’s shortcomings (or perhaps because of them?) watching I Bury the Living seemed to me the perfect way to bid adieu to the deliberately-planned worst year of the 21st century.\n\n*Note for the trivial-minded: In the early ’70s, Manilow was Midler’s musical director and accompanist at the Continental Baths in New York where both got their start, so Oliver & Company marked a pleasant reunion.\n\nText Copyright 2021 by Scott Ross\n\nBy Scott Ross\n\nNothing I’ve seen so far this year has elicited in me a great desire to write a full review. Hence this installment of minis.\n\nThe Man from Laramie (1955) The sixth and final collaboration between James Stewart and the director Anthony Mann is a solid adult Western, although not a patch on their best work together. It’s based on a well-regarded novel by Thomas T. Flynn, originally serialized in The Saturday Evening Post, and with a screenplay credited to Philip Yordan and Frank Burt. Burt was a frequent contributor to Stewart’s splendid, short-lived radio series The Six-Shooter; Yordan was one of the busiest fronts of the blacklist era, but as he claimed authorship of any number of disputed scripts whose actual writers later challenged his participation, it’s anyone’s guess whether he wrote a word of this one, or who else might have. The credit itself is less urgent than that the material begins promisingly and, while never less than intelligent, devolves irredeemably into melodrama — probably because there is simply too much plot for one brief movie to contain. Stewart, seeking the seller of rifles to Apaches (and whose Cavalry brother has died as a result) finds himself at loggerheads with an isolated town’s wealthiest and most powerful family of ranchers, led by Donald Crisp, secretly going blind and haunted by recurring dreams in which a stranger murders his arrogant son (Alex Nicol). His foreman (Arthur Kennedy), meanwhile, struggles to make his worth clear to the old man while battling the "
