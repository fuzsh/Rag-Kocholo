        "text": "“Sold Out” was filmed in Minnesota during the second coldest winter in history. Despite the polar vortex, we managed to capture the warmth, have a blast and keep all of our toes. We used Twin Cities-based cast and crew and were fortunate to film at iconic locations such as First Avenue and the Stone Arch Bridge.\n\nOur film stars veteran stage actor Sam Bardwell and Juilliard alum Kelsey McMahon. A complete list of cast and crew can be found here.\n\nThe movie is directed by Tim Dahlseid, who’s an award-winning photographer known for his visceral style of storytelling. He has directed commercials, documentaries and short films. This is his first feature.\n\nSusan Brightbill is our writer and producer. Brightbill is a WGA writer who has sold scripts to Warner Brothers, Disney, Fox 2000, Paramount, CBS, ABC, Lifetime, Hallmark and Arnold Kopelson Prods. Her script “Wrecking Ball” has been on the prestigious Blacklist.\n\n“Sold Out” was produced by Joanne Hoffman who is an entertainment attorney and producer, specializing in production and distribution. She executive produced “Manic,” starring Joseph Gordon Levitt and Zoey Deschanel, and she produced “Dirt” starring Luke Perry and Jennifer Tilly.\n\nOur co-producers are Maura & Bobby Marko. They starred in and produced the award-winning documentary “The Arrowhead Traverse” and are enthusiastic writers, photographers and adventurers. Check them out here.\n\nWe’re honored to feature songs from world renown singer/songwriters. If you like what you hear, please support these artists directly by following the links below."
