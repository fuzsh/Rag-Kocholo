Business owners choose us over high-street banks because we make faster lending decisions, typically within 24 hours, and our loan terms are much more flexible. Both of these features are crucial for small business owners, and are only possible due to the technology we have developed over the last decade. With more than 130,000 small business loans processed, we have ample data to build market-leading risk models. This data-driven approach also allows us to lend to businesses that are outside the restrictions imposed by the high-street banks, especially when they don‚Äôt have multiple years of trading.‚Äù Find out more on the link below! üëá https://lnkd.in/ezuFRYzm #funding #investment #SMEs #smallbusinesses\n\n15\n\nA very insightful piece by Mark Sherlock CFA FCA and his journey investing in the US Small and Mid Cap space. Some key highlights for me were on the focus of eschewing fashionable stocks and preferring to look for below-the-radar, multi-year compounders, often in quite unglamorous parts of the market. üîç Put another way, when you look in areas that are overlooked, you may be less likely prone to paying a high multiple. üëÄ Add on top of that a steady and sustainable growth profile (one that may be deemed boring and unexciting), the combination is not a bad recipe for long-term compounding returns! üìà So long as you believe the intrinsic value of a business is growing over time and you avoid paying too high a multiple, this ensures safety of principal and a margin of safety = downside protection! ‚úÖ Inverting this...paying too high a multiple for a business with declining intrinsic value is a sure way for upside destruction! üí• The other part I found interesting was \"the downside of investing in businesses of lesser quality: leveraged, low barriers businesses are cheap for a reason, and many do not last for long!\" üìâ What can sometimes happen is that companies that look optically cheap, should actually be much cheaper! ‚¨á Over an investment horizon, you are fighting against time. Although you may identify valuation upside to intrinsic value, that upside may shrink over time as some lower quality businesses may have declining intrinsic value.üëé Put another way, for a compounder, time is your friend. For a decliner, time is your enemy. ‚è∞ Finally, a pertinent reminder on the importance of downside protection: If you lose half your money in a stock, it has to double in order for you to break even. This can seriously affect long-term returns! üí∏ link in the comments.\n\n3\n\n1 Comment\n\nBankers Bonuses to be Uncapped! Barclays is the latest bank to remove the EU cap that was placed on bankers bonuses. The cap was brought in after the 2008 Financial Crisis and was agreed by all members in 2014 to be capped at 2:1... This change highlights the fact that the UK is no longer beholden by the EU and as such can start to make the industry much more lucrative to employees across the EU then it could before. For many looking at where to go for their careers it makes the UK a much more appetizing destination and could see many top banking professionals move to the country from other parts of the EU. It will be seen how this helps the banking industry......the idea behind caping the bonuses was to stop incentivizing the risk inherent within the industry and stop another potential crisis from happening. We wait to see the full ramifications of this move....... https://lnkd.in/eBRqbWQ3\n\n2\n\n1 Comment\n\nOne of those Thursdays that sums the job up perfectly‚Ä¶ This morning‚Äôs daily meeting with the investment team discussed the key overnight investment themes, including US #MonetaryPolicy and investee earnings releases. Next up, time to write some responses to investment questions posed in a potential client RFP. Then its a call with the fabulous Simon Woolnough and Elle McKeogh to plan some exciting ways of spreading the word about the Epworth Investment Management Limited #MultiAssetFund - watch this space! After a quick bite to eat, its time to meet the management of an exciting new potential #AlternativeAsset that I have been researching for the fund, very interesting session! Following that, an #Engagement call with one of our investee companies to discuss their #Biodiversity strategy as part of #NA100+. With all that and plenty more wrapped up, just enough time to put my cheeky 9 month old daughter to bed before dinner. Bring on Friday! #SustainableInvestment #CharitableInvestment\n\n10\n\nWith inflation seemingly under control and the growth outlook improving, we believe July‚Äôs election will offer many investors a chance to reevaluate UK equities, where valuations are attractive and return prospects look strong. Key takeaways: - With the economy turning a corner, we think UK equities offer some of the best investment opportunities in developed markets today. - Depressed valuations and a potential reversal of outflows from UK assets are two factors boosting return prospects for UK equities. - With the opposition Labour party ahead by nearly 20 points in the polls, they look likely to win a clear majority in the general election that Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has called for 4 July. - Radical spending plans have been absent from the Labour campaign and fiscal headroom is limited, meaning this election poses far less risk to markets than previous ones. By Simon Gergel, CIO UK Equities at Allianz Global Investors #NavigatingRates #UKElection #UK #Equities\n\n\"Rumours of my demise are greatly exaggerated\" A recent survey by investment manager Downing LLP found 65% of institutional investors surveyed had a significantly or slightly bullish outlook on UK equities over the next 3 years. At the same time we have a new cohort of companies looking to list in the UK, including Quantum Group/Volopa. Great to be a part of a growing company during a promising time in UK markets. \"Quantum Group, which hopes to achieve a valuation in excess of ¬£1 billion with a float in early 2025. The company bills itself as an ‚Äúincubator‚Äù for financial technology and cybersecurity businesses, and is led by founders Floyd Woodrow, its chief executive, and Peter Malmstrom. Malmstrom said Quantum, which owns tech brands including B2B expenses management company Volopa, would aim to sell 10 per cent of its shares on the LSE\" - https://lnkd.in/eK8jEqcS - https://lnkd.in/e2V5xd9z\n\n15"
