SIDELIGHTS: Steven E. de Souza is a writer, director, and producer of television shows and films. His work on such blockbusters as Forty-eight Hours and the Bruce Willis action films Die Hard and Die Hard 2: Die Harder earned him a reputation as a writer who creates nonstop thrills with a dash of humor.

Interestingly enough, de Souza got his start by appearing on a game show on which he won a car. While on the set, he snuck into the offices of the show's staff and left behind some of his writing. The tactic worked; he was given a job as a story editor for Universal Television. He then managed to work his way into other writing jobs and soon found himself writing for such popular television shows as The Six Million Dollar Man, The Bionic Woman, and Knight Rider. Despite writing and directing his first film, Arnold's Wrecking Company, in 1973, de Souza was still focusing on television when he got a big break with the Eddie Murphy and Nick Nolte hit, Forty-eight Hours

Forty-eight Hours is about a cop named Jack (Nolte) who agrees to let a jailed criminal named Reggie (Murphy) out of prison for two days if Reggie will help him on a case involving some gang members the criminal was once involved with. While critics found the plot uninspiring, the doses of humor injected into the plot by comic actor Murphy made the movie a box-office success. As Michael Blowen put it in a Boston Globe review, while the film proved to be "one of the most derivative cops 'n' robbers films" of the 1970s, "Murphy grabs the movie by the throat and almost rescues it from oblivion."

De Souza got a much more positive reception with his movies Die Hard and Die Hard 2: Die Harder. Cast in the lead of both films, Willis plays McClane, an average-Joe cop who thwarts terrorists and thieves while cracking jokes and surviving explosive action scenes. In the first film, released in 1988, McClane manages to stop a group of thieves who have captured a skyscraper in downtown Los Angeles, and in the sequel he frustrates a plot by terrorists to rescue a dictator from government officials at an airport. Of the second, Pete Croatto wrote in FilmCritic.com that although the story is not as good as the first "Die Hard" installment, he appreciated how de Souza makes "McClane additionally human by supplying him with some of the funniest dialogue in action movie history." Roger Ebert, writing in the Chicago Sun-Times, asserted that Die Hard 2 "tells a story we can identify with, it has a lot of interesting supporting characters, [and] it handles the action sequences with calm precision."

Though some of his films, such as Beverly Hills Cop, III and the science-fiction movie Judge Dredd, have not been well received by critics or moviegoers, de Souza remains one of the busiest and most respected writers in Hollywood. Some of his more recent projects include a supernatural thriller called The Presence and a highly popular adaptation of the video game Tomb Raider that starred actor Angelina Jolie in the lead role.
