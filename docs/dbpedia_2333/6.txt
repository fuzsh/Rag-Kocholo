The Peninsular War: A New History by Charles J. Esdaile

For years Spain had been the most feared and predatory power in Europe - it had the largest empire and one of the world's greatest navies to defend it. Nothing could have prepared the Spanish for the devastating implosion of 1805-14. Trafalgar destroyed its navy and the country degenerated into a brutalized shambles with French and British armies marching across it at will. The result was a war which killed over a million Spaniards and ended its empire. This work comes to terms with this conflict, immortalized by Goya and the arena in which Wellington and his redcoats carved out one of the greatest episodes in British military history.
