I could not have been more stunned when the President pulled this surprise on me, but I am delighted to be of service to him in whatever way he prefers. As you kindly noted, I am in a bit of a rush around here right now -- about 35 Senators this week! Let me respond to your several helpful points quickly, mainly because I don't want to miss out t Your recommendation on arrived just in time. I heard about him from several other people a few hours before gettin our letter. I had told my staff, 'ho, there just isn't time to see next week. \" With your letter in hand, I definitely will. Appreciate your suggestions on reading. I have read Roberta's book and am in the midst of Ray Cline's new book. I have staff working over the Church Report to pare it down to something I can possibly handle. I'll keep in mind.

My reason for writing was twofold: First, to let you know that at long last I have worked my way through the dissertation by You sent it to me some time ago, and I promised to get it back to you by registered mail. I liked it very much; it was particularly revealing to me to see how very closely the events of 1964-66 with respect to Greece, Turkey, and Cyprus have been repeated in 1974-76. I almost couldn't believe that I was reading history of a dozen years ago. I am going to take the liberty before mailing it back of asking my POLAD if he would like to look at it and one officer on my personal staff who does most of my special studies on topics like this. I will, however, have it on its way back to you by registered mail within a few weeks. As you may detect, I got to it during the Christmas-New Year's holiday period. This is not the first time that I've spent a part of a slack period reading material sent to me by Vince Davis--and always to good effect. Thanks. Second, I wanted to check on whether there is still any possibility of your coming over for active duty next summer. After reading your Christmas card I began to wonder if you will have time for an active duty stint or not. My hope that you would spend your next one with us here is still very real and alive. I much appreciate your comments on the Foreign Affairs article and your generous but most exaggerated comments to your reserve personnel concerning my background, friends, and future.

All the best.

The business and civic leaders in the pleasant Kentucky cony munity of Lexington are currently striv- ing as they never have before to sell products abroad and to attract foreign investment to their city. Their effort re- flects in microcosm the extent to which the United States has grown to rely on the international economy. And it further suggests that, despite the warnings of observers overseas, fears of an isolation- ist trend in America are unwarranted. American investment abroad has in- creased fourfold over the past fifteen years and U.S. exports have soared more than fivefold within the same period. Within the past decade, too, foreign in- vestments in the United States have nearly tripled. Just as IBM and General Motors and Pfizer are now fixtures in places as disparate as Stockholm, Cara- cas and Teheran, so we have Michelin, the French tire company, opening a new plant in South Carolina, while Volkswa- gen plans to build cars near Pittsburgh and Sony is already producing electronic equipment in San Diego. EXPORTS MAKE JOBS The American drive to export has been spurred in large measure by U.S. bal- ance-of-trade deficits as well as by the realization, during the recent recession, that every million dollars' worth of mer- chandise sold abroad supports approxi- mately seventeen jobs in the United States. On the basis of the latest esti- mates, this means that close to 2 million Americans owe their employment to for- eign trade-a small percentage of the total labor force compared to Japan or West Germany, but unusually high for a country which until not long ago barely considered exports to be significant to the economy. Another new phenomenon that ac- counts for foreign firms shifting their capital to the United States is the fact that inflation, social-security costs and other elements have made American labor rel- atively inexpensive, especially for man- ufacturers who are seeking to tap the U.S. consumer market. Last year, for ex- ample, hourly compensation in the Unit- Newsweek, August 30, 1976 International Edition ed States, including fringe benefits, stood at.$6.22, compared to $6.32 in West Germany. In 1960, the respective figures were $2.66 for the United States and 83 cents for West Germany. Add to this the fact that currency-exchange rates are tilt- ed against export industries in certain European countries, notably West Ger- many, and their relocation of factories in the United States becomes logical. EXPLORING POSSIBILITIES Compared to states like New York, California and even Jimmy Carter's Georgia, which have been looking abroad for years, Kentucky is only now beginning to explore the possibilities of expanding its business activities over- seas. As James Roberts Jr., the state's deputy commerce commissioner, puts it: \"We're just crawling, but we're crawling forward.\" In May, for instance, Kentucky's Gov. Julian Carroll journeyed to Tokyo in an endeavor to involve the Japanese in his state, and he is scheduled to make a similar trip to Europe in September. The state is also preparing to open a perma- nent office in Brussels in order to push trade and investment. When the office opens, Kentucky will be the 25th Ameri- can state to maintain a regular represent- ative in Western Europe. Several states have offices in Japan and Latin America as well. This regional competition for business overseas may seem strange to foreigners, but it is a very real reminder of the fact that the American states, though united, still regard themselves as sovereign in many respects. FOREIGN BUYERS Although Kentucky is trying to catch up with other states, some of its enter- prises have already made headway in international business. The breeding of thoroughbred horses, for example, is a local specialty that has long evoked for- eign interest. Within the past couple of years, French, Irish and Japanese have been purchasing horse farms in the state, and a few weeks ago, at the famous Keeneland auction held in Lexington, foreign buyers included a Saudi Arabian tycoon who spent more than $500,000 on animals and a Canadian group that paid a record $1.5 million for an offspring of Secretariat, the great stallion. Kentucky is also an important exporter of feed grains, soybeans, whisky 'and, of course, tobacco. And a peculiar deal was con- summated recently when Egypt bought a number of tons of Kentucky River sand, which was flown to Cairo in order to test silting in the Nile. Another curious deal is now pending between Kentucky's Island Creek Coal Co., a subsidiary of Occidental Petrole- um, and the Romanian Government. Un- der the arrangement, the Romanians would invest more than $50 million in Island Creek in exchange for a minority share of the company and guaranteed deliveries of premium metallurgical coal used in the manufacture of steel. The potential agreement would, to my knowledge, mark the first time that a Communist regime has acquired an eq- uity in an American corporation, and I look forward to seeing how the dictator- ship of the proletariat behaves when the coal miners go out on strike, as they do occasionally. SCHOOL OF DIPLOMACY Reaching beyond the economic realm, . I ought to mention that the University of Kentucky, also located in Lexington, fea- tures a school of diplomacy that trains young men and women for international positions, provides scholarships for for- eign students, and has sponsored guest lecturers like former U.S. Secretary of State Dean Rusk and Denis Healey, Bri- tain's Chancellor of the Exchequer. It would be a gross exaggeration, with all this, to submit that Kentuckians in particular and Americans in general are becoming as international minded as Eu- ropeans and Japanese, whose survival reposes on foreign trade. Most Ameri- cans still feel, I think, that they could get by on their own if necessary, and most would probably prefer the United States to be self-sufficient, if that were possible. In the wake of the Vietnam tragedy, they are also turning away from the idea that they must commit themselves to a broad spectrum of responsibilities abroad, and they are understandably focusing more and more on their domestic problems. At the same time, though, they are plainly aware that they cannot withdraw from the global economic picture without se- riously reducing their standard of living. Thus the notion that the United States may be sliding back into isolationism is an illusion, and, as I discovered in Ken- tucky the other day, even provincial Americans recognize that reality. ? Approved For Release 2009/08/28: CIA-RDP05SO062OR000200480026-0 BY STA. _EY KARNOW Approved For Release 2009/08/28: CIA-RDP05SO062OR000200480026-0 An International Business Resource The University of Kentucky's Patter- son School of Diplomacy and Interna- tional Commerce has emerged in recent years as an important source of advice and assistance for business and banking interests in the Blue Grass region which desire to become more active in interna- tional trade and investments. \"We cer- tainly do not have all of the answers at our finger tips,\" says Dr. Vincent Davis, Director of the Patterson School, \"but we think that we can quickly assist any business or banking executive in this region to make contact with the right people who will have the answers to any international trade questions. Although our own Patterson School administrative staff is very small, we have widespread contacts among top experts around the U. S. and around the world.\" The Patterson School was founded on the UK campus in 1959, about a half- century after Dr. James K. Patterson- the first UK President-stipulated in his will that his personal estate should be converted into a trust fund for this pur- pose. The will also stipulated the long delay, in order that the fund could be appropriately invested and thus gain substantially in value. Dr. Patterson, of Scottish ancestry, had a shrewd appre- ciation for the importance of wise long- term investments. The Patterson School got off to a strong start in 1959 under its first Di- rector, Dr. Amry Vandenbosch, but a loss of momentum and an uncertain sense of direction became serious pro- blems for several years following his re- tirement in 1965. Dr. Otis Singletary, moving to Lexington as UK President in 1969, quickly decided to resolve these problems in favor of a strong new be- ginning for the School. A nationwide search was initiated for a new director who could move to UK to carry out the broad new mandate. Dr. Davis was chosen in this search in 1970, and moved to the campus in the summer of 1971. He had previously held faculty positions at Princeton, Dartmouth, the Naval War College, and the Graduate School of In- ternational Studies in Denver. A native of Tennessee with a B.A. from Vander- bilt, he holds three graduate degrees in- cluding his Ph.D from Princeton. He has published numerous books and articles in his own special research field, Ameri- can foreign and defense policy, and is often used as consultant by U. S. govern- ment agencies including White House staff groups under four Presidents. He adds that his wife Anne is an important partner in his interest in international business. She was born and raised in Brazil where her American father was for many years the president of Federal Lexington/14 LEXINGTON Magazine (published in Lexington, Kentucky) -- June 1976 Express (originally a subsidiary of Bald- win Locomotive of Philadelphia), the largest supplier of complete railroad systems in that South American nation. Dr. Maurice A. \"Mickey\" East is the Associate Director of the Patterson School. A native of Trinidad, Colorado, he received his B.A. degree from Colgate and his Ph.D. from Princeton. His back- ground includes a year as a Fulbright Fellow in Norway, and service as the Rockefeller Foundation Visiting Profes- sor at Makerere University in Uganda, East Africa, during the year immediately before moving to UK in the summer of 1972. Another key member of the Pat- terson School staff is Executive Assistant Lilliam Pancorbo, a native of Cuba who previously served as executive assistant to the academic vice president of the University of Florida after receiving her own undergraduate education at that school. Lil Pancorbo is also a potter of distinction, with stoneware pottery stu- dios in her Lexington home and at The Twig Gallery in Midway. Purpose A primary purpose of the Patterson School is to prepare young people for internationally oriented careers in a wide variety of fields. The word \"Diplomacy\" in the School's name actually refers to Approved For Release 2009/08/28: CIA-RDP05SO062OR000200480026-0 public career possibil:.:,,.. ;?, -- aarr- --'-1.'-1 '---:---l _.._a- - it governmental a _Approved For Release 2009/08/28: CIA-RDP05SO062OR000200480026-0 international operations, says Dr. DL and the term \"International Commerce\" refers to career options in internationally oriented business and banking contexts. At this time, Dr. Davis adds, most Pat- terson School students are more interest- \"l in the private sector possibilities in siness and banking, and the School's programs are therefore more strongly oriented in this direction. The Patterson School works in close cooperation with many other units on the UK campus, including the; College of Business and Economics, the College of Law, the De- partment of Agricultural Economics in the \"Ag\" College, and many Arts and Sciences departments such as History and Political Science. Summer Programs The Patterson School tries to help its students to supplement their formal classroom work with useful practical experiences in the summertimes. In re- cent summers including '76, school stu- dents have served internships with the Council on International Economic Poli- cy in the White House, and the Agency for International Development (AID) also in Washington. In the summer of '76 a total of five school students will study international trade opportunities at the University of Cluj in Rumania, under the leadership of UK Professor Charles Hultman, senior specialist in internation- il economics, and also Chairman of the Patterson School Faculty Advisory Com- mittee. Recent Patterson School. graduates are now holding responsible positions such as the following: director of Latin Amer- ican operations for the First National Bank of Memphis; senior international business research economist for Norfolk and Western Railway; and international grain trading specialist for Cook Indus- tries, Inc. Patterson School alumni are also working in business or government positions in Belgium, France, Thailand, Nigeria, Brazil, Turkey, and the Soviet Union, to name just a few. Dr. Davis adds that many Patterson School students would be particularly interested in job opportunities with internationally orient- ed business firms and banks in this Blue Grass area. \"Our students are willing to start at the bottom and to learn a busi- ness from the ground up,\" he says. Unique in Southeast Dr. Davis tells us: \"The Patterson School is one of only about a dozen the only one in the southeastern states. This gives us an opportunity to serve the Commonwealth of Kentucky not only in various direct ways, but also to invite favorable attention to our Blue Grass area and the entire state by acting as an international resource and research center for the overall southeastern region. Our basic mission, however, is to serve the Blue Grass directly, and we strongly desire to be of all possible assistance to business and banking interests in this area-not just those firms and banks that are already involved internationally, but also those that may wish to consider this. Again, we have to stress that our own Patterson School staff capabilities are very limited, but we can undertake some marketing research, and we can put local people in touch with the experts in almost all fields of internationally re- lated business and banking, regardless of where those experts may be. We can organize special business seminars and other kinds of programs directly tailored to the international interests of businesses and banks in our area. We want to help `sell the Blue Grass' worldwide, because we have a great product.\" The Patterson School has a Board of Advisors which includes not only some of the most prominent business and bankint; executives in Kentucky, but also similarly distinguished people from around the nation and the world. Some of these are two vice presidents of First National City Bank in New York, the senior vice president of Squibb, Inc., the president of U. S. Cocoa Corporation, the vice president of Exxon for European operations, a vice president of Pullman Corporation, a senior partner of Arthur Andersen & Co., famed journalists such as Joseph C. Harsch, three college presi- dents, several internationally prominent lawyers, a former Governor of the Fed- eral Reserve, and a number of noted diplomatio, political, and military leaders from the U. S. and other nations. This Board of Advisors meets in Lexington twice each year. Robert M. Brewer, President of the Greater Lexington Area Chamber of Commerce, has appointed Dr. Davis (a Chamber member) to serve as Chairman of the Chamber's new Advisory Panel on International Commerce. Dr. Davis, working closely with Chamber President- elect Clyde W. Mauldin, indicates that he and Mr. Mauldin will have an im- portant announcement to make about the initial plans and expectations for this new Advisory Panel in the weeks to come. JOSEPH B.

In his report (which does not appear in the domestic editions) Karnow notes, \"That going a radical transformation as they traditionally insular Americans are under- develop an increasing familiarity with the outside world.\" Karnow continued, \"The business and civic leaders in the pleasant Kentucky community of Lexington are striving as they never have before to sell products abroad and to attract foreign investment to their city.\" The article suggests that Lexington represents a microcism of the United States to the extent that the United States relies upon the world economy.

The Kamow visit, coordinated by Dr. Davis of the Patterson School, Kentucky Commerce Department officials and of- ficers of the Lexington Chamber of Com- merce, discussed the ramifications of Governor Carroll's recent ventures to Europe and Japan. While not new, Kentucky is the 25th state to open a permanent office on the continent, it does represent an important investment that promises to provide a rewarding return. The column correctly notes that although \"Kentucky is trying to catch up with other states, some of its enterprises have already made head- way in international business.\" Thoroughbred sales, grain exports, to- bacco, sand and coal are cited as ex- LEXINGTON Magazine (published in Lexington, Kentucky) -- Nov. 1976 ducted in the Commonwealth. Beyond the .economic realm, K:;rnow points out the educational outreach pro?- vided by the Patterson School at the University of Kentucky. The school is an excellent training facility for persons en- tering the international levels of business and government. The Newsweek article, \"Crawling To- ward A World View,\" concludes by say- ing that it would be a gross exaggeration to suggest that Kentuckians in particular and Americans in general are becoming internationally-minded. But, Karnow rightly asserts, \"the no- tion that the United States may be slid- ing back into isolationism is an illusion, and, as I discovered in Kentucky the other day, even provincial Americans recognize that reality.\" Energy Week Kentuckians are being asked to join in a statewide project to conserve all forms of energy. The Special emphasis was called Energy Conservation Awareness Week, Novem- ber 7-13, sponsored by the Kentucky De- partment of Energy and proclaimed by Governor Julian M. Carroll. \"We need the help of all Kentuckians -not only during this special week but throughout the year-in our drive to help save our scarce supplies of energy,\" said Damon W. Harrison, Commissioner of the Kentucky Department of Energy. \"Conservation makes sense because in many cases it costs us nothing and we are able to save money as well by not wasting our precious energy resources,\" Harrison said. And he emphasized that conservation does not mean doing without. It simply means using energy more wisely and avoiding wastefulness. Community leaders across the Com- monwealth are being asked to promote local projects that emphasize energy con- servation. Such things as energy conser- vation seminars, store displays, advertis- ing, school posters contests and other programs can be arranged to promote energy saving practices.

He settled on international studies and began shopping around for a school that offered what he felt he needed. His undergraduate grades were so good that he had little trouble getting accepted, even at some of the nation's prestige uni- versities. He selected the University of Ken- tucky and its Patterson School of Diplomacy and International Com- merce. \"I've never regretted that choice,\" he says. \"I got every- thing I was looking for there: plenty of business courses, an international affairs background-and a good sense of direction.\" When graduation rolled around, Sweatt also received about a half dozen job offers. He picked First National Bank of Memphis and joined the international department, where he became Latin American manager. His education and job experience enabled him to quickly move up the ranks, and today he is one of the top officers of the bank's Knoxville affiliate, holding the position of vice president and senior administrative officer. Sweatt's success story is not unique. It is one that has been re- peated time and again in states throughout the South. The interna- tional education graduates of the some 40 universities and. colleges in the region that offer internation- al curricula have, with only rare exceptions, made a smooth and easy transition from campus to employ- ment. In fact, those with advanced degrees have normally been able to pick and choose from several jobs offered them. And today, many of those graduates have matched-and a few have surpassed-the note- worthy achievements of David Sweatt. As recently as ten years ago, however, such a story wouldn't have been possible. There simply were no schools in the region offer- ing a comprehensive international education program, and only a hand- ful even included international-re- lated courses of the type found at universities in other parts of the nation. All that began changing with the emergence of the South's new atti- tudes toward the importance of inter- national trade. As companies in the region began seeking markets over- seas and as the various states launched efforts to lure new in- dustry from abroad, the higher-edu- cation institutions were called on to provide the managers and execu- \"...The international education graduates in the region have made a smooth and easy transition from campus to employment...\" tives with expertise in the interna- tional field. Such universities as Kentucky, Houston, North Carolina, Tulane and Miami led the way and established schools or upgraded old ones in order to offer students what the region's industry, business and government required for its middle- and top-management positions. Today, a student can find excel- lent programs throughout the South, whether his interest lies in inter- national affairs, international busi- ness, international finance or inter- national marketing. The 1976 edition of the authoritative directory of education, Peterson's Annual Guides to Graduate Study, lists five uni- versities (Georgia State, Louisiana Tech, Texas Tech, Dallas and South- ern Methodist) offering a master's program in international business. Of those five, Georgia State con- fers a doctorate in the field. Peterson's also lists 11 Southern universities that offer graduate de- grees in international affairs. In that category is David Sweatt's alma mater, the University of Kentucky.* Its highly regarded Patterson School has made its mark as one of the best of its kind in the nation. Its vigorous and articulate director, Vincent Davis, has also gained na- tionwide recognition in both the academic and business communities. (He is current president of the In- ternational Studies Association, a group of professionals from several international fields, and is active in numerous other international en- deavors.) Davis has been largely responsible for the Patterson School's excellent reputation. But that reputation hasn't come overnight. It has resulted from long hours of attention to quality and detail in faculty, curriculum and admissions. Yet businessmen at many South- ern-based international companies- some even in Kentucky-are pretty much unaware of the school and its many attributes. In fact, despite recent efforts of universities through- out the South to promote their in- ternational schools, business and industry rarely take advantage of what their local universities can provide them in the way of train- ing or personnel. And business isn't alone in this attitude. Government too is guilty- and not just of apathy, but also of ignorance. Fred Dent, Special U.

S. Secre- tary of Commerce, asked during a presentation earlier this year if there is \"an academic institution in the United States dedicated to research in and training of people in trade-policy matters.\" He further stated that government and the pri- vate sector should \"attempt to stim- ulate the development of such an entity.\" Kentucky's Davis and others like him in the international academic field would resoundingly answer that such \"entities\" already exist and that, as a matter of fact, one of the best of its type is located in Dent's home state (at the Univer- sity of South Carolina). Still, such errors might be for- given, even from someone like Am- bassador Dent, for schools such as the one at South Carolina have emerged in number and prominence only within the past few years. And some, like those at Texas Tech, Florida International and Duke, among others, are still in various stages of development. Not so the Patterson School. Am- bassador Dent notwithstanding, most top experts in the field hold it in particularly high esteem. And to some it represents the ideal that many other similar schools should strive for. This enviable position hasn't been achieved without problems, how- ever, some of which have been almost lethal. The school is named after Wil- liam Andrew Patterson, son of the first president of the University of Kentucky, James K. Patterson. The elder Patterson stipulated in his will that when he died, the assets of his estate would go toward creat- ing a school of diplomacy and inter- national commerce. In 1959, the school was finally established, and it flourished under its first director, Amry Vanderbosch. After Vanderbosch's retirement in the mid-1960s, however, the repu- tation of the school slipped badly, and by 1970 the school's demise seemed imminent. But Otis Singletary, who took over the reins of the university in 1969, had other plans for the school. They called for exclusive emphasis on the master's degree program, thereby eliminating the previous doctorate offering. His major decision, how- ever, was to bring to the car, s an entirely new management staff for the school. That's when Vincent Davis, an in- ternational educator, writer and con- sultant, was called on to direct the school. His first task after assuming duties in August 1971 was to beef up the faculty and add new program categories and activities. During the ...Despite recent efforts. of universities throughout the South to promote their international schools, business and industry rarely take advantage of what their local universities can provide them in the way of training of personnel... \" first three years of Davis's tenure, more than 500 professors, research scholars, diplomats and other prom- inent figures visited the university to participate in the school's various conferences and lectures. In all, Davis estimates, several thousand persons attended those activities. The total program now. operated by the school includes three broad categories: (1) the master's profes- sional degree program, (2) research (including research conferences, publications and related activities) and (3) community and public ser- vice to the citizens off-campus with- in Kentucky and neighboring states. Director Davis points out that the second and third of these categories are always utilized, at least in part, to complement and supplement the first. \"In other words,\" he says, \"we want everything we do to bene- fit our students in some way or another, and we attempt to involve our students in all Patterson School activities.\" Almost all graduate schools offer- ing international education operate similarly to the one at the Univer- sity of Kentucky. Like the Patter- son School, they require that at least half of the ten courses need- ed for a degree be taken within some one discipline. At Patterson, the discipline is often chosen from economics (international), business administration (emphasizing world business), history (modern diplo- matic history) or political science (international and comparative poli- tics). The student splits his remain- ing courses or hours between two other disciplines. Another Patterson structural re- quirement is that the total package of courses must fall into three fields, with about half of the courses organized into one field and the re- mainder divided between two others. The Patterson School helps decide the field that's right for the individ- ual student, and, say school of- ficials, there is considerable latitude in that matter. For example, a field might be as diverse as Latin Amer- ican studies or national develop- ment. The third structural requirement is that at least half of the courses must be at the 600 or 700 levels. Those are the numerical designations used at the University of Kentucky for courses reserved exclusively for graduate credit. The remaining courses for degree credit must be at the 400 or 500 level, either of which is open to upperclass under- graduate students and to graduate students. The final requirement is that all Patterson School students, with rare exceptions, must take a special semi- nar before earning the degree. This seminar is designed to bring the student's conceptual or theoretical knowledge together so that he can apply it to current front-page inter- national issues. The school stresses to both student and potential employer of its grad- uates that the curriculum aims at pro- viding the professional training needed for a career and is not merely an extension of undergraduate liberal arts education. Explains one school official. \"For most young people growing up and going to school in the United States. the basic formula for success is to get better-than-average grades and stay out of any serious trouble. The person who does this will make a good impression on teachers and professors, who will then be happy to write good letters of reference that will help the student to move on to more advanced levels of school- ing. \"But,\" he adds. \"the Patterson School is not in business to help students move on to some further level of formal education. For al- most all our students, the school is Approved For Release 2009/08/28: CIA-RDP05S00620R000200480026-0 ^ Tq?f1:,101 RNAI_ Approved For Release 2009/08/28: CIA-RDP05S00620R000200480026-0 or ought to be the terminal p.,int of a process of formal education that began about 20 years earlier at the kindergarten level. Of course, in our rapidly changing world, the truly dedicated and successful pro- fessional person can never really afford to stop learning at age 30- or even ages 40 or 50 and 60- but this further learning will ordinar- ily occur on an in-service, on-the-job or self-designed basis rather than in a formal degree-granting program on a campus. \"The Patterson School will be the final degree-granting formal educa- tional institution that most of our students will ever attend, or at least the final such program prior to sig- nificant on-the-job experience in a career field.\" Beyond the training of persons to enter the international field, how- ever, the Patterson School is com- mitted to upgrading the general pro- fessional field of international stud- ies. Through its research and public- service programming, the university arranges, either on its own or in cooperation with community organi- zations, special events on subjects that can help the individual busi- result is that there has sometimes been a minimal amount of exchange between the business and education communities. At the Federal Re- serve Bank of Atlanta, for example, two employees and one former of- ficer, all of whom deal in interna- tional economics, admitted to having little or no contact with Georgia State University, whose Institute of International Business is regarded as one of the best in the nation. Georgia State is located only a few blocks from the bank. Also, there's the feeling from some corners that the instruction provided by the international education schools is not responsive enough to the needs of business and finance. One of the most respected inter- national bankers in the region, George A. Collin Jr., vice presi- dent and manager of the internation- al department of Liberty National Bank and Trust Company of Louis- ville, says that the constantly chang- ing world situation makes interna- tional policy or international finance courses virtually worthless. \"If we were looking for someone here at the bank, we would look for a person with a marketing, economics or accounting background,\" he says. \"Frankly,\" he adds, \"I don't think there's a college around that can turn out a graduate ready to step into a job in the international field.\" William S. Baker, vice president in the international division of North Carolina National Bank, Charlotte. would generally agree with that assessment. He said he feels that an international education background is important, \"but rarely.\" he adds, \"do we take graduates from an international school and put them directly into the international divi- sion. Instead, we would start them out in. a department such as credit and then later perhaps bring them in with us.\" Much the same is true at First National Bank of Birmingham. Wil- liam M. Miller, vice president in the international department there, says First National is similar to other banks in its hiring policies. \"We look for someone with exper- ience and training,\" he points out. \"And this often means we will have to find a person from outside the region.\" As for Southern companies en- gaged in international trade, few have been exposed to international educa- tion graduates, but word is apparent- ly getting around fast. A. Keene Byrd of Byrd Enterprises, Char- lottesville, Va., typifies the reaction from most top international business executives in the region: \"I keep hearing good things about the grad- uates of the international schools in the area. I believe that in a few years such a person is the type I will be seeking for this company.\" nessman. Typical of these are the numerous symposiums, conferences and workshops held on a continuing basis. Such programming is in keep- ing with the school's policy of work- ing with community organizations and groups in improving general pub- lic knowledge about current major international issues. Such programs have been received enthusiastically by the international business community in the area. And the participants have over- whelmingly endorsed the continua- tion of those activities. Still, despite the successes of such programs and despite the obvious quality of the Patterson graduates, the school is not without its de- tractors. And, in fact, most of the international education schools in the South will readily admit that many of the institutions and companies in the region-even some of the largest ones-are negative toward the international programs offered by their local universities. Much of that criticism can be traced to lack of information about the relatively new schools. In get- ting the schools established and func- tioning properly, school officials have lacked time to devote to any full-scale promotional effort. One The top 12 International fields of study are now taught at more than 40 colleges and universities in the Southern United States. That com- pares to only a handful as recently as 1970. The following universities have been selected by executives of international companies, international bankers, and state and federal government trade officials as the region's top 12, based on inter- national-related curriculum, faculty and quality of students or graduates in the international fields: Alabama, University of Dallas, University of Florida State University Georgia State University Houston, University of Kentucky, University of Miami, University of North Carolina, University of South Carolina, University of Texas at Dallas, University of Tulane University Virginia, University of Approved For Release 2009/08/28: CIA-RDP05S00620R000200480026-0"
