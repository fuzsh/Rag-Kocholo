The designation would result in implementation of a plan which will establish a framework for comprehensive management; including surveillance and enforcement, resource studies, and interpretive programs. Specific regulations are proposed that control the taking of coral, wastewater discharges, cutting of mangroves, and prohibit gear used for the illegal taking of turtles. The Interpretive Program proposes the development of visitor centers at La Parguera and Cabo Rojo; a mangrove boardwalk and trails, and a program of exhibits and educational material for the public. The Resource Studies Plan proposes to assess and monitor water quality and circulation, endangered species and fishery populations. Data from the resource studies would be used by sanctuary managers to make decisions on sanctuary operations. Alternatives to the proposed action include the no action alternative, low and high cost options, and a non-regulatory alternative. Lead Agency: U. S.

National Marine Sanctuary Program As development accelerates in coastal and marine areas, Federal, State and local governments, and private groups are working with management tools to achieve balanced development of marine resources. As part of the response to this challenge, the National Marine Sanctuary Program provides special protection to valuable marine habitats and associated species with long-term programs of comprehensive management. Title III of the Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act of 1972 (amended in 1980), authorizes the Secretary of Commerce with Presidential approval to designate ocean waters as national marine sanctuaries for the purpose of preserving or restoring their conservation, recreational, ecological, or esthetic values. Where State waters are included, gubernatorial approval is also required. The Act is administered by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) through the National Ocean Service's Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management (OCRM), Sanctuary Programs Division. The Program's mission is the establishment of a system of national marine sanctuaries geared towards long-term benefit and enjoyment of the public. The goals of the national program are to: � Enhance resource protection through the implementation of a comprehensive, long-term management plan tailored to the specific resources; � Promote and coordinate research to expand scientific knowledge of significant marine resources and improve management deci sionmaki ng; � Enhance public awareness, understanding, and wise use of the marine environment through public interpretive and recreational programs; and � Provide for optimum compatible public and private use of special marine areas. Sanctuary designation provides for the comprehensive management of special marine resources and offers a measure of protection not found under existing authorities. Management plans are developed for each marine sanctuary to guide implementation of the sanctuary's goals and objectives and the research and interpretive/education programs. The proposed La Parguera National Marine Sanctuary would be the seventh designated site since passage of the Act in 1972 (Figure 1). The other sanctuaries are: 0 The Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary located off the coast of southern California. The sanctuary protects valuable habitats for marine mammals and seabirds and extensive kelp bed communities. 1 NATIONAL MARINE SANCTUARY SYSTEM Point Reyes/ Farallon Islands A A U.S.S. Monitor Channel Islands A Gray's Reef Key Largo Coral Reef A Looe Key 0 The Gray's Reef National Marine Sanctuary, a live bottom ecosystem, supports a diverse array of temperate and tropical species. The sanctuary, which is located east of Sapelo Island, Georgia, insures that the resources of the site are maintained in their natural state. 0 The Key Largo Coral Reef National Marine Sanctuary provides protective management for a highly-utilized coral reef ecosystem south of Miami, Florida and assures the area's continued recreational appeal. � The Point Reyes - Farallon Islands National Marine Sanctua consists of marine waters off the California coast north of San Francisco that contain especially noteworthy populations of marine mammals and seabirds. � The Looe Key National Marine Sanctuary consists of a portion of The Florida reef tract off Big Pine Key. It contains a well- developed coral reef and a diverse marine community that support high recreational use. � The U.S.S. MONITOR National Marine Sanctuary protects the wreck of the well-known Civil War ironclad, which is located in the waters southeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. B. History of the Proposal In May 1979, six sites were nominated for consideration as a National Marine Sanctuary by the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. The sites were Cordillera/Culebra/Vieques, Salinas/Jobos, Cayo Berberia/Caja de Muertos, La Parguera, Mona/Monito Islands and Desecheo Island (Figure 2). Information was distributed to the public for comment on the feasibility of these sites as marine sanctuaries. As a result of public review, three sites were selected for further analysis: Cordillera/Culebra/Vieques, La Parguera, and Mona/Monita Islands. In May 1981, an Issue Paper was distributed and workshops held on the final three sites. Following the workshops a decision was made by NOAA and DNR to develop draft management plans and environmental impact statements on the proposed La Parguera and Mona/Monita sites. A DEIS scoping meeting was held in Washington, D.C. on July 22, 1981. This document contains the draft management plan and environmental impact statement for the proposed La Parguera site. 3 0 C E A N 0 A T L A N T I C 0 Santuario Marino Nacional La Parguera San Juan National Marine Sanctuary Figure 2 M Lugares de AOL.

General Context for Planning The island of Puerto Rico is part of the 70U island tropical chain called the West Indies. Volcanic in origin, it is bordered by a shallow, jagged insular shelf, which reaches seaward two to seven miles. Its location, climate, hydrological conditions, and geographic features have created a unique marine environment which supports one of the world's extensive pristine coral reef systems, mangrove forests, and unusual bioluminescent bays. The island also shelters many rare and endangered plant and animal species as well as a variety of marine mammals and species of fish. Thousands of tourists visit Puerto Rico annually to enjoy its spectacular beaches, coral reefs, wildlife, and fishing. Tourism, primarily from other U.S. territories and states, ranks high among the growth sectors of the Puerto Rican economy. The number of non-Puerto Rican tourists ranged from somewhat more than 900,OUO in 1968 to approximately 1.7 million in 1980, with some annual changes reflecting recession and recovery of economic activity in the mainland. Tourist expenditures were at the level of $200 million at the beginning of this period, and $615 million in 1980. It is estimated that about half of the tourists are Puerto Ricans returning to the Island for family visits. Situated in the semi-arid southwestern sector between two major population centers, La Parguera is a popular weekend recreational area for tourists--both Puerto Ricans and non-resident visitors. It is also a \"port-of-entry\" for commercial fishermen in southwestern Puerto Rico. The offshore waters boast one of the most extensive coral reef systems in the islands with 23 separate reefs hosting a wide variety of fish and coral species. Extensive mangrove forests line the coast and huge meadows of seagrass cover the bay floors. Sightings of endangered manatees and endangered and threatened sea turtles are frequent in this area and mangrove cays in Bahia Montalva support the largest nesting population of brown pelicans in Puerto Rico. La Parguera's bioluminescent bays continue to draw scientific researchers from all over the world. Bioluminescence in coastal bays is rare throughout the world. However, light-emitting plankton are found in very high concentrations in Bahia Fosforescente and to a lesser degree in Bahia Monsio Jose located to the east and west of the La Parguera village, respectively. Within these shallow bays, a brilliant display of bioluminescence is created nightly by the churning of the bay waters by boats and/or by schools of fish. Such activity stimulates the dinoflagellates (Pyrodinium bahamense) which actually produce the light. D. Purpose and Need for Designation The impacts of human activities in La Parguera have been minimal in the past and as a result, the area is still a living laboratory where visitors can see, study, and enjoy a relatively pristine tropical ecosystem. Each year more and more visitors come to La Parguera to enjoy boating, swimming, scuba diving, snorkeling, fishing and vacationing. While the expected increase in tourism in these areas will boost regional economies, recreational development may also become a cause of concern (for more details on issues and problems, see Part II, Issues and Problems Associated with the Natural Resources of the Proposed LPNMS). 5 For example, a non-functioning sewage treatment plant at La Parguera and increased vacation homes are creating water pollution problems. The 23 coral reefs which skirt its coastline are facing damage by divers who are unaware of the fragile ecology of these living communities and existing protective regulations. Poaching of threatened and endangered sea turtles for eggs and meat stil.1 continues. The phenomena of bioluminescence depends on delicately balanced rates of seawater exchange and may be jeopardized by pollution. Fears that unrestricted development in upland drainage areas causing erosion, sedimentation and pollution, and constant boat tours will upset the unique conditions that make Bahia Fosforescente possible may be legitimate. Although Commonwealth and Federal laws and regulations extend protection to some La Parguera marine resources, important marine communities such as some mangroves and seagrasses lack legal protection. Onsite surveillance and enforcement actions by DNR Rangers and Federal agents are presently limited by lack of personnel. Only two rangers patrol an area exceeding 68.27 square nautical miles of coastal water and open sea. None of the Federal agencies with law enforcement authority in the area maintain a sufficient onsite presence to adequately protect the resources. Although the University of Puerto Rico Marine Science Laboratory, located directly offshore of La Parguera village, hosts student and other academic groups, there is no program in La Parguera aimed at resource interpretation and orientation of the visitors who come to La Parguera regarding the resources and the need for conservation. There are numerous scientific papers on the La Parguera region prepared largely under the auspices of the University of Puerto Rico graduate marine science program by its professors and students. However, there is no clearing house to assess and evaluate research needs or coordinate overlapping studies for the purposes of environmental management. The concept of increased protection for the La Parguera area is not new. There has been a history of concern and action regarding the resources of La Parguera. In 1960 the National Park Service, in cooperation with the Commonwealth government, completed an investigative report for Bahia Fosforescente. The report concluded that the bay was an extraordinary feature seriously threatened by deterioration from man's use of the area and that measures should be taken to protect it. In 1968 plans were developed and proposed in a report titled \"Bioluminescent Bays of Puerto Rico\" also advocating the bay's long-range preservation. Although protection has been considered since 1960 a clear management plan has not as yet been adopted. In 1972, a report to the Governor of Puerto Rico entitled, Puerto Rico and the Sea, proposed the creation of a system of Marine Environmental Sanctuaries. This report was simply another example of the long perceived need for protection and management of this unique environment. A National Marine Sanctuary would finally address this need and ensure the future conservation of the La Parguera marine resources. The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, through actions over the past years, has recognized the value of La Parguera as a recreational and prime natural resource area. The area has been designated a natural reserve by the Planning Board and a management plan is being developed as part of the plan to manage 6 coastal land use and related activities in the Southwest Special Planning Area. In light of the emphasis on protection of the area's resources on one hand and the issues and problems on the other, the concept of a marine sanctuary for the area is compatible with past and present management efforts for the La Parguera region. E. The Draft Management Plan/Environmental Impact Statement A draft management plan has been prepared for the proposed La Parguera National Marine Sanctuary. The plan describes the proposed management scheme which seeks to preserve and maintain the tropical marine communities while allowing compatible uses. Part II, Management Context, provides a general background of the area. It discusses the natural resources, social and economic factors, and issues and problems associated with resource use and protection. Part III, Management Measures, seeks to meet the concerns and needs for long-term resource protection. Three major programs based upon management goals and objectives for the LPNMS have been developed--an Administration and Operations Program that strengthens onsite surveillance and enforcement measures; an Interpretive Program to expand the user's knowledge of the natural environment and the impacts of human actions; and a Resource Studies Plan focused on identifying priority management related marine research, resource assessment and monitoring at La Parguera. The Administration and Operations Program will provide a management and enforcement focus for the proposed sanctuary. Implementation will rely upon existing DNR staff in San Juan and the Mayaguez region and will result in additional staff for onsite management. At a minimum, new staff would include a sanctuary manager, a part-time naturalist/ranger, a full-time ranger, and one clerical person. A Headquarters/Visitor Center would be constructed to house interpretive programs and provide office space. As part of operations, regulations are being prepared to protect and control certain activities affecting resource quality. The regulations include controls on the taking of coral and bottom formations, cutting of red mangroves, certain discharges, removing or damaging submerged cultural resources and a prohibition on the use of nets designed for the illegal taking of sea turtles. The regulations set fines for commission of prohibited activities and establish a permit system under which certain prohibited activities may be allowed. The Interpretive Program seeks to inform the public about resource issues and concerns by focusing on selected areas and features. It will enhance public understanding of the natural environment and the consequences of human actions. Audiovisual materials, publications, exhibits, activities, and interpreters are examples of the mechanisms to be utilized in accomplishing this goal. In addition to the visitor center, information and exhibits would be provided at Mata de la Gata and Playita Rosada. 7 Under the proposed Interpretive Program several \"hands on\" learning exper- iences will also be provided. Self-guiding trails at Bahia Sucia/Salinas and a mangrove boardwalk tour at La Parguera are proposed. Discrete underwater sites in certain reef/mangrove areas will be evaluated for possible designation as snorkeling and dive trails. Another component of the proposal is a Resource Studies Plan. Implemen- tation would provide multidisciplinary studies on living marine resources (species composition, abundance, diversity, etc.); community structure and function; and physical, chemical, geological and meteorological conditions within the proposed sanctuary. Information generated from these investigations would be used to further understanding of the importance of marine resources and to develop sound marine ecosystem management practices. One of the priority resource studies would result in a compilation of literature of past and present research within the proposed sanctuary, and would tie this information into a retrievable data resource information system. Other studies would focus on circulation and water quality assessments, impacts of recreational use and monitoring of underwater trails. Research is also proposed that would analyze use impacts on the bioluminescent bays and grassbeds while another would result in recommendations to enhance the conch fishery. In addition, the resource studies plan includes a proposal to inventory and monitor endangered and threatened species. Parts IV and V discuss alternatives and the environmental consequences of the proposed sanctuary. The proposed sanctuary would promote resource protection in three ways. First, it would bolster the existing regulatory/ enforcement regime. Second, the alternative provides a program of resource interpretation directed at enhancing understanding of the basis for wise resource management and use. Third, the proposal would develop a data/information base from which sound management decisions are made. The proposal could also have economic impacts beneficial to residents. La Parguera is a \"weekend\" resort with most visitors arriving for short stays from Friday to Sunday. During the week and at certain times of the year, the several guest houses are not filled to capacity. An emphasis on resource oriented programs may increase the number of visitors to La Parguera. Economic benefits would also accrue to the fishermen. The information on water quality, circulation, habitat, and particularly the conch assessment study, would provide information on how and where fishery development projects could best be undertaken. In addition, protection of the various fishery habitats (mangroves, reefs, and grassbeds) should help maintain and enhance the long-term ability of the resources to sustain the local fishing industry. Overall, the environmental consequences of sanctuary designation would be positive, with both short and long-term benefits to residents, visitors and the natural environment. 8 PART II: MANAGEMENT CONTEXT A. Introduction This part of the management plan provides the background information on the area of the proposed sanctuary. Section B, Location and Boundaries, discusses the location and extent of the proposal, providing longitude and latitude coordinates. Section C, Natural Resources, presents those significant resource systems that contribute to making the La Parguera area important and valuable. Discussed are the general physical and biological characteristics of the area; habitats, such as coral reefs, mangroves, grassbeds; and endangered species. Section D looks at the social and economic aspects of La Parguera and discusses the local market economy, profiles visitors and users and presents information on commercial fishing activities. Section E, Legal/Institutional Background, provides information on the Commonwealth and Federal statutes and regulations that are relevant to management of the marine and nearshore resources. Finally, Section F discusses the issues and problems associated with the resources of the proposed La Parguera National Marine Sanctuary. This section focuses on issues that affect the quality and use of the marine resources, the problems of which are addressed in Part III, Management Measures. B. Location and Boundaries The proposed La Parguera National Marine Sanctuary lies off the southwest coast of Puerto Rico and extends east to west from the eastern boundary of the La Parguera Natural Reserve at Punta Sombrero to Punta Aguila on the southwest coast and seaward to the edge of the shelf at the 100 fathom mark. It extends landward to the area subject to the ebb and flow of the tide (Figure 3).

Regular flights from San Juan connect Puerto Rico to the major U.S. cities (New York 1,399 m., 2,251 km. - Miami 932 m., 1,500 km.). From San Juan, sanctuary access is available by car along one of Puerto Rico's major highways (Route 52) or by plane to Mayaguez or Ponce. The proposed sanctuary is within easy driving distance from these population centers, (Mayaguez 22 miles away, Ponce 30 miles away) as well as the closer villages of Puerto Real, Boqueron, and El Combate in Cabo Rojo and Ensenada, Guanica, and Playa Santa in Guanica. C. Natural Resources 1. Introduction The proposed La Parguera National Marine Sanctuary (LPNMS) is a repre- sentative cross-section of the tropical marine and coastal ecosystem. Most of the area is situated on a shelf of limestone lying beneath 15 to 18 m of warm water. This shelf juts out into the Caribbean from the coast some 8 to 10 km (6 miles) and ends suddenly as a spectacular submerged barrier reef along much of its edge. From this shelf rise two elongated major reef systems running from east to west, dividing the shelf into inner, middle, and outer regions. Highly favorable climatic and hydrographic conditions and rich dissolved organics from fringing mangroves have promoted the prolific growth of more than 23 individual coral reef systems (Figures 6 and 7). Numerous offshore mangrove cays are scattered throughout the shelf, primarily within the inner and middle areas. Some are associated with coral reefs in the outer region of the shelf. These cays, reefs, and mangrove lagoons are also associated with extensive seagrass beds, (Thalassia) distributed almost continuously from Punta Jorobado to Cabo Rojo, where they represent one of the largest turtle grass areas in Puerto Rico (Gonzalez-Liboy, 1979). Thick mangrove forests line the shore of the proposed sanctuary at Bahia Montalva and Bahia Fosforescente; they extend from the La Parguera village area westward almost continuously to Punta Pitahaya. Between Punta Pitahaya and Punta Molino there is a break in the mangrove development. The mangrove forest then continues along Bahia Sucia except where it is broken by a barrier beach. Parts of eastern Bahia Salinas are also fringed with mangroves. There are a few beaches interspersed with rocky outcroppings along the shore, but access to the water is generally limited by the great stretches of mangroves along the coast. Beaches of sand or gravel characterize much of the shoreline of Bahia Sucia and Bahia Salinas. La Parguera's bioluminescent bays continue to draw scientific researchers and tourists from all over the world. Bioluminescence in coastal bays is rare throughout the world. However, light-emitting plankton are found in very high concentrations in Bahia Fosforescente and to a lesser degree in Bahia Monsio Jose located to the east and west of the La Parguera village, respectively. Within these shallow bays, a brilliant display of bioluminescence is created nightly by the churning of the bay waters by boats or by schools of fish. Such activity stimulates the dinoflagellates (Pyrodinium bahamense) which actually produce the light. 11 0 C E A N 0 A T L A N T I C 0 Santuario Marino Nacional La Parguera National BAHAMAS Marine Sanctuary Figure 4 Contexto CUBA DOMINICAN Regional A EP UBLIC Regional context PUE14TO RICO ST.

The information in the following section on sanctuary resources and the potential impacts from visitor and resident uses provides the basis for resource management measures presented in Part III. 2. Physical Characteristics a. Geology Low-lying hills consisting of southward dipping limestones from the Cretaceous period line the coastal area of southwestern Puerto Rico (Almy, 1965). Northwest of these hills is an area underlined by serpentinized periodotite of early to early late Cretaceous age (Saunders, 1973). The coastal lowland of and near La Parguera is covered by Quaternary alluv,ial sand and silt and by tidal swamp deposits of silt and clay (Kaye, 1959). From Punta Pitahaya to Bahia Sucia the coastline features cliffs with developed limestone outcrops composed of tertiary rocks, mostly limestone. Some are volcanic in origin. Located at the very southwest tip of Puerto Rico is Cabo Rojo. Consisting of two separate limestone knobs tied to the mainland by a forked double tombolo, Cabo Rojo has a beach which encircles a small, triangular lagoon. The general marine geology of La Parguera and adjacent areas is discussed in the coral reef section of this chapter. b. Climate The proposed LPNMS falls within the Subtropical Dry Life Zone (Ewel and Whitmore, 1973) receiving 500-1,200 mm (20-48 inches) of rain annually. Wet and dry seasons are not clearly defined. The period of maximum precipitation is usually from May through November, with periods of torrential rainfall during September through October. Most of this rain falls during a period of several weeks and only for short durations (Guinones, 1953). During this period dense flows of mud washed from the soil cover are seen diffusing offshore and are densest adjacent to tidal flats (Saunders, 1973). Runoff is the only local source of terrigenous sediments within the proposed sanctuary since no rivers are present. As a result of low rainfall, salinity fluctuations in coastal areas are slight. This condition is particularly favorable to the development of tropical marine communities, especially coral reefs, which are built mainly by fairly stenohaline organisms restricted by salinity levels. Good water clarity also contributes to the success of these marine communities. Although Puerto Rico is influenced by a maritime climate and is exposed to the easterly trade winds throughout the year, regular seasonal variations in temperature are clearly evident. The greatest seasonal difference observed by Glynn (1973), during a seven year period was 420F. The average annual temperature is 770F. The driest time of the year extends from about December through April with occasional, infrequent, substantial precipitation as cold fronts move in from the north (Smedley, 1961). Potential evaportranspiration is in the order of 1,900 - 2,200 mm annually, giving the region a yearly water deficit. 16 Extreme maximum temperatures normally occur in the late summer (August- September) and extreme minimums in the winter (December-March). This thermal regime is consistent for regions exposed to the easterly trades of the Atlantic Ocean which interact to produce \"oceanic\" type temperature curves with late summer maxima and later winter minima (Riehl, 1954 as cited by Glynn, 1973). Estimated diurnal range is in excess of 20'F (Calvesbert, 1970). The location of Puerto Rico relative to the high pressure belt (\"subtropical highs\") over the eastern Atlantic Ocean places it well within the influence of the steady trade winds throughout the year, with a fairly regular annual pattern (Glynn, 1973). In La Parguera, winds from the southeast and east prevail 81.1% of the time, with combined velocities from 1U to 25 km/hr (6-15 miles/hr). Weaker winds from the north or northeast with velocities not exceeding 10 km/hr (6 miles/hr) prevail only 12.1% of the time. Winds from the south, southwest, west and northwest are relatively unimportant (Glynn, 1973). Periods of calm occur most often in October and November. There is an important land-sea breeze effect with winds shifting from the east or southeast after 7:00 or 8:00 a.m. During cyclonic disturbances in the summer or fall, exceptionally low temperatures (61.7'F), torrential rains (about 203 mm in a 12-hour period (i.e., Hurricane Edith, 1963), and very strong winds (close to 80 km/hr--5U knots) can be experienced. These tropical storms and hurricanes are perhaps the most obvious physical factors affecting the survival and geomorphology of shallow marine communities, particularly emergent coral reefs. Documentation of more recent hurricane damage to marine communities within the proposed LPNMS have been made by Glynn et al. (1964), Glynn (1973), Cintron (personal communication), Goenaga (1981), Armstrong (personal communication) and Matta (1981). c. Hydrography Seasonal variation in mean sea water temperature follows closely that of the atmosphere, ranging between 770 and 860F, and reaching a maximum in August- October and a minimum in February. Annual variations in surface water temperature are generally less than 4.50F (Coker and Gonzalez, 1980). Increased winds in the spring appear to be related to a slight decline in the surface thermal structure (Glynn, 1973). Salinity values normally vary less than 2.3 parts per thousand (ppt) in this region. Salinity data collected by Jorge Rivera on the western side of Magueyes Island (La Parguera) indicate a maximum of 36.9 ppt and a minimum of 34.6 ppt between June 1971 and November 1972. These salinity values are similar to offshore values indicating that circulation of the inner shelf region is adequate to maintain open sea salinity conditions (Saunders, 1973). Tropical storms in the region usually lower salinities considerably, thereby temporarily stressing marine communities. Runoff from heavy rainfall, resuspension of bottom sediments by wave action and plankton blooms occasionally create turbid conditions. Water clarity within the proposed sanctuary, however, is generally good and varies only from about one meter (3.3 feet) near the shore to about 30 meters (100 feet) at the edge of the shelf. 17 Tides can be characterized, as summarized by Coker and Gonzalez (1980), and confirmed by Glynn (1973): 1) slight vertical range (daily maximum of 40 cm or 16 inches and yearly maximum of 55 cm or 22 inches); 2) largely diurnal and irregular; 3) relatively abrupt seasonal shift in timing; and 4) higher mean elevation of sea level in late summer and fall. Since tides have a reduced vertical range, their influence on the flushing rate is also small (Cintron, 1969). This slow and reduced water transport probably contributes to the high water transparency of coastal waters, promoting the development of marine communities. On the other hand, entrapment of pollutants near the coast due to reduced tidal action can cause pollution of coastal waters. The general water circulation pattern is westward, parallel to the coast and appears to be mainly wind-driven. Preliminary measurements of surface current velocities by Glynn (1973) near Laurel Reef (see coral reef section below) indicated that water movement over the shelf is considerably less than in the open sea (4.5 meters/min. vs. 25 meters/min. or 14.8 ft./min. vs. 82 ft./min.). d. Sand Fields The southwestern Puerto Rico shelf, including the offshore areas of the proposed LPNMS, may be an important site for offshore commercial quality sand resources (USGS, 1978). Seaward of Bahia Sucia and occupying most of the middle shelf is a Halimeda-mollusk gravelly sand with no observed terrigenous components. Much of the area of this sediment type is covered by a field of large sand waves, with an average wave length of 350 m and heights ranging from 2-3 m. The length of the waves is on the order of 2,500 m. The crests of some of the waves have been partially colonized by Thalassia and other organisms. The presence of this sand wave field suggests that large volumes of sand with mining potential are locally present in the area considered for sanctuary designation (Figure 6). As a result of the apparent developing need for offshore sand for construction aggregate for Puerto Rico, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the Department of Natural Resources of the Commonwealth (DNR) began investigations of potential offshore sand deposits on the Puerto Rican insular shelf in 1974. Three major sand bodies were located on the insular shelf. As might be expected in an area of westward-directed winds and water currents, all three sand areas are located at the western end of the islands. The Isabela area is found at the western end of the northern coast of Puerto Rico; the southwestern area is located near the west end of the south coast of Puerto Rico in the vicinity of Bahia Sucia and Cabo Rojo (but outside the area of the proposed sanctuary); and the Escollo de Arenas area is located north of the western end of Vieques Island. The area of greatest commercial potential in the southwest lies directly south of Cabo Rojo point. 18 3. Habitats and Biological Characteristics a. Coral Reefs Two hypotheses have been postulated to explain the origin of La Parguera reefs. The first one states that the major geological features of La Parguera have resulted from the deformation of upper Cretaceous limestones (with interbedded mudstones and volcanic rocks), forming a west-northwest/east-southeast trending syncline whose axis passes through Magueyes Island (Almy, 1969). The northern limb of the syncline is represented by the La Parguera hills and, possibly, the southern limb by the coral reefs on the shelf. The second hypothesis (Kaye, 1959) claims that these reefs have developed on drowned, limestone cuestas formed as eolianite structures parallel to the shore during the Wisconsin Glacial period. The following sections describe zonation patterns of representative reefs within the inner, middle, and outer shelves. Although these patterns are often the same, these zonation schemes can sometimes be highly variable within a reef (Goenaga, 1981, Morelock, 1977, 1979). The twenty-three identified reefs of La Parguera are listed in Table I and Figures 9 and 10 show the location of the reefs.1 (1) Inner Shelf Area The inner shelf, bordered on the south by La Gata Reef, Enrique Reef, and others, is characterized by fine grained, poorly sorted sediments. This material comes mainly from in situ bioerosion (Morelock et al., 1977) in the back reef aprons. Scatter6d-throughout this protected area are cays in various stages of successional development. These cays, with the staghorn coral (Acropora cervicornis) dominating their shallower zones, pass through a series of stages eventuilly becoming mangrove cays (Welch, 1962). Formation of these cays is dependent on the upward growth of Porites hillocks (the Porites biotope). The windward crest 1 The area shown in (Figure 6), Natural Factors of La Parguera, has been subdivided into three area maps to provide more detail on each area. The easternmost area, Area I, (Figure 8) features the ecological system of Bahia Montalva and Bahia Fosforescente. The central portion, Area II, (Figure 9) contains the recreational center of La Parguera village, the two DNR parks of Playita Rosada and Mata de La Gata, the mangrove forest of the Boqueron State Forest and the majority of the coral reefs. Area III, (Figure 10), the westernmost portion of the proposed LPNMS, features Bahia Sucia and Bahia Salinas with the Cabo Rojo tombolo separating the two. 19 TABLE I CURAL REEFS WITHIN THE PROPOSED LA PARGUERA NATIONAL MARINE SANCTUARY REEFS LATITUDE LONGITUDE 1.

Reduced circulation impedes leeward coral growth, leading to conditions favorable for the proliferation of seagrasses and calcareous algae. Later, the sediment builds up due to the sediment-accumulating property of seagrasses and encourages the colonization of the red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle). Finally, the subtidal flora adjacent to the mangrove dies because of overshading by tree cover. The Porites biotope (referred to in the previous paragraph) is a major, although probably transient community of these as well as of the outer shelf reefs. On these reefs extensive beds of Porites colonies are formed leeward from the reef crest. Occasionally, they occur on other protected parts of the reef. These beds sometimes cover several square meters (Glynn, 1973; Goenaga, personal communication) containing a high diversity, biomass and population density of associated biota. This biota includes a wide variety of benthic algae, foraminifers, crustaceans, molluscs, echinoderms, sipunculids, anthozoans, and sponges. The inner shelf reefs are also generally characterized by a restricted coral fauna, a poorly developed elkhorn coral (Acropora palmata) zone, and the absence of a Millepora dominated reef crest. Zonation patterns are, generally, not very conspicuous and the reef base is usually about ten meters deep. These reefs, because of their protected location, are less affected by hurricahe-generated waves and may play an important role in providing coral larvae supply to outer reefs, where shallow coral zones are left devoid of coral damaged by tropical storms. (See Appendix A for a detailed description of some of the coral reefs found in this area.) (2) Middle and Outer Shelf Areas The fore reef of Enrique Reef as well as that of Mario, La Gata and Caracoles Reefs belong to the middle shelf area with moderate exposure to the incoming waves. The outer area is limited to the north by Laurel, Media Luna, and others. These reefs receive high wave energy and generally present a marked zonation in the fore reef. The palmata zone is usually-very extensive. During storms of moderate to high intensity, however, this zone is wiped out completely, depositing broken colonies on the reef crest and forming flat promontories close to three meters in relief (Glynn et al., Goenaga, 1981). It should be noted that even though storm damage is quite extensive, the areas principally affected are those which contain the fastest growing corals. Thus, the regeneration period is, in the absence of additional stresses (natural or man-made), fairly short (15-25 years). Apparently, due to the high energy to which these reefs are exposed, deposition of fine sediments is not sufficient to support the establishment of the red mangrove, (Cintron et al., 1978). The white mangrove, Laguncularia racemosa, however, has settled on these substrates. (See Appendix A for a -je-tailed description of some of the coral reefs found in this area.) 24 b. Mangroves Mangrove forest development and structure within the proposed sanctuary appear to be related to exposure to wave energy (Cintron et al., 1978). Conditions affecting exposure include: (a) orientation in relation to incoming waves, (b) protection afforded by outer reefs, (c) distance from the border of the insular shelf, and (d) as in the case of Bahia Salinas, protection from the prevailing winds and currents by the Cabo Rojo sand tombolo. Conditions of minimum exposure to wave energy (as in the near shore areas of Punta Pitahaya and in the core of large mangrove inlets) are apparently associated with a high accumulation of salts and toxic compounds (e.g., ammonia) derived from the anaerobic metabolism of soil biota due to low water flushing rates. Conditions of maximum exposure are associated either with the absence of mangroves due to the impossibility of seed implanting (as west of Punta Molino and northern Bahia Sucia) or with the formation of berms on the outer fringes which reduces circulation of the water to the interior, eventually killing the trees (as in the lagoon area of eastern Bahia Sucia). Intermediate exposure appears to be optimum for mangrove development (as in Caballo Blanco and Enrique Cay). Of the five mangrove forest types described by Lugo and Snedaker (1974), all but the river type are found within the region. These are (a) the fringe forest which predominates, (b) the overwash forest., (c) the basin forest, and (d) the dwarf forest. Location of the major stands of mangroves is found on (Figures 8, 9 and 10). Figure 11, Mangrove Profile, provides an illustration of a cross-section of a typical mangrove area. (1) Fringing As in most of the southwest coast, fringing mangroves grow at the edge of the water and exhibit low structural complexity, low leaf fall, and low rate of growth. They are dominated by the red mangrove, Rhizophora mangle, (Cintron et al., 1978). These mangroves are in continuous contact with'sea water. Associated with the submerged prop roots characteristic of the red mangrove is a rich community containing a wide assortment of organisms. Competition for space on these roots is high. Invertebrates present include crustaceans, molluscs, bryozoans, sponges, echinoderms, polychaetes, and coelenterates. Vertebrates include fish and a wide variety of tunicates. Algae from different taxonomic groups are also very abundant. Emergent segments of the prop roots, as well as the stems of other mangrove species, are also used as substrate for invertebrates, especially crustaceans and molluscs. Associated with these diverse root and stem communities is a rich variety of abundant wildlife, especially birds. 25 Santuario Marino Nacional -.J La Parguera National Marine Sanctuary Figure 11 Perfil Tfpico de mangle rolo red mangrove Manglar mangle negro black mangrove Typical mangle blanco Mangrove white mangrove Profile Tipos de Mangle Canal del Manglar N) Types of Mangrove Mangrove Channel -h If ......... . ....... ....... ........... ......... .... ... . ... v, .. . ... . ... . ... . ...; . . . ............. . ..... ........... 010-1. @Owrll ..:. mar mangle rojo mangle negro mangle blanco mangle negro mangle rolo, canal del manglar mangle rojo sea red mangrove black mangrove white mangrove black mangrove red mangrove mangrove channel red mangrove Evelyn S. Wilcox and Associates McLean, Virginia Fringing, as well as other types of mangroves, also serve as nurseries for many species of fish which migrate to adjacent coral reefs or seagrass beds during their life cycle. Dissolved and particulate organic material and other nutrients are also exported to these adjacent subtidal communities. Because of their location and the land-sea interface, red mangroves play an important role in protecting coastal land. Mangrove stands act as buffers absorbing the force of wave energy, therefore attenuating and preventing coastal erosion. (2) Overwash Offshore, overwash mangrove forests develop over shallow platforms or islets (cays) within the inner shelf. These are overtopped daily or less frequently by high tides and extend laterally. With extensive prop root development, water circulation eventually is reduced within the inner zones. The inner red mangrove trees die due to salt accumulations from reduced water circulation (this species is not very tolerant to high salinities) and are replaced by stunted black mangroves (Avicennia germinous), a species more tolerant of high salinities. Finally, sa inity increases beyond the threshold tolerance of the black mangroves which die at the core of the islet. A hypersaline lagoon is then formed. This process may be set back by natural or human induced forces such as hurricanes or mangrove cutting, respectively (Cintron et al., 1978). All stages of this process are represented within the proposed sanctuary. These overwash mangroves also have associated prop root communities and commonly serve as bird rookeries within the area. In La Parguera these islets are critical to large numbers of herons, the endangered brown pelicans, and terns. The only nests of the endangered yellow-shouldered blackbird safe from parasitization by cowbirds are found on these small cays. (3) Basin Even though basin mangrove forests are much better developed off the north coast of Puerto Rico, they do appear in La Parguera in close association with the fringing forests (i.e.,*Pitahaya). These forests are normally separated from direct contact with sea water except during very high tides or during stormy weather. The dominant species is the more tolerant black mangrove and to a lesser degree, the white mangrove, Laguncularia racemosa. Sometimes the buttonwood, Conocarpus erectus, is found ithin the innermost reaches of the forest. Various species of decapod crabs are usually associated with either the soils or the tree stems of these forests, for example, the fiddler crabs of the genus Uca, the colorful Gomiopsis cruenata, and others. Many birds also use these habitats. 27 (4) Dwarf Even though dwarf mangrove forests within the proposed sanctuary have not been reported in the literature, low stature trees have been observed. Although it is not known whether these are true, nutrient-limited dwarf trees or trees stunted due to high soil salinities, favorable conditions exist for the development of these dwarf types (Cintron, 1982, personal communication). c. Salt Water Flats and Lagoons Hypersaline lagoons and salt flats occur inland from the mangrove forests. They are formed as a result of reduced inland runoff, higher evaporation rates, and reduced rainfall (Martinez et al., 1979). Dead black mangrove trees are often seen within these lagoons. d. Seagrass Beds The general climatic and oceanographic characteristics of the region as well as the low incident of waves and the protection afforded by the above mentioned cays and reefs, all tend to promote high seagrass development (Gonzalez-Liboy, 1979), (Figures 6, 8, 9, and 10). Depth, irradiance, atmospheric exposure and wave action appear to be the most important factors affecting the distribution of these beds within the region. Just west of Punta Pitahaya, the protection afforded by outer reefs especially Margarita, ends more or less abruptly, thus exposing the inshore grass beds. As a consequence, grass-free depressions or blowouts are formed probably due to storm generated waves (Gonzalez-Liboy, 1979). Coincidentally, mangroves are not present within the shoreline segment (from Pitahaya to Punta Molino). Their development is also apparently precluded by this condition. Thalassia testudinum is the dominant seagrass in La Parguera followed by Sy-ringodium filiforme, Halo hilla sp. and Halodule wrightii. Turtle grass (Thalassia testudinum) beds in southwestern Puerto Rico are structurally well developed. Their net production is higher than in other beds in Puerto Rico, having high turnover values and being capable of producing 18 crops a year (Gonzalez-Liboy, 1979). Standing crop, biomass and Teaf length were found to be higher in deeper beds as opposed to shallower ones (Delgado, 1978). From the intertidal zone to depths of about 10 m, Thalassia beds are present. Large, well-developed meadows have generally been observed at depths of 2 m or less. These meadows occupy most of the shallow bottom just offshore the mangrove fringe. Off Isla Guayacan, for example, Thalassia and Syringodium grow close to the submerged mangrove roots. Dense growth of Thalassia has also been observed in semi-enclosed areas with good circulations and clear waters. Two examples are the meadows northeast of Magueyes Island and around Cueva Island. These areas are protected by mangrove islets and have an average depth of 2 m. The sea condition is usually calm allowing for good transparency. Water transparency measured 28 horizontally near the Cueva and Magueyes sites was 6.5 m. These conditions of clear waters appear to prevail throughout most of the year, except during periods of very heavy rainfall and runoff (October and November). The distribution of Thalassia near offshore reefs, islets, and mangrove islands with the sector is generally restricted to the lee (north) side of these formations. Exceptions to this are the meadows growing around mangrove islands within the inner shelf province. Protection offered by the rather large system of offshore reefs allows Thalassia to colonize both the leeward and windward sides of these islands; it commonTy occurs in association with coral species such as Millepora complanta and Octopora cervicornis. Thalassia is absent from the exposed reef fronts which continuously receives the impact of the incoming waves. However, on the innundated central portion of the reef flats Thalassia develops among the coral rubble. Thalassia is also present in the shallow lagoon side of the reefs where it occurs in a rather variable band just behind the reef flat. Seagrass beds within the area display a high diversity of inches which allow for a wide variety of organisms, some of which, like the queen conch, are of high local commercial importance. Other associated organisms include other mollusks, coelenterates (including isolated corals), echinoderms, sponges, fish, sea turtles, and manatees. Algae of different groups are also abundant and diverse (Glynn, 1964; Matthews, 1967). Many species of reef fish are entirely dependent on seagrass beds for nutrition and migrate daily for feeding purposes. The endangered hawksbill sea turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata) have been sighted in the seagrass beds within the proposed sanctuary. The seagrass beds between Bahia Sucia and Punta Pitahaya are exceptionally well-developed and extend from the shoreline to depths of 10-11 m. They become less dense as depth increases and occupy a great deal of the inner shelf bottom. Thalassia is the dominant seagrass, although Syringodium is also very common. Samples of dead seagrass leaves piled up at the beach at Bahia Sucia after a tropical storm consisted of 52% (dry weight) Thalassia and 45% Syringodium. e. Beaches Shoreline beaches are present from east to west, at Caleta Salina, Salinas Salineta, Punta Montalva, east of the entrace to Bahia Fosforescente, Papayo, Playita Rosada, west of Punta Pitahaya, Bahia Sucia, Los Morrillos (Cabo Rojo Point), and northern and northeastern Bahia Salinas. It is reported that sea turtles still nest on the beaches of Bahia Sucia and Bahia Salinas (DNR Rangers, personal communication, 1982). f. Rocky Shores Rocky shores, usually found in exposed areas with strong wave action, are located from east to west in southern Isla Matei, eastern Bahia Fosforescente, Isla Guayacan, near Isla de Cuevas, Punta Molino and the eastern, western and southern parts of the sand tombolo at Cabo Rojo. 29 Oc -PaU9JPaJqJ.

Three species endangered worldwide and protected under the U.S. Endangered Species Act, the West Indian Manatee (Trichechus manatus), the hawksbill sea turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata), and the bro.wn pelican (Pelecanus occidentalis) f-r-equent the p-roposed LPNMS (Figures 8, 9, and IU). a. West Indian Manatee The West Indian Manatee or sea cow, Trichechus manatus, is one of only four living species belonging to the unique group of aquatic herbivores, the mammalian Order Sirenia. It is a massive, fusiform, thick-skinned, nearly hairless animal with paddle-like forelimbs, no hindlimbs, and a spatulate, horizontally flattened tail. Most adult manatees are 9 to 11 1/2 feet (2.8 to 3.5 meters) in length. Manatees are usually slow moving, but are able to swim swiftly for short distances (Brownell, 1980). This species historically was found in shallow coastal waters, bays, lagoons, estuaries, rivers, and inland lakes throughout much of the tropical and subtropical regions of the New World Atlantic, including many of the Caribbean islands. However, at the present time, manatees are now rare or extinct in most parts of their former range (Brownell, 1980). During the latter half of the 1800's manatees were fairly common around Puerto Rico., although estimates of numbers are not available. They are now less common. The decrease in numbers is attributed to silting of rivers and hunting pressure. Recent surveys indicate a total Puerto Rico population of less than 100 animals. Small groups are frequently sighted on the south coast, and around the mouth of the Fajardo River on the east coast. Current population trends are unclear. A small number of manatees are still taken each year in fishing nets (Brownell, 1980). b. Hawksbill Sea Turtle Hawksbill sea turtles (Eretmochelys imbricata) are known to frequent the waters of the proposed sanctuary. This species is usually found in shallower water, usually in depths of less than 50 feet. The hawksbills seem to prefer cleaner beaches and more oceanic exposure. Even though the hawksbill wanders a great deal, it seems more attached to one region than other sea turtles (Rebel, 1974). The mangroves and adjacent seagrass beds provide ideal foraging grounds for these animals. Rangers have seen signs of turtle nesting on the beaches of Bahia Sucia and Bahia Salinas. Although the turtles are endangered and protected under the Endangered Species Act, poaching still occurs. C. Brown Pelicans The brown pelican (Pelecanus occidentalis) of the Caribbean is a sea bird that does not venture far from re. It feeds on fish which it sights from the air and then seizes in plunging dives (Welty, 1975). Historically, brown pelicans nested on Enrique Cay and Turromote Cay in La Parguera. At the present time, however, in the La Parguera area pelicans are nesting only on cays in Montalva Bay, where they represent the largest breeding colony in Puerto Rico. 31 B. Social and Economic Factors 1. Regional Characteristics The proposed LPNMS falls within the San German labor market area (Cabo Rojo, Lajas, Subana Grande, and San German municipalities) of the southwest economic sector. The La Parguera region is located between the major population center of Mayaguez and Ponce on the west and south coasts,respectively. Mayaguez, a seaport, is the sixth largest city in Puerto Rico, with a 1980 population of 96,193. The economy of the city centers largely on shipping, commercial fishing, light industry, and the University of Puerto Rico. San German is ten miles from Mayaguez and the site of the main campus of the Interamerican University. Ponce, the third largest metropolitan area and seaport in Puerto Rico, had a population of 189,046 in 1980. The San German labor area municipalities in 1980 contained a population of 108,410, or three percent of the population of Puerto Rico (3.2 million). The unemployment level of San German is estimated at 12.6 percent of the work force or 39,000, placing the area in the category of \"persistent unemployment.\" The island-wide rate of unemployment is substantially higher, estimated at 22 percent. Agricultural activity is minor. Government and industry comprise the principal fields of employment. The municipality of Lajas, of which the barrio of La Parguera is a part, is among the least populated areas of the San German market area. Its economic activity is mostly influenced by its proximity to subregional commercial, service, and governmental activities. 2. Local Characteristics The population of the La Parguera region is primarily in the village of La Parguera. It has evolved from a small fishing village to a popular recreational area for Puerto Ricans. The barrio (ward) and village of La Parguera, the population center of the region, are practically one and the same. The most recent population count for the barrio was 1,678, of which the village contained 1,278. Reliable social and economic data for the village of La Parguera are limited. The permanent population of the village is reported to have increased from about 1,000 in 1960 to 1,700 in 1980. Housing units apparently increased more dramatically, from about 250 units in 1968 to a reported 680 units in 1980. It is possible that, based on the reportedly small residential population and the range of labor market opportunities (i.e., recreational infrastructure, commercial fishing, marine research), the work force in La Parguera is presently being supplemented by workers living outside, but within commuting distance of the village. 32 3. Users a . Vi sitors The fishing village of La Parguera is a center for recreational boating and fishing, snorkeling, SCUBA diving, and sightseeing on the southwest coast (Figure 12, Existing Recreational Use). During the day, charter boats take visitors to Mata de la Gata, a small park with picnicking and swimming facilities on an offshore islet owned and managed by the Commonwealth Department of Natural Resources. Other boat trips take visitors to explore the many reefs offshore. Day trips are available to some of the larger cays. A glass bottom boat, averaging 22 passengers per trip, is also available at the town docks to view submerged reefs and fish. Snorkeling, SCUBA equipment, and boats may be rented at one facility along the waterfront. Visitors coming to La Parguera from nearby population centers such as Ponce, Mayaguez, Lajas, and San German, and international visitors are particularly attracted to La Parguera's most distinctive feature, Bahia Fosforescente. At night, the two boat companies in La Parguera take visitors to the bay, making as many as four or five trips per night. There are apparently no boat charters for sportfishing at the present time (Pepe, personal communication, 1981). Although data on visitors to La Parguera are limited, tourism appears to be increasing. There are, of course, the \"permanent\" visitors: owners and guests occupying vacation or second homes, which presumably account for the spurt in housing units between 1968 and 1980. The interest in recreational fishing, boating, and diving throughout La Parguera waters, as well as the attraction of Bahia Fosforescente to island-wide and overseas visitors is demonstrated by the existence, in La Parguera, of two hotels and nine quest houses (241 rooms), four cafeterias, and seven restaurants. This variety of attractions, including the DNR recreational facilities at Isla Mata de La Gata, and Playita Rosada (a public beach), the marine sciences laboratory of the University of Puerto Rico situated on Isla Magueyes, directly across the channel from the town, and the outstanding natural scenic beauty of the coastal area is apparently resulting now in an annual tourist visitation rate of more than 35,000 (DNR Mayaguez Office Statistics, 1981). The majority of these visitors, according to residents, are Puerto Rican, who probably come from the urban centers of Ponce, 57 km (30 miles) and Mayaguez, 35 km (22 miles) away. It appears that most \"international\" or mainland tourists, thus far, prefer the gaming tables and crashing surf of the northern \"Gold Coast\" to the more natural attractions offered by La Parguera. b. Education and Research Although the Marine Sciences Program of the University of Puerto Rico is based in Mayaguez, most of the teaching pd research is carried out on an 18-acre island (Magueyes) directly offshore La Parguera village. The Department of Marine Sciences offers both a Master of Science and Doctor of Philosophy degrees. 33 Santuarlo Marino Nacional La Parguera National 44, Marine Sanctuary :'d- Figur e 12 . .... ..... p USO:.

Wilcox Ow6mmm\"Oftwelmmummumemage-Owwwwommumme - ----- 0 and Associates McLean, Virginia --eee: N The Magueyes Island Field Station is operated for the purposes of education and research in the marine sciences (biological, geological, physical, and chemical oceanography). A wide variety of shal low water tropical marine habitats are found within a short distance of the station and the facilities and equipment needed for their study are largely available on the island. There are various small boats available for use in protected inshore waters. For offshore work including deep-ocean capabilities, the R/V Medusae (60 feet), a converted shrimp trawler, the R/V Pezmar (50 feet), and the R/V Crawford (125 feet) are available for students and for charter. In addition to marine science graduate students, outside visitors, study groups and scientists make use of the facilities for nominal fees. Guided tours are provided, free of charge, for school groups and other interested organizations. Snorkeling and SCUBA diving from university boats are permitted for visitors. A small three room dormitory with bunk beds is available on Magueyes Island along with modest kitchen facilities. Individuals or small groups use this dormitory, while larger groups usually stay at the Hotel Villa Parguera in the village. C. Commercial Fishing The fishing population in the La Parguera area, organized in five fishermens' associations from Guanica to Boqueron, were contacted by Evelyn S. Wilcox and Associates in order to interview \"key informants.\" The president of each association and several of the most active members were interviewed in order to: � obtain their views on the possible impact of the marine sanctuary program on their activities; � obtain updated information on fishing activities in the area in order to compare with available statistics; and � determine fishermen's needs and concerns. Data collected are presented throughout this section. For more detailed information and a list of associations and persons contacted see Appendix B. The National Marine Sanctuary Program was viewed positively by most of the fishermen. They were concerned, however, that the sanctuary regulations may limit their fishing activities. These concerns are particularly relevant since the three areas visited, Parguera, Boqueron and Guanica, are experiencing difficult economic situations reflected in current high unemployment rates. Full-time fishermen interviewed reported working in other types of activities to supplement their incomes. 35 (1) Income The following fisheries data for these municipalities listed below in Table 2 were taken from Ruiz, Blanca and Edmee Doble, Perfil de los Familias Pobres de Puerto Rico por Area Geografica, 1980, (Serviclos Legales de Puerto Rico, October 1981). Table 2. Annual Income Municipall Y- % Fishermen Below Poverty Level* Median Family Income Lajas 59 $5,010 Cabo Rojo 60 4,889 Guanica 62 4,807 *Poverty level was estimated at $4,000 annual income for a family of five. Recent factory closings in Guanica are not reflected in this data, so the present situation could be significantly worse. Recently the sugar mill and two other industries closed operations. Only Ochoa Fertilizers, an industry with very few workers, is still operating. Fostering recreational uses in the La Parguera area could become a means of revitalizing the local economy and providing additional income to the fishermen. (2) Productivity In 1974, the waters of Puerto Rico were reported by Brody and Slocum in 1974 to be \"very nearly overfished at present,\" and the shelf was \"heavily exploited\" according to Kawaguchi (1974). Observations made of fresh catch at La Parguera, Boqueron, and Guanica during the interviews seemed to confirm the above statement. The size of most specimens was small and weight per pot averaged from 5 to 8 pounds. A review of statistics available at the associations visited was consistent with these observations. Fishermen advised that the average catch per pot was around 8 pounds with 25 pounds as the upper limit when fishing conditions are ideal. Based on the information obtained in more than 30 island fishing centers over the past few years, fish pot commercial catch per unit of effort has been very close to five pounds per lift per pot (Juhl, 1976). The greatest concentration of fish pots was reported on the west coast of the Island. The town of Cabo Rojo is the fishing center having the largest number of fish pots and showing the highest production. 36 (3) Fishing Sites La Parguera village fishermen go as far as 3 to 9 miles offshore to fish at the shelf's edge. Each fisherman sets 20 to 30 pots and lifts them twice a week. When they don't lift pots, they fish with a troll line or by diving. Fishermen come from Guanica and Boqueron to fish almost everyday. Boqueron fishermen go daily as far as 4 miles from shore. They also were reported fishing in Mayaguez and occasionally in Guanica. Guanica fishermen stated that they had from 4 to IOU pots per fisherman, with the average in the 2U to 30 range. They fish mostly off Guanica, but also off Lajas and Guayanilla. Playa Santa (Guanica municipality) fishermen go out every day and sell their catch daily at the fishermen's association facilities. This was the only fishermen's association that is active and doing well out of the five interviewed. They fish from the El Faro area in Guanica to Bahia Montalva and Cana Gorda most frequently. They also fish in the Lajas area. They go 2 to 3 miles offshore in the eastern area and 1 to 1 1/2 miles in the western area following the shelf edge. All the fishermen interviewed considered the area from Guanica to Boqueron as one unit. They all know each other and have no problems among themselves with fishing in different areas. (4) Product Marketing Fishermen sell their catch through a variety of market channels, but primarily through wholesalers or fishermens' marketing associations. No published statistics are available on the number of dealers handling the catch. It is estimated that 90 percent of the locally caught fish are currently sold through these wholesale channels. A 1965 study (Arnion Torres, 1965) reported that 80 percent of the fish landed in Puerto Rico were handled by wholesalers. Fish sold are classified into three quality classes: Class 1: groupers, snappers, kingfish, cero, mullet, and hogfish Class 2: blue runners, wahoo, smaller groupers, and snappers Class 3: parrot fishes, squirrel fishes, and trash fishes Lobster, octopus, conch and large snappers are classified apart and get the highest prices. Table 3 shows data collected from five fishermen's associations. 37 Table 3.

Lajas' role in the commercial fisheries industry of Puerto Rico is important in the consideration of La Parguera as a proposed national marine sanctuary. As noted in the Economic Profile of Commercial Fishing (Appendix C), although Lajas contributed only 3.2 percent of the volume and value of overall Puerto Rico landings, its contribution to the south coast of Puerto Rico appears to be substantial in quantity and value; 21 and 12 percent, respectively, in 1978. The barrio of La'Parguera and the village, as the important \"port of entry,\" consequently play a significant part in the subregional fisheries economy. \"I The proposed LPNMS is most frequently utilized by fishermen from Lajas and Guanica municipalities. According to CODREMAR statistics, the value of landings and number of fishermen and boats have increased since 1970. However, if inflation is considered, there was no real increase in the fisherman's income (Gonzalez-Liboy, personal communication, 1982). Gross earnings per fisherman in Guanica increased from $1,405 in 1970 to $3,258 during the 1977-78 period. In 197U, Lajas fishermen's income averaged $2,027.which increased to $3,044 during the 1977-78 period. d. Sportfishing There is no site-specific information available on recreational sportfishing and boating in La Parguera or island-wide. Recreational sportfishing and boating are significant economic activities in Puerto Rico. An estimated average daily value of a day of recreational activity is $47.90 with a range from $32.57 for cruising to $55.79 for line fishing. Approximately 8,200 boats island-wide are currently registered for recreational use. Approximately 15 percent (or 1,250) of the recreational boats leave from points likely to be associated with the proposed sanctuary site (Cato, Prochaska, 1981). Club Nautico of La Parguera, a private club, accommodates approximately 50 power boats. 38 E. Legal/Institutional Background 1. Introduction The proposed La Parguera National Marine Sanctuary is almost entirely situated in Commonwealth waters, and their waters are controlled by a variety of Commonwealth and Federal statutes and regulations. Those laws and regulations that control activities both in the water and on the land which might impact the proposed sanctuary are identified and discussed below. In addition, several entities are already charged with implementing and enforcing these laws and regulations. This chapter provides an overview of those relevant laws and enforcement agents. 2. Commonwealth and Federal Laws Puerto Rico is a territory of the United States in which most, but not all, of the Articles of the U.S. Constitution apply. In its consideration of specific legislation, the Congress may include or exclude the territories. Statutory laws of the United States, not locally inapplicable, have the same force and effect in Puerto Rico as in the United States (48 U.S.C. �734). Laws that are locally inapplicable are determined by the courts (Cordova y Simonpietri v. Chase Manhattan Bank, 649 F.2d 36 (1981)). The Commonwealth, by Act of Congress, has jurisdiction and authority over the natural resources underlying submerged lands and waters as well as proprietary rights of ownership, management, and administration of fisheries three marine leagues or 10.35 miles from the coast (48 U.S.C. �749). Although there is no court decision interpreting 48 U.S.C. �749, it may be concluded, under general principles of law, that Puerto Rico has proprietary rights to both the submerged lands and navigable waters to three marine leagues from its coastline and, under old common law principle, Spanish law and modern statutes, to the fish and wildlife within its territorial waters (3 miles). A recent decision by the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) extends fisheries management authority in Puerto Rican waters, from 3 to 10.35 miles without expressly stating ownership or extent of territorial waters. a. Commonwealth Laws Puerto Rico has a strong public policy governing the protection of its environment and the conservation and protection of its natural resources. The Environmental Quality Board, the Planning Board, the Regulations and Permits Administration, and the Department of Natural Resources are the four agencies with primary responsibilities for planning and managing public actions and for regulating private sector activity in coastal areas. This section describes their organic laws, supplemental statues,@and regulations which affect the LPNMS. 39 (1) Environmental Quality Board (Law No. 9, June 18, 1970, as amended) The Environmental Quality Board (EQB) has the following powers and duties relevant to the proposed sanctuary: 0 permitting and licensing authority to regulate and control the pollution of air and water, solid waste and noise; 0 determination, through studies and sampling, of the degree of purity of the water and air and the establishment of corresponding standards in coordination with concerned agencies; 0 adoption of rules and regulations and prescribed orders, establishing adequate policies for the handling and disposal of solid waste; and 0 permitting and licensing for the installation and operation of solid waste and treatment plants. The EQB has initiated negotiations with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to assume responsibility for the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permitting program, but has not yet received such authority. There are no NPDES permits operating at the present time within the proposed marine sanctuary site. EQB has promulgated the following regulations: � Regulation for Water Quality Standards; � Regulation for Control of Atmospheric Pollution; and � Regulation for the Control of Solid Waste. The Regulation for Water Quality Standards employs classifications similar to those of EPA, including the following: Cl.ass SA - \"Coastal waters whose purity is necessary for the preservation of the existing [phenomena]. Toward that end, these waters are not intended to be used for any activity such as swimming, boating, skiing, etc. that might be detrimental to the existing natural phenomena.\" Class SB - \"Coastal waters intended for uses where the human body may c5'm--e in direct contact with the water ... and for use in propagation and maintenance of species.\" The waters of the bioluminescent bays in La Parguera are now classified SA (see Section II.F., Issues Associated with Water Quality and Population Growth, for more discussion). 40 (2) Planning Board (Law No. 75, June 24, 1975, as amended) The Planning Board (Board), initially created pursuant to the Planning and Budget Act (Law No. 213, May 12, 1942), was reorganized in accordance with its new Organic Law on July 1, 1975. The Board coordinates all government sector activity and guides private sector actions toward the integrated, balanced development of the Island's resources. The Organic Act provides for a variety of devices which, when adopted by tile Board and approved by the Governor, have the force of law. Those that directly affect the proposed LPNMS are the following: 0 Integral Development Plan, which sets forth policies and strategies for development. On January 26, 1976, the Board adopted a document entitled, \"Integral Development Plan: Public Policies and Specific Objectives;\" the Governor gave"
