        "text": "prepare_taxa_charts.py: A Python program to automate generation of publication ready taxonomic pie chart images from QIIME.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLakhujani, Vijay; Badapanda, Chandan\n\n2017-06-01\n\nQIIME (Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology) is one of the most popular open-source bioinformatics suite for performing metagenome, 16S rRNA amplicon and Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) data analysis. Although, it is very comprehensive and powerful tool, it lacks a method to provide publication ready taxonomic pie charts. The script plot_taxa_summary . py bundled with QIIME generate a html file and a folder containing taxonomic pie chart and legend as separate images. The images have randomly generated alphanumeric names. Therefore, it is difficult to associate the pie chart with the legend and the corresponding sample identifier. Even if the option to have the legend within the html file is selected while executing plot_taxa_summary . py , it is very tedious to crop a complete image (having both the pie chart and the legend) due to unequal image sizes. It requires a lot of time to manually prepare the pie charts for multiple samples for publication purpose. Moreover, there are chances of error while identifying the pie chart and legend pair due to random alphanumeric names of the images. To bypass all these bottlenecks and make this process efficient, we have developed a python based program, prepare_taxa_charts . py , to automate the renaming, cropping and merging of taxonomic pie chart and corresponding legend image into a single, good quality publication ready image. This program not only augments the functionality of plot_taxa_summary . py but is also very fast in terms of CPU time and user friendly.\n\nPersonalized Information Environments: Do Public Libraries Want a Slice of the PIE?\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nWorcester, Lea\n\n2003-01-01\n\nDiscussion of personalized information environments (PIEs) focuses on library personalized interfaces.

Failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) technique has been applied to improve the frozen pie process. Pareto chart is also used to determine the major defects of frozen pie. There are 3 main processes that cause the defects which are the 1st freezing to glazing process, the forming process, and the folding process. The Risk Priority Number (RPN) obtained from FMEA is analyzed to reduce the defects. If RPN of each cause exceeds 45, the process will be considered to be improved and selected for the corrective and preventive actions. The results showed that RPN values decreased after the correction. Therefore, the implementation of FMEA technique can help to improve the performance of frozen pie process and reduce the defects approximately 51.9%.\n\nNuestro concepto actual del pie valgo\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nDorca Coll, Adelina; Cespedes Cespedes, TomÃ¡s; Concustell Gonfaus, Josep; SacristÃ¡n Valero, Sergi; Dorca Coll, Ma.

The causal pie model has fulfilled this role in epidemiology and could be of similar value in evolutionary biology and ecology. In the causal pie model, outcomes result from sufficient causes. Each sufficient cause is made up of a \"causal pie\" of \"component causes\". Several different causal pies may exist for the same outcome. If and only if all component causes of a sufficient cause are present, that is, a causal pie is complete, does the outcome occur. The effect of a component cause hence depends on the presence of the other component causes that constitute some causal pie. Because all component causes are equally and fully causative for the outcome, the sum of causes for some outcome exceeds 100%. The causal pie model provides a way of thinking that maps into a number of recurrent themes in evolutionary biology and ecology: It charts when component causes have an effect and are subject to natural selection, and how component causes affect selection on other component causes; which partitions of outcomes with respect to causes are feasible and useful; and how to view the composition of a(n apparently homogeneous) population. The diversity of specific results that is directly understood from the causal pie model is a test for both the validity and the applicability of the model. The causal pie model provides a common language in which results across disciplines can be communicated and serves as a template along which future causal analyses can be made.\n\nPie en espejo\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nDelgado QuiÃ±ones, Alberto; Pancorbo Sandoval, Enrique; Diaz Prieto, Giraldo; MartÃ­n Tirado, Juan Carlos; HernÃ¡ndez Varela, Duniesky; Cruz Alard, Ronald\n\n2014-01-01\n\nPaciente masculino de 79 aÃ±os de edad, el cual presenta en el miembro inferior izquierdo a nivel del pie una malformaciÃ³n congÃ©nita que corresponde a un pie en espejo, representado por 9 artejos, articulados en 8 metatarsianos, pie zambo, seudoartrosis alta de la tibia y luxaciÃ³n congÃ©nita alta del peronÃ©.

However, the kind of dental chart available will often vary as a number of types of odontogram have been developed where the visual representation of dental conditions has relied on hand-drawn representation. We propose the Digital Dental Chart (DDC) as a new style of dental chart, especially for open investigations aimed at establishing the identity of unknown bodies. Each DDC is constructed using actual oral digital images and dental data, and is easy to upload onto an Internet website. The DDC is a more useful forensic resource than the standard types of dental chart in current use as it has several advantages, among which are its ability to carry a large volume of information and reproduce dental conditions clearly and in detail on a cost-effective basis.\n\nPost irradiation effects (PIE) in integrated circuits\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nBarnes, C.E.; Shaw, D.C.; Fleetwood, D.M.; Winokur, P.S.\n\n1992-01-01\n\nPost Irradiation Effects (PIE) ranging from normal recovery catastrophic failure have been observed in integrated circuits during the PIE period.

In order to do so, social aspects of childhood in the (probable time when the story was created are presented, as well as some curiosities about the text. Furthermore, this paper brings a personal statement (by the authors of a storytelling activity in a public school nursery in Porto Alegre, based upon the version of the book The Pied Piper of Hamelin, by Tatiana Belinky. After some questions and informal conversation about the tale, the childrenâs verbal expositions were analyzed. The research brings, as a theoretical background, contributions of studies from authors connected, mainly, to the field of Childrenâs Literature and Education. It brought the conclusion that the piperâs story motivated representative interventions, since during the storytelling activity children used typical aspects of their culture and also showed their dominium of temporal arrangement of the textâs events, as well as their peculiar creativity â according to their age â of recreating in the situation of the so-called make-believe.\n\nPrevenciÃ³n de Ãºlceras en el pie del paciente diabÃ©tico\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAnÃ¡lida Pinilla Roa\n\n2000-01-01\n\nFull Text Available La Diabetes Mellitus tipo dos (1 es una de las enfermedades metabÃ³licas mÃ¡s comunes dentro de la poblaciÃ³n adulta (mayor de 30 aÃ±os, da lugar a mÃºltiples complicaciones como insuficiencia renal, enfermedades cardiovasculares, ceguera, neuropatÃ­a perifÃ©rica y amputaciones de los miembros inferiores.

For fuel design, reactivity decrease due to it should be considered. Out of reactors, MA plays key role to define the property of spent fuel (SF) such as Î±-radioactivity, neutron emission rate, and criticality of SF. In order to evaluate the calculation codes and libraries for predicting the amount of MA, comparison between calculation results and experimentally obtained data has been conducted. In this report, we will present the status of PIE data of MA taken by post irradiation examinations (PIE) and several calculation results.

Structural analysis of four of these seemingly unrelated proteins revealed the recurrent use of a conserved beta-sandwich fold that has not been observed in any eukaryotic or prokaryotic protein. Herein we propose to call this unique structural scaffolding the PIE (Poxvirus Immune Evasion) domain. PIE domain containing proteins are abundant in chordopoxvirinae, with our analysis identifying 20 likely PIE subfamilies among 33 representative genomes spanning 7 genera. For example, cowpox strain Brighton Red appears to encode 10 different PIEs: vCCI, A41, C8, M2, T4 (CPVX203), and the SECRET proteins CrmB, CrmD, SCP-1, SCP-2, and SCP-3. Characterized PIE proteins all appear to be nonessential for virus replication, and all contain signal peptides for targeting to the secretory pathway. The PIE subfamilies differ primarily in the number, size, and location of structural embellishments to the beta-sandwich core that confer unique functional specificities. Reported ligands include chemokines, GM-CSF, IL-2, MHC class I, and glycosaminoglycans. We expect that the list of ligands and receptors engaged by the PIE domain will grow as we come to better understand how this versatile structural architecture can be tailored to manipulate host responses to infection.\n\n49 CFR 40.385 - Who bears the burden of proof in a PIE proceeding?\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n2010-10-01\n\n... 49 Transportation 1 2010-10-01 2010-10-01 false Who bears the burden of proof in a PIE proceeding...

Four lead test assemblies (LTAs) were manufactured with weapons-grade mixed oxide (WG-MOX) fuel and irradiated in the Catawba Nuclear Station Unit 1, to a maximum fuel rod burnup of â¼47.3 GWd/MTHM. As part of the fuel qualification process, five rods with varying burnups and initial plutonium contents were selected from one assembly and shipped to the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) for hot cell examination. ORNL has provided analytical support for the post-irradiation examination (PIE) of these rods via extensive fuel performance modeling which has aided in instrument settings and PIE data interpretation. The results of these fuel performance simulations are compared in this paper with available PIE data.\n\nShelf life of pie caps with biodegradable films as spacers\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nDaniela VerÃ³nica Escobar Gianni\n\n2013-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Commonly pie caps at market use polyethylene films as spacers between them.

The Las Pirquitas thrust, which has transported and uplifted the Pie de Palo Complex, is recognized for at least 30 km in a roughly NE direction along the western boundary of the Pie de Palo Complex, beyond its limited outcrop. The type of sediments of the Caucete Group in the footwall of the Las Pirquitas thrust, which are regarded as the leading edge of the Precordillera terrane, are associated with much less pronounced magnetic anomalies. In addition, a conspicuous, NNE trending, broad magnetic high stands out in the survey, several kilometers to the east of the main outcrops of the Pie de Palo Complex; this broad magnetic anomaly bisects the Pie de Palo basement block, and continues further south at least as far as 32Â°S, the southern boundary of the latest aeromagnetic survey. This magnetic anomaly is interpreted to represent a structure corresponding to the Grenvillian Precordillera-Pie de Palo tectonic boundary zone, and would comprise the buried largest part of the mafic-ultramafic belt. The geophysical model of the magnetic data indicates that the boundary zone dips to the east, possibly suggesting the existence of a set of synthetic east dipping, west-verging thrusts, of which only one major structure (Las Pirquitas thrust) is exposed; the possibility of other slivers of upthrust boundary zone material cannot be excluded. It is considered that the Pie de Palo Complex represents a small sliver upthrust from the unexposed boundary zone material (containing highly magnetic mafic-ultramafic rocks). The east-dipping, west verging structures associated with the Pie de Palo Complex are suggested to represent an Ordovician reactivation of a Grenvillian suture zone developed when the Precordillera basement and Pie de Palo terrane docked; this\n\nEl pie del diabÃ©tico\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nParra Myriam\n\n1990-12-01\n\nFull Text Available\n\nExisten complicaciones neurovasculares perifÃ©ricas en el paciente diabÃ©tico que de no prevenirse o tratarse precozmente pueden conducir a la formaciÃ³n de lesiones graves e irreversibles en el pie.

De las lesiones descritas en el baile flamenco profesional, destacan las relacionadas con el pie y la rodilla, en relaciÃ³n al microtraumatismo repetido del gesto tÃ©cnico del zapateado y a la flexiÃ³n de rodilla mantenida que requiere. El objetivo de este estudio es determinar la presencia de dolor patelo femoral en profesionales del baile de flamenco y comprobar si existe relaciÃ³n alguna con el pie pronador y genus valgo. En el estudio han participado 46 profesionales del baile flamenco, 38 bailaoras y 8 bailaores, con una carga media de 25.4 Â± 8.25 horas de baile semanales. El 34.78% de los participantes presentaban dolor patelofemoral. El 24% presentaba tambiÃ©n genus valgo. Se encontrÃ³ un 34.78% de pies pronadores. La asociaciÃ³n de pies pronadores y genus valgo fue del 31.25%, mientras que la asociaciÃ³n de pies pronadores y dolor patelofemoral fue de 43.75 % de los casos. Factores predisponentes de esta patologÃ­a se dan en la prÃ¡ctica del baile flamenco: el impacto repetitivo, una posiciÃ³n mantenida y forzada de la rodilla en un rango concreto, desplazamientos y los giros bruscos.

To drive progress towards injury reduction goals, additional tools are needed. Statistical process control charts, a methodology that has not been previously applied to Army injury monitoring, capitalise on existing medical surveillance data to provide information to leadership about injury trends necessary for prevention planning and evaluation. Statistical process control Shewhart u-charts were created for 49 US Army installations using quarterly injury medical encounter rates, 2007-2015, for active duty soldiers obtained from the Defense Medical Surveillance System. Injuries were defined according to established military injury surveillance recommendations. Charts display control limits three standard deviations (SDs) above and below an installation-specific historical average rate determined using 28 data points, 2007-2013. Charts are available in Army strategic management dashboards. From 2007 to 2015, Army injury rates ranged from 1254 to 1494 unique injuries per 1000 person-years. Installation injury rates ranged from 610 to 2312 injuries per 1000 person-years. Control charts identified four installations with injury rates exceeding the upper control limits at least once during 2014-2015, rates at three installations exceeded the lower control limit at least once and 42 installations had rates that fluctuated around the historical mean. Control charts can be used to drive progress towards injury reduction goals by indicating statistically significant increases and decreases in injury rates. Future applications to military subpopulations, other health outcome metrics and chart enhancements are suggested. Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

AGR-1 was the first in a series of TRISO fuel irradiation experiments initiated in 2006 under the Advanced Gas Reactor (AGR) Fuel Development and Qualification Program; this work continues to be funded by the Department of Energy's Office of Nuclear Energy as part of the Advanced Reactor Technologies (ART) initiative. AGR-1 fuel compacts were fabricated at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) in 2006 and irradiated for three years in the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) Advanced Test Reactor (ATR) to demonstrate and evaluate fuel performance under HTGR irradiation conditions. PIE is being performed at INL and ORNL to study how the fuel behaved during irradiation, and to examine fuel performance during exposure to elevated temperatures at or above temperatures that could occur during a depressurized conduction cooldown event. This report summarizes safety testing of irradiated AGR-1 Compact 5-1-1 in the ORNL Core Conduction Cooldown Test Facility (CCCTF) and post-safety testing PIE.\n\nDevelopment, irradiation testing and PIE of UMo fuel at AECL\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nSears, D.F.\n\n2005-01-01\n\nThis paper reviews recent U-Mo dispersion fuel development, irradiation testing and postirradiation examination (PIE) activities at AECL. Low-enriched uranium fuel alloys and powders have been fabricated at Chalk River Labs, with compositions ranging from U-7Mo to U-10Mo. The bulk alloys and powders were characterized using optical and scanning electron microscopy, chemical analysis, X-ray diffraction and neutron diffraction analysis. The analyses confirmed that the powders were of high quality, and in the desired gamma phase. Subsequently, kilogram quantities of DU-Mo and LEU-Mo powder have been manufactured for commercial customers. Mini-elements have been fabricated with LEU-7Mo and LEU-10Mo dispersed in aluminum, with a nominal loading of 4.5 gU/cm 3 . These have been irradiated in the NRU reactor at linear powers up to 100 kW/m. The mini-elements achieved 60 atom% 235 U burnup in 2004 March, and the irradiation is continuing to a planned discharge burnup of 80 atom% 235 U. Interim PIE has been conducted on mini-elements that were removed after 20 atom% 235 U burnup. The PIE results are presented in this paper.

One of the important items is to develop high-performance fuel. For this purpose, it is essential to carry out post-irradiation examinations (PIE) for evaluation of irradiated fuel performance and also to establish the PIE technology. This paper describes the current status of PIE results including its technology in O-arai Engineering Center of JNC. The facilities have been operating safely and successfully since the 1960's. Obtained PIE data were reflected to the design and operation of the experimental fast reactor JOYO, the prototype fast reactor MONJU and future fast reactors. The core modification from the breeding core (MK-I) to the irradiation core (MK-II) of JOYO was performed in 1982. Irradiation tests of fuels and materials in MK-II core started in 1982. At PIE facilities in OEC, 65 of driver fuels, fuel irradiation test rigs, material irradiation test rigs and several other components were examined related to JOYO MK-II core operation, and thus a lot of aspects were accumulated for irradiated fuel behaviors. As topical activities of these PIE techniques, burnup measurement and analytical technique for Minor Actinides (MA), such as neptunium and americium were described here.

One is Irradiated Material Examination Facility (IMEF) to examine irradiated nuclear fuels and core structural materials at HANARO, and the other is a Post Irradiation Examination Facility (PIEF) to do the operated PWR nuclear fuels and skeleton. Their activities are categorized by hot cell examinations, new technique developments, maintenance of facility utilities and a public acceptance work. In the past three years hot cell tests were executed over 2,000 times related to R and D projects of the future and next generation reactors such as SMART, U-Mo fuels, I-NERI etc., including 30 rods to be operated in domestic PWR's. To supply PIE data on time to the user schedules new equipment and techniques are being developed for 10 items which include an annealing fission gas release rate, thermal diffusivity measurement, a laser puncturing fission gas collection system and mechanical property measurements on PWR FA skeleton etc. For maintenance of facilities the aged utility equipment are refurbished and exchanged for new ones. The partly cracked and leaking building walls are completely repaired, and the aged electric UPS's, HVAC system parts, heating and cooling system are exchanged for new ones. Additionally efforts to upgrade the public acceptance for facility visiting events, open training courses to the university and graduated students have been made. Regarding the future of domestic R and D and a power reactor operating plan the demand for hot cell examinations will be steadily increased. Along with them new PIE techniques on TRISO fuels, minor actinide SFR fuels and CANDU fuels etc are required to be developed. New space to install small scale hot cells, and develop for the extreme conditioned test to meet future demands will be taken.

However, keyword search in PubMed(Â®) is often time consuming because it requires a series of actions that refine keywords and browse search results until it reaches a goal. Due to the rapid growth of biomedical literature, it has become more difficult for biologists and curators to locate PPI information quickly. Therefore, a tool for prioritizing PPI informative articles can be a useful assistant for finding this PPI-relevant information. PIE (Protein Interaction information Extraction) the search is a web service implementing a competition-winning approach utilizing word and syntactic analyses by machine learning techniques. For easy user access, PIE the search provides a PubMed-like search environment, but the output is the list of articles prioritized by PPI confidence scores. By obtaining PPI-related articles at high rank, researchers can more easily find the up-to-date PPI information, which cannot be found in manually curated PPI databases. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IRET/PIE/.\n\nConsideraciones anatÃ³micas y funcionales en la patologÃ­a del quinto radio del pie\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nGallart Ortega, JosÃ©; Lahoz Gimeno, Manuel\n\n2013-01-01\n\nOBJETIVO: Se analiza si las diferentes alteraciones morfolÃ³gicas y funcionales del pie se asocian estadÃ­sticamente a las diferentes desviaciones del quinto radio en el plano transverso y/o sagital como posible causa o agravantes de Ã©sta.

Studies were performed in the summer of 1992 in birch forests of the Southern Urals. Artificial nesting sites (log houses) located 1.5 m above the ground were distributed over territories of two test plots: 30 log houses on the contaminated plot and 60 on the control plot (contamination with Sr-90 1.5 and 2 Â· 10 -3 mCi/m 2 , respectively). The nesting success in the great tit was similar on both plots, whereas that in the pied flycatcher was significantly greater on the control plot (in a open-quotes cleanclose quotes forest). Pied flycatchers build their nests out of highly radioactive materials, whereas great tits use nonradioactive or weakly emitting materials. Hence, pied flycatcher's nestlings receive a significant radiation dose from components of the nest: From the moment of egg laying, this dose amounts to 0.5 rem. The pied flycatcher can be used as an indicator of radioactive contamination. This species is more sensitive than the great tit, which has been successfully used as an indicator for monitoring the industrial air pollution\n\nCaracterizaciÃ³n clÃ­nico epidemiolÃ³gica de pacientes afectados por pie diabÃ©tico\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nDania NÃºÃ±ez Ãlvarez\n\n2018-01-01\n\nFull Text Available IntroducciÃ³n: el pie diabÃ©tico constituye un problema de salud en los pacientes portadores de diabetes mellitus y se registra como la primera causa de amputaciÃ³n no traumÃ¡tica de los miembros.

This triennial seminar is the seventh in series of bilateral exchange of irradiation and PIE technologies and research reactor management. Since the first joint seminar on the PIE Technology between JAERI (Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute, former agency of JAEA) and KAERI was held at JAERI Oarai Research Institute, Japan in 1992, the international cooperation program between JAEA and KAERI has been actively carried out in the field of neutron irradiation. At the fifth seminar in 2005 and sixth in 2008, the irradiation technology and the research reactor management fields were included, respectively, to the joint seminar, and it covers whole areas of irradiation using research reactors. In this seminar total 37 presentations were made in three technical sessions, which are 'research reactor management', 'advanced irradiation technology' and 'post-irradiation examination technology', and active information exchange was done among participants. Papers or manuscripts presented in the 2012 JAEA/KAERI Joint Seminar on Advanced Irradiation and PIE Technologies are contained in the proceedings.

The MEGAPIE project aimed to prove that a liquid Lead-Bismuth-Eutectic (LBE) spallation target can be licensed, planned, built, operated, dismantled, examined and disposed. The project has finished the phase of producing the samples for Post-irradiation Examination (PIE). Samples to study structural material property changes due to the harsh environment of high temperatures, contact with flowing liquid metal (LBE), proton and neutron irradiation will be investigated by all partner laboratories (CEA, CNRS, ENEA, KIT, PSI and SCK-CEN).

Comprehensive post-irradiation examination (PIE) including dimension measurement, gamma scanning, eddy current test, X ray, radiography, measurement of fission gas release, and quantitative metallography etc. were performed. PIE results show that the diameter of the fuel rods changed, ridges appeared on the cladding, pellets swelled, and the rate of fission gas release was higher than what we expected. The results would be an important basis for further improvement of design, technology and material properties for Qinshan PWR assembly.

It was a 17Â·17 fuel assembly irradiated at the Ulchin Unit 2 PWR. The peak fuel rod average burnup was about 57MWd/kgU and locally 65MWd/kgU. The general PIE was performed to investigate the fuel rod irradiation performance. Fission gas release, burnup, oxide thickness, hydrogen pickup, CRUD, and density change were measured by destructive of non-destructive test. Microstructure change, bubble and pore size distributions were observed by optical microscopy, SEM and EPMA. All generated and available PIE results were used to verify high burnup fuel performance code INFRA. Several rods were cut for additional separate effect test. For the high burnup fission gas release behaviour analysis, annealing apparatus were developed and installed in hot cell and preliminary test was performed. In addition to current apparatus new induction furnace will be installed in hot cell to investigate the high temperature and transient fission gas release behaviour. Ring tensile test was performed to analyze the material property degradation which caused by the oxidation and hydride, and additional mechanical tests will be performed.

To improve the quality or spatial resolution of neutron radiographs the normal technique was complemented with another method. The dysprosium foil/X-ray film technique is now supplemented with a track-etch recorder consisting of a cellulose nitrate film. For further examination the cellulose nitrate film can be digitised to allow electronic image treatment. Promising results were obtained with this technique on neutron radiographs, namely higher spatial resolution compared to the normal technique, high contrast and sharp neutron radiography images. The traditional one-axial profilometry of fuel rods were modified so that diameter/bow measurements are possible at several angular orientations during one acquisition sequence. This extension is very useful in several ways, for instance the built-in data symmetry of the method is used to check the correctness of the measurement results. Diameter and bow measurements give in addition detailed and complete information of canning irregularities and fuel rod profiles. PIE data are collected and compiled in an image file. Inspection and examination of the file information is possible through an ideal user-interface, i.e. Adobe photoshop software with navigator possibilities.

The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA) Working Party on the Fuel Cycle (WPFC) sponsored the workshop to identify gaps in global capabilities that need to be filled to meet projected needs in the 21st century. First and foremost, the workshop brought nine countries and associated international organizations, together in support of common needs for nuclear fuels and materials testing, characterization, PIE, and modeling capabilities. Finland, France, Germany, Republic of Korea, Russian Federation, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, United States of America, IAEA, and ITU (on behalf of European Union Joint Research Centers) discussed issues and opportunities for future technical advancements and collaborations. Second, the presentations provided a base level of understanding of current international capabilities. Three main categories were covered: (1) status of facilities and near term plans, (2) PIE needs from fuels engineering and material science perspectives, and (3) novel PIE techniques being developed to meet the needs. The International presentations provided valuable data consistent with the outcome of the National Workshop held in March 2011. Finally, the panel discussion on 21st century PIE capabilities, created a unified approach for future collaborations. In conclusion, (1) existing capabilities are not sufficient to meet the needs of a science-based approach, (2) safety issues and fuels behavior during abnormal conditions will receive more focus post-Fukushima; therefore we need to adopt our techniques to those issues, and (3) International collaboration is needed in the areas of codes and standards development for the new techniques.\n\nSocial suppliers: Exploring the cultural contours of the performance and image enhancing drug (PIED) market among bodybuilders in the Netherlands and Belgium.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nvan de Ven, Katinka; Mulrooney, Kyle J D\n\n2017-02-01\n\nThis paper explores the understudied phenomenon of performance and image enhancing drug (PIED) markets by examining the structure and formation of the market for PIEDs among bodybuilders in the Netherlands and Belgium. This article specifically seeks to account for individual reasons and motivations for dealing PIEDs within these bodybuilding subcultures. Understanding illicit PIED markets is important for policy decisions as knowledge on the production and distribution of these substances may assist in designing law enforcement efforts, harm reduction initiatives and treatment options. This article draws on two years of fieldwork in various bodybuilding settings, 47 semi-structured interviews with individuals who are directly or indirectly involved in the PIED market and 64 PIED dealing cases initiated by criminal justice agencies in the Netherlands and Belgium. The data indicates that PIED dealing groups and individuals are often driven by motivations stemming from their social and cultural embeddedness in the bodybuilding subculture. Specifically, these PIED dealers are 'over-socialized' into the structure and culture of bodybuilding and follow the cultural scripts that come with their group affiliation and organization. As a result of the cultural context in which these transactions occur, PIED dealing networks among bodybuilders in the Netherlands and Belgium are more likely to consist of friends or 'friends of friends' tied together by threads of collective meaning found within the bodybuilding subculture. We argue that efforts seeking to explain the structure, formation and motivations of illicit PIED dealing must learn to appreciate how culture mediates structural forces and thereby influences individual and collective action. Policy makers, health care professionals and other relevant parties should consider a plurality of factors (social, economic and cultural) when designing and evaluating PIED-related interventions such as law enforcement efforts, harm\n\nAlteraciones biomecÃ¡nicas del antepie en el pie zambo y su tratamiento\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nOller Asensio, Antonio; Prats Climent, Baldiri\n\n1991-01-01\n\nDefiniciÃ³n y recuerdo anÃ¡tomo-fisio-patolÃ³gico del pie zambo y de las alteraciones funcionales mÃ¡s frecuentes que se encuentran asociadas a esta patologÃ­a.

In recent years, the instrumented Charpy impact testing machine was remodeled aiming at the improvement of accuracy and reliability. By this remodeling, absorbed energy and other useful information on impact properties can be delivered from the force-displacement curve for the evaluation of neutron irradiation embrittlement behavior of LWR-RPV steels at one-time striking. In addition, two advanced PIE technologies are now under development. One is the remote machining of mechanical test pieces from actual irradiated pressure vessel steels. The other is development of low-cycle and high-cycle fatigue test technology in order to clarify the post-irradiation fatigue characteristics of structural and fuel cladding materials.

Due to shrinkage of the meat during cooking, the gap formed around the meat is usually sealed using a gelatin based jelly to exclude air and thus help to preserve the pie. The properties of the jelly are such that it will ingress into the pastry crust causing undesirable softening. The jelly is traditionally produced by simmering pig trotters with seasoning for several hours. In this work we demonstrate the potential of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a tool for investigating the conditions required for producing jellies with different properties and present two examples of this use. Firstly we demonstrate that MRI can determine the ability of water to diffuse through the jelly which is critical in minimizing the amount of moisture moving from the jelly to the crust. Secondly, the impact of jelly temperature on the penetration length into the crust is investigated. These examples highlight the power of MRI as a tool for food assessment.

In general they are marketed in inadequate way, without refrigeration and most of times without any protection against various types of contaminants, including microbial contamination that can cause food toxi-infections to consumers. This study aimed to evaluate the microbiological quality of pies sold in 105 stalls in 23 special fair city of GoiÃ¢nia, and also the impact of training on the Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP in the quality of these products. The micro-organisms investigated were those required the by standard microbiological: Salmonella, fecal coliforms, Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus coagulase positive. We also observed the temperature exposure of these foods on newsstands. We analyzed 259 samples in total, with 209 in the first stage, before the training of the fairground, and 50 in the second, after qualifying for the fair dealers in GMP. Pies sweets collected before training of fair dealers were considered unfit for consumption because it contains health indicators above the recommended limit (65.6% with fecal coliforms, 20.6% Staphylococcus coagulase positive and 16.8% with Bacillus cereus. In samples collected after training there was an improvement in the indices (28,0% contained coliforms, 14,0% Staphylococcus coagulase positive and 28,0% of Bacillus cereus, all above the limit set. None samples had Salmonella in both steps. It can be concluded that with the training of fair dealers there was an improvement in the microbiological quality of these products. These results reinforce the need for training of the fairground and the impact it can have on the quality of the products. The storage temperatures pies ranged from â5.3ÂºC to 28.7ÂºC in first step and â3.6ÂºC to 24.0ÂºC in the second. The presence of the refrigerated was not sufficient to maintain the optimal temperature (to 10 Â° C for storage of pies.\n\nOxidative stress in pied flycatcher (Ficedula hypoleuca) nestlings from metal contaminated environments in northern Sweden\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nBerglund, A.M.M.; Sturve, J.; Foerlin, L.; Nyholm, N.E.I.\n\n2007-01-01\n\nMetals have been shown to induce oxidative stress in animals. One of the most metal polluted terrestrial environments in Sweden is the surroundings of a sulfide ore smelter plant located in the northern part of the country. Pied flycatcher nestlings (Ficedula hypoleuca) that grew up close to the industry had accumulated amounts of arsenic, cadmium, mercury, lead, iron and zinc in their liver tissue. The aim of this study was to investigate if pied flycatcher nestlings in the pollution gradient of the industry were affected by oxidative stress using antioxidant molecules and enzyme activities. The antioxidant assays were also evaluated in search for useful biomarkers in pied flycatchers. This study indicated that nestlings in metal contaminated areas showed signs of oxidative stress evidenced by up regulated hepatic antioxidant defense given as increased glutathione reductase (GR) and catalase (CAT) activities and slightly but not significantly elevated lipid peroxidation and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activities. Stepwise linear regression indicated that lipid peroxidation and CAT activities were influenced mostly by iron, but iron and lead influenced the CAT activity to a higher degree. Positive relationships were found between GST and lead as well as GR activities and cadmium. We conclude that GR, CAT, GST activities and lipid peroxidation levels may function as useful biomarkers for oxidative stress in free-living pied flycatcher nestlings exposed to metal contaminated environments\n\nFusionCharts Beginner's Guide The Official Guide for FusionCharts Suite\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nNadhani, Sanket; Bhattacharya, Shamasis\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThe book is written as a practical, step-by-step guide to using FusionCharts Suite.

Although PDAs have always been designed to be intuitive and easy to use, recent advances in technology have made them even more accessible. The ability to link data on a PDA (client) to a central database (server) allows for near-unlimited potential in developing point of care applications and systems for patient data management. Although many stand-alone systems exist for PDAs, none are designed to work in an integrated client/server environment. This paper describes the design, software and hardware selection, and preliminary testing of a PDA based patient data and charting system for use in the University of Washington Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). This system will be the subject of a subsequent study to determine its impact on patient outcomes and clinician efficiency.\n\nPaperless chart recording helps cut costs\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nCollier, K.; Sullivan, M.E.\n\n1997-01-01\n\nTurbine generator data acquisition systems using personal computers have been installed at the Limerick BWR power plant to replace paper-based chart recorders.

There were studied 24 samples of Murcia's meat pie from the six best-selling retail establishments in this Region (four units per establishment).The moisture, protein, fat, carbohydrates, fibre and minerals, contents and the energy value, fatty acid profile and fat quality were analyzed using the Official Analysis Methods of Foods. All analyses were performed by triplicate. The average weight of this product was 192.3 Â± 11.8 g, with three differentiated parts (base, filling and pastry lid). All ingredients were natural raw materials: wheat flour, lard, ground beef, sliced boiled egg and chorizo, water and spices (salt, pepper, garlic, paprika and nutmeg). Most of its organoleptic attributes are due to the type and amount of fat or lard. The combination of the other ingredients and the particular formulation of the spices are also responsible of other attributes. Due to its protein content (11.0%), this meat pie can replace other meat dishes, and be incorporated into a balanced diet. However, it is necessary to take into account its fat and energy contents (17.3 g and 317 kcal/100 g, respectively). Unlike many common pastry products, it contains no trans fatty acids. The results of the research show that the studied product remains, at present, an artisan food, and offer reliable information that it is representative of the energy and nutritional values of the Murcia's meat pie, a typical product of the gastronomy of the Region of Murcia.

To improve the quality or spatial resolution of neutron radiographs the normal technique was complemented with another method, i.e. the dysprosium foil/X ray film technique is supplemented with a track-etch recorder consisting of a cellulose nitrate film. For further examination of the neutron radiographs the cellulose nitrate film can be digitized to allow electronic image treatment. Promising results were obtained with this technique on neutron radiographs, namely higher spatial resolution compared to the normal technique, high contrast and sharp neutron radiography images.

Since then, ca. 9,000 nestlings were ringed at different sites in the Russian part of the Courish Spit. A total of 557 individuals ringed as pulli were recaptured in subsequent seasons in the study area. Both males and females are more often recaptured in the plots where they were ringed than in other plots. These results were interpreted in the framework of the hypothesis forwarded by LÃ¶hrl (1959 and supported by Berndt & Winkel (1979. These authors suggested that cavity nesters (pied flycatchers and collared flycatchers F. albicollis imprint their future local breeding area during the period of postfledging exploration. Birds that survive until the next spring, return to these imprinted areas to breed. A similar study done by Sokolov et al. (1984 on the Courish Spit in an open nesting species, the chaffinch Fringilla coelebs, confirmed this finding. We assumed that juvenile pied flycatchers disperse for varying distances during their postfledging movements and imprint a local area, some 1â5 kilometres in diameter. This area is the goal of their migration next spring. It is suggested that in spring, yearlings are nonârandomly distributed in respect to the area they have imprinted as juveniles. Recently, Vysotsky (2000, 2001 reâanalysed the same data on philopatry of pied flycatchers on the Courish Spit and forwarded an alternative hypothesis. He suggests that juveniles, both males and females, do not imprint any local area during the postfledging period, but are distributed randomly across the area of several dozens of kilometres in spring. Vysotsky was able to show that distribution of distances of natal dispersal did not differ from the random pattern the study plot which was an 8.5 km long line of nest boxes along the Courish Spit. The aim of this study was to test these two alternative hypotheses. To do so, we\n\nGrowth Charts (For Parents)\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n...

La educaciÃ³n sanitaria en el cuidado de los pies de los diabÃ©ticos, asÃ­ como la cuantificaciÃ³n del riesgo son aspectos que el enfermero debe incorporar en los planes de cuidados de los pacientes diabÃ©ticos. La detecciÃ³n de los posibles factores de riesgo es un paso previo imprescindible para estos cometidos. Este estudio tiene como finalidad analizar la presencia de determinados factores de riesgo en pie diabÃ©tico en la poblaciÃ³n diabÃ©tica del Centro de Salud de Triana, con el objetivo de poder realizar, asÃ­, una estratificaciÃ³n del riesgo. Para ello, se optÃ³ por la realizaciÃ³n de un estudio observacional descriptivo. La muestra analizada estaba constituida por 96 sujetos diabÃ©ticos pertenecientes a dicho centro de salud. Para la recogida de datos se utilizÃ³ un sistema de tres niveles consistente en entrevista, exploraciÃ³n fÃ­sica y consulta de registros disponibles (a travÃ©s de las historias clÃ­nicas de los sujetos. Los datos se registraron en un formulario de recogida de datos para pie diabÃ©tico. Se determinÃ³ la existencia de factores de riesgo, analizando las relaciones entre Ã©stos y permitiendo la estratificaciÃ³n del riesgo en la poblaciÃ³n estudiada.The diabetic foot is a chronic complication of diabetes mellitus and constitutes a sanitary problem which causes not only enormous expenses for the sanitary system but also provokes emotional repercussions for the person who suffers the illness and for the family. The sanitary education in taking care of the feet of diabetics and the identification of the health risk are both aspects that the nurse must include in the healthcare planning of diabetic patients. The detection of the possible risk\n\nActive basement uplift as seen with cosmogenic lenses: the Sierra Pie de Palo case (Western Argentina)\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSiame, L. L.; SÃ©brier, M.; Costa, C. H.; Ahumada, E. A.; Bellier, O.\n\n2013-12-01\n\nThe Andean foreland of western Argentina (28Â°S-33Â°S) corresponds to retroarc deformations associated with the ongoing flat subduction of the Nazca plate beneath the South American lithosphere, and associated with high levels of seismic activity and crustal active faulting. To improve earthquake source identification and characterization in the San Juan region, data from seismology, structural geology and quantitative geomorphology can be integrated and combined to provide a seismotectonic model. In this model, the Andean back-arc of western Argentina has to be regarded as an obliquely converging foreland where Plio-Quaternary deformations are partitioned between strike-slip and thrust motions that are localized on the E-verging, thin-skinned Argentine Precordillera, and the W-verging thick-skinned Sierras Pampeanas, respectively. In this domain, the Sierra Pie de Palo is a key structure playing a major role in the partitioning of the Plio-Quaternary deformations. Located in the westernmost Sierras Pampeanas, the Sierra Pie de Palo forms a NNE striking, 80 km-long and 35-40 km-wide, ellipsoid range that reaches elevation as high as 3162 m. This mountain range is an actively growing basement fold associated with a high level of seismic activity (e.g., the November 23, 1977, Caucete, Mw 7.4 earthquake). To evaluate the degree of tectonic activity around the Sierra Pie de Palo, we combined a detailed morphometric analysis of the topography together with in situ-produced cosmogenic 10Be concentrations measured in (1) bedrock outcrops corresponding to the exhumed erosional regional surface, (2) surface boulders abandoned on alluvial fans deformed by active faults, and (3) in fluvial sediments sampled at the outlets of selected watersheds that drains out from the Sierra Pie de Palo. All together, our results allows: (1) assessing quantitative constraints on the rate of tectonic and denudation processes that are responsible for the active growth and erosion of the Sierra\n\nGiant Paperclip Necklaces, Soup-Can Rings and Cherry-Pie Hats\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nWinters, Laurel A.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nIn this article, the author describes an art project inspired by the wearable sculpture art created by artist Marjorie Schick.

At low concentrations, the interactions are consistent with a monomer-dimer equilibrium (Comar et al., J Am Chem Soc 136(23):8342-8349, 2014). At high concentrations in native tissue, higher-order clusters have been observed (Fotiadis et al., Nature 421:127-128, 2003). The physiological role of rhodopsin dimerization is still being investigated, but it is clear that a quantitative assessment is essential to determining the function of rhodopsin clusters in vision. To quantify rhodopsin interactions, I will outline the theory and methodology of a specialized time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy for measuring membrane protein-protein interactions called pulsed-interleaved excitation fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy (PIE-FCCS). The strength of this technique is its ability to quantify rhodopsin interactions in situ (i.e., a live cell plasma membrane). There are two reasons for restricting the scope to live cell membranes. First, the compositional heterogeneity of the plasma membrane creates a complex milieu with thousands of lip"
