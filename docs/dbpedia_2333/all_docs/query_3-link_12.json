        "text": "A day in the classroom is a day of simulating national instruments of power for the Great Power Competition. At the forefront of military education, Air University's Air War College is pioneering new heights in strategic preparedness through an immersive wargame centered on Pacific conflict scenarios. This cutting-edge exercise is sculpting the future leaders of our force, equipping them with the acumen to navigate the complexities of great power competition. The wargame's structure allows participants to strategize from both the U.S. and Chinese perspectives, offering a comprehensive understanding of the operational theatre. Through meticulously designed phases, the wargame transitions from strategic mobilization to intense kinetic engagements, culminating in a nuanced exploration of Freedom of Navigation Operations. It's a holistic approach where every card drawn and every move made translates into deep strategic insights, preparing our students for real-world challenges they are likely to face in future command roles. The integration of wargaming into the Professional Military Education (PME) curriculum is revolutionizing the learning experience, bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application. This isn't just about academic achievement; it's about fostering a robust strategic mindset, ready to contribute effectively to our national security and leadership. #GreatPowerCompetition #StrategicMindset #InnovativeLearning #PacingThreat Air Education and Training Command United States Air Force China Aerospace Studies Institute Air & Space Forces Magazine Air & Space Forces Association https://lnkd.in/eGrGhGWB\n\nFor more than 30 years, NCEE has been dedicated to identifying and learning from the highest-performing school systems both in the United States and around the world. Our goal? To uncover valuable lessons and insights that can boost the performance and student outcomes of education systems everywhere. Join us in looking at the Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA), which serves children of military families both in the U.S. and overseas. In recent years, DoDEA students have consistently outperformed their peers in other states on the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP)‚Äîand by wide margins. DoDEA has made significant progress in closing achievement gaps between White students and their Black and Hispanic classmates. During the #COVID19 pandemic, it was the only school system to see its scores hold steady and even rise. Download the case study to learn more about this unique, high-performing education system‚Äìits structure, governance, curriculum standards, assessment methods, and culture of support for students and families. https://lnkd.in/grJrxizH #EdResearch #K12Education #StudentSuccess #EdLeadership #SystemDesign\n\nA new study explores an innovative XR-supported educational programme aimed at enhancing military education. üîé The focus? The protection of civilians in armed conflicts through a threat-based approach. This method challenges traditional military practices by encouraging officers to think critically about how threats to civilians varies in civil wars and how different threats requires different military responses. üìà The results? An engaging learning environment that fosters critical discussion and immersive peer-to-peer learning, leading to high acceptance levels of the new educational approach among master's degree learners at the Norwegian Defence University College. This initiative not only represents a significant step forward in military education but also underscores the potential of XR technologies in fostering deeper understanding and effective learning strategies of so called \"troublesome knowledge\". The study is co-authored by our very own Stian Kjeksrud and Petter HF Lindqvist, alongside Jos√© Garc√≠a Estrada, Ekaterina Prasolova-Forland, Chryssa Themelis, Kristine Kvam, Ole Midthun, Knut Sverre, Leif Martin Hokstad, Soud Khalifa Mohamed, Simone G., and Serena Ricci. üíêCongratulations to the authors for their groundbreaking work! Link to article in the comments üëá Norges teknisk-naturvitenskapelige universitet (NTNU) | Fynd Reality | TRY Dig #MilitaryEducation #VirtualReality #InnovativeLearning #XRtechnology #openaccess\n\nI posted this as a response in a thread. I think it is worth offering for general consideration so that I may assess reactions. ‚ÄúThe spiral‚Äù may be starting. Hypotheses: 1. Increased disincentives to stay in higher education in the US. 2. Increased disincentives for the best researchers to enter higher education instead of other areas (government, military, industry) in the US. 3. Viewing higher education as an avenue for those who cannot do well in other areas. 4. Failure/consolidation of the less competitive private universities. This will be a drawn out process but accelerating as it goes on.\n\nMilitary Education and Learning by Dr. Bruce I Gudmundsson Author‚Äôs Note: I consider Dr. Bruce I Gudmundsson (USMC retired) one of the finest military historians in the world, and a close friend and mentor. Bruce earned his PhD from Oxford University, and his undergraduate from Yale. He has been foremost in reforming how the USMC learns. His books and articles are widely read, while being mandatory reading across the spectrum of the US military and NATO. But due to run ins with the Government Service (GS) employee mafia at the USMC Training and Education Command (TECOM) over methodology and standards, he has no position inside TECOM. He has applied for positions in the recent past, but was not selected despite a glaring and overwhelming resume. If the USMC was smart, Bruce should be an SES over seeing learning (education and training) in the Marines. Bruce also founded the School of Advanced Warfare (SAW). SAW is the second year for selected majors in the USMC and our allies focused on mastering operational art in Maneuver Warfare (they did use many methods translated by Bruce from the German Kriegsakademie). Currently, he is at the forefront of using the Decision Forcing Cases as a way to educate decision makers at all levels, as well as an authority on wargaming. Many courses continue to use his methodology in their course work. From Bruce Gudmundsson: ‚ÄúReaders interested in military education and training, and, in particular, the use of decision-forcing cases and other kinds of decision games, may find something of interest in the following articles, all of which I wrote in 2018.‚Äù \" The Education of the Enlightened Soldier\" https://lnkd.in/gBbre26g \"A Fourth Way in Professional Military Education\" proposes that staff colleges, war colleges, and similar institutions build programs of instruction out of decision-forcing cases. https://lnkd.in/gg6Npi3N \"Decision-Forcing Cases for Logistics\" https://lnkd.in/g37W_7Cv \"How to Make a Decision-Forcing Case: The Military Memoir Method\" https://lnkd.in/gkdA2Yad \"How to Make a Decision-Forcing Case: The Combat Case Study Method\" describes a technique for turning accounts of engagements into decision-forcing cases. \"Preparing for Free-Play Field Exercises: https://lnkd.in/gSK7CgTg"
