        "text": "Intrinsic nitric oxide regulates the taste response of the sugar receptor cell in the blowfly, Phormia regina.\n\nPubMed\n\nMurata, Yoshihiro; Mashiko, Masashi; Ozaki, Mamiko; Amakawa, Taisaku; Nakamura, Tadashi\n\n2004-01-01\n\nThe taste organ in insects is a hair-shaped taste sensory unit having four functionally differentiated contact chemoreceptor cells. In the blowfly, Phormia regina, cGMP has been suggested to be a second messenger for the sugar receptor cell. Generally, cGMP is produced by membranous or soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC), which can be activated by nitric oxide (NO). In the present paper, we electrophysiologically showed that an NO scavenger, 2-phenyl-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-3-oxide-1-oxyl (PTIO), an NO donor, 1-hydroxy-2-oxo-3-(N-methyl-3-aminopropyl)-3-methyl-1-triazene (NOC 7) or an NO synthase (NOS) inhibitor, NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) specifically affected the response in the sugar receptor cell, but not in other receptor cells. PTIO, when introduced into the receptor cells in a sensillum aided by sodium deoxycholate (DOC, pH 7.2), depressed the response of sugar receptor cells to sucrose but did not affect those of the salt or water receptor cells. NOC 7, given extracellularly, latently induced the response of sugar receptor cells; and L-NAME, when introduced into the receptor cells, depressed the response of sugar receptor cells. The results clearly suggest that NO, which may be produced by intrinsic NOS in sugar receptor cells, participates in the transduction cascade of these cells in blowfly.\n\nAversive odorant causing appetite decrease downregulates tyrosine decarboxylase gene expression in the olfactory receptor neuron of the blowfly, Phormia regina\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nIshida, Yuko; Ozaki, Mamiko\n\n2012-01-01\n\nIn the blowfly Phormia regina, exposure to d-limonene for 5 days during feeding inhibits proboscis extension reflex behavior due to decreasing tyramine (TA) titer in the brain. TA is synthesized by tyrosine decarboxylase (Tdc) and catalyzed into octopamine (OA) by TA Ã-hydroxylase (Tbh). To address the mechanisms of TA titer regulation in the blowfly, we cloned Tdc and Tbh cDNAs from P. regina (PregTdc and PregTbh). The deduced amino acid sequences of both proteins showed high identity to those of the corresponding proteins from Drosophila melanogaster at the amino acid level. PregTdc was expressed in the antenna, labellum, and tarsus whereas PregTbh was expressed in the head, indicating that TA is mainly synthesized in the sensory organs whereas OA is primarily synthesized in the brain. d-Limonene exposure significantly decreased PregTdc expression in the antenna but not in the labellum and the tarsus, indicating that PregTdc expressed in the antenna is responsible for decreasing TA titer. PregTdc-like immunoreactive material was localized in the thin-walled sensillum. In contrast, the OA/TA receptor (PregOAR/TAR) was localized to the thick-walled sensillum. The results indicated that d-limonene inhibits PregTdc expression in the olfactory receptor neurons in the thin-walled sensilla, likely resulting in reduced TA levels in the receptor neurons in the antenna. TA may be transferred from the receptor neuron to the specific synaptic junction in the antennal lobe of the brain through the projection neurons and play a role in conveying the aversive odorant information to the projection and local neurons.\n\nPerception of noxious compounds by contact chemoreceptors of the blowfly, Phormia regina: putative role of an odorant-bindingpProtein.\n\nPubMed\n\nOzaki, Mamiko; Takahara, Teruhiko; Kawahara, Yasuhiro; Wada-Katsumata, Ayako; Seno, Keiji; Amakawa, Taisaku; Yamaoka, Ryohei; Nakamura, Tadashi\n\n2003-05-01\n\nThe blowfly, Phormia regina, has sensilla with four contact-chemoreceptor cells and one mechanoreceptor cell on its labellum. Three of the four chemoreceptor cells are called the sugar, the salt and the water receptor cells, respectively. However, the specificity of the remaining chemoreceptor cell, traditionally called the \"fifth cell\", has not yet been clarified. Referring to behavioral evaluation of the oral toxicity of monoterpenes, we measured the electrophysiological response of the \"fifth cell\" to these compounds. Of all the monoterpenes examined, D-limonene exhibited the strongest oral toxicity and induced the severest aversive behavior with vomiting and/or excretion in the fly. D-Limonene, when dispersed in an aqueous stimulus solution including dimethyl sulfoxide or an odorant-binding protein (OBP) found in the contact-chemoreceptor sensillum, the chemical sense-related lipophilic ligand-binding protein (CRLBP), evoked impulses from the \"fifth cell\". Considering the relationship between the aversive effects of monoterpenes and the response of the \"fifth cell\" to these effects, we propose that the \"fifth cell\" is a warning cell that has been differentiated as a taste system for detecting and avoiding dangerous foods. Here we suggest that in the insect contact-chemoreceptor sensillum, CRLBP carries lipophilic members of the noxious taste substances to the \"fifth cell\" through the aqueous sensillum lymph. This insect OBP may functionally be analogous to the von Ebner's grand protein in taste organs of mammals.\n\nEffect of Channel Blockers on the Smooth Muscle of the Adult Crop of the Queen Blowfly, Phormia regina\n\nPubMed Central\n\nStoffolano, John G.; Danai, Laura; Chambers, James\n\n2013-01-01\n\nFew studies have examined the various factors affecting the rate of contraction of the supercontractile muscles of the crop lobes of adult Phormia regina Meigen (Diptera: Calliphoridae). Using an in situ bioassay of the crop organ, various ion channel blockers were tested and it was demonstrated that in all cases the blockers (i.e., against the following conductances: Cl- , Ca2+ , Na+, and a FMRF-amide action) significantly reduced the contraction rates of the crop lobes, which were filled with 4.5 ÂµL of 1.0 M sucrose containing 10 mM of the dye amaranth. Benzyltrimethylammonium chloride, never before reported for its effect on insect muscle, was as effective in suppressing crop muscle contraction as benzethonium chloride, which is a reported agonist of dromyosuppressin. PMID:24205919\n\nThe chemosensitivity of labellar sugar receptor in female Phormia regina is paralleled with ovary maturation: Effects of serotonin.\n\nPubMed\n\nSolari, Paolo; Stoffolano, John G; De Rose, Francescaelena; Barbarossa, Iole Tomassini; Liscia, Anna\n\n2015-11-01\n\nOogenesis in most adult insects is a nutrient-dependent process involving ingestion of both proteins and carbohydrates that ultimately depends on peripheral input from chemoreceptors. The main goal of this study was to characterize, in the female blowfly Phormia regina, the responsive changes of the labellar chemoreceptors to carbohydrates and proteins in relation to four different stages along the ovarian cycle: (1) immature ovaries, (2) mid-mature ovaries, (3) mature ovaries and ready for egg-laying and (4) post egg-laying ovaries. Then, the possible effects exerted by exogenous serotonin on the chemoreceptor sensitivity profiles were investigated. Our results show that ovary length, width and contraction rate progressively increase from stage 1 to 3, when all these parameters reach their maximum values, before declining in the next stage 4. The sensitivity of the labellar \"sugar\" chemoreceptors to both sucrose and proteins varies during the ovarian maturation stages, reaching a minimum for sucrose in stage 3, while that to proteins begins. Exogenous 5-HT supply specifically increases the chemoreceptor sensitivity to sugar at the stages 3 and 4, while it does not affect that to proteins. In conclusion, our results provide evidence that in female blowflies the cyclic variations in the sensitivity of the labellar chemosensilla to sugars and proteins are time-related to ovarian development and that during the stages 3 and 4 the responsiveness of the sugar cell to sucrose is under serotonergic control.

Many of these applications focus on the use of blowflies given their predicable life history characteristics in their larval stages. Molecular tools have become increasingly important in the unambiguous identification of larval blowfly species, however, these same tools have the potential to broaden the array of molecular applications in forensic entomology to include individual identifications and population assignments. Herein, we establish a microsatellite profiling system for the blowfly, Phormiaregina (Diptera: Calliphoridae). The goal being to create a system to identify the population genetic structure of this species and subsequently establish if these data are amenable to identifying corpse movements based on the geographic distribution of specific genetic clusters of blowflies. Using next generation sequencing technology, we screened a partial genomic DNA sequence library of P.regina, searching for di-, tetra-, and penta-nucleotide microsatellite loci. We identified and developed primers for 84 highly repetitive segments of DNA, of which 14 revealed consistent genotypes and reasonable levels of genetic variation (4-26 alleles/locus; heterozygosity ranged from 0.385 to 0.909). This study provides the first step in assessing the utility of microsatellite markers to track the movements and sources of corpses via blowflies. Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Because forensic insect specimens are morphologically uniform and are obtained at various developmental stages, DNA markers are greatly needed. To develop new autosomal DNA markers to identify species, partial genomic sequences of the bicoid (bcd) genes, containing the homeobox and its flanking sequences, from 12 blowfly species (Aldrichina grahami, Calliphora vicina, Calliphora lata, Triceratopyga calliphoroides, Chrysomya megacephala, Chrysomya pinguis, Phormia regina, Lucilia ampullacea, Lucilia caesar, Lucilia illustris, Hemipyrellia ligurriens and Lucilia sericata; Calliphoridae: Diptera) were determined and analyzed. This study first sequenced the ten blowfly species other than C. vicina and L. sericata. Based on the bcd sequences of these 12 blowfly species, a phylogenetic tree was constructed that discriminates the subfamilies of Calliphoridae (Luciliinae, Chrysomyinae, and Calliphorinae) and most blowfly species. Even partial genomic sequences of about 500âbp can distinguish most blowfly species. The short intron 2 and coding sequences downstream of the bcd homeobox in exon 3 could be utilized to develop DNA markers for forensic applications. These gene sequences are important in the evolution of insect developmental biology and are potentially useful for identifying insect species in forensic science. PMID:23586044\n\nRegulatory mechanisms and the role of calcium and potassium channels controlling supercontractile crop muscles in adult Phormia regina.\n\nPubMed\n\nSolari, Paolo; Stoffolano, John G; Fitzpatrick, Joanna; Gelperin, Alan; Thomson, Alan; Talani, Giuseppe; Sanna, Enrico; Liscia, Anna\n\n2013-09-01\n\nBioassays and electrophysiological recordings were conducted in the adult blowfly Phormia regina to provide new insights into the regulatory mechanisms governing the crop filling and emptying processes of the supercontractile crop muscles. The cibarial pump drives ingestion. Simultaneous multisite extracellular recordings show that crop lobe (P5) distension during ingestion of a 4.7 Î¼l sugar meal does not require muscle activity by any of the other pumps of the system. Conversely, pumping of fluids toward the anterior of the crop system during crop emptying is brought about by active muscle contraction, in the form of a highly coordinated peristaltic wave starting from P5 and progressively propagating to P6, P4 and P3 pumps, with P5 contracting with a frequency about 3.4 times higher than the other pumps. The crop contraction rate is also modulated by hemolymph-borne factors such as sugars, through ligand recognition at a presumptive receptor site rather than by an osmotic effect, as assessed by both behavioural and electrophysiological experiments. In this respect, sugars of equal osmolarity produce different effects, glucose being inhibitory and mannose ineffective for crop muscles, while trehalose enhances crop activity. Finally, voltage and current clamp experiments show that the muscle action potentials (mAPs) at the P4 pump are sustained by a serotonin-sensitive calcium conductance. Serotonin enhances calcium entry into the muscle cells and this could lead, as an indirect modulatory effect, to activation of a Ca(2+)-activated K(+) conductance (IK(Ca)), which sustains the following mAP repolarization phase in such a way that further mAPs can be generated early and the frequency consequently increased.

Insect samples were collected from the carcasses of ethanol-treated and untreated pigs for 10 d postmortem during two successional studies. In total, 32 insect taxa were collected during the two studies, with 29 and 27 taxa observed on the carcasses of ethanol-treated and untreated pigs, respectively. The earliest arrivers to both carcass types were dipterans. This group was represented by six families, with P. regina and Phaenicia coeruleiviridis (Macquart) being the most common calliphorids. Beetles in six families were collected on the carcasses of ethanol-treated pigs, but only three of the families were collected on carcasses of the untreated pigs. Permutation analyses to test the null hypothesis of no similarity between successional patterns of insect taxa from carcasses of ethanol-treated and untreated pigs showed that the successional patterns were similar between carcass types in the first (P = 0.003) and the second (P = 0.01) studies. The results of the development study of P. regina maggots in the field show that there was a significant difference between the distributions of length for maggots reared on loin tissue from ethanol-treated and untreated pigs. Maggots that fed on tissue from ethanol-treated pigs took approximately 11.9 h longer to reach the pupal stage than maggots that fed on tissue from untreated pigs. The longer developmental time for maggots on tissue from ethanol-treated pigs was due mainly to the longer postfeeding period of the third instar.\n\nOLFACTORY STIMULATION OF BLOWFLIES BY HOMOLOGOUS ALCOHOLS\n\nPubMed Central\n\nDethier, V. G.; Yost, M. T.\n\n1952-01-01\n\nThe response of the blowfly Phormia regina to stimulation by alcohols in the vapor phase has been investigated by means of an olfactometer which permitted quantitative control of stimulus concentration. The median rejection threshold was selected as a criterion of response. As was true in the case of contact chemoreception, the distribution of thresholds in the fly population is normal with respect to the logarithm of concentration. In terms of molar concentration the alcohols are rejected at logarithmically decreasing concentration as chain length is increased. Beyond decanol there is no further stimulation. When thresholds are expressed as pressures and plotted against saturated vapor pressures on logarithmic coordinates, the data fit a line the slope of which is not significantly different from 1; i.e., the thresholds vary directly with vapor pressure. Individual threshold values, however, deviate significantly from this line. and the deviation must be ascribed to other factors which have not as yet been identified. When thresholds are expressed as activities, all alcohols are equally stimulating. It appears that the limiting process of olfaction, at least in so far as the normal alcohols are concerned, may involve an equilibrium process. Conformity to this concept is most exact for intermediate members of the series. PMID:14938521\n\nMultiple pathways from three types of sugar receptor sites to metabotropic transduction pathways of the blowfly: study by the whole cell-clamp experiments.\n\nPubMed\n\nKan, Hideko; Kataoka-Shirasugi, Naoko; Amakawa, Taisaku\n\n2011-09-01\n\nMultiple pathways from three types of multiple receptor sites to three types of metabotropic signal transduction pathways were investigated in the whole cell-clamp experiments using isolated labellar sugar receptor neurons (cells) of the adult blowfly, Phormia regina. First, the concentration-response curves of three types of sweet taste components specialized to multiple receptor sites were obtained: sucrose for the pyranose sites (P-sites), fructose for the furanose sites (F-sites), and l-valine for the alkyl sites (R-sites). Next, the effects of inhibitors such as 2', 5'-dideoxyadenosine on adenylyl cyclase in the cAMP pathway, LY 83583 on guanylyl cyclase in the cGMP pathway, and U-73122 on phospholipase C in the IPâ pathway were examined. The results showed that all of the inhibitors affected each specific target in the second-messenger transduction pathways. The obtained results verified that the P-site corresponded to the cAMP, the F-site to the cGMP, and the R-site to the IPâ transduction pathway, and that these three signal pathways did not have crossing points.

G.\n\n1949-01-01\n\nRejection of eight aldehydes, eight ketones, five secondary alcohols, and 3-pentanol has been studied in the blowfly Phormia regina Meigen. The data agree with results previously reported for normal alcohols and several series of glycols in showing a logarithmic increase in stimulating effect with increasing chain length. The order of increasing effectiveness among the different species of compounds thus far investigated is the following: polyglycols, diols, secondary alcohols, iso-alcohols, normal alcohols, ketones, iso-aldehydes, normal aldehydes. Curves relating the logarithms of threshold concentration to the logarithms of chain length for diols, alcohols, aldehydes, and ketones show inflections in the 3 to 6 carbon range. Above and below the region of inflection the curves are nearly rectilinear. The slopes for the upper limbs (smaller molecules) are of the order of â2; for the lower limbs, about â10. Comparisons of the threshold data with numerical values for molecular weights, molecular areas and volumes, oil-water distribution coefficients, activity coefficients, standard free energies, vapor pressures, boiling points, melting points, dipole moments, dielectric constants, and degree of association are discussed briefly, and it is concluded that none of the comparisons serves to bring the data from the several series and from the two portions of each series into a single homogeneous system. A qualitative comparison with water solubilities shows fewer discrepancies. It is suggested that the existence of a combination of aqueous and lipoid phases at the receptor surface would fit best with what is presently known about the relationship between chemical structure and stimulating effect in contact chemoreception. In this hypothesis the smaller and more highly water-soluble compounds are envisaged as gaining access to the receptors partly through the aqueous phase, the larger molecules predominantly through the lipoid phase. PMID:18114559\n\nOptimization of total vaporization solid-phase microextraction (TV-SPME) for the determination of lipid profiles of Phormia regina, a forensically important blow fly species.\n\nPubMed\n\nKranz, William; Carroll, Clinton; Dixon, Darren; Picard, Christine; Goodpaster, John\n\n2017-11-01\n\nA new method has been developed for the determination of fatty acids, sterols, and other lipids which naturally occur within pupae of the blow fly Phormia regina. The method relies upon liquid extraction in non-polar solvent, followed by derivatization using N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA) w/ 1% trimethylchlorsilane (TMCS) carried out inside the sample vial. The analysis is facilitated by total vaporization solid-phase microextraction (TV-SPME), with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) serving as the instrumentation for analysis. The TV-SPME delivery technique is approximately a factor of five more sensitive than traditional liquid injection, which may alleviate the need for rotary evaporation, reconstitution, collection of high performance liquid chromatography fractions, and many of the other pre-concentration steps that are commonplace in the current literature. Furthermore, the ability to derivatize the liquid extract in a single easy step while increasing sensitivity represents an improvement over current derivatization methods. The most common lipids identified in fly pupae were various saturated and unsaturated fatty acids ranging from lauric acid (12:0) to arachinoic acid (20:4), as well as cholesterol. The concentrations of myristic acid (14:0), palmitelaidic acid (16:2), and palmitoleic acid (16:1) were the most reliable indicators of the age of the pupae. Graphical abstract Blow fly pupae were extracted prior to emerging as adults. The extracts were analyzed via total vaporization solid-phase microextraction (TV-SPME), revealing a complex mixture of lipids that could be associated with the age of the insect. This information may assist in determining a post-mortum interval (PMI) in a death investigation.\n\nA putative octopamine/tyramine receptor mediating appetite in a hungry fly\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nIshida, Yuko; Ozaki, Mamiko\n\n2011-07-01\n\nIn the blowfly Phormia regina, experience of simultaneous feeding with d-limonene exposure inhibits proboscis extension reflex (PER) due to decreased tyramine (TA) titer in the brain. To elucidate the molecular mechanism of TA signaling pathway related to the associated feeding behavior, we cloned cDNA encoding the octopamine/TA receptor (PregOAR/TAR). The deduced protein is composed of 607 amino acid residues and has 7 predicted transmembrane domains. Based on homology and phylogenetic analyses, this protein belongs to the OAR/TAR family. The PregOAR/TAR was mainly expressed in head, with low levels of expression in other tissues at adult stages. Gene expression profile is in agreement with a plethora of functions ascribed to TA in various insect tissues. The immunolabeled cell bodies and processes were localized in the medial protocerebrum, outer layer of lobula, antennal lobe, and subesophageal ganglion. These results suggest that decrease of TA level in the brain likely affects neurons expressing PregOAR/TAR, causing mediation of the sensitivity in the sensillum and/or output of motor neurons for PER.\n\nA 454 sequencing approach to dipteran mitochondrial genome research\n\nUSDA-ARS?s Scientific Manuscript database\n\nThe availability of complete mitochondrial genome data for Diptera, one of the largest Metazoan orders, in public databases is limited.

Bioassays were performed to test the entomopathogenic capacity of dauer and L2 and L3 (combined) larval stages. Furthermore, we determined the diversity of bacteria from laboratory nematodes cultivated for 2Â years (dauer and L2-L3 larvae) and from field nematodes (dauer and L2-L3 larvae) in addition to the virulence in Galleria mellonella larvae of some bacterial species from both laboratory and field nematodes. Dauer and non-dauer larvae of R. regina killed G. mellonella. Bacteria such as Serratia sp. (isolated from field nematodes) and Klebsiella sp. (isolated from larvae of laboratory and field nematodes) may explain R. regina entomopathogenic capabilities. Different bacteria were found in nematodes after subculturing in the laboratory suggesting that R. regina may acquire bacteria in different environments. However, there were some consistently found bacteria from laboratory and field nematodes such as Pseudochrobactrum sp., Comamonas sp., Alcaligenes sp., Klebsiella sp., Acinetobacter sp., and Leucobacter sp. that may constitute the nematode microbiome. Results showed thatÂ some bacteria contributing to entomopathogenicity may be lost in the laboratory representing a disadvantage when nematodes are cultivated to be used for biological control.\n\nNocturnal colonization behavior of blowflies (Diptera: Calliphoridae) in southeastern Australia.\n\nPubMed\n\nGeorge, Kelly A; Archer, Melanie S; Toop, Tes\n\n2013-01-01\n\nWorldwide research into nocturnal colonization by blowflies has produced many contradictory findings, prompting investigation specific to southeastern Australia. Initial experiments showed that blowfly colonization begins shortly after sunrise and continues until sunset; nocturnal colonization never occurred. Colonization peaks occurred at mid-morning, midday, and in the hours preceding sunset. In an additional experiment, wild blowflies were captured and placed in cages with colonization medium supplied nocturnally. Colonization occurred on four of five nights, and Calliphora augur (Fabricius) (Diptera: Calliphoridae) was the main species colonizing baits nocturnally. Results suggest that colonization is most likely to occur during warm weather and when flies are able to walk or crawl to bait. In particular, blowflies trapped within a confined space (such as a room or car) with warmer-than-ambient temperature may be stimulated to colonize nearby remains. Entomologists should consider these findings when estimating minimum postmortem interval under these environmental conditions. Â© 2012 American Academy of Forensic Sciences.\n\nSpecies identification of adult African blowflies (Diptera: Calliphoridae) of forensic importance.\n\nPubMed\n\nLutz, Lena; Williams, Kirstin A; Villet, Martin H; Ekanem, Mfon; Szpila, Krzysztof\n\n2018-05-01\n\nNecrophagous blowflies can provide an excellent source of evidence for forensic entomologists and are also relevant to problems in public health, medicine, and animal health. However, access to useful information about these blowflies is constrained by the need to correctly identify the flies, and the poor availability of reliable, accessible identification tools is a serious obstacle to the development of forensic entomology in the majority of African countries. In response to this need, a high-quality key to the adults of all species of forensically relevant blowflies of Africa has been prepared, drawing on high-quality entomological materials and modern focus-stacking photomicroscopy. This new key can be easily applied by investigators inexperienced in the taxonomy of blowflies and is made available through a highly accessible online platform. Problematic diagnostic characters used in previous keys are discussed.\n\nField calibration of blowfly-derived DNA against traditional methods for assessing mammal diversity in tropical forests.\n\nPubMed\n\nLee, Ping-Shin; Gan, Han Ming; Clements, Gopalasamy Reuben; Wilson, John-James\n\n2016-11-01\n\nMammal diversity assessments based on DNA derived from invertebrates have been suggested as alternatives to assessments based on traditional methods; however, no study has field-tested both approaches simultaneously. In Peninsular Malaysia, we calibrated the performance of mammal DNA derived from blowflies (Diptera: Calliphoridae) against traditional methods used to detect species. We first compared five methods (cage trapping, mist netting, hair trapping, scat collection, and blowfly-derived DNA) in a forest reserve with no recent reports of megafauna. Blowfly-derived DNA and mist netting detected the joint highest number of species (n = 6). Only one species was detected by multiple methods. Compared to the other methods, blowfly-derived DNA detected both volant and non-volant species. In another forest reserve, rich in megafauna, we calibrated blowfly-derived DNA against camera traps. Blowfly-derived DNA detected more species (n = 11) than camera traps (n = 9), with only one species detected by both methods. The rarefaction curve indicated that blowfly-derived DNA would continue to detect more species with greater sampling effort. With further calibration, blowfly-derived DNA may join the list of traditional field methods. Areas for further investigation include blowfly feeding and dispersal biology, primer biases, and the assembly of a comprehensive and taxonomically-consistent DNA barcode reference library.\n\nTHE STIMULATING EFFECT OF GLYCOLS AND THEIR POLYMERS ON THE TARSAL RECEPTORS OF BLOWFLIES\n\nPubMed Central\n\nDethier, V. G.; Chadwick, L. E.\n\n1948-01-01\n\nThe rejection thresholds of Phormia regina Meigen for twenty-four glycols have been determined. A definite relationship between the concentration of the test material and the distribution of thresholds has been noted regularly in samples of flies selected at random from a population of known age which had been reared under standard conditions. The scattering of thresholds is normal with respect to the logarithm of concentration. Recalculation of the data of other workers reveals the same sort of relationship with other species of insects and the minnow Phoxinus. The underlying reason for the phenomenon is not known. The glycols in common with other series of homologous alipbatic compounds are rejected at logarithmically decreasing concentrations as the chain length is increased. In general the straight chain diols are more stimulating than the corresponding polyethylene and polypropylene glycols. This difference is related in some manner to the presence of ether linkages in the latter. Polypropylene glycols, with chains of three carbon atoms between the ether linkages are more stimulating than polyethylene glycols, where the spacing is âOâCâCâOâ. Unipolymers are more stimulating than mixtures of homologues with the same average molecular weights. Polyethylene glycol 1540 is the largest molecule of measured molecular weight known to stimulate chemoreceptors. The introduction of a second terminal hydroxyl group into the straight hydrocarbon chain reduces the stimulating effect.

It appears to have renewed interest as a model for studies on the role of water channels, namely aquaporins or aquaglyceroporins, in water detection. To this end, we investigated the presence of water channels, their role in \"water\" and \"salt\" cell responsiveness and the transduction mechanism involved. For the first time our electrophysiological results point to the presence of an aquaglyceroporin in the chemoreceptor membrane of the \"water\" cell in the blowfly taste chemosensilla whose transduction mechanism ultimately involves an intracellular calcium increase and consequently cell depolarization. This hypothesis is also supported by calcium imaging data following proper stimulation. This mechanism is triggered by \"water\" cell stimulation with hypotonic solutions and/or solutes such as glycerol which crosses the membrane by way of aquaglyceroporins. Behavioral output indicates that the \"sense\" of water in blowflies is definitely not dependent on the \"water\" cell only, but also on the \"salt\" cell sensitivity. These findings also hypothesize a new role for aquaglyceroporin in spiking cell excitability. Copyright Â© 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

By investigating antigenic similarity and dissimilarity between the first instar larval stages of four forensically important blowfly species, we have been able to identify immunoreactive proteins of potential use in the development of species-specific immuno-diagnostic tests. Here we outline our protein-based approach to species determination, and describe how it may be adapted to develop rapid diagnostic assays for the 'on-site' identification of blowfly species.\n\nFirst Record of the Larval Endoparasitoid Tachinaephagus zealandicus (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae) From Fly Hosts Developing on Burnt Remains and in Pennsylvania.\n\nPubMed\n\nRivers, David B\n\n2016-05-01\n\nAdults of the gregarious larval endoparasitoid Tachinaephagus zealandicus Ashmead (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae) were collected from two species of carrion-inhabiting flies, Phormia regina Meigen (Diptera: Calliphoridae) and Hydrotaea aenescens Wiedemann (Muscidae), associated with the burnt remains of a domesticated pig, Sus scrofa L. (Artiodactyla: Suidae), during late summer in south central Pennsylvania. This represents the first reported occurrence of the wasp in the state and only the second in the mid-Atlantic region. Collection from P. regina is a new host record for T. zealandicus and also the first for this parasitoid being attracted to flies on burnt remains. Â© The Authors 2016.

In Great Britain (GB), Lucilia sericata is the primary causative species. Despite its severity, there has been minimal investigatory work into the disease in rabbits. Here we used text mining to screen electronic health records (EHRs) from a large sentinel network of 389 veterinary practices in GB between March 2014 and April 2017 for confirmed cases of blowfly strike in rabbits. Blowfly strike was identified in 243 of 42,226 rabbit consultations (0.6%), affecting 205 individual rabbits. The anatomical site of recorded blowfly strike lesions was overwhelmingly the perineal area (nâ¯=â¯109, 52.4%). Less commonly lesions were observed affecting other areas of the body (nâ¯=â¯9, 4.3%) and head (nâ¯=â¯8, 3.8%); in 83 consultations (39.9%), the affected area was not specified. Of the rabbits presenting with blowfly strike, 44.7% were recorded as being euthanized or died. A case control study was used to identify risk factors for blowfly strike in this population. Whilst sex and neuter status in isolation were not significantly associated with blowfly strike, entire female rabbits showed a 3.3 times greater odds of being a case than neutered female rabbits. Rabbits five years of age and over were more than 3.8 times likely to present for blowfly strike. For every 1â¯Â°C rise in environmental temperature between 4.67â¯Â°C and 17.68â¯Â°C, there was a 33% increase risk of blowfly strike, with cases peaking in July or August. Overall blowfly strike cases started earlier and peaked higher in the south of Great Britain. The most northerly latitude studied was at lower risk of blowfly strike than the most southerly (ORâ¯=â¯0.50, pâ¯<â¯0.001). There appeared to be no significant relationship between blowfly strike in rabbits and either the sheep density or rural and urban land coverage types. The results presented here can be used for targeted health messaging to reduce the impact of this\n\nThe blowflies of the Madeira Archipelago: species diversity, distribution and identification (Diptera, Calliphoridae s. l.)\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPrado e Castro, Catarina; Szpila, Krzysztof; MartÃ­nez-SÃ¡nchez, Anabel; Rego; Silva, Isamberto; Serrano, Artur R.M.; Boieiro, MÃ¡rio\n\n2016-01-01\n\nAbstract Knowledge on the taxonomic diversity and distribution of blowflies from the Madeira Archipelago is updated. New and interesting findings are reported for poorly studied islands and islets of this archipelago, together with a brief analysis of the diversity of Macaronesian Calliphoridae s. l. Seven blowfly species were collected during this study, including the first records of Calliphora vicina Robineau-Desvoidy, 1830, Chrysomya albiceps (Wiedemann, 1819), Lucilia sericata (Meigen, 1826), Pollenia rudis (Fabricius, 1794) and Stomorhina lunata (Fabricius, 1805) from Porto Santo, and of Calliphora vicina, Lucilia sericata and Stomorhina lunata from Desertas Islands. The presence of Calliphora loewi Enderlein, 1903 in Madeira Laurisilva forest is discussed and its first instar larva is redescribed, revealing important differences in relation to its original description. An identification key to the adult Madeiran blowflies is provided for the first time.

Evaporation can occur from humid body surfaces or from fluids interfaced to the environment through a number of different mechanisms, such as sweating or panting. In Diptera, some flies move tidally a droplet of fluid out and then back in the buccopharyngeal cavity for a repeated number of cycles before eventually ingesting it. This is referred to as the bubbling behaviour. The droplet fluid consists of a mix of liquids from the ingested food, enzymes from the salivary glands, and antimicrobials, associated to the crop organ system, with evidence pointing to a role in liquid meal dehydration. Herein, we demonstrate that the bubbling behaviour also serves as an effective thermoregulatory mechanism to lower body temperature by means of evaporative cooling. In the blowfly, Chrysomya megacephala, infrared imaging revealed that as the droplet is extruded, evaporation lowers the fluidÂ´s temperature, which, upon its re-ingestion, lowers the blowfly's body temperature. This effect is most prominent at the cephalic region, less in the thorax, and then in the abdomen. Bubbling frequency increases with ambient temperature, while its cooling efficiency decreases at high air humidities. Heat transfer calculations show that droplet cooling depends on a special heat-exchange dynamic, which result in the exponential activation of the cooling effect.\n\nThe microbiomes of blowflies and houseflies as bacterial transmission reservoirs.\n\nPubMed\n\nJunqueira, Ana Carolina M; Ratan, Aakrosh; Acerbi, Enzo; Drautz-Moses, Daniela I; Premkrishnan, Balakrishnan N V; Costea, Paul I; Linz, Bodo; Purbojati, Rikky W; Paulo, Daniel F; Gaultier, Nicolas E; Subramanian, Poorani; Hasan, Nur A; Colwell, Rita R; Bork, Peer; Azeredo-Espin, Ana Maria L; Bryant, Donald A; Schuster, Stephan C\n\n2017-11-24\n\nBlowflies and houseflies are mechanical vectors inhabiting synanthropic environments around the world. They feed and breed in fecal and decaying organic matter, but the microbiome they harbour and transport is largely uncharacterized. We sampled 116 individual houseflies and blowflies from varying habitats on three continents and subjected them to high-coverage, whole-genome shotgun sequencing. This allowed for genomic and metagenomic analyses of the host-associated microbiome at the species level. Both fly host species segregate based on principal coordinate analysis of their microbial communities, but they also show an overlapping core microbiome. Legs and wings displayed the largest microbial diversity and were shown to be an important route for microbial dispersion. The environmental sequencing approach presented here detected a stochastic distribution of human pathogens, such as Helicobacter pylori, thereby demonstrating the potential of flies as proxies for environmental and public health surveillance.\n\nHigh innate attractiveness to black targets in the blue blowfly, Calliphora vomitoria (L.) (Diptera: Calliphoridae).\n\nPubMed\n\nBenelli, Giovanni; Otranto, Domenico; Caselli, Alice; Romano, Donato; Remorini, Damiano; Di Giuseppe, Graziano; Stefanini, Cesare; Mele, Marcello; Canale, Angelo\n\n2018-06-01\n\nCalliphora vomitoria is a myiasis-causing fly in many animal species including humans. The control of blowflies is still anchored on the use of chemicals. However, mass trapping and lure-and-kill techniques represent a promising alternative to pesticides. Visual and olfactory cues are the main stimuli routing the fly's landing behavior. Notably, color attractiveness has been barely explored in flies of medical and veterinary importance, with special reference to blowflies. In this study, we investigated the innate color preferences in C. vomitoria adults, testing binary combinations of painted targets under laboratory conditions. The identity of tested species C. vomitoria was confirmed by DNA sequencing (18S and cox1 genes). C. vomitoria flies showed a significant preference for black colored targets in all tested binary color combinations, after 5, 15, 30 and 60â¯min of exposure. Black targets were significantly preferred over blue, red, yellow and white ones. Spectral characteristics of all tested color combinations were quantified and the innate attraction of blowflies towards black targets was discussed in relation to their behavioral ecology. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on innate color preferences in the Calliphora genus. Our findings can be useful to develop new, cheap and reliable monitoring traps as well as \"lure and kill\" tools to control blowfly pests. Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.

However, apart from some highly effective drugs it could be argued that no new control methodologies have resulted. This review addresses the major areas of sheep blowfly research over this period describing the significant outcomes and analyses, and what is still required to produce new commercial control technologies. The use of drugs against this fly species has been very successful but resistance has developed to almost all current compounds. Integrated pest management is becoming basic to control, especially in the absence of mulesing, and has clearly benefited from computer-aided technologies. Biological control has more challenges but natural and perhaps transformed biopesticides offer possibilities for the future. Experimental vaccines have been developed but require further analysis of antigens and formulations to boost protection. Genetic technologies may provide potential for long-term control through more rapid indirect selection of sheep less prone to flystrike. Finally in the future, genetic analysis of the fly may allow suppression and perhaps eradication of blowfly populations or identification of new and more viable targets for drug and vaccine intervention. Clearly all these areas of research offer potential new controls but commercial development is perhaps inhibited by the success of current chemical insecticides and certainly requires a significant additional injection of resources.

Here, we present an inventory of the blowfly species associated with the stages of decomposition of pig carcasses in a caatinga area during dry and rainy seasons. The study took place at the Private Reserve for the Environmental Inheritance \"Fazenda Almas,\" state of ParaÃ­ba, Brazil. Using a modified version of the Shannon trap, 32,909 adult specimens belonging to eight species were captured. During the dry season, Cochliomyia macellaria (Fabricius) (52.2%) and Chrysomya albiceps (Wiedemann) (39.9%) were the most abundant species. In the rainy season, when the majority of individuals were captured (93.7%), Chloroprocta idioidea (Robineau-Desvoidy) (71.1%) was the most abundant. Five decomposition stages were recognized, being the active decay the most attractive to colonization by blowflies, except for Lucilia eximia (Wiedemann), which was more abundant in the bloated stage.\n\nA review of postfeeding larval dispersal in blowflies: implications for forensic entomology\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGomes, Leonardo; Godoy, Wesley Augusto Conde; von Zuben, Claudio JosÃ©\n\n2006-05-01\n\nImmature and adult stages of blowflies are one of the primary invertebrate consumers of decomposing animal organic matter. When the food supply is consumed or when the larvae complete their development and migrate prior to the total removal of the larval substrate, they disperse to find adequate places for pupation, a process known as postfeeding larval dispersal. Several important ecological and physiological aspects of this process were studied since the work by Green (Ann Appl Biol 38:475, 1951) 50 years ago. An understanding of postfeeding larval dispersal can be useful for determining the postmortem interval (PMI) of human cadavers in legal medicine, particularly because this interval may be underestimated if older dispersing larvae or those that disperse longer, faster, and deeper are not taken into account. In this article, we review the process of postfeeding larval dispersal and its implications for legal medicine, in particular showing that aspects such as burial behavior and competition among species of blowflies can influence this process and consequently, the estimation of PMI.\n\nTHE SURVIVAL OF POLIOMYELITIS AND COXSACKIE VIRUSES FOLLOWING THEIR INGESTION BY FLIES\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMelnick, Joseph L.; Penner, Lawrence R.\n\n1952-01-01\n\nPoliomyelitis virus and Coxsackie (or C) virus were quantitatively fed to blowflies, Phormia regina and Phaenicia sericata, and to houseflies, Musca domestica. Naturally infectious human stools were the source of virus. Poliomyelitis virus can be almost quantitatively recovered from flies and from their excreta collected over a period of several days following the feeding. C virus can also be recovered but in lesser yields. No conclusive evidence for virus multiplication in these laboratory-bred insects was obtained. Poliomyelitis virus from human sources could be detected in flies between the 5th and 17th day and in the excreta between the 4th and 10th day. Murine-adapted strains of poliomyelitis virus and murine encephalomyelitis virus could not be detected beyond the 5th day, even though comparable amounts of virus were fed. The persistence of C virus excretion (2 to 12 days) varied directly with the amount of virus fed. Poliomyelitis virus, as present in human stools, survived drying and storage at room temperature for at least 3 days and at 4Â° for 3 weeks. C virus from human stools under the same circumstances was detected for 15 days at room temperature (with marked drop in titer after the 3rd day) and for 21 days at 4Â° with little loss in titer. When stool samples were fed to flies and the dried excreta of the insects examined, it was found that (a) poliomyelitis virus persisted for at least 1 to 2 days at room temperature and for 3 to 4 days at 4Â°, and (b) C virus persisted for 1 day at room temperature and for 5 days at 4Â°. Poliomyelitis virus could be carried through only two serial passages in adult flies. Flies emerging from maggots fed virus were free from the agent.

Contrary to initial predictions that the disease would either die out due to the high virulence of the virus strain or spread rapidly in westerly direction, the infection became endemic and spread slowly. The unexpected disease epidemiology led to the hypothesis that hitherto unconsidered factors might contribute to virus persistence and dispersal. To check whether arthropod species feeding and developing on infected carcasses might be involved, larvae of two commonly found blowfly species, Lucilia sericata and Calliphora vicina, were experimentally bred on ASFV-infected spleen tissue. After different time intervals, developing larvae and pupae were tested for infectious virus and viral DNA. By qPCR, contamination of the blowfly larvae and pupae with ASFV-DNA could be demonstrated even after several washing steps, proving the uptake of virus during feeding in the larval stage. However, infectious virus could never be isolated. By contrast, the larvae appeared to have inactivated ASFV in the offered tissue, which might be explained by the known anti-biotic effect of salivary secretions. It is concluded that immature blowfly stages do not play a relevant role as reservoirs or mechanical vectors of ASFV.

The data presented provide a basis to define molecular markers, including the identification of highly informative intra-sequence regions, which may be of use in the identification of larvae for forensic entomology. Phylogenetic analysis of the sequences also provides new insights into the different evolutionary patterns apparent within the family Calliphoridae which, additionally, can provide a measure of the degree of genetic variation likely to be encountered within taxonomic groups of differing forensic utility.\n\nSeasonal Blowfly Distribution and Abundance in Fragmented Landscapes. Is It Useful in Forensic Inference about Where a Corpse Has Been Decaying?\n\nPubMed Central\n\nZabala, Jabi; DÃ­az, Beatriz; SaloÃ±a-Bordas, Marta I.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nBlowflies are insects of forensic interest as they may indicate characteristics of the environment where a body has been laying prior to the discovery. In order to estimate changes in community related to landscape and to assess if blowfly species can be used as indicators of the landscape where a corpse has been decaying, we studied the blowfly community and how it is affected by landscape in a 7,000 km2 region during a whole year. Using baited traps deployed monthly we collected 28,507 individuals of 10 calliphorid species, 7 of them well represented and distributed in the study area. Multiple Analysis of Variance found changes in abundance between seasons in the 7 analyzed species, and changes related to land use in 4 of them (Calliphora vomitoria, Lucilia ampullacea, L. caesar and L. illustris). Generalised Linear Model analyses of abundance of these species compared with landscape descriptors at different scales found only a clear significant relationship between summer abundance of C. vomitoria and distance to urban areas and degree of urbanisation. This relationship explained more deviance when considering the landscape composition at larger geographical scales (up to 2,500 m around sampling site). For the other species, no clear relationship between land uses and abundance was found, and therefore observed changes in their abundance patterns could be the result of other variables, probably small changes in temperature. Our results suggest that blowfly community composition cannot be used to infer in what kind of landscape a corpse has decayed, at least in highly fragmented habitats, the only exception being the summer abundance of C. vomitoria.

Seven species of Calliphoridae were collected: Lucilia coeruleiviridis (=Phoenicia) (Macquart), Cochliomyia macellaria (F.), Chrysomya rufifaces (Macquart), Phormia regina (Meigen), Chrysomya megacephala (F.), and a few specimens of Calliphora livida Hall, and Calliphora vicina Robineau-Desvoidy. Species composition in aerial collections of adult flies, preserved larval collections, and samples of larvae reared to the adult stage were all highly correlated. Relative abundance of the species found was significantly different, with L. coeruleiviridis the most abundant species year-round. The relative abundance of the collected species varied significantly by day of decomposition and by season, with significant interactions between season and day, season and species, and day and species. L. coeruleiviridis, C. macellaria, C. rufifaces, and P. regina were found during the entire year, two C. vicina specimens and 11 C. livida specimens were collected from December to March, whereas C. megacephala was collected only from June through September. ?? 2007 Entomological Society of America.\n\nGenetic Diversity and Phylogenetic Relationships of Coevolving Symbiont-Harboring Insect Trypanosomatids, and Their Neotropical Dispersal by Invader African Blowflies (Calliphoridae)\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBorghesan, Tarcilla C.; Campaner, Marta; Matsumoto, Tania E.; Espinosa, Omar A.; Razafindranaivo, Victor; Paiva, Fernando; Carranza, Julio C.; AÃ±ez, Nestor; Neves, Luis; Teixeira, Marta M. G.; Camargo, Erney P.\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThis study is about the inter- and intra-specific genetic diversity of trypanosomatids of the genus Angomonas, and their association with Calliphoridae (blowflies) in Neotropical and Afrotropical regions. Microscopic examination of 3,900 flies of various families, mostly Calliphoridae, revealed that 31% of them harbored trypanosomatids. Small subunit rRNA (SSU rRNA) barcoding showed that Angomonas predominated (46%) over the other common trypanosomatids of blowflies of genera Herpetomonas and Wallacemonas. Among Angomonas spp., A. deanei was much more common than the two-other species, A. desouzai and A. ambiguus. Phylogenetic analyses based on SSU rRNA, glycosomal glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gGAPDH) and internal transcribed spacer rDNA (ITS rDNA) sequences revealed a marked genetic diversity within A. deanei, which comprised four infraspecific genotypes (Dea1âDea4), and four corresponding symbiont genotypes (Kcr1âKcr4). Host and symbiont phylogenies were highly congruent corroborating their co-divergence, consistent with host-symbiont interdependent metabolism and symbiont reduced genomes shaped by a long coevolutionary history. We compared the diversity of Angomonas/symbionts from three genera of blowflies, Lucilia, Chrysomya and Cochliomyia. A. deanei, A. desouzai, and A. ambiguus were found in the three genera of blowflies in South America. In Africa, A. deanei and A. ambiguus were identified in Chrysomya. The absence of A. desouzai in Africa and its presence in Neotropical Cochliomyia and Lucilia suggests parasite spillback of A. desouzai into Chrysomya, which was most likely introduced four decades ago from Africa into the Neotropic. The absence of correlation between parasite diversity and geographic and genetic distances, with identical genotypes of A. deanei found in the Neotropic and Afrotropic, is consistent with disjunct distribution due to the recent human-mediated transoceanic dispersal of Angomonas by Chrysomya.

Accurate age determination of puparia is usually accomplished by dissection, which means destructive sampling of evidence. As part of improving abilities to correctly identify species and developmental age, it is highly desirable to have available non-destructive methods. In this study, we acquired external hyperspectral imaging (HSI) data (77 spectral bands, 389-892Â nm) from the dorsal and ventral sides of individual puparia of two species of blowfly (Diptera: Calliphoridae), Calliphora dubia Macquart 1855 and Chrysomya rufifacies Macquart 1842. Puparia were dissected to determine the presence/absence of eight internal morphological development characteristics (legs, wings, labella, abdominal segments, antennae, thoracic bristles, orbital/facial bristles and eye colour and arista). Based on linear discriminant analysis and independent validation of HSI data, reflectance features from puparia could be used to successfully (1) distinguish the two species (classification accuracyâ=â92.5Â %), (2) differentiate dorsal and ventral sides of puparia (classification accuracy C. dubiaâ=â81.5Â %; Ch. rufifaciesâ=â89.2Â %) and (3) predict the presence of these morphological characteristics and therefore the developmental stage of puparia (average classification accuracy using dorsal imaging: C. dubiaâ=â90.3Â %; Ch. rufifaciesâ=â94.0Â %). The analytical approach presented here provides proof of concept for a direct puparial age relationship (i.e. days since the onset of pupation) between external puparial reflectance features and internal morphological development. Furthermore, this approach establishes the potential for further refinement by using a non-invasive technique to determine the age and developmental stage of blowflies of forensic importance.\n\nEffects of the essential oil constituent thymol and other neuroactive chemicals on flight motor activity and wing beat frequency in the blowfly Phaenicia sericata.\n\nPubMed\n\nWaliwitiya, Ranil; Belton, Peter; Nicholson, Russell A; Lowenberger, Carl A\n\n2010-03-01\n\nThe effects were evaluated of the plant terpenoid thymol and eight other neuroactive compounds on flight muscle impulses (FMIs) and wing beat frequency (WBF) of tethered blowflies (Phaenicia sericata Meig.). The electrical activity of the dorsolongitudinal flight muscles was closely linked to the WBF of control insects. Topically applied thymol inhibited WBF within 15-30 min and reduced FMI frequency. Octopamine and chlordimeform caused a similar, early-onset bursting pattern that decreased in amplitude with time. Desmethylchlordimeform blocked wing beating within 60 min and generated a profile of continuous but lower-frequency FMIs. Fipronil suppressed wing beating and induced a pattern of continuous, variable-frequency spiking that diminished gradually over 6 h. Cypermethrin- and rotenone-treated flies had initial strong FMIs that declined with time. In flies injected with GABA, the FMIs were generally unidirectional and frequency was reduced, as was seen with thymol. Thymol readily penetrates the cuticle and interferes with flight muscle and central nervous function in the blowfly. The similarity of the action of thymol and GABA suggests that this terpenoid acts centrally in blowflies by mimicking or facilitating GABA action.\n\nArtemisia spp. essential oils against the disease-carrying blowfly Calliphora vomitoria.\n\nPubMed\n\nBedini, Stefano; Flamini, Guido; Cosci, Francesca; Ascrizzi, Roberta; Echeverria, Maria Cristina; Guidi, Lucia; Landi, Marco; Lucchi, Andrea; Conti, Barbara\n\n2017-02-13\n\nSynanthropic flies play a considerable role in the transmission of pathogenic and non-pathogenic microorganisms. In this work, the essential oil (EO) of two aromatic plants, Artemisia annua and Artemisia dracunculus, were evaluated for their abilities to control the blowfly Calliphora vomitoria. Artemisia annua and A. dracunculus EOs were extracted, analysed and tested in laboratory bioassays. Besides, the physiology of EOs toxicity and the EOs antibacterial and antifungal properties were evaluated. Both Artemisia EOs deterred C. vomitoria oviposition on fresh beef meat. At 0.05Â Î¼lÂ cm -2 A. dracunculus EO completely inhibited C. vomitoria oviposition. Toxicity tests, by contact, showed LD 50 of 0.49 and 0.79Â Î¼l EO per fly for A. dracunculus and A. annua, respectively. By fumigation, LC 50 values were 49.55 and 88.09Â Î¼lÂ l -1 air for A. dracunculus and A. annua, respectively. EOs AChE inhibition in C. vomitoria (IC 50 â=â202.6 and 472.4Â mgÂ l -1 , respectively, for A. dracunculus and A. annua) indicated that insect neural sites are targeted by the EOs toxicity. Finally, the antibacterial and antifungal activities of the two Artemisia EOs may assist in the reduction of transmission of microbial infections/contaminations. Results suggest that Artemisia EOs could be of use in the control of C. vomitoria, a common vector of pathogenic microorganisms and agent of human and animal cutaneous myiasis. The prevention of pathogenic and parasitic infections is a priority for human and animal health. The Artemisia EOs could represent an eco-friendly, low-cost alternative to synthetic repellents and insecticides to fight synanthropic disease-carrying blowflies.\n\nSeasonal and habitat abundance and distribution of some forensically important blow flies (Diptera: Calliphoridae) in Central California.\n\nPubMed\n\nBrundage, Adrienne; Bros, Shannon; Honda, Jeffrey Y\n\n2011-10-10\n\nSeasonal and habitat calliphorid abundance and distribution were examined weekly for two years (2001-2003) in Santa Clara County, California, using sentinel traps baited with bovine liver. Of the 34,389 flies examined in three defined habitats (rural, urban, and riparian), 38% of the total catch represented Compsomyiops callipes (Bigot) and 23% represented Phormia regina (Meigen). Other flies collected in this survey included Calliphora vomitoria (Linnaeus), Calliphora latifrons (Hough), Lucilia sericata (Meigen), Lucilia cuprina (Wiedemann), and Lucilia mexicana (Macquart), which is a new record for the area. Multivariate MANOVA and ANOVA (P â¤ 0.05) analysis indicate significant seasonal habitat preference for all fly species examined. This information may be used to identify potentially forensically impo rtant fly species within Santa Clara County, California.

In order to characterize the signal-inducing 5-HT receptors, we cloned two cDNAs (Cv5-ht2Î±, Cv5-ht7) that share high similarity with mammalian 5-HT(2) and 5-HT(7) receptor genes, respectively. RT-PCR demonstrated that both receptors are expressed in the salivary glands and brain. Stimulation of Cv5-ht2Î±-transfected mammalian cells with 5-HT elevates cytosolic [Ca(2+)] in a dose-dependent manner (EC(50) = 24 nM). In Cv5-ht7-transfected cells, 5-HT produces a dose-dependent increase in [cAMP](i) (EC(50) = 4 nM). We studied the pharmacological profile for both receptors. Substances that appear to act as specific ligands of either Cv5-HT(2Î±) or Cv5-HT(7) in the heterologous expression system were also tested in intact blowfly salivary gland preparations. We observed that 5-methoxytryptamine (100 nM) activates only the Cv5-HT(2Î±) receptor, 5-carboxamidotryptamine (300 nM) activates only the Cv5-HT(7) receptor, and clozapine (1 ÂµM) antagonizes the effects of 5-HT via Cv5-HT(7) in blowfly salivary glands, providing means for the selective activation of each of the two 5-HT receptor subtypes. This study represents the first comprehensive molecular and pharmacological characterization of two 5-HT receptors in the blowfly and permits the analysis of the physiological role of these receptors, even when co-expressed in cells, and of the modes of interaction between the Ca(2+)- and cAMP-signalling cascades.\n\nRural origin, age, and endoparasite fecal prevalence in dogs surrendered to the Regina Humane Society, 2013\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSchurer, Janna M.; Hamblin, Brie; Davenport, Laura; Wagner, Brent; Jenkins, Emily J.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nWe report the results of fecal parasite surveillance in dogs surrendered to the Regina Humane Society, Saskatchewan, Canada, between May and November 2013.

She was born in 1718, and at the age of 14 she married an experienced, but significantly older, German Lutheran physician and ophthalmologist, Jakob Halpir. By helping him eagerly in his work, Pilsztynowa learned a great deal of her husband's way of treating cataracts and other ailments, and she ambitiously made use of the friendship and help of other physicians whom she met on her travels. Although there are some occurrences that could lead one to question aspects of Pilsztynowa's straight and honest character, one has also to point to her readiness to help where she could.\n\nMolecular and Pharmacological Characterization of Serotonin 5-HT2Î± and 5-HT7 Receptors in the Salivary Glands of the Blowfly Calliphora vicina\n\nPubMed Central\n\nRÃ¶ser, Claudia; Jordan, Nadine; Balfanz, Sabine; Baumann, Arnd; Walz, Bernd; Baumann, Otto; Blenau, Wolfgang\n\n2012-01-01\n\nSecretion in blowfly (Calliphora vicina) salivary glands is stimulated by the biogenic amine serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT), which activates both inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3)/Ca2+ and cyclic adenosine 3â²,5â²-monophosphate (cAMP) signalling pathways in the secretory cells.

Her core argument is that health care should resemble other retail markets, where unleashing consumer choice results in competition and innovations that improve value. In an often pitched debate, critics contend that health care is far too complicated for this model to work. Here Bob Galvin engages Herzlinger on these and other topics. Articulate, passionate, and sometimes controversial, Herzlinger is the Nancy R.

The present study investigates, in the labellar chemosensilla of the blowfly Protophormia terraenovae, the transduction mechanism by which saccharin evokes the response of the \"deterrent\" cell, with particular attention to the contribution of K(+) and Ca(2+) current and the role of cyclic nucleotides, since second messengers modulate Ca(2+), Cl(-) and K(+) currents to different extents. As assessed by extracellular single-sensillum recordings, our results show that the addition of a Ca(2+) chelator such as EGTA or the Ca(2+) current blockers SK&F-96365, Mibefradil, Nifedipine and W-7 decrease the response of the \"deterrent\" cell to saccharin. A similar decreasing effect was also obtained following the addition of 4-aminopyridine, a K(+) current blocker. On the contrary, the membrane-permeable cyclic nucleotide 8-bromoguanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (8Br-cGMP) activates this cell and shows an additive effect when presented mixed with saccharin. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that in the labellar chemosensilla of the blowfly both Ca(2+) and K(+) ions are involved in the transduction mechanism of the \"deterrent\" cell in response to saccharin. Our results also suggest a possible pathway common to saccharin and 8Br-cGMP.\n\nHybrid control of the Neimark-Sacker bifurcation in a delayed Nicholson's blowflies equation.\n\nPubMed\n\nWang, Yuanyuan; Wang, Lisha\n\nIn this article, for delayed Nicholson's blowflies equation, we propose a hybrid control nonstandard finite-difference (NSFD) scheme in which state feedback and parameter perturbation are used to control the Neimark-Sacker bifurcation. Firstly, the local stability of the positive equilibria for hybrid control delay differential equation is discussed according to Hopf bifurcation theory. Then, for any step-size, a hybrid control numerical algorithm is introduced to generate the Neimark-Sacker bifurcation at a desired point. Finally, numerical simulation results confirm that the control strategy is efficient in controlling the Neimark-Sacker bifurcation. At the same time, the results show that the NSFD control scheme is better than the Euler control method.\n\nArtificial Neural Networks: A Novel Approach to Analysing the Nutritional Ecology of a Blowfly Species, Chrysomya megacephala\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBianconi, AndrÃ©; Zuben, ClÃ¡udio J. Von; SerapiÃ£o, Adriane B. de S.; Govone, JosÃ© S.\n\n2010-01-01\n\nBionomic features of blowflies may be clarified and detailed by the deployment of appropriate modelling techniques such as artificial neural networks, which are mathematical tools widely applied to the resolution of complex biological problems. The principal aim of this work was to use three well-known neural networks, namely Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Radial Basis Function (RBF), and Adaptive Neural Network-Based Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), to ascertain whether these tools would be able to outperform a classical statistical method (multiple linear regression) in the prediction of the number of resultant adults (survivors) of experimental populations of Chrysomya megacephala (F.) (Diptera: Calliphoridae), based on initial larval density (number of larvae), amount of available food, and duration of immature stages. The coefficient of determination (R2) derived from the RBF was the lowest in the testing subset in relation to the other neural networks, even though its R2 in the training subset exhibited virtually a maximum value. The ANFIS model permitted the achievement of the best testing performance. Hence this model was deemed to be more effective in relation to MLP and RBF for predicting the number of survivors. All three networks outperformed the multiple linear regression, indicating that neural models could be taken as feasible techniques for predicting bionomic variables concerning the nutritional dynamics of blowflies.

Airflow around a flying blowfly\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKlopsch, Christian; Kuhlmann, Hendrik C.; Barth, Friedrich G.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThe hunting spider Cupiennius salei uses airflow generated by flying insects for the guidance of its prey-capture jump. We investigated the velocity field of the airflow generated by a freely flying blowfly close to the flow sensors on the spider's legs. It shows three characteristic phases (IâIII). (I) When approaching, the blowfly induces an airflow signal near the spider with only little fluctuation (0.013 Â± 0.006 m sâ1) and a strength that increases nearly exponentially with time (maximum: 0.164 Â± 0.051 m sâ1 s.d.). The spider detects this flow while the fly is still 38.4 Â± 5.6 mm away. The fluctuation of the airflow above the sensors increases linearly up to 0.037 m sâ1 with the fly's altitude. Differences in the time of arrival and intensity of the fly signal at different legs probably inform the spider about the direction to the prey. (II) Phase II abruptly follows phase I with a much higher degree of fluctuation (fluctuation amplitudes: 0.114 Â± 0.050 m sâ1). It starts when the fly is directly above the sensor and corresponds to the time-dependent flow in the wake below and behind the fly. Its onset indicates to the spider that its prey is now within reach and triggers its jump. The spider derives information on the fly's position from the airflow characteristics, enabling it to properly time its jump. The horizontal velocity of the approaching fly is reflected by the time of arrival differences (ranging from 0.038 to 0.108 s) of the flow at different legs and the exponential velocity growth rate (16â79 sâ1) during phase I. (III) The air flow velocity decays again after the fly has passed the spider.

To gain more information about the K(+) transport system underlying the TEP generation and the location of its components in the plasma membrane of the tormogen cell, we studied the effects of inhibitors of K(+)/H(+) P-ATPase (bafilomycin A1, omeprazole and Na-orthovanadate), of K(+)/Cl(-) co-transport (bumetanide), of Cl(-) channels (NPPB) and of a K(+) channel blocker (BaCl(2)). The relationship between TEP amplitude and spike firing activity was also studied. Experiments were performed on the labellar chemosensilla of the blowfly Protophormia terraenovae using a modified tip-recording technique. Results show that: (a) K(+)/H(+) P-ATPase inhibitors significantly decrease the TEP, when properly applied to the labellum for 20 min, so as to reach the basolateral side of the plasma membrane, while no effect was detected when applied to the apical side, (b) bumetanide, NPPB and BaCl(2) decrease the TEP value only when administered to the apical side, (c) spike activity is positively correlated with the TEP. A model is proposed of the active and passive K(+) transports sustaining the TEP associated with the blowfly chemosensilla.\n\nDevelopment of the oriental latrine fly, Chrysomya megacephala (Diptera: Calliphoridae), at five constant temperatures\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nGruner, S. V.; Slone, D.H.; Capinera, J.L.; Turco, M. P.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nChrysomya megacephala (Fabricius) is a forensically important fly that is found throughout the tropics and subtropics. We calculated the accumulated development time and transition points for each life stage from eclosion to adult emergence at five constant temperatures: 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35âÂ°C. For each transition, the 10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles were calculated with a logistic linear model. The mean transition times and % survivorship were determined directly from the raw laboratory data. Development times of C. megacephala were compared with that of two other closely related species, Chrysomya rufifacies (Macquart) and Phormia regina (Meigen). Ambient and larval mass temperatures were collected from field studies conducted from 2001â2004. Field study data indicated that adult fly activity was reduced at lower ambient temperatures, but once a larval mass was established, heat generation occurred. These development times and durations can be used for estimation of a postmortem interval (PMI).\n\nQuantifying pteridines in the heads of blow flies (Diptera: Calliphoridae): Application for forensic entomology.\n\nPubMed\n\nCammack, J A; Reiskind, M H; Guisewite, L M; Denning, S S; Watson, D W\n\n2017-11-01\n\nIn forensic cases involving entomological evidence, establishing the postcolonization interval (post-CI) is a critical component of the investigation. Traditional methods of estimating the post-CI rely on estimating the age of immature blow flies (Diptera: Calliphoridae) collected from remains. However, in cases of delayed discovery (e.g., when remains are located indoors), these insects may have completed their development and be present in the environment as adults. Adult fly collections are often ignored in cases of advanced decomposition because of a presumed little relevance to the investigation; herein we present information on how these insects can be of value. In this study we applied an age-grading technique to estimate the age of adults of Chrysomya megacephala (Fabricius), Cochliomyia macellaria (Fabricius), and Phormia regina (Meigen), based on the temperature-dependent accumulation of pteridines in the compound eyes, when reared at temperatures ranging from 5 to 35Â°C. Age could be estimated for all species*sex*rearing temperature combinations (mean r 2 Â±SE: 0.90Â±0.01) for all but P. regina reared at 5.4Â°C. These models can be used to increase the precision of post-CI estimates for remains found indoors, and the high r 2 values of 22 of the 24 regression equations indicates that this is a valid method for estimating the age of adult blow flies at temperatures â¥15Â°C.

They can be divided into fecal spots, regurgitation spots and swiping stains. The characteristics of fecal spots are round with three distinct levels of pigmentation; creamy, brownish and darkly pigmented. Matrix of the spots appears cloudy. The round spots are symmetrical and non-symmetrical, delineated by irregular and darker perimeter which only visible in fairly colored fecal spots. Diameter of these artifacts ranged from 0.5 mm to 4 mm. Vomit or regurgitation spots are determined by the presence of craters due to sucking activity of blowflies and surrounded by thickly raised and darker colored perimeter. The size of these specks ranged from 1 mm to 2 mm. Matrix of the spots displays irregular surface and reflective under auxiliary microscope light. Swiping stains due to defecation by flies consists of two distinguishable segments, the body and tail. It can be seen as a tear drop-like, sperm-like, snake-like and irregular tadpole-like stain. The direction of body and tail is inconsistent and length ranged between 4.8 mm to 9.2 mm. A finding that should be highlighted in this observation is the presence of crater on tadpole-like swiping stain which is apparent by its raised border characteristic and reflective under auxiliary microscope light. The directionality of this darkly brown stain is random. This unique mix of regurgitation and swiping stain has never been reported before. Highlighting the features of artifacts produced by flies would hopefully add our understanding in differentiating them from blood spatters produced from victims at crime scenes.\n\nImpact of stride-coupled gaze shifts of walking blowflies on the neuronal representation of visual targets\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKress, Daniel; Egelhaaf, Martin\n\n2014-01-01\n\nDuring locomotion animals rely heavily on visual cues gained from the environment to guide their behavior. Examples are basic behaviors like collision avoidance or the approach to a goal. The saccadic gaze strategy of flying flies, which separates translational from rotational phases of locomotion, has been suggested to facilitate the extraction of environmental information, because only image flow evoked by translational self-motion contains relevant distance information about the surrounding world. In contrast to the translational phases of flight during which gaze direction is kept largely constant, walking flies experience continuous rotational image flow that is coupled to their stride-cycle. The consequences of these self-produced image shifts for the extraction of environmental information are still unclear. To assess the impact of stride-coupled image shifts on visual information processing, we performed electrophysiological recordings from the HSE cell, a motion sensitive wide-field neuron in the blowfly visual system. This cell has been concluded to play a key role in mediating optomotor behavior, self-motion estimation and spatial information processing. We used visual stimuli that were based on the visual input experienced by walking blowflies while approaching a black vertical bar. The response of HSE to these stimuli was dominated by periodic membrane potential fluctuations evoked by stride-coupled image shifts. Nevertheless, during the approach the cellâs response contained information about the bar and its background. The response components evoked by the bar were larger than the responses to its background, especially during the last phase of the approach. However, as revealed by targeted modifications of the visual input during walking, the extraction of distance information on the basis of HSE responses is much impaired by stride-coupled retinal image shifts. Possible mechanisms that may cope with these stride-coupled responses are discussed\n\nIncreasing the Number of Canadian Indigenous Students in STEM at the University of Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSt-Jacques, J. M.; McGee, S.; Janze, R.; Longman, M.; Pete, S.; Starblanket, N.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nCanadian Indigenous people are an extremely poorly represented group in STEM today due to major barriers in obtaining a high school and then a university education. Approximately 10% of the undergraduate student population out of a total 12,600 students at the University of Regina, Regina, Saskatchewan, is First Nations, MÃ©tis or Inuit. The university is located in a catchment region where 30% of the population is First Nations or MÃ©tis. Approximately 100 students majoring in the sciences, mathematics and engineering have self-declared themselves to be Indigenous. For the past two years, we have been running a pilot project, the Initiative to Support and Increase the Number of Indigenous Students in the Sciences, Mathematics and Engineering at the Aboriginal Student Centre, with financial support from the Deans of Science and Engineering. We provide student networking lunches, Indigenous scientist and engineer speakers and mentors and supplemental tutoring. Our program is actively supported and guided by Elder Noel Starblanket, former president of the National Indian Brotherhood (now the Assembly of First Nations). Our students are greatly interested in the health and environmental sciences (particularly water quality), with a sprinkling of physics, mathematics and engineering majors. Our students have gone on to graduate work with prestigious scholarships and a paid internship in engineering. We report here on various lessons learned: the involvement of elders is key, as is the acceptance of non-traditional academic paths, and any STEM support program must respect Indigenous culture. There is great interest in science and engineering on the part of these students, if scientists and engineers are willing to listen and learn to talk with these students on their own terms.\n\nDevelopment of the Oriental Latrine Fly, Chrysomya megacephala (Diptera: Calliphoridae), at Five Constant Temperatures.\n\nPubMed\n\nGruner, S V; Slone, D H; Capinera, J L; Turco, M P\n\n2017-03-01\n\nChrysomya megacephala (Fabricius) is a forensically important fly that is found throughout the tropics and subtropics.

Cochliomyia macellaria (Fabricius) or Chrysomya megacephala (Fabricius) larvae were collected first, after which Chrysomya rufifacies (Macquart) oviposited on the carcasses in multiple locations (i.e., neck, anus, and exposed flesh) not inhabited already by the other blow fly larvae. Within the first week of decomposition, C. rufifacies larvae grew to â¥12Â mm, filling the carcasses with thousands of larvae and replacing the other calliphorid larvae either through successful food source competition or by predation. As a result, C. macellaria and C. megacephala were not collected past their third instar feeding stage. The blow fly species, C. megacephala, C. macellaria, Lucilia caeruleiviridis (Macquart), Phormia regina (Meigen), Lucilia sericata (Meigen), and C. rufifacies, completed two developmental cycles in the 88.5-kg carcass. This phenomenon might serve to complicate or prevent the calculation of an accurate postmortem interval.\n\nVolatile organic compounds released by blowfly larvae and pupae: new perspectives in forensic entomology.\n\nPubMed\n\nFrederickx, C; Dekeirsschieter, J; Brostaux, Y; Wathelet, J-P; Verheggen, F J; Haubruge, E\n\n2012-06-10\n\nTo evaluate postmortem intervals (PMIs), one should take into account the determined age of necrophagous flies present on the cadaver. However, PMI determination needs further improvement, and rapid and accurate approaches have therefore to be developed. While previous studies have focussed on insect cuticular hydrocarbons, here we explore the volatile profile released by larvae and pupae of Calliphora vicina Robineau-Desvoidy (Diptera: Calliphoridae). We monitored changes in volatile compounds daily, by headspace solid-phase microextraction, followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Branched and unbranched hydrocarbons, alcohols, esters and acids were identified, and the volatile profile was shown to vary, in both composition and quantity, with the age of the larva/pupa under investigation. We concluded, based on the analysis of the released volatile organic compounds, that it is possible to increase the accuracy of the estimated PMI, throug"
