        "text": "Sport in Cuba: The Diamond in the Rough\n\nby Paula J. Pettavino and Geraldine Pye\n\nThe Politics of Sport in Cuba: Foundations\n\nAfter the 1987 Pan-American Games in Indianapolis, a Cuban newspaper headline read, \"CUBA: 7.5 Medals per Million Inhabitants. USA: 0.70\" Despite a limited pool of talent and a notorious weakness in certain sports, Cuba has proved itself a sporting powerhouse since the end of the nineteenth century. An island with a population smaller than many U.S. cities has achieved an astounding measure of athletic success.\n\nBefore the revolution, such wild successs was limited to selected sports such as baseball and boxing. In 1959, however, Fidel Castro pulled the stops on Cuban sports fanaticism, and he has since presided over unprecedented growth and mastery of along list of international sports. In baseball, for example, Cuba has amassed a record of 71-1 in international tournaments. Cuba also won gold medals in the last two Pan-American Games, in the 1988 and 1990 world championships, and in the 1987, 1989, and 1991 Inter-continental Cup Games. Most significant, perhaps, Cuba won the First Olympic gold medal ever awarded for baseball, at the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona. The Cuban team was called \"the other Dream Team.\"\n\nWhen it came time for the 1991 Pan-American Games held in Havana, Cuba had not been tested in other sports for a decade, because they boycotted the 1984 and 1988 Olympics. Because of the U.S. boycott of the 1980 Moscow Olympics, Cuba had not faced U.S. Olympic athletes since 1976, when Alberto Juantorena had won both the 400-and 800-meter races. In 1991, the United States won the most medals (352 to Cuba's 265), but Cuba took home the most gold (140 to the United States' 130) and did so in the sports that really matter: basketball, baseball, boxing, and track and field. This was the first time the United States had been beaten in the tally of gold medals since 1951, when the Pan-American Games began. In silver medals, the United States recovered some national pride (winning 125 to Cuba's 62), as well as in bronze (97 to Cuba's 63). In the famous national pastime of both Cuba and the United States, sixty thousand Cubans watched their undefeated national team beat the Ayanquis, 3-2. Cuba also won 11 of the 12 gold medals in boxing and amassed 29 of the 30 gold medals in weightlifting.\n\nIn 1992 came the Summer Olympics in Barcelona. Cuba placed fifth in the tally of gold medals, with a total of fourteen: seven in boxing, one in women's volleyball, one in women's discus, one in men's high jump, one in baseball, two in wrestling, and one in women's judo. In addition, Cuba won six silver and eleven bronze medals.\n\nYet, despite this glowing success, the Cuban sports system is in jeopardy, and one need look no further for a reason than those same Pan-American Games held in Havana. There is a striking contrast between the relative poverty of ordinary Cubans with their ration books and the relative plenty of the athletes. Cuba has overwhelming economic problems, resulting from the near-cessation of aid from the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, but the Cuban government still spent an estimated $24 million (in hard currency) and 100 million pesos ($132 million) to build athletic and residential facilities for the Pan-American Games. The average Cuban has to wait in line for soap, bread, chicken, coffee, and even sugar, and there was understandable resentment throughout the island that seventeen thousand visitors were served all-you-can-eat buffets. Castro was \"doing the wave,\" while ordinary Cubans were lining up for essentials. Although the demonstrations against Castro predicted by some people did not materialize, one U.S. official pointed out that Fidel may still be generally popular, but \"you can't eat charisma.\" One graduate of the University of Havana cited by Spencer Reiss compared Cuba and the Games to the Roman Empire. \"Remember the end of the Roman Empire-bread and circuses? That's the Panamericanos. Only soon even the pan [bread] will be gone.\"\n\nAccording to Gustavo Rolle, an official of the Cuban Institute for Sports, Education, and Recreation, there is no resentment:\n\nThe Olympics are important to our people, especially in these difficult economic times. So our people clearly understand that our athletes need more food than the average person because their energy consumption is very high. They understand that our athletes have to consume what they need.\n\nYet sports writers covering the Pan-American Games, such as Tom Knott of the Washington Times, spoke of the \"jarring contrasts: the shiny facilities and the decay; the official pomp and circumstance against the unofficial whispers of discontent. I was jarred by the food lines and grim faces, jarred by the omnipresent police and military. He also wondered if Cuban boxer Teófilo Stevenson, who said 'We are all equals in Cuban society,' had to wait in bread lines or ride on a bicycle.\"\n\nThe athletes seem to want for nothing. They certainly have all the food they can eat and, instead of the now-typical Cuban bicycle (imported from China), they have cars, drivers, and houses. According to Jose Fuentes, manager of the Cuban National baseball team, \"Our government has a general assistance [policy] for all people who are outstanding. The government tries to give better living conditions to the most outstanding people. I think our resources are distributed in a just way. I think the people who do the greatest effort should be the prized ones.\"\n\nHas the situation in Cuba deteriorated to such a level, in this \"Special Period in Peace Time,\" that resources from other areas may be used to bail out the economy? The sports system has held a special place of honor in Cuban society since 1959, and this attention has paid off in both domestic and foreign policy. Now it may pay off in the more literal sense. Sport in Cuba now pays for itself. According to Cuban officials, their $120-million-a-year sports and Physical education program is self-financed: from prize money won in international competitions, from the export of sports equipment, and from the contracting of Cuban coaches to rival Olympic programs. Further, a new policy permits Cuban athletes, coaches, and sports officials to charge some foreign TV crews for interviews.\n\nIn addition, other countries have helped Cuban sports financially. The Italian government financed a large part of the expenses for the Cuban baseball team to go to Barcelona. Host countries pay the way for Cuban athletes to compete. Sport may turn out to be a moneymaker as well as an imagemaker. Clearly, for the last three decades, sport has been used by Fidel Castro to the utmost Cuban advantage. There is little evidence that he will break this record.\n\nUNCONVENTIONAL DIPLOMACY\n\nCuba is an island country of 44,128 square miles and approximately eleven million people. It seems almost ludicrous to speak of such a small nation-especially one located so much in the shadow of the United States-as conducting a global foreign policy. Yet, Cuba does indeed have a \"big country's foreign policy.\" In fact, since 1959, Cuba has conducted itself as a leading player in the international arena, even without the necessary domestic resources.\n\nCuban foreign policy as a whole has served clear defensive interests since 1959. These objectives, though specific to the Cuban situation, are not too dissimilar to the initial foreign policy objectives of any new regime. Castro's first priority has been, and continues to be, to insure and enhance his political base within Cuba. His second concern is to assure the security of the regime from hostile outside powers, the United States in particular.\n\nWith a realistic eye toward Cuba's economic limitations, Castro has had to seek external economic assistance to insure the continued development of his country, if not its very survival. He also had to solidify and maintain support for his revolution within his own country. To accomplish these goals, it was essential to portray Cuba in the best possible light. Castro's solution to the problem has been the use of unconventional forms of diplomacy, which he wields with phenomenal success.\n\nHis unconventional diplomacy encompasses a wide range of methods of disseminating propaganda, both within Cuba and externally. Often denied use of the more conventional modes of political, military, and economic diplomacy, Cuba has turned instead to other means, such as tourism, cultural activities, health systems, the astute use of the media, sports, and the physical culture system. Clearly, the Cuban sports system provides a vivid example of Cuba's most successful diplomatic tools.\n\nThe development and use of Cubans' vast athletic talent as a form of foreign policy has served Castro well in many ways. First, Cuba was at least partially able to distance itself from the Soviet Union and to develop an independent, albeit limited, foreign policy. Second, Castro wisely chose forms of unconventional diplomacy (such as sports) that were less likely to place him in direct conflict with his benefactor. Third, since 1961 Castro has taken the role of a leader of the Non-Aligned Movement, and Cuba's sporting successes have reinforced this image. Castro's international successes in unconventional forms of foreign policy have allowed him to increase his maneuvering power with Moscow, to come to terms with the United States, and to project Cuba as a leading model for the developing world.\n\nThe choice of sports as a method of diplomacy conveniently fits into Cuba's strong tradition of forceful nationalism and serves domestic purposes as well. Castro, for whom Cuba has never been quite big enough, has been the driving force behind Cuba's attempt at a global foreign policy. Adopting the ideology of socialism has served to enhance his chosen methods of building Cuba's domestic and worldwide image and realizing his own ambitions.\n\nSPORT AS A POLITICAL TOOL IN CUBA AND THE USSR\n\nThere is no aspect of Cuban life that more clearly epitomizes the Cuban leadership's emphasis on image-building and egalitarianism than the system of physical culture and competitive athletics. The Cuban record in international athletics is among the most recognized successes of the revolution. The revolutionary government knew from its inception that such a powerful image could serve the regime well. Developed countries are almost forced to admire Cuban athletic prowess. Developing countries are hopeful that emulation of the Cuban system will give them similar results.\n\nCuba's surge of athletic strength is a consequence of its conversion to socialism. With athletic superiority as a political goal, the Cuban government has imitated the Soviet system of physical culture, modifying it where necessary and expedient. The former Soviet Union discovered the value of sport as a political tool, over time, and formulated sports policy as a consequence of initial successes. Cuba immediately incorporated this tool into its system and ideology after seeing the positive effect of sport in the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union began with victories, which led to policy; Cuba laid down policy, which led to victories.\n\nCuba approaches the type of system that the Soviet Union was supposed to have had. The differences are of degree rather than substance. The Cuban system is modeled on the Soviet system, emphasizing central control in service to the goals of mass participation and the development of champions. However, the results of the two systems are different. Soviet athletes appeared cold and calculating, machinelike, ruthless. The Cubans are warmer, more human, less regimented. Cuban athletes emerge as more well-rounded individuals than their Soviet counterparts, ironically, closer to the ideal Anew communist man.\n\nThe Soviet system was older and more established, its policies characterized by science, routine, and no-nonsense regimentation. It produced athletes and personnel who were followers, rewarded for their discipline, obedience, and performance. The Cuban sports system is still emerging, characterized by novelty, creativity, and experimentation. Those involved in sports have a greater degree of efficacy and freedom. They are seen as and see themselves as innovators, discoverers, leaders in a true sense. They work in a system that is still developing, although in recent times there are signs of increased bureaucratization and a greater emphasis on scientific methods.\n\nSport is even more important for Cuba than for the Soviet Union. At a similar stage of development on economic and military levels, the positive image provided by the Soviet Union's sporting victories was merely a boost; it was already secure in its position as a world power. On the other hand, for Cuba, its positive impact in the international sporting world is a major force whereby Cuba can prove itself of world caliber.\n\nOverall, Cuba provides the world with a clear example of how a communist system can help a developing country move from backwardness to excellence in a single area. The phenomenal success of the sports system is inspirational to all sides of the ideological spectrum. Despite the fact that sports funding now comes from athletes' earnings and other sources,12 the cost of developing the sports program has been high. Sacrifices have had to be made in other areas of society. For other nations, especially those with different political systems, such sacrifices would have been impossible. But the Cuban government has received what it paid for.\n\nFor politicians, the virtue of sport is readily understandable. Sport has tremendous exposure worldwide and, at first glance, is apolitical. It is precisely sport's surface innocence that renders it so well suited to use as a political tool. However, the political motivation behind the system of physical culture in Cuba does not dull Cuba's justified pride in the effectiveness of that system.\n\nECONOMIC HARDSHIP AND POLITICAL ISOLATION\n\nIn an earlier time, Cuba was isolated economically and politically because of its belief in socialism. Sport was one area that allowed this circle of isolation to be broken. Now, in this era of flight from communism in Nicaragua, in Eastern Europe, and in the Soviet Union itself, Cuba stands alone as the bulwark of Marxism-Leninism. As economic aid from the former Soviet Union and other allies dries up, Cuba needs to break the circle of isolation that has arisen anew. Sport may once again be the perfect tool for the job.\n\nHowever, Cuba is suffering an era of severe austerity. Cars and trucks are being replaced by bicycles and oxen and the sports system may be one area from which Cuba could cut excess. In fact, the Cubans are being forced to do just that; the austerity is affecting even their national obsession. As the island moves to further conserve electricity, for example, night baseball games have been cancelled. Sports coverage in the newspapers has been reduced significantly because of the shortage of newsprint. The main offices of the National Institute for Sports, Education, and Recreation (INDER) have had to move all the computers into one room to save air-conditioning costs. The recent shortage of gasoline caused an annual bicycle race around the island to be canceled. There was not enough fuel to transport the racers, staff, and their equipment during the event. The race will be replaced by an indoor competition.\n\nYet these examples illustrate the Cuban ability to turn adversity into advantage, a talent called resolviendo that has been finely honed for thirty years since the abortive Playa de Girón (Bay of Pigs) invasion and the start of the U.S. embargo. Castro has elevated sacrifice almost to a virtue. Cuban foul balls, for example, are never kept by the fan who catches them, but rather returned to the field with a virtuous flourish. Actually, baseball games have not been completely canceled but are now held during daylight hours and generally just on weekends. The bicycle race was not discontinued but rather was converted into an event that used less of a precious resource. Neither of these changes constitutes great sacrifice. Sporting events play a tremendous role in sustaining the Cuban morale, especially in a time of austerity. So their complete cancellation would have far-reaching effects.\n\nAlthough the system of sports in Cuba is distinctively Cuban (as will be seen below), its origins can be found in the system of physical culture that was prevalent in other socialist countries. Before we turn exclusively to Cuba, it is instructive to look at the basis for the socialist approach to sports.\n\nTHE THEORETICAL BASIS OF THE SOCIALIST APPROACH TO SPORT\n\nThe Cuban system of sports is clearly based on those of the Soviet Union and the formerly socialist countries of Eastern Europe. Unlike in the Soviet Union, however, the Cuban revolutionary leaders did not inherit a highly centralized or a very well-organized sports system. The new organization had to be built basically from the ground up, following and modifying the Soviet example. The socialist countries adhered to a common philosophy of education and sport that had its roots in the philosophies of Marx and Lenin. Cuba also draws on the ideas of José Martí.16 In Marxist-Leninist theory, sport is not merely an activity for individuals but, rather, a social phenomenon. Because it is regarded as a part of the social superstructure, sport is inevitably tied to the relations of production, or the socioeconomic structure. Then the nature of sport in a society depends upon its class relationships:\n\nIn good Marxist logic, everything is interrelated. In Marxist conceptualizing, since the human organism develops and changes under the influence of external conditions including the social environment, subjection to physical exercise not only develops that part of the body to which it is directed, but also has an effect on the body as a whole-on the personality. A strong bond exists, then, between social and individual development and between the physical and mental development of the individual. The socialist societies seek to shape this development.\n\nMarx and Lenin both shunned the separation of the body from the mind. The combination of a healthy body and a healthy mind produced a completely formed person, capable of contributing a tremendous amount to society. Marx himself felt that the educational combination of \"productive labor\" with instruction and gymnastics would not only improve \"the efficiency of production\" but was also the only way to produce fully developed human beings. For Marx, recreation under communism would be a fusion of work-like activities with play.\n\nThe socialist view of sport as one of a number of interdependent aspects of society is a major reason for its high place on the list of priorities. The combining of sport and physical culture, for example, is important. The Soviet central committee of the All Union Communist party decreed on 13 July 1925 that:\n\nPhysical culture must be considered not only from the standpoint of physical education and health and as an aspect of the cultural, economic and military training of youth (the sport of rifle marksmanship and others), but also as one of the methods of educating the masses (in as much as physical culture develops willpower and builds up endurance, teamwork, resourcefulness and other valuable qualities), and in addition, as a means of rallying the broad masses of workers and peasants around the various Party, soviet, and trade union organizations, through which the masses of workers and peasants are to be drawn into social and political activity.\n\nYet physical culture for the socialist countries has almost a mystical, futuristic quality about it. The term defies definition but clearly goes beyond the realm of mere sports: \"Sport belongs to the vision of the world we want to create.\"\n\nMilitary preparedness and labor productivity are the two most important goals of physical culture and sport. The advent of modern industry required more than physical fitness; it required a healthy mind and a healthy attitude. Strenuous exercise should instill \"in young people a love of labor.\" Such preparation enables the socialist athlete \"to be an active builder of communism. Athletes are obliged to raise the productivity of labor by all means at their disposal, to perform exemplary work at their jobs, and at the same time to help their friends achieve victories of production.\" Labor productivity is inextricably bound to military preparedness in the Soviet mass physical fitness program, Gotovk trudui oborone or GTO (Ready for labor and defense) and its Cuban counterpart, Listos Para Vencer or LPV (Ready to win).\n\nAt the heart of the philosophy is the ability of physical culture to build strong character. The educational scheme aims to construct a new communist society by creating a new type of socially minded citizen, namely, the Anew communist man.24 He is disciplined, highly motivated, and capable of subordinating his personal requirements to those of the Communist party. Education is the method by which communists can transform society: \"Physical culture has become an inseparable part of communist education, an important means of educating the Soviet people for work and the protection of their home-country.\"\n\nWe speak of a model of sport but we have in mind a model of human personality, a model of society. Therefore, when we try to perceive the emerging outlines of this new model and state what factors are contributing to its creation and implementation, we want, of course, to know what type of man will act under that model and how the latter will affect his personality . . . . We strongly believe that under these new conditions, Man will be able more fully to satisfy his human needs more efficiently, to develop his mental and physical skills. This is the meaning behind all efforts to foresee the future. We strive to penetrate it in order to rationally shape it.\n\nCuba also uses the term physical culture for its program of sports and recreation. According to Raudol Ruíz,\n\nThis name is important conceptually because it is the final stage of our development. It will be how we create the habits and customs, how we will make sports a part of life for all citizens, how sports will form a part of the culture of the people. We still cannot say we have physical culture, but we can say that we are moving very slowly toward that goal.\n\nPhysical culture then, like communism, is an ever-present goal. In the socialist countries, the Anew man is the center of the development of society. Physical culture plays a large role in his formation, giving him the mental and physical conditions for increasing productivity and the capability of defending his country.\n\nSPORTS FOR ONE OR FOR ALL?\n\nWithin socialist sport, there are two driving, and often competing goals. One is the concept of mass participation in sports: massovost in Russian and masividad or participación masíva in Spanish. The other is mastery of a sport: masterstvo in Russian. To critics of either system, these goals are mutually exclusive. To the Cubans, they complement each other.\n\nThe question is whether or not the ideal of sport for all is contradicted by the existence of an ability-based elite group of athletes. Certainly, Cuban athletes receive special privileges, such as training, extra food, and better housing (although there are indications that some of these have been reduced).30 The Cubans argue that the provision of incentives for raising standards during socialism may be necessary in order to build a material and cultural base for communism. In receiving some material benefits, the elite group of athletes may, however, operate in opposition to the development of egalitarian attitudes, despite the greater participation in sports inspired by their international successes.\n\nThese athletes cannot function as a class in the Marxist sense, nor can they automatically pass on their privileges to their children. The benefits are necessary for their success in international sports. Their successes, in turn, create prestige for Cuba both inside and outside the country. In addition to encouraging the participation of others in sports, this prestige contributes to the encouragement of Cuban nationalism so crucial to the Cuban identity and to Castro's ambition. Sports victories bring home the message of Cuban independence and progress, as well as send it abroad, thus inspiring support for the revolution.\n\nTo the Cubans, both goals mutually support each other in a continual cycle of interdependence. The road from mass participation leads to international competition. Success abroad then inspires more Cubans at home to participate.\n\nThe first objective of the Cuban sports system is to make sports available to everyone and to actively promote its development, as written in the Constitution. The second objective is to seek champions. According to Manuel González former director of the Cuban Olympic Committee, \"When we look at our children, we are searching for diamonds. Every child and every adult has a right to participate in athletics. And every diamond has a right to be discovered and polished.\" Cuba's athletic \"diamonds\" are found only through masividad, or mass participation in sports. However, Castro has warned that \"It is very important that we do not be mistaken, that in the search for champions we do not neglect the practice of sports.\"\n\nCuban athletes are expected to be revolutionaries, and those who are not involved in mass organizations or political bodies may be excluded from sports schools. Cuba's outstanding athletes are supposed to be examples for others to emulate. They are expected not only to be a vanguard for the development of full human potential in physical culture, but also to be models of the \"new man.\" Consequently, athletes contribute to building socialism.\n\nThe international successes of Cuba's top athletes constitute an extremely forceful propaganda weapon. Sport's universal popularity and sheer visibility make it extremely effective:\n\nSporting success is seen by some as a measure of national vitality and prestige.... By its nature, sport is suited to the task; it excites nationalist instincts and encourages group identification; it is superficially apolitical and readily understandable; and, through modern means of communication, sorting spectacles can be transmitted throughout the worlds.\n\nBy means of this powerful propaganda, socialist countries have been able to utilize sport to (1) weaken the influence of non-communists upon their citizens and (2) weaken the international prestige of the West by challenging its position as sports leader. Through competition in sports, the other peoples of the world could observe the differences between the socialist and capitalist systems and compare them. The hope, of course, was that such a comparison would show the superiority of communism:\n\nThe Soviet Union has won valuable footholds of influence which have been exploited in every possible way to create a positive image of the Soviet Union and to influence foreigners to seek advantages in the Soviet system.... Every Soviet sport triumph is pictured as yet another proof of the superiority of the Soviet system over the decadence of the West.\n\nThe goals of Soviet foreign policy have been consistent: (1) commitment to the Marxist-Leninist goal of a worldwide communist social order, and (2) serving the national interests of the Soviet Union. Periods of Soviet weakness-in particular, the advent of nuclear weapons-brought the expedient policy of peaceful coexistence. New methods of continuing the struggle had to be found. Athletic competition is merely one of the methods by which \"war without warfare\" is waged. Cuba, on the other hand, has never been powerful enough militarily to defeat its primary rival, the United States. Yet in sports, it found a way to do just that.\n\nFOUNDATIONS OF CUBAN SPORTS\n\nOrganizing the Sports System\n\nDespite the obvious influences of the other socialist countries on Cuban sports and physical culture, the Cubans have developed a system that, in both practice and results, is all their own. The theoretical base of Cuban sport is simple; it is capitalist versus socialist. Raúl Castro neatly summed up the Cuban viewpoint:\n\nSport, like everything, is a reflection, simply, of a country's social system. Sport under socialism is neither restricted nor commercialized. It is mass sport with the participation of the people, all of the people, of all those who want to participate voluntarily. It is a means.\n\nUnder capitalism, sport, like almost everything, was an end, and the end was profit. Sport under a socialist regime is a means, before everything else, for the self-improvement of the citizen, for the betterment of his health, constituting also, a type of prophylactic measure. At the same time, it creates the conditions and makes the citizens capable even to the point of increasing production, defending the country, and [providing] a healthy means of recreation.\n\nStatements like this pay obvious lip service to the Soviet Union and other socialist standard bearers. The Cubans freely followed the socialist model in developing their own system of sports, with a sincere admiration for the successful programs they saw in East Germany, the Soviet Union, and other communist countries. It is doubtful, however, that the sports system was so important that all financial aid from the socialist bloc would have been withheld if the Cubans had refused to follow the socialist path. Yet, in following the Soviet example, the Cuban leaders did not blindly take the program found in other countries and superimpose it on their own. Rather, they began with egalitarian goals that later meshed into consistent socialist goals. According to Raudol Ruiz,\n\nINDER's principal task is to make it possible for the people to engage in physical activity as part of their education, and for their health and recreation. The primary goal of INDER continues to be mass participation in sports, to ensure that every day more men and women, children, young people, and students practice sports, physical education, gymnastics, walking, excursions, bicycling; to ensure that they are in contact with nature, enjoy nature and take maximum advantage of our climate.\n\nFidel Castro concurred when he said that sport\n\nteaches them how to exert themselves, it teaches them how to discipline themselves, it teaches them to work collectively, because precisely the sports they practice in general are team sports, from which they learn to work collectively . . . . Sport [is] a marvelous activity that not only helps the physical health, not only helps to form the character, but it also makes them enthusiastic and it makes them happy.\n\nIt is in the paths chosen to reach these goals that the Cubans have shown creativity and independence. The Soviet Union began with victories in sports, which led to policy; Cuba had the luxury of choosing from policies that had already been tested and proven successful. At the same time, the Cubans also exercised their right to reject the policies that had failed, or more importantly, those which produced results that were not consistent with Cuban aspirations.\n\nBoth the Cubans and the Russians had to begin building their sports systems out of the chaos of revolution. More than anything, the Cubans wanted a complete break from the past. Shortly after the revolution, Rafael Cambo Arcos wrote that,\n\nThe previous sports organization had to be destroyed, the ruling anarchy eliminated, the existing flaws and vices eradicated. On top of this ruin, it was necessary to construct a new organization, one without the smallest link to the past, a completely new system, a product of the radical change in political philosophy which, at this time, leads the destiny of Cuba.\n\nSports Before the Revolution\n\nThis emphasis on sports is not a new phenomenon in Cuba. Although it was hardly the egalitarian system that exists today, the sporting tradition in Cuba has a long pre-revolutionary history. Aside from the traditional cockfighting and other gambling \"sports,\" boxing, track, and baseball (a Cuban obsession) were popular in Cuba decades before Fidel Castro allegedly tried out for the Washington Senators.\n\nBaseball has long been the premier sport of the island, even before the American presence there. The Siboney Indians played a game called batos that used a bat and ball. The first Cuban baseball stadium was inaugurated in Matanzas in 1874, and by the 1930s, many Cuban baseball players (and boxers) earned a fair wage in the professional realm, with some actually making it big in the lucrative U.S. sports scene.\n\nFor the lower classes, baseball and boxing constituted a possible ticket out of poverty as well as steady, reliable entertainment. Yet many pre-revolutionary Cuban athletes were \"people born into comfort, never touched by misery or want.\" Cuba's Ramón Fonst won a gold medal in the individual epee event in fencing in the Paris Olympics of 1900. Four years later, he won three individual gold medals and one team gold in the St. Louis Olympics. (For the Cubans, however, this victory was tainted by Fonst's long-time residency in France.) Another Cuban with leisure time, Jose Radl Capablanca, held the title of World Champion in chess in 1921 and 1927.\n\nYet, there was still another Cuban who distinguished himself in St. Louis. Félix Carvajal, known as Andarin, was a postman by trade who hitchhiked to St. Louis to run the marathon. Exhausted by his journey and a bout with some green apples, he won only fourth in the event, having received no support from the Cuban government for his efforts. Like most lower-class pre-revolutionary Cuban athletes, Carvajal was unknown until his death in 1948. All of his recognition has come posthumously and after the revolution.\n\nSport for the Cuban population at large, including Andarín and others of his class, was almost nonexistent. Exclusive clubs denied entry to most Cubans, on racial or economic grounds. U.S. interests dominated some Cuban sports, especially those conducive to gambling, such as boxing. Previous Cuban governments showed little interest in developing the sports system. After the adoption of Marxism-Leninism, the revolutionary government claimed that pre-1959 Cuban athletes were exploited and treated as merchandise. To the revolutionaries, Cuba had few international successes in sports because of the small base of participation in athletics and the lack of public resources available.\n\nSports After the Revolution\n\nOnly after the revolution did Cuba begin to achieve success in sports. Within fifteen years of the revolution, Cuba had changed from a country that had won only a handful of medals to one of the top ten medal-winning nations in the Olympic Games. Western critics claim that this success is due to the technical support that Cuba has received from the socialist bloc, as well as their own specialized training for athletes. These factors are certainly important, but increased participation is also a major force behind the rapid rise in Cuba's success.\n\nAt the beginning of the revolutionary transformation, even before the conversion to Marxism-Leninism, Cuban leaders worked to remove legal and socioeconomic barriers to participation in physical culture. They sought a radical change in the social structure of Cuba and moved to break down not only gender and racial barriers but class barriers too, with the aim of extending egalitarianism in all areas, not just in the realm of physical culture. Emphasis was placed on increasing participation in sports and on improving access to physical culture, for health and recreational purposes, and as part of the general process of redistribution and democratization that characterized the early years of the revolutionary process.\n\nIn 1961, the year of Castro's conversion to Marxism-Leninism, the revolutionary government institutionalized the Cuban system of sports and physical culture. The administration of sports was transferred to a government body, INDER, which had centralized control for physical culture throughout the island.\n\nThe two most important factors for the promotion of egalitarianism in physical culture were the construction of new facilities and the production and distribution of sports equipment. In January 1959, there were just thirteen state-owned sports areas. Private clubs and centers were nationalized, and a program was launched to build new facilities. By 1965, Cuba had established a domestic sports industry to manufacture its own athletic equipment. By 1988, there were more than 9,600 facilities across the island.\n\nThe Cuban government also introduced a wide variety of programs aimed at encouraging people to participate in sports. In the 1960s, the emphasis was upon developing programs for young Cubans and in regions other than Havana. In the 1970s, as these programs continued, the Cubans directed their attention to new exercise programs for adults and sports competitions in work centers. In the 1980s, activities for older Cubans received increased emphasis. Since 1959, the vast majority of Cubans participate in sports at some stage in their lives, especially while attending educational institutions. Regular participants number approximately 1.5 million or almost a fifth of the population.\n\nCuba has in large part reached its goals of mass participation in and the democratization of sports. In the process, Cubans have achieved unprecedented success in international sports competitions. These successes have created the national and international prestige that is so important for Cuban nationalism and in promoting a sense of national unity and pride. In Cuba, this nationalism enhances an already-distinctive Cuban culture and, further, helps to eliminate remaining vestiges of U.S. influence. International success in sports also provides an example to other less-developed countries of the possibilities and achievements of socialism.\n\nProblems do exist, however. Participation in sports is abandoned by many Cubans when they leave school. Although more extensive than in 1959, women's participation-especially in organized sports-is far below that of men. Facilities and coaching are sometimes of lower standards than desired, reflecting at times bureaucratic inefficiencies. There is also the possibility for tension in balancing bureaucratic and funding emphasis between mass programs and elite sports. In the mid-1980s, these and other concerns about overemphasis on top-performance athletes were raised by Cuban sports officials.\n\nAlmost all Cubans with ability may aspire to athletic success and receive specialized training in sports schools.46 Outstanding athletes do not receive salaries above the general wage scales, but they do receive other advantages that may be more highly prized than money in a socialist country with limited goods and devalued currency. And, as in other countries, status from athletic achievement may help an athlete in elections for political positions.\n\nThe shifts between emphasizing egalitarianism and emphasizing performance in physical culture reflect many factors, including the attempt to balance democratic ideals with the requirements and benefits of international success. The shifting balance is also linked to variations in the overall revolutionary policy, shifting in response to immediate concerns, which have included redistribution efforts when expanding participation was stressed in the early 1960s; economic problems when there were cuts in sports spending during the late 1960s and late 1970s; security concerns when Cuba joined the Sports Committee of Friendly Armies in 1968 and 1969 and founded military sports clubs in the 1980s; and to the decentralization and institutionalization in the mid-1970s. Policy shifts also arise because decision making is limited mostly to an elite group of administrators and political authorities. Yet, despite these problems, there is an ongoing and determined effort to extend access to physical culture and to prevent the development of a closed elite.\n\nThe encouragement of outstanding athletes to behave as communist examples to others means that, in addition to their part in encouraging popular participation, athletes have a role in the socialization of all Cubans to combat old attitudes that may hinder the development of socialism in Cuba. Physical culture, then, is part of social change as well as an agent for social change.\n\nThe Limits to Theory\n\nThe limits on using sports as an avenue for social control are evident in the antigovernment physical culture organizations that existed before 1959, and in the defection of many Cubans, including some athletes, since 1959. There is no guarantee that participants will adopt the ideology of the revolution. Physical culture is but one of numerous vehicles through which the ideas of the state are promoted. However, the beauty of sport is that even dissidents can participate, without agreeing to ideological compromise, and possibly gain something in the process.\n\nThere are also limits on the extension of popular programs in physical culture. Cuba's leaders (and perhaps the population in general) have emphasized international sports victories. The presence of outstanding athletes may, however, inspire others to take up sports. The victories bring prestige to Cuba and demonstrate Cuba's achievements under a socialist system, to both friends and enemies. These victories are claimed as evidence of the benefits of socialism, raising the standard of living and creating a mass base of participation.\n\nThere are other more pressing limits as well, however. Achieving Cuban objectives in sports has been limited by the importance of developing the material base in Cuba, which is vital to ensure continuation of the revolution. This necessity is intensified by the limits of Cuban resources, the considerable reliance on imports, and the underdeveloped condition of the economy. With the dissolution of the communist bloc, the breakup of the Soviet Union, and the continued U.S. economic embargo, Cuba has lost its lifeline to the necessary resources to meet even basic human needs, such as food, clothing, and shelter, much less sports equipment. Even Fidel, in an act of socialist anthropomorphic license, has taken to calling the now-ubiquitous bicycles, valuable Adaughters of the special period.\n\nThe Cuban sports system contains two possibilities that may help ease the situation. First, the system has continued to receive funding, although relatively modest, throughout the period of the revolution. If needed, these resources, including athletes' and coaches' earnings now used to fund sports, can be redirected to more needy areas. Second, participation in sports and physical culture provides, at little cost, one area in which Cubans might temporarily forget their hardships and perhaps make themselves feel a little better.\n\nIn order to fully appreciate the accomplishments of the Castro government in the sports arena, it is necessary to look at the system that existed in Cuba before the revolution. In the next chapter, we will look in some detail at Cuban sport before 1959.\n\nCuba's Success: Top Performance Sports\n\nA close look at the Cuban system of popular participation in sports makes it clear that quality does indeed spring from the masses. The Cubans have dual goals for their system of sports and physical culture: for sport to become a daily part of the life of every Cuban, young and old; and for international champions to emerge from this wellspring of mass sport. At first, perhaps, these two objectives appear mutually exclusive. Yet as long as the aim of sport for the masses is never abandoned once top-level talent is found, the two are highly compatible, and surely, the Cubans have achieved this compatibility.\n\nThe Cubans claim that \"the first objective is to promote the development of sports, and the second objective is to seek champions.\" Yet when one sees the resources, both financial and otherwise, that go into the search for and polishing of these \"diamonds,\" the process of recruitment and training hardly seems to have been accorded second-place status. In the Cuban system, as soon as a child shows a particular talent, he is given every opportunity to develop it. \"The more people practicing [sport], the more people from which to choose.\"\n\nYet Cuba's status as a world sports power could not be solely attributed to an increase in numbers. A nation could, theoretically, increase popular participation in noncompetitive physical activities and decide either not to take part in or not to seek high standards in international sports while still maintaining competitive sports on a mass scale. However, Cuba chose neither of these options. Instead, success in international competition is highly regarded, although not to the exclusion of popular participation. Medals are viewed as evidence of Cuba's progress, and they bring prestige to this small nation.\n\nA Cuban athlete with talent has access to special training, special facilities, and possibly a sports school, which may not be available to a less talented athlete. A high-performance athlete gains not only prestige, but also the concrete benefits of a more balanced diet, special medical attention, and the resources of specialized sports science.\n\nThe decision to develop champions created a potential contradiction between mass participation and the privileged \"superathletes:\" Cuba has had to deal with issues including the use of drugs by top athletes, and the fixing of results. The domestic notoriety gained by some athletes has won them election to the National Assembly and high positions within the Cuban Communist party (PCC). There is, however, no reason for athletes to be excluded from these positions; they may, in fact, have useful knowledge to contribute, not just regarding physical culture but in other areas too, especially as they have the broadening experience of international travel.\n\nTHE SPORTS SCHOOLS\n\nCuba has developed an elaborate system for locating and selecting talented youngsters. By the 1980s, young athletes could enter a special sports school at the early primary level and continue right through to tertiary level, with full access to specialized training and facilities. This attention plays an important part in the improved performances of Cuban athletes in world competition. According to Cuban sports official Raudol Ruiz:\n\nThe advocates of capitalism allege that the socialist countries triumph because they give their athletes intensive training and special living quarters. It is true that in Cuba, for example, a national pre-selection is held in each sport, according to -a determined cycle, but no special training can bear fruit if there has not first been wide participation in sports. From the millions of boys and girls who play sports in Cuba come the Juantorenas, the Stevensons, the Rodriguezes.\n\nThe sports schools serve the important purpose of intensively training talented young athletes. Yet, at the same time, they are not inconsistent with the other major objective of Cuban sports, mass participation. To the Cubans, they encourage it. According to Fidel:\n\nNow it is important that the selection of students for this type of school be perfected. It must not be as a result of testing in 400 or 500 schools or between 40,000 or 50,000 students in a province. The test must be given in all the schools and to all students in a province. It is not the same thing to make selections from 40,000 students and to make them from 320,000. It is necessary to organize the testing of all students so that we do not lose a single one with ability, so that we do not lose a single champion.\n\nIn fact, to the Cubans, the very existence of champions encourages mass participation in sports, by virtue of its inspirational quality. As Castro has said:\n\nThese two objectives complement each other because the existence of these schools encourages the practice of sports. At the same time, these schools, with their selection of and the quality of their students, develop champions and we need champions because champions become symbols for the youth and children. Champions represent the extent of the social, educational, and cultural development of our revolution and our people. Champions become a measure of the character, will, and dignity of our people. And champions generate joy, honor, glory, and prestige for the country. We do not deny this. Therefore, this movement can perfectly help us attain both objectives. It is very important that we do not be mistaken, that in the search for champions we do not neglect the practice of sports.\n\nScholarships for sports schools began with the establishment of the Escuelas de Iniciacion Deportiva Escolares (Schools for the initiation of scholastic sports), the EIDEs. By the 1980s, there were no less than nine types of sports schools, as well as a large number of academies specializing in individual sports or in groups of a few related sports. The sports school system started in the preEIDEs at lower primary level and existed at all levels up to the tertiary level, at the Instituto Superior de Cultura Fisica (Institute for ~-physical culture), or ISCF. A student could enter at any level, not necessarily having to pass through all levels. The possible progression of students through this network of sports institutions is shown in figure 1.\n\nAthletes could be chosen for the national selection and the national team at any stage in the sports school system. The idea of providing specialized sports training (and of insisting that athletes obtain an all-round education) began early in the revolutionary process, before Cuba became allies with the Soviet Union. In the first month of the revolution, sports academies were encouraged as a way to provide specialized training for athletes. All athletes in these academies and all those involved in competitions were obliged to attend evening classes to complete at least primary-level schooling.\n\nBy the 1963-1964 school year, there were at least 609 students receiving special sports training, as well as undertaking their general education. By the following school year, there were 1,049 students in the recently established EIDEs. In 1978, sports school students numbered at least 5,610 and were distributed among eight sports schools. By 1979, there were 9,743 students in Escuelas Provinciales de Education Fisica (EPEFs) and in ISCF and its affiliates. By 1986, 2,372 students were enrolled for the bachelor's degree of physical culture at the ISCF. In 1988, students in sports institutions numbered 9,609. By 1986, these institutions included 9 EPEFs, 6 Escuelas Superior de Perfeccionamiento Atletico (ESPAs), 12 EIDEs, about 140 pre-EIDEs, 1 ISCF, 6 ISCF Filiales, 5 ISCF Unidades Docentes, 1 Concentrado Deportivo, 1 Escuela para Gigantes, plus a number of sports-oriented ESBECs, as well as a large number of academies specializing in one sport or several related sports. In 1987, the total number of specialized sports schools and sports areas (excluding EPEF and ISCF) was 1,439, with a total enrollment of 128,246.\n\nIn 1984, however, Castro announced that the construction of sports schools was not going to be as high on the list of priorities in the foreseeable future. With so many already in existence, one might wonder if any more were necessary. Castro also indicated concerns about the functioning of sports schools and referred to an investigation being carried out by Alberto Juantorena (vice-president for high-performance sport in INDER) on the state of existing sports schools. Among these concerns were the condition of the facilities and the need to balance academic studies with sports training, perhaps indicative of an overemphasis on sports. Castro, however, indicated no doubt as to the continuing importance of top-level sports. Even if the second half of the 1980s saw a slowing in the construction of sports schools and an emphasis on quality rather than quantity, Cuba already had an elaborate and extensive sports school network, which began in the pre-EIDEs.\n\nSelection Procedures\n\nYoung athletes are recommended for a special sports area by a teacher or are chosen on the basis of their competitive results. The third possibility, developed in the late 1970s, is through a test of biotype, which determines stamina, coordination, speed, sports skills, and general health. 12 Via one of these three avenues, a talented youngster can enter a special sports area or even a sports school. A child's parents can also apply for a place for their child in some of these schools. Presumably, applications are assessed on the basis of sports results, biotype, academic performance, and trials in their sport.\n\nAthletes can also be selected from any of several national games we described in chapter 4. The School Games and the Workers' Games, among others, begin in local-level meets and progress to regional levels, in a system intended to promote allegiance to a region rather than to a center, a school, or a team. These various national games incorporate many of the Cubans who participate in sports. The structure of these meets and the policy of selecting for higher levels the best players from the losing teams (the seleccion), not just from the best teams, means that greater numbers of Cubans are considered for specialized training. The School Games, in particular, have provided an avenue for many youngsters to gain entry to a specialized center or school. Many of Cuba's top athletes began in the School Games .\n\nSports Participation Areas\n\nOnce athletes with outstanding talent are selected, they are slated for more intensive training in their particular sport. The first level consists of the sports participation areas. These areas are, perhaps, similar to the playground or park district circuits in the United States, parks with equipment and with coaches or trainers, possibly volunteers, made available to developing athletes.\n\nIn 1977, there were 1,624 special areas in operation, with 65,500 students practicing 27 sports. In 1978, the numbers fell to 1,080 areas and 50,166 students. The reason for this reduction is unknown, yet the Cubans still set a target of 3,000 areas with 109,476 students for 1980. Whether or not this goal was met when intended is unknown, but in 1985, numbers fell some 29,000 short of the 1980 objective. By 1988, there were 1,439 special centers for sports training, including 128,246 students in special areas.\n\nThe decline from 1977 to 1978 could have been because of changing methods of collecting statistics or the closure of some special areas. The failure to reach the 1985 goal for sports areas by 1988 and the failure to reach the 1980 target for student numbers by 1985, however, might indicate economic constraints, a limit to the number of talented youngsters meeting the qualifying standards, or simply an overly ambitious planning official (the latter possibility was evident in target setting for economic and social plans, as well as in sports planning).\n\nAlthough goals are not always reached on time for special sports areas, there are still large numbers of young athletes using them. The 1987 INDER review, however, complained of the tendency to look only for champions, and of a lack of programs for teaching by categories and sports. Many of the youngsters who, despite these problems, received places in special areas could aspire to attend one of the many sports schools.\n\nAthletic Scholarships\n\nCuba's sports schools, since the late 1970s, have catered to special students from early primary level through the university level, most of whom are provided with tuition and full room and board. In the 1960s, scholarships for university and technical school students included board and 50 pesos per month for single students or from 90 to 150 pesos for married students or those with dependents. Students were not permitted to have paid employment or other sources of income.\n\nIn the 1963-1964 school year, sports scholarships numbered just 609. By 1966, there were 3,736 scholarships granted by the state at a cost of 981.7 thousand pesos (see tables 20 and 21). Thus, each student was allocated an average of 263 pesos per year. These figures almost certainly excluded the cost of board for these students, most of whom received it in full.\n\nDIFFERENT TYPES OF SPORTS SCHOOLS\n\nThe Pre-EIDEs\n\nIn 1984, there were 140 pre-EIDEs (Schools Before the Initiation of Scholastic Sports), with 22,000 students. The goal was to build a pre-FIDE in each of the 169 municipalities. In the 1987 INDER report, however, there were criticisms of the failure to fulfill plans and of the poor growth in the number of pre-EIDEs.\n\nThe first pre-EIDEs were established in the 1976-1977 school year. Students generally attended pre-EIDEs from the ages of eight through twelve. The pre-FIDE Camilo Cienfuegos in Havana takes students as young as six years old. Enrollment ranged from 100 to as many as 800 in each school. Pre-FIDE Ruben Bravo in Marianao (Ciudad Habana) began in 1978-1979 with 727 students and 37 teachers, offering 12 sports. The pre-EIDE in Camaguey had 16 sports and a student-teacher ratio of 10-25 students to one teacher. By 1987, there were 31,267 pre-EIDE athletes. Graduates could then pursue their sports specialization in an EIDE or at a sports ESBEC.\n\nEscuelas de Iniciación Deportiva Escolares, or EIDEs\n\nThe next level of intensive training for those showing talent are the EIDEs, directly modeled after the sports schools of East Germany and the former Soviet Union. The EIDEs combine a specialization in sports with the regular academic curriculum. Students attend on a daily or boarding basis, from the third or fourth grade of elementary school through the last year of preuniversity or high school.\n\nThe first EIDE was founded in 1964, with an initial enrollment of 1,049. By 1984, there were eleven of these schools and 13,000 students. Two years later, another FIDE had been added. By 1987, there were still eleven EIDEs in existence (one had been destroyed by a cyclone), with 11,742 students. Cuba, then, was well on its way toward its goal of having at least one EIDE in each of the fourteen provinces.\n\nThe EIDEs have clearly evolved with time. Baseball player Rodolfo Puente Zamora spoke of his student life in the early 1960s, converging with athletic practice in the EIDE in Arroyo Naranjo, Ciro Frias. Puente's account paints a picture of this particular EIDE at this particular time as, perhaps, a school he attended after finishing his regular day at a regular school. Curiously, a report made by the Cuban Ministry of Education in 1967 to the UNESCO Conference on Public Instruction does not include any schools that are identified as EIDEs or sports schools. It is possible that they were simply not listed separately.\n\nIn any case, the EIDEs of the early 1960s were far less elaborate and much smaller than those that exist today. In November 1976, the EIDE in Holguin was opened with much fanfare, touted as the Afirst in the country for its characteristics :\n\nIndependently of receiving their general preparation and of accomplishing their sports training in order to achieve a better performance, the students successfully combine the principles of communist education by mixing cultural activities, recreational activities, productive work, and formal education as the right way to instill in our youth and children the communist morality . . . .\n\nWe will not hold back efforts so that each day our students will be better students, outstanding athletes, and exemplary revolutionaries.\n\nThe Capitán Manuel Orestes School in Santiago de Cuba is similar to the one in Holguin. Over 1,500 students are taught by a staff of 69 teachers for academic subjects and 139 coaches and other sports specialists. The various facilities of the school include a massive gymnasium, three swimming pools (including one of Olympic size), a diving tank, two baseball diamonds, track and field facilities, a handball court, and four tennis courts, and there is a velodrome planned for the future.\n\nOver two thousand students enjoy similar facilities at the Martires de Barbados in Havana Province:\n\nThe school, built with the Girón system of prefabricated sections, consists of two blocks of classrooms; a building housing the kitchen and dining room; four blocks of dormitories; and a great number of sports facilities, among them two Olympic-size pools; one training pool; one diving tank; and a large gym for basketball, fencing, gymnastics, table tennis, judo, boxing, and wrestling. There are also baseball and soccer fields; track and field areas; and outdoor basketball, volleyball, and tennis courts.\n\nThe number of staff at this school is impressive: 169 coaches and trainers, and 70 academic teachers. Although students do get a taste of general physical education, the basic formula is \"one child, one sport, year round.\"\n\nThe Cubans claim to know the one sport in which the child excels by the time he is nine years old. Joel Despaigne, star of the Cuban men's volleyball team at the 1991 Pan American Games and the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, entered an EIDE in Santiago when he was twelve years old. Two years later, he was moved to Havana to play on the junior national team and was already attracting international attention.\n\nA student can be selected for an EIDE from a special sports area, from the School Games, or from a pre EIDE. But students in EIDEs are not allowed to be more than one year behind in school; the previous year of studies must be successfully completed. (There is no information on how flexible these rules are.) In addition, medical certification of age and health must be presented. Involvement in a mass organization (almost all Cubans belong to a mass organization), as a voluntary sports activist, or as a sports monitor in a regular school, works in favor of a student who is applying for entry into an EIDE.\n\nIn addition to outstanding talent and promising biotypes, students may also be chosen because they have unusually advantageous characteristics for a particular sport, such as height for basketball. This is similar in logic to the recruitment, direct from Africa, of 7'7\" Manute Bol to play basketball in the United States, when he had no background in the sport. The attempt is made to decide on a child's potential in a particular sport, in order to begin intensive training as early as possible.\n\nHowever, the Cubans are not so rigid as to ignore a good reason to change from one sport to another, if developing talent justifies it. Boxer Teofilo Stevenson used to play baseball; middle distance runner Alberto Juantorena was originally slated for basketball. When it became clear how fast Juantorena could run in bulky basketball shoes, his prescient coaches began to speculate on what he could do on a track with the proper training and equipment.\n\nOnce accepted, students must pass each year of regular schoolwork in order to hold their place. Students are expected to combine sports training, academic studies, and sometimes productive work. Theoretically, at least, failure in any of these areas could cost the student his place in a sports school. However, there is no information on whether any outstanding athletes have been expelled for failing to meet these other requirements. Three hours of the school day and after hours training are devoted to sports, with the remainder of the school day left for academic studies.\n\nFrom fifteen to twenty five sports are practiced in the EIDEs, all Olympic sports, including baseball. The EIDE Martires de Barbados in Havana has twenty five sports, and Pedro Diaz Coello in Holguin has eighteen. These schools boast some of the best coaching and athletic facilities in the country. In 1978, the EIDE in Santiago de Cuba had 139 sports teachers for 1,500 students, as well as three pools, two baseball diamonds, an athletics track, a handball court, four tennis courts, a large gymnasium, and a cycling track was planned. The approximately one thousand students attending the EIDE in Matanzas in 1978 had access to a gymnasium, two baseball fields, tennis courts, volleyball and basketball courts, an athletics track, a cycling track, a shooting range, and three pools. A similar list of facilities is available in other EIDEs.\n\nApparently, it is not enough. In 1984 and 1988, there was criticism of the poor maintenance and the underutilization of EIDE facilities. This in part might have motivated the 1984 investigation conducted by Alberto Juantorena and other sports officials. By 1988 there were complaints that the potential of EIDE students was growing more slowly than expected, given the level of development in Cuban sport.\n\nIn some cases, the Cubans have found it necessary to emphasize a particular sport, usually the ones that have been traditionally weak on the island. Cuba has developed one of the best water polo teams in the world, yet swimming remains its weakest sport. There is an EIDE on the Isla de la Juventud (Isle of Youth, formerly the Isle of Pines), where the emphasis is on the water sports: swimming, diving, canoeing, sailing, and water polo. In 1977, Castro spoke of strength in some events and weakness in others. \"We do not go anywhere with the discus. We do not go anywhere with the javelin. It is a good thing that we do not have to live off hunting like primitive man because we would certainly starve to death.\" The strategy worked. In the 1980 Olympics, Cuban Maria Caridad Colon (who attended an FIDE) placed first in the javelin, the first Latin American woman ever to win Olympic gold; Luis Delis placed third in the discus.\n\nDespite the perquisites of life in the EIDEs individual attention from talented coaches, access to high quality facilities, and more and better food than is rationed for the general population (and this is more true in the 1990s than ever) entrance to one of these schools does not spell a life of leisure. Standards for these modern EIDEs are well defined. Students' progress is recorded meticulously, and they are continually evaluated not only for their athletic performance but also for the academic level they maintain and their degree of political commitment. Castro cautioned the athletes:\n\nYou are not going to be professional athletes; you are not going to make a living at sports . . . . You will make it from your work. You will be able to go as far as you wish in sports, but you will also be able to go as far as you wish as citizens and as professionals and technicians.\n\nThe outcome is a system very unlike the athletic scholarships given in the United States. Three young basketball players (two were former EIDE students, all three were current ESPA students) emphasized how important it was that they keep up in their academic studies. All three made cutting motions under their chins to show what would happen if they did not obtain the required grades. Castro described the system during his dedication at the school Martires de Barbados:\n\nOf course, it is known that students come to these schools based on their merits, capability, and aptitude. However, a point where we can never fail, and we cannot condone failure in this area even to the champion of champions, is the fulfillment of obligations as students. We cannot permit that an athlete be a poor student. Before violating this principle we would prefer to lose a champion. Therefore, as a golden rule, an athlete must be a good student and must pass his course. Secondly, an athlete must develop his sports and physical capabilities to the maximum. He must not neglect this. The third rule: selection must be continuous in these schools. The fact that someone has entered in a specific grade . . . does not mean that he has to remain in the school until he finishes. There must be a renewal of students because if . . . better prospects emerge, those who have been in the school and have not shown the same abilities must yield their place to the new ones .... Renewal of students is a principle that must be applied. There must never be a place occupied here when there is a student with better capabilities unable to join the school.\n\nAfter seeing the talent that was beginning to amass in these schools, in 1979 INDER officials found it necessary to change the system of competition for the School Games. Prior to that time, all schools competed among themselves, including the EIDEs with the non-EIDE schools. As the talent became concentrated in the EIDEs, the non-EIDEs were invariably eliminated by the special sports schools. After 1979, the system was changed into two parallel structures, in which the regular schools compete among themselves and the EIDEs compete among themselves. With this change, the EIDEs and the regular schools never meet in competition. This gives more incentive to the students in the non-EIDE schools and, in turn, gives the talent scouts more new talent to observe (especially given the system of selección that we discussed in chapter 4).\n\nEscuelas Secundarias Básicas en el Campo, or ESBECs\n\nThe EIDEs were the first of Cuba's sports schools and had some of the best facilities available. They were, however, in or near cities, usually provincial capitals. Although students who were not local were provided with their board, the decision to establish Escuelas Secundarias Básicas in el Campo or ESBECs (Basic secondary schools in the countryside) might have been motivated by a desire to offer specialized sports training to more students in rural or sparsely populated areas. These sports schools in rural areas were established so that students could also take part in agricultural labor, thereby receiving a more comprehensive education and developing a respect for manual as well as mental labor. A sports center, the Concentrado Deportívo, was even established to meet the needs of students on the Isle of Youth.\n\nThe ESBECs with sports emphasis operate parallel with the EIDEs. Students range in age from twelve to fifteen years old. In each ESBEC, there are usually about 500 students, although there were 1,082 students in 1979 in Las Tunas. In ESBECs, as in other sports schools, the physical condition and biotype of students is assessed, and only selected students are accepted. Like the mostly urban-based pre-EIDEs, the ESBECs are intended to provide facilities at a local level, but in rural, not urban areas.\n\nOne ESBEC in Santiago de Cuba was made into a micro-EIDE. This school took from seventh- to ninth-grade students and gave preference to those from rural areas. Why this change was made, or whether other ESBECs were or will be converted to micro-EIDES is unknown.\n\nAnother school similar to the EIDEs, the micro-EIDEs, and the ESBECs, was the concentrado deportivo on the Isle of Youth. Originally an ESBEC, this school became the Mijail Frunze Concentrado Deportivo. In 1977, there were 396 students aged from twelve to fifteen. Their days were long-fourteen hours of classes and work, including agricultural labor. There were forty-four teachers, twenty-four sports trainers, and fifteen apprentice sports trainers. Sixteen sports were practiced. There are at least twenty-eight specialized schools on the Isle of Youth, many with sports facilities especially for rowing, kayaking, canoeing, and water sports.\n\nGraduates from Mijail Frunze as well as the micro-EIDEs, EIDEs, and ESBECs could then attend one of several higher-level sports schools.\n\nEscuela Superior de Perfeccionamiento Atlkico, or ESPA\n\nThe Escuela Superior de Perfeccionamiento Adetico (Higher school of athletic perfection), or ESPA, was established in the early: 1960s in Havana. It underwent a major reconstruction for use in the World Youth Festival that was held in Cuba in 1978. According to Hector Rodriguez Cordoso, who defected to the United States, ESPA is based in the old Cubanacan Country Club and provides athletes with special treatment such as extra food, clothing, and high-quality housing.\n\nIn a sense, the EIDEs and the other sports schools serve as a sort of Afarm system for this next level of training. From ESPA come all the teams that represent Cuba in international competition. It is the culmination of the movement from mass participation toward expertise in a sport. This scientific process of development or training cycle never takes less than six years or more than ten. And, as at all levels of development, there are more athletes than necessary chosen for this elite school. This prevents an attitude of complacency. A student is never allowed to take for granted a team position that he may hold at one time. He must continue to work for it.\n\nThree students from ESPA (en route to a basketball tournament in Poland) described a typical day. After breakfast (of better food than that served in the regular schools), they studied academic subjects from 8:00 A.M. until 1:00 P.m. The afternoon and early evening were reserved for practice and training in each individual sport.\n\nIn 1975, 126 students graduated from ESPA, including the sprinter Silvio Leonard. The content of the courses and the training provided have not been released. In 1985, a law was passed requiring trainers at ESPA and the National Training Center Cerro Pelado to hold a bachelor's degree in physical culture. Later that year, more legislation required trainers at ESPA to be high-level graduates from a special sports area.\n\nBy 1979, the first of several provincial ESPAs was established in Pinar del Rio. There were 62 teachers and 40 sports trainers who taught 389 students specializing in a choice of 19 sports. In the 1980s, four more provincial ESPAs were opened to cater to more top athletes. Yet, the ESPAs, like the EIDEs, were criticized for failing to develop their full potential.\n\nTHE TRAINING OF SPORTS PERSONNEL\n\nInstitfito Superior de Cultura Ffsica, or ISCF\n\nWith a countrywide emphasis upon sports participation for the masses, it is essential that INDER have enough qualified instructors, trainers, and other personnel to meet the need. In 1959, the new revolutionary government had faced a dearth of physical education teachers, and in 1963, Manuel Fajardo was created to fill this need. At first, this school for training PE teachers was designed to train as many people as quickly as possible, and the first class numbered seven hundred students.\n\nBy 1970, Cuba had begun to construct similar institutions in the provinces. With the growth of these, Manuel Fajardo was upgraded to the Escuela Superior de Educacion Fisica Comandante Manuel Fajardo (Higher school for physical education), or ESEF. Between 1963 and 1973, there were sixteen hundred graduates from ESEF. After the initial short courses, regular courses of three and a half years' duration were organized and included studies in the theory and practice of sports and recreation. Entry requirements in 1966 included completion of basic secondary school, proof of age (between fifteen and twenty-five), and a health certificate, as well as evidence of having been a sports monitor in a regular school. Further prerequisites included, of course, proof of athletic experience and ability and evidence of participation in a revolutionary organization, such as a CDR.\n\nIn 1973, the ESEF was upgraded to university level and changed its name to the Instituto Superior de Cultura Fisica, or ISCF. Within the next two years it began to offer correspondence courses (1975) and evening classes (1974). In 1977, ISCF affiliates were opened in six provinces to provide similar studies outside Havana. In 1982, there were seven Filiales. In the 1980s, postgraduate courses were also offered. The course at ISCF was extended to five years in 1982 and, by 1985, 4,452 students had graduated from the tertiary level.\n\nEntry to ISCF is apparently not easy. Students need a 90 per. cent grade average and superior athletic ability. The domination of the ISCF team in national tertiary-level competitions suggests that the conditions on athletic ability are strictly enforced.53 ISCF graduates are also well placed to gain the best employment positions in physical culture. Presumably, trainers in ESPAs and in the National Training Center Cerro Pelado (who are required to have physical culture degrees) are ISCF graduates. It is likely that, increasingly, INDER officials will be ISCF graduates.\n\nMost new ISCF students have already spent four years in an EPEF, and therefore receive as many as nine years of specialized training in either sports, physical education, or recreation, and a sound general training in all three. Students also receive a tertiary education in general studies. In 1986, the ISCF included a Faculty for Workers (practicing teachers and trainers). Other facilities were the Armed Forces (FAR) Faculty; the Faculty of Postgraduate Studies; and the Faculty for High-Performance Athletes, which offered a special seven-year course for top athletes.\n\nAll students must take academic and physical culture courses (or cycles) as well as basic military training, and they have to present an investigative thesis. Students can specialize as a sports trainer (438 hours of classes) or in recreation and physical education (300 hours of classes and practical teaching in the countryside). The details of the 4,638-hour course for 1986-1987 included over two thousand hours of physical culture courses. The ISCF, like other sports institutions, has many sports facilities as well as access to those in the nearby Ciudad Deportiva.\n\nISCF produces highly trained physical culture specialists. It also provides vocational training for many of Cuba's top athletes, who may have already attended a sports school or other specialized training center for their particular sport.\n\nNational Training Centers\n\nCuba also established numerous sports academies to provide training for talented athletes. Before 1959, such academies had existed only for boxing and baseball, but similar academies for soccer, jai alai, swimming, volleyball, athletics, judo, basketball, fencing, wrestling, waterskiing, and kayaking were soon founded in 1959. By the end of 1959, there were 2,035 students in these various institutions. The number of academies grew throughout the island, and by the mid-1970s, each province had its own baseball academy. By 1987, there were 11,858 students in eleven provincial academies; 1,202 students in three juvenile national centers; and 885 students in four national centers.\n\nThe end of the 1970s saw the emergence of national schools for other sports as well, such as fencing, equestrian sports, aquatic sports, gymnastics, and sprinting. Other special centers were established also, such as the ASchool for Giants and the CEDA Manuel Permuy center (Experimental school for athletic development), in the city of Havana. The School for Giants began in April 1979 and had 123 students aged between 11 and 18; it offered training for very tall youngsters. The CEDA Manuel Permuy, in La Lisa Municipality, had 508 students aged between 11 and 13 in 1978, one year after it opened. This center assessed the physical qualities of its students and analyzed diet, metabolism, and related functions. The course involved 850 hours of classes, taught by 12 teachers, including 100 hours of physical activities in a program that also included work, social work, and military training. These two centers are indicative of Cuba's growing emphasis on scientific approaches toward the detection of sports ability.\n\nBesides sports schools and academies, some of Cuba's vocational schools have excellent sports facilities. Included among these was the Maximo Gomez Vocational School, with two gymnasia, an athletic track, and a baseball field, as well as basketball and volleyball courts. High priority was also placed on providing swimming pools in vocational schools. The most famous vocational school in Cuba, however, had perhaps the best sports facilities outside of the specialized sports schools. The Lenin School, established at the suggestion of Fidel Castro, is in an area of 300,000 square meters near the Lenin Park in Havana and had about 4,500 students in 1974. Facilities include saunas, two Olympic pools, a diving tank, ten basketball courts, ten volleyball courts, three baseball diamonds, two tennis courts, a fencing center, and a gymnastics hall. The Lenin School is also mysteriously absent from public tours of Cuba's other showcase facilities, such as the Havana Psychiatric Hospital and Ciudad Deportiva.\n\nIn addition to these centers and sports institutions, special training and medical supervision is also available through the sports unit of the Revolutionary Armed Forces.\n\nEPEF's\n\nAt all levels, the Cubans take the training of a PE teacher very seriously. According to Cuban journalist Maria Elena Gil:\n\nIt is not the only objective of the EPEFs to create teachers who impart sports knowledge to their students. The professor of physical education that INDER proposes to forge, in conjunction with MINED, should be one who forms the youth of tomorrow, a complete guide who knows to include in his method of teaching the practice of sport, the assimilation of the habits of discipline, of conscience, will and perseverance that ought to unite all athletes and all revolutionary youth in general.\n\nToday, ISCF trains the PE professors at the highest levels, while the EPEFs concentrate on producing middle-level technicians. Graduates from ISCF, all of whom have mastered the three areas of sports, physical education, and recreation, number over a thousand per year.\n\nThose EPEFs located in the provinces are called Escuelas Provincial de Educacion Fisica or EPEFs. By 1983, there were eight EPEFs. In the 1977-1978 course, there were 6,664 students in the EPEFs, including 2,051 undertaking practical teaching experience. The students usually ranged in age from 13 to 18 years, but older, practicing PE teachers could also study at EPEF, while also receiving their full salary.\n\nESBEC graduates were given preference in these teacher-training schools, presumably with the intention that they would return to their rural districts to teach after graduating. In 1975, entrance to primary-level teacher-training courses was opened to males who were from 13 to 14 years old and to females who were from 13 to 16 years old. Students must have completed the seventh grade, without any failures. For secondary school teacher training, students must be between 13 and 14 for males and between 13 and 18 for females. They are required to have completed ninth grade, without any failures. In 1979, prospective students also needed to have passed LPV tests and be good at sports. By 1981, students also needed to pass a medical test and a personal interview, in addition to obtaining a 160 point grade average (presumably out of a maximum 200) in seventh and eighth grades. The usual maximum age was also lowered to 16, although 17-year-olds from rural areas were still considered.\n\nThe four- or five-year course at EPEF includes practical teaching experience for half of each academic year from the second year onwards. This experience is typically undertaken in an isolated school, thus providing PE teachers (albeit inexperienced) in regions where they might not choose to work permanently. Courses at the EPEFs include general academic subjects and pedagogy, as well as training in sports, popular physical culture, or recreation. The EPEF in Holguin, for example, teaches topics such as Spanish, English, mathematics, physics, chemistry, history of physical education, Marxism, morphology, physiology, psychology, theory and methods, pedagogy, and sports medicine, in addition to practical classes in at least seventeen different sports. Upon graduating from such a program, students are full-fledged PE teachers, prepared to enter, if desired, studies at ISCF. Beginning in 1980-1981, EPEF graduates emerged with a specialization in two sports. In addition, work toward the diploma includes a work notebook, in which the student records his completion of up to ten different projects, six of which are obligatory. Students must also complete an investigative work, addressing solutions to some fundamental problems that Cuba faces in physical education and sports.\n\nEven though students training to be PE teachers do not have to be world-class athletes, they are organized to continuously hone their own skills. Inter-EPEF games, held nationally, also underscore the emphasis on competition:\n\nThe end result of this meeting is that the future professors can practically apply, for themselves, the theoretical-tactical knowledge that was given to them in the halls of [EPEF]. One cannot conceive, for example, of a swimming trainer who is not an acceptable swimmer... Further, they constitute a valuable stimulus for the students to practice sport daily.\n\nEPEFs also served as centers for the provincial sports medicine institutes and for Unidades Docentes or Filiales of the ISCF. These provincial centers offered some of the services available in the main institutions in Havana.\n\nIn terms of facilities, ISCF (ESEF), EPEFs and ESPA have the most advanced facilities and equipment, which are usually not available for public use. In Santiago de Cuba, the EPEF (with a 1,0001,500 student capacity) has a twenty-five-meter pool, diving tank, water-polo pool, plus the use of the INDER-Santiago facilities, located adjacent to the school in the Guillermon Moncada Stadium. This includes one of the two tracks on the entire island with a Rekortan surface, imported from East Germany.\n\nInternational Exchange\n\nThe ISCF and the EPEFs now train PE instructors at the university and postgraduate level. But this is a relatively recent development. Prior to 1972, these facilities served to provide the country with as many middle-level technicians as possible, just to ameliorate the tremendous lack of qualified teachers that existed in the cities and throughout the countryside.\n\nAccording to Juan Kindelan, an official with INDER-Santiago, when he was in school it was necessary to go abroad. He obtained his master's degree in East Germany. This problem is slowly being addressed. (With the closing of opportunities to study in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, due to the massive changes in these nations, the necessity to develop an independent training capacity within Cuba has become paramount.) By August 1980, there were twenty-three doctoral candidates enrolled at ISCF. By 1990, there were fifty doctoral students.\n\nIf instructors for the primary levels did not exist, then there would be no specialists in particular sports capable of training the best athletes. And the Cubans were unwilling to wait the twenty years required to develop their own expertise in the various athletic fields. Help came in the form of coaches and trainers from other countries, especially from the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. AThere are many cases of proletarian internationalism in sport.\n\nAccording to Jorge Garcia Bango, former director of INDER, AWe pay whatever is necessary to bring them, to arrange for foreign coaches. The Soviet Union, East Germany, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary have all provided Cuba with the greatest technical assistance. Andrei Chervonenko of the Soviet Union has trained, in the past, Teofilo Stevenson, Orlando Martinez, and other Cuban boxers. The Hungarian Karoly Laky worked with the Cuban water-polo team, which is now one of the best in the world. Alberto Juantorena received the able coaching of the late Zigmunt Zabierzowski, who returned to Poland after seeing his charge through two gold medals in Montreal. In 1967, Soviet gymnastics coach Zinaida Podolskaya went to Cuba to help with the women's gymnastics movement there. She was soon followed by Diana Sivolcava and Maria Vinogradova (Zaitseva). Evgenii Vov and Alberto Aznavurian also worked on the gymnastics program. Leonid Shcherbakov, Soviet Olympic triple jumper, coached Pedro Perez Duenas and other Cubans until 1976. Evgenii Cheroposki worked with Eduardo John on the fencing foil. Nikolai Durnev went with the Cuban marksmen to the twentieth Olympics in Munich. Leonid Gusevski also worked with the marksmen. Yuri Zamiatin helped develop wrestling, and Stephen Boutatas coached the basketball team that won third place in Munich. Other names include Valentin Samkhvolov, for track and field; Vasilii Romanov, for boxing; Evgenii Boechin, for cycling; Yuri Melnikov, for diving; Chitov Viatcheslav, for physical culture; Oleg Pozanov and Igor Isakov, for fencing; Evgenii Matseev, Vladimir Medvediev, and Vasilii Muraviov in ISCF; Anotolii Nikonov and Oleg Stokin, for gymnastics; Evgenii Rysin, for weightlifting; Yuri Ribalko, for wrestling; Yuri Stoida, Elena Matveva, and Nina Borozina on language translation. Florian Stoenescu of Romania worked with the handball team. In 1976, Yutsaka Matsudaira, coach of the Japanese volleyball team, gave a course at INDER for Cuban volleyball coaches and trainers.\n\nCubans have also been sent abroad, at times, to sharpen their coaching or athletic skills. Gymnastics coaches Juana Bravet Quesis and Verania Pinera both studied in the Soviet Union. Until recently, the only sports official in Cuba with a doctorate in the field, Hernandez Corbo, obtained his degree in Bulgaria. Often, the simple contact with other athletes serves as a training experience.\n\nAs the Cubans advanced, the network of foreign assistance began to flow in the other direction. In 1972, Cuban sprinter Enrique Figuerola coached Soviet athletes in Odessa and Minsk. Cuban coaches and trainers have been sent to Angola, Panama, Mexico, Jamaica, Guyana, and Chile. They were reportedly imprisoned by the junta after Allende's assassination in Chile in 1973. In 1976, Yugoslavia announced it was going to follow the \"Cuban recipe in training its boxers.\" In addition, Cuba encourages students from other countries to study at Manuel Fajardo (ISCF) on an exchange program. As of 1978, there were students from a number of other countries in Latin America and at least one student from the United States.\n\nIt is more important, perhaps, that Cuban coaches abroad are now earning valuable hard currency, which is pumped back into the state. In the 1970s, there were forty-two foreign coaches in Cuba. In 1992, there was only one for the Olympics, in archery. There are 150 Cuban coaches working throughout the world. Nine countries at Barcelona had Cuban boxing coaches, while others have hired Cubans in volleyball, weightlifting, track and field, and other sports.\n\nCuba established sports exchange programs with countries outside of Eastern Europe. These included Mexico, Canada, Algeria, Portugal, Nicaragua, Angola, Cape Verde, Jamaica, and Grenada, among others. Cuban sports specialists worked in thirty-three foreign countries, and foreign students were given places in the ISCF and in the EPEFs.\n\nTHE SCIENTIFIC SYSTEM\n\nRecruitment and Selection\n\nThere has been no attempt to keep the dual goal of the Cuban sports program a secret. Above all, for purposes of mental and physical health, recreation, and general well-being, sports should play a part in the life of every Cuban. The most effective way to instill this desire for physical activity is through the PE program. Castro described how the more talented athletes will emerge from the resulting mass movement in sports:\n\nOne day we shall have thousands of young people studying physical education, excellent sports facilities in all schools, and interschool competitions as a means of selection. However, there is more to it than selection, for sport should be pursued not just to win competitions. Competitions are important; but there is something more important-sport as a cultural and recreational activity for the people. Of course, if everybody practices a sport, if all children pursue a sport, we shall have champions.\n\nIn fact, each goal merely serves to feed the other. The more people who participate in sports, the greater the chance for true talent to develop and be discovered. The subsequent success that such talent achieves serves as a strong stimulus to encourage even more people to become actively involved in sports. This point was made clearly by Jose Ramon Fernandez Alvarez, former vice-president of the Council of Ministers, minister of Culture, Sports, and Education, and member of the Politburo until the 1991 congress, when he greeted the Cuban athletes returning from Moscow:\n\nThese successes [in the 1980 Olympics] should be a stimulus for people so that in the future the base of the pyramid is broadened, with each Cuban being able to demonstrate his or her true abilities, and among all the people-among those hundreds of thousands of young people, students and workers from the cities and the countryside-we can choose those with the best qualifications to go to the Olympics.\n\nWith a national population smaller than that of New York, London, or Tokyo, Cuba can hardly afford not to consider all possibilities for development, in its search for talent. The Cubans claim to know a child's best sport by the time that child is nine years old. Yet, it is in their best interests to be open-minded about the selection process. The well-organized system of evaluation they have-in both the physical efficiency tests and the different levels of competition-serves as a fine-mesh net, ready to catch any late developers who exhibit their talent later in life, and in some cases, athletes who may have been funneled into the wrong sport.\n\nThe recent change in the organization of the School Games to keep the regular schools and the EIDEs separate was certainly a calculated move. More time and attention are thus given to young athletes who are not students at an EIDE. Experience has already taught the Cubans that there is a wealth of talent hidden in these students. Among those who have been Adiscovered at the School Games are names such as Urrutia, Duenas, Leonard, Puente, Casanas, Romero, Chivas, Caridad Colon, Delis, and Despaigne. \"[The School Games] are considered a furnace from which are forged the future members of the national teams.\"\n\nThe emphasis on competition extends past the educational system. In 1976, 6,000 people participated in the Family Games, which are handicapped according to age. There were almost 600,000 participants in the 1976 Workers' Games, 105,000 of which were women. By the mid-1970s, more than one-quarter of the population engaged in INDER-sponsored competition in more than twenty sports. These contests provide a tremendous source of recreation, both passive and active, for the Cuban people.\n\nSelection and Training\n\nIt is instructive to look more closely at the selection process by which national athletes are chosen and the methods by which they are trained. The process by which the more talented athletes are selected out for more intensive training has evolved, with time and experience, into a scientific procedure. All children are evaluated when they are quite young, and at frequent intervals as they grow and develop. In addition, the network of competition, within school and outside of it, helps INDER officials to catch potential talent that they may have missed in the individual evaluations. These officials are trained for several purposes. One group serves as talent scouts out in the field, while the other group works on the more scientific, research side of selection. These research people report to the talent scouts out in the field which scientific measures they should be looking for; if biotype A or biotype B correlates higher with this or that sport, for example; or which type of muscle fiber makes a better sprinter or a better distance athlete, and which athlete has which type. If, after a number of years and frequent evaluations, the athlete still exhibits potential talent, he will be sent to ESPA for training, in order to represent his country in international competition. The older competitors remain students at ESEF while they continue their training.\n\nWhen asked about his specific training regimen, Alberto Juantorena has said more than once that it is a Astate secret. And one begins to believe it, from the amount of information available on the subject. In direct imitation of the former East German and Soviet systems, the Cubans are attempting to give athletic training a scientific base. There is also a strong effort to draw on as many scientific fields that could have any bearing on athletic activity as possible. For each sport, there is a scientific team, headed by a physician who is responsible for the care of the athletes in the sport, for the development of the sport, and presumably for breakthroughs in the selection process. The physician in charge of this group is one of the Atechnical members of the Agoverning body of the particular sport. Then each national team has a Coaching Committee, described by Ron Pickering:\n\nEvery national coach has direct contact with the Institute [of Sports Medicine) and the Coaching Committees which arrange the annual training program of each athlete or event group. The Coaching Committee consists of the national coach, a sports physician, a sports psychologist and a member of the technical committee of the governing body who knows the dates and venues of all fixtures.\n\nThe psychologist spends more time working with the coaches than with the athletes. According to officials at INDER-Santiago, he helps overcome the competition anxiety of both coaches and athletes. In addition, he serves to motivate and inspire, as well as to give relaxing exercises and the like. The increasingly scientific bent of INDER can be seen in the development of several of its newer departments. Within INDER is the Centro de Investigaciones a Informaci6n de Deporte (Center of investigation and information in sport) or CINID. There are two separate departments within CINID: one is the Centro de Computaci6n Estadistica y Matematica Aplicada (Center for statistical computation and applied mathematics), or CEMA. The function of the center has been described only very superficially in the Cuban press. CEMA keeps cards on all the athletes who make up the different levels of national teams. Records are kept of their various performances, and projections are made as to their progress in their different events. CEMA also keeps complete records of the performances of all the athletes who participate in the control. A control is a regularly scheduled contest of the upper level athletes, conducted under Ameet conditions. It serves as an evaluative measure for team and individual progress. It can also be useful in the selection of athletes for an international event, based on their performance in the control. This is especially true for sports in which progress is measured by time.\n\nThe other section of CINID is the Centro de Documentaci6n e Información Cientifico-Tecnica (Center for documentation and scientific and technical information), or CEDOC. CEDOC is concerned with information of a broader nature. Its purpose is to provide trainers and coaches with up-to-date information about progress in the various sports and, in particular, the achievements recorded by other countries in athletic endeavors and in training methods.\n\nAccording to Huberto Gil, former head of CINID, CEDOC serves as an invaluable information center. The statistics compiled and stored in CEMA enable sports officials to study the necessary data needed to train athletes more efficiently. By calling up on the computer the information stored on an athlete, a trainer can see the progression in the athlete's performance and training methods in relation to a specific block of time in order t"
