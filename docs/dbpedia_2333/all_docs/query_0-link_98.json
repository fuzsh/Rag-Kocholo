Writing about what I saw involved crossing many boundaries, disciplinary and otherwise. I could not even have begun, much less completed, this book had it not been for the generous institutional support I received and for the warmth and help of my family, friends, and colleagues, whom I take great pleasure in thanking here. For institutional support in Cuzco, I am grateful to the directors and archivists of the Archivo Departamental del Cusco, who helped me locate an abundance of relevant documents. I could not have read them all without Margareth Najarro Espinoza and Ingrid Patricia Vivanco Perez; my warmest thanks to them for their excellent research assistance. The camaraderie that formed among the researchers ranged around the tables of the archives in Cuzco was very special, and I want to thank my friends John Rowe and Patricia Lyon, Charles Walker, Marisa Remy, Thomas Kriiggeler, and Pedro Guibovich, who gave me invaluable help as I began, and David Garrett, Donato Amado and other members of the Taller de Historia Andina, Jean-Jacques Decoster, Carolyn Dean, Manuel Burga, Leo Garofalo, Neus Tur-Escandell, and Sabine MacCormack, who shared many ideas, archival leads, and coffee breaks with me. Madre Rosa Victoria Vega, prioress of Santa Catalina de Sena in Cuzco, gave me permission to consult colonial papers from her convent's archives, and her confidence and trust in me are deeply appreciated. I thank Madre Juana Marin Farfan, abbess of Santa Clara in Cuzco, for letting me consult her convent's early land titles, and I thank the directors and staff of the Archivo Arzobispal del Cuzco for facilitating my access to many pertinent records. I also relied on the fine library of the Centro de Estudios Regionales Andinos Bartolome\n\nde Las Casas in Cuzco; my thanks to the directors and staff of the Centro for their support. In Lima my oldest debts of gratitude are to the Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Peru and the Comision Fulbright. I especially want to thank Franklin and Mariana Pease and Marcia Koth de Paredes for their hospitality and for encouraging my earliest investigaciones. For helping me find useful sources in Lima, I am grateful to the directors and staff of the Archivo General de la Nacion, the Sala de Investigaciones of the Biblioteca Nacional del Peru, the Archivo Arzobispal de Lima, the Archivo de San Francisco, and the Archivo de Llmites del Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores. I am also indebted to Felix Denegri Luna, who gave me access to his extraordinary library of rare books. Much of the work on this project was done at Harvard University after my advisor, John Womack, Jr., encouraged me to develop a tangent-laden seminar paper on the mestizos of Santa Clara. I am very grateful to him for his wisdom and support in the years since then. I also thank Olwen Hufton, who was likewise generous with encouragement, and my fellow graduate students, especially Emilio Kouri, Elizabeth Fowler, Brodwyn Fischer, Aurora Gomez, and Renee Baernstein, who made doctoral studies much richer for me. During those years I became indebted to the work of Asuncion Lavrin and Jodi Bilinkoff, who became enthusiastic supporters of my work, and I thank them warmly for their help. I received summer travel funding from Radcliffe College and Harvard University, a Fulbright-Hays fellowship from the U. S. Department of Education for dissertation research in 1990-91, a grant from the Real Colegio Complutense for travel to Spain in 1992, and a Charlotte W. Newcombe fellowship from the Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation to complete my dissertation in 1992-93. Since joining the faculty of the University of Florida in Gainesville, I have also received generous assistance. Funding from the University of Florida allowed me to make two crucial research trips to Peru in the summers of 1994 and 1995 and to share portions of my work with scholars in Mexico City in the spring of 1995. Comments on my dissertation from John Rowe, Patricia Lyon, Arnold Bauer, and my Florida colleagues Murdo Macleod, Anna Peterson, and Carol Lansing greatly assisted my thinking about how to turn my dissertation into a book. A fellowship from the Shelby Cullom Davis Center for Historical Studies at Princeton University in 1995-96 enabled me to read more widely and rethink the implications of my work; I am very grateful x\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nto William Chester Jordan, Natalie Zemon Davis, Stanley Stein, Jeremy Cohen, Penny von Eschen, Kevin Gaines, Kari Hoover, and my fellow Davis Center fellows for making my Princeton stay so productive, and to my Florida colleague Louise Newman for her invaluable criticism and generous support during that year. As I have begun circulating my work more Widely, many students and colleagues have given me constructive readings and ideas, and I want to express my sincere thanks to them for their help-particularly to Rebecca Karl and Mark Thurner for their stimulating intellectual company. It has been a pleasure to bring out this book with Duke University Press. I am especially grateful to my editor, Valerie Millholland, for her patience, responsiveness, and good humor, and to my readers for the press, Brooke Larson and Charles Walker, whose inSightful suggestions greatly improved the book's final version. I thank copyeditor Charles Purrenhage for his careful work, and managing editor Jean Brady and her staff for making the production process swift and smooth. I would also like to thank Duke University Press for permission to present here, as Chapter I, a slightly revised version of my article \"Gender and the Politics of Mestizaje: The Convent of Santa Clara of Cuzco,\" Hispanic American Historical Review 78: I (February 1998). It is hard to know where to begin to thank the many other friends who have helped me during the last ten years. The companionship of Gabriela Martinez, Cesar Itier, Aurelia Fuertes, and those who came after them in the house on Saphy in Cuzco was vital to me during some trying times. For helping me to keep perspective on work and life, and to bridge the distances that separate Cuzco, Lima, and Gainesville, I am immensely grateful to Marisol de la Cadena, who has supported and inspired me since we roomed together on calle Suecia, and to Maria Emma Mannarelli, Kate Raisz, Stephanie Stewart, and Marianela Gibaja. I could not have completed this project without the intellectual companionship and love of Sheryl Kroen and Holly Hanson. Finally, I want to dedicate this book to my family. The patient, lOVing support of my parents, Ned and Martha Burns, my sister Stephanie, my brother Michael, and my dear friend Roland Greene has meant the world to me.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS xi\n\nIntroduction\n\nToday anyone who wants to see Santa Clara has to get up early in the morning. Situated in the heart of Cuzco's market district, the oldest cloistered convent in South America is definitely not a tourist attraction. Thousands of tourists a year trundle by on their way to catch the predawn train to the Inca ruins of Machu Picchu without giving the convent's old stone walls so much as a sleepy glance. The church of Santa Clara opens for mass only briefly as day breaks and vendors begin stirring the market to life. After the small group of worshippers departs, the front gates are locked, leaving only an inconspicuous side door to admit the occasional visitor or deliveryman. Meanwhile the streets outside fill with lively exchanges: bargaining, buying, the comings and goings of maids and stoop-backed porters. By midmorning vendors have completely outfitted the perimeter of Santa Clara with the multicolored canvas of their market stalls, and from the vantage point of the street outside, the old convent practically disappears. It is hard to imagine that the nuns were once at the center of city life. Now that the market and the convents turn their backs to each other, and commerce and spirituality seem to go separate ways, it is easy to think this was always the case and that cloistered nuns in general were always withdrawn, \"in this world but not of it.\" The historiography of the colonial and postcolonial Andes does little to contradict these impressions. Convents are marginalized mostly by omission.! To the extent that nuns and convents have been written about, the point has often been more hagiographical than historiographical: to praise the monjitas for their edifying example.2 The fascinating involvement of cloistered women in everything from conquest to the making of postcolonial nations has in the process been set aside, and the axis of\n\nâ¢\n\nHuamanga (Ayacucho)\n\nâ¢ Cuzco PER U\n\n'\n\n..,\n\n.,;-\n\nj~ake ,oop6 Potosi\n\nâ¢\n\nFig. 1. Map of southern colonial Peru, formerly the heartland of the Inca state of Tahuantinsuyo\n\nunderstanding stood on end, the grasping of a (seemingly timeless) spiritual essence privileged over the investigation of local histories. Yet if we take some cues from the colonial nuns' contemporaries, it is readily possible to imagine things otherwise. Consider, for example, that Santa Clara was one of the first institutions the conquistadores of Cuzco decided they needed once their conquest of the Inca city was more or less secure-and that the six-year-old daughter of an Inca ruler was among the convent's first entrants. When Dominican nuns founded Santa Catalina in Cuzco half a century later, in 1605, they built atop the site of the acIIahuasi, once home to virginal young women dedicated to serving the ruling Inca. 3 Thereafter both cloisters would receive numerous \"Indian nobles,\" daughters of the indigenous elite whose collaboration made possible Spain's indirect rule over the Andes. A third convent, Santa Teresa, was approved by the Habsburg bureaucracy after it was determined that Cuzco's two existing convents were bursting with women: not only the nuns, but hundreds of servants, children of all ages, and slaves. Clearly the colonial nuns' contemporaries knew what we have all but forgotten: that convents were vital to the securing of Spanish hegemony in Peru and to the erecting of a colonial regime on Inca foundations. The three colonial convents of Cuzco - Santa Clara (1558), Santa Catalina (1605), and Santa Teresa (1673)-have been in continuous 2\n\nCOLONIAL HABITS\n\nexistence ever since. Today their communities are much smaller than they once were (around twenty to thirty women each), but their central locations and imposing structures reflect the place they formerly occupied in the imaginative and practical geography of the city. Santa Clara and Santa Catalina were Cuzco's conventos grandes after the fashion of the largest, most aristocratic European convents of their day: virtual cities within the city, places where (to borrow a chronicler's description of one of Lima's convents) \"the site is so large that if a servant flees from her mistress, it may be days before she is found, because there are streets, and neighborhoods, like a town.\" 4 From the sixteenth century well into the nineteenth century, these imposing institutions were central to the way local people produced and reproduced themselves. Cuzquelios invested heavily in their convents. For centuries they sent their daughters (sometimes formally, sometimes furtively) to be raised and educated in the cloisters, paying dowry for their daughters, sisters, and cousins who professed. Nuns, in turn, invested heavily in local people, spending long hours praying for their souls and loaning them funds from convent coffers. The credit the nuns extended -mostly through contracts that have been out of use so long they have become notarial relics-enabled propertied cuzquenos to conduct thriving businesses and still avoid the moral traps of usury. The result of centuries of accretion of such practices was that cuzquenos-principally but not exclusively the region's elites-created for themselves a dense weave (as we will see) of historically specific kinds of exchanges that were indissociably economic and spiritual, distinctly colonial, and utterly habitual. The making of this early modern tapestry, this dense network of interests and investments, is my subject, and I have chosen to call it Cuzco's spiritual economy. I do so to denote the inextricability of the material and the sacred, relying on a very old sense of \"economy\" as the managing of a house (Greek oikos) and pointing to the spiritual goals orienting such activity. In this kind of economy, spiritual \"goods\" circulated and might be bought for money with no perceived contamination or contradiction. In Cuzco, for example, prayers were once routinely bought and sold in very precise terms, and no one with enough income thought twice about endowing a clergyman with a certain amount of pesos per year to say a specific number of prayers. And nuns might seize the collateral property of a debtor and note simply that it \"was spiritualized\" (qued6 espiritualizada).5 I am asking after the history in which such things were simply common sense. In short, INTRODUCTION\n\n3\n\nI am investigating a colonial habitus: the\" generative principle of regulated improvisions\" that Pierre Bourdieu describes as the \"immanent law\" of a group or class, producing its common sense, the \"conductorless orchestration\" of its practices.6 Nuns were of course not the only ones who recreated and moved authoritatively within this habitus. But their own accounts of their activities are few, fragmentary, and inaccessible-part of the reason historians have almost invariably depicted nuns, if at all, as decidedly off to one side of the main colonial action. My telling gives Cuzco's nuns the leading parts. And in these introductory pages I will sketch the consequences of this move to make cloistered women the center of things. From the vantage point of the convent, each major period of Cuzco's storied past looks significantly different, its actors and aspects more connected. We can see the forging of a distinctly colonial elite-a hybrid provincial aristocracy whose members cultivated a profound attachment to the Inca past, even as they were riven by deep, increasingly \"racialized\" divisions. And as I hope will become clear, the legacies or habits of colonialism lingered long, shaping Peruvian postcoloniality-the \"imagined community\" of a new, secularizing Peruvian republic. 7 By considering nuns' agency we get to see this longue duree of the social reproduction of power and privilege. The insights gained here can be extended well beyond the bounds of the Andes, to the relationships articulated by convents across much of Europe, the colonial Americas, and beyond.8\n\n* * * First, some notes on the making of this version of the cloistered past. When I began research in r988-90, fascinated with the seeming paradox of Santa Clara's founding, I planned to do a tightly focused case study of the Clares' earliest years. Why a convent, of all things, in the midst of Spanish wars of colonial expansion? How, in a century or less, had Santa Clara changed from an impoverished orphanage for mestizas into a wealthy, stratified haven for criolIas? I expected to see pieces of the story narrated by the nuns themselves, for I knew from important work in recent years on convents from Mexico City to Avila that nuns did make narratives (often of their own lives, at the urging of their confessors: hence the hagiographical genre of the vidar I hoped I might locate nuns' vidas, perhaps refracted in the prism of baroque compositions like those of the extraordinary Mexican nun Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz (r648?-9S).\n\n4 COLONIAL HABITS\n\nI eventually found answers to my questions, and along the way located fascinating traces of the lives of hundreds of nuns. Instead of meeting Sor Juana in the archives, however, I encountered (over and over again) the Spanish-Andean counterparts of Bartleby the Scrivener -the copyists and notaries whose elaborate procedural template shaped many if not most of the documents in Peru's rich colonial archives. lO The hand of Cuzco's notaries seemed to be everywhere. When I eventually gained some access to the colonial papers of Santa Clara and Santa Catalina, these too turned out to be mostly Bartleby's work: they consisted overwhelmingly of notarial instruments of one kind or another, sales and wills and leases and rentals, most dating from the late seventeenth century or after. ll Thus I met the nuns of Cuzco mainly at the points of their intersection with the secular world they called el siglo. Put a different way, I met Sor Juana's lesser-known side, for she was often treasurer of her community, known for her agility at handling her convent's financial affairs.12 And I could not help but notice that the nuns were actively undoing the categories and concepts many scholars have used to describe them: \"repositories\" of excess daughters; \"islands of liberated women.\" The seeming dichotomy of conventual insiders and outsiders came further undone the more I read. Clearly these women were running their communities' affairs very much along the lines Asunci6n Lavrin disclosed in her pathbreaking studies of the financial activities of Mexico City convents. 13 So I changed the design of my project. My questions about the founding of Santa Clara remained, but my investigations expanded to include all three of Cuzco's convents and assumed a different temporal frame: a truly longue duree spanning several centuries. By keeping periodization simple here, framing things on the conventional arc of a rise and fall, I hope to provoke and focus reflection elsewhere-on the intensity of engagement between and among historical actors practicing their everyday rites and negotiations, and on the meanings of these practices. My focus is thus on what Michel de Certeau has called \"the practice of everyday life\": everyday colonial life and its legacies. 14 By showing at this level how the \"spiritual\" pervades the \"economic,\" and vice versa, I hope to expand our notions of both. Here \"production\" and \"reproduction\" become inseparable. They are not merely two sides of the same coin; they are the same coin, the very alloyed stuff of it. This insight enables us to recast even some of the most stock actors\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n5\n\nand activities of colonial history while adding new ones to the repertory. Conquistadores are featured here as anxious fathers, for example, painstakingly shaping their lineages along with their fortunes; chaste, cloistered women appear as purposeful dealmakers, creating fruitful, productive relationships with uncloistered men and women through the conduit of credit. We get to see, in and through the convents, the creation of both material and symbolic capital. Gender becomes an indispensable tool at this everyday, practical level of historical analysis. For while men's and women's religious houses relied on many of the same customs and credit mechanisms, their practice of religious poverty was different, and distinctly gendered. Women, unlike men, formally entered the religious life through the trope of marriage. A nun was symbolically a bride who pledged fidelity to a divine spouse and brought a dowry to sustain her in spiritual matrimony. Understanding this trope reshapes our image of convent life as apart from, and opposed to, marriage and family life: we can reimagine the colonial nun's profession as a kind of marriagea spiritual marriage to Jesus, involving a careful economic calculus and uniting the nun's family with the convent community in a richly Significant bond. The study of convents thus contributes to our understanding of gender, family life, marriage, and motherhood. Moreover, I hope to contribute here to resolving what has been identified as a weakness of \"practice studies\" (and of cultural history more generally): namely, such histories' ability to explain how, when, and why things change. Cuzco's convents, studied over several centuries, show remarkable practical and discursive continuities, but also disclose large, tectonic shifts. Gradually keywords emerged, and I began to see long-term patterns in their usage: dominio, an ancient term signifying \"sovereignty\" and linked to the strange, mutable history of property; forastera, \"outsider\" or \"foreigner,\" an espeCially polyvalent term in the Andes for designating one's Others; and libertad, \"liberty,\" a term people seemed to use more frequently by the turn of the nineteenth century to speak about something they felt they needed but did not have. And sites emerged: especially the convent Iocutorio, or visitor's parlor. In this book I work these practices, sites, and keywords together in an archivally informed - necessarily provisionalinterpretation of Cuzco's spiritual economy. I suggest historical reasons why its workings, once entirely logical to cuzquenos and central to their well-being, came by the nineteenth century to represent an\n\n6\n\nCOLONIAL HABITS\n\nirrational burden and a fetter to their liberty, and how in that process nuns lost a great amount of cultural authority.\n\n* * * Some results of this study are unique to Cuzco, where for centuries convents were a crucial site of Spaniards' struggles to contain and control Incas, and of Incas' struggles for self-definition and authority. However, this study also offers important new insights into the workings of colonialism more generally-particularly the economic logic and the gender politics at work in the creation and reproduction of a colonial elite. Those engaged in theorizing the intersections of gender, race, and class will find much of interest here. So, too, will those interested in the major periods and themes of colonial Latin American and Andean history, from conquest and mestizaje to late colonial crises and the making of republican nations. In the pages that follow I signal the aims and contributions of each chapter and locate them in the context of relevant historiographies. Chapter I unfolds the paradox of Santa Clara's founding in Cuzco during the ISSOS. As we will see, the city was still caught up in intrigues and vicious fighting. What led Spaniards to create a convent in such an agitated time and place? Their recorded desire was to protect mestizas - daughters of Spanish men and Andean women - by separating the girls from their Andean mothers and raising them amidst Spanish religion and customs. Situating these founding acts in their charged political context, I argue that in these crucial years Cuzco's leading Spaniards saw in their daughters-and not, Significantly, in their mestizo sons-a means of ensuring their own reproduction as well as that of the Spanish city they were trying to erect. In Chapter I, then, we explore not only the founding of South America's first convent, but the complicated history of mestizaje. This chapter also contributes to the study of \"spiritual conquest\" by suggesting that cloistered women played a vital part in the Christianization of the Andes. Chapter 2 also starts with a paradox, this time concerning property: Santa Clara by the IS60s had acqUired local assets rivaling those of the region's encomenderos. How was this possible, if nuns were supposed to be poor? The Clares' rules did not prohibit the nuns from holding assets collectively, and I suggest we view their religious poverty as a gendered practice, predicated on strict enclosure, male proxies, and a measure of collective prosperity. Drawing on trial records-\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n7\n\nparticularly land disputes from the 1550S over \"lands of the Inca and the Sun\" - I examine the nuns' role in acquiring, and imposing, private property in the Andes. Local ethnic lords (kurakas) resisted their claims through the Spanish legal system. Underlying these conflicts were profoundly divergent cultural goals, and resolving them required the parties to engage in contentious rounds of thoroughly hybridized negotiations. Thus the nuns, in the process of staking their claims, helped not only to consolidate a new understanding of \"property\" in the Andes but to privilege a new set of local lords: culturally ambidextrous kurakas and criollos. Chapter 3 uses the unusual case of Santa Catalina to explore the limits and contingencies of the spiritual economy, a distinctly local construct predicated on the relative stability of the assets it attached. In 1605, the Dominican nuns of Santa Catalina migrated across the Andes from Arequipa to Cuzco after natural disasters destroyed their property base. Cuzquefios greeted the nuns cordially at the end of their hard journey, but regarded them as outsiders, forasteras. Finding new supporters and resources took the Dominicans years of diligent effort. Eventually they succeeded in remaking themselves convincingly into cuzquefias. They achieved this in part by taking in a female descendant of the Incas-thus symbolically, if belatedly, participating in the project undertaken by the Clares a half-century earlier, that of containing politically significant, thus potentially dangerous, Inca children. By the time a seismic disaster hit Cuzco in 1650, Santa Catalina had struck sufficiently deep roots in the city to remain where it was: atop the old Inca acllahuasi. Chapters 4 and 5 treat the late-seventeenth-century zenith of the complex relationships that constituted Cuzco's spiritual economy. Daily life inside the cloisters is explored in Chapter 4; I show how, within Santa Clara and Santa Catalina, the nuns created and maintained their own thriving households (complete with children, servants, and slaves), redefining the institutions of marriage and family to meet their purposes. They also created a strongly hierarchical order that placed criollas and Spaniards at the top of the convents' affairs and relegated kurakas' daughters to a lower status. Andean elites thus could not aspire to see their daughters ascend to positions of control over important convent business. Instead, their daughters inhabited the middle ranks of the convent hierarchy; with the nuns' numerous servants and slaves, they made up the vast majority of the inhabitants of Cuzco's conventos\n\n8\n\nCOLONIAL HABITS\n\ngrandes-houses grown so capacious and boisterous by the 1670S that cuzquenos moved to create a third, more austere Carmelite convent, Santa Teresa. Chapter 5 details the cultural and economic circuitry that made it possible for all three convents to deploy their assets in the local economy in ways that facilitated the nuns' collective prosperity as well as the spiritual health of their benefactors. Debt created relationships: it made important, mutually sustaining bonds, not simply burdens. Together with the previous chapter, Chapter 5 advances my argument that Cuzco's convents played a vital role in the creation of a divided colonial elite: propertied criollos on the one hand; propertied Inca nobles and kurakas on the other. For the nuns forged relationships with both-accepting their daughters, extending them credit, and praying for the good of their souls. This important new perspective helps us to understand why, for centuries, kurakas consented to act as linchpins of Spanish colonial rule, even as it impoverished their communities and produced clearly discriminatory treatment of their daughters. Convents gave these indigenous members of Cuzco's elite access to credit, that all-important element of colonial enterprises of every sort. We thus gain new insight into the symbiotic arrangements that underwrote Spanish colonial rule - and the high cost at which they operated. By the early eighteenth century, however, these relationships were showing clear signs of trouble. In Chapter 6, I consider several developments that gradually undermined the nuns' position over the course of the century, including mounting pressures for ecclesiastical and imperial reform, a surfeit of debt in the region, and the massive Tupac Amaru rebellion of 1780-81. Slowly, almost imperceptibly, the place of convents changed: their perceived wealth -long a sign to cuzquenos of their city's and their society's spiritual health - came into question, and the propertied classes that for centuries had supported the nuns were increasingly convinced that the \"dead hand\" of the church was responSible for agricultural stagnation. I explore the ironies and contradictions of the nuns' late colonial predicament and show how the perspective of convent finance enables us to trace out a new level of instability underlying Peru's late colonial crises. Chapter 7 investigates the language and stakes of secularization in postcolonial Cuzco.

The nuns defended themselves vigorously in this vehement war of words, but their communities shrank and their structures began to crumble around them. All the while, cuzqueiios came to see activities long controlled by the church-charity, the care of orphans, children's education-as responsibilities of the new Peruvian state. Thus there were few protests (except, of course, from the nuns) when Cuzco's convents were partially expropriated to endow new republican institutions like the Colegio de Educandas, one of Peru's first state-sponsored schools for girls. Yet Cuzco's convents never closed, or were closed, down. Cuzqueiias continued to profess solemn vows and dedicate their lives to ancient rounds of prayer, even as their fellow citizens enacted land reforms, fought over the meaning of church and state, reinvented Inca traditions, and assisted ambivalently their city's transformation into an exoticized tourist destination, continually reconfiguring the terms of property, liberty, Indianness, and decency.15 None of this kept women from devoting themselves to spiritual matrimony inside Santa Clara, Santa Catalina, and Santa Teresa. Nor does it keep the occasional visi-\n\nIO\n\nCOLONIAL HABITS\n\ntor today from finding the convents' side doors after mass and entering. bearing small gifts for the nuns and perhaps a bit of news. These durable rounds disclose a spiritual economy that is still meaningful, if more inward in observance; they invite questions we have only begun to ask.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nII\n\nPart One\n\nFOUNDING ACTS No hay mas claridad que si nunca vieramos ... -Juan Polo de Ondegardo, 1571\n\nI\n\nGender and the Politics of Mestizaje\n\nWhen the city council of Cuzco met on April 17, 1551, its members, all battle-hardened Spanish veterans, were enjoying a respite from seemingly endless rounds of war. Soon they would pick up their weapons and charge back into battle, for the fighting in the strategic center of the Inca heartland of Tahuantinsuyo was far from over. But on April 17, the Spanish city fathers of Cuzco had other business on their minds. That day they decided to buy a piece of city property and found a cloistered nunnery. Two weeks later, on April 30, the price of the property was donated by councilman Diego Maldonado \"el Rico,\" a shrewd survivor of many battles and the wealthiest Spaniard in Cuzco. 1 Very few Spanish women were available to set the tone for the new foundation, yet rather than delay and send to Spain for nuns, the councilmen eventually found a local widow named Francisca Ortiz de Ayala to serve as abbess for life-which she did, as Abbess Francisca de Jesus. 2 So began one of the first religious houses for women in the Americas, Santa Clara, still operating today more than four centuries later. Why a cloistered monastery, of all things, in such a turbulent time and place? The minutes of April 30, 1551, record that Diego Maldonado made his gesture to ensure the actual founding of a monastery to \"remedy\" mestizas-the children of conquest, daughters of Spaniards like himself and Andean women. 3 Writing to Francisca de Jesus in 1560, the corregidor of Cuzco, Juan Polo de Ondegardo, gives an expanded account of the motives behind these founding acts. He begins by linking the nunnery directly to the fighting: since so many Spaniards had died far from home, Christian charity obliged the survivors to care for the orphans of their fallen comrades.4 But why not care for the orphaned mestizo sons as well? Did mestizas hold-at least momentarily-greater promise or value in their fathers' eyes? Seeming to anticipate the question, Polo de Ondegardo\n\nwrites that \"although it appears the same should be done for the orphaned boys, they run less risk than the girls, and ... it is fitting to provide for the greater need.\" 5 A masterpiece of patriarchal succinctness, Polo's statement expresses the gendered logic of his culture, according to which girls' virginity, a prized token of male honor and the means of shaping lineages, was constantly at risk and had to be protected at all costs. Yet that was only part of the story. As he continues, Polo de Ondegardo conveys the special urgency that attended the founding of Santa Clara, only two decades after Spaniards first arrived in the central city of the Incas. In the cloisters of Santa Clara, Francisca de Jesus would win these young women from their Inca mothers and save them for their Christian fathers. The corregidor congratulates the abbess on the many (mestiza) souls he expects her to save: and I have no doubt they will be many, because the people born of this land, I have observed well, are all possessed of a very humble nature, which is excellently suited to receive the imprint of the truth, removing them from all communication with their mothers, as you do, which was an impediment to instilling anything good in them. 6 Polo goes on to depict the abbess as engaged in a tug-of-war for the souls of mestizas with the devil himself, whose temptations \"cannot fail to be great.\" He suggests Santa Clara help advance the cause of Christianity in the Andes, tearing girls away from their mothers in what he and his companions considered a necessary violence. Not only do we glimpse the devil through Polo de Ondegardo's eyes, but he points us in the direction of a major revision of the story of conquest: toward seeing women as both subjects and objects of Spanish evangelizing drives? For evangelization this certainly was, of a gender-specific, strategic kind. Moreover, Santa Clara was designed to play an explicitly reproductive role, redirecting the energies of childrearing to increase the numbers of female Christians in Cuzco. The point was not simply to populate the city with nuns. Abbess Francisca de Jesus was to take the place of the children's Andean mothers and keep the girls in the cloisters until they were old enough either to profess or to leave the monastery and assume a role (estado) in the Christian society their fathers planned to erect in the city.s We are not used to thinking of cloistered convents as sites of repro-\n\n16\n\nCOLONIAL HABITS\n\nduction. Thanks to an unusually detailed source, however, we can gain insight into the importance and outcomes of this seemingly incongruous project. In 1560, Polo de Ondegardo gave Francisca de Jesus a book for her to inscribe basic information about her young charges.9 The records she kept are limited to the convent's first entrants, and many entries are incomplete. Nevertheless, this libro de la fundacion indicates that Santa Clara in its earliest years succeeded in annexing to Spanish culture a number of mestiza girls, who grew up to become not only nuns but wives and servants in the Spanish households of Cuzco. In short, the project initially worked: it obeyed its founders' designs, at least for the space of a few critical years. This information opens up new analytical angles on the Spanish conquest, enabling us to draw new connections: to see conquistadores and encomenderos as fathers; to take nuns into account as Significant historical agents, involved in social reproduction; and (not least) to see a gendered dimension to the remote historical antecedents of what we now call race. I will argue that Santa Clara and its earliest entrants were vital to the production and reproduction of Spanish hegemony in Cuzco, helping remake the former capital of the Incas into a center of Spanish colonialism. For it was not enough for Spanish men to seize the Inca heartland. To gain firm control over the Andes, these would-be lords had to find the means to reproduce themselves-their lineages, authority, culture. Cloistering their mestiza daughters at a particularly sensitive moment in the consolidation of Spanish rule gave the leading Spaniards of Cuzco the means to do this, and thus stake a permanent claim to power in the Andes. lo Appreciating fully the significance of these founding acts requires us to situate them in their notoriously turbulent historical context. Diego Maldonado and his companions were engaged in a ferocious struggle to control their encomiendas, those grants of Andean labor and tribute which they had won by acts of conquest and which had enriched them beyond their wildest imagination. Their best hope of establishing glorious legacies in the Andes lay in transmitting these prestigious and valuable grants to their heirs. Ironically, the very privileges afforded men by Iberian-style patriarchy made mestizos a threat to the consolidation of Spanish control at this volatile, politically charged moment in Andean history. By attending carefully to the gender politics of this critical juncture, we will see why the Spaniards increasingly came to see mestizos as \"others,\" dangerous rivals to be feared, whereas their\n\nGENDER AND THE POLITICS OF MESTIZAJE\n\n17\n\nmestiza daughters might, if properly raised, help them to consolidate their power-why, in other words, Spaniards at this point developed a kind of gendered double vision of their own progeny.11\n\nThe Historical Context: A Protracted Conquest To understand why the leading Spaniards of Cuzco were obsessed with inheritance and concerned about mestizos in mid-sixteenth-century Cuzco, we first have to examine who these men were and how they got there. Spaniards first saw Cuzco in 1533, the year Francisco Pizarro and a group of several dozen followers reached the city. At that point they had been inside the vast Inca state of Tahuantinsuyo for more than a year, and had long since realized they had had the good luck to intervene just as the Inca leadership was emerging from a bloody succession crisis. They had made the most of their fortuitous timing by seizing, ransoming, and then killing the Inca ruler Atahualpa at Cajamarca in a sequence of events that would be argued over for centuries. 12 Pizarro had rewarded his followers by distributing precious metals and Inca women: Diego Maldonado, one of the most abundantly rewarded, got thousands of pesos' worth of gold and silver and a woman later baptized as Lucia, a sister of AtahualpaY Eager to see and acquire more, most of the \"men of Cajamarca\" then followed Pizarro as he made his way higher into the Andes toward the central city of the Incas. Cuzco made an enormous impression on the first Spaniards who saw it. Pero Sancho, secretary to Pizarro when the Spaniards entered the city in 1533, observed that Cuzco was so large and beautiful a city that it would stand out in Spain. As for its principal fortress, Sacsayhuaman, he marveled that human beings could erect such impregnable walls. 14 Pedro de Cieza de Leon, who arrived in the 154os, emphasized that nowhere else was such a noble city to be found; all other towns in South America looked inSignificant to him by comparison. IS The population of Cuzco at the time of the conquest can only be guessed at, but the city was probably the largest in South America at the time of the Europeans' arrival, with perhaps 150,000 to 200,000 residents. 16 An impressive network of roads led to it. The carefully preserved bodies of former Inca rulers exercised remarkable power from their central palaces, and stunningly majestic rituals filled the main plaza. To a people accustomed to finding power in cities, Cuzco was clearly the center of gravity of Tahuantinsuyo. In this awesome place Pizarro staked his claim, formally refound18\n\nCOLONIAL HABITS\n\ning Cuzco as a Spanish city on March 23, 1534. Pizarro and his men enacted rituals of their own, performing a city into existence by transplanting to this terrain the fundamental institutions of a Spanish city: the picota, or pillory, symbol of Spanish justice; a church, for which a site was designated; and a cabildo, or city council. Eighty-eight vecinos were enrolled with the understanding that each would receive a portion of Cuzco's land and the labor power of its inhabitants. 17 Word of the riches of the conquered Inca empire reached an eager audience in Spain and elsewhere in the Americas with little delay, and a sixteenthcentury gold rush was on. 18 However, Pizarro decided to found his seat of government elsewhere, a decision that would have enormous historical ramifications. He settled ultimately on a coastal site and founded Lima, the \"city of Kings,\" in January 1535. That left an open door to conflict in Cuzco. No sooner had Pizarro left than a vigorous Inca resistance took shape under the leadership of Atahualpa's brother Manco Inca, culminating in a massive attack on Cuzco in mid-I536 that nearly overwhelmed the Spaniards, followed by a devastating, year-long siege. When his efforts to retake Cuzco failed, Manco Inca retreated north in 1537, establishing himself in the montana stronghold of Vileabamba. From this \"neoInca state,\" resistance to Spanish control of the region continued for decades under Manco and his sons Sayri Tupac (1557-60), Titu Cusi (1560-71), and Tupac Amaru (1571-72). The Inca elites who stayed in Cuzco after 1537 sought to accommodate the Spaniards, but the city remained a welter of bitter enemies. For almost two decades, rival Spaniards raised forces against one another in a brutal series of civil wars in which Francisco Pizarro and countless other combatants died. Increasingly, these contests revolved around the fate of the encomienda as a means of organizing Spanish access to Andean wealth. An encomienda-often the grant of an Andean ethnic lord (kuraka) and those whose labor and tribute prestations he supervised - guaranteed its holder tremendous prestige and a lucrative material stake in settling the Andes for Spain. 19 But there were only a few hundred encomiendas, hardly enough to satisfy all Spanish comers. Men who had managed to obtain grants tried desperately to keep them, arguing that they should be awarded perpetual, heritable rights. However, the Spanish Crown, faced with numerous denunciations of arrogant, ruthless encomenderos who abused \"their Indians,\" feared these men would create a seigniorial Spanish American aristocracy defiant of royal control. After a disastrous attempt in the 1540S GENDER AND THE POLITICS OF MESTIZAJE\n\n19\n\nto abolish encomiendas, the Crown fell back on a less drastic strategy: that of meting out encomiendas in men's lifespans, giving Spaniards rights for two vidas or more. Encomenderos were thus strung along over the issue of inheritance, kept in a state of perpetual uncertainty, with just enough at stake not to rebel (most of the time).20 Cuzco was central to the prolonged struggle over encomiendas. For although Lima was the capital, Cuzco at midcentury continued to be the heart of Peru, the prize over which successive waves of conflict broke. Cuzco was the richest region in terms of the Andean labor power and tribute goods that could be commanded there. European diseases caused great disruption and death in the region, but did less damage in the highlands than elsewhereY Thus both the number of encomenderos and the tribute totals they received were higher in Cuzco than anywhere else in Peru.22 And by the 1550S, Cuzco's encomenderos had hit upon new ways of using Andean labor to enrich themselves. Precious metal had been discovered in a great silver-veined mountain at Potosi in 1545, and the trade in coca leaf and other supplies from Cuzco to the mining city grew remarkably thereafter, as did Potosi itself. Despite all the warfare and uncertainty of the 1540S and 1550S, many encomenderos of Cuzco exploited their encomiendas to become rich.23 These years were marked by extreme violence, not least of it Spaniards' violent treatment of Andean women. The conquerors' imperious actions were only barely checked by the handful of Catholic clergy who had made it to Cuzco by midcentury. Vicente de Valverde, Cuzco's first bishop, was present in the city only sporadically, but made some effort to control individual Spaniards' excesses. In 1539 he punished two Spaniards with fines and brief jail sentences for holding Indian women against their will. Francisco Gonzalez admitted to the bishop in January 1539 that he had kept a woman named Pospocolla in his house for a month and a half, and that \"the other day he yanked her by the hair because the Indian said she wasn't his.\" Pospocolla testified that she had been beaten and taunted. The following month, Juan Begines appealed the bishop's sentence against him, even while admitting that he had kept a woman named Mencia, \"an Indian who said she was a Christian,\" chained up inside his house and had whipped her many times-he couldn't recall how many-with a stick or whatever he found close at hand.24 Meanwhile, Spanish authorities (from the king down) were trying to settle Spaniards and convince them to stop their licentious 20\n\nCOLONIAL HABITS\n\nways and \"bad example,\" preferably by marrying Spanish women. Earlier the monarchs had entertained the idea of intermarriage as a vehicle of conquest, suggesting that some Spanish women and men marry Americans \"[so] that they may communicate with and teach one another ... and the Indians become men and women of reason.\" 25 However, by the time Spaniards reached Peru, this notion had long since been dropped in favor of a new approach, one more in keeping with the monarchs' propensity to treat Spaniards and Americans as irreducibly different kinds of people who should be kept apart in separate \"republics\" (republicas). The new strategy relied on the trope of mirroring, the idea being that malleable Americans, like children, would imitate their conquerors. The Crown exhorted Spaniards to set \"good examples\": to stop keeping Andean women in their households, form legitimate Spanish households, and demonstrate to Andeans the benefits of Iberian-style civilization. And deadlines were set for encomenderos to marry or risk lOSing their encomiendas. 26 But encomenderos did not want to marry just anyone; the decision was too important to the propagation of their lineages. It might take months to go over and find a wife in Spain or to arrange for a partner to bring over his marriageable kin. Instead, many encomenderos put off marriage and lived with elite Inca women. Diego Maldonado is one example. Another is Captain Sebastian Garcilaso de la Vega, who, while serving a term as corregidor in the 1550S, lived and had two children with an Inca noblewoman named Chimpu Ocllo; their eldest son was the eloquent mestizo author best known by his adopted name, the Inca Garcilaso de la Vega (1539-1616). Spaniards were quick to grasp the benefits of such arrangements. The Inca nobility regarded them as kin and assisted them accordingly.27 But like Garcilaso's father, the encomenderos did not marry their Inca partners.28 Almost to a man, they eventually wed Spanish women-often the daughter or sister of a fellow encomendero - and married off their Andean partners to less prominent Spaniards, as though tossing down scraps from a banquet table. 29 Various Spanish accounts note one result of these turbulent years: the proliferation of mestizos. The etymology of the term \"mestizo\" is uncertain. The Inca Garcilaso asserts in his Royal Commentaries of the Incas that the term was initially used as an insult.3o \"Mestizo\" soon became in Spaniards' mouths a synonym for \"illegitimate,\" since almost all mestizos were natural children (hijos naturales), born to unmarried Andean women and Spanish men.31 Some of the boys were taken into GENDER AND THE POLITICS OF MESTIZAJE\n\n21\n\nthe religious orders to serve as lenguas, translators in the campaigns of evangelization that were launched across the countryside from cities like Cuzco. Others accompanied their Spanish fathers on expeditions to extend Spanish claims to new territory. But Garcilaso and his mestizo companions occupied an unsatisfying, in-between position. They were arguably twice noble, the children of both Spanish and Andean elites, yet the Peruvian viceroyalty had made no special place for them, no republic. By midcentury, a first generation of mestizos was nearing adulthood and beginning to worry Spanish officials. As early as the I540s, the occasional Spaniard had registered apprehension about the mestizo population. By the I550S, the warnings in letters and reports to the Crown were becoming sterner and more paranoid. These boys and girls needed to be attached somehow: mestizo boys to learn oficios or trades, girls to be domesticated into Spanish homes (i.e., made auxiliaries, supportive players).32 The boys in particular were starting to appear dangerous. Many had learned how to wield Spanish weapons, and some of the older ones, like Diego Maldonado's son Juan Arias Maldonado, had fought alongside their fathers in the midcentury wars.33 The encomenderos of Cuzco were also in a quandary at midcentury. While they had grown rich from their encomiendas, and had municipal offices firmly in their grasp, they were nevertheless increasingly insecure about the future. The Crown had left it far from clear whether their prized encomiendas could be inherited, even if they did manage to leave behind legitimate, Spanish heirs. And their eldest, mestizo children were growing up and beginning to realize, like Garcilaso, the vulnerability of their own position.\n\nFounding Acts This was the charged context in which Cuzco's cabildo pursued its goal of establishing a cloistered monastery. On April I7, I55I, the assembled members bought a piece of property from the estate manager of Hernando Pizarro, stating that the cabildo would assume the role of patron of the new foundation. It is not clear whether the desire to protect mestizas was a part of the plan from the start. Probably so, since the Audiencia of Lima had ordered on October 8, I550, that the corregidor of Cuzco report on the situation of mestizos living among the natives, and had stipulated that they be placed in the care of Spaniards until something more definite should be decided. 34 In any case, 22\n\nCOLONIAL HABITS\n\non April 30, 1551, Diego Maldonado galvanized his fellows into action by donating the 550 pesos the property had cost on the condition that the nuns pray for his soul and those of his successors.35 The cabildo responded by naming him mayordomo of the new foundation for a year, setting down its intention to promulgate statutes to regulate the nuns' existence, and setting out to find additional property to donate to the new convent. With their notary public in tow, the cabildo members proceeded to the site bought by Maldonado and agreed on the spot to donate an adjoining tract. Santa Clara was not the first monastic house to be established in Cuzco. The Dominicans, Mercedarians, and Franciscans had already established their institutional presence in the city, and the Augustinians and Jesuits would not be far behind.36 But while the men's orders were founded by groups of friars sent over from Spain specifically for that purpose, Santa Clara was a homegrown institution, constructed by the city's founding fathers at the same time they were constructing themselves as such. The foundation has about it a distinct air of improvisation. During the 1550S Santa Clara appears to have functioned as a recogimiento under the leadership of Francisca Ortiz de Ayala, a piOUS widow who also attended to patients in the local hospital for Indians. 37 As the new foundation got under way, local Spaniards supported it with donations, and toward the end of the decade the cabildo sought royal permission to elevate Santa Clara formally to the rank of monastery.38 To found a monastery in sixteenth-century Spanish America was not unusual, nor was it unusual to shelter mestizas. Examples of these activities can be found throughout the region. In the Viceregal center of Lima, for example, the Spanish widow of an encomendero and her widowed mother had by the late 1550S formed a monastic community under Augustinian auspices. This house, La Encarnacion, was intended for widows like themselves, and mestizas were not allowed to profess in it.39 About the same time, a separate institution was taking shape in Lima specifically to shelter orphaned mestizas: the recogimiento of San Juan de la Penitencia.40 In Lima, as elsewhere in the region, professed nuns and their mestiza charges were clearly intended to be two quite separate categories. To found a monastery in order to remedy mestizas, who might in time become nuns-this was distinctly out of the ordinary. The occasional mestiza might make her way into monastic life, but such cases were more the exception than the rule and might provoke heated debate. For GENDER AND THE POLITICS OF MESTIZAJE\n\n23\n\nexample, when the corregidor of Cuzco, Alonso de Alvarado, offered La Encarnacion the rich sum of 20,000 pesos to accept his mestiza daughters, the nuns defied their male superiors and accepted one of the young women, creating a major conflict between the convent and the Augustinian hierarchy in Lima.41 Across Spanish America the preferred vehicle for the care of mestizas was the recogimiento, a flexibly defined institution readily adapted to welfare purposes. No royal approval was necessary for such a foundation, nor any monastic rule, and entrants were not required to bring a large dowry or Â·profess solemn VOWS.42 Monasteries were a different matter. As in Spain, they were considered a reflection on the communities around them; Spanish ideals of honor and feminine purity were powerfully represented and reinforced by these bulwarks against evil, dishonor, stain.43 If the nuns' honor was upheld, a city could hold itself in esteem, and vice versa. Thus founders consistently phrased their motives in terms of \"giving greater authority\" to their cities.44 Following Spanish practice, criteria for entrance into Spanish American cloisters were more rigorous than for less formal enclosure: an initiation period was observed, and a substantial dowry required. By the sixteenth century, issues of legitimacy were already starting to make their appearance in Peru, as the scandal in La Encarnacion over Alvarado's daughters shows. To admit mestizas was (almost by definition) to admit illegitimacy, people of mixed and still indeterminate status. The Augustinian overseers of La Encarnacion were quite unexceptional in their objections to mestizas. The gesture of Cuzco's cabildo on behalf of mestizas was a noteworthy exception. For a cabildo to sponsor a convent was also a striking departure from the norm. Most foundations in the Americas, as in Spain and throughout Catholic Europe, were initiated by individuals or families. Endowing a religiOUS foundation was expensive, and thus typically the act of an aristocratic, wealthy lineage seeking to enhance its members' status while ensuring them spiritual benefits. For a cabildo to get involved suggests something vital was at stake in Cuzco, some collective interest of the encomenderos too important to be left up to individual piety and charity. If Santa Clara can be read as a sign of how greatly it mattered to these men that mestizas have a respectable place, be \"remedied\" and not lost, they must have had compelling reasons indeed. We have seen the explanation of Juan Polo de Ondegardo for the new foundation: a combination of Christian charity exercised on behalf of fallen Spanish comrades, the protection of vulnerable girls, and\n\n24\n\nCOLONIAL HABITS\n\nthe saving of souls. At this point, it is worth examining the historical context more closely. In 1551, the Crown was reiterating its insistence that encomenderos marry in order to retain their encomiendas, the implicit message being that they marry Spanish women.45 Almost all the encomenderos of Cuzco, including all of the members of the cabildo, had by this point taken Spanish wives. To judge from the writings of the Inca Garcilaso, by the I550S the remaining holdouts were noteworthy exceptions. However, many (if not all) of the encomenderos had fathered mestizo children before marrying, and were obliged to reconcile the needs of two distinct families-one Andean and informal, from the paternal point of view; the other recent, legitimate, and Spanish. Some encomenderos, like Diego Maldonado \"el Rico,\" had only mestizo children to whom they might leave their privileges and fortunes. Maldonado, who did the most to ensure the founding of Santa Clara, did take a Spanish wife around midcentury, Dona Francisca de Guzmin.46 However, the couple never had children. Thus Maldonado's only potential heirs were his mestizo son and daughter, Juan Arias and Beatriz, born to the noble Inca he received at Cajamarca, Dona Lucia Clara Coya. And he was not the only founder of Santa Clara to father mestizo children: Alonso de Alvarado, who preSided over Cuzco's cabildo in 1551, had at least two mestiza daughters. While there is no evidence that their own daughters entered Santa Clara, the cabildo members' connection to this project of \"remedying\" mestizas was clearly very close, at once political and personalY More inSight can be gained from Santa Clara's \"Libro original,\" a fairly detailed account of the convent's foundation and its earliest entrants and ground rules, kept from around 1560.48 The picture of convent entrants that emerges is one of astonishing diversity. The circumstances of the girls' entry into Santa Clara vary Widely, as do their backgrounds (see Appendix I). In fact, it is quite pOSSibly the most heterogeneous group ever to populate a colonial Spanish American monastery on terms of theoretical equality. Most prominent among them was Dona Beatriz Clara Coya, the only child of Cusi Huarcay and Sayri Tupac (d. 1560), one of the last Inca rulers of Vileabamba. Only three of the sixty initial entrants are clearly identified as Spaniards. Two of these, apparently orphans, were allowed to become nuns in spite of the fact that they brought no dowry, \"so that the convent might begin to be populated with Spanish nuns that there may be an abundance of\n\nGENDER AND THE POLITICS OF MESTIZAJE\n\n25\n\nthem (para que aya copia deIIas), and to give greater authority to the convent.\"49 One girl by the name of Beatriz is listed as a morena, and thus may have been of African descent. However, most of the sixty original entrants seem to have been mestizas, those Santa Clara was founded to favor. 50 Some had been plucked from Andean villages by passing Spaniards: JUANA. Poor, orphaned, father unknown, found in an Indian village, brought to this Monastery in early [fifteen] sixty-one, with no dowry or board; she is to be catechized and remedied for the love of God, and it shall be set down on this page what becomes of her. 51 Like Juana, eighteen other young women were listed as \"orphans,\" meaning that they were fatherless. Their Andean mothers are never mentioned. At least seven were daughters of Spaniards killed in the midcentury wars and their aftermath; these included the daughters of \"Arias, who died at Villacuri\" (in IS54) and those of \"Medina, who died in the battle of Guarina\" (in 1547). Many had been brought to Santa Clara by people who were not their parents, usually a priest or a merchant. One example is Francisca Arias, \"brought by the priest Father Baltasar de Armenta, of the Order of Saint Augustine, who was among the Indians\"; another is an orphan named simply Ana: \"Juan Moreno, the merchant, brought her.\" Twice as large, however, was the contingent of girls whose fathers were alive when their daughters entered the convent. Of the thirtysix who appear to fit this category, the most prominent was Dona Maria de Betanzos, the daughter of the chronicler Juan de Betanzos and his noble Inca wife Dona Angelina Aiias Yupanqui (niece of the Inca Huayna Capac and a former mistress of Francisco Pizarro). A few young women seem to have been abandoned, like Luisa Pizarro, whose father Mateo Pizarro left her destitute in Cuzco while going off to seek his fortune in Chile, and Ana Tellez, classified as \"poor; she has a father; he has to be contacted, so that he may provide her board.\" But the majority were interned in Santa Clara by their fathers, many of whom gave their daughters a modest annual stipend. The phrase \"her father brought her\" (meti61a su padre; trajola su padre) occurs frequently in connection with fathers who could afford a respectable amount for their daughters' maintenance. Some of these men were encomenderos of the region, like Diego de Uceda of La Paz. Some fathers were engaged in commerce-for example, Ger6nimo Garcia, \"merchant,\" 26 COLONIAL HABITS\n\nand Antonio Hernandez, who \"does business in Potosi\" (trata en Potosi). Others were artisans - Hernan Gonzalez, a smith, and \"Gongora, tailor.\" One was a manservant of Captain Sebastian Garcilaso de la Vega. And at least one mestiza's father was a priest. The majority of the first young women to enter Santa Clara were thus interned, either by a Spanish father or by an unrelated Spaniard. The \"Libro original\" notes that they were to be raised Christians and to receive buenas costumbres (literally, good customs or manners), shorthand for an education in Spanishness that probably included everything from prayers to stitchery, perhaps literacy. After receiving the imprint of Spanish culture-after being \"remedied,\" to use Polo de Ondegardo's gloss-the young charges of Santa Clara might choose either to profess or to leave the convent. The point was not simply to create nuns, but to create culturally Spanish young women. Thus in its earliest years, Santa Clara had as its principal mission an activity that was, for most other South American convents of roughly equal vintage as well as most Spanish convents, an adjunct: the Christian education of girls. Although the monastic rule stipulated that nuns should live apart from those not under formal vows, the young women of Santa Clara mixed indiscriminately in the early years. Papal exemption for this was sought, but not until the 1570S was a separate part of the convent set aside for the donceIlas, or \"maidens,\" who were being boarded and raised there. Given the midcentury context in which Santa Clara's educational activities were carried out, this \"remedying\" represented more than mere education. It was a program of acculturation, probably in many instances a painfully abrupt cultural reorientation. This is particularly evident in the case of Dona Beatriz Clara Coya, the only fully Inca child among the convent's initial residents.52 Beatriz was born around the time her father, Sayri Tupac, left the unconquered stronghold of Vilcabamba in 1558 and made peace with the Spanish authorities, receiving in return generous estates in the rich Yucay valley north of Cuzco. When her father died suddenly in 1561, Beatriz inherited the estate he had been granted, becoming one of the richest people in Peru. In 1563, when only five or six years old, she was taken from the care of her mother, Dona Maria Cusi Huarcay, to be raised inside Santa Clara. The \"Libro original\" notes that \"she was brought to this house by friar Melchor de los Reyes of the Dominican Order, to be raised and to learn proper manners (buenas costumbres) in said house; the amount to be given towards her upkeep was not set.\" 53 Meanwhile, Beatriz was at the center of delicate peace negotiations beGENDER AND THE POLITICS OF MESTIZAJE\n\n27\n\nGuaman Poma (1615) writes that Christian Indians \"enter nuns' convents. They learn reading, writing, music, and sewing.

Beatriz would eventually be married, but not to her young cousin. At the age of about eight or nine, she was taken out of Santa Clara to join her mother Dona Maria Cusi Huarcay in the household of one of Cuzco's wealthiest encomenderos, Arias Maldonado, who promptly tried to engage the girl to his brother Cristobal.54 Rumor soon spread that Cristobal had raped Beatriz to enforce his claim on her. Alarmed by the implications of such a marriage alliance, Governor Lope Garcia de Castro wrote to the Crown: I am afraid that he [Arias Maldonado] might marry her to his brother Cristobal Maldonado, and I think that this has been done. . . . They tell me that he has been intimate with her, but I do not know whether this is true. This man must not be allowed to have the repartimiento [Le., encomiendaJ that the girl possesses. For his brother has Hernando Pizarro's repartimiento, and they would become so powerful that no one could oppose them in CUZCO.55 The child was hastily returned to the convent. Still Philip II sought papal dispensation to marry Beatriz to Titu Cusi's son. By the time this was granted, it was too late: Titu Cusi was dead, and the Spaniards had again gone to war against the Inca, Tupac Amaru, who was captured and killed in 1572. Beatriz would eventually be given in marriage to Captain Martin Garcia de Loyola, the man who captured her uncle Tupac Amaru, the last Inca ruler of Vileabamba. Santa Clara appears several times in the course of this violent and convoluted history. It served as the site of the hispanization of the young Beatriz in preparation for her projected marriage to Quispe Titu, a union the Spanish authorities wanted to domesticate as thoroughly as possible in order to make use of a pliant Inca to pacify the highlands. After an unsettling interlude with the Maldonados jeopardized the outcome of marriage negotiations, Beatriz was returned to cloistered life in Santa Clara. Her betrothal in 1572 to Loyola was contested by Cristobal Maldonado, who had managed to return to Peru and who continued to insist he was her rightful husband. Not until the late 1580s would the legal dispute be resolved in favor of Loyola. Dona Beatriz Clara Coya was finally wed in her early thirties, decades after GENDER AND THE POLITICS OF MESTIZAJE\n\n29\n\nthe bargaining over her marriage began, having spent most of her life in a convent.56 It is hard to determine much about the adult lives of the rest of Santa Clara's earliest residents. Eighteen young women - a third of those about whom the foundation records provide information-eventually professed as nuns. But almost twice as many, thirty-three, left Santa Clara after receiving a Christian upbringing. Ten of these young women were married to Spaniards. Of the other twenty-three, we know only that they were removed from the cloisters-most by their fathers, some by people seemingly unrelated to them. The daughters of the first abbess, for example, acquired three undowered orphans from Santa Clara; perhaps they became household servants, a fate not uncommon for mestizas in this period. Santa Clara thus fitted numerous mestizas for a livelihood in the Spanish society that was just taking root in Cuzco, not only as cloistered nuns but as wives and auxiliaries in Spanish households-virtually the only honorable roles available to culturally Spanish women at a time when female honor was closely associated with domestic seclusion. Whatever course their lives took after their entry into the monastery, the girls to whom Santa Clara imparted Spanish religion, language, dress, manners, and mores became part of the reproduction of the Spanish culture in whose midst they had been raised. This was the point, as the corregidor Polo de Ondegardo observed in 1560 when he expressed to the new abbess his optimism that Santa Clara would save many souls by removing mestizas from their mothers, who represented \"an impediment to instilling anything good in them.\" Obviously the successful consolidation of Spanish control in Cuzco depended on the Spaniards' ability to reproduce themselves and propagate Spanish ways in the heartland of a conquered empire. Polo de Ondegardo clearly appreciated the Significance of the new convent in this longterm project. Although he would have put it differently-as a triumph of truth over falsehood - Polo grasped that the young women of Santa Clara represented a kind of cultural capital, the potential for reproducing Spanish dominance in the hybrid Spanish-Andean society that was taking shape in Cuzco. A creative composite of monastery, orphanage, and school of Spanish culture, Santa Clara was a place where marriage-minded Spaniards could look for wives at a time that unmarried Spanish women had not yet arrived in large numbersP The mestizas of Santa Clara were Chris-\n\n30\n\nCOLONIAL HABITS\n\ntians-that is, culturally Spanish in the sense that mattered most-and of an age to reproduce: in terms of the demographics and cultural logic of conquest and settlement, they were in the right place at the right time. While it is hard to quantify Santa Clara's importance in the marriage market of early Spanish Cuzco, given the paucity of early parish and notarial records and the impossibility of accurately reconstructing the demographic flows into Cuzco at midcentury, the hispanized young women of Santa Clara may have played a major role. At least ten of the earliest entrants were married to Spaniards, and undoubtedly more of those who were removed by their fathers went on to marry and run Spanish households. By contrast, in Lima-a city with a relative abundance of Spanish women-the recogimiento of San Juan de la Penitencia did not prosper. Santa Clara's Lima counterpart declined rapidly in the decades after its 15S3 foundation and was closed in 1576 for lack of mestiza applicants. 58 Yet as the case of Dona Beatriz Clara Coya shows, the point was not simply to marry the hispanized young \"doncellas\" to Spaniards, but to marry them to the right Spaniards. While receiving a Christian upbringing in Santa Clara, Dona Beatriz was used first as a bargaining chip to secure the loyalty of the Inca to the Crown, then as a prize to repay the services of the man who had subdued the last Inca. Her abuse at the hands of the Maldonados dramatizes the dangers to which a valuable young woman was exposed, as well as the weight such things carried with the authorities. Not even Santa Clara could protect Dona Maria de Betanzos, the daughter of Juan de Betanzos and his wife Dona Angelina Anas Yupanqui: she was abducted from the convent by a Spaniard. Despite her father's move to disinherit her, she was ultimately married to her captor.59 Santa Clara was, then, more than a school for mestizas. It was a ward, holding its young charges off the marriage market while it was decided exactly what role they would play in the new society taking shape in Cuzco. By 1560 this was very much up in the air. Like Dona Beatriz Clara Coya and Dona Maria de Betanzos, others in Santa Clara had encomenderos for fathers and might be expected to receive a sizable dowry-perhaps even inherit their fathers' privileges. These young women also represented the possibility of connections for enterprising Spaniards into what remained of the Inca command system at its highest leve1. 6o But their value and status depended on the outcome of spirited debates, coming to a head in the 1560s, over the\n\nGENDER AND THE POLITICS OF MESTIZAJE\n\n31\n\nfuture of the encomienda and the place of mestizos in Peru. The consequences, both for the young women of Santa Clara and for Peruvian society in general, would be enormous.\n\nPolitics Within, Politics Without Controversies of the Late I560s With the new monastery officially under way, Diego Maldonado and his fellow encomenderos no doubt rested easier about the future of their mestiza daughters, thinking their \"mestizo problem\" at least partly resolved. Francisca de Jesus would see to it that these young women received the Christian faith and seamlessly merged with those teaching them \"buenas costumbres.\" But if the encomenderos believed Francisca de Jesus would cooperate fully in turning their daughters into Spaniards, they soon found out they were mistaken. Only a few years after the new foundation, the nuns were defying the encomenderos' powers of command and disrupting their designs. On the last day of December 1565, the cabildo met in the convent to convey the encomenderos' frustration over a criterion of difference that had appeared among the nuns: [W]e understand that among the nuns presently in the Convent, there is a division in that some of them wear a black veil and others a white veil, and as they are all nuns of the Order of Saint Clare ... it is not good for such a division to exist, but all should wear a black habit, like nuns of Saint Clare ... and all those who are now nuns and those who profess in the future, Spanish or native ... should take the same habit and veil and profess the same enclosure and rule as nuns of Saint Clare.61 The cabildo did not seek testimony from the nuns themselves, but the meaning of this boundary can be read clearly enough. In Iberian cloisters the black veil distinguished professed nuns from novices and servants, who wore a white vei1.62 By appropriating this signifier, Abbess Francisca de Jesus and the small minority of Spanish nuns in Santa Clara were unmistakably asserting their superiority over mestiza nuns. The Spanish nuns seem to be saying that the mestizas are permanent novices, a novice people-if not natural slaves, then natural servants.63 This case of a sartorial color line points to the way stereotyping often works, through the deliberate fudging of certain boundaries (in this case, those separating mestizasjnovicesjservants) to reinforce and reify others (Spaniardsjmestizas). Unfortunately, none of the nuns is 32\n\nCOLONIAL HABITS\n\non record regarding the veil controversy, so the cultural logic at work inside Santa Clara in the IS60s must be puzzled out of other traces. No doubt the stigma of illegitimacy weighed heavily against the mestizas in the eyes of Francisca de Jesus. Legitimacy was normally required for admission to Spanish cloisters. But were the Spanish entrants legitimate? The \"Libro original\" does not say: LEONOR DE LA TRINIDAD. Spanish, received without dowry to populate the Convent with Spanish nuns, so that it will have greater authority.... CLARA DE SAN FRANCISCO. Niece of Pedro Valdes, [received] without dowry because she is a Spaniard, and so that the convent will start to be populated with Spanish nuns that there may be an abundance of them, so the convent will have greater authority.64 The only clear difference between the mestizas and these young women is that the mestizas had Andean mothers, whereas these two were native Spaniards and presumed capable of providing an \"authoritative\" example to non-Spaniards. 65 Diego Maldonado and his fellow councilmen vehemently protested the new veil usage, saying that \"by no means would they place their daughters in the convent unless complete equality and conformity regarding the aforementioned [Le., the same veil and habit for all nuns] were observed in it.\" 66 In Spain, they argued, there was no such division. Moreover, the cabildo members pointed to the irony of the Spanish women's pretensions in thus setting themselves above their mestiza counterparts: the few Spaniards had entered without dowry, whereas the mestizas for whose welfare the convent had been founded had brought the convent most of its assets. It was decided that no division of veils would be permitted among the nuns, and that in the assignment of tasks all should be admitted equally, \"so that the most capable and religiOUS shall be admitted ... without regard to whether she is mestiza or Spanish.\" Francisca de Jesus was charged to obey.67 The cabildo may have won the skirmish, but it lost the war.68 Francisca de Jesus and a handful of Spaniards inside the cloisters had commandeered the encomenderos' project and imposed a hierarchical division among the nuns that, despite the cabildo's protests, would later reemerge and remain in place for centuries. Even the cabildo did not champion the mestizas' equality on all points. At its 1565 meeting, the cabildo further detennined that for the sake of decorum (\"por la GENDER AND THE POLITICS OF MESTIZAJE 33\n\nutilidad y decoro del conuento\"), no illegitimate daughter of a Spanish man and an Indian or other nonwhite woman could be elected abbess for a twenty-five-year period-that is, until December 31, 1590. Perhaps the councilmen believed they were buying time for the mestizas to prove themselves. If so, they miscalculated badly; by 1590 the election of anyone but a Spaniard or criolla as abbess of Santa Clara would be out of the question.69 Meanwhile, Maldonado and his companions were busy outside the convent's walls fighting another lOSing battle-one of high-stakes politics-over the right to bequeath encomiendas to their children. In 1555 they had joined encomenderos around Peru in sending an emissary to the court of Philip II to offer an impossibly large sum, 7.6 million pesos, to buy permanent encomienda rights for themselves and their descendants.?o Finally they had won the king's serious attention. Philip II, bankrupt and desperate for revenue, allowed a bidding war to begin. The kurakas of Peru responded with an equally impressive counteroffer to free themselves of the encomenderos' control, and sent their own emissaries to Spain: two renowned Dominican defenders of Indian rights, Bartolome de Las Casas and Domingo de Santo Tomas. With the debate thus freighted with expectations on all sides, Philip II elected to send a new viceroy and three commissioners to Peru, instructing them to negotiate the sale of encomiendas in perpetuity. When these men arrived in 1561 the contest over Peru's future reached new heights of intensity.71 The momentous visit by the royal comisarios set the stage for some remarkable politicS, including an unprecedented show of kuraka unanimity. Partisans on both sides of the great debate crisscrossed the Peruvian viceroyalty in 1561-62, organizing and polarizing the countryside for and against encomiendas.72 Not surprisingly, the encomenderos of Cuzco found themselves seriously outnumbered. Alarmed by the scenes of violent opposition that formed in front of them, they fumed anxiously about restless and defiant \"commoners\" trying to become their equals. 73 To make matters worse for men like Diego Maldonado, the viceroy and commissioners determined after months of inquiry that encomiendas must not fall into the hands of mestizos. In a letter of May 4, 1562, they proposed to the Crown that one-third of the encomiendas be granted in perpetuity to \"deserving persons,\" that another third be granted for a limited period to other pretenders, and that the remaining third revert to the Crown. The authors recommended that to 34 COLONIAL HABITS\n\nqualify for perpetuity, an encomendero should be married to a Spaniard, and that encomenderos who married Andeans, Africans, or foreigners (persons not subject to the Crown) should lose their grants. They indicated that unions of encomenderos with Andean women were commonplace, and lumped mestizos and mulattoes together in a general assessment that no good could be expected of such people, but rather disorderliness, as they were \"badly inclined.\" 74 As for the process of consultation by which they had arrived at their recommendations, the viceroy and commisioners noted that the encomenderos had conceded ground only reluctantly and after strenuous argument. This particular battle must have left the aging conquistador Diego Maldonado rather desperate. To try and turn things his way, he had made sizable gifts to those in Lima who were in a position to help him?5 But in the wake of the commissioners' visit the Crown was still in no hurry to take a definitive stance on the future of encomiendas. Philip II could gain more by leaving matters vague and continuing to deal with encomenderos individually, extracting handsome amounts from them in exchange for prolonging their descendants' tenure in their grants. Such a piecemeal, divide-and-conquer strategy might be especially lucrative in the case of encomenderos with illegitimate heirs, and Philip II seized this opportunity, instructing the Peruvian viceroy to negotiate deals with encomenderos interested in leaving their grants to their illegitimate mestizo sons for the duration of the sons'lives. The viceroy responded that many encomenderos were willing to make such a bargain?6 No doubt Diego Maldonado was in the forefront of those who were eager to cut a private deal. To him it was less important to preserve encomendero unity than to buy his mestizo son a chance to inherit his privileges and extend the family line. Ironically, just as the encomenderos were yielding to the Crown's tactics and abandoning a united front, their mestizo sons were joining together to contest their predicament under Spanish rule. No longer willing to await the results of their fathers' schemes, a group of young men began plotting in Cuzco to overturn Spanish authority and seize control of the Peruvian viceroyalty. Early in 1567, just as their frustrated murmuring was about to give way to action, the corregidor of Cuzco, Geronimo Costilla, got word of their plans. Little is known about the plot, which seems to have involved Spaniards and Incas as well as mestizos.77 But the blame fell most heavily on a handful of mestizos, who were rounded up and punished. Among them was Diego Maldonado's son Juan Arias Maldonado, as well as Arias and Cristobal Maldonado, GENDER AND THE POLITICS OF MESTIZAJE\n\n35\n\nwho had just failed in their attempt to forge a marital alliance with Dona Beatriz Clara Coya. Diego Maldonado, the proud old encomendero, was forced to humble himself before the authorities in Lima to gain his wayward son's release. 78 The \"mutiny of the mestizos,\" as it was called, seemed to confirm the most dire prognostications of the Spanish authorities. Thus even though the failed conspiracy involved Spaniards and Incas as well, and was hardly the only plot of its kind uncovered during these years, it honed the authorities' hostility toward mestizos in particular. The shaken Spanish governor Garcia de Castro, whose life the conspirators had been planning to take, penned many complaints about a mestizo population he characterized as restive, highly dangerous, and growing by the hour. 79 He urged royal action to prevent mestizos from bearing arms, arguing that \"since they are sons of Indian women (yndias), as soon as they commit a crime they dress as Indians (yndios) and hide among their mothers' kin and cannot be found, and there are many among them who are better shots (arcabuceros) than the Spaniards.\"so Thereafter, legal provisions restricting mestizos' rights multiplied as a stereotype coalesced in the minds of men like Garda de Castro: that mestizos as a lot were grasping malcontents, restless and prone to violence. Thus by the late IS60s, it was growing very difficult for the children of Spaniards and Andeans to find an honorable place in Spanish Cuzco. And the gendered distinctions Spaniards had been willing to make only a few years earlier, favoring mestizas and according them special protection, were starting to collapse. The veil controversy at Santa Clara in 1565 and the 1567 mestizo \"mutiny\" point in the same direction: toward growing discrimination against mestizos in general and the waning power of Cuzco's encomenderos. The first signs of discrimination against mestizas inside Santa Clara occurred just as the encomenderos were losing their bid for permanent encomienda rights. This crisis of encomendero power meant a Significant decline in the mestizas' value on the marriage market; their chances of inheriting and becoming vessels for the transmission of their fathers' fortunes and privileges seemed suddenly remote. The continuing turmoil in Peru led the Crown to dispatch a demanding lawgiver to impose a greater degree of Iberian-style order in the Andes. Viceroy Francisco de Toledo would be much more definite than his predecessors on the mestizo question, one of many difficult issues he confronted in his drive to \"pacify\" Peru. In late 1571, 36\n\nCOLONIAL HABITS\n\nToledo undertook to visit his jurisdiction personally, and during 1572 he made Cuzco his headquarters. The encomenderos of Cuzco rejoiced: finally, a viceroy was coming to them. But almost as soon as he arrived Toledo found himself in a dramatic confrontation with the cabildo. The new viceroy was utterly determined to break the encomenderos' hold on municipal power, and insisted that the cabildo elect one non-encomendero to its ranks. The cabildo members were equally determined to defy him, but he faced them down and won: a non-encomendero was elected and installed for the first time. 8! This was but the first of Toledo's disciplining moves. After prevailing over the encomenderos, Toledo went on to win a military victory over the Inca resistance at Vileabamba. The last Inca leader, Tupac Amaru, was captured and executed in a gory public spectacle in the central plaza of Cuzco whereby Toledo meant to extinguish all further resistance to Spanish rule. And to remove any threat from the relatively cooperative Incas of Cuzco, the viceroy personally brokered the betrothal of Dona Beatriz Clara Coya to Captain Martin Garda de Loyola, the Spaniard who had captured her uncle Tupac Amaru. As royal authority was rigidly imposed in Cuzco by this ruthless representative of the Crown, the high hopes of the encomenderos were frustrated; those of the mestizos were crushed.82\n\nConclusions By 1572, a distinct phase in Cuzco's development under Spanish rule was coming to a close, an extremely fluid time of great opportunities and violence. A seemingly paradoxical move on the part of Cuzco's encomenderos-the founding of a cloistered monastery in the midst of war-is in fact fully intelligible in terms of these men's chief concern: to secure Spanish hegemony. By focusing on reproduction, we can see why Spaniards' treatment of mestizas differed from that accorded mestizos. Mestizas (as Polo de Ondegardo reminds us) could be annexed relatively easily to a patriarchal Spanish culture that organized the asymmetries of gender by enclOSing females. As nuns, mestizas would lead cloistered lives and teach other girls Christian cultural ways; as wives, they would be enclosed within domestic space and subordinated to their husbands, and could (if married to Spaniards) become part of the republica de espaiioles. Mestizos, by contrast, posed obvious dangers to the reproduction of Spanish patriarchy. While they too might be raised culturally Spanish, GENDER AND THE POLITICS OF MESTIZAJE\n\n37\n\nthey stood to gain a potentially destabilizing role as male adults. As heads of households they might, if fully admitted into the republica de espaiioles, have a wide range of (gendered) cultural tools and weapons at their disposal: arms, horses, powers of command. And to the extent that they had a \"mestizo consciousness\" at all, mestizos might use these weapons to threaten Spaniards, plucking their guilty consciences with altogether logical, hence threatening, arguments: as sons of conqUistadores and high-ranking Incas, did they not have a right to something, perhaps twice as much as anyone else? The irony of Garcilaso's position is poignant. By choOSing to value both his parents' cultures, and to claim the dignity of his hybrid condition, he consigned himself to a no-man's-land of Spanish colonialism, exposing the violence by which it was instated in the Andes. By comparison, things turned out surprisingly well for Diego Maldonado's son Juan Arias Maldonado. Even though he was implicated in a conspiracy that the Spanish authorities took very seriously, sent to Lima for punishment, and banished from the viceroyalty, he ultimately managed to do what his father wanted: he produced heirs to perpetuate the Maldonado family name and fortune in his native Cuzco. This was not accomplished by means of encomienda, however, but through an entail (mayorazgo) that his father Diego set up near the end of his lengthy, eventfullife.83 The crafty persistence of \"el Rico\" and his well-timed payments to a bankrupt monarch allowed at least one mestizo to slip through the maze of thickening prohibitions, and enabled his descendants to prosper. Nonetheless, this complicated story of violent striving and destruction left relatively few people satisfied. So thoroughly do Spaniards and their discontents dominate the written record of these decades that it is easiest to regard conflicts from their perspectives, and to see their hopes rise and fall. What of the Andean mothers of the mestizas of Santa Clara who had seen their daughters stripped away from them? We cannot tell what happened to these women, whether the mothers were noble, or even whether they were Incas. They may have been Caiiaris or Chachapoyas once subjected to Inca control, or from another part of Tahuantinsuyo altogether. Not only did these mothers lose their daughters, they became textually invisible, brutally expunged by Spaniards who seized and claimed their daughters as Spanish property by branding them orphans. The mestizas themselves are also silent in the records that speak to historians. However, in light of the pressing procreative and patrimo38 COLONIAL HABITS\n\nnial designs of their fathers, it is noteworthy that many of the mestizas-including many not classed as orphans-professed, vowing to be chaste, poor, obedient, and enclosed. Can we read their professions as \"resistance\" to Spanish patriarchy? Not in any simple way. Interpreting these women's acts is difficult, given the scant archival traces and the tense circumstances in which they pledged to be virgin brides of Christ. Whatever the case, many of these women did remove themselves from the reach of their fathers and Spanish pretenders by vowing to spend their lives in the midst of a community that for a time contained mostly mestizas. Even so, Santa Clara made a vital contribution to the reproduction of Spanish hegemony in the old Inca city. Many of the hispanized young women raised within the convent were removed from it and assumed roles in Spanish households. Doubtless the social reproduction of Spanish Cuzco was also served by the example of the young mestiza virgins who devoted their lives and prayers to the worship of the Christian deity. Yet Santa Clara's patrons were not able to ensure that the project would obey their plans. Between 1551, when the cabildo decided to create a monastery for the proper upbringing of mestizas, and the planned uprising of 1567, room for mestizos and mestizas at the highest levels of Cuzco society was narrowing rapidly, and the nuns themselves reflected this fact in their habit. Mestizas could still become nuns, but Santa Clara would institute a new category for them: monjas de velo blanco, nuns of a lesser rank, wearers of the white veiI.B4 In 1576, after Francisca de Jesus had died, an election was held and the office of abbess went to Clara de San Francisco, one of the few Spaniards received without dowry at Santa Clara's foundation. All the abbesses for generations thereafter would be Spaniards or criollas, the American-born daughters of Spaniards. And a process of historical erasure got under way, for it no longer made sense to cuzquenos to regard Santa Clara in its founders' terms, as a \"monastery for mestizas.\" Instead the convent gained a distinguished place in accounts of the city's past as a place where \"noble\" young women, \"the daughters of the first conquistadores,\" had lived and professed. When the Franciscan chroniclers Diego de Cordova y Salinas and Diego de Mendoza published the first hagiographical accounts of Santa Clara in the mid-seventeenth century, they would not so much as mention the word \"mestiza.\" 85 How could a foundation have changed so dramatically in just a few years? This transition-in effect, the creolization of Santa Clara-is now largely unavailable to us as detailed social history. (The creoliGENDER AND THE POLITICS OF MESTIZAJE\n\n39\n\nzation of Cuzco itself still remains to be explored: we can see that men like Diego Maldonado had their seigniorial dreams pricked by the work of the viceroy and quintessentialletrado Toledo, but we know little about those who succeeded thereafter in building criollo dynasties in the region.) However, a sketchy roll of women professing in the late IS70S in the \"Libro original\" suggests that the cloistering of daughters in Santa Clara remained vital to the construction and reproduction of local power long after Toledo had completed his Cuzco sojourn. Dona Mencia de ZUiiiga, the criolla daughter of councilman Rodrigo de Esquivel-progenitor of a long line of imperious local aristocrats, the Marqueses de Valleumbroso-took the veil in 1579. If her profession is any indication, criolla ascendancy within the convent may have occurred within just two or three decades of its foundation. 86 The early history of Santa Clara (sketchy and provisional as it must remain) raises as many questions as it answers. In any case, the convent's foundation records oblige us to regard the category \"mestizo\" as unstable and provisional. They thus provide us with a powerful reminder about the unnaturalness of race and the limits of racial thinking. 87 Mestizos were not born but made-and the making of mestizos was a saliently gendered, historical process. We cannot assume Spaniards saw the same thing every time they looked at the child of a Spaniard and an Andean: circa 1560, \"mestiza\" signified one set of possibilities to Spaniards in Cuzco, \"mestizo\" another. Nor can we assume that after Toledo's time the fate of mestizos and mestizas was sealed into a single, unchanging category of difference. Such categories were clearly fluid and merit more comparative study than they have thus far received. In places such as Cuzco-and for that matter, Quito, Huamanga, or La Paz-why, how, and when did Spaniards and criollos begin to relegate mestizos to positions of inferiority? How did those who were labeled \"mestizos\" -or chinos, cholos, or castas-respond? Answering such questions will mean taking stock of the diversity contained within these categories, and undoing their masculinized plurals to allow for the singularity of gender.\n\n40\n\nCOLONIAL HABITS\n\n2\n\nThe Dilemmas of Dominio:\n\nReconciling Poverty and Property\n\nWhatever the color of her veil, the professed nun was obliged to live a life of poverty. On this fundamental point, the thirteenth-century rule given by Pope Urban IV to the followers of Clare of Assisi was clear: ''All who wish to leave behind the vanity of the world and enter into and persevere in your Religion,\" it began, \"must keep this rule and instruction, living obediently, without property (sin proprios), and chastely, and also perpetually enclosed.\" 1 To judge from the hagiographical portraits that the Franciscan chronicler Diego de Mendoza sketched of notable Sixteenth-century clarisas (Clares) of Cuzco, the nuns observed their vows strictly, and made sure their companions did, too. Mendoza praises the founding nuns for their extreme personal asceticism and humility, set against a hopelessly Babylonian Cuzco of opulence, gold fever, and plenty. He begins with Francisca de Jesus, who \"always wore a poor habit\" with coarse cloth next to her skin, \"never linen, even during her most dangerous and acute illnesses; her bed was an old animal skin, and a blanket.\" She found worldly goods and the means of acquiring them distasteful, and \"was never richer or happier than when she was poorest, asking for alms to support herself and her nuns.\" The exemplary poverty of Santa Clara's first abbess inspires a lengthy rhetorical effusion from Mendoza, who urges his reader to ponder weighty truths: Who could doubt that the gifts, riches, pleasures, and goods of this life are a heavy weight on the human heart? Who does not know that God is not to be looked for in the depths of the earth, but in the heights of Heaven? How, then, will those who busy themselves in such depths mount up to such a sublime eminence? 2\n\nPoverty had to be enacted, and it was the responsibility of each nun to do so. The daily practice of poverty meant desprendimiento, a constant letting go, divesting oneself of material things beyond those strictly needed to sustain life, and using only the rudest life-sustaining materials. The Constitutions of the Order of Saint Clare provided detailed instructions on the observance of poverty, the better to ensure that each nun would experience it constantly and through as many of her senses as possible. Her habit was to be made of rough, base material. Her bed was to be simple; her daily meals likewise. By Mendoza's account, the founders and first abbesses took great care to live poorly and set an edifying example for the new community of Santa Clara. Abbess Clara de San Francisco is portrayed as having experienced even more rigorous austerity than her predecessor Francisca de Jesus. Not only did she wear a coarse habit, she wore nothing more than sandals on her feet in Cuzco's chilly climate-and her bed was not only rude and uncomfortable, but had an adobe brick for a pillow.3 How then was it possible for Santa Clara to amass rights to significant resources in and around the city of Cuzco? The fundamental structure of the monastic life-its basis in poverty and enclosurewould seem to disallow it. Yet the convent's foundation records make clear that from the moment it was"
