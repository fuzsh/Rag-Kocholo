        "text": "CALL FOR CHAPTERS: Edward Elgar Publishing has asked me and colleagues (Wing On Lee and Jeongmin Eom) to edit a Handbook on Education in East Asia. I'm looking for contributors to write on various topics related to historical, cultural, and socio-political perspectives on education in the region, with particular interest in chapters on comparative education and higher education. If you're interested, please email me at kkester@snu.ac.kr with a proposed title, short abstract and author details. Chapters will be limited to 6,000 words, and the first draft should be ready by late Summer 2024. The volume is intended for a general education audience with chapters targeted toward teachers (including non-formal education), teacher trainers, higher education professionals, international and comparative educators, researchers, and policy makers. Check out the link below for more information.\n\nWhat is particularly interesting about this report - and an aspect that I've not seen commented upon to date - is the high percentage of students who are already benefitting from explicit instruction (from 50% to 86% depending on the particular element and level of education). I say \"high\" because so much of the public debate about education in recent years has been dominated by a narrative that explicit instruction is rare, and that this is one of the causes of perceived \"declining outcomes\" (a claim that is arguably more valid for PISA than for NAPLAN). The CESE study is based on an extensive empirical data set (the NSW \"Tell them from me\" student survey). Could this suggest that the narrative about the relative rarity of explicit instruction practice is false, a myth, contrary to the evidence? If so, what should we make of advocacy for evidence-based explicit instruction that is itself not based on evidence about its prevalence in the classroom? It is, as Churchill said about Russian diplomacy in WW2, \"a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma\". (As an aside: in 2020 ACARA released findings of its analysis of schools that consistently produce higher than expected growth in NAPLAN results. The findings suggested that these high-growth schools - which came from a range of Index of Community Socio-Educational Advantage (ICSEA) scores - shared some practices in common, such as explicit instruction, joint planning, and data analysis).
