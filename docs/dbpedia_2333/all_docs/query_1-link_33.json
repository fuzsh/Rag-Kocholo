I like that each project has untapped potential. But I did not anticipate that I would be working on so many different types and scales of projects, which I really enjoy.” As one of SmithGroup’s corporate design directors, Sven has led the design of a variety of mixed-use, commercial, planning and institutional projects from Washington, DC to India. Perhaps endless untapped potential is what draws Sven to music, too. He plays and listens to music as a creative outlet and, if not for architecture, would have pursued a career in sound design. He even has a desire to master the oud, an obscure pear-shaped stringed instrument with origins in the Mideast and North Africa. Other cultures clearly pique his interest: If he could go anywhere in the world, “I would take a private train across China with my family, with tours, hiking, and feasting along the way.”\n\nPer Franson\n\nHead of the Architectural Lighting Division\n\nPer is an architect and educator as well as Head of the Architectural Lighting Division .Per has been teaching in numerous courses on all levels. 20 years of running his own practice Per has great experience of the profession and is keen on bringing practice, education and research closer together."
