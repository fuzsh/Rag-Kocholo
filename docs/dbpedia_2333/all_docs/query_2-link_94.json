        "text": "Fernando ZÃ³bel in Manila\n\n1953decade of 1950\n\n1950 At the Department of Printing and Graphic Arts, ZÃ³bel finds an engraving workshop where he experiments with all the techniques: in addition to oil and watercolor, he draws with all kinds of pen and tries his hand at etching, dry point, boxwood engravings and xylography. He remains with the department until 1951, during which time he puts collections in order, undertakes bibliographical studies and helps organize the engraving classes. He thus commences the didactic activities which will become fundamental both in his personal life and in his artistic career. He gives his first lectures: one on French printing techniques, another on illustrated books 8, and a third, on items which, generally speaking, fail to arouse the collectorâs interest 9.\n\nFernando ZÃ³bel in the year of his graduation from Harvard University\n\n1949\n\n1951 The painters to influence him most in this first stage are Hyman Bloom, Jack Levine, John Marin and Rattner 10. Of all of them, however, Boston-born Bloom becomes his main reference point in these early years of self-training. His admiration for Bloom leads to a close friendship which would have turned into a master-student relationship had ZÃ³bel not finally rejected the idea.\n\nâIt occurs to me: âon this point, ZÃ³bel writesâ what a good idea it would be to go on earning nothing and persuade Hyman Bloom to teach me how to paint. I think he would treat me like a student. Iâm practically sure. But 1) if he tries to involve me in aspects of pure technique, I might very well get bored. 2) At this time, when Iâm living off other peopleâs kindness, I donât have the nerve to earn nothing, however little that might be when I can.â11\n\nIn his early paintings, apparently religious in theme, there is an undertone of fierce social criticism, not without a touch of satire. By and large, they are characterised by a symbolic romanticism, a profound poetic sentiment and surfaces rich in matter and color.\n\nNot long afterwards, he takes part in his first collective exhibition at Bostonâs Swetzoff Gallery, together with Jack Truman, Hyman Bloom, Karl Priebe, George Montgomery, Celo Lambrides and Edward John Stevens, among others. One of the pictures on display at the exhibition is Pez (1951). The sketch for this first painting may be seen in the first volume of his notebooks 12. The same year, he takes part in another exhibition, Original prints, held at the same gallery. ZÃ³belâs engravings are exhibited alongside those of other artists like Vlaminck, Klee, Bresdin, Chagall, Lautrec, Rouault, Picasso, CÃ©zanne and Feininger.\n\nDuring this period, ZÃ³bel forms a close friendship with William Bond, the manuscript curator at the Houghton Library, and with William Bentick Smith, curator of books of calligraphy and ornaments and director of the Harvard Allumni Bulletin. Every week, Bond and Smith organize a lunch, attended assiduously by ZÃ³bel. Other guests include poets and bibliographers (Jacob Planck and the man who would later become director of Sothebyâs New York, Robert Metzdorf) and top members of the universityâs staff. Throughout this and the following year he does graphic illustrations for the Harvard Allumni Bulletin, a publication designed for Harvard graduates. His drawings consist of a series of ironic caricatures portraying aspects of student life on the university campus.\n\nWhen his stay at Harvard comes to an end, he goes to Spain on holiday. There still exist two notebooks about this trip, containing highly descriptive, detailed drawings of everything that draws his attention: amongst other things, typical Spanish figures, bullfighters, ceramics from Toledo, Talavera and Puente del Arzobispo and traditional houses in some villages of Gerona, AlbarracÃ­n and Guadalupe 13.\n\nAt the end of this year, he returns to Manila, where he starts working at Ayala, the family business. So as to find time to paint, he gets up early and also spends every weekend in front of the easel. Correspondence with his friends in the American artistic world is frequent and intense.\n\n1952 Return to Manila\n\nFrom his return to Manila until 1961, the year he moves to Spain permanently, he lives a double life in which he combines his work in the corporate world with his work as an artist (painting, research, classes, patronage, writing, publicationsâ¦). He joins a group of young people who exhibit at the Philippine Art Gallery. During this period, his best friends are painters Arturo Luz, Hernando Ocampo, Anita Magsasay-Ho and Vicente Manansala and writers Rafael Zulueta da Costa, I.P. Soliongco and Emilio Aguilar Cruz. He takes part in a collective exhibition, the Annual watercolour exhibition, held by the Art Association of the Philippines, and also exhibits a watercolor on plywood, Stultifera Navis (Ship of fools), in the First anniversary exhibition at the Philippine Art Gallery. Now fully integrated in Manilaâs most up-to-theminute artistic circles, ZÃ³bel soon becomes involved in the debate arising among the young painters of the moment about the relationship between the new art and tradition and the cultural identity of the Philippines. He publishes three articles on the subject, all of which are extremely enlightening about the artistic moment lived by ZÃ³bel at that time. The articles are entitled: Pintura moderna en Filipinas (Modern painting in the Philippines), Art in the Philippines today and Filipino Artistic Expression 14.\n\nHe joins the Art Association of the Philippines. One of his first projects at the association is the publication of a book on the history of Philippine art from the sixteenth to the twentieth centuries. Published in 1958 with the title, The Art of the Philippines, the book satisfied a pressing need in the sense that very little had been written on the subject. At Manilaâs University of Ateneo, he gives a course titled The appreciation of art, aimed at postgraduates.\n\n1953 He is elected President of the Art Association of the Philippines.\n\nFirst individual exhibition: Exhibition of paintings, drawings and prints, held at the Philippine Art Gallery. At this exhibition, he presents a series of works in which he abandons his Bostonian symbolic and romantic themes for Philippine themes revolving round local customs and manners. Here, he addresses intimiste, street themes on the one hand and religious themes on the other. Generally speaking, the works are conceived as surfaces filling up with flat, vivid colors where, at times, traditional perspective completely disappears and, at others, highly subtle spatial references combine with two-dimensional spaces and figures. Matisseâs influence is of significance in these figurative works, which are characterised by a glossy texture where thick, black strokes prefiguring the gestural content of later works are sometimes superposed on the masses of color. On the occasion of this exhibition, he publishes an article about his work method, entitled Methods of Philippine Contemporary Painters. He writes:\n\nâMy approach is a deliberate one. Possible subjects are hastily jotted down in ink, sometimes in watercolor. I do this constantly, anywhere. If the subject shows promise, I do drawings, sometimes quite large ones. In a drawing, I try to work out, as completely as possible, some aspect of what I conceive as the finished painting. Its color scheme, for instance, or its composition, or a part of it. Normally, I accumulate as many as thirty drawings and perhaps fifty sketches before I even touch the final painting. In the case of my BodegÃ³n antillano, I prepared for over three years. The final painting is not copied from the sketches. I approach it as an entirely new problem with its own individual rules and solution. The value of preparatory work is that I have committed most of my mistakes beforehand; I have with me a kind of mental file. This permits me to work rapidly on that final painting. I try to finish it within a week at the most. If I donât, I am likely to start what is, in effect, a new painting on top of the old one and the process might stretch out into eternity. Also, by working rapidly, I can conserve a certain freshness of execution that I feel essential to the finished work. The public should see no evidence of hesitation or experiment. After all, a painting communicates, in a sense, as much as speech, and no good speaker will be caught rustling papers, coughing or stammering (â¦).â 15\n\nThe same year sees his first attempts at abstraction in his painting, as in Reflected Sunset (1953) and Barco frutero II (1953). As he finds such endeavors to be lacking in meaning and also somewhat incoherent, it will not be long before he abandons the idea. He destroys these paintings and returns to the Filipino theme. Some of his first efforts are presented at the collective display, First Non-Objective Art Exhibition at the Philippine Art Gallery and at the II Spanish American Biennale, held in Havana (Barco frutero I, Barco frutero II and BodegÃ³n antillano (1953).\n\nHe is awarded first prize by the Art Association of the Philippines for his painting Carroza (1953) at the semiannual painting contest.\n\nJosÃ© T. Joya, Carmen Rivera, Manuel RodrÃ­guez, Arturo Luz, Fernando ZÃ³bel, Cesar Legaspi, Nena Saguil and Fernando Ocampo\n\n1953\n\n1954 Manila\n\nSecond individual exhibition, 12 paintings by Fernando ZÃ³bel, at Manilaâs Contemporary Arts Gallery. A success with both public and critics, who refer to him as being at the forefront of the current of renewal in Philippine art. He continues with the Filipino theme, further enhanced by the use of oil on canvas. At the Philippine Art Gallery, he takes part in the collective exhibition, 16 Artists. His work is also displayed at the VII Annual Exhibition held by the Art Association of the Philippines.\n\nFor a second term, he is elected President of the Art Association of the Philippines.\n\nHe does the mural paintings for one of the chapels in the Forbes Park Church in Manila, dedicated to the memory of his father. The murals are inspired on the Catalonian Romanesque paintings of Tost, Seo de Urgel and Ribas. In Manila, he publishes a selection of his drawings: Sketchbooks. Fernando ZÃ³bel. The book contains an essay by Arturo Rogerio Luz, an introduction by Emilio Aguilar Cruz, a sonnet dedicated to ZÃ³bel by Zulueta da Costa and a technical description and annotated index by the artist.\n\nAt the beginning of the year, ZÃ³bel, weighed down by the idea of living two utterly different lives, undergoes a personal and artistic crisis, from which he will recover in 1955, when a new painter is born after a year in which he again travels to the United States and then to Europe.\n\nFirst book of notes and drawings, published by ZÃ³bel in Manila\n\n1954\n\nProvidence, Massachusetts\n\nIn October, he starts at the Rhode Island School of Design, where he has been invited to stay as a resident artist. He obtains the post with the help of his friends, James and Reed Pfeufer, who have taken up residence in Providence. His main activity at the school consists of learning engraving techniques. James Pfeufer, who holds engraving classes on Rhode Island, teaches him the techniques of lithography, how to make the trimming, borders and edging for books and how to master the art of engraving in general. He also attends painting, drawing and architecture classes, in addition to devoting a large part of his time to reading in the school library. In Providence, he paints several landscapes with thick textures and vivid colors, and also the odd portrait. Abstract expressionism goes down well in America and has tremendous influence on the artistic ambit.\n\nFirst individual exhibition in the United States, at Bostonâs Swetzoff Gallery, where paintings executed in the Philippines are displayed. At the end of this year, he is âbedazzledâ on discovering the work of Mark Rothko, who was not very wellknown at the time, at an exhibition titled Recent Paintings by Mark Rothko, held at the Providence Museum. On display are the works in which the artist arrives at the formula that characterizes his painting: huge, horizontal blotches of color completely flooding the canvas. Fascinated and disconcerted by the eloquence of these enormous, totally abstract paintings, ZÃ³bel visits the exhibition every day. At the same time, his friend Ronald Binks introduces him to the possibilities of photography, which, with its direct images, satisfies his desire to reproduce the themes to which he is drawn. These two discoveries lead him to reconsider his painting and, for a whole year, he strives to find his abstract pictorial language. A few months later, in Granada, ZÃ³bel recalls these paintings by Rothko and writes:\n\nâNo need for painting here. They did it with architecture. With every single refinement, I can think of Rothko again. Also hide-and-seek. But you must sit on the floor. It is absolutely essential. You should suspect the alabaster basins by their reflections. And by their sounds. No place to count fish. Or to count anything for that matter. Arithmetic quantity is any form treated as a rather amusing joke. This is for the senses: eye, ear and nose, like those specialists. If you insist on counting, vertigo will take over. Deliberately. And everywhere, a caricature of symmetry. Symmetry that doesnât quite work. Hidden surprises at the edge of the boredom; a toy for hot afternoons. The square as a ruling principle; in other words the blank shape, the neutral, the canvas. The rest is tension under a veil of languor. It appears that every floor has been soaked in blood at one time or another. This too communicates. Also the hole at the horizon, showing green and little leaves, surrounded by every wall conceivable, inviting you to forget all this tiresome handwork and take a jump (â¦).â16\n\n1955 Providence\n\nExhibition at the Rhode Island School of Designâs Museum of Art: Paintings by Fernando ZÃ³bel and by Elias Friedensohn. He takes part in the III Spanish-American Art Biennale, held in Barcelona. Here, he represents the Philippines, along with painters Nena Saguil, Luis Lasa and JosÃ© Joya. During his stay on Rhode Island, he makes the most of every minute of his time: he travels frequently to Harvard and to Boston, where he visits Hyman Bloomâs studio; he goes to Yale University Museum (Connecticut) to see the collection of SociÃ©tÃ© Anonyme organized by Marcel Duchamp and Katherine Dreier; and he visits New York on a regular basis to see exhibitions. ZÃ³bel is fortunate enough to experience firsthand one of the greatest moments of North American art and witness the birth of abstract expressionism. On one of these lightning trips he organizes for the purpose of going round the galleries, he visits exhibitions of Boston painters Hyman Bloom and Jack Levine, Giacometti, Picasso and Mathieu at the Kootz Gallery. In the course of these months, he visits the American painter of Philippine origin, Alfonso Ossorio, at his house in East Hampton (New York), where the two of them talk until well into the night about painting and the fact of being an artist. The conversation has a great impact on the young ZÃ³bel, who was, at that time, in the throes of a profound change of existential and artistic direction. About this, he wrote the following:\n\nâ (â¦) I spend most of the night talking with Alfonso Ossorio; in fact, between the two of us, we finish a whole bottle of Scotch and I get to bed at 4.30 in the morning. We talked mainly of painting and of being a painter. The gist of his remarks, repeated over and over again with variations and a kind of anguish: âDonât let them stop you.â He lives and paints at high pitch, burning the candle at both ends. He is spending and living on his capital (â¦). Loathes compromise, any attempt to popularize. âArt must be difficult to see, difficult to understand, difficult to own.â Ideally, he would like to see people forced to choose between buying an automobile and buying a painting. About 10 years older than I, unquestionably good, with a desperate, Dostoyevskian sort of goodness. Completely generous. Completely humourless. Inflexible and full of pratfalls. Completely committed to his art, which, for him, is an extension of religion. Gorgeously out of touch with reality. Commands respect and grudging admiration. His work, now almost completely abstract, is full of technical ingenuity and bright color. It is profoundly cold, contradicting its surface appearance of emotion. Forced and contrived, it rewards only the intellect, not the eye, and fails to convince.â\n\nAlfonsoâs house, the old Herter estate, is magnificent. The exterior, pleasantly dingy and unkempt, a side giving on to a lake with swans. The interior is dazzling white, clean and bare. Any number of rooms without furniture; just white rooms hung with paintings: Clyfford Still, Pollock, some thirty Dubuffets, Alfonsoâs own work. In the bathroom, an early De Kooning. The guest rooms are festooned with gruesome bric-Ã brac from the SociÃ©tÃ© dâArt Brut collection that he formed with Dubuffet and AndrÃ© Breton. Depressing and depressed objects are made out of human hair, leads, bits of wool. Pinkings from asylum waste baskets and garbage cans, chosen for their careful unpleasantness. Downstairs, a glassed-in pergola with a mauve Victorian lampshade, tropical plants, and a Giacometti figure on the piano. 17\n\nDDuring the months at the Rhode Island School of Design, he continues with his research in the field of bibliophilism and publishes two articles. The first is about an eighteenthcentury manuscript titled Historia de un ruidoso desafÃ­o, by Don Francisco Xavier de Santiago y Palomares. It belongs to the collection of the Department of Graphic Arts at the Harvard College Library 18. Y el segundo, con un tema mÃ¡s general, sobre los libros ilustrados por artistas 19.\n\nEurope\n\nIn April, his stay on Rhode Island comes to an end and he goes on a three-month tour of Europe with his friend, biologist John Moir. First he goes to Paris, then to Spain (Ãbeda, Ronda, MÃ©rida, Granada, Seville, Madrid and Gerona) and lastly, to Italy, where he visits Florence, Ravenna and Venice, amongst other places.\n\nIn Madrid, he discovers young Spanish painting at the GalerÃ­a Fernando Fe and visits the studio of BenjamÃ­n Palencia. On this, his first contact with Spanish painting, ZÃ³bel writes:\n\nâI met Guillermo Delgado during his show at Fernando Fe. (â¦) His pictures, uncompromisingly abstract, show a process completely under control, completely âworked outâ, unlike the abstract expressionists. A classical undertone. From a distance, some of his things could pass for ZurbarÃ¡nâs still lifes. There were several other abstract painters of roughly the same age. I remember Luis Feito and Canogar. All, without exception, seem to be on the defensive. (â¦) I bought one of Delgadoâs pictures. I surprised him by not haggling over the price. He confessed later that it was his first serious sale. Prices are high in Spain but actually painters seem to end by giving their pictures to friends.â 20\n\nHe meets Gerardo Rueda who, from then on, will be one of his best friends. On June 19 the same year, after a party organized by Rueda as a way of introducing him to other painters, ZÃ³bel writes the following about these initial contacts:\n\nâGerardoâs studio is no longer a secret hideout. It was full of people drinking wine and eating omelettes. The Isabel girls (Isabel Montojo and Isabel Garrigues), the Feduchis â making sure that there was enough for everybody and that dishes got washed. Wouldnât let the men help, which still surprises me after America. I agreed to swap paintings with Gerardo. In many ways, our heads operate in the same manner.â\n\nOn the same trip, he strikes up friendships with Luis Feito, Guillermo Delgado and Antonio Lorenzo.\n\nManila\n\nOn returning to Manila, he keeps in touch with his colleagues in Spain by letter. He abandons figuration and tries to synthesise the luminism of Rothko, the matter painting of Feito and Burri and the calligraphy of Kline and his own drawings. He destroys most of the works produced in this period.\n\nBy studying the artistic objects to be found in the countless churches scattered over the islands, ZÃ³bel continues with his research into the expression of the specifically Filipino in art. For the purpose, he focuses on an area to the north of LuzÃ³n, in Ilocos, where he comes across a number of religious images and votive offerings in a sixteenth-century church. Two years later, he publishes an article on the subject, entitled Silver ex-votos in Ilocos.21.\n\nHe publishes an article on the American and European art he has seen during his holidays: Art abroad: an impression 22.\n\n1956\n\nIndividual exhibition, Fifteen paintings by Fernando ZÃ³bel at the Philippine Art Gallery. This exhibition of abstract works causes some surprise and has relatively little success, except among painters. In these early abstract paintings, we find above all influences of American abstract expressionism, of Pollockâs dripping, of Willem de Kooning and especially of the gestural painting of Franz Kline\n\nHe goes to Japan on a business trip related to his job at Ayala. He takes lots of photographs, especially of the temples and sand gardens (a bamboo garden, the Temple of Rioanji and its sand garden in Kyoto, the stone gardens of the Daisen Temple). About all this, he writes:\n\nâWith Dan to an out-of-the-way, moss-colored garden. (â¦) All the huge trees are here, but in miniature. An equivocal effect, mildly soothing, mildly crying, and, in the long run, quite irritating. The cement wastebaskets made to look like tree trunks also bother me. The Japanese is neither Buddhist nor Christian. He is entirely of this world. He accepts death as a blank finality. Poverty is another matter; he evades it by transforming it into an aesthetic principle. Elegance and poverty fuse into shibui: the first is purged, the second, dignified. (â¦) Private life remains an enigma. At any rate, it remains very private indeed.â 23\n\nAfter this trip, ZÃ³bel has his house refurbished on the lines of a Japanese aesthetic.\n\nTogether with artists Cobb, GonzÃ¡lez, Hillsmith, Sherman and Zerbe, he takes part in the exhibition, 6 Contemporary Painters, held at the George Walter Vincent Smith Art Museum, Springfield. He also takes part in the photography exhibition at the Philippine Art Gallery in Manila\n\nHe is invited by Manilaâs University of Ateneo to give a course on the history of art during the academic year of 1956-57. The lectures are a success and there will be further courses on a range of subjects (contemporary, Chinese, Japanese art and so on) until 1961, when ZÃ³bel returns to Spain for good. As a result of this academic experience, he makes friends in the new generation of Philippine and North American intellectuals: painters Lee Aguinaldo and Roberto RodrÃ­guezChabet, poets Emmanuel Torres and LeÃ³nidas V. Benesa, architect Leandro V. Locsin and his wife, Cecilia Yulo, and Tessie Ojeda, who would later become the wife of Arturo Luz and the director of the gallery of the same name. He also strikes up a friendship with the young archaeologist and engraving specialist, Roger S. Keyes, and his future wife, Keiko Mizushima, a paper restorer and expert in Japanese engraving.\n\nHe is appointed Honorary Cultural AttachÃ© at the Spanish Embassy in the Philippines. Through this appointment, ZÃ³bel, in conjunction with UNESCO, obtains scholarships enabling Philippine painters to go abroad. People travelling to Spain on these scholarships include Arturo Luz, Legaspi, JosÃ© Joya, Nena Saguil and Larry Tronco.\n\nLecture on present-day Philippine art: Modern Art in the Philippines, at Manilaâs Rotary Club.\n\nHe publishes an article on Gerardo Rueda 24.\n\n1957 Individual exhibition: ZÃ³bel, an exhibition of new paintings, at the Philippine Art Gallery. The abstraction of his painting evolves towards the expression of movement. He embarks on a long series called Saetas, where, as he would tell Rafael PÃ©rez-Madero years later, the theme is âmovement expressed metaphorically through the use of line. The movement of leaves, blades of grass, trees, birds, people; movement observed, sensed, never imitated, but, I hope, translated.â25 In Saetas, inspired on the Japanese sand gardens he had visited the year before, fine calligraphic lines are superposed on colored backgrounds where he tries to reflect Rothkoâs luminism.26 After countless experiments, the technical problem entailed in using oil to produce a fine, long, controlled line is solved by the use of a surgical syringe. This instrument, which he will use constantly from now on, bears a close relation to the pen with which he produces his sketches and drawings. There are many volumes filled with these drawings, constituting a manner of visual diary taking us through the evolution of his painting.\n\nInvitation to the ZÃ³bel exhibition held at the Philippine Art Gallery in Manila, 1957. 27.\n\nInvitation to the ZÃ³bel exhibition held at the Philippine Art Gallery in Manila.\n\n1957\n\n1958 Exhibition ZÃ³bel. Paintings / Schneidam. Sculptures at the Philippine Art Gallery, Manila.\n\nHe starts working on an archaeological dig on an estate belonging to his family on the peninsula of Calatagan. The work is continued by the National Museum of the Philippines under the supervision of Dr. Robert B. Fox. A huge number of china pieces are discovered, prompting ZÃ³bel to broaden his interest in Chinese art in general and Chinese painting and calligraphy in particular. In the course of time, he will become a great connoisseur of the subject. On ZÃ³belâs initiative, the objects found at the site are donated to the National Museum. As a result of this experience, until 1960, he attends classes in Chinese technique, where he is taught by a Shanghai painter, Professor Châen Bing Sun. In a letter to his American friend, Paul Haldeman, he writes:\n\nâI learn to read (not speak) and write Chinese. I love this; a new world, a new way of expressing thought, so different that it affects the very quality of thought. An ideal exercise for the painter â if you can control a Chinese brush, surely you can control anything. (â¦) To fill in the blanks, I am preparing a series of 30 lectures on Chinese and Japanese art. But what a wonderful way to force oneself to learn something to get organized. Do send me some postcards of oriental things.â 28\n\nHis house in Manila after renovation following a trip to Japan.\n\n1958\n\nHe is appointed honorary curator of the National Museum of the Philippines.\n\nIn October, he takes a yearâs holiday and sets up his residence in Madrid. His house is located on Calle VelÃ¡zquez, number 98. From this year onwards, he shares a study with his friend, painter Gerardo Rueda 29. He forms friendships with Saura, Sempere, Chirino and Antonio Magaz. He commences the collection of Spanish abstract painting which will later form the basis of the Museum of Spanish Abstract Art (Museo de Arte Abstracto EspaÃ±ol) in Cuenca.\n\nZÃ³bel's first studio in Madrid at his house at Velazquez, 5\n\n1958\n\n1959 Individual exhibition at Madridâs GalerÃ­a Biosca. This is his first individual exhibition in Spain and is also the first time that Juana MordÃ³, the director of the GalerÃ­a Biosca at the time, has held an exhibition of an abstract artistâs work. The exhibition consists, on the one hand, of Saetas and, on the other, a new series of black calligraphic pictures on white, known as Serie Negra, which will not be completed until 1963. Antonio Magaz Sangroâs book on these works, ZÃ³bel. Pinturas y Dibujos, is published 30.\n\nZÃ³bel takes part in the exhibition, Negro y Blanco. ExposiciÃ³n homenaje a Chillida, Oteiza, MirÃ³-Artigas, TÃ pies y Palazuelo, at Madridâs Sala Darro. At this exhibition, ZÃ³bel identifies with the Spanish painters of his generation and this will be one of the reasons why he decides to leave the Philippines and the world of business to devote himself entirely to painting.\n\nHe returns to the Philippines, although his artistic activity continues to be based in Spain. He works as managing partner at Ayala; he paints, teaches and carries on with his archaeological studies, but his thoughts are in Spain. At the end of the year, ZÃ³bel summarizes this difficult and complicated period as follows:\n\nâSome attempt must be made to pick out the shape of the past year. So many things have happened; (â¦) Spain, by contrast, is a blast of light. It completely fills the vacuum. (â¦) Friends: Gerardo and Manolo rediscovered. New ones: an odd kind of spiritual twinship in Tony Magaz; the human richness of Antonio Lorenzo; the hard intelligence of Saura. (â¦) Even the delight in walking the streets and hearing the sound of Spanish. The sound of home. Perhaps this is the important thing: this recognition of home. If one must lose oneself, this is where I want to be lost. Through all the ornaments, through the ease of English prose, I recognize myself in the last analysis as a Spaniard. And all the rest is just a tale. (â¦) I find myself inside the painting of Spain; Iâm one of the gang. Accepted as such by the others who are, on the whole, my friends. I rejoin them at the moment of discovery, when we begin to attract attention. I see this happen before my eyes: TÃ pies covered with cash and glory from the Venice Biennale, Feito established in Paris, Saura in everyoneâs hair (?), Canogar reproduced in full color in French art magazines, startlingly well, and I become a part of the government tours of other countries: Switzerland, Germany, Scandinavia, South America. The point is proven, at least on that level. I am an established painter, whatever that means. The real discovery is the possibility of a way of life.â (Manila, december 1959).\n\nHe participates in absentia in a travelling exhibition of Spanish painters, La joven pintura espaÃ±ola, which is taken, among other cities, to Basel, Freiburg and Munich.\n\nNOTES\n\n8. In 1995, during his stay at the Rhode Island School of Design, he publishes an article on this subject: âThe artist and the illustrated bookâ.\n\n9. ZÃ³bel makes the following reflection about the third lecture: âProf. Jackson rejects my thesis that the ugly may, from a sociological point of view, have as much value as the lovely. Or rather, to be clearer, he rejects my idea that it is something worth collecting. I can think of lots of ugly things that now are lovely: sixteenth and seventeenth-century books, all baroque, just as Gothic once was ars barbara. And all the lovely things that now are ugly: Rafael Sanzio, Aubrey Beardsley, that fool Meryon, Ribera. Who knows? Iâll keep silent. His point of view is correct: we have to keep the best. But the best, the best? What for? (â¦)â Fernando ZÃ³bel, Cambridge, December 20 1950.\n\n10. However, the young painterâs gaze knew no limits. At the Harvard Fogg Museum, it was Greek sculpture and Chinese painting; at the Museum of Modern Art, the work of Soutine; at the Metropolitan, archaic bronzes and mediaeval armour; at Bostonâs Fine Arts, Rubens and El Greco. According to his writing, his favorite painters at that time are also Rembrandt, Georges de la Tour, Rodolphe Bresdin, the Germans of the DanubeSchool and Samuel Palmer.\n\n11. Fernando ZÃ³bel. Cambridge, March 8, 1951.\n\n12. After he starts painting at Harvard, we find that ZÃ³belâs work can be traced along two closely connected paths: on the one hand, his notebooks and, on the other, his work in oil. In order to understand the complete dimension of this artist (painter, researcher, drawer, engraver, photographer, teacher, patron, collector, writer, bibliophile, cosmopolitan and tireless traveler), a highly cultured man of sober but exquisite taste, it is essential to trace his artistic path through the notebooks catalogued and dated between 1950 and 1984.\n\n13.

His tremendous generosity and constant support of art are again noticeable on this occasion, when he donates the money he is paid for the course to the university library for the purchase of collections and reproductions of key paintings in the history of art. 31.\n\nIn the years elapsing between 1955 and 1960, ZÃ³bel realizes that Spain is an intellectual, sentimental and pictorial synthesis of what he has been seeking all his life. This awareness throws him into a state of endless anxiety about his life as an artist. As he combines this with his work at the family business, he becomes the inevitable victim of an identity crisis, coupled with a deep depression. Although he tries to overcome this by painting frantically, he finally contracts an alarming disease of unknown physical cause. In December of this year, ZÃ³bel dismantles his office at Ayala and, after 10 years of trying to reconcile his artistic life with the life of a businessman, he decides to go and live in Spain and devote his entire life to painting.\n\n1961 Individual exhibition at the Luz Gallery, Manila. The gallery has been opened this year by his friend Arturo Luz and is soon to become the leading gallery in the Philippines. The exhibition is on a large scale and is a huge success. It marks the end of a stage.\n\nHe moves to Madrid for good. Individual exhibition at Sala NeblÃ­, Madrid. At both exhibitions, he displays pictures from Serie Negra (1959-62), black calligraphies on white. As there is no longer any color, the vibrations caused by the contrast of one or two colors disappear while the artist succeeds in suggesting direction, speed or volume by means of the sweeping strokes of a dry brush across the black calligraphies. As for technique, he avails himself of a syringe, going over the canvas with generous strokes which form angles or deliberately open up on the bare white. This use of black and white leads most of the periodâs critics to look on him as an informalist painter. However, unlike other painters such as Saura, Millares or Canogar, ZÃ³bel meditates, observes and studies; he does not trust his hand, the improvised gesture, and such an attitude cannot produce a clamor, a paroxysm or an indictment. ZÃ³bel detaches himself from art informel, as he explains clearly and concisely in a text where he defines his painting in Serie Negra:\n\nPainting of light and line, of movement. Pictures of a swift, improvised execution, like Chinese and Japanese painting. Improvisation permitted by a studied and infinite number of drawings. Line; trajectory. Imprint of movement. Painting without any fuss, without anguish, without any melodramatics. Traditional, yes, but of the âotherâ Spanish tradition. Of the VelÃ¡zquez tradition standing in opposition to the Goya tradition (by which no contempt is meant). Of the same VelÃ¡zquez who attaches as much value to theInfanta as he does to the dress she is wearing and the curtain behind her head. The painter neither gives an opinion nor makes a judgement: he just acts. âA statementâ. There is gratitude. Awareness of just how much painting has been done. Abstract, to be more precise. Perhaps out of modesty. And out of a lack of interest in foodstuffs. And through attaching too much value to things, which isnât the same as attaching value to the way they look. Privacy. The armchair by Matisse that so shocked the Russians. Court painting? In any event, a smile. And heâs not always ironic. And why not?â 32\n\nFernando ZÃ³bel in his Madrid studio, with paintings for the Sala NeblÃ­ exhibition\n\n1961\n\nIn the course of the previous ten years in the Philippines, his interest in archaeology, religious sculpture and contemporary Philippine art had led him to form excellent collections in the three fields and as a final touch to his acts of patronage on the islands, he donates the collections to Manilaâs University of Ateneo. The collections will be used to create the Ateneo Art Gallery in June of this year. The paintings in this collection ranged from figurative styles to abstraction and included works by some of the leading Philippine artists of the time, such as Arturo Luz, Vicente Manansala, JosÃ© Joya and Hernando R. Ocampo 33.\n\nHe publishes an article on Philippine porcelain: âThe first Philippine porcelainâ 34.\n\n1962 Manilaâs University of Ateneo grants him the honour of becoming the universityâs first doctor honoris causa. He is also awarded the title of honorary director of the museum.\n\nHe takes part in a number of collective exhibitions outside Spain, including two of particular note: Modern Spanish Painting at Londonâs Tate Gallery (the exhibition poster is a reproduction of ZÃ³belâs Colmenar) and the XXXI Venice Biennale, where he meets Gustavo Torner, amongst other painters 35.\n\nModern Spanish Painting exhibition at the Tate Gallery with ZÃ³bel's poster reproducing the painting Colmenar\n\n1962\n\nIn Madrid, he participates in the exhibition, Cinco pintores: Sempere, Rueda, Manrique, Vela y ZÃ³bel at the GalerÃ­a NeblÃ­.\n\nGroup exhibition at the NeblÃ­ Gallery with the participation of (from left to right) Gerardo Rueda, Vicente Vela, CÃ©sar Manrique, Fernando ZÃ³bel and Eusebio Sempere.\n\n1962\n\nTrip to Chicago. With his friend Mike Dobry, he visits the Chicago Art Institute to see an exhibition of paintings from what is now the Museum of the National Palace of Taipei (formerly the Forbidden City), Taiwan. 36.\n\nAbout this exhibition, he writes:\n\nâWent with Mike Dobry to see the Gu Gong paintings being shown at the Art Institute. The Song landscapes are much bigger than I thought. The reproductions I knew, being much reduced, gave no idea of the amount of calligraphy involved. I thought that came later. (But content lords it over form. Rembrandt and VelÃ¡zquez would have felt at home; especially Rembrandt). The Qing âscholarlyâ paintings, presumably at their best, continue to look sloppy and weak. Am I missing the point? Or are they, as I suspect, primarily framed autographs by mysterious worthies playing parlour games with a brush for each otherâs benefit? After all, many of us are doing much the same. Some of the results look terribly inept though, I suppose. The footnotes are all there, terribly amusing to those who can spot them.\n\nFan Guang âtravelersâ tickled into gigantic existence, the artist intent on his theme, using the brush stroke as a means, not an end. Mike draws my attention to Xu Daoningâs Fishing on a snowy river. Crisp, decided; calm emptiness. A Japanese emptiness, but without sugar. After a while, the tart and, further, the tasteless, always seem the best. In a sense, how little there is to all this; these flimsy works surrounded by the logorrhoea of the centuries. By contrast, our Louvres and Prados seem dense, heavy, full of furniture and gesticulation. The Chinese world is full of privacy. These works, never intended for a public showing, have an embarrassed look. Assaulted modesty (â¦)â 37 He travels to Venice to attend the inauguration of the XXXI Biennale and also to Rome. Back in Madrid, on July 20, he writes the following:\n\nâItâs almost a week since Gerardo [Rueda], Alfonso [ZÃ³bel] and I came back from Venice. Itâs taken me a week to get organized again. Iâm finding myself clumsy. My painting, which contains a certain element of virtuosity, forces me to practice it almost every day; the gaps are noticeable. From the trip itself, I have kept about three hundred sketches. The Biennale is a kind of slave market where one smells and is smelled. Too much of pictures. I didnât manage to see them all. I think I didnât manage to see even half. I might say the same about the Spanish Pavilion. It looked like a shop window on Calle Hortaleza or Calle Fuencarral. My stuff looked good against the black walls. Its simplicity stood out in the midst of all the panoply. Iâve been offered exhibitions in NY, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco (Feingarten, Bodley), in Rome (La Salita, Don Quixote), in Naples. They seem to be a lot, too many. (â¦) Manessier, for political reasons and unjustifiably, walked off with first prize. Giacometti, justifiably, walked off with the sculpture prize. His pictures deteriorated greatly in the period from 1957 to 1959. For me, the best things about Venice were the Jean Paul Riopelle and Hundertwasser Pavilions. The latter took me completely by surprise. As we Spaniards had nobody to defend us before the panel, we left empty-handed. (â¦) President Segni, tired and distinguished, a figurehead in a morning coat, surrounded by clamorously decorative civil servants and military officials, visited each pavilion and came out with an immortal phrase for each artist. By the time he came to my pictures, he was worn out after so much talking and sliced the air with his hands as if he were a plane taking off. He evidently sees things more clearly than many critics. (â¦) The best thing about the Biennale is Venice. That enormous toy. (â¦) Anything that can be said about Venice has already been said. It is being worn away by so many eyes looking at it. (â¦) We go back to Rome, looking at all the fountains that appear in our path. (â¦) Wonderful retrospective exhibition of Mark Rothko. New colors, vibrant and sombre. The best pictures I see from start to finish of the trip are, with the exception of a Bonnard in Venice, a female nude in front of a mirror of twisting, sizzling colors. In Italy, all is color. I feel this great urge to buy a box of watercolors and mess around a bit. To paint with glaze. Also: the small Etruscan bronzes at Villa Giulia are marvellous. I draw wherever I go; in Venice, Tintoretto, in Rome, fountains and water. I buy myself a bronze Roman lantern, a sestertium of Lucio Vero, a cut gemstone from the eighteenth century, an engraving of two girlâs faces by Renzo Vespignani. (â¦)â\n\nIn Madrid, he moves to another house and study at number 12, Calle Fortuny. He starts engraving with Dimitri Papagueorghiu and becomes actively engaged in etching with Antonio Lorenzo. About his engraving activities, he writes frequent letters to his North American engraver friend, Bernard Childs. He travels to Paris with Antonio Lorenzo and Gerardo Rueda. October. Visits to the Louvre, some galleries and his friend Bernard Childs, who gives them an engraving session. Childs is the friend to influence him most, the one to show him the secrets and problems of inks, plates, paper, etc.. 38 About his visit to Childsâ studio, ZÃ³bel writes:\n\nâAntonio and I watching Childs engrave. Heâs impressed by Antonioâs etchings â âonly two weeksâ. An interesting detail: The time Bernard spends from inking the plate to finally passing it through the screw press is two and a half hours. He wastes no movements. He inks with a spatula and cleans with a piece of newspaper. In the inking process, itâs as if he were painting each plate. There is nothing more pleasurable than watching somebody do something he knows how to do really well. When inking a plate, Bernard uses his head more than most of the painters that I know use theirs when theyâre painting a picture. (He doesnât like etching, he finds it indirect). When we leave the studio, weâre in a daze, our heads bursting, and we go to Charbonnel to buy materialsâ.\n\nThis anecdote is completed by the one told by painter Antonio Lorenzo in the prologue to the catalogue of his graphic work. He tells of how he became interested in engraving as a result of the trip to Paris with ZÃ³bel. âIt was not until 1960, during a trip to Paris with Fernando ZÃ³bel and Gerardo Rueda, that I became interested in engraving. It happened in the Paris study of North American artist Bernard Childs, an old acquaintance of ZÃ³belâs. We became friends. I showed an interest and he let me soak the paper and turn the shafts on the screw pressâ¦ Bernard Childs initiated me, and ZÃ³bel, who was also there sometimes â he would spend the day hunting for books and engravings â and was aware of my weaknesses, acted as tempter by rushing me off to Charbonnel to buy inks, scrapers, punches, polishers and lots of other things, rounding off our purchases with a small screw press. We dismantled the shafts and put it in the boot of the car.â 39 On his way to Manila, where he usually goes for Christmas, he stops off at New York. He makes this journey in the year when pop art is at its height in the United States. While he is there, ZÃ³bel visits the historic exhibition, New Realisms, at the Sidney Janis Gallery. He writes of it as follows:\n\nâSuper exhibition at the Janis. Super catalogue. Everythingâs super except the objects. I found them forced and boring. At Wittenborn, I see a book: Do-it-yourself collages. Critics think that modern art has revolutionized publicity art. Itâs the other way round.â 40\n\nOne year later, on November 17, 1963, he writes on the subject again\n\nâPop art feeds off the advertisement, the photograph, vulgarity. To my mind, this double digestion is excessive; the first is quite enough. The rasping sensation produced by the pile of cans of soup is something I feel and have felt perfectly without needing Roy Lichtenstein or Andy Warhol to show me. (But itâs an art for the public). Theyâve got the wrong idea with this fashion game. You have to look for the other, the thing that doesnât change, the thing that serves. What theyâre doing here is a kind of tickle.â\n\nHis visits to the Prado are constant. He unfailingly carries his notebook with him so as to study and analyze the paintings of the past with his pen. As his visits are long, he applies for a Prado copierâs card so that he may sit and draw in comfort. 41 He develops an interest in bullfighting (there are countless bullring drawings and observations in his notebooks). He collects Spanish blue and white ceramics from the fourteenth to eighteenth centuries and silverware in the Spanish baroque style.\n\nFernando NuÃ±o exhibits his photographs of artists in the Sala del Prado at Madridâs Ateneo, including some taken of Fernando ZÃ³bel while painting.\n\nZÃ³bel started to buy works by Spanish painters of his own generation in 1955. Between then and now, his still small collection includes works by Antonio Saura, Gerardo Rueda, Luis Feito, Guillermo Delgado, Antonio Lorenzo, Manuel Millares and Eusebio Sempere. At the end of the year, before setting off for the Philippines, ZÃ³bel mentions the âToledo Projectâ (the future Museum of Abstract Art) for the first time. This is his first idea about what to do with his collection of paintings by Spanish abstract artists.\n\nâI leave reluctantly. I say goodbye to Antonio [Lorenzo] and Gerardo [Rueda]. We talk about the Toledo Project.â (Madrid, November, 27, 1962).\n\nThis year witnesses the completion of Serie Negra with OrnitÃ³ptero (1962).\n\n1963 The years elapsing between 1963 and 1975 constitute the longest stage in ZÃ³belâs painting. This year, he returns to color and slowly, the siennas, dark browns, ochres and greys start to appear, as in works like Atienza, Armadura III and Pancorbo. The theme of memory, hinted at in previous series, begins to take shape in this new stage, in which ZÃ³bel, by means of forms, objects and imagination, seeks âto remember in pictorial termsâ, as he himself put it. In the prelude to this colorist stage, ZÃ³bel develops the idea of painting based on the memory of the experience lived, a concept whose literary equivalent is to be found in Marcel Proustâs great work, Ã la recherche du temps perdu. About Proustâs influence on his work, ZÃ³bel is very clear when he speaks of Homenaje a Patricio Montojo (1963), now in the Museo de Arte Abstracto EspaÃ±ol:\n\nâI have always been struck by the part in CÃ´tÃ© de chez Swann where Proust describes a walk round Cambray â a walk in a country and a time which arenât mine initially but become mine in the end; to put it another way, as I read, I recognise, with a strange, inexplicable nostalgia, the relish of my own childhood. On another occasion, over two years ago, I think, I decided to try a kind of painting based on memory; by this, I mean a climate painting, leaving the viewer to complete it with his memories. The realist focuses on that loaf of bread, that flower. Iâd like to create a climate in which the bread, the flower, were born of the viewerâs imagination. There is something of this in Homenaje a Patricio Montojo: I discussed this at length with Toni Magaz last night. Itâs not that itâs about a naval battle. Obviously, the picture is an abstract composition. But, from my point of view, as I use elements exterior to the picture, and from Toniâs, who contributes personal elements quite similar to my own, it is clearly a naval battle. An educated North American would probably see it as a scene from Melville. This morning, Rubio CamÃ­n turned out a landscape of plateaus (figuration always proves clear, bordering on the most extreme realism. However, it varies from person to person, the plateau as clear as the battle). The painting establishes the climate, âin the order ofâ, as Torner would say. The viewer completes it with his subjective experience, which, for me, translates into a battle (complete to the last detail with lights, the floating tree, gunpowder on the water) and for CamÃ­n, it translates into a plateau (rocks, parched plants, mists, a shepherdâs cottage and so on). Ortegaâs definition of the cannon: âYou take a hole and surround it with ironâ¦â etc. (The picture as a hole filled by the viewer. I provide the iron that gives shape to the hole). Retrospectively, previous works fill out with meaning: El Faro, La primera amapola and so on. A complete scenario of painting opens up; an approach as yet untried. Subjective painting (until now, rendered subjective by the painter); now aimed at the viewer. Painting as a mirror. Iâm expressing myself badly because I still donât have a clear idea about the limits and possibilities. All this will fall into place with time.â 42\n\nExhibition of drawings at the GalerÃ­a Fortuny, Madrid. A book of his drawings is published: ZÃ³bel. Dibujos, drawings, dessins, with a text by Antonio Lorenzo43.\n\nWith Manolo Millares at the opening of the exhibition of ZÃ³bel's drawings at the Fortuny Gallery in Madrid\n\n1963\n\nAs the year elapses, the idea to install a painting collection somewhere outside the four walls of his Madrid home begins to take shape. With this view in mind, in April, he goes to Toledo with Gerardo Rueda, but fails to find anything satisfactory. A few days later, Gustavo Torner invites him to spend the day in Cuenca to show him his house and take him round the city, along with JosÃ© MarÃ­a AgullÃ³, Rafael and Carmen Leoz and Juana MordÃ³. In June, the museum project starts to develop when, through Gustavo Torner, the Mayor of Cuenca offers him the possibility of installing his collection in the building of the âHanging Housesâ (at the time, the houses are being renovated and no decision has been taken as to their future use). On seeing the houses, ZÃ³bel does not hesitate. On June 16, after visiting the âHanging Housesâ, he writes:\n\nâTwo days in Cuenca with Torner and Lorenzo. The mayor, Rodrigo Lozano de la Fuente, goes out of his way to help us and find solutions. We take a look. A magnificent museum could be installed in the âHanging Housesâ. 20 to 30 years paying a nominal rent and the pictures are my property. The buildings are handed over to me ready for use but, from then on, expenses are on my own account. (â¦) I see it as a good proposition, a nice thing to do and it saves me from spending nearly a million pesetas on a house. I can use that money to buy pictures. The best idea would be to encourage painters to come and spend the summer here. You have to make the most of your opportunities as they arise. Otherwise, regret sets in.â\n\nThe fact that there is now a space to house the collection affects decisions as to its content and, from now on, ZÃ³bel will consider it necessary to have a more complete representation of Spanish artists belonging to the abstract generation. He selects the works and always asks the artist to give his opinion. As he accepts neither gifts nor donations, he is in a position to act quite freely. He usually buys the works directly from the artists, although he sometimes goes to the galleries, or exchanges his work for that of the artist, or the artist produces a work specifically for the museum. He then forms a team with Torner and Rueda, who will be responsible for adapting the museumâs spaces and installing the paintings. In July, ZÃ³bel takes up residence in Cuenca. In September, he starts work on the museum. Full of enthusiasm about the museum project, ZÃ³bel writes to his American friend, Paul Haldeman (October 4 1963):\n\nâMy big project is a Museum of Spanish Abstract Art in the city of Cuenca â two and a half hours from Madrid. In the renowned âHanging Housesâ, which the kind-hearted, forwardlooking local corporation has let me rent for thirty years at something like 1.50 dollars per annum. How nice fo everybody! I have a feeling it is going to turn into one of the loveliest small museums in the world. As I will be owner, director, curator, acquisitions committee, patron, board of trustees and dictator, I rather think I shall have a lovely time. My lifeâs ambition: a final club with only one member â me. (There will be room for only about 40 paintings but they shall hang with all the glamour that my fervid jewellerâs imagination can devise).â\n\nIn October, he buys SarcÃ³fago para Felipe II (1963) by Manuel Millares, one of the museumâs most important works. After visiting the artist at his studio, he writes:\n\nâThe other day, Manolo Millares called me. Heâd heard about the museum and he told me that he had a couple of pictures he wanted me to see before Pierre Matisse arrived, because he likes them and, above all, he would like one or two of them to stay in Spain. I went with Gerardo after lunch. (â¦) He tells me that, after painting, his greatest interest is archaeology. We see the paintings. An excellent triptych built round bottoms and corsets, an allusion to the Profumo Case. To me, it seems a bit of out of character for Millares and, whatâs more, it is far too clichÃ©d. I prefer the other one, a huge diptych depicting a sarcophagus, the body of Felipe II, or whatever. For all the poor quality and coarseness of the matter, it is astonishingly elegant. The difference between pop art and Millares is that Millares takes an aesthetic approach, he composes. The shock is not the issue; it is more like a tip or something of the sort. He himself says: âI havenât the slightest interest in neo-Dada.â\n\nOne year later, he buys another work from him, an arpillera (a technique whereby scraps of fabric are appliqued onto a hessian backing) titled Cuadro, which is reproduced in the first catalogue ZÃ³bel publishes for the Museo de Arte Abstracto EspaÃ±ol in 1966. Also in 1963, he buys two works from Manuel Rivera, Espejo de duende and a landscape.\n\nThis year, he concludes his research into Philippine art and publishes in Manila an impeccable study titled Philippine Religious Imagery, about Philippine images painted, sculpted or modelled during the period of Spanish domination from 1565 to 1898. In this study, ZÃ³bel reaches the conclusion that, beyond any doubt, the best area in which to study the existence of a Filipino style with its very own characteristics is colonial statuary.\n\nZÃ³bel publishes in Manila an important study on Philippine religious imagery under the title Philippine Religious Imagery.\n\n1963\n\nLectures: one titled El renacer de la pintura espaÃ±ola, on the rebirth of Spanish painting, at the Colegio de Leyes del Ateneo de Manila, and another about the Eastern painter, El mundo del pintor oriental, given at a course organized by the CÃ¡tedra San Pablo, Madrid.\n\n1964 He rejects the offer of the Professorship of History of Art at Mills College, Berkeley (California)\n\nIndividual exhibition at the Luz Gallery, Manila. He also works on a series of etchings at the studio of painter Manuel RodrÃ­guez, in Manila. In Madrid, individual exhibition at the GalerÃ­a Juana MordÃ³, inaugurated this year by the gallery owner of the same name. It is his first exhibition in Spain after his return to color.\n\nTrip to New York to participate in the Spanish Pavilion at the New York Worldâs Fair and to finalise the details for his exhibition at the Bertha Schaefer Gallery, to take place the following year. This is a year of intense activity at the museum, with acquisitions, trips, visits to studios and so on. In a remarkably short time, ZÃ³bel succeeds in drawing a good number of artists to Cuenca, all of whom are enthusiastic about the idea of the museum. By Easter of this year, in addition to Antonio Saura and Gustavo Torner who actually live there, Gerardo Rueda, Manuel Millares, Manuel HernÃ¡ndez MompÃ³ and Amadeo Gabino have studios in the city. And ZÃ³bel writes:\n\nâMompÃ³ arrived yesterday to stay at the house. Millares and Serrano went the day before. Escassi is staying with Ãngeles Gasset. I saw Greco and Adriansens on the street. The place is full of painters. It is also just plain fullâ\n\nThis year, he buys a number of works from JosÃ© Guerrero, Gustavo Torner and also from Manuel HernÃ¡ndez MompÃ³, who executes Semana Santa en Cuenca expressly for the museum. The inclusion of Chillida in the collection is another of the objectives for this year. Through Antonio Saura, the two artists meet in Cuenca in May and ZÃ³bel asks him to make a piece for the museum. 44. At the end of this year, Chillida tells ZÃ³bel that he has completed the sculpture for Cuenca: Abesti Gogora IV (1959-1964). 45.\n\nWith regard to this sculpture and his conversations with Chillida in various encounters, ZÃ³bel writes about the quality of the Basque artistâs thought and work with extraordinary lucidness:\n\nââChillida, as friendly as ever, tells me that the sculpture is ready. Itâs big. A point of departure for an even bigger one. Maeght doesnât charge commission so we get it for half the normal price: about 350 k (this may be cheap for a Chillida, and indeed it is, but it nearly used up all my resources). From the photograph, you can tell that itâs made of wood, compacted with that strange way of not missing a single detail, so characteristic of Chillida. Heâs been turning it over in his mind for three years. (â¦) From a very early age, Eduardo has wanted to become an artist. The biggest problem he had to face was giving up the architecture degree course heâd started. He didnât want to upset his family but in the end, he found himself forced to abandon the course halfway through. He was talking about the days when he used to play football and about his reputation for ending all the matches in a fight. He has no cuttings from this period of glory and his children (eight of them) can hardly believe him when he says that he played for Real Madrid. (â¦) He works slowly. His ideas spring up as he works. Heâd been working on Abesti Gogora IV for Cuenca since 1961 and finished it just a couple of months ago. Once the work is finished, he doesnât mind parting with it; he knows it by heart (with Manolo MompÃ³, on the other hand, itâs an entirely different matter. Taking a drawing away from Manolo is like pulling out one of his teeth (â¦).â âEduardo Chillida is here for the Canada Cup. He loves golf. He game to dinner with Pili plus Lorenzos. He felt like talking and talked steadily and rather beautifully until two. Mainly, it was Antonio and myself who kept prodding him. In Paris, the two horrible years between figuration and abstraction where he worked every day and could get nothing done. At one point, he decided to return to figuration to recover his footing and found, to his horror, that he no longer knew how. Panic. He walked the Quais for hours â at one point, he remembered stopping in front of a shop window full of clothing â dummies, and telling himself, âAt least the man who made those knew what he was doing.â He decided that perhaps Paris was pushing him out of shape, and he returned to Hernani, recently married, short of funds, the future a complete fog. The lowest point of his life. He suspected that he had burnt himself out as a sculptor\n\nThose drawings of hands. He didnât do them while he was sick; what he did when he was sick was a whole series of squiggly Indian ink abstractions drawn with a Chinese brush. (â¦) My Abesti Gogora, the first of the series; his first sculpture in wood. It took years to finish, with many pauses and false completions. It used to be much larger than it is now. âThe heart is still the same, anything superfluous has to be removed. The sculptor does not see in the same way as a painter does. He looks at things deeply. If he were doing your portrait, he would cease to see a profile. He would focus on the centre of your skull and from here, from within, the forms would issue forth.â Dismisses Calder, Henry Moore (â¦). Likes Giacometti, Lippold. A passion for Medardo Rosso. Told me to check out a virtually unknown, older Spanish painter in Paris, named FernÃ¡ndez. Virtually unknown. Very honest. I asked him to send me photographs or something. We got to talking about people who write about art. Started translating from Lin Yutangâs collections of Chinese excerpts. He was fascinated. âI must have something Chinese somewhere inside my body.â His own favorite is Gaston Bachelard. Those bearded youngsters look down their noses at him; most of the time, they donât have the slightest idea what he is talking about. Bachelard wrote the introduction to Chillidaâs first catalogue. Chillida moved heaven and earth to meet him; once theyâd met, there was a meeting of minds almost instantly. Chillida merely wanted permission to quote from Bachelard; âmais nous sommes frÃ¨res!â, said poet to that and wrote the presentation. (â¦) Chillida never makes models, he draws to establish the mood, then lays the drawings aside and attacks his final materials directly. He tried working from a model once and the results were disastrous. (â¦)â\n\nHe publishes an article about Gerardo Rueda in Manila 46, 6 and also in this year, writes the prologue to the catalogue for the exhibition of the Johnson collection, Arte actual USA. This exhibition is organized by the Directorate General of the Fine Arts and is held in Madrid, at the CasÃ³n del Buen Retiro.\n\n1965 A short trip to Manila, where he prints a portfolio of 24 small etchings, Libro de horas, at Manuel RodrÃ­guezâs workshop, and gives the lecture, Philippine Folk Art.\n\nHe travels to New York on the occasion of his individual exhibition at the Bertha Schaeffer Gallery.\n\nIndividual exhibition at the GalerÃ­a Sur, Santander. Once he has decided to set up the Museum of Abstract Art in Cuenca, his trips to this city are constant; for years, it will be on the road and in the city that he will find most of his themes for landscapes, as in TarancÃ³n (1964), Balcones (1964), Carretera de Valencia (1966) and many others which he will paint in the course of time. Little by little, the city and its surrounding area take possession of the painter and Cuenca fills his notebooks, his pictures and also his writing. In April, back in Cuenca after visiting Manila and New York for the purpose of his exhibition, he writes:\n\nâAs we drive, tensions uncoil. New York seems infinitely remote. I begin to feel like myself again after we pass TarancÃ³n. Flat, cold light with clouds. Felled trees on both sides of the highway for a widening that may take a decade to come. The almond blossoms are gone and the poppies have not yet come; spring on the verge of its second wind. Slowly, my appetite for the shape and color of the meseta reawakens and I begin to feel like a painter again. I havenât really touched a brush in almost three months.â\n\nTrip to Barcelona in October, with Gerardo Rueda and Gustavo Torner, to visit TÃ pies at his studio and buy a major work from him for the museum. ZÃ³bel had already reserved Grand Equerre at the Stadler Gallery in Paris, but he wants to know TÃ piesâ opinion on the matter. In the end, in accordance with TÃ piesâ opinion, this is the work he chooses.\n\n1966 Death of his mother, Fermina Montojo y TorrÃ³ntegui.\n\nIndividual exhibitions at the GalerÃ­a Juana MordÃ³ in Madrid and GalerÃ­a La Pasarela in Seville, where he gives alecture about the Spanish abstract painting of the Cuenca Museum, Pintura abstracta espaÃ±ola en el Museo de Cuenca. ZÃ³bel paints little while the works at the museum are going on. He hangs but two of his pictures: OrnitÃ³ptero (1962) and PequeÃ±a Primavera para Claudio Monteverdi (1966).\n\nWith Hans Hartung, Antonio Lorenzo, Juana MordÃ³, Luis Figueroa Ferretti, Eusebio Sempere and Amparo MartÃ­.\n\nHartung's exhibition at the Sala NeblÃ­. Madrid.\n\n1966\n\nInauguration of the Museo de Arte Abstracto EspaÃ±ol of Cuenca on June 30. The following day, he writes the following about the event:\n\nâSimple inauguration: Governor, Mayor, the President of the Council, Rodrigo Lozano de la Fuente, Fernando NicolÃ¡s and some local newspapermen. I asked Rodrigo to open the door (visibly shaken, surprise and delight), which he did with considerable difficulty, using the big iron key decorated with a purple ribbon. The museum looked beautiful, everything apparently in place. The officials were delighted. We had a cordial and very late dinner, full of ponderous compliments. My feet had swollen and throbbed. I slept like a log. The morning at the museum was quiet. We taped an interview for radio and T.V. The Edurnes came from Madrid and mainly we just sat around, chatting, occasionally going to listen to the comments of the sprinkling of visitors. I had invited nobody, on purpose, so that nobody could claim later on that they had been left out. Therefore, the groups that arrived from Madrid in the afternoon came simply because they felt like coming. There were almost fifty for dinner: Juana MordÃ³ and, of course, the Edurnes, Manuel and Mari Rivera, Manolo and Elvireta Millares, Carmen LaffÃ³n, up from Seville, Jaime Burguillos, a sprinkling of Ruiz de la Prada brothers, Lucio MuÃ±oz and Amalia Avia, Paco LÃ³pez HernÃ¡ndez, Antonio and Margarita Lorenzo, the Paluzzis with a young girl painter from Chicago, very attractive in a yellow shawl and a Cordovan hat, MartÃ­n Chirino and his wife, Alberto Portera and his wife, Isabel Bennet, Eusebio Sempere, Macua, Fernando NuÃ±o, Gerardo and so on and so on. NuÃ±o took a great photograph of the whole group, festooned along the stairway. The groupâs visit to the museum was a great success.â\n\nCasas Colgadas (Cuenca), where the Museum of Spanish Abstract Art is located\n\n1966\n\nInauguration of the Museum of Spanish Abstract Art in Cuenca, June 30.\n\nFrom left to right, front row: JosÃ© MarÃ­a Yturralde, Jordi Teixidor, Salvador Victoria, Eusebio Sempere, Fernando ZÃ³bel and Jaime Burguillos. Back: Gustavo Torner, Lucio MuÃ±oz, LÃ³pez HernÃ¡ndez, Carmen LaffÃ³n, Amalia Avia, Juana MordÃ³, JosÃ© Guerrero, NicolÃ¡s Sahuquillo, Manuel Millares, Gerardo Rueda, MartÃ­n Chirino, Alberto Portera and Manuel Rivera.\n\nPhoto: Fernando NuÃ±o.\n\n1966\n\nA catalogue is published, with an introduction by Fernando ZÃ³bel and black and white photographs by Fernando NuÃ±o of some of the works. On the cover of this, the first catalogue, there is a photograph of the âHanging Housesâ at night. In 1973, Ricard Giralt-Miracle designs a dust cover for the catalogue, showing a photograph of the Blassi brothers, who will work with ZÃ³bel on most of his publishing projects. At the museum, a number of young artists play a part, including Jordi Teixidor and JosÃ© MarÃ­a Yturralde, also NicolÃ¡s Sahuquillo and Ãngel Cruz. By this time, the museum has about 100 works, 12 sculptures, about 200 drawings, engravings and posters and several books, illustrated and engraved by Spanish artists. It is not a didactic historical collection, nor is it a comprehensive representation of Spanish abstract artists. 47, firstly, becaus financial efforts have their limitations 48 and secondly, because a private collection is made in accordance with the collectorâs taste and involves\n\nâa way of seeing as opposed to chance and whim.â\n\nZÃ³bel is made Member of the Order of Alfonso X the Wise for the creation of the museum and is also named Member of the Order of Isabel the Catholic.\n\n1967 With his return to color, ZÃ³bel starts to produces series of paintings, and one of the first to appear in this new stage is DiÃ¡logos, dialogues with paintings, the conversations he has, pencil, pen or brush in hand, with works by other artists. In the main, these conversations take place during his trips, at museums and exhibitions, and are always recorded in some way in his notebooks. They reflect the world surrounding the painter. The works of other artists become a subject for study, for he never copies but contemplates, analyses, interprets, disarranges and rearranges so as to build in his own way (light, movement, color, gesture, intention). During an interview several years later, he explains the significance of this series within his work:\n\nâI think this series will last all my life, until the day I depart this world. The idea behind DiÃ¡logos is to speak of art with art, but with the brushes at the ready. I stand before a picture I like and I prefer to communicate with that work by painting too. Itâs a way of seeing and doing painting and will become a constant in my life, because itâs a pleasure and I see no reason to stop practising itâ¦ When âI speakâ in these dialogues, I concentrate on one facet and the result is not an imitation but a comment. In plagiarism, more often than not, itâs the style thatâs imitated and when I establish one of these dialogues, I canât remember a single instance where the other painterâs style has been the subject of the dialogue.â 49\n\nHis interlocutors are many: Braque, Morandi, Rembrandt, Lotto, Poussin, Tintoretto, Adriaen Coorte, Saenredam, John Singer Sargent, Bonnard, Turner, Monet, etc. With each of them, the conversation is different. For instance, with Degas and Manet, the topic of conversation will be color; with Turner and Monet, chromatic values. About Tintoretto, with whom he holds several dialogues, there are countless drawings throughout his notebooks. When writing of the St. George in Londonâs National Gallery, he says:\n\nâEach goes his own way: he expands and contracts like a boa constrictorâs poison gland. The unquestionable âsâ in raspberry pink, a cloak echoing into a cloud. An âSâ that is always pulled in opposite directions, along a staircase of horizontal movements. The saint throws himself upon the dragon (later to be stolen by Gustav DorÃ©), which will inevitably send him rolling down to the water, together with his cardboard horse. With his lance, he presses a spring to release that well-fed virgin in a gesture somewhere between dread and that of a chubby angel bearing tidings of glory. The body, for instance, might serve to reinforce the diagonal movement and the obedient tree finishes it off. In all of Tintorettoâs work, there are a couple of superposed pictures; at times, they are even contradictory. Here, the theme is not convincing, the gestures even less. The gesture, however, is. Iâm referring to the gesture of the painter. And itâs a strange picture â and part of any. It is no mean task to give life to a series of horizontals. Itâs rather like trying to destroy a commonplace. Kandinsky, who sought to convert his collection of commonplaces into language, would have objected to this series of rebel horizontals and illogical colors (the warm ones marking out the distance within the cold ones). A dialogue in three steps crossing the whole picture (three squares), starting with the Christ and finishing with the water vanishing to the left. Contained within an oval frame, but it is precisely inside the frame that action takes place. The viewer does not stand IN FRONT, he goes round and comes in from the back. Itâs a bit like a picture turned back to front. As if weâd been allowed in with a special pass provided by someone with connections. The plebs â invisible â remain on the outside, in the area of the classical arch.â50\n\nThe opening of the Museo de Arte Abstracto EspaÃ±ol draws the international press and, around this time, many articles about the museum are published (Time Magazine, Architectural Forum, Herald Tribune, Studio International, London Telegraph, Gazette des Beaux Arts, etc.). The museum is visited frequently by specialists, curators and artists. Of particular note is the visit of Alfred H. Barr, the first director of New Yorkâs Museum of Modern Art (MoMA). On January 1 1967, ZÃ³bel writes the following about Barrâs visit:\n\nâMore visitors: Carlos and Charo Reim, Javier Reim, Teixidor with girlfriend, Yturralde with wife and baby. Around noon, Jean Bratton turned up with Alfred Barr from the Museum of Modern Art and his wife. Quiet, elderly, very charming and intelligent. (â¦) Barr saw the place slowly, taking notes. At the end, he asked if he had time for a second round. He did, so he started again at the beginning and repeated the whole tour. Lunch at Sempereâs. Barr leaned over and whispered that he and his wife thought it the most beautiful museum they had ever seen. I asked him if he would repeat that. He said yes, and repeated it aloud. The crowd cheered and we made him honorary curator on the spot. More singing, dancing and so on. The Barrs were obviously enthralled. Barr asked me to help review their Spanish collections at the MoMA. I offered to help fill the gaps.â\n\nFrom this year onwards, Rafael PÃ©rez-Madero will work alongside Fernando ZÃ³bel as secretary, administrator and assistant in all the projects concerning his work and the museum. In addition to working on a publication about his painting, La Serie Blanca, and a short about his work, after his death, he took over management of his work and organized most of the exhibitions, including this one.\n\nLecture on the two currents of Spanish abstract art, Las dos corrientes del arte abstracto espaÃ±ol, at Cuencaâs Casa de Cultura.\n\n1968 Individual exhibition at the Bertha Schaefer Gallery, New York.\n\nAt the end of the sixties, ZÃ³belâs work grows more geometric while, generally speaking, his style becomes colder. In this sense, it reflects the harshness noticeable in nearly all the artistic currents of this decade. In these works, spaces are built by means of lines drawn in pencil, broken lines and impeccable perspectives. Trapeziums, rhombuses and cubes articulate the composition by means of an architectural framework. Series on themes relating to Cuenca start to appear â La fuente, La calle estrecha â, themes alluding to Seville â Conde Ibarra â and themes from classical painting, such as the six dialogues with Pieter Saenredam (1968) and the seven conversations with painter Adriaen Coorte (1968). The essence lies in the practice of developing a theme gradually by means of lots of pictures, drawings, sketches and photographs. After ZÃ³belâs exhibition at Sevilleâs GalerÃ­a La Pasarela the year before, this city starts to form part of his life. In Seville, he becomes a very close friend of painter Carmen LaffÃ³n, with whom and JosÃ© Soto he shares a studio. Also around this time, he strikes up a friendship with the Bonet Correa family and painters JoaquÃ­n SÃ¡enz and Gerardo Delgado.\n\nMunich, Photograph by Cristobal Hara\n\n1968\n\n1969 First photography exhibition, Cuenca y sus niÃ±os at Cuencaâs Casa de Cultura.\n\nA year of intense travelling: New York, Washington and Boston; Teruel and AlbarracÃ­n; London; Munich and Geneva.\n\nHe writes a text about Antonio Lorenzo, titled, Lorenzo.

Bernard, a great friend of ZÃ³belâs from Manila, recalled the matter: âThere was an amusing incident when we first got Fernando ZÃ³bel to lecture in the Ateneo Graduate School. The Dean of Graduate Studies asked him to give a quick lecture, followed by a period for questions and discussion. ZÃ³belâs first question was: âHow much do you pay?â This was a disconcerting question coming from Fernando ZÃ³bel. The dean said: âThirty pesos an hour, sixty for the two-hour period.â ZÃ³bel replied: âThat is respectable.â But at the end of each term, he would take this cheque, endorse it, give it back and say: âUse this money to buy reproductions of famous paintings. Have them framed and charge the cost of the framing to me.â Miguel A. Bernard, âFernando ZÃ³bel, an artist and scholar. 1924-1984â, Kinaadman, vol. VII, 1, Manila, 1985, p. 53.\n\n32. In the notebook âF.Z.A. 1958-1959â, p. 51.\n\n33. As the years go by, ZÃ³bel continues to give his support to these artists through gestures like the one he showed when his nephew, Jaime ZÃ³bel de Ayala, was the Philippine ambassador in London: he gave him an important collection of works by Philippine painters, to be put on show at the embassy, thus indirectly disseminating their work abroad.

Iâd almost finished the pictures that happened to have a chair opposite. Drawing the pictures is a way of seeing them. It cleanses the eyes and leaves the most unexpected things in the subconscious.â Fernando ZÃ³bel, Madrid, August 21 1962.\n\n42. Fernando ZÃ³bel, Madrid, October 29 1964.\n\n43.

(â¦) Direct, friendly, obviously intelligent and very well-informed. (â¦) Chillida loves Greece. He spoke on and on. He feels their art (he kept using the adjective, noble; a good indication of the sort of thing he is after himself) is a direct consequence of the quality of light (if the light has the quality, why has the art it produces dried up for two thousand years?). He enthused over the museum.I asked him to do one of his wooden things for the first landing.â Fernando ZÃ³bel, Cuenca, May 1964.\n\n45. Chillida could not answer him during their first encounter because, initially, this piece had been allocated to the Houston Fine Arts Museum, which finally bought the first and last of the Abesti Gogora series, both of which were executed in granite.\n\n46. âRuedaâ, The Chronicle Magazine, Vol. XIX, nÂº 8, Manila, February 22 1964.\n\n47. In 1966, painters represented at the museum include, amongst others, Antonio Saura and the other members of the El Paso Group, Cuixart, TÃ pies, Tharrats, Millares, Chillida, JosÃ© Guerrero, Lucio MuÃ±oz, Antonio Lorenzo, Gerardo Rueda, Gustavo Torner, Sempere, NÃ©stor Basterrechea, JosÃ© MarÃ­a Labra and ZÃ³bel.\n\n48. Although ZÃ³belâs financial resources were solid, the effort deployed during this period was considerable. To cope with the great expense involved in opening the museum (frames, lighting, books for the library, furniture and fittings, personnel, maintenance and so on), ZÃ³bel sold his magnificent collection of stamps. Furthermore, we know that, during this period, he gave away several houses, paid the hospital bills of two sick friends (AgustÃ­n Albalat and Antonio Magaz Sangro) for many years; any artist in trouble who came to him for help would always find him willing; he saved a Valencian review from closure; in 1964, he donated a collection of drawings by Spanish abstract artists to the Fogg Art Museum at Harvard University, and so on and so forth.\n\n49.
