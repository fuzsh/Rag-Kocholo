        "text": "Chapter 1\n\nIberia in Revolt\n\nAt the beginning of 1808 no one would have considered it possible. Spain was a docile ally of Napoleon and Portugal a country abandoned by its rulers and firmly occupied by a large French army Yet by the end of the year the entire Iberian peninsula was in the grip of a great insurrection against the emperor and Lisbon was firmly in the hands of British troops. How this change had come about is one of the strangest stories of the entire Napoleonic period, but it is one that has been told many times elsewhere, not least by the present author. In consequence, it will here suffice to give only the barest details. In the summer of 1807 a Napoleon Bonaparte fresh from the greatest triumph of his career – the defeat of the Russians at Friedland and the subsequent negotiation of an alliance with Tsar Alexander I of Russia – received a sudden and unwelcome slap in the face. Under the very noses of a French army, a British fleet and expeditionary force attacked Copenhagen and sequestered the Danish fleet. Unable to accept this blow to his prestige and anxious in any case to find new sources of glory, Napoleon cast about for a riposte and found exactly what he wanted in the neutral but pro-British state of Portugal. With the willing assistance of the Spaniards, whose rulers were eager to reverse Spain’s loss of the neighbouring kingdom in the 1640s, by October 1807 a large army was therefore bearing down on Lisbon under General Junot. But just at this very moment a major political crisis broke out in Spain. Thanks to years of war, epidemic and natural disaster, Spain was at one of the lowest ebbs in her entire history with trade and industry at a standstill and the population wracked by famine and disease. All this, meanwhile, was laid at the door of Manuel de Godoy, the extraordinary adventurer who had since the 1790s been the favourite of the king and queen, Charles IV and Maréa Luisa.\n\nThat Godoy was venal and corrupt there is no doubt, just as it is also the case that his foreign policy – in brief, temporary alliance with France – had brought with it terrible costs while at the same time failing to deliver the benefits for which he hoped. Yet he was not the villain of legend. A scion of the petty nobility, he had from the beginning faced the hostility of the great magnates, while his espousal of a variety of reforms of the type associated with the reign of King Charles III (1759–1788) had antagonised many of Spain’s élites, including, not least, the Catholic Church. From the mid-1790s elements of the clergy and the aristocracy had begun to intrigue against him, while the fact that many of Godoy’s reforms – for example, his abolition of bullfighting and expropriation of the lands of the Church – had had a serious impact on wide swathes of the populace made it easy for them to buttress their manoeuvres with a veneer of populism. In the first years of the nineteenth century fuel was added to the flames when the heir to the throne, Prince Ferdinand, became ever more convinced that Godoy was out to seize the throne for himself As such, the prince, who was, to put it mildly, distinctly lacking in intelligence, was an obvious target for manipulation, and very soon a group of conspirators had in effect colonised him as a useful figurehead under whom they would be able to turn back the tide of royal reformism. However, Ferdinand was not just a tool in their hands, but also a means by which they could mobilise ever greater levels of popular support, and so in a mounting propaganda offensive the prince was made out to be a veritable ‘Prince Charming’ who would remedy all Spain’s ills and usher in a new golden age. Yet the more hatred of Godoy was stoked up, the more it was feared that the favourite would make a bid for the throne in the wake of the death of Charles IV (something that was generally judged to be a likely occurrence given the king’s age and increasing infirmity). In order further to reinforce their position, the conspirators therefore encouraged Ferdinand to make overtures to Napoleon and, in particular, seek a Bonaparte bride. The result was crisis: tipped off by person or persons unknown, Charles jumped to the conclusion that a plot was afoot to oust him and quickly had Ferdinand and his chief supporters arrested.\n\nHowever much it was justified, this move proved catastrophic. In the first place, public opinion was outraged, for the whole affair was held to be a dastardly plot to get rid of Ferdinand. And, in the second, it led directly to Napoleonic intervention. Despite what has often been written, the emperor appears to have had no fixed intentions in respect of the Spanish monarchy French troops had been pouring into northern Spain certainly, but they were primarily there to safeguard the communications of the troops who had been sent to Portugal. However, the French ruler was already gravely dissatisfied with Spain as an ally, and the discovery that the court was riven with faction was in consequence one that was most unfortunate. Political disruption in the Iberian peninsula was not something Napoleon could afford, but at the same time the idea took root in his mind that a Spain ruled by a Bonaparte monarch would be a Spain that would be able to contribute far more to the imperial war effort, while her increased naval power would enable him to get his hands on the wealth of Spanish America.\n\nYet even now catastrophe might have been averted. All the reports from Spain suggested that the best option would be to overthrow Charles IV and Godoy, and install Ferdinand on the throne in their stead, and there is some evidence that Napoleon was still toying with this idea as late as January 1808. At this point, however, the emperor swung decisively in favour of turning Spain into a satellite kingdom with one of his brothers on the throne. Though it is clear enough that there was nothing holding the French ruler back – his contempt for the Spanish army was as massive as his conviction that any popular resistance could be crushed with the proverbial ‘whiff of grapeshot’ – precisely why he reached this decision is uncertain: perhaps he simply could not resist a fresh tour de force of the sort that had been buttressing his power and reputation ever since 1796; perhaps, too, his hand was forced by events in the eastern Mediterranean and the Balkans where Russian pressure was forcing him inexorably into an attack on the Ottoman Empire. But, whatever the reason, at the end of February French troops suddenly seized Spain’s chief border fortresses and marched on Madrid. It was truly a make-or-break moment, and, beyond that, one which Napoleon was to regret for the rest of his career.\n\nMutiny at Aranjuez\n\nBy the end of 1807 thousands of French troops had entered Spain. Among the men marching in the ranks of the corps commanded by General Dupont was Louis François Gille. Born in Paris on 29 February 1788 to parents who are described as bourgeois rentiers, Gille had been a rather sickly boy who had entertained dreams of becoming an actor, but in April 1807 he was conscripted into the army, becoming a private in the leme Légion du Reserve. Soon promoted fourrier (quartermaster-sergeant), in December of the same year he found himself in Spain. An honest observer, he was later to admit that the onward march of the occupation forces was accompanied with much disorder:\n\nPancorbo is situated at the foot of two high mountains. A fort crowns the higher of the two and commands the road. The sight piqued my curiosity, and, despite my fatigue, I decided to pay it a visit. The rocks were covered with snow and it was only with the greatest difficulty that I managed to reach the summit. Inside the fort I found … several cannon and piles of cannon balls. If it should ever come to war, I could see that it would be very advantageous to hold the position. On the side that overlooks the road, the mountain forms an absolute precipice … while on the side that overlooks the town the slope is still so steep that when a group of soldiers, who had doubtless climbed up to that spot for the same reason as me, threw some of the cannon balls down the hill for fun … they picked up such a speed that one of them … knocked flat one of the houses. Immediately the whole town was in an uproar, while, as for us, the crash put an immediate end to our promenade.⁴\n\nVery soon, then, Gille began to encounter signs of hostility:\n\nI was billeted on my own in a house outside [Vitoria]. I only saw a woman there when I went there to deposit my things, but, coming back from an errand a while later, I encountered a brown-skinned man with a thick beard and a pair of black eyes that were shadowed by bristling eyebrows. He was occupied in fitting a new flint to a fowling piece, and appeared to be a day labourer. He had a hard air about him, while his manner was not at all pleasant: watching me out of the corner of his eye, he turned to his wife, and appeared to ask her what he should do with me. We spent the evening in silence sitting by the fire: it was impossible to engage them in conversation as at this point I had no knowledge of their language. The time to turn in having arrived, I left my hosts, and went to the room which they had given me. I was not frightened, but even so I thought that I had better take some precautions. The bed was … very heavy, and I could not move it, but I stacked all the chairs that were in the room in front of the door (unfortunately, this could not be locked from inside) in such a manner that no one could come in without knocking them over and waking me up on account of the noise. My musket and sword, meanwhile, I placed beside me. Nor did I have any reason to regret all this. I had hardly been asleep two hours when I was awoken with a start by the noise of the chairs I had placed against the door being knocked over. The Spaniard whose features had inspired little confidence in me was coming into my room. In one hand he held a lantern, while the other one was hidden in the cloak in which he was swathed. I lay perfectly quiet, but in my hand I held my sabre, which I had had the sense to take out of its scabbard. Having taken a turn around the room – I think he was looking for my weapons – the Spaniard approached my bed and made as if to withdraw his hand from beneath the blanket. At once I sprang up and shouted, ‘What do you want?’ Immediately he stopped dead, and frightened by my expression, mumbled a few words in Spanish which I did not understand. With my sword I pointed to the door, and he did not hang about. Piling the chairs up against the door again, I went back to bed and soon fell asleep … but after that, a soldier of the company always lodged with me.⁵\n\nIf the Spaniards were feeling sore, it was not surprising, for the presence of a French army was never easy Among the witnesses to the realities of occupation was Robert Brindle, a young seminarian from Lancashire who was studying at the college which the English Catholic Church had maintained at Valladolid since the late sixteenth century:\n\nThe soldiers were quartered in private houses and brought distress and misery into every family Their right to anything which they chose to covet few had the hardihood to call into question. If complaint were made, it [had to] be proffered to a French officer, and insult or an additional grievance was the usual result. If any man dared to raise his hand in defence of his wife and children, he was immediately hurried to the prison, and before the lapse of many hours consigned to the gallows. Daily instances occurred where the husband generously sacrificed himself in defending the virtue of his wife and children. Such was our state in time of peace.⁶\n\nIn so far as the conduct of the French army was concerned, it did not help that, in a gesture typical of the extreme over-confidence with which Napoleon approached the Spanish venture, the troops he had dispatched across the Pyrenees were in large part raw recruits. Another of the men commanded by General Dupont was Sébastien Blaze, a native of Avignon and the second son of a family of some property and status who had become a pharmacist in the army’s medical services:\n\nI joined the Second Corps of Observation of the Gironde at Valladolid … On 15 March we conducted manoeuvres in a plain outside the town, and the divisional commander General Malher was killed by a ramrod which a soldier had carelessly left in the barrel of his musket. An inspection was immediately made of all the arms of the regiment that had fired the fatal volley to discover the culprit, and it was found that no fewer than eighteen ramrods had been shot away in the same fashion.⁷\n\nAs yet, however, friction remained relatively low-level. Most Spaniards were still convinced that the French had come to Spain to overthrow the hated Godoy and replace Charles IV with Ferdinand VII. For an insight into the thinking of the educated classes, we can turn to José Clemente Carnicero Torribio, an ecclesiastic living in Madrid:\n\nThe French troops continued to enter in ever larger numbers. After their treacherous plans were revealed, it was often said that they should not have been allowed to pass. But who could have stopped them? The army was split up all over the place, while public opinion had been thoroughly alienated by the predominance of Godoy. All that an attempt to block the way would have done would therefore have been to give Napoleon a pretext to declare war on Spain and send the full weight of his forces against her so as to achieve her conquest. And, far from waging a determined war against him, the people of Spain would have been so anxious to overthrow the yoke of Godoy that they would have seconded his efforts. In any case, we were being told that the French had come to protect Ferdinand, of which it was held to be proof that the emperor had offered him the hand of one of his nieces in marriage … In the year 1801 Napoleon had again sent a large army to conquer Portugal. This had got as far as Salamanca and yet, as soon as he changed his mind, he withdrew the troops concerned without molesting the Spaniards in the slightest. Why would the same thing not happen on this occasion? In so far as the troops in Castile were concerned, the newspapers gave out on the one hand that their purpose was to aid the ones that had been sent to Portugal, and on the other … that it was to escort him when he came to … Madrid to … bring down Godoy and marry his niece to Prince Ferdinand. These conjections, meanwhile, were strengthened by the fact that Godoy was known to be planning to move out of his magnificent palace and selling much of the exquisite furniture which had filled its rooms … These ideas were so commonplace that little girls in the poorer quarters were singing rhymes which attributed all these removals to the coming of Napoleon.⁸\n\nAlong with the rest of Dupont’s forces, Blaze soon found himself bearing down on Madrid. When the threat to the capital brought about a military coup that placed Ferdinand on the throne the joy of the populace knew no bounds. Louis François Lejeune was a 32-year-old officer of Alsatian stock who had made a great name for himself as an artist and had been sent to Spain to report on the situation for Napoleon’s chief-of-staff, Marshal Berthier:\n\nThe troops of the emperor had been received as friends throughout the peninsula … Everywhere our soldiers were welcomed as liberators, and all along my route I found towns, villages and even isolated houses prepared to celebrate the expected arrival of the emperor. On every road laurel branches had been cut down to form triumphal arches beneath which the emperor, the redresser of the grievances of the people, was to pass … The Spaniards had long been discontented at the position occupied by Manuel de Godoy … Spanish sailors had shed their blood in our service at Trafalgar, a Spanish army under the Marqueés de la Romana had fought side-by-side with the French in … Germany, and the loyal populace, who now received us as if we were their brothers, impatiently awaited the day when the emperor should arrive at Madrid. They hoped that he would replace the hated minister and restore the royal authority to Charles IV, or place it in the hands of his son, Ferdinand.⁹\n\nThat none of this was wishful thinking is suggested by the wild scenes that had greeted the fall of Godoy One eyewitness here was an inhabitant of Salamanca named Joaquín Encinas de los Arcos Zahonero:\n\nOn 22 March there arrived the – for many reasons – great news of the serious disturbances that had … put an end to the primacy of D. Manuel de Godoy In the afternoon … the students rioted and came to the Plaza [Mayor] where they encountered the governor of this city, the Marqués de Zayas. After spending some time throwing stones at the medallion of Godoy which Zayas had put up … with great pomp in August 1806, they forced him to fetch a pickaxe and smash it with his own hands … Once that was out of the way, they demanded that he should authorise a bullfight … which he conceded, and caused the bells of the … university and the cathedral to be rung. So crazy were they that that same night they went to the house of the Archdeacon of Salamanca, who was a cousin of Godoy, and there committed a thousand stupidities. The only reason nothing worse was done was that the Archdeacon happened to be away, but even so they still broke all his windows.¹⁰\n\nIn Madrid, meanwhile, there had been similar attacks on those associated with Godoy José Maria Blanco y Crespo, who later went into exile in England and became famous as Joseph Blanco White, was a 32-year-old priest from Seville who had the previous year secured a teaching post at a model school established in Madrid by Manuel de Godoy:\n\nNight had scarcely come on when a furious mob invaded the house of Don Diego, the favourite’s younger brother. The ample space which the magnificent Calle de Alcalá leaves at its opening into the Prado, of which that house forms a corner, afforded room not only for the operations of the rioters, but for a multitude of spectators, of whom I was one myself The house having been broken into and found deserted, the whole of the rich furniture it contained was thrown out at the windows. Next came down the very doors and fixtures of all kinds which, made into an enormous pile with tables, bedsteads, chests of drawers and pianos, were soon in a blaze that, but for the stillness of the evening, might have spread to the unoffending neighbourhood. Having enjoyed this splendid and costly bonfire, the mob ranged themselves in a kind of procession, bearing lint torches taken from the numerous chandlers shops which are found at Madrid, and directed their steps to the house of the Prince [of] Branciforte, Godoy’s brother-in-law. The magistrates, however, had by this time fixed a board on the doors both of that and Godoy’s own house, giving notice that the property both of the favourite and his near relations had been confiscated by the new king. This was sufficient to turn away the mob from the remaining objects of their fury, and without any further mischief they were contented with spending the whole night bearing about lighted torches and drinking at the expense of the wine retailers, whose shops … are the common resort of the vulgar. The riot did not cease with the morning. Crowds of men and women paraded the streets the whole day with cries of ‘Long live King Ferdinand! Death to Godoy!’ The whole garrison of Madrid were allured out of their barracks by women bearing pitchers of wine in their hands, and a procession was seen about the place in the afternoon, where the soldiers, mixed with the people, bore in their firelocks the palm branches which, as a protection against lightning, are commonly hung at the windows.¹¹\n\nCelebrations came to a head on 23 March when Ferdinand rode into Madrid from Aranjuez as el rey deseado. Antonio Alcalá Galiano was a 19-year-old student and the son of a leading naval officer who had been killed at Trafalgar:\n\nMounted on horseback, Ferdinand was accompanied by only a very small suite. He was followed by the Guardias de Corps but his way was not lined with troops in the fashion that is usual when the king and queen arrive in the city or put in an appearance at some public ceremony However, what was lacking in pomp was made up by the rejoicing of the crowd. This reached a pitch that was higher than anything that can possibly be imagined. In truth, in all the different scenes of popular enthusiasm that I have witnessed, nothing … has ever equalled those which I now describe. The cheers were loud, repeated and delivered with … eyes full of tears of pleasure, kerchiefs were waved … from balconies with hands trembling with pleasure … and not for a moment did the passion … or the thunderous noise of the joyful crowd diminish.¹²\n\nHowever, the joy of Ferdinand’s accession proved short-lived, for just at this moment Napoleon’s pincers snapped shut. Recently sent to Spain as the head of the French forces there, Marshal Murat refused to recognise Ferdinand as King of Spain, while Charles IV was encouraged to protest against the abdication that had been forced on him at Aranjuez and declare it null and void. With father and son ranged against one another, the emperor was in a perfect position to intervene, and so the entire royal family was summoned to a conference with him, along with the unfortunate Godoy Initially, it was given out that Napoleon was coming to Spain and that the meeting would take place in Burgos or Vitoria, but in fact the French ruler had resolved to hold it at Bayonne. In short, the Bourbon dynasty was riding into a trap. An eyewitness to the movements of Ferdinand in particular was Louis Lejeune:\n\nA rumour began to spread among us that the emperor meant to place the crown of Spain on the head of one of his own brothers or generals, and the event proved that the rumour was not without foundation … Murat was now at Madrid at the head of an army, and in compliance with the wish of the emperor he lost no time in urging the Prince of Asturias [i.e. Ferdinand VII] to go to Bayonne. That prince … set off accompanied by … an escort so strong … that I could not help suspecting that he was to be taken prisoner … I had the honour of saluting the prince … as he rode through Burgos … I was sorely tempted to give him a private hint to escape … but to save a prince who inspired me with very little personal interest I should have had to betray the emperor. The situation was very grave and with deep regret I confined myself to my narrow round of duties, leaving deeper issues in the hands of Providence. On his arrival at Vitoria the prince began to suspect the trap prepared for him and under various pretexts put off his departure. But the task of taking him to Bayonne had been confided to a man who knew what he was about, and when the unhappy prince realised the impossibility of escaping from his escort, he allowed himself to be led whither they would without resistance. ¹³\n\nDos de Mayo\n\nBy the end of April excitement was at fever pitch. Among those who recorded the atmosphere in Madrid was José María Blanco y Crespo:\n\nThe wildest schemes for the destruction of the French … were canvassed almost in public and with very little reserve. Nothing, indeed, so completely betrays our present ignorance as to the power and efficiency of regular troops as the projects which were circulated in the capital for an attack on the French corps which still paraded every Sunday morning in the Prado. Short pikes headed with a sharp cutting crescent were expected to be distributed to the spectators who used to range themselves behind the cavalry At one signal the horse were to be houghed [hamstrung] with these instruments and the infantry attacked with poignards. To remonstrate against such absurd and visionary plans or to caution their advocates against an unreserved display of hostile views, which, of itself, would be enough to defeat the ablest conspiracy, was not only useless but dangerous. ¹⁴\n\nAt this point Charles IV’s youngest son, Francisco de Paula, was still in Madrid, but on 1 May rumours spread that he, too, was to be sent to France. By dawn the next day, then, a large crowd had gathered around the royal palace. Alarmed by the growing noise – his headquarters was only a few hundred yards away – Murat ordered an officer named Auguste Lagrange to assess the situation. This, however, proved to be the proverbial red rag to a bull. With stories going around that the 6-year-old Francisco de Paula was in tears and did not want to go, Lagrange was promptly set upon. Seeing the commotion, Murat now took action. Mobilising the nearest available troops – a detachment of the Imperial Guard which he had been given as a personal escort – he ordered them to clear the scene. A few moments later a thunderous discharge rang out, and ten Spaniards lay dead or wounded on the cobbles, the rest of the crowd hastily dispersing in search of shelter. Yet the gunfire had made things worse rather than better. Within minutes, streets throughout the city were full of confused and angry citizens convinced that the French were out to massacre them. Catching up whatever weapons they could lay their hands on, they quickly fell on those Frenchmen unfortunate enough to be caught in the city (albeit there were very few, almost all Murat’s 10,000 troops being encamped in the surrounding open country). Something of the atmosphere is conveyed by Alcalá Galiano:\n\nI was getting dressed when my mother came in looking frightened. All she said to me were the words, ‘It has begun’. There was no need to say what it was she was talking about … In a moment, having got dressed anyhow, I was in the street … Scattered shots began to be heard in the distance … On all sides bands of people were beginning to come together, although they were armed in such a ridiculous fashion that they had to be crazy to think that they could do away with French soldiers. I joined one group that was led by a young lad who was some sort of artisan … and we headed for the Calle de Fuencarral. But some of them were insisting that we should go to the barracks and join the troops, and others that we should fall upon the French straight away … In the course of the argument, one of the men turned to me and asked me what I thought. ‘I am unarmed, and am therefore going home,’ I replied … One of the others then swore an oath and rounded on me, but, having first taken hold of me and noted my pale complexion, my well-brought-up appearance and my boyish look … said to me scornfully, ‘You are no good for anything.’ Though probably true enough given the task that my new acquaintances had embarked upon, this remark did not please me at all, and so, being close to where I lived, I slipped away, went into my house and then came out again wearing an army bicorn … No sooner had I stepped into the street than I encountered an officer and asked him what was going on. At this he asked what unit I belonged to … To this I had to admit that I was a student, whereupon he said that I should go home. The garrison, he continued, had been ordered not just to remain aloof, but to restore order by opening fire on the rioters … while the French were massing in such numbers that nobody would be able to withstand them. In short, to continue on my way would bring me to a sticky end.¹⁵\n\nAmong the Frenchmen unlucky enough to be caught in the streets was a captain in the Marins de la Garde named Jean Grivel:\n\nI had just crossed the little Plaza de Santo Domingo and was having a chat with our adjutant-major, who was on his way to the Post Office. I myself was on my way to the hospital, and as the two buildings are side-by-side, we decided to walk over together. We had barely gone a few yards when we heard several volleys of musketry at which point the people around us began to run in all directions. Catching hold of a passing priest by his cloak, we asked him what was going on. Seeing that we were French, however, he took to his heels with such speed that part of the cloak got torn off and was left in our hands. A little further on we came across an old Walloon Guard who said to us, ‘Gentlemen, if you value your lives, hide your cockades: they are murdering your comrades.’ We continued on our way, but, although we were very worried, we did not hasten our steps … The Spaniards must have found it a very odd sight to see two officers in full dress decked out in so much gold as to be veritable chalices calmly strolling through the streets amidst the sound of so much gunfire. We were sensible enough not to give any sign of agitation, and I am convinced that the calm we displayed saved our lives … At length we arrived at the hospital. An angry crowd had already massed around it and was with difficulty being held back by the picket of fifty men who formed its guard. The main door was provided with an iron grill, and we pulled this shut behind us. It was high time, as the mob had started to throw stones. We then decided that we ought to arm all the sick who could stand. The man who had the key to the armoury was therefore called, but he was unwilling to give it to us and in general played the fool. As there was not a moment to lose if we were to save the hospital, I told him to give me the key or else, but he just made faces at me, so I dealt him a … blow with my sabre … I have often regretted the necessity of having to draw my sword on so mean a fellow, but I really was doing no more than my duty: the mob were hurling themselves at the door … and the lives of the sick were in peril. Pretty soon a detachment of troops reached us from the Prado and restored our communications. At the head of them we encountered Colonel Fréderich of the Fusiliers de la Garde. He was attired in a dressing-gown and a round hat and armed with a sabre that he had taken from a dead trumpeter … for the outbreak of the riot had caught him in the bath and he had had no option but to rush out half naked … The verve with which we thanked this brave man can well be imagined.¹⁶\n\nIf Grivel and his companions survived, it was in large part due to the vigour displayed by Marshal Murat. Hardly had firing broken out than riders were galloping from his headquarters to summon help from the French camps situated at such suburban villages as El Pardo and Chamartín. Meanwhile, having quickly cleared the street in front of the royal palace, the men who had been protecting Murat’s headquarters were already fighting their way towards the heart of the city Among the men who saw them was José María Blanco y Crespo:\n\nMy house stood not far from the palace in a street leading to … the best part of the town. A rush of people crying ‘To arms!’ conveyed to us the first notice of the tumult. I heard that French troops were firing on the people, but the outrage appeared to me both so impolitic and [so] enormous that I could not rest until I went out to ascertain the truth. I had just arrived at an opening named Plazuela de Santo Domingo, the meeting point of four large streets, one of which leads to the palace, when, hearing the sound of a French drum in that direction, I stopped with a considerable number of quiet and decent people whom curiosity kept riveted to the spot. Though a strong picket of infantry was fast advancing upon us, we could not imagine that we stood in any kind of danger. Under this mistaken notion we awaited their approach, but, seeing the soldiers halt and prepare their arms, we began instantly to disperse. A discharge of musketry followed in a few moments, and a man fell at the entrance of the street through which I was, with a great multitude, retreating from the fire. The fear of an indiscriminate massacre arose so naturally from this initial assault that everyone tried to look for safety in the narrow cross streets on both sides of the way I hastened on towards my own house, and, having shut the front door, could think of no better expedient, in the confused state of my mind, than to make ball cartridges for a fowling piece which I kept … A well-dressed man had in the meantime gone down the street calling loudly on the male inhabitants to repair to an old depot of arms. But he made no impression on that part of the town. The attempt to arm the multitude at this moment was, in truth, little short of madness. In a short time after the beginning of the tumult, two or three columns of infantry entered by different gates, making themselves masters of the town. The route of the main corps lay through the Calle Mayor, where the houses, consisting of four or five storeys, afforded the inhabitants the means of wreaking their vengeance on the French without much danger from their arms. Such as had guns fired from the windows, while tiles, bricks and heavy articles of furniture were thrown by others upon the heads of the soldiers.¹⁷\n\nSimilar scenes, meanwhile, were witnessed by Blanco White’s fellow priest, José Clemente Carnicero Torribio, when other troops reached the southern fringes of the city:\n\nMost of the people had nothing other than knives and sticks, while the few fowling pieces that they possessed were for the most part poorly maintained and short of ammunition. Yet despite this, blind with rage and fury, some fired on the French from windows and street corners … others flung themselves on their very ranks … and still others hurled stones, pieces of furniture and kitchen utensils from the balconies, where they were joined by women armed with cauldrons of boiling water. In short, it really seemed as if there was not a single soul who was not disposed to water the streets with French blood … even if it should be at the cost of their own.¹⁸\n\nHowever, with thousands of French troops encamped around the city, all the heroism in the world could not save the revolt. Among the troops hastening to restore order was Marcellin de Marbot, a 26-year-old aristocrat who had enlisted in the First Regiment of Hussars in 1799, and had in January 1808 been attached to Murat’s headquarters as an aide-de-camp:\n\nMy orders were to bring the divisions to the Puerta del Sol, and they started at a gallop. The squadrons of the Guard … marched first with the Mamelukes leading. The riot had had time to increase: we were fired upon from nearly all the windows, especially the palace of the Duque de Hijar, where every [one] was lined with good shots. We lost several men there … but for the moment it was impossible to halt, and the cavalry rode on rapidly under a hail of bullets. In the Puerta del Sol we found … a huge compact crowd of armed men … On seeing the dreaded Mamelukes arrive, the Spaniards made some attempt at resistance, but the sight of the Turks’ alarmed the bravest of them too much for their resolution to last long. The Mamelukes, dashing scimitar in hand into the dense mass, sent a hundred heads flying in a trice, and opened a way for the chasseurs and dragoons, who set to furiously with their sabres. The Spaniards … tried to escape by the many wide streets which met there … but they were stopped by other French columns whom Murat had bidden to assemble at that point … The insurgents who had fired so briskly from the Duque de Hijar’s palace … had had the impudent boldness to remain at their post, and recommenced their fire as our squadrons returned. These, however, indignant at the sight of their comrades’ bodies, penetrated into the palace … pitilessly massacred every insurgent that they met … Not one escaped and their corpses, thrown over the balconies, mingled their blood with that of the Mamelukes whom they had slaughtered.¹⁹\n\nOnly at the army’s artillery depot was the French counter-attack met with a degree of resistance that gave it real pause. Exceptionally, a small group of soldiers led by three officers named Luis Daoiz, Pedro Velarde and Jacinto Ruíz had joined the rioters at the depot, and together they had dragged out two field guns to defend the main gates. Yet in a very short time they, too, were overwhelmed, and the French were able to restore order. Reprisals were surprisingly limited – if 113 prisoners were shot, the figure might have been much greater – but the atmosphere in the capital was none the less one of the most abject terror. Let us here again quote Blanco y Crespo:\n\nHearing that the tumult had ceased, I ventured out in the afternoon towards the Puerta del Sol, where I expected to learn some particulars of the day. The cross streets which led to that place were unusually empty, but, as I came to the entrance of one of the avenues which open into that great rendezvous of Madrid, the bustle increased, and I could see … two pieces of cannon and a very strong division of troops. Less than this hostile display would have been sufficient to check my curiosity if, still possessed with the idea that it was not the interest of the French to treat us like enemies, I had not, like many others who were on the same spot, thought that the peaceful inhabitants would be allowed to proceed unmolested about the streets of the town. Under this impression I went on without hesitation till … a sudden cry of ‘Aux armes!’, raised in the square, was repeated by the soldiers before me, the officer giving the command to make ready The people fled up the street in the utmost consternation, but, my fear having allowed me instantly to calculate both distances and danger, I made a desperate push towards the opening left by the soldiers, where a narrow lane, winding round the church of San Luis, put me in a few seconds out of the range of the French muskets. No firing, however, being heard, I concluded that the object of the alarm was to clear the streets at the approach of night. The increasing horror of the inhabitants, as they collected the melancholy details of the morning, would have accomplished that end without any further effort on the part of the oppressors. The bodies … seen in several places, the wounded that were met about the streets, the visible anguish of such as missed their relations and the spreading report that many were awaiting their fate … so strongly and painfully raised the apprehensions of the people that the streets were absolutely deserted long before the approach of night. Every street door was locked, and a mournful silence prevailed wherever I directed my steps … A night passed under such impressions baffles my feeble powers of description. A scene of cruelty and treachery exceeding all limits of probability had left our apprehensions to range at large with scarcely any check from the calculations of judgement. The dead silence of the streets since the first approach of night, only broken by the trampling of horses which now and then were heard passing in large parties, had something exceedingly dismal in a populous town, where we were accustomed to an incessant and enlivening bustle. The Madrid cries, the loudest and most varied in Spain, were missed early next morning, and it was ten o’clock before a single street door had been opened. Nothing but absolute necessity could induce the people to venture out.²⁰\n\nFar away in Bayonne, the future of the Spanish monarchy had still not been officially settled. In consequence, brought to the chateau of Marrac by none other than Marbot, the news of the Dos de Mayo was a most useful windfall as it afforded Napoleon all the pretext that he could need:\n\nFrom Madrid to Bayonne is … 225 leagues, a long journey when one has to ride post with one’s sword by one’s side without a single quarter of an hour’s rest and in a scorching heat … I got there on 5 May, covered with dust, at the moment when the emperor was taking an after-dinner walk in the park with the queen of Spain on his arm and Charles IV beside him … As soon as the emperor was informed by the aide-de-camp on duty that an officer had arrived with dispatches from Prince Murat, he came towards me followed by members of the Spanish royal family and asked aloud, ‘What news from Madrid?’ The presence of the listeners was embarrassing, and … I deemed it wise to do nothing but present my dispatches to the emperor and look steadily at him without answering his question. His Majesty understood me, and retired a few paces to read Murat’s report. Having finished, he called me and went towards a solitary garden-walk, asking me all the time many questions about the fighting at Madrid. I could easily see that he shared Murat’s opinion and considered that the victory of 2 May must put an end to all resistance in Spain. I held the contrary belief … but I had to confine myself to answering the emperor’s questions with due respect, and I could only indirectly let him know my presentiments … I might, perhaps, have revealed all my thoughts, but Napoleon cut short my thoughts, exclaiming, ‘Bah! They will calm down and bless me as soon as they see their country freed from the discredit and disorder into which it has been thrown by the weakest and most corrupt administration that ever existed.’ After this outburst … Napoleon sent me back to the end of the garden to request the king and queen of Spain to come to him, and followed me slowly reading over Murat’s dispatches. The ex-sovereigns came forward alone to meet the emperor, and I suppose he informed them of the fighting at Madrid, for Charles came up to … Ferdinand and said to him in a loud voice and in a tone of extreme anger, ‘Wretch! You may now be satisfied! Madrid has been bathed in the blood of my subjects shed in consequence of your criminal rebellion against your father: may their blood be on your head!’ The queen joined in heaping bitter reproaches on her son and went so far as to offer to strike him. The ladies and the officers, feeling that this distasteful spectacle was not one for them, withdrew, and Napoleon put a stop to it. Ferdinand, who had not replied by a single word to the objurgations of his parents, resigned the crown to his father that evening, less through contrition than through fear of being regarded as the author of the conspiracy which had overthrown Charles. Next day the old king … made over to the emperor all his rights to the throne of Spain on certain conditions … Thus was consummated the most iniquitous spoliation which modern history records.²¹\n\nInsurrection\n\nThis is not the place to discuss the exact nature of the events that followed the Dos de Mayo. All that need concern us here is that the news that Ferdinand was to be removed from the throne by the French sparked off a series of conspiracies that led to insurrection. By the last week of May, indeed, almost every part of the country that was not physically occupied by the French had risen in revolt under the leadership of a variety of provincial juntas and petty military dictatorships. On the surface, it was a truly uplifting spectacle. Among the first British soldiers to observe the insurrection was a young Scottish gentleman of land-owning stock named Charles Leslie, who was an ensign in the Twenty-Ninth Foot and, as such, briefly visited the Andalusian town of Ayamonte when the brigade to which his regiment was attached stopped there en route for Portugal from Gibraltar in June 1808:\n\nBeing the first English who had landed in Spain since the breaking out of the Patriot cause, we were received with the most enthusiastic demonstrations of joy by the inhabitants. The governor invited all the officers to an entertainment in the evening, and had provided for us billets in all the best houses. The Spanish officers, both of the army and navy, almost crushed us in their fraternal embraces and insisted on carrying us from house to house, and introducing us to all the pretty ladies in the place. These dark beauties gave us the most cordial reception, and sang patriotic songs and warlike hymns, accompanied on the guitar or piano. Some of the naval officers who had been in England repeatedly sang ‘Rule Britannia’ and ‘God save the King!’ Their admiration of England’s prowess seemed unaffected. In many houses we observed busts of Mr Pitt … The governor’s supper went off with great harmony. Mutual toasts were given, and bumpers drunk to the perpetual harmony of the two nations.²²\n\nIn reality, however, the truth was far more murky. The fact that many of the civil and military authorities remained loyal to the instructions that had been issued both by Ferdinand VII and the council of regency which had been left behind in Madrid not to resist the French left them wide open to a purge that saw many of them murdered by mobs whipped up by ambitious rivals or subordinates, out for revenge or simply gripped by panic. Typical of the scenes that accompanied the killings were those witnessed in Ciudad Rodrigo:\n\nIt was three o’clock in the afternoon when an extraordinary commotion was suddenly noted in the streets. Large numbers of people having quickly gathered together, this soon became an outright tumult. Throwing aside the bounds of subordination and decorum, the crowds began to shout, ‘Death to the governor and the other traitors!’ Prepared for this eventuality, the junta asked the bishop … to send emissaries to persuade the rioters to desist from their atrocious project … but the confusion, the shouting and the sheer density of the crowd prevented their … counsel from being heard … All was in vain, and … by a little past four the governor, one of his adjutants, a French merchant and the postmaster were no more.²³\n\nStill more graphic is the account of Robert Brindle, who was trapped in his seminary at Valladolid:\n\nAt Valladolid the people seemed to set no bounds to their ardour … Arms were called for on every side, but [none] could be procured. The multitude, however, paraded the streets … with fowling pieces, pruning hooks and such other weapons as they could procure. From the numerous instances of treachery in those who had official situations the Spaniards suspected their best friends and truest patriots. The Captain General of the province during this time was General Cuesta. Though a true patriot and a skilful officer, yet it was impossible for him to restrain the populace from the most grievous outrages. Don Francisco Ceballos, governor of Segovia, having been obliged to evacuate that fortress, sought refuge in Valladolid. It since appears that [Segovia] was in the worst possible state of defence [and] that any resistance would only have occasioned … the destruction of the town … But no sooner had he entered Valladolid than the cry of traitor was raised against him and in a moment the poor man was literally torn to pieces. The Captain General was a spectator of this horrid spectacle, but so far from being able to restrain the violence of the mob [that] the cry was even raised against himself, and a gallows erected for his execution if arms did not arrive before the following day … The Captain General had exerted his authority to prevent the English students from being obliged to quit the house, but the mob declared they would burn the college to the ground if we did not join them. ²⁴\n\nBut the trouble was not just confined to the murder of supposed traitors. On the contrary, inflamed by long years of misery, the populace also engaged in overt acts of social protest, this tendency being further inflamed by the continuation of many of the same old faces in the new organs of local government. Tenant farmers protested against high rents; agricultural labourers tried to occupy the land or demanded higher wages; and there was a widespread refusal to pay the tithe. Examples of such unrest are frequent, but perhaps the most dramatic comes from Castellón de la Plana. Thus:\n\nOn 19 June [1808] … a gang of malcontents assembled … in the town, and ran through the streets, disturbing the public peace and shouting ‘Long live the King, the Fatherland and the Faith! Death to the traitors!’ Having murdered the governor, Colonel Don Pedro Lobo, and a landowner named Felix de Jiménez, they followed these execrable excesses with an attempt on the life of the commissary, Don José Ramón de Santi … In addition, the insurgents broke into the Capuchin nunnery, and freed all the prisoners in the public gaols by force.²⁵\n\nFor a general view of the chaos in one small part of Spain we can do no better than turn to José María Blanco y Crespo. Still at home in Madrid when the uprising broke out, he resolved to flee to Andalucía. It was, as he recalls, a journey characterised by the utmost discomfort:\n\nThere were no means of reaching Andalucía but through the province of Extremadura, and no other conveyance … than two Aragonese wagons, which, having stopped at a small inn, or venta, three miles from Madrid, were not under the immediate control of the French police … Summer is, of all seasons, the most inconvenient for travellers, and nothing but necessity will induce the natives to cross the burning plains in which the country abounds. This, however, is mostly done so as to avoid the fierceness of the sun, the coaches starting between three and four in the morning, stopping from nine till four in the afternoon, and completing the day’s journey between nine and ten in the evening. We, alas, could not expect that indulgence. Each of us, confined with our respective wagoner within the small space which the load had left near the awning, had to endure the intolerable closeness of the wagon under the dead stillness of a burning atmosphere so impregnated with floating dust as often to produce a feeling of suffocation. Our stages required not only early rising, but travelling till noon. After a disgusting dinner at the most miserable inns of the unfrequented road we were following, our task began again till night, when we could rarely expect the enjoyment even of such a bed as the Spanish ventas afford. Our stock of linen allowed us but one change, and we could not stop to have it washed. The consequences might easily be foreseen. The heat and the company of our wagoners, who often passed the night by our side, soon completed our wretchedness by giving us a sample of one, perhaps the worst, of the Egyptian plagues, which, as we had not yet got through one half of our journey, held out a sad increase till our arrival at Seville.²⁶\n\nDiscomfort was just the start of it, however. As Blanco and the other priest he was travelling with proceeded on their way, it became clear that they were in mortal peril:\n\nWe proceeded for two or three days, our feelings of security increasing all the while with the distance from Madrid. It was, however, just in that proportion that we were approaching danger. We had, about nine in the morning, reached the Calzada de Oropesa, on the borders of Extremadura, when we observed … a crowd of country people, who, collecting hastily round us, began to enquire who we were, accompanying their questions with the fierce and rude tone which forbodes mischief among the testy inhabitants of the southern provinces. The alcalde soon presented himself, and, repeating the account we gave of ourselves and our journey, wisely declared to the people that, our language being genuine Spanish, we might be allowed to proceed. He added, however, a word of advice, desiring us to be prepared to meet with people more inquisitive and suspicious than those of Oropesa … As if to try our veracity by means of intimidation, he acquainted us with the insurrections which had taken place in every town and village, and the victims which had scarcely failed in any instance to fall under the knives of the peasantry The truth … of this warning became more and more evident as we advanced through Extremadura. The notice we attracted at … every village, the threats of the labourers whom we met near the road and the accounts we heard at every inn fully convinced us that we could not reach our journey’s end without considerable danger.
