Much of chapter 5 was written while I was in residence at the Hambidge Center for Creative Arts and Sciences in Rabun Gap, Georgia. The quiet time there was invaluable for the development of that part of the book. Without this support, the multisite and multiyear research required for this book would have been impossible. I am grateful for the permissions granted by Sergio Langer and Marcel Velaochaga to publish their work in this book. Their art has helped me think through my own ideas. Having worked on this project for longer than I care to admit, I am indebted to many people, some of whom are mentioned here. The University of Florida provided an eclectic mix of faculty and graduate students who broadened my thinking in ways I only now realize. I cannot thank Brenda Chalfin and Florence Babb enough for their enduring enthusiasm for this project and for their encouragement. Glenn Willumson expanded my interest in photography and was a uniquely talented mentor and teacher whose courses and comments improved my thinking and my writing. Stacey Langwick’s course on the anthropology of science helped me reconsider my approach to history and anthropology. I am grateful to Michael Moseley for his insights into Peruvian archaeology and for his good humor. Mark Thurner carefully read early drafts of this work and pushed me to incorporate historical arguments and Peruvian historiography more deeply. Peer support has been vital to the completion of this book, and I wish I had recognized the importance of this earlier in my life. My cohort at the\n\nxii Acknowledgments\n\nUniversity of Florida offered friendship and opened my eyes to perspectives from Latin America that I hadn’t previously considered. Scott Catey read countless drafts of initial grant proposals as well as subsequent chapters; “Epistolary Science” owes much to his comments. Lauren Fordyce was a supportive listener who understood the challenges of pursuing an academic career. Finally, Juan Carlos Callirgos helped me navigate life in Peru both past and present. I am grateful for his dependable friendship, support, close readings, and chapter consultations. I cannot thank him enough. Although my training is primarily in cultural anthropology, the research for this book is historical. In the United States, I reviewed all the archival material held in the Yale Peruvian Expedition Papers and the Bingham Family Papers in Yale University’s Sterling Library’s Manuscripts and Archives. The research assistants were extraordinarily helpful and informative, even mailing me materials when I was no longer on campus. I examined US State Department correspondence at the National Archives, and archival materials and photographic albums at the National Geographic Society. Renee Braden at the National Geographic Society was a true gem. After many, many years of trying to view the photo albums of Hiram Bingham’s expeditions, she finally made it happen. I am so thankful that she took time out of her extraordinarily busy schedule to facilitate the visit. In Lima, Peru, I worked in a number of public archives, including the Museo Nacional de Arqueología, Antropología e Historia del Perú; the Archivo General de la Nación; the archive at the Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores del Perú; and the Instituto Riva-­Agüero, which holds a repository of newspapers and illustrated magazines from the early 1900s as well as the papers of Albert Giesecke, Mejía Xesspe, and the Zapata/Arias-­ Schreiber collection of articles on the defense of monument patrimony. At the former Instituto Nacional de Cultura, I examined the papers of Luis Eduardo Valcárcel. I also visited the collections at Lima’s Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú and the National Library, which has holdings of newspaper runs and illustrated magazines such as Actualidades, Variedades, Prisma, El Perú Ilustrado, and El Correo de Peru. I am humbled by the trust and goodwill the librarians and archivists showed me. In Cuzco, Peru, I examined the regional archive and library, along with the photographic archive, Fototeca Andina, at the Centro de Estudios Bartolomé de las Casas. There, the librarians helped clarify some of the factual errors on the photographs held in the archive, making sure I wasn’t led astray. I visited other archives, such as the Sociedad Geográfica\n\nAcknowledgments xiii\n\nof Lima, where I found no documents, but whose historic location was evocative of the faded elegance of a bygone era. I also visited personal archives and met with people such as Luis Figueroa Yábar, the well-­known filmmaker of the Cuzco school and son of the artist and photographer Juan Manuel Figueroa Aznar, who shared his documents, photographs, and memories with me. The Latin American Collection at the University of Florida was an incredible resource that I often took for granted. The Frost Library at Amherst College has been a superior example of what can happen with care, interest, and resources at a university library. They were and are amazing. I am fortunate to have supportive and kind colleagues in the Department of Anthropology and Sociology at Amherst College. Deborah Gewertz, Chris Dole, Vanessa Fong, Nusrat Chowdhury, Jerry Himmelstein, Ron Lembo, Leah Schmalzbauer, and Hannah Holleman welcomed me and gave me thoughtful guidance and support. I am especially grateful to Deborah and Leah for their encouragement and their advice on publishing. I also thank Austin Sarat for making me feel like I belonged at a place like Amherst and for approving last-­minute research and travel money. My students at Amherst College and UNC-­Charlotte helped me become a better teacher and, in the process, a better scholar and writer. In Peru, countless people assisted me with archives and bureaucracies, and also with life. I am grateful to them all. In particular, Mariana Mould de Pease welcomed me into her home and shared her ideas, papers, and perspectives. She is a treasure. Jorge Flores Ochoa offered his time and his insights with me over many years. Leylys Gutierrez invited me into COLITUR and encouraged tour guides to speak to me about their experiences at Machu Picchu. This part of the research was a welcome relief from the chill of reading rooms. I also owe special thanks to the beautiful Castellanos family for inviting me to be a part of their family. Diana Castellanos’s friendship continues to be a source of great joy and support for me. Reviews by Christopher Heaney and Walter Little helped clarify and deepen the argument of this book. I am grateful for the time and care they showed in their reviews and for their enriching suggestions, all of which have improved the book. Kerry Webb was a thoughtful and diligent editor who guided the book seamlessly through the process from review to publication. I appreciate immensely how she believed in this project. Kip Keller was an extraordinary copy editor. I am in awe of his skill. Finally I would like to thank my family. My mom, while not understanding the purpose of my chosen profession, was supportive nonethe-\n\nxiv Acknowledgments\n\nless. My father read drafts of my research and has always encouraged me to keep writing. I wrote my dissertation while pregnant with my first daughter and began teaching while pregnant with my second. In retrospect, I have no idea how that was possible, but it must have had something to do with the sweet love, admiration, and excitement they showed me. They are joys that continue to give me sense and a place in the world. The book is dedicated to Kirk, my spouse. I have no idea how you continued to be supportive. Thank you for extending such grace.\n\nA Note on the Text\n\nTechnically, the 1911 expedition was the only one officially called the Yale Peruvian Expedition. Subsequent expeditions were called the 1912, and then the 1914–1915, Peruvian Expedition under the Auspices of Yale University and National Geographic Society. Gilbert Grosvenor, the director of the society and editor of National Geographic Magazine, often mentioned to Bingham that when the expeditions were discussed publicly, the society felt that it did not get the credit it deserved. I have nonetheless chosen to refer to all three expeditions as Yale Peruvian Expeditions for simplicity’s sake and because this is how they are typically known.\n\nFigure 1.1. Ayer y Hoy, Sergio Langer, 2008. This image is taken from the Sunday magazine\n\ninsert Somos in El Comercio, the largest daily newspaper in Lima, Peru. The cartoon, a comment on conquest, appeared in 2008. The cartoonist satirizes tourists laden with cameras, provoking us to think critically about the practice of tourism. I also read it through the lens of this book, somewhat literally, thinking that the cartoonist might be suggesting, as I do, that photography is a tool of conquest and is as potent as a rifle— perhaps more so because the shots keep getting fired, the bullets never ceasing to circulate.

The stone is as fine as any in Cuzco! It is unknown and will make a fine story. Hiram Bingham to his wife, July 26, 1911\n\nNearly twenty years ago I first visited Machu Picchu as a backpacker hiking the Inca Trail. I arrived in Cuzco, looked around, talked to a tour agency, negotiated the price, booked my trip, and left the next day with a hodgepodge of tourists from the UK, Australia, and the United States. On the day we made the arduous climb to Huarmiwañusqa (Dead Woman’s Pass, 13,770 feet), the porters carried tourists’ belongings stacked five feet high across their backs. I marveled at their strength and agility as they ran up the mountain in rubber sandals, but I lamented the obvious inequality. Having insisted on carrying my backpack, I arrived at the top proud of my accomplishment, but sensed that the situation was less clear, since the porters seemed disappointed at not being paid to carry my pack. After three days of hiking, we arrived to Machu Picchu, where a new guide told us, in incomprehensible English, about the area. I walked up Huayna Picchu, taking in the breathtaking views from the jutting spire of this young mountain and admiring the elegance of a perfectly placed hamlet. Today this scenario is less likely to occur. Tourists must schedule their adventure, booking the trip to Machu Picchu months in advance. Hiking the trail is regulated by Peru’s Ministry of Culture, and camping sites are limited to those overseen by a few approved tour operators. Tourists can no longer decide spontaneously to hike up Huayna Picchu, but instead need to make a reservation and pay a separate entry fee. Prices have skyrocketed.\n\n2 Framing a Lost City\n\nIn 1983, Machu Picchu was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site. In 2007, the site was deemed a wonder of the modern world. Over a million tourists visited Machu Picchu in 2014.1 In 2015, a round-­t rip tourist ticket on the train from Cuzco to Aguas Calientes cost $90–­$398. The entrance fee for the park, including a visit to Huayna Picchu and the Temple of the Moon, which were previously included in the entry fee, was 152 Peruvian soles, or approximately $47, for non-­Peruvian adults. To visit only Machu Picchu cost 128 Peruvian soles, or $40. Peruvians continue to be able to visit Machu Picchu on Sunday for free, but even with the reduced admission, the cost of a visit is out of reach for most Peruvians. Both a source of foreign capital and the linchpin to a national identity that unites people into the imagined collective called “Peruvian,” Machu Picchu has become a logo as powerful as Nike’s swoosh. Scholars believe that Machu Picchu was a royal estate or retreat for the Inca Pachacuti, the ninth Sapa Inca, who ruled from 1438 to 1471. At the time of his death, the Incan Empire was at its apogee, stretching from northern Ecuador to Chile, including what is today Peru, Bolivia, and northern Argentina. After the Spanish conquered the Inca, Machu Picchu retreated from view. It wasn’t until 1911, when Hiram Bingham, a historian at Yale University, took its picture, that Machu Picchu began its path to celebrity. A photograph first made Machu Picchu famous, helping transform the place into a lost city discovered, an Andean utopia found. The place has not been the same since. This book is about seeing. More specifically, it is about Hiram Bingham’s three expeditions to Peru, which took place from 1911 to 1916, and the role of visualizing technologies in fashioning knowledge about nations, peoples, and the past as national patrimony.2 If nothing else, Hiram Bingham and the Yale Peruvian Expeditions (1911, 1912, 1914–1915) represented Machu Picchu and Peru to the world. They made maps, displayed antiquities, took pictures, wrote books and articles, and gave illustrated lectures. Their words and images framed a place from a specific vantage, one that placed it in a dominant domain of visibility.3 Discovery narratives, which often focus on Bingham’s heroism or antiheroism, tend to eclipse this fact. And yet, what we know about Machu Picchu, the most iconic example of Peruvian heritage, derives from, or is couched in terms set by, the Yale Peruvian Expeditions’ imagining and framing of that specific geographic site. It seems that Machu Picchu does not speak without speaking to Yale first.4 This book examines what Hiram Bingham chose to observe and how he observed it, to explicate the ways in which Machu Picchu was made,\n\nIntroduction 3\n\nnot only by the Incas, but also by expeditionary science in the first part of the twentieth century. In 1978, Edward Said published Orientalism. The text marked a turning point in scholarship about the ways in which the Other has been seen and represented and how power is imbricated and circulated through seemingly innocuous fields.5 Since the book’s publication, paintings, photographs, novels, museums, art, and travel writing have all been examined for the ways in which peoples and nations have been fashioned, invented, and negotiated by outsiders.6 Over the last two decades, work in science and technology studies (STS) has focused on the processes by which representational fields ground authoritative and universal knowledge.7 No longer viewed as a direct reflection of nature, the pursuit of scientific knowledge with technological instruments has instead been shown to be constitutive of it.8 Images are key actors not only in the formation of individual and group identities but also in the production of scientific knowledge.9 More than an exegesis on stereotypes, this body of scholarship is an examination of how seeing and representation by certain situated subjects craft powerful narratives that calcify into facts and knowledge, subjugating the Other into authoritative structures of visibility. Ways of seeing fashion truth. If science is a term that describes the acquisition of knowledge about the physical and natural world through observation, then engaging those practices of observation is critical for furthering our understanding of the construction, veracity, and historicity of knowledge. As Lorraine Daston and Elizabeth Lunbeck point out, “Observation educates the senses, calibrates judgment, picks out objects of scientific inquiry and forges ‘thought collectives.’”10 This book examines the scientific and expeditionary practices and technologies that constituted such observations, and thus how publics came to understand Machu Picchu as a discovered lost city.11 In so doing, this book parses the composition of Machu Picchu vis-­à-­v is the entanglements of science, instruments of knowledge, and racialized discourses about Peruvian histories and peoples, which ultimately transformed the site into a lost city and national patrimony.12\n\nSTS and Expeditionary Science At first, Hiram Bingham and the Yale Peruvian Expeditions seemed unlikely candidates for the inflection and reliance on research produced under the rubric of science and technology studies. Although Bingham\n\n4 Framing a Lost City\n\nwas an explorer and considered himself and the expeditions to Peru to be scientific, STS in academia has tended to focus on either science produced before the twentieth century or scientific technology such as medical imaging devices, computers, and superconductors.13 Physics and biomedicine, particularly the study of the body and work in clinical settings, have been privileged over expeditionary science in science studies scholarship.14 Furthermore, trying to link STS to explorers has proved confusing and at times counterintuitive. From a popular standpoint, science and scientists conjure an image of white coats, glass beakers, pharmaceuticals, and computers. Drawing on science studies to examine expeditionary practices made sense to me but seemed to be contradicted by the very label itself. Bingham’s expedition and his findings did not seem scientific enough. While Bingham felt that he produced scientific findings through mapmaking, geographic work, and osteology, these did not come to the forefront as the primary or important outcomes of the expeditions. No inventions, laboratories, or devices arose from the three Yale expeditions to Peru. Moreover, archaeology, which one might assume was the main scientific practice used in uncovering Machu Picchu and learning about its past, was not conducted on the three tours. None of the members of the three expeditions to Peru were thoroughly trained in archaeology. Bingham was trained in history, and his teams typically consisted of a geographer, an osteologist, a naturalist, and a topographer as well as several young assistants. Although the expeditions’ topographic maps continue to be used by explorers today and Bingham is credited with locating Vitcos, where Manco Inca ruled until he was assassinated by the Spanish, Bingham’s legacy does not readily read as scientific.15 A possible reason for this is that during the time of Bingham’s expeditions, science was less specialized than it is today. Educated people dabbled in science. Illustrated lectures by explorers, including Bingham, or nonprofessional scientists were common.16 For example, Bingham was a member of the Cosmos Club, an all-­male society whose members needed either to have done “meritorious work in science, literature or the fine arts” or simply to be cultivated in those fields.17 The pursuit of science for the expeditionary teams was science-­cum-­history-­cum-­adventure-­cum-­ industry. The blurring of these pursuits demonstrates the anachronism of these labels in the early twentieth century when the romantic-­scientific aura of the explorer established in the nineteenth century was still very much alive. This is not to say that science did not play a significant role in the facilitating, legitimizing, and carrying out of the expedition. Without\n\nIntroduction 5\n\nthe sheen and the technologies of the scientific expedition, the Yale cohort would have produced a rather different legacy. Indeed, it was precisely the frame of science that guaranteed Bingham and the expeditions’ long cultural legacy in Peru and the world at large. Trained as a historian, Bingham might be best characterized as an explorer and collector with a scientific purpose.18 As the first professor of South American history at Yale, he sought to develop exciting and relevant questions that built on previous scholarship. He then methodically attempted to answer those questions, hoping to contribute to something beyond individual experience, enriching civilization’s knowledge. The expeditions expanded on previous, long-­standing expeditionary pursuits such as cataloguing, naming, and collecting, but also subtly shifted what came to constitute science. Bingham’s two most prolific scientific practices on his 1911 expedition were mapmaking and photography. Both were continued on subsequent trips. Collecting remains figured extensively on the second and third expeditions, and that practice has left a lasting impression on both the politics of the expedition and Bingham’s reputation. Initially, however, the majority of expeditionary practice in 1911 was executed through measuring and making pictures. Photographic technology and the reproduction of images played a significant role in the formation of Machu Picchu, helping standardize views based on select criteria, ultimately marking locations, people, and things as lost then found. In 1911, Peru was compared with other nations, and found wanting. Racial and moral categories were used to rank nations on scales of industrialization and civilization. Ricardo Salvatore suggests that during this period, “South America became a ‘continent of opportunity’ and also a land of ‘lost cities’ and ‘ancient glories,’ a contradictory synthesis of future market opportunities and current backwardness.”19 Peru’s desire for parity in the community of nations was part of the zeitgeist in which nations strove to become modern, and for many elite Peruvians, Bingham’s expeditions were considered a way to fashion a nation out of colonial ruins.20 Transnational infrastructures, scientific pursuits, and national images all worked to constitute a discursive complex that was characterized as modern: a mental outlook accompanied by a specific institutional order.21 That order informed the three expeditions and shaped how choices were made, and actions defined, to translate a place into a scientific discovery of a lost city of global import. Science, however, was not only an attitude and outlook of modernity, but also one whose instruments and inscriptions shaped the political space\n\n6 Framing a Lost City\n\nas much as it did its subjects. Modernity referred not only to the economic structures of life,22 but also to its mechanical forms of reproduction, which began in Peru in the late 1800s and came into sharp relief around the time of Bingham’s expedition.23 Indeed, it was through photography that Machu Picchu became “known to the world.”24 Thousands of photographs were taken over the course of the three expeditions, five hundred of Machu Picchu alone.25 The act of taking photographs, along with the selection, circulation, and manipulation of images and diagrams to global and national publics, uniquely shaped Machu Picchu into an internationally recognized site and a Peruvian national icon. Although local understandings of the area now known as Machu Picchu existed before Bingham’s expeditions, global and national meanings of Machu Picchu continue to be traced to the ways in which the site was imagined and packaged in the early 1900s. Thinking about the Yale expeditions to Machu Picchu offers an opportunity to examine not simply its own making but also the story of Peru in the twentieth century and how it is inextricably bound up in a tale of global proportions. The abandoned archaeological site stands at the center of Peru’s colonial past and its postcolonial future, speaking volumes about modernization, development, race, indigeneity, long histories of scientific expeditions, photography, US-­Peruvian relations, tourism, and national identity. Through an examination of seeing and visibility as they relate to Machu Picchu, this book aims to contribute insights to broader questions about the coupling of science and modernity and the forces of nation making in the twentieth century. Pictures do not simply represent people or objects, but want something and act on the viewer.26 The following chapters closely examine the ways in which visualizing technologies were used to set the Andean landscape into a specific, particularly modern formation.\n\nVision and Scientific Expeditions in South America Many scholars have examined how science as a global discourse, metonym of empire, and powerful practice circulated in the New World in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.27 Charles de La Condamine’s expedition in 1735 to South America sought to catalogue and categorize resources. This mission, coupled with the publication of Carolus Linnaeus’s The System of Nature (1735), led to global-­scale meaning being constructed through the descriptive apparatuses of natural history.28 Collections for\n\nIntroduction 7\n\nEuropean botanical gardens and natural history museums served as objects of scientific inquiry and as evidence of conquered geography.29 In contrast to La Condamine’s texts, which categorized the Americas as accessible, recognizable, and collectible, Alexander von Humboldt’s accounts of his expeditions presented South America as an overwhelming spectacle of nature awaiting conquering.30 Humboldt was not interested in filling taxonomic gaps, but sought encompassing laws of nature within apparent chaos and an uncertain future.31 He measured, collected, and illustrated. He brought instruments (forty-­t wo on his trip to Venezuela) and paper, scales, tools, and vials for storing seeds.32 He returned with sixty thousand specimens, and his drawings changed the way people saw the Americas.33 The images were an aesthetic achievement, rich in color and detail, but also a scientific one, since they allowed others to witness the marvels of Latin America without ever leaving Europe.34 By the mid-­nineteenth century, scientific exploration in South America began to include research in ethnography, which broadly included collecting antiquities, excavating for remains, and conducting works in anthropometry and physiognomic typing.35 Fresh methods and perspectives bolstered knowledge of a “new” America through graphics and illustrations.36 Works such as Antigüedades Peruanas, by Mariano Eduardo de Rivero and Johann Jakob von Tschudi (1851), exemplified a Humboldtian tradition of seeing the landscape directly, even if it was through the eyes and representations of the explorer.37 British and Anglo-­American explorers followed in the footsteps of their French and Spanish predecessors in exploring the Peruvian interior, too.38 Sir Clements Markham’s 1852 voyage to Cuzco and subsequent book, Travels in Peru and India (1862), and Ephraim George Squier’s US-­ government-­sponsored Peruvian expedition and resulting Peru: Incidents of Travel and Exploration in the Land of the Incas (1877), were landmarks in a burgeoning literature. Bingham’s South American expeditions (1906– 1907, 1908–1909, 1911, 1912, 1914–1915) were rooted in this trajectory.39 Squier, in particular, marked a turning point for modern Andean studies.40 Like other nineteenth-­century explorers of South America, he had a philosophy of vision that was statistical and quantitative. Science involved the display of items such as skulls or potsherds as “populations” whose patterns could be measured, and meanings generalized.41 To meet the demands of modern science, Squier brought along a compass, measuring line, pencil, and camera.42 Photography was central to his science, and his writings were an extended travel narrative with mapping and images.43 Although Bingham’s interest in Peru drew on Squier’s research and\n\n8 Framing a Lost City\n\nwas piqued by Adolph Bandelier’s The Islands of Titicaca and Koati (1910), his research agenda was influenced most by Clements Markham. Markham wrote several books that shaped Bingham’s conception of Peru, including Cuzco: A Journey to the Ancient Capital of Peru (1856),44 Travels in Peru and India (1862), A History of Peru (1892), and The Incas of Peru (1910). Although Markham’s scholarly aim was to learn about the Incas and their origins,45 his travelogues are a mix of adventure, historicity, and industry consulting. In A History of Peru, Markham’s narrative begins with the era of the Incas and ends with an analysis of the republic. Concluding his book are four chapters on Peru’s situation at the time: “People of Peru,” “The Literature of Peru,” “The Trade of Peru,” and “The Wealth of Peru.” In these chapters, Markham describes the promise of Peru as a nation, outlining the problems and possibilities for Peru’s future industrial development. Like Peru’s early geographers, who saw their discipline as an opportunity to exploit natural resources for development,46 Markham saw Peru’s potential, particularly when it came to its diverse climate and abundant resources.47 Specifically, Markham envisaged Peru’s development into a modern nation as coming from the benefits of international commerce with Britain, which dominated South America’s interior trade at the time.48 Markham concluded, “It may, therefore, be accepted when the means of traffic, in the Peruvian Montana, is fully developed, and steamers are running on all the navigable rivers, that a very extensive and lucrative trade in India rubber will be developed and maintained.”49 He called for new trade routes connecting Cuzco to Brazil, as well as for the building of infrastructure to harness Peru’s enormous wealth in natural resources. Markham’s books are replete with admiration for Peru’s distant past as well as hope for its promising future. In A History of Peru, Markham commended the country on its blessed nature and representation of “every clime.” He concluded the book by writing that if Peru’s two great needs, immigration and peace, were met, “there may still be a bright future in store for the long suffering children of the sun.”50 At that time, scientific exploration in Peru focused on “ancient civilizations” and human antiquity.51 Explorers, influenced by the publication of Charles Darwin’s On the Origin of the Species (1859), had become generally interested in questions about deep history, human origins, speciation, and the peopling of South America.52 Study of present-­day Andean populations had not achieved the same status as the investigation of antiquities. This disparity was due in part to the continued conceptualization of Peru’s indigenous populations as “epigones incapable of contributing to\n\nIntroduction 9\n\nthe understanding of Inca greatness.”53 Instead, explorers such as Squier and Markham examined the Peruvian nation’s imagined past civilizations through the glorified lens of the Inca “race.” Representations such as Squier’s photographs and drawings of the Tiwanaku ruins materialized and naturalized this historical schism through further temporal distancing.54 Objects became monumentalized and thereby underwrote Peru’s bifurcated national history. Peru’s dead golden age ultimately became its future through a dismissal and obscuring of the present. In fashioning a modern Peru out of its Incan past, the process of nation building constructed and shaped a national identity.55 Such an emphasis on antiquity and the privileging of the Inca reiterated the Spanish-­ Creole schema of Peru’s glorious native past versus its miserable Indian present. This bias was directed at Peru by Peruvian antiquarians as well as foreigners. Spurred by a global interest in classical Roman antiquities, Lima’s Geographical Society and the Cuzco Science Center were formed by Peruvians to study Peru’s so-­called ancient past.56 Collecting brought prestige, taste, and class to the collector, but also continued to produce living Quechua speakers as relics, downfallen antiquities themselves.57 The collecting of Incan symbols was as much cosmopolitan as it was patriotic but remained deeply racialized and bifurcated, even within Peru by Peruvian collectors.58 Bingham saw South America’s present condition as problematic and thought that science was an avenue to improve conditions. In 1906, he was working on a history of the South American wars of independence and on biographies of José de San Martín and Simón Bolívar. Because of a lack of trustworthy sources, Bingham found the project unsustainable and shifted his goal. He became interested in the battles that Bolívar fought at Carabobo (in present-­day Venezuela) and Boyacá (in present-­day Colombia). Since descriptions of the battles were “very meager,” he sought to experience the place for himself, studying the country where Bolívar lived and fought, visiting the most important scenes of the battles, and exploring the route of “his most celebrated campaign.”59 In retracing the marches and battle scenes, Bingham hoped to ascertain the obstacles overcome by the liberating army and to contribute to knowledge about Bolívar and the conditions within which these two famed battles were fought. Rather than a mere traveler’s tale, his “scientific work” would offer some “observations of use in geography and ethnology.”60 Dr. Hamilton Rice, who had previously explored from Quito to Pará by way of the Napo and Amazon Rivers, was a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society. He accompanied\n\n10 Framing a Lost City\n\nBingham, often being called into service to remedy local medical maladies and perform surgeries. The two-­person team took along books, maps, tents, surgical equipment, surveying instruments, and guns, all of which passed freely through customs without examination. Bingham’s account of the trip, The Journal of an Expedition Across Venezuela and Colombia, 1906–1907: An Exploration of the Route of Bolívar’s Celebrated March of 1819 and of the Battle-­Fields of Boyacá and Carabobo (1909), reads as a coming-­of-­age memoir and is replete with Bingham’s musings and inner thoughts. In the text, Bingham is the master of all that he sees, acting as the anointed translator and knowledge broker for future travelers through his many scene settings: descriptions of buildings, paintings, landscapes, and even a bit of curiosity directed at the natural world.61 Photographs of buildings, landscapes, and people, for the most part unidentified, are interspersed throughout the text to act as evidentiary proof to the written word.62 The images visualize his movement through the landscape, marking rivers, plazas, mountains, and the people he encounters. His observations about the moral character of people are rooted in the racial categories of the time and supplemented with photographs of nameless types such as “a Yaruro Chief.”63 Although there are humorous parts in the book, such as an incident of the team being swindled,64 the book does not shed light on Bolívar or the battles. Instead, it is about Bingham and one Anglo-­Saxon’s (his term) observations about reasons for the backwardness of the countries and the lack of foreign capitalist investment.65 Following that experience, he attended the First Pan-­American Scientific Congress, held in Santiago, Chile, in December 1908.66 He first sailed to Rio de Janeiro and made his way to Argentina in order to explore the historic trade route between Buenos Aires, Potosí, and Lima. He went overland into Cuzco, Peru. This exploration was recounted in Across South America: An Account of a Journey from Buenos Aires to Lima by Way of Potosí (1911). Like Journal of an Expedition, Across South America begins with descriptions of buildings, roads, racial types, architecture, and commerce. The text includes further conjecture about the economic development of Peru and South America generally, advancing his perspective on the importance of investment in ports, railroads, and transportation for national economic growth. He speculates about the reasons, including climate and “race history,” for the lack of unification of the governments and nations of South America.67 Bingham writes: “Like my journey across Venezuela and Colombia this [trip] taught me to feel anew the stupendous difficulties\n\nIntroduction 11\n\nthat lie in the way of advancing South American civilization.”68 He concludes with an appraisal of South American traits and behaviors, including manners, styles of speech, and lack of honesty, suggesting that while South America inherited “racial antipathies” and was not yet as civilized as the United States or Europe, it was improving. Citing the fact that the South American countries received their independence nearly fifty years after the United States did, Bingham’s narrative situates South America within an evolutionary and industrialist paradigm with the United States as the apex of modernity. He concludes by noting that an honest appraisal of South America (such as his) was necessary to build confidence and, therefore, trade relations: “There is not the slightest question that there is a great opportunity awaiting the American manufacturer and exporter when he is willing to grasp it with intelligent persistence and determination. South America is ready to take American goods in very large quantities as soon as we are ready to take time to give attention to her needs.”69 By the time of Bingham’s arrival in Peru in 1911, South America had become a field of interest for diplomatic policy and for US business interests.70 Foreign capital was used to purchase land, mineral concessions, and exportation rights in Peru. Peru’s economic policy became increasingly aligned with external capital interests, and exploration by foreigners was welcomed.71 Like Squier and Markham, Bingham saw Peru as a nation offering historical insight and economic potential if the present could be overcome. Grounded in the historical schism between Peru’s perceived glorious Incan past and its miserable native present, Bingham’s expeditionary practices produced materials that circulated with various ends, including civilizing in the name of industry and modernity.72 Bingham entered a Peru that was deeply divided and unequal, politically and economically.73 A small segment of society held most of the property as the hacienda system, already in place in the late nineteenth century, expanded.74 The economy relied on exports and foreign capital for investment and development, which led to further monopolies in agriculture, mining, and wool production.75 Such consolidation meant a crisis for common property in rural communities as communal lands and smallholdings were squeezed.76 Cuzco at the time was a city “dominated by a minority composed of a few hundred large and medium sized landowning families, a handful of bourgeoisie with a mentality of industrialization and a circle of foreign or Arequipeña merchants that easily exploited the needs of all.”77 The middle class hardly existed, and the remainder of the population lived in the countryside. To survive and grow, haciendas relied on exploitative labor practices\n\n12 Framing a Lost City\n\nthat were deeply racialized. Indeed, without the labor available from indigenous communities, the haciendas would not have existed.78 Many used enganche, a legal system of labor recruitment wherein laborers were coerced through advance payment to work for a set amount of time.79 Such a system, which preyed on the most marginalized, was replicated in abusive hierarchical labor arrangements.80 Others in the highlands relied on “free labor” wherein people worked on a hacienda in exchange for being allowed to pasture their animals or produce their own crops on the land.81 Haciendas on the coast also relied on sharecropping ( yanaconaje) performed by workers from the Andes, often without contracts or specified arrangements.82 Moreover, Lima elites relied on an Andean gamonal system, wherein local political bosses could rule as they pleased in exchange for their support of the national government.83 However, gamonales were creative in their appropriation of national political discourse, often using it to reinforce their own power.84 Characterized by dislocated peasants, migrant workers, and corporate elites, the system was paternalistic, coercive, and violent.85 In April 1911, a few months before Bingham’s arrival in Peru, a general strike, the first in Peru’s history, was held to protest such abusive labor practices. Bingham’s expeditions to Colombia and Venezuela, and his trip from Buenos Aires to Lima, framed South America as a repository for potential scientific and historic discoveries. Yet underscoring the interest in scientific work was a civilizing narrative. Drawing on early twentieth-­ century racial paradigms, Bingham made observations and drew conclusions about the economic and political trajectories of South American nations.86 Bingham’s efforts were multidirectional: his expeditionary science sought to foster and expand US business interests, contribute to scientific knowledge, and make a name for himself. For the three Yale Peruvian Expeditions, he continued along this trajectory, traveling roads built to facilitate trade from the area’s haciendas,87 and relying on a labor pool coerced by local elites who believed in the promise of science to spur national development. Eventually, Machu Picchu, the discovered lost city, became a marvelous possession in its own right, even though it was never really lost and wasn’t a city.88\n\nThe 1911 Yale Peruvian Expedition In Across South America, Bingham wrote about his visit to the ruins of Choqquequirau and reviewed some of the reasons why it was referred to\n\nIntroduction 13\n\nas the “Cradle of Gold.”89 Bingham concluded that Choqquequirau was not a “Cradle of Gold” or “a temple or a treasure house.” Rather, it was, he suggested, originally a fortress defending the valley of the Apurímac, a place where life was strenuous.90 The sighting of Choqquequirau, however, fostered his interest in further exploration: “The interesting question remains: Was this the ultimate refuge of the last Inca”?91 Manco Capac, the last Incan ruler, took refuge from the Spanish conquerors in a place referred to as Vilcabamba. Based on the writings of Father Antonio de la Calancha92 and the early geographers Antonio Raimondi and Mariano Paz Soldan, many believed that the legendary refuge of Vilcabamba was Choqquequirau. Bingham was doubtful. He concluded the chapter on Choqquequirau in Across South America by noting that although Raimondi might be correct, he would need additional proof: “Until some one shall have explored the present village of Vilcabamba and its vicinity, I am inclined to the opinion that Choqquequirau was merely a fortress.”93 Returning to explore the area became one of the rationales for the 1911 expedition. More importantly, however, this trip provided experience, know-­how, and connections for the future 1911 expedition. At Choqquequirau, Bingham uncovered caves with large rocks blocking their entrances. In them he examined decaying bones, a practice that was performed extensively on the three subsequent Yale expeditions.94 A military accompaniment and letters of introduction smoothed his movement through the country. Being seen as a scientist won him support from industry and government, including free transport on the railroad and free entry at customs. As Bingham described the Pan-­American Congress in Across South America, the meeting was less about the content of science than the opportunity for socializing. On Bingham’s 1909 trip to Peru, he also met men who would assist him in the future. Juan José Nuñez Valdivia, who eventually became the prefect in Cuzco, encouraged Bingham to visit Choqquequirau and then accompanied him on the trip.95 Later, Bingham gave him a plaque thanking him for all his help on the expeditions.96 Bingham also met Cesar Lomellini, an Italian merchant who resided in Cuzco, on this trip. Lomellini later provided Bingham with needed supplies and information. He visited Lima’s Geographical Society for maps and met the Peruvian president, Augusto Leguía. The Peruvian historian and archivist Carlos Romero, spurred by the presence of Bingham at Choqquequirau, wrote his own report of the ruins, which detailed that the lost city was in the valley of the Urubamba, not the Apurímac.97 This report would eventually find its way to Bingham.\n\n14 Framing a Lost City\n\nThus, the proposal for Bingham’s 1911 Yale Peruvian Expedition was rooted in a long history of scientific exploration of South America, the knowledge and contacts he acquired during his initial South American experiences, and an outlook that framed Peru as a nation in need. The 1911 expedition sought to map a cross-­section of a large portion of the Andes to ascertain how deep into the jungle the Incas had carried their civilization. The team would also make maps, climb and measure the height of Mount Coropuna, and study the depth of Lake Parinacochas.98 Members of subsequent expeditions would continue to survey the area and make maps, scout and excavate ruins, measure and photograph Peru’s Quechua-­ speaking population, work with the Bureau of Plant Industry of the US Department of Agriculture to study agricultural systems and crops, and collect specimens of birds, fish, and skeletal remains. The expansiveness of the 1911 expedition and its interdisciplinarity were thought worthwhile, since the branches of science represented might intersect and help one another.99 Ultimately, the search for the lost city of the last Incan capital had a magnetic effect, uniting publics for support in both Peru and the United States while underscoring Peru’s potential. The 1911 expedition was made possible by Bingham’s family money, Yale University’s granting of academic leave, volunteers, and corporate sponsorship; subsequent expeditions were financed primarily by the National Geographic Society, Yale, and Bingham. Peruvian actors and transnational elites, however, should not be discounted. The government granted Bingham free entry for all expedition goods, a military accompaniment, permission to excavate, and free shipment of all materials within the country. In addition, Bingham consulted with local elites about the whereabouts of ruins, and stayed at local haciendas during the expeditions. Although Bingham’s ability to ship materials out of Peru was constrained on subsequent expeditions, he was allowed access and entry to the Andean countryside during each visit. He relied on local labor, incentivized through monetary compensation or threats, to help excavate and clear sites. The science of the expeditions united a wide array of actors and was international in scope. Alberto Flores Galindo suggests that the idealized depiction of a pre-­ Hispanic past, referred to as an Andean utopia, has acted as the organizing principle and discursive frame for a variety of national projects in Peru.100 This view of the Incan past, emerging after the sixteenth century, was memorialized as an era free from disorder, hunger, and exploitation. It was a time when ancient Peruvians, imagined through their Incan ancestors, ruled.101 The search for remains of the Incan past motivated Bingham,\n\nIntroduction 15\n\nYale, and National Geographic, but also Peruvian intellectuals and elites as they sought not only to understand the past and provide an alternative to the present, but also to invent and discern a national future.102 The first Yale Peruvian Expedition lasted from late June through December 1911. On May 25, an advance party set sail with the equipment. Bingham and the rest of the party left on June 8. On June 24, Bingham climbed two thousand feet to Machu Picchu, accompanied by Melchor Arteaga and Sergeant Carrasco, the team’s military escort.103 A son of a farmer who made his home at Machu Picchu then accompanied Bingham to the ruins. Bingham spent a few hours at the site.104 Once back in the United States, Bingham made plans to return to Peru. He set sail on May 18, 1912, to conduct further work in and around Machu Picchu. He remained in Peru until late November. The final expedition began in the spring of 1914 and lasted through 1915. The first expedition was primarily taken up with survey work, mapping, and mountain climbing. The second expedition, which was quickly organized following the success of the first, centered on the excavation and mapping of Machu Picchu and its environs. The third expedition included further survey work, additional mapping of the area, and the collection of a large number of specimens. The third expedition also included more cultural work, which was primarily conducted by Bingham’s assistant, Osgood Hardy. Hardy’s tasks included learning Quechua and studying indigenous feasts and beliefs. Physicians on the last two expeditions took anthropometric measurements and photographs of the local population, and conducted health investigations. After seeing Machu Picchu in 1911, Bingham initially surmised that it could be the “cradle of Inca civilization.” Taking his cue from Markham, Bingham had set out to find the post-­Conquest refuge known as Vilcabamba, the lost city of the Incas. Nonetheless, the supposed presence of “three windows” at Machu Picchu (the actual location of the three windows of the Inca origin story was later identified to be in nearby Ollantaytambo) led Bingham to speculate that he had discovered the birthplace of the Incan Empire. In his initial article for Harper’s Magazine, Bingham wrote: “In the mean time it seems probable that Machu Picchu, discovered while on a search for the last Inca capital, was the first, the capital from which the Incas started on that glorious career of empire that eventually embraced a large part of South America.”105 This initial, “first and last” narrative of Machu Picchu responded to the long-­standing scientific search for the Incas’ origins and the romantic narrative of their heroic fall to the Spaniards.\n\n16 Framing a Lost City\n\nScientific Discoveries Upon returning to the United States after the first expedition Bingham referred to his discovery of Machu Picchu as “scientific.” This delineation was not insignificant. By claiming to have made a scientific discovery, Bingham gained recognition as an explorer who illuminated an amazing example of history. He also gained stature within an elite group of men. To discover something of scientific merit was to make a contribution to universal knowledge, not merely to explore or go on an adventure. This framing was due in part to at least three factors. First, the site was inhabited and farmed during Bingham’s discovery. Second, across one of Machu Picchu’s rocks was the signature “Agustín Lizárraga” and the date 1902.106 Third, Bingham had paid someone to guide him to Machu Picchu. To situate the discovery as scientific meant that Bingham not only saw the place, as so many others before him had done, but also made a contribution that surpassed existing knowledge. In Bingham’s first published account of the discovery of Machu Picchu, he wrote: “It [Machu Picchu] was known to a few people in Cuzco, chiefly residents of the province of Convención, that there were ruins, still undescribed, in the valley of the Urubamba. One friend told us that a muleteer had told him of some ruins near the bridge of San Miguel.”107 Bingham went on to say that while en route to Machu Picchu, the expedition team reached a hut where they were treated hospitably: “Several good-­natured Indians welcomed us and gave us gourds full of cool, delicious water, and a few cooked sweet-­potatoes. All that we could see was a couple of small grass huts and a few terraces, faced with stone walls. The pleasant Indian family had chosen this eagle’s nest for a home. They told us there were better ruins a little farther along.”108 Bingham admitted in the article that he had heard vague rumors about the ruins from friends and that Machu Picchu must have been previously known, because the French explorer Charles Wiener referred to the ruins in his text Pérou et Bolivie (1880). In Bingham’s pocket field journal, he initially credited Agustín Lizárraga with the discovery: “This place discovered in 1902 by Lizarraga. The people have lived here four years, planted cotton and vegetable and ruins on andenes. 3 huts now occupied. Climate seems to be good— . . . corn, sugar cane . . . tomatoes, currants, beans, potatoes. An Intihuatana stone near top of works. Much fine stone work. Some very large stones. Best windows I have ever seen. Many horses.”109 In his 1930 account, Bingham wrote about Wiener’s unsuccessful attempt to visit in 1875 and then that Lizárraga “had been treasure hunting on these forest-­clad slopes at least\n\nIntroduction 17\n\nten years before our visit to this cave.”110 Although Bingham referred to Lizárraga as the discoverer in his first articles and speeches, and even in Inca Land (1922), the presence of Lizárraga’s signature faded until, in his final version of the story, Lost City of the Incas (1952), Bingham claimed to have found the site himself.111 Mariana Mould de Pease, a Peruvian writer and intellectual, has strongly contested Bingham’s fame as discoverer of Machu Picchu. Although she refers to Bingham as the first traveler to visit the sanctuary of Machu Picchu and the first tourist, Mould de Pease argues that José Gabriel Cosio112 in 1911 became the first Peruvian to visit Machu Picchu as scientist, writing his own Anglo-­style travel memoir.113 In several of Cosio’s publications, he likewise repudiated the notion of Bingham as discoverer of the ruins.114 Mould de Pease views the signature of Agustín Lizárraga seen by Bingham on the walls of Machu Picchu as a sign of Machu Picchu’s “Peruvianess.”115 For Mould de Pease, positioning Bingham as the discoverer has initiated a history of Machu Picchu as a place dedicated to foreign visitors. The fact that a local boy led Bingham to the site further fuels her desire to deemphasize and demythologize Bingham and the other expedition members as discoverers. Mould de Pease calls for a Peruanization of the site and its meaning, arguing that a new history must be written, this time from the perspective of Peru. This perspective must focus on the Peruvians who participated in making Machu Picchu famous and on the importance the area had for its inhabitants; it should not prioritize tourism over other uses.116 In 2002 a group presented a motion to the Peruvian Congress calling on it to officially recognize Agustín Lizárraga, Gabino Sanchez, and Enrique Palma as discoverers of Machu Picchu because their names had been written on its rock walls in 1902.117 New scholarship further contests Bingham’s claim to be the discoverer of Machu Picchu. A German engineer named J. M. von Hassel made maps of the area as early as 1874, and Augusto Berns, an engineer working for Southern Peruvian Railways, had attempted to extract riches from the area with his sawmill before Bingham’s expedition.118 Building on this, Mould de Pease contends that Bingham knew of Machu Picchu before his arrival in Peru in 1911 and was duplicitous, even conspiratorial, in claiming to have discovered the site.119 Albert Giesecke, whom Bingham had invited to accompany him to the ruins, originally said that Bingham was lucky in finding Machu Picchu. Later, in a radio address to Club Cuzco on February 15, 1945, Giesecke changed his story, saying that he had told Bingham about the ruins.120 Even the New York Times joined the debate\n\n18 Framing a Lost City\n\nover who really discovered Machu Picchu, asking in a 2008 headline, “Was a Lost City Ever Lost?”121 As more people weigh in on whether Bingham was the discoverer, the hunt for a true discoverer perpetuates the notion that Machu Picchu was found by an Anglo male. The notion that Quechua speakers had inhabited the area long before any of those discoverers arrived on the scene continues to be elided. The racialized myth of discovery continues without a larger contextualization of the individuals, networks, and infrastructure that facilitated the Yale Peruvian Expeditions. Precisely what Bingham did to transform the act of seeing Machu Picchu into a discovery has been ignored. Craig Owens writes about the debate between the art historian Meyer Schapiro and the philosopher Martin Heidegger over a pair of boots painted by Vincent Van Gogh.122 In The Origin of the Work of Art, Heidegger claims that the boots in Van Gogh’s painting are a pair of peasant woman’s shoes. Challenging Heidegger, Schapiro asserts that the shoes are the artist’s, which therefore transforms the painting into a self-­portrait. Citing Derrida, Owens writes that there is no disagreement between Schapiro and Heidegger. The two men are in perfect agreement because both are asking the same questions: To whom do the shoes belong? Whom do the shoes represent? The search for Machu Picchu’s real discoverer mirrors the question over the old boots in the painting. By replacing Bingham with a different heroic figure, Mould de Pease and countless others who have sought to debunk and demythologize Bingham all ask the same question: who discovered Machu Picchu? The answer is always the same: a mythic figure whose presence frames a place through the negation of others, all while perpetuating the notion of a lost city waiting to be found. That Bingham was not alone in his expeditionary achievements continues to be overlooked. Such questions seem to typify the long history of imperial and national narratives.123 Bingham did not discover Machu Picchu. Rather, the allure of science, an elite industrial transnational social network, nationalist dreams, and a camera first imagined and then produced Machu Picchu as a discovery—the lost city trope eternally circulating anew. Bingham did make the area known to a huge number of people. But his work was a reshaping, not an unearthing. Before Bingham’s photographic parade, the archaeological site was used for farming and pasturage. People who inhabited the area had their own imaginings, meanings, and purposes for the area. Instead of referring to himself (or Cosio or Berns or von Hassel) as a discoverer of something, which implies the presence of a pre-\n\nIntroduction 19\n\nexisting entity, all its shape and meaning lifted out of the ground whole, perhaps a more accurate description of Bingham would be a discoverer for something—tourism, sightseeing, economic development, photographic adventure, scientific inquiry, local identity. This book attempts to write the doing, the activity, the politics, and the work that was initially involved in making Machu Picchu into a lost city found—an artifact in all senses of the word.124 This book is not a story about the heroism or antiheroism of Hiram Bingham. The focus is not whether Hiram Bingham was a great explorer initially motivated to explore Peru by sexist competitive jealousy,125 or whether Albert Giesecke first informed him of the whereabouts of Machu Picchu. This isn’t a biography of Bingham or the men who accompanied him on the expeditions. Other books do a far better job of trying to gain insight into the personality of Bingham.126 Instead, this book examines the practices and technologies of the expedition and how these transformed a place into a “discovery.”127 Thus, this book tracks how Machu Picchu was invented as a discovery and how the topos of lost cities captivated the world.\n\nSeeing, Circulation, Contests On the goals of historical anthropology, Brian Axel writes: “Rather than the study of a people in a particular place and at a certain time, what is at stake in historical anthropology is explaining the production of a people and the production of space and time.”128 The contributors to the volume Anthrohistory likewise abandon the idea of a total history in favor of examinations of specific concepts and ontologies.129 Rather than viewing history as reconstruction, the authors propose to trace signs of things unfolding over time, emphasizing the in-­between. Working in these generative margins of knowledge, what others have referred to as boundary work,130 is the task of the historical anthropologist. This book emphasizes the intricate details of how science makes its objects. The first two chapters examine how the 1911 expedition was initially conjured and seen. Chapter 1 looks at how the expedition was imagined, developed, navigated, and deployed, all through letters. Letter writing was, in effect, a foundational expeditionary practice, negotiating and conjuring a lost city. The materiality of the letters suggests that it was not simply the ideas espoused in them but also their tangibility that made them instrumental in the outcomes of the expeditions. The chapter de-\n\n20 Framing a Lost City\n\ntails the success of letter writing by documenting the myriad donations received from corporations and wealthy industrialists and the ways in which the letters facilitated entry and access to the Peruvian countryside. Tracking the names of the correspondents reveals how a powerful network took shape, one that ultimately empowered Bingham to see. Chapter 2 examines the expeditionary practices of collecting. In 1911, Bingham and the Yale Peruvian Expedition team first sighted Machu Picchu. On the team’s return visits to Peru (1912 and 1914–1915), it mapped, excavated, and photographed the Andean region around Cuzco. The legacy of the expeditions includes its collections: exotic animals, books, antiquities, and, most significantly, skeletal remains. This chapter examines the collecting practices of the expeditions to suggest that the objects collected as well as the technologies and practices used in collecting helped fashion Machu Picchu into a lost city that was scientifically discovered by Bingham. Drawing on evidence such as expedition circulars and reports to understand how collecting was accomplished on the three tours, this chapter demonstrates how the expedition relied on prospecting by paid local laborers, accompanied by state-­sponsored coercion, to iterate the notion that science had a sovereign claim on objects that might contribute to the accumulation of its knowledge. Ultimately, the reenvisioning of Machu Picchu as a vestige of the glorious Inca race and a scientific discovery was materialized and initially evidenced through its collected objects. Photographs made public this reenvisioning. The next three chapters focus on the ways in which initial scientific imaginings were materialized as representational facts that moved. Chapter 3 details the origins of the photographs of Machu Picchu, particularly the foldout panorama that appeared in the National Geographic Magazine’s iconic April 1913 issue, “In the Wonderland of Peru.” The photographs were taken during a period when the camera was viewed as a scientific instrument that could capture data objectively. Although Bingham considered photography a primary scientific technology because it allowed team members to bring back material evidence of discoveries, the analysis presented in this chapter demonstrates that the use of the camera during the expeditions was a negotiated and disciplined practice. Kodak cameras were not simply taken out of their cases and used. Rather, their use was fraught with difficulty not only because of the cameras’ users, but also because of the complicated technology and the fickle Andean climate. Thus, presenting Machu Picchu as a lost city that was discovered by the Yale expedition involved a particular configuration of human and non-\n\nIntroduction 21\n\nhuman actors and practices that stabilized the so-­called facts created by the expedition. The National Geographic Society partially sponsored the 1912 and 1914–1915 Yale Peruvian Expeditions. In exchange for its sponsorship, the society was granted rights to all the expeditions’ photographs. The first major public display of expeditionary photographs came in “In the Wonderland of Peru,” which included 244 illustrations. Images from this issue were subsequently reprinted in newspapers, magazines, and traveling exhibitions worldwide. This chapter addresses the ways in which the framing of the initial photographic images of Machu Picchu was shaped by scientific, commercial, and national desires and designs. It examines not only how the magazine issue was carefully crafted by the editor of National Geographic to privilege photography as the primary means to convey information about Machu Picchu and Peru to readers, but also how this photographic meaning was unstable when circulated. Through a reading of the images and text of “In the Wonderland of Peru,” and its selective translation in the popular Peruvian illustrated magazine Ilustración Peruana, this chapter examines how the notion of a discovered lost city was translated in Peru. On the second and third expeditions, physicians conducted anthropometry on the Quechua-­speaking population of Peru. Anthropometry, a popular science in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, sought to address debates on racial origins through the collection and comparison of body measurements and categories such as age and sex. Bodies were mapped in an effort to scientifically situate subjects within an evolutionary paradigm that held Caucasian bodies as superior. Along with calipers and meter sticks, photography was integral to the science and collection of anthropometric data. Frontal and profile images of each subject were taken, and medical maladies such as massive goiters were documented. Unlike the images appearing in National Geographic, anthropometric photographs were not widely circulated. Chapter 5 examines the practice of anthropometry on the expeditions to suggest that the same race-­inflected categorization that sustained practices such as the collection of antiquities also made possible the collection of native bodies through photography. In effect, there could be no glorious Incan past, with its accompanying vision for a future utopia, without the degenerative indigenous present to overcome. Chapter 6 concludes with an examination of the conflict surrounding Bingham and Yale in Peru. In 1912, Yale and Hiram Bingham sought a ten-­ year concession from the Peruvian government to allow them the rights\n\n22 Framing a Lost City\n\nfor exclusive removal of archaeological objects. This concession and Yale’s presence became highly controversial. By the time of the final expedition, Peruvian national politics had shifted, and the removal of Peru’s ancient past through what was considered the robbing of its ancestral grave sites became hotly contested, eventually culminating in an injunction to halt excavations. This final chapter charts the negotiations, failed concession, and concerted efforts to stabilize Machu Picchu as an object not of science but of Peruvian patrimony, suggesting that the right to see or frame was paramount to consolidating a national identity around historic Incan objects.\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nEpistolary Science\n\nThe officials of the Royal Geographical Society, and Sir Clements Markham, who probably knows more about Peru than any living geographer, have assured me that the region which we propose to explore is in great need of scientific exploration. In fact they speak of it as one of the most interesting jobs that remain to be done. Hiram Bingham to Huntington Smith, January 11, 1911\n\nOne of the pleasures of working in an archive is reading letters. The Yale Peruvian Expedition Papers and the Bingham Family Papers are housed at Yale University’s Sterling Library. Bingham’s papers include scrapbooks full of newspaper cuttings, miscellaneous images, reports and articles written by team members, and other documents related to the expeditions. The majority of the collection, however, consists of letters. Like much of Yale’s campus, the historic reading room, established in 1938, pays architectural homage to European enlightenment and liberal study. Entering the elegant wood-­paneled room, with its high ceilings and handful of researchers seated at long communal tables, conjures personal fantasies of intellectual pursuit and collective contemplative study. What letters are they reading? Whose lives are they thinking about? Surrounded by this display, one’s sense of Machu Picchu’s making begins. The correspondence of the Yale Peruvian Expedition Papers includes typed and handwritten letters as well as calling cards and postcards.1 The small rectangles of card stock with invitations to places like the Cosmos Club, in Washington, DC, spark curiosity into the privileged frameworks that Bingham accessed. Did he go? What was it like? What did he wear? What did he drink? Who was there? With whom did he converse? Filed in chronological order, the letters create suspense as the reader witnesses\n\n26 Framing a Lost City\n\nthe slow emergence of Machu Picchu and the crafting and crumbling of Bingham’s reputation. Although Bingham often dictated his correspondence to one of his secretaries, who typed the letters in carbon, some are penned in Bingham’s hand. Prices and equipment were negotiated with Kodak; dreams were shared and disappointments tempered with the National Geographic Society; accounting figures and donations were calculated and settled with Yale’s treasurer. Through the letters, one glimpses the negotiations and unfolding of the expeditions to Peru. These negotiations were not simply about defraying costs or managing personnel. They were also work in the purposeful imagining and practice of the expedition. Through all of them, Bingham and the dream of discovery were in play. Read together, they form a telling conversation—incomplete but evocative and illuminating. Reading the letters painstakingly organized by Yale’s archivists sheds light on the extensive cultivation in Machu Picchu taking root. Photography, a Tiffany heiress, the draw of ancient civilizations, Christian missionary pasts, and the thrust of finance and industry early in the twentieth century indelibly mark the ephemera and thus the site.2 Machu Picchu is hewn through the banal reminders and logistical scaffolding seen on seemingly inconsequential slips of crispy, wafer-­thin sheets of hospital blue. The correspondence not only conveys information about the benefits of Bingham’s expedition and its practices—where they went, what they saw, and who did or did not join them—but also demonstrates the making of Machu Picchu as a discovery. In the letters, one witnesses social conventions of writing, exclusionary class hierarchies, the promise of privilege, philanthropy, the pursuit of antiquarianism, perceived thefts of national patrimony, racism, nationalism, logics, and relationships that ran the spectrum from friendship to enmity. From these letters, Machu Picchu and Hiram Bingham take shape, emerging not in totality, but dunelike, shifting, each letter massaging the narrative into a quintessential story of the early twentieth-­century. The letters are not simply reflections of history. They are history. This chapter examines letter writing as a constitutive practice of scientific ordering. Although Bruno Latour and Steve Woolgar famously tracked how facts became constituted in a closed laboratory setting, Bingham’s expeditionary science in the laboratory of Latin America was less contained.3 Bingham cultivated an extensive and expansive network of individuals and corporations to sponsor and support the expedition through letters. Letters were sent to interlocutors as close as nearby Mys-\n\nEpistolary Science 27\n\ntic, Connecticut, and to places as far afield as England and Peru. Although letter writing is not typically considered a scientific practice, in this case it acted as one, forging not only a social network that validated and supported the expedition, but also an observational trajectory and meaningful framework for the discovery of a lost city. Besides making visible the network that translated Machu Picchu,4 focusing on letter writing demonstrates the value of letters to the expedition as material objects in their own right. Letter writing is a social practice and an act of communication exhibiting conventions of proper prose and civility.5 Letters, however, also act as instruments of imagination and power, nurturing and expanding social space, gathering a collective of witnesses. The epistles of the Yale Peruvian Expedition demonstrate the bounded and privileged social network that participated in the initial imagining and subsequent witnessing of Machu Picchu, and also how that collectivity and such imagining was shaped. Through words or their absence, the letters conjure the experiment of the Andes within a proscribed and privileged social space. Through letter writing, the Andes, the Incas, and, ultimately, Machu Picchu were prefigured as geography, nation, and history in need of a scientific experiment. Through letters, agency was enacted.6\n\nImportant Scientific Work to Be Done The importance of letters to science is not new. The “Republic of Letters” is a term used to describe a network of intellectuals during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries who shared ideas and scientific papers through letter writing.7 Voltaire, for example, penned some eighteen thousand letters, which acted as a vehicle for expanding an intellectual community, but also for resolving tensions and achieving authority, all through an ethos of politeness.8 The reports that circulated during this period were rich in circumstantial detail and allowed readers to imagine, or virtually witness, an experimental scene that they did not actually see. The reports also acted as an instrument to enlarge the community witnessing the experiment, which in turn created a public that aided in constituting authentic knowledge and matters of fact.9 Like scientific papers, Bingham’s letters networked an expanding group of people, involving them in what would ultimately become one of the world’s best-­known and most visited heritage sites.\n\n28 Framing a Lost City\n\nAlthough Bingham’s epistolary verve was not as great as Voltaire’s, he shared ideas, queries, and solicitations for assistance through letters. Unlike reports, however, the letters acted as key instruments in negotiating the grounds for the eventual experiment, informing and shaping expeditionary practice and outcomes. These negotiations were intellectual as well as social, since specific people and businesses were enrolled in the project through the crafting of a sellable vision of Peru and of a purpose for the Yale Peruvian Expedition. Before intrepid savants could find Machu Picchu from afar, it had to first be imagined as lost. Such imagining work prepared a foundation for the ways in which Machu Picchu came to have life globally. In 1909, Julio C. Tello, who would become one of Peru’s most celebrated archaeologists, sent Bingham, via a shared contact, Roland Dixon at Harvard University, a copy of a paper written by Carlos Romero (1909).10 The paper discussed the ruins of Choqquequirau, which Bingham had recently visited, and suggested that the lost city of the Incas was named Vitcos and was located near Pucyura.11 Bingham did not immediately act on this information, and instead spent the summer writing and enjoying time with his family, considering expeditions elsewhere—including Mexico and Ecuador.12 He also wrote to his friend Stuart Hotchkiss about a trip to the Amazon basin.13 In late November and early December 1910, however, Bingham began writing letters about his plans regarding Peru. His first was a response to a letter from Albert Giesecke about Giesecke’s thwarted attempt to visit Choqquequirau. Bingham sent along photographs from his previous visit, stating that he hoped to revisit the ruins of Choqquequirau soon and spend a couple of months in the vicinity. “Has any archaeologist visited the ruins?” Bingham queried.14 On December 5, Bingham wrote Adolph Bandelier, the author of The Islands of Titicaca and Koati.15 Bandelier had suggested that Mount Coropuna was the tallest peak in South America. Bingham wrote: “I expect to go to Peru next year, partly to visit Coropuna and partly to see if I can find any remains of the Incas in the valleys North and East of Choqquequirau.”16 Giesecke was one of Bingham’s most significant correspondents.17 A graduate of the University of Pennsylvania, he went to Cuzco in 1910 to reopen and reorganize the National University of San Antonio Abad of Cuzco (UNSAAC).18 Although Giesecke was only twenty-­six years old, four years younger than the legal age to be rector of a university, Peruvian president Augusto Leguía appointed him rector.19 Giesecke held the position for fourteen years, influencing the academic community of\n\nEpistolary Science 29\n\nCuzco and becoming involved in census taking, rural education, economic development, and city beautification projects.20 Giesecke was in many ways a knowledge broker of Cuzco society for Anglo-­American scholars. Notable US anthropologists such as John Rowe and Julian Steward, as well as members of the US Department of Agriculture, solicited his assistance.21 The relationship between Giesecke and Bingham was built on a shared understanding of Peru as a nation “in need,” but also a nation “of promise.”22 Like explorers before him, Giesecke considered Peru as a country of past greatness and future potential.23 Exploration was a vehicle to gain access on both fronts. Giesecke used his correspondence to apprise Bingham of the current political and intellectual climate in Peru. My dear sir: I was glad to receive your letter of November 25th, with views of Choqquequirau. I turned these over to Mr. Juan José Nuñez, as you requested, and in addition read him your letter. He was highly pleased to hear about you, especially about your intention to return shortly. In that case he is ready to go to any measure necessary to insure success in a visit to Choqquequirau. . . . Professor Max Uhle has not yet been able to visit these ruins, as the government has not voted any money for excavations until present moment. He was in Cuzco several months ago, conducting a party of Americanistas through the place, in his capacity as Director del Museo Nacional de Lima. When I asked him about this affair he said the government would delay appropriations for a cientific [sic] investigation for some time to come. Hence, I think we could do something voluntarily meanwhile.24\n\nSix months later, Giesecke followed up by stating that the Peruvian government was going to spend about $2,500 on archaeological work by Max Uhle, but that Uhle would not “receive the money (and hence can do nothing) until the end of the year.”25 Giesecke articulated Bingham’s need to act promptly. The language of “we” transformed the scientific work into a national competition, and made the quest to discover ever more urgent. Bingham sought scholarly advice to help shape the proposal and inform the planning of the expedition through letters. For context, logistical support, and legitimacy in crafting the initial vision of the expedition, he wrote Clements Markham; V. F. Marsters, a geologist who resided in Arequipa and Lima; and Harvard’s William Curtis Farabee. Marsters\n\n30 Framing a Lost City\n\neventually provided information about the most auspicious time of year for climbing Mount Coropuna, the best approach, and the name of a good arriero (muleteer). He also recommended where to stay en route (a mining camp in La Victoria).26 Although Gilbert Grosvenor, director of the National Geographic Society and editor of its magazine, would eventually become one of Bingham’s most important interlocutors, for the 1911 expedition Bingham relied on Markham and Farabee for scholarly assurance, authority, and advice. Even with Giesecke’s urging, the expeditionary goals remained malleable at first, suggesting that Bingham was strategic and calculating in his planning, the expressed goals of the expedition not quite fixed. On November 30, 1910, Bingham introduced himself to Markham in a letter. It began with a reference to a previous visit to London and his trip to South America. Bingham had been given a letter of introduction to Markham, but the latter was out of town. After efforts at self-­ credentialing and a nod to Markham’s useful work, Bingham asked for suggestions for good work needing to be done in the coastal range northwest of Arequipa: “Can you tell me whether any one has done any scientific exploring there and where I can find the record of it? Do you know any one who has computed accurately the height of Mount Coropuna? Could you tell me whether Lake Parinacochas has ever been surveyed or sounding taken of it? Anything that you would be so good as to send me regarding this region will be most gratefully received.”27 Markham replied on December 18 in support of the expedition. Bingham responded on January 4, 1911, thanking Markham for his approval and explaining that the idea of exploring Lake Parinacochas came from Markham’s Desiderata in Exploration (1907).28 Bingham, who had lost his copy, asked where might he procure another. Bingham then legitimized himself and the expedition by citing scholarly work—Markham’s own, along with efforts such as Antonio Raimondi’s map of Lake Parinacochas’s contour.29 He then asked Markham for specific suggestions about scientific work. On January 18, Markham replied, noting that he had requested a replacement copy of Desiderata be sent to Bingham. Markham then proffered advice on the type of boat he should bring, how much sounding line, and which types of scientific instruments: a small theodolite and a good chronometer watch. Markham added that a sextant and artificial horizon were not useful for inland work. He advised on the best route to and from the lake and further expanded Bingham’s scholarly frame, noting that a new manuscript had been found at the Copenhagen library.30\n\nEpistolary Science 31\n\nIf you have seen my recent book on the Incas you may have noticed, in the first chapter, an account of the discovery of a very important manuscript in the Copenhagen library, by an Inca noble name Guaman Poma, who was chief of Lucanas; which gives the province a special interest. You might return by Vilcas-­Huaman, and make a thorough examination and plan of the ruins. It has only been visited by the Frenchmen Wiener who is not very reliable. I have not seen any account of your visit to the ruins of Choque-­ quirau, and should be very much obliged if you would kindly send me anything you have published on that subject. Wishing you all possible success I remain Yours Very Truly.31\n\nThrough the correspondence with Markham, several things occurred. First, a prominent and prolific geographer of South America became aware of Bingham and his work. Second, practical knowledge was exchanged regarding field practices, measurement techniques, and travel routes. Third, Bingham’s plans for the expedition were legitimized through Markham’s encouraging words and his engagement in epistolary exchange. If Markham had not replied, Bingham could not have drawn on his reputation as authoritative support in his future fund-­raising solicitations. Fourth, and perhaps most importantly, the Peruvian interior was solidified as a place in need of scientific exploration. William Curtis Farabee was the other scholar who was particularly useful for Bingham.32 He participated in three trips to Peru, including the de Milhau–­Harvard Expedition, which he led for Harvard’s Peabody Museum from 1906 to 1908.33 Farabee provided crucial information and support for Bingham, including contacts such as Marsters and important local figures such as Alberto Duque of Cuzco. Duque later took Bingham to several ruin sites and allowed the team to store supplies and equipment at his hacienda. Farabee’s letters further enhanced the idea of Peru as a place in need of exploration. In planning the expedition, Bingham asked Farabee about logistics. How long would it take to get from Cuzco to Santa Ana? Could he purchase supplies in Santa Ana? Would it be possible to follow the Urubamba Valley all the way down from Ollantaytambo? Bingham ended the letter with a display of well-­mannered bonhomie, perhaps as a gracious lure or perhaps merely as gratitude for information. I wish you would come down and spend a weekend with me during the Easter vacation. There are so many things I want to ask you. I have\n\n32 Framing a Lost City\n\ndecided to take three men with me and have practically raised all the money for their expenses. If I can get extra money I shall take also a doctor and an assistant topographer. Otherwise I shall be content with a geologist and geographer, a topographer, and a naturalist. Do say you will come and spend a week with me. Faithfully Yours, Hiram Bingham34\n\nAlthough Farabee did not visit Bingham personally, he responded in detail to Bingham’s queries. The distance from Cuzco to Santa Ana was about forty leagues; to Urubamba, eight; four more to Ollantaytambo. There were ruins along the river, as well as places to stop, but he should carry provisions and a tent. The road was good all the way, and they could easily make the trip in two days. They would be treated well by two governmental officials at Santa Ana, and Mr. Duque, who had a large plantation, would be their “best authority and assistant.”35 Bingham drew on Farabee’s experience to plan his route, justify the trip, and eventually facilitate the exploration of the countryside. Farabee had already provided Bingham a map containing information collected from traverses made by traders and rubber gatherers regarding distances and locations in the Peruvian interior. The map included Farabee’s own work and astronomical observations. Farabee also shared that the Geographical Society of Lima had a record of all positions in Peru, and the railroad officials in Arequipa knew the positions for southern Peru.36 Letters became valuable vectors of information that garnered scientific support. As more letters were exchanged, more people learned of the proposed expedition, securing consensus for its worth. Correspondence with Giesecke, Farabee, and Markham demonstrated Peru’s known qualities, but also sustained an imaginary of Peru as a nation where valuable scientific work could be done. What was known and what was unknown worked together to facilitate the need for an expedition. Bingham went on to solicit information from colleagues such as his friend Ernest Howe, a Yale geographer who provided recommendations for photographic equipment.37 Through letters, Bingham received maps made by Raimondi and Edward Stanford, geographer to Her Majesty the Queen.38 Bingham also reciprocated with information, sending his written work to Clements Markham and Carlos A. Romero.39 The exchange of information continued throughout all the expeditions as Bingham tuned his scholarly sight, promoted the expeditions, and secured both financial and intellectual support.40 For example, before the 1912 expedition, he again sought guidance from Markham: “In your ‘Incas of Peru’ on page\n\nEpistolary Science 33\n\n291, you say Rodriguez de Figueroa ‘wrote an account of the mission’ which has been preserved. Will you be so good as to tell me where this account is and whether it has been published? I am trying to unravel the history of Vilcabamba, so far as I can and I am sure this account would be most useful. I do not like to trouble you with this question, but I do not know who else can answer it.”41 With the initial go-­ahead from Giesecke and the intellectual support from Markham, Bingham began fund-­raising in early January 1911. Writing first to Huntington Smith,42 Bingham explained the purpose for the expedition.43 There would be three members of the expedition: Bingham; Herbert Gregory of Yale, who would do the geological and physiographical work; and a topographer, who would make a map through a section of the country that had not been scientifically explored and only “mapped in the rudest way some fifty years ago.” Bingham wrote that a skilled topographer could make an accurate and lasting map that would bolster Yale’s research reputation. In this early letter, climbing Mount Coropuna was not mentioned as part of the expedition. Instead, the expedition would study villages, or “human geography,” in the mountainous area, which was located in a region of interest for South American history.44 The team would measure the lake and look for Incan ruins that might be discovered in the “glacier-­clad peaks, which separate Choqquequirau from the Urubamba Valley.” As Bingham put it: “With this party of three it is my plan to explore a section of Peru, starting from the Sea Coast some fifty miles North of Mollendo and going due North across the Andes into the Amazon Valley as far as practicable.” Bingham estimated that the trip would cost about $5,000. He proposed to meet one-­third of the total expenses and hoped that Smith might contribute a like amount. All funds would be overseen by Yale’s treasurer. A few things stand out in this initial cast of the expedition. First, enlisting the support of other Euro-­American scholars was vital. In none of the correspondence does he mention Marsters or the work of Carlos Romero, whose original informe (report) shed light on the whereabouts of the lost city. Instead, he invoked Farabee, who knew the valley and confirmed Bingham’s opinion that “the region which I propose to enter is one of the most important unexplored archaeological fields in Peru.”45 He cited Markham’s support, saying that he felt the expedition “was one of the most interesting jobs that remain to be done.”46 Bingham’s letter suggested that what “remain[ed] to be done” in science was finite. Bingham felt that much of the world had already been discovered and at least partly explored. The discovery of the North Pole circulated in\n\n34 Framing a Lost City\n\nnewspapers in 1909; the South Pole was (controversially) staked by Roald Amundsen for Norway in 1911.47 The popular feeling about these explorations was that the earth’s surfaces had been tracked, mapped, and seen.48 Not much remained in the realm of earthly frontiers. Scientific exploration was valuable because it could find the last remaining pieces of the jigsaw puzzle, benefiting civilization along the way. In contrast to previous South American scientific expeditions, Bingham’s would be specific rather than grandiose. Filling in particular gaps in knowledge contrasted markedly with nineteenth-­century expeditionary narratives, in which knowledge of just about everything was viewed as needed. Although Bingham’s enterprise of knowledge was significantly expansive, his expedition sought measurable outcomes and useful information for history, business, trade, and government. This frame of commercial and national relevance assisted Bingham in the planning, financing, and execution of his expedition. Second, the primary goal of the expedition, as expressed in this initial letter to Smith, was cartographical. Though the team would survey and explore the countryside, much of the letter is taken up with explaining mapmaking, its importance, and the value of hiring a topographer. Ed Harkness, an early supporter of the expedition, was not interested in mountain climbing or Incan ruins but rather in conducting a survey along the seventy-­third meridian.49 This perspective was reflected in the plans for the expedition and its fund-­raising solicitations. Paying a topographer to make a map was of utmost importance for the scientific value of the expedition. Including an archaeologist wasn’t mentioned, and Mount ­Coropuna would have its height measured, but would not be climbed. Third and most critically, the hunt for Vilcabamba or Incan ruins generally does not come across as the most vital goal of the expedition. Bracketing the eventual sighting of Machu Picchu, Incan ruins seem to be an afterthought or add-­on to an ambitious research plan. Bingham discusses mapmaking, the work of Professor Gregory, Mount Coropuna, and Lake Parinacochas, and then concludes that he is “convinced that there are more Inca ruins to be discovered in that locality.”50 A few sentences discuss archaeological work and ruins north of Choqquequirau. In the end, Huntington Smith did not offer financial support for the 1911 expedition, but the letter, as an initial frame, would be retooled over the subsequent months. Undeterred, Bingham continued his letter-­writing campaign, inquiring about personnel, sponsorships, and information from Yale alumni and colleagues. In late March and early April, a boilerplate solicitation was distributed to several people.51 The letter cites previous scholars’ work to validate\n\nEpistolary Science 35\n\nBingham’s claims. But the March letter, although building upon the initial vision in the letter to Smith, shifts the details of the expedition. Bingham begins by outlining the dates for the expedition, which will conduct geographic, archaeological, and historical explorations (anthropological work was dropped). As Bingham outlined it, the expedition would address four central “problems.” First and foremost, it would look for more Incan ruins near Choqquequirau and Urubamba, doing “everything we can to visit any ruins that are reported particularly in the Vilcabamba valley.” Second, it would conduct a reconnaissance of the seventy-­third meridian from the Amazon Valley to the ocean, which was a region of historic significance. Third, members of the expedition would climb Mount Coropuna, determining its height and mapping it, as well as studying the human geography around the mountain. Fourth, they would make a bathymetrical survey of Lake Parinacochas and its shores. All four endeavors would contribute to the ultimate objective of exploring a portion of Peru that was “not yet known to science.” Bingham additionally promised to collect and catalogue the flora and fauna of Cuzco. Expeditionary personnel had grown to include a director, a geologist, a skilled topographer and his assistant, a “physiographer” (expert in physical geography), and possibly a surgeon and a naturalist, who would make collections for Yale’s museum.52 The expedition began to emerge through negotiation and practice.53 Markham and Farabee continued to be enlisted as legitimizers of Bingham and the scientific expedition. But the plan of the expedition had morphed over the course of three months, suggesting that initial expeditionary desires and goals were inchoate, a product of negotiating the interests of funders and the ideas of scholars as much as of fulfilling personal desires for bagging peaks and locating lost cities. While they would still be measuring the lake, they would also be climbing Mount Coropuna to determine its elevation. The cross-­section of the Andes would be made along the seventy-­third meridian, the specificity of the measurement lending the expedition an air of scientific authority and clarity. Most significant, however, was the reordering of the expeditionary plan to highlight the search for Incan ruins as the first problem to be solved. The plans for the expedition had been honed. Ruins, whether previously known by Farabee or not, were in need of scientific exploration. The search for a lost city became pressing.54 While there is similarity between the letters of January and March 1911, with some of the wording even identical, the discovery of lost cities took root as the expedition’s organizing principle. Instead of a small crew of three, the number of personnel expanded to potentially seven. Their work would be extensive, the information and collections to be gathered lim-\n\n36 Framing a Lost City\n\nited only by the size and ability of the crew. The purpose of the expedition solidified. Through such stabilization, Peru was transformed into a place of scientifically unexplored archaeological fields. Not simply an exercise in reconnaissance or an idealized scientific quest in mapmaking, this expedition was expressly about locating ruins to discover where the last Inca lived after escaping from the Spaniards. The shimmer of science executed through letter writing made that goal both desirable and realizable. In contrast to January’s letter, March’s solicitation is more precise in illuminating a plan. The tone is more direct and confident, invoking specificities about reconnaissance, bathymetrical surveys, latitudes, longitudes, summiting Mount Coropuna, and making collections for the Peabody Museum. The March letter gives an unambiguous sense of the expedition’s priorities. We see the clarity gained from Giesecke’s efforts to push excavation and archaeology, the confidence garnered from Farabee’s information about the area, Markham’s input on Lake Parinacochas, and even the threat that another explorer might summit Mount Coropuna first.55 The last solicitation letter showed the culmination of months of collective crafting of the expeditionary vision, resulting in a compelling plan for"
