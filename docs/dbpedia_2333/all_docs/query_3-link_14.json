From climbing one of the seven summits and the mountains of the Rockies to ruck marches in the desert, but especially the paths that lead to Compostela, I am meant to trek this earth, always carrying physical pain with me.\n\nNow that both of my legs have been rebuilt over the past couple of years, I look forward to walking Camino again carrying perhaps only a few ounces of physical pain rather than pounds.\n\nkohara\n\nActive Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nFrances 2014\n\nPortugues 2019\n\nDel Norte 2020\n\nMar 24, 2022\n\n#202\n\nRoman mile post inside the wonderful fortress that is the old town of Valenca.

He was also highly ambitious and shamelessly schmoozed the Queen, who was furious to discover he had married without letting her know. He inveigled himself back into her favour but her successor, James the First of England, the Sixth of Scotland, did not trust him and clapped him in gaol. His persuasive powers were clearly formidable, however, as he convinced the King to allow him to lead an expedition to the Americas to discover El Dorado, the fabled city of gold, which Sir Walter probably knew perfectly well did not exist. With explicit instructions not to do anything to annoy the Spanish, he did exactly that by attacking and trying to plunder one of their settlements. On his return to England, he was arrested, tried and sentenced to death by beheading. This poem is assumed to have been written by him as he awaited execution. If so, displays outstanding courage and equanimity in the face of death.\n\nView attachment 121567\n\ndick bird,\n\nThis is another splendid photo. Where was it taken?\n\nFurther to the history of Sir Walter Raleigh the capital city of the US state of North Carolina was founded in 1792 and named for Sir Walter Raleigh, who attempted to establish the first English colony, the Roanoke colony, on the shores of the new world in the 1580s.\n\nLast edited: Mar 30, 2022\n\nPhoenix\n\nVeteran Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\n.\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nMost recent: Fall 2023 Aragonés, Frances\n\nMar 30, 2022\n\n#269\n\nJuvenile white storks near Arcos on the Invierno.
