Maurice Chevalier and Claudette Colbert light up the screen in this charming musical comedy The Smiling Lieutenant directed by Ernst Lubitsch.

While on patrol, Lieutenant Nikolaus “Niki” von Preyn (Chevalier) winks at his beautiful love interest, Franzi (Colbert). However, a frumpy princess named Anna (Miriam Hopkins) mistakenly believes he is flirting with her. Niki soon finds himself walking down the aisle at his own royal wedding and being whisked away to a neighboring kingdom. When Franzi follows the newlyweds, she finds herself tangled between her old love and a new friendship with Anna.
