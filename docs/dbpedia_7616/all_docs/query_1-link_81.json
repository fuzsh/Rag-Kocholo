        "text": "In retrospect, I had literally no idea what I was getting into when I decided to go through the works of Ernst Lubitsch. It took me a little while to find the right wavelength from his films, his Germany period being largely mediocre in my opinion with a handful of small bright spots, but once he hit the sound era in America, I was fully on board.\n\nI had seen a handful of his stuff before, but it had been years for any of them. I’d seen the late-career highlights that everyone points on (like this video of Peter Bogdonavich talking about four films to recommend from Lubitsch’s career, none of which were made before 1939), but it was his musicals with Maurice Chevalier and Jeanette MacDonald that enchanted me in such unexpected ways. I was also somewhat surprised to find my favorite of his films coming a bit early with The Student Prince in Old Heidelberg sticking with me through all the raucous naughtiness of the pre-Code films and stately emotion of the mature period.\n\nLubitsch worked with a fair number of writers, but if he was working with Hans Kraly (the man who broke up his marriage, incidentally), Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett, or Samson Raphaelson, his films were all distinctly his. Covering similar topics, using similar settings, and dealing with similar characters while never losing sight of his Lubitsch Touch, he was far more than just a director for hire. He came to America in 1923 as one of the most powerful men in the film industry anywhere, and once he started producing his own films in the mid-20s, there was nothing between him and the kinds of stories he wanted to tell (though, like most filmmakers, he did have passion projects that never got off the ground).\n\nThis run was an absolute delight. It was amazingly entertaining. I genuinely loved so much of what he made, and I completely understand people like Irving Thalberg and Billy Wilder idolizing the man. He made movies that were distinctly his own, wonderfully entertaining, and seemingly incapable of replication by other mere mortals. I want more people to discover his work because his films brought me just so much joy.\n\nSo, below is my ranking of all of his surviving feature films, and do check out the other definitive rankings.\n\n36. The Eyes of the Mummy\n\n“This really just wasn’t Lubitsch’s area. Maybe he could have developed more, but even at this very early stage in his career, it’s obvious that he was more naturally inclined for light comic stuff rather than plot-driven thriller filmmaking.”\n\n35. Sumurun\n\n“So, Sumurun is not a bad movie, but I wouldn’t come close to calling it good. It’s something of a brute force effort by Lubitsch to squeeze as much entertainment from a stone as possible.”\n\n34. Anna Boleyn\n\n“It’s a middling film, right in line with these other historical, melodramatic epics that Lubitsch was directing late in her German career.”\n\n33. Shoe Palace Pinkus\n\n“There are entertaining bits here and there, enough to entertain at some level at least, but without the ability to really create a strong central character or bring him into a series of gags that feed a clear central narrative, the film just mostly lurches from one event to the next.”\n\n32. Meyer from Berlin\n\n“Lubitsch had made worse up to this point in his career, but he’d also made a fair bit better.”\n\n31. Monte Carlo\n\n“So, this isn’t top tier Lubitsch, which is unfortunate. It’s very slight with an ending that does entertain. It honestly feels like a rush job. The more passive camera and less impressively staged musical numbers inform the speed at which the production must have gone. It’s not a bad film, but Lubitsch was obviously capable of much more.”\n\n30. The Lady in Ermine\n\n“I do wish Lubitsch had lived for another twenty years and made another fifteen films, but while The Lady in Ermine is not nearly the heights of his best work, it’s far from his worst.”\n\n29. Carmen\n\n“However, after the dull disappointment that was The Eyes of the Mummy, it’s nice to see Lubitsch recovering with something handsome and well made. That it doesn’t connect fully is unfortunate, but he’s not done yet.”\n\n28. That Uncertain Feeling\n\n“He could miscalculate and make lesser work, especially in an era when filmmakers didn’t take 2-3 years to develop projects all the time. This could have been a much better film with a longer writing schedule from Walter Reisch and Donald Ogden Stewart. As it stands, it’s an intermittently entertaining film that simply doesn’t come together like it should.”\n\n27. Bluebeard’s Eighth Wife\n\n“I think Bluebeard’s Eighth Wife is a misfire. The character denouement doesn’t hit hard enough to make up for the narrative opaqueness that precedes it. It’s amusing pretty consistently, heavily helped by the charming leads in Cooper and Colbert, but Lubitsch is simply not operating at the same level here as he did in things like The Smiling Lieutenant or The Merry Widow.”\n\n26. Rosita\n\n“Rosita has its charms, including an ending that stands things on its head while giving a minor, thankless role the last laugh, and it’s far from the worst Hollywood debut. However, Lubitsch was still really aching for spoken dialogue, even if he didn’t quite realize it at the time.”\n\n25. Three Women\n\n“There’s enough skill on display in both the writing and direction to make the film almost worthwhile. It’s a near miss, I think.”\n\n24. The Wildcat\n\n“This isn’t the top tier of Lubitsch’s early comic work in the German film industry. It’s second tier behind The Doll and The Oyster Princess, but it’s certainly funnier than the Sally Meyer stuff.”\n\n23. Forbidden Paradise\n\n“As it is, despite the heavy barriers for entry, I came away with some small admiration for the effort. It’s not the unwatchable disaster I thought the print would be, and enough of the original charm comes through.”\n\n22. Madame DuBarry\n\n“The performances and physical production are top rate, but the storytelling needed a new approach in the silent era that less relied on dialogue and told its story more fully through visuals.”\n\n21. One Hour with You\n\n“The comic ending simply ceases to work because the implications are no longer light but heavy, and just brushing it off like it doesn’t matter, especially when Colette is anguishing for about half the movie because she thinks Andre is going to have an affair, doesn’t make sense from a character point of view. I was disappointed.”\n\n20. The Loves of Pharaoh\n\n“I don’t think he quite overcomes the inherent weaknesses of character, but Lubitsch ends his German period with his strongest historical film. I still think he’s demonstrated a more natural strength in silly, witty comedies than this heavier stuff, but he’s also proven to be a competent filmmaker in a variety of genres, if he hasn’t really demonstrated a strong command of the silent film form that someone like Fritz Lang had done in the same environment.”\n\n19. Eternal Love\n\n“So, it’s not The Student Prince in Old Heidelberg, but it’s not Anna Boleyn or Sumurun either. Overall, I’d call it pretty good, something that ends a whole lot better than it begins, but I kind of love a good chunk of it.”\n\n18. Angel\n\n“However, it’s handsome, well-acted (especially from Marshall), and contains the necessary pieces to make that ending work. It’s a solidly good drama from a man who hadn’t made a drama in a few years.”\n\n17. The Doll\n\n“It’s light and frothy farce that could have benefited from a stronger approach to its characters to establish them and their motives. However, what drives the film is its light comic sensibilities which, when combined with the intentional storybook visual aesthetic, creates a delightful little trifle of a film that points to where Lubitsch was going to go later.”\n\n16. So This is Paris\n\n“There’s a light, effortless feel to Lubitsch’s final products that so easily entertain that he makes it feel simple. Filmmaking is never simple, and that light touch is really why his films are becoming more and more enchanting, even when we’re dealing with lesser works of a man obviously made for greater things.”\n\n15. The Oyster Princess\n\n“This is a small delight again from Lubitsch early in his career. He still had a little way to go in terms of plotting things out to rely less on coincidence, but he’s helping the audience have fun nonetheless.”\n\n14. The Marriage Circle\n\n“The Marriage Circle is quite comfortably Lubitsch’s most successful film up to this point. Whether it was the freedom from German company Ufa’s house styles, his former writers, lessons he’d learned working for Mary Pickford, or the introduction of a new, talented writer in Paul Bern, Lubitsch was finding his voice more comfortably than ever.”\n\n13. Cluny Brown\n\n“Is this a challenging film? Not at all. It’s a gentle ribbing of British reserve that has some small bite, but we all know that Lubitsch is doing it in good humor. Is it towards the highs of his pre-Code musicals? No, not really. It’s a nice, amusing, and sometimes quite funny little comedy.”\n\n12. Heaven Can Wait\n\n“As it stands, the movie is a small delight. It’s the sheer strength of Lubitsch’s body of work that this could be considered a minor success, though.”\n\n11. Broken Lullaby\n\n“The rest of the film is a quiet, introspective look at pain, shell shock, and regret while trying to find a way forward. It’s very atypical Lubitsch, especially at this point in his career, but he handles it with care and tact.”\n\n10. Lady Windermere’s Fan\n\n“This is Lubitsch’s best film so far in his career. That it falls just shy of greatness is a tad disappointing, but he really did the best with what he had.”\n\n9. To Be or Not to Be\n\n“I don’t think To Be or Not to Be quite reaches the highest ranks of Lubitsch’s body of work, but it’s still really good and entertaining. It’s just that Lubitsch’s highs are so high.”\n\n8. Design for Living\n\n“This is more of a confection from Lubitsch than his other confections that have a bit weightier character stuff to build off of, but the character stuff is solid enough and the Lubitsch Touch is on grand display at the same time.”\n\n7. The Love Parade\n\n“The Love Parade is an absolute delight of a film that both amuses and moves at the same time. It’s an early triumph of the medium of sound film, and it shows that Lubitsch was more than just a witty filmmaker. He was a technically accomplished one as well.”\n\n6. The Smiling Lieutenant\n\n“The Smiling Lieutenant is one of those movies where it seems like the public consciousness really begins for an artist (Stagecoach by John Ford was another), and while there are real delights before it, I see the appeal of starting here. This is Lubitsch as the world knows him, and it is wonderful.”\n\n5. Trouble in Paradise\n\n“Trouble in Paradise is such a delight, and it just might be the peak of Lubitsch’s work. Funny, touching, surprisingly taut in places, and all around funny, the film is one of pre-Code Hollywood’s most enjoyable farces.”\n\n4. Ninotchka\n\n“This is one of the triumphs of Lubitsch’s body of work. Funny, touching, and involving, Ninotchka is one of his best films and a classic that really does stand the test of time.”\n\n3. The Merry Widow\n\n“The big dance numbers, the charismatic performances, the comic timing, and the light tone all combine together in such a unique way that it’s a challenge to do more than point at it and say, “Isn’t it grand?” Because it is grand, and it’s all about enjoying the moment.”\n\n2. The Shop Around the Corner\n\n“I fell in love with Lubitsch’s work when he entered the sound era with his bawdy musicals starring Maurice Chevalier, but the advent of the Hays Era really forced maturity into his work. Directing from a wonderful script by Samson Raphaelson, Lubitsch made one of his absolute finest films while evoking a kind of place he grew up in.”\n\n1. The Student Prince in Old Heidelberg\n\n“This is the first Lubitsch film that I’ve completely and totally loved. I wouldn’t change a single frame in the whole thing. Lubitsch only had two more silent films in him before the sound era took over (the lost The Patriot being one of them), and it was at the end of the silent era where he showed that he had complete control over the elements of the medium like the best of his peers. This is a great film and one of my favorites from the era.”"
