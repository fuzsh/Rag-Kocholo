        "text": "Lieutenant Niki:\n\nDo you know whom she reminds me of? Your wife.\n\nMax:\n\nOh, wait a minute! Oh, this girl is beautiful!\n\nLieutenant Niki:\n\nSee, here.\n\nMax:\n\nNo, no, no, you're crazy.\n\nLieutenant Niki:\n\nJust picture your wife - fifteen years younger, twenty pounds lighter, her hair dyed, her nose operated on. The same girl.\n\nKing Adolf XV:\n\nThis is unheard of. Flausenthurm without an \"h?\" Don't they know, in Vienna, how to spell my country?\n\nPrincess Anna:\n\nIt's a deliberate insult, Papa. They're trying to make us feel, just because we've a little country, we shouldn't have so many letters.\n\nPrincess Anna:\n\nPapa, you may not realize it, but I'm desperate. I'm no longer responsible. I'm capable of anything. If you don't let me have my Lieutenant, do you know what I'm going to do?\n\nKing Adolf XV:\n\nWhat?\n\nPrincess Anna:\n\nI'm going to marry an American!\n\nKing Adolf XV:\n\nSo that's what she does, eh? Plays the violin?\n\nPrincess Anna:\n\nYes, papa. And in public! Tell me, papa, be frank do all girls like that play the violin?\n\nKing Adolf XV:\n\nNot necessarily, but I'll tell you one thing: they play!\n\nPrincess Anna:\n\nWell, I can play too!\n\nPrincess Anna:\n\nI love him so dearly.\n\nFranzi:\n\nI'm just wild about him.\n\nPrincess Anna:\n\nI don't blame you. Isn't he good-looking?\n\nFranzi:\n\nOh, and how!\n\nPrincess Anna:\n\nThat's it exactly! And how! Did you see him in his new uniform?\n\nFranzi:\n\nAt the wedding? Stunning!\n\nPrincess Anna:\n\nBut to tell you the truth, I like him even better in his dinner-coat.\n\nFranzi:\n\nWith the straw hat?\n\nPrincess Anna:\n\nYes, with the straw hat!\n\nFranzi:\n\nOh, that's nothing. Did you ever see him in... oh, never mind!\n\nCol. Rockoff:\n\nLieutenant, I'm here on a very confidential mission. Her highness, the Princess Anna, wanted to talk to you, but before talking to you, naturally she took up the matter with her father, His Majesty, the King. His Majesty, the King, decided that Her Highness, the Princess, should not talk to you first. On the contrary, you should first talk to Her Highness, the Princess. But before talking to the Princess, His Majesty the King wants you to talk to him, so that he can give you permission to talk to the Princess. But then we all got together and had a little talk, and came to the conclusion that, under the royal Flausenthurm etiquette, you, being an ordinary lieutenant, cannot do the talking at all. You understand?\n\nLieutenant Niki:\n\nPerfectly. May I ask what you are talking about?\n\nCol. Rockoff:\n\nIn one word, Lieutenant: Please don't *you* propose to the Princess.\n\nLieutenant Niki:\n\nBut I never intended to! And I never will!\n\nCol. Rockoff:\n\n[shakes hands with him] Thank you! Congratulations!\n\nMax:\n\nOh, she's so beautiful! And what a figure she has! Mmmm. And Niki, you should see her fingers. Oh, she has the daintiest little fingers! She plays the violin, you know.\n\nLieutenant Niki:\n\nWhat does she do?\n\nMax:\n\nShe plays the violin. And how! She's the leader of a girls band in a beer garden. I've just come from there. Oh, Niki, Niki I've got to meet her! Oh, but, I've got to be so careful because I'm a married man."
