        "text": "Early life and work\n\nLubitsch was born into a Jewish family; while some sources give his birth date as January 28, 1892, others—notably his daughter—state that he was born a day later. He worked in his father’s Berlin clothing store while acting at night. In 1911, at age 19, he joined the company of stage director Max Reinhardt. Lubitsch played minor stage roles until shortly before World War I, when he began performing in one-reel silent film comedies in the ethnically stereotyped but sympathetic role of Meyer, a well-meaning Jewish bungler. In the process, he became one of the most popular comic actors in Germany and began writing and directing the Meyer films.\n\nBy 1915 Lubitsch had begun directing feature-length comedies, and he soon left Reinhardt to devote himself to movies full-time. In 1918 he directed Die Augen der Mumie Ma (The Eyes of the Mummy), his first film with Pola Negri and Emil Jannings, both of whom he would work with regularly, as all three became audience favourites in Germany. Lubitsch’s elaborate costume dramas in the early post-World War I period were among the first German productions to be shown abroad. Some of the more notable of those films were Madame Du Barry (1919; also released as Passion), Anna Boleyn (1920; also released as Deception), Sumurun (1920; One Arabian Night), and Das Weib des Pharao (1922; The Loves of Pharaoh).\n\nTransition to sound\n\nLubitsch’s transition from silent to sound films was among the most assured of any director. His first sound effort was the inventive 1929 musical The Love Parade, in which Maurice Chevalier and Jeanette MacDonald (in her film debut) find romance in the mythical land of Sylvania. With songs composed by Victor Schertzinger, this pleasant operetta was nominated for an Academy Award as best picture, and Lubitsch was nominated for best director. In that film and Monte Carlo (1930), Lubitsch freed the camera from the soundproof box and static position used by most directors at the beginning of the sound era. Instead, he filmed sequences without dialogue and dubbed the sound in later.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

His films were considered prestige projects that were not always big successes commercially but lent the studio cachet. As a result, he was also given a free hand creatively, often produced his own films, and had the privilege of final cut. With the advent of sound, Lubitsch’s affinity for theatrical traditions became even clearer, not just in his borrowing of wit, urbanity, and elegance from the comedies of manners of Oscar Wilde, George Bernard Shaw, and Molière but also in his debt to “well-made” bourgeois farces by playwrights such Victorien Sardou, Eugène-Marin Labiche, and Georges Feydeau. In his Chevalier-MacDonald musicals, Lubitsch also was the first director to introduce songs as a natural part of the plot.\n\nOne Lubitsch film that was a box-office success was The Smiling Lieutenant (1931). Nominated for an Academy Award as best picture, this musical, set in 19th-century Vienna, starred Chevalier, Claudette Colbert, and Miriam Hopkins. Among the contributors to the screenplay was Samson Raphaelson, who would collaborate frequently with Lubitsch throughout the director’s career. Lubitsch’s follow-up to The Smiling Lieutenant, the sombre antiwar drama Broken Lullaby (1932; also released as The Man I Killed), with Lionel Barrymore, was praised for its brilliant camera work, but with his next effort the director returned to his tried-and-true operetta format, reuniting Chevalier and MacDonald in One Hour with You (1932). Thereafter he would never stray from the staple of his success—romantic comedies. A remake of The Marriage Circle, the effervescent One Hour with You was originally to be directed by George Cukor, who was unceremoniously shunted aside when Lubitsch, the film’s producer, could not keep his hands off the camera. Before long, Lubitsch was directing. When he assigned himself sole credit, Cukor contested the action in arbitration. Ultimately, Cukor waived his claim in exchange for being freed from his Paramount contract.\n\nLubitsch’s next project, Trouble in Paradise (1932), is considered by many to be his masterpiece. Hopkins and Herbert Marshall played romantically involved French jewel thieves who gain employment with a wealthy woman (Kay Francis) so that they can bilk her out of her fortune. As in many of Lubitsch’s films, a love triangle develops, complications multiply with breathtaking invention, and an undercurrent of sexual naughtiness is conveyed through suggestion and clever association.\n\nLubitsch was one of the seven credited directors who handled segments of the 1932 film If I Had a Million before turning his attention to Design for Living (1933), another sophisticated masterpiece with an erotic tinge. A somewhat expurgated version of Noël Coward’s play of the same name, it starred Gary Cooper and Fredric March as an artist and a playwright, respectively, who live in Paris in a ménage à trois with a fellow American expatriate (Hopkins). She disturbs their unusual arrangement by marrying a square businessman (Edward Everett Horton) but returns when she realizes what she gave up. The Merry Widow (1934) brought Chevalier and MacDonald together again under the auspices of producer Irving Thalberg and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) in a sparkling version of the Franz Lehár operetta, with new lyrics by Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart, among others."
