        "text": "Highest Rated: 100% The Heiress (1949)\n\nLowest Rated: 40% Becky Sharp (1935)\n\nBirthday: Oct 18, 1902\n\nBirthplace: Savannah, Georgia, USA\n\nThis highly talented blonde Broadway actress possessed an intriguing, husky voice and a brittle, sometimes twitchy yet sexy style. An off-beat combination of a vivacious Southern belle and an insecure yet superior modern woman, Hopkins signed as a leading lady with Paramount in 1930 and gained early stardom for her roles in productions including the delightful Ernst Lubitsch musical \"The Smiling Lieutenant\" (1931) and Rouben Mamoulian's striking \"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\" (1932). In Lubitsch's masterpiece, \"Trouble in Paradise\" (1932), she displayed a sharp talent for sly, sophisticated banter, and she won an Oscar nomination in the title role of Mamoulian's \"Becky Sharp\" (1935). The feisty, intelligent Hopkins gave what is probably her finest dramatic performance in William Wyler's sterling if significantly altered adaptation of Lillian Hellman's play \"The Children's Hour,\" \"These Three\" (1936).\n\nHighest rated movies\n\n100% The Heiress\n\n100% These Three\n\n92% Barbary Coast\n\n91% Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\n\n90% Trouble in Paradise\n\n88% The Smiling Lieutenant\n\n86% The Story of Temple Drake\n\n80% The Chase\n\nPhotos\n\nA GENTLEMAN AFTER DARK, Miriam Hopkins, 1942 DESIGN FOR LIVING, Gary Cooper, Miriam Hopkins, 1933 DR.
