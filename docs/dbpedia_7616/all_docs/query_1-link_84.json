        "text": "This is the fourth review batch focused on movie musicals on Cinecaps Digest; not a preferred genre of mine, as I made clear back in the original batch, but hardly a worthless film form. One of today’s featured musicals is a bonafide classic in my opinion, and a few others will no doubt be considered “classics” in the opinions of certain other viewers. Newer ones, older ones, pop tunes, showtunes, that sort of frisky thing. Anyway, keep a song in your heart, keep a boogie in your body, and enjoy these nine capsule reviews.\n\nThose earlier batches can be found here, here and here.\n\nAbsolute Beginners (1986)\n\nDirected by Julien Temple. Starring Eddie O’Connell, Patsy Kensit, James Fox, Anita Morris, Graham Fletcher-Cook, David Bowie, Edward Tudor-Pole, Tony Hippolyte, Steven Berkoff, Bruce Payne, Eve Ferret, Ray Davies, Mandy Rice-Davies, Sade, Chris Pitt. [PG-13]\n\nSlick but muddled British musical set in London’s West End of the 1950s with young lovers—photographer O’Connell and fashion designer/model Kensit—struggling to deal with the lure and price of fame. Flashy camerawork and elaborate pre-fab sets aid director Temple in crafting something memorable to look at, but the story never sorts itself out, chasing youth revolution, sociopolitical upheaval, and more without anything substantive beneath the surface. After a while, the erratic sensory assault just becomes exhausting and it’s easy to wonder just what the heck happened to those razzle-dazzle kids we were supposed to be rooting for? (Oh, wait, they’re narcissists.) In her first substantial film role, singer/actress Kensit is a breathy dud, and even if she did have chemistry with O’Connell, his character is played as a smug, shallow Soho symbol. At least some of the songs are decent (with contributions from, among others, Davies, Sade, and Bowie); it’s almost worth it just to see the latter superstar caper about on a giant typewriter. Temple also directed the music video for Bowie’s title tune, a chart success in the UK. Features Sade’s lone feature film appearance, credited here with her actual last name: Sade Adu.\n\n43/100\n\nRENT/BUY\n\nFame (1980)\n\nDirected by Alan Parker. Starring Barry Miller, Maureen Teefy, Paul Montgomery, Lee Curreri, Laura Dean, Gene Anthony Ray, Antonia Franceschi, Irene Cara, Jim Moody, Ann Meara, Boyd Gaines, Eddie Barth, Albert Hague, Tresa Hughes, Joanna Merlin, Richard Belzer. [R]\n\nShallow, untidy chronicle of the trials and tribulations of several students at New York City’s High School of Performing Arts, starting with their auditions and following them from freshman year through senior year graduation. Inspired by Marvin Hamlisch’s A Chorus Line, but it’s actually less a full-blown musical than an ensemble teen drama that gets interrupted now and then by intimate performance pieces and enthusiastically erratic song-and-dance eruptions as crowds of kids suddenly fill cafeterias, city streets, and the like to blow off steam. Naturalistic performances from the younger members of the cast run hot-to-cold but mostly slum it out in the lukewarm, the chief issue being that so few of them exhibit the sort of raw talent that would suggest they belong at the school in the first place, let alone have a promising future as performance artists. Parker treats Christopher Gore’s mosaic of melodramas in terms of gritty urban realism, unromantic and irresolute, maneuvering for superfluous scrapes into darker waters like a multiracial abortion, “casting couch” sleaze, and (most absurdly) punctuating a suicide feint with a punchline; the facsimile of urgency is weakly generated by the abrupt, Fosse-style editing frenzy, which only distances the viewer further from empathy. Michael Gore’s original score won an Academy Award; the title song, which he co-wrote with Dean Pitchford, also nabbed one. Spawned a TV series, a stage musical, a reality television competition spinoff, and a 2009 remake.\n\n48/100\n\nRENT/BUY\n\nIn the Heights (2021)\n\nDirected by Jon M. Chu. Starring Anthony Ramos, Leslie Grace, Melissa Barrera, Corey Hawkins, Gregory Diaz IV, Daphne Rubin-Vega, Jimmy Smits, Olga Merediz, Stephanie Beatriz, Dascha Polanca, Lin-Manuel Miranda. [PG-13]\n\nExuberant, periodically dizzying movie musical, based on a Broadway play by Lin-Manuel Miranda and Quiara Alegría Hudes, about a handful of dreamers living in the NYC neighborhood of Washington Heights. Bodega owner Ramos is head over heels for aspiring fashion designer Barrera while saving up to return to his Dominican homeland, college student Grace is too ashamed to admit that she’s a drop-out and tells her father (Smits) that the issue was paying tuition, and so on. The characters and their struggles have a universal relatability that almost short-changes the cultural celebration that the filmmakers were clearly striving for, with only a handful of details (Piragua-slinging, DACA, etc.) separating them from any other youths-chasing-the-prize picture. Plus, whenever the film veers into heavier dramatic territory—the dime-a-dozen dinner outburst, for example—it often feels like someone’s “harshing the buzz” in between the vivid, fizzy music numbers. Chu and company edit these sequences too aggressively, amplifying the rhythms but befuddling the flow, and the sheer volume of them overstuffs an already crowded and overlong enterprise (the pic runs the better part of two-and-a-half hours), but the energy and enthusiasm is undeniably infectious, and the standout moments do stand quite tall—check out little cousin Diaz dropping a verse while flanked by splashing swimmers at the local pool, or the “When the Sun Goes Down” number that blurs the line into fantasia when Grace and Hawkins defy gravity while dancing on the side of an apartment wall. Credit is also due the smartly-chosen cast and location shooting. Anyone who enjoys watching Miranda selling his shaved ice treats should stick around through the credits. Marc Anthony has a small role, and a few actors from the original stage production cameo.\n\n70/100\n\nIn theaters and on HBOmax until mid-July\n\nOklahoma! (1955)\n\nDirected by Fred Zinnemann. Starring Gordon MacRae, Shirley Jones, Rod Steiger, Gloria Grahame, Charlotte Greenwood, Gene Nelson, Eddie Albert, James Whitmore, Jay C. Flippen, Barbara Lawrence. [G]\n\nRomances among cowboys, farmers, field hands, and gals in frilly frocks breathe cornball life into this film version of the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical set in Oklahoma Territory near the turn of the century. The splashy production’s influence on reshaping the next decade-plus of movie musicals deserves recognition, but it’s likely to prove an endurance tests to anyone who’s not a hopeless romantic or enamored with the milieu. Two different love triangles spring up, but without even a scintilla of tension since there’s not only never a doubt about how they’ll be resolved, but the characters are forced by the script to behave in stupidly contrived fashions to keep up the charade. Jones makes an okay debut as the wholesome lass pining for cheery cowboy MacRae while leading on surly Steiger, but excepting Nelson’s sprightly clomping, the only actors that do commendable work are the older folks (shotgun-toting papa Whitmore and feisty aunt Greenwood). Not even close to enough plot to fill out the extended runtime, and the tunes only come in two varieties: unremarkable syrup that drips leisurely and infectious kiddie melodies. At least the long-winded dream/nightmare ballet centerpiece immediately precedes the intermission/entr’acte, so viewers will have a chance to go get themselves some coffee afterward (or just slap each other silly until fully awake again). Almost worth it for the vibrant color photography (the first film to utilize the Todd-AO process)…almost. The sound and scoring won Academy Awards.\n\n45/100\n\nRENT/BUY\n\nShall We Dance (1937)\n\nDirected by Mark Sandrich. Starring Fred Astaire, Ginger Rogers, Edward Everett Horton, Jerome Cowan, Eric Blore, Ketti Gallian, William Brisbane.\n\nMinor Fred & Ginger toe-tapper offers many of the same pleasures that audiences had come to expect from their collaborations, but when it comes to entertainment value, only a few dazzling dance numbers can be described as anything better than “fleeting.” Slapdash farcical plot requires the stars to deny interest in each other, pretend to be married, deny being married, actually get married, plan a quickie divorce, hesitate to divorce, and so on. He’s an American ballet dancer faking an accent when it suits him (and doing a lot more tap dancing than ballet moves), she’s an actual tap dancer fending off dance partners/would-be suitors. A dance number in roller-skates and the “Slap That Bass” number in an oceanliner’s engine room are a lot of good fun, but the storytelling is too strained, and aside from a couple of suggestive double entendres that squeaked past the censors, too few of the jokes land (Blore’s “spelling bee” phone bit is almost inspired, at least). George and Ira Gershwin tunes include American songbook standards “They Can’t Take That Away from Me,” “They All Laughed,” and “Let’s Call the Whole Thing Off.” Director of photography Joseph F. Biroc replaced David Abel mid-production but only the latter was credited.\n\n68/100\n\nRENT/BUY\n\nSingin’ in the Rain (1952)\n\nDirected by Stanley Donen & Gene Kelly. Starring Gene Kelly, Donald O’Connor, Debbie Reynolds, Jean Hagen, Millard Mitchell, Douglas Fowley, Madge Blake, Kathleen Freeman.\n\nDeliriously contrived yet sublimely entertaining “original” song-and-dance production is about as good as movie musicals get—lots of quality tunes, all of them performed with aplomb, and the “stuff” in between is a lot of fun, too. That “stuff” concerns an affectionately pointed Hollywood satire that depicts the transition from silent features to “talkies,” and how established star Kelly adjusts to the changing times; along for the ride are his obnoxious frequent screen partner (Hagen), lifelong friend (O’Connor), and a love interest (Reynolds) who’s an aspiring performer herself. Sparkling teamwork and exuberant choreography keep spirits high throughout with only one caveat—the rather interminable “Broadway Melody” suite that seems to go on forever after everything before it had been so nimble and electric (the final act recovers the lost momentum nicely, however). Kelly never had a finer vehicle for his outsized talents, O’Connor steals moments judiciously (and goes impressively wild doing his “Make ‘Em Laugh” showcase), and squeaky-voiced Hagen runs circles around Judy Holliday’s insufferable butchery of refinement from Born Yesterday. “Laugh” and “Moses Supposes” are the only original numbers; the others are recycled from Nacio Herb Brown’s catalog for MGM musicals from around the same era that the movie is set. Cyd Charisse and Rita Moreno make brief appearances.\n\n91/100\n\nRENT/BUY\n\nThe Smiling Lieutenant (1931)\n\nDirected by Ernst Lubitsch. Starring Maurice Chevalier, Miriam Hopkins, Claudette Colbert, George Barbier, Charles Ruggles, Hugh O’Connell.\n\nMusical comedy where Chevalier’s Viennese lieutenant falls in love with orchestra singer Colbert, but then inadvertently favors visiting princess Hopkins with a wink, a gesture that leads to confusion, outrage, and something akin to a shotgun wedding to avoid an international incident. Charming if unexceptional bit of fluff, with slow stretches and scant song numbers, the only memorable one being that bit of cheeky silliness where the ladies sing about their lingerie. Amiably risqué even by pre-Code standards; the sense of joy in the performances and a handful of hearty chuckles will keep most audiences entertained (those more receptive to Chevalier’s style—an acquired taste, to put it kindly—are more likely to fall for its spell). A pity that the Lubitsch touch fails in the end, as the script paints itself into a corner where a satisfying conclusion can’t be reached, unless one is so enamored with Hopkins that the romantic terrorism can be overlooked. Adapted from the Oscar Straus operetta, Ein Walzertraum.\n\n63/100\n\nRENT/BUY\n\nValley Girl (2020)\n\nDirected by Rachel Lee Goldenberg. Starring Jessica Rothe, Josh Whitehouse, Jessie Ennis, Mae Whitman, Logan Paul, Chloe Bennet, Alicia Silverstone, Camila Morrone, Ashleigh Murray, Judy Greer, Rob Huebel, Alex Lewis, Mario Revolori, Mary Neely. [PG-13]\n\nJukebox musical redo of the 1983 cult item is like a feature-length musical video from the same era: peppy, brightly-colored, and shallow as a kiddie pool. Rothe’s mall-addicted Encino blondie locks eyes with tattooed Hollywood rebel heartthrob Whitehouse and it’s instant infatuation (on page at least…the two actors share surprisingly little chemistry). Soon, she’s turning her back on her smug jerk of a boyfriend and vapid friends and he’s letting down his own gang and their band and…well, that’s about it, but they do pause for a lot of fragmented song breaks (and I do mean a lot—there’s even a medley during an aerobics session that folds about four songs into two chirpy minutes). More like a Gen-Z perspective on 80s milieu than an authentic recreation, and without a fresh satirical angle in play; the pic may not be a total wash, but it runs out of steam way too early, and there’s too little heart for investment in the characters’ fates. Through an unnecessary framing device, Rothe’s character tells her daughter this whole story from present day, but the mom version is played by Silverstone, who’s supposed to be in her…mid-to-late fifties?? Yeah, like, whatever. Filmed in 2017, but its release was delayed because of the casting of controversial YouTube personality Logan Paul; since he plays a preppy scumbag, at least the casting was apt? Some of the performers from the original film make brief appearances.\n\n42/100\n\nRENT/BUY\n\nYentl (1983)\n\nDirected by Barbra Streisand. Starring Barbra Streisand, Mandy Patinkin, Amy Irving, Steven Hill, Nehemiah Persoff, Miriam Margolyes, Allan Corduner, Doreen Mantle. [PG]\n\nGenderbending social role defiance as soggy kitsch—a deadeningly self-indulgent musical expansion of Isaac Bashevis Singer’s short story (“Yentl the Yeshiva Boy”) that served as Streisand’s directorial debut, an effort that’s undermined by a fatal flaw: Streisand the actress, hysterically miscast as the title character, who never resembles the young woman she’s supposed to actually be or the boy that she’s supposed to be passing herself off as. She plays a turn-of-the-century Polish Jew who wants to study the Talmud, but is forbidden from doing so because she’s female, so she cuts her hair and attends a yeshiva under the name of her deceased brother; complications ensue for her/him, including developing romantic feelings for fellow student Patinkin and reluctantly agreeing to marry his ex-fiancée (Irving). The Streisand faithful tend to adore this vanity project, and why not, considering how much her camera loves her and how many songs she’s permitted to sing as screen-hogging soliloquies (over a dozen, most of which just blend together, but, hey, it’s Babs)? All others are recommended to just go watch Fiddler on the Roof again. Irving was for a long time the only actress to ever be nominated for both an Academy Award and a Razzie for the same performance, until Glenn Close joined her for that dubious distinction with 2020’s Hillbilly Elegy.\n\n37/100\n\nRENT/BUY\n\nCheck back in a few days for the next update!"
