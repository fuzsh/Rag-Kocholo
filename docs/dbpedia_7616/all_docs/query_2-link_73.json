For a list of all films and reviews, please see my original post.\n\n*****\n\nNominees & Winner of 1931/32 (the award for Outstanding Production):\n\nWinner = Grand Hotel\n\nArrowsmith\n\nBad Girl\n\nThe Champ\n\nFive Star Final\n\nOne Hour With You\n\nShanghai Express\n\nThe Smiling Lieutenant\n\nGrand Hotel had been pegged by most critics as the one to beat and it lived up to that, surprising no one when it won Best Picture (or Outstanding Production, as the award was called at the time).\n\nWhat was happening in 1931/1932?:\n\nWilliam Goldman, Academy Award winning screenwriter of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969) and All the President’s Men (1976), is born on August 12, 1931.\n\nStar and director of 1967’s Best Picture winner The Graduate, Anne Bancroft and Mike Nichols, are born in September and November of 1931, respectively. Each would also earn Academy Awards on their own (Bancrofr for Best Actress in The Miracle Workerand Nichols for Best Director of The Graduate).\n\nActivist and reformer Jane Addams is the first woman to be honored with the Nobel Peace Prize, on December 10, 1931, for her efforts and accomplishments in social reform, women’s suffrage, and world peace.\n\nHattie W. Carraway (representing Arkansas) becomes the first female United States Senator on January 12, 1932.\n\nAviator Charles Lindbergh’s baby son, Charles Lindbergh Jr., is kidnapped from his crib in the family’s home on March 1, 1932. He was found deceased a couple months later and the arrest and trial of a suspect would be named “The Trial of the Century.”\n\nAcademy Award nominees Piper Laurie and Debbie Reynolds are born on January 22, 1932 and April 1, 1932, respectively. Reynolds would later win the Academy’s Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award in 2016.\n\nBest supporting actor nominees Anthony Perkins (for Friendly Persuasion) and Omar Sharif (for Lawrence of Arabia) are born on April 4, 1932 and April 10, 1932, respectively. Sharif appeared in three Best Picture Academy Award nominated films: Lawrence of Arabia (1962), Doctor Zhivago (1965), andFunny Girl (1968).\n\nAcademy Award winner Elizabeth Taylor is born on February 27, 1932.\n\nGeorge Eastman, founder of Eastman Kodak, kills himself on March 14, 1932 after suffering from a painful illness. His contribution of roll film in photography led to the development of motion picture roll film which was used by some of the first film companies.\n\nGrand Hotel star John Barrymore’s son (with actress Dolores Costello) is born on June 4, 1932. John Drew Barrymorewould later become an actor himself and father actress Drew Barrymore, continuing the Barrymore acting dynasty.\n\nFlorenz Ziegfeld Jr., legendary Broadway showman, dies on July 22, 1932. A 1936 biopic about him, The Great Ziegfeld, would go on to win that year’s Academy Award for Best Picture.\n\nAcademy Awards Summary and Trivia for 1931/1932 (1932 ceremony):\n\nThe fifth Academy Awards ceremony took place in the Fiesta Room of the Ambassador Hotel on Friday, November 8, 1932. The nominees were from films released between August 1, 1931 and July 31, 1932 and were voted on by 850 Academy members. 1,500 film people were in attendance.\n\nActor Lionel Barrymore had been excused as official Master of Ceremonies due to illness, but did still present the awards. Before announcing each winner, Barrymore paused and a snippet of dialogue from the winning picture was played over the loudspeakers. Actor Conrad Nagel, the Academy’s new president, was Master of Ceremonies and gave an inaugural address which included a special award to Walt Disney for his creation of Mickey Mouse. The Mickey Mouse cartoons were recognized as a huge selling point (monetarily and psychologically) for viewers and ensured their continued attendance at the movies, despite the financial hardships the country was facing due to the Great Depression. Nagel as president tried to cut down on lengthy speeches this ceremony and focused more on entertainment, including some comedy by Laurel and Hardy and Groucho Marx.\n\nThree new award categories were introduced honoring short films: Short Subject (Cartoon), Short Subject (Comedy), and Short Subject (Novelty).\n\nFour nominees for the 5thAcademy Awards were winners in previous years: Best Actress nominee forEmma, Marie Dressler, won the year before for Min and Bill; Karl Strauss was nominated for cinematography for Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde after being the first to win the award (with co-photographer Charles Rosher) forSunrise. Neither would win this time. However, Frank Borzage and Frances Marion would win their second awards (best directing for Bad Girland previouslySeventh Heavenand best writing for The Champand previously The Big House, respectively). At the time, 34 year old Frank Borzage was known not only for his incredible directorial work, but also for being one of the youngest directors in the business. Borzage was so surprised when announced the winner that he dropped his ginger ale in his wife’s lap.\n\nIn the most controversial move of the ceremony, Fredric March (for Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde) actually earned one more vote than Wallace Beery (for The Champ) for the Best Actor award, but per the Academy rules of the time declaring the win must be by 2 or more votes, it was considered a tie and both would win the Oscar. Another gold statue was ordered for Beery and he accepted stating, “I haven’t been so thrilled since I got my first pair of patent leather shoes.” [1] 1931 and 1932 were a high point in Wallace Beery’s career. In addition to his Oscar win, he was also named the #6 money making star of 1931 and #7 in 1932 (in the annual poll run in Quigley’s Motion Picture Herald and The Motion Picture Almanac).\n\nOther Academy Award Winners for 1931/32:\n\nBest Directing: Frank Borzage (Bad Girl)\n\nBest Actor: A tie between Wallace Beery (The Champ) and Fredric March ( Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde)\n\nBest Actress: Helen Hayes (The Sin of Madelon Claudet)\n\nArt Direction: Transatlantic (Gordon Wiles)\n\nCinematography: Shanghai Express (Lee Garmes)\n\nShort Subject (Cartoon): Flowers and Trees (Walt Disney, producer)\n\nShort Subject (Comedy): The Music Box (Hal Roach, producer)\n\nShort Subject (Novelty): Wrestling Swordfish (Mack Sennett, Producer)\n\nSound Recording: Paramount Publix Studio Sound Department\n\nWriting (Adaptation): Bad Girl (Edwin Burke)\n\nWriting (Original Story): The Champ (Frances Marion)\n\nSpecial Award to Walt Disney for the creation of Mickey Mouse\n\nMy Ranking:\n\nMy Winner = Grand Hotel\n\nFive Star Final\n\nShanghai Express\n\nBad Girl\n\nThe Smiling Lieutenant\n\nThe Champ\n\nArrowsmith\n\nOne Hour with You\n\nFor me, it was really a battle between Grand Hotel and Five Star Final for first place. Grand Hotel got the edge simply for the production value and set design. Both films matched each other when it came to performances. Arrowsmith and One Hour with You were neck and neck for last, though One Hour with You’s smarmy tone deaf ickiness vs. Arrowsmith’s yawn inducing chauvinism gave the former the slight edge for last place.\n\nSources:"
