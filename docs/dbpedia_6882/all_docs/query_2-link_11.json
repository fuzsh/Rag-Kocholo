        "text": "redford\n\nThere seems to be a bit of confusion as the term \"Redford\" can refer to a few different things, depending on the context. 1) Redford is a city located in the U.S. state of Michigan within the boundaries of Detroit. 2) It could also refer to Robert Redford, a famous American actor, director, and producer who is known for his roles in films like \"The Sting\" and \"All the President's Men\". 3) In terms of surname, Redford is an English habitational name from a place in Manchester named Redford, or from Redford in Sussex, both named with Old English rēad ‘red’ + ford ‘ford’. Without specifying a context, it's challenging to provide a single general definition.\n\nRedford\n\nRedford Charter Township is a charter township in Wayne County in the U.S. state of Michigan and a suburb of Detroit. The population was 48,362 at the 2010 census. Redford is the birthplace of musician Ted Nugent and arena football player Stephen Wasil. Redford is the site of Cloud City Studios, where the band Walls of Jericho recorded their debut album entitled From Hell. Redford is also the site of the first Fretter's electronics store. Redford is also the site of Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church and School, whose hiring practices spurred the 2012 Supreme Court Case Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church and School v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.\n\nREDFORD\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, Redford is ranked #10675 in terms of the most common surnames in America.\n\nThe Redford surname appeared 2,996 times in the 2010 census and if you were to sample 100,000 people in the United States, approximately 1 would have the surname Redford.\n\n86.3% or 2,588 total occurrences were White.\n\n7.1% or 213 total occurrences were Black.\n\n2.4% or 74 total occurrences were of Hispanic origin.\n\n2% or 60 total occurrences were of two or more races.\n\n1% or 32 total occurrences were American Indian or Alaskan Native.\n\n0.9% or 29 total occurrences were Asian.\n\nJack Anderson:\n\nWhen the [ first ] book came out, I had absolutely no idea it was going to be such a massive hit, and then, to be followed by Robert Redford making really an iconic movie … I realized I don't want to compete with Robert Redford and that great work of art they did. So I had to let it go and go on and do a number of other novels."
