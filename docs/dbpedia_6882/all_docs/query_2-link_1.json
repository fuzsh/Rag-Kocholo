        "text": "Robert -\n\na number 1 name of the past century!\n\n16 - this is the count with which the first name Robert has reached the top position, i.e. rank 1, of the most popular first names for boys in the USA. Admittedly, the last time was a while ago, in the year 1953, when 86,478 newborn boys were given this beautiful name. And even if it wasn't on top in the recent past, it has been given by new parents to their sons every year since first name statistics began in 1880, putting it in the exclusive circle of only 442 first names for boys that are given at least 5 times a year in the USA. This makes Robert a classic first name and a part of the traditional American identity.\n\nIn years where the graph has no value, the name Robert was given less than five times or even none at all in the entire USA.\n\n2022: Position 87 for the first name Robert\n\nIn 2022, the first name Robert was given to newborn boys 4,057 times, ranking it at #87 and making it the year with the least amount of newborn sons being named Robert by their parents. Even though the popularity of this name seems to be waning, a true classic can never be completely banished. So we can be confident that we will continue to see little boys named Robert for years to come.\n\nRegardless of where you live in the US, chances are you know someone called Robert. Because: There are men and boys named Robert in every state in the USA. If this does not sound particularly spectacular to you, you should know that of the more than 50,000 different male first names that occur in the USA, just 386 are recorded in each individual state, so the name Robert is definitely something very special. In some regions it’s even the most frequently found male first name, for example in Idaho, where Robert is number one in our SmartGenius ranking of the most common first names for men. The greatest chance of meeting Robert, however, is in Rhode Island. (Interesting to know: The state in which a name achieves the highest ranking compared to all other names does not have to be the state in which it also occurs most frequently in relation to the population.) In Rhode Island, one in 22 boys and men bears this popular name – that is far above average – in the entire USA it is only one in 35 men and boys and in Nevada where the name is least represented in relation to the population, you even have to ask an average of 59 men and boys for their name before you once get Robert as an answer.\n\nWith hands, flags and sounds\n\nHow to say Robert\n\nIf your name is Robert and someone asks after your name, you can of course just tell them what it is. But sometimes that isn't so easy - what if it's too loud, and you don't understand them well? Or what if the other person is so far away that you can see them but not hear them? In these situations, you can communicate your name in so many other ways: you call spell it, sign it, or even use a flag to wave it..."
