He’s always had an uncanny instinct for material that entertains but also educates, working on projects loved by audiences and critics. From his big breakthrough in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid to the romance of The Way We Were, and from the charm of The Sting to his Oscar-winning direction of Ordinary People, Redford has done it all throughout a six-decade career. He has also established the Sundance Institute and the Sundance Film Festival to support up-and-coming creative talent and has worked tirelessly to fight climate change. There has never been a performer quite like Robert Redford, and this photo-filled issue follows the Sundance Kid through the many highlights of his extraordinary life."
