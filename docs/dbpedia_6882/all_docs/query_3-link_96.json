        "text": "Actor Robert Redford’s childhood Home in Sawtelle, California 1938 to 1946\n\n1938 to 1946 is around the same time that Norma Jean (Marilyn Monroe) lived in another part of Sawtelle in her teens about 10 years older than Robert Redford. Robert Redford mentions briefly his younger years in Sawtelle living on Tennessee Place from the Robert Redford Biography by Michael Callan. In the biography, he mentions briefly the Mexican Pachuks (the Pachuco street gang from Sotel).\n\nOn “Robert Redford, the Biography 2012” by Michael Callan, it mentions a $3,000.00 dollar “Brick Bungalow” on Tennessee Place that Charlie (Robert Redford’s father whose name was Charles Redford) purchased around 1938 in a low income area (Sawtelle) and that this was a step down in an area bordered by crowded Hispanic developments along Pico Boulevard. In 1938 prior to Sawtelle, the Redford family lived on Bundy Drive in Brentwood, just north of Wilshire Boulevard, now part of a large cement parking lot for commercial businesses located on Wilshire Boulevard.\n\nThe only Brick Bungalows built in Sawtelle were generally located on Tennessee Avenue between Bundy drive and Barrington Avenue. My cousin Fernando Munoz who lived with his family near Sawtelle Boulevard and Iowa Avenue at that time, was a bricklayer and helped build those brick bungalows on Tennessee Avenue around the year 1937.\n\nThe Brick House currently at 11729 Tennessee Avenue was built in 1937, a year before the Redford family moved in.\n\nThe Telephone Directory image shown below dated March 1939 indicates Charles Redford (Robert Redford’s Father) lived at 11729 Imperial Way. The small “r” indicates residence, “S” indicates Sawtelle and the phone number is five digits, 39858. A few years later, the prefix AR was added to the phone number.\n\nIn 1942, the street was renamed Tennessee Place from Imperial Way and we see the Jan 1946 Telephone Directory below with Tennessee Place. In 1947, after the Redford family moved from Sawtelle, the street address of 11729 was again changed from Tennessee Place to Tennessee Avenue (Currently). The Numbering system of 11729 never changed.\n\nThe following Map was copied from the 1939 HOLC Map of the Sawtelle poverty area. See the Link: https://sawtelle1897to1950.wordpress.com/about/1939-holc-map-of-sawtelle-poverty-area/\n\nNo. 1 – Norma Jeane Baker’s house location (Marilyn Monroe) 1938-1946\n\nNo. 2- Actor Robert Redford’s house location 1938-1946\n\nNo. 3 – My Aunt Sara Delatorre & Cousin’s house 1940-1950\n\nNo. 4 – Our second family house location 1935-1947\n\nNo. 5 – Our first Family house Location 1933-1935\n\nNo. 6- My Uncle Carlos Dorame ‘s Family house 1935-1946\n\nand also my aunts Esther and Delia Dorame 1941-1948\n\nNo. 7- My cousin Fernando Munoz’s Family House 1935-1946\n\nMy Father, Mother and siblings of Mexican ancestry lived in that “Crowded Hispanic development” area from 1935 to 1947 on Olympic Boulevard and Federal Avenue just near Pico and Exposition Boulevards (Number 4 on the map above). Drinking alcohol was commonly done 1938-1947 at the Train Tracks on Exposition Blvd at the end of Federal Avenue by relatives and friends. Jay Silverheels from the “Lone Ranger series” would drop by ocassionaly to join in the drinking. My father would drive my family to the “Food Palace” Super Market on Pico Boulevard and Bundy Drive every Friday evening after receiving his weekly paycheck in the 1940s and 1950s, the Food Palace located a couple of blocks from the Redford house on Tennessee Place. Recently, a Japanese grocery “Marukai” Market was built and replaced the Food Palace Super Market at 12121 Pico Boulevard.\n\nFor more on my Family in Sawtelle see this link: https://sawtelle1897to1950.wordpress.com/about/1930s-1940s-my-family-of-mexican-ancestry-in-sawtelle/\n\nSamuel Dórame"
