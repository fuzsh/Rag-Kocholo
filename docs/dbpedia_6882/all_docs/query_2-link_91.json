The Mantiger or lampago, called by writers Montegre and Manticora, also occurs, e.g. the body of an heraldic tiger, with the head of an old man with long spiral horns. The supporters, however, to the arms of the Earl of Huntington are without horns. The Triton, or mer-man, occurs as a supporter, e.g. to the arms of Lord Lyttleton, and in more than one instance as a crest, e.g. of Sir Tatton Sykes and of the family of Lano in Leicestershire and Suffolk. The Neptune, q.v., in the arms of Sir Issac Heard, Gerter King at Arms 1750, is sometimes blazoned as a Triton.

A Dictionary of Surnames. Wordsworth Ed. 1988 p 283\n\nThe English name Radford is local in origin, being one of those names derived from the name of the place where a man once lived or where he once held land. In this case, the name simply signifies \"(a local) of Radford\", Radford being the name of different towns in Nottinghamshire, Oxfordshire and Warwickshire in England. The literal meaning of the name is \"red ford\" or \"reed ford\", as the Old English word \"read\" can be translated by \"red\" or by \"reed\".\n\nEarly records of the name include John de Radford, mentioned in the Pipe Rolls of Nottinghamshire in 1209 and Geoffrey de Ratforde cited in the Sussex Subsidy Rolls in 1296. The presence of \"de\" meaning \"of\" emphasises the local origins of the name.\n\nThe name was introduced into the United States of America by English Settlers, but is not a common name in that country today.\n\nBLAZON OF ARMS : Argent a fret and canton sable.\n\nTranslation : The canton stands very high among honourable bearings. It was awarded to individuals who had performed some kind of Eminent Service. The background colour argent (white) denotes peace and sincerity, while sable (black) represents Constancy.\n\nCREST : An escutcheon per pale argent and sable between two laurel branches in orle vert.\n\nTranslation : The laurel is said to signify Honour and achievement.\n\nORIGIN : England\n\nHistorical Research Centre\n\nRADFORD, RADFORTH (locality name) 'red(from the colour of the nearby soil)/road/riding (one that can passed through on horseback)/? reedy ford' OE; places of any of these four meanings in five counties. Guppy found -d to be very common in Derbys, with fewer in Oxen, Notts, Essex.\n\nCottle, Basil The Penguin Dictionary of Surnames.
