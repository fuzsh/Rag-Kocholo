She’s an alchemist and a cook…and sometimes she accidentally combines those professions with hilarious results (though I would like to make it so she does sometimes make Really Helpful Items so she ultimately becomes well known for this). She’s friendly and cheerful but a bit of a klutz at times.\n\nI’ve got her first name, but not her last name. Any help appreciated!\n\nStormbrew\n\nThat was actually my pandaren monk’s original name. I lost it when I changed servers. I miss it terribly.\n\nOr…\n\nBrewbaker\n\nThat’s his new name. I got it from the Robert Redford film.\n\nEven though they’re just first names to me, I always kind of imagined them working as a surname for him."
