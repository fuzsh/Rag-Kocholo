        "text": "Now a Hollywood icon, Robert Redford had only done a handful of films when he was cast with Paul Newman in 1969’s Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. (Newman was Butch and Redford was Sundance.) The huge success of the film made Redford a star, and during the 1970s he was one of Hollywood’s biggest leading men, co-starring with Barbra Streisand in The Way We Were (1973), with Faye Dunaway in Three Days of the Condor (1975) and with Dustin Hoffman in All The President’s Men (1976, directed by Alan Pakula).\n\nEarnest and handsome, Robert Redford has been an advocate for the arts and has used his celebrity to further political causes — mostly concerned with preserving nature. In 1981 he founded the Sundance Institute, dedicated to enriching American cinema; the annual film festival became a major event and the American equivalent of the film festival at Cannes."
