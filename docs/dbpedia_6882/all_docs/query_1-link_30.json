        "text": "AKA Charles Robert Redford, Jr.\n\nBorn: 18-Aug-1936 [1]\n\nBirthplace: Santa Monica, CA\n\nGender: Male\n\nRace or Ethnicity: White\n\nSexual orientation: Straight\n\nOccupation: Actor\n\nParty Affiliation: Democratic\n\nNationality: United States\n\nExecutive summary: The Sundance Kid\n\nRobert Redford's father was an accountant for Standard Oil, and Redford was raised in a comfortable middle-class household. He earned a baseball scholarship to the University of Colorado, but the scholarship was revoked after Redford hosted several drunken parties. He then studied drama at New York's Academy of Dramatic Arts, and became a busy actor on Broadway through the mid-1960s. On off days and between plays he worked on television a lot -- Perry Mason, Naked City, Route 66, The Twilight Zone, The Untouchables, and so on. His first film was the 1962 Korean war drama War Hunt, with Redford in a supporting role as a naïve recruit, and co-starring Sydney Pollack, who later directed several of Redford's most famous films. Neil Simon's Barefoot in the Park was Redford's biggest Broadway hit, and he also starred in a 1967 Barefoot film adaptation. It was his sixth film, and it made him famous.\n\nHis seventh film was Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, and at 32, Redford had become the embodiment of \"the golden boy\". Notable Redford films include The Candidate, The Way We Were, The Sting, Three Days of the Condor, and All the President's Men. He has also made dozens of near-classics, from Downhill Racer and Tell Them Willie Boy is Here to The Natural and The Clearing. He has directed six feature films, winning the Oscar as Best Director for Ordinary People in 1980. He was nominated again for Quiz Show in 1994, and has also directed The Milagro Beanfield War, A River Runs Through It, The Horse Whisperer, and The Legend of Bagger Vance.\n\nRedford's Sundance Film Festival, named after his Sundance Kid character, began as the Utah-US Film Festival in 1978. Held annually in Park City, Utah, the event has evolved into America's most prestigious showcase for films made outside the studio system. Ruby in Paradise, Sex, Lies and Videotape, Blood Simple, Hoop Dreams, Reservoir Dogs, The Blair Witch Project, and The Kid Stays in the Picture are among the independent films that have been launched by Sundance buzz. Redford is also the driving force behind the Sundance Institute, the Sundance Channel, and the Sundance Cinema chain.\n\nHe is politically liberal and often outspoken about it, albeit more tactfully than Barbra Streisand.\n\n[1] Verified with State of California, California Birth Index, 1905-1995.\n\nFather: Charles Robert Redford (accountant)\n\nMother: Martha Hart (d. 1955)\n\nBrother: William Redford\n\nWife: Lola Van Wagenen (consumer activist, m. 12-Sep-1958, div. 1985)\n\nDaughter: Shauna Redford (painter, b. 15-Nov-1960)\n\nSon: David James Redford (\"Jamie\", screenwriter, b. 5-May-1962, d. 17-Oct-2020)\n\nDaughter: Amy Hart Redford (actress, b. 22-Oct-1970)\n\nGirlfriend: Sonia Braga (actress, ex-)\n\nGirlfriend: Kathy O'Rear (costume designer, dated 1988 into the 1990s)\n\nWife: Sibylle Szaggars (German painter, dated 1999-2009, m. 11-Jul-2009)\n\nHigh School: Van Nuys High School, Van Nuys, CA (1954)\n\nUniversity: University of Colorado (lost scholarship)\n\nUniversity: Pratt Institute\n\nThe Weinstein Company Advisor\n\nBill Bradley for President\n\nJohn Kerry for President\n\nKerry Victory 2004\n\nKappa Sigma Fraternity\n\nNational Medal of Arts 1996\n\nFrench Legion of Honor 2010\n\nTraveled to the USSR 7-May-1988\n\nFILMOGRAPHY AS DIRECTOR\n\nThe Company You Keep (6-Sep-2012)\n\nThe Conspirator (11-Sep-2010)\n\nLions for Lambs (22-Oct-2007)\n\nThe Legend of Bagger Vance (29-Oct-2000)\n\nThe Horse Whisperer (15-May-1998)\n\nQuiz Show (14-Sep-1994)\n\nA River Runs Through It (13-Sep-1992)\n\nThe Milagro Beanfield War (18-Mar-1988)\n\nOrdinary People (19-Sep-1980)\n\nFILMOGRAPHY AS ACTOR\n\nAvengers: Endgame (22-Apr-2019)\n\nThe Old Man & the Gun (31-Aug-2018)\n\nJane Fonda in Five Acts (20-Jan-2018) · Himself\n\nOur Souls at Night (1-Sep-2017)\n\nThe Discovery (20-Jan-2017)\n\nPete's Dragon (31-Jul-2016)\n\nTruth (12-Sep-2015)\n\nA Walk in the Woods (23-Jan-2015)\n\nCaptain America: The Winter Soldier (13-Mar-2014)\n\nBirth of the Living Dead (18-Oct-2013) · Himself\n\nAll Is Lost (22-May-2013)\n\nThe Company You Keep (6-Sep-2012)\n\nA Fierce Green Fire (23-Jan-2012) · Narrator\n\nBuck (16-Jun-2011) · Himself\n\nSmash His Camera (Jan-2010) · Himself\n\nGrand Canyon Adventure: River at Risk (12-Mar-2008) · Narrator\n\nLions for Lambs (22-Oct-2007) · Prof. Stephen Malley\n\nCharlotte's Web (7-Dec-2006) · Ike the Horse [VOICE]\n\nAn Unfinished Life (19-Aug-2005) · Einar Gilkyson\n\nTrudell (20-Jan-2005) · Himself\n\nTanner on Tanner (5-Oct-2004) · Himself\n\nSacred Planet (12-Apr-2004) · Narrator [VOICE]\n\nThe Clearing (Jan-2004) · Wayne Hayes\n\nSpy Game (19-Nov-2001)\n\nThe Last Castle (19-Oct-2001)\n\nThe Horse Whisperer (15-May-1998) · Tom Booker\n\nUp Close & Personal (1-Mar-1996) · Warren Justice\n\nIndecent Proposal (7-Apr-1993) · John Gage\n\nSneakers (9-Sep-1992) · Bishop\n\nIncident at Oglala (8-May-1992) · Narrator [VOICE]\n\nHere's Looking at You, Warner Bros.
