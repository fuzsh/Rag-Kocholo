        "text": "Robert Redford's Wine Country Estate!\n\nMust SeeTop 10 Florida Condos For Sale\n\nNot one of Hollywood’s Ordinary People, especially when it comes to super-star actor, director and supporter of the arts, Robert Redford recently celebrated his 82nd birthday and announced his retirement as an actor. His final film, The Old Man & His Gun in which he stars with Sissy Spacek and Casey Affleck and plays a real-life career criminal and escape artist was released in September to rave reviews.\n\nFor decades, Redford’s permanent residence has been in Utah, home of his Sundance Institute. He and his artist wife, Sibylle Szaggars, also own a Napa Valley wine-country retreat where they enjoy hobbies and hosting family and friends. The Redfords have enjoyed the home for 14 years and have now decided to move back to the Bay Area near family and put their beloved Napa home on the market. It is priced at $7.5 million.\n\nRobert Redford is one of the few actors who started his career near the top in television, Broadway and then breaking through to the top of the movie-star chain as the wise-cracking cowboy in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. With every film he made, the awards grew larger and more important, continuing to mushroom with the addition of directing and producing. Redford’s long list of money-making and critically acclaimed films rank with the best in Hollywood history: Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, The Sting, The Electric Horseman, Ordinary People, Out of Africa, The Way We Were and A River Runs Through It.\n\nRedford’s other passion in addition to working for his ecological interests, was to help advance new artists in the film industry and creative arts. After filming Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and Downhill Racer, he put all his proceeds from the two films into buying an entire ski area near Provost, Utah where he started the Sundance Institute. Using the name from the film, he formed related non-profit businesses under its umbrella such as the Sundance Film Festival, the Sundance cable channel, Sundance catalog and others as outlets for new filmmakers and artists. The first of its kind, it now draws artists worldwide. In addition to receiving the highest film industry awards, top international awards and multiple honorary degrees, he has been recognized with the Kennedy Center Honors and the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\n\nThe charming Napa getaway, named Danza del Sol, lies perched on a knoll on 10 ultra-private acres surrounded by woods and vegetation with walking trails. The compound includes the main house, a 90-square-foot artist studio/guest house and two large garages. The 5,200-square-foot main house is modest by film mogul standards with three bedrooms, four bathrooms, a large great room, den, library-office, sunny white kitchen and formal dining room. Multiple wood-burning fireplaces exist throughout the home. The quaint studio/guest house has a huge open space filled with light from a wall of French doors and double garage doors that rise high into the vaulted ceiling. One of the two garages houses a large workshop and exercise studio. Terraces by the pool, spa and outdoor dining areas offer calming views and are perfect for entertaining.\n\nThe Napa Valley estate of Robert Redford is now for sale upon his retirement. Priced at $7.5 million, the listing agent is Steven Mavromihalis of Pacific Union International, San Francisco.\n\nPhoto credit: Open Homes Photography."
