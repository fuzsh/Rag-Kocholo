        "text": "He’s the Sundance Kid. The Natural. Heck, he even helped alter the course of the Marvel Cinematic Universe in Captain America: The Winter Soldier — and he’s an Oscar winner in the bargain. From either side of the camera, Robert Redford has been making movie magic for decades, building an incredible filmography that includes acclaimed dramas (All the President’s Men, All Is Lost), classic blockbusters (The Sting, Three Days of the Condor), and pretty much everything in between, all while adding to his professional legacy by helping expand a little film festival that’s gone on to become one of Hollywood’s preeminent proving grounds for independent releases. For all these reasons and more, it’s never a bad time for a little Redford appreciation, so with that in mind, we’ve rounded up all Robert Redford movies and sorted the bunch by Tomatometer. How many have you seen? Where do your favorites rank?
