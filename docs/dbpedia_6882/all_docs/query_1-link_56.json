        "text": "TOM PUTNAM: Good evening. I'm Tom Putnam, Director of the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum, and on behalf of Heather Campion, CEO of the Kennedy Library Foundation, and all of my Library and Foundation colleagues, I thank you for coming and acknowledge the generous underwriters who make these wonderful Forums possible: lead sponsor Bank of America, represented here tonight by Anne Finucane; Raytheon, represented by Pam Erickson; the Lowell Institute, represented by Bill and Angela Lowell; the Boston Foundation, represented by Mary Jo Meisner; and our media partners, Xfinity, Viacom, the Boston Globe, and WBUR, represented by Charlie Kravetz.\n\nNow, historians often point to the first televised presidential debate between John F. Kennedy and Richard M. Nixon as a turning point not only in the 1960 presidential election, but in the manner in which our national campaigns are waged. And as we watch silent images from that iconic evening, I'm reminded of a visit I made a few years ago to the Nixon Library before it became part of the National Archives and the Presidential Library System. The curators could not avoid Nixon's loss in 1960 in telling their story and the text panel related to this debate read, derisively, that \"The fact that the majority of Americans who watched that night thought Kennedy won, simply proved how, in the televised era, style trumps substance.\" [laughter] Now, with history as our guide, I would gladly put the substantive contributions of John F. Kennedy and the legacy of his words and action against those of Richard Nixon, whose misdeeds indelibly, and perhaps irrevocably, undermined the nation's confidence in itself and its leaders.\n\nNow, it's perhaps because I'm a political junkie that my two favorite Robert Redford films came out of this era. Filmed in 1972, as President Nixon was running for reelection, The Candidate explores in nuanced and satirical ways the role of style and substance, idealism and good looks, independent thinking and poll-driven promises in political campaigns. Let's watch an excerpt from the debate scene with Bill McKay, in what Vincent Canby described at the time as Robert Redford's best performance of his thenburgeoning career, as the fictional son of a former governor of California who agrees to run against the seemingly unbeatable incumbent, in part because he's assured by party leaders that he doesn't have a chance to win.\n\nThe clip begins with the incumbent Senator, Crocker Jarman, who sounds like Ronald Reagan but looks like Warren G. Harding. [laughter]\n\nCrocker Jarman: Because I believe in America. I believe that our greatest moment is yet to come. Thank you.\n\nModerator: Mr. McKay, you now have one minute to sum up.\n\n[silence]\n\nModerator: Mr. McKay?\n\nBill McKay: In the begin… I think it's important to note what subjects we haven't discussed. We completely ignored the fact that this is a society divided by fear, hatred and violence. And until we talk about just what this society really is, then I don't know how we're going to change it. For example, we haven't discussed the rot that destroys our cities. We have all the resources we need to check it and we don't use them. And we haven't discussed why not. We haven't discussed race in this country. We haven't discussed poverty. In short, we haven't discussed any of the sicknesses that may yet send this country up in flames. And we better do it. We better get it out in the open and confront it. Before it's too late.\n\n[simultaneous conversation]\n\nCrocker Jarman: I never dreamed that my opponent would stoop to encouraging violence.\n\nBill McKay: I beg your pardon, Senator?\n\nCrocker Jarman: I very seriously doubt that any man who could do that is capable…\n\nBill McKay: That's not what I said.\n\nModerator: Gentlemen. [simultaneous conversation] This has been the Jarman/McKay debate that you've been watching tonight.\n\nTOM PUTNAM: Now, Mr. Redford tells the story that to promote that film and to underscore the vacuousness of our national politics, the producers organized a whistlestop campaign when the movie was first released to see if he, as a film idol, could attract larger audiences than the actual presidential contenders running that year. They would research where Senators Muskie and McGovern were speaking and organize their own event in the same city on the very same day. Arriving at the depot station where a large group had gathered, Mr. Redford would then emerge from the back of the train, flash the V-for-victory sign, and proceed to tell the crowd, \"I have absolutely nothing to say.\" [laughter]\n\nNow, the most famous quote from the movie The Candidate comes from the final scene in which Bill McKay learns on election night that he's pulled off the unthinkable and must transition now from erstwhile candidate to United States Senator. As he faces crowds of jubilant supporters and querulous journalists, McKay asks a trusted advisor, \"What do we do now?\"\n\nOne imagines this is a question that Robert Redford asked himself many years ago after becoming one of our nation's most successful and recognized actors with films such as Barefoot in the Park, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, The Sting, and The Way We Were.\n\nIn a recent interview, in fact with Maureen Dowd, he noted that the constant references early in his career to his looks made him feel as if he were in a cage. Yet, through his substantive work and steadfast advocacy of the issues he cares about – the environment, Native American rights, LGBT issues and the arts – he sprung loose from those preconceptions and proven himself to be far more than a versatile and good-looking actor.\n\nHe's been honored by the Kennedy Center and with an Academy Award for Lifetime Achievement for his work as an actor, director, producer, and as the founder of the Sundance Film Festival, where he's created a platform that allows other artists to take risks and has helped to foster the freedom of artistic expression.\n\nUndermining all of his work is his thoughtful understanding of this country and its people, exemplified for me by his work as actor and producer in my second-favorite Redford film, All the President's Men, which perhaps more than any other medium helped the nation understand the Watergate scandal, emphasizing the strengths and vulnerabilities of our political system, and the key role journalists play in our national life as, in Mr. Redford's words, our one avenue to the truth.\n\nMr. Redford, you honor us here today with your presence, which allows us to thank you and pay tribute to your work and the causes you have championed. [applause]\n\nSpeaking of the key role of the press, no one fulfills those responsibilities more brilliantly than our moderator Maureen Dowd, the Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist for the New York Times. Ms. Dowd recently wrote a fascinating portrait of Robert Redford, featured in the Times art section on the release of his film, All is Lost.\n\nIt's a credit, one supposes, to Mr. Redford's courage to agree to these interviews with Ms. Dowd, who's been described as the flame-haired flamethrower [laughter], whose most recent book is titled, Are Men Necessary? [laughter] And whose columns can at times be eviscerating. She once described Al Gore as being so feminized and ecologically correct that he was \"practically lactating.\" [laughter]\n\nI can think of no two individuals who, in their respective professions, better personify the blending of substance with style. Ladies and gentlemen, please join me in welcoming Maureen Dowd and Robert Redford to the Kennedy Library. [applause]\n\nROBERT REDFORD: He didn't mention that Mike Barnicle was in my film.\n\nMAUREEN DOWD: Oh, yeah. Barnicle's going to ask a question about that later, how good he was.\n\nROBERT REDFORD: That was the end of his film career. [laughter]\n\nMAUREEN DOWD: We should have had a clip with you, Mike. Can you guys hear me? Okay, let's get to it.\n\nMr. Redford, as your favorite poet Yeats says, the center isn't holding, the world is falling apart. So I wanted to start with a serious question about global affairs. You said when you were a starving art student in France, the girls you met did not find you attractive. You said you got kicked in the teeth by Paris, because you knew nothing about the Suez Canal and American politics. Still, you were wearing a black beret and a stripy French sailor tee shirt, so what was wrong with French girls? [laughter]\n\nROBERT REDFORD: Well, I think they obviously saw through my outfit. [laughter] That was a pretty embarrassing time.\n\nMAUREEN DOWD: You said that was the hardest time of your life, right? Not about the girls, but about…\n\nROBERT REDFORD: No, this is the hardest time of my life. [laughter] No, it was a tough time, but it was a time I was looking forward to having. I wanted to have a hard time at that point in my life. I felt that's how I was going to learn.\n\nMAUREEN DOWD: You were a bohemian starving artist.\n\nROBERT REDFORD: Not quite. Close, but not completely.\n\nMAUREEN DOWD: I'm curious, have you ever seen The Candidate because I know that you don't watch a lot of your movies.\n\nROBERT REDFORD: That's true. I haven't seen it since it came out, no.\n\nMAUREEN DOWD: Because a couple of Christmases ago, your grandson wanted to see The Sting and that was the first time you ever saw it?\n\nROBERT REDFORD: Yeah. I can't explain why this is, but I've just never been comfortable… First of all, I'm not comfortable seeing myself on film, so I just made it a practice some time ago just not to. Once you finish a film, you move on and don't linger around it, don't celebrate it too much. If somebody else wants to celebrate it, that's great. But you should move on and not get stuck in any one spot along the road. As a result, there are a lot of films that I just didn't see. And it's hard to explain, but that's the way it is.\n\nSo my grandson, we were at our house in Utah at Sundance. It was Christmastime and my daughter -- his mother -- said, \"Dad, why don't you go down and get some movies. Get an old movie.\" [laughter] So I said okay. We went down and there were two categories; there were regular films and old films. So we're going through it and I see that The Sting is in old films. I was like, wow, that's interesting. I said, \"I guess you've seen that one.\" And he said no. I said, \"You haven't? You've never seen that film,\" and he says, \"No, you have.\" And I said, \"No, I haven't either.\" [laughter] So we took it and we went home and watched it, and I thought it was a really good film. [laughter/applause]\n\nMAUREEN DOWD: In The Candidate, you played a handsome, charismatic young man who jumped into a political race at a high level and then realized he was in over his head, famously asking at the end, \"What do we do now?\" Does that remind you of anyone? Anyone maybe in the Oval Office? [laughter]\n\nROBERT REDFORD: There's a lot to choose from. Let me tell you a story, if you have a minute…\n\nMAUREEN DOWD: Sure. [laughter]\n\nROBERT REDFORD: … about how that came about, because it's sort of an interesting story. When I'd made that film, it was a very low budget film. The studio, nobody was interested in it because they felt that politics was not box office and all that. But I really wanted to make this film, so they said, \"If you do a larger film for us, we'll let you make the smaller film as long as it's for a low budget.\" That was 1970 and the point that I wanted to make from how I could see things at that point, was that we were no longer -- if we ever were -- we were no longer electing people in terms of substance, but cosmetics; how they looked as opposed to… I think Dan Quayle was the issue at that time. So it was how somebody looked or how they appeared to be, rather than who they really were or what they really stood for. So I wanted to make kind of a dark, humorous film, sort of cynical, that cosmetics was overpowering substance and that I would be the character; I would sacrifice myself to that character as somebody really not qualified, but because of the way I looked, the handlers felt that they could propel me to the top.\n\nWhen I was working on the project, on the script, the only thing I knew is how the film should end. I didn't know how we were going to lead up to it, other than the fact that I was an unqualified person and that it should end with a question, which is, \"What do we do now,\" meaning I'm totally, completely unprepared for the office I just won. And I decided then, I think, that it was meant to be a trilogy of three films – athletic, politics and business. Downhill Racer was the sports one and Candidate was the political one. I never got to the business one. But I wanted to end it with a question – how did we get to this place? What kind of a pyrrhic… It's a pyrrhic victory. How did this happen?\n\nNow, when I was promoting the film, we went on this whistle-stop, as he was saying, went on this whistle-stop train ride that the candidates would take every four years. That year it was Muskie and Scoop Jackson and Lindsay. They were all making this whistlestop train ride. So this guy who was sort of a prankster, Dick Tuck, had this idea, \"Why don't you duplicate what they did to make a point of your film, that you're really not qualified and you'll get at the end of this train, see if you can outdraw them, see if you can draw more people than they did and that you stand for nothing.\" I said that sounds like a great idea. So as we started to do it, I would go out and there'd maybe be 2000, 2500 people there, and I'd have stats that would say, \"Hello, everybody, Muskie came, 250 people; Scoop Jackson, 50. It looks to me like there are thousands here today. I just want to thank you and tell you that I have absolutely nothing to say.\" [laughter] So that was the point we were trying to make with the film.\n\nAfter a couple of those stops, I started to feel horrible. I just didn't feel good doing this. And in between, there was entertainment press and political press. The political press was gossiping about the break-in at Larry O'Brien's headquarters that had just been two weeks earlier. And I said, \"Oh, hey, what happened with that? Were those burglars? Were those guys Cuban burglars? What was going on?\" That kind of went up and went away real fast. And they had this kind of attitude between them that suggested there was a lot more to it than anybody knew, or certainly that I knew. I could pick up the vibe and I said, \"Wait a minute, what's going on?\" They said, \"No, it's not burglars. It's not that.\" And the implication was that it went to the White House, but that was implied; it was not said.\n\nI said, \"Wait a minute, you mean you think there's more to it? What are you guys doing?\" And I kind of said, \"Why are you watching me make a fool out of myself here? Why don't you work on that?\" And they said, \"You don't understand how it works. First of all, you have to have a long time to get a story like that. You have to have support of the publisher to get a story like that. It costs money, it costs time, and secondly, Nixon's going to win in a landslide and nobody wants to be on the wrong side of this guy when he comes in because he's got a switchblade mentality. And he has a team behind him that nobody wants to mess with. He will be vindictive, so nobody wants to go in the wrong way. Secondly, no one's going to be paying attention because the only thing they're going to be interested in is whether Hank Aaron's going to break Babe Ruth's home run record.\"\n\nI kind of got depressed by that. And I thought, “Well, that's really sad if that's true.” So then what happened was I assumed they were going to be right and then suddenly these little blurbs started to appear, and they were Woodward and Bernstein. It was a dual byline. I said, “Wow, somebody's going something.”\n\nTo make a long story short, it turned out that they were at that point just about the only people doing something. And they went very high, and then it was proven that they had made a big mistake. When I read the article about the mistake they had made in the profile of the two guys, I said, “Wow, one guy's a Jew, the other guy's a WASP. One guy's a Republican, the other guy's a liberal. One guy's a good writer, the other guy's not so good. They don't really like each other, but they have to work together. Well, that's interesting, I would like to make that movie about how they work together with those differences?”\n\nI don't think the film should be interested in where it's going to go, because history will take care of that. Nixon does not interest me. He was my governor when I was a kid in California. I knew enough about him not to care much about him.\n\nMAUREEN DOWD: He gave you a sports award, right?\n\nROBERT REDFORD: Yeah, he did. So I had a very negative impression of him based on him presenting me with an award. [laughter]\n\nMAUREEN DOWD: What was that?\n\nROBERT REDFORD: I was about 13. It was a time called Boys Week. They had a celebration of about four years of Boys Week and they gave honors. This was in Santa Monica, California. He was the Governor of California, or the Senator from California. Earl Warren was the Governor. I didn't know who anybody was. I didn't know who he was. I didn't know who any politician was. I didn't care. I just wanted to get my ribbon. So you would march across the stage along with other kids, and they'd hand out the ribbons. When I went up and Nixon handed me the ribbon and shook my hand, I got just a bad vibe. [laughter] But that's all; I didn't know anything more than to say, “Ooh.” And that stuck with me.\n\nMAUREEN DOWD: That's so funny. It's kind of the opposite of Bill Clinton and JFK in Boys Nation, where it was a good vibe.\n\nWell, when we talked about this, you said that you were no longer as interested in… Like, you dug into that and shaped it and that you were no longer as interested in sparking off current events like that because you couldn't match reality, that it's so crazy now that you didn't think…\n\nROBERT REDFORD: Yeah, I think so. When we made The Candidate, I felt there was still some space that you could fill in about things people didn't know behind the scenes. Now everybody knows everything; there's really nothing to say that hasn't been said or isn't being said on a daily basis by multiple voices out there. No, I don't see any point.\n\nMAUREEN DOWD: Either they know everything or they know nothing; I haven't decided which. When we talked last year, you said you felt sad about being disappointed in President Obama, because he's a very good person with a fine mind and can speak beautifully. But you said he was in over his head. America was so excited six years ago.\n\nWhat do you think happened?\n\nROBERT REDFORD: Well, this is speculation from an amateur, because I do think he's a good man and I think he's got a good mind. I think he stepped into a role that he was going to end up being over his head in terms of how the world works in Washington, how the Beltway works. If you don't know how it works, then you're probably going to run into some trouble.\n\nI remember when I was doing the film, I was talking to the editors of the Washington Post and one of the editors said, \"One thing you've got to learn about Washington is it's not about the why, it's about the how.\" That stuck with me.\n\nAnd when he came in, I think he was very much going to be about the reason behind things and so forth. Once he ran into the stalemate that he ran into -- and I felt at that time that the dual-party system was such a disaster because they were not working together -- and that one side, as it was clearly expressed by Mitch McConnell, which I was stunned that there could be a leader in any country, in any state in this country that could say something like this, but he said, \"As Minority Leader, I think my whole job is to make sure that this man does not succeed at anything.\" I thought, “Wow, have we come to that? Who is this guy, McConnell? Who is he representing? What kind of America does he represent?” But I didn't dream that he would be so accurate about it, that Obama would come up against such a wall of resistance to just about everything he did. So it really made me sad about my country and the political system that's supposed to be representing our interests and yet they were so self-interested. I got depressed about that. Then I felt sad about a man -- who probably had good intentions -- that got into a situation where he was over his head and nothing was going to work. No matter how he tried, it just wasn't going to work. It took him a long time to figure that out -- took him too long to figure that out. In the meantime, I think we as a country suffered.\n\nMAUREEN DOWD: In your 2007 movie, Lions for Lambs, you took aim at the US's haphazard, haywire prosecution of the wars in the Middle East. When you watched President Obama last week make the argument for a preemptive strike in Iraq against ISIS/ISIL/IS, or whatever they're called, do you think there's been a sufficient debate in the country about whether they're a threat and whether we should take military action against them?\n\nROBERT REDFORD: I don't know. I don't probably know enough about that situation. I think the damage started during the prior administration getting into a war we shouldn't have gone into. I think a decision to go there was made by people that were not qualified to make those decisions. And look what it did? It put us into a hole that's really hard to come out of. I don't know if anybody could come out of it. So there's that. He inherited a pretty rotten deal, with a lot of cost that makes me just sad. I don't know that anybody could have fully survived that without having to work their way up and through. And in the meantime, he comes against a Congress that won't work with him.\n\nI'll tell you one thing that made me sad. Recently, I was asked by Discovery Channel, \"Would you do a Watergate Revisited?\" My first thought was, no, that's done, that was at that time. That's a moment in time that's gone. Maybe look at it like a museum piece, because I don't think that condition exists anymore. I'd rather not go there. So I said no, and they were pushing and pushing and finally I thought,”Wait a minute, maybe it's worth doing if you do a revisit of that time.” Because there's all this archival footage of Nixon in the Oval Office with the tapes. There's all that archival footage of the committee, the investigating committee, John Dean, all those guys. I thought, “Well, maybe if you make this, it will allow the public to look back and see how things were at that time and how they are now, and they can make their own comparison.”\n\nSo we did and we got all this great footage, and there's this moment when John Dean was testifying before this committee that was very bipartisan. You had Baker, who was from Tennessee, who was a Senator. You and Sam Ervin, who was the head of the thing, a Democrat. You had Republicans and Democrats. And I looked at it and said, “Wow, look at this. You have both sides of the aisle on a committee working together to get to the truth.” And I saw that and I said, “So it did happen once. There was a time when Congress played the role it was supposed to play for our benefit.” And look what's happened.\n\nMAUREEN DOWD: In this, Bill McKay of The Candidate would be a heavyweight in this climate. You call the Ted Cruz wing of the Republican Party \"Looney Tunes without the Merrie Melodies [laughter], easing themselves over a cliff while totally believing in what they're doing.\" Marco Rubio and other Republicans have gone from saying they don't believe in climate change to their new mantra, saying, \"Well, I'm not a scientist.\n\nThe scientists need to figure that out.\" Is this sort of cop-out sustainable?\n\nROBERT REDFORD: I think Rubio should probably get a seaside cottage. [laughter]\n\nHe should live what is going on. Look, I don't want to argue with people that don't get it. There's no point, they just don't get it. Or they don't want to get it. So you have to let those people just sort of talk themselves into a hole and maybe at some point will see that it's a hole.\n\nMAUREEN DOWD: If the Republicans take the Senate, which is looking more likely, Mitch McConnell, your friend, has a good chance of being the Majority Leader. His whole campaign is being run on defending the coal industry from what he calls the Obama war on coal. What does that mean for climate change?\n\nROBERT REDFORD: Well, it doesn't bode well for climate change. I have issues with McConnell on a number of fronts, but I would not go into a Senator's state and argue on issues that belong to the state. That's a coal state and he represents coal. So in a way you can say that Mitch McConnell is representing the interests of that state. It may be interests that I don't agree with because I think that global warming is on us, and I think we have to take a different approach. But I wouldn't go there, because that is not my business. But the way he treats people, the way he's behaved on other fronts is my business, and that I think is a good reason that he should not be there.\n\nMAUREEN DOWD: The Times had a story on the Administration giving up on the idea of getting a global climate change treaty through Congress, that they're now trying to sidestep that by using a loophole on a '92 treaty to compel nations to cut their fossil fuel emissions. Is that the way to go, do you think?\n\nROBERT REDFORD: Cut their fuel emissions?\n\nMAUREEN DOWD: That they're going to try and administratively deal with it. They've kind of given up on…\n\nROBERT REDFORD: I don't know. I think if you wait for the Administration, if you wait for government action, it may be kind of late.\n\nMAUREEN DOWD: The chairman of Nestle Corporation, Peter Brabeck, said recently that drought and water scarcity is more urgent than global warming. It's like the world has turned into Chinatown with scary scenarios of a world without water, and droughts, and green goo in the water in Ohio, and drying aquifers that are hurting places all over the world. Why is it so hard to break through on climate change, even after events like Hurricane Sandy where people are not going to believe it until their own home is under water or until the water is gone?\n\nROBERT REDFORD: This is incredible.\n\nMAUREEN DOWD: I know it.\n\nROBERT REDFORD: You don't need a teleprompter, that's really good. [laughter]\n\nFirst of all, the idea of drought, obviously I tend to take that a little personally because I grew up in California. And now the whole western part of the United States is in drought way too long and the consequences are already being felt. I think they're connected. I think that the drought is connected to global warming. I think the climate change, the changes that are occurring, are such that there's a lot of areas being affected that don't quite understand how and why they're being affected, but I do believe that fundamentally it's tied to change.\n\nAnd this is a theory, it might be kind of weird, but I remember about five, six years ago – do you remember when they had that incredible tsunami off of Sri Lanka, or someplace like that, that went down to the core of the earth? Remember that? I remember reading at the time, when there were all these tsunamis that went out of there and went clear across the world – it went into Alaska, it went into South America – waves that came out of that. Because it had gone so deep; it had gone down to the very core of the earth. And I remember reading at that time that the world was on an axis and we're slightly tilted, and this thing tilted it slightly more, so we were vibrating. I remember reading that article, Scientific American or a newspaper, but they said that we had just been moved off the axis by, like, 100th of an inch or something. But that movement took us off the axis that we had been on for, how long?, and that there was a slight vibration occurring. That vibration was likely just to continue, and it might be felt or it might not be felt. I always wondered, because of the earthquakes in Chile and just various things that have happened over time, I wonder if there was any relationship. I'm just curious.\n\nI don't expect you to answer that. [laughter]\n\nMAUREEN DOWD: Kit Seelye, who is our Boston reporter here, is going to answer that; she's going to write about it.\n\nMatt Damon did a fracking movie that was a flop, basically, and it was hard for your Iraq movie to break through. But other movies, like China Syndrome and All the President's Men and The Candidate, made serious points while being enormously entertaining. How can you calibrate making a movie with a serious point while you please the popcorneaters?\n\nROBERT REDFORD: Well, I think I failed at that. I feel that it's the entertainment industry and you're there to entertain, and that's your chief obligation. But it would be nice if you could also inform at the same time. I think the public does not want to be lectured. I think the public does not want to go to a theater and have propaganda spilled on their heads. But I do think you might, if you created a story – because I think story is everything, I think it's all about story in my mind -- that if you tell a good story and you have humor or you have something that's frightening, whatever, it's entertaining first, but it also informs – it shows something new for people to think about, that's what I like to try to do.\n\nMAUREEN DOWD: All the President's Men portrayed what might have been the high point of American political journalism. What do you think about how journalism has evolved since? Everything seems to be top ten lists of corgi butts on BuzzFeed and top 29 cats who forgot how to cat. [laughter] When we talked, you portrayed a lot of the media as barking dogs now. What do you think?\n\nROBERT REDFORD: Barking dogs. It's just noise. I think people talking over each other, self-interest. It's all about personality. There's so much personality on news now. You even have the weather saying it's going to rain– [laughter] you say, “Geez, what happened to just Chet Huntley and Brinkley and those guys?” They just told you the way it was. Cronkite. But now it has to be acted out so that's kind of unfortunate.\n\nThen I think there was something that happened. Kay Fanning was somebody that I had met years ago when she was at the Anchorage Daily News, and she left there to come to Boston to become the head of the Christian Science Monitor. She and I had become friends when she was in Alaska. A good lady. I did some fundraising for her. I remember her calling me in 1988 or 89 and she said, \"Bob, I just want to let you know, I'm going to be resigning.\" I said, \"Why? What's going on?\" She said, \"Well, I'm resigning with two other editors from the Atlanta Constitution\" -- and I think it was Cleveland Plain Dealer, one of those -- \"because our papers have decided that business first.\" I didn't know what she meant by that. She said, “They have decided that the papers should be focusing on business first, whatever's going to make most money and that means certain issues are going to be moved down to the back. And things that were at the back are going to move up – sports, entertainment -- because that attracts attention. It makes more money. And we don't want to live like that, so we're going to resign in protest.\" She said, \"I don't think it's going to do any good, but I feel like I can't be what I want to be in this profession anymore because of that.\" Then they did. I don't know what happened after that, but I remember that hit me hard because it seemed to make sense, that economics was going to be overpowering other parts of things.\n\nMAUREEN DOWD: You were thinking of playing another journalist, Dan Rather, in an upcoming film about his reporting on W and the National Guard service, which was not a great moment in journalism. It may fall through, but how would that have worked?\n\nWould you have dyed your hair black?\n\nROBERT REDFORD: No, I wouldn't have. [laughter] I'm not sure it's going to happen. If it does happen, I'm always interested in characters that have a flaw, and I think that the flaw of Dan Rather is really interesting. I think he, at one time, was on an equal footing with Brokaw and Jennings, and they all kind of vied for attention at that time. I'm a friend of Tom Brokaw's, so I know a little bit about that.\n\nBut I think that there is some resentment about Dan and there were feelings about Dan, and yet Dan was trying to get the truth out there. He was trying to get it out there and push it out there, and sometimes he went the wrong way or stumbled. But I was interested in a man who came from the background he came from, a very poor background in East Texas, and that he strived for something that would put him out there, wanting to do the right thing in the right way. And how did it go wrong when it went wrong, that's what interested me.\n\nNow, I don't know whether that's because Mary Mapes was his producer, and that's to be played by Cate Blanchett. I don't know whether we can go down to Australia and make… They want to make it all in Australia. I don't know that that's going to happen.\n\nMAUREEN DOWD: As long as we're on your hair for a second, your director in All is Lost, JC Chandor, was amazed when you spent two months getting hosed down with water in Mexico in the Titanic tanks and your hair stayed Redford blond. You said some of your own kids didn't believe it wasn't dyed. You had to tell them.\n\nROBERT REDFORD: I have no answer. That's just the way it is. [laughter] Even my kids would say, \"Hey, Dad\"– what?\n\nMAUREEN DOWD: Can't you bottle it?\n\nROBERT REDFORD: Bottle it?\n\nMAUREEN DOWD: Yeah.\n\nROBERT REDFORD: [laughter] I don't know what…\n\nMAUREEN DOWD: What did your kids say?\n\nROBERT REDFORD: My kids said, \"Come on, Dad, don't you think it's about time?\"\n\n[laughter] And I said, \"What are you talking about?\" \"Stop dying your hair.\" And I said, \"I don't dye my hair!\" They said, \"Oh, come on!\" [laughter] I couldn't even convince my own kids, and now they're gray and I'm laughing at them. [laughter]\n\nMAUREEN DOWD: The 2016 campaign has already begun. Gun to your head:\n\nHillary Clinton or Elizabeth Warren?\n\nROBERT REDFORD: Elizabeth Warren. [applause]\n\nMAUREEN DOWD: So that kerfuffle about her…\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Why?\n\nMAUREEN DOWD: Yeah, why? That's a better question than the one I was going to ask.\n\nROBERT REDFORD: Is Hillary here? [laughter]\n\nMAUREEN DOWD: No, she's in Iowa.\n\nROBERT REDFORD: Of course. There's no other reason than that's what I would like to do. I would prefer her. No reason to go into why. I like her because she's fresh and new and has a certain kind of strength I like, and so far has not succumbed to the powers of money and things like that. I think Hillary's great, but I would go with Warren.\n\nMAUREEN DOWD: So the kerfuffle about her Indian ancestry didn't bother you?\n\nROBERT REDFORD: Her what?\n\nMAUREEN DOWD: There was a little kerfuffle about her Indian ancestry.\n\nROBERT REDFORD: Indian?\n\nMAUREEN DOWD: Yeah, that she has Indian…\n\nROBERT REDFORD: You mean East Indian or…[laughter] I don't know about it.\n\nMAUREEN DOWD: American Indian. All right, I'll tell you later. Are you excited about all the fresh faces expected for 2016 – a Clinton, a Bush and a Romney? [laughter]\n\nROBERT REDFORD: No.\n\nMAUREEN DOWD: You know a lot about Mormons, actually, from your time in Utah.\n\nYou were married to a Mormon.\n\nROBERT REDFORD: You're really going to go there, huh? [laughter] What do you want to know?\n\nMAUREEN DOWD: I just wondered if you thought that Mitt Romney should run again.\n\nROBERT REDFORD: No.\n\nMAUREEN DOWD: Do you think that people didn't cotton to Mitt Romney, was his Mormonism a problem or was it just him?\n\nROBERT REDFORD: Just him. [laughter/applause]\n\nMAUREEN DOWD: If you could get rid of the Koch Brothers or Fox News, which would you choose? [laughter]\n\nROBERT REDFORD: I remember hearing once, do you want to die by fire or poison arrow. Take your pick.\n\nMAUREEN DOWD: Are you worried about the effect the Koch Brothers will have on the elections, the coming elections, in terms of climate change?\n\nROBERT REDFORD: I'm worried about Citizens United. I'm worried about the Supreme Court and how it's so imbalanced. And I'm worried about how that plays out on us as the public. I think taking money out of politics would be a very healthy thing. And there they are, with all the money in the world. [applause]\n\nMAUREEN DOWD: You have starred in some amazing sports movies – The Natural and Downhill Racer – and you were a jock yourself in high school. With the recent news of the NFL covering up domestic abuse and steroid use running rampant, Penn State being reinstated after the child abuse scandal, I just wonder if you think sports has changed in this era and plays a different role in American society.\n\nROBERT REDFORD: Yeah, I do. I grew up as a child in a lower working class community in Los Angeles. We were one of the few Anglo families in a Mexican American community. But everything was united because of the war, because of the\n\nSecond World War, and my first memory as a child was the end of the Second World War. So I remember sacrifice -- paper drives and sacrificing and things like that. I remember enjoying it because we were connected. We were all connected for what we believed was a good cause.\n\nThere was also a lot of propaganda at that time. There was a lot of red-white-and-blue talk about we’ve got to do this for the country. I believed it. I believed in the country. I loved my country. So what happened was when the war ended something weird happened and I couldn't figure out what was going on. And that was that we were all friends and suddenly we weren't anymore, and there was a split in my community. It was an ethnic/racial split that I couldn't understand; I was too young. But suddenly my Mexican friends were over there, we were over here.\n\nIt took me maybe 50 years to look back and try to put all that together. But things changed. I think the thing that got me out of a kind of rough neighborhood was sports. One of the themes that I've tried to work in films is the subject of winning, that this is a country that's all about winning. And the reason I felt that was because that's the way I was raised, that winning was everything. And yet, I was told a slogan as a kid when I was playing baseball: Listen, it doesn't matter whether you win or lose, it's how you play the game. That's what's important, and that was drummed into my head and drummed into my head.\n\nYet, what I experienced was just the opposite. What I experienced was winning was everything. So I think that sunk so deep into my psyche that when I became able, years later, to be an artist or to make film, I wanted to tell the truth about my country that wasn't being told. I wanted to say, “Wait a minute, there's a gray zone where reality sits, where winning is a big deal, and why doesn't somebody just admit it, rather than pretend it's otherwise.” I think that was the core of how it all began.\n\nBut for me, baseball and sports was a big part of my life. I wanted to honor that as a filmmaker, and I felt that Malamud's story, The Natural, was just the best story to make that point with. Ted Williams, I was a Boston Red Sox fan my whole life. [applause] Ted Williams was my hero, so I wanted to make a film about how important I thought baseball was, and so I did that.\n\nThat was, to me, just an homage to a sport I loved. And it was at a different time. It was a time in the major leagues. There were no West Coast leagues. You had the Pacific Coast League, but you didn't have major leagues out on the West Coast; it was all in the East. And it was something you looked at the paper, you looked at Sporting News or something like that to see what was going on. It was very exciting. Everything's changed now so much. It hardly bears any resemblance to what I experienced as a kid, what's happened to sports. I think TV is a lot of it. Money, all that, has changed everything so much, it's not as much fun as it used to be for me.\n\nMAUREEN DOWD: Speaking of things that aren't as much fun, I think this was one of the worst movie seasons in years. Why is that? Is the appetite for junk overseas and among young kids destroying Hollywood? And are film festivals like yours the only place guaranteeing that independent movies are getting made?\n\nROBERT REDFORD: Hollywood's a business. And that's what it is. It's always been a business. It may have changed in terms of the leadership, but it's always been a business and it's been made to be a business.\n\nWhat's happened now is that with all the changes that have come with the Internet and so forth, so many changes that have occurred, Hollywood as a place is really just a street, when you get right down to it. It's really about what's going to make money. So the tent pole films, the franchise films, the James Bonds and things like that -- which are all good films, I think they're great -- but they focus on that because they're guaranteed to bring in a certain amount of money.\n\nThe other films, which used to be plentiful in the '40s, '50s, '60s, even into the '70s, they don't take chances anymore because they are not going to bring in enough revenue. So that's left them as outliers. So that's why I felt that independent films should be supported because they're still good films. But the business has changed so drastically and it's still changing. I think it's making a lot of people very nervous. I don't know where it's going to go, but it's changing so drastically, I couldn't tell you where it's going to go.\n\nMAUREEN DOWD: How did Sundance turn out compared to what you envisioned?\n\nI'm sure you didn't envision Paris Hilton coming.\n\nROBERT REDFORD: No. No, I never envisioned Paris Hilton. [laughter] It started out, the idea was, when I got taken with the idea of supporting the idea of independent film, we said we'll have a development lab out at Sundance and new filmmakers who have interesting projects will have a place to come and develop, so that at least their pictures can get made.\n\nAnd once we did that for about six years… In the beginning, it was tricky. We didn't know whether we'd survive. And once that survived and the films were getting made, then we realized there was nowhere to go. The mainstream was not allowing any space for them so they would go on television, and what have you. That led to the idea of a festival, and I thought, “Well, maybe if we have a festival where at least the filmmakers can come and look at each others' work, we could create a community and the community might have some life to it if filmmakers could share each others' work and they could talk amongst each other. And maybe if we have it in an unusual way, other people will come and we can build an audience out of it.”\n\nSo the idea of putting it in Park City, Utah, in Mormon country in the middle of winter was kind of weird. The idea was let's just make it really weird. Put it in the middle of winter and make it hard to get to, and you can ski and you can look at movies. There was no support for it because people didn't believe it could work. I remember we just had one theater in Park City, and we had maybe 25 films and maybe 150, 200 people were wandering around outside. And I would be standing outside the theater trying to get people in. [laughter] Like some guy outside of a strip joint, saying, \"Hey, come on in.\" And people said, \"What are you doing here?\" That's how it started. And it was really exciting because I think when you're working up, it's the climb up, I think, that's really exciting. Those earlier years when we could also promote documentaries, which were getting no traction in the marketplace, we said we'll create a platform for documentaries and say we think they're important and push that up, it was an exciting time. And then when success came, it wasn't as much fun.\n\nMAUREEN DOWD: What's the line you like? It's the trying?\n\nROBERT REDFORD: TS Eliot. It's the trying, the rest is not our business. I just felt that it's exciting when you're pushing up hill against something and you believed in it, and you had people coming to join you. It was an exciting time because you were kind of going up hill. Then when things started to click in, and suddenly they built more and more theaters, and more and more people came, suddenly there's 80,000 people there for ten days, it's great for the festival; I'm very happy for the festival. It just isn't as much fun as it was in the beginning.\n\nMAUREEN DOWD: I never realized until I was reading up on it last year how much you scrambled and sacrificed to try and keep it all afloat, even while it was revolutionizing the film industry. Just last week, or last month, didn't you get socked with some $1.6 million tax bill in New York?\n\nROBERT REDFORD: Yeah, New York.\n\nMAUREEN DOWD: For the Sundance Channel or something?\n\nROBERT REDFORD: Yeah, the Sundance Channel.\n\nMAUREEN DOWD: How are you going to pay that? That's crazy.\n\nROBERT REDFORD: I don't know. I'll probably have to rob something. [laughter] MAUREEN DOWD: Go back to robbing banks. You were in Captain America. Was that fun?\n\nROBERT REDFORD: Yeah, it was fun.\n\nMAUREEN DOWD: It made like some huge amount of money around the world.\n\nROBERT REDFORD: Yeah. That was really fun. [laughter] It was really fun. It was a fun part to play; I liked playing a villain. It was fun.\n\nMAUREEN DOWD: Do you watch TV at all? Do you watch Netflix or any of the news stuff…\n\nROBERT REDFORD: No.\n\nMAUREEN DOWD: … on cable? No. Do you write poetry?\n\nROBERT REDFORD: Yes.\n\nMAUREEN DOWD: Can you recite a bit?\n\nROBERT REDFORD: No. [laughter] Not after you quote Yeats; I mean, are you kidding?\n\nMAUREEN DOWD: You're married to a painter. Do you still paint?\n\nROBERT REDFORD: No, I don't. I draw, I sketch, but I don't have the time to paint like I used to.\n\nMAUREEN DOWD: You gave an amazing performance in All is Lost, and I know you say you're not an awards person, but were you disappointed that you didn't even get an Oscar nomination for that?\n\nROBERT REDFORD: No, I really wasn't.\n\nMAUREEN DOWD: Really?\n\nROBERT REDFORD: I really wasn't.\n\nMAUREEN DOWD: You lost part of your hearing making All is Lost. No regrets about that?\n\nROBERT REDFORD: Yeah! [laughter] No, I'm really happy about that. [laughter] Yeah, that was a consequence.\n\nMAUREEN DOWD: It's a tough one. How did that happen?\n\nROBERT REDFORD: I'm not an awards person. I don't mean that I have disrespect for the awards. I think awards are important to a lot of people. They never have been for me.\n\nAnd so, therefore, that's not… Do they say stop talking?\n\nMAUREEN DOWD: She's giving me notes. No, no, not you.\n\nROBERT REDFORD: I just never have been an awards person. My whole life, I've never really… To me, that's not the issue. It's really the work that's fun. When you do the work and you feel good about it, let it go. And then what comes afterward, all the celebration and stuff, I've never been… I mean, I'll certainly be honored, I'll be flattered, but it's never meant that much. So no, I wasn't disappointed, I really wasn't.\n\nMAUREEN DOWD: You didn't think there was any penalty? I mean, in a way you set up a competing film industry to Hollywood, and you and Paul Newman always kind of stayed away from Hollywood. You didn't think there was any penalty for that, that you weren't sucking up to them?\n\nROBERT REDFORD: I think I probably suffered more than he did, because he didn't completely disown Hollywood. He did a lot of Hollywood movies. He tried to be pretty independent on his own and he tried to do other kinds of movies, but he did Hollywood movies. I did Hollywood movies, and I love the films that I made in the '70s. It's the fact that Hollywood ceased to make those kinds of films anymore, and they were going in a different direction, and that direction I didn't feel the projects were that exciting. But Paul and I shared a lot in common. But he did a lot of Hollywood. He was there back in the '50s, so he did a lot.\n\nMAUREEN DOWD: Did you ever see the Baz Luhrmann Gatsby with the Jay-Z rap score? You told me 3D Gatsby might be fun, to see Gatsby throw all his pink shirts right off the screen into the audience.\n\nROBERT REDFORD: I didn't see it.\n\nMAUREEN DOWD: You said that wasn't a favorite performance, because you and Mia Farrow were too controlled or restricted?\n\nROBERT REDFORD: Yeah, that's right. I felt restricted. And yet, that was sort of the point I think that the director wanted to make – that the character -- and I get this -- the character was somewhat restricted by the fact that there was an artificial part to him because he wasn't really who he was. I liked all that; I thought that could have been emphasized even more with some private scenes showing the contrast, showing the real him and the constructed him, rather than just the constructed him.\n\nI didn't see the other.\n\nMAUREEN DOWD: I'm just going to ask you two more quick questions and then we're going to ask questions from the audience. I was curious; I was watching Butch Cassidy the other night and I was curious about the role of music in your movies, because that duh duh duh duh, Butch Cassidy soundtrack set the tone so well. And I saw you in an interview with Barbra Streisand where you said whatever happened, she can't sing in The Way We Were and then you said her song kind of made the movie. And the same thing with Burt Bacharach's song in Butch Cassidy. You hated the idea of it, right? And then you thought it was great when you saw it. Is that weird when music plays such a large role and you don't know how it's all going to come out in the end?\n\nROBERT REDFORD: I was so wrong. When I made the film, it was 1969. I was just lucky to be in the film because there was an age difference between Paul and me, and the studio did not want me in the film because they didn't think I was a large enough name. So I was lucky to be in the film. I guess I must have thought of it as more of a certain kind of film. So when I saw the screening, when I saw the rough cut with George Roy Hill, the director, I said, \"What the hell is that song doing?\" [laughter] What's that about?\n\nRaindrops keep falling?\" [laughter] And it's not even raining? [laughter] This is nuts!\n\nThat's how wrong I was. I had to listen to that song on the radio for six months.\n\nThen in The Way We Were, I said to my friend Sidney Pollack, who I'd worked with before, \"Now, look, Sidney, Barbra's going to be in this and she's going to act. She's not going to be singing.\" He said, \"No, no, no.\" [laughter] And I was wrong, clearly wrong on both fronts.\n\nMAUREEN DOWD: George Clooney and Brad Pitt are fine, but I think that you and Paul Newman have one of the coolest friendships [applause] in Hollywood history. And I know how much he loved playing practical jokes on you. Can you give us, when you think about Paul Newman, what your best story about him is?\n\nROBERT REDFORD: Oh, the car? When I was younger I raced cars in California for about a year-and-a-half. Then I got married when I was very young and that was going to be out. But I still had my love of racing cars, so I always kept racing cars throughout my life. Paul and I were doing Butch Cassidy and I had a Porsche 904. There was only 100 of them made, and we were driving from my house in Sundance down to our location and I asked him if he wanted to drive. At that time, he drove souped-up derby jalopies and things like that; Volkswagens souped up. And when he drove it, he really got taken with it. The next thing I knew he got into and he went to Bondurant's driving school in California, his racing school. Next thing I knew, Paul went into racing and took it very, very seriously.\n\nSo our friendship was always very strong, but I started to get bored, because every time we got together all he talked about was racing and cars. And I said, \"Hey, Paul,\" and he said, \"I got this thing,\" and I'd say, \"Hey, I get it. Let's talk about something\"– he just couldn't stop talking about cars. So for his 50th birthday, we were both living in Connecticut so I decided to play a joke on him. I called a towing service and said, \"Do you have any crushed automobiles? Do you have a Porsche?\" They said, \"It's funny you should mention that. We had a car fall off a track and landed on a Porsche and crushed it, and we have it.\" I said, \"Hold it, I want to wrap that in paper and put a ribbon around it.\" And I called the towing service and said, \"Would you deliver this to Paul Newman's house and put it on his back porch?\" [laughter]\n\nSo I waited and I waited. I called them and asked, \"Did you do it?\" and they said, \"Yeah, we did that.\" I didn't hear anything, I didn't hear anything. And a couple weeks later I went into my rented house in Westport, Connecticut. In the foyer was this big box, big wooden box. And it took me about an hour-and-a-half to crowbar it open. And inside was this big block of metal, just a big square block of metal. I said, “Oh, okay, I know what, okay, I get it.”\n\nSo I then called a friend of mine who was a sculptor and said, \"Look, if I give you a piece of material, could you do a sculpture out of this material?\" She said, \"Well, yeah.\" I said, \"Sort of something like for the garden.\" She said “Yeah.” So I called the towing service and the guy says, \"Hey, what's going on here? This is really great. [laughter] We've got a great thing going here.\" I said, \"Pick this thing up and take it to the friend's house.\" They did. Called them, \"Did you do it?\" \"Yes, we did.\" Then three weeks later she called and said, \"I finished. I think it's quite nice.\" I went over to see it and it was horrible. [laughter] But it was just sort of what I had hoped. [laughter] So I then called the guys back and said, \"Okay, guys, take it back to Newman's place and put it in his garden.\" The guy says, \"Hey, we hope this keeps going on and on.\" [laughter]\n\nAnyway, they took it. I said, \"Did you do that?\" They said, \"Yes, we did.\" And to this day, neither Paul nor I ever spoke about it. [laughter]\n\nMAUREEN DOWD: I had one more before I get to these. Have you ever made a commercial, even in Japan?\n\nROBERT REDFORD: No.\n\nMAUREEN DOWD: Why?\n\nROBERT REDFORD: I don't know.\n\nMAUREEN DOWD: Even George Clooney does Nespresso in Italy.\n\nROBERT REDFORD: I don't know, I just didn't want to do it. Just didn't want to do it.\n\nMAUREEN DOWD: Okay, the first question from the audience is: In the movie All is Lost, few words are spoken. What was it like, given your articulate nature, to not say a word or very few words? What is it, 15 or 30? I had the count on the words; it was like 35 words or something or maybe not that many.\n\nROBERT REDFORD: I don't know. There was just one brief… I liked doing that film for a lot of reasons. It was very low budget. It was a real independent film. I liked the director because we had previewed his film Margin Call at the Sundance. I liked him.\n\nAs an actor, I liked it because it gave me a chance to go back to my roots as an actor. When I first started, I was an actor for hire, and over the years I've been very fortunate to be successful enough that I could increase into directing and producing, and so forth. But I think I began to miss that time when I just an actor and that's all I was, that's all I had to think about and here it was.\n\nSecondly, it was a very pure cinematic experience. Because films had become so adorned with special effects, high technology has played such a big role in filmmaking that now you have all these special effects. They're dazzling. I mean, they're incredible. But I am about story and character and I thought this is striping away everything. There are no voiceovers, there're no special effects. It's just pure – a guy alone on a boat. And if you strip all those things in between, it allows the audience to become closer to you as a character, which I like the challenge of having to be in that man's body. So occupying him at that time was a wonderful experience. It was hard. It was physically hard. I just enjoyed the purity of it.\n\nMAUREEN DOWD: What was the moment where you lost the hearing in your ear?\n\nROBERT REDFORD: At one point we were outside in the ocean. We're inside of these giant tanks Cameron had built for Titanic -- huge, huge tanks, in 20-feet-deep water. They had these machines – they had wind machines, rain machines and wave machines in these big cylinders. And when they all got going, you were in a storm. The waves would get up six, seven feet and the wind would come, and then the rain would come. So it was a real storm. Like that wasn't enough, they had a guy on the side that had a fire hose, and he'd be hitting me with a fire hose. So you're really getting doused and getting hit hard to the point where you can hardly keep your balance. What happened was he was hitting the same side of me in this ear. So every time we had to do another take – there were about six, seven takes – it ended up having an infection and then when the infection cleared away, I had lost partial hearing.\n\nMAUREEN DOWD: That's awful. In terms of the environment, what two or three actions would you recommend to us as individuals?\n\nROBERT REDFORD: Oh, I just think that young people, since it's their future and I think it's going to belong to them, what's left of this planet is going to belong to them. I think we want to give them the reins and let them go forward and support them. I think we have to do it pretty quickly because the contest between industry and preservation has been one-sided for so long, you can see the effects. So much is shrinking of our natural resources. The idea of trying to create balance while there's still time to have balance, what we preserve for survival, what we develop for our survival, if there's going to be any kind of balance, we have to get going, because we've lost a lot. I think young people are the future.\n\nMAUREEN DOWD: And this same person wants to know what are your favorite books?\n\nROBERT REDFORD: I like reading a lot. I like a lot of authors. I've read a lot recently that I like. Smith Henderson’s Bury This, Portes. I like Alice Munroe. I think there are just many authors I like, so I can't just pinpoint one. I just like to read. It's relaxing.\n\nMAUREEN DOWD: I'm not quite sure -- I'm going to have Barnicle do simultaneous translation on this question: Tell us about a Boston Braves player.\n\nROBERT REDFORD: Braves?\n\nMAUREEN DOWD: Is that not what it said?\n\nROBERT REDFORD: Those days are over.\n\nMAUREEN DOWD: Sibby's sister from your movie.\n\nMIKE BARNICLE: Sibby Sisti. He's a slugger. In The Natural.\n\nMAUREEN DOWD: Oh, in The Natural?\n\nMIKE BARNICLE: You didn't need a bat instructor, pure left-handed hitter. Tell them that.\n\nMAUREEN DOWD: Barnicle's saying that Mr. Redford didn't need a bat instructor because he was a pure left-handed hitter. I guess Sibby Sisti was…\n\nROBERT REDFORD: Who's Sibby?\n\nMIKE BARNICLE: Sibby Sisti used to play for the Braves.\n\nROBERT REDFORD: Oh, he played for the Braves. I guess I forgot. I didn't need a…\n\nMIKE BARNICLE: Just go \"huh?\" [laughter]\n\nMAUREEN DOWD: Yeah, he was a natural. He didn't need a bat instructor. What's the next project you are working on?\n\nROBERT REDFORD: A project I just finished from a Bill Bryson book called A Walk in the Woods.\n\nAUDIENCE: Ohh! [laughter]\n\nROBERT REDFORD: Just finished that on the Appalachian Trail. It's a comedy and Nick Nolte and I play the two guys and Emma Thompson plays my wife.\n\nMAUREEN DOWD: And that was going to be Paul originally?\n\nROBERT REDFORD: Yeah. That originally was something. When I read the book, I really laughed out loud and I hadn't done that since I could remember. I was on vacation and I read the book – and I didn't read the book for a while because the cover just had a bear in the woods and I thought, oh, it's another one of those environmental… I keep getting all these environmental and wildlife books -- so I didn't read it because I thought it was one of the books you're supposed to read. [laughter] I took it with me on vacation and when I read it, it was just completely different from what I was expecting. I just laughed out loud, and I don't remember laughing out loud like that.\n\nSo I thought this could be a film for Paul and me because we always had been looking for a third piece to do. But it was hard because we didn't want to duplicate anything. But we also wanted to try to find a project that would still have the relationship they had in the other two. The first film we did, because I was young, I played a more dour character and\n\nPaul was the lively one. And then the next time out on The Sting, he was the cool guy and I was the lively one. So we were looking for a third piece that would be different in terms of story but would have the same kind of character. And I thought this was it. He and I having been friends 30 years ago fell out of touch and came back together again to hike this trail. Neither one was qualified to do it. I went to Paul and he liked it. But it went on and on and on, trying to get a script and we couldn't get a script for a long, long time. It went on and on, and year after year after year, until finally Paul's health began to decline and he then told me, \"I don't know that I can get out there.\" And then when he passed away, that was the end of that. Then it moved on from there.\n\nMAUREEN DOWD: Barbra Streisand told me once you thought about doing a sequel to The Way We Were, The Way We Are or something? No? He didn't think about it. She thought of that.\n\nROBERT REDFORD: They wanted to do it. I still think it's a mistake. You leave certain things along. You did that and it was a wonderful experience. It went a lot better than I ever thought. But it stands on its own. I think when you try to do a sequel, you're trying to milk something that is better left alone. So I said, no, I won't do a sequel.\n\nMAUREEN DOWD: You said you loved working with Barbara Streisand and Jane Fonda and Natalie Wood, you enjoyed your love scenes?\n\nROBERT REDFORD: I did. [laughter] I think we're about out of time [laughter]\n\nMAUREEN DOWD: I have one more question. This audience member wants to know, would you think about writing a memoir?\n\nROBERT REDFORD: No. I feel I'd be more comfortable letting the work that you do stand for you. My personal life, my private life, I'd like to have one. I think that's sort of my business. There's nothing extraordinary about my life anyway. But I think the work that you do, you put it out there for a reason. You want it to be seen and you want it to be appreciated. So I'd rather be known for that rather than anything else. No, I won't do a memoir.\n\nMAUREEN DOWD: Well, I'd like to thank Mr. Redford because unlike his character Hubbell in The Way We Were, who things came easily to, I think he has taken the hard route in a lot of his career and done an amazing number of things in many fields and done it the hard way and not the easy way.\n\nSo thank you for being so generous to talk to us here tonight. [applause]\n\nTHE END"
