Now I would like to receive information from this.\n\nName1 • • • • • Surname1 Name2 • • • • • Surname2\n\nI was thinking about putting a separator after the surname to make it look something like this\n\nName1 • • • • • Surname1 SEPARATOR Name2 • • • • • Surname2 SEPARATOR\n\nI have absolutely no idea how to find the surname using regexp. The only thing that comes to my mind is to find the string '• • • • •' and then put a sperator after the next word (surname)\n\nI'm not looking for a ready-made solution, but hints on how to do it. I will be grateful"
