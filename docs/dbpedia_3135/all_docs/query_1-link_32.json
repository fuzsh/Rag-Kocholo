The limited restitutions which I made following Lady Violet Bonham Carter’s death between the two previous editions, and explained in the introduction to the second, of course remain. For the rest I have discovered and corrected a few factual inaccuracies and righted an old wrong which I did to Paisley, Asquith’s 1920-24 constituency, in the first edition and, alas, failed to correct in the second. My knowledge of the West of Scotland has improved since 1978.\n\nRe-reading the book after nearly nine years, what I am above all struck by is the quality of Asquith’s mind and temperament, and hence of his capacity to lead a government. It was not an adventurous mind which breached new frontiers, but he had knowledge, judgement, insight and tolerance. For at least his first six years as Prime Minister he presided with an easy authority over the most talented Government of this century.\n\nHis reputation today does not stand high. There are a number of reasons for this, some of them valid and some of them not. His replacement in the middle of the Great War inevitably means that he carries the burden of responsibility for our entry into that conflict without the compensation of being the architect of victory. Moreover the Beaverbrook school of modern historians, who, partly because of the vivid writing of their colonel, Lord Beaverbrook himself, and the historical distinction of his adjutant, Mr. A. J. P. Taylor, achieved a remarkable dominance in the twenty years to 1975, have damned Asquith as faithfully as they have promoted Lloyd George.\n\nThen there is his own epistolatory fluency and indiscretion to female correspondents. These letters, particularly but not exclusively those to Venetia Stanley (used by me throughout but now beautifully edited by Michael and Eleanor Brock), are a great bonus for a biographer. They give an exceptional moving picture of his states of mind and judgements of men and events. Nor, taken in the round, do they portray him in a disagreeable or foolish light. His qualities are fully present in his correspondence. Not many other Prime Ministers of this or any other country could write so much so well. Yet inevitably the fact of the letters’ existence (if not their content) leaves in the public mind the impression of a frivolous old man who may have been neglecting his duty.\n\nAsquith probably remained Prime Minister somewhat too long—for 8 years and 241 days, the longest span of this century and for most of the nineteenth century too, although it could be exceeded by the present incumbent by the last day of 1987. It would have been better if he had gone about a year earlier, but not more. The idea that he had become indolently ineffective by 1914, if not before, is nonsense. As late as November, 1915, he gave a brilliant and extremely useful exhibition of the effortless administrator’s art. Kitchener (Margot Asquith’s great poster) had become a focus of indecision at the War Office. Asquith encouraged him to go on a month’s visit to Gallipoli, took over the department himself (he was always attracted by the occasional exercise of such direct responsibility in a way that totally contradicts his reputation for laziness as opposed to the remarkably speedy transaction of public business), and proceeded to lance several boils which had been allowed to fester for months before a rather apprenhensive Kitchener got back. It was Asquith’s last display of an exceptional administrative talent.\n\nHaving given it, he should have retired to the pavilion. It was not so much that Lloyd George was a better war leader. His errors of strategic judgement and his ineffectiveness in dealing with a High Command backed by the King were just as great as those of Asquith. But he had the zest and the brio to believe that he was a much better war leader, and that was half the battle. Moreover, he had been breathing down Asquith’s neck so hard for the preceding months that it was better he should have the responsibility.\n\nWhen I wrote Asquith a quarter of a century ago the degree of identification which is involved in a five-year immersion with a subject made me rather anti-Lloyd George. I no longer feel that simple partisanship. Rather do I think that they were the most remarkable couple of Prime Ministers of roughly the same party (Lloyd George always wore the label a bit loosely) to follow each other for a very long time past. Normally where you have this pattern one is much in danger of appearing as an appendage: Gladstone and Rosebery, Baldwin and Chamberlain, Churchill and Eden, Macmillan and Home, Wilson and Callaghan.\n\nThe longevity of each of them in office makes this impossible with Asquith and Lloyd George. But there is more to it than that. They were both figures of the very front rank. That is what made their rupture so devastating for their party and for the whole pre-1914 political pattern.\n\nIt is Asquith who is today in the shadow. But I think now, more than I did in 1978 if not in 1964, that he stands first amongst the peace-time Prime Ministers of this century. Who could be his rivals? Baldwin? Attlee? Macmillan? None offers a negligible challenge, nor yet a wholly convincing one.\n\nAnyone who doubts Asquith’s quality should read the memorandum on the Constitutional Position of the Sovereign reprinted in this book at the beginning of Appendix B. It was written on holiday in Scotland in the summer of 1913 and without official advice for direct submission to King George V in reply to a rather pathetic cri de coeur from the King complaining that he would be villified by half his subjects whether or not he approved the Irish Home Rule Bill, and almost suggesting that he had an equal choice between the two courses.\n\nI can think of no other Prime Minister of this century who could have written out of the resources of his own mind with equal knowledge, succinctness and authority, treating the King throughout with a firm courtesy untinged with any hint of obsequiousness.\n\nAsquith was a great head of government, and on the threshold of being a great man.\n\nROY JENKINS\n\nEast Hendred, April, 1986\n\nPreface\n\nto the 1978 Edition\n\nIt is thirteen years since I wrote the preface to the first edition of this book. During this a time a great deal of new material about the politics of the Asquith period has been published. I have read most but not all of it. If I were writing my book anew it would no doubt make some difference to my presentation of particular events. But I have not attempted a fresh piece of exegesis. This is partly because I do not intend this to be a new book, and partly because I do not think it is necessary. This does not of course mean that I regard the book as incapable of improvement. But is does mean that nothing which I have since seen has changed my basic view of Asquith or of the most significant events of his career.\n\nIn any event the amount of new material relating directly to Asquith, as opposed to the surrounding politics and figures, has been limited. There has been nothing comparable to the Asquith papers, which have been used previously by his official biographers as well as by me, or to the remarkable collection of letters to Miss Venetia Stanley, which were freshly and completely available to me and which I used in my manuscript to the full exent that I thought appropriate to the proportion and flow of the book. Nothing was left out for reasons of discretion, only of space or relevance. But a great deal of interest remained unused, and Mr. Michael Brock’s forthcoming annotated collection of the letters should be well worthwhile.\n\nIn deference to Lady Violet Bonham Carter (later Lady Asquith of Yarnbury), I made certain excisions from my original text. She did not exactly exercise censorship, although the copyright of the letters lay with Asquith’s heirs and not of course with me. Despite the fact that she had known Miss Stanley well, she was not aware of the existence of the letters until I showed her the completed draft of my book. They were a considerable shock to her. Ideally, no doubt, she would not have wished them to be used at all, but she did not attempt to take up that position. What she did say was that, in certain cases, and particularly in relation to the formation of the First Coalition in May, 1915, my use of them gave an unfair impression of her father’s state of mind and of the effect of the relationship upon his conduct of affairs. We argued a good deal. In the majority of cases she generously gave way to me. In a few I gave way to her.\n\nNow, eight years after her death, I have thought it right in preparing a new edition, to revert to the original manuscript. The reversion is not the reason for the new edition. It would be an insufficient one, for I am afraid that those who have believed that there had been a great suppression of damaging material will be disappointed. I suffered very little at Lady Violet’s hands. She suffered more from me. These restitutions will mostly be found in Chapter XXII.\n\nShe and I also had some dispute about my references to her own mother in Chapters II and IV. Again, even though no question of copyright was here involved, I also made some small changes. For this new edition I have chosen a position about halfway between my original manuscript and what I published in 1964. This is not a compromise. It is because, on reflexion, I think that on some points Lady Violet’s judgement was right and mine was wrong.\n\nI have also used the occasion of the new edition to correct some factual errors, to improve one or two analogies by reference to more recent events, and to remedy some infelicities or obscurities of expression. But it is essentially the book of 1964. At that time I had never myself been in office. Eight years of subsequent ministerial experience have not however greatly changed the spectacles through which I saw Asquith’s governmental activities. I have obviously learned much more about the Whitehall machine. But this has changed so much since Asquith’s day (even more so perhaps in its imprint upon a Prime Minister, who then operated virtually without a staff, than upon a departmental minister) that I do not find the additional knowledge much help in this context.\n\nThe operation of a Cabinet, in its own internal relations, has changed less. So, perhaps surprisingly, has the allocation of a Prime Minister’s time. The House of Commons was about equally demanding, although constituencies much less so. Consultations with colleagues took about the same proportion of time as today, relations with the party machine significantly less. Relations with the public were almost exclusively by making speeches to large public audiences. These were infrequent but required more preparation than a television interview. And without television leading politicians were much less likely to be known by sight, even though their names were rather better known than today. Asquith was always rather surprised at being recognised outside Westminster by those whom he did not know, and he and others were thus able to move about more informally and anonymously. One striking contrast was the lower proportion of a Prime Minister’s time devoted to foreign affairs, substantially in paperwork and overwhelmingly in official travel and meetings with foreign leaders. As the country’s influence has declined the heads of its Government have devoted more and more time to cultivating what remained.\n\nAsquith worked less hard than a modern Prime Minister. But this was due more to his extraordinary speed in the despatch of business, and to a certain detachment, perhaps verging latterly on indolence, than to anything inherent in the epoch. Lloyd George’s pattern was more vigorous—or frenetic. Baldwin and Attlee reverted towards the Asquith mould. Other later Prime Ministers, despite great differences of style and character, have all been more continuously busy than Asquith. They have none of them, I think, presided over a Cabinet of equal distinction and they have none of them remained for so long in the pre-eminent position.\n\nROY JENKINS\n\nEast Hendred, August, 1977\n\nPreface\n\nto the 1964 Edition\n\nThis book, planned in the autumn of 1959, has taken a whole Parliament (and a long one) to complete. In the course of these five years I have accumulated many debts of gratitude. The biggest is to Lady Violet Bonham Carter, who has been consistently helpful. Still more than for her help, however, I am grateful for her tolerance. The book grew into something she did not entirely like, into a view of her father which, while to my mind far from unfavourable, is in some respects equally far from her own. Confronted with this development she did not hesitate to argue with me, and occasionally to register a strong protest. But she did not attempt to force her interpretation on me.\n\nThe book leans heavily on three supports: the collection of Asquith Papers, the ownership of which has recently been transferred from Balliol College to the Bodleian Library; other, mainly published, sources which have become available since the appearance of the official biography by J. A. Spender and Cyril Asquith in 1932; and the letters, hitherto unused, which Asquith wrote to Miss Venetia Stanley (later Mrs. Edwin Montagu) between 1910 and 1915. The unattributed quotations in chapters 17, 21 and 22 are from this last source.\n\nFor facilitating my use of the first source I am grateful to Mr. J. N. Bryson, formerly librarian of Balliol College, and to Mr. D. S. Porter, of the Department of Western Manuscripts at the Bodleian. In connection with the second source I owe a particular debt to Sir Harold Nicolson, of whose incomparable King George V [Constable] I have made extensive use, by quotation and in other ways; to the late Lord Beaverbrook, some of whose views I seek to controvert, but who was unfailingly helpful to me, and to the Beaverbrook Canadian Foundation, for permission to make substantial quotations from both Politicians and the War and Men and Power; to the late Lord Hankey for his highly informative The Supreme Command (Allen & Unwin), from which I have quoted; and to Mr. Wayland Young, who kindly made available to me passages from the diary of his mother, Lady Scott. I am also indebted to many others whose works I have consulted, referred to, and discussed.\n\nFor her part in making the third source available I am grateful to Mrs. Milton Gendel (formerly Miss Judy Montagu), who also provided a photograph of her mother.\n\nOthers who gave particular help included Mrs. C. F. G. Masterman, Sir Alan Lascelles, Mrs. Anthony Henley, Mr. Randolph Churchill and Lady Elliot of Harwood. Mr. Anthony King (Fellow of Magdalen College, Oxford) and Mr. Philip Williams (Fellow of Nuffield College) read the manuscript and made suggestions (most of which were accepted) of great value. My secretary, Mrs. Church, typed the whole book and did much wearing work upon the references. Mr. Mark Bonham Carter combined, with remarkable resilience and finesse, the roles of publisher, grandson, literary executor and general consultant. To all these and to others—for the list is not exhaustive—I am very grateful.\n\nAcknowledgment is also due, and is gladly made, to:\n\nHer Majesty the Queen for permission to quote from certain letters written by or on behalf of King Edward VII and King George V; and to Viscount Knollys where these letters were written by his grandfather;\n\nThe Chartwell Trustees for permission to quote from certain letters of Sir Winston Churchill;\n\nThe Earl of Rosebery for permission to quote an unpublished letter from his father to Asquith;\n\nMessrs. A. D. Peters & Co. for permission to quote from Hilaire Belloc’s Sonnets and Verses (Duckworth);\n\nand Messrs. Eyre & Spottiswoode for permission to quote from Margot Asquith’s Autobiography and More Memoirs.\n\nROY JENKINS\n\nCombe, August, 1964\n\nChapter I\n\nFrom Yorkshire to Balliol\n\n1852-75\n\nHerbert Henry Asquith was born in the small Yorkshire woollen town of Morley on September 12th, 1852. He was the second son of Joseph Dixon Asquith, a minor employer in the woollen trade. Three daughters were born to the family later, two of whom died early. Such a casualty rate amongst children was not unusual at the time, but physical infirmity or ill-fortune was a marked characteristic of the family, affecting all of its members except for Herbert Asquith,¹ who was always notably robust, and his sister Evelyn. Joseph Asquith died suddenly at the age of thirty-five, having twisted an intestine in a game of village cricket. He had enjoyed no intensity of life to set against its early end. I gather from local and family tradition, his second son wrote many years later, that (my father) was a cultivated man, interested in literature and music, of a retiring and unadventurous disposition, and not cut out in the keen competitive atmosphere of the West Riding for a successful business career.a\n\nEmily Asquith, his wife, was a much stronger personality. She was a woman of wide interests, considerable cultivation, and unusual conversational power. She is described as having a biting turn of phrase and humour.b But she spent most of her life lying on a sofa, suffering from a mixture of bronchitis and heart weakness. Despite these afflictions, she survived her husband by twenty-seven years, and both because of this fact and of her other attributes had a far greater influence upon Herbert Asquith than did his father. In particular, she gave him a habit of omnivorous reading.\n\nThe third physically unfortunate member of the family was the elder son, William Willans Asquith. He was only a year older than Herbert, and the two boys, intellectually well-matched, were the closest of companions for much of their early lives. But at the age of sixteen the elder one received a severe kick on the spine during a school game. He was slow to recover and had to leave school. Thereafter Herbert was always ahead of his brother, although William’s intellectual achievements remained considerable. But the growth of his mind was not matched by that of his body. The kick was responsible for his height never increasing beyond 5 feet 1 inch. After leaving Oxford he went to Clifton College, Bristol, as a schoolmaster and remained there for the whole of his active career. He never married, and died in 1918.\n\nThe circumstances of life of this rather frail family were those of modest comfort. Croft House, where the children were born, was a solidly built dwelling of dark Yorkshire stone, with six or seven bedrooms, three or four living-rooms and a good staircase. It had nothing of even the most minor magnate’s residence about it and was in no way set apart from the surrounding community. Yet, in a characteristic West Riding way it was at once half urban and half rural. It commanded a good view looking towards Leeds across the scarred industrial landscape. Both geographically and socially it was a little indeterminate. The mills were at the back door but the countryside was at the front; and it might have been the house of a small manufacturer like Joseph Asquith, or of a school-teacher, or of a nonconformist minister or of a local tradesman who had decided to move half a mile away from his shop. Herbert Asquith’s principal Morley memories were of walking round the town at the head of a procession of children to celebrate the end of the Crimean War in 1856, and of regular, stiffly-attired, Sunday visits to Rehoboth Chapel, the local home of a Congregationalist sect and very much the centre of his parents’ lives.\n\nIn 1858 the Asquiths removed about ten miles north-west to the village of Mirfield. Life here followed much the same pattern as at Morley and the change made little difference to the children. At neither place did Herbert and his brother go to school. They were looked after by a nursery maid and taught by their mother.\n\nAfter two years at Mirfield Joseph Asquith died suddenly. He left little money and the family were henceforth dependent upon their mother’s father, William Willans. Willans was the head of a wool-stapling business in Huddersfield. He came from the same Puritan, petty-bourgeois background as Joseph Asquith, but he was more energetic and, by this time, a good deal more prosperous. He was an important civic figure in Huddersfield, and in 1851 he had narrowly missed election to Parliament as Radical member for the borough. He established the Asquith family in a house a short distance from his own, and undertook the education of the two boys. For a year they were sent as day-boys to Huddersfield College, and then went on to a small mixed boarding school run by the Moravian order² at Fulneck, almost in the suburbs of Leeds.\n\nThis school kept rather oddly timed terms and the two Asquiths arrived there at the beginning of August, 1861 (with no prospect or even a day’s holiday until September), shortly before Herbert’s ninth birthday. From here he began to write his first letters to his mother, and filled them with expressions of rather resigned distaste. We do not like the place at all, he wrote on August 6th, for besides having nothing to do such dreadful smoke comes over from Pudsey that it makes everything quite black. … I do not like either masters or boys.… However, he was sufficiently composed to finish the letter with the dignified ending: With best love to all, believe me ever to remain, Your affte. son H. H. Asquith.c The boys never got to like the school; but the teaching was said to have been quite good.\n\nThe next family unheaval occurred only two years later, when William Willans died. The Huddersfield connection died with him, and Emily Asquith, with her daughter, left Yorkshire for the softer climate of St. Leonards, in Sussex. The two boys went to London to live with their uncle, John Willans, who had taken over responsibility for their education.³ They arrived there in January, 1864, but within a year John Willans and his wife moved back to the north. Herbert Asquith, still only twelve, went with his brother as paying guests, first to a family in Pimlico and then to a dispensary doctor and his wife in Liverpool Road, Islington. That was the end for them, both of a close Yorkshire connection and of any effective home background. They went as day-boys to the City of London School, then in Milk Street off Cheapside. Their lives alternated between the City and, after the move to Islington, a typical mid-Victorian residential dependency of commercial London. It was a physical environment very similar to that which Joseph Chamberlain, born in Broad Street and brought up in Highbury, had experienced ten years earlier.\n\nOnly the physical background was similar, for the City of London School, despite the commercial bent of much of its teaching and of most of its pupils, offered to some the opportunity of a classical education of the highest quality, and this was most eagerly seized upon by Herbert Asquith. The school had been re-founded by the Corporation of London about thirty years previously and had 650 boys by the time Asquith entered. It offered no advantage of surroundings. The buildings were undistinguished and cramped, and there was no playing field. For games—never of much interest to Asquith—the boys went on half-holidays to Victoria Park in Bethnal Green. The number of masters was small and Asquith was at first taught in a class of sixty. But the quality of some of them was enough to make up for this. The most notable, and the one who did most to facilitate Asquith’s academic success, was the new headmaster, Edwin Abbott, who arrived in 1865. He had himself been a boy at the school and had then gone to Cambridge, where he had been Senior Classic in 1861, the year before the pre-eminent Jebb. In Asquith’s own words: He was a Cambridge scholar of the most finished type in days when that type produced some of its most brilliant specimens.d He was also a remarkably gifted teacher, although he himself discounted the view that he had done much for Asquith. His main contribution, he insisted, was to excuse him from handwriting and book-keeping in the fifth form, and from mathematics in the sixth form. There was nothing left but to place before him the opportunities of self-education and self-improvement, Abbott wrote; simply to put the ladder before him, and up he went.e\n\nYet, despite Asquith’s rapid and seemingly effortless progress up this ladder of classical academic attainment, it was not in this field that his most outstanding quality lay. As a classical scholar, his official biographers have perceptively written, (he) was rather strongly and finely competent than freakishly endowed. What his tutors discerned was the application of an extra-ordinarily muscular intelligence to a subject for which it had a marked sympathy rather than the uncanny specialised aptitude of a Jebb or a Murray.f Where his ability was almost unique was in the use from an early age of a resonant, elaborately constructed, yet beautifully balanced and lucid English diction. Dr. Abbott has testified that his speeches in the school debating society exhibited all the gravitas and massive precision which were later to become recognised as the most notable Asquithian oratorical characteristics. The opening sentences of a prize-winning encomium upon the original founder of the City of London School, which he composed and declaimed at the age of seventeen, provide a fair sample of the measured maturity of tone which apparently came naturally to him:\n\nIn acknowledging our obligations to the heroes of the past, he announced, it is always a relief to be able to desert the commonplace of eulogy, and to point to the fabric built upon their self-denying efforts as the best memorial at once of their greatness and of our gratitude. The great man whom we commemorate today, could his spirit hear the tribute of our praise, would I am sure rejoice that we should turn from the obscure details of his career, to dwell in preference upon those after-fruits which have crowned with an honourable immortality the name of John Carpenter.g\n\nAt the end of 1869 Asquith won a Classical Scholarship at Balliol. At that time only two were awarded each year, and as the reputation of the college was already very high it would have been a great achievement for any boy, and was particularly so for one from a relatively unknown school which had never previously gained a Balliol scholarship. He was captain of the school at the time, and was riding confidently and even a little complacently upon a high tide of early success. In his academic work his contempt for what he regarded as inferior disciplines outside the main stream of traditional learning had the paradoxical effect of making him rigidly specialised. A contemporary recorded that he had little interest in any subject except Classics and English, and that he spent his mathematics hours composing Greek verses, his chemistry hours in making irreverent jests and his German hours in diverting the master from the teaching of such an unimportant language.h This being the bent of his mind—and given the fact that he was never intellectually very tolerant—it was an advantage to him that he spent his schooldays in the crowded heart of the capital rather than in some cloistered academic grove. In the latter surroundings he might have grown up a classical pedant with little comprehension of the mid-nineteenth century world around him. In London, generally taking a little stroll in Cheapside after lunch, but (getting) awfully knocked about during it, as he expressed it in a letter to his mother, such detachment was much more difficult. And Asquith’s interest in everything touching the conduct of public affairs was always strong. He went frequently to the House of Commons and heard some of the great parliamentary reform debates of the mid-sixties. He wrote meticulous accounts of them to his mother, and even practised some amateur analysis of the division lists. He went also to meetings of the City Court of Common Council at Guildhall and, more frequently, to the Law Courts. Here his early sense of fastidious discrimination was exercised to the full.\n\n\"I have just returned from the Court of Queen’s Bench where the Lord Chief Justice⁴ is presiding, he wrote to his mother at the age of twelve. One of the Counsel had just made a very agitated address to the jury, and at its conclusion a witness was put into the box whose evidence, being that of an illiterate man on an uninteresting subject, I did not care to hear. The man in question was a foreman or something of that kind of a shipping or dock company. I want to hear the Chief justice sum up, and so I shall go to the Court again on the conclusion of this.\"i\n\nAsquith’s intellectual superiority did nothing to detract from the firmness of his radicalism. He disapproved strongly of Robert Lowe’s position on the franchise; he went to the Crystal Palace to attend a demonstration of welcome to Garibaldi; he spent part of a Founder’s Day holiday attending a Reform League meeting in support of Irish Church disestablishment—having spent the other part of it listening to a lecture on Christianity and progress at the Congregational Union; and he noted with approval that when he heard Archdeacon Wordsworth preach a regular defence of the Irish Church in Westminster Abbey, many of the congregation walked out in the middle. Poor Dean Stanley sitting opposite the pulpit had the pleasure of being cursed in his own Abbey,j he added. The mystical aspects of religion never meant much to Asquith,⁵ but at this stage of his life, and indeed for many years afterwards, he was a great listener to sermons. But so he was to almost any form of oratory. The presentation of ideas, perhaps more than their formulation, constantly exercised his mind.\n\nNevertheless the impact upon Asquith of the London of the ’sixties was not all associated with oratory or the higher arts of government. Walking up Ludgate Hill to school one morning in 1864 he came upon the bodies of five murderers, hanging with white caps over their heads, outside Newgate. Half an hour before they had been publicly executed, and their corpses were still available for inspection. On another, less macabre occasion he inspected, in a Fleet Street booth, the fattest lady in the world. And towards the end of his schooldays he began, with a great sense of daring, to go to plays. Forty-seven years later, after driving past the rather squalid little house in Liverpool Road where he had lodged, he recorded in a letter his memory of this departure:\n\nI remember vividly the guilty sense of adventure with which I slipped out early one evening to pay my first visit to the theatre, and the care which I took to cover my tracks on my return. We had been brought up to regard the theatre as one of the devil’s most damnable haunts; I am sure my mother had never entered one in her life, and her scruples were fully shared by the old Puritan couple—a Dispensary Doctor and his wife—with whom I lodged. I must have been quite 16 when I took the plunge; the play was a now forgotten one of Robertson’s called Dreams,\" and the heroine’s part was taken by Miss Madge Robertson—now Mrs. Kendal—whom I regarded with true moon-calf devotion. Ce n’est que le premier pas qui coûte, and after a time I became an habitual play-goer, i.e. by careful economy I saved up in the course of a fortnight the 2/– needed for a seat in the pit, and in order to secure a place in the front row I have often stood outside the door for one or even two hours.\"k\n\nIn another letter, two days’ later, he reverted to the impression made upon him by Miss Robertson. I believe that Mrs. Kendal … was the first woman I at all idealised, he wrote: she was not really beautiful, but had a most alluring voice, and to a callow novice in the pit seemed almost more than human. But of course she was as remote as a star from one’s daily life.l\n\nThe end of Asquith’s schooldays meant the temporary end of his life in London. The summer of 1870 was the transition period. In July, a few days after the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War, he was delivering his already quoted address at his last City of London Founder’s Day, and receiving all the acclamation due to an unusually successful boy at the pinnacle of his school career. In October, when the French Empire had fallen and German troops had invested a Republican Paris, he went to Oxford.\n\nIt was not only Asquith’s first term as a Balliol undergraduate. It was also Benjamin Jowett’s first term as Master of the college. Jowett, the most famous of Victorian Oxford figures, had been balked of this ambition sixteen years earlier when Dr. Scott had been elected over his head. This defeat was the beginning for Jowett of nearly a decade of chagrin, controversy and bitterness, but it led to no such diminution of energy as had afflicted his almost equally notable contemporary, Mark Pattison, in similar circumstances.⁶ By 1864 Jowett had established his supremacy in Balliol and had far more influence upon the affairs of the college than his rival in the Master’s Lodging. His election (on September 7th, 1870) was such a foregone conclusion that the occasion for it—Scott’s appointment to the Deanery of Rochester—arose directly out of a plot between Gladstone and Robert Lowe the Chancellor of the Exchequer, to make a vacancy for him.\n\nAsquith, who was later to be regarded as the epitome of the Balliol man, therefore arrived at the college at the beginning of its most renowned Mastership. But the conjunction of events was not as significant as it looks. Balliol’s period of distinction began long before Jowett became Master and almost equally long before his influence became predominant. The change from an old foundation with undistinguished buildings and a Scottish connection into a great forcing house of late nineteenth and early twentieth century politicians, administrators, ecclesiastics and men of letters began with Bishop Parsons, who was elected in 1798. It continued apace under the Old Master, Richard Jenkyns, whose reign lasted from 1819 to 1854. This undistinguished High Church Tory, notable principally for his small white pony, was an improbable figure to preside over a great period of reform and rehabilitation, yet somehow or other he allowed it to happen under him.\n\nNo College in Oxford, H. W. C. Davis was able to write of this period several decades later, has parted with the old tradition to the same extent as Balliol.m And he went on to explain that he meant by this that Balliol had anticipated of its own free will most of the reforms which were imposed upon the rest of the University, first by the Royal Commission of 1854, and then by that of 1877. By its attitude to religious tests, to married tutors, to open scholarships, and above all, perhaps, by its eagerness to pull down its old buildings, the college showed its resolute modernity. Its intellectual climate was eclectic, humanist, and a little worldly. It held that men were greater than theories and that action was of more value than contemplation. This approach, as a prelude to the great position which Balliol men were to occupy in the world in the latter part of the century, began to produce outstanding academic results from the ’thirties onwards. Between 1837 and 1896, when there were approximately twenty colleges in the University, Balliol won thirty-four of the sixty Ireland Scholarships—the most coveted classical award.\n\nThe pre-eminence of Balliol therefore began well before Jowett had made his mark. Furthermore, his elevation to the Mastership reduced rather than increased the influence which he might have had upon Asquith. Asquith read his freshman’s essays to him, received his weekly battels in his presence, and met him also at occasional breakfast parties or even upon that great nineteenth century Oxford institution—an intellectual walk. But he was never his pupil. And even if he had been, it is doubtful if Jowett’s influence upon Asquith would have been as great as upon many other young men. In the first place Asquith was never open to much masculine intellectual influence. His mind and his ambitions, from a very early age, were too firmly and securely set for that. And partly for this reason there was probably never great natural sympathy between the two men. Jowett, perhaps with a touch of snobbery, preferred those whose natural talent was in danger of being obscured by a frivolous or fainéant overlay, which he could strip off or at least render innocuous. At a later stage he was more interested in Margot Tennant, Asquith’s second wife, than he ever was in Asquith himself; and he got more satisfaction out of his relations with Lord Lansdowne, who told Miss Tennant, had it not been for him, I would have done little with my life,n than out of those with Asquith. For Asquith needed no one to make him do a great deal with his life. And he expressed his own feelings towards Jowett, at a time when the latter was thought to be dying,⁷ with a notable detachment and coolness:\n\nI am afraid poor old Jowett is dying, he wrote in a private letter of October 26th, 1891. It seems but the other day that my wife and I were staying with him. We had a very pleasant party: not too large and well assorted.… It is already difficult to conceive of the Oxford in which, partly by sympathy and partly by antagonism, he was formed.… Jowett, in his day, did probably more than any other single man to let some fresh air into the exhausted atmosphere of the common rooms, and to widen the intellectual horizon of the place. In my time he was already looked upon, by the more advanced spirits, as an extinct volcano, and even a bit of a reactionary.… He never at any time (I should think) had anything definite to teach.…o\n\nThe Balliol volcano of Asquith’s day who was in no danger of extinction was T. H. Green. This austere, reserved philosopher had come up to Balliol as a Commoner from Rugby in 1858. He had no great gift either of classical scholarship or of lucidity of expression, but after his First in Greats and his election to a fellowship in 1862, and then to a tutorship in 1866, he made his own brand of neo-Hegelian thought the dominant intellectual influence, certainly in Balliol and perhaps in the University as a whole. He had great personal influence and gathered a strong band of disciples around him. Although he worked amicably with the Master his teaching was the beginning of a revolt against Jowett’s method. He had neither the eclecticism nor the intellectual grace of the Master, and he taught his young men what he wanted them to believe. He died young, but his values and outlook, handed down first through his pupil and biographer, R. L. Nettleship, and then through many others, persisted in Balliol at least to the end of the mastership of A. D. Lindsay in 1949.\n\nAsquith was close to Green. He was taught by him, and he approved of his politics (unlike those of Jowett, about which he was often inclined to complain), for Green was both an active and an ardent Liberal, and served for a time as a member of the Oxford City Council. Yet Asquith was never fully under his influence. This was partly again due to his natural resistance to such a process, and partly to his lack of interest in speculative thought. He summed it all up quite neatly fifty years later, expressing at once his respect for Green’s personality and intellect and his own innate distrust of any philosophical schema:\n\nBetween 1870 and 1880 Green was undoubtedly the greatest personal force in the real life of Oxford. For myself, though I owe more than I can say to Green’s gymnastics, both intellectual and moral, I never worshipped at the Temple’s inner shrine. My own opinions on these high matters have never been more than those of an interested amateur, and are of no importance to anyone but myself.p\n\nAsquith’s interested amateurishness, did not apply to his general work at Oxford. From the day when he arrived in Balliol in October, 1870, and established himself in rooms at the top of Staircase IV he worked with a steady and proficient ease which brought results of almost unbroken excellence. He achieved a clear First in Honour Moderations in the spring of 1872 and was proxime accessit for the Hertford Scholarship that same year. In 1873 he was also proxime for the Ireland, with Henry Broadbent, a notable scholar who was later Librarian of Eton, the winner. That in itself would have been a reason more for congratulation than for disappointment, but when he again achieved the same position in the following year, with the margin then so narrow that the examiners took the unusual step of awarding him a special consolation prize, his proxime position looked a little too much of a habit. In the summer term of 1874 he was the only Balliol man to get a First in Greats and he added to this the achievement of being bracketed with Broadbent as the winner of the Craven Scholarship. In the autumn of that year he was elected, with Andrew Bradley, the Shakespearian scholar, to a prize fellowship of Balliol.\n\nAsquith’s academic successes, which were striking without being sensational—a quarter of a century later his eldest son, Raymond, was to repeat them with the addition of the elusive Ireland and an All Souls fellowship—were achieved on the basis of a moderate and controlled amount of work. They were the product neither of erratic genius nor of excessively concentrated plodding. They left him plenty of time for other activities, and even in his last term before Greats he spent several hours a day sailing on the Thames near Godstow, and also went over to Woodstock to speak for St. John Brodrick against Lord Randolph Churchill. But his main occupation outside his work, as might have been foretold from his schoolday interests, was the Oxford Union. He made his maiden speech there early in his first term, and from then onwards he spoke in almost every political debate, mostly putting forward the orthodox advanced Liberal point of view with his own peculiar combination of lucidity, force and precision. Herbert Warren, later President of Magdalen, who knew him well, believed that he spoke as effectively at the Union as he ever did. He occupied most of the important offices of the Society. As Treasurer he was a notable innovator, introducing smoking and the provision of afternoon tea into the Society’s rooms. He justified these new arrangements on the slightly sententious ground that they would encourage undergraduates to do an hour’s daily reading outside their subject, and offered the novels of Trollope as an example of what he regarded as suitable material. In spite of these reforms, he did not succeed easily to the Presidency of the Union. He was defeated at his first attempt, and did not get the chair until the final term of his last year. For most undergraduates this would have been a burden in his Schools term, but Asquith took it all in his stride.\n\nHis social life at Oxford was only moderately active. In his second term his elder brother, retarded by ill-health, joined him at Balliol, and they lived together in a single set of rooms, a most unusual arrangement at the time and one which suggests an attachment to the familiar (and to economy) rather than a great branching out. But he had a fairly wide range of friends and acquaintances both in his own college and outside. In Balliol his main associates were Alfred Milner, Andrew Bradley, Herbert Warren, Charles Gore (later Bishop, first of Birmingham and then of Oxford), A. R. Cluer (later a County Court judge), Thomas Raleigh (later a notable Indian civil servant), and W. P. Ker, Churton Collins and W. H. Mallock (all of whom achieved some distinction as literary critics). Outside the college his principal friends were Herbert Paul of Corpus, who became an outstanding journalist and sat for a short time in the House of Commons as Liberal member for Edinburgh, and Henry Broadbent, already mentioned as a scholar. They were all men of considerable intellectual worth, and some of them, notably Milner, Bradley and Gore, were to achieve positions of commanding influence. But they were in no sense a group of jeunesse dorée. They were not a glittering set within the University, who spread fashions and started legends, as did the young men with whom Raymond Asquith was to mingle a generation later. They provided Asquith with a group of moderately close friends (although with none of them did real intimacy—if it ever existed—persist throughout his life), against which agreeable background he could achieve his university triumphs, but they did not launch him into the world of nineteenth century power or social distinction.\n\nHis first taste of this came immediately after he ceased to be an undergraduate, when he spent the summer and early autumn of 1874 coaching the son of the Earl of Portsmouth, and moving between his two country houses, Hurstbourne Park in Hampshire and Eggesford in Devon. I thus obtained a glimpse of a kind of life which was new to me,q he recorded. At Lord Portsmouth’s he met politicians like Lord Carnarvon, who was then Colonial Secretary, and fashionable men of letters like Lord Houghton.\n\nThis interlude over he returned to Balliol and spent the first year of his fellowship in residence. But he did not continue this habit. He wished to be a lawyer and not a don, because the law was the accepted door, for young men without position, into the world of power and politics. This meant London and not Oxford. For the remaining six years of his fellowship it was merely a small but useful source of income to him. He left Oxford finally at the end of the summer term of 1875, and although he retained for the University a deep and almost romantic attachment, unusual in one whose later life was to be so strikingly successful, he never lived again within the city.\n\nChapter II\n\nA Struggling Barrister\n\n1875-86\n\nAfter leaving Balliol in June, 1875, Asquith spent six weeks as a member of a reading party at St. Andrews. Most of his close Oxford associates were there, and the expedition later came to assume for him the glow of a long-remembered Indian summer to his university life. But it also contained some seeds of the future. It was his first visit to Scotland and it took him, by chance, into the heart of the constituency which he was to represent in the House of Commons for thirty-two years. Around him, during this long vacation, lay the rolling countryside of East Fife and the electors who, with their children, were to be faithful to him throughout the long years of his mounting success—but not afterwards.\n\nEven nearer at hand were the links of the Royal and Ancient St. Andrews Golfing Society, and Asquith there made his first acquaintance with the only non-sedentary game which was ever to arouse his interest. It was a useful acquaintanceship, for although golf was then so little developed that he and his modest-living student companions were able to hire the services of the British open champion to carry their clubs, the game was to become an almost essential accompaniment to Edwardian politics. In the heyday of Asquith’s career, there was hardly a politician of note who did not seek his relaxation (and in some cases attempt to transact a part of his business) upon a golf links. Balfour was at least as addicted to the game as was Asquith himself, and Lloyd George even built himself a house alongside one of the best-known Surrey courses.\n\nThe Scottish holiday over, Asquith went to London and moved into rooms at the imposing address of 90 Mount Street, Mayfair. He had been eating his dinners in Lincoln’s Inn for his last few years at Oxford, and he came to London for nine months’ work in chambers before his call to the bar. He had been accepted as a pupil by Charles Bowen, one of the most distinguished of nineteenth-century legal minds, and he began work with him in the last days of October. Bowen, apart from being the son of a country parson and a Rugbeian, had a similar background to Asquith’s own. He had been a scholar and fellow of Balliol and President of the Union. He had won all the University prizes and was Jowett’s favourite pupil. Unlike Asquith, however, he was a notable athlete with poor health. He once exhibited the former prowess by the curiously unmodern feat of jumping a cow as it stood in a field, and the latter weakness led to frequent periods of long convalescence and an early death before the age of sixty. But by that time he had been successively a puisne judge for three years, a lord justice of appeal for eleven, and a law lord for one. He was also a notable wit, although many of his verses and recorded remarks now seem to suffer from the contrived facetiousness which came only too easily to Victorian classicists in their lighter moments.\n\nWhen he accepted Asquith, Bowen had recently made his reputation in the interminable case of the Tichborne Claimant, and was Junior Counsel to the Treasury, or Attorney-General’s devil. He also had a large general practice, and was at the height of his success as an advocate; three years later, at the age of forty-four, he went straight from the junior bar to the bench. A short period as a pupil therefore gave Asquith a little experience of almost all branches of Common Law work. It also gave him a modified admiration for this perfect example of a Balliol man of the previous generation. His admiration was modified because Bowen’s supremely refined intelligence was not muscular enough for his own taste; and because he was irritated by the latter’s inability to delegate work—a capacity which was always highly developed in Asquith himself—and which resulted in most of the pupils’ drafts being completely re-written by Bowen. Despite this, and despite his removal to another set of chambers immediately after his call to the bar in June, 1876, Asquith remained on terms of close acquaintanceship with Bowen. Sixteen years later, as Home Secretary, he gave the judge his last public appointment.\n\nThe chambers in which Asquith established himself were at 6, Fig Tree Court. The other occupants were two almost equally junior men who had also been pupils of Bowen’s. In these surroundings he spent seven extremely lean years. The tide of success which had flowed strongly from his last years at school to his acceptance in chambers as distinguished as Bowen’s, suddenly ceased to run. He was without legal connections, there was no one in the chambers from whom work might filter down to him, and he had no money of his own. Placed as he was, indeed, the whole venture of going to the bar, rather than remaining at Oxford or seeking some public service employment, was a hazardous gamble. And it was a gamble which brought no early winnings. For at least five years after his call, his professional earnings were negligible. His reaction was not to withdraw disappointedly or even, as might have been expected from Jowett’s view of him as above all a determinedly ambitious young man¹, to meet setback with caution. On the contrary, he doubled his stake. In August, 1877 he got married.\n\nHis wife was Helen Melland, the daughter of a Manchester doctor. Asquith had known her since 1870, when he was eighteen and she only fifteen. They had met at St. Leonards-on-Sea, while Asquith was staying with his mother and she with some neighbouring cousins. Throughout his time at Oxford occasional vacation meetings on the South Coast were supplemented by a growing correspondence. She was Asquith’s first love, and for many years his only one. \"The first real one, he wrote later, after referring to his already mentioned non-real, schoolboy attachment to Madge Robertson, … was Helen who afterwards became my wife. I showed the same constancy which has since been practised by my sons, and waited from about 18 to 25 (hardly ever seeing her in the interval).\"a During 1874 they became secretly engaged, and in the autumn of 1876 Asquith went to Manchester to try to turn this clandestine arrangement into an open one. Dr. Melland, a well-established physician of commanding presence who survived to the age of 98, responded to Asquith’s approach with a combination of courtesy and caution. But two months later he gave his consent by letter. Although I have not had any opportunity of becoming better acquainted with you personally, he wrote, I have been able to make certain enquiries which have satisfied me that I may give my consent to your becoming engaged to my daughter. I have the fullest conviction that your industry and ability will procure for you in due time that success in your profession which has attended you in your past career.b If the standard was to be industry and ability, it would have required a very exacting father-in-law to fault Asquith.\n\nMiss Melland’s position and fortune were not such that there could have been any question of a man with Asquith’s ambitions marrying her for worldly reasons. But she was not so penniless that the change of circumstances meant any reduction in his standard of living. With her income of a few hundred pounds a year, with the money from his Balliol fellowship still continuing, and with chance earnings from lecturing and journalism, which he began increasingly to seek, they were able to move at once into a spacious, white-walled, early nineteenth century house in what was then John Street, and is now Keats Grove, Hampstead. Here, surrounded by a large garden and looking across the street to John Keats’s old house, they lived what Asquith’s official biographers insist was a simple, but agreeable and placid married life.\n\nPlacidity, indeed, was constantly stressed by Asquith himself as the keynote both of his wife’s character and of the satisfaction which he derived from the marriage. This is a recurring theme of his writing about the relationship his wife wanted not only after and during the marriage, but even before it took place. I am more than ever convinced, he wrote to his mother in January, 1877, that H’s health and happiness depend upon a speedy marriage and the chance of a quiet home, where she can be properly looked after and cared for.c But he was equally insistent that a quiet home and a simple unpretentious domesticity was what he, too, required. Yet an element of doubt remains as to whether Asquith, even at this stage in his career, did not secretly hanker after a more tense relationship and a more dramatic way of life. There was always in his character a surprising but strong streak of recklessness. It made him go to the bar instead of seeking a safer occupation. It made him marry before he had an assured income. It was later to make him enter Parliament before he had an established practice. And it made him, in the early ’eighties, when his briefs were still rare, spend nearly £300 (equivalent to at least £9,000 today) on a diamond necklace for his wife. It must, from everything that is known of her character and pattern of life, have been almost the last thing that she wanted.\n\nIn appearance Helen Asquith was tall, brown-haired and very good-looking in a quiet-featured way. The impression which survives of her is of a sweet-natured, unambitious woman. Hers was a beautiful and simple spirit,d Haldane recorded in his autobiography. Her husband wrote: She had one of those personalities which it is almost impossible to depict. The strong colours of the palette seem to be too heavy and garish: it is difficult to paint a figure in the soft grey tints which would best suit her, and yet she was not neutral or negative. Her mind was clear and strong, but it was not cut in facets and did not flash lights, and no one would have called her clever or ‘intellectual’. What gave her her rare quality was her character, which everyone who knew her intimately (Haldane for instance) agrees was the most selfless and unwordly that they have ever encountered. She was warm, impulsive, naturally quick-tempered, and generous almost to a fault.…e\n\nAsquith was right about the difficulties of depiction. The picture he gives is not altogether clear. But there is no doubt that he lived contentedly with her for many years; and the talent of so many of their children was such that she must surely have contributed substantially to the strain.\n\nThe first of these children, Raymond, was born in 1878. Partly on the basis of an effortless academic record which surpassed even that of his father, he left the memory of a figure of almost legendary talent when he was killed in 1916. The second son, Herbert (or Beb as he was known in the family) was born three years later. He followed his father and brother in becoming President of the Union, but not in their quality as classical scholars, although he made a minor reputation as a poet and novelist. The third son, Arthur (or Oc), born in 1883, was the least intellectual of the family. But he achieved distinction as a war-time soldier, reached the rank of Brigadier-General at 31, and was"
