        "text": "6 May 1862. 48 Bryanston Sqre. Before commencing this journal I will shortly sketch my life up to this point. I was born Jany. 7, 1826 in Baker Street. My father died of a cold after an illness of only four days in the spring of 1834. I remember little of him except that he was very kind to me, and that he was fond of cricket & shooting. My mother devoted herself to the education of my brother & me, and I can never repay her affection & care. I married my dearest wife on Aug. 16, 1847, having proposed to her after only ten days acquaintance. The question was put at a breakfast at the Duchess of Bedford's at Camden Hill.\n\n18 Writing more than a decade later, Wodehouse's memory failed him with regard to the Finance Committee, which was at first composed of Wodehouse, Simeon and McGeachy. McGeachy appears to have been inactive, leading to Adderley's ‘appointment’ to the committee. Wodehouse was a member of several other committees, however, and was frequently working with Adderley, Molesworth, Hume and Simeon. Together these members formed the active core of the Society. Detailed minutes of the Society's business can be found in NtP 2735. For the founding prospectus of the CRS, see ‘The Society for the Reform of Colonial Government’, 29 Jan. 1850, KP6 MS. eng.c. 3995, ff. 110–11. See too Childe-Pemberton, William S., Life of Lord Norton, 1814–1905: Statesman & Philanthropist (London, 1909), 75–83.Google Scholar\n\n46 Kimberley, always wary of pretension, enjoyed recounting a similar story regarding Prince Metternich. Late in life, as Metternich prepared for an audience with the King of Denmark, he was unable to find the insignia of the Danish Order of the Elephant. According to Kimberley, ‘Metternich ordered [his valet] at once to buy, borrow, or steal another set. This the one valet did, and Metternich, conspiciously adorned with the insignia of the Order, presented himself before the King. He then, to his dismay, found that His Majesty had summoned him for the purpose of presenting him with the Order of the Elephant, that being one of the very few European Orders which had not already received.’ Reminiscences of Lard Kilbracken (London, 1931), 203Google Scholar. See too Kimberley, to Cardwell, , 23 10 1870Google Scholar, CdP 30/48/31, ff. 77–8, 94; JE, 33.Google Scholar\n\n109 The order for the third reading of the Red Sea and India Telegraph bill was discharged and the bill re-committed. Argyll observed that objections to the bill had been made for giving the sanction of parliament to the new, as well as the old, company. Because of this he proposed that the first three lines of the 1st clause be omitted and new lines inserted. Wodehouse and the Earl of Camperdown, Lord Redesdale, Lord Lyveden and Earl Grey, refused to accept this change until the new text was set out in a clear and intelligible form. As a result the bill was resubmitted to a Committee of the whole House. 3 Hansard 167 (19 06 1862), 728–30.Google Scholar\n\n177 Charlotte, wife of Lionel Rothschild, chief manager of the Rothschild banking house in England. After election to parliament in 1847, and repeatedly thereafter, Baron Rothschild had been denied a seat in parliament for refusing to take the oath, but was finally seated in 1858. One of Wodehouse's earliest speeches in the Lords had been in favour of the Oath of Abjuration Bill. 3 Hansard 118 (17 07 1851), 875–7Google Scholar; Liberal by Principle, 25.Google Scholar\n\n184 Petr Vladmirovich Dolgoroukov (1817–68), genealogist and author. Exiled from Russia for publishing The Truth about Russia (1860)Google Scholar. He eventually settled in England, and asked Wodehouse to recommend a bank. Wodehouse suggested Curries & Co., writing to Bertram Currie that though the Russian exile was ‘clever’ and ‘unscrupulous’, he knew of no reason why Currie should not ‘receive his money’. ‘He lived in the highest Russian society in St. Petersburg when I was there.’ 31 March 1863, CP.\n\n274 Henry Negus Burroughes (1791–1872), Cons. MP for Norfolk E., 1837–57, when he retired. On Wodehouse's role in electing a Liberal to replace Burroughes, see KP1 3/2; Liberal by Principle, 11–12Google Scholar. Cf. The Poll for a Knight of the Shire for the Eastern Division of Norfolk … and an account of the Position of the Parties between the Contests of 1831 find 1858 (Norwich, 1858), ix–xxiiGoogle Scholar, where Wodehouse's potential influence in local politics is suspected, but never traced.\n\n345 On 12 Aug. 1864, Delane had observed in The Times (p. 6) that ‘happily now and then a good man’ was not placed ‘so entirely to his liking as to shirk an untried burden’. The position was first offered to, and refused by, the Duke of Devonshire and Lord Bessborough.\n\n348 Palmerston wrote that it had first been offered to Bessborough ‘as an Irishman’, though Wodehouse was the best Englishman, and would at all events possess an advantage over most Irishmen, of being unconnected with Irish land and party politics. Palmerston, to Wodehouse, , 25 09 1864Google Scholar, KP6 MS.eng.c. 4475, ff. 31–2. On Lady Wodehouse's distress, see Wodehouse, Henry to Wodehouse, Anne, 13 10 1864Google Scholar, KP1 15/K2/20.\n\n374 ‘There is no lesson more necessary than this’, Wodehouse observed from experience, ‘that you should not be discouraged, but persevere, and you may be assured that the reward will come at last … some attain distinction early, while others that have risen but slowly, attain that distinction afterwards.’ KP6 MS.eng.b.2408, f. 13.\n\n436 Patrick McDowell (1799–1870), sculptor and member of the Royal Academy from 1846; sculpted the European group of the Albert Memorial. By May 1855 more than £1,000 had been raised to erect the statue in memory of John Charles Henry Fitzgibbon, Lady Wodehouse's brother, who had been slain at the Battle of Balaclava while serving with the 8th Hussars. The monument was badly damaged by an IRA bomb in 1929, and replaced with a bronze group commemorating Republicans who fought in the war of independence, 1916–22.\n\nOn the controversy surrounding the original placement of the Fitzgibbon monument, see Lenihan, N., Limerick, its History and Antiquities (Cork, 1866), 513.Google Scholar\n\n465 Having watched the Fenians for months, on 1 Sept. Wodehouse informed Russell that he was ‘quite prepared to run some risk of exceeding the law’ if it were necessary to obtain ‘tangible proofs’ of the treasonable activity he was sure was taking place. On developments leading to the arrests of 15 Sept., see Wodehouse, to Russell, , 1 09 1865Google Scholar, R1P 30/22/28, ff. 269–70; Wodehouse, to Grey, , 3 09 1865Google Scholar, copy, PP GC/GR/2577/encl. 2; Wodehouse, to Grey, , 12 09 1865Google Scholar, copy, PP GC/GR/2578, enc. 1; Wodehouse, to Grey, , 16 09 1865Google Scholar, PP GC/GR/2579, enc. 2; Broin, Leon Ó, Fenian Fever, An Anglo-American Dilemma (New York, 1971), 8–29.Google Scholar\n\n466 Presumably involving the scandal which led to the dissolution of Lady Clare's marriage to Maurice Crosbie Moore in 1825, which enabled her to marry the 3rd Earl of Clare. Wodehouse apparently announced his intention to marry by suggestion to his mother that she would find three ‘insuperable objections to her future daughter-in-law; 1st that her mother had run away; 2nd, that her sister had run away; 3rd, that she was an Irishwoman’. Cited in Stirling, A.M. (ed.), The Letter-Bag of Lady Elizabeth Spencer-Stanhope (2 vols., London, 1913), II, 216–17.Google Scholar\n\n473 According to Delane, Wodehouse believed that the Queen ought to have sent for Gladstone rather than Russell, and that the Liberals ‘ought to have a long banishment from office, and only return when the old batch are fairly out of the way’. Dasent, , Life of Delane, II, 150Google Scholar; cf. entries for 18, 24 Oct. 1865.\n\n485 Wodehouse wrote to his mother that the story originated in ‘a silly mistake of the engine driver who mistook a blow from a fallen telegraph post for a shot’, suggesting the tension which then existed in Dublin. Wodehouse, to Wodehouse, Anne, 9 01 1866Google Scholar, KP1 15/K2/18. On the threat of assassination generally, see Wodehouse, to Currie, Raikes, 23 12 1865Google Scholar, in Liberal by Principle, 108Google Scholar; Kimberley, to Clarendon, , 30 04 1866Google Scholar, C1P, C99.\n\n503 Fortescue felt that he could ‘fairly expect’ Wodehouse to take the handsome and friendly course of waiving his objections. Fortescue to Kimberley, 30 May 1866, KP MS.eng.c.4047, ff. 95–9. On the oddly recurring collision of ambitions between the two, see Wodehouse, to Russell, , 21 11 1865Google Scholar, R1P 30/22/15g, f. 112; Wodehouse, to Clarendon, , 5 11 1865Google Scholar, C1P C99; Wodehouse, to Russell, , 12 12 1865Google Scholar, R1P 30/22/15h, ff. 62–3; Kimberley, to Fortescue, , 1 06 1866Google Scholar, KP6, Ms.eng.4048, ff. 8–9; Dasent, , Life of Delene, II, 161Google Scholar; Extracts, Kimberley memoir, herein; CJ, 153–8Google Scholar; Carlingford Journal, CfP 63688.\n\n521 Or to return correspondence. Apologising to Larcom for his sloth, Kimberley maintained that he was ‘too lazy to do anything but walk about in the open air shooting a stray wild duck or looking after my harvest which is much better fun than looking after Fenians’. 2 Aug. 1866, LcP 7694.\n\n677 Cf. the broad expansion in the JE, where Kimberley suspects that Gladstone's vehemence is ‘greatly due to the fear of losing Bright’ if a vigorous course were taken. ‘I made the best fight I could.’ Kimberley wrote, ‘but it is impossible to get the best of Gladstone in argument. His ingenuity in shifting his ground, and in probing every weak point in his adversary's armour render him almost invincible. Unfortunately he is often led astray by his own subtilty, and thus gives exaggerated weight in council to arguments useful perhaps in debate but more plausible than sound. I have heard that Palmerston one day when he had been sorely tried by Gladstone's dialectics said to a friend ‘you remember that anecdote about Pitt when he was asked what was the first quality of a statesman. He answered “patience”: and the second? patience. & the third? patience. But Pitt did not know Gladstone!’\n\n767 Mary Livingston King, of Sandhills, Georgia. In writing prior to the marriage, her father thanked Kimberley for the ‘ready’ confidence with which you welcome an alliance between our families, and promised £400–500 per annum and an inheritance of not less than £10,000. ‘You are aware,’ King added, ‘that our disastrous Civil War left us only the wreck of fortunes once possessed.’ KP6 MS. eng. C. 4470, f. 57. Cf. Henry Wodehouse's letter to his mother saying ‘I am very much in love with a young lady. She has not much money and no particular connection in the way of family.’ 24 April 1872, KP/15/K2/20.\n\n770 Amendment introduced by the Duke of Richmond on 17 June 1872 to allow the voter, if he wished, to mark his ballot paper before the officials in the polling station. On 28 June the Commons rejected the optional ballot amendment. Gladstone learned on 3 July that Richmond intended to persevere with his amendment in the Lords.\n\n869 The Conservatives failed to pass a Judicature bill in 1874, revising Selborne's Judicature Act of 1873, for lack of parliamentary time. In March 1875 Derby noted that nearly all the Conservative peers and half of the Whigs opposed Cairns' Judicature bill and at a cabinet on 6 March 1875 it was decided to drop the measure. DD2, 197–8Google Scholar. On 9 April 1875 a second Judicature bill was introduced which eventually passed.\n\n873 Lord Carnarvon, Disraeli's Colonial Secretary, was pursuing a policy of removing control of native affairs from the settlers in Natal. This was intended to allow the natives to be handled with greater justice, but equally the policy was guaranteed to create disaffection within the colony. Derby thought that although Carnarvon's plans were well meant they did not allow for the strength of colonial opposition. DD2, 207.Google Scholar\n\n883 Count Julius Andrassy was Austrian foreign minister. The Andrassy Note, 30 December 1875, called on Turkey to concede reforms to their subject Serbs so as to avoid a Russian aggression and diplomatic intervention by other European powers. Although Derby, as foreign minister, thought the Note moderate in tone Disraeli instinctively disliked Britain being seen as only a secondary party in the settling of the vexed Eastern Question and favoured an independent British initiative. The Andrassy Note was accepted by Turkey on 3 February 1875. In November 1875 the Conservative cabinet agreed to attempt to buy the majority shares in the Suez Canal being sold by the Khedive rather than let them be acquired by a French company. The £4 million for the purchase was provided by Rothschild.\n\n890 During April 1876 Turkey began a vicious repression of insurrection in Bulgaria. In May 1876 Disraeli's government rejected the Berlin Memorandum outlining Bismarck's plan for pacification in the Balkans. In June Serbia and Montenegro declared war on Turkey. By early July Derby was urging Disraeli to use moderate language, without sensation and swagger, so as to avoid government policy being seen as too pro-Turkish. It was Forster, rather than Gladstone, who was urging Harrington to attack the government over reports of Turkish atrocities against Bulgarian Christians in the Spectator in early June. Not until late July did Gladstone become deeply disturbed over continuing reports of atrocity. See Shannon, R., Gladstone and the Bulgarian Agitation 1876 (London, 1963), 93–5.Google Scholar\n\n897 On 27 April 1877 Gladstone indicated his intention to move five resolutions in the Commons on 7 May declaring the Turkish government to have lost any claim to moral or material support; calling for the British government to seek local liberty and self-government in the disturbed provinces in concert with other European powers: and demanding such changes in the provinces as necessary for humanity and justice. Gladstone described his decision as ‘a severe one, in face of not having a single approver in the Upper official circle’. Gladstone Diaries, IX, 214.Google Scholar\n\n901 On 31 May 1877; at Joseph Chamberlain's invitation, Gladstone spoke in Birmingham at the inaugural meeting of the National Liberal Federation. In his diary Gladstone noted he was given ‘a triumphal reception’ and spoke to ‘a most intelligent orderly appreciative audience’ of 25,000 in the Bingley Hall. Gladstone Diaries, IX, 223Google Scholar. Gladstone commended party organisation, counselled greater unity of action, and ‘went off in my accustomed strain about the Eastern question’. Gladstone to Granville, 1 June 1877 in Gladstone-Granville Corresp. 2, I, 43.Google Scholar\n\n906 The government proposed a vote of credit for increased military expenditure. On learning of Gladstone's intention to oppose the vote of credit Granville responded that Hartington and others would ‘have reason to be surprised, if you now take the lead, and without further consultation, do that which you proved to them to be inexpedient’. Granville to Gladstone, 28 June 1877 in Gladstone-Granville Corresp. 2, I, 47Google Scholar. In the event votes of credit passed on 2 July 1877.\n\n920 Harrington was initially cautious about attacking the government over the war in Afghanistan. Gladstone and many radicals, meanwhile, fiercely denounced government policy. A split, similar to that over the Bulgarian question, threatened. This was averted when in the Commons debate Hartington attacked the government with far greater force than anticipated. See Jenkins, , Gladstone, Whiggery and the Liberal Party, 82.Google Scholar\n\n928 The debate over flogging in the army had, in early July, brought on an attack on Harrington by Chamberlain for lack of vigour in the practice. The immediate effect of Chamberlain's attack, however, was to prompt Liberals to rally round Harrington. Moreover, once it became clear that the government were not prepared to accept a compromise resolution of the issue, flogging being confined to those offences otherwise punishable by death, Harrington himself moved an amendment to abolish flogging: the ‘volte face’ referred to by Kimberley. Again, note Harcourt's prominence as an intermediary. See Jenkins, , Gladstone, Whiggery and the Liberal Party, 94–5.Google Scholar\n\n944 Following Gladstone's return to power the Boers had expected the annexation of 1877 to be reversed, as Gladstone had indicated in his election speeches. When this did not occur the Boers, led by the formidable President Kruger, rebelled and in December 1880 inflicted a quick defeat on the Connaught Rangers. For full details on British policy surrounding the war and its settlement, see Schreuder, Gladstone and Kruger, 60–224.Google Scholar\n\n1002 Gladstone's verdict on the cabinet was ‘very good’. The first item of business was Madagascar and the issue of compensation for the British missionary G.A. Shaw arrested there by the French. The reduction of troops in Egypt to 3,000 men was agreed in cabinet. C.P. Ilbert's Criminal Procedure Amendment bill allowed certain Indians jurisdiction over Europeans. Ripon proposed a compromise bill, which was passed in January 1884. A preliminary discussion of franchise reform also undertaken, the overall feeling of the cabinet in favour of dealing with the question. Gladstone Diaries, XI, 48Google Scholar. On the ‘Ilbert Bill’, see Liberal by Principle, 161–8.Google Scholar\n\n1015 On 18 Jan. 1889, Genl. Charles George Gordon (1833–85), who previously had served in the Sudan, 1873–6, 1877–80, was sent to relieve Egyptian garrisons in the Sudan, leading to widespread debate over the probity of sending English soldiers into territories being threatened by Islamic fundamentalists under the Mahdi. The voting was 303 against and 275 for the motion of censure. Gladstone noted the prolonged cheering from the Liberal backbenches with which the result of the division was received. Gladstone Diaries, XI, 144.Google Scholar\n\n1035 In July 1883, Arthur William Cairns, Viscount Garmoyle, proposed to Emily May Finney, actress and daughter of a coal merchant. In order to please the Cairns family, she gave up the stage, but within six mondis, Garmoyle stopped all communications, leading Finney to sue for breach of promise. See The Times, 21 11 1884, pp. 4, 9, 12Google Scholar; Stedman, J., ‘“Come, Substantial Damages!”’, in Victorian Scandals: Representations of Gender and Class, ed. Garrigan, K. (Athens, OH, 1992), 69–91.Google Scholar\n\n1056 On 21 May 1885 Gladstone circulated a minute to cabinet colleagues laying out the circumstances under which a Land Purchase bill for Ireland might be introduced and explaining the misapprehension that had arisen between Chamberlain, Dilke and himself. Dilke and Chamberlain had indicated their surprise and objection to the modifications required by Spencer's earlier opposition to the measure. Gladstone also noted that Kimberley had seemed surprised by the change to the measure. Gladstone Diaries, XI, 343–4.Google Scholar\n\n1059 At cabinet meetings on 5 and 8 June 1885 deep disagreement about an Irish Crimes bill had emerged, with reports of wider differences within the parliamentary party over the issue also being received. On 7 June 1885 Gladstone noted ‘a formidable division in the party (quite apart from the cabinet) is to be anticipated; and such a division can only end in one way’. Gladstone Diaries, XI, 353.Google Scholar\n\n1091 At this meeting it was decided that the future Irish contribution to imperial expenditure should be fixed at one fourteenth. A contentious issue was whether control of the Customs should be handed over to the Irish, Gladstone being firmly in favour of doing so. Sir Edward Hamilton noted: ‘Harcourt was not in an amiable mood. He was bent on fault finding and holepicking; taunted Mr G. with converting Ireland into a colony “pur et simple”.’ EHJ3, 32.Google Scholar\n\n1126 For a printed statement of Kimberley's reasons for resignation, complete with marginalia, see KP 6 MS.eng.c.4466, item 16. Kimberley nevertheless remained member of the Senate, to which he was appointed in 1859, and eventually served as Chancellor of the University of London, 1899–1902. See also Allchin, W.H., An Account of the Reconstruction of the University of London, Part I (London, 1905), 176–80.Google Scholar\n\n1180 Since October 1889, the government had signed a commercial convention with Egypt; agreed with Germany, France, and Portugal to the General Act of the Brussels Conference establishing guidelines for abolition of the interior slave trade and for regulating trade; and reached separate agreements with Zanzibar, Germany, and France resolving a variety of boundary and sovereignty disputes.\n\n1214 Clement Higgins (1844–1916), Lib. MP for mid-Norfolk, 1892 until March 1895, when he declared himself a Liberal Unionist. The Council of the Mid-Norfolk Central Liberal Assoc. agreed to thank him for past services and invite him to sit until the next general election. On negotiations to avoid a by-election, see letters of Jan. and Feb. 1895 from John Wodehouse to Kimberley, KP 1 3/2.\n\n1228 Gladstone recorded in his diary after this meeting: ‘I am sorry to record that Harcourt has used me in such a way since my return to town that the addition of another Harcourt would have gone far to make my task impossible.’ Gladstone Diaries, XIII, 58.Google Scholar\n\n1229 During 1892 the Imperial British East Africa Company which had been trading in Uganda and encouraging missionary activity indicated it was going to evacuate the region. Pressure arose to formally annex Uganda so as to honour the Company's commercial, religious and humanitarian commitments. The cabinet became deeply divided over the issue, Rosebery arguing hard for annexation, Gladstone and Harcourt being strongly opposed. At the 29 September 1892 cabinet meeting a compromise was agreed whereby the government supported the Company in Uganda for a short period, evacuation being postponed.

On Kimberley's position, see his memorandum of 21 Sept. 1892, in Liberal by Principle, 203–4.Google Scholar\n\n1246 In August 1892 Kimberley received from the Indian government a despatch arguing for the adoption of bimetallism or the introduction of a gold standard for the Indian currency. Kimberley disliked bimetallism, but was willing to consider the proposal for a gold standard.\n\n1255 Owen Tudor Burne (1837–1908), maj.-genl.; priv. sec. to Lord Mayo, 1863–72, to Lord Lytton, 1876–8; head of pol. and secret dept., India Office, 1874. ‘Under Lord Kimberley's regime’, he wrote, ‘matters worked very smoothly with us. … He was very particular as to phrases in despatch-writing … keeping me, for one, up to late hours in the evening in attendance at the office. Both now and in after-years I got to like him very much, Memories (London, 1907), 262–3.Google Scholar\n\n1275 Kimberley had succinctly stated his opinion on the immorality of the repeal movement in his letter to Lansdowne at 17 June 1893. See Liberal by Principle, 209–10Google Scholar. On the longstanding dispute between Kimberley and Stansfeld, see Hammond, J.L. and Hammond, B., James Stansfeld: A Victorian Champion of Sex Equality (London, 1932)Google Scholar; Stansfeld, James, Lord Kimberley's Defence of the Government Brothel System at Hong Kong (London, 1882).Google Scholar\n\n1279 Gladstone noted in his diary: ‘I believe it was expected that I should say something. But from my point of view there is nothing to be said.’ Gladstone Diaries, XIII, 378Google Scholar. Colleagues anticipated Gladstone making an announcement about his retirement.\n\n1280 See Morley's account in Gladstone Diaries, XIII, 439–40Google Scholar. Kimberley spoke first on behalf of the cabinet and when he left the room had tears rolling down his cheeks. John Morley noted in his journal: ‘Kimberley cleared his throat, amid profound stillness, and began his words of farewell. But almost in an instant the [brave] honest fellow's voice gave way, and he could not get on. However, he bravely forced out a few broken sentences — [and] with many tears — and good honest sentences they were. [The sight of] such simple and unaffected emotion was as manly as could be, and touched everyone of us to the core.’ Morley diary, 1 March 1894, in Gladstone Diaries, XIII, 439.Google Scholar\n\n1282 Cautiously supporting Home Rule, but suggesting ‘that before [it] is conceded by the Imperial Parliament England, as the predominant member of the partnership of the three Kingdoms, will have to be convinced of its justice and equity.’ For a full discussion see Stansky, Ambitions ana Strategtes, 100–4.Google Scholar\n\n1284 Labouchere moved an amendment to the Address deploring the powers of the House of Lords, clearly intended as a vote of censure on Rosebery. Labouchere harboured a deep grudge against Rosebery for refusing him the Ambassadorship at Washington in 1892. Labouchere's amendment passed by 147 to 145 votes.

On 28 March 1894 Kimberley informed Harcourt of these negotiations by letter. On 12 April 1894 Kimberley and King Leopold's representatives secretly signed a treaty in London. When Kimberley sent Harcourt a copy of the treaty on 21 April Harcourt was enraged. At the 23 April cabinet meeting Harcourt abused Kimberley for keeping the treaty secret. Most of the cabinet seemed to side with Harcourt.\n\n1292 During June 1894 both Germany and France attacked the terms of the Anglo-Belgian treaty. Amendments were made to satisfy Germany, but discussions with France remained difficult. Morley thought the matter had been ‘grossly mismanaged’.

On 18 February, as the debate continued, Dilke made similar observations and declared that the old Whig element remained too influential in the Liberal party. In closing the debate Harcourt did not try to defend Rosebery against Labouchere's and Duke's attacks. Rosebery later claimed that his threat of resignation was a ruse intended to frighten his colleagues and bring the party into line. See Memoir, Kimberley, 504Google Scholar, note 45, herein.\n\n1325 The opposition motion indicating disapproval of Campbell-Bannerman passed by 132 to 125 votes. The government whips were caught unawares, the Liberal Unionists making great efforts to ensure a strong showing in the division lobby against the ministry. Harcourt immediately informed Rosebery: ‘It is a chance blow but in my opinion a fatal one.’ Gardiner, , Harcourt, II, 363Google Scholar.

Wilson (1844–1924) in the April by-election by 208 votes, but lost in the general election by 134, thus confirming Wodehouse's intelligence that the Tories would likely gain some 400 votes in a by-election. See John Wodehouse to Kimberley, 8 Feb. 1895, KP1 3/2.\n\n1339 The bill was intended to make the terms of purchase of their holdings more attractive to tenants. The former Conservative Lord Lieutenant for Ireland Lord Londonderry led a rebellion against the measure in the Lords. Only Arthur Balfour's strenuous efforts and diplomacy kept the bill alive. It appeared that many Conservative MPs agreed with the obstructionist peers.\n\n1379 In November 1897 the Germans seized Kiochow and the following month the Russians occupied Port Arthur. Because of Salisbury's illness Balfour was in charge of the Foreign Office and faced the choice of insisting that the British receive territorial compensation in China (thereby condoning the Russian and German annexations), or risking war by insisting that Russia withdraw. In April 1898 it was decided that Britain should ‘lease’ the port of Wei-ha-wei.\n\n1393 The Executive Committee of the Home Counties Liberal Association passed two resolutions, the first of 7 Nov. 1898 calling for early settlement of the leadership question; the second of 23 Nov., asking Kimberley ‘to consider and advise’ the Executive Committee regarding the first resolution. On 25 Nov. Kimberley declined an interview with the committee, though acknowledging ‘the feelings of the younger members’ as expressed in the resolutions. Harcourt recognized the favourable intent, but observed ‘a great deal of underhand machination’ at work.

In 1896 documents were found supporting Dreyfus's plea of innocence. Military stonewalling led to the involvement of many prominent French citizens, including Émile Zola, who helped in securing a new trial in 1899. Anti-Jewish sentiment in the military produced another conviction, though the trial was generally considered a mockery of justice and Dreyfus was pardoned by the French president.\n\n1446 Saying that he would not return to party politics, but arguing that the ‘great Liberal force in the country’ must ‘make up its mind about the war.’ For the circumstances of this and his speech of 19 July 1901 at the City Liberal Club, see James, Rhodes, Rosebey, 425.Google Scholar"
