        "text": "Margot Asquith was a woman with a quick wit and a good sense of humour. The British socialite was well-known in Victorian high society. Not long before everyone knew her name, she appeared in scandal after scandal in the tabloids.\n\nIt was a time of great contrast in Britain; the rich were very rich, and the poor were very poor. Within London, all of these were found together; you could be walking down a street paved with large houses and servants, turning the corner and being in the heart of the slums. The stench of poverty and drains overpowering you.\n\nThe media had also started to become a huge part of life. The Industrial Revolution revolutionised printing, and now, papers could be printed at a fraction of the price to the larger community. Margot became the first of many media sensations, none more so than when she married Prime Minister HH Asquith, who failed in all attempts to control Margotâ€™s controversial mouth and ways."
