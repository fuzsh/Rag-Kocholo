        "text": "Morley Town Hall is a beautiful Grade I listed building, which was officially opened in 1895 by the Morley-born MP and future Prime Minister, H. H. Asquith.\n\nThe building retains a large amount of original features, including a traditional Victorian concert hall, a courtroom and holding cells, all of which contribute to the building being chosen often as a local filming location. ITV shows Emmerdale and Heartbeat both use the Hall for both interior and exterior shots.\n\nThe hall regularly hosts events for the Leeds International Concert Season and is at the heart of community celebrations Halloween, Bonfire Night, Christmas and throughout the year."
