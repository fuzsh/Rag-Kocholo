        "text": "These images show the burial ground of the Rehoboth Chapel on Dawson Hill, Morley (West Yorkshire, UK). The chapel, a three-story building with seating for 600, was opened in 1835 and continued as a place of worship until 1968. At that time the congregation was deemed to be too small to be viable and was amalgamated with that of St Mary’s-in -the-Wood (Morley). The chapel, though somewhat dilapidated, was converted to a carpet warehouse but burnt down soon afterwards. The burial ground is now overgrown and rather hazardous.\n\nThis monument is dedicated to several members of the Asquith Family. Here are buried the mother, sister and brother of the wartime prime minister H. H. Asquith who was born in Morley in 1852. His father may also be buried here."
