        "text": "(1852–1928). English statesman H.H. Asquith served as prime minister of Great Britain from 1908 to 1916. As such, he led Britain during the first two years of World War I. Asquith was responsible for the Parliament Act of 1911, limiting the power of the House of Lords.\n\nHerbert Henry Asquith was born on September 12, 1852, in Morley, Yorkshire, England. He was educated at the City of London School from 1863 to 1870, when he won a classical scholarship at Balliol College, Oxford. At Balliol he obtained the highest academic honors, and he became a fellow of his college in 1874. He began to practice law in 1876.\n\nAsquith, a Liberal, entered the House of Commons for East Fife in 1886 and remained its member for 32 years. In 1888 he won renown as junior counsel for the Irish leader Charles Stewart Parnell, when Parnell was accused of condoning political murder. In 1892 Prime Minister William Gladstone made Asquith home secretary. During his three years at that post, Asquith was known as an able administrator and debater, and by 1895 he had become one of the leading figures of his party.\n\nIn 1905 Henry Campbell-Bannerman, the Liberal party leader, became prime minister, and the following year Asquith served as chancellor of the Exchequer under him. After Campbell-Bannerman resigned in 1908, Asquith became prime minister. During his early tenure he faced opposition in the House of Lords to Liberal reforms, prompting radical members of his own party to threaten rebellion. In 1911 Asquith was able to get the Parliament Act passed, which ended the veto power of the House of Lords over financial legislation passed by the House of Commons.\n\nThe rest of Asquith’s reign as prime minister was just as challenging. The issue of Home Rule in Ireland (the movement to secure internal autonomy for Ireland within the British Empire) nearly led to civil war in Britain in 1914. Asquith delayed Britain’s entry into World War I until the public demanded action. By mid-1915 he was unsuccessfully working with a coalition cabinet. In 1916 the Easter Rising in Dublin, Ireland, caused a grave domestic crisis, and British losses in the war were heavy. The public was dissatisfied with Asquith’s leadership, and in autumn 1916 the press launched a campaign against him; he resigned in December.\n\nAsquith became the 1st earl of Oxford and Asquith in 1925 and was created a knight of the garter shortly afterward. He remained leader of the Liberal Party until 1926. In the last years of his life he was relatively impoverished and wrote a number of books to make money. He died on February 15, 1928, in Sutton Courtenay, Berkshire, England."
