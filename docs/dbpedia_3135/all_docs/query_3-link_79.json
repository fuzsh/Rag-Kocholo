        "text": "Margot Asquith (1864-1945), wife of PM H.H. Asquith, in a 1909 portrait. Dorothy Parker would later write of her: “The affair between Margot Asquith and Margot Asquith will live as one of the prettiest love stories in all literature.”\n\nMarch 7 1915, Walmer—For a slightly different perspective on the personalities in the British government, we present excerpts from the March 7 diary entry of Margot Asquith, the wife of the British PM Henry Herbert Asquith.\n\nHenry rather tired. It is terribly hard work being PM in a great war. He has got the best of war temperaments, but he is very human…[portions excised by Margot]\n\nHe came into my bed-room about 10.15 in the morning Sunday 7th and told me he had had a very characteristic, clever letter from [Financial Secretary to the Treasury Edwin] Montagu ‘All about himself, etc., but as usual clever.’\n\nH. Winston [Churchill] is by far the most disliked man in my cabinet by his colleagues. Montagu is excellent on him, he hates him (the word hate H. only uses for short when talking to me—hate could not describe more than a mood of Montagu’s, I think: he is moody and has quick changes in his likes and dislikes though very faithful in the main, but he doesn’t hate exactly.)\n\nM. Why does Monty hate Winston? He is rather lovable, I think, and though he often bored me before the war, I’ve liked him very much since. I love his spirit of adventure: it suits me, and I love his suggestiveness.\n\nH. (irritably) Oh! he is intolerable!—noisy, long-winded and full of perorations. We don’t want suggestion, we want wisdom. [Leader of the House of Lords the Marquess of] Crewe, K[itchener] and [Home Secretary Reginald] McKenna are far the best just now. [Foreign Minister] Grey is tired out and hysterical…\n\nI love and shall always love Ed. Grey. He is a unique creature, and if he had had a delicious wife and children he would have had just what he misses; but at the same time he is quite by himself….Ld. K[itchener] said to me\n\nK. Grey is such an odd fellow: he feels all sorts of things that don’t concern him at all. Now he feels these Labour disputes and strikes acutely. I really believe if we had some awful catastrophe in this war he would go off his head.\n\nM. No, I don’t think so at all—you’ll see, when we are in a terrible plight he will be all right. He is so tired, and he is a very nervous man about his health. Though he thinks he would not mind dying, he is more afraid of his health than anyone I know. He is a lonely man who responds to coozling [cosseting] and loving. He has been unlucky in Life, not meeting quite the right women. We all fall in love with him and he loves sterling worth, but he is very naïve and easily taken in and not a fine judge of character. He is a very lovable being, because so remote from the world and so genuinely humble, though quite impenitent and not without a simple sort of vanity. He ought to have met a Clara (in the Egoist [by George] Meredith)—a sunny, warm, very generous, spontaneous, sensitive-for-others sort of woman of perfect courage and real insight; a woman of fine humour and no sort of artificiality. He has no female friend of that kind.\n\nGrey’s health wants careful watching. He thinks he is going blind. A clever oculist, taken in I suppose by Grey’s impregnable calm and beauty, told him he might very likely go blind (I wish I had heard him say it, as I can’t but think Grey exaggerates!) and this has eaten into his very soul. Bridge is his one diversion, and none of us would miss gambling with him for the world. We combine to try and remove this health spectre from his brain.\n\nI forgot to say on 4th March 1915 there was an awful row in the cabinet over the strikes in Clyde—shipping and shell-making, etc. There are always rows on the Clyde: no doubt Scotch employers and foremen are rude and tactless. In this row the employers were dead out.\n\nThe men had been promised a raise in wages before the war, and now, stale with overwork, they see their masters making large fortunes and only raising wages in a niggardly spirit, while everything has gone up in price—coal, etc. Their revolt is natural. (Of course, apart from war we shall all sooner or later have to face in the Future the one great question—the Labour question: this is our future revolution, unless we are very careful and clever.)\n\nWhen H. told me [Chancellor of the Exchequer] Ll[oyd] G[eorge], K[itchener] and Winston suggested imprisoning men who would not work in wartime, I felt paralyzed by the amazing crass stupidity of such a method!! H. (to me) ‘We had a tiring and painful cabinet. K. understood when the situation was explained at once.’ M. ‘The idea that you will get more work out of more men by imprisoning the tired ones is the high-water mark of folly!! (like trying to put down suicide by the police.)’\n\nWinston is a Tory and knows nothing of the British workman. He looks on him as a mere machine to whom high wages make the whole difference, whereas he is a very good fellow, nearly always mismanaged and overworked. People say to me ‘You’re a Socialist and of course always sympathize with the employed more than with employer.’ I say I myself think that when these strikes are gone into, people will find that working overtime and pure physical fatigue (which could have been avoided with a little more foresight on the part of the War Office or K[itchener] or Winston) has as much to do with the present Labour difficulties as anything else…\n\nWinston, Ll[oyd] G[eorge] and [former Conservative PM] Arthur Balfour have been daily confabulating on labour problems. The result of this was pretty easy to prophesy: Winston, who is naturally very indiscreet, and a greenhorn about character, began to tell A.J.B. everything (indeed has, I’ve no doubt, told him every cabinet secret.) Arthur’s non-party, dispassionate nature, his apparent controversial fairness in private life, his ease and almost lofty indifference to self would take in a more observant man than Winston. As a matter of fact Arthur is an impenitent political failure, divorced from ideas, wedded to party in the pettiest, strictest sense of the word; seldom fair in argument—unconvinced and unconvincing; a good critic, a bad judge.\n\nArthur has no conviction but a good deal of convention. He is fond of problems of Defence, and thinks H[ome] Rule for Ireland all rot; beyond this, I know nothing that he cares about. Drink, housing, Insurance, wages, education, Tariff [Reform], he doesn’t care a hang about. He likes churches and church schools. He has got a fine mind, but not a powerful one in the sense that Henry’s is powerful. It is not a sound mind, somehow (at least, Bimetallism and Protection generally mean unsoundness in my experience.) No one else makes much impression on it. The two great failures of Prime Ministers in my lifetime have been Arthur Balfour and Rosebery: two very different men, with different qualities and defects, but both lacking real nature and temperament."
