        "text": "Tim is an actor that is somewhat of an institution having graced stages, televisions and cinema screens for over four decades. His theatre background has seen him work alongside some of the British acting greats such as Patrick Stewart, Dame Judi Dench and Helen Mirren to name but a few. As well as his well-remembered roles in the likes of The Jewel in the Crown he has also given his distinctive voice to multiple documentaries and audiobooks.\n\nIn 2013, he starred as PG Wodehouse in the BBC Four drama Wodehouse in Exile."
