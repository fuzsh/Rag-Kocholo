        "text": "Lord Oxford was endowed with his full share of the family’s brains, but never showed any ambition to reoccupy the political heights. Instead he enjoyed a successful career in the Colonial Service, ending as Governor and Commander-in-Chief in the Seychelles.\n\nThough always, in his shy way, friendly, charming and relaxed — he hated ill-temper, or any manifestation of anger — Lord Oxford was shrewd in the dispatch of business, and a difficult man to fool. It was his fate, not his fault, that opportunities in the Colonial Office were exhausted with the end of Empire.\n\nJulian Edward George Asquith was born on April 22 1916, the third child and only son of Raymond Asquith. He was always known as “Trim”, his father having referred to him as “Trimalchio” (the banqueteer in Petronius’s Satyricon) in a letter written from the Front on the day after his birth.\n\nRaymond Asquith has been celebrated as the very type of the jeunesse dorée who perished in the First World War — though he was in fact 37 at the time of his death and well launched on his career as a barrister.\n\nAt Balliol he had carried off the Craven, Derby and Ireland scholarships, obtained a First in Greats, become President of the Union and been elected a Fellow of All Souls. He had married Katharine Horner, the daughter of Sir John and Lady Horner, whose family had lived at Mells, near Frome in Somerset, since the Reformation. Raymond Asquith wrote with typical brio from the Front to congratulate his wife on the birth of their son: “Shall we send him into the Cabinet or into the Grenadiers? Have you arranged a marriage for him yet? Above all, does he give away any of your guilty secrets or might he so far be mistaken for my own?”\n\n“Trim looks very presentable,” he decided after seeing photographs of his son that August. “I see a distinct likeness to your father, not at all a bad model.” On September 15 1916, showing exemplary courage under fire, Raymond Asquith was killed in the Battle of the Somme.\n\nAround 1908 the Horners had moved from the large Soanesque house in the park at Mells to the surviving wing of the manor which had been their original Tudor home. Here, in a house renowned for hospitality at once illustrious, informal and affectionate, Trim Asquith was brought up — as a Roman Catholic, after his mother’s conversion.\n\nIn 1925 HH Asquith was raised to the peerage as the Earl of Oxford and Asquith, and Trim was only 11 when he succeeded as 2nd Earl on his grandfather’s death in February 1928. He was educated at Ampleforth, from where he won a scholarship to Balliol. He took a double First in Mods and Greats.\n\nOn the outbreak of the Second World War he was commissioned into the Royal Engineers, and took part in the retreat from Greece, though not before keeping a moonlit rendez-vous in the woods outside Athens with his future wife. She was Anne, daughter of Sir Michael Palairet, the minister — and later the ambassador — at the Athens embassy. Several Palairets had played cricket for Somerset.\n\nEvacuated to Egypt, Lord Oxford was temporarily on the staff of the embassy in Cairo, and then in July 1941 went to Beirut as ADC to Major-General Sir Edward Spears, who was then head of a mission to the Levant States .\n\nIn 1942 Oxford rejoined the Royal Engineers and was sent to Safad in north Palestine to build up stocks of ammunition in caves, so that the struggle might be carried on from behind enemy lines in the event of the Germans overrunning Palestine.\n\nA meeting with Christopher Pirie-Gordon led to an invitation to join the Palestine Administration Service, and Oxford became assistant district commissioner at Beersheba. Later, in Jerusalem, he was private secretary to Sir Alan Cunningham, the high commissioner in Palestine.\n\nLord Oxford left Palestine on the last day of the British mandate, May 15 1948. He was then seconded for service with the British administration in Tripolitania, where he became director of the interior. His Italian proved useful in dismantling the apparatus of Mussolini’s rule and preparing the three territories of Tripolitania, Cyrenaica and the Fessan for independence as Libya at the end of 1951. He was a confidant of King Idris and an adviser to the prime minister, Mahmud Bey Muntasser.\n\nIn 1953 Oxford transferred to Zanzibar, where he was administrative secretary. His next appointment, in 1958, was as administrator of the Windward Islands. There the Oxfords entertained both Sir Anthony Eden and Sir Winston Churchill, who had been a friend of his father.\n\nIn 1961 Oxford was appointed Governor and Commander-in-Chief in the Seychelles. His predecessor, Sir John Thorpe, had been drowned when attempting to save his sons; and Lord Oxford and his family had to swim for their lives when their sailing boat capsized in heavy seas. Despite strong currents they managed to reach an island.\n\nAs Governor of the Seychelles, Lord Oxford was responsible for the lives and welfare of some 65,000 people. In 1965 his task was extended by the addition of the British Indian Ocean Territory, consisting of the Chagos Archipelago, Aldabra, Farquar and Des Roches.\n\nIn 1966 some 2,000 workers in the Seychelles went on strike for higher wages. Oxford warned that the colony’s police force might be unable to cope, and persuaded London to dispatch two frigates. In the event, the strike ended within a week, with the employers agreeing to raise wages.\n\nOn a lighter note, in 1965 Noël Coward, on his way back from India, visited the Seychelles. “Both the Oxfords were sweet to me,” he recorded. But after dining at Government House he went down with acute food poisoning, sending a telegram addressed to “Lucrezia and all the Borgias” from his sickbed.\n\nBy 1967, when Lord Oxford left the Seychelles, the Colonial Office was running out of territories to administer. Though he helped to draw up constitutions for the Cayman Islands and for the Turks and Caicos Islands, he was happy to retire to Mells and cultivate his garden.\n\nHis mother lived at Mells until her death in 1976. Mgr Ronald Knox had been her guest from 1947 to 1957, the last 10 years of his life, and it was at Mells that he finished his translation of the Bible.\n\nThe Oxfords maintained the house’s reputation for hospitality. Lord Oxford never lost his intellectual curiosity, or his wide-ranging interests in politics, philosophy and religion, while the presence of “travellers” at Mells gave him the opportunity to demonstrate his affinity with outcasts and underdogs. Many a homeless stray was indebted to his generosity in providing temporary accommodation in the village.\n\nHe married Anne Palairet in 1947; they had two sons and three daughters. Lady Oxford died in 1998. The elder son, Raymond, Viscount Asquith, born in 1952, succeeds as 3rd Earl of Oxford and Asquith."
