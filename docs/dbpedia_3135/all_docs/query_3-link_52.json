        "text": "Herman Webster Mudgett, also known as H.H. Holmes, built a hotel in Chicago full of evil ways to kill his victims. Holmes had a hard childhood which could have affected his future. He became obsessed with death at a young age because he was abused by his parents and he was horribly bullied at school. Holmes admitted to killing 27-200 people but murder was not the only crime he enjoyed to commit. He often committed insurance fraud and he also stole cadavers from medical schools to experiment on.…\n\nThe plot of Dr. H. H. Holmes is what kept the whole story moving as well as what kept it far from boring. The use of foreshadowing in the plot of Holmes motivates the reader to keep reading. Erik Larson’s intention was to try and expand upon the importance of Columbus…\n\nhuh? Though serial killer 's victim only account for an average of 1% of these murders, that still adds up to around 160 killings in the U.S. alone.(Scott Bonn) I have personally researched one serial killer in particular, one known as the notorious H. H. Holmes. You will, by the end of this, know more about the mind behind the murder than any would need know. He, and his “Murder castle” have been a source of inspiration for many serial killers through time. Our psychopath’s story starts in…\n\nIn The Devil in the White City, a novel published in the year 2003, Erik Larson describes the greatness of both the World's Columbian Exposition of 1893 and one of America’s first serial killers, H.H. Holmes. In the novel, Larson uses juxtaposition, imagery, and repetition to emphasize the characteristics of good and evil for the reader. In his implementations of juxtaposition, Larson directly contrasts the characteristics of opposing elements. In his contrast between “the moral” and “the…\n\nIN the mind of the worst of the human race We all fear something, don’t we? Yes, yet it is hard to say things that we are afraid of do not intrigue us, make us wonder. Where it came from what made it what it is well this paper is my dive into the mind of something that intrigues me personally yet I am also afraid of. The mind of the serial killer the monsters among men we all fear people that can take a human life but why do they well in my research I found some similarities such as personal…\n\nCarl Sandburg’s Chicago may be widely interpreted as one man’s visualization of his city. The author’s use of a sort of ordered free verse reflects the controlled chaos within the city itself. One must be well familiarized with Chicago and all of its parts and citizens to truly understand the order of the city’s work, play, and crime. Sandburg also uses numerous adjectives and similes, which applies a sort of personal, human-like aura to this city. In the first half of the poem, Sandburg…\n\nH.H Holmes was born May 16th, 1861, in Gilmanton, New Hampshire. His legal name was Herman Webster Mudgett. When he was young he was bullied. His peers discovered that he was afraid of doctors so they made him stand in front of a human skeleton at a doctors office. Holmes was afraid at first but soon intrigued by the experience. It may have led to his fascination and unhealthy obsession. Holmes was a con-artist. His first committed crimes were fraud and scams. Holmes went to the university of…\n\nLibertucci 1 According to the FBI, “serial murder can be defined as a series of three or more killings, not less than one of which was committed within the United States, having common characteristics such as to suggest the reasonable possibility that the crime was committed by the same actor or actors” (Federal Bureau of Investigation). Killers such as Henry Howard Holmes often display similar traits that can also identify them as serial assassins. These people are often master manipulators who…\n\nDr. Shipman had one of the best guises a serial killer could expect to have. He was a family doctor, a pillar of society, respected by his colleagues and patients (England, 2015). This, on its face value made it inconceivable that he could be responsible for murdering so many people. When suspicions first arose that something criminal may be afoot with the unusually high number of deaths occurring out of Dr. Shipman’s practice, things were overlooked that could have allowed the police to end…"
