        "text": "I don’t think you can regard neoliberalism as a genuine set of theories, produced by real thinking people, but which failed when implemented. It’s much better to see it as an incoherent but useful set of ideas that was very successful in facilitating the outcomes that those who adopted the ideas wanted. Neoliberalism was never really serious (it was always saucer-cult stuff) but was harmless as long as it stayed in books like Hayek’s that almost nobody read. It became dangerous when wealthy and powerful people realised that it could function as an ideological camouflage for ideas that, if presented squarely, would have been rejected by everyone.\n\nIt served three main functions. The first was the weakening of the state in the long term. It did this by redefining the state just as a provider of services, at the lowest possible price. This led to functions being taken away from the state, which meant it became weaker and so less able to do its job. This led to artificial pressure for “reform”, which in turn weakened the state further. Start again from the top.\n\nSecond, as a consequence, the creation of large patrimonial networks controlled by the same people, extracting rents for providing the same services that the state previously provided free, or at minimal cost. These days, many people have no alternative but to go through these networks, and as we do they become stronger and the state becomes weaker.\n\nThird, the result has been to drain politics of most of its substance. Almost the only issue now discussed is how services can be provided more cost-effectively (usually cheaper). Much of the political debate that existed until the 1970s has simply vanished. In turn, this makes people reluctant to vote, since they see no point in doing so. It also means that governments which might feel tempted to be activist no longer have the mechanisms to act.\n\nIf you think this sounds like Africa, it does. Recent writing on African politics is probably a better guide to what’s going on in western societies today than any number of economic treatises.\n\nThis all looks like a great success to me, the more so since most people are not even aware of how the trick has been pulled off.\n\nHenry, I am heartened that a number of posters are arguing about FPTP, AV, PR because I think that perspective is much more germane than the “post-democracy” idiom. As I understand it, Michels-Crouch argument (have not read the Crouch book) confuses the importance of intra-party democracy and “systemic” democracy, the latter does not depend so much on the former. I take Anthony Downs arguments about the relation of ideology and representative democracy over Michels any day of the week: what keeps parties oriented to the concerns of the their constituents (i.e, the venerable client-agent problem) is electoral competition in a multi-party context (and no, Britain doesn’t really qualify – God knows the US doesn’t).\n\nIn short, voters have to have enough alternative choices so they can discipline parties at the polls that diverge from their platform or ideological “soft contract” without making the election of ideological enemy likely. This largely depends on the number of parties (and that on PR). Two many parties can have adverse effects on democracy as well, but a system where two parties can compete for the loyalty of left constituents is superior in promoting democratic culture and participation in a number of ways (including that of reducing of ongoing internecine nonsense). [In the US, to cite the extreme counter example, it is part of case law that politicians cannot be sued for lying during a campaign – let alone ignoring their own party platform].\n\nThere are other non-political, sociological issues at work in the “culture” of democracy which have a lot to do with the rhythm of social movements, the decline of community, media, etc., but these are probably more intractable and long-term problems and to some extent peripheral to what Stross et al are talking about.\n\nThe UK is a “two and a half-party” system , not quite as dysfunctional as the rare two-party unicorn but it shares many of its failings (the number of parties largely due to FPTP/smd – in other Brit-derived systems bicameral legislatures play a role as well). In the American context, I find it annoying that a certain variety of left commentator insists on bashing the DP over the head for not being a better zebra when in fact it’s a giraffe, not knowing perhaps that American political parties are not parties at all. This is due to the structural features of the American system, and said features have a myriad of consequences (most of them bad for democracy and the voters of all countries). So sectarian DP bashing is a distraction but the facile mainstream touting of the American political institutions (i.e., ignorance of the alternatives) is worse.\n\nAlright, this is just messed up–mostly because we start this discussion where Michel’s theory is doing an awful lot of work outside of it’s core usefulness.\n\nNo.\n\nWe apply Dani Rodrik’s trilemma theory to the problem of unresponsive politics, and that works a lot better.\n\nLet’s start by saying that the trilemma is not some sort of gnarly Gordian knot of a problem. It’s just a natural intersection of interests that provides resiliency in the global human community. To examine what is going wrong, one much think about how the trilemma is manifested in malign ways.\n\nSo, the trilemma: democracy, sovereignty, and globalization. Good things and bad things about all of them. People are doing good when they conflict with each other in positive ways, and doing bad when they conflict with each other in negative ways. A person in one area might experience the trilemma in a different way than a person in a different continent.\n\nSo, let’s look at the UK of Stross to be accurate for someone. What has been the experience of the UK in the last forty years or so? I would suggest that the North Sea oil and gas resources, mercantilism from the Asian Tigers, and the creation of a Euro-wide financial regulatory framework that benefits The City.\n\nI think three key things that happened to create ossified political regimes:\n\n1) The most important. The Petrodollar, especially in decline. The structure and flow of energy resources has gotten much less healthy as the supply of cheaply extracted has gone down. Profits are going up in resource-extractive industries everywhere at once, creating effectively a global resource curse that’s showing up most insidiously in the price of national bonds. Much cheaper an easier to frack for oil than to develop anything value added in merchandise. Much, much, much easier to get *money* at *cheap* rates for extractive industries or use reserves in ground as a collateral. A good perspective about this can be seen with the political and economic problems of the Philippines in trying to move on from coal generated power. A worldwide carbon tax or some other bureaucratic squashing of carbon profits is one mandatory element of pushing ourselves forward, even forgetting global warming. On a broad scale, that should make it harder to extract money simply because you have oil or finished secondary resources like refined metals, sitting in some deposit or warehouse. That should further delink energy from tagging along in wage push inflation, which we just absolutely have to have, now. It should make loans to the energy industry more expensive and loans to industries that target to more narrow sales channels cheaper.\n\n2) International wage arbitrage, from Japan on…Cheap labor requires a repressive governmental apparatus that’s unresponsive to citizen demands for *services*, which tend to require capable government personnel, lots of money, and lots of time/focus. What we’re seeing now is the reimportation of illiberality, that’s now in a factory in Jackson Mississippi, when it used to be in a maquiladora somewhere in Nuevo Leon. We’re in the middle of a dynamic where the ever lower purchasing power of the populace is met with an ever more determined elite attitude about pressing costs down further. As you might guess, this is not sustainable, and whatever the people telling you that there’s no trade war, well, I think that’s impossible. If a trade war can be fought in currency, it will be fought in currency. If it cannot, it might be fought in any number of varying bureaucratic ways, including sanitation or inhospitable physical architecture.\n\n3) International regulatory arbitrage, most especially tax laws. Hidden bank account drives corruption everywheres, and they are a source of consent generation by elite factions, as one might see with the Populare Party corruption fracas and Rajoy. Or the list of Greek politicians who weren’t supposed to be taxed. Most bad business conduct depends, one way or another, on regulatory arbitrage. This is more true than it sounds, because bad business practices have a habit of generating factional infighting if the profits can’t be surreptitiously shared at the expense of some third party. The selling of subprime CDOs are a classic case. Without that ability, one of the various other elite factions would have exerted serious pressures to stop the creation of fraudulent loans (and drummed up political opposition from the populace). Another good example are the reverse IPO scams by fraudulent Chinese companies that are fleeing a moribund Shanghai stock market that nobody trusts–rather than Chinese regulators cleaning up the local marketplace, they try to fleece international investor, resulting in a big conflict with the US regulators about proper auditing that might really change things.\n\nWhen looking at it in this light, what’s really happened is that the byproduct of people acting in political and economic spheres (like, say, their method of taking a shit on the john) actually matters more than what people think, speak, or want. The power of the flush tend to be mightier than the pen (or keyboard). As such, politics won’t matter until key inputs and outputs of activities are in better balance. Carbon taxation, reasonable protection of consumer demand, better control over dark money. (And the usual key neoliberal argument, which isn’t neoliberal–temporally unlimited subsidies are the work of the devil!)\n\nreason @ 28: You read my remarks @12 and @15 as cynical?!?\n\nThat’s singularly odd. I would say I was being righteous or idealistic, in response to cynicism.\n\nponce, with, “Aging pseudo philosophers doing a bunch of handwaving about political decline was stale two thousand years ago.” was cynical. Mao Cheng Ji may have been cynical, with, “Iâ€™d say itâ€™s as democratic as it ever was; smoke~filled rooms and all that. What it is is post~ideological, post~political. Market capitalism, baby!”\n\nI didn’t think I was being cynical at all. I want my fellow Americans to want change, and to recognize when they haven’t gotten it. Cynical is giving up on any possibility of change in an idealistic direction, and grounding that apathy in assertions of debased human nature. I believe in the possibility of improving human institutions. At the moment, in American politics, cynicism may be less important than an unfounded belief that profound change has happened. After national elections, in which the balance of partisan power changed not a whit, there’s a strange euphoria on the left, matched by despair on the partisan right, and there’s no concrete basis for either feeling, beyond observing the feelings: the left is euphoric because the right seems dis-spirited, and vice-versa. Meanwhile, a profoundly anti-liberal, anti-democratic and destructive policy course continues its march, without much criticism or opposition. And, what I find oddest of all, much of the left-of-center in my personal acquaintance, seems to combine profound satisfaction that “the country has changed” with a conviction that not much can be done about any serious problem, and that shades, at times, into the conviction that, since “Obama can be trusted”, well . . . whatever . . . .\n\nAs for institutional voting structures, I don’t think any particular scheme is an obviously dominant strategy, or ideal. Ultimately, political systems have to resolve disputes to choices, and reconcile the populace to the legitimacy of those choices. There’s a reflexive loop between the system, say, of voting, and the kind of coalitional and electoral strategies, which are adopted, and it is the strategies in play, which ultimately determine whether the political system is adaptive to circumstances and responsive to broad, popular interests. Sometimes, changing the institutional system can help to break up a dysfunctional strategic pattern, but that doesn’t imply any static ideal. (The smorgasbord policies of multi-party, multi-polar polities can foster party-forming strategies that erode legitimacy and devolve the state and whole society into paralyzed division, even in a small country like the Netherlands or Belgium. I hesitate to even imagine the result in a vast country like the United States, lousy with disparate subcultures. The two-party system broke down in one region in 1860 and 600,000 died.)\n\nFPTP two-party systems in the U.S. and the U.K. have often been remarkably good at producing both adaptive, incremental change, and reconciling people to the legitimacy of reforms. Two-party systems do have the feature that both parties do tend to gravitate to a moderate center, and to compete around a legitimated policy consensus. It is rare for the parties to remain at loggerheads, or for alternation in office to result in anything, but subtle policy revision and, of course, dampening corruption to a dull roar. Each Party’s coalition is necessarily broad, and strategic competition keeps the Parties circling each other in an endless series of flanking maneuvers. Big issues will divide both Parties, and attract both Parties. And, that’s often been a good thing. It was a good thing, when both Parties tried to prove their Progressive bona fides, and both Parties sought to enact Civil Rights reforms. It is useful when partisan competition to rotate offices, fuels useful criticism and pursuit of corruption.\n\nAt the moment, the Party system is not being usefully adaptive, in U.S. politics, imho, and corruption, and cynicism, is being fed. I don’t think that’s attributable to a feature of the voting system, or something that the voters, however motivated, will find it possible to change, for the time being. (Not cynicism on my part, I think; sober assessment.) The so-called “upper-middle-class” of moderately rich folks, who supply professionals, technocrats, managers and leaders, including politicians and “activists”, have been co-opted and are occupying a space of anxious, detached, resentful complacency. Their socially liberal and neoliberal ideologies don’t let them think very deeply about why the system doesn’t work well, and so far, the system hasn’t failed them, even if it does seem to be fraying from distant edges, where the poor, working and merely middle-class are experiencing a declining standard of living and increasing economic jeopardy.\n\nThere’s really not much chance of any politician or political movement gaining much traction with a serious populist appeal in the U.S., at the moment. Not because such appeals don’t find a receptive audience — in fact, even the most tepid populist rhetoric gets a roaring response from the beleaguered majority of the population, as Obama demonstrated several times during his campaign against Romney, when he wanted to adjust the poll numbers ever so slightly, and warn Romney away from effective appeals or critiques. (The extreme vulnerability of Romney to populist attacks made it possible for Obama to minimize his resort to populist appeals, making a precisely calculated, low-margin victory also low-risk. People, who think Romney ever had a chance were simply not paying attention.) No, the problem is that almost no one in the 10-20% wants to make genuine populist appeals; the few, who are willing, are easy to marginalize in the corporate media. The liberal-left regards such appeals as inherently “racist” and would prefer the unwashed, with their guns and bibles, go away, and the right fears “class warfare” (with economic substance) more than it enjoys stoking anti-liberal tribalism via Fox News and Rush Limbaugh. This is a problem that goes much deeper into the American socio-economic strata than the two-party system, per se. It’s a fatal infection for almost any political organizing, and would condemn a six-party system, just as it seriously handicaps trade unions and grass-roots organizing and non-profit membership organizations. Class consciousness of this kind isn’t a randomly spontaneous emergent phenomenon; it is an attitude actively cultivated by giant business interests and the plutocracy, and fed by the pervasive greed, which I think was unleashed by lowering marginal income tax rates at the same time that neoliberal reforms undermined the quality of organizational governance. The 10-20% are sorely lacking in empathy, but well-stocked up in the righteousness & resentments department.\n\nThe simple, now historical, fact is that the People did throw the bums out, resoundingly, in 2006 and 2008 — two tsunami elections. But, they got few, if any policy reversals. So, on the evidence, no, even IF THEY REALLY WANTED TO, voters could NOT change things substantially. No political movement or party is willing to give them the choice to change most of the things that matter, economically and politically.\n\nKnowing that what we do has consequences is the opposite of futile cynicism. Knowing that what we do has consequences is the basis of human power. But, it follows that failure, if the word means anything, has consequences, and the consequences of the failure of 2008-9 weighs heavily on the U.S. and the world — even more because so many labor to deny that failure, and those, inevitable, consequences.\n\n“The tenth anniversary of 9/11 is almost upon us and the commemorations are well underway. So itâ€™s probably not surprising that someone would commission a poll asking Americans how different they think world would now be if their countryâ€™s response had been guided not by George W. Bush but by Al Gore.\n\nWhat is surprising is what the poll, conducted by â€œ60 Minutesâ€ and Vanity Fair, found: A clear majority of Americans â€” 56 percent â€” donâ€™t really think anything would be different. This includes 62 percent of independents, 57 percent of Republicans and 48 percent of Democrats. Even among Democrats, only 44 percent say they thought the world would be a better place now if Gore had been in the White House back then.\n\nIf the numbers seem startling, itâ€™s because the â€œglobal war on terrorâ€ that Bush chose to launch in the wake of 9/11 has long seemed like an especially vivid affirmation of the truism that elections have consequences. You could argue that virtually any president would have signed off on the invasion of Afghanistan immediately after 9/11, but Iraq was a war of choice, and as Bush was making his case for it in the fall of 2002, Goreâ€™s was perhaps the loudest voice in American politics saying, â€œNo!â€ The question of whether the world would be much different today has President Gore been in power seems like an open and shut matter. How could it not be?\n\nAnd yet, there actually is a strong case for the publicâ€™s skepticism.\n\nIt starts with remembering just how conditioned Americans in 2001 were to view Saddam Hussein as the source of much of the worldâ€™s evil and instability â€” and just how easy and painless they had come to believe war was.\n\nThis was a product of the first Gulf War, which had been sold as a noble and necessary effort to check the aggression of a brutal tyrant with dreams of regional hegemony. â€œWeâ€™re dealing with Hitler revisited!â€ George H.W. Bush famously declared in the fall of 1990. Americans bought in and rejoiced when Operation Desert Storm ended with Husseinâ€™s army evicted from Kuwait, and with surprisingly minimal Americans casualties….”\n\nhttp://www.salon.com/2011/08/30/gore_president_iraq/\n\nreason: “Not when combined with gerrymander they donâ€™t.”\n\nThe U.S. two-party system, which has been much less ideological historically, usually manages to defeat gerrymanders pretty fast. The current House Republican majority, is historically highly unusual, for depending on gerrymanders. Normally, the partisan division of seats closely reflects the nationwide two-party partisan vote split. This is because the Parties, for Congressional campaign purposes, are loose amalgamations of State and local parties, and the State parties morph to mirror local circumstances. The Democratic Party is pretty competitive, even in much of the Republican solid south — able to compete for control of the legislature, for example, in Mississippi, the most conservative state in the country; for a while 3 of the 4 Mississippi Congress critters were Democrats — very conservative Democrats mostly, but still voting for and with Pelosi. The Republicans have only managed to exploit gerrymanders, by re-districting more often than the usual decade interval.\n\nWe might also note that Obama’s piss-poor leadership performance and failure to deliver what voters wanted in 2009 played a major part in the Republican triumph in 2010, in the House and in many State legislatures. (Mandatory voting, as in Australia, might help a lot, in dampening the pathological strategic potential of low-turnout elections.) Conspicuously, Obama, in his convention acceptance, did not rally Democrats for the Congressional elections, and his campaign organization neglected local candidacies. Ryan was re-elected to the House in a district Obama won, in 2008 and 2012 — the failure to even try to unseat him is telling.\n\nSo, the fact that the Parties have become ideologically “pure” and two-dimensional, and the fact that Obama operates at one extreme of the Democratic ideological range, while symbolically appearing to many Republicans to operate at the other, non-existent extreme of the Democratic ideological range, plays a part in the effectiveness of gerrymanders.\n\nThe story of the Senate is different, because the gerrymander there, in favor of rural interests, is frozen into the Constitution, unfortunately. But, again, Obama and his conservative allies keep the filibuster in place, greatly exaggerating the pathology. The politics of the filibuster gives them a convenient excuse for the deliberate “failure” to do what Democratic votes want and expect them to do.\n\nThe U.K. scheme — FPTP single-member parliamentary system with persistent and sometimes locally viable 3rd parties, and low voter turnout — seems extremely problematic to me. Gerrymanders, there, even undeliberate ones, with the most idealistic non-partisan intentions among those drawing the lines, can have profoundly undemocratic effects. Both Thatcher and Blair governed with minority electoral support. Not having to marshal a coalition that can command 50.1% (Labour seems to need less than 40% of actual voters; and considerably less than 30% of the potential electorate.) can enable a Party to be more coherent ideologically, but other forces have pushed Labour away from ideological differentiation.\n\nMao Cheng Ji @ 71 Yes, yes, yes. Historically, American politics has been driven more through the mechanisms of mass-membership-movements independent of the two Parties, as by the two Parties, themselves. Masonic and masonic-like organizations, Temperance, women’s suffrage, abolitionists, populists, local business organizations, labor unions, professional associations, the National Rifle Association, the environmental movement, the Civil Rights movements, feminist organizations, gay rights, farmers’ lobbies, ethnic and religious organizations, and on and on. The radical decline of social affiliation in American society since the advent of television and the breakdown of subcultures, which accelerated across the 20th century, has left the whole political process, without enough non-elite input and influence. This is a deeper malady than the Parties.\n\npjm @ 86 I think parliamentary systems can have some adaptive advantages over the American Congress and strong President scheme, which is clumsy and getting pretty long in the tooth — we haven’t redrawn many state boundaries in the last century, and that entails some serious governance problems, too. But, I’m skeptical of multi-party, especially for a continent-sized country — for the U.S., multi-party is likely to be regionalized — with one-party and two-party State systems driving regional competition, without national parties, and that could be very destructive. As long as legislation requires 51%, you end up with something like two competing coalitions, regardless, and it’s not clear than the excluded-middle groupings do anything good for the process or legitimacy.\n\nOn pjm’s other point, however, I’m in complete agreement. Elites will emerge in every political system — can’t live with them and can’t live without them. The elites have horizontal relationships among themselves, which compete with their vertical dependence on the masses. To the extent, that elites can use horizontal cooperation to undermine their own vertical dependencies, democracy suffers.\n\nSo, yeah, what I said above to Mao Cheng Ji. And, yes, a significant factor, as Mao was hinting, in whether elites remain responsive to the needs and interests of the masses, is whether they feel there is a threat from below, including a potentially violent threat. The 19th century British parliament, though entirely the creature of an hereditary landed aristocracy, was, at important margins, responsive to the popular will and adaptive to rapid social and economic change, because the elite genuinely feared violent revolution (which, given that much of the population was concentrated in cities, and in pretty desperate straits and near starvation much of the time, was not unreasonable, and, of course, a great mass of people would not have been kept in such Dickensian misery in an enormously rich country, which wasn’t being ruled by a narrow oligarchy, like an hereditary aristocracy).\n\nI take anacyclosis pretty seriously, and the prospects for a sharp rise in political violence and social unrest in the U.S. seem quite strong, for a variety of reasons.\n\nhttp://www.smartplanet.com/blog/savvy-scientist/cliodynamics-a-science-for-predicting-the-future/545\n\nâ€œNo, not equivalent. Democrats prefer bombings.â€\n\nThey are all the same so vote Republican!\n\nWhy are you mocking the claim that Gore would have launched a bombing campaign against Iraq? Clinton planned three, and launched two, during his second term (Desert Strike, Desert Thunder, Desert Fox).\n\nMaybe there’s something really perverse about how we (me included) use the word ‘invade’ instead of ‘wage war on’ or ‘attack.’ For all we clash over this, I do trust MPAVictoria to have the world’s best interests at heart, but mocking someone for pointing out that Democrats have a longstanding policy of bombing Iraq is stone cold awful, and I think it illustrates the problem with setting ‘invade’ as the standard candle.\n\nThe US did bomb Iraq in December 1998 and early 1999, while Clinton was President. Obviously that doesn’t count as invading, for technical reasons (gods am I ever sick of hearing the phrase “boots on the ground” ten times a day). But this kind of thing absolutely should count as waging war, and it’s awful to brush it off dismissively or turn it into a wisecrack. The completely plausible continuation of this bombing regime under a Gore Presidency certainly counts as Gore [hypothetically] waging war on Iraq.\n\nMy fucking gods, it’s not all about the election. Clinton waged war on Iraq. True. Gore would have waged war on Iraq. True. Bush invaded Iraq, which was orders of magnitude more destructive and more costly. True. Would a Gore presidency have invaded Iraq? I dunno, nowadays I think he would have done roughly one-tenth that amount of violence by committing to the war in Afghanistan most of the forces, bombs, etc. that Bush used in Iraq. Basically I imagine a role reversal: the Afghanistan War would be the Big Debacle overshadowing everything, and Iraq would be the not-getting-talked-about place getting bombed all to hell. Is that disputable? Sure. Is it nuts? Nah.\n\nDo I know nothing of why the US invaded Iraq and really am not qualified to speak on this subject? Oh FFS. Should I bring up that PNAC helped draft the Iraq Liberation Act, which Clinton signed? Should I bring up PNAC’s role in Operation Desert Fox, which Clinton spearheaded? Should I start spewing connections illustrating just how cozy Gore and PNAC really were? Or can we maybe, maaaaybe, recognize that this is a terrible irrelevant road to walk, since it’s not All About The US Presidential Election? (AAUSPE?)\n\nProjecting so vote Republican at somebody is always a dangerous, needless, and constraining reflex, but all the more so when discussing the scope or constitution of democracy itself.\n\nChris @79: you can make any theories you want, but if they aren’t addressing an actual existing problem then they aren’t valid theories. Before you start describing the reasons for the problem of post-democracy, you need to prove that we are living in this state, i.e. that there is a problem.\n\nYour evidence is paper-thin because a) it’s a counter-factual, not evidence and b) it’s wrong. The US invaded Iraq because an insane foreign-policy establishment pushed a weak and stupid man to complete his father’s legacy: none of these conditions existed for Gore. Bush spent a year drumming up that war, lying and corrupting major US defense and security institutions to do it. The war didn’t just happen to America the way Afghanistan in 2001 did, and you need to deal with this before you argue Gore would have done the same thing. Similarly for Blair and Howard: the idea that Blair would have unilaterally invaded Iraq is just silly, for example. They were reacting to Bush’s impetus based on a pre-existing security framework.\n\nI think you and the theory described in the OP are also confusing the forms in which modern politicians express themselves with the substance of their actions. For example in Australia now it is quite traditional to present “small target” policies when in opposition, since Howard won in 1996 using that tactic. But that doesn’t mean the parties are the same, just that their media strategies are. In fact, in 2007 the Howard government’s policies were so unpopular that hte PM himself was voted out of his own seat, first time in 90 years that this happened. Is this post-politics? Now we have parties that differ vociferously over mining tax, carbon pricing, education, regional development, disability insurance, workplace rights … and of course we have Julia Gillard’s misogyny speech. You can’t seriously say that these parties are similar except in media strategy.\n\nThe same is true in the UK. It’s been traditional for political parties to target benefit scroungers and immigrants in their media strategy, but that doesn’t mean they have the same policies. The devastation Cameron is wreaking on the poorest sector of society is a once-in-a-generation event, and his mealy-mouthed techniques to starve the NHS of funding compare radically with NuLab increasing NHS funding in real terms by something like 5% a year over 10 years. They may both talk austerity, but the way they implement it and the extent of it are completely different. The same is true of the security state: what happened under Blair may have been unpleasant, but we can see from things like the Hillsborough inquiry and the way the truth is leaking out about police spies – as well as the speed with which the killer of htat newspaper guy was identified and dealt with – that things have changed a lot under labour, though they may not have changed as much as we might like.\n\nYou’re engaging in a combination of mistakes here. First, you’re looking at things from such a far-left distance that you can’t tell quite widely-spaced objects apart (it’s like you’re looking at things from space and saying “they look very close together!”). Second, you’re confusing media strategy with policy. And third, you’re ignoring the very real damage that Republicans and Tories do to the poorest people in the community (and, especially in the Republicans’ case, to women).\n\nI know we’ve been over all this before, but it really would benefit the whingers here to revisit the idea that the parties are indistinguishable. There’s a difference between “indistinguishable” and “mutually unsatisfactory” and confusing the two doesn’t do anyone on the left any good.\n\nStephen @ 114\n\nBritain, workshop of the world and leader of the industrial revolution, was the superior or close rival of the United States, for honor of being the richest country in the world, throughout the 19th century. Not rich, by the standards of the 20th or 21st centuries, perhaps, but it was a country, where the concentration of wealth was extreme, and the feverish accumulation of capital into the hands of the few combined with the conquest of empire, to leave very little benefit to servants or factory workers, and even less to Irish peasants. Averages do not tell this story adequately, and estimates of inflation over a period of decades are necessarily spurious. (Regardless of any other aspect of living standard, daily calorie requirements were, if anything, significantly higher for people in the 19th century than in the developed world today).\n\nThings changed dramatically in the course of the 2oth century, particularly after the Liberal landslide victory of 1906, and even more so after the world wars, but at the beginning of the 19th century, Parliament was constituted as it had been since the reign of Henry VI, with scarcely any change at all, since the restoration of Charles II in the 17th century. The House of Commons was elected on property qualifications, with no boroughs added to represent the great cities of Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds, and Sheffield, and Commons was dominated by the landed gentry and the corruptly chosen representatives of great magnates. (The Duke of Norfolk, Earl of Arundel, recusant before the 1829 emancipation of Catholics and therefore absent from his own seat in Lords, had eleven seats in the House of Commons in his gift.) The House of Lords, of course, was entirely composed of titled hereditary aristocrats, most possessing large estates.\n\nThe Great Reform, enacted in 1832, with one-third of the 19th century already gone, began a process of incremental reforms, which gave the franchise to, maybe, 15% to 20% of adult males. The Second Reform, sponsored by Disraeli, further extended the franchise in 1867, two-thirds of the 19th century complete, but still fell short of enfranchising a majority of all adult males; other features of the new electoral system may have actually increased upper class domination of actual membership in the House of Commons.\n\nI am going to attach a classic excerpt from Barbara Tuchman’s Proud Tower in a subsequent comment. It is a wonderful essay, that begins with a description of the last Conservative government, that of 1895.\n\nBarbara Tuchman, The Proud Tower:\n\nA Portrait of the World Before the War, 1890-1914, Macmillan 1966\n\nThe last government in the Western world to possess all the attributes of aristocracy in working condition took office in England in June of 1895. Great Britain was at the zenith of empire when the Conservatives won the General Election of that year, and the Cabinet they formed was her superb and resplendent image. Its members represented the greater landowners of the country, who had been accustomed to govern for generations. As its superior citizens, they felt they owed a duty to the State to guard its interests and manage its affairs. They governed from duty, heritage and habit — and, as they saw it, from right.\n\nThe Prime Minister was a Marquess and lineal discendant of the father and son, who had been chief ministers to Queen Elizabeth and James I. The Secretary for War was another Marquess, who traced his inferior title of Baron back to the year, 1181, whose great-grandfather had been Prime Minister under George III and whose grandfather had served in six cabinets under three reigns. The Lord President of the Council was a Duke, who owned 186,000 acres in eleven counties, whose ancestors had served in government since the Fourteenth Century, who had himself served thirty-four years in the House of Commons and three times refused to be Prime Minister. The Secretary for India was the son of another Duke, whose family seat was received in 1315 by grant from Robert the Bruce, and who had four sons serving in Parliament at the same time. The President of the Local Government Board was a pre-eminent country squire, who had a Dukefor brother-in-law, a Marquess for son-in-law, an ancestor who had been Lord Mayor of London in the reign of Charles II, and who had himself been a Member of Parliament for twenty-seven years. The Lord Chancellor bore a family name brought to England by a Norman follower of William the Conqueror and maintained thereafter over eight centuries without a title. The Lord Lieutenant for Ireland was an Earl, a grandnephew of the Duke of Wellington and an hereditary trustee of the British Museum. The Cabinet also included a Viscount, three Barons and two Baronets. Of its six commoners, one was director of the Bank of England, one was a squire, whose family had represented the same county in Parliament since the Sixteenth Century, one — who acted as Leader of the House of Commons — was the Prime Minister’s nephew and inheritor of a Scottish fortune of 4,000,000, and one, a notable and disturbing cuckoo in the nest, was a Birmingham manufacturer widely regarded as the most successful man in England.\n\nBesides riches, rank, broad acres and ancient lineage, the new Government also possessed, to the regret of the Liberal Opposition and in the words of one of them, “an almost embarassing wealth of talent and capacity.” Secure in authority, resting comfortably on their electoral majority in the House of Commons and on a permanent majority in the House of Lords, of whom four-fifths were Conservatives, they were in a position, admitted the same opponent, “of unassailable strength.”\n\nEnriching their ranks were the Whig aristocrats, who had seceded from the Liberal party in 1886, rather than accept Mr. Gladstone’s insistence on Home Rule for Ireland. They were for the most part great landowners, who, like their natural brothers the Tories, regarded union with Ireland as sacrosanct. Led by the Duke of Devonshire, the Marquess of Lansdowne and Mr. Joseph Chamberlain, they had remained independent until 1895, when they joined with the Conservative party and the two groups emerged as the Unionist party, in recognition of the policy that had brought them together. With the exception of Mr. Chamberlain, this coalition represented that class in whose blood, training and practice over the centuries, landowning and governing had been inseparable. Ever since Saxon chieftains met to advise the King in the first national assembly, the landowners of England had been sending members to Parliament and performing the duties of High Sheriff, Justice of the Peace and Lord Lieutenant of the Militia in their own counties. They had learned the practice of government from the possession of great estates, and they undertook to manage the affairs of the nation as inevitably and unquestionably as beavers build a dam. It was their ordained role and natural task.\n\nBut, it was threatened. By a rising rumble of protest from below, . . . . The rumble was distant, but it spoke with one voice that said, Change, and those whose business was government could not help but hear.\n\nPlanted firmly across the path of change, operating warily, shrewdly yet with passionate conviction in defense of the existing order, was a peer, who was Chancellor of Oxford University for life, had twice held the India Office, twice the Foreign Office and was now Prime Minister for the third time. He was Robert Arthur Talbot Gascoyne-Cecil, Lord Salisbury, ninth Earl and third Marquess of his line.\n\nhix @ 142, the long list of things that are different about the US compared to other adv. ind. democracies, and perhaps foremost among these is the lack of participation (inversely correlated with income) at very high rates, are due to a number of structural features in the American system.\n\nMy argument (and I think it is nothing fancy or so original, just a fairly straightforward interpretation of the transnational data and fairly commonplace arguments in the\n\npoli sci lit) is that the following are interrelated (and mutually reinforcing) :\n\nlow participation of working class/poor voters\n\n~ dis-proportionality (i.e. the opposite of PR)\n\n~ lack of (competitive multiparty) party system\n\n(the most salient aspect of which is no ideologically coherent, disciplined parties)\n\n~ undeveloped welfare state and general slow pace of legislated reform (i.e. we are decades behind all the other a.i.d)\n\nSupporting all of this (and especially the slow pace of reform) are structural features of an anti-majoritarian legislative system “architect-ed” mostly in the Constitution which make the legislative process a machine uniquely well designed for stalling popular reforms. (I.e., low participation rate has an symbolic component – no parties with an ideological connection to working class voters – and material one – the slow rate at which the legislative process allows social reform to be enacted – people lose interest in politics because it doesn’t “deliver the goods”).\n\nWhy do I say the American parties are not ideological? They have ideologies but they are diffuse at the best of times and usually fractured and self-contradictory. More importantly, whatever the ideological “face” a party represents, they are not electorally disciplined enough to enact their programs. US parties undergo ups and downs in terms of the ideological “spread” but the need for super-majorities to pass laws through the committee systems, the incredibly disproportional Senate with its filibuster rules and the Presidential veto mean there is a second layer of institutional pressure (beyond the pre-existing tendency in the s.m.d elections themselves) to move center despite a party’s own ideological center-of-gravity in order to just get legislation passed. (Note that if you are an anti-reform party – you have a distinct advantage). Also because the legislative process is so slow it means that voters have to turn out for multiple elections (sometimes in off years) if there is a hope to push through a particular reform.\n\nAs also as a party grows to transition from the minority to majority position, the “compromise over ideology” tendency becomes stronger because there is no legal or organizational mechanism that compels US legislators to vote in accordance the platform of their own party (or put another way, US parties are more likely to grow by “broadening” their tent which necessarily means diffusing of it existing ideological mix).\n\nSo one answer to a venerated conundrum of political science as to why is there no political manifestation of Socialism in US politics is that the “party” system doesn’t support ideology. Really it is a two part process. First part, the Debsian Socialist Party got over 10% of the vote for Debs in 1912 but disproportionalality meant it only ever won 3 Congressional seats (and its candidates were never seated in two of those) instead of 10 or 20.\n\nEven if it had (second part – the role of ideology and super-majority requirements), a SP in the US Congress would have had to produce higher levels of political mobilization (compared to other Western democracies) just to get its legislation passed. This would have reproduced the aforementioned tension between ideological coherence and “delivering the goods” to the party’s constituents. And once a minor (i.e., “third”) party’s constituents started to believe that one of the major (ideologically promiscuous) parties might have a better chance of passing social reforms of interest, a minor party’s days as going electoral concern are numbered (especially given how expensive elections are). This is just a restatement of the poli sci rule of thumb that 3rd parties quickly have to become one of the Big Two or die in the US Congress.\n\nThe Democratic Party was able to deliver the goods (sort of) in the 30’s when the Depression resulted in election wins on the order of 70% (I don’t know how much of this came from a bump in turnout but presumably most of it did) but the labor movement and the welfare state have been fighting a rearguard action ever since as the “normal” turnout rates having given the conservatives (outside the DP and not) enough traction in Congress to endlessly forestall labor law reform, national health care (well at least for 70 years, keep your fingers crossed) etc.\n\nJame @143, I agree Gerrymandering is a problem but it is an outgrowth of a complicated structures mentioned above (i.e, the Lunatics are running the Asylum) and though a good thing for democracy (for the reasons you cite) but probably is nowhere near enough (e.g., the super-majority requirements remain in Congress until such time as the Constitution is amended or abandoned). Also, single member districts, even when not Gerrymandered result in fewer parties (a la the UK), give swing voters disproportional influence, etc. The problem with any specific change in the process is that politicians (who were elected under the “old rules” have very little interest in change) and process-oriented reform rarely has a wide constituency.\n\nBruce Wilder @131 and 132\n\nYou are, as always, lucid, eloquent and often well-informed. But when you write that Britain “throughout the 19th century [was] not rich, by the standards of the 20th or 21st centuries, perhaps, but it was a country, where the concentration of wealth was extreme, and the feverish accumulation of capital into the hands of the few combined with the conquest of empire, to leave very little benefit to servants or factory workers, and even less to Irish peasants” I cannot see much congruence between your views and reality; at least, _throughout_ the nineteenth century. Are you really arguing that servants and factory workers were not very much better off at the end of the nineteenth century than at the beginning – or indeed, Irish peasants? Or that the concentration of wealth was extreme in Britain by nineteenth century standards? Was it really that much better than in the US in the Gilded Age, allowing for the enormous acreage of free land available in the US?\n\nAs for the long and delicious quotation from Barbara Tuchmann: I admire her rhetoric and have a few doubts about her command of facts. One would not realise, judging from her description of Salisbury’s first cabinet – which I freely admit was the highwatermark of late aristocratic Conservatism- that it included WH Smith, the newsagent and bookseller, or that later reorganisations brought in Joseph Chamberlain the Birmingham businessman, Charles Ritchie from a family of jutespinners in Dundee,George Goschen from an Anglo-German merchant family (and champion of the University Extension movement), Henry Matthews, a Catholic lawyer, born in Ceylon and educated in Paris, Akers-Douglas, son of a Kentish parson, or Robert Hanbury, a Staffordshire coalowner.\n\nCompetent, many of them were. Well off, mostly (but compare US politicians of the same vintage). Aristocratic, come off it.\n\nAnd Tuchmann was tilting the balance somewhat. Look at the cabinet before Salisbury’s: HH Asquith, son of a Yorkshire wool merchant, Henry Campbell-Bannerman, a Glasgow wholesale and retail draper, AJ Mundella, a Nottingham hosier, son of an Italian refugee, Arnold Morley, an Nottingham manufacturer and publisher, Henry Fowler, a Wolverhampton solicitor, James Bryce, son of a Belfast lawyer, George Shaw-Lefebvre, son of a London barrister, John Morley, a Lancashire journalist.\n\nNot, I think, aristocratic rulers keeping the lower classes penned in Dickensian squalor. Was there, indeed, any Dickensian squalor in Britain by the end of the nineteenth century?\n\nMao Cheng Ji @146 I would be talking out my depth if I said had much certainty about the “size” issue, bigger not necessarily being better. But there are some observations that can be made.\n\n0) In a sub-optimally democratic systems, the balance between democratic resources (e.g. voters) and non-democratic resources (e.g. money) shifts to corrupting side and in general money is much more fluid than voters (which is one reason federalism in problematic in democracy, that said devolution is always a fall back to for dealing with regional concerns).\n\n0.5) Regionalism is a complicated and I am not sure there is one “regional” problem. Do New York suburbanites really see the world differently than LA suburbanites? To the extent that they do now, is not that reality an artifact of a political system where legislators parcel out political goods on a state-by-state basis?\n\nOn top of that, disproportionality creates a regional problem larger than it has to be,\n\ni.e., rural population get disproport. representation in Congress (especially the Senate) and to a lesser extent when they are allocated House districts where they can become the “swing”. And if history is any guide, the rural Congressional delegation has been colonized by a variety of monied interests. To the extent that regional issues reflect a rural v. urban division, it is hard to imagine worse alternatives than this.\n\nLegislators beholden to the platform of a national party prescribing a national policy have a completely different set of incentives. And when national policy is determining economic rights or goods as a matter of law then equalizing the outcome (e.g., between constituents in different states) becomes a matter of administration and conflicts between regions become legal perhaps but not political (in the legislative sense).\n\n1) In general I think proportional multi-party systems are much better at making compromises or effecting complicated deals than the alternative (such as the US). This is done through coalition government. Unlike the sort of backroom dealings among political insiders here, in negotiations between parties (to form a government) the ideological connection establishes the parties as “relaible clients” so the deals have qualitatively more democratic legitimacy that in non-competitive systems.\n\nIn general, the ability to innovate or strike creative deals should increase with the number of parties, i.e., the number of possible coalitions should increase with more parties. But there is the rub, there is some evidence too many parties (which is equivalent to saying too many small parties) seem to result in dysfunctional patterns possibly related to the disproportionate power small parties can wield and possbily to the degree that too much “noise” can fill the political-cultural space). So comments about whether p.m.p.d can come up with workable solutions to challenges posed by regionalism or identity politics has to take in a account a possible ceiling in terms of too many parties. And indeed, perhaps there is a limit on how large/diverse a country can be and still managed with a PR system, but giving up on large countries seems preferable to giving up on democracy.\n\n[I would argue Barrington Moore’s conundrum about how political elites allowed the Civil War to happen is to argue that the American system is not really all that good, as it believes itself to be, in creating compromise because ultimately one cannot maintain a strategy of compromise with intransigent political minorities – which the system does produce, well certainly in the case of slavery it is practically enshrined in the Constitution].\n\n3) Without competitive and ideological politics, you can’t really slice and dice political constituencies and reassemble into legitimating majorities without some form of coercion (or false promises). This applies to regional and “identity” interests. One can at least entertain the New Yorkers and Californians, or Hispanics and Blacks might respond to appeal built on their common interests (e.g. class or economic interests). But there is no likeliehood of this happening is constrained when all ideological appeals are suspect as are most political actors (i.e., when there is no solution to client-agent problem). And it is hard to imagine unifying appeals to class in a political system where ideological accountability is marginal at best and where the system is a product of an electorate largely not working class and highly compromised by money (from you-know-who).\n\nI don’t have much of a clue what the political dynamics of a PR America regarding “divisive” issues would be like, but it is hard to imagine they would be much worse than now. Politics elites employ extreme ideological appeals in the current system for a variety of reasons and in general the truncated (2 party) political system is too narrow to accomodate all the ideological positions a complex society generates.\n\nOne of the reasons is that simply to obtain a better bargaining position against other elites (or to in some other way disrupt them – racialist appeals may not be so much aimed at mobilizing the Klan as it is to destabilize coalitions between urban blue collar whites and people of color). And there is an asymmetry here, the system gives conservatives and in-built advantage, they do not have to build majorities to create obstructionist coalitions in Congress.\n\n4) One of the reason, perhaps, for the rise of identity politics is what I mention in a previous post is that, for whatever reason, reforms around formal equality in the US are much more successful than those wanting the redistribution of wealth.\n\nLast point, any wealthy country (without the presence paramilitary entities, with rule of law, etc) is unlikely to become Lebanon, political elites (and most everybody else) are not likely to see the up-side in it. (Or at least that’s my hope.)"
