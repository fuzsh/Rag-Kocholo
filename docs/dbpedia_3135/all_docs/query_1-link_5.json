        "text": "Paul Sykes (born 30 May 1943) is an English businessman, political donor, and philanthropist. He is a noted opponent of the European Union and a supporter of the UK Independence Party (UKIP). He previously supported the Conservative Party, but left because of the party's support of the Maastricht Treaty.\n\nBorn in Barnsley, Sykes was the son of a miner and left school with no qualifications. He had various manual jobs before setting up a business at the age of 18 to dismantle old buses and sell the engines as scrap to developing countries in the Far East. He later moved into property development and built the Meadowhall shopping complex in Sheffield.\n\nHis internet firm Planet Online was for a time Britain's largest internet service provider. In 1998 Sykes sold it for £85 million to Energis. In 2004, his wealth was estimated at some £650 million.\n\nAfter treatment for the disease at the hospital in 2000, he funded the construction of a specialist prostate cancer unit at St James's University Hospital, Leeds. Sykes also donated over £1m to the restoration of the Royal Hall in Harrogate. He funded Sir Ranulph Fiennes' expeditions on the Eiger for the British Heart Foundation, and the Everest Challenge for Marie Curie Cancer Care.\n\nJack Tordoff started working as an apprentice mechanic at his family’s garage business at 15 after the death of his father, but decided he could make better money trading cars than repairing them. The business he started with a loan of £1,000 from his mother now has 48 garages across the country, and in 2014 achieved a turnover of over £1 billion.\n\nMr Tordoff said: “I started buying second-hand cars, repairing them and cleaning them. It grew and grew. You’ve got to have a bit of luck. I really put everything into it and I’ve enjoyed every minute of it.”\n\nThe company was established in 1946 as Tordoff Motors, with one showroom that housed Standard and Triumph vehicles. Founded Jack Tordoff, a successful rally driver in the 1960s and 70s and winning the Circuit of Ireland Rally in 1973, built the business over 44 years before his son and current CEO, John Tordoff, took over in 2002. The elder Tordoff remains chairman.\n\nThe JCT600 company name came from the personal number plate of a Mercedes-Benz 600 that Jack Tordoff owned.\n\nSir Kenneth Duncan “Ken” Morrison CBE (born 20 October 1931) is a British businessman, who is the Life President and former chairman of Morrisons (Wm Morrison Supermarkets PLC), the fourth largest supermarket group in the UK.\n\nHe was born in Bradford, and was brought up by five elder sisters. Whilst at Bradford Grammar School, Morrison worked in the family provisions business in the school holidays. He was given jobs such as working on the market stalls or checking eggs against lamps for defects. By 1956 he was the Chairman and Managing Director of a small group of shops, the embryo of what was to become a formidable retail presence, a household name throughout the UK and the largest public company headquartered in Yorkshire.\n\nWhilst the family business was named after his father, Morrisons' head office \"Hilmore House\" is named after his mother. The original Hilmore House was located in Thornton Road, but moved to larger premises at Gain Lane as a result of the takeover of Safeway.\n\nIn June 2006, Ken Morrison announced that he would relinquish executive control of the company, which came into effect from 4 September, making way for the appointment of Dutchman Marc Bolland as chief executive. He announced that it was his intention to stand down as the chairman and director of the company in January 2008, and take the honorary post of Life President. He eventually stood down on 13 March 2008.\n\nSamson Fox (11th July 1838 – 24th October 1903) was an English engineer, industrialist, and philanthropist. He was elected Mayor of Harrogate in Yorkshire and donated most of the cost of building the Royal College of Music in London. Samson Fox was born at Bowling, Bradford, Yorkshire, England, the son of Jonas Fox, a mill worker, by his marriage to Sarah Pearson,[1] and the family shortly afterwards moved to live and work in nearby Leeds. At the age of eight Fox started work in a textile mill and at fifteen he became an apprentice in a toolmaking and foundry company. In his late twenties, he was running his own toolmaking business, called the Silver Cross Works.\n\nTen years later, in 1874, he set up the Leeds Forge Company to produce \"Best Yorkshire\" iron for locomotive and marine engine parts. In 1877 he developed the corrugated boiler flue for which he became famous. In 1887, Fox applied his knowledge and experience in forging metal to building forged \"pressed\" iron railway undercarriages and trucks. His railway trucks could support 120 tons without failing, were guaranteed for five years, and were soon being sold in Argentina, Belgium, British India, Japan, and Spain, in addition to England.\n\nFox won a number of awards for his work, including the Royal Society of Arts gold medal for his corrugated boiler flue and the French Legion of Honour.\n\nThe Leeds Forge Company still stands today in Armley, Leeds as Crown House, the head office of the Yorkshire Enterprise Network. A fox weather vane on top of Crown House has been retained as a reminder that this was once the famous Samson Fox’s forge.\n\nGraham Kirkham, Baron Kirkham, CVO (born 14 December 1944 in Doncaster), is an English businessman, the founder and chairman of sofa retailer DFS.\n\nPreviously executive chairman of DFS Furniture Company Ltd, Kirkham is a strong political and financial supporter of the Conservative Party, and is one of South Yorkshire's richest men, with a personal fortune estimated at £1 billion. After selling DFS in April 2010 he now has a large share in Iceland supermarkets. He is also now involved in fish and chip shops having bought the Whitby chain.\n\nBy 1983, Darley Dale–based Direct Furnishing Supplies had become one of Northern Upholstery biggest suppliers. When Direct Furnishing Supplies went bankrupt with debts of £900,000 on a turnover of £3,000,000, Kirkham bought it. Northern Upholstery now renamed itself DFS and at the time had a total of 63 stores employing 2,000 staff. In 1993, DFS was floated on the stock market and valued at £271 million, with Kirkham and his family trusts owning just over half of the shares.\n\nBut the revival was short lived, and in light of the continuing prevalence for private equity, Kirkham took the chain private again, leveraging his family's own 9.46% stake with £150 million of family funds in an eventual £496 million deal. Kirkham told the Yorkshire Post: \"It's something that's caused me fitful sleep in the time I've been thinking about it. I've no hobby, this is my hobby – it's what I do. I'm an entrepreneur. It's almost as if I can feel the adrenaline running through my veins.\"\n\nOn 23 April 2010, it was announced that DFS had been sold to private equity firm Advent International for a reported £500m.\n\nPeter Wilkinson was the founder and Managing Director of STORM and VData, the predecessor businesses of InTechnology. In 2001 he formed Digital Interactive Television Group Limited where he retains a 40% shareholding and is Executive Chairman. Whilst focusing on InTechnology he is also a non-Executive Director and shareholder of The Wireless Group plc, Getmedia plc and Peerless Technology Group plc.\n\nStarting out as a software programmer for Systime, he rapidly rose to the position of International Software Director. However, his eye for a business opportunity was apparent even at school, where he commandeered the school's hobs, employed 5 fellow pupils to chop and fry potatoes, and ran a highly successful and lucrative chip production enterprise - until he was closed down.\n\nHe left Systime in 1983 to found Storm, an international data storage distribution company. In 1999 he founded VDATA, a company that revolutionised IT operations by enabling online data backup - a much more efficient, fast and cost-effective alternative to tape backup. Storm and VDATA merged in 2000 to become InTechnology.\n\nThe innovative trend he started almost 30 years ago continues up to the present day. He leads InTechnology's strategic direction with a hands-on approach and his strong belief in business ethics has led to a loyal and longstanding customer base.\n\nDean Hoyle is the founder and previous owner of Card Factory and the current chairman and owner of Football League Championship side Huddersfield Town and is based in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire.\n\nHoyle founded the Card Factory, a chain of greetings cards and gift stores, in 1997. As of 2009, the company had 500+ shops, employing over 5,000 people. Hoyle confirmed the sale of the Card Factory to Venture Capitalist Charterhouse was finally completed on 9 April 2010. The terms of the deal were not disclosed but financial commentators put the final selling price at in excess of £350m and would maintain a role in the business as Non-Executive Chairman.\n\nHoyle is a lifelong Huddersfield Town F.C. supporter. He joined the board of Huddersfield Town on 10 April 2008 and took over as chairman, and majority shareholder, of the Club on 3 June 2009. The outgoing chairman, Ken Davy, retains a minority holding\n\nJames Harold Wilson, Baron Wilson of Rievaulx, KG, OBE, FRS, FSS, PC (11 March 1916 – 24 May 1995) was a British Labour Party politician who served as the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1964 to 1970 and 1974 to 1976. He won four general elections, and is the most recent British Prime Minister to have served non-consecutive terms.\n\nFirst entering Parliament in 1945, Wilson was immediately appointed the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Works and rose quickly through the ministerial ranks, becoming the Secretary for Overseas Trade in 1947 and being appointed to the Cabinet just months later as the President of the Board of Trade. Later, in the Labour Shadow Cabinet, he served first as Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer from 1955 to 1961 and then as the Shadow Foreign Secretary from 1961 to 1963, when he was elected Leader of the Labour Party after the sudden death of Hugh Gaitskell. Wilson narrowly won the 1964 election, going on to win a much increased majority in a snap 1966 election.\n\nWilson's first period as Prime Minister coincided with a period of low unemployment and relative economic prosperity, though also of significant problems with Britain's external balance of payments. In 1969 Wilson sent British troops to Northern Ireland. After losing the 1970 general election to Edward Heath, he spent four years as Leader of the Opposition before the February 1974 general election resulted in a hung parliament. After Heath's talks with the Liberals broke down, Wilson returned to power as leader of a minority government until there was a second general election in the autumn, which resulted in a narrow Labour victory. A period of economic crisis was now beginning to hit most Western countries, and in 1976 Wilson suddenly announced his resignation as Prime Minister.\n\nOverall, Wilson is seen to have managed a number of difficult political issues with considerable tactical skill, including such potentially divisive issues for his party as the role of public ownership, British membership of the European Community, and the Vietnam War, in which he consistently resisted US pressure to involve Britain and send British troops, while continuing to maintain a costly military presence East of Suez. Nonetheless, his stated ambition of substantially improving Britain's long-term economic performance remained largely unfulfilled.\n\nSir John Hall (c.18 December 1824 – 25 June 1907) was born in Kingston upon Hull, England, the third son of George Hall, a Captain in the navy. At the age of ten he was sent to school in Switzerland and his education continued in Paris and Hamburg. After returning to England and being employed by the Post Office, at the age of 27 he decided to emigrate, later becoming the 12th Prime Minister of New Zealand. He was also Mayor of Christchurch.\n\nIn 1853, he was elected to the Canterbury Provincial Council. He would later rise through the ranks of magistrate, was the first town council Chairman in Christchurch. On 8 October 1879, he was appointed the Premier of New Zealand, where his ministry carried out reforms of the male suffrage (extending voting rights) and dealt with a conflict between settlers and Māori at Parihaka, although poor health caused him to resign the position less than three years later. In 1882 he was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George.\n\nHall took an active interest in women's rights. He moved the Parliamentary Bill that gave women in New Zealand the vote (1893), (the first country in the world to do so).\n\nKnown For: Becoming the 12th Prime Minister of New Zealand and giving women the right to vote\n\nWilliam Wilberforce (24 August 1759 – 29 July 1833) was an English politician, philanthropist, and a leader of the movement to abolish the slave trade. A native of Kingston upon Hull, Yorkshire, he began his political career in 1780, eventually becoming the independent Member of Parliament for Yorkshire (1784–1812). In 1785, he became an Evangelical Christian, which resulted in major changes to his lifestyle and a lifelong concern for reform.\n\nIn 1787, he came into contact with Thomas Clarkson and a group of anti-slave-trade activists. They persuaded Wilberforce to take on the cause of abolition, and he soon became one of the leading English abolitionists. He headed the parliamentary campaign against the British slave trade for twenty-six years until the passage of the Slave Trade Act of 1807.\n\nWilberforce was convinced of the importance of religion, morality and education. He championed causes and campaigns such as the Society for the Suppression of Vice, British missionary work in India, the creation of a free colony in Sierra Leone, the foundation of the Church Mission Society, and the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. His underlying conservatism led him to support politically and socially repressive legislation, and resulted in criticism that he was ignoring injustices at home while campaigning for the enslaved abroad.\n\nHerbert Henry Asquith, 1st Earl of Oxford and Asquith, KG, KC, PC (12 September 1852 – 15 February 1928), served as the Liberal Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1908 to 1916. Until 5 January 1988, he had been the longest continuously serving Prime Minister in the 20th century.\n\nAs Prime Minister, he led his Liberal party to a series of domestic reforms, including social insurance and the reduction of the power of the House of Lords. He led the nation into the First World War, but a series of military and political crises led to his replacement in late 1916 by David Lloyd George. His falling out with Lloyd George played a major part in the downfall of the Liberal Party. Before his term as Prime Minister he served as Home Secretary (1892–95) and as Chancellor of the Exchequer (1905–08). He was known as H. H. Asquith until his elevation to the peerage (1925), when he became Earl of Oxford and Asquith.\n\nAsquith's achievements in peacetime have been overshadowed by his weaknesses in wartime. Many historians portray a vacillating Prime Minister, unable to present the necessary image of action and dynamism to the public. Others stress his continued high administrative ability, and argue that many of the major reforms popularly associated with Lloyd George as \"the man who won the war\" were actually implemented by Asquith. The dominant historical verdict is that there were two Asquiths: the urbane and conciliatory Asquith, who was a successful peacetime leader, and the hesitant and increasingly exhausted Asquith, who practised the politics of muddle and delay during the Great War.\n\nCharles Frederick Crisp (January 29, 1845 – October 23, 1896) was a United States political figure. A Democrat, he was elected as a Congressman from Georgia in 1882, and served until his death in 1896. From 1890 until his death, he was leader of the Democratic Party in the House, as either the House Minority Leader or the Speaker of the House. He was also the father of Charles R. Crisp who also served in Congress.\n\nCrisp was born in Sheffield, England, January 29, 1845. Later in that year, his parents immigrated to the United States and settled in Georgia where he attended the common schools of Savannah and Macon, Georgia. At the outbreak of the American Civil War, he was temporarily residing in Luray, Virginia, with his parents, who were in the middle of a Shakespearean play tour.\n\nCrisp studied law at Americus, Georgia. He was admitted to the bar in 1866 and commenced practice in Ellaville. He was appointed solicitor general of the southwestern judicial circuit in 1872 and reappointed in 1873 for a term of four years. Later, he was appointed judge of the superior court of the same circuit in June 1877. Crisp was elected by the general assembly to the same office in 1878 and reelected judge for a term of four years in 1880 when resigned that office in September 1882 to accept the Democratic nomination for the United States Congress.\n\nCrisp served as president of the Democratic gubernatorial convention at Atlanta, Georgia, in April 1883. he was elected as a Democrat to the Forty-eighth and to the six succeeding Congresses and served from March 4, 1883, until his death. In Congress, he served as chairman of the Committee on Elections in the Fiftieth Congress, Committee on Rules in the Fifty-second and Fifty-third Congresses, and Speaker of the House of Representatives in the Fifty-second and Fifty-third Congresses. He had been nominated for United States Senator in the Georgia primary of 1896, but he died in Atlanta on October 23, 1896, and was buried in Oak Grove Cemetery in his hometown of Americus. Georgia's Crisp County is named in his honour.\n\nSir Dove-Myer Robinson (15 June 1901 – 14 August 1989) was Mayor of Auckland City from 1959 to 1965 and from 1968 to 1980, the longest tenure of any holder of the office. He was a colourful character and became affectionately known across New Zealand as \"Robbie\". He was one of several Jewish mayors of Auckland, although he rejected Judaism as a teenager and became a lifelong atheist.\n\nBorn Mayer Dove Robinson in Sheffield, England, he was the sixth of seven children of Ida Brown and Moss Robinson. His Jewish heritage ensured that he was often targeted by anti-semitic violence in the schools he attended. The family moved to New Zealand in 1914, where his father worked as a pawnbroker.\n\nRobinson entered politics in the late 1940s when he led the opposition to a sewage dumping scheme that would have discharged untreated effluent into the Hauraki Gulf. When elected in 1953 as a councillor, he proposed and eventually realised a scheme to break down the sewage in oxidation ponds ('Robbie's ponds') near the Manukau Harbour. His success in the scheme later on helped him gain his first mayoralty of Auckland City. It was in his second term as Mayor that he led the push to found the Auckland Regional Council and he went on to be its first chairman.\n\nSir Robert Michael Marshall, DL (21 June 1930 - 6 September 2006), usually known as Michael Marshall, was a British businessman, politician, cricketer and author. After a career in the steel industry, he was Conservative Member of Parliament for Arundel for 23 years, from the February 1974 general election until the constituency was abolished in 1997.\n\nHe was the first MP with an MBA from Harvard, and was a junior government minister in Margaret Thatcher's first government, from 1979 to 1981. He was heavily engaged with the Inter-Parliamentary Union, and had interests in theatre, cricket, golf, and wrote a number of books. He joined the Young Conservatives in 1950, but remained relatively inactive in politics until 1970, when he contested The Hartlepools, a safe Labour seat. He became MP for Arundel in the February 1974 general election, and retained his seat until his retirement from politics in 1997.\n\nIn Parliament, his knowledge of the steel industry made him an effective critic of Sir Don Ryder's plan to nationalise British Leyland. He was a member of the Select Committee on Nationalised Industries, and realised that British Steel needed major reconstruction. He was able to implement his ideas when he became Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Department of Industry in 1979, under Sir Keith Joseph, where his portfolio that included aerospace, information technology, telecommunications, the Post Office, shipbuilding, space and steel. He was a strong supporter of Japanese investment in British industry. He oversaw the denationalisation of Cable & Wireless and the launch of Teletext.\n\nMarshall returned to the back benches in 1981. He took an interest in the fledgling British space industry, lobbying for British participation in Ariane. He retired at the 1997 general election, when the boundaries of his seat were changed. He continued his business interests in retirement. After converting to Roman Catholicism in later life, he became a non-executive director of The Catholic Herald in 2003.\n\nSir Henry Kenyon Stephenson, 1st Baronet (16 August 1865 - 20 September 1947) was a British politician and businessperson. His father was Henry Stephenson. Stephenson was born into a family of Typefounders in Sheffield. He became the Chairman and Managing Director of Stephenson, Blake & Co Ltd,(1927) and later the Chair of the Sheffield Gas Company. He also became the Treasurer of the University College of Sheffield, and then the first Treasurer of its successor, the University of Sheffield.\n\nStephenson joined the Liberal Party and was elected to Sheffield City Council, becoming Lord Mayor in 1908-09 and again in 1910-11. In 1910, he also became the Pro-Chancellor of the University of Sheffield, succeeding Frederick Mappin. At the 1918 UK general election, he became the first Member of Parliament for the Sheffield Park constituency, holding the seat as a National Liberal in 1922, but dropping to a distant third place in 1923. He served as High Sheriff of Derbyshire in 1932.\n\nStephenson became a Lieutenant-Colonel in World War I and was awarded the Distinguished Service Order. He also served as Master Cutler in 1919 and later retired to Hassop Hall. In 1936 he was created a Baronet, of Hassop Hall in the County of Derby.\n\nSir Edward James Harland, 1st Baronet (15 May 1831 – 24 December 1895) was a British shipbuilder and politician. Born in Scarborough, North Yorkshire, he was educated at Edinburgh Academy. In 1846, aged 15, he took an apprenticeship at the engineering works of Robert Stephenson and Company in Newcastle upon Tyne. Afterwards he was employed in jobs in Glasgow and again in Newcastle, before moving to Belfast in 1854 to manage Robert Hickson's shipyard at Queen's Island. Four years later he bought the yard and renamed the business Edward James Harland and Company.\n\nOutside his company, Harland served as a Belfast harbour commissioner. In 1885, Harland was granted a knighthood and a baronetcy. Harland was a member of the Conservative and Unionist Party, and served as Mayor of Belfast; later he moved to London and served as Member of Parliament for Belfast North until his death.\n\nEdward Harland served as the chief Belfast Harbour Commissioner from 1875 until the 1880s. As a member of the Conservative and Unionist Party, he served as Mayor of Belfast in 1885 and 1886, and strongly opposed the 1886 Home Rule Bill. In 1885, Harland was granted a knighthood and on 25 July the same year, he was granted a baronetcy. In 1889 Harland was elected to serve as the Member of Parliament for Belfast North. Harland then moved to London, and was re-elected unopposed twice in 1892 and 1895 and served as MP for the constituency until his death, on Christmas Eve 1895 at his Irish home, Glenfarne Hall in County Leitrim.\n\nWilliam Pickering (March 15, 1798 – April 22, 1873) was born in Yorkshire, England amd was also a Republican and the fifth governor of Washington territory, from (1862 - 1866).\n\nHe graduated from Oxford University in 1820. The following year he moved to Edwards County, Illinois, acquiring property and involving himself in various businesses in the area of Albion, Illinois. He served in the Illinois House of Representatives from 1842 to 1852.\n\nHe was a delegate to Republican National Convention from Illinois, 1860. In 1862 President Lincoln offered him the choice of being either part of the United States Ministry in England or Governor of the Washington territory, known at the time as the territory of Columbia. Pickering chose the governorship, and he moved to the territorial capital, Olympia, in June 1862, and served as governor until 1866.\n\nOn September 4, 1864, he sent the first message over a transcontinental telegraph line. Under the leadership of Territorial Governor William Pickering, state government took responsibility for the care of the mentally ill. Lacking funds to build a hospital, the state contracted for the care of the mentally ill with the Sisters of Charity (now the Sisters of Providence), but, because of lack of funds, it was 19 months before the Sisters began to receive payment.\n\nAfter his term, he moved back to Illinois, where he died in 1873.\n\nSir Fred Hoyle, (born June 24, 1915, Bingley, West Yorkshire, - died August 20, 2001, Bournemouth, Dorset), British mathematician and astronomer best known as the foremost proponent and defender of the steady-state theory of the universe. This theory holds both that the universe is expanding and that matter is being continuously created to keep the mean density of matter in space constant. Hoyle was educated at Emmanuel College and St. John’s College, Cambridge, and spent six years during World War II with the British Admiralty, working on radar development. In 1945 he returned to Cambridge as a lecturer in mathematics. Three years later, in collaboration with the astronomer Thomas Gold and the mathematician Hermann Bondi, he announced the steady-state theory. Within the framework of Albert Einstein’s theory of relativity, Hoyle formulated a mathematical basis for the steady-state theory, making the expansion of the universe and the creation of matter interdependent. Einstein assumed that the universe as a whole is static—i.e., its large-scale properties do not vary with time.\n\nThis assumption, made before American astronomer Edwin Hubble’s observational discovery of the expansion of the universe in 1927, was also natural; it was the simplest approach, as Aristotle had discovered, if one wished to avoid a discussion of a creation event. The notion that the universe on average is not only homogeneous and isotropic in space but also constant in time was philosophically attractive. Hoyle, Bondi, and Gold called it the perfect cosmological principle. In the late 1950s and early ’60s, controversy about the steady-state theory grew. New observations of distant galaxies and other phenomena, supporting the big-bang theory (a phrase that Hoyle had coined in derision in the 1940s), weakened the steady-state theory, and it has since fallen out of favour with most cosmologists. Although Hoyle was forced to alter some of his conclusions, he tenaciously tried to make his theory consistent with new evidence.\n\nHoyle was elected to the Royal Society in 1957, a year after joining the staff of the Hale Observatories (now the Mount Wilson and Palomar observatories). In collaboration with William Fowler and others in the United States, he formulated theories about the origins of stars as well as about the origins of elements within stars. Hoyle was director of the Institute of Theoretical Astronomy at Cambridge (1967–73), an institution he was instrumental in founding. He received a knighthood in 1972. Hoyle is known for his popular science works, including The Nature of the Universe (1951), Astronomy and Cosmology (1975), and The Origin of the Universe and the Origin of Religion (1993). He also wrote novels, plays, short stories, and an autobiography, The Small World of Fred Hoyle (1986).\n\nKnown For: Mathematics and astronomy. Defender of the steady-state-theory\n\nSir Edward Victor Appleton, (born September 6, 1892, Bradford, Yorkshire, England—died April 21, 1965, Edinburgh, Scotland), British winner of the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1947 for his discovery of the so-called Appleton layer of the ionosphere, which is a dependable reflector of radio waves and as such is useful in communication. Other ionospheric layers reflect radio waves sporadically, depending upon temperature and time of day.\n\nEducated at St. John’s College, Cambridge, Appleton worked at the Cavendish Laboratory from 1920 until he was appointed Wheatstone professor of physics at King’s College, University of London, in 1924. There he attained international repute with his research into the propagation of electromagnetic waves and the characteristics of the ionosphere. He showed that radio waves of wavelength sufficiently short to penetrate the lower region of the ionosphere are reflected by an upper region (now known as the Appleton layer, or F2 layer). This discovery made possible more reliable long-range radio communication and aided in the development of radar.\n\nIn 1936 Appleton returned to Cambridge as Jacksonian Professor of Natural Philosophy and in 1939 became secretary of the government’s Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, where he worked on radar and the atomic bomb during World War II. He was knighted in 1941 and became principal and vice-chancellor of the University of Edinburgh in 1949.\n\nKnown For: Discovering the ionosphere\n\nRichard Richardson (1663–1741), was a botanist and antiquary, born at North Bierley on 6 Sept. 1663 and baptised at Bradford on 24 Sept., was the eldest son of William Richardson of North Bierley (1629–1667), who married at Elland in Halifax on 2 Aug. 1659 Susannah (d. 1708), daughter of Gilbert Savile of Greetland in that parish. The father died intestate, with assets not quite sufficient for the payment of his debts, but Richard, out of the landed estate, provided for his sister and younger brother.\n\nRichard was educated at Bradford school, and on 20 June 1681 matriculated from University College, Oxford. He is said to have taken the degree of bachelor of physic at Oxford, but this statement appears doubtful. On 10 Nov. 1681 he was entered as a student at Gray's Inn, and probably divided his time for some years between London and the university. He matriculated at Leyden on 26 Sept. 1687, and lived for three years in the house of Paul Hermann, the eminent professor of botany. Boerhaave was among his fellow-students. His Latin thesis ‘De Febre Tertiana’ for a doctor's degree at Leyden on 13 March 1690 was printed, with a dedication to Richard Thornton, ‘amico et consanguineo suo.’ When he returned to England and settled on his property, he practised as M.D., but most of his professional services were rendered gratuitously.\n\nWith the ample means at his command, Richardson travelled much in England, Wales, and Scotland in search of rare botanical specimens, particularly of the cryptogamia class, and liberally patronised less wealthy collectors, like Samuel Brewer and Thomas Knowlton. His garden on his estate at North Bierley was well stocked with curious plants, both indigenous and exotic, and his was considered the best collection in the north of England, if not in the whole country. He planted a seedling cedar of Lebanon, sent to him by Sir Hans Sloane, at Bierley Hall; the tree is conspicuous in the engravings of that place; and he constructed the second hothouse that was made in England. He also formed a very valuable library of botanical and historical works, And drew up two manuscript indexes, one in 1696 and the other in 1737, of the plants in his garden and was a leading authority on mosses and lichen.\n\nKnown For: Botanist and antiquary\n\nGeorge William Lamplugh was born in Driffield on 8 April 1859, the son of Henry Lamplugh (1835-1865) and Elizabeth née Weightman (1835) Lamplugh worked initially on the glacial deposits of East Yorkshire and in the Geological Magazine in 1878 (at the age of nineteen) he published his first paper: “On the occurrence of marine shells in the boulder-clay at Bridlington and elsewhere on the Yorkshire coast”. In this important paper, the start of a lifelong study of Yorkshire glaciology, he recognized the now rarely exposed Bridlington Crag as a shelly mass of erratics caught up in the Basement Clay – a novel interpretation at the time. His records, with meticulous descriptions, of geological exposures now concealed behind sea defences or otherwise vanished, remain a valuable resource.\n\nIn 1901 Lamplugh was promoted to District Geologist and took charge in Dublin of the Irish branch of the Geological Survey; as DG he supervised and contributed to the mapping of the country around Dublin, Belfast, Cork, and Limerick. He returned to Great Britain in 1905 to head successively the Midlands and North Wales Districts, and he also did some important work surveying part of the Wealden area. In all this work he was the author or co-author of a number of sheet Memoirs. On the appointment of Strahan in 1914 as Director of the Geological Survey Lamplugh succeeded him as Assistant Director for England and Wales, a post that he retained until his retirement in 1920.\n\nIn spite of his busy working life Lamplugh managed to visit a number of distant lands with geological or glaciological objectives, all before the First World War when travel was not easy. His adventurous journey to the Yukon in 1884 has already been mentioned. He travelled twice more to North America, in 1893 to visit the Grand Canyon, and in 1897 for a meeting of the BA in Vancouver. Two of his other travels were linked to overseas meetings of the BA: in South Africa in 1905 and Australia in 1914.\n\nLamplugh was a member of the Yorkshire Geological Society (YGS) by1878 as a paper of his “On the divisions of the glacial beds of Filey Bay” appeared in the Society’s Proceedings that year; he was President 1921-1922. The Geological Society (of London) of which he became a Fellow (FGS) in 1890 and President 1918-1920 awarded him its Bigby Medal in 1901 and its premier Wollaston Medal in 1925. In 1906 he was President of Section C (Geology) of the British Association (BA). He was also a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society (FRGS) from 1905 and Council member 1912-1915. It was in 1905 too that, most importantly, Lamplugh was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS); he served on its Council as well (1914-1916). Having formerly been an amateur geologist he continued in his later life to be supportive of various provincial societies besides the YGS including three of which he was President at some time: the Yorkshire Naturalists’ Union, the Hull Geological Society and the Hertfordshire Natural History Society.\n\nKnown For: Geologist and geographer\n\nPercy Shaw, OBE (15 April 1890 – 1 September 1976) was an English inventor and businessman. He patented the reflective road stud or \"cat's eye\" in 1934, and set up a company to manufacture his invention in 1935. Percy Shaw inventor of the world renowned invention, the cats eye, was born in Halifax in the West Riding of Yorkshire, the fourth child and second son of James Shaw. In 1892, his parents moved their large family to Boothtown in Halifax, where Shaw lived for the rest of his life.\n\nShaw was inventive, even at an early age, but his most famous invention was the cat's eye for lighting the way along roads in the dark. There are several stories about how he came up with the idea. The most famous involves him driving down the difficult road from the Old Dolphin public house in Clayton Heights to his home in Halifax, when a cat on a fence along the edge of the road looked at the car, reflected his headlights back to him, allowing him to take corrective action and remain on the road. In an interview with Alan Whicker, however, he told a different story of being inspired on a foggy night to think of a way of moving the reflective studs on a road sign to the road surface.\n\nFurther, local school children who were taken on visits to the factory in the late 1970s were told that the idea came from Shaw seeing light reflected from his car headlamps by tram tracks in the road on a foggy night. The tram tracks were polished by the passing of trams and by following the advancing reflection, it was possible to maintain the correct position in the road.\n\nKnown For: Inventor (Cat's eye) and businessman\n\nThomas Crapper was born in Waterside, Thorne, Yorkshire in 1836, the son of a steamboat captain. At the age of fourteen, Crapper was apprenticed to a plumber in Chelsea, where he served as a journeyman. In 1861, Crapper started his own business in London, called Thomas Crapper and Co. The company manufactured sanitary ware, bathroom fittings and in particular the flush toilet, which made the firm famous. The merchandise was noted for its quality and value, and the company thrived.\n\nThe products became regular household items throughout the country. Some ‘Crapper’ manhole covers may be seen today in Westminster Abbey. The firm drew the attention of the Royal Family, and Crapper was commissioned to fit out the Royal country house of Sandringham with thirty water closets with cederwood seats. The company enjoyed Royal patronage even after Crapper’s death and obtained several Royal Warrants.\n\nThe assumption that Crapper invented the flushing toilet in untrue. The device was created by Sir John Harington, a courtier of Elizabeth I, who had a ‘john’ built at the palace. It was developed by Alexander Cummins, whose device allowed a modicum of water to remain in the bowl to prevent seepage from the sewers. Crapper did popularise the loo and made it an accepted domestic fixture he registered a number of patents, such as the 'Ballcock' and the 'Disconnecting Trap' which became an essential underground drains fitting. This alone was a great leap forward in the campaign against disease. The notion that Crapper gave his scatological name to faeces is just crap. The word ‘crap’, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, derives from the Middle English ‘crappe’, meaning chaff or residue from rendered fat.\n\nCrapper died in 1910 and is buried in Beckenham Cemetery, Elmers End Road, Beckenham, Kent.\n\nKnown For: Inventing the flushing toilet\n\nJack Peter Shepherd (born 14 January 1988) is an English actor. He has portrayed the character of David Platt in the ITV soap opera Coronation Street since April 2000.\n\nBefore taking on the role of David, Shepherd had appeared in episodes of TV's Where the Heart Is and Clocking Off where he starred with his future Coronation Street screen sister Tina O'Brien. Shepherd has taken time out of Coronation Street to do theatre work, including the role of Riff in a production of West Side Story as part of Stage 84 The Yorkshire School of Performing Arts. He has also appeared in Oliver! at Bradford's Alhambra theatre.\n\nIn 2008, Shepherd appeared in Ghosthunting with Coronation Street on the Isle of Man. In 2007, Shepherd won the Best Bad Boy Award at the Inside Soap Awards and in 2008, he won 'Best Villain' at the British Soap Awards. Shepherd uses his middle initial in his stage name as there is already a well-known British actor named Jack Shepherd.\n\nHe is also a contributor to the topical show Grouchy Young Men, a spin-off of the show Grumpy Old Men, on the British version of Comedy Central. Shepherd is engaged to his long-term girlfriend Lauren with whom he has two children, Nyla and Reuben\n\nNotable Works: Coronation Street\n\nMichael Edward Palin CBE (born 5 May 1943) is an English comedian, actor, writer and television presenter. He was one of the members of the comedy group Monty Python and later made a number of travel documentaries.\n\nPalin wrote most of his comedic material with Terry Jones. Before Monty Python, they had worked on other shows such as the Ken Dodd Show, The Frost Report, and Do Not Adjust Your Set. Palin appeared in some of the most famous Python sketches, including \"Argument Clinic\", \"Dead Parrot sketch\", \"The Lumberjack Song\", \"The Spanish Inquisition\", and \"The Fish-Slapping Dance\".\n\nAfter Python, he began a new career as a travel writer and travel documentarian. His journeys have taken him across the world, including the North and South Poles, the Sahara Desert, the Himalayas, Eastern Europe and Brazil. In 2000 Palin was honoured as a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) for his services to television. From 2009 to 2012 Palin was the president of the Royal Geographical Society. On 12 May 2013, Palin was made a BAFTA fellow, the highest honour that is conferred by the organisation.\n\nKnown For: Actor and Comedian\n\nSir Patrick Stewart (born 13 July 1940) is an English film, television, and stage actor, who has had a distinguished career on stage and screen. He is most widely known for his film and TV roles, as well as his prolific stage roles with the Royal Shakespeare Company, and his many voice acting roles. In 1993, TV Guide named him the best dramatic television actor of the 1980s. Patrick Stewart was in Mirfield, in the West Riding of Yorkshire, England.\n\nHaving lived in Los Angeles for many years, Stewart moved back to England in 2004, in part to return to work in the theatre. In the same year, Stewart was appointed Chancellor of the University of Huddersfield and subsequently as a Professor of Performing Arts in July 2008. In this role, Stewart regularly attends graduation ceremonies in the UK and Hong Kong and teaches master classes for drama students.\n\nStewart was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2001 New Year Honours list, and was made a Knight Bachelor in the 2010 New Year Honours for services to drama. In July 2011, Stewart received an Honorary Doctorate of Letters (Hon.Litt.D.) from the University of East Anglia.\n\nIn July 2012, Stewart carried the Olympic torch as part of the official relay for the 2012 Summer Olympics and stated it was an experience he will 'never forget', adding that it was better than any movie première. In July 2014, Stewart received an honorary doctorate of letters from the University of Leeds.\n\nNotable Works: Star Trek: The Next Generation, X-Men, Dune\n\nFacebook: /patrickstewart\n\nTwitter: @SirPatStew\n\nFrederick Theodore Albert Delius, (29 January 1862 – 10 June 1934) was an English composer. Born in Bradford to a prosperous mercantile family, he resisted attempts to recruit him to commerce. He was sent to Florida in the United States in 1884 to manage an orange plantation. There he soon neglected his managerial duties, and in 1886 returned to Europe. Having been influenced by African-American music during his short stay in Florida, he began composing. After a brief period of formal musical study in Germany beginning in 1886, he embarked on a full-time career as a composer in Paris and then in nearby Grez-sur-Loing, where he and his wife Jelka lived for the rest of their lives, except during the First World War.\n\nDelius's first successes came in Germany, where Hans Haym and other conductors promoted his music from the late 1890s. In Delius's native Britain, it was 1907 before his music made regular appearances in concert programmes, after Thomas Beecham took it up. Beecham conducted the full premiere of A Mass of Life in London in 1909 (he had premiered Part II in Germany in 1908); he staged the opera A Village Romeo and Juliet at Covent Garden in 1910; and he mounted a six-day Delius festival in London in 1929, as well as making gramophone recordings of many of Delius's works. After 1918 Delius began to suffer the effects of syphilis, contracted during his earlier years in Paris. He became paralysed and blind, but completed some late compositions between 1928 and 1932 with the aid of an amanuensis, Eric Fenby.\n\nThe lyricism in Delius's early compositions reflected the music he had heard in America and the influences of European composers such as Edvard Grieg and Richard Wagner. As his skills matured, he developed a style uniquely his own, characterised by his individual orchestration and his uses of chromatic harmony. Delius's music has been only intermittently popular, and often subject to critical attacks. The Delius Society, formed in 1962 by his more dedicated followers, continues to promote knowledge of the composer's life and works, and sponsors the annual Delius Prize competition for young musicians\n\nEdward Christopher “Ed” Sheeran (born 17 February 1991) is an English singer-songwriter. Born in Hebden Bridge, he moved to London in 2008 to pursue a musical career. In early 2011, Sheeran released an independent extended play, No. 5 Collaborations Project, which caught the attention of both Elton John and Jamie Foxx. He then signed to Asylum Records. His debut album, +, containing the singles “The A Team” and “Lego House”, was certified quintuple platinum in the UK. In 2012, he won two Brit Awards for Best British Male Solo Artist and British Breakthrough Act. In 2014 he was nominated for Best New Artist at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards.\n\nSheeran’s popularity abroad began in 2012.

They also won the Mercury Prize in 2006 for their debut album, in addition to receiving nominations in 2007 and 2013. The band have headlined at the Glastonbury Festival twice, in 2007 and again in 2013. Arctic Monkeys were heralded as one of the first bands to come to public attention via the Internet (through fan-based sites rather than from the band), with commentators suggesting they represented the possibility of a change in the way in which new bands are promoted and marketed.\n\nFacebook: /ArcticMonkeys\n\nTwitter: @ArcticMonkeys\n\nPulp were an English alternative rock band who formed in Sheffield in 1978. Their best-known line-up from their heyday (1994–1996) consisted of Jarvis Cocker (vocals, guitar), Candida Doyle (keyboards), Russell Senior (guitar, violin), Mark Webber (guitar, keyboards), Steve Mackey (bass) and Nick Banks (drums). Senior quit in 1996 and returned for tours in 2011, while Leo Abrahams had been a touring member of the band since they reunited in 2011, contributing electric and acoustic guitar.\n\nThroughout the 1980s, the band struggled to find success, but gained prominence in the UK in the mid-1990s with the release of the albums His 'n' Hers in 1994 and particularly Different Class in 1995, which reached the number one spot in the UK Albums Chart. Different Class spawned four top ten singles, including \"Common People\" and \"Sorted for E's & Wizz\", both of which reached number two in the UK Singles Chart. Pulp's musical style during this period consisted of disco influenced pop-rock coupled with \"kitchen sink drama\"-style lyrics.

In February 2014, Yorkshire announced that Bird is to be voted in as the club's president at their Annual General Meeting on 29 March. The son of a miner, he gained the nickname 'Dickie' at school. He lives in the South Yorkshire village of Staincross. When a knee injury put paid to playing football professionally, he followed his second love, cricket. In his early career in Barnsley, he played club cricket in the same team as Geoff Boycott, and journalist and chat show host Michael Parkinson, who became a lifelong friend. In 1956, Bird signed up with his home county, Yorkshire. After his county career, he coached and played league cricket before becoming an umpire.\n\nHe stood in his first county game in 1970. Three years later, he officiated at his first Test match, England v New Zealand at Headingley Stadium in Leeds. The other umpire was Charlie Eliott as England won by an innings and one run. He gained a reputation for stopping play for weather and not giving batsmen out LBW. Bird's attention to detail was placed under scrutiny at the Centenary Test between England and Australia at Lord's in 1980. One of Bird's strengths was that he was able to manage and earn the respect of some of the more volatile players in the game, sometimes by using his infectious humour. He was also known as being eccentric, famously arriving at a ground five hours early as the Queen was to visit that day.\n\nBird umpired in 66 Test matches (at the time a world record) and 69 One Day Internationals including 3 World Cup Finals. He came out of retirement in January 2007 to umpire in the XXXX Gold Beach Cricket Tri-Nations series involving cricketing legends from England, the West Indies, and Australia, which partly took place at Scarborough Beach in Perth, Australia.\n\nKnown For: Cricket and umpiring\n\nBorn in Bradford, Yorkshire, United Kingdom, Swindells worked for a post office after leaving school aged 15. He served with the Royal Air Force and held various jobs before training as a Primary school teacher. While in training he wrote his first novel, When Darkness Comes, which was published by Brockhampton Press of Leicester in 1973. He combined writing with teaching until 1980 when he took up writing full-time. He was still writing as of his 71st birthday (March 20, 2010).\n\nHe first won the Red House Children's Book Award with Brother in the Land (1984), a novel set in a post-apocalyptic world. Swindells was a supporter of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and is quoted as saying that the work \"... came out of my own anger and frustration ... you can't kill selectively with nuclear weapons, you wipe out millions of people ...\". He won three more Red House awards for Room 13 (1990), Nightmare Stairs (Short novel, 1998) and Blitzed (Younger readers, 2003).\n\nIn a 2010 by-election and in the 2011 local elections, Swindells stood as the Green Party of England and Wales candidate for the Worth Valley ward of Bradford City Council. In 2010, he took 11% of the vote, putting him in third place.\n\nKnown For: Author\n\nHenry Spencer Moore OM CH FBA (30 July 1898 – 31 August 1986) was an English sculptor and artist. He is best known for his abstract bronze sculptures which are located in various prominent public places. He became the most influential and famous sculptor of his generation. Henry Moore was born on 30 July, 1898, in Castleford, Yorkshire. He was the seventh child in a family of 8 children. His father worked in a colliery in Castleford but wanted his children to avoid working down the mines, so as much as possible given the family’s poverty, the children were educated at a local school. It was in his teenage years that he developed an interest and talent in art. This helped him to get a scholarship to Castleford Secondary school. Aged 18 he was called up to the army and in 1917 was injured during a gas attack at the Battle of Cambrai. After his injury, he spent the remainder of the war behind the line training new recruits. Moore later said the war was for him not a traumatic experience – unlike that of many of his contemporaries.\n\nAfter the war, he continued his education and in 1921 won a scholarship to study at the Royal College of Art. He didn’t regret his late opportunity to attend art school. He was a talented student, but already he was experimenting with new styles and this often conflicted with his teachers who were trying to teach the classic style – of perfection in form and composition. Moore was attracted to a more spontaneous art form with imperfections evident in the sculpting. In 1924, he spent time travelling in Italy and later Paris. Here he could view the great Masters such as Michelangelo and Giovanni Pisano. But, Moore was also influenced by his studies of primitive art, and at the Louvre he was particularly influenced by the Toltec-Maya sculptural form, the Chac Mool.\n\nOn his return to London, he took up a teaching post at the Royal College of art. This part time post enabled him to work on his own art, leading to his first commissions such as the West Wind – 1928-29. In the 1930s, Moore became an active member of the informal modern art movement, centred around the ideas and innovation of people like Pablo Picasso and Jean Arp. He also briefly flirted with the surrealist movement. The Second World War led to more traditional commissions and Moore worked as a war artist producing memorable pictures such as images of civilians fleeing the Blitz in the London underground. This helped Moore’s reputation and after the war led to numerous awards and opportunities in America. In 1948 he was awarded the International Sculpture Prize at the Venice Biennale. Significant commissions included. A reclining figure for UNESCO building in Paris 1956. A Nuclear energy sculpture at the University of Chicago. (to commemorate 25th anniversary of nuclear reaction) and Knife Edge – Two Piece in 1962 for College Green, London around Houses of parliament.\n\nIn 1972, Henry Moore established his Henry Moore Foundation – a charitable trust to promote art education and the support of young artists. He was a man of modest means. Despite his wealth and fame he lived frugally remembering his Yorkshire roots. He even turned down a knighthood in 1951 because he didn’t want to be seen as an establishment figure. Yet, during his lifetime he became one of the most influential sculptors of his generation.\n\nKnown For: Leading Sculptor and artist\n\nSir Michael Parkinson, CBE (born 28 March 1935) is an English broadcaster, journalist and author.

It specialises in the selling of clothing, home products and luxury food products. M&S was founded in 1884 by Michael Marks and Thomas Spencer in Leeds. In 1998, the company became the first British retailer to make a pre-tax profit of over £1 billion,\n\nThe company was founded by a partnership between Michael Marks, a Polish Jew from Słonim (Marks was born into a Polish-Jewish family, a Polish refugee living in the Russian Empire, now in Belarus), and Thomas Spencer, a cashier from the English market town of Skipton in North Yorkshire. On his arrival in England, Marks worked for a company in Leeds, called Barran, which employed refugees (see Sir John Barran, 1st Baronet). In 1884 he met Isaac Jowitt Dewhirst while looking for work. Dewhirst lent Marks £5 which he used to establish his Penny Bazaar on Kirkgate Market, in Leeds. Dewhirst also taught him a little English. Dewhirst's cashier was Tom Spencer, a bookkeeper, whose second wife, Agnes, helped improve Marks' English. In 1894, when Marks acquired a permanent stall in Leeds' covered market, he invited Spencer to become his partner.\n\nIn 1901 Marks moved to the Birkenhead open market where he amalgamated with Spencer. The pair were allocated stall numbers 11 & 12 in the centre aisle in 1903, and there they opened the famous Penny Bazaar. The next few years saw Michael Marks and Tom Spencer open market stalls in many locations around the North West of England and move the original Leeds Penny Bazaar to 20, Cheetham Hill Road, Manchester.\n\nKnown For: Selling clothes and gifts across the UK for over 100 years\n\nHenderson's Relish, known locally as Hendo's or 'Hendies' is a spicy and fruity condiment, similar in appearance to Worcestershire sauce, but contains no anchovies. It is essentially made of water, sugar and spirit vinegar with a selection of spices and colouring. Some adherents favour it due to its unique taste, and some out of regional loyalty. It was Henry Henderson who first began manufacturing his own special type of sauce back in the latter part of the 19th century. Originally manufactured at 35 Broad Lane in Sheffield, Henderson’s Relish is still being made and was in uninterrupted production within half a mile of the site from which the first bottle was filled until the move to a new food production factory in 2013.\n\nIt can be found in local fish and chip shops and almost every supermarket and grocers in the city, yet is almost unavailable anywhere outside South Yorkshire (although it can now be ordered online). The company has made little effort to market outside Yorkshire, instead preferring to encourage a loyal following nationally through this sense of exclusivity. Although often available throughout the UK, this has been due to the efforts of individual shops, and loyal Yorkshiremen smugglers, to obtain small quantities for their local clientele.\n\nIt is produced in Sheffield, South Yorkshire. The product's slogan is, \"Made in Sheffield for over a 100 years\". A gold-label version was produced to commemorate home girl Jessica Ennis winning the Heptathlon in the 2012 Olympics.\n\nKnown For: Being a spicy and fruity condiment, produced and sold in Sheffield\n\nLeon Pryce (born 9 October 1981 in Bradford) is an English professional rugby league footballer of Jamaican descent.
