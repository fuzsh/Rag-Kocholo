        "text": "When news of Henry Kissinger's death spread this week, many former world leaders lined up to pay tribute.\n\nFormer US President George W Bush said the US had \"lost one of the most dependable and distinctive voices on foreign affairs\".\n\nFormer UK Prime Minister Tony Blair described the ex-US secretary of state as an artist of diplomacy, who was motivated by \"a genuine love of the free world and the need to protect it\". Boris Johnson called Kissinger \"a giant of diplomacy and strategy - and peace-making\".\n\nBut peacemaker is not a term you're likely to hear many in Cambodia use when describing Henry Kissinger.\n\nDuring the Vietnam War, Kissinger and then-President Richard Nixon ordered clandestine bombing raids on neutral Cambodia, in an effort to flush out Viet Cong forces in the east of country.\n\nBen Kiernan, a historian at Yale University and a leading scholar on Cambodia, has estimated that around 500,000 tons of US bombs were dropped on Cambodia between 1969-1973.\n\nKissinger maintained that the bombing was aimed at the Vietnamese army inside Cambodia, not at the country itself.\n\nVorng Chhut, 76, had never heard the name Henry Kissinger when bombs started dropping down on his village in Svay Rieng province, near the Vietnamese border.\n\n\"Nothing was left, not even the bamboo trees. People escaped, while those who stayed in the village died,\" he said. \"A lot of people died, I can't count all their names. The bodies were swollen and when it became quiet, people would come and bury the bodies.\"\n\nA Pentagon report released in 1973 stated that \"Kissinger approved each of the 3,875 Cambodia bombing raids in 1969 and 1970\" as well as \"the methods for keeping them out of the newspapers\".\n\n\"It's an order, it's to be done. Anything that flies, on anything that moves. You got that?\" Kissinger told a deputy in 1970, according to declassified transcripts of his telephone conversations.\n\nThe number of people killed by those bombs is not known, but estimates range from 50,000 to upwards of 150,000.\n\nOne of the most notorious incidents was the accidental bombing of the small town of Neak Luong, where at least 137 Cambodians were killed and another 268 were wounded.\n\nA New York Times report by Sydney Schanberg, who was later portrayed in the film the Killing Fields, quoted a man called Keo Chan, whose wife and 10 children had just been killed.\n\n\"All my family is dead!\" he cried, beating his hand on the wooden bench where he had collapsed. \"All my family is dead! Take my picture, take my picture! Let the Americans see me!\"\n\nAnother man stood near an unexploded bomb in the town asked simply: \"When are you Americans going to take it away?\"\n\nUnexploded American bombs littered the Cambodian countryside, maiming and killing people for decades to come.\n\nMany also say that another consequence of Nixon and Kissinger's bombing campaign was that it helped pave the way for one of the worst genocides of the 20th century. Around 1.7 million people died at the hands of the Pol Pot-led Khmer Rouge between 1975 and 1979 - almost a quarter of the population.\n\nPrior to that, the ultra-communists had little support, but its ranks grew as American bombs fell.\n\nThe CIA's director of operations reported in 1973 the Khmer Rouge forces were successfully \"using damage by B-52 strikes as the main theme of their propaganda\".\n\nIn 2009, the first Khmer Rouge official to be tried for crimes committed under the regime's reign of terror told the UN-backed court: \"Mr Richard Nixon and Kissinger allowed the Khmer Rouge to grasp golden opportunities.\"\n\nKissinger always pushed back on criticism regarding the bombing of Cambodia.\n\n\"I just wanted to make clear that it was not a bombing of Cambodia, but it was a bombing of North Vietnamese in Cambodia,\" he said in 1973.\n\nWhen he was 90, he claimed bombs were only dropped on areas \"within five miles of the Vietnamese border that were essentially unpopulated\".\n\nElizabeth Becker, an American journalist who covered the bombing campaign in 1973, said this was not the case.\n\n\"First you interviewed the refugees as they were coming away from the bombing, then you'd go to the bombing and there were moonscapes - you'd see the corpses of buffalo, you'd see houses burned, the rice fields gutted,\" she told the BBC.\n\n\"You saw the destruction and you thought: why was this modern air force bombing the countryside so much? In those days the farmers of Cambodia weren't even used to seeing motor vehicles, they routinely said to me: 'Why is fire falling from the sky?'\"\n\nPen Yai, 78, cooperated with the Viet Cong inside Cambodia before the bombing started, but said large numbers of civilians were killed by American bombs, including his father and brother-in-law.\n\n\"I was so scared and could not sleep. People died everywhere. We just ran and recognised people who had been killed... we could not do anything,\" he said.\n\nMany world leaders have praised Kissinger, who shared the 1973 Nobel peace prize for his role in negotiating an end to the Vietnam war and was later handed the Presidential Medal of Freedom - America's highest civilian award.\n\nBut few who were in Cambodia in the 1970s will remember his legacy fondly.\n\nPrum Hen, 70, was forced to flee her village when American bombs started raining down. She said she knew little about Kissinger and felt little sympathy when informed of his death.\n\n\"Let him die because he killed a lot of our people,\" she said, adding that she still feels deep resentment towards the US."
