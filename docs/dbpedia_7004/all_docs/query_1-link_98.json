        "text": "On April 12, 1975, soon after Lon Nol, Cambodia's President, had fled the country, the United States withdrew its forces from the capital. Sydney Schanberg, then a New York Times correspondent, and Dith Pran, his Cambodian assistant, stayed on to cover the story of the battle-scarred country under the control of the Khmer Rouge and their leader, Pol Pot. Eight days after the evacuation, Dith Pran was forced, with hundreds of thousands of other Cambodians, to march from Phnom Penh to the countryside. There, he was to endure almost four years of unremitting horrors.\n\nIn late 1978, Vietnamese Communists invaded the country, which the Khmer Rouge had renamed Democratic Kampuchea. By early 1979, the Vietnamese had driven Pol Pot and his forces to the Thai-Cambodian border; millions of starving Cambodians fled from forced-labor camps. On Oct. 3, 1979, Dith Pran crossed the border into Thailand. His story was the basis for the movie ''The Killing Fields.''\n\nThis summer, Dith Pran, now a Times photographer, and seven other members of the Cambodia Documentation Commission, a human-rights organization, were invited by Prime Minister Hun Sen to visit Cambodia. This is Dith Pran's story of his return.\n\nI HAVE BEEN LIVING IN AMERICA SINCE OCT. 19, 1979. FOR MUCH of that time, I have had the same dream: I am a slave again in the Dam Dek labor camp in Pol Pot's Kampuchea. I see people brutally beaten with sticks. I am in my black pajamas, barefoot, working in the rice fields under the hot sun or pounding rain. I am being tortured and people are being arrested, their hands tied tightly behind them - I know they will be taken out to be killed and, terrified, I think, Will it be me next? Sometimes, fighting off the terror in my sleep, I throw out my arms and hit my wife, lying beside me. Often I talk in my sleep; sometimes I cry, and when my wife wakes me, I am still crying. When I wake and find I am in my bed in Brooklyn and not on a mat on the ground in Dam Dek, I am upset and angry, and I curse the Khmer Rouge.\n\nON AUG. 17, IN BRIGHT AND HUMID SUNSHINE, HANG KHONG (AIR) Vietnam's chartered flight from Bangkok to Phnom Penh lands at Pochentong International Airport. The Pol Pot years are far from my mind; I even stop thinking like a photographer. For the moment, I am once again a news assistant for The New York Times. The last time I saw the airport, in April 1975, it was under heavy rocket attack from the Khmer Rouge as the Americans pulled out; it was all smoke and noise and fear and confusion.\n\nI have looked forward to this day for years. The Khmer Rouge almost succeeded in destroying the country's traditional customs and culture, but since they were forced out 10 years ago, I have heard and read a lot about the slow revival of the time-honored way of life; so I am not worried about my personal safety. I have wanted to return to Cambodia to see my sister - the only close relative to survive the Khmer Rouge terror - and to hold a memorial service for my parents and other family members. My mother died two years ago. My father, a senior public-works official in former regimes, died of starvation when Pol Pot controlled the country. Three brothers (two were military officers in the Lon Nol Government; one was a student) and one sister (the wife of an officer) were killed by the Khmer Rouge.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
