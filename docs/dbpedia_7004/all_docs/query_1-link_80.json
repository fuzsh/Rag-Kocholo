        "text": "With over 150 international film awards to his name, the full scope of Arthur Dong’s storytelling mastery is brought to light in this Blu-ray collection of films that explore the Asian American experience. This illuminating anthology includes four films spanning over 30 years that showcase Dong’s historically acute focus on Asian Americans at the crossroads with Hollywood, pop culture, tradition, immigration, racism, and genocide. The Academy Award®-nominated short documentary Sewing Woman (1982) is based on the life of Dong’s mother, a bittersweet journey of one woman’s determination to survive: from an arranged marriage in old China to the working class comforts of America. Forbidden City, U.S.A. (1989) profi les the groundbreaking entertainers from the renowned all-Chinese Forbidden City Nightclub in 1940s San Francisco. Hollywood Chinese (2007) is a smart and lively look at the ways the Chinese have been imagined in the movies, from silent classics to contemporary blockbusters. The Killing Fields of Dr. Haing S. Ngor (2015) chronicles the journey of a Cambodian doctor from his imprisonment by the Khmer Rouge to a harrowing escape to America, and from his Academy Award®-winning performance in The Killing Fields (1985) to his mysterious murder in Los Angeles Chinatown."
