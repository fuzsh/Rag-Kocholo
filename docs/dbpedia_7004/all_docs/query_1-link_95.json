        "text": "\"So far, major studios haven’t moved on licensing video for AI training. Among other factors, a predominant fear among video publishers is that, by licensing, they will be contributing to the tech that replaces them in the market, which some have analogized to the early days of studios licensing high-value content to Netflix. Yet the reality remains that in the meantime, AI video models are being commercially and capably built through massive data scraping regardless of publisher participation and without their compensation, consent or credit. Recently, 404 Media reported on internal spreadsheets detailing Runway’s model training data, which included copyrighted material by major publishers and creators on YouTube and movie piracy sites. Davis would argue for licensing, since publishers can at least expect to negotiate fair compensation that becomes a new revenue stream. Perhaps more important, it can give publishers a collaborative voice in the way AI development proceeds and a greater ability to have at least some say in how their content is used, such as potential restrictions that an AI output won’t re-create an exact scene. “Everybody's concerned about AI and what it means for the future of creators. But the question is, Should we perpetuate a world where content is used without a license or compensation?” said Davis. “Or do we try to be a part of the conversation and change the outcome for producers and creators for the better by engaging?”\n\nExcited to announce my role as a consultant and advisor for Calliope Networks! It's fantastic to see founder Dave Davis and Calliope featured in Variety VIP+ as a leading supplier of video training data for technology companies. Calliope is tackling a critical challenge by providing responsible and innovative training data acquisition opportunities for those building generative models. They also offer a valuable monetization partnership for film, tv, and creator content library owners who provide their consent to enter into training deals. Let's address the elephant in the room: the dubious acquisition of training data. Much like piracy, this issue is best combated by building visible and reliable suppliers. As Steam creator and Valve co-founder Gabe Newell famously said, \"Piracy is a service problem.\" People, and hopefully technology companies, are willing to pay for things if there's a convenient way to do so. Calliope Networks is that reliable supplier. If you're a tech company building generative image, video, or world simulation models, Calliope offers a legitimate and high-quality source for licensing training data.

In their latest documentary, 'What Jennifer Did,' the producers used an AI-generated photo to fill gaps where original photographic content was unavailable. Without any disclosure, this manipulation involved enhancing an image to depict a happy Jennifer Pan, resulting in a noticeable misshapen hand. Artificial intelligence is a powerful tool. It can create stunning visuals, automate tedious tasks, and even predict our preferences. But when it comes to creating content, where do we draw the line? Netflix chose to use a photo created by an AI in a DOCUMENTARY, not a work of fiction. No one was harmed in the creation of this photo. No copyright laws were broken. Yet, it feels like a line has been crossed. Why? Because documentaries hinge on authenticity and factual accuracy. They are trusted to show us the 'real' world. An AI-generated image, while visually compelling, is fundamentally synthetic. Using such content without clear disclosure not only misleads viewers but also dilutes the integrity of factual storytelling. It’s about keeping the audience in the know. Transparency is key, and viewers deserve to understand what they’re seeing and its origins. It’s not just about a photo. It's about authenticity, transparency, and distinguishing the real from the fabricated. At the very least, the picture should have been labeled 'AI-Generated'. What do you think? Are you OK with What Netflix Did?\n\nAs the AI debate rolls on, there are a couple things we continue to believe and support as a creative production agency producing social-first, digitally native campaigns for some of the world's most celebrated brands... ✅ AI has an incredible ability as a tool to speed up and scale production, but... ✅Without putting that powerful tool into the hands of artists with an equally powerful vision, the outcome will lack authenticity and relevance... So the question isn't which will win out, (Artist or AI), but rather how do we successfully pair the two together to ensure authenticity AND efficiency for our clients?"
