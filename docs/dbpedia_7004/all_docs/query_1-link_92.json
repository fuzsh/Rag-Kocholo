        "meta_description": "When Dr. Haing S. Ngor was forced into labor camps by the Khmer Rouge, little did he know he would escape years of torture and recreate his experiences in a film that would win him an Academy Award®. \"The Killing Fields of Dr. Haing S. Ngor\" tells the dramatic story about arguably the most recognizable survivor of the Cambodian genocide, a man who became a worldwide ambassador for justice in his homeland, only to be murdered in a Los Angeles Chinatown alley - a case still muddled with conspiracy theories. Through an inspired blend of original animation and rare archival material - anchored by Ngor's richly layered autobiography - the years encapsulating the Khmer Rouge's tyrannical rule over Cambodia are experienced though a politically charged transnational journey of loss and reconciliation.",

        "text": "\"I have been many things in life. A trader walking barefoot on paths through the jungle. A medical doctor driving to his clinic in a shiny Mercedes. In the past few years, to the surprise of many people, and above all myself, I have been a Hollywood star and actor. But nothing has shaped my life as much as surviving the Pol Pot regime. I am a survivor of the Cambodian holocaust. That's who I am.\"\n\nA necessary companion to The Killing Fields, directed by Arthur Dong and available on Criterion Channel until the end of March. His documentary focuses almost entirely on Dr. Haing S. Ngor's survival in Khmer Rouge-run Cambodia during the mid-to-late 70s, during which time he…\n\nDr. Haing Ngor described his incredible story and experiences best himself in this documentary.\n\n\"The Killing Fields\" adaptation film he starred in just 5 years after surviving the Khmer Rouge would always be a somewhat palatable version of what actually happened. He describes harrowing torture and malnutrition, witnessing people die, including his wife. For the film, he relived the same emotions - having to say goodbye to loved ones, pleading for his life.\n\nBut being a Hollywood star ultimately didn't mean much to him. He did everything in his power to help Cambodian people; setting up jobs for refugees in America, making public speeches and empowering those who were still living in the refugee camps.\n\nAfter all he went through,…\n\nWhere To Watch: available June 25, 2024; pre-order your copy here: www.kinolorber.com or amzn.to/3z4uo6B\n\nRAVING REVIEW: Arthur Dong's ASIAN AMERICAN STORIES is a captivating Blu-ray collection that beautifully encapsulates the rich and diverse experiences of Asian Americans through four distinctive films: HOLLYWOOD CHINESE, SEWING WOMAN, FORBIDDEN CITY U.S.A., and THE KILLING FIELDS OF DR. HAING S. NGOR. Spanning over three decades, this unintentional anthology highlights Dong's keen historical insights and storytelling ability, which have earned him over 150 international film awards.\n\nKicking off the collection is HOLLYWOOD CHINESE, a thought-provoking documentary that delves into the portrayal of Chinese individuals in Hollywood films. Dong expertly dissects the stereotypes that have haunted Chinese characters, from the silent era to contemporary blockbusters. The…\n\nCame for a documentary on the life of Haing S. Ngor and in the process, I was rewarded with one of the best and historically accurate documentaries on the Khmer Rouge regime I've ever seen (and I've seen quite a few of them in my time). In previous films on the subject, the documentaries are usually plagued with a western bias which tend to focus on \"the new life\" provided to the refugees after being given refuge in their new countries. Instead, in this documentary, Arthur Dong's team was able to gather and present incredible archival footage, together with original animation sequences to bring to life the stories of Haing S. Ngor, with moving narration provided by his autobiography. The…"
