        "text": "Drew's innocence and morality is truly displayed when he is the only one among these four men who wants to report the death of the local man to the police. He does not want to be part of any wrong; however, he is given no heed due to the immorality of the others. Here comes into play the parallelism of this novel to the occurrence of the Vietnam War. For in the Vietnam War, all common moralities and values were thrown away to fit the environment in which we were fighting. Here, all the men except Drew disregard the morals of the civilized world to survive in this unfamiliar territory where they have willingly placed themselves. That may be one reason that Drew is the one to be shot and drowned alone and later discovered: he dies because he cannot survive - it is, in essence, the survival of the fittest. Here is another parallel to the Vietnam era in that Drew's death is used as a lie and as an excuse. His death is used as a cover up, an event occurring often during the war. Because he is the moral central of the group, his death is a deep loss. It is a loss because Drew is the best of them all; he is the most genuine.\n\nBetween the years of 1975 and 1979, an estimated 1.5 to 3 million people were killed by the Khmer Rouge during the Cambodian genocide. First They Killed My Father is the story from the perspective of a five year old girl, Loung Ung, and how her life was changed by the Khmer Rouge. Her and her family were forced out of their home, and into labor camps where they were to work for food in order to survive. They relied on each other, and pushed through the Hell that they were unfortunately placed into. In the memoir, First They Killed My Father by Loung Ung, the author demonstrates how the Khmer Rouge use the techniques of confiscation, dress regulations, and food rations in order to remain in control of the citizens.\n\nThe sewage field that Kiowa died in was very graphic at times because O’Brien used lots of imagery to describe it. As a whole, the field represented the worst parts of the war. It consumed whoever entered it and eventually took O’Brien’s best friend. It came full circle when later in life, he returned to the exact same field and buried Kiowa’s moccasins in the marshland. Metaphors and comparisons are extremely important to the flow of the work and how each story is connected with each other.\n\nLater that same year, Pot and the Khmer Rouge took control over Cambodia. Pot wasted no time in starting his mission to reconstruct Cambodia. He thought that all the educated people needed to be killed (Melicharova). Also he thought that all noncommunist aspects of Cambodia needed to be wiped out. All rights you had were now gone. Religion was banned and if you were any kind of leader among the Buddhist monks, you were killed instantly (Melicharova). All kids were taken away and sent to work in the fields (Melicharova). If anyone was currently working and had a job, they were immediately killed along with their family members. It got so bad that you could be killed for just laughing, crying, and knowing another language. The Khmer Rouge motto was “To spare you is no profit, to destroy you is no loss” (Melicharova). If you were lucky enough to escape death, you were put into the fields working usually from 4am to 10pm unpaid (“Pol”). From lack of food and sleep, people often became very ill which sadly led to death.\n\nIn 1975, The Khmer Rouge became the ruling political party of Cambodia after overthrowing the Lon Nol government. Following their leader Pol Pot, the Khmer Rouge imposed an extreme form of social engineering on Cambodian society. They wanted to form an anti-modern, anti-Western ideal of a restructured “classless agrarian society'', a radical form of agrarian communism where the whole population had to work in collective farms or forced labor projects. The Khmer Rouge revolutionary army enforced this mostly with extreme violence. The book “First They Killed My Father: A Daughter of Cambodia Remembers”, written by Luong Ung, is the author’s story of growing up during this time period. She was five years old when the Khmer Rouge came\n\nExternal conflict is an essential part of any text, as it provides a foundation for the plot. The use of external conflict can be seen in A Long Way Home when Saroo gets lost and must survive on the rough streets of Calcutta. Calcutta, the third largest city in India, was filled with danger. Saroo had many brushes with death, such as when he was taken in by a railroad worker who eventually tried to kidnap him. Saroo clearly remembers hiding is a sewage pipe to narrowly escape his pursuers, surviving another day homeless and alone (Brierley 76-79). Saroo’s experiences on the streets of Calcutta and the journey of losing his family have greatly affected his identity. These memories remain with Saroo and made him who he is today. These experiences also gave Saroo great emotional strength and awareness of his privilege gained\n\nLastly, good did triumph over evil in Sydney Carton. Sydney Carton is a drunk who hates Darnay because if Carton was not a drunk he would have everything Darnay has, like the love of Lucie Manette. Carton is seen as the darkness because of the disparity he has and how low he has fallen. Whereas Darnay is seen as light or the good guy due to how his life is going. In the end when Sydney gives up his life for Darnay it shows how Sydney is transferring from being sad and dark. His selfless act proved that the “bad” Sydney Carton has saved Darnay and kept Lucie, Cartons love, happy.\n\nThe story is set in Panem. It consists of 13 districts. It is run totalitarian dictatorship.There are strict norms practiced in this locality. Norms are the accepted standards of behavior for any given group. The basic norms of this society include obedience and sacrifice. This society can also be called a total institution. A total institution is a place of residence where similarly situated people, cut off from the wider community lead an enclosed, formally administered life together. In the movie, it is shown that the people of panem are not allowed to migrate out of the districts, and thus are cut off from the larger society. People do not oppose this system as they are taught to live in this way. In this society uprisings are prevented through primary and secondary socialization. Primary socialization is when a child learns appropriate values and actions. Children are taught to live and think a certain way. They are introduced to the basic norms and values since a young age. Other form of\n\nThe plot of the novel revolves around the mystery of a murder in a town of racism and injustice. This plot can be drawn back and related to the setting of the story; Australia’s 1960s which overflowed with racial injustice and favour of white Australians. Silvey was able to unveil the narrow mindedness, racial inequality and injustice of Australia’s society in the past, leading to the malicious treatment of countless ethnic groups, including Australian Aborigines, through his plot. Jasper Jones, Silvey’s mixed race teen character, and Jeffrey Lu, Silvey’s Vietnamese teen character, are both victim to racial discrimination throughout the story, leading to their constant struggles whilst living their lives in an Australian town that only appreciates and favours White Australians. The involvement of racial prejudice, discrimination and murder in the plot of the novel play a significant role in showcasing the Australian history and its uniqueness. It also serves to advance the plot as well as its character’s nature and attitudes. The plot, overall, projects fundamental moral questions of the teenage boys, representing the experience of being raised either intelligent, poor, Asian or indigenous in rural\n\nYou don’t know where the next shot is coming from and you can never relax because the pacing of the movie comes like a tidal wave of dread. An interesting creative decision here is that even though this is clearly WWII and we know who the enemy is, you never see a single German soldier, not even a Nazi Germany flag is present. The closest you get to an enemy is the aerial assault from many jets fighter. The absence of a physical enemy, it doesn’t affect this survival film one bit, if anything it strikes up more paranoia keeping the audience uneasy the way through."
