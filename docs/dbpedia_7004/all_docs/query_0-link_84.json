        "text": "(plaintive flute music) - [James] Inside the once majestic country of Cambodia, after a decade of war, history witnessed the collapse of the horrific Khmer Rouge regime.\n\nIt would end one of the worst genocides the world has ever seen.\n\n(taut piano music) This memorial helps to ensure that the world never forgets those who died during the years of Cambodia's killing fields.\n\n(mellow piano music) If there's more to the story, there is the untold episode of the fate of thousands of these survivors who sought refuge inside Thailand.\n\n(mellow piano music) (light flicks) This is my father, Bunseng Taing, in a refugee camp in 1980.\n\nI knew since my childhood that my father was a survivor of the killing fields, but I was shocked to learn that he and many thousands of others faced a more terrifying atrocity, the massacre on the Temple Mountain called Preah Vihear.\n\n- And my son, James, he never give up.\n\nHe always push me to tell him the story.\n\nAnd I always say to him, I said, \"I don't want to relive again, just don't, you know.\"\n\nSo he just say, \"Well, just just tell me one time.\"\n\nSo that' how we get here to do the documentary.\n\n(pensive music) (somber music) (bird screeching) When I was a child, I never thought that I would leave the country.\n\nWhen I was in Cambodia, we had a great time before Pol Pot came.\n\nWe are playing ping pong, soccer, and playing games and go out with the friends.\n\n(boy laughing) I was the youngest of eight children.\n\nMy family was very close.\n\nMy dream was have a piece of land, build my own house with a pond, and raise my own animals, and have lots of kids.\n\n(dreamy music) The market in Cambodia was full of good food.\n\nNo one was starving before the war.\n\n(vehicle engines roaring) My childhood, we were living outside of Phnom Penh.\n\nPhnom Penh was a very modern city.\n\n(dreamy music) - Growing up in Phnom Penh, I lived somewhat of a Western life, with refrigerator and TV.\n\n- [James] Though Thida Buth Mam and my father met only recently, her story parallels his in many ways.\n\n(mellow music) - At that time, TV was turning from black and white to color, and rock and roll came in.\n\nSo, I was exposed to the English language at a very early age.\n\nI grew up with Mick Jagger and the Beatles, as well as the Cambodian music scene.\n\nAnd then the war came in, and the war really stopped life for me.\n\n- In cooperation with the Armed Forces of South Vietnam, attacks are being launched this week to clean out major enemy sanctuaries on the Cambodian Vietnam border.\n\nThis is not an invasion of Cambodia.\n\n(plane engines whining) (bombs exploding) - [James] This began years of intense bombing campaigns.\n\nFrom 1970 to 1973, the United States dropped more bombs in Cambodia's heartland than were dropped in Japan during the Second World War.\n\nIt was equivalent to five Hiroshimas.\n\n- [Bunseng] To escape from the bombing, my family fled west to the countryside near the Thai border.\n\n- [James] The American bombing caused enormous instability, enabling the communist Khmer Rouge, once a small faction, to gain power.\n\nIts leader, Pol Pot, envisioned an agrarian revolution.\n\n(crowd chanting) (guns exploding) (engines roaring) It aimed to wipe out everything he determined to be modern.\n\n(people clamoring) When the country fell to the Khmer Rouge in 1975, its army purged the cities and committed atrocities on an unbelievable scale.\n\n(guns firing) (indistinct chattering) - When we were forced out of Phnom Penh, my father told me, \"Everything is gonna be okay.\"\n\nAnd that's the last time I remember my father.\n\n(indistinct chattering) - [James] Seven million people were forced into labor camps.\n\n(men grunting) - They told us, \"This is your place.\n\nYou gotta build your own house and you gotta grow your own things to feed yourself.\"\n\nWhen my father got sick, I tried to go and go to visit him.\n\nAnd I got captured by the Khmer Rouge and I was tortured for 40 days.\n\n- It is all mass killing, and they take all our food, so we were starving.\n\nNo medical care, so people were just dying from all that.\n\n- [James] Between 1975 and 1979, 1/3 of Cambodia's population was either executed or tortured and starved to death.\n\nThe genocide would become known as the Killing Fields.\n\n(ominous music) - The Khmer Rouge were killing off all the people from the city, and was coming close to my village, and they stopped.\n\nThe reason was there was a coup d'etat in Phnom Penh.\n\n- [James] On Christmas day, 1978, communist Vietnamese troops invaded Phnom Penh, forcing Pol Pot out of power.\n\n(truck engines roaring) In the chaos that followed, forsaking and starving Cambodians fled to the border with neighboring Thailand.\n\n(engines roaring) - [Thida] We have to make the escape because the chance of surviving in another communist regime is very low for all of us.\n\n- After the concentration camp, I reunited with my father and my father told me that we have to get out the country right away because we don't know the situation in the country, we have to get out now.\n\n- We make an ox cart (laughs).\n\nWe make our own wheel from scratch.\n\nWe prepare this for a three-month journey.\n\n(wheels clacking) - [James] As refugees began to mass on the border of Thailand, a group of frontline international aid workers scrambled to help.\n\n(chattering in foreign language) - We were disappointed there wasn't more public outcry.\n\nI mean, this was a major human rights violation.\n\n(indistinct chattering) With just us trying to whip the Western press into some attention on this, the Thai press covered it, if at all, barely.\n\n- [James] After this period, the Thai government worried the Vietnamese agents would penetrate their borders.\n\nWithout adequate assistance to manage the stampede, they were reluctant to allow refugees across into Thailand.\n\n- The US was, and it was sitting empty-handed.\n\nYou know, well, we didn't have a large refugee program.\n\n- [James] Lionel sought help from Macalan Thompson, who had been working with refugees from Laos and Vietnam.\n\n- [Macalan] The spring of 1979, you know, sort of doubled up the problems on the Thai government, with all these very large numbers of people coming in, illegal aliens, and essentially starving.\n\nIt'll look like people, you know, coming right out of Auschwitz.\n\nWhat are they going to do with them?\n\n(indistinct) As many of them as many died on the way.\n\n- [James] By the time my father made it to the border, the Thai government had agreed to allow some survivors to be brought into makeshift border camps.\n\n- We escaped that day with thousands of people that poured into the border.\n\n(children laughing) And I remember before they put us in the camp, they bring the trucks to the border and help us get on the trucks.\n\nAnd the truck drove through the city of Aranyaprethet.\n\nAnd it's the first time that we saw electricity and we are so happy we all threw our fist up to the air.\n\nIt's freedom, it's freedom, it's freedom.\n\n- [Thida] And we couldn't believe our luck.\n\nOur spirit was high, we were hopeful.\n\nI mean, we have been cut off from the world for four and a half years.\n\n(mellow flute music) - So, we make it to the refugee camp.\n\nSurrounding it a barbed wire.\n\n(mellow flute music) But one of the best times that I had with my family.\n\nWe feel that we're not being killed or starving again.\n\nAnd every day we enjoy every moment at the refugee camp there.\n\nWe playing music.\n\nWe talk to friend.\n\nWe talk about the past and about the new future.\n\n(rhythmic gongs music) (indistinct chattering) (somber music) - [James] By June of 1979, the Thai government became impatient with the pace of Western action, and threatened to force refugees back into Cambodia.\n\n- As the population along the border grew, the Thai became increasingly apprehensive.\n\n- None of us could get round the fact that this was becoming a very inconvenient problem for our political masters.\n\nIt was, you know, showing no signs of abating.\n\nThe numbers are massing on the border in the border camps.\n\n- Very rapidly, when it became evident that this was gonna be a major humanitarian disaster, people came forward and were mobilized very quickly, but it was not a pretty sight.\n\n(truck engines roaring) - There was resettlement going on.\n\nBuses would come, people would leave, but even then you weren't sure they'd be processed.\n\nYou didn't know where they would go or what would become of them.\n\nAnd for most of the people, they didn't know if they were gonna get resettled.\n\nThey lived with constant anxiety over this.\n\nAnd we also didn't know.\n\nIn fact, we were being told that everybody was gonna be pushed back to Cambodia, you know, any day now.\n\n(indistinct chattering) - We were out there constantly, trying to identify those closest to the US and send them off to other camps away from the border.\n\n- [James] My father's happy interlude in the border camp were short-lived.\n\n(man on megaphone speaks in foreign language) - [James] One day, rescue workers arrive with buses, (indistinct) calling out names.\n\n(chattering in foreign language) (speaks in foreign language) - [Translator] Some Muslim Cham people came down to say goodbye to us.\n\nThen we were celebrating with them by saying the Buddhist expression, let it be.\n\nMay they reach their destination with happiness.\n\nThen after that, they departed with the buses one after another.\n\nWe were thinking, \"Oh, when will be our turn to leave?\"\n\n(child wailing) (indistinct chattering) (bus engine roaring) - June 12 or 13 early in the morning, I remember the bus arrived at alongside refugee camp, and the Western people came with microphone on their hand and they call people by name to get on the buses.\n\n(indistinct chattering) - The scene was just tension-filled from the time we arrived that morning.\n\n(bus engine roars) - And they keep calling, and then more and more people get in the bus.\n\n(people clamoring) - Refugees were surging towards the front of this enclosure.\n\n- And I keep waiting for my name being called.\n\n- [Lionel] And we would try to call out the names, but it was very chaotic.\n\nWe only had about three hours to do this.\n\nBy midday, we were told we had to finish.\n\nIn fact, several times, the Thai would say, \"You're done.\"\n\nWe'd say, \"No, we just need a few more minutes.\"\n\n(horn honking) - The Thai soldier came down and shut them down and pushed them out of the refugee camp, not allow them to call the name anymore and they closed the gate.\n\n(vehicle engine roaring) - [James] After permitting the relief workers to relocate just a few thousand refugees, Thai soldiers cut off the rescue and forced a desperate mob, my father among them, back into the camp.\n\n(vehicle engine roaring) - The next day, we heard a rumor that those people being forced back to the border.\n\n(speaking in foreign language) - [Translator] After just one day, they came to us.\n\nThe Thai soldiers came with the bus and said that we can go to a third country now.\n\n- They told us \"You're going to Bangkok, to a refugee camp in Bangkok.\"\n\nSo there's this mixed feeling of fear and happiness, we don't know.\n\n(tank engine roaring) - We knew something was going on.\n\nAll these buses were carrying refugees away from the camps somewhere we didn't know where.\n\n- We told them that if you send us back, we gonna be get killed by the Khmer Rouge.\n\nWe just ran to the corner, crying, beg them not to send us back.\n\nAbout 2,000 us, children and old, we are human-chained to each order, that we refuse to get on the bus.\n\nWe won't get on the bus, doesn't matter what.\n\nEven if they will kill us, we gonna be dying here.\n\n(indistinct chattering) They grabbed the little baby and the children out of their mothers' arm and threw them on the buses.\n\nSo, when their children got on the buses, the parent automatically get on the buses.\n\nAnd they kicked us.\n\nThey beat us up.\n\nWe had no choice but to get the buses.\n\n(man speaks on megaphone in foreign language) - I saw some people that they put their hand up to here, that you're being killed, you know.\n\nAnd I saw a couple Westerners and they are crying and crying.\n\nThey tried to help us, but they've no way to get to help us.\n\nWe were terrified inside the bus because we don't know where they're taking us.\n\nAnd we still have hope that they maybe tell us the truth that they transfer us to a different camp.\n\n(bus engine roaring) The bus drove us 14 hour, 14 hours that night until early in the morning.\n\n- [Lionel] What happened was they had about several tens of thousands of refugees scattered in various camps along the Cambodian Thai border, and the Thai government, for some reason, decided that it was going to push these people back to Cambodia.\n\nThey were tired of them, whatever.\n\nThey gathered together about 42,000 of them, took 'em to this temple on top of a mountain on the border called Preah Vihear, and pushed them down the cliff.\n\n(ominous music) - [Bunseng] And when we got there, we don't know where we are, and they forced us out from the bus at gun point and they told us where to go.\n\nAnd we found out that we are on top of the mountain called Preah Vihear Mountain.\n\n(engine roaring) - [James] Almost four decades later, I accompany my father and my uncle to visit what remains at the site of the Preah Vihear Massacre.\n\n- It's very difficult to walk through here.\n\nWe follow the track that everybody went.\n\nOn the top of the mountain, the Thai soldiers told us that whatever we have, water, monies, gold, valuables, just give it to them.\n\nAnd they say, \"You're not gonna need it down there.\"\n\nJust drop it in the bucket and give it to them.\n\nAnd you can see the cliff is so steep down.\n\nAnd they keep gunning us down.\n\nWe had no way to get down.\n\nWe had to hold, (sobs) hold a vine to lower ourselves down, (sobbing) cliff by cliff.\n\n(speaks in foreign language) - [Translator] When we helped the old people, they fell down.\n\nThey crashed into the branches.\n\nIn agony, they dropped all the things they carried with them, and they abandoned a lot of their belongings there.\n\nThat night, every five minutes we heard boom.\n\n(gun fires) And everyone was crying.\n\nPeople appeared with blood all over their body, some of their eyeballs falling out, broken skulls, screaming, looking for their mother and father.\n\n- You know, I lived through the Khmer Rouge.\n\nI thought that was bad, but that night was the worst night of my life.\n\n(mimics machine gun fire) And I hear the bullet go through my ear, like (swooshing) right behind from my ears.\n\nAnd I saw a little girl in front of me, the bullet hit her head and she collapsed.\n\nI hold onto my mom's hand.\n\nAnd my thought was, at least we die together as a family.\n\nThey want us to walk on those landmine, and then very few survive.\n\nAnd it would make a good lesson that we will never come back to Thailand.\n\nThey want to kill as many refugee as they can.\n\nSo, walking 40,000 refugee through the deepest mountain, with no water and with gun behind us, that's one way to kill people.\n\nAnd they don't have to open fire because the landmine will do the job.\n\n- The brush is so thick.\n\n(plane whirring) We heard the planes, the sound of planes flying through.\n\n(sniffles) We thought someone come to help us.\n\n43,000 refugee cry out, (sniffling) for help (sobbing).\n\nBut no one come for us (sobs).\n\n- The border soldiers call it ghost mountain because they hear the cries of children at night.\n\nThe soldiers say there are lots of bodies down in that area where they can't bring us.\n\n- [Bunseng] And the landmines still there.\n\nThat's why we can't get there.\n\n- [James] So we've been finding more and more of the stuff.\n\nAnd the ground here, the clothes, the plates that we just saw, and then they pick up a few bones here and there.\n\n- This is a bone that one of the refugees that die here.\n\n(woman speaks in foreign language) - [Translator] There's no road going down.\n\nWe throw our clothes first, and then hold onto the vines.\n\nWe're afraid to sleep at night, anywhere except on the tracks we're walking on.\n\n(speaks in foreign language) - [Translator] My in-law told us not to go anywhere.\n\nDon't go anywhere.\n\nIf you move, a mine will explode.\n\nYou poop there.\n\nYou cook there.\n\nYou sleep there.\n\n(gun fires) (speaks in foreign language) - [Translator] Everyone was falling.\n\nAll of us fell to the ground.\n\nAnd then in a moment, I gained my consciousness.\n\nI saw blood on my hands.\n\nAll here was broken, my right and my left.\n\n- [Bunseng] This might be a blanket, you know.\n\nFor the UN gave it to us.\n\nSometimes we used that to cover the body because the body is all here.\n\nWrap the body and just let it sit and rot it.\n\n(speaks in foreign language) - [Translator] When my wife and daughter died, I couldn't take the bodies with us because I was injured.\n\nI couldn't walk.\n\nMy arm was hit by a landmine.\n\nMy nephew carried me, put me on a rice bag hammock, carried me and took a month with no food.\n\nAt the place where my wife was struck by landmines, 14 people died.\n\n(speaks in foreign language) - [Translator] The strong men that carried rice and carried supplies, ran to seek water to cook rice and other things.\n\nThen the landmines exploded.\n\nAnd when it exploded, they all died.\n\nAnd the people that didn't have food ran to grab the bloody rice off of the dead bodies, just to have something to eat.\n\nThey had to wash the blood off the rice and cook it.\n\n- Thousands of refugee passed through here, 13,000 lost their lives.\n\nThis is all they left behind.\n\n(sobbing) I lived through Pol Pot for almost four years.\n\nI was detained, put in a concentrate camp, tortured.\n\nBut To live through Preah Vihear for that three months time is worse, worse than you could even imagine.\n\nFor 30 something year, I still have a nightmare, night after night.\n\nSomehow that nightmare never go away.\n\nIt just keep coming back.\n\n(birds chirping) My father and I walked through the jungle for three months.\n\nWhen we got on a small city, I found my brother, Chiv, and we settled down.\n\nAnd my father keep telling me that you have to leave and go back and escape again.\n\nI said, \"How could I escape again, I mean, after all we lived through and been through?\"\n\nMy father said, \"You're still young.\n\nYou still have opportunity.\n\nIt's not safe to be here.\"\n\nAnd I say, \"What about you?\"\n\nHe said, \"Just leave.\"\n\nSo, I was very upset when he want me to leave him.\n\nAnd I left him without, (sobs) without saying goodbye to him.\n\n(melancholic music) Well, we escaped back into Thailand three months later.\n\nFortunately this time, I got rescued.\n\n(melancholic music) The Western person that come and rescued me, put me in a minivan.\n\nAnd when the minivan drove away from the campsite, I broke down.\n\nI never cried hard in my life, that I was safe.\n\nAnd a month later, I received a letter from my brother that my father passed away (sobs).\n\n- This time, they took me to a legal refugee camp called Buriram.\n\n(laughing) And when we reached Buriram, we celebrate, because now we are legal refugee.\n\nAnd to me, that was a gift.\n\nTo me, that was a second life.\n\nSo, I made it.\n\n(birds chirping) (metal clanking) - [Bunseng] Today, I'm a painter.\n\nI have more than I can imagine.\n\nAnd I kind of like to become a painter because I able to travel to different places, meet different people, and sit back and look at the work that I've done, and I take pride in what I did.\n\nOne thing that I wished for for many years was to be able to say thank you to the people who saved me.\n\nI did not know their name.\n\n- [James] One day while painting a house, that wish came true.\n\nAnd the seed for this film was sown.\n\nIt turned out that the homeowner was renovating the house for his stepfather, Bob Devecchi.\n\n- Doug came into the room, and introduced me to Bunseng.\n\n- And I'm shaking (laughs).\n\nI said, that's the man that I'm looking for for all these years.\n\nI meet my hero.\n\n(both laugh) - [Emcee] Cultural values are the core principles- - [James] My father, mother, uncles, and aunts have come a long way from the killing fields.\n\n(indistinct chattering) While they take pride in passing on their culture, they are most proud to call themselves American.\n\n- [Emcee] Ladies and gentlemen, once again a big hand for them, please.\n\n(people clapping) Thank you.\n\nHappy New Year, you guys.\n\n(people clapping) (indistinct chattering) - When I'm in Cambodia, I talk to a lot of young people and I always ask them, I say, \"Did you hear about the pushback of the refugees on Preah Vihear Mountain?\"\n\nNine out of 10, none of them know about it.\n\nThey never heard about it.\n\n(children talking in chorus) All those educated people was killed and the country just started over again now.\n\nAnd it will take a long time to catch up through the other world.\n\n(indistinct chattering) (plaintive flute music) - We'd been through so much together in the mountain.\n\nAnd you want me to leave you again.\n\nBut now I know why.\n\nI have children of my own, I know how much you loved me.\n\nAnd please forgive me, I didn't say goodbye to you.\n\n(birds chirping) (melancholic music) - There are human stories behind every statistic and it's important we don't fall into the trap of believing that when you're into the millions, you're just into statistics, not stories.\n\nThe real ideal is that the world gets better at peacemaking and peacekeeping.\n\nAnd we should never forget that every refugee crisis is a political failure, because that's essentially what war and conflict is.\n\n- I think there was a strong feeling of guilt in Washington that at least we had to take care of those people who had been the most deeply affected.\n\nAnd we tried very hard to save them.\n\nWe failed.\n\n- A refugee would like to have your problems.\n\nAnd (laughs) you know, it's a good thing to remember, when worrying about any number of things in your daily life, how it looks to a refugee and what it's like.\n\nThese people have nothing.\n\nI mean, nothing.\n\nOn the one hand, the incredible horror, and on the other hand, their incredible spirit.\n\nYou know, and I remember I felt it made me stronger because for the first time, I knew what human beings were capable of, of getting through, you know, in a way that I'd never known that.\n\nAnd that gave me encouragement as well.\n\n- We saw this refugee issue at such scale, and our laws and our policy were not up to date to accommodate it.\n\nAnd I think that forced an introspection in the United States about our attitudes toward immigration, generally, and refugees, specifically.\n\n- We clear around Preah Vihear Temple.\n\nWe have cleared up there several times.\n\nThe K5 mine belt runs right through that area.\n\nAnd we're blowing someone up every three days.\n\nThe Vietnam War didn't end.\n\nIt's still here.\n\nCambodia has one of the most dense mine fields in the world, around the Thai border.\n\nThese are the ones that would be around Preah Vihear, probably the PMN mine.\n\nThe PMN-2 is this green mine right here.\n\nThis is probably the second most common mine in Cambodia.\n\nThat one is being laid along the Turkish border in Syria right now.\n\n- I was remembering feeling so sad that all I had was this plastic bag full of scraps of paper with names and pleas for help.\n\nIf we'd known they were being sent back to a minefield, we probably would've stepped in front of the buses or something, but a terribly brutal, tragic thing to have done.\n\nAnd it was only later that we began to realize from people who had not gone down, that they heard the cries of others, or few people actually made it from the minefields back up the cliffs.\n\nAnd we began to learn as we got permission to rescue survivors that this tragic event had occurred.\n\n- Before you go- - Yeah.\n\n- [Bunseng] Just want to show you the picture.\n\n- Oh.\n\n- This is a two family that you saved from the mountain.\n\n- That means a lot to me.\n\n- Yeah.\n\nSo, I like to thank myself, in behalf of them, and a lot of people that, people like you.\n\n- Thank you.\n\nThank you.\n\nIt makes my life very happy to know that you still remember, to know what we did.\n\nThis is the kind of concrete example that we never had time to appreciate during that time.\n\nAnd I only came because I knew your story from James.\n\n- Yeah, I appreciate that.\n\nIt took me a long time to find someone to help me to do this.\n\n- Well, we helped each other.\n\nI wouldn't have come today to go through this.\n\nThis is my reward.\n\nGave me a big reward.\n\n- Thank you very much.\n\n- Thank you so much.\n\nAnd the pride of your family and your son, who's carrying your memories forward, who wants to understand what happened and how he got here.\n\n- Yeah, yeah.\n\nWithout me, without your help, he wouldn't be here, that's what.\n\n- It's true, it's true.\n\nAnd many, many others would give you this, to say keep coming back to this team of mine.\n\nSome very dedicated people.\n\nBut thank you.\n\n- Thank you.\n\n- We always said the refugees, when they resettle, will be a credit.\n\nHere's just another example.\n\nYou've proven it.\n\nSo, thank you.\n\n- Thank you.\n\n- My pleasure, as I say, wouldn't come without you.\n\n- Oh, thank you for coming.\n\n- Thank you.\n\nWell, thank you.\n\nIt's almost like we rehearsed this, but we didn't.\n\n(all laughing) I didn't know you were gonna do that.\n\nThank you."
