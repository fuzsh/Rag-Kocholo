        "text": "Live updates: Follow the latest on Israel-Gaza\n\nThe World Central Kitchen (WCK) on Thursday said one of its members working in the Gaza Strip has been killed, nearly four months after an Israeli strike killed seven of its employees.\n\nThe group said Nadi Sallout died on Wednesday near Deir Al Balah, central Gaza, describing him as an “integral member of our warehouse team from the early days of our response in Rafah and a humanitarian at his very core”.\n\n“Our thoughts and support are with Nadi’s family and the rest of our dedicated team around the world as we mourn this tremendous loss. We will update our website as we learn more,” WCK said on X.\n\nFor 14 years, the non-profit founded by chef Jose Andres has provided millions of meals in places ravaged by natural disasters and conflicts.\n\nThe organisation said Mr Sallout was off duty at the time of his death and it is waiting to hear more details.\n\nSince the Israel-Gaza war started in October, WCK has been providing food to needy civilians in the Gaza Strip, Israel and Lebanon.\n\nIn April, the group said it would resume its operations in Gaza only weeks after an Israeli air strike hit its aid convoy, killing seven of its employees.\n\nThe organisation demanded an independent investigation into the attack, which led to fears of a vital lifeline to thousands of civilians being cut.\n\nThe attack led to global outrage, with Mr Andres condemning the “indiscriminate killing”. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu later claimed responsibility for the strike.\n\nIn an update last week, the organisation said the situation in Gaza was getting worse and several of its kitchens had had to stop working while others have been cut off from their aid.\n\n“Areas near our kitchens have become the focal point of Israeli military operations. As a result, we can no longer get critical resupplies of ingredients and equipment to several WCK-supported community kitchens,” it said on X.\n\nThursday's death toll from Israeli strikes on Gaza rose to more than 40 people after the latest attacks targeted a school compound east of Gaza city.\n\nAt least 15 people were killed in the strikes on the Abdul Fattah Hammoud and Al Zahraa schools, which were sheltering displaced families, according to an alert from the official Wafa news agency.\n\nThe Palestinian Red Crescent transferred a number of people in critical condition to the Al Ahli Arab Baptist Hospital, Wafa added.\n\nThe strikes came shortly after at least 15 others were killed in a strike on the central Bureij refugee camp.\n\nAt least 12 people were killed in separate attacks on Gaza city, Rafah, and Khan Younis, where a woman and her four children were reported killed in an afternoon strike on their tent."
