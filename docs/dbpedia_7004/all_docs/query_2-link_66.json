        "text": "Acclaimed filmmaker Roland Joffé will be heading an international jury during the first edition of the Valletta Film Festival, taking place across various venues in Valletta between 15 and 21 June.\n\nJoffé is one of the few directors —if any— to enter the cinematic medium with Oscar nominations for each of his first two motion pictures. It marked an auspicious beginning for Roland Joffé as he was universally praised for his international style of moviemaking on ‘The Killing Fields‘ and ‘The Mission‘. Joffé also immediately endeared himself to Hollywood as a filmmaker par excellence in his choice of material.\n\nAs Head of the Jury at the Valletta Film Festival, Joffé will be joined by four other filmmakers and critics composing the international jury (final jury members will be announced on May 23).\n\nTogether they will be viewing and considering the independently produced films competing in the Official Competition for the awards of Best Feature Film, Best Director, Best Actor and Actress and Best Cinematography.\n\nThe Festival will have five different sections, including an official competitive section split into three categories for feature films, documentaries and short films. These films will compete for different awards that will be adjudicated by an international audience. Another competitive section will be called ‘Islanders’. This section is open only to films from islands or about islands and the audience will be given the chance to choose the best film.\n\nThis year's edition of the festival will also be commemorating the work of famed Italian director Giuseppe Tornatore, and a comprehensive series of screenings will be organised."
