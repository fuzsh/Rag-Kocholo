        "text": "The \"back by popular demand\" national touring gospel stage play written and directed by Rev. Joseph \"JoJo\" Williams Jr., returns for one show only.\n\n\"A Fall From Grace\" deals head on with issues from family relationships to DUI. Rev. JoJo Williams Jr. is \"Bishop Hightower\" who knows the anointing God has placed on him to counsel and minister to his congregation, but fails to realize the magnitude of problems in his very own house. Benetra Crawford- Calhoun, also the COO/Partner of the Gospel Underground Railroad Network Ministries, plays the materialist \"First Lady Grace\" who has secrets even the bottle can't handle. Other stellar cast members include Shanta Moore, Greg \"Vezz-Soul\" Aiken, Lora Ray from Asheville, N.C., and \"South Carolina's First Lady of Song,\" Loretta Holloway.\n\nRev. Joseph \"JoJo\" Williams Jr., is also the writer and creator of the new \"first of it's kind\" gospel television sitcom \"The Bishop House\" currently airing on FOX Carolina, CW Carolina, WGGS-TV Greenville, FOX 54 Augusta, WBEK-TV Augusta, and FOX WACH-TV in Columbia.\n\nTickets may be purchased at Rainbow Records, Foggie-Holloway Funeral Home, The Potter's House Resale & Consignment Shop, Sally Christian Store in Abbeville, Holloway's Funeral Home of Belton or call Beetra Calhoun at (803) 226-5163 (group rates available) and (864) 338-8172."
