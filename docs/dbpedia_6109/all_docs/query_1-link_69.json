        "text": "Joanne Thompson Tribute\n\nJoanne and Pastor Jimmy Thompson (photo probably from the late 1950s)\n\n“We’re here to celebrate a life that was well lived,” said Dr. Coy Barker, as he “preached the funeral” of Joanne Thompson on Sunday, March 6, 2011, at Faith Temple Church in Taylors, S.C.\n\nPeggy Joanne Thompson (Nov. 19, 1933 – March 3, 2011) of Taylors was a wife, a mother and vice-president and co-founder of Dove Broadcasting, WGGS-TV 16, headquartered in Greenville, S.C.\n\nBarker, founder of Metro World Outreach Center in Stone Mountain, Ga., and longtime friend of Dove Broadcasting, called Joanne “a woman of God.”\n\nGreenvilleonline.com published this statement: “Joanne and her husband, Dr. James H. Thompson, are considered visionaries and pioneers in Christian broadcasting. Since October 1972, Joanne and Jimmy have been devoted to producing high quality, family-oriented Christian programming. Together they have made outstanding contributions to not only South Carolina but to the nation and the world.\n\n“Joanne touched the lives of thousands of people in Appalachia, Romania and Moldova. She also had an ongoing prison ministry and assistance to families in need. She lived her life in service to children and families who were hurting and had no hope. She received many Angel Awards for excellence in media for documentaries featuring her mission outreach projects.”\n\nJoanne is survived by her husband, their three sons (Dante, Duane and Gene Thompson), three grandchildren and a great-granddaughter.\n\nMy Uncle Fred Crain, 85, is a charter member of Faith Temple, which was founded in the mid-1950s and first led by Dr. James Thompson. Fred remembers when “Jimmy” pastored Gum Springs P.H. Church and met Joanne Upton who then lived in Greer, S.C., and had a brother, Fred Upton. Their father had alcohol problems, and their lives had not been easy, my uncle says.\n\n“Doyle Zachery was preaching a tent revival and Joanne got saved there,” my Uncle Fred says. “Betty Atkins was playing the organ at that meeting.”\n\nBetty may have invited Joanne to hear Jimmy preach.\n\n“Joanne came up to Gum Springs one night,” Fred says. “Jimmy preached, and he told me he made sure he got to the church door after the service to meet Joanne.”\n\nAfter Joanne and Jimmy dated a while, Jimmy mentioned marriage.\n\n“They rode to Hendersonville, and he talked serious to her about marriage,” Fred says, “but she said she didn’t think she wanted to marry a preacher. Jimmy told her, ‘So, you’re asking me to choose between you and God?’ Joanne said that really ‘struck’ her.”\n\nJoanne worked at that time at an insurance company and wanted to study nursing. She broke up with Jimmy, but 11 months later, he invited her to go with him “to hear a preacher.” She went, and they resumed dating.\n\nFred and his wife, Frances, met Joanne when Jimmy brought her to their home, located then in the Mountain View community near Taylors.\n\n“Jimmy brought her to our house,” Fred says. “They were courting, and he wanted me to show her a few things about the guitar. She was a singer and had been wanting to learn to play the guitar. After a few minutes, Joanne said the strings hurt her fingers. She seemed like a real nice, intelligent young lady who was wanting to do something for the Lord.”\n\nJimmy and Joanne married on April 22, 1955, and helped found Faith Temple Church in 1956-57.\n\nMy sister, Shirley Crain Thompson (no relation to Jimmy and Joanne) of Stone Mountain, Ga., says she fondly remembers Joanne as her Sunday school teacher during her childhood and teen years.\n\n“She was always amusing and told us truths I frequently recalled all my life. We would have slumber parties on Friday nights with the girls in my Sunday school class, and Joanne would take her time to attend those functions with us. We considered her our friend as well as our teacher…I knew she would accomplish great things – and she did. I was just fortunate to have her placed in my path by God.”\n\nAt Joanne’s funeral, LaVerne Tripp commented on her determination, calling her “a bulldog for people who were hurt.”\n\nDr. Jerry Goff talked about “Jimmy’s wisdom and Joanne’s zeal.” He said about Joanne, “There was no problem she would not attack…She was on a mission every day…searching for a new way to serve Christ.”"
