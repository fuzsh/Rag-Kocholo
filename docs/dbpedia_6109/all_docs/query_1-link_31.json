        "text": "South Carolina Educational Television (branded as South Carolina ETV, SCETV or simply ETV) is a state network of non-commercial educational television stations serving the U.S. state of South Carolina. It is operated by the South Carolina Educational Television Commission, an agency of the state government which holds the licenses for all of the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) member stations licensed in the state. The broadcast signals of the eleven television stations cover almost all of the state, as well as parts of North Carolina and Georgia.\n\nThe network's primary operations are located on George Rogers Boulevard in Columbia, across from Williams-Brice Stadium; SCETV operates satellite studios in Spartanburg, Beaufort, Sumter and Rock Hill.\n\nHistory[]\n\nThe state network began in 1957, after the South Carolina General Assembly authorized a study in the use of instructional television in the state's public schools. A studio was opened in the library of Dreher High School in Columbia. The first telecourses (a French course taught by Madame Lucille Turney-High and a geometry course taught by Cornelia Turnbull) aired on September 8, 1958 via closed circuit television. By action of the South Carolina General Assembly, The South Carolina ETV Commission was created as a state agency and began operations on July 1, 1960, and by 1962 it extended closed-circuit, classroom television service to all 46 South Carolina counties.\n\nIn 1963, the Commission launched the first open-circuit (broadcast) educational station in South Carolina, WNTV in Greenville. One year later, WITV in Charleston signed on. Two years later, WRLK-TV in Columbia, made its debut. The network grew to eleven television transmitters covering all of the state. After years of receiving NET and PBS programs on tape delay, it entered PBS' satellite network in 1978. In 2000, SCETV broadcast the first digital television program in the state. Since 2003, the state network identifies on-air as simply \"ETV.\"\n\nThe Commission entered public radio in 1972, when WEPR in Clemson signed on the air (WEPR later moved its city of license to Greenville). The state radio network eventually expanded to eight stations and was called the South Carolina Educational Radio Network (SCERN) until 2003, when it was renamed ETV Radio. While \"ETV\" generally refers to television, SCETV viewed \"ETV\" as a general brand name for both its radio and television properties. In 2015, however, the radio network rebranded as South Carolina Public Radio.\n\nR. Lynn Kalmbach was selected as the network's project director in 1958 and led it until his death in 1965. Henry J. Cauthen became president and general manager of the South Carolina Educational Television Network (ETV) and served in numerous leadership roles developing American public broadcasting, including chair of The Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB). Mr. Cauthen retired in 1997. Paul Amos took the helm as ETV's third president in 1998 until his death in 2000. Maurice \"Moss\" Bresnahan joined ETV as president and CEO from 2001 to 2008. David Crouch served as interim president in 2009. Linda O'Bryon served as president from 2010 to 2017. Anthony Padgett is the current president and CEO.\n\nSCETV and SC Public Radio have posted a more detailed history.\n\nStations[]\n\nFull Power Stations[]\n\nCall signs Location CH First Air Date WNTV GSA, SC 29 September 29, 1963 WITV Charleston, SC 7 January 19, 1964 WRLK Columbia, SC 35 September 6, 1966 WJPM Florence, SC 33 September 3, 1967 WEBA Allendale, SC 14 September 5, 1967 WNEH Anderson, SC 38 January 1, 1968 WJWJ Beaufort, SC 16 September 6, 1975 WRJA Sumter, SC 27 September 7, 1975 WNSC Rock Hill, SC 30 January 3, 1978 WHMC Myrtle Beach, SC 23 September 2, 1980 WRET Spartanburg, SC 49 September 8, 1980\n\nLogo History[]\n\nComing soon\n\nGallery[]\n\nTV stations in South Carolina Columbia market: Greenville/Spartanburg/Asheville market: Charleston market: Florence/Myrtle Beach market: Charlotte, NC market: Aiken market: Savannah, GA market: WRLK, Columbia WNTV, Greenville WITV, Charleston WHMC, Conway/Myrtle Beach WNSC, Rock Hill WEBA, Allendale WJWJ, Beaufort/Hilton Head Island WRJA, Sumter WNEH, Greenwood WJPM, Florence WNTV, Spartanburg\n\nTV stations in the Midlands of South Carolina, including Columbia WIS 10 (NBC)\n\nWLTX 19 (CBS)\n\nWOLO 25 (ABC)\n\nWRJA 27 (PBS)\n\nWRLK 35 (PBS)\n\nWZRB 47 (Ion)\n\nWKDC-LD 50 (Daystar)\n\nWACH 57 (Fox)\n\nWKTC 63 (MNTV)\n\nTV stations in the Lowcountry of South Carolina, including Charleston WCBD 2 (NBC)\n\nWGWG 4 (H&I)\n\nWCSC 5 (CBS)\n\nWITV 7 (PBS)\n\nWHDC-LD 12 (Ind)\n\nWLCN-CD 18 (CTN)\n\nWTAT 24 (Fox)\n\nWAZS-LD 29 (AZA)\n\nWJNI-LD 31 (Youtoo)\n\nWCIV 36 (MNTV)\n\nTV stations in the Pee Dee region, including Myrtle Beach and Florence, South Carolina WBTW 13 (CBS)\n\nWPDE 15 (ABC)\n\nWWMB 21 (CW)\n\nWHMC 23 (PBS)\n\nWUNU 31 (PBS)\n\nWMBF 32 (NBC)\n\nWJPM 33 (PBS)\n\nWFXB 43 (Fox)\n\nTV stations in the Coastal Empire & Lowcountry, including Savannah, Hilton Head and Beaufort WSAV 3 (CBS)\n\nWVAN 9 (PBS)\n\nWTOC 11 (CBS)\n\nWJWJ 16 (PBS)\n\nWJCL 22 (ABC)\n\nWTGS 28 (Fox)\n\nW30CV-D 30 (Ind)\n\nWHDS-LD 32 (Ind)\n\nWSCG 34 (H&I)\n\nWXSX-LD 46 (SBN)\n\nTV stations in the Central Savannah River area, including Augusta, Georgia and Aiken, South Carolina WJBF 6 (ABC)\n\nWRDW 12 (CBS)\n\nWEBA 14 (PBS)\n\nWCES 20 (PBS)\n\nWAGT-CD 26 (NBC)\n\nWBPI-CD 49 (Ind)\n\nWFXG 54 (Fox)\n\nTV stations in the Charlotte, North Carolina area WBTV 3 (CBS)\n\nWSOC 9 (ABC)\n\nWHKY 14 (Ind)\n\nWCEE-LP 16 (ESTRELLA)\n\nWUNE 17 (PBS)\n\nWCCB 18 (CW)\n\nW21CK-D 21 (3ABN)\n\nWHWD-LD 21 (Daystar)\n\nWDMC-LD 25 (Daystar)\n\nWGTB-CD 28 (Ind)\n\nWNSC 30 (PBS)\n\nWCNC 36 (NBC)\n\nWVEB-LD 40 (Cozi)\n\nWHEH-LD 41 (AZA)\n\nWTVI 42 (PBS)\n\nWJZY 46 (Fox)\n\nWMYT 55 (MNTV)\n\nWUNG 58 (PBS)\n\nWAXN 64 (Ind)"
