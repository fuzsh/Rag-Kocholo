        "text": "At Southwest Spine & Sports, we take pain management seriously. That’s why we’ve found a team of some of the most talented and qualified medical professionals in all of Scottsdale, AZ. Each member of our staff is passionate, knowledgeable, and personable, ensuring the very best patient experience possible. From scheduling to recovery, a member of our team will always be there to help you with any questions or concerns you may have. Contact our practice today to schedule a consultation with any of our providers.\n\n4.9 Average Rating\n\nDr. Michael Wolff, MD, is a double-board certified interventional physical medicine doctor specializing in the non-surgical treatment of spine, sports, and joint conditions. He has devoted his career to treating many professional athletes, weekend warriors, and patients limited by painful acute or chronic injuries.\n\nDr. Wolff established Southwest Spine & Sports in 1999 to create a practice that concentrates on providing evolving and comprehensive non-surgical solutions for painful musculoskeletal conditions that limit his patients’ lives. His philosophy is to treat every patient like his own family in a safe and comfortable environment, develop a tailored plan to treat their condition without surgery, and get their quality of life back. He focuses on outpatient, minimally invasive therapies using all-natural regenerative procedures when appropriate.\n\n“My goal is to identify the source of a patient’s pain and work together so they can return to a more active, pain-free life.”\n\nState-of-the-art treatment with Regenerative Medicine:\n\nDr. Wolff has focused on the emerging field of regenerative medicine for over twelve years. Using biologic therapies such as PRP and plasma concentrate, his extensive experience has helped his patients to return to the active lifestyle they deserve. His philosophy to address pathology and restore health to damaged tissue and joints has successfully treated degenerative disc back disease, neck pain, tennis elbow, bursitis, tendinitis, and joint pain from osteoarthritis.\n\nSheila Janisch joined the practice in 2018. She has been a registered nurse since 1995 starting her career in cardiac care. She has worked in CA, NV, VA, and Arizona in post CABG/ heart transplant cardiac units. She transitioned into PACU/ pain management in 1998 and started working at both Scottsdale Healthcare Pain Center and North Scottsdale Ambulatory Surgery Center in 2002. She decided to pursue her passion for patient care and return to school obtaining her masters as a family nurse practitioner in 2009. She has been working in pain management throughout the Valley since that time.\n\nShe has a passion for hiking and traveling and enjoys spending her free time with her three children.\n\nDirector of Regenerative Medicine\n\nClinical Nurse Specialist\n\nCallie was born in Nashville, TN but considers herself a native having lived in the valley since the age of 11. She completed her undergraduate degree at BYU-Idaho in Exercise Physiology, then went on to gain her Master’s in Nursing at the University of Arizona. Once qualified as a Nurse Specialist, Callie spent her time working in emergency medicine and the OR where she was introduced to Dr. Wolff, our Interventional Physical Medicine doctor.\n\nWorking alongside Dr. Wolff, Callie’s intrigue in regenerative medicine was stimulated, prompting her to move to Southwest Spine & Sports (SWSS) to be able to assist Dr. Wolff full-time. Her passion to treat patients with all-natural non-surgical regenerative solutions for spine, sports and joint conditions increased as she gained more and more exposure to the benefits and results Dr. Wolff’s regenerative work was having.\n\nCallie loves spending time with her family including her four children and two dogs. Running, cycling, playing tennis, pickleball and hiking are a few of the hobbies that also keep her busy, so she can relate when patients are frustrated that an injury is slowing them down or preventing them from a lifestyle they enjoy. Seeing injured athletes (professional or weekend warriors) recover after regenerative treatment (such as PRP and biologics) and be able to return to a pain-free, active life is a journey she is now dedicated to.\n\nCallie strives to treat each patient with a high level of individualized attention and personal care. She now leads our regenerative team of staff to provide the care, communication and patient experience that we believe all patients at SWSS deserve."
