The annual Hanging Nasturtiums display continues as an annual tradition started by Isabella Stewart Gardner during the week before Easter, marking the valiant return of color to the Fenway.\n\nNasturtium vines (Tropaeolum majus) are planted in late summer and cultivated in the Gardner Museum's greenhouses throughout the winter to prepare them for their spectacular spring debut. The vines require continuous care in the greenhouse to ensure dramatic length - up to twenty feet - and require up to ten workers to install in the museum.

On his return to Paris he set to work on a wide horizontal picture whose proportions simulated the shallow stage space of popular musical establishments. He named the painting El Jaleo to suggest the name of a dance, the jaleo de jerez, while counting on the broader meaning jaleo, which means ruckus or hubbub.\n\nThe painting was exhibited at the Paris Salon of 1882 with the more explicit title El Jaleo: Danse des gitanes (Dance of the Gypsies). The painting was purchased by American businessman and diplomat T. Jefferson Coolidge in 1882, and was given to Mrs. Gardner as a gift in 1914. Then, as now, El Jaleo resides in the Spanish Cloister of the Gardner Museum, just off the famous Courtyard.\n\nThis enamel pin captures the central figure of Sargent's work, the semi-veiled flamenco dancer, in fluid motion with her skirt in one hand while the other flourishes with the music.

This panel is the third in a set of four reliquaries, or containers for holy relics, depicting episodes from the Virgin’s life.\n\nNineteenth-century enthusiasts celebrated this Dominican painter “Fra Angelico” (the angelic friar) for the spiritual content and lyrical quality of his work. Most of his paintings in the United States are the surviving fragments of larger works, but this one is nearly intact and was greatly admired in Boston. Gardner’s friend the American painter John La Farge, whose works can be found in the Blue Room, once reminded her that even Robert Langton Douglas, a British art critic and director of the National Gallery of Ireland, praised Gardner’s Fra Angelico in his writings.\n\n100% Silk\n\n33.5\" x 45\"\n\nView full product details\n\nQty\n\nEl Jaleo Scarf\n\n$47.00\n\nEl Jaleo\n\n1882\n\nJohn Singer Sargent, American, 1856-1925\n\nImages like El Jaleo lean toward the daring, risky, unconventional, dramatic, erotically off-center, and odd. Because nomadic groups were believed to ignore ethical principles and exalted superstition over orthodox religion, they endured oppression in numerous countries during the nineteenth century, but artists and bohemians idealized them as free spirits. Bizet's opera Carmen, first performed in Paris in 1875, scandalized the public with its tale of a proud, lusty Andalusian protagonist torn between an army officer and a toreador.\n\nDuring his travels in Spain in 1879, Sargent was mulling over a major work of art in which he could express his love of Romani music, dance, and picturesque costumes. On his return to Paris, he set to work on a wide horizontal picture whose proportions simulated the shallow stage space of popular musical establishments. He named the painting El Jaleo to suggest the name of a dance, the jaleo de jerez, while counting on the broader definition of jaleo,which includes ruckus or hubbub. The painting was exhibited at the Paris Salon of 1882 with the more explicit title El Jaleo: Danse des gitanes (Dance of the Gypsies).\n\n33 x 51 inches\n\n100% Polyester\n\nMachine Washable\n\nView full product details\n\nQty\n\nGirl with a Lute Scarf\n\n$47.00\n\nA Girl with a Lute\n\n1520\n\nBartolomeo Vento, Italian, active 1502-1513\n\nThe lute and the song for tenor and bass lying open on the sill signify the artist's ambition to transcend the conventions of painting and produce a song-haunted mood. This lyrical idea overran Lombardy and Venice in the early sixteenth century and had been quickly brought to its most moving pitch at Venice in the light and color of Giorgione. Here somber shadow prevails, under the influence of the more mystic Leonardo. The picture was painted presumably in Milan, where there are still three versions, two of them by Bartolommeo himself, one of these bearing the same date.\n\n33 x 42 inches\n\n100% Polyester\n\nMachine Washable\n\nView full product details\n\nQty\n\nIsabella Scarf\n\n$47.00\n\nIsabella Stewart Gardner\n\n1888\n\nJohn Singer Sargent, American, 1856-1925\n\nMrs. Gardner sat for Sargent during his visit to Boston in January 1888. He was paid $3000 for the portrait, which was exhibited to great acclaim at Boston’s St. Botolph Club. The work also inspired gossip and legend: someone jokingly titled it “Woman: An Enigma,” while others believed that the sensuous display of flesh deliberately echoed the scandal recently created by Sargent’s Madame X. Mrs. Gardner herself said that she rejected eight renderings of the face until she was satisfied.\n\nIn its gallery, surrounded by altarpieces, stained glass, and religious statuary, the sacramental quality noted by nineteenth-century reviewers is even more pronounced.\n\n33 x 73 inches\n\n100% Polyester\n\nMachine Washable\n\nView full product details\n\nQty\n\nYoung Lady of Fashion Scarf\n\n$47.00\n\nA Young Lady of Fashion\n\nearly 1460's\n\nattributed to Paolo Uccello, Italian, 1397-1475\n\nThe portrait has a highly decorative quality in which costume and ornament play a major role. The rather flatly modeled face is placed on an insubstantial bust set against a uniform blue background. The woman is portrayed both according to literary notions of female pulchritude, which called for fair skin and blonde hair, and the dictates of contemporary fashion. Costly brocaded fabrics, pearls, and precious stones serve not only to display the sitter’s familial wealth and status but also to enhance her physical appearance – in art, as in life. In addition to a red and gold brocade sleeve and a sleeveless overdress, the woman wears a head brooch, a pearl choker with jeweled pendant, and a white cap ornamented with pearls.\n\nThis fashionable beauty looks impassive, immobile, and immutable, as if she were outside space and time. Her portrait image has a static, stereotyped character, in which the sitter’s individuality is almost entirely suppressed in favor of the social ideals for which she stands.\n\nIn August 2018, choreographer, painter, dancer, and director Shen Wei transformed the Artist-in-Residence apartment at the Museum into a working studio. Wei was introduced as a young child to a variety of traditional Chinese art forms including opera, watercolor, and ink drawing. Today he is an artist who moves freely across mediums to find spiritual meaning in an increasingly material world. One of the works he was drawn to during his residency is the A Young Lady of Fashion, located in the Long Gallery. This Renaissance portrait, painted in profile, has a striking resemblance to a member of the Shen Wei Dance Arts. The encounter with this artwork inspired Shen Wei and ultimately led to the creation of Passion Spirit, a film shot at the Museum and at the Arnold Arboretum the following Summer.\n\n33 x 51 inches\n\n100% Polyester\n\nMachine Washable\n\nView full product details\n\nQty"
