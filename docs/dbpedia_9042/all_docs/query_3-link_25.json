This project will investigate the effects of tDCS on the strength of connections between neurons, which may inform the treatment of neurological or psychiatric decease.\n\nNovember 16, 2016\n\nDear colleagues,\n\nAfter learning that Steve Cowin passed away few weeks ago, the International Society for Porous Media (Interpore) is organizing a minisymposium in honor of Steve Cowin within the 9th International Conference on Porous Media in Rotherdam, Netherlands from May 8-11th, 2017.\n\n‘’Mechanisms of mechanotransduction: how biology builds smart porous media. A tribute to Prof. Stephen Cowin’’\n\nThe human body renews itself continually. Every 5 years most of the molecules of the physiology are replaced by new ones. One of the key triggers of the renewal is mechanical stress. Mechanotransduction is the sensing of stress by biological tissues. There is ample evidence that living cells sense stress including its orientation, as a full tensor, resulting in anisotropic structuring of constituents such as mineral bone, collagen fibers, cytoskeleton. Understanding of mechanisms of mechanotransduction require a multiscale, multiphysics analysis of the response of a tissue to external stress.\n\nThe deadline to submit an abstract has been extended to Monday November 21th.\n\nFor the submission of the abstract, the following information is needed as unformatted text:\n\nAbstract title\n\nNames and affiliations of authors\n\nPresenting author\n\nThree to six keywords\n\nAbstract body, up to a maximum of 500 words\n\nReference list, up to 6 lines\n\nUp to 3 graphics (accepted formats: GIF, JPEG, PNG).\n\nMinisymposium or general session to which the abstract is submitted.\n\nhttps://www.interpore.org/116-event-booking/9th-international-conference-on-porous-media-annual-meeting/318-abstract-uploading-16\n\nPlease contact Dr. Jacques Huyghe ( jacques.huyghe@ul.ie \" rel=\"nofollow\"> jacques.huyghe@ul.ie ) or Professor Luis Cardoso( cardoso@ccny.cuny.edu ) if you have any questions.\n\nNovember 15, 2016\n\nResearchers under the direction of Professor John Tarbell in the Biomedical Engineering Department’s Wallace H. Coulter Laboratory have just published a study on the role of the cancer cell surface glycocalyx layer in cancer metastasis.\n\nWorking in collaboration with Dr. Lance Munn and his associates at the Edwin L. Steele Laboratories at Harvard/MGH, the groups showed that the surface proteoglycan/glycoprotein layer (glycocalyx) on tumor cells controls spreading of highly metastatic renal carcinoma cells in a mouse model. Using genetically modified cells that did not express a major glycocalyx glycosaminoglycan – heparan sulfate (HS), they demonstrated by histological analysis that there was a large reduction (95%) in metastasis to distant organs by tumors with HS deficient cells compared to control cells with intact glycocalyx. These findings suggest novel approaches for controlling cancer metastasis. The findings are reported in the December 2016 issue of the International Journal of Cancer. (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27543953)\n\nNovember 11, 2016\n\nObituary for Stephen C. Cowin\n\nIt is with great sadness that the Department of Biomedical Engineering mourns the death of one of its co-founders, Stephen C. Cowin, on October 19, 2016, one week shy of his 82nd birthday. Professor Cowin, an internationally recognized scholar in the field of biomechanics and solid mechanics more generally, first came to The City College in the fall of 1988 as a CUNY Distinguished Professor of Mechanical Engineering. He was a senior member of the Department of Mechanical Engineering from 1988 to 2002 when he transferred to the newly created Department of Biomedical Engineering (BME) in 2002, where he served for one year as its first department chair. He remained in the BME Department until his retirement in 2015. Before the creation of the BME Department and undergraduate degree program, Professor Cowin helped create a new CUNY PhD Program in Biomedical Engineering in 1999. Prior to coming to The City College in 1988 Professor Cowin had taught at Tulane University for 25 years, where he co-founded their Biomedical Engineering Department with William Van Buskirk in 1977 and was the Alden J. Laborde Professor of Engineering. Professor Cowin received his BS and MS degrees in Civil Engineering from Johns Hopkins in 1956 and 1958, respectively, and his PhD in Engineering Mechanics from Penn State in 1962.\n\nProfessor Cowin is widely recognized for his pioneering research in the mechanics of materials, in particular the influence of microstructure on the gross mechanical behavior of granular, composite, and biological materials. In the early part of his career he wrote classic papers on continuum theory for granular materials (with MA Goodman), a non-linear theory for elastic materials with voids (with JW Nunziato), and developed basic theorems in anisotropic elasticity (with MM Mehrabadi). While at Tulane he started his research on bone remodeling in response to mechanical forces and introduced the concept of the fabric tensor for cancellous bone in which he tried to explain Wolff’s law for trabecular architecture, which dated back to the last part of the 19th century. Shortly after his arrival at City College he started to work with CUNY Distinguished Professor Sheldon Weinbaum on a cellular level hypothesis to explain how bone cells (osteocytes) sense mechanical forces due to human locomotion. Their inaugural paper in 1994 on the effect of fluid forces on the dendritic processes of osteocytes helped expand research on mechanotransduction in living bone. Until recently, this paper (> 1000 Google citations) was the most cited paper in the J. Biomechanics since its founding and was the catalyst for the International Bone Fluid Flow Workshop, which Professor Cowin inaugurated in 1997. In 1995 the authors received the Research Award of the European Society of Biomechanics. Professor Cowin has worked extensively with Professor Weinbaum since then and has also collaborated closely with CCNY Professors SP Fritton and L Cardoso on bone poroelasticity.\n\nProfessor Cowin is one of the most highly cited investigators in the field of biomechanics. He has published more than 250 research papers, edited five books on bone and tissue mechanics, including the Bone Mechanics Handbook in 1989 and 2001. His book on Tissue Mechanics with S Doty is also in its 2nd edition. His research papers and books have been cited over 10,000 times on the Web of Science and he has received numerous awards. Foremost among these are his election to the National Academy of Engineering in 2004, the Melville Medal of the ASME 1993, the HR Lissner Award of the ASME in 1999, and the MA Biot Medal of the ASCE in 2004, and the Honorary Lifetime Award by the International Society for Porous Media in 2016, in addition to the Research Award of the European Society of Biomechanics in 1995.\n\nProfessor Cowin was also an engaged, dedicated, and effective teacher. He is survived by his wife of many years, Martha, their two children Thomas and Jennifer and eight grandchildren.\n\nMay 19, 2016\n\nCCNY names BME as Class of ’16 Valedictorian\n\nBME Senior, Antonios “Andoni” Mourdoukoutas, a recent NSF Graduate Research Fellowship recipient from the Macaulay Honors College, is The City College of New York’s Class of 2016 Valedictorian at CCNY’s 170th Commencement Exercises on June 3.\n\nThe NSF Fellowshiptops is among a long list of top honors that he’s earned at CCNY. It is considered the nation’s most prestigious federal grant for graduate research in the sciences. His other awards include a 2015 Goldwater Scholarship. Andoni worked in the lab of Prof. Marom Bikson.\n\nAndoni has been accepted to doctoral programs in bioengineering at MIT-Harvard and UC Berkeley-UC San Francisco. His interest is neural stimulation to treat illness.\n\nMay 18, 2016\n\nOngoing entrepreneurship success by BME\n\nBME student and faculty continue to succeed in entrepreneurship.\n\nStreetLabs – A startup providing technology for monitoring NYC’s roads, allowing the Department of Transportation to make faster repairs.
