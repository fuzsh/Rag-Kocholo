        "text": "Michael Wolff blew the lid off the Trump White House with his 2018 book Fire and Fury — written after being granted unprecedented access as a “fly on the wall” observer inside the West Wing throughout most of the first year of Trump’s presidency.\n\n​\n\nThe book debuted at number one on the New York Times bestseller list in January 2018, and within a week had become the fastest selling book in the history of Henry Holt and Company, with over 700,000 orders shipped and 1.4 million orders placed.\n\nWolff’s new book is The Fall: The End of Fox News and the Murdoch Dynasty (2023). Michelle Goldberg of the New York Times called it, \"Amusingly vicious and very well-timed.”\n\n​\n\nHis other books include the seminal biography of Rupert Murdoch, The Man Who Owns the News. A two-time winner of the National Magazine Awards, he has been a columnist for New York magazine, Vanity Fair, British GQ, the Hollywood Reporter, and the Guardian.\n\nPraise for The Fall:\n\n\"Riveting. . . . A dishy look at the decline of Fox News. Wolff offers his typically no-holds-barred look at the powerful personalities at the top of the network. . . . He harbors no qualms about consorting with some of America’s worst people — nor about burning them blithely in service of his narrative. . . . Fox’s marquee talents are not spared Wolff’s gimlet eye. . . . He offers countless lacerating portraits.\" — The Washington Post\n\n\"Amusingly vicious and very well-timed. . . . In Wolff’s telling, Murdoch is a sort of hapless Frankenstein, abominating the monster he set loose on the world but unsure how to fight him.\"\n\n—Michelle Goldberg, The New York Times\n\n\"Wolff, author of a spate of books skewering the dysfunctional Trump presidency, returns to his investigation of the Murdochs with a fast-paced, gossip-filled recounting of family drama—rivaling Succession in intrigue and bitter strife—and the travails and scandals that have roiled Fox News. . . . Wolff is merciless.\"\n\n—Kirkus Reviews"
