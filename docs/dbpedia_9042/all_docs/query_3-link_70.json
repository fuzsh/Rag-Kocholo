        "text": "I’m delighted to announce that the 20th Anniversary Edition of The Living Great Lakes will be in bookstores everywhere on May 14, 2024. I’ve updated it and written a new introduction that discusses what has changed in twenty years, including where the Malabar is now and what Hajo and a few other crew members are doing. And I’d like to add, in case it isn’t obvious, I can hardly believe it’s been 20 years. Quite a ride this book and its author have been on since 2004.\n\nA NEW BOOK (FINALLY!)\n\nI’m pleased to announce the publication of my new book Up North in Michigan: A Portrait of Place in Four Seasons (University of Michigan Press, hardcover, 186 pages, $24.95). This one’s been in progress for a number of years and finally came together during the pandemic. I’ll always remember it as my Covid book—the one […]Read More »\n\nIT'S A NEW, NEW YEAR\n\n“Doing okay,” is what most of my family and friends say whenever I ask. And none of us forgets that if you’re okay you’re one of the fortunate ones.But even those of us who have stayed healthy and not lost our jobs, homes, or loved ones have faced extraordinary challenges. If there’s been a time […]Read More »\n\nTime Marches on, a Sad Loss, I'm Wearing My Editor Hat Again, and Reader's Block Ends.\n\nIT’S BEEN A MILD WINTER so far here in northern Michigan. We’re in “deep winter,” about midway between the fall and spring equinoxes, when we usually have temperatures in the teens and lower 20s and there should be a couple feet of snow on the ground. In fits of whimsy I’ve sometimes imagined (in The […]Read More »\n\nLake Michigan in Winter\n\n(January, Cathead Point, near the tip of Michigan’s Leelanau Peninsula) IT CHANGES EVERY MOMENT. It’s a thousand lakes, changing faces with every shift in wind and light – flurried by offshore wind, white-capped in squalls, colored flannel gray or pearl white or stormy black beneath the winter clouds, a dozen blues when the sky is […]Read More »\n\nLOON SONG\n\nTHEY SAY SPRING ADVANCES fifteen miles a day, about the pace of a steady walk, which explains why I could experience three springs that year. The first was in March, in Ohio, on the shore of Lake Erie’s Maumee Bay, where I stayed in a small cabin near the bay to watch new grass sprouting […]Read More »\n\nTHE RESTLESS SEASON\n\nWHAT IS THIS ENERGY that floods our veins in autumn? When the nights start turning cold and the trees are showing their first reds and yellows, I find myself rising at dawn and hurrying outside to cut firewood and install storm windows, then rushing off to spend the rest of the day fishing on rivers […]Read More »\n\nSANDBLASTED\n\nWE SPENT THE NIGHT with our friends Betsy and Eric in a cottage they had rented on the shore of Lake Michigan near Point Betsie. The cottage was a 1950’s-era Cape Cod perched on a dune a pebble toss from the waves breaking on the beach. The lap siding was old enough to have been […]Read More »\n\nLIQUID RUNS OF MELODY\n\nIf you’re like me, not even the recent spell of cold and snow can push away the stirrings of spring fever. My symptoms always include greater than usual obsessions with birds and fish and morel mushrooms. Today it’s mostly birds. With that in mind, maybe it’s a good time to revisit a couple of my […]Read More »\n\nSPRING ARRIVES!\n\nAh, the season of promise. Is it any wonder we grow impatient for it in March, when the last winter storms close roads and snap trees beneath their weight? We step outside hoping to hear the bassoon rumble of frogs mating in the neighbor’s pond—and instead are struck by a cold wind from the north […]Read More »\n\nTHE HOURS IN WINTER\n\nIT’S AN ILLUSION, of course, but winter hours seem longer. In summer, when daylight lasts from five in the morning until ten at night, there’s not enough time in the day for everything you want to do. But in winter, time languishes. You can work eight hours, plow the driveway, prepare dinner, eat, clean the […]Read More »\n\nLAKE SQUALL, 1967: WHEN SALMON ANGLERS ENCOUNTERED THE POWER OF LAKE MICHIGAN\n\nWHEN I WAS TWELVE YEARS OLD I was eager for adventure. My family lived on Long Lake, where any ordinary day offered opportunities for exploration and discovery. But ordinary days bored me. I longed for uncommon experience. When storms chased the summer people inside their cottages, I wanted to be on the shore of Lake […]Read More »\n\nFISHING THE JAM: A DESCENT INTO THE DARK SIDE OF SALMON FISHING\n\nWhen the urge to spawn came over them, salmon ran up the rivers by the hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands. They also ran up any creek, slough, channel, and ditch they could squeeze into. My friends and I used to stalk them in rivulets so shallow the fish were virtually stranded, and still they shimmied […]Read More »\n\nA SPORT OF KINGS: THE SALMON OF ICELAND\n\nWhen you mention salmon in many parts of the world, from the northeastern U.S. and Canada across northern Europe and the remote nether reaches of Russia, everyone assumes you mean Atlantic salmon. Although they are a close relative of coho, Chinook, pink and other Pacific salmons, there are differences. The most significant of them biologically […]Read More »\n\nLITTLE GIANTS: THE UNLIKELY JOURNEY OF PINK SALMON IN THE GREAT LAKES\n\nBiologists and anglers had attempted to plant salmon in the Great Lakes for more than a century before the spectacular success of the coho and Chinook programs of the late 1960s. Those earlier attempts had always failed, with one notable exception: the accidental release of a species that established itself in all five Great Lakes […]Read More »\n\nA BOLT OF BLUE: Coming Down with a Case of Coho Fever\n\nFifty years ago the biggest story in the history of freshwater fisheries was unfolding in northern Michigan. Vast numbers of coho salmon had returned, were feeding rapaciously, and anyone who cast a lure into the water could catch them. “Coho fever” went rampant. Anglers from across the country hurried to Frankfort and Platte Bay, launched […]Read More »\n\n\"That Wild Flash...That Lightning Crack\": Writers on Writing.1\n\nIT’S A LONELY BUSINESS, being a writer. Little wonder we’re hungry for words of advice and encouragement. I’ve collected those words for more than thirty years, writing many of them in longhand on the inside covers of my journals and adding others to digital files. I go to them sometimes when I need a chuckle […]Read More »\n\nMy Bay Life\n\nSO I’VE BECOME a homebody. Nobody is more surprised than I. But if you saw my home, you’d understand. You’d understand especially in summer, for everyone wants to be in Traverse City in the sweet season. Can you blame them? Days on the bay and the inland lakes, evenings downtown at theaters, breweries, bookstores, and […]Read More »\n\nSANDBLASTED\n\nWE SPENT THE NIGHT with our friends Betsy and Eric in a cottage they had rented on the shore of Lake Michigan near Point Betsie. The cottage was a 1950’s-era Cape Cod perched on a dune a pebble toss from the waves breaking on the beach. The lap siding was sandblasted smooth and worn to […]Read More »\n\nYELLOWTHROATS AND AGATES\n\nIN MAY Gail and I like to go to the eastern Upper Peninsula to watch birds. We do a sort of Grand Tour, from Mackinac State Park to the Seney Wildlife Refuge to Whitefish Point. Whitefish Point is a funnel for migrants, and on some days you can see hundreds of raptors soaring in “kettles” […]Read More »\n\nQuiet Hours\n\nYEARS AGO, when my wife and young sons and I lived in the Old Town neighborhood of Traverse City, we often walked to the Carnegie Library on Sixth Street. On winter evenings we would bundle up in coats, boots, hats, and mittens and set out through the snow. If it was very cold and much […]Read More »\n\nDECEMBER NOTES, ON THE EVE OF CHRISTMAS\n\nHere are some notes from my journals, Decembers 1990-2016. Some of them appeared in the “Field Notes” section of The Windward Shore: FIRST SNOW, barely an inch deep, and suddenly the world is pristine again. Climbed the hill out back and looked down on the land rolling beneath its new white coat and could see […]Read More »\n\nCAN WE INSPIRE A NEW GENERATION OF STEWARDS?\n\nOF ALL THE CONTRADICTIONS IN HUMAN BEHAVIOR, our relationship with nature is surely the most contradictory. We can’t decide if we’re part of it or apart from it. We love it and hate it to death. We abuse it heartlessly and defend it ferociously. We annihilate species, tear down mountains, poison oceans and rivers, and […]Read More »\n\nNOVEMBER NOTES, WITH THANKS\n\nON THE EVE OF THANKSGIVING, in this year of complexity and setbacks, when I have more to be thankful for than ever, I’ve found myself going through my notebooks looking for observations from previous Novembers. Here are a few of them: The trees as bare as bones, standing shocked, and the hills are blank and […]Read More »\n\nMAKING A LETTERPRESS BROADSIDE\n\nGLENN WOLFF AND I have been making limited-edition broadsides for awhile now. First with Chad Pastotnik over at Deep Wood Press (“The Trout in Winter”), and now at our own Big Maple Press. What’s a broadside? We get asked that a lot. In short: a one-page work of art and text suitable for framing. But […]Read More »\n\nLITERARY FEASTS (REVISITED)\n\nLiterature and music come closest of all the arts to matching the creative opulence and diversity of nature. Just as the 117 elements in the Periodic Table are the raw material for all physical matter, the 26 letters in our alphabet create a spoken/written universe of virtually endless variety. Putting letters and words into new […]Read More »\n\nTHE FRINGE OF AUTUMN\n\nEVERY YEAR THERE’S A DAY when summer gives way suddenly to autumn. Last year it began before dawn on September 30, when the temperature fell from the fifties into the forties and a powerful wind funneled down the Great Lakes. By midmorning, waves had reached twelve feet. NOAA measured one rogue near the center of […]Read More »\n\nTHE COLOR OF WATER\n\nLAKE MICHIGAN IS BLUE TODAY, the color of robins’ eggs and summer sky. Other days it shows blues as varied as a painter’s palette. I have never seen it match the electric indigo of the Gulf Stream or the surreal carnival blues of Caribbean flats, but I’ve seen it as powder blue, baby blue, and […]Read More »\n\n\"POSTSCRIPT\" BY SEAMUS HEANEY (THE BEST THING I READ TODAY)\n\nPostscript by Seamus Heaney And some time make the time to drive out west Into County Clare, along the Flaggy Shore, In September or October, when the wind And the light are working off each other So that the ocean on one side is wild With foam and glitter, and inland among stones The surface […]Read More »\n\nMURMURATIONS (AND SHOUTS) IN THE VIRTUAL SKY\n\nA few weeks ago I got “schooled” in social media. The occasion was my first blog post for Mother Earth News, “A Murmuration of Starlings”, about the swirling, shifting, switching formations of starlings in large flocks. My point was about looking at the glass half-full: That starlings are invasive species and a scourge, yet in […]Read More »\n\nHILLTOPS AND RIVERS\n\nIN THE JACKPINE AND ASPEN COUNTRY OF CRAWFORD COUNTY a hill rises between cedar swamps. I was poking around there in early May not long ago, searching the woods for morels, and decided to climb the hill to get some perspective. At the top I discovered the place I’d been looking for. You can […]Read More »\n\nSPRING: LOON CALL\n\nThey say spring advances fifteen miles a day, the pace of a leisurely walk, which is why I could experience three springs last year. The first was in March, in Ohio, on the shore of Lake Erie’s Maumee Bay, where new grass was sprouting in farmers’ fields and clusters of broad-winged hawks circled overhead in […]Read More »\n\nWINTER AND WHITE SPACE\n\nWINTER IS A GREAT TIME FOR NOTICING the little things. Maybe a clump of snow dropping silently from a bough. Maybe a red fox trotting up the driveway. Maybe the shimmering snow crystals called “diamond dust” that sometimes, on very cold days, drift down from a blue sky. For years I’ve been trying to simplify […]Read More »\n\nWHAT'S LIGHTING US UP: ANNE-MARIE OOMEN'S LUMINOUS CONTRADICTIONS\n\nWith “What’s Lighting Us Up” I’ve been inviting some of my writer friends to report on any books, music, movies, moments in nature, or life events that have been making them come more alive than usual. Here poet, essayist, and playwright Anne-Marie reflects on a difficult challenge in her life and discovers that there can […]Read More »\n\nTHE BEST DAMNED THING I READ TODAY\n\nMany thanks to Grove Atlantic for putting me on their review list (because of my interview with Jim Harrison here). They just sent an advance uncorrected proof of Harrison’s new collection of novellas, The Ancient Mistral, which will be released in March, 2016. The title novella, which poses as memoir, contains this, the best damned […]Read More »\n\nfrom WINTER COMES TO THE KEWEENAW\n\n…In the morning the cabins were new to us. It was as if we had awakened in a different place altogether. Rain streamed down the windows, and the waters of Agate Harbor were gray and wind-streaked and bordered by rock formations capped with golden tamarack and black spruce. Beyond the mouth of the bay, in […]Read More »\n\nWHAT'S LIGHTING US UP: SYDNEY LEA’S ESSAYS AND THE MAGIC OF BIRD POEMS\n\nI’ve known Sydney Lea for many years, from time spent together at the Bear River Writers Conference and through intermittent correspondence about our shared passions for fishing, birds, bird hunting, and books. Syd’s a wonderful poet and essayist, a Pulitzer finalist and a contributor to The New Yorker, The Atlantic, and many other publications, and […]Read More »\n\nON THE GREAT LAKES: THE STORMS OF NOVEMBER\n\nEvery year on November 10 countless people remember the Edmund Fitzgerald, which sank in Lake Superior with 29 crewmen on 11/10/75. I remember also November 10, 1998, when I drove to Whitefish Point during one of the worst storms since 1975, saw Lake Superior in turmoil, and met a man who was caught in the […]Read More »\n\nOCTOBER FIELD NOTES\n\nUp before dawn this morning full of plans, oh I am industrious, I am such a hard worker, I will never die. Stepped outside to see what kind of day it would be and across the darkness heard a barred owl call from the spruce trees beyond the old barn.

It was a bright October afternoon and the woods were in full display. To say they were “ablaze” with a “riot” of colors would be inadequate. Pathetic, really.

Then as now it can seem timeless, lazy, as far removed from the productive seasons as the apple tree […]Read More »\n\nNight Watch on the Malabar\n\nWHEN I WAS A KID I wanted a life of adventure. What kid doesn’t? But I had the wrong idea about it. I thought you had to risk your life. I thought you had to travel to distant places and throw yourself into difficult situations. I didn’t know that ordinary moments can be adventures, too.

It was my first experience with the […]Read More »\n\nMAY I LIVE IN YOUR BOOKSTORE, PLEASE?\n\nIf you own a bookstore you’d be very smart to hire me.

She placed the receiver […]Read More »\n\nGETTING LOST\n\nHere’s what turns my crank: Free-flowing rivers in wild country, ponds hidden in tamarack swamps, campsites under white pines swaying in a breeze, trout gulping mayflies.
