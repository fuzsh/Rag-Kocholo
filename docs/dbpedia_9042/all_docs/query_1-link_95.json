        "text": "A memorial service for Michael Wolff, 66 of Giddings, Texas, was held on Monday, January 16, 2023 at Phillips and Luckey Funeral Home in Giddings with Pastor Donna Kruger officiating.\n\nMichael Joseph Wolff was born on March 9, 1956 in Austin, Texas to Wayne Carlton Wolff and Ann Marie (Dunk) Wolff. He was baptized at Good Shepherd Lutheran Church in Bastrop.\n\nThe short story of how Michael got into writing goes like this “Back in 4th Grade I wrote a two-page story in longhand about a comet striking Antarctica, causing it to melt. Had a lot of fun doing it, and the teacher liked the story, so I decided to become a writer.” Michael met Denise in a college creative writing class, and the two were married on April 16, 1977 at House of Prayer Lutheran Church in Clear Lake City, Texas. Through the years he authored and co-wrote many books and comics including the Supercar Comic, UFO, the Sandra Swift series, and Funny Animals. He enjoyed attending Sci-Fi and comic book conventions and was honored to be an exhibitor at several of them. Michael had an extensive library and collected models, geishas, and light houses. He enjoyed watching movies from the 40’s and 50’s and was a huge Marvel fan. Michael will be remembered as being a good man and father.\n\nMichael passed away on Tuesday, January 3, 2023 in Austin, Texas.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his parents, Wayne & Marie Wolff; parents-in-law, Carroll & Ruth Cox, and two brothers-in-law, Jerry Scoggins and Russ Cox.\n\nHe is survived by his wife, Denise Wolff of Giddings; son, Jeremiah & Christina Wolff of California; special daughter, Allenna & Jeremy Dumas of Houston; three siblings, Charles “Shorty” & Sandy Wolff of Buda, Bettie Scoggins of Mt. Pleasant, and Patricia & Corby Weiss of Bastrop; sister-in-law, Mary Jo Davis-Cox of La Marque, and several nieces, nephews, and extended family.\n\nMemorials may be made to Grace Lutheran Church in Giddings or to the charity of one’s choice."
