        "text": "Article content\n\nLast February, as the Trump presidency was just lifting off the ground, CNN’s Brian Stelter invited media critic Michael Wolff onto his show “Reliable Sources” for some awkward on-air chit-chat.\n\nWolff had taken shots in a recent Newsweek column at the media’s “apoplexy ” over the 45th president, specifically calling out Stelter for delivering on his show each week, in the writer’s words, a “pious sermon about Trump’s perfidiousness.”\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\nWho is Michael Wolff?

The media should not be the story.”\n\nThe television moment – landing an acerbic jab on a media heavyweight on his own show – was classic Wolff. But it was also a bit of foreshadowing. Nearly a year later, Michael Wolff himself is very much the story this week.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Guardian leaked portions of Wolff’s new book, “Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House,” which is set to arrive in bookstores on Jan. 9. New York Magazine followed suit, publishing a lengthy except. Based on interviews and inside access, the book presents a portrait of the messy innards of the Trump administration. The excepts hit the news cycle like a thunderbolt, dominating television and internet chatter with Wolff’s revelations of life inside Trump’s erratic inner circle – a group of people who never expected to win the presidency in the first place, according to Wolff’s telling.\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nBut the buzz has also swung back around on the author. Wolff has made his career lobbing critical bombs from the pages of prestigious magazines like New York and Vanity Fair. He has also, as The Washington Post’s Paul Farhi wrote on Wednesday, been accused by critics of “pushing the facts as far as they’ll go, and sometimes further than they can tolerate.” Attacks have already started on the book’s credibility, coming from both beat reporters dialed into the administration, and far right Trump backers like Alex Jones.\n\nThe continued question about book’s revelations is sure to heap more attention – and lead to more book sales – for Wolff, who in the space of a day not only ignited the news cycle but may have set the stage for a civil war between Trump and former adviser Steve Bannon, though Bannon himself declared Wednesday night that he still supports Trump and considers him a “great man.”\n\nRecommended from Editorial\n\nIvanka has presidential ambitions of her own: Ten big claims from Michael Wolff’s book\n\nTrump blasts Bannon after new book leak: 'When he was fired, he not only lost his job, he lost his mind'\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nWolff is a mash-up of old-school New York media and the Dot Com world. His main subject over the years has been big money power players and their endless attempts to reinvent the news and entertainment businesses.\n\n“Wolff is the quintessential New York creation, fixated on culture, style, buzz, and money, money, money,” Michelle Cottle wrote in a 2004 New Republic profile. “Part gossip columnist, part psychotherapist, part social anthropologist, Wolff invites readers to be a fly on the wall of the moguls’ inner sanctum.”\n\nWriting in the Atlantic Monthly, Eric Alterman had a less charitable take, dubbing Wolff “a portraitist who has mastered the art of the suck-up putdown.”\n\nHis gossipy media world columns earned industry kudos. Wolff twice won the National Magazine Award for commentary, in 2002 and 2004. Yet his reputation in journalism circles is not bulletproof. Critics have blasted the writer in the past for filling his column inches with insight and imaginative recreation rather than actual reporting. “Historically, one of the problems with Wolff’s omniscience is that while he may know all, he gets some of it wrong,” David Carr wrote in a 2008 New York Times review of Wolff’s 2008 book on Rupert Murdoch.\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n“His great gift is the appearance of intimate access,” an editor told Cottle in 2004. “He is adroit at making the reader think that he has spent hours and days with his subject, when in fact he may have spent no time at all.” Another former colleague said: “He did get a lot of things majorly wrong, but he never was just pedestrian . . . You have to admire his balls.”\n\nBut Wolff has also been taken to task for blurring the lines between hot take and hatchet job. “Wolff exploits the human tendency to confuse frankness and cruelty with truth-telling,” media critic Jack Shafer wrote in Slate in 1998. “And by repeatedly reminding the reader of what a dishonest, scheming little s- he is, he seeks to inflate his credibility.”\n\nHe did get a lot of things majorly wrong, but he never was just pedestrian . . . You have to admire his balls\n\nAs The Post’s Paul Farhi wrote this week, credibility has been a repeated issue. Wolff’s first best-seller, “Burn Rate: How I Survived the Gold Rush Years on the Internet,” came under fire after Brill’s Content found a dozen individuals who disputed their quotes in the book. While later penning a regular column for New York magazine, book editor Judith Regan called foul on a column Wolff wrote about her, as did Andrew Sullivan. Both disputed Wolff’s portrayals of them.\n\nAdvertisement 6\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nYet these charges did not derail Wolff’s career, and in Trump – the uncensored New York mogul – the writer has found a subject who encapsulates many of the themes and issues that have kept his pen busy for his entire career. In his columns and television appearances over the last year, Wolff has repeatedly criticized the media for missing the Trump story – the very tale his book seeks to lay out.\n\n“This is the most extraordinary story of our time,” Wolff told CNBC after the November 2016. “It is time to listen to these people. They won.”\n\nOur website is the place for the latest breaking news, exclusive scoops, longreads and provocative commentary.
