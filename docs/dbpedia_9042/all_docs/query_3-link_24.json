He has authored a number of amicus briefs to the U.S. Supreme Court and has given numerous academic presentations nationally and internationally. In 2001, he was named a Fulbright scholar and served on the law faculty at Doshisha University (Japan).

He speaks English, Japanese, and Hebrew.\n\n“Almost all of my work is influenced by my Jewish heritage and my writing and focus on religious minorities naturally benefits the Jewish Community. Moreover, I have written about the Israeli Basic Laws and will be writing a book chapter on Antisemitism in modern Europe (the book was delayed due to covid). Several of my books, book chapters, and articles directly reference Jewish concerns. I would like to join the Serling Institute because of my commitment to Jewish values and the protection of religious minorities. As an observant Jew I would like to be more involved in the intellectual Jewish life (research and programming) on campus.”\n\nGail Richmond\n\nDr. Gail Richmond is a Professor of Science & Urban Education in the Department of Teacher Education at MSU. She is the Co-Editor of the Journal of Teacher Education. Dr.Richmond traveled to Israel this year in support of a research exchange between doctoral students in STEM education fields at MSU and those at both the Weizmann and Technion Institutes. She has recently been named a Fulbright Senior Specialist, and hopes to use this as a vehicle to return to Israel to work on issues of pathways to STEM teacher certification, teacher induction and informal science education. Currently, Dr. Richmond is writing an NSF grant proposal in collaboration with a colleague from the Technion and the Kellogg Biological Station, and working to provide opportunities for collaboration and cultural exchange.\n\nCAMPUS ADDRESS: 319 Erickson Hall\n\nPHONE: 517-432-4854\n\nEMAIL: gailr@msu.edu\n\nErik Shapiro\n\nErik Shapiro is Associate Chair of Research and a Professor in the Department of Radiology. He also serves as Director of the Biomedical Imaging Division in the Institute for Quantitative Health Science and Engineering. His Molecular and Cellular Imaging Laboratory (MCIL) develops and uses magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET) and x-ray computed tomography (CT) for molecular and cellular imaging of biological phenomena, regenerative medicine, and early detection of disease.\n\nDr. Shapiro graduated from the State University of New York at Binghamton with a degree in chemistry and holds a MS and Ph.D. in chemistry from the University of Pennsylvania. He conducted his post-doctoral work in molecular imaging at the National Institutes of Health and spent six years as junior faculty at Yale University School of Medicine before joining MSU in 2012. Amongst his awards is a National Institutes of Health New Innovator Award.\n\nDr. Shapiro is interested in learning about how Israeli scientists maintain an exciting biotechnology entrepreneurial environment and achieve their many scientific accomplished in a context of limited financial resources and constant external threats and pressures. This information can prove useful even here in America where funds and resources can sometimes be in short supply. Further, he is interested in expanding collaborations with imaging experts at The Technion, Hebrew University and The Weizmann Institute.\n\nCAMPUS ADDRESS: Radiology Building, Room 184\n\nPHONE: 517-884-3270\n\nEMAIL: shapir86@msu.edu\n\nMorgan Shipley\n\nMorgan Shipley is the Inaugural Foglio Endowed Chair of Spirituality and Associate Professor of Religious Studies at Michigan State University. His research focuses on 1) the place and experience of new religious movements in American history; 2) the connections between religion, spirituality, and social justice; and 3) the emergence and implications of secular spirituality. These foci regularly engage with the Jewish experience in America, specifically as it relates to new religious orientations and the pursuit of a more just and equal society. He has published on Jewish mysticism and connections between Judaism, Jewish movements, and identity (“Kabbalah (Women and)” and “Hasidism (Women/Feminine in),” both in Encyclopedia of Women in World Religions: Faith and Culture Across History (Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-CLIO, 2018).\n\nAt Michigan State University, he has taught three courses that directly engage with Judaism: Religious Studies 412: Jewish Mysticism (Fall 2023, Fall 2017, Fall 2016), Religious Studies 310: Judaism (Spring 2018, Spring 2017), and HST 317: American Jewish History (Spring 2022). He has worked with colleagues from Jewish Studies on two initiatives designed to advance MSU’s commitment to DEI: along with Professors Kirsten Fermaglich and Amy Simon, developed a 9-week series on combatting antisemitism and Islamophobia as part of the MSU Dialogue Series and a new four-session live “conversation” model, which was co-convened along with Professors Yael Aronoff, Mohammad Khalil, Kirsten Fermaglich, Amy Simon, and Ariana Mentzel.\n\nCAMPUS ADDRESS: 732 Wells Hall, 619 Red Cedar Rd\n\nEMAIL: shiple18@msu.edu\n\nRonen Steinberg\n\nRonen Steinberg (Ph.D., History, The University of Chicago) is an assistant professor of history at Michigan State University.

Tetreault\n\nChantal M. Tetreault (Ph.D., Linguistic Anthropology, University of Texas at Austin) is an Associate Professor in the Anthropology Department.\n\n“My new research examines how shared notions of Jewishness and Jewish community are produced through a negotiation of practices (rather than beliefs) within a Reconstructionist shul (synagogue). More specifically, I consider what it means to be a Jewish community when both a shared monologic belief or a consistent practice is absent. Using oral histories and ethnography, I explore the co-construction of senses of community among Jewish adherents of apparent mixed beliefs and/or practices. Building upon a panel from the 2019 American Anthropological Association, I am currently co-editing a special issue for the journal Religion and Society (slated for 2021), which will feature my research on constructions of “sharedness” in Jewish belief and practice among oral history participants in a Reconstructionist community. This research is a collaborative project with Dr. Kirsten Fermaglich, whose research focuses on Jewish Academic Communities in the United States After World War II.”\n\nMargot B. Valles\n\nMargot B. Valles (Ph.D., Comparative Literature, Doctoral Minor in Jewish Studies, Indiana University) is an Assistant Professor in the department of English.

Aside from performing in Israel with some of Israel’s best ensembles such as the Tel-Aviv soloists, The Israeli Contemporary Ensemble and more, he continues to work with composers from Israel and commissioning new works. During his recent sabbatical semester to Israel, Yehuda concert toured and recorded a new work written for him by composer Daniel Akiva: Safaradic Anthology for clarinet and guitar to be released soon on CD. Yehuda’s interest in Jewish music led to performances around the world of major Jewish works and the launch of the Klezmer group Guy and the Yehudas in Jacksonville, Florida. In collaboration with the Serling Institute, and the College of Music, Yehuda plans to bring more Jewish and Israeli art music to Michigan State University and to engage the surrounding community with the experience of Jewish, Israeli Music and culture."
