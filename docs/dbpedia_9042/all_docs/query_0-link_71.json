        "text": "BURN RATE: The amount of money a promising start-up company consumes each month in excess of its income. Burn capital too fast, and you are out of business; burn capital too slowly, and you risk falling behind in the competition to innovate, expand and gain market share. \"If possible, the Internet business has grown even more absurd. There are still no successful business models; we've upped the ante from unreal net worths of hundreds of millions of dollars to billions; and we've managed to create a myth that everyone must have a Web site.\""
