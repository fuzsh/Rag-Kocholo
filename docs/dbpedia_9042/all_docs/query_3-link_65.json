        "text": "Third Millennium Thinking: Creating Sense in a World of Nonsense\n\nSaul Perlmutter, Robert MacCoun and John Campbell\n\n🎯 A bestselling book on Five Books in 2024\n\nIn Third Millennium Thinking: Creating Sense in a World of Nonsense a Nobel-prize winning physicist, a philosopher and a social scientist together give a clear, accessible and enlightening guide to the tools of thinking that make science work. This is a brilliant book by eminent thinkers in their fields who are also superb communicators. It's a really enjoyable read and a great book for anyone who wants to think more clearly about evidence, argument, reason and the need for a degree of intellectual humility.\n\nRead expert recommendations\n\nThe Experience Machine: How Our Minds Predict and Shape Reality\n\nby Andy Clark\n\nThe Experience Machine by cognitive philosopher Andy Clark is about predictive processing. This is the view that we construct our reality from expectations, and that our relationship with the world is active: we are never simply passive recipients of incoming data. Clark provides an engaging overview of the state of research and how predictive processing should change how we think about what we are.\n\nRead expert recommendations\n\nWhy Veganism Matters\n\nby Gary Francione\n\nIn Why Veganism Matters Gary Francione, a professor of law and philosophy at Rutgers University, argues that veganism is a moral imperative. He is a self-declared abolitionist when it comes to animal rights, and critical of the idea that we should focus on animal welfare, minimising their suffering and using humane methods of slaughter. Rather, he argues that we should abolish all uses of animals and stop treating them as chattels.\n\nRead expert recommendations\n\nThe Art of Cycling: Philosophy, Meaning, and a Life on Two Wheels\n\nby James Hibbard\n\nJames Hibbard, a former American professional cyclist, threads together the story of his cycling career, a road trip, and philosophy, which he studied and looked to for answers, but found inadequate. \"Thinking, when divorced from the physicality of our existence, fails, \" he says, \"I very much felt that it failed me.\"\n\nRead expert recommendations\n\nThe Idea of Prison Abolition\n\nby Tommie Shelby\n\nThe Idea of Prison Abolition is based on a series of lectures by Tommie Shelby, a professor of Philosophy and of African and African American Studies at Harvard. In a way, it's a response to the work of Angela Davis. Shelby is ultimately not on the side of prison abolition, but his exploration of the issue is well worth reading.\n\nRead expert recommendations\n\nJustice for Animals: Our Collective Responsibility\n\nby Martha Nussbaum\n\nJustice for Animals is a very clearly written and persuasive call to action on behalf of non-human animals by American philosopher Martha Nussbaum. After outlining the harm we're doing by using five specific examples (a mother elephant, a humpback whale, a fictional pig, a finch and a stray dog), she writes: \"The extent of our own implication in practices that harm animals should make every person with a conscience consider what we can all do to change this situation. Pinning guilt is less important than accepting the fact that humanity as a whole has a collective duty to face and solve these problems.\" The impetus behind writing the book is also very affecting: it's because of her daughter, who was a passionate advocate for animals and died young. In the book, Nussbaum takes a 'capabilities approach' to develop a new theoretical basis for thinking about justice and injustice to animals as she feels \"the dominant theories in this area are defective and that mine will direct action better.\"\n\nRead expert recommendations\n\nAristotle: Understanding the World's Greatest Philosopher\n\nby John Sellars\n\nAristotle: Understanding the World's Greatest Philosopher is the latest book by John Sellars, a Reader in Philosophy at Royal Holloway, University of London, who excels at writing short books for a general audience on ancient philosophy.

He's relevant today because he asked some of the big questions about the value of life, freedom, and the experience of consciousness. The book is edited with an introduction by John Kaag (author of Sick Souls, Healthy Minds: How William James Can Save Your Life) and Jonathan van Belle.\n\nRead expert recommendations\n\nSophie’s World: A Graphic Novel About the History of Philosophy (Volume 1: Socrates to Galileo)\n\nby Jostein Gaarder, Nicoby (illustrator) & Vincent Zabus\n\nA graphic novel based on Jostein Gaarder's Sophie's World. It's updated (at the beginning Sophie and a friend are planning to meet at a climate protest) but also a bit more accessible than the original, which was a bestseller in the 1990s. While the original Sophie's World was written for teenagers, it's actually a little hard to understand unless you already know a bit about philosophy. This version, adapted by Belgian comics writer Vincent Zabus, presumes no knowledge and so is a good way for complete beginners to start out on philosophy.\n\nRead expert recommendations\n\nHow to Be Authentic: Simone de Beauvoir and the Quest for Fulfillment\n\nby Skye C Cleary\n\nHow to Be Authentic (called How to Be You: Simone de Beauvoir and the Art of Authentic Living in the UK edition) is an exploration of French philosopher and feminist Simone de Beauvoir (1908-1986) and her thinking about life and how to live it.

If you haven't read The Second Sex, the book is also useful for understanding Beauvoir's thinking on what it means to be a woman.\n\nRead expert recommendations\n\nOn Consolation: Finding Solace in Dark Times\n\nby Michael Ignatieff\n\nIn On Consolation Michael Ignatieff, historian, writer and former Canadian politician, looks at what we can learn from each across the millennia about how to deal with grief and pain.

What's also very nice about this edition is that the aphorisms are provided both in the original German and in English translation. This is a book to read for a deeper understanding of Kafka and his thinking, rather than witty/universal quotes à la Nietzsche.\n\nRead expert recommendations\n\nWhat Mental Illness Really Is… (and what it isn’t)\n\nby Lucy Foulkes\n\nOut in paperback and with a new title, What Mental Illness Really Is (and what it isn't), is by academic psychologist Lucy Foulkes.

A wonderful introduction puts the philosophy in context, comparing the ancient Greek or Pyrrhonist tradition of skepticism with what we mean when we describe someone as 'skeptical' today, and looking at what its value in the modern world might be.\n\nAs with all the books in the Ancient Wisdom for Modern Readers series, Bett then selects passages from Sextus Empiricus—the only Greek skeptic whose works have survived—and translates them, also providing the original Greek on facing pages.\n\nRead expert recommendations\n\nWomen of Ideas: Interviews from Philosophy Bites\n\nedited by Suki Finn\n\nWomen of Ideas is a collection of interviews with philosophers from the Philosophy Bites podcast.

Writing in the aftermath of the French Revolution, Wollstonecraft, though entirely self-educated, was a serious thinker. \"Like many of her contemporaries, she sought to understand the circumstances that led to the stupendous events defining her time, but more than most she weighed the ethical choices they forged on those witnessing them,\" Tomaselli writes. Wollstonecraft was a prodigious writer, who earned her living by her pen, but died much too young, after giving birth to her second child (Mary, who would later write Frankenstein).\n\nRead expert recommendations\n\nSick Souls, Healthy Minds: How William James Can Save Your Life\n\nby John Kaag\n\nWilliam James, one of the founders of pragmatism and empirical psychology, struggled with the question of what made life worth living.

Dave Edmonds, who recommended the best books on ethical problems for Five Books, and Bertie Fraser, founder of Storynory.com, do a brilliant job of bringing to life Dotty, who is trying her best to fit in as normal 12-year old girl, but can't help being weird.
