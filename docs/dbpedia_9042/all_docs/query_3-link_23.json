        "text": "This list has been selected from books reviewed since the Holiday Books issue of December 2002. It is meant to suggest some of the high points in this year's fiction and poetry, nonfiction, children's books, mysteries and science fiction. The books are arranged alphabetically under genre headings.The complete reviews of these books may be found at nytimes.com/books.\n\nFICTION & POETRY\n\nABANDON: A Romance. By Pico Iyer. (Knopf, $24.) A graceful novel whose hero, an English graduate student of Sufi mystical poetry who hopes to uncover that within himself which passeth show, heads first for California and later for Iran, where he and the woman he is traveling with improve their understanding of mystical poetry and of themselves.\n\nALL OVER CREATION. By Ruth Ozeki. (Viking, $24.95.) A sophisticated novel in which dread and hope coexist and the end of nature is envisioned through the impact of genetically modified crops on a potato-growing family and the representatives of pro- and antimodification factions who descend on their Idaho potato farm.\n\nAMERICAN WOMAN. By Susan Choi. (HarperCollins, $24.95.) A fictional account of the intersection of the radical activist Wendy Yoshimura with the fugitive Patty Hearst, who appeared to have adopted the values and perspectives of the revolutionaries who kidnapped her in 1974. The revolutionary life, it turns out, is mainly squalor and dulled anxiety; time outwears everything, and rapidly too.\n\nAND NOW YOU CAN GO. By Vendela Vida. (Knopf, $19.95.) A swift, spare first novel of self-discovery whose heroine is the victim of a terrifying crime (but no grave physical damage). She returns to everyday life through a number of low-pressure encounters whose significance is rendered without being raised to the false cosmic.\n\nANJA THE LIAR. By Thomas Moran. (Riverhead, $25.95.) Moran explores the moral climate of the post-World War II era through characters (Anja, a girl from Krakow who was once a Nazi informer; a German engineer; a murderous woman who ran a Chetnik unit) who, like their nations, have had experiences so extreme there is no prescription for recovery.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
