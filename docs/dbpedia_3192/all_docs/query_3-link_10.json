        "text": "1) Automobili Lamborghini S.p.A -\n\n\"Fast\", the first word which pops in our head when we see Lamborghini or even think of it. Lamborghini is a very dynamic brand creating super-fast and luxury sports car which has been manufactured in Italy. The company was found by Lamborghini as Automobili Ferruccio Lamborghini S.p.A. in 1963, currently owned by Volkswagen Group through its subsidiary Audi. Providing various products in their product line with \"Almost all giving the Italian feel\" as their tag line highlights. Lamborghini focuses on a market with high income in the upper-class society. The brand positioning is handled well by providing \"Premium super sports cars with superior performance\".\n\nAston Martin Lagonda Limited (Competitor) -\n\nAston Martin is one of the greatest competitors for Lamborghini right now. It is a British manufacturer of luxury sports cars. The company was found and formed by Lionel Martin and Robert Bamford in London, 1913. Here, the main reason to compare Lamborghini with Aston Martin is because these impressive and extraordinary brands have a common target market and also almost similar and competitive products to offer the customers (talking about the features rather than the physical product). But the question arises, why is one brand better than other? What exactly makes your brand unique? The main point of differentiation between these two brands comes when the personality of these 2 brands are studied in depth. Aston Martin is known as the \"Gentlemens Sports Car\", whereas, Lamborghini is considered as \"Stylish Looking Super Sports Car\", which had always ruled the market with its trademark Scissor Doors.\n\n2)Dolce & Gabbana (D&G) -\n\nDolce and Gabbana is an Italian Luxury fashion brand formed and functional from 1985 in Legnano, Italy. The formation of this brand was started by 2 designers met in Milan in 1980. The brand has a target market with customers from the age group of 25 to 30 focusing on a stable financial background customer. It is of no doubt that the brand (D&G) has a very strong brand image and have quality products provided to their customers. D&G is positioned to provide stylish, modern, unique and innovative luxury products. It has a strong brand image which makes it easy to spread in the new emerging markets. D&G has retained its status by having good loyal customers who have a deep feeling of modern and unique luxury products with the best quality and services provided. D&G provides a small message and concept in their tagline which is delivered for their customers and is unique but also very simple. \"It's not what you wear, but how you wear it.\" this tagline shows the main concept hidden which is providing creative ideas to utilize one product.\n\nGUCCI (Competitor) -\n\nGucci is an Italian brand providing luxury fashion products to their customers. Having a great expanded market and equally strong customer loyalty, Gucci stands above most of the other brands to compete with D&G brand. Gucci was found in 1921 in Florence. The main similarity the above 2 brands have is the target market which is the middle aged and having a good income. But not all brands are the same after all, Gucci is aiming at providing products lasting longer and also providing the best quality, whereas, D&G focuses on providing the most modern product and keep their customers more up to date with the latest style.\n\n3) Giorgio Armani -\n\nAn Italian brand providing the best quality apparel and accessories to the customers. Giorgio Armani being the main founder and owner of the brand, was a tailor himself. They have variety of products to offer the customers with various materials used like: garments, apparel clothing, jewelry, pens, and also perfumes. The target market Armani focuses on, is the young spending men and women who prefer quality and brand image over the price. Providing a positive experience by understanding and speaking to the customers is very well applied when it comes to Armani. This results in containing good and loyal customers in the market. Armani is known for its increasing pace in the market and taking over the market with its essence. Armani is a brand I personally feel that is worth the expense, since they have the best quality and also the best services.\n\nGuess (Competitor) -\n\nGuess is an American clothing and fashion brand and retailer providing apparel clothing for babies, men and women. Guess has various other products like: watches, jewelry etc. So, the next question comes our mind is that what exactly is the difference from Armani. Armani being a luxury fashion brand, providing various products which has a motive provide a luxury feel rather whereas, Guess has a focus more based on providing products for all age group.\n\n4) Nutella -\n\nNutella is a brand producing various sweet products or in short sweetened hazelnut cocoa manufactured in Italy. Nutella is a brand under the company Ferrero that was introduced in 1965. Creating a market of chocolate lovers or let's say making the people love Nutella, was a huge task when it comes to health and age. Nutella had smartly promoted its products in such a way that they have a major market dominance when we think of chocolate spread. Nutella has positioned themselves as the right breakfast spread for a family breakfast. Nutella has made a mind set in their customers for a healthy and fast breakfast. Similarly, their market target was for the new generation kids and teenagers. The brand has provided an experience of providing quality and taste worthy products which the customers are very loyal to.\n\nHershey's (Competitor) -\n\nAn American brand which was known as the Hershey Foods Corporation, now commonly known as Hersheys is one of the largest chocolate manufacturers in the world. The company provides 100 types of different chocolates and chocolate-based products which tells us why Hersheys stand a threat to Nutella. The market segment of Hersheys is similar to that of Nutella where, they both focus on middle and upper-class children and adults. Hersheys is known to provide premium quality of product at a premium price whereas Nutella is more focused on the taste, Quality and preference of the customers.\n\n5) Tic – Tac -\n\nTic-Tac is an Italian manufacturer under the parent company Ferrero. Tic-Tac is a manufacturer of small hard mints, which have taken over the market with great advertisement and promotion. Tic-Tac is a well-established brand spread over 100 countries, producing various flavors. Tic-Tac was first introduced in production in 1968. Some of us may recognize it as mint as most of us may prefer It as a mouth freshener. Tic-Tac focuses more on teenagers and the youth population from middle and upper class. Tic-Tac has an amazing and a very simple package to their final product which is handy and also small. Their packaging is one major reason behind their success in the market today. Tic-Tac is well positioned by providing low calories mint for everyone of all age groups. Tic-Tac as a brand and also as a product has delivered well the energetic and refreshed experience as their tagline and most of the ad's deliver. Their main concept is to refresh the young tired minds of the youth.\n\nMentos (Competitor) -\n\nMentos is a brand producing Scotch mint which is majorly manufactured in Netherlands and are available all over the world with various flavors. Mentos is known for its high-quality product provided to the customers with an attractive package. Just like Tic-Tac, Mentos has the main flavor as Mint and also focuses on the exact same target segment as Tic-Tac. Difference arises when we look deep in the brand Positioning of the two. Tic-Tac focuses on refreshment and energizing the customer and providing low calories mint whereas, Mentos has a very unique concept of creating on the spot idea or instant creative idea of the customer. To make this statement even more clear, the tagline of the brand would help us understand,\"Dimag Ki Batti Jala De.\""
