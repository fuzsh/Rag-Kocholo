        "text": "Back in September, a packed house at the Sala Grande Theatre gave movie director Michael Mann and actor Adam Driver a six-minute standing ovation. Then, Airbnb’s announcement of a new category of home listing, called Icons, turned the Ferrari Museum into the dream bedroom of any Formula One fan. The Ferrari name has shined brightly for most of its existence and still appeals to both car owners and Formula 1 enthusiasts. This is mainly thanks to the man who built and launched one of the most renowned brands and symbols of Italy’s excellence, Enzo Ferrari.\n\nEnzo Ferrari was born in Modena on a snowy February night in 1898. Alfredo Ferrari and Adalgisa Bisbini, together with their son Alfredo, welcomed newborn Enzo, who would soon become passionate about cars and circuits. His early life was marked by many milestones in racing and car manufacturing, culminating in 1929 with the launch of Scuderia Ferrari, a sporting society that allowed its members to race. That was just the start of a long career that would put Maranello on the map for all those interested in Formula One and car racing.\n\nToday, his legacy lives on at the Museo Casa Enzo Ferrari in Modena, which includes the restored house where he was born and a new futuristic automotive design gallery, as well as at the Museo Ferrari Maranello, the company museum dedicated to the Ferrari sports car brand.\n\nTwo colors make Ferrari recognized and recognizable worldwide: yellow, which recalls giallo Modena, the color of Enzo Ferrari’s town, and of course red, symbolizing passion, love, and attachment to both the family and their brand.\n\nWe visited Maranello and the Museo Ferrari a few days before the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix, also known as the Gran Premio di Imola. This year’s race was particularly special: it is the closest circuit to the Ferrari factory and comes a year after deadly floods hit the region the week of the 2023 race. The event gathered more than 250,000 visitors to the area between Bologna and Imola and the museums in Modena and Maranello received much attention, too, with people coming from around the world to learn about the history of the brand and see the cars produced throughout the years, including the distinctive race cars of Ferrari’s golden age in F1.\n\nMuseo Ferrari Maranello’s Director, Michele Pignatti Morano, gave us a special tour and shared fascinating stories about the cars on display. “This museum has a central idea, which is related to its location close to the factory. You can see photos of historical Ferrari manufacturing and more recent ones. Enzo Ferrari always considered the most important part of the car to be the machine frame, which he used to build himself, including the engine and wheels. Then, he would pass it to the coachbuilders to do the rest. The choice of names like Scaglietti, Touring, Pininfarina, and Pignale was critical and genial. Enzo Ferrari was like the tailor of a beautiful dress.”\n\nCars are everywhere in the museum, yet the reproduction of Enzo Ferrari’s office desk is a must-see. The famous purple pen, the airplane model that inspired the cavallino on the Ferrari logo, a horse statue, and the phone are all there. History says that the cavallino was painted on the side of the plane of Francesco Baracca, an ace of the Italian Air Force and national hero of World War I. In 1923, after Francesco’s death, his mother told Enzo something prophetic: “Put it on your car and it will bring lots of good luck.”\n\nFerrari manufacturing focuses on the concept of Formula Uomo. “If you want an excellent car, you need to put people in the best conditions to make it happen,” Director Pignatti Morano explained. “Enzo Ferrari used to say: ‘A factory is made of people, machines, and brakes. Ferrari is made by people. It’s the people who make the product.’”\n\nWhen visiting the museum, you’ll see supercars, limited series, and tailor-made cars.\n\nSupercars, representing the highest technology at a given time, are often revolutionary due to their engines, materials, or design. When you ask someone at Ferrari about their favorite car, the answer is always: “the next one,” meaning each new car is an improvement. This is why all the supercars at the museum are in the same room and are part of limited editions. “If we get requests for 400 cars, we will always bring only 399 to the market because the one missing will create more interest and buy into the idea of exclusivity that belongs to our brand. An example is the Enzo car, of which we commercialized only 399 cars; the 400th was donated to the Pope before being auctioned to raise money for a good cause,” Pignatti Morano explains.\n\nEach tailor-made car is unique and customized, including the interior materials and colors. At the Museo Enzo Ferrari, you’ll find the collection “One of A Kind.” Each year, on February 18th, Enzo Ferrari’s birthday, a new exhibit opens and lasts for a full year: the display celebrates the craftsmanship of each masterpiece emerging from the Maranello factory gates and reveals the exclusivity of these one-of-a-kind cars, each expressing the personality, taste, and desires of individual Ferrari owners.\n\nWith more than 740,000 visitors in 2023, the goal of the museum is to provide an unforgettable experience for everyone. “This is a great challenge. Our museums are always open, except for Christmas and New Year. We want to give our fans an unforgettable time; many of them travel from far away. When it comes to displaying our cars, there are no safety barriers between them and visitors. It doesn’t matter the cost of the car; you’ll always get to see them up close. Most of our cars come from private collectors who work with us to get their cars displayed.”\n\nAt the moment, an area is dedicated to a temporary exhibition, “Roaring 50s,” on the history of the Modena street circuit, used between the 1950s and 1976 when the last motorcycle Grand Prix took place. Indeed, there was a time when even small towns had their own autodromo or racetrack. We can see here Taruffi’s car, which brings us all the way back to the years of the Mille Miglia, a car race held on public roads in Italy from 1927 to 1957: its name in Italian means “one thousand miles,” and the number you see on each car shows the exact time when the car started the race so judges could know the amount of time taken to complete it.\n\nWith visitors increasingly enthusiastic about the Ferrari brand, especially in the US, the museum became part of a brand-new initiative launched by Airbnb, the Silicon Valley company offering short-term rentals. “The decision to become one of the Airbnb Icons was made with the idea of experiencing the museum in a new, different way. Our museum is the closest you can be to our cars: visiting and getting to sleep surrounded by our racing cars is like a night at the museum: you go to the Gran Premio in Imola, followed by dinner at a special place, Il Cavallino restaurant, before spending the night at the Sale delle Vittorie, where all trophies are shown.” Pignatti Morano continues: “The setup of this exhibition room changes to arrange the bed and create the perfect atmosphere for guests. We are very proud of being part of this project as it’s amazing to offer something special without diminishing the value of the brand.”\n\nWhen Enzo Ferrari created the logo, he added the giallo Modena because he was proud of his connection to the land. He opened the factory here, investing in the local economy and jobs. “Today, we are pushing this project further through the ‘Discover Ferrari and Pavarotti’s Land’ program, with a stop at Luciano Pavarotti’s house, which stands between our museum and the Enzo Ferrari Museum in Modena. Additionally, visitors can taste local foods and ingredients, from Parmigiano Reggiano to Prosciutto di Modena and local aceto balsamico. A full experience around the land, the history of Modena, and its surroundings, with special attention to what’s local and off the beaten path.”\n\nWe concluded the visit with a look at one of the most important exhibits in the museum, the P4, one of the cars that won the Daytona race in 1967, at a time when Enzo Ferrari refused the offer to be acquired by Ford. We also experienced the semi-professional simulator and felt the exhilaration of driving a Prancing Horse F1 single-seater. It was a moment to experience what Enzo Ferrari used to say: “Every Ferrari is a dream; a dream that never stops evolving.” Then and now."
