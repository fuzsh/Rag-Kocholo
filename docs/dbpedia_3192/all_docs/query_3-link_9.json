        "text": "Consider this a guide\n\nMissoni / Prada / Palm Angels\n\nThe world is very large, and if you are someone who considers yourself a lover of fashion, then you're brand list is one that is ever-growing, ever-evolving, and ever-changing. The importance of Italian designers, fashion houses, and brands cannot be emphasized enough as without their impact, innovation, and influence the world of couture and style as a whole wouldn't be the same. We've explored some of the brands of numerous countries—from Kenya to Korea, the US, Britain and more. Today we'll be looking at some of the best Italian clothing brands that you should have on your radar at all times. Some of these you already know like the back of your hand because they've been major power players in the fashion biz for most if not all of your life (perhaps even before you were born), others are on the newer/emerging side of the game, but very much creating a legitimate space and name for themselves.\n\nLet's take a look at the best of the best, shall we?\n\nRELATED: 25 British Clothing Brands to Have on Your Radar\n\n1. Missoni\n\nLocated In: Varese\n\nWhat we recommend from them: Knitwear\n\nProduct Range: Apparel, accessories, lifestyle\n\nPrice Range: $500 - $1,000\n\nFounded in 1953, Missoni is one of the Godfather's of Italian fashion, becoming known for their dedication to knitwear products. In the decades since, however, Missoni has expanded beyond their initial designs and creations to become a full-fledged clothing brand that offers apparel, lifestyle products, and accessories for men, women, and kids. They even have home products if that's something of interest as well! One of our favorite brands for sure.\n\nVISIT MISSONI\n\n2. Palm Angels\n\nLocated In: Milan\n\nWhat we recommend from them: Streetwear\n\nProduct Range: Apparel, bags, accessories, shoes, and more\n\nPrice Range: $300 - $700\n\nPalm Angels is just the embodiment of cool. If you've ever worn any of their clothing, then you're already aware of the fact that it instantly takes you from 0 to 100 real quick. If you weren't the hottest kid on the block before, well, you are now. Get you some Palm Angels. Stat!\n\nVISIT PALM ANGELS\n\n3. Prada\n\nLocated In: Milan\n\nWhat we recommend from them: Ready-to-wear clothing\n\nProduct Range: Ready-to-wear clothes, accessories, shoes, sunglasses, handbags\n\nPrice Range: $1,000 - $3,000\n\nPrada's roots date back to 1913 in Milan when the brand was founded by Mario Prada. Fast forward over a century later, and Prada remains one of the biggest and most powerful fashion houses in the world housing everything from ready-to-wear clothing that can be often be spotted in their elaborate shows and presentations from the year/season before, all the way to handbags if that's a fashion interest of yours. We also have to give major props to their eyewear and fragrance game. Prada scents are sensational.\n\nVISIT PRADA\n\n4. Moncler\n\nLocated In: Trebaseleghe\n\nWhat we recommend from them: Outerwear\n\nProduct Range: Outerwear, ready-to-wear, shoes, accessories, and more\n\nPrice Range: $1,000 - $2,000\n\nAlright boom. Next up we've got Moncler. What started as a down jacket boutique in 1952 has now progressed a brand that offers just about everything you can think of in the street and outerwear realm. Their standout, however, remains what they first got in the game for—their jackets, which continues to be the standard and gets more technical and edgy with each passing year. We're huge fans of Moncler over here.\n\nVISIT MONCLER\n\n5. Moschino\n\nLocated In: Milan\n\nWhat we recommend from them: Streetwear\n\nProduct Range: Apparel, bags, shoes, accessories, and more\n\nPrice Range: $1,000 - $6,000\n\nMoschino, Moschino, Moschino, where would we be without Moschino? Celebrating their 40th anniversary this year, the brand has had its impact and influence in just about every category from hip hop to goth culture. What has always separated Moschino from the pack is their bold, funky, unique designs, which only continued to grow under the leadership of Jeremy Scott. Scott exited after ten years with the company in March 2023, and as of this writing we're not sure who will be next to take over. Guess we'll find out when you guys do.\n\nVISIT MOSCHINO\n\n6. Gucci\n\nLocated In: Florence\n\nWhat we recommend from them: Ready-to-wear\n\nProduct Range: Outerwear, ready-to-wear, accessories, and more\n\nPrice Range: $1,000 - $3,000\n\nGucci and it's legendary impact on fashion would take a completely separate article to write about, so we'll spare you a retelling of what you already know. What we will say is, that over 100 years into their existence, the brand continues to reinvent themselves over and over again without ever leaving the elements that defines them as...Gucci. And it's marvelous.\n\nVISIT GUCCI\n\n7. Marni\n\nLocated In: Milan\n\nWhat we recommend from them: Bohemian style clothes\n\nProduct Range: Apparel, outerwear, accessories, bags, sunglasses, and more\n\nPrice Range: $700 - $2,500\n\nYou know Marni, you love Marni, and it's all because of their creative take on fashion (their latest collaboration with No Vacancy Inn is one of many examples). Founded by Consuelo Castiglioni in 1994, Marni is a relatively younger brand compared to others included on this list, but we've seen them evolve through the latter half of the 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s. The 2020s have been all about making a statement as well, with the brand only continuing to push well beyond expectations.\n\nVISIT MARNI\n\n8. Valentino\n\nLocated In: Rome\n\nWhat we recommend from them: Ready-to-wear clothing\n\nProduct Range: Ready-to-wear, bags, shoes, accessories, and must-haves\n\nPrice Range: $1,000 - $3,000\n\nSame deal with Valentino—a long standing brand that doesn't need an introduction that you're already well aware of. Valentino is...Valentino. What more can you about a brand that has been a mastermind in ready-to-wear fashion and accessories for decades upon decades? There's not much more we can say that hasn't been said in the last fifty years or so. Like we just said, Valentino is...Valentino.\n\nVISIT VALENTINO\n\n9. Loro Piana\n\nLocated In: Milan\n\nWhat we recommend from them: Luxury\n\nProduct Range: Ready-to-wear, accessories, and shoes\n\nPrice Range: $1,000 - $5,000\n\nIf looking for the finest clothing made from cashmere or marino wool, then Loro Piana is tried, true, and tested. Loro Piana is a brand that has been able to strike a perfect balance between formal/upscale clothing and streetwear, with their pieces being considered generational. A Loro Piana piece from 2008 still holds up in 2023, and that's one of the most important factors in investment fashion pickups where you could be spending quite a bit of money—how much wear you can get out your buy, and how many years it can last.\n\nVISIT LORO PIANA\n\n10. Giorgio Armani\n\nLocated In: Milan\n\nWhat we recommend from them: Ready-to-wear\n\nProduct Range: Ready-to-wear, accessories, perfume, and more\n\nPrice Range: $500 - $1,000\n\nEasy, breezy, beautiful Armani. Home of the minimalist look and style. While there are some brands like to play around with patterns, colors, etc., Armani is a brand that keeps simple and to the basics, which is something that has and continues to work. We also like the fact that while Armani is a top fashion house, the prices of their clothing is still on the affordable side. You can easily find a nice blazer, shirt, etc, for around $300 to $400, and the certainly easier on the bank account then spending thousands of dollars in one go.\n\nVISIT ARMANI\n\n11. Fendi\n\nLocated In: Rome\n\nWhat we recommend from them: Ready-to-wear\n\nProduct Range: Ready-to-wear, apparel, shoes, leather goods, and more\n\nPrice Range: $1,000 - $2,000\n\nFounded in 1925, Fendi has been in action now for almost a full century, and has been a part of the LVMH family since 2001. While we've become accustomed to the Fendi logo that dominates some their clothing and handbags (you know Fendi when you see it), the brand has began to drift away from that over the past years with more solid colored minimalist items to establish a good balance between subtle and standout.\n\nVISIT FENDI\n\n12. Versace\n\nLocated In: Milan\n\nWhat we recommend from them: Luxury, ready-to-wear\n\nProduct Range: Clothing, accessories, jewelry, beachwear, and more\n\nPrice Range: $500 - $2,000\n\nIt's the House of Versace everyone. Since its establishment in 1978 by Gianni Versace, the fashion house has become synonymous with bright colors and their iconic logo. While has been traditionally known for their luxurious formal and evening wear styles, streetwear themes have been growing presence in their catalog in recent years as well. Everybody needs at least one Versace piece in their lifetimes, trust us when we say it's worth every penny spent.\n\nVISIT VERSACE\n\n13. Stone Island\n\nLocated In: Ravarino\n\nWhat we recommend from them: Luxury sportswear\n\nProduct Range: Knitwear, bags, fleece wear, coats, and more\n\nPrice Range: $500 - $1,000\n\nUnique clothing with an innovative approach is what Stone Island has become known for, as the brand refuses to be boxed into classification labels. According to the Stone Island crew, the company is neither luxury, fashion, or streetwear, but rather a blend of all three—multiple cultures all in one if you will. And they do it beautifully.\n\nVISIT STONE ISLAND\n\n14. Sunnei\n\nLocated In: Milan\n\nWhat we recommend from them: Minimalist fashion\n\nProduct Range: Ready-to-wear, shoes, bags, accessories, and more\n\nPrice Range: $150 - $500\n\nSunnei is fun playful brand that encapsulates the beauty of life, adventure, and romance with their various collections. These days we see fewer broad releases from the brand, which in turn has resulted in higher demand. You know they say—less is sometimes more, and Sunnei is certainly proof of that notion.\n\nVISIT SUNNEI\n\n15. Diesel\n\nLocated In: Milan\n\nWhat we recommend from them: Streetwear\n\nProduct Range: Jeans, apparel, shoes, accessories, and more\n\nPrice Range: $500 - $1,000\n\nDiesel started off as a very small clothing brand, and now they are, ya know, kind of big deal. Now deemed as global lifestyle and streetwear company, Diesel's products bring the edge—perfect if you're somebody heavily into urban punk/goth scene. We also heavily rock with their jeans—there's nothing like a pair of jeans from Diesel.\n\nVISIT DIESEL\n\n16. ZEGNA\n\nLocated In: Milan\n\nWhat we recommend from them: Luxury menswear\n\nProduct Range: Ready-to-wear, sneakers, suits, and more\n\nPrice Range: $1,000 - $2,500\n\nZEGNA is one of those brands that you just get lost in while browsing because you don't even know where to begin. Their suits are incredible, but so are their basic staples (shirts, trousers, accessories). A purchase from ZEGNA does involve a hefty price tag, but this another brand we consider along the lines of an investment that can last you a very long time. The pieces are that timeless.\n\nVISIT ZEGNA\n\n17. Rubinacci\n\nLocated In: Naples\n\nWhat we recommend from them: Luxury menswear\n\nProduct Range: Outerwear, apparel, shoes, blazers, and more\n\nPrice Range: $400 - $700\n\nFounded 1932, Rubinacci is the place to go for your luxury menswear needs—specifically when it comes to upscale and formal wear. The tailoring is super crisp and on point, the quality of their clothes are superb and versatile, and those are just a few of the things we like about the brand. Check them out if you haven't already.\n\nVISIT RUBINACCI\n\n18. Canali\n\nLocated In: Sovico\n\nWhat we recommend from them: Luxury clothing\n\nProduct Range: Suits, knitwear, polos, accessories, and more\n\nPrice Range: $500 - $2,000\n\nSpeaking of places that make rather spiffy suit, we bring you Canali. In addition to their high quality suits which are crafted and tailored to perfection, the brand is also known for their knitwear and polos. It doesn't stop there, Canali also has their own sneaker and accessories line to accompany their many clothing offerings. We're big fans of Canali as well.\n\nVISIT CANALI\n\n19. Luca Faloni\n\nLocated In: London\n\nWhat we recommend from them: Casual clothes with an emphasis on Linen\n\nProduct Range: Tops, bottoms, accessories, and more\n\nPrice Range: $100 - $400\n\nWhile Luca Faloni is headquartered in London, they are an Italian brand and their clothing is made in Italy. Elevated basics are what you can find at Luca Faloni with the brand housing shirts, chinos, t-shirts, jumpers, and more. The quality is phenomenal, and their prices aren't too steep. A great to purchase from.\n\nVISIT LUCA FALONI\n\n20. Brunello Cucinelli\n\nLocated In: Corciano\n\nWhat we recommend from them: Luxury fashion\n\nProduct Range: Jackets, pants, boots, hats and more\n\nPrice Range: $1,500 - $2,000\n\nBrunello Cucinelli is a brand that prides themselves on two major components—minimalism fashion and their craftsmanship. Bruno Cucinelli has one of the most extensive craftsmanship processes out there, using manual skills based on the Greek concept of Technè (which means art or skill). The brand's selection of materials along with the combination of manual work along with tech, results in the highest of quality when it comes to their products.\n\nVISIT BRUNELLO CUCINELLI\n\n21. Boglioli\n\nLocated In: Gambara\n\nWhat we recommend from them: Outerwear\n\nProduct Range: Outerwear, suits, blazers, jackets, and more\n\nPrice Range: $600 - $1,500\n\nWith next-level garments and tailoring, we're not lying when we say Boglioli is one of the best places to cop a suit from. And if suits aren't what you are looking for, then the brand also has you covered with a range of outerwear, knitwear, trousers, and more. The balance of casual and formal is to be commended.\n\nVISIT BOGLIOLI\n\n22. C.P. Company\n\nLocated In: Milan\n\nWhat we recommend from them: Sportswear\n\nProduct Range: Jackets, vests, shirts, pants, and more\n\nPrice Range: $200 - $300\n\nWith legendary designer Massimo Osti already being deemed as “Godfather of sportswear,\" what followed was the creation of Chester Perry brand aka o C.P. Company in 1978. An iconic designer nicknamed “Godfather of sportswear\" obviously knows what they are doing in the sportswear realm, and that has been ever present within C.P.
