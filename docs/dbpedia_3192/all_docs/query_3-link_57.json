        "text": "The value of Made in Italy’s brands continues its double-digit growth year after year, thanks to a solid presence on the world scene. This is what emerges from the BrandZTM Top 30 Most Valuable Italian Brands 2019 ranking, drawn up by WPP and Kantar. According to it, Italian brands have increased their value by 14% in the last 12 months reaching 96.9 billion dollars, despite the economic and political uncertainty. Among the top 5 companies in the ranking are TIM, with a total value of 9.41 billion dollars, Enel (7.94 billion), Kinder Ferrero (the first food brand, 6.79 billion) and Ferrari (4.75 billion). Four other in the Top 30 have seen their value grow by more than 20%. These are Ferrari, Fiat, Campari (+23% with 591 million dollars, in 30th position), and Fendi.\n\nFOOD & BEVERAGE\n\nIn the top ten brands of the ranking, two belong to the Food sector, both by Italy’s confectionery giant Ferrero: they are Kinder (in fourth position) and Nutella (eighth). In eleventh place we can find Ferrero Rocher, 26th comes the multinational pasta company Barilla, 29th comes the coffee company Lavazza and, in 30th place, beverage group Campari.\n\nMADE IN ITALY BRANDS ARE PROTAGONISTS\n\nKantar’s analysis confirmed the exceptionally strong presence of ‘Made in Italy’ on the world scene. Ten brands in the Top 30 show a cross-border exposure of more than 90% (as a combination of turnover, volumes sold, and profitability). BrandZ also showed that brands with a cross-border exposure of more than 50% increased their brand value by about 20% year-on-year, while the value of those with a lower foreign presence remained unchanged.\n\nTHE WEIGHT OF CREATIVITY\n\nInnovation is the main growth factor. Brands perceived as highly innovative increased their value by 17% compared to a growth of 1% of the less innovative ones. A key contribution to innovation can come from creativity; an area where Made in Italy is lagging behind, according to BrandZ.\n\n© All rights reserved"
