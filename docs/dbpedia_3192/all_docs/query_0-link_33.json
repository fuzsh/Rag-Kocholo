        "text": "The tests to assess fuel consumption, CO2 and pollutant emissions are carried out in the laboratory and are based on speciﬁc driving cycles. In this way, the tests are reproducible and the results comparable. This is important because only a laboratory test, which follows a standardized and repeatable procedure, allows consumers to compare different car models. On 1 September 2017, the new Worldwide harmonised Light-duty vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP) came into force in Europe and will gradually replace the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) protocol. NEDC (New European Driving Cycle): it has been the European driving cycle used so far for the measurement of fuel consumption and emissions from passenger cars and light commercial vehicles. The ﬁrst European driving cycle came into force in 1970 and referred to an urban route. In 1992 it was also considered to have an extra-urban phase and since 1997 it has been used for measuring consumption and CO2 emissions. However, the composition of this cycle is no longer consistent with current driving styles and distances travelled on different types of roads. The average speed of the NEDC is only 34 km/h, accelerations are low and the maximum speed is just 120 km/h. WLTP procedure: WLTP uses new Worldwide harmonised Light-duty vehicle Test Cycles (WLTC) to measure fuel consumption, CO2 and pollutant emissions from passenger cars and light commercial vehicles. The new protocol aims to provide customers with more realistic data, better reﬂecting the daily use of the vehicle. The new WLTP procedure is characterized by a more dynamic driving proﬁle with more signiﬁcant acceleration. The maximum speed increases from 120 to 131.3 km/ h, the average speed is 46.5 km/h and the total cycle time is 30 minutes, 10 minutes more than the previous NEDC. The distance travelled doubles from 11 to 23.25 kilometers. The WLTP test consists of four parts depending on the maximum speed: Low (up to 56.5 km/h), Medium (up to 76.6 km/h), High (up to 97.4 km/h), Extra-high (up to 131.3 km/h). These parts of the cycle simulate urban and suburban driving and driving on extra-urban roads and motorways. The procedure also takes into account all vehicle’s optional contents that affect aerodynamics, rolling resistance and vehicle mass, resulting in a CO2 value that reﬂects the characteristics of the single vehicle.\n\nThe WLTP procedure will gradually replace the NEDC procedure. The WLTP applies to new passenger car models from 1 September 2017, to all passenger cars registered from 1 September 2018 and is mandatory for all EU Member States. Until the end of 2020, both fuel consumption and CO2 emission values in WLTP and NEDC will be present in the vehicle documents. Indeed, NEDC values will be used to assess the average CO2 emissions of cars registered in the EU throughout 2020. In addition, some countries may continue to use the NEDC data for ﬁscal purposes. From 2021 onwards, WLTP data will be the only consumption/ CO2 emissions values for all cars. Used vehicles will not be affected by this step and will maintain their certiﬁed NEDC values.\n\nROAD CONSUMPTION AND EMISSIONS OF PASSENGER CARS\n\nThe new WLTP test procedure is more representative of current driving conditions than the NEDC procedure, but it cannot take into account all possible cases including the effect of the driving style that is speciﬁc to each individual driver.\n\nTherefore, there will still be a difference between emissions and consumption measured in the laboratory and those resulting from the use of the vehicle in the real world, and the extent of this difference will depend on factors such as driving behavior, the use of on-board systems (e. g. air conditioning), trafﬁc and weather conditions that are characteristic of each geographical area and each driver. For this reason, only a standardized laboratory test allows to obtain values with which it is possible to compare vehicles and different models in a fair way.\n\nWHAT CHANGES FOR CUSTOMERS\n\nThe new WLTP procedure will provide a more realistic criterion for comparing the fuel consumption and CO2 emission values of different vehicle models as it has been designed to better reﬂect real driving behavior and take into account the speciﬁc technical characteristics of the individual model and version, including optional equipment.\n\nGEAR\n\nThe introduction of the eighth gear has resulted in a reduction in fuel consumption without compromising on performance. The gearbox is based on a dual-clutch oil bath architecture and is derived from the new 8-speed gearbox introduced on the SF90 Stradale. The main modifications made with respect to the latter are longer gear ratios and the introduction of a reverse gear (which is performed through an electric motor in the SF90 Stradale). The new clutch module is 20% smaller but delivers 35% more torque. The transmission software strategy has been evolved thanks to a more powerful ECU and better integration with the engine management software. This has made the shifts quicker, smoother and more consistent.\n\nZERO TURBO LAG\n\nLike all other Ferraris in the range, the Ferrari Roma delivers almost instantaneous throttle response thanks to its flat-plane crankshaft, which is more compact in size with lower rotating masses to improve fluid-dynamics; to compact turbines which thus have a lower moment of inertia; to the twin-scroll technology that increases the pressure of the exhaust pulses for maximum power; and to the single-piece cast exhaust manifold with equal length pipes to optimise pressure waves in the turbine and reduce losses.\n\nVARIABLE BOOST MANAGEMENT\n\nThe Ferrari Roma boasts Variable Boost Management, a control software developed by the company’s engineers that adjusts torque delivery to suit the gear selected, delivering increasingly powerful pick-up as revs rise, whilst optimising fuel consumption. As the car goes up through the gears, the amount of torque delivered by the engine increases all the way up to 760 Nm in 7th and 8th gear. This has allowed Ferrari to use longer gear ratios in the higher gears, which helps keep fuel consumption and emissions down, while adopting a steeper torque curve through the rev range in the lower gears for a feeling of smooth, consistent pick-up.\n\nEXHAUST LINE\n\nBy tradition, every single Ferrari engine has its own particular soundtrack that makes it unique. The Ferrari Roma is no exception that rule. The geometry of the entire exhaust line is new, thanks to the elimination of the two rear silencers, which significantly reduces backpressure in the tailpipes; the new geometry for the by-pass valves, machined to an oval shape which reduces exhaust backpressure and improves sound quality; and the proportional continuous and progressive by-pass valve control, depending on the driving situation.\n\nWEIGHT/POWER RATIO\n\nThe Ferrari Roma has lower mass and a lower centre of gravity with regard to previous Ferrari GT models. Despite the wheelbase being unchanged, it also has a lower moment of inertia. This resulted in the mid-front-engined V8 2+ car with the best weight/power ratio in the segment (2.37 kg/cv), aimed at delivering unprecedented performance for a model of this kind. Specifically, 70% of the components in the car’s bodyshell and chassis are new and this has also increased torsional rigidity. A jump which also boosts comfort by improving bump absorption and lending a feeling of solidity while driving.\n\nON-BOARD CONTROL SYSTEMS\n\nThe Ferrari Roma embraces the Side Slip Control 6.0 concept, which incorporates an algorithm that delivers a precise estimate of sideslip to the on-board control systems. The SSC 6.0 integrates systems such as the E-Diff, F1-Trax, SCM-E Frs and Ferrari Dynamic Enhancer, the latter debuting in the Race position on the Ferrari Roma. The aim of the 5-position manettino is to make the Ferrari Roma’s handling and grip even more accessible by extending the setting ranges thanks to the introduction of the Race position. Consistent with the car’s basic mechanical set-up, this arrangement is focused on boosting fun behind the wheel.\n\nFERRARI DYNAMIC ENHANCER\n\nFerrari Dynamic Enhancer is a lateral dynamic control system which gently adjusts brake pressure on one or more wheels depending on the situation. On the Ferrari Roma it is being used solely in the Race setting of the manettino. The main purpose of the FDE is to maximise fun behind the wheel by making the sideslip dynamics smoother, more predictable and controllable. //FDE is not a stability control system; indeed, it flanks the traditional stability control system (VDC) to make the sideslip dynamics smoother, more predictable and controllable. This supports the whole target of the Race position itself, which is driving pleasure and fun behind the wheel."
