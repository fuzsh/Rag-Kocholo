        "text": "Story and photos by Robin Esrock\n\nA travel writer who once had sports car posters on his childhood bedroom wall heads into the Italian homes of Lamborghini and Ferrari to see where it all happens and drive the sought-after vehicles into the countryside.\n\nIt is known as the Capital of Cars, and the Engine of Italy. Born within a golden circle that surrounds the city of Modena are the mythical brands whispered on the lips of car lovers the world over. Maserati. De Tomaso. Pagani. Italian sports cars introduced the world to speed and luxury, and the ultimate union of art and technology. Perfectly defining this are the region's two most famous sons: Lamborghini and Ferrari. These are the machines that have transcended the circuits and bolts within them, commanding religious-like reverence from both drivers and dreamers.\n\nRacing against the clock on a scorching summer day, I get to strap myself into two dream machines and blast into the Italian countryside.\n\nThe Product of a Disgruntled Fan\n\nThere would be no Lamborghini were it not for Ferrari. Ferruccio Lamborghini was one of the wealthiest men in Italy, having made his fortune selling tractors and appliances. An avid car enthusiast and collector, among Ferruccio's favorites were several Ferraris, although he found them to be mechanically temperamental. Recognizing a recurring clutch issue, Ferruccio contacted Enzo Ferrari, founder and namesake, a man best described as being ferociously driven in the pursuit of automobile racing. How different the vehicle landscape would be if Ferrari had taken customer feedback seriously.\n\nEnzo allowed the manufacture of Ferrari sports cars only as a means to fund his beloved racing initiatives. Private collectors had to put up with Enzo's distaste for their sports cars along with his notoriously dismissive attitude. As a customer, Ferruccio was no different. Enzo told him that a tractor manufacturer had no right to criticize Ferrari, forcing Lamborghini to repair his own models. In doing so, Lamborghini discovered that the mechanics of car and tractors had encouraging similarities. If Ferrari would not improve their road models, Lamborghini had the knowledge and financial clout to do it for them.\n\nIn 1963, Automobili Lamborghini was born. With the help of hired ex-Ferrari engineers, he rolled out his first model—a 350 GTV—built in a factory set up not far from Ferrari's own.\n\nUnlike Ferrari, Lamborghini would focus solely on sports cars, shying away from the racetrack. Today, Lamborghini is a name synonymous with the Italian sports car, a thorn bush on the much bigger Ferrari landscape. Did Enzo rue his decision to insult Ferruccio? Probably not. He was a man so focused on the checkered flag that there was little time for Sunday afternoon drives in the countryside.\n\nJust a few minutes across the municipal border into Bologna, you'll find the headquarters and factory of Lamborghini. The eponymous Bull logo, taken from Ferruccio's Taurus star sign, appears boldly on the walls. A parking lot holds dozens of Audis belonging to staff, since the German manufacturer (and its parent company Volkswagen) owns 100% of the Lamborghini brand now. Since the 1970's, Lamborghini has endured bankruptcy, a humiliating sale to Chrysler, ownership by an Indonesian consortium headed by the son of the dictator Suharto, and sporadic years of economic uncertainty. Yet it has continued to produce vehicles that have redefined design and car envy: vehicles like the Aventador, the Hura&cacute;an, Murciélago, the Diablo, and its iconic predecessor, the Countach.\n\nInto the Land of Car Dreams\n\nAs a teenage boy, I had a mounted poster of a blue Countach in my bedroom, a rocket ship on earth, my ultimate dream car. It was named after an Italian wolf whistle, for that is what it in inspired. Subsequent generations of the Countach, along with one-of-a-kind prototypes and concept cars, are on display in an on-site gallery at the factory, open daily to the public. The Concept S has adjacent seat booths protected by individual windows, creating the distinct look of a jet fighter. The LM002 looks much like a Hummer, an SUV built in the mid-1980's, way before its time. A green Countach sits so low on the ground it barely reaches my thigh.\n\nOn show is also a Lamborghini police car, one of two donated to the Italian police department, to be used for emergency organ transplants and blood deliveries. It is the car you want to be arrested in.\n\nBehind the gallery is the factory itself, where every Lamborghini created is carefully hand-assembled. There are no giant robots drilling sparks into the air. There is no loud industrial noise, or even a spot of grease on the floor. Every 190 minutes, the cars move forward on a U-shaped production line to the next work station, where a team of white-gloved engineers set to work installing the electronics, the interior, the wheels and dashboard. The workers appear completely enthused by their job, paying attention to the finest detail, scribbling their efforts into a production book that will follow the vehicle for the remainder of its life.\n\nLamborghini does not keep stock. Each model is made to order, customized according to the exact specification of the buyer. Only two or three vehicles roll off the line each day and the waiting list is long. While the museum and tours are open to the public, certain areas are off-limits for photography.\n\nFrom station to station, the Aventador matures, until at the halfway point, a marriage takes place. The engine, already assembled, is hoisted up and inserted into the chassis. According to my guide, this is the perfect metaphor for the soul entering the body. At the final station, the electronics are tested, the lights flicker on, and spark plugs get their first ignition. The birth roar of an engine is primal, like a dragon breathing fire, a lion owning the savannah. Some 190 minutes later, another customized model will roar its approval.\n\nIt takes the finest leather of five Austrian cows to furnish the interior of Lamborghini, dyed in lush colors and stitched by hand. One upholsterer has large photos of his kids above his work desk. My guide says, âthis is love, no?â and I am not sure if she's talking about the kids, or the car. Valetino Balboni, a veteran test driver hired by Ferruccio Lamborghini himself, pulls up in a silver Gallardo LP 560-4 Spyder. He's been driving these cars longer than I have been alive, and he's taking me into the countryside to demonstrate what all that marvelous production amounts to.\n\nA Lambo on the Road\n\nA car journalist might tell you that a Gallardo Spyder has a new 5.2-liter V10 engine with an output of 560 horsepower, a power to weight ratio of 2.77kg, an 18% reduction in fuel consumption and C02 emissions from previous models, and a top speed of 324 km/hr. All I'll say is that stepping into the Spyder for the first time made my knees tremble and my throat dry. There is not a head on this planet that would not swivel the second it sees this elegant creation. Valentino presses a button, the Spyder growls to life, and we effortlessly pull into the road. At the first intersection, I receive eight nods of envy, three photographs, and I'm not even driving yet.\n\nWe are but two men comfortably seated on expensive red leather with a powerful state of the art engine strapped to our backs. Valentino shoots ahead, demonstrating the incredible power (0 to 100 km/hr. in 3.9 seconds) and stop-on-a-penny all wheel drive braking. As we are taking sharp corners that could flip most cars, it is not unlike being in a rollercoaster, the dream machine catapulting forward but leaving my eyeballs trailing.\n\nWe find a quiet stretch and Valentino invites me to take the wheel. With an advanced paddle shift transmission and various driving modes, he reassures me that I cannot make a mistake, as the car will automatically adjust itself as it needs. Sweat is dripping from my forehead, and this low to the tarmac, heat is radiating from the ground. The temperature in the cockpit reads an incredible 122F under a relentless summer sun.\n\nI hesitantly pull forward, piloting a vehicle worth more than I could ever afford, well aware that I had signed a waiver holding me responsible for any mishaps. Valentino was right. The Spyder is beautifully forgiving, guiding my paddle presses, injecting fuel when needed, shifting solidly around corners. It doesn't take long before I have the confidence to induce G-force and make this silver bullet fly. I drive back to the factory, pull up in front of a group of jealous tourists, and would have made a proud and gallant exit had my knees not buckled under the pure bliss of the experience.\n\nA Pilgrimage to Ferrari HQ\n\nIt is a short drive from Bologna to Maranello, where Enzo Ferrari relocated his factory after his original workshops in Modena were bombed during World War II. Maranello is a mecca for racing and car enthusiasts, and is not so much a small town as a Ferrari theme park. There are Ferrari stores and Ferrari schools, Ferrari-themed restaurants and red-painted hotels. Images of Ferrari's famous prancing horse—adopted as a logo by Enzo in 1923 from a famed Italian fighter pilot—are everywhere. While Lamborghini and Ferrari are both Italian sports cars, it is immediately clear that Ferrari is a much larger enterprise, a fast, bright red world unto itself.\n\nEnzo, who died in 1988, did not live to see seven-time World Champion Michael Schumacher dominate Formula 1 at the wheel of a Ferrari, but this was always his dream. Enzo felt he was born to race, but when he realized his own skill was not up to par with the best, he changed his destiny so that other drivers could fulfill theirs. Originally working for Alfa Romeo, Enzo left the company to start his own stable of race cars called Scuderia Ferrari, literally, Stable Ferrari.\n\nFerrari's impact on the world of motor racing was immediate, if somewhat turbulent. Winning some titles but plagued by mechanical issues, the firm appeared to have more success off the track, as Ferrari road cars became sought-after toys of international wealthy car enthusiasts. Enzo continued to view this consumer market as an afterthought. Plugging millions into racing development, financial woes in the 1960s forced him to sell a large stake in the company to Fiat, which spun the brand off into a separate public company in 2015 (Enzo's son still owns 10% of the company). Enzo's tenacity, not to mention the raw power, stylish design, and racing mentality of his cars, ensured not only the survival but also Ferrari's growth into perhaps the world's most desired and recognizable sports car brand. Ferraris are the vehicle of success, on and off the road.\n\nAt the Ferrari Maranello Museum, many of the most famous Ferraris are on display for an adoring public. From the original cars built by Enzo to the F1 triumphs of Michael Schumacher, a recreation of a Grand Prix pit stop inside the museum continues to emphasize the importance of the racetrack to the company. A computer simulator even allows visitors to race on a circuit. It takes some time for me to realize that the cars in front of me are the same ones that have dominated sport headlines around the world, having won 31 Formula 1 World Titles.\n\nUpstairs are the sports cars, the famous Testa Rossa, the F40, the Enzo Ferrari, named in tribute, and the only road-licensed Formula 1 vehicle. A red 308GTS represents my first experience of a Ferrari. It is the car driven by Tom Selleck in the hit 1980s series Magnum P.I. There is a marked difference here from the sleekness and almost minimalistic lines I found inside Lamborghini's showcase. Ferraris exude brute strength, more muscle than finesse. A special showcase houses a black 1957 250 Testa Rossa, an antique car that was one of the most expensive vehicles ever sold at an auction. In 2009, it sold for a staggering US$12.1 million—and it doesn't even have headlights.\n\nJust about every car in the Galleria Ferrari is bright red, a color forever associated with Ferrari, even though all Italian F1 cars have been painted red since a racing organization assigned it to the country in the 1920's. French teams are blue, German white (later silver), the British green. Ferrari came to own the color because it came to own the idea of Italian race cars. Ironically, the 430 Scuderia waiting for me outside the museum is light metallic blue, with two silver racing stripes down the middle.\n\nRiding in a Ferrari in Italy\n\nThis particular model was built to complete with the Lamborghini Gallardo Superleggera, offering a lighter body, more power, and faster speed. Boasting 508 horsepower at 8500 rpm, power to rate ratio of 2.5kk/hp, an F1-trac system and E-Diff stability control, and I'm not really sure what all that means other than this is a purebred racing machine built for speed. It moves from a dead stop to 100 km/hr. in 3.5 seconds, and with a top speed of 320 km/hr., you're always the pace car on the smooth Italian autostrade.\n\nThe test driver's name is Gabriel, and we both agree that a job requiring you to drive in a Ferrari all day is a job worth keeping. Of all the Ferraris he has driven at the company, this is his favorite because this model, he tells me, was built for racing, period. The interior is somewhat basic, the seats practical, the seat belts tellingly over the shoulder like the jump seat in an airplane. A metal footplate lets me support myself as Gabriel screams around the bend of a quiet country road, the engine snarling as he shifts the transmission with the paddles. It feels like we are tigers lurking in the concrete jungle of automobiles, ferociously hunting prey. After screeching past a tight curve (and after I stop screaming), I ask Gabriel how fast he was going. With a wry grin, he tells me he doesn't know. You'd have to have a Lamborghini police car to catch us anyway.\n\nIt is late afternoon when we drive back to the Galleria, and in the traffic of rush hour, it seems almost cruel for the 430 Scuderia to trot at 40 km/hr. back to the stable. A race car without a race is a tied-up thoroughbred with nowhere to go. I thank my pilot Gabriel, awkwardly exit the cockpit, and walk over to my rented blue Peugeot 107. Like most cars in Italy, it is a tiny vehicle capable of squeezing through narrow cobblestone streets, slotting into miniscule parking spaces, but still able to exceed the 130 km/hr. speed limit on the highway. It is half the size of a Ferrari or Lamborghini, but it got me to both factories safely, with room for my suitcase and a couple friends.\n\nComparing it in the same breath as these mighty Italian giants seems almost sacrilegious, and yet one might argue that they are all machines of transport, on four rubber wheels, powered by an engine. The Italian sports cars just cost a heck of a lot more, and for day-to-day use, are entirely impractical. Dream machines were not designed to carry groceries or pick up the kids. Lamborghini and Ferrari are golden chariots that shepherd our quest for power, speed, and beauty, the desire to transcend practicality in the name of art and technology. Placing a price tag on such an endeavor misses the point. For the vast majority of us who can appreciate if not afford the result, there's always a visit to the Engine of Italy.\n\nIF YOU GO:\n\nDaily Lamborghini Factory Tours are arranged through the Lamborghini Museum.\n\nClick here for more information about visiting the Ferrari Museum in Maranello or Modena.\n\nHaving reported from over 100 countries on 7 continents, Vancouver-based Robin Esrock is the bestselling author of The Great Global Bucket List, The Great Australian Bucket List and The Great Canadian Bucket List.
