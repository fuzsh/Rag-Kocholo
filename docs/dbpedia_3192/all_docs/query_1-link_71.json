        "text": "The two men, as well as their namesake automobile brand, are both from Italy. Nonetheless, the rivalry (almost hostility) between Lamborghini and Ferrari is legendary, even as urban mythology. Clearly, the rampaging bull and the prancing horse have a tumultuous history together. However, one brand, or rather the man behind the brand, spurred the other to achieve greater heights. As a result of the rivalry between Ferrari and Lamborghini, consumers now have a wider selection of sports vehicles to choose from. Both vehicle brands are Italian, formed out of the hard efforts of men who pursued their dreams with amazing tenacity. They could have been pals if the times had been different. Enzo Ferrari and Ferruccio Lamborghini, on the other hand, knew how to build a great car. Here are some of the most interesting facts we could find about the Lamborghini and Ferrari feud !\n\nEnzo Ferrari Was Born To Race\n\nBorn in Modena, Italy, in 1898, Enzo Ferrari had a lifelong passion for racing, particularly fundamental motor racing, even though it was still in its infancy at the time. Ferrari began driving for Alfa Romeo in 1919 after being recognized as a serious racer, and in 1924, he formed Scuderia Ferrari, Alfa Romeo's official racing section. Later, it was renamed Alfa Corse, and Ferrari led it until he decided to start his own company. By 1939, Enzo Ferrari had left Alfa Romeo and established Auto Avio Costruzioni, his own company.\n\nFerruccio Lamborghini Started With Grapes\n\nAlthough Lamborghini didn’t literally start his career with grapes, he was born in Renazzo, Italy, to a family of grape farmers in 1916. He began a family business producing tractors in 1948, owing to his interest in mechanics, and he soon became quite wealthy. He had enough money to splurge on a variety of racing cars, including some of Ferrari's finest. However, the mechanic in him considered the automobiles to be a touch wanting, and here is where Lamborghini and Ferrari got their start.\n\nBefore the Rivalry Surfaced, Enzo Was Already Making Fine Cars\n\nEnzo Lamborghini was already manufacturing renowned cars when he started making tractors. The 815 was Enzo Ferrari's first automobile, and it competed in the 1940 Mille Miglia. If WWII hadn't intervened, success would have arrived sooner. Ferrari constructed his first production car, the 125 S, after relocating his headquarters to Maranello. In 1947, it won the Grand Prix of Rome. Meanwhile, Scuderia Ferrari won the Mille Miglia in 1948 and the 24 Hours of Le Mans for the first time in 1949.\n\nLamborghini Used To Buy Ferraris\n\nLamborghini liked to flaunt his wealth, which he had amassed through his thriving tractor business. As a result, he purchased two Ferraris for himself and his wife, one white and one black. And when he drove out clients to his factory or to eat, he'd do so in his “Rary”. Only, according to one story, he wasn't a very good driver and was constantly burning the clutch. Lamborghini opted to replace the clutch himself, at his tractor factory, after numerous attempts at Ferrari's factory.\n\nThat 10-Lire Part That Started It All\n\nWhen the chief mechanic at Lamborghini disassembled the clutch, he discovered that it was similar to one that came standard with one of the smaller Lamborghini tractors, and the goose was truly cooked. Technically, it was a commercial clutch, and it was even available for Maseratis. Lamborghini, on the other hand, despised the idea that he had paid 10 lire for that part for his tractor, but had to pay 1,000 lire for a replacement in his Ferrari!\n\nLamborghini Actually Told Off Ferrari\n\nForget about the age gap and the fact that Ferruccio Lamborghini had never built a car before. When he met Enzo Ferrari, allegedly because they must have socialized in the same circles, he told him that his sports cars were built from Lamborghini tractor parts, and even complained about the poor build quality. And that was the end of it. Ferrari came close to exploding when he told Lamborghini that he should stick to building tractors. Lamborghini was equally enraged, so they decided to build vehicles instead and teach Ferrari a thing or two, kicking off the legendary rivalry!\n\nMeanwhile, Ferrari Went on Getting Better\n\nWith Alberto Ascari at the wheel, Ferrari won its first Formula One World Championship in 1952. Later, in 1956, Ferrari suffered a personal tragedy when his son, Dino, died of muscular dystrophy. However, in terms of racing, the victories continued. Ferrari began to feel the strain in 1961 and initiated talks with Ford about selling the company. Ferrari backed out at the last minute, igniting the historic rivalry between Ford and Ferrari. Enzo sold half of his interests to Fiat in 1969 and resigned as President in 1977.\n\nLamborghini Was a Man of His Word\n\nIt wasn't an empty promise when Ferruccio Lamborghini decided to build a car that could compete with Ferrari. Automobili Lamborghini was created in 1963, and a gleaming new facility in Sant'Agata Bolognese was erected. Lamborghini spared no expense, even enlisting Giotto Bizzarrini, who had previously worked on Ferrari engines. Bizzarrini designed the first Lamborghini, the Lamborghini 350 GTV, which debuted at the Turin Motor Show.\n\nFerrari’s Greatest Are Nearly Works of Art\n\nFerrari's mid-engine cars, such as the 308 GTB and GT4s, made their debut in the 1979s. More models followed in the 1980s, including the 288 GTO, Testarossa, and F40, despite the fact that Fiat owned 90% of the firm at the time. Enzo Ferrari passed away in 1988, yet his name lives on through his automobiles. The Maranellos and Modenas followed, and by the 2000s, Ferrari had resumed its winning streak in motorsports. The Stradale, Roma, and Spider, as well as other Lamborghini models, continue to carry the illustrious Ferrari moniker.\n\nLamborghini’s Legacy Is No Less Venerated\n\nThe 350 GTV was a success for Lamborghini, and bigger and better cars followed, including the Islero, Espada, and Countach. Lamborghini had proven a point and left the firm by 1972, and the company had gone bankrupt by 1980. The firm was relaunched the next year, and the LM002 kept it viable, but Chrysler eventually acquired it. The Diablo debuted in 1990, but by 1994, Chrysler had sold it off, and by 1998, it had been sold to Audi."
