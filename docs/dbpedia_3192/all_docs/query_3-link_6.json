        "text": "We’ve hunted down the best Italian clothing brands so you can inject some of that European flair into your wardrobe.\n\nThe best Italian clothing brands offer unmatched elegance and style. Playful with tailoring and bold on color, Italy is home to some of the most important names in fashion and the recent Milan Fashion Week 2023 showcased Italian talent including Prada, Gucci and Fendi who all hail from the country. While we love British clothing brands for quirky statement pieces and admire the chicness of the best French clothing brands, no one does it quite like the Italians.\n\nWhether you're after designer heels, or the best designer bags, Italian-crafted leather goods are some of the highest quality in the world. In fact, the level of detail and workmanship in Italian clothing brands and accessories means that many big British, French, and American clothing brands also rely on Italian craftsmanship and textiles to produce parts of their collections. But it’s not just designer brands that Italy has under its incredibly stylish belt. There are heaps of Italian straight-to-market fashion brands that deserve a look-in too.\n\nThe best Italian clothing brands - chosen by our fashion editors\n\nWhether you want to broaden your knowledge on the best Italian straight-to-market fashion retailers or splurge on a designer investment piece, these are the best Italian clothing brands to shop right now.\n\n1. Calzedonia\n\nView all Calzedonia clothing from $5 / £2.50\n\nYou may already be familiar with Calzedonia as there are several stores in the US and UK. A go-to for the warmest leggings and top-quality tights, it is also one of the best Italian lingerie brands, mixing fashion-forward thinking which some much-needed comfort. These wardrobe essentials are guaranteed to last too, think cashmere tights for that luxe finish and leather-effect leggings for a dose of Italian glamour - ideal for what to wear in Rome. Not forgetting the brand's desirable swimwear collections that house some of the best beach cover-ups, with easy-to-wear silhouettes and mood-boosting, dopamine-dressing-inspired inspired prints for a beach-ready look.\n\nFashion editor's picks…\n\n2. Diesel\n\nView all Diesel clothing from $40 / £20\n\nAn Italian clothing brand with denim at its core is Diesel. Having launched in 1978, Diesel really hit its peak in the '90s when it seemed every cool girl was donning a pair of distressed Diesel jeans. With '90s nostalgia one of the biggest spring/summer fashion trends 2023 has to offer, Diesel's denim collection is right on the money right now, and still makes for a very worthy investment. With a genuine vintage spin at the heart of the brand's design aesthetic, its best jeans now benefit from a more sustainable manufacturing process that uses less water and chemicals - always a plus. Highlights from Diesel include padded bomber jackets, vinyl skirts and logo-embellished knits all with a cool '90s edge.\n\nFashion editor's picks…\n\n3. Fendi\n\nView all Fendi clothing from $240 / £170\n\nWe're spoilt for choice when it comes to Italian designer brands and Fendi is a luxury fashion house that remains top of its game. From the iconic baguette bag to the recognizable double-F logo - adorning everything from jackets to the best designer belts - Fendi is synonymous with glamorous Italian fashion. Founded by the Fendi family in 1925, the brand launched its first ready-to-wear collection in the 1970s under the creative direction of the late Karl Lagerfeld. One of the longest-standing family-led fashion brands, granddaughter Silvia Venturini Fendi - who designed the coveted baguette bag - remains the sole family member still working for the brand. Expect sleek, tailored pieces in a neutral color palette.\n\nFashion editor's picks…\n\n4. Gucci\n\nView all Gucci clothing from $520 / £225\n\nWe couldn’t do an Italian clothing brands round-up without mentioning the powerhouse that is Gucci. From the best Gucci bags and best designer sunglasses to its eclectic suiting adored by the likes of Harry Styles, Gucci is one of the most coveted designer brands out there. Although they carry the designer price tag, these are investment pieces that are set to last. Look to its signature geek-chic designs and logo-heavy detailing, because if you’re wearing Gucci, you want everyone to know about it.\n\nFashion editor's picks…\n\n5. La DoubleJ\n\nView all La DoubleJ clothing from $90 / £80\n\nA relatively newbie on the fashion block, La DoubleJ launched in 2015 predominately selling vintage clothing and jewelry. The brand now repurposes archival prints into new pieces covering clothing and homeware. With bold design choices, there is nothing lowkey about this collection. The opposite of the minimalism of Scandinavian clothing brands, think vivid colors, bold prints and voluminous silhouettes, La DoubleJ has some of the best midi dresses too. It’s maximalist and statement-making and perfect for commanding an entrance.\n\nFashion editor's picks…\n\n6. Marina Rinaldi\n\nView all Marina Rinaldi clothing from $95 / £75\n\nA luxury label that caters for curvy women, Marina Rinaldi’s goal is to make “the elegant fashion dreams of all women come true, for all sizes”. One of the best plus size clothing brands, the Italian clothing brand doesn’t shy away from bold colors and attention-grabbing prints which is a welcome change in plus-size fashion. High quality fabrics with lots of added detail, the collection is expertly tailored to flatter your figure and make you feel incredibly glamorous, minimal effort required! Its accessories work seamlessly with the clothing line too.\n\nFashion editor's picks…\n\n7. Miss Sixty\n\nView all Miss Sixty clothing from $9 / £7.90\n\nMiss Sixty provided us with many low-slung jeans back in the early noughties and we’re pleased to see the Italian clothing brand is still going strong. It was brought back into the spotlight a couple of years ago when model Bella Hadid fronted a campaign for the brand - and with the recent resurgence in Y2K styles and '90s fashion trends, it’s certainly one to put back on your radar. Denim still plays a key role in the collection but you can also bag yourself some floaty dresses and staple outerwear. The only downside of Miss Sixty is the smaller size range, making it not a great experience for fuller figures.\n\nFashion editor's picks…\n\n8. Prada\n\nView all Prada clothing from $525 / £470\n\nPrada has got to be one of the most iconic Italian fashion brands. From some of the most well-recognized designer bags and best designer heels, to its sleek ready-to-wear collection, Prada oozes ladylike elegance that’s guaranteed to elevate the everyday. Created in 1913, the original founder’s granddaughter Miuccia Prada heads up the luxury fashion house alongside Raf Simons, taking it to new heights. One to create trends rather than follow them, Prada is renowned for crafting future classics that define a fashion era.\n\nFashion editor's picks…\n\n9. Dolce Gabbana\n\nView all Dolce & Gabbana from $70 / £50\n\nWhen it comes to Italian clothing brands, Dolce & Gabbana is one of the first that comes to mind. Championing a design aesthetic that puts glamour, celebration and color front and center, the brand's collections are often reminiscent of the Italian Riviera, offering a nostalgic element to its thoroughly modern collections. With a penchant for highlighting and flattering the female form, hourglass silhouettes are key to the brand's design signature. While Dolce & Gabbana create statement styles, print collections and edits each season, its pieces won't go out of style."
