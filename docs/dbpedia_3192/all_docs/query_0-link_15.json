        "text": "Ferrari is an Italian luxury sports car manufacturer based in Maranello, Italy. It was founded by Enzo Ferrari in 1947, with the aim of producing high-performance race cars. Ferrari has since become one of the world's most iconic and recognizable brands, synonymous with luxury, performance, and speed.\n\nFerrari's vehicles are designed and built with a focus on performance and racing heritage. They are known for their sleek, aerodynamic designs and powerful engines, which are capable of reaching high speeds in a matter of seconds. Ferrari's cars are often used in competitive racing events such as Formula One, where the brand has achieved considerable success.\n\nFerrari produces a range of vehicles, including sports cars, GT cars, and limited-edition supercars. Its most popular models include the 488 GTB, 812 Superfast, Portofino, and Roma. Each vehicle is hand-built and customized to meet the individual needs of its owner, with a focus on delivering an exceptional driving experience.\n\nIn addition to its vehicle manufacturing, Ferrari has also expanded into other areas of luxury goods, such as clothing, accessories, and branded merchandise. The company has also launched a series of amusement parks known as Ferrari World, located in various parts of the world.\n\nFerrari is known for its commitment to innovation and sustainability. The company has launched several initiatives aimed at reducing its environmental impact, including the development of hybrid and electric vehicles. It is also committed to promoting diversity and inclusion within its workforce, with a focus on gender equality and promoting a culture of inclusivity.\n\nFerrari's success and reputation have earned it a devoted following of enthusiasts and collectors around the world. Its cars are sought after for their unique blend of performance, luxury, and exclusivity, making Ferrari one of the world's most coveted automotive brands.\n\nEnzo Ferrari was not initially interested in the idea of producing road cars when he formed Scuderia Ferrari in 1929, with headquarters in Modena. Scuderia Ferrari literally means \"Ferrari Stable\" and is usually used to mean \"Team Ferrari.\" Ferrari bought, prepared, and fielded Alfa Romeo racing cars for gentleman drivers, functioning as the racing division of Alfa Romeo.\n\nIn 1933, Alfa Romeo withdrew its in-house racing team and Scuderia Ferrari took over as its works team: the Scuderia received Alfa's Grand Prix cars of the latest specifications and fielded many famous drivers such as Tazio Nuvolari and Achille Varzi. In 1938, Alfa Romeo again brought its racing operation in-house, forming Alfa Corse in Milan and hiring Enzo Ferrari as manager of the new racing department; thereby disbanding the Scuderia Ferrari.\n\nIn September 1939, Ferrari left Alfa Romeo under the provision he would not use the Ferrari name in association with races or racing cars for at least four years. A few days later he founded Auto Avio Costruzioni, with headquarters in the facilities of the old Scuderia Ferrari. The new company ostensibly produced machine tools and aircraft accessories. In 1940, Ferrari produced a racing car â€“ the Tipo 815, based on a Fiat platform. It was the first Ferrari car and debuted at the 1940 Mille Miglia, but due to World War II, it saw little competition. In 1943, the Ferrari factory moved to Maranello, where it has remained ever since. The Allies bombed the factory and subsequently rebuilt it, including works for road car production.\n\nThe first Ferrari-badged car was the 1947 125 S, powered by a 1.5 L V12 engine; Enzo Ferrari reluctantly built and sold his automobiles to fund Scuderia Ferrari. The Scuderia Ferrari name was resurrected to denote the factory racing cars and distinguish them from those fielded by customer teams.\n\nIn 1960, the company was restructured as a public corporation under the name SEFAC S.p. A. Early in 1969, Fiat took a 50% stake in Ferrari. An immediate result was an increase in available investment funds, and work started at once on a factory extension intended to transfer production from Fiat's Turin plant of the Ferrari-engined Fiat Dino. The new model investment further up in the Ferrari range also received a boost.\n\nIn 1988, Enzo Ferrari oversaw the launch of the Ferrari F40, the last new Ferrari launched before his death later that year. In 1989, the company was renamed Ferrari S.p.A. From 2002 to 2004, Ferrari produced the Enzo, their fastest model at the time, which was introduced and named in honour of the company's founder, Enzo Ferrari. It was to be called the F60, continuing on from the F40 and F50, but Ferrari was so pleased with it, they called it the Enzo instead. It was initially offered to loyal and recurring customers, and each of the 399 made had a price tag of $650,000.\n\nOn 15 September 2012, 964 Ferrari cars worth over $162 million attended the Ferrari Driving Days event at Silverstone Circuit and paraded around the Silverstone Circuit setting a world record. Ferrari's former CEO and Chairman, Luca di Montezemolo, resigned from the company after 23 years and was succeeded by Amedeo Felisa finally on 3 May 2016 Amedeo resigned and was succeeded by Sergio Marchionne, CEO and Chairman of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, Ferrari parent company. In July 2018, Marchionne was replaced by board member Louis Camilleri as CEO and by John Elkann as chairman.\n\nOn 29 October 2014, the FCA group, resulting from the merger between manufacturers Fiat and Chrysler, announced the split of its luxury brand, Ferrari. The aim was to turn Ferrari into an independent brand, 10% of whose stake would be sold in an IPO in 2015. Ferrari officially priced its initial public offering at $52 a share after the market close on 20 October 2015. On 10 December 2020, CEO Louis Camilleri announced that he will step down as CEO and chairman John Elkann will step into the Interim CEO role until a permanent successor is selected. On 9 June 2021, the company announced the appointment of Benedetto Vigna from Geneva-based STMicroelectronics as its next CEO starting in September."
