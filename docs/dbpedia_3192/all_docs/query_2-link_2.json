He remarked that as far as he remembered, that was the first time that was to happen. Then he remarked that it came as no surprise, as he couldnt think of any better symbol for Italian industry and manufacture than Ferrari. \n\nDi Montezemolo declared China as an \"emergent market\" f...",

        "text": "Originally posted by Paul Parker\n\nAs for Ferrari road cars, they have I understand improved exponentially over the years, but then they needed to as the 1960-1970s ones I had experience of were CRAP durability and reliability wise, not to mention low geared steering, inadequate brakes, bodywork contours finished off with baked porridge and the necessity to have 3 feet arms and 2 feet (no pun intended) legs.\n\nEven now I think you would have to think very seriously about the quality thing and as for Fiat/Alfa Romeo, if friend's experience of reliability and resale are anything to go by, best walk on by.\n\nOriginally posted by Only Massa\n\nActually (I'm Italian and I work in the international branding field), Ferrari is the flagship Italian brand in the world.\n\nItalian industry lives in a paradox: on one hand Italy is renowned for its great and unique production (fashion products, macro and micro metallurgy, boats, luxury cars, house-building [italian carpenters are known in the world for their skills in working marble, ceramics and tiles and often great international hotels are built and decorated by italian workforce], luxury household objects).\n\nOn the other hand, Italian low-cost production is suffering the competition of China and other eastern countries.\n\nBut Ferrari is clearly a great Italian (and universal brand), since it combines:\n\n- history and tradition: Ferrari is an old brand, whose image is unchanged since it was born\n\n- design: Ferrari road cars display their usual italian design (Italy has a tradition of great car designers: Pininfarina, Giugiaro, Bertone, Coggiola, etc.)\n\n- winning and racing image: see Michael Schumacher\n\n- luxury without ostentation\n\n- innovation\n\n- exclusivity: they make only a limited number of cars, usually hand-built and they do not have any low-cost or non-traditional models (like Porsche)\n\n- brand image: Ferrari uses a limited amount of well-known unique colors (ferrari-red, modena-yellow, etc), design elements, etc.\n\n- passion: Ferrari is a relatively small company of car-lovers that makes few cars for few car-lovers. It's not an anonymous super industrial group (even if it belongs to one of them) and it deals with its customers with a face-to-face policy. Customer care is a priority for the read marque.\n\nCombine this with the fact that there is almost no competition for Ferrari in its own market (barely Aston Martin, but other brands such as Lamborghini and Porsche do not have the \"image-coolness\"of the red marque) and you'll get the point.\n\nOriginally posted by Melbourne Park\n\nI am in the machinery business, and Italian machinery is very good. It is more adventurous and lower cost than German machinery, which is better engineered and more conservative. Some Italian companies dominate certain segments of my machine market with a combination of excellance and innovation. Others which make the same thing can be quite inferior. These machines all start at US$200k and go upwards from there. There's quite a bit of variance in Italian machinery, but it has a great reputation in Australia/NZ for value if you buy the right one. Ferrari's supremacy over these last years will do a huge future economic benefit to Italian manufacturing.\n\nDon't know though whether them doing badly in the future will have an inverse negative effect. A while ago I think Bira suggested that Ferrari could pull out of F1 while they are on top. Sounded heracy, but if there is a negative effect on Italian industry should Ferrari go badly for consequtive years, then for Italy Ferrari quiting F1 while on top would be a good thing for Italy. Should the cost of success be so great? Who knows ...\n\nIt's funny, here in NZ something that happens to be made outside of Asia is assumed to be better quality. For example, oil heaters for sale over last winter in this country proudly stating 'Made in Italy'. Some English people who have emigrated to NZ laugh and laugh when they saw that 'Made in Italy' advertisement - according to them, customers in the UK would rather walk over broken glass than purchase something made in Italy which is always assumed to be of dubious quality."
