        "text": "To bring the luxury experience to customers around the world, Ferrari developed the car configurator on AWS, giving its customers the ability to personalize their own Ferrari, from wheel selection to paint colors to interior options. “There are millions of possible configurations,” says Simone Canditone, digital experience manager at Ferrari. “We want to help our dealers and customers effectively customize their vehicle to suit their needs.”\n\nTo do so, Ferrari uses large language models (LLMs) in Amazon Bedrock, a fully managed service that offers a choice of high-performing foundation models, along with Amazon Personalize to elevate the customer experience with personalization powered by machine learning (ML). Since rolling out the car configurator, Ferrari has increased its sales leads and reduced configuration times by 20 percent by offering a more personalized experience where customers can visualize a vehicle with 3D imagery that can be rotated and zoomed in and out. It also allows a customer to virtually experiment with different options.\n\nFerrari also enhances the after-sales experience with a generative AI chatbot. To assist its sales professionals and technicians, the company fine-tuned LLMs in Amazon Bedrock—including Amazon Titan, Claude 3, and Llama—on its documentation. “Amazon Bedrock has simplified our approach,” says Mauro Coletto, head of business analytics and AI at Ferrari. “We can connect to a single layer of APIs to quickly test, benchmark, and deploy different models.”\n\nFerrari combines its use of Amazon Bedrock with Amazon SageMaker JumpStart, an ML hub with foundation models, built-in algorithms, and prebuilt ML solutions that can be deployed with only a few clicks. Using these services, Ferrari has trained its chatbot to classify and summarize customer care tickets and answer commonly asked questions that help to reduce human error while improving productivity.\n\nFerrari uses AI and ML to optimize the production of its vehicles as well. For example, Ferrari uses Amazon Lookout for Vision to spot product defects using computer vision to automate quality inspections. Using AI, the company can detect missing or defective parts in the assembly line before a vehicle goes to testing, helping it save on costs.\n\nThe company has improved the vehicle design with generative AI across F1 vehicles and sports cars by being able to test more designs. Using generative AI, Ferrari can reduce its time to market while relying less on physical prototyping. “We can run analytics and simulations and make correlations that were not possible in the past,” says Gabrielli. “It really speeds up and improves our product development.” Creating full car body physical prototypes is time and resource intensive, and by running virtual simulations on the cloud, Ferrari can run thousands or even millions of simulations in parallel at a very low cost. Additionally, Ferrari is training generative AI text-to-image capabilities that facilitate text-based prompts to make vehicle render improvements and design changes quickly."
