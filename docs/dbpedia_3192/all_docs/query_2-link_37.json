        "text": "Although further expansion for a company is for its own benefit, there are both advantages and disadvantages that arise when a company goes public. Raising capital is the most distinct advantage that can be used either for research and development, for increasing public awareness or paying existing depts. IPO’s often generate publicity of the company’s product for potential buyers or investors. Not all companies choose the path of an IPO. In fact, in any country only a small fraction of firms end up doing an IPO. For example, in the UK, of the 2.67m firms registered for VAT and/or PAYE in March 2018, only around 2,200 or so are listed on the London Stock Exchange (LSE). (Kurshef, 2019) More importantly, especially for smaller companies, is that the cost of complying with regulatory requirements can be very high. Some of the additional costs include the generation of financial reporting documents, audit fees, investor relation departments, and accounting oversight committees. Additionally strict transparency rules have to apply on the company’s management, on the board of directors and director’s remuneration. Everything becomes part of public opinion.\n\nWhat may have motivated Ferrari (Ticker symbol “RACE”) to go public? As per Ferrari’s IPO prospectus, Ferrari announced that is selling 17,175,000 common shares of $52 per share, which is almost 1billion (893,100,000), approximately 9% of the Ferrari share capital (so Ferrari is being valued about 10billion). The offering is intended to be part of a series of transactions to separate Ferrari from Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA). Usually the companies are motivated to go public to pay an existing dept. Ferrari is profitable and a very unique product, one of the most recognizable brand names around the world. The company is targeting to sell more cars in a higher price. Ferrari sold 7,255 cars in 2014 and in 2015 it was targeting to sell more than 10,000 vehicles. Production growth at a higher price, can be a good reason to go public. Additionally, as mentioned at the IPO prospectus 80% interest will be transferred to FCA shareholders. Fiat and Chrysler raised new funds. FCA will use the proceeds from the listing to reduce borrowing costs and help fund on-going product development plans for its multitude of brands, including Alfa Romeo, Maserati, Fiat, Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep and Ram. As per the annual report the debt on 2015 was 2,260€ million and on 2016 went down to 1,848€ million.\n\nWhy Ferrari chose to list on New York Stock Exchange? The Italian-American car maker chose New Work – Wall Street to be listed. New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is the world’s largest stock exchange and most probably Ferrari wanted to target first the largest market. Three months later Ferrari debuted on the Milan stock exchange market.\n\nIn an IPO a business will typically sell two types of shares: primary and secondary. Technically there is no difference between these two types of shares. The sale of existing shares, secondary shares, owned by the owners of the business. In Ferrari IPO the shares to be sold are from existing shareholders, so all of them are considered secondary.\n\nAn IPO over-allotment (Greenshoe) option, is a special agreement in a share offering, such as an IPO, which enables the investment bank representing the underwriters to support the share price after the offering without putting their own capital at risk. The use of greenshoe options in share offerings has two advantages. It is a legal mechanism for an underwriter to stabilize the price of new shares, which reduces the risk of their trading below the offer price in the immediate aftermath of an offer. Secondly, it grants the underwriters some flexibility in setting the final size of the offer based on post-offer demand for the shares. On Ferrari’s IPO prospectus, the initial public offering price was $52 and the underwriting discount and commissions was $1.56. The selling shareholder has granted the underwriters the option to purchase up to an additional 1,717,150 common shares, at the initial public offering price less an underwriting discount of $1,56 per share, for a period of 30 days.\n\nThe underwriting investment bank takes on a central role in the IPO process. The underwriter (or the sponsor) plays the most important role in the IPO process and advises the firm on almost all aspects of a listing including the appointment of other professional advisers, such as the brokers, accountants, lawyers and a PR agency (if needed). Once the underwriter has been appointed, it is the underwriter’s job to make a diligent assessment of the company’s suitability for an IPO. It will advise the company on the structure and make-up of the board of directors and any restructuring of the capital, if needed.\n\nThe primary considerations when selecting an underwriter should be their expertise, experience, reputation and likely fees. Sometimes a company may select an underwriter for reasons other than the above mentioned. (As an example the case of the E-bay IPO that appointed Goldman Sachs as its underwriter) There are multiple motivations of involving multiple underwriters. On a first sight multiple underwriters would mean a larger number of investors. That would help the company to close its IPO at a higher price. Additionally multiple underwriters can be necessary depending on their specialization. There are number of banks that are more involved in the marketing of the transaction and others who lead structuring, pricing and allocation. Underwriters may also be chosen based on the historical relationship with these banks.\n\nThe underwriting discount provided the bulk of compensation for the underwriter as it is paid at a discounted price for the IPO shares and then sold them at the full offering price. In addition to the syndicate members, dealers were enlisted to sell a certain number of shares on a “best offer basis”. Usually in US the two most common types of underwriting are “bought deal” and “best effort deal” (Ferrari case). In a “bought deal”, the underwriter purchases a company's entire IPO issue and resells it to the investing public. In a “best effort deal”, the underwriter does not necessarily purchase any of the IPO issue, and only makes a guarantee to the company issuing the stock that it will use its \"best efforts\" to sell the issue to the investing public at the best price possible.\n\nPrice Stabilization determines a share price. Once the share price is determined, they're ready to trade publicly. The underwriter then uses all legal means to keep the share price above the offering price. On the Ferrari IPO prospectus, it was mentioned that the underwriters may engage in activities that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the common shares, during and after the offering.\n\nBook building is the process by which an underwriter attempts to determine the price at which an initial public offering (IPO) will be offered. An underwriter, normally an investment bank, builds a book by inviting institutional investors (fund managers et al.) to submit bids for the number of shares and the price(s) they would be willing to pay for them. During the Ferrari IPO process, the underwriter was engaged in book-building activities, which involved surveying potential investors to construct a schedule of investor demand for the new issue. By the time the registration statement was ready to become effective the underwriter and the offering firm’s management negotiated the final offering price and the discount. The worth of the Ferrari shares set an initial price range of $48 to $52 per share in early October. Following the road-show meetings with potential investors in both Europe and the United States, Marchionne knew there was strong demand for the shares that would be offered for sale in the IPO. If the offer price was set too low, FCA would leave money on the table, which suggested pricing the deal at the top of the initial range or beyond.\n\nA lock-up agreement is a contractual provision preventing insiders of a company from selling their shares for a specified period of time. They are commonly used as part of the initial public offering process (IPO). Although lock-up agreements are not required under federal law, Underwriters require executives, venture capitalists and other board members to sign lock-up agreements in order to prevent excessive selling pressure in the first few months of trading following an IPO. In Ferrari’s IPO prospectus in the lock up agreement section, Ferrari, FCA, Piero Ferrari and the chairman, Sergio Marchionne, have agreed that, subject to certain exceptions, they will not, without the prior written consent of UBS Securities LLC and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated offer, pledge, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of, or transfer all or a portion of the economic consequences of ownership of, any of our common shares or any securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for our common shares for a period of 90 days after the date of this prospectus.\n\nCapital structure is how a company funds its overall operations and growth. The capital structure is the particular combination of debt and equity used by a company to finance its overall operations and growth. Debt consists of borrowed money that is due back to the lender, commonly with interest expense. Equity consists of ownership rights in the company, without the need to pay back any investment. Both debt and equity can be found on the balance sheet. Company assets, also listed on the balance sheet, are purchased with this debt and equity. Capital structure can be a mixture of a company's long-term debt, short-term debt, common stock, and preferred stock. A company's proportion of short-term debt versus long-term debt is considered when analyzing its capital structure. In Ferrari‘s 2015 IPO case, the capital structure was evolutionary. Net Industrial Debt was the primary measure used by the management to analyze the financial leverage and capital structure, and was one of the key indicators, together with Net Debt, that was used to measure the company’s financial position. These measures were presented by management to aid investors in their analysis of the Group’s financial position and financial performance and to compare the Group’s financial position and financial performance with that of other companies. Net Industrial Debt was defined as total debt less cash and cash equivalents (Net Debt), further adjusted to exclude the funded portion of the self-liquidating financial receivables portfolio, which is the portion of our receivables from financing activities that we fund with external debt or inter-company loans. On February 9, 2018, the Company announced its intention to launch a share repurchase program. The program was intended to optimize the capital structure of the Company. Shares repurchased would also be used to meet the Company’s obligations arising from the equity incentive plan approved in 2017. As of December 31, 2018 the Company had repurchased 1,033,218 common shares for a total consideration of €100,093 thousand under the program.
