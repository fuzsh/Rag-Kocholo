        "text": "Petrolheads, listen up – this once-in-a-lifetime overnight stay is sure to get you revved up.\n\nHoliday rental platform Airbnb has announced its new ‘Icons’ category, featuring stays and experiences hosted by some of the world’s mega-stars, and the first 11 have been revealed. So far, they include staying in Prince’s Purple Rain House in Minneapolis, or laying your head in an X-Men 97-themed mansion in Westchester, New York.\n\nBut as for Europe, one of the stays we’re most excited for is the chance to visit the Ferrari Museum in Maranello, Italy.\n\nYep, not only will you get to attend a premier racing event in Emilia-Romagna with VIP tickets, courtesy of and alongside former Formula One driver Marc Gené, but you’ll have dinner at Cavallino, where Enzo Ferrari himself used to dine.\n\nA private tour of the Ferrari Museum is also on the itinerary, and you’ll sleep in a bed crafted with the same leather as those iconic Ferrari seats. But most excitingly, Marc will whizz you around a hot lap of the Pista di Fiorano race track in a Ferrari 296 GTB.\n\nHere are some snaps of the museum!\n\nStart your engines. Booking opens on Monday May 6, and you check out the listing and sign up for alerts right here.\n\nDid you see that Venice’s new tourist tax has officially launched?\n\nPlus: Has Milan really banned ice cream?"
