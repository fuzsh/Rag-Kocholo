        "text": "The Murcielago might've been the first Lamborghini built under Audi ownership, but it was a brute. Packing a nasty-sounding V-12 and some outrageously over-the-top looks, it was still very much a Lamborghini. Here's one with a manual transmission you can own today.\n\nThe Huayra is Pagani's second production car, following the legendary Zonda. It has a twin-turbo AMG V-12, and more intricate hand-built details than you can count. This roadster is up for grabs on eBay right now.\n\nI know what you're thinking: Why the hell is there a Bugatti on this list? It's a French company, after all. Well, the EB110 was conceived under Romano Artioli's ownership. He, along with the car's designer, Marcello Gandini, were Italian. Where was the car built? In Modena, by Italian engineers. Though Bugattis may now be created in France, this one certainly wasn't.\n\nFerrari's front-engine cars are usually angled towards grand touring, but not the F12 TdF. It's a hardcore track-ready variant of the F12berlinetta, ready to tackle anything you throw at it with that 770-horsepower naturally aspirated V-12.\n\nPeople use the term \"spaceship\" too often when it comes to describing low-slung supercars, but in the case of the Centenario, we think it actually applies. It looks unlike anything else on the road, and delivers an equally bespoke driving experience.\n\nThe Battista was unveiled at last year's Geneva Motor Show, and judging by the specs, it's one serious piece of kit. Its all-electric powertrain makes an astounding 1900 horsepower, enabling a sub-two-second 0-60 time, and a top speed of 217 mph.\n\nFollowing up the legendary Countach was no easy task, but Lamborghini was able to pull it off with the Diablo. Whether you like the early cars with pop-up headlights or the later fix-headlight versions, there's a Diablo for everyone out there. This SV version has low miles, and it's for sale.\n\nWedge-shaped looks, side louvers, and pop-up headlights are just some of the features on perhaps the most '80s Ferrari ever made, the Testarossa. It also has a flat-12 engine. No, not a V-12. A flat-12. This one's painted in a lovely shade of white, and it can be yours.\n\nThe Aventador SVJ hasn't been out for long, but it's already a legend. It smashed the Nurburgring Nordschleife lap record, beating the Porsche 911 GT2 RS with a time of 6:44. If that doesn't make it worthy of this list, we don't know what will. Here's a bright green example with 50 miles on the clock for sale right now.\n\nThe LaFerrari might be a hybrid, but it's a little bit more interesting than a Prius. It sends over 1000 horsepower to the rear wheels from a V-12-battery hybrid setup, and looks unlike anything else on the road. This one's painted grey, and it's on eBay right now for $3.5 million.\n\nThe new Huayra may be great and all, but the Zonda still holds a special place in our hearts. Its carbon fiber body, spectacularly designed interior, and fantastic-sounding AMG V-12 put it among the best Italian cars ever produced.\n\nMany call the Miura the first true supercar, and it's easy to see why. It has a transversely-mounted V-12 mounted behind the cabin, and looks stunning.\n\nThe 288 GTO was originally built to compete in Group B rally back in the 1980s, but after the series was canceled, Ferrari went on building the car as a production model. We drove one back in 2014, and it certainly lives up to the hype.\n\nThe Veneno and Veneno Roadster were ultra-low production supercars built by Lamborghini a few years back, sporting some extreme aero design and a 750-horsepower version of the Aventador's V-12 engine. This one recently popped up for sale at auction with a $6 million estimate.\n\nWhile the Pantera certainly looks the part of an Italian supercar, the powertrain tells a different story. Rather than some sort of exotic engine, a Ford-sourced 266-horsepower V-8 sits behind the driver. Here's a super-clean GT5-S up for grabs right now.\n\nThanks to its turbocharged engine, the 488 GTB is faster than the 458 Speciale. But that doesn't matter. Why? Well, the Speciale's engine note should explain things. This one is for sale on eBay for just $380,000.\n\nThe Huracan Performante currently holds the third-fastest production car lap around the Nurburgring, which should give you an idea of what kind of performance this car puts out. With trick aerodynamics and a 631-horsepower V-10, the Performante is one serious track machine. Here's one with just over 1000 miles on the clock you can own today.\n\nA removable top, gated manual transmission, and fantastic V-12 cemented the Ferrari F50 into collector status as soon as it hit the road, and it remains one of the most desirable Ferraris out there.\n\nLike the Miura, a lot of people consider the Countach to be one of the first real supercars to hit the road. Its outlandish looks and scissor doors give it all the flare necessary to make a stylish entrance, and that V-12 will have you smiling long after you park it up. This 5000QV is painted in a great shade of red, and it's for sale.\n\nPeople who've driven the F40 often say it's the best Ferrari out there. With a 478-horsepower twin-turbo V-8, a fantastic chassis, awesome '80s looks, and pop-up headlights, we can see why. Here's one with an insane 193 miles on the clock up for grabs on eBay right now."
