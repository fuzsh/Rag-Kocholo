The prancing horse represents Italian excellence all over the world. Just like other big supercar manufacturers Bugatti and Porsche, Ferrari has attracted the attention of, and collaborated with, a number of watch brands over the decades. There is no escaping the shared passion for cars and watches among enthusiasts of both subjects. Any dial adorned with the Italian brand name certainly has appeal far beyond owning one of the actual automobiles.\n\nEnthusiasts are blessed with a couple of main categories among Ferrari watches: remarkable and rare watch models with vintage characteristics or limited edition Ferrari watches. Girard-Perregaux was the first to introduce the most important Ferrari watch collections, exclusive brands like Panerai and Hublot followed in the 21st century. Choosing a Ferrari watch from the carefully chosen selection at the online Ormoda store comes with a 2-year-guarantee, you can't make a wrong decision by choosing from our online collection at Ormoda. But just like the beloved supercar itself, a Ferrari watch is going to last for decades.\n\nThe History of Ferrari watches\n\nThe history of Ferrari watches begins in 1929, when Italian entrepreneur Enzo Ferrari founded the Ferrari brand by naming his Formula One team \"Scuderia Ferrari.\" In 1950, Enzo Ferrari was given a watch. Ferrari came up with the idea of giving watches on the most important occasions. To maintain exclusivity, he bought six watches at a time. Production of the first series of Ferrari watches started in the 1970s. The best of this series were given as gifts. In 1983, Ferrari launched a new collection of men's watches. The colors of the Ferrari logo were incorporated in the dials. The red, yellow and black symbolizing speed, strength and courage.\n\nSome Ferrari watch models are sporty, while others classic and elegant. A Ferrari watch is a status symbol for successful men, comparable to a luxury car. These beautiful men's watches are an accessory to wear in luxurious settings. Whether the watch is made to radiate sportyness or class, the manufacturers made use of the finest materials. The Scuderia Ferrari watch is sporty and sophisticated, just like the brand's cars. Ferrari has become part of Italy's identity and translates this passion in its design. The Scuderia watches for men express passion, determination, technique and character and only those who possess these qualities can do this watch justice by wearing it with the right style.\n\nScuderia Ferrari watch - full of passion\n\nThe Ferrari Scuderia watch stands for tradition, innovation and pure racing emotions. The watch encourages millions of fans to live their time with passion. A passion that knows no age limits. The Ferrari watch collection offered by Ormodo is filled with models for adults and children that allow you to relive this great passion every day.\n\nIf passion drives your engine and racing is your passion, then you have found what you are looking for in a Scuderia Ferrari timepiece. An icon to proudly wear on your wrist, quality and excellence combined into an extraordinary design. The Scuderia Ferrari One was a project where Crealuxe cooperated with the Italian in-house design team, led by Flavio Manzoni. This was to create an exciting new Ferrari chassis for the high-performance Cabestan engine inside. And what a one. A Scuderia watch Ferrari is still very much loved and special today.\n\nUnique Hublot Ferrari watch\n\nThe Hublot Ferrari watch collection is inspired by Ferrari, one of the world's top luxury supercar manufacturers. With countless Ferrari-related watches dating back more than half a century, the latest designs of Hublot watches come with a new and refreshing take on this piece of history creating a new subgenre in the exclusive world of luxury watches. The only real comparable collaboration is the successful partnership between Breitling and Bentley, which was the first car manufacturer-watchmaker collaboration to draw attention from many more people other than just the actual car owners. Ferrari's cooperation has already produced more models than all of its predecessors combined. Hublot is the Tourette of watchmaking, the marriage between Hublot and Ferrari seems assured.\n\nThe Ferrari watch Hublot collection was focused on creating groundbreaking timepieces that continue to impress expert watchmakers worldwide. From bold, skeletal styles to striking, tri-colored dials, the Hublot timepiece will definitely turn some heads. If you admire high-end, luxury wristwatches, consider a Hublot watch.\n\nBuying an Affordable Ferrari watch\n\nA Ferrari sports car on the driveway is not for everyone, but fortunately buying a Ferrari watch is a lot more affordable. The sporty design of Ferrari watches also maintains its class through the Italian design. The color red, or the rossa corsa, is the Italian motorsport color and therefore not missing from the unique watch collection for men and women.
