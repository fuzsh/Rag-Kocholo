This article aims to provide non-Italians with a comprehensive understanding of the hiring regulations and benefits associated with employing individuals from protected categories. Let's explore what the law entails, who falls under these categories, how hiring is ensured, and what incentives companies can receive for hiring from these groups.\n\nThe Regulatory Framework:\n\nItalian law recognizes the right to work for all citizens, including those with disabilities. Law 68/99 outlines the rules for mandatory employment of individuals with disabilities and emphasizes equal treatment and integration in the workforce. The law also promotes targeted placement services to evaluate capabilities and find suitable positions for people with disability.\n\nProtected Categories (categorie protette)\n\nProtected categories include individuals with physical, psychological, sensory, or mental disabilities, whose work capacity is reduced by more than 45%. It also includes people with a work disability over 33%, blind or deaf individuals, war invalids, and servicemen with specific impairments. The law extends to orphans, surviving spouses of war-related deaths, victims of terrorism and organized crime, and their families.\n\nSupporting Employment:\n\nThe mandatory hiring of protected categories aims to support individuals facing disadvantages in finding employment. The law encourages reasonable adjustments in the workplace to ensure equal treatment and opportunities for people with disabilities. These adjustments align with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.\n\nPenalties for Non-Compliance:\n\nCompanies failing to fulfill the hiring quota or submit the required \"disability information statement\" face penalties. Starting from January 2022, the omission or delayed submission of the statement incurs an administrative fine. Employers who do not hire within 60 days of the obligation arising may face penalties per day for each unemployed worker with a disability.\n\nObligation to Hire:\n\nCompanies with at least 14 employees must hire protected categories workers when they reach the 15th employee or when a position occupied by a person with disability becomes available. This obligation ensures greater inclusion of individuals with disability in the job market and supports their integration.\n\nHow to calculate the Quota:\n\nCalculating the protected category quota is an important aspect for companies to ensure inclusivity and comply with the law. According to Law No. 68 of March 12, 1999, the size of the company determines the minimum quota of employees with disability that must be met. Here are the guidelines:\n\nCompanies with 15 to 35 employees should have at least one worker in their workforce belonging to protected categories.\n\nCompanies with 36 to 50 employees should employ a minimum of two workers in their workforce belonging to protected categories.\n\nCompanies with over 50 employees are required to have a protected category quota equal to 7% of their total workforce.\n\nIt's worth noting that workers with a work capacity reduction of 60% or more can be included in the protected category quota. Additionally, non-European Union citizens residing in Italy and recognised as people with disability by Italian authorities responsible for determining disability are also considered part of the protected categories under Law 68 of 1999.\n\nRecruitment Strategies:\n\nThere are several effective methods for recruiting Categorie Protette individuals in Italy.\n\n1 - The first approach involves searching for specific keywords on CVs, such as \"categorie protette,\" \"Cat prot,\" \"disabilit*,\" or \"Legge 104/92,\" which relates to disabilities.\n\n2- Utilizing this Boolean string sample, which combines these relevant terms, employers can identify potential candidates who fall within the Categorie Protette category:\n\n(\"categorie protette\" OR \"Cat prot\" OR \"disabilit*\" OR \"Legge 104/92\")\n\n3- Alternatively, companies can opt for the third method by engaging external agencies that specialize in recruiting individuals from this category. These agencies possess the necessary expertise and resources to connect employers with qualified candidates who meet the criteria for Categorie Protette. Some of them are:\n\nSynergie Italia / Umana / Alvin Consulting /\n\n4 - Partecipate to dedicated job fair and conferences, one of the I went in the past and was very impactful is Diversity Day\n\n5 - Learn more about it. Disability: IN is a Non Profit Organisation where I found the most useful information in English about hiring people with disability.\n\nHiring from protected categories is not only a legal requirement in Italy but also an opportunity to foster inclusivity and diversity in the workplace. By understanding the regulatory framework, recognizing the protected categories, and leveraging recruitment strategies, employers can unlock the potential of talented individuals with disabilities.\n\n#InclusiveHiring #DiversityandInclusion #EqualOpportunity #AccessibilityMatters #InclusionMatters #DisabilityEmployment #BuildingDiverseTeams #InclusiveWorkplace #EqualRights #EmpoweringTalent #InclusiveRecruitment #BreakingBarriers #CreatingOpportunities #PromotingDiversity #AccessibleEmployment #EmbracingDifferences #InclusionRevolution #InclusiveCulture #DiverseTalentPool #InclusiveLeadership #UnlockingPotential #BridgingTheGap #SupportingInclusion #EqualAccess #EmpowermentThroughEmployment #InclusiveSociety #CelebratingDiversity #BreakingDownBarriers #EmbracingAllAbilities #InclusiveProgress #BuildingInclusiveCommunities #InclusiveEmployment"
