An Alfa Romeo driver since 1924, Enzo Ferrari founded his own racing team, Scuderia Ferrari, in Modena in 1929 initially to race Alfa Romeo cars. In 1939 he set up his own company, initially called Auto Avio Costruzioni. In late 1943, Enzo Ferrari moved his headquarters from Modena to Maranello, which remains the headquarters to this day.\n\n2015\n\nFerrari believes their cars are the epitome of performance, luxury and styling and currently sell seven models, including four sports cars (488 GTB, 488 Spider, F12berlinetta and special series F12 Tour de France, or F12tdf) and three GT cars (California T, FF and the new GTC4Lusso). The 488 GTB and the 488 Spider were launched in 2015 to replace the 458 Italia and 458 Spider, which Ferrari produced and sold in 2015 but are now discontinued. The F12tdf, unveiled in October 2015, is the latest special series and follows the 458 Speciale and 458 Speciale A, which Ferrari produced and sold in 2015 but are now discontinued. In February 2016, Ferrari unveiled the new GTC4Lusso, the latest GT car, which will replace the FF, with sales expected to begin in the second semester of 2016. ferrari also produce a limited edition supercar, LaFerrari, and very limited editions series (Fuoriserie) and one-off cars.\n\nFerrari Racing History\n\nFerrari made its independent racing debut at a race in Piacenza, Italy. Enzo Ferrari had been designing race cars for Alpha Romeo since the late 1920s, and it was not until after the war that he broke from Alpha to form his own car manufacturing firm. Ferrari entered his Tipo 125 car at the race in Piacenza. Featuring a revolutionary V-12 engine, the Tipo 125 led the race with two laps to go before a fuel pump failed and forced it from the race.\n\nThe result pleased Ferrari. In 1947, his company built and sold three Tipo 125 cars. Also, a Ferrari first at the race in Piacenza was the prancing horse hood ornament characteristic of all Ferraris since. Enzo had adopted the logo a few years earlier in honor of Italian World War I ace Enrico Baracca. Having met Baracca’s parents at a social event, Enzo decided to honor their son by taking on the prancing horse logo that he had worn on the side of his airplane. Ferrari added the canary yellow background to honor his home city of Modena. With the prancing horse hood ornament, Ferrari would go on to unparalleled racing success, including nine Formula One Grand Prix World Championships.\n\nFerrari’s Formula 1 racing team, Scuderia Ferrari, the most successful team in Formula 1 history. From the inaugural year of Formula 1 in 1950 through 2010, Scuderia Ferrari has won 224 Grand Prix races, 16 Constructor World titles and 15 Drivers’ World titles."
