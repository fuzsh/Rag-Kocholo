        "text": "Overview\n\nWe never thought we'd see the day when a Ferrari SUV became a reality, but in the wake of many successful high-dollar, high-performance sport-utes the company has finally caved to unrelenting marketplace pressure and produced 2024 Purosangue. An SUV with Ferrari's prancing horse badge on the grille won't ruin the brand, though. After all, successful iterations of the concept have served sports-car brands such as Porsche and Lamborghini quite well. It’s not only ultra-performance utes like the Cayenne Turbo or the Urus that the Purosangue will have in its crosshairs but also ultra-luxury models such as the Bentley Bentayga and the Rolls-Royce Cullinan. A thundering V-12 engine is the only powertrain offered—why would it need anything else? The engineers have also buttressed the ‘Sangue’s ride-and-handling with a trick active suspension system to help it drive as a Ferrari should. Expect to need a hedge-fund manager's salary to afford it, of course; prices start just over $400,000 including the compulsory gas-guzzler tax.\n\nWhat's New for 2024?\n\nThe Purosangue is an all-new model for the Ferrari lineup as well as the Italian supercar maker's first SUV.\n\nPricing and Which One to Buy\n\nA host of luxury and performance features come standard on the Purosangue, but Ferrari does have some options that buyers may want to consider. Massaging front seats might be a nice thing to have after a long day of cruising down the Monte Carlo coast, and sunseekers may be tempted by the available electrochromic glass roof. Either way, we’d suggest making liberal use of Ferrari’s personalization options to create a Purosangue that’s puro you.\n\nEngine, Transmission, and Performance\n\nTo purists scoffing at an SUV wearing the famed prancing horse badge, we’ll point to the naturally-aspirated 6.5-liter V-12 engine lurking under the Purosangue’s hood. Nothing says Ferrari more than a screaming 715-hp twelve-cylinder, and it even wears the brand’s signature red-painted valve colors. The engine makes a hearty 528 pound-feet of torque, and we estimate that it should power the Purosangue to 60 mph in just 3.2 seconds and on to a top speed of 193 mph. We came away from our initial test drive quite impressed with the Purosangue's handling and performance, alleviating any remaining doubt we had that Ferrari's first SUV would be a dud. An adaptive suspension system is standard and uses an electric motor at each corner of the SUV to apply force to the dampers during cornering maneuvers to control body roll. As such, the Purosangue has no need for traditional anti-roll bars, and it can also hunker down during hard driving by reducing its ride height by 0.4 inches. At full chat, the Purosangue does its best impression of its sports car siblings and it's one that's fairly convincing.\n\nFuel Economy and Real-World MPG\n\nKiss your gas money goodbye: The V-12–powered Purosangue is one of Ferrari’s least fuel-efficient offerings. The EPA estimates it's good for only 12 mpg city and 16 mpg highway, but for context, both the Urus and the 12-cylinder Bentayga earn similar ratings of 12 mpg city, 17 mpg highway. When we get a chance, we'll take the Purosangue on our 75-mph highway fuel economy route and update this story with its test results. For more information about the Purosangue’s fuel economy, visit the EPA's website.\n\nInterior, Comfort, and Cargo\n\nAs the only current Ferrari to offer legitimate room for four riders, the Purosangue is outfitted with a set of slick rear-hinged coach-style (also called “suicide”) rear doors that are said to make it easier to access the back seat while preserving a two-door appearance. The front and rear seats are individual buckets, meaning there’s no bench in the back for an occasional fifth passenger, and both rows have a center console and a center console. Of course, the interior is swathed in Ferrari-quality materials. To say that the cockpit is driver-oriented would be an understatement as most of the car’s controls are operated through the steering wheel; a big surprise in this era of tablet-style center-stack screens is that there is no center-mounted infotainment touchscreen. A glass roof is optional but if you don’t care about seeing the sun while driving, sticking with the standard carbon-fiber roof panel will save some weight.\n\nInfotainment and Connectivity\n\nWhile there’s no centrally mounted infotainment display, there is a 10.2-inch digital gauge cluster and a separate 10.2-inch screen for the front passenger. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are both standard but an in-dash navigation system is not offered—Ferrari assumes most people would just use their phones for such a service.\n\nSafety and Driver-Assistance Features\n\nThe Purosangue comes standard with several driver-assistance features, including automated emergency braking, automatic high-beam headlamps, and adaptive cruise control. For more information about the Purosangue’s crash test results, visit the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) websites. Key safety features include:\n\nStandard automated emergency braking and blind-spot monitoring\n\nStandard lane-departure warning with lane-keeping assist\n\nStandard adaptive cruise control\n\nWarranty and Maintenance Coverage\n\nFerrari offers limited- and powertrain-warranty coverage identical to that provided by Lamborghini. However, Ferrari one-ups its rival when it comes to complimentary scheduled maintenance; with Ferrari vehicles, you get seven years of coverage. With Lamborghini vehicles, complimentary scheduled maintenance isn't offered.\n\nLimited warranty covers 3 years or unlimited miles\n\nPowertrain warranty covers 3 years or unlimited miles\n\nComplimentary scheduled maintenance covers 7 years or unlimited miles"
