        "text": "I drive a 14 year old, beige, Toyota Camry. It doesn’t have hubcaps. It does have a huge dent I put in the rear bumper. I don’t remember the last time I washed it.\n\nBut I love it because it’s paid off and (usually) runs. That’s all that matters to me in a car.\n\nSo when Kevin dragged me to the famous Enzo Ferrari museum in Modena, Italy I expected to be bored. Sports cars? Meh.\n\nTo my surprise, I was really impressed! Each of the cars in the exhibit was a true work of art–colorful, shiny, shapely, and sleek. Bonus: They were fun to photograph!\n\nI learned that this part of Italy, the Emilia Romagna region, has a long history of auto racing and manufacturing ultra-luxe sports cars. The museum’s namesake, Enzo Ferrari, started the Scuderia Ferrari racing team on the site of the Modena museum back in 1929. Later, he started manufacturing his own brand of sports cars at a factory in nearby Maranello (there’s a museum there, too). The Modena museum is currently hosting an exhibit of Maserati sports cars (founded in Bologna, Italy), to celebrate the brand’s 100 year anniversary.\n\nTo ensure meticulous attention to detail (plus scarcity and exclusivity), each car is still built by hand.\n\nEngineers still climb into, under, and on top of each car as it moves down the assembly line. Ferrari is among the few brands that still do things this way, like Bentley, Rolls-Royce, and Lamborghini. Source: Wired.\n\nThis may not be for long. Per the article above, the company is under new leadership and considering driving up production to sell more cars.\n\nWhile they’ll never be within my reach, it was fun to see how the other half drives.\n\n(I still like my Camry.)\n\nPhotos from the Ferrari Modena Museum and the Maserati Centennial Exhibit:\n\nThanks to Tourism Emilia Romagna for the museum passes and the car envy.\n\nHow about you–are you into cars?"
