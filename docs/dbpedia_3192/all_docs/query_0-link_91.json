        "text": "3.2K\n\nLittle did Enzo Ferrari know that his car company and the “prancing horse” logo would become iconic over time. The iconic Ferrari logo is one of the most recognizable symbols in the world.\n\nApart from its cars, the Ferrari logo can be seen in various merchandise such as jackets, bracelets, and key rings. If you are in doubt about the popularity of the iconic automobile company, traveling to the remotest locations in the world might help you! Well, this is not a dare! You can find the iconic logo in various counterfeit items in regions where modernity has hardly made an entry.\n\nGood read – Branded merchandise: how to create winning merch for your brand.\n\nThe prancing horse\n\nREDESIGN\n\nThe inspiration for the iconic logo came from a World War I combat aircraft. According to Ferrari, Enzo Ferrari, the founder of the iconic automobile company, saw the image of a prancing red horse on the fuselage of an Italian aircraft flown by ace fighter pilot Count Francesco Baracca, a World War I hero. Enzo spoke of the emblem’s provenance only once, and this is what he said:\n\n“In ’23, I met Count Enrico Baracca, the hero’s father and then his mother, Countess Paolina, who said to me one day, ‘Ferrari, put my son’s prancing horse on your cars. It will bring you good luck.’ The horse was, and still is, black. And I added the canary-yellow background, which is the color of Modena.”\n\nFun fact: Modena, the Italian city, is the birthplace of Enzo.\n\nThe red horse from the fuselage was reimagined in black for the iconic logo. The black horse mourns the fall of the great pilot while in action. Baracca’s aircraft was shot by ground troops when it caught fire and crashed with the brave pilot.\n\nHere is a fantastic video by Ferrari on the origin story of its iconic logo.\n\nA brief history of Ferrari\n\nWhen Enzo Ferrari established Scuderia Ferrari in 1929, he did not want to manufacture automobiles for the road. Scuderia Ferrari, the racing wing of Alfa Romeo, quickly became popular for winning various races. After a successful winning streak, Enzo left Alfa Romeo to form his own company in 1930. Soon after, the new company, Auto Avio Costruzioni, built its first spider-powered 1500 cc 8-cylinder engine and contested it in the 1940 Mille Miglia.\n\nIn 1943, Enzo relocated to Maranello due to a bomb explosion at his Modena auto shop. While World War II had gripped the world, Enzo remained focused on developing a new engine. As soon as the war came to an end, Enzo built his 125 S, which was powered by a V12 engine.\n\nOn May 11, 1947, the new model entered its debut race at Piacenza Circuit. And just after 14 days, it won its maiden Rome Grand Prix. With its first victory at the Terme di Caracalla, the Italian auto giant became unstoppable and won several races.\n\nThe Ferrari logo\n\nA logo is an essential visual asset of a brand. Some companies go to extreme lengths to protect their visual identities. While brand gurus believe that logos are an important aspect of building and fostering brand identity, it is not the only element a brand is defined by. Various elements come together in harmony in establishing brand identity. However, brand gurus and companies do not always agree. Some brands even take extreme legal actions to protect their logos.\n\nWhile there are many iconic emblems: only a few have become as popular as the Ferrari logo.\n\nLet us now take a closer look at the logo.\n\nFerrari logo meaning\n\nThe Ferrari logo is made up of various distinct elements that come together in harmony. But let us first try to understand the meaning behind the iconic symbol. The top of the yellow shield is designed with the Italian tri-color, and placed below is the famous black prancing horse with the letters ‘S’ and ‘F’ engraved on either side of the horse’s hind leg. The Ferrari wordmark finds its place right below the emblem.\n\nThe black prancing horse, as mentioned above, pays tribute to the Italian braveheart who lost his life in an air crash during World War I. But what do the mysterious ‘S’ and ‘F’ stand for? Well, those are the initials of Enzo’s first racing team, “Scuderia Ferrari,” the racing wing of Alfa Romeo.\n\nThe Italian term also means a stable.\n\nApart from paying tribute to Count Francesco Baracca, the horse symbolizes speed and freedom. According to heraldry, this position of the horse is symbolic of victory and power.\n\nEvolution of the Ferrari logo\n\nThe auto giant changed its logo five times since its inception in 1929. While the centerpiece of the logo design remained the same, the changes were somewhere between complete overhaul and partial refresh.\n\n1929 – 1931\n\nThe iconic black prancing horse first appeared on a yellow shield in 1929. The iconic logo, as mentioned above, took inspiration from a crashed combat aircraft and the Italian national colors. The top of the shield was executed in yellow, black, white, and red colors, with the letters ‘S’ and ‘F’ placed below the prancing horse.\n\n1931 – 1939\n\nIn 1931, Ferrari made a partial change to its visual identity, turning the curved lines at the top of the shield into horizontal ones. The Italian flag color palette also became more prominent in the 1931 version of the logo and has remained the same ever since, except for the 1939 version.\n\nThe white accents were gone, and the horse appeared cleaner. The thick black outline was done away with, making the new logo look cleaner, fresher, and brighter.\n\n1939 – Present\n\nIn 1939, Ferrari introduced a new badge completely different from its predecessors. From the shape to the colors, the 1939 version of the logo looked like an image straight out of a fairytale story. One of the highlights of the new logo was the change made to the horse. The prancing horse now looked like Pegasus from Greek mythology. The horse was turned right with two spread wings. The new badge came with the inscription “Auto-Avio Costruzioni.”\n\n1947 – 2002\n\nThe shield was removed and replaced by a vertical rectangle with rounded edges in 1947. Other elements of the logo, such as the color palette, Italian flag, and wordmark, remained the same. The horse received a contemporary makeover with white accents, which gave the prancing horse a sense of motion.\n\n2002 – Present\n\nThe 2002 redesign retained much of the design elements from its 1947 counterpart. The only visible change was made to the flag: the black lines that separated the green, white and red stripes were removed, which made the logo look cleaner and more sophisticated.\n\nGood read: What makes a great logo?\n\nColor palette\n\nThe black horse in the logo symbolizes power, speed, and movement. Furthermore, the black horse mourns the Italian braveheart. The color yellow represents the birth city of Enzo, Modena. The color also symbolizes warmth, happiness, and innovation.\n\nFerrari logo typeface\n\nThe Ferro Rosso font appears similar to the slab serif used in the Ferrari wordmark. The font used in the logo has not changed much since its creation; however, it definitely has lost weight. The lines have become more subtle and elegant over the years.\n\nWhat makes the Ferrari logo iconic?\n\nA logo turns iconic not by coincidence but due to several factors.
