        "text": "The clothing line comes from creative director and former Armani designer Rocco Iannone while Michelin-starred Italian chef Massimo Bottura is relaunching the restaurant where founder Enzo Ferrari once dined with friends and Formula One stars.\n\nNicola Boari, Ferrari's chief brand diversification officer, told Reuters the aim was to reach new clients \"in terms of both age and culture\" – beyond its racing fans and sports car clients who already covet its branded jackets, T-shirts and hats.\n\nThe customer base for Ferrari's cars is limited by design to under 10,000 vehicles a year – fewer clients than Bottura's new restaurant could serve in the same time – and the luxury carmaker has said it hoped its so-called brand extension strategy would account for 10% of profits within a decade.\n\nFerrari is far from the first luxury car brand to venture into lifestyle businesses. Others like Volkswagen's Lamborghini and Bentley, as well as U.S. motorcycle maker Harley-Davidson, have turned to clothing collections. Ferrari's foray into haute cuisine too follows in the steps of luxury fashion groups, including France's LVMH and Kering's Gucci, which also turned to Bottura for its first restaurant in Florence and a second in Beverly Hills.\n\n\"Ferrari is one of the strongest brands in the world and definitely the strongest brand in the luxury industry,\" said Massimo Pizzo of Brand Finance, a brand valuation consultancy.\n\n\"It has the potential to succeed even in the luxury apparel industry,\" he said.\n\nAnalysts are skeptical\n\nFerrari's former chief executive Louis Camilleri unveiled the brand extension strategy, which includes fashion, restaurants, and other luxury experiences, in 2019 just before the coronavirus pandemic struck and delayed the plans.\n\nRelated stories\n\nThe launch now comes days after the appointment of new Chief Executive Benedetto Vigna, a 52-year-old physicist who has spent 26 years at semiconductor maker STMicroelectronics and is expected to drive Ferrari into the era of electric cars.\n\nCamilleri said Ferrari's brand spin-offs were too stretched and planned to cut about half of the carmaker's license agreements and trim some 30% of its product categories.\n\nPerfumes have since disappeared from the shelves of Ferrari's existing stores, for example, as have some low-end products with no real value beyond the logo.\n\nAnalysts said it would take time for Ferrari's new brand strategy to succeed, while some were cautious about its potential contribution to profitability.\n\n\"Given the kind of scale you need to be profitable in luxury, I don't think this will be accretive to Ferrari's margins, which are quite high already,\" said Susy Tibaldi, luxury analyst at Swiss bank UBS.\n\nFerrari, which plans initially to sell its fashion line through its stores and online, will be competing with luxury heavyweights in a market estimated to be worth some 280 billion euros ($341 billion) this year.\n\nFerrari declined to give details of its collection ahead of the big reveal on Sunday.\n\nAs it moves away from the licensed apparel it already sells, industry sources expect the clothing line to fall within a \"middle luxury\" category, a notch below top brands such as Gucci or Italy's Prada and Dolce & Gabbana.\n\nThe collection is expected to include ready-to-wear items made with high-end fabrics, rather than more relaxed streetwear looks, the sources said."
