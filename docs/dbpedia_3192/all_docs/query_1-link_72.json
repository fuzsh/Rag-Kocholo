        "text": "The Italian manufacturer has been a part of the sport for an incredibly long time now. In 1947, Ferrari had launched its first production car, the Ferrari 125 S, which was powered by a 1.5-liter V12 engine. It was also the year when Ferrari participated in its first race as a constructor, winning the Rome Grand Prix.\n\nThroughout the 1950s, Ferrari made a name for itself as a racing team, dominating the Formula 1 circuit with legendary drivers like Alberto Ascari, Juan Manuel Fangio, and Mike Hawthorn.\n\nIn the 1960s, Ferrari continued to compete in Formula 1, achieving more success and building some of its most iconic cars, including the Ferrari 250 GT and the Ferrari 330 P4. Ferrari also expanded its production line to include luxury sports cars that were sold to wealthy individuals around the world.\n\nAs Ferrari's success in motorsports grew, the company also began supplying engines to other racing teams. In the 1960s, Ferrari also supplied engines to teams such as Cooper, Lola, and Tecno.\n\nIn the 90s, Scuderia Ferrari was led by the legendary driver Michael Schumacher, who won five consecutive World Drivers' Championships (1994-1995 and 2000-2004) with the team. During this era, Ferrari became the most dominant team in the sport, winning six Constructors' Championships (1999-2004) and numerous individual races.\n\nToday, Scuderia Ferrari is still recognized as one of the most successful and iconic names in the world of motorsport."
