        "text": "Approved by the Board of Directors on May 12, 2022\n\nTONE AT THE TOP\n\nThe foundation of Ferrari’s governance model is the Code of Conduct, duly approved by the Board of Directors of Ferrari N.V. (“Ferrari” or the “Company”) and which also represents the reference framework for tax management, embodying a set of values that are recognized, adhered to and promoted by the Company in tax matters too.\n\nAs a result of this, the Ferrari Tax Strategy, inspired by the Code of Conduct, is approved by the Board of Directors of the Company and it applies to Ferrari and its subsidiaries which are collectively defined as the “Ferrari Group”.\n\nThe Audit Committee of Ferrari shall be responsible for overseeing that the Company’s compliance practices are in line with the Tax Strategy.\n\nTAX VALUES\n\nInspired by the Code of Conduct, Ferrari tax management is carried out in accordance with the following tax values.\n\nIntegrity\n\nThe Ferrari Group strives to maintain high standards of integrity concerning tax accounting and tax compliance, in order to pay the amount of taxes legally due in any territory, in accordance with the rules set out by governments.\n\nFor the same reason, Ferrari is strongly committed to align - as fairly as possible - the place of taxation with the place of value creation, so as to pay the legally due amount of taxes, in the right place, at the right time.\n\nFurthermore, the Ferrari Group’s internal controls are designed to ensure integrity and accuracy in the recording and reporting of all business transactions, based on which the tax figures are calculated.\n\nZero tolerance\n\nTo maintain Ferrari Group’s worldwide reputation, Ferrari does not tolerate infringements and complies with all applicable tax laws and regulations, through the implementation of preventive measures and through the rigorous enforcement of its Tax Strategy to ensure that ethics and integrity are respected.\n\nSustainable and lasting growth\n\nFerrari is committed to sustainable practices in its tax risk management activities, considering that taxes are a key contribution to the economies of the countries where the Group carries out its business and with a view to protect the Company reputation over time.\n\nAt the same time, with the objective of increasing shareholder value, Ferrari operates legitimate tax planning that embraces both the letter and the spirit of the law, such as the use of the tax incentives provided for by the relevant tax legislation.\n\nTax Authorities engagement\n\nFerrari engages a pro-active relationship with the competent Tax Authorities, in the jurisdictions where the Group operates, approaching them with openness, honesty and integrity.\n\nIn dealing with Tax Authorities, Ferrari transparently provides access to all information on relevant facts and circumstances, to be examined and fully known for an appropriate analysis by the Public Authority.\n\nTax Disclosure\n\nFerrari is committed to including always the most appropriate set of tax information in its financial and non-financial reporting, enabling it to communicate its approach in relation to tax and its own effective tax.\n\nThe disclosure path should be reasonably balanced with the paramount need to keep certain information strictly confidential (i.e. information which, if disclosed, may result in commercial, reputational or legal damage to the Ferrari Group).\n\nTAX PRINCIPLES\n\nPursuant to the values adopted in the Ferrari Code of Conduct and relevant also for tax purposes as stated above, the Tax Strategy defines and declines tax management in a way that fully implements the tax principles stated below.\n\nFull compliance with applicable tax laws and regulations - fulfill tax payments, tax returns and any other tax requirements on a fair, accurate and timely basis.\n\nSustainable approach to tax - ensure an ethical tax conduct while providing superior and sustainable returns to Ferrari shareholders, by applying the legally due level of taxation, aware that through the taxes paid, Ferrari contributes to the growth of the economies and to the reinforcement of social cohesion of the jurisdictions where it operates.\n\nTax Risk Management - Ferrari is not willing to take tax risks and it will continue to implement compliance controls to mitigate the tax risk factors of breaching tax regulations or abusing any principles or aims of any applicable tax regulations.\n\nTax Transparency - be co-operative and transparent in the approach with Tax Authorities, nurturing a relationship based on good faith in order to achieve certainty on the tax positions adopted.\n\nTax Culture - promote the Company’s tax culture, inspired by the principles, values and guidelines underlying the Ferrari Tax Strategy, leading to the correct application of the tax regulations and the proper disclosure of the approach to tax, also with training sessions for all employees, including employees outside of the Tax Department.\n\nTAX PRACTICES\n\nFerrari's Tax Strategy is set out in the following basic rules that the Company intends to maintain, in the daily tax behaviours, in order to achieve the strategic objectives it has committed to.\n\nTax uncertainty\n\nFerrari is always inspired to minimise tax uncertainties.\n\nWhereas tax law is unclear or subject to interpretations, Ferrari performs an in -depth tax assessment, to take a reasonable interpretative approach, based on the principle of legality and eventually supported by external advisers, to ensure that the position taken would, more likely than not, be settled in Ferrari’s favour.\n\nFurthermore, in order to better reflect clarity and fairness in all tax matters of the Group’s companies, advance tax rulings and advance pricing agreements may be requested.\n\nAgree to disagree\n\nAll significant tax audits must be subject to risk assessment to analyse and determine the choice of any potential compromise positions on audit and the method thereof versus litigation and other dispute resolution procedures (i.e. Mutual Agreement Procedures).\n\nIn its own interest and in the interest of its shareholders, Ferrari supports - also in the event of any tax dispute - the reasonable and strong technical position in case of any interpretation differences with the competent Tax Authorities.\n\nCo-operative approach with Tax Authorities\n\nFerrari promotes the progressive adherence of the most relevant Group entities to the co - operative compliance regimes, to ensure that the Group gains certainty in exchange for transparency.\n\nTax Authority enquiries and audits will be handled by the Tax Department, enabling the collection of relevant information to be used for the analysis by the Public Authority.\n\nFurthermore, Ferrari applies the provisions on transfer pricing documentation, in line with OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines, to further enhance transparency with Tax Authorities.\n\nRelated parties transactions\n\nCross-border relations between Group entities are not influenced other than by the application of the widely recognized principle requiring related parties transactions to be conducted at arm’s length terms and conditions, as defined by the OECD Model Tax Convention and OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines.\n\nAggressive Tax Planning\n\nThe Ferrari Group does not artificially use countries with privileged taxation (i. e. Tax havens), for the sole purpose of reducing the Group’s tax burden.\n\nThe jurisdictions in which the Group entities are located reflect in any case the economic substance of the transactions related to the territories concerned and these transactions are taxed where value is added.\n\nInternal controls over tax risks\n\nThe Ferrari Group’s policy is to maintain effective internal control systems to ensure compliance with tax laws.\n\nStarting from the most significant entities of the Group, Ferrari is progressively implementing the control system that is specifically focused on tax risks - Tax Control Framework or TCF - in line with OECD guidelines, as transposed by the Italian Tax Authorities, to properly identify, measure, manage and control any tax risks (i.e. breaching tax rules or manipulating the tax system).\n\nIn the TCF, roles and responsibilities in the tax management process are clearly defined, in compliance with the principles of segregation of duties and escalation of decisions.\n\nOn a yearly basis, a report is submitted to the Board of Directors, through the Audit Committee, on the outcomes of the reviews on the Tax Control Framework together with the remedy measures on the relevant issues.\n\nWhistleblowing\n\nFerrari is committed to fully implement and maintain a global Whistleblowing Procedure, providing for anonymous channels made available by the Group to encourage reporting of any illegal or suspicious tax-related conducts, as well as communication of any tax-related concerns. Pursuant to the Ferrari Code of Conduct, there is absolutely no tolerance for retaliation in any form against a person who reports a concern in good faith."
