        "text": "Museums and monuments\n\nEmilia Romagna\n\nEmilia Romagna, Formula1 and Ferrari\n\nJourney into the land of the people who revolutionized our way of conceiving engines and speed.\n\n3 minutes\n\nShare\n\nIndex\n\nA trip to Emilia Romagna is a trip to the land of motors. After all, it was here that one of the greatest symbols of Made in Italy was born a legend: the Ferrari brand. This beautiful Region offers car lovers a grand series of pertinent places and events, including the Motor Show, the Imola Circuit, the relatively new Autodromo Marzaglia, the Righini, Panini and Stanguellini Collections, Museo Ferrari and the recently-opened Enzo Ferrari House Museum.\n\nMap\n\nMuseo Ferrari in Maranello\n\nPreserving the relics of everybody's favorite sportscar, the Museo Ferrari in Maranello (Modena), receives over 200,000 visitors from around the world every year. The exhibition changes constantly, with diverse offerings that satisfy both car racing fans and vintage car aficionados alike. Among the most attractive display rooms is that boasting approximately 40 prestigious models on rotation, deriving from museums and private collectors; the models show off the evolution of Ferrari style and design.\n\nThen, a hall dedicated to Formula One and Cavallino, the Victory Hall, celebrates the victories of the Scuderia, displaying World Championship cars from 1999 to 2008, 110 trophies, and the original helmets from nine World Champion Drivers: think Villeneuve, Berger, Mansell,Michael Schumacher and Prost. Also visible are numerous other items belonging to the drivers, including gloves, suits and shoes.\n\nGeneric error\n\nAlso a big draw is an authentic reconstruction of the Ferrari Formula One Pit, containing the disassembled parts of the latest model, a control center and radio telemetry unit: a must for those who want to live this rare experience.\n\nYet the surprises don't end there! The sound box reproduces Formula 1 and Gran Turismo (GT) engine noise from the track and road. Meanwhile, another hall houses an exposition of the most recent 8- and 10-cylinder motors, mounted atop the official Scuderia World of Champions 1999-2008 single-seater model. Finally, be sure to check out the reconstruction of Enzo Ferrari's first office in Modena, where in 1929 he began the legendary red Cavallino.\n\nGeneric error\n\nMuseo Casa Enzo Ferrari\n\nAnother important museum is dedicated to the creator of the Ferarri brand, the Museo Casa Enzo Ferrari in Modena. This museum complex was born out of the restoration of the house in which Enzo Ferrari was born in 1898. Indeed, both the house and the workshop have remained unchanged, but what is truly surprising is the construction of a new building with a futuristic design that recalls the \"hood\" of a Ferrari in yellow aluminum, the symbolic color of the city of Modena and, above all, the color chosen by Enzo Ferrari as the background of the \"Cavallino\".\n\nThe main attractions of the exhibition are cars from collections and museums, symbols of the great Italian brands. The cars are surrounded by curved showcases inside which appears a wealth of historical documentation, objects, various mementos and unpublished audio-video contributions.\n\nGeneric error\n\nThen, in the Museum dedicated to Enzo Ferrari could not miss a large exhibition dedicated to the life of this driver and constructor who claimed, \"If you can dream it, you can do it\".\n\nObjects, photos and documents recall his history, through motor sports, places, competitions, and the men who surrounded him: from the Modena Circuit to the Aerautodromo and the Mille Miglia from Scaglietti, Fantuzzi, Stanguellini to Maserati, Pagani, De Tomaso and Alfa Romeo. In the house where he was born, on the other hand, the most significant events of his life are retraced with a permanent multimedia tour. Unique places that strengthen the identity of Emilia Romagna's Motor Valley, which over time has already acquired an international importance and dimension.\n\nGeneric error\n\nSTAY WITH US\n\nContinue living like an Italian\n\nSubscribe to the Newsletter so as not to miss places, events and experiences for experiencing the best side of Italy: the authentic one.\n\nEMAIL\n\nInvalid email address\n\nOps!
