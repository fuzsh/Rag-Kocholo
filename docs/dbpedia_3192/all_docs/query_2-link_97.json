        "text": "Ferrari has furnished its second-quarter earnings reports and it turns out that wealthy people are indeed still buying $500,000 automobiles. However, the report has likewise indicated that the Italian brand will be revising its lineup due to a lack of interest in certain models.\n\nNot among those is the Purosangue SUV. Ferrari said its new utility vehicle (if you can even call it that) has been getting a lot of attention from customers. But other models have been less fortunate. The Ferrari Roma and the 812 Competizione haven’t been getting the same kind of attention as their convertible counterparts. It’s a similar story for the 296 GTS — perhaps indicating that Ferrari customers are more interested in being seen inside the cars than driving them.\n\nAt any rate, it's one of the only brands in existence that still moves a decent number of drop-top automobiles and has been attempting to prioritize them as it looks to revise the lineup. Meanwhile, the company has announced the SF90 Stradale and the 812 GTS are officially leaving the lineup. Despite the 812 still getting decent attention in its convertible format, the model has been around since 2017 (or 2019 if we’re talking about the GTS specifically) and ready to be retired by the manufacturer.\n\nThe SF90 is nearly as old, so the manufacturer is putting it to bed for similar reasons. However, Ferrari does plan on keeping the much-more expensive and raucous SF90 XX (convertible and hardtop) around for a while longer.\n\nWhile the Roma is technically just as old as the SF90, it took the Spider variant several more years to debut. Since convertible Ferraris are selling rather well at present, the company likely isn’t in a rush to dump the model. Its turbocharged, 3.9-liter V8 may produce 612 horsepower and 561 pound-feet of torque, but the Roma remains the most practical of Ferrari products that aren’t labeled Purosangue.\n\nIt likewise retails hundreds of thousands of dollars cheaper than Ferrari’s other GT models while offering some additional seating — giving it room to breathe in the lineup.\n\nMeanwhile, Ferrari’s other GT car — the V12-powered 812 — already has a replacement in the 12Cilindri Coupe and Spider. The newer model may look like an electrified retro throwback of the 365 GTB/4 Daytona. But it’s actually playing host to a naturally aspirated 6.5-liter V12, keeping the recipe very similar to the now-discontinued 812 models.\n\nBeyond that, we’re left guessing at how the brand’s lineup will change.\n\nOdds are good that we’ll see some convertible models sticking around a little longer than their hardtop counterparts. But the Roma seems due more for an update than a complete makeover. We may likewise see it brought back with a new name and updated internals but similar overall formula, similar to what happened with the 812 and 12Cilindri.\n\nWe know that these models aren’t likely to be on your radar for purchase, so you’ll be spared the finer details. But Ferrari is a taste-maker within the industry and worth keeping an eye on. Corporate snobbery aside, the automaker is clearly attempting to host a mixed lineup of vehicles that cater to people with deeper pockets.\n\nLineup tweaks seem rather straightforward and the automaker seems to continue looking toward turbocharging and hybridization, whereas full-on electrification seems to be less of a priority than the past few years’ PR messaging would have indicated. A new halo product, designed to succeed the LaFerrari, is also presently under development.\n\nThe manufacturer made no mention of it during its earnings announcement. But it is supposed to come with a hybrid V6 engine featuring twin turbos, rather than something boasting more cylinders. Spy photographs have shown the vehicle, internally named the F250, looking like it could have been co-developed with Lamborghini or perhaps as a modern tribute to the Bugatti EB 110. However, it’s unclear if this is the result of the heavy camouflaging Ferrari has used during testing or due to the vehicle’s true design. Considering the styling of the 12Cilindri, a retro-inspired design would not be surprising for Ferrari’s next hypercar — potentially replacing the Daytona SP3."
