        "text": "A live social media feed is great for websites and displays\n\nFerrari, the Italian luxury sports car manufacturer based in Maranello, is creating awesome cars and doing a great job producing content for their social media profiles.\n\nThey then reuse all this awesome content in a live social media feed which they embed on various pages on the Ferrari website, or just display during their races. Here’s one we spotted in the Ferrari pit while we were watching TV on a Saturday afternoon.\n\nFerrari is a best practice example for using a live social feed as a way to present and promote the social media content you put so much work into. Their Walls.io social wall was even featured in the latest season of Drive to Survive on Netflix.\n\nAdapt the design of the live social media feed for your brand\n\nWith a social network’s proprietary social feed widget, you’re usually stuck with very few design options, if at all. But a professional social feed can be customized extensively to fit various use cases, brand colors, display options, etc.\n\nFerrari uses the Walls.io Fluid social wall design for their live social media feed embed. They used a simple design to match their website, completely removing the background behind the social media posts.\n\nHere we see the live social media feed embedded on the Corse Clienti microsite:\n\nSelect only the content you want to display\n\nYou fully control the content you’re showing on your embedded website widget. With a social media feed like the one used by Ferrari, you can collect content based on hashtags and keywords from multiple social media channels. Ferrari brings only their Instagram and Twitter brand channels to the social wall, but you can show posts by other people as well, for example, those using your brand hashtag.\n\nYou can also be more specific about which posts to show. Rather than just including your whole feed, you can exclude posts by using filters or keywords. That way, you can adapt your social feed to the page you’re embedding it on.\n\nFerrari is using different live social media feeds relevant to the content of their microsites. For example, they use a different feed on the Formula1 landing page than they do on the Corse Clienti microsite mentioned above.\n\nSame Ferrari site, but a different subpage with a different social wall with different sources:\n\nAlways keep your website fresh\n\nIf you’re already spending time and effort posting to your social channels, why not make it go further? Your brand’s social media content adds a current element to your website. It keeps your website recent and shows that you’re active online and interacting with your customers and fans.\n\nShare the latest news with your visitors\n\nFerrari uses a live social feed on their website to share the latest company news or news about future races with their visitors.\n\nCommunicate during a crisis\n\nFerrari also utilized the live social feed for communicating important company news during the COVID-19 crisis, for example, in the following Instagram posts:\n\nEngage your website visitors\n\nBesides sharing brand and event news, Ferrari uses the live social media feed to engage with their visitors and encourage them to participate in all sorts of activities.\n\nHere are some example posts encouraging visitors to check out the brand’s Instagram stories and ask their favorite drivers questions in the Q&A sessions organized by Ferrari on their Instagram channel.\n\nShare memories your visitors care about\n\nFans will find content focusing on the history of the brand very interesting. Sharing them in your website’s live social media feed will help visitors discover and share this content with their followers."
