        "text": "The “Top Design School Challenge” was established in order to choose the Ferrari design for the future\n\nFerrari is one of the most famous Italian brands, so it is no wonder why the Shanghai Italian Center called its Ferrari exhibition “Mito Ferrari”, or “Ferrari Myth”. The “Ferrari Myth” exhibition was showing the very best of the Ferrari unique cars, including Formula One sport cars and views of the famous Maranello factory.\n\nIn the Piazza Italiana, the center of the Shanghai Italian Center exhibition, I have seen crowds of astonished Chinese people looking at the white wall, showing the Ferrari logo, and two Ferrari cars attached to the wall.\n\nAs an Italian, I grew up together with the Ferrari legend, and I still remember the feeling I had when I was been walking through the famous Ferrari gate in Maranello a few years ago for a business meeting.\n\nBut Ferrari is also thinking about future. Recently, the “Top Design School Challenge” was established in order to choose the Ferrari design for the future. The goal of this year’s edition was to choose the design of the Ferraris of 2040.\n\nThe jury included designers, engineers, drivers and even famous collectors: Nicola Boari, Franco Cimatti, Aldo Colonnetti, Rodolfo Gaffino Rossi, Jay Kay, Flavio Manzoni, Nick Mason, Andrea Militello, Paolo Pininfarina and SebastianVettel.\n\nOn January 15th, 2016, in Maranello, the “Winners of Top Design School” were unveiled.\n\nThe jury members all agreed on the winner of the First Prize: the “Gran PremioAssoluto” was awarded to the Manifesto, an amazing design by six students from the ISD-Rubika at Valenciennes, France: Frenchmen – Michael Barthly, Grimaud Gervex and Jean Baptiste Epinat, and Belgians – Michael Kalyvianakis, Stanislas Oleksiak, and William Stock.\n\nThe jury, “was won over by the completeness of the Manifesto design as well asthe students’ ability to create a coherent overall vision of the car spanning its exterior, cabin and running gear. The spectacular door opening mechanism also highlights the evolution of the interior functions, using future-forward technologies.”\n\nTwo other prizes were also awarded. A special mention was given to the FL project by Roman Egorov, the only design that was devoted to the cabin.\n\nThe jury said that the Russian student from the Hochschule Pforzheim in Germany, “very successfully applied a highly unconventional design language to the car interior, integrating and rethinking the human-machine interface in the process. He also partnered luxury, noble materials rather opting than for the typical carbon-leather combination of today, demonstrating his ability to look well beyond accepted convention”.\n\nFinally, the “Premio Speciale”, decided by an online ballot, was awarded to the de Esfera, the work of three students from Hongik University in Seoul, Korea: Chae wook Lee, Ha kyoung Yeom and Woo jin Jung."
