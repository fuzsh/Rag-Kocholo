        "text": "SANT’AGATA BOLOGNESE, Italy — The boys spilling out of a grade school in an Italian village went silent as the Lamborghini approached, its throaty 12-cylinder engine trumpeting its presence. Then, as the wedge-shaped beast rumbled by the schoolyard, they broke into cheers, pumping their fists and leaping into the air.\n\nIt was a spontaneous expression of the emotion that the Italian sports car maker inspires and that motivates those who can afford it to shell out hundreds of thousands of dollars, in some cases millions, to get one.\n\nBut Lamborghini, Ferrari and a handful of other companies that make so-called supercars — a loosely defined category of vehicles that cost hundreds of thousands of dollars and offer race-car-level performance — face an existential threat. The auto industry is moving inexorably toward battery power, a trend that these carmakers cannot escape. They are now wrestling with how to design electric sports cars that will inspire the same passion and command the same prices.\n\nTesla has already challenged Ferrari’s and Lamborghini’s claims of being at the cutting edge of automotive design. Tesla pioneered electric vehicles, and its Model S Plaid can accelerate to 60 miles per hour in just over two seconds, faster than any Ferrari or Lamborghini, according to testers at Motor Trend.\n\n“For the supercar makers, the question is will they be able to also be super in leading the world in electrification?” said Karl-Thomas Neumann, a former chief executive of the German carmaker Opel who is on the board of OneD Battery Sciences, a California supplier of technology for electric cars.\n\n“If you are just building a supercar and putting a Ferrari logo on it, that’s not enough,” Mr. Neumann said. And the company is “very late” to the electric car game, he added.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
