        "text": "In Italy, time with family and friends isn’t reserved for special occasions. It is a daily priority, often cultivated through aperitivo.\n\nOn the surface, aperitivo is a pre-dinner ritual centered around small bites and a sensible amount of booze. It’s a fabulous excuse to show off your cooking skills with unexpected stuzzichini and wine pairings, or sip casually on a Hugo spritz. But the true meaning runs deeper.\n\nAccording to Stef Ferrari, author of Stuzzichini: The Art of Italian Snack, aperitivo is a routine that can be built into our days, weeks and lives to cultivate community, family and even greater well-being. The practice gives us permission to just be and enjoy the little moments in life—the antithesis of America’s fast-paced, productivity-centered culture.\n\nIn this episode, we talk with Ferrari to better understand what constitutes the “magic” of aperitivo and how to recreate it at home. We discuss why gathering is fundamental to Italian life, how the ritual of aperitivo can help fulfill the basic need and desire to connect with others and how a little bit of alcohol can be part of a healthy, enriched life. Plus, Ferrari shares some of her most memorable aperitivo bites in Italy that fueled the inspiration behind the recipes in her book.\n\nOur Aperitivo Coverage\n\nFrom gear for spritzes and wine to splashes and snacks, here’s how to throw a proper aperitivo hour.\n\nMaster the art of Italian snacking with these aperitivo food recipes.\n\nAperitivo or digestivo? Here’s everything to know about these Italian spirits.\n\nHow to make the Aperol spritz, hero of aperitivo.\n\nIn the “5 Glasses in: Milan,” Writer-at-Large Jeff Porter explains how aperitivo culture means Negroni Sbagliatos and plenty of Franciacorta.\n\nEpisode Transcript\n\nTranscripts are generated using a combination of speech recognition software and human transcribers, and may contain errors.

My name is Samantha Sette, and I’m the senior web producer here at Wine Enthusiast. Today, I have the pleasure to speak with Stef Ferrari, author of the recently published book, Stuzzichini: The Art of Italian Snacking. Stef’s longtime love for Italian food and culture is evident not only through her work as a food and travel writer, filmmaker certified Cicerone and get this reformed ice cream entrepreneur, but also in her ability to tell stories and connect with others. Her new book, Stuzzucchini showcases the art and magic of Italian happy hour through delicious recipes for you to recreate at home. But we can’t help but wonder, are food and drink at the heart of aperitivo? Or is there something more fundamental to Italian culture that is creating what many consider a magical experience? Listen to find out what the US can learn from this ritual and how you can embrace it on your own at home\n\nSamantha Sette 01:09\n\nYou’re invited to a unique opportunity to travel through Italy without ever leaving New York City.

I am so grateful to have you here on the show.\n\nStef Ferrari 02:02\n\nThank you. Thank you so much for having me. I’m really excited.\n\nSamantha Sette 02:06\n\nI would love Well, first off, congratulations on the release of your cookbook, Stuzichini. Can you tell me a little bit more about that for our listeners who aren’t so familiar?\n\nStef Ferrari 02:14\n\nYeah absolutely. So this past spring, the book is called Stuzzichini, the art of the Italian snack. And it is a book that is essentially, you know, I kind of describe it as like a handbook for, like, drinks and snacks. Of course, there’s, there’s more to it than that, if you want to, if you want to dig deeper, but there’s, it’s also, you know, at its very most basic form, instructional guide to, you know, creating snacks and cocktails, both alcoholic and non\n\n02:43\n\nAnd is this? This is not your first rodeo when it comes to cookbooks. Am I correct?\n\nStef Ferrari 02:48\n\nIt is not. I have a couple of books that one in particular is all about ice cream. It’s called Ice Cream adventures. It was based on my experience owning an ice cream shop. I’ve also written a book, co authored with my fellow writer who also did the photography for Stuzzichini, named deepi alualia. And that book is kind of an essay collection about women who changed the world through food throughout history. And there are some recipes in there as well\n\n03:16\n\nVery cool. And stuzzichini, what? What is stuzzichini?\n\nStef Ferrari 03:21\n\nGood question, and you’re pronouncing it very well, which is impressive, because that is usually the first question, I guess. How do you say this? And we did go back and forth about whether or not to actually name the book stuzzichini because of because of that. But I think it’s a fun word, and I I think it feels to me like what it is like the word stucco in Italian to tease and Stuzzichidente which is a toothpick. So it’s sort of a cross between those words and the word stuzzichini refers to the spread of snacks that you often get when you order an aperitivo in Italy. So if you go and order a spritzer and a groti in the before dinner hour, which is, you know, usually around, like seven to nine, something like that. They will often bring you a spread of on the house snacks. And that can be anything from peanuts and popcorn to, like, really super composed, delicate, beautiful bites that are, you know, something that I think we would easily imagine paying, you know, $20 for here in states. So it’s the food that the snacks that go along with your drinks, basically,\n\n04:30\n\nI see so aperitvo, which is, as you mentioned, this Italian happy hour. Yeah, that the food is the stuzzichini, those are the snacks, and then the drinks are part of it. And there’s a whole there’s a whole culture around aperitivo in Italy\n\nStef Ferrari 04:44\n\nYes, exactly, exactly the appetitivo word. The word appetitivo has, I think, often been used really, to just describe the drinks here in the US. But in Italy, it’s much more of a ritual and a full custom than. Us to drink.\n\n05:01\n\nInteresting so I feel like we have this very literal definition, right, the food and drink aspect of what people in Italy and through the culture enjoy before dinner. But then there’s this cultural significance. I would love to hear a little bit more about that and how you think aperitivo is part of Italian culture. What does it mean for them?\n\nStef Ferrari 05:21\n\nYeah, it’s funny. I actually interviewed a couple dozen people for the book about exactly that, and it was in the book at one point, it didn’t make the cut as many things tend to end up on the cutting room floor during this process. But I essentially asked everyone, what is aperitivo to you? What does that mean? And the answers were varied. I asked a lot of people, younger people, some older generations, and while the answer was a little bit, there were some nuance to it. Mostly it was about this idea of a transition period between, you know, your work day and your your time with your people, your your family, your friends, your community, and the in between, between, you know, your workday and dinner that has changed a little bit over the years, where a lot of people now are just having that aperitivo for dinner, and they, you know that, that there is also a word for that. It’s apericena, which is a conflation of a aperitivo and cena. And so, you know, it’s, it’s very much like that moment of the day when you start to relax, when you can exhale and sit down and order a drink and have a snack. And, you know, you’re not quite ready to dive into dinner yet. Part of the purpose of a penitivo in general is to elongate that process of your evening. You know, it’s not just, oh, I’m done with work. Let’s have dinner, you know, let’s get, let’s get the day done. It is an extension of that and sort of prelude to your meal, if, in fact, you’re going to go forward with that. But it’s a it’s a moment to connect with, with the people in your life and to and to start to relax and take a breath.\n\n07:04\n\nAnd you know that that last part that you just mentioned, the other people, is what I find so admirable about this practice, if you will. It’s that in Italy and through this culture, we value being around other people. I just feel like a little bit more. I’ve just noticed that there’s this individualistic mindset around how we drink in the States and how we gather in the States, and it’s almost just reserved for weekends. But this seems like, you know, it’s not just for special occasions, right?\n\nStef Ferrari 07:34\n\nAbsolutely, it’s, it’s, um, it’s very much a daily thing for a lot of people, and it is extremely focused on community and connection. And I think you’re right. I think that, you know, culturally speaking, the US is, is tends to be an individualistic kind of society. I think we see that in a lot of ways. But in Italy, the idea of being able to, you know, disconnect and connect with with real people and the people in your life is very much a part of a part of the culture. This is really where a pedottivo came from, was the need and desire to connect with others. So, you know, one of the things that I thought was fascinating about the research that I did for this book was that I started to speak with, again, sort of a broad range of people from different demographics and age groups, and ask them about a petite but where did it come from? How did it start? And I expected, like most things, that I think there is a perception that when something is Italian, it’s been ingrained in the culture for centuries. You know, they’ve been doing it forever, the the hundreds and hundreds of years, 1000 years, they’ve been making the same pasta, the same wife, you know, and and there’s a lot of pride in that, and that’s very real. But when I started talking to people about the custom of aperitivo , what I learned, especially from older generations, was that this is something that is relatively new, and by which I mean, you know, the last 20 years or so, which to me, felt, felt very surprising. I I spoke with a professor that I had when I studied in Florence for a year while I was there, and she told me that when she was growing up, the idea of a pedotivo only really applied to men, and it was men having a glass of Vermouth before, you know, well, the women made dinner, and that was pretty much it, and that was usually at home. What has changed and developed over the last couple of decades, though, is that the economy of Italy has changed dramatically, and many young people are migrating to larger cities in search of work in in doing so, they’re leaving behind their families of origin, and they’re the people that they, you know, are closest to in a lot of ways. And so they wind up in a new city that is hours from home or longer, perhaps, and they don’t have, you know, they get they get done with work, and they’re not going home to their parents who are going to make them dinner. They’re in search of community. And so they’ve started. You know, they started gathering at these bars where they would go and have aperitivo and connect with other people and start to develop their own sort of community and built family and in the course of that. The other thing is that stucchini in particular is a linchpin of that concept, because these are complimentary snacks. These are young people who are maybe just starting out in their lives, and don’t have tons of disposable income for a big, you know, pricey dinner at a more formal restaurant, and so they would go and have these snacks and eventually just sort of string it out, and you’re enjoying, you know, some bites and some drinks with other people. And it just has become much more of a of a ritual. And then I think tourists started to enjoy this and take note of it, and has really become that’s when we really started to see, you know, the Negroni sort of explode and the spritz explode. And of course, internet and social media has been part of that. So yeah, I could kind of ramble on about that for a long time, but the confluence of backers that has created an environment and in which this ritual has become popular is really interesting to me,\n\nSamantha Sette 09:18\n\nFor good reason. I’m I had no idea that aperitivo is a fairly new concept, which I mean, this might be a bold statement, but it feels like a solution to, you know, Western values, right? Kind of conflict with what has been historically, Italian values in that culture. And this seems like a solution, as the generation starts to shift, this practice is kind of keeping the Italian culture grounded in a way which I find really beautiful. I wish there were more opportunities for that in the States.\n\nStef Ferrari 11:40\n\nYeah, that’s, I mean, that’s a really interesting point and a great way to look at it. I mean, I think, you know, the idea of family is something that is fluid, especially here in the US. And I think we’ve, we’ve started to understand that family can mean a lot of different things. And I think that that is, you know, whether you call it family or community, or however you describe it, I think that that’s that is something that has shifted a little bit because of, because of the dynamics in Italy now, and it’s starting to become a little bit more clear that, you know, you can, you can’t. You can find your people outside of the home. And you kind of have to, we’re social animals, you know, we we want to be with people. And that really is like, that was the the impetus for making this book, is I just love, I love that I, you know, for me, my whole life, my whole career, has always been about community and building community. And I think there are a lot of people who want to host or want to gather with friends, and it kind of becomes like one of these things where it’s like, oh my God, I don’t, I don’t know. I don’t know how to do this. It’s hard, it’s expensive, it’s, you know, it’s prohibitive for whatever reason, whether that’s time or money or just a fear of, you know, being able to put together enjoyable food. And, you know, stuzzichini are intended, they’re created by these bars and restaurants to be really, like, budget friendly, both from a financial and and time perspective, they are complimentary, so they can’t really cost or take a ton of time for these restaurants. So the idea of translating that into the home and being like, you can have a gathering and have it be pretty, you know, affordable and and simple to put together, and the whole point is to not interrupt the flow of conversation, to not interrupt the hang and be able to, just like, make sure that people feel good. Because the other thing is, you know, in Italy, it is very, you know, the word taboo came up a couple of times in my interview process. It is a quote, unquote taboo to be, you know, drinking and to be drunk, period. And so you don’t really drink without food. You don’t want to be drunk, and you also don’t feel good. I mean, that’s that’s a big part of it is, if you’re hosting someone, you want them to feel good when they’re in your care, in your company. And so you want, if you’re going to give them alcohol, they should also have food. That’s just the belief that just, you just don’t do one without, you know, you don’t do the drink without some kind of food to help you process it.\n\n14:09\n\nYeah, and it’s healthy too, right? I think there’s a lot of talk with that word. You know, it’s such a difficult turn throughout, like, is drinking healthy? How do we drink healthfully? But it’s also, like, when you put it in the picture, it’s not about the alcohol, it’s not about the food, it’s about the gathering. And when you remove that excess portion away from it, when it is taboo, it’s almost like you gain more than people realize. And I think that that can have such a profound effect on people’s well being,\n\nStef Ferrari 14:39\n\nDefinitely. I mean, you know, I think I’ve seen this a lot, where I will be at someone’s home and they’re kind of topping up your glass with wine or whatever, and that’s a really nice way to express generosity. But I had a conversation with someone in Italy, and he was essentially saying that, if you get your guest. Drunk, and they go home the next day, they’re going to be like, I don’t feel good. I don’t want to go back there, you know? And so the idea that you also provide them water, you also provide them food, and that when they look back and reflect on their time with you, it’s with a positive association that they feel good, that they felt cared for, that they don’t, you know, they didn’t leave feeling like they were going to be sick or that they were so hungry and and so I think that that’s just, it’s just a nice part of it. The other thing is, I am encouraged that there’s a, there’s more of this culture here now. But when I was living in Italy, I really because it’s a daily thing. Sometimes I didn’t want the alcohol. And there’s always a really nice, non alcoholic option. And no one ever makes you feel like you’re ordering something that’s less than I love the little bitter red Italian soda. It’s called San Victor is one, one of the brands, and they still breed to you with an orange peel on the rocks, and they’ll still bring you stitkini. It’s not as if, oh, you know, you you aren’t really participating. You can still very much be part of the ritual without actually consuming alcohol.\n\nSamantha Sette 16:06\n\nIt’s accessible, not just in price. And I love that you made that point too, because we are seeing it become more common that people don’t always want to drink, and for good reason. You know, sometimes we just we have things the next day, or you don’t even need to justify it. But I like, I like how it’s so inviting, both, again, budget friendly, and it’s a ritual. I like that you use that word as well because it can, it’s repeatable, and there are very few things I feel like, beyond work and sleep and stuff that are repeatable and actually serve us in a positive way.\n\nStef Ferrari 16:37\n\nYes, totally, and it is. It’s something that I miss here. I think we are definitely adopting it a little bit more. I think you can you see many more places doing things like this, and there’s happy hour, and we have our we have our stuff here, but there’s just something really that feels really like luxurious and discomforting about aperitivo and that magic hour, which is what, you know, I think deepi, the my photographer on this book did such a great job of capturing with the photos. It’s just that moment of, you know, the lights coming on and the sounds of the Piazza and the crowds around you and the clinking glasses, and it’s just a really, it is really romantic sort of process that I think it sort of feeds your soul. And if you get to do that a little bit every day, that’s a beautiful thing.\n\nSamantha Sette 17:27\n\nYeah, what do you think is at the heart of that magic?\n\nStef Ferrari 17:31\n\nHm, good question. I mean, I think we, I say we. I should speak for myself, but I have a hard time relaxing. I have a hard time turning it off. I have a hard time, you know, we’re a productivity culture that’s just, that’s just who we are. And so I think to be at a moment in the day where the only thing that’s expected of you is to listen to the people that you’re with and to, you know, commune with them and talk with them and take care of yourself with food and drink. And I think that’s, that’s the magic, you know, it’s, it’s like the permission to just be and enjoy yourself for a few minutes. Yeah, I mean, we really tried to capture that with the book to this sort of multi sensory part of a pedottivo, because you have your food and drinks, you have the, you know, sights and smells. And I was thinking about it when I was at a bar in Italy, and I was like, what is it about this that that makes it so magic, and what can we capture, and how can we translate this in the book? And one of the things that I love is that moment when the lights come on, and especially in the cities in Italy, there’s a lot of there are a lot of neon signs, and most of them say bar restaurant or gelateria, or whatever, whatever it is that the place sells and deals in, is usually what the sign says. And those are so iconic, and they are such a part of the the whole experience. And so I wound up interviewing a neon Bender, a fourth generation neon bender, in Rome for the book to kind of understand, like, how that all ties in. And it turns out there’s, like, this really interesting parallel history of aperitivo drinks with neon. In fact, one of the first neon signs ever commercially used was for an Italian verbose so you know, there’s a lot to it. And can you recreate all that hall at home? No, you don’t probably have that on site, but you can, you know, take, take cues and, and just try to create an atmosphere in which people don’t feel, you know, rushed or or like it’s, it’s got to end soon.\n\nSamantha Sette 19:42\n\nYeah, and what you’re describing also sounds like presence, because when you start to awaken your senses, right? You have the food, you have the taste. You are tasting things, you hear things, you see things. That awakening of the senses, I feel like brings not only joy, but just so much grounding in the present moment with. Yeah, you know, you alluded to this too. We have such busy, productive lives that there are so few opportunities for us to kind of like, breathe and just be, which is so underrated. I wish more people talked about it.\n\nStef Ferrari 20:14\n\nYeah, I love that. And I think the presence thing is so critical when you are building community, you know, to just be able to be with the people that you’re you know, you’re with, and listen to them and have conversations, and not be checking your phone or your watch or wondering where you have to be, because this is the hour that every day, everyone’s going to do this. And that’s really freeing. I love what you’re saying about awakening the sentence, because I think we don’t always engage fully all around and and when you do, I think that’s when you really get a chance to to open yourself up to that, that bit of joy that you get with with something like this\n\nSamantha Sette 20:52\n\nTotally and the food and the snacks feel like this vehicle, this medium To to achieve that state of mind and being\n\nStef Ferrari 21:02\n\nDefinitely and I, you know, for me, I think the I look I love junk food. I really do. I’m going on the record. I love gummy bears, so we’ll put that out there. But\n\nSamantha Sette 21:13\n\nI’m a sweet treat every day,\n\nStef Ferrari 21:16\n\nAs you should\n\nSamantha Sette 21:17\n\nExactly.\n\nStef Ferrari 21:18\n\nBut the beauty of a lot of this food is, it’s so simple, and there are only a few ingredients often, and so you really do get to marvel at some of this stuff too, where you’re just like, I never knew a peach could taste like this. Or I never tasted this honey this way before. I never knew that this spice would be complimentary to this fish or something like that, and, and I think that, again, in the busyness culture, where you just, like consume, and we put things away, and we don’t even really, you know, think about what they are, how magical that is, or how marvelous those things really are. And I love that, I can tell you, know, very frequently during, during these evenings, everyone at the table stops to sort of like, say, Wow, this is really incredible. Or, Wow, did you taste this? Or, you know, and I just, I really love that, because I think there’s so much that goes into the creation of food, the pairing of flavors, the nuance and intuition in Italian food is so remarkable to me. I mean, the amount of times that I’ve seen something on a menu and go and thought, That’s odd. I don’t know about that, and then tasted it and been like, Oh no, this is amazing. Like, wow, I can’t believe no one else is doing this. Like, it’s, it’s, it’s just really balanced and intuitive. And I don’t think you always pick up those nuances if you’re not fully present.\n\nSamantha Sette 22:49\n\nTotally and I’d love to hear what were, you know, it was one of the most unique aperitivo experiences you had while you were living in Italy.\n\nStef Ferrari 22:58\n\nYeah. I mean, the one that comes to mind immediately is I was in Sicily at a restaurant, and we were doing a little aperitivo prior to and the drink itself was made with an amaro from Sicily, a bitter orange Amaro, and they paired it with these little bites that were they were crackers. They were like a wheat cracker. And on the cracker was a local soft cheese, like a ricotta and orange zest, an anchovy filet and grated Modica chocolate. And it was one of the best things I’ve ever tasted. It makes such sense when you actually break it down, it doesn’t sound like it, but you have, you know, you have this bitter chocolate and the creamy cheese and the aromatic orange and the briny, salty fish, and then you have this, you know, sort of like neutral grain cracker that has a little bit of sweetness to it. I could not believe it, like it was just, just one of those things that I was like, wow, this is incredible. And again, that sort of intuitive, intuitiveness of using what is local so that chocolate was made in the area the anchovies were, you know, everything that was, they always say, like, what grows together goes together. And because Italians don’t, in Italy, don’t typically look too far beyond for ingredients, they tend to use what’s around, and that might mean putting things together that you might not otherwise consider. But when you, when you do it, it does make sense. So that that that’s one of the ones that I, I love to pull that out and, like, kind of blow people’s minds.\n\nSamantha Sette 24:37\n\nOh yeah, the way you described it, too, at first, I was like, I don’t know, how I’m thinking about that, but it sounds, it sounds like it gives you a sense of place, a terror with food, I always pronounce that word wrong, but yeah, as if it were wine, right? It gives you a sense of place, and that could be achieved through food and through stuzzichini as well.\n\nStef Ferrari 24:55\n\n100% and I think one of the really cool things about stuttuckini is exactly. That, which is a very low risk way to try new foods. You’re not gonna buy a huge meal that’s, you know, gonna cost you a lot of money that you’re not totally sure you’re sold on. You get to take a little bite. And it’s also often made with whatever is local to the place. So, you know, in the north of Italy and the Dolomites, you might find a stuzzichini with speck or, you know, like a smoked prosciutto-ish meat. Or, you know, in Sicily, you might find something that’s a little bit more representative of the sort of Mediterranean and North African influence that you find so often in that part of the country, and everything is just really hyper regional, very seasonal, and so you get to taste the place and in that moment, and it’s so ephemeral, you know, you you may go to the same bar tomorrow, and it will be a completely different spread of snacks. That’s it’s not on the menu. It’s just whatever they have at that moment, whatever they can, you know, kind of put together. So I think that that’s, that’s a really, really fun way to engage with with a place.\n\nSamantha Sette 26:10\n\nYeah, this is honestly inspiring me to think, you know, where am I regionally, and how can I recreate this? Because for our listeners, you know, depending on where you are locally, this can be applied to New York, to any, any you know, wherever you are, and what’s local there. And so it’s, it’s interesting and exciting to think that this isn’t limited just to Italy, right\n\nStef Ferrari 26:31\n\nDefinitely. And that was something that I really wanted to also drive home with the book, which is that these are like a framework, and if you don’t have this particular ingredient, you don’t have to import it from Italy. You can use whatever it is that’s local to you. And so I did try to include some some suggestions. You know, if you are in the south and you don’t have hazelnuts, you might have pecans, and they’ll they’ll work, you know, it, it is an expression of of where you are. But these are just a framework and their starting points and their ideas. And I really do hope people don’t just adhere to, like, the letter of the book, but more the spirit and, you know, putting things together. In fact, we I got a couple of notes on on certain recipes that were like, is this a recipe? And it’s like, Nah, not really. I mean, it’s, it’s just sort of like, it’s a guideline, it’s ideas, there’s a, there’s a, I don’t hesitate to even call it a recipe, but there’s a dish in here, in the book, that is seasonal fruit with, you know, it’s a crostini, basically, recipe for a seasonal fruit and proto and honey. And I believe that the the book uses crushed hazelnuts. But again, this is like, is it peaches? Is it pigs? Are we using plums? Are we using berries? You can do whatever you want. If you want to use a ricotta, you can, if you want to use a goat cheese, you can. It’s just use what, whatever you think highlights what you’ve got. And if you don’t have basil, use mint. And if you don’t have, you know it’s, it’s meant to be really forgiving that way. You don’t have to sort of bend over backwards and go out with a shopping list and, like, check the boxes. Just kind of take from the spirit of it.\n\nSamantha Sette 28:10\n\nI love that, there’s a lot more nuance to cooking than I think people sometimes realize. And with that aperitivo, of course, it’s different and it’s fun.\n\nStef Ferrari 28:21\n\nYeah, yeah. That’s the hope I, you know, I think the, you know, one of the things that I really love, just in general, I think about Italian culture, and at least, again, these are all such broad generalizations, but I have found there’s a lot of like, there’s a lack of self seriousness in certain ways, like there’s a lot of pride, certainly, and and there’s a lot of appreciation and respect for the food, but I think there’s a little, there’s a playfulness about it that I really like, and that really spoke to me when I was there. Because I think we get, we get to a point where everything feels very serious, and especially, you know, I’ve worked in food for 20 years, more or less, and I have worked in some very self serious environments. If anybody watch, watches the bear that comes to mind. You know, I love the show, but there’s, there’s something about it where I kind of, I kind of bristle sometimes, and I’m like, can’t we just like, have fun with it. You know, if it tastes good, it tastes good, and it doesn’t have to be exactly perfect. And, you know, same goes for the drinks. I am not a mixologist. I certainly don’t claim to have, like, a deep background in creating drinks, but I think when I have guests, I think it’s really fun for to play with those drinks a little bit. And that’s another thing that the book has a lot of suggestions on how to, like modify some of these classic drinks. And the beauty of a pedotinmo drinks, especially like the Negroni, for example, you have three ingredients, but within those three ingredients, you can do so much, and you don’t have to be a skilled bartender to do that like to swap gin for tequila, or, you know, swap the kind of remove that you’re using, or or infuse it with coconut or something like it’s there’s a million ways to play within that framework that don’t have to push you too far out of your comfort zone. And I think that that’s really fun.\n\nSamantha Sette 30:17\n\nAnd to break the third wall a little bit your playfulness, just it reverberates through the microphone, right? Like it’s infectious and definitely very refreshing to think about, especially in a place that can be very serious, right? We talk about food and wine sometimes in a very stuffy way, but it’s fun, and it’s about connecting with others and sharing stories.\n\nStef Ferrari 30:37\n\nTotally. I, you know, I the sharing stories, I think it’s such a big part of it for me, I, like my absolute favorite thing to do in life is just have conversations with people. And, you know, I just, I the food and drink is meant to facilitate that. Like we just, we just want to have fun with the people that we care about. And so, you know, I think I’ve seen a lot of people get really stressed out about making food for other people, and I overwhelmingly find that people are just so appreciative. I have a lot of friends that are like professional chefs, and they come over, and, of course, I’m always intimidated, you know, to cook for them, and they’re like, Do you know the last person that cooked for me? You know, they just, there’s just an appreciation when someone does something for you, whether that’s like a really, you know, beautifully composed thing, or just like some crostini with with fresh fruit, it’s fun,\n\nSamantha Sette 31:28\n\nAgreed entirely. And you know, what advice would you give to someone who resonates with these values? How? How can they go about really leaning into the spirit of stuzzichini and Aperitivo?\n\nStef Ferrari 31:41\n\nI am a creature of habit, and I do believe that repetition, which creates ritual, also creates a sense of comfort and approachability. And not everybody’s life is set up that way to be able to do things like on a regular basis, but one of the things that I really like to do is is have like, standing dates with groups of friends, you know, every third Sunday or every third Tuesday, we’re, we’re going to do this, and maybe you can come, and maybe you can’t, and that’s okay, and we’ll see you next month if you can. But I think it’s, it’s a nice thing to look forward to. It’s, it’s reliable. Everybody sort of, I think, gets accustomed to the like, you know, the way that things run, and so they know what to bring, and they know how it’s going to play out. And I just think a sense of consistency is really nice. So if you can do that, if you’re fortunate enough that your people live around you, I’m also, like, a big believer in neighborhood and community. And so, you know, open the doors and and try to to get to the know the people around you, because I have a lot of friends and family, sort of scattered around the country and the world, and I wish that I could spend more time with them, but I, you know, I had an appetitivo up on the roof with my landlords recently, and that was such a nice thing. It was a nice way to get to know them a little bit. And the other thing I will say, from like, a more practical standpoint, is that a lot of these things can be made like, sort of on your own time and stored until the moment comes. I grew up in a in a world where, like, we had company, you know, quote, unquote, I’m using scare quotes here, but you would have the things that were like, in the freezer or in the fridge that were for company, and those people might just drop by, and then you are ready. And so I like to have some of that stuff. Like, I’m looking right now at the book, and there’s, um, there are, like, some compound butters and stuff like that that you can make when you are, I don’t know, listening to a podcast, for example, and and put that in the fridge. And then when people come over, if you have crackers and some, like, compound cool, compound butter with like, you know, orange zest and vanilla like, that’s impressive and fun. Anchovies are you grab them out of the fridge and they’re good to go. So having those like, little things that make it it’ll take you five minutes to put something like, like that together, and it still feels ceremonious. And same goes for cocktails. I like to batch cocktails in advance, so that you know, you sort of have them in the freezer door or the fridge door. And if anybody pops by, or you are just feeling like tonight’s the night, and you don’t want to worry about making plans in the future, which I think sometimes people get a little like pressured by you have it, you have it ready to go, and it’s just like, not a big deal.\n\nSamantha Sette 34:20\n\nYeah. And before we start wrapping up, I have some rapid fire questions which kind of relate to everything you just talked about, if you are ready to get into it. So what’s the favorite recipe from your book?\n\nStef Ferrari 34:36\n\nAgain, it’s hard to call it a recipe, but anchovy toast. Anchovy toast, which is very a lot of these recipes are regional and specific to particular regions, but you will find anchovitos in a lot of places, in Italy, and it really is as simple as it sounds. It is a nice piece of bread, a thick slab of butter, be generous, a filet or two of anchovies and. If you’ve got it lemon zest and it’s it’s perfect. It totally balanced.\n\nSamantha Sette 35:04\n\nI love it. What’s your favorite place you’ve traveled to? And that could be in Italy or beyond.\n\nStef Ferrari 35:10\n\nOh gosh, I really love some of the regions that I think are a little bit overlooked, or at least less associated with Italian travel, like northern parts of northern Italy. The Dolomites are absolutely stunning. And, you know, the mountains are just spectacular. I loved frioli Venezia Giulia, which is a northern region that has a lot of like Austrian and Hungarian influence, and the food is so different than anything you might consider to be Italian. There are some coastal cities in central Italy, masa and liborno that I really love, chicially. Yeah, I could go on, and that’s just Italy, but whole other podcast totally.\n\nSamantha Sette 35:54\n\nWhat’s your favorite place in the US for aperitivo or stuzzichini.\n\nStef Ferrari 35:59\n\nAside from a friend’s backyard. Um, that’s a great answer, at least right now, that’s what I’m thinking about. Is height of summer. But yeah, I think I The beauty is that as the practice, sort of spreads a lot of bars now do something like this, and certainly you can get a Negroni or a spritz almost anywhere now, and I’m very much a regular person, like I have my regular spots, I rarely venture beyond the like, you know, four blocks of my immediate neighborhood. So I think, to me, the best place for anybody, if not a friend’s house, is, you know, your local bar, supporting your local your local establishments, the people that are the foundation of your community. That, to me, is like the best, the best version of it.\n\nSamantha Sette 36:47\n\nI love that. What’s your favorite ice cream flavor?\n\nStef Ferrari 36:51\n\nOof, oh, man, you’re hitting me hard in the US. I tend to go for almost anything that has peanut butter or citrus. I love, like orange creamsicle lemon flavors, which are rare. But in Italy, if I’m gonna try a new place for gelato, it has to start with either hazelnut or pistachio. That is like the baseline to me. And how you know if a place is is doing it right,\n\nSamantha Sette 37:19\n\nAmazing. And last but not least, we try to ask all of our guests about this question, and that is, what’s in your glass, a drink you’ve been loving lately.\n\nStef Ferrari 37:28\n\nA Milano Torino is is just like it is my perfect drink I used to love in Manhattan. I unfortunately do not process alcohol quite as well as I once did. And a Milano same for Negroni. And a Milano Torino is essentially a Negroni without the gin. It’s equal parts Campari or a similar red bitter. I happen to really be a big fan of Santa grass this year in Brooklyn and a sweet. And I love it so much. It is, to me, the perfect before dinner drink. I keep a bottle of it always in my fridge. And I also like to, like, infuse it with different things. I mentioned coconut earlier. I’ve been toasting coconut and infusing that into a bottled Milano Torino lately that is perfect, amazing.\n\n38:10\n\nAnd before we head off, do you have any final words for our listeners today?\n\nStef Ferrari 38:15\n\nUm, I aside from, thank you. I think my feeling always is just like, get your people together, go, go, spend time with your people and and more and in a less planned way, and just try to be, be present for them.\n\nSamantha Sette 38:37\n\nI love that. And where can our listeners find you if you want to give yourself a plug?\n\nStef Ferrari 38:40\n\nYeah I’m on Instagram @sl.ferrari, and I also have a sub stack that is not particular to stuzzichini, but it is like, there’s usually a recipe involved. It’s a little bit of a pop culture kind of, kind of Roundup, but it also will have some some travel bits and stories from my time in Italy,\n\nSamantha Sette 39:03\n\nAwesome. Well, Steph, expression of gratitude. Thank you so much again for taking the time to chat today. I really enjoyed our conversation, and I’m excited for listeners to hopefully enjoy the magic aperitivo and Suzuki themselves. Thank\n\nStef Ferrari 39:17\n\nyou so much.
