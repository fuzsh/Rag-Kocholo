        "text": "As I wrote yesterday in my recap of the qualifying at the USTA women's Pro Circuit W75 in Rome Georgia, 15-year-old Elizabeth Ionescu had qualified for the main draw in her previous two appearances on the Pro Circuit, but she lost in the first round of both the W25 last summer in Colorado and at the W15 last fall in Tennessee. She emphatically broke that pattern today in the first round of main draw action, beating No. 3 seed and WTA 164 Ann Li 6-0, 6-3 in an hour and 20 minutes. Ionescu, who has no WTA ranking, will earn one now with the 13 points she's earned so far; she will face another teenager, 2022 Wimbledon girls champion Liv Hovde, for a spot in the quarterfinals. Hovde defeated qualifier Dalayna Hewitt 7-5, 6-4 in the first round today. Ionescu, as you can see below in the UTR PTT results, is also playing with a lot of confidence and match play now.\n\nFormer USC All-American Madison Sieg, using an accelerator program spot for entry, defeated Gabriela Lee(Texas Tech) of Romania, last week's finalist in Vero Beach, 3-6, 6-4, 6-4 in three hours and nine minutes.\n\nDespite last week's Kickoff Weekend, which featured all the top teams, this week's coaches poll for the Division I team rankings changed very little. The Top 10 from last week all won their regionals as hosts and will appear next month at the Women's Team Indoor Championships in Seattle. One notable move in the Top 25 saw Cal going from 19 to 15 after winning the Oklahoma regional in Norman; UCLA[13] is the one team in the Top 15 not going to the Indoors; No. 16 USC, who won the Tennessee regional, is in. Top 25 rankings can be found by clicking on the headings\n\nWomen's Division I Team Rankings Top Ten January 31, 2024\n\nBrackets number of 1st place votes; parentheses previous rankings:\n\n1. North Carolina[13](1)\n\n2. Stanford(2)\n\n3. Oklahoma State(3)\n\n4. Georgia(4)\n\n5. Michigan(5)\n\n6. Pepperdine(6)\n\n7. NC State(7)\n\n8. Florida(8)\n\n9. Texas A&M(9)\n\n10. Texas(10)\n\nThe men's rankings did shuffle a bit due to Kickoff Weekend losses. Kentucky, who lost as a host to Alabama, fell out of the Top 10, going from 10 to 16; Stanford, who lost on the road to Michigan, went from 9 to 15. Columbia and Arizona took their places in the Top 10. Ohio State has consolidated its top spot, picking up five more first place votes than they had last week.\n\nMen's Division I Team Rankings Top Ten January 31, 2024\n\n1. Ohio State[11](1)\n\n2. South Carolina[2](2)\n\n3. Virginia(3)\n\n4. Texas(4)\n\n5. TCU(5)\n\n6. Tennessee(6)\n\n7. Southern Cal(7)\n\n8. Duke(8)\n\n9. Columbia(11)\n\n10. Arizona(13)\n\nFor comparison, here is the Cracked Racquets Top 10 for women (I am serving as a voter). Their men's Top 10 should be out Thursday.\n\nIn just two and a half days of play at the ITF J300 in Barranquilla Colombia, upsets have occurred. Top seed Katie Rolls lost in the second round, her first match of the tournament, to fellow 16-year-old Greta Patrillo of Italy 7-5, 6-4. Patrillo advanced to Thursday's quarterfinals with a 6-3, 1-6, 6-2 win over Capucine Jauffret. She will play her third straight American in the quarterfinals, taking on No. 12 seed Thea Frodin. Last week's Costa Rica J300 champion Shannon Lam, the No. 8 seed this week, lost to No. 9 seed Dune Vaissaud of France 6-2, 7-6(6) in today's round of 16. In addition to Frodin, the other three US girls in the quarterfinals are No. 2 seed Christasha McNeil, No. 3 seed Claire An and No. 4 seed Monika Ekstrand.\n\nCosta Rica champion Ian Mayew is through to the boys quarterfinals, as is No. 12 seed Kase Schinnerer, but the results of the rest of the boys round of 16 matches have not yet been posted, with matches going late into the evening.\n\nI'm going to try to post the UTR Pro Tennis Tour results on a more frequent schedule than I have done. Below are the January results.\n\nMEN:\n\nJanuary 1 Long Beach CA\n\nKarue Sell d. Strong Kirchheimer 6-1, 6-4\n\nJanuary 7 Winston Salem NC\n\nTheodore Dean d. Filippo Moroni 6-3, 6-1\n\nJanuary 14 Bonita Springs FL\n\nMateusz Terczynski d. Nicholas Buitrago 6-7(4), 6-4, 6-3\n\nJanuary 15 Fort Worth TX\n\nLui Maxted d. Duncan Chan 7-6(4), 7-5\n\nWOMEN:\n\nDecember 31 Boca Raton FL\n\nAkasha Urhobo d. Carol Lee 4-6, 6-3, 6-2\n\nJanuary 8 Long Beach CA\n\nBrandy Walker d. Elina Nepliy 6-2, 6-7(1), 6-2\n\nJanuary 21 Atlanta GA\n\nElizabeth Ionescu d. Ariana Pursoo 4-6, 6-4, 3-0, ret.\n\nWith all my attention last week on the Australian Open Juniors, the Coffee Bowl J300 and Les Petits As, I wasn't able to follow the lower level events, so I'll try to catch up on some of those today.\n\nThirteen-year-old Christina Lyutova, who lives in the US but plays for Russia, extended her 2024 winning streak to ten matches, following her title at the ITF J30 in Claremont two weeks ago with another title at the J30 in San Diego last week. Lyutova, who won three consecutive J60 tournaments at the end of 2023, had her ITF Junior Circuit streak snapped in the qualifying at the Eddie Herr J300, but she is back to her straight-sets march through the draws in Southern California. Seeded No. 1 in San Diego, she defeated unseeded Emily Deming 6-2, 6-3 in the final for her fifth ITF Junior Circuit title and has added another win at this week's J30 in San Diego, where she is the No. 2 seed.\n\nNo. 7 seed Mario Garcia won his first ITF Junior Circuit single title, with the 17-year-old from San Diego defeating No. 5 seed Alexander Baez of Paraguay 7-5, 6-4 in the final.\n\nNo. 2 seeds Andre Alcantara and Ian Bracks won the boys doubles championship, defeating unseeded Liam Alvarez and Micah Ward 7-6(11), 3-6, 12-10 in the final.\n\nUnseeded Sydney Barnhart and Alexandra Wolf took the girls doubles title, beating unseeded Kara Garcia and Shaya Jovanovic 7-5, 6-2 in the championship match.\n\nJoining Lyutova as a two-time J30 champion this month is Agassi Rusher, who won back-to-back events in Uruguay. The unseeded 15-year-old from Florida won his first career ITF Junior Circuit title two weeks ago by beating top seed Bruno Loch Varella of Brazil 7-5, 6-4 in the final; last week he defeated No. 4 seed Pedro Albuquerque Dietrich of Brazil 6-1, 6-2 in the championship match.\n\nSeventeen-year-old Dillon Beckles of Texas claimed the title last week at the J60 in South Africa, with the No. 5 seed defeating No. 3 seed Guy Vorwerk of South Africa 6-2, 6-2 for his third career ITF Junior Circuit singles title.\n\nSixteen-year-old qualifier Nicole Weng of California won the J30 in Singapore last week, capturing her first ITF Junior Circuit title with a 6-3, 6-3 victory over Jiyun Oh of Korea.\n\nWhile most of the Americans who participated in the Australian swing are taking the week off, boys Australian Open doubles champion Cooper Woestendick is back in action at the ITF J300 in Barranquilla Colombia this week, where he is the No. 2 seed.\n\nAs was the case last week, the draws in Colombia have a large contingent of Americans, including Costa Rica champions and finalists Shannon Lam, Kristina Penickova, Ian Mayew and Matisse Farzam. Unlike Costa Rica, this week's draw is 48, not 32. The seeds are below, with a list of the other Americans competing this week in Colombia also included.\n\nGirls seeds\n\n1. Kaitlyn Rolls(USA)\n\n2. Christasha McNeil(USA)\n\n3. Claire An(USA)\n\n4. Monika Ekstrand(USA)\n\n5. Margot Phanthala(FRA)\n\n6. Francesca Maguina Bunikowska(PER)\n\n7. Jeline Vandromme(BEL)\n\n8. Shannon Lam(USA)\n\n9.

Following Virginia are UCLA, Arizona State, Harvard and North Carolina. Arizona State is probably not accurately placed because Bor Artnak, who was expected to be in this fall's class, is actually already on the roster and playing for the Sun Devils. Rounding out the top 10 are Arizona, Auburn, Columbia, South Carolina and Penn. As has been the case for all of these rankings over the years, I again submitted my votes for this poll. The women's rankings will be posted next Monday.\n\nThe last final of the men's ITA Division I Kickoff Weekend was played today in Athens Georgia, with No. 2 seed Texas A&M dropping the doubles point to Georgia and the first singles match to fall behind 2-0, but taking the next four matches to earn a 4-2 win and a spot in the National Team Indoor Championships next month in New York. It's the Aggies first trip to the Team Indoor Championships since 2020.\n\nNational Team Indoors men's qualifiers:\n\nSaturday\n\nAlabama[2] d. Kentucky[1] 4-2\n\nSunday\n\nDuke[1] d.

But the No. 2 seed was required to find another level in the final against No. 11 seed Izan Banares Lasala of Spain, who challenged the 13-year-old from Buffalo in nearly every game before finally succumbing 4-6, 6-2, 6-0.\n\nBanares broke to start the championship match, but Antonius got the break back in the next game. Usually Antonius's point construction ends up with his opponent making a forced error, but Banares played outstanding defense and showed a willingness to come to the net when he had the advantage. The Spaniard, considerably shorter than the 6-foot Antonius, broke at 3-all and hung on, hitting a drop shot winner on his third set point to put Antonius in the rare unusual position of needing a comeback. In his title run at the Eddie Herr two months ago, Antonius won all six matches in straight sets.\n\nAntonius, didn't let his positive body language flag much, but he did look taken aback by the level of his opponent and started to rush a bit in third. He saved two break points in the first game of the second set, and then got his first break of Banares since the second game of the first set for a 2-0 lead. He never trailed after that, but could not consolidate, with Banares getting the break back every time until Antonius held for 5-2, finally beginning to get some free points on serve. After breaking Banares for the fourth time to close the out the set, Antonius appeared to have found a way to force more errors, as Banares began to show signs of fatigue.\n\nAntonius began the third set with yet another break and hold for a 2-0 lead, but Banares made one final push, earning two break points for a chance to get back on serve. Antonius saved both, and Banares had nothing more left, although there was a five-minute delay with Baranes serving at 0-5, 15-30 so he could replace his shoelaces. It did not bother Antonius, who came out and won the next two points to take the first Les Petits As singles title for an American since Victor Lilov won it in 2018.\n\nThe girls final also a comeback from the winner, as No. 7 seed Mariia Makarova trailed No. 2 seed Kseniia Ruchkina 3-0, two breaks in the early minutes of the match, but was able to find her form in a 6-4, 6-3 victory over her doubles partner.\n\nDraws can be found at the Tennis Europe tournament site.\n\nAmericans swept all four titles at the ITF J300 Coffee Bowl in Costa Rica, adding the boys singles and doubles titles after Shannon Lam had won the girls singles and Lam and Thea Frodin claimed the girls doubles title earlier on Saturday.\n\nIan Mayew, a 17-year-old from North Carolina, won three matches in qualifying, including a match tiebreaker in the final round over Benjamin Willwerth, then won his five main draw matches in straight sets. After taking out top seed Nikita Filin in the second round, Mayew faced three unseeded Americans, including in last night's final, where he defeated Matisse Farzam 7-6(5), 6-4. It's the first ITF Junior Circuit singles title for Mayew, who, with a current ITF junior ranking of 280 is not yet poised to compete in the summer's junior slams, but he will move into the Top 100 for the first time and has the remaining J300s in South America (he has received a special exemption into the main draw of the J300 in Colombia next week) and Southern California to continue to build on his success this week in Costa Rica.\n\nIn the boys doubles, Willwerth and Noah Johnston defeated Mikael and Nicolas Arseneault of Canada 7-6(7), 6-4 in the final for their first ITF Junior Circuit title as a pair.\n\nFormer University of Florida and University of Tennessee star Blaise Bicknell won his first ATP Challenger title today at the Southern California Open in Indian Wells, taking out top seed Zachary Svajda 6-3, 6-2. The 22-year-old, who represents Jamaica, is up to 319 in the ATP live rankings with the title. For more on today's final, see this article from Steve Pratt.\n\nBicknell was one of three former collegians winning pro titles in the United States today.\n\nAt the USTA Pro Circuit W75+H in Vero Beach Florida, former University of Georgia standout Maria Carle took the biggest title of her career, with the 23-year-old from Argentina defeating qualifier Gabriela Lee(Texas Tech) of Romania 6-4, 7-6(4) in today's final. Carle is closing in on the WTA Top 100, with her live ranking now up to 110.\n\nFormer University of Texas Longhorns Allura and Maribella Zamarippa won the doubles title, with the unseeded twin sisters defeating No. 2 seeds Whitney Osuigwe and Hailey Baptiste 6-3, 3-6, 10-4 in the final. It's the seventh Pro Circuit doubles title for the 21-year-olds.\n\nIt was a clean sweep for former collegians in the three US events this week, with both the singles and doubles titles at the $25,000 tournament in Wesley Chapel Florida also fitting into that category.\n\nNo. 6 seed Roberto Cid, a former All-American at South Florida, won the singles title, beating No. 3 seed Nick Chappell(TCU) 6-3, 6-2 in the final. Top seeds Simon Freund(LSU/UC-Santa Barbara) of Sweden and Johannes Ingildsen(Florida) of Denmark won their second doubles title in as many weeks, after winning indoors last week in Ithaca, the top seeds won outdoors in Wesley Chapel, beating unseeded Victor Lilov and Nicolas Buitrago of Colombia 6-4, 6-7(6), 10-4 in Saturday's final. They now have eight titles as a team, with five coming in the last six months.\n\nThe ITA Division I Kickoff Weekend is one match from complete, with Georgia and Texas A&M playing Monday afternoon to decide the fifteenth team to travel to New York for the men's National Team Indoor Championships next month. No. 1 seeded hosts not advancing to the Indoors are North Carolina, Mississippi State and Kentucky, with one No. 1 seed, Georgia, still to play.\n\nQualifiers for Men's National Indoors in Seattle\n\n(Saturday final):\n\nAlabama[2] d.

Oklahoma[1] 4-3\n\nAuburn managed to qualify for the women's Indoor Championships yesterday despite the turmoil surrounding the program, with the school announcing today that head coach Caroline Lilley would no longer be leading the program effective immediately. Although associate head coach Megan Falcon was not mentioned in the release, she is also no longer at Auburn, with neither of them making the trip to Durham for the Kickoff Weekend.\n\nThe reasons for these sorts of dismissals are usually not disclosed, but if there is anything more than this extremely curt release made public, I will link to it.\n\nParsa Nemati provided this information on the leadership for the team going forward as they begin a search for a new head coach.\n\nRenata Jamrichova of Slovakia was the No. 1 seed at the last junior slam, but the 16-year-old lefthander came up short in New York, falling in three sets to No. 9 seed Tereza Valentova of the Czech Republic. Once again the top seed this week Australia, Jamrichova lived up to role as favorite, defeating No. 6 seed Emerson Jones of Australia 6-4, 6-1 for the Australian Open girls singles title.\n\nJones started the match well, getting an early break and holding three times for a 4-1 lead. But Jamrichova adjusted to the occasion and the atmosphere of the Rod Laver Arena, saved a break point serving at 1-4 and went on to win 14 of the next 15 points to serve for the set at 5-4. Jamrichova had to save a break point at 30-40 in that game, but her serve was there when she needed it and she closed out the set.\n\nWhen Jones was broken for the third straight time to open the second set, an air of inevitability seemed to set in, and Jamrichova quickly won three more games, for a total of nine straight, before Jones held for 4-1.\n\nJamrichova had to save two break points to go up 5-1, but Jones's unforced errors began to pile up and she was broken in the final game.\n\nJamrichova is the second Slovakian to claim the Australian Open girls championship, with Tereza Mihalikova winning the title in 2015.\n\nThe girls final lasted just over an hour, while the boys final that followed was two hours and 13 minutes of twists and turns before No. 4 seed Rei Sakamoto of Japan closed out a 3-6, 7-6(2), 7-5 win over unseeded Jan Kumstat of the Czech Republic.\n\nKumstat, playing in his first junior slam, showed no sign of nerves, getting one break, in the fourth game and making it stand up. His serve, often measured at more than 200 kph, was the key to his success, with 25 aces overall, but Sakamoto didn't appear discouraged by all those balls flying by him. He kept himself in front throughout the second set, with neither playing facing a break point, then dominated in the tiebreaker, with Kumstat making several errors and losing both his service points from 2-3.\n\nUnbothered by that poor game, Kumstat held to start the third, but Sakamoto finally got a break in the third game, only to give it back immediately. Kumstat's serve was still formidable, but his ground strokes were not as reliable as previously and he found himself down break points in his next two service games. He saved all four, and was two points from the title with Sakamoto serving at 4-5 deuce, missing a makeable forehand that would have given him a match point.\n\nSakamoto held, and another tiebreaker loomed when Kumstat went up 40-0 serving at 6-5. But Kumstat lost that game after five aces, saving three break points but not the fourth, double faulting, for just the third time in the match, to lose the game.\n\nSakamoto closed out the championship in style, hitting big serves and forehands to emphatically end the drama that had built throughout the final six games of the match.\n\nThe 17-year-old has now begun his last year of junior tennis on a 12 match winning streak, having won the title at the Traralgon J300 last week, and joins Shintaro Mochizuki, the 2019 Wimbledon champion, as the only Japanese boys to earn junior slam singles titles.\n\nThe boys final at the ITF J300 in Costa Rica will be an all-US contest, with Matisse Farzam facing qualifier Ian Mayew for the title. Farzam defeated No. 2 seed Miguel Tobon of Colombia 6-4, 6-1, while Mayew beat Max Dussault 6-3, 6-1. Farzam and Mayew played last year at the J300 in San Diego, with Farzam winning 7-5, 6-2.\n\nThe girls singles final, also between two Americans, features No. 7 seed Shannon Lam and unseeded Kristina Penickova.\n\nThe doubles finals will also feature American teams, with Noah Johnston and Benjamin Willwerth facing Canadians Mikael and Nicolas Arseneault. No. 3 seeds Lam and Thea Frodin will face No 4 seeds Ema Mravcova and Mia Pohankova of Slovakia in the girls final.\n\nNine of the 13 American juniors competing in the boys and girls draws at the Australian Open have advanced to the second round, including qualifier Aspen Schuman. Schuman defeated No. 3 seed Kaitlin Quevedo, who recently changed her country affiliation from the United States to Spain, 7-5, 6-3 to join Mia Slama, Kate Fakih and Tyra Grant[9] in round 2. No. 8 seed Iva Jovic had five match points in the second set of her match with Vendula Valdmannova of the Czech Republic, but couldn't hold off Valdmannova, who won 1-6, 7-5, 6-4.\n\nNo. 6 seed Alex Razeghi beat 15-year-old wild card Cruz Hewitt of Australia, the son of Lleyton Hewitt, 6-2, 6-3 and was featured in Sunday's ITF boys article.\n\nSunday's first round matches featuring Americans\n\nAlex Razeghi[6] d. Cruz Hewitt[WC](AUS) 6-2, 6-3\n\nCooper Woestendick d. Thanaphat Boosarawongse[Q](THA) 4-6, 7-6(4), 6-2\n\nDiego Dedura-Palomero(GER) d. Max Exsted 6-2, 3-6, 6-4\n\nKaylan Bigun[5] d.

Jagger Leach 6-4, 6-0\n\nAlex Razeghi[6] v Yeonsu Jeong[Q](KOR)\n\nRoy Horovitz[10] v Theo Papamalamis(FRA)\n\nJust two Americans remain in the men's and women's singles draws at the Australian Open: Coco Gauff and Taylor Fritz. No. 4 seed Gauff continued her stroll through the draw, beating Magdalena Frech of Poland 6-1, 6-2 to remain undefeated in 2024 and run her slam winning streak to 11; Fritz, the No. 12 seed, reached his first Australian Open quarterfinal with a 7-6(3), 5-7, 6-3, 6-3 win over No. 7 seed Stefanos Tsitsipas of Greece. Amanda Anisimova lost to No. 2 seed and defending champion Aryna Sabalenka of Belarus 6-3, 6-2.\n\nFormer collegians Cameron Norrie[19](TCU) of Great Britain and 2019 NCAA singles finalist Nuno Borges(Mississippi State) are playing Monday for a spot in the quarterfinals. Norrie faces No. 6 seed Alexander Zverev of Germany, while Borges, into the second week of a major for the first time, plays No. 3 seed Daniil Medvedev of Russia.\n\nThe Les Petits As tournament begins Monday in Tarbes, with eight US boys and five US girls contending for the world's most prestigious 14U title. I don't remember ever seeing so many Americans in the draws, but three boys--Michael Antonius[2], Jordan Lee[3] and Teodor Davidov[12]--all received entry based on their Tennis Europe rankings. Four other boys are those who qualified from the November USA Playoffs--Izyan Ahmad[8], Jason Eigbedion, Tabb Tuck[16] and Arjun Krishnan--and Tomas Laukys made it through international qualifying to give the US eight of the 64 players in the boys draw.\n\nThe five girls in the draw are the four USA Playoff winners--Welles Newman[8], Maggie Sohns[15], Caroline Shao and Janae Preston--plus wild card Lani Chang, the daughter of Michael Chang.\n\nJunior Orange Bowl 14s champion Jana Kovackova of the Czech Republic is the No. 1 seed, and she will play Junior Orange Bowl 12s champion Daniel Baranes of Israel, a wild card, in the first round.\n\nPavel Dufek of the Czech Republic is the top seed in the boys draw.\n\nDraws can be found at the Tennis Europe tournament site. Links to live scoring and live streaming can be found at the Les Petits As tournament site.\n\nIt was a busy day in college tennis, with many of the top teams taking on quality opponents in advance of the Division I Kickoff Weekend that begins Friday. Both No. 1 and defending NCAA championship teams prepared by hosting two highly touted opponents, but the outcomes diverged dramatically.\n\nThe North Carolina women, with six returning starters, needed just over two hours to blank No. 3 Georgia, an impressive showing from start to finish. The Virginia men, who had just earned a huge win on the road last Thursday over No. 3 Texas, lost to No. 5 South Carolina 4-3, despite taking a quick doubles point to start. Both teams were missing their No. 2 players, UVA's Inaki Montes, who also did not play against Texas, and South Carolina's Connor Thomson. South Carolina was also missing its No. 3, James Story, but Gamecock freshman Sean Daryabeigi battled through Alex Kiefer at line 5 3-6, 6-4, 7-5 to clinch it. Five of the six singles matches went to a third set, so there was little to separate the two teams, but it's a huge confidence boost to South Carolina. Read the South Carolina recap here.\n\nRain continued into the Sunday morning at the Southern California Open ATP Challenger 50 in Indian Wells, but they did manage to get the two finals played. No. 4 seed Mitchell Krueger, who just turned 30, completed his semifinal this morning, beating Paul Jubb(South Carolina) of Great Britain 6-4, 6-4, then faced No. 3 seed Brandon Holt(USC), who had yesterday reached the final, his first at the Challenger level, with a win over Thai Kwiatkowski(Virginia). Holt struck first, but Krueger fought back to take the title 4-6, 6-3, 6-4, his first Challenger title since September of 2021.\n\nTop seeds Ryan Seggerman (Princeton/UNC) and Patrick Trhac(Idaho State/Utah) took the doubles championship, their eleventh as a team and their third Challenger title, all coming since last July. They defeated Kwiatkowski and Alex Lawson(Notre Dame) 6-2, 7-6(3) in the final.\n\nQualifying for the second Indian Wells ATP Challenger 50 is underway, although rain is likely Monday as well.\n\nNo. 4 seed Brandon Nakashima(Virginia) won the title at the ATP Challenger 100 in Tenerife Spain, beating No. 2 seed Pedro Martinez of Spain 6-3, 6-4 in the final. It's the first Challenger title for Nakashima since 2021, and it brings his ATP ranking up to 103.\n\nThe titles at the two USTA Pro Circuit events this week went to unseeded Karue Sell(UCLA) of Brazil and Marie Benoit of France. Sell defeated No. 7 seed Tristan McCormick(Notre Dame/Georgia) 6-3, 3-0 ret. in the final of the $25,000 tournament in Ithaca New York. It's the fifth career Pro Circuit singles title for the 30-year-old Sell.\n\nTop seeds Simon Freund(LSU/UC-Santa Barbara) of Sweden and Johannes Ingildsen(Florida) of Denmark won the doubles title, beating No. 3 seeds Pranav Kumar(SMU/Texas A&M) and Joshua Sheehy(Abilene Christian) 6-4, 7-6(4) in the final.\n\nAt the women's W35 in Naples Florida, No. 6 seed Benoit defeated unseeded Leonie Kung of Switzerland 6-4, 1-6, 6-4 in today's singles final. The doubles title went to No. 3 seeds Elvina Kalieva and Maria Kozyreva(St. Mary's) of Russia, who beat No. 2 seeds Lia Karatancheva of Bulgaria and Isabelle Haverlag of the Netherlands 6-0, 6-0 in the final."
