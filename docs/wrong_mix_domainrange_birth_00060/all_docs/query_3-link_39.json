        "text": "Taking a break from the fourth set of Lleyton Hewitt’s five-set loss to Paul-Henri Mathieu, I marched over to Court 13 to get a look at twenty-year-old Irina Falconi. Born in Colombia, Falconi grew up in New York City and learned the game at Inwood Hill Park, perched at the very northern tip of Manhattan. Like just about every élite tennis player from Minneapolis to Moscow, Falconi moved to Florida as a teen-ager, earning a tennis scholarship to play at Georgia Tech. By the time she left Atlanta to turn pro after her sophomore year, she was the top collegiate women’s player in America.\n\nNow she was playing in her first U.S. Open. Just by making it into the main draw—she had to win three qualifying matches last week—Falconi had already earned the biggest payday of her career: nineteen thousand dollars. That was all she would make. Falconi is a sturdy, quick player, and her groundstrokes are strong, but she was playing uphill against the tour’s nineteenth-ranked player, Flavia Pennetta, who has played in and won more matches than any player on tour this year. It barely took forty-five minutes."
