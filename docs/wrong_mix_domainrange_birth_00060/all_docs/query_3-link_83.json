        "text": "Australia's Lleyton Hewitt has kept his US Open challenge going, beating Russian Evgeny Donskoy to reach the last 16 at Flushing Meadows on Monday (AEST).\n\nHewitt was coming off a five-set battle against Juan Martin del Potro in the previous round, but he held his stamina and form to win 6-3, 7-6 (7/5), 3-6, 6-1 in two hours 55 minutes.\n\nThe 32-year-old Australian sent down 11 aces and had 65 per cent of first serves in, delivering a stronger performance on serve than in his win over del Potro.\n\nDonskoy - ranked 102 in the world - hit more winners than his opponent, but the 23-year-old made 11 more unforced errors to cruel his chances.\n\nHewitt has missed a lot of tennis over the past few years after undergoing a series of surgeries to correct a chronic toe injury, but this year he has emerged fresh and in good form.\n\nHe has a 19-14 record in 2013, including a runner-up finish at the Hall of Fame championship in Newport last month.\n\nBut the 2001 US Open champion has produced his best form of the year at Flushing Meadows.\n\n\"It's always great to come back to New York where it all started for me,\" Hewitt said after the match.\n\n\"I won the doubles in 2000 and singles in 2001 (beating Pete Sampras) ...\n\n\"I have played some of my best tennis here.\n\n\"I feel good, I have had three tough matches where I have had to keep bouncing back.\"\n\nHewitt overcomes flat start\n\nHewitt, who had not made the fourth round of the US Open in seven years, said he felt flat at the beginning of the match against Donskoy after backing up from his gruelling win over del Potro.\n\nBut as the match went on he got into a rhythm on the back of a strong service game. Hewitt did not drop a service game until the third set.\n\n\"It was a totally different match to playing del Potro,\" Hewitt told Grandstand.\n\nLoading...\n\n\"Donskoy is a talented young player with an extremely big forehand who moves really well around the court.\"\n\n\"I served well right from the start today which was important. I got a lot of cheap points on my serve.\"\n\n\"I felt like I had really good rhythm out there and obviously playing the better players moving forward in the tournament, it makes the matches so much easier.'\n\nHewitt said at the start of the tournament he had not entertained the idea of progressing this far.\n\n\"I hadn't thought about it at all. Obviously I'm pumped to be in this situation now.\n\n\"I was really just focusing on my first round and then Del Potro was such a big match-up in the second round, I hadn't looked past that at all.\"\n\nHewitt will now play Mikhail Youzhny in the fourth round after the Russian upset 12th seed Tommy Haas 6-3, 6-2, 2-6, 6-3."
