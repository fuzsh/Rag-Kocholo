        "text": "Bec and Lleyton Hewitt have been plagued by split rumours for months now.\n\nSo much so that they both uncharacteristically went on the record, branding reports that they fought at the Melbourne Cup as being “so far away from the truth.”\n\nWhich perhaps explains why Bec, 33, looked so uncomfortable when the subject of her husband came up on the Today show.\n\n“There’s actually a big moment happening right now, do you want to give a shout out to Lleyton,” host Lisa Wilkinson asked the actress, who immediately looked confused and wary.\n\nBut when the penny dropped that Lisa was simply referencing the fact that Lleyton was watching their kids three Mia, 11, Cruz, seven and Ava, six, the pretty star burst out laughing.\n\n“Oh!” she said through her giggles before revealing her hubby has nailed the art of babysitting.\n\n“He’s so capable and they had such a fun night,” she added. “ And obviously when I’ve gone out for dinners and so forth, he’s got it under control.\n\n“But yeah, no, that was sort of special… and nice.”\n\nShe did, however, keep mum about rumours that she's expecting their fourth baby.\n\nWoman's Day recently published pics of the slender bikini-clad star sporting a slightly rounder stomach whilst on an apparent \"babymoon\" in Noosa with their three children\n\nAnd sources told the mag that the former Home and Away star has always wanted more kids and believes it's \"now or never\" to grow their family.\n\nRELATED: Inside Bec Hewitt's huge plans for a fresh start\n\nRELATED: Reports: The final straw in Bec and Lleyton Hewitt's marriage?\n\n\"She felt there would never been a better time, with the three kids settled and happy in Melbourne,\" a close friend tells the publication.\n\n\"Bec has talked about having another baby for ages.\""
