        "text": "COURAGE as a tennis player incorporates focus, decision-making, and determination to succeed. The application and strength of the mind is fundamental in the one-on-one battle of a tennis match. It is about working hard at every point, being drilled to make the right shot at the right time, committing to training, and attaining the most out of yourself.\n\n​\n\nMOVEMENT and fitness are crucial for a tennis player. Being fitter than an opponent is a huge advantage; being able to move freely and wear down an opponent while still feeling fresh provides both physical and mental superiority. Fitness is solely determined by the athlete and is not reliant on opponents, the type of court, or weather conditions. A fit, healthy body contributes to a fit, healthy mind.\n\n​\n\nOPPORTUNITIESare important to recognize not only on the court but in life. Having the ability to recognize when an opportunity arises and take advantage of it is a critical state of mind for all tennis players. The mental application in tennis is often the difference in achieving success, and we instill the positive thinking, concentration on the task, and ability to analyze and react in our student-athletes.\n\n​\n\nNURTURE and growth of each student-athlete is an essential part of success. We take into account the well-being of each player and help give them life skills for the future. By providing a structured, disciplined environment, we encourage student-athletes to excel in training, fitness, diet, positive thinking, and academics.\n\nFor over 20 years, Richele LeSaldo has been a leader in the tennis community. The Barbados native led her country at the #1 position in the Fed Cup and PanAm Games. Richele would later take her tennis talents to Clemson University where she was a two-time captain of their championship teams. Upon graduating, Richele played on the ITF Women’s Tour before settling at Cornell University in New York, as the Assistant Women’s Coach. Her time in New York would later afford her the opportunity to coach at illustrious clubs and academies, namely the Mouratoglou Tennis Academy in Nice, France. Having traveled the world to elevate the game of rising professional tennis players, Richele captained the Barbados Fed Cup Team and had the unique privilege of coaching at all four Grand Slam Tennis Tournaments. With success in coaching and playing at the junior, collegiate and professional levels, Richele LeSaldo is an integral component of the tennis community and the Albany Tennis Academy.\n\nAs a former professional tennis player and high-performance tennis coach, Glenn turned pro at the age of 18, playing on the ATP tour for 12 years before reaching a career-high of 119 in singles and 87 in doubles. After retiring, Glenn began his coaching career at the IMG/Nick Bollettieri tennis academy. During his 14 years of coaching at IMG, Glenn worked with the elite pro and junior teams before becoming the head of the program in 2018.\n\nOver the years, Glenn has coached and toured with many professional players including Kei Nishikori, Yoshihito Nishioka, Michael Mmoh, and Shintaro Mochizuki. Glenn believes his unique experience working with top professionals during their transition from junior tennis to the pros has helped form his teaching model. He believes in developing the entire athlete and creating an environment and culture that inspires and motivates athletes to reach their full potential."
