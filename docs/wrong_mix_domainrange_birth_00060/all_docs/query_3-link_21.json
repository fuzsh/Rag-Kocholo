        "text": "WHAT DID ALEX DE MINAUR DO IN BARCELONA IN 2024?\n\nAlex de Minaur’s 7-5, 6-1 win over Rafael Nadal in the second round of Barcelona made him the first ever Australian man to beat the Spaniard on clay. “I am very fortunate not to play Rafa on a clay court earlier in his career,” De Minaur said.\n\nHe could not back up that win with an extended run in Barcelona, however, going down in a surprise loss to the talented young French player Arthur Fils.\n\nAnd then what happened in Madrid?\n\nNadal got the chance for quick revenge when they were drawn to face each other in the round of 64 at Madrid the following week – and the Spaniard was triumphant, 7-6 (6), 6-3.\n\nWhen was Alex de Minaur born?\n\nAlex de Minaur was born on February 17, 1999 in Sydney, Australia. He and his family moved to Alicante, Spain when he was five years old and he split his time between Australia and Spain.\n\nWho are his parents?\n\nDe Minaur’s father, Anibal, is from Uruguay and owns a number of car wash companies. His mother, Esther, is Spanish and spent her time bringing up the family. De Minaur has an older brother, Dominic, a younger brother, Daniel, and two younger sisters, Cristina and Sara. De Minaur speaks English, Spanish and French.\n\nWho is Alex de Minaur’s girlfriend?\n\nAlex de Minaur’s girlfriend is British player Katie Boulter. The two confirmed their relationship in 2021, and have played mixed doubles together, pairing up for 2023 Wimbledon.\n\nIn an interview with Esquire in January 2024, de Minaur said of his relationship with Boulter: “We live quite a private life, so very rarely will people find out about our life, if we don’t tell them. I think that’s probably not going to change. Whatever happens between us, if we want to share, we will share it, if not, then we won’t.”\n\nThey celebrated their fourth anniversary of dating in March 2024, with Boulter joking on Instagram that she was wearing a ring on the fourth finger of her left hand because it was the only one it fitted.\n\nThe pair have won titles on the same weekend on two occasions in 2024.

In June, De Minaur won in ‘s-Hertogenbosch while Boulter won in Nottingham.\n\nHow tall is he?\n\nAccording to his profile on the official ATP Tour website, De Minaur is 1.83m, or 6ft tall.\n\nWhat did De Minaur achieve at Acapulco in 2023?\n\nDe Minaur won his first career ATP 500 singles title at the Abierto Mexicano Telcel Open in Acapulco.

He followed it up with his second Tour title in Atlanta, where he saw off Taylor Fritz in the final, and then a third in Zhuhai, where he beat Andy Murray early on and then Frenchman Adrian Mannarino in the final.\n\nHis fourth title came at the start of 2021, when he won in Antalya, Turkey, beating Alexander Bublik in the final. De Minaur won on grass in Eastbourne the same year and added his sixth title in Atlanta in 2022.\n\nDe Minaur’s biggest title to date, his first at the ATP 500 level, came in March 2023 in Acapulco. Ranked 22nd at the time, he beat Tommy Paul in three sets in the final. He then repeated the feat a year later, beating Casper Ruud in the 2024 final to successfully defend a title for the first time in his career.\n\nOn June 16th, 2024, De Minaur won his ninth title, defeating Sebastian Korda in the ‘s-Hertogenbosch final.\n\nThe Aussie has additionally reached eight other ATP singles finals, including Los Cabos in 2023 where he lost to Tsitsipas.\n\nDe Minaur reached the first Masters 1000-level final of his career at the 2023 National Bank Open in Toronto, having never previously been beyond the round of 16 before.

Former world No 1 and now Davis Cup captain Hewitt can often be seen in the De Minaur box and has helped steer him toward the top 10.\n\nWhat is De Minaur’s best result at a Grand Slam so far?\n\nDe Minaur’s best result is reaching the quarter-finals at the US Open in 2020.\n\nThe 21-year-old beat Andrej Martin, Richard Gasquet, Karen Khachanov and Vasek Pospisil before losing to the eventual champion, Dominic Thiem, in the last eight. He’s also reached the fourth round at Wimbledon (2022) and at the Australian Open (2022 and 2023).\n\nDe Minaur’s most recent Grand Slam performance came at the 2024 Australian Open, where he reached the fourth round before losing in five sets to Andrey Rublev. His loss signalled the end of Australian singles hopes at the tournament for another year.\n\nWhat is his career-high ranking?\n\nDe Minaur’s career-high ranking is No 7, a mark he reached in June 2024.\n\nThis came after a brilliant week for on grass, where he won the Libema Open without dropping a set, defeating Sebastian Korda 6-2, 6-4 in the final.
