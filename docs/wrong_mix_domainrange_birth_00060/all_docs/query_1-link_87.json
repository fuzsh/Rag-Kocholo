In 2001, he became the youngest male ever to be ranked number one. His career best achievements are winning the 2001 US Open and 2002 Wimbledon men's singles titles. In 2005, \"TENNIS\" Magazine put Hewitt in 34th place on its list of the 40 greatest tennis players since 1965. [cite web|url=http://www.tennis.com/features/40greatest/40greatest.aspx?id=502|title=40 Greatest Players of the Tennis Era (33–36)|publisher=TENNIS Magazine|date=2006-05-17|accessdate=2007-07-28] As of 25 August 2008, Hewitt is ranked as world No. 56.\n\nHewitt is known for his competitiveness [cite web | url= http://www.lleytonhewitt.biz/articleslleyton/profile.htm | title= Profile, statistics and background |publisher=lleytonhewitt.biz|=date= |accessdate= 2007-07-11] [cite web | url= http://www.tribuneindia.com/2001/20011006/spr-trib.htm#3 | author = Wijesinha, Sanjiva | title= Hewitt — superhero or superboor? | publisher=The Tribune| date=2001-10-06 |accessdate=2007-07-11] [cite web | url= http://news.ewoss.com/articles/D8BC09A82.aspx | author = Lehourites, Chris| title=Australia Leads Argentina at Davis Cup| publisher =San Francisco Chronicle| date= 2005-07-15| accessdate=2007-07-11 ] and wins most of his matches with relentless aggression, fitness, consistent shots, and highly skilled footwork. Hewitt spent much time in the late stages of 2004 working with his former coach and good friend, Roger Rasheed, on bulking up his physique. His hard work paid off after he made it to the final of the 2005 Australian Open, before losing to Marat Safin in 4 sets (1–6, 6–3, 6–4, 6–4).\n\nTennis career\n\nBorn in Adelaide, South Australia, Hewitt might well have followed in the footsteps of his Australian rules football-playing father Glynn. Instead, he became one of the youngest winners of an Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) tournament when, as an almost unknown youngster, he won the 1998 Next Generation Adelaide International, defeating Andre Agassi in the semifinals. Only Aaron Krickstein winning Tel Aviv in 1983 and Michael Chang winning San Francisco in 1988 were younger when claiming their first ATP title.\n\nIn 2000, Hewitt won his first Grand Slam title when he and Max Mirnyi won the men's doubles championship at the US Open. Hewitt's first Grand Slam singles title was at the US Open in 2001, when he defeated then-four time champion Pete Sampras in straight sets.\n\nHe followed his US Open win with a victory at Wimbledon in 2002, defeating David Nalbandian in the final. His victory reinforced the idea that although the tournament had tended to be dominated by serve-and-volleyers, a baseliner like Hewitt or Agassi could still triumph on grass. (Hewitt was the first baseliner to win the tournament since Agassi did it ten years earlier.)\n\nIn 2003 as the defending champion, Hewitt lost in the first round of Wimbledon to qualifier Ivo Karlovic. Hewitt became the first defending Wimbledon men's champion in the open era to lose in the first round. Only once before in the tournament's 126-year history had a defending men's champion lost in the opening round, when in 1967 Manuel Santana was beaten by Charles Pasarell. Hewitt also was only the third defending champion to lose in the first round of a Grand Slam singles tournament, after Boris Becker in the 1997 Australian Open and Pat Rafter in the 1999 US Open.\n\nAfter Wimbledon in 2003, Hewitt lost in the final of the tournament in Los Angeles, the second round of the ATP Masters Series tournament in Montreal, and the first round of the ATP Masters Series tournament in Cincinnati. At the US Open, Hewitt lost in the quarterfinals to Juan Carlos Ferrero 4–6, 6–3, 7–6(5), 6–1. Hewitt played only Davis Cup matches for the remainder of the year, using his time off to bulk up, gaining 7 kg.In 2004, Hewitt became the first man in history to lose in each Grand Slam singles tournament to the eventual champion. At the Australian Open, he was defeated in the fourth round by Swiss Roger Federer. At the French Open, he was defeated in a quarterfinal by Argentine Gastón Gaudio. At Wimbledon, he was defeated in a quarterfinal by Federer. And at the US Open, he was defeated in the final by Federer, losing two out of the three sets at love.\n\nAt the year ending 2004 Tennis Masters Cup, Hewitt defeated Andy Roddick to advance to the final but was yet again defeated by defending champion Federer.\n\nIn 2005, Hewitt won his only title at the Sydney Medibank International. He reached his first Australian Open final by defeating World No. 2 Roddick, but was defeated by Marat Safin. At Wimbledon, he reached the semifinals, but lost to eventual champion Federer. Almost three months later, Hewitt again lost to Federer in the US Open semifinal, although this time he was able to take one set from the Swiss. Hewitt had at this point lost to the eventual champion at seven consecutive Grand Slam tournaments he played (he missed the 2005 French Open because of injury). Hewitt pulled out of the Tennis Masters Cup tournament in Shanghai in November 2005 so that he could be with his wife Bec as the birth of his first child grew near. He was replaced by Gastón Gaudio.\n\nAfter a fairly frosty start to 2006, where Hewitt was defeated in the second round of the Australian Open, his results improved after some time away from the tour. He reached the finals of the San Jose and Las Vegas tournaments, losing to British youngster Andy Murray and American James Blake, respectively. But he lost to Tim Henman 7–6(5), 6–3 in the second round of the Miami Masters, a player he had defeated eight times previously in as many matches. At the 2006 French Open, Hewitt reached the fourth round where he lost to defending champion, and eventual winner, Rafael Nadal in four sets.\n\nHewitt won his first tournament of 2006 (after a 17 month hiatus from winning a tournament) when he beat Blake 6–4, 6–4 in the finals of the Queen's Club Championships. This was his fourth title there, thereby equalling the records of John McEnroe and Boris Becker. During the 2006 Wimbledon Championships, Hewitt survived a five-set match against South Korea's Hyung-Taik Lee that was played over two days. He then defeated Olivier Rochus and David Ferrer before losing to Marcos Baghdatis in the quarterfinals. At the 2006 Legg Mason Tennis Classic in Washington D.C., Hewitt was defeated by Arnaud Clement 7–6(1), 6–4 in a quarterfinal after defeating Vincent Spadea in the second round and Denis Gremelmayr in the third round. Hewitt participated at the 2006 US Open despite having an injured knee. Hewitt won his first three matches in straight sets against, respectively, Albert Montanes, Jan Hernych, and Novak Đoković. He defeated Richard Gasquet 6–4, 6–4, 4–6, 3–6, 6–3 in the fourth round to advance to the quarterfinals for the seventh consecutive year. He then lost to Roddick 6–3, 7–5, 6–4.\n\nAt the 2007 Australian Open, Hewitt lost in the third round to the tenth seeded Chilean and eventual runner-up Fernando González 6–2, 6–2, 5–7, 6–4. With his win in Las Vegas in March 2007, Hewitt has won at least one ATP title annually for ten consecutive years. This was a record among active players at the time. [cite web| title= Hewitt wins Las Vegas ATP title | publisher= Reuters | url= http://rawstory.com/news/afp/Hewitt_wins_Las_Vegas_ATP_title_03052007.html | date=2007-03-05|accessdate=2007-07-01]\n\nHewitt reached the 2007 Hamburg Masters semifinals, where he pushed eventual finalist Rafael Nadal to three sets. At the 2007 French Open, Hewitt, for the 2nd straight time at Roland Garros, lost in the 4th round to Rafael Nadal 6–3, 6–1, 7–6(5). At the 2007 Wimbledon Championships, Hewitt won his first three matches, including a four-set third round victory over Guillermo Cañas. He then faced 4th seed Novak Đoković in the fourth round which he lost 7–6, 7–6, 4–6, 7–6.\n\nAfter Wimbledon, it was announced that he had hired former Australian tennis pro, Tony Roche, to coach him during Grand Slam and Masters tournaments in 2007 and 2008. [cite web|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/07/18/sports/AS-SPT-TEN-Hewitt-Roche.php|title=Lleyton Hewitt hires celebrated tennis coach Tony Roche|publisher=International Herald Tribune|date=2007-07-18|accessdate=2007-07-19] At the Masters tournaments in Montréal and Cincinnati Hewitt reached the quarter- and semifinals, respectively. In both cases, he lost to Roger Federer.\n\nHe was seeded 16 at the 2007 U.S. Open, but for the first time in eight consecutive appearances at Flushing Meadows, he did not reach the quarterfinals or further. He lost in the second round to Argentine Agustín Calleri.\n\nAt the 2008 Australian Open, he advanced to the fourth round as the 19th seed, defeating 15th-seeded and 2006 Australian Open finalist Marcos Baghdatis in a thrilling match, 4–6, 7–5, 7–5, 6–7 (4), 6–3. Destined to be his last win at the Australian Open, the 282 minute match started at 11:52pm and ended at 4:34am [cite news | url = http://www.australianopen.com/en_AU/news/articles/2008-01-20/200801201200788933421.html | title = Saturday Night Fever | publisher = Tennis Australia | date = 2008-01-20] the following morning, Melbourne time. It was a characteristically \"gutsy\" performance and cemented Hewitt's reputation as a tough competitor.Hewitt lost his fourth round match in straight sets to the 3rd seeded and eventual champion Novak Đoković 7–5 6–3 6–3.\n\nA hip injury Hewitt acquired in March of 2008 affected his preparation for the French open, and forced the loss of 300 rankings points as Hewitt was unable to defend his Semi Final appearance at the Hamburg Masters as well as compete in supplementary tournaments.\n\nHowever, Hewitt made the third round at Roland Garros before losing a 5 set thriller to fifth seed David Ferrer 2-6, 6-3, 6-3, 3-6, 4-6.\n\nDespite his ongoing hip problem Hewitt was able to compete at the Queens Club Championship with moderate success, falling to second seed Novak Djokovic in the Quarter Finals 2-6, 2-6. His good form continued into Wimbledon, Hewitt making the fourth round for the second successive year before facing world number 1 and first seed Roger Federer, a match that Federer took 7-6(7), 6-2, 6-4.\n\nAfter Wimbledon Hewitt elected to miss the Montreal and Cincinnati Masters in an effort to give his hip sufficient rest to enable him to play at the 2008 Beijing Olympics where he defeated Jonas Bjorkman in the first round 7-5 7-6(7-2) before losing to second seed Rafael Nadal 6-1 6-2. However the more notable incident in the olympics occurred in Hewitt's opening round doubles match with Chris Guccione against Argentines Juan Monaco and Agustin Calleri. The match went to an advantage 3rd set with Hewitt and Gucicone prevailing 18-16.\n\nAfter the Olympics due to the further damage Hewitt's hip sustained at the Olympics, he was left with no option but to pull out of the US open and skip the rest of the season to have hip surgery.\n\nWorld ranking\n\nOn 19 November 2001, Hewitt became the youngest male ever to be ranked World number one (20 years old). He stayed No. 1 until 28 April 2003, a streak of 75 weeks. After two weeks ranked second, he returned to No. 1 for five weeks. Since then, his highest ranking has been No. 2. As of 8 September 2008, Hewitt is world No. 59.\n\nDavis Cup\n\nHewitt was a part of the Australian Davis Cup Team that won the Davis Cup in 1999 and 2003 and reached the final in 2000 and 2001. By the age of 22, he had recorded more wins in Davis Cup singles than any other Australian player.\n\nIn 2003, Hewitt led the Australian team to victory when he defeated Juan Carlos Ferrero in the opening rubber 3–6, 6–3, 3–6, 7–6, 6–2.\n\nIn the 2006 quarterfinals in Melbourne, Hewitt defeated Belarusian Vladimir Voltchkov 6–2, 6–1, 6–2 in just 91 minutes. Voltchkov said before the match that \"Hewitt has no weapons to hurt me.\" Hewitt responded, \"Voltchkov doesn't have a ranking [of 457] to hurt me.\" In the semifinals in Buenos Aires on clay, Hewitt lost to Argentine Jose Acasuso 1–6, 6–4, 4–6, 6–2, 6–1.\n\nIn February 2007, Australia led by Hewitt lost in the first round to Belgium in Belgium on clay. Hewitt lost to then World No. 41 Kristof Vliegen, and his teammate Chris Guccione also lost his first singles match. Although Hewitt won both his doubles match with Paul Hanley and singles match against Olivier Rochus to get Australia back in contention, Guccione could not prevent an Australian first round exit, their first since 2004.\n\nCoaches\n\nDarren Cahill, Jason Stoltenberg and Roger Rasheed are all former coaches of his. Hewitt is currently coached by Tony Roche [cite web|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/07/18/sports/AS-SPT-TEN-Hewitt-Roche.php|title=Lleyton Hewitt hires celebrated tennis coach Tony Roche|work=International Herald Tribune|date=2007-07-18|accessdate=2007-07-19] .\n\nPlaying style\n\nHewitt is a defensive baseline counterpuncher. He typically likes to stay back towards the baseline during a rally and will usually approach the net only to catch a short reply or drop shot from his opponent. His strength is his return game and he is often described as being among the best returners of serve in the game. Although he doesn't have the devastating return of Andre Agassi who is often regarded as the best returner of serve ever, at the 2004 Cincinnati Masters final commentator MaliVai Washington said that Hewitt was even more difficult to \"ace\" than Agassi because he gets more returns in play. Hewitt's tactics typically involve putting difficult service returns in play, consistently chasing down attempted winning shots from his opponent, and waiting for his opponent to make an error.\n\nAlthough he is known primarily as a baseline defender, Hewitt is actually a skilled volleyer and is known for having one of the best overhead smashes in the game. He also has underrated variety in his shots and will occasionally use a drop shot or drop volley to win a point. His signature shot however is the offensive topspin lob, a shot that he executes efficiently off both wings when his opponent approaches the net. US Davis Cup captain Patrick McEnroe and Jim Courier have both described Hewitt's lob as being the best in the world.\n\nHowever the area which has plagued Hewitt his whole career and has prevented him from achieving further success is his serve. The main problem with Hewitt's serve is that it is very flat and this does not give him much margin for error. Hewitt's height also means that he hits his serve with a lower projectile and this reduces his serve's effectiveness. Also, Hewitt's inability to hit a consistent 'kick' serve (rather he opts for a faster, riskier, slice serve) on his second serve often leads to him hitting numerous double faults. When serving to the deuce court, Hewitt frequently chooses to deliver a wide, sliced serve on his second serve. While this serve often forces return errors from his opponents, it is relatively risky and is a source of many of Hewitt's double faults. Throughout his career, Hewitt has made the decision to go strictly for aces and service winners on his first serve. Since 2005, he has powered up his first serve by lifting weights to become stronger and he is capable of serving up to 125mph. Although this does often allow him to achieve many aces in a match for a player his height (5' 10 1/2\"), it lowers his serving percentage substantially. Hewitt often has a first serve percentage below 50%. His service motion he rocks his forward foot back (ala Pete Sampras) but then twists his feet sideways and launches into the court off of his toes. This unusual technique often causes Hewitt to \"foot fault\" in many of his matches because his left foot can easily go over the line. An interesting fact about Hewitt's serve is that he has an odd tendency to look at his opponent right before making impact with the ball on his serve.\n\nHewitt is known for his tenacity. More than once, he has been close to losing a match in straight sets only to come back and win. For example, in the 2003 Davis Cup semifinal against Switzerland in Melbourne, Australia, Roger Federer served for the match, and came within two points of victory, in the third set. Hewitt came back to win 5–7, 2–6, 7–6(4), 7–5, 6–1.\n\nHewitt is a huge fan of the Rocky films. In his junior years, he was often heard saying \"Come on Balboa\" after winning crucial points in his matches. [cite web | url= http://www.lleytonhewitt.biz/p72002.htm | title= Rocky is my inspiration, says Hewitt | publisher = lleytonhewitt.biz | accessdate= 2007-07-11] As a senior player, he is still heard shouting \"Come on\" at turning points during matches, often simultaneously pointing his fingers at his face for added effect.\n\nControversies\n\nIn a five set match with James Blake at the 2001 US Open, Hewitt complained to umpire Andres Egli and asked for a black linesman to be moved after being called for two foot-faults in the third set. \"Look at him,\" Hewitt said, gesturing at the linesman. He approached the chair umpire and, pointing first to the offending linesman and then to Blake, said,\"Look at him and you tell me what the similarity is.\" Some witnesses, including Blake, had suggested that the \"similarity\" referred to the colour shared by Blake and the linesman. [cite web| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/tennis/2001/us_open/news/2001/09/01/hewitt_folo/|date=2001-09-01|accessdate=2007-07-11|title=Hewitt won't be fined|publisher=CNN Sports Illustrated] Hewitt claimed he had merely pointed out that the same linesman had foot-faulted him on both occasions, while other officials had made no such calls.\n\nDuring the 2001 French Open he was fined US$1000 for calling the chair umpire, Andreas Egli, a \"spastic.\" Hewitt denied this. [cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0DEFD9123FF936A35755C0A9679C8B63&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all|title=No Stopping a Fit, Strong and Relentless Agassi|date=2001-06-05|publisher=NY Times|accessdate=2008-01-20] [cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/low/tennis/us_open/2225598.stm|title=Hewitt faces test of nerve|date=2002-08-31|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=2008-01-20]\n\nHewitt blamed his losses at the 2005 and 2006 Australian Open on uncooperative maintenance of the courts by the tournament directors. \"I don't think there's been a lot of homework done on how the balls play on this surface,\" he said. \"Mate, it could be slower than the French Open.\" Hewitt was disappointed that the organisers had ignored his concerns about the courts. \"I feel like I'm fighting with people that we should be working together to try and make Australian tennis better,\" he said. [cite web| url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2006/01/20/1551401.htm | title= Hewitt says court contributed to loss|publisher=ABC News Online| date=2006-01-20 |accessdate=2007-07-29] Since then, long-time Australian Open chief executive Paul McNamee has resigned, leaving new tournament director Craig Tiley to confirm that the main aim for 2007 was to provide \"uniformity and consistency\" when the stadium's match and practice courts were resurfaced in November 2006. The courts will be as fast as they were in the second week of the 2006 tournament, which should suit Hewitt's game better.
