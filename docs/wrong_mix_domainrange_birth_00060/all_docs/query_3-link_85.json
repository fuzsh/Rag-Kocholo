        "text": "The Grand Slams, the Grand Slam players, professional tennis and some ideas to consider. I have just spent three weeks at the Wimbledon Championships and attended the Qualifying event at Roehampton and the two weeks of the Championship main draws. Kazakhstan had five players playing the qualifying event (all reached the last round), four players in the main draw of the singles, two in main draw of the doubles and three others in the main draw of the juniors. Two of the players in the qualifying stayed at my house near the All England Club and we had the chance to discuss professional tennis and how hard it is for players ranked between 150 and 300 to make a living. It was a very busy three weeks and today as I wait for my flight back to Astana, I have had the chance to reflect on a few things related to the Grand Slams and the overall level of play in the qualifying and junior events. I also saw an interview of Novak Djokovic during Wimbledon when he spoke about the need to increase the base of professional players, providing the opportunity for more players to make a living and also the need to market the sport and to have greater participation as recreational players and spectators among younger people. A good friend of mine and former top Irish players, Conor Niland who got as high as 125 ATP and who qualified for two grand slams, also released a book just before Wimbledon called ‚Äú the racket‚Äù about life on the lower level professional tour and how hard that life is. The need to ensure that the top 300 men and women can make a good living is something I have written a lot about before and it was part of my platform In 2019 when I ran for ITF president. I have a few suggestions related to the Slams and Professional tennis in general and the promotion of the sport globally that I think could make the situation for these players better in the future (see the article I published in 2021 entitled ‚Äú if the system of pro tennis is broken‚Ä¶.then lets fix it‚Äù https://lnkd.in/dmC6MZkC Before I give my suggestions about this matter, I want the reader to think about this: -In the big 7 (The Slams including LTA), the ATP and WTA and the ITF, there are over 2400 full time employees on salaries. -There are over 1600 international level umpires of white badge or better who make at least $750 per week plus expenses. -Yet here are only 130 men and 120 women in singles and 30 men and women in doubles who make enough prizemoney to cover their costs which are around $200,000 per year if they travel with a coach. The rest of the players lose money. The way the general public views a good professional tennis player is one that plays in the Grand Slams. These players are respected but it currently only relates to 128 players.

It was 18 months before I joined the ITF and at the time I was living in Maidstone Kent and at age 30 was the owner of an indoor tennis and fitness Center with 6 indoor courts, a fitness Center, aerobics studio and bar, over 1000 members and a staff of around 30 people. They were great times and I brought in 5 coaches from Ireland including Pete Lowther, Mark French, Ken Cashin and Conor Casey. We had a great team and achieved a lot. I was sponsored by Peugeot and even had a sponsored 205 GTI car with my name on it!!! We produced some very good players that went on to be top national and internationally ranked like Abbie Tordoff and Oliver Freelove. Good times! I sold the Tennis Center to a Leisure Group in 1997. Adrian Mole who was involved as coach/player at that time is still working as the Head Coach all these years later. 88 was the last year I ran my residential tennis camps in Ireland at Wesley College. A great team of players/coaches were involved there too. Can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs over 35 years ago!!!ü§¶üèΩ‚ôÄÔ∏è\n\nI‚Äôm in the beautiful city of Almaty today where we are hosting back tonight back junior ITF events. The J200 starts today and it is very strong with many overseas players participating. Yesterday afternoon we had a meeting with 20 of our top 18 and under players who are part of the KTF supported program. The emphasis of the meeting was on quality, intensity and the focus needed in practice to reach their performance and ranking goals. The need for sacrifice and hard work on and off the court. The previous 2 days I attended our 12 and under national camp in Shymkent. It was great to have the chance to see the level of the players and to spend time with their private coaches. If that wasn‚Äôt enough to organise in the same week, we are also holding an ITF 1 coaches course with 24 of our young and enthusiastic coaches taking part. I attended the course during the week which is being conducted by Irena Chichmerova and Ruslan Areprintsev. I also attended the official dinner on Saturday where I thanked them for being open to improve and develop themselves. I told them this learning should never stop and every day is a school day and I continue to learn even after 30+ years in the coaching business. We also host the first international wheelchair tennis open in Almaty starting on Wednesday and next year we will be part of the ITF WTT for wheelchair tennis. This week I attended the press conference to announce the KPMG sponsorship of the event. Next week I head to london where Kazakhstan has 6 players in Wimbledon mens and womens qualifying, 4 direct into singles, 2 others in doubles and 4 players in the junior 18 and under event. I have a house 15 minute walk from the All England Club and I‚Äôm looking forward to spending time at home (hopefully my kids have not changed the locks) while watching our top pro and junior players participate at Wimbledon.\n\nIt‚Äôs been a very busy few weeks in Kazakhstan as we hosted the Asia Oceania qualifying for Junior Davis Cup and Junior BJK cup in Shymkent. 16 of the top teams from the two regions took part and the level of the event was very high with many players ranked inside the top 100 ITF Junior rankings participating. In the girl‚Äôs event, our team finished 7th but lost a very close quarter final to the Australian girls that would have qualified us for the world finals, with both singles being won by Australia in three close sets. Australia went on to finish 1st. In the boy‚Äôs event, the Kazakh team beat a strong Chinese team in the group stages and then beat Australia, only dropping 4 games in two singles matches to qualify for the World top 16 team finals. The team followed this with a win over Hong Kong in the semi final before losing a close final to a strong Japanese team in the deciding doubles, 10-6 in the champions tie break. In the past two years we have played Australia four times in the 16 and under qualifying and won three of the matches. To do this against a Grand Slam nation with Kazakh born players highlights the improved level of Kazakhstan tennis. Congratulations to our boy‚Äôs and girl‚Äôs teams for representing the country so well and to the two captains, former Grand Slam doubles champion Yaroslava Shvedova whose team qualified in 2023 and Sergey Kvak whose teams have qualified for the world finals for each of the past three years. During the boy‚Äôs event, I travelled for one day to Almaty to attend our 14 and under national training camp which was conducted by Hrvoje Smajic, my former colleague at the ITF, along with our KTF player development coaches. 20 of our top boys and girls and their private coaches had the chance to benefit from this intensive camp and the many on court and off court initiatives set up by Hrvoje. Now I‚Äôm back in Astana where our national 12 and under team is preparing to travel to Dushambe, Tadjikistan, for the Asian 12 and under Championships and where our older players are preparing for two Junior ITF events, a J100 followed by a J200, that we will host in Almaty starting June 10th.\n\nA FAREWELL TO BRIAN TOBIN I heard the sad news this week that Brian Tobin, the former ITF and Tennis Australia President had passed away aged 93. Brian was a great tennis person who had been ranked in the top 10 in Australia at a time that Australia was dominating tennis and as a player, played the Grand Slams in doubles. I have so many positive memories of Brian as I was very lucky to have worked at the ITF during his time as President. He became President at the ITF AGM in June 1991, replacing Philippe Chattrier, and I was hired by Doug MacCurdy as Development Manager in December of that year. It was an amazing time to be at the ITF. The headquarters was at the historic Queens Club in Barons Court London. The other people at the top of the organization at that time were: ‚Ä¢ Mike Davies, former top player ranked number 6 in the World who was General manager and Commercial Director. He had previously worked for the ATP and WCT. ‚Ä¢ Thomas Hallberg was in charge of Davis Cup and had played Grand Slams and Davis Cup for Sweden (he had also been CEO of Swedish Tennis and had helped set up Tennis Europe in the 70s) ‚Ä¢ Debbie Jevans (who is now chairman of the AELTC) was running women‚Äôs tennis and BJK Cup and who had been last 16 of Wimbledon twice. ‚Ä¢ Bill Babcock was in charge of men‚Äôs tennis and he was a former Satellite players who had worked for the men‚Äôs player council. ‚Ä¢ Sally Holdsworth, who had played Wimbledon many times, was in charge of HR and office Admin. ‚Ä¢ Chris Stokes was Commercial Director and with Mike Davies had raised large revenues by putting in place a wide range of sponsors for the ITF events. ‚Ä¢ Doug MacCurdy was Director of Development and had worked for the USTA and had played on the satellite pro tour. Because I played tennis with some of them, I was lucky enough to be invited from time to time to lunch at Queens club and I would sit there listening to discussions about the future of the ITF and of international tennis, afraid to speak as there was so much tennis knowledge present and I did not want to embarrass myself. Mike and Chris had been so successful in signing a TV deal for Davis Cup in 1995 that Brian sent a memo to ask how we were going to spend the money. In the end Brian and the Board agreed to distribute 50% of the end of year profits as a dividend to the member nations which continued until he finished as President. The ITF was probably at its strongest as that moment financially and in terms of its influence on the future direction of tennis. In the 90s, the ITF and the Grand Slams were very much aligned, and it was the time of the Grand Slam Cup which was owned by the Slams and run by the ITF. The fact that the Grand Slams and the ITF were united on most things was a big part due to Brian‚Äôs strength as a leader and his political skills.

I was a candidate for ITF President, and he wanted to discuss with me how Tennis could contribute to the efforts to limit climate change and global warming. He lost the US Presidential election in 2000 to George Bush by a very small number of votes. During our time together he asked me how my campaign was going and then he joked with me that he was ‚Äúa Recovering Politician‚Äù! Over the past 6 years I have been actively involved in Tennis politics-running for ITF President and ITF Board in 2019 and in 2023 running for the ITF board as Tennis Irelands candidate. However, at the ITF AGM in Cancun in September I lost the board election by just 2 votes. Now I want to say here congratulations to the 14 people that were elected to the Board and I wish them all the best for the next 4 years and hope they can help to make the ITF a more effective and successful organization and stronger as the controlling body of tennis. I have to say that it was tough to lose so closely the election, like losing an important tennis match after having match points. For a while it‚Äôs hard to put the loss in perspective. But luckily, I have a great family and so many friends and with the help of a special Rioja red wine vaccine, I was able to put the loss behind me quickly! I have, since November, immersed myself again in my role as Tennis Director of Kazakhstan Tennis and am enjoying very much what I am doing and the impact I think my team are having on Player development here. In 2023 we finished 9th and 10th in Junior Davis and BJK cup, in 2022 we were 4th in WJT finals and we also had 5 Kazakh juniors playing the Australian Open with one 16 years old boy, Amir Omarkhanov, reaching the quarter finals of the singles. Our National under 14 championships just finished, we are also hosting an ITF level 2 Coaches course and the second week of J60 junior ITF events. Meanwhile, our Davis Cup team was in Argentina and without the top 3 players, lost a close match 3/2 after having match points in the last singles. A very tough loss. It‚Äôs a very busy time! I admit it- I am a recovering Tennis Politician‚Ä¶..but it‚Äôs not so bad!!\n\nA recovering Tennis Politician!!! In 2019 I met with Al Gore, former US Vice President.

I admit it- I am a recovering Tennis Politician‚Ä¶..but it‚Äôs not so bad!!\n\nAnother busy period for Kazakhstan tennis. On Saturday I attended the finals of our J100 ITF event in Almaty where we had 3 Kazakh players in the singles finals. We also made a special presentation to our player Zangar Nurlanay who in 2022 was awarded the Tennis Europe overseas player of the year finishing the year at ranking number 9, having captured 11 under 14 titles. Sundar I flew to Shymkent where we are hosting the 12 teams that qualified for the finals of the ITF Asian 12 and under team event. Our Davis Cup team is now in Sofia preparing for the Davis Cup match versus Bulgaria next weekend but the great news coming Saturday night from New York was that Anna Danilina, together with Finnish partner Harry Heliovarra, had captured the US open mixed doubles, Anna‚Äôs first grand slam title. It was great that KTF president Bulat Utemeretov was in New York to see the final and support Anna in this important match. Our ATP 250 event, won by Novak Djokovic in 2022, starts September 25 and KTF attention is focusing on this to ensure that we have a great event here is Astana. It‚Äôs busy period‚Ä¶but a pretty good time for Kazakh tennis!üòá\n\nAnother very busy and successful weekend for Kazakhstan tennis! The ATP Challenger finished yesterday in Astana with Kazakhstan‚Äôs Denis Yeseyev surviving cramps in the third set to win a very long and close final 6/4 in the third set. This was his first ATP challenger singles title and he showed real character and fighting spirit throughout the week. I believe Denis can be playing Grand Slam qualifying soon and can make a breakthrough over the next 12 months. From that final, I headed across town to our other indoor tennis center to attend the closing ceremony of the National Wheelchair Tennis championships. We only introduced wheelchair tennis officially 18 months ago (with the help of Mark Bullock who visited then) and it was great to see that it has come a long way since then thanks mostly to the drive, passion and enthusiasm of KTF wheelchair tennis manager Sergey. It was great to see so many smiling faces and seeing how tennis can impact positively on people‚Äôs lives. Our key objective is to qualify to play in the Asian Paralympics and World Team Cup in 2027 and to be represented in the Paralympic Games in 2028. As the day went on, we also got more good news from our players playing in European pro and junior events finals taking place this weekend. Anna Danilina captured the WTA 250 doubles title in Hamburg, and our junior player, Satima Toregan, captured the singles title at the 16 and under Tennis Europe Muller Junior Cup in Ulm in Germany. Yaroslav Pshenichniy and Mansur Sainov won the doubles title in the 14 and under boy‚Äôs event at the same event in Ulm. Yerkezhan Zhanatayeva won the 14 and under singles with Adiya runner up in doubles. Eva Korysgeva, who is travelling as part of the ITF team, won the 16 and under doubles in Anesy, France. This was Eva‚Äôs second doubles title in two weeks, and she also was singles semi-finalist in Stade France Category 1 event two weeks ago. Well done to all! This week we have combined men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs 25k events in Astana and so no down time again. As I say always to people working with me-Tennis is not a job. It‚Äôs a way of life!"
