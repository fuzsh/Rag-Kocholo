        "text": "Menâ€™s international friendly: Australia v Wales\n\nVenue: AAMI Park, Melbourne Date: Saturday, 13 July Kick off: 10:45 BST\n\nCoverage: Listen on BBC Radio Wales, Radio Cymru, BBC Sounds, the BBC Sport website and app, plus live text commentary, followed by report and reaction on the BBC Sport website and app.\n\nFor a first professional start, facing Australia in Sydney and the world's most capped prop in history might seem a daunting prospect for many.\n\nBut it is a task Wales prop Archie Griffin took in his stride as he played most of the 25-16 defeat at the Allianz Stadium.\n\nThe Bath front row came up against Wallabies veteran James Slipper, who was starting his 135th international, eclipsing the record of most internationals for a prop held by Gethin Jenkins.\n\nGriffin's achievement was poignant because it occurred in the city he was born almost 23 years ago.\n\nHis family moved to Singapore but the ties to Australia remain strong.\n\nGriffin, whose parents are both Welsh with his father brought up in Cardiff and mother born in Wrexham, was cheered on by family and friends.\n\n\"I loved it,\" said Griffin.\n\n\"You dream to be here. With the games being in Australia and what this place means to me, it sweetens the deal and something I was aiming for.\n\n\"It meant a lot to me. Mum and Dad came out for the game so that was special. Mum is a bit of a crier!\n\n\"We have family and friends here, so it was nice to catch up with them.\"\n\nSolving a problem position\n\nWales have travelled to Melbourne where they will try and level the two-Test series next Saturday.\n\nThe tourists are now due to announce their side on Thursday and there are injury concerns over full-back Liam Williams, prop Gareth Thomas and number eight Aaron Wainwright.\n\nGriffin is expected to feature again after Warren Gatland described him as \"outstanding\".\n\nThe Wales head coach says tight-head prop is a problem position as he searches for a successor to Tomas Francis, currently unavailable for selection after moving to play club rugby in France last year.\n\nHenry Thomas, Keiron Assiratti and Leon Brown were ruled out of the summer tour because of injury, while Dillon Lewis was unavailable for the first Test.\n\nThese absentees paved the way for Griffin, who came through the Welsh Exiles programme and played for Wales under-18s and under-20s and rose through the ranks at Bath.\n\nGriffin had never started a professional game before last weekend with 191 replacement appearance minutes for Bath in the 2023-24 season.\n\nA brief stint on his Test debut against England at Twickenham in February was cut short through injury.\n\nA player making his first senior start for country before his club provides a telling example of the inexperienced Wales side currently being blooded by Gatland.\n\nGriffin managed 74 minutes against the Wallabies before being replaced by Harri O'Connor.\n\n\"I got a lot of game time so I was chuffed to bits,\" said Griffin.\n\n\"It has been a while since I played 74 minutes, probably a university game.\"\n\nGatland says 'it's where we are' as Wales hit new low\n\nHathaway reveals emotions of first Wales cap\n\nWales win in Melbourne needed to salvage series\n\nTopping the tackle chart\n\nThere was a tough examination in the scrum which Griffin believes Wales improved as the game progressed.\n\n\"There are things to work on in the scrum,\" said Griffin.\n\n\"We came in at half-time made some changes and were better in the second half.\"\n\nIt is in the loose where he excelled, topping the tackle charts with 26 and also demonstrating his ball-carrying potential.\n\n\"It seems a lot of tackles,\" said Griffin.\n\n\"Defence is important, it is the start of our attack and you need to get off the line so we can get the ball back.\"\n\nThe defeat in Sydney was an eighth successive Test match loss for Wales with no international victory since they beat World Cup pool opponents Georgia nine months ago.\n\nWales have dropped to 11th in the world rankings, a lowest-ever position, but Griffin insists morale remains high within the squad as they aim to level the series.\n\n\"We are not going to be down after this,\" said Griffin.\n\n\"We have got things to work on and are disappointed with the loss, but it's now onto the next game and we are aiming for that win.\n\n\"We need to make more of the chances created but we're getting there. We have to keep going, we are building for something.\""
