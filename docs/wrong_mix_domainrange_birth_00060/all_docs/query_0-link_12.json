He reached the semis of the US Open, but got pummeled by del Potro. He didn't win\n\nIt's Christmas night and 2010 is almost over. Let's take a look back at the year in review. Roger Federer wins the Australian Open. The year began with an earthquake in Haiti. Roger Federer and tournament organizers got several pros, including Rafael Nadal, Lleyton Hewitt, and Kim Clijsters to play in a charity event just\n\nPrognosticators always like to make predictions about what the future holds. Who will win the various Slams? They guess months before it happens. It's fun, but hardly realistic. You just don't know. A player can be an injury away from not having any sort of year at all. Two prominent players who had a very\n\nWhen 2009 wrapped up, those with crystal balls were predicting a much different 2010. For one, Juan Martin del Potro had just won the US Open.

He was the son of academics. His father, a professor of philosophy who graduated from Cornell University (and Ithaca, home of the Big Red was DFW's birthplace). His mother, an English professor. He'd study both in college having an affinity for the\n\nSome years are notable because a player no one has ever heard of makes a huge leap, and they become a household name. 2007 was that year for Novak Djokovic who reached the semis of the French and Wimbledon, almost barely noticed because of the Federer-Nadal rivalry, and then made the finals of the US\n\nEvery year, lazy American college football sports columnists trot out the same old, same old. For American college football, this \"write\" of passage is the column railing against the BCS. The BCS was a group/system created a little over 10 years ago to ensure the \"best\" team played the \"second best\" team for Division 1\n\nWe're down to two more tournaments. This week starts the BNP Paribas Masters which is also known as the Paris Indoors. It's the last of the 9 Masters 1000 events.
