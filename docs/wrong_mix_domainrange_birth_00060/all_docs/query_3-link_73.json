        "text": "TENNIS\n\nMELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — Marat Safin defeated Lleyton Hewitt 1-6, 6-3, 6-4, 6-4 Sunday night to win the Australian Open and deflate a crowd hungering for an Australian winner. This was the Russian’s second Grand Slam tournament title, his other coming at the 2000 U.S. Open against Pete Sampras in the final.\n\nSafin, who defeated top-ranked Roger Federer in the semifinals, was called the worthiest of champions by Hewitt.\n\nHewitt was hoping to be the first Australian man to win the national championship since Mark Edmondson in 1976. And he seemed in command and on his way in the first set, making only one unforced error. He led 3-0 in the third set and Safin was on the edge, smashing his racket into the court three times in eight points.\n\nIn the women’s final on Saturday, Serena Williams rallied for a 2-6, 6-3, 6-0 victory over Lindsay Davenport in the Australian Open final Saturday for her first Grand Slam title in 18 months. She also extended her winning streak at this event to 14 matches.\n\nBASEBALL\n\nNEW YORK (AP) — Roger Clemens picked up his latest Cy Young Award at the annual New York baseball dinner Sunday night.\n\nEarlier this month, the 42-year-old pitcher agreed to an $18 million contract with his hometown Houston Astros, choosing to return for at least one more season. He said one factor was a long chat he had with friend and teammate Andy Pettitte, who told Clemens that his rehabilitation from elbow surgery was progressing nicely.\n\nThe Rocket ended a brief retirement last offseason to join Pettitte in Houston and went 18-4 with a 2.98 ERA and 218 strikeouts, earning his record seventh Cy Young Award — first in the National League.\n\nBASKETBALL\n\nNASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Ashley McElhiney, the first female coach of a men’s pro basketball team, was fired Saturday night after an on-court dispute with the co-owner of the Nashville Rhythm of the ABA.\n\nCo-owner and CEO Sally Anthony was unhappy that McElhiney was playing Matt Freije after Anthony instructed that he be benched.\n\nThe argument over the former Vanderbilt star’s playing time began during the third quarter and apparently escalated when Anthony attempted to remove McElhiney as coach during the team’s 110-109 win over the Kansas City Knights. Anthony was eventually restrained by security guards and taken off the floor.\n\nGOLF\n\nLA QUINTA, Calif. (AP) — Justin Leonard shot a 5-under 67 Sunday to overtake the faltering Joe Ogilvie and win the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic.\n\nLeonard finished the 90-hole tournament at 28-under 332, three shots in front of Ogilvie and South Africa’s Tim Clark. Ogilvie, winless in six years on the tour, closed with a 73. Clark shot a 69.\n\nComing off his worst year since joining the tour full-time in 1995, Leonard rolled in six birdie putts and had just one bogey in the final round at PGA West’s Palmer Course.\n\nThe 1997 British Open champion began the day three shots behind the front-running Ogilvie, who had been tied for the lead or alone at the top since the opening round of the five-day event. Leonard earned $846,000 for his ninth PGA Tour title.\n\nKAHUKU, Hawaii (AP) — Hale Irwin became the first player to win a men’s professional tour event five straight times, easily holding off Dana Quigley by five strokes in the Champions Tour’s Turtle Bay Championship.\n\nThe 59-year-old Irwin closed with a 5-under 67 for a record 16-under 200 total.\n\nWith his fourth straight win at Turtle Bay and sixth overall title in the event, Irwin pushed his tour-record victory total to 41.\n\nHe had shared the mark of four straight victories in an event with Tiger Woods (Bay Hill Invitational, 2000-03), Gene Sarazen (Miami Open, 1926, 1928-30), Walter Hagen (PGA Championship, 1924-27) and Tom Morris Jr. (British Open, 1868-70, 1872).\n\nIrwin earned $225,000.\n\nSINGAPORE (AP) — England’s Nick Dougherty won his first PGA European Tour title, shooting a 5-under 67 for a five-stroke victory in the Caltex Masters.\n\nThe 22-year-old Dougherty had an 18-under 270 total on the Laguna National’s Masters Course. Scotland’s Colin Montgomerie, the 2004 winner, closed with a 70 to tie for second with Dutchman Maarten Lafeber (69).\n\nDenmark’s Thomas Bjorn (72) finished fourth at 11 under in the tournament co-sanctioned by the Asian Tour.\n\nSKIING\n\nSANTA CATERINA VALFURVA, Italy (AP) — Julia Mancuso gave the U.S. ski team its second medal in two days at the world championships.\n\nShe captured the bronze medal Sunday in a super giant slalom won by Sweden’s Anja Paerson. The third-place finish came a day after Bode Miller took the gold in a men’s super-G to open the competition.\n\nThe team’s goal of eight medals — split evenly between the men and the women — now looks as if it could be surpassed with nine events remaining.\n\nLindsey Kildow finished ninth, 1.18 seconds behind Paerson’s time of 1 minute, 17.64 seconds. Another American, Kirsten Clark, was 10th despite a concussion during training Monday, giving the United States three of the top 10 finishers.\n\nLucia Recchia of Italy earned the silver, 0.45 behind Paerson.\n\nSOCCER\n\nBERLIN (AP) — The first soccer player was implicated in Germany’s widening game-fixing scandal Sunday, and prosecutors charged three men arrested in the case with fraud.\n\nA referee also was replaced for a first-division game Sunday after his name surfaced during the investigation. The German Soccer Federation called the move “purely precautionary” and said it did not suspect Juergen Jansen of fixing games.\n\nMichael Born, the business manager of third-division SC Paderborn, confirmed to The Associated Press his team had informed the federation that one of its players was involved with the Croatian betting group allegedly behind the fixing."
