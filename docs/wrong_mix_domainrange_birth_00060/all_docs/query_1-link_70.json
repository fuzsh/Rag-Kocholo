        "text": "Bec Hewitt and Lleyton Hewitt may be Aussie showbiz royalty in their own right, but it looks like the Hewitt dynasty is set for a whole new revival as their three kids Mia, Cruz, and Ava grow up.\n\nThe apple doesn’t fall far in the Hewitt family, and while Mia and Ava are Bec’s mini-mes, Cruz is growing into a carbon copy of Lleyton.\n\nOver the years, Bec and Lleyton’s kids have starred in a series of exciting campaigns and projects.\n\nIn 2016, Bec and Ava dazzled in front of the camera together as the Christmas ambassadors for Barbie.\n\nThat same year, Mia, Ava and Cruz made their TV debut when they starred in the Wonder Smooth Wholegrain bread commercial.\n\n“The kids did so well, I was very proud,” proud mum and former Home and Away starlet Bec said at the time.\n\nMost recently, Bec and Lleyton’s two daughters have dabbled in modelling while youngest Ava is also a talented dancer and gymnast.\n\nShe showed off her skills on Dancing With The Stars: All Stars when Bec returned to the stage.\n\nAva is also the host of Nick News on Nickelodeon and has recently been nominated for a 2023 Kids Choice Award for Aussie/Kiwi Legend of the Year.\n\nWATCH: Ava Hewitt performs on Dancing With The Stars. Story continues after video.\n\nAs for Cruz, the energetic tyke isn’t just his dad’s look-alike, he’s also taken a keen interest in tennis. Lleyton even reckons we’ll be seeing Cruz make his Australian Open debut very soon.\n\n“Hopefully he gets a chance to play in this great event if he wants to. Hopefully he beats me,” Rusty has mused.\n\nCan you imagine Lleyton getting the chance to commentate as Cruz takes to the court?"
