        "text": "Look back at the highs and lows of Lleyton Hewitt's 18-year professional tennis career.\n\nLleyton Hewitt burst onto the tennis scene as an Adelaide teenager who won his first ATP tour event before quitting school and turning pro.\n\nOver the years, Hewitt repeatedly made the headlines - for good reasons and bad - but the one constant was his incredible determination and self-belief that led fans to keep watching in hopes of a trademark comeback.\n\nTwenty years on, his career comes to a close after two majors, two Davis Cups, 80 weeks at number one and a host of memories.\n\nYoungster qualifies for home major\n\n1997\n\nThe Adelaide teenager made history, becoming the youngest player ever (at 15 years 11 months) to qualify for the Australian Open.\n\nHewitt beat English player Mark Petchey 6-1, 6-4 to seal his place in the men's draw, before losing 6-3, 6-4, 6-3 in the first round to Spain's dual French Open winner Sergi Bruguera.\n\nHewitt makes a splash in Adelaide\n\n1998\n\nHewitt broke through for his first ever ATP title, winning his hometown tournament, the Adelaide International.\n\nOn the way to the final the world number 550-ranked player defeated former world number one Andre Agassi, then beat fellow Australian Jason Stoltenberg to take the title and become the second-youngest player to win an ATP Tour event.\n\nHe soon afterwards left his high school, Immanuel College in Adelaide, and turned professional, prior to his 17th birthday.\n\nAt the end of 1998, he switched coaches, from his junior mentor Peter Smith to former Australian tour pro Darren Cahill.\n\nDavis Cup triumph in year of consolidation\n\n1999\n\nHewitt consolidated his spot on the tour, winning the ATP Delray Beach hardcourt tournament in Florida.\n\nHe defeated Belgium's Xavier Malisse in three sets.\n\nIn December, Hewitt was part of the Australian team that won the Davis Cup for the 22nd time, beating France 3-2 in the final.\n\nHewitt lost both singles rubbers but Mark Philippoussis sealed victory with a four-set win over Cedric Pioline.\n\nAnger at crowd as Hewitt courts controversy\n\n2000\n\nHewitt started the year in winning form, taking out his home tournament, the Adelaide International.\n\nHowever he generated controversy along the way, when he got angry that the crowd was cheering for fellow Australian Dejan Petrovic - after his 6-0, 6-2 win, Hewitt referred to the \"stupidity of the Australian public\", saying they \"always knock the better players\".\n\nAt Wimbledon, Hewitt made it to his first ever final at a grand slam event, partnering his then-girlfriend, Kim Clijsters in the mixed doubles.\n\nHewitt and Clijsters lost in the final to American pair Kimberley Po and Donald Johnson.\n\nLater that year, Hewitt made the semi-finals of the US Open and claimed his first grand slam doubles title in New York, pairing with Belarussian Max Mirnyi to defeat South Africa's Ellis Ferreira and American Rick Leach in the final at Flushing Meadows.\n\nHewitt was part of the Australian team that made the Davis Cup final for the second year running, only to lose to Spain in Barcelona.\n\nHe won four titles for the year - Adelaide, the Sydney International, Queen's Club in London and Scottsdale, Arizona - and at the age of 19 Hewitt finished the 2000 season as the top-ranked Australian player, at number seven in the world.\n\nLinesman bust-ups, Flushing Meadows triumph\n\n2001\n\nIt was a year of ups and downs for Hewitt.\n\nAt the French Open, the Australian caused a storm of controversy, by referring to Swiss umpire Andreas Egli as a \"spastic\". He apologised the following day.\n\nLater in the season at the US Open, Hewitt's mouth got him in trouble again, as he blamed an African-American linesman for foot-faulting him in a match against James Blake, saying: \"look at him (the linesman) and tell me what the similarity is (gesturing towards Blake).\"\n\nDespite these on-court issues, however, Hewitt went on to win his first singles major title at Flushing Meadows, beating American Pete Sampras 7-6 (7-4), 6-1, 6-1 in a one-sided US Open final.\n\nIn November, he passed Brazil's Gustavo Kuerten to become the world number one. Hewitt finished off a big season by beating Frenchman Sebastien Grosjean in the finals of the season-ending Tennis Masters Cup in Sydney.\n\nHis sixth title of 2001 ensured he was the youngest player (aged 20), and the first Australian, to end the year as the world number one on the ATP rankings.\n\nHewitt and Australia qualified for a third straight Davis Cup final, but Australia lost the fifth and final rubber to lose to France 3-2 at Melbourne Park.\n\nAt the end of the year Hewitt hired Jason Stoltenberg - the man he had beaten to win his first ever tour title in 1998 - as his coach.\n\nRusty wins Wimbledon\n\n2002\n\nHewitt registered another career highlight at Wimbledon in 2002.\n\nHe came into the tournament off the back of a title win at Queen's Club, and continued his hot form at SW19.\n\nHewitt lost only two sets for the fortnight on the way to beating Argentina's David Nalbandian on Centre Court for the men's singles title.\n\nThe Australian also won at Indian Wells and San Jose, then he successfully defended his title at the season finale Tennis Masters Cup in Shanghai, beating Juan Carlos Ferrero in the final.\n\nThe South Australian finished the year as world number one for the second straight year.\n\nTough year sees Hewitt dumped in Wimbledon first round\n\n2003\n\nHewitt made history for the wrong reasons at Wimbledon where he became the first defending men's singles champion in the open era to lose in the first round, ousted by qualifier Ivo Karlovic.\n\nHe won two tournaments for the year, at Scottsdale and Indian Wells, but his year was disrupted by injury.\n\nHis 75-week reign as world number one was ended by Andre Agassi in April, and although he regained top spot briefly the following month, he would end the year ranked 17 in the world.\n\nPrior to Wimbledon, Hewitt took on Roger Rasheed as his new coach.\n\nIt may have been a tough year for Hewitt individually, but he added another honour to his collection in November when he was part of the Australian team that won the Davis Cup.\n\nHewitt had come back from two sets to love down to beat Switzerland's Roger Federer in the semi-final, before beating Juan Carlos Ferrero in Australia's 3-1 win over Spain in the final.\n\nRise up the rankings as Hewitt wins four titles\n\n2004\n\nFaced with fewer injury problems, Hewitt rose back up the rankings to number three in the world behind the new number one, Roger Federer.\n\nHe had a successful 2004, with tournament wins in Sydney, Rotterdam, Washington and Long Island.\n\nBut Federer proved to be Hewitt's nemesis all year, beating him at the Australian Open (fourth round), Wimbledon (QF), in the final at the US Open - and, for good measure, in the final of the Tennis Masters Cup.\n\nHewitt ended the year ranked number three.\n\nAnguish as Hewitt misses out on Australian Open\n\n2005\n\nHe started the year in good form with a win in the Sydney International, beating Czech Republic's Ivo Minar in the final.\n\nHewitt then had his best ever run at the 2005 Australian Open.\n\nHe reached the final after a draining series of matches - he played a total of 14 sets against Rafael Nadal, David Nalbandian and Andy Roddick to get from the round of 16 to the decider.\n\nBut Hewitt failed to become the first Australian to win the men's singles since Mark Edmondson in 1976 - he won the first set but went down in four sets to Russian Marat Safin.\n\nHe went on to make the semi-finals at Wimbledon and the US Open, but missed the French Open due to injury.\n\nHe reached number two in the rankings early in 2005 but finished the year at number five.\n\nOff the court, Hewitt married Bec Cartwright in July.\n\nHewitt wins again at Queens\n\n2006\n\nHewitt reached the third round at the Australian Open, the fourth round at Roland Garros, and made the quarter-finals at Wimbledon and the US Open.\n\nHe had one tournament win for the season, his fourth triumph - an equal record - at Queen's Club.\n\nHis year-ending ranking dropped to number 20 in the world.\n\nCoach changes in year of transition\n\n2007\n\nThe year started with a change, as Roger Rasheed quit as Hewitt's coach just prior to the Australian Open.\n\nHewitt used Scott Draper as his temporary coach, then in the middle of 2007 he announced the hire of Australian Tony Roche - the 14-time grand slam title winner (one singles, 13 doubles) and one-time world number two - as his coach.\n\nIn March, Hewitt won his only title of the year, in Las Vegas, beating Austria's Jurgen Melzer in the final.\n\nHis best result in a grand slam event was the fourth round at the French Open and Wimbledon.\n\nBleary-eyed Hewitt beats Baghdatis\n\n2008\n\nAt the Australian Open, Hewitt pushed the definition of \"late finish\", when he and Marcos Baghdatis produced an epic third round clash.\n\nThe match started just before midnight, and when Hewitt sealed a five-set win with a down-the-line forehand winner, the clock had reached 4.34am local time in Melbourne.\n\nHewitt lost in the fourth round to eventual winner, Novak Djokovic.\n\nAt the Beijing Olympics, Hewitt beat Jonas Bjorkman before losing in the second round of the men's singles to Rafael Nadal. He also partnered Chris Guccione in the men's doubles - they lost in the quarter-finals to Bob and Mike Bryan of the United States.\n\nHewitt struggled all year with a hip injury.
