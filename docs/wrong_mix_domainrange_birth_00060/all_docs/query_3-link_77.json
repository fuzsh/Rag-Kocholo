        "text": "Kyrgios on Monday revealed how regular message exchanges with Hewitt have given him greater confidence and self-belief.\n\nThe Canberra-born right-hander is keen use those words of wisdom as motivation to back up his breakout performances at Wimbledon and the US Open this year.\n\n“I would have never have pictured how my relationship with Lleyton is now,” said Kyrgios, who teamed with Hewitt at the inaugural Indian Premier Tennis League a fortnight ago.\n\n“I was watching the guy on television a couple of years ago and I’d never miss his matches, and now we’ve played premier league and Davis Cup together.\n\n“Our relationship is really good and we always send WhatsApp messages to each other.\n\n“Just to think that we are close like this now, it’s pretty crazy.\n\n“I know that he is going to be someone who is supporting me for as long as he is involved in the game, which is really positive.\n\n“Lleyton has been great on advice about the Australian Open too, because he always puts a lot of pressure on himself to perform and play well in front of the home crowd.\n\n“So it will be good for a few of us guys to make a run. The atmosphere is going to be unbelievable, but there is definitely pressure there.\n\n“But I feel like I’m ready for it.”\n\nKyrgios may be in the peak of his fitness now, but he admits this wasn’t the case this time last year.\n\nHe admits he struggled to train for more than two hours in his first full campaign as a professional, but his fitness levels have increased considerably as a result of three-hour daily sessions and a ramped up strength and conditioning program.\n\nThe teen star also battled serious arm and elbow injuries, which forced him to prematurely end his first full season in the professional ranks in October.\n\nBut Kyrgios insists this is all a distant memory.\n\n“It has been pretty full-on,” said Kyrgios, speaking at the launch of his new partnership with Malaysia Airlines in Sydney.\n\n“I’ve definitely increased my training a lot and I’m feeling tired and it has taken its toll, but I love that part of it as well.\n\n“I think last year I was struggling to back up two-hour sessions every day, but now I’m getting up to two or three hours every day.\n\n“That’s a massive step from where I was. That just means that my body is getting stronger and used to the hours on court.\n\n“That’s a massive confidence boost.\n\n“I’ve also been working with my coach Todd Larkham back in Canberra and I’ve flown a couple of guys from Melbourne to train with me as well, which I’ve been fortunate.\n\n“Guys like Daniel Guccione and James Frawley, just a couple of guys who I’ve grown up with.\n\n“We are training and playing a lot of points, so it’s a lot of fun and it does get competitive too.”\n\nKyrgios has his sights set on next month’s Hopman Cup alongside fellow Aussie Casey Dellacqua.\n\nThe 19-year-old Newcombe Medallist believes the Perth-based event is perfect preparation for the upcoming Sydney International and Australian Open.\n\n“It’s a great warm-up for those two tournaments and it’s a bit of an exhibition, so there won’t be too much pressure,” he said.\n\n“But I still want to go out there and play well in front of the crowd and that atmosphere.\n\n“Playing with Casey will also be a lot of fun. She has had a great year and I’m just going to go out there and enjoy myself.\n\n“The new arena is going to be awesome and I just can’t wait to get out there and entertain the crowd a little bit.\n\n“The Aussie summer is the most exciting time of the year for me.\n\n“Before that I’ll just soak up my time at home over Christmas, before it gets hectic in the next couple of months.”\n\nThere’s no doubting Kyrgios has enjoyed a dream start to his professional career, but he is also desperate to prove he is no one-year wonder.\n\nIt’s why he is desperate to train harder and improve on his second round exit at last year’s Australian Open.\n\n“I definitely want to be known for having consistent results across the board,” he said.\n\n“At this stage of my career it’s hard not to go past that Wimbledon match against Rafa (fourth-round), but I want to keep training hard and keep having some good results.\n\n“I definitely want to get passed where I did last year at the Aussie Open.\n\n“It’s another opportunity and another grand slam, plus it will be my last grand slam as a teenager so I want to do well.”"
