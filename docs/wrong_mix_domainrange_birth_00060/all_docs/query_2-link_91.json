        "text": "Former Home and Away star Bec Hewitt and her husband, tennis legend Lleyton Hewitt, were seated directly behind the Princess of Wales in the exclusive enclosure.\n\nAnd while Kate received a standing ovation upon her arrival at the famed tennis courts, accompanied by daughter Princess Charlotte, locals are understandably more excited at seeing the original Aussie WAG.\n\nBec, 40, wore a black dress patterned with white polka dots to the prestigious event, which she paired with a black blazer.\n\nThe mum-of-three slicked her hair back during the rare appearance, and accessorised with black sunglasses and gold, cross-shaped earrings.\n\nMeanwhile Lleyton, who won 30 singles titles and three doubles titles during his esteemed career, opted for a navy blue suit, white shirt and patterned tie.\n\nPhotos taken of the couple, who moved to Sydney in 2021, show them being introduced to Princess Kate while watching Sunday’s match between Novak Djokovic and Carlos Alcaraz.\n\nSnaps also show them chatting with US tennis great, Stan Smith, while surrounded by Hollywood stars Tom Cruise, Benedict Cumberbatch and Julia Roberts.\n\nFellow legends of the sport Debbie Jevans and Chris Vert were also seated in the enclosure along with Cumberbatch’s wife, Sophie Hunter, and chair of the All England Lawn Tennis Club, Phillip Brook.\n\nAs photos from the event emerged online, Australians erupted with shock at the unexpected sighting of Australia’s “golden couple”.\n\n“Way more interested about Bec and Lleyton than Tom or Kate,” one remarked.\n\n“What a surprise, we haven’t seen them in years,” another said.\n\nBec became a national treasure following her TV debut in 1998, which swiftly made her a household name.\n\nAt just 16, the then-Bec Cartwright met 18-year-old tennis star Lleyton Hewitt at the Starlight Cup, a charity tennis match organised by the Starlight Children’s Foundation.\n\nThe two didn’t get together, however, until 2005, when Lleyton reached out to Bec about a TV project he was working on in Australia.\n\nThe pair quickly married and went on to have three kids together, Mia 16, Cruz, 13, and 11-year-old Ava.\n\nDespite having a huge public profile throughout the Noughties, regularly attending events such as the Melbourne Cup, the pair have taken a step back from the limelight and are rarely spotted at events."
