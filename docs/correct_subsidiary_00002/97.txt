Online video publishing company thePlatform, a subsidiary of Comcast, has added to its roster of big-name customers: NBCUniversal has signed a multi-year agreement to make thePlatform the back-end video management system for USA Network, Syfy, and Oxygen.

Those three networks will use thePlatform's MPX video management system. They'll be in good company, as several NBCUniversal properties -- including E!, NBC Local Media. NBC Sports Regional Networks, Sprout, Style, and the Golf Channel -- are already thePlatform customers.

How exactly the MPX video management system is used will vary for each network, according to each one's needs.

"We're very proud to have been selected to play such a key role in the new digital efforts of USA Network, Oxygen, and Syfy," says Ian Blaine, co-founder and CEO of thePlatform. "Our video management system provides leading programmers across NBCU with the efficiency, scalability, and versatility they require. We look forward to helping them address their evolving video needs and opportunities."

Those attending the Managing and Monetizing OTT Video Conference in Boston, Massachusetts, on June 21 can hear Blaine talk more about the deal in his keynote address.

On June 6, thePlatform launched MPX Essentials, a cloud-based video platform designed for midmarket companies in any vertical.
