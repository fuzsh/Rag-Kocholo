Cynthia Chu has been named vp and CFO of Oxygen Media, marking the first major executive appointment since NBC Universal acquired the network in October.

Chu is moving to Oxygen after having been with NBC Universal’s local media division, which she joined in 2004 and worked her way up the ranks. She most recently was director of sales finance, overseeing the financial planning, pricing analysis and reporting of revenue from 25 NBC and Telemundo owned-and-operated stations.

In her new role, effective Monday, Chu will oversee the financial and operational performance of the female-targeted network, which is available in 73 million homes. Her appointment follows the news in November that NBC Universal was extending Bravo Media president Lauren Zalaznick’s oversight to include Oxygen.

Chu will report jointly to Zalaznick and Catherine Dunleavy, executive vp and CFO of NBC Universal Cable.

“There’s enormous potential for growth at the network,” Zalaznick said. “Cynthia’s background is perfect to help shepherd the asset into the NBCU family.”

Added Dunleavy: “Cynthia’s got an outstanding track record of implementing growth strategies, and she’s got the right leadership style to make it work at Oxygen. She’s passionate, positive and always graceful under pressure.”

NBC Universal acquired Oxygen in November in a transaction valued at $875 million. At that time, Debby Beece, president of programming and marketing, resigned from her post, and NBC Universal has since laid off 60 staffers, or 25% of Oxygen’s total work force.

Lisa Gersh, president and COO of Oxygen, is staying on at the company, with plans to transition into an unspecified new role within NBC Uni.
