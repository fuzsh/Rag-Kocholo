        "text": "What Are Nano-bubbles?\n\nNanobubbles, given their name from their nano size, measure between 70-120 nanometers in diameter, roughly 2500 times smaller than a grain of salt. They are formed by injecting any gas into any liquid. They are commonly called nano bubbles, microbubbles, micro nano bubbles, nano-sized bubbles and ultra fine bubbles. Additionally, you may also see nanobubble technology called nanobubbler, nano bubbler, nanobubble generators and nanobubble enrichment systems.\n\nTheir chemical and physical properties allow them to be instrumental in a series of applications that span wastewater treatment, plant growth, and more. Moleaer designs and supports a host of nanobubble systems that take advantage of these properties and behaviors to make water do more with less.\n\nWhy Is Nanobubble Water Good for Plant Growth?\n\nIt's no secret that water is good for plants, though plants need high-quality irrigation water to thrive and produce healthy, resilient crops. With Moleaer's irrigation and greenhouse technology, oxygen or air nanobubbles are injected into irrigation water to supersaturate it with high levels of dissolved oxygen and nanobubbles.\n\nMoleaer’s nanobubble generators deliver mass transfer of gas with over 85% transfer efficiency, higher than any other aeration technology on the market. The dissolved oxygen remains in the irrigation water for long periods of time, and travels all the way to the root zone, even when applied to an irrigation reservoir or day tank.\n\nThis means that oxygen transfer becomes optimized, which leads to better nutrient absorption efficiency. Bear in mind that oxygen, alongside glucose, is a key component of root respiration, the process that plants use to transform glucose (from photosynthesis) to ATP.\n\nMore oxygen available in the root zone improves root absorption of nutrients and water. In addition to high levels of dissolved oxygen, nanobubbles provide their own benefits, including suppressing water-borne pathogens, reducing biofilm, improving infiltration into soils, soil substrates, and more.\n\nWhat Are Some of the Unique Physical Properties of Nano-bubble Technology?\n\nUnlike larger bubbles, nanobubbles are extremely small (nano-sized) gas bubbles that have a series of unique chemical and physical properties. Here's a brief overview:\n\n-A strong negatively charged surface that allows for stability in liquid\n\n-The ability to physically separate small particles and droplets\n\n-Potential for releasing hydroxyl radicals (HO), which destroy hard-to-kill water contaminants\n\n- Neutrally buoyant and can remain suspended for weeks in water without surfacing and move randomly through liquids in the form of Brownian Motion.\n\nHow Do Nano-bubble Size Properties Fit into Separation and Purification Technology?\n\nThe surface charge of nanobubbles allows them to naturally adhere to emulsified, colloidal, and suspended materials, helping remove them from wastewater streams and increasing process efficiency.\n\nWhen compared to air saturators, nanobubble solid removal requires up to 90% less energy consumption. Some of the elements that nanobubble enriched water can help remove are:\n\n-Surfactants\n\n-Fats and grease\n\n-Solids\n\n-Colloids\n\n-Oil\n\nIs There a Rental Option Available?\n\nDeploying the leading nanobubble systems is even more accessible with Moleaer’s Nanobubbles-as-a-Service (NaaS), which offers modular and flexible rentals. If upfront capital cost is a concern, NaaS is a great option for you, especially to meet high seasonal demands or unexpected conditions.\n\nNaaS offers flexibility, remote monitoring capabilities, gas injection (air, O2, CO2, N2, etc) for specialized applications, and scalability from 500 to 5,000 GPM. Learn more about NaaS.\n\nWhat if I Have No Prior Understanding of How Nanobubbles Can Improve My Applications?\n\nWhile you may be aware of nanobubble technology, you may not necessarily understand the full extent of its benefits in your industry. How will it help improve my lake or pond health? Why is the oxygen concentrator in the system important and more convenient? What does the setup look like? How do I install the system? What kind of support can you get?\n\nWe are here to help. Our team of experts can answer your questions. You can head to the contact information entry form here to set up a consultation with one of our experts.\n\nIs There a Resource I Can Use for Updates Whenever There Are Industry-specific Developments?\n\nPlease visit our homepage and enter your email address and industry to get timely updates.\n\nWhat Equipment Monitoring Capabilities Can I Take Advantage of?\n\nRemote monitoring services are available on select nanobubble generators, deliver the data you need via computer or app, and simplify the process of keeping track of your operations.\n\nThis includes equipment monitoring 24/7, so you can handle maintenance or other alerts proactively.\n\n24/7 water quality monitoring is also available, which allows you to stay on top of the key parameters and helps you to maintain your water quality standards.\n\nIs There Product Support Available? If So, How Do I Access It?\n\nYes. We want to ensure that our customers are taken care of and our equipment is supported to meet and exceed your expectations.. If you are in need of product support, visit the ticket submission page here, provide the relevant details, and we will be in touch with you.\n\nHow Long Has Moleaer Been in Operation?\n\nMoleaer, the global leader in nanobubble technology, was founded in 2016 by Warren Russell and Bruce Scholten, and since then, the company has stayed true to a commitment to delivering innovative nanobubble solutions to our valued customers.\n\nHow Do I Know Distribution Is Available in My Area?\n\nWe have a host of distributors and channel partners across the world. Check out our distributor map to find out if there is a distributor near you."
