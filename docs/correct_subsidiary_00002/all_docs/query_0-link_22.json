        "text": "Privacy Act Notice\n\nSection 1506 of title 17 of the United States Code authorizes the Copyright Office to collect the personally identifying information (PII) requested by this system in order to maintain a directory of designated agents under the Designated Service Agent Directory (\"DSAD\"). PII is any personal information that can be used to identify, contact, or trace an individual, such as names, addresses, and telephone numbers. By providing PII, you are agreeing to the routine use of such PII to establish and maintain a public record, including the Office’s public indexes, the Office’s public website, and Office search reports prepared for the public. The effect of not providing the PII requested is that it may delay processing of your designation or could affect the legal sufficiency of your filing, a determination that would be made by a court of law."
