        "text": "Amazon Prime Day 2024 may officially be over, but some of Amazon's best Kindle e-readers are still on sale. Whether you're looking to get some more reading in or you want to update your current model, you'll find some generous savings on Amazon's proprietary devices, from the basic Kindle to the feature-rich Kindle Scribe. You'll just have to opt for bundle deals instead – most of the single product deals have disappeared, but there are still savings to be had when you bundle a Kindle with accessories to save.\n\nKindle e-readers boast legible Paperwhite or e-ink displays, which means you can see the screen in any lighting situation and adjust to your liking. Most of the models are also water-resistant, so you can lounge poolside or in the bathtub with your favorite reads without a care. You also get weeks' worth of battery life, as well as a massive amount of space to store your favorite titles. The latest Kindle e-readers also serve as an audiobook and podcast player when you pair it with wireless headphones or earbuds.\n\nBelow, find some of the best Kindle deals you can still get now on Amazon. Keep in mind that most savings are bundled together so they may seem more expensive than usual, but you're getting multiple items like chargers or cases together in one package.\n\nThe 5 best deals on Amazon Kindles after Prime Day\n\nWhether you want to catch up on your summer reading, plan to read a steamy romance novel at the beach, or hope to enjoy catching up on bestselling novels from your favorite authors before bed, one of the latest Amazon Kindle e-readers can do all this and so much more. Here are some of the best Kindle deals we've found that are available right now following the end Amazon Prime Day 2024 sale event.\n\nAmazon Kindle Scribe Essentials Bundle: $430 (12% off)\n\nFeaturing a 10.2-inch Paperwhite display that can be seen in any lighting situation, plus a battery life that lasts for weeks, the Kindle Scribe stands out from the rest of the Kindle lineup. In addition to serving as a full-featured e-reader and audiobook/podcast player, it comes with a pen-shaped stylus and serves as a digital notepad.\n\nUsing the Kindle Scribe, you can create as many custom-named virtual notebooks as you'd like. Each notebook can have any number of pages. And on each page, you can handwrite or draw whatever content you choose. Your handwritten notes can also be converted to editable text. Plus, it's possible to email PDF files directly to your Kindle Scribe to view and annotate them. Or, files can be sent between your Kindle Scribe and Microsoft Word (via your Microsoft 365 account, if you're a subscriber to this service).\n\nThis version of the Scribe comes with 16GB of internal storage and a three-month trial to the Kindle Unlimited service. It also comes with Amazon's Basic Pen stylus. For a bit more money, a 32GB or 64GB version of the Scribe is available with the Basic Pen or Amazon Premium Pen stylus.\n\nYou can get the Kindle Scribe as part of a bundle with a premium pen, leather folio cover and a power adapter for just $430, which is 12% off its normal price.\n\nAmazon Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition Essentials Bundle: $245 (7% off)\n\nOut of all the Amazon Kindle e-readers, this one is the most convenient and comfortable to use. It's thin, lightweight, extremely portable and waterproof (IPX8 rated). It also uses a Paperwhite display and has a battery that lasts for up to 10 weeks between charges.\n\nLike all Kindle devices, this one connects to the internet via Wi-Fi, so you can download e-books, audiobooks, podcasts and other compatible content directly to the e-reader. The device comes with 32GB of storage, which is enough to hold thousands of e-books or hundreds of audiobooks.\n\nIn our coverage of the five best e-readers for 2024, the Amazon Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition is our top pick. This is the model we highly recommend to most readers.\n\nThis bundle includes a Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition, an Amazon leather cover, and a wireless charging dock, all for $245. That's 7% off its normal price.\n\nAmazon Kindle Essentials Bundle: $155 (8% off)\n\nAmazon's Kindle e-reader is the most basic model in the lineup. It offers a glare-free, 6-inch e-ink display, has a rechargeable battery that lasts for up to six weeks and includes 16GB of storage. Instead of using 17 LEDs to brighten the display when reading in dimly lit or dark areas, this Kindle uses just four LEDs. It's also not waterproof.\n\nIt's a scaled-down version of the Amazon Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition, but still works as a full-featured e-reader or audiobook/podcast player. It measures 4.3 x 6.2 x 0.32 inches and weighs just 5.56 ounces.\n\nThere are two versions of the Amazon Kindle. One that includes ads that get displayed on the e-reader's lock screen when it's not being used and one that's a bit more expensive, but that offers an ad-free experience. A three-month trial subscription to Amazon's Kindle Unlimited service is included.\n\nYou can get the Kindle Essentials bundle for just $155, and it includes the Kindle itself, a fabric cover and a power adapter for just $155, which is 8% off its usual price.\n\nAmazon Kindle Paperwhite Kids Essentials Bundle: $158 (22% off)\n\nThere are currently two versions of the Kindle that cater specifically to kids. This one features a Paperwhite display and is a bit more expensive. However, the glare-free screen is easier on the eyes and allows it to be easily viewed in any lighting situation. This e-reader has a 6.8-inch screen and a battery that lasts for up to 10 weeks.\n\nSeveral things set the Kindle Paperwhite Kids apart from the other models. This device offers an ad-free experience. It also comes with a one-year subscription to the Amazon Kids+ service, which offers a vast library of e-books, audiobooks and other content that's age-appropriate and curated specifically for a younger audience. (At the end of one year, the Amazon Kids+ subscription can be extended for $5.99 per month.)\n\nThe device is also waterproof and comes with a two-year worry-free guarantee, so if the e-reader breaks during this period, Amazon will repair or replace it for free. This kid-friendly e-reader also comes with a free protective and colorful cover.\n\nOther features this kid-friendly version of the Kindle offers include integrated tools for young readers, such as a vocabulary builder. It also comes preinstalled with the OpenDyslexia font, which makes it easier for some people with dyslexia to read text on the screen.\n\nYou can get the Kindle Paperwhite Kids for just $150 during Prime Day, which is 12% off its normal price. Get the Kindle Paperwhite Kids Essentials Bundle, which includes the Kindle itself, a kids' Emerald Forest cover, power adapter and screen protector for just $158. That's 22% off its normal price.\n\nAmazon Kindle Kids Essentials Bundle: $153 (17% off)\n\nThe 2022 Kindle Kids e-reader is specifically designed to promote reading by eliminating distractions like games, videos and ads. It features a lightweight and compact design with an adjustable front light for comfortable reading day or night.\n\nThis model boasts a high-resolution display, increased storage capacity and an extended battery life of up to six weeks on a single charge, allowing kids to enjoy their favorite books without interruption.\n\nThis package comes with a cover, a one-year subscription to Amazon Kids+ (which provides access to a wide range of kid-friendly books and audiobooks) and a two-year warranty.\n\nYou can buy the Kindle Kids Essentials Bundle, which comes with a Space Whale kids' cover, a power adapter and screen cover together for just $153.\n\nGet an extra 20% off any Amazon Kindle\n\nIf you have an old e-reader or another eligible device, even if it's not functional, you can trade it in when purchasing any new Amazon Kindle e-reader. In addition to receiving an Amazon gift card for the appraised value of your old device, Amazon will give you an instant 20% off on the purchase of whichever new Kindle model you select. Of course, certain trade-in terms and conditions apply.\n\nWhat is the best Amazon Kindle?\n\nWhile many e-readers look the same from the outside, it's the technology inside -- display, internal storage, and other capabilities -- that set each of them apart. Here's what to look for when choosing an e-reader that'll best meet your needs, reading habits and budget.\n\nDisplay size: This determines how much on-screen real estate you have to read e-books and perform other tasks when using the e-reader.\n\nDisplay type: All of the e-readers in this roundup feature an e-ink or Paperwhite display. All are glare-resistant, so they can be viewed in any lighting situation, including direct sunlight. These displays use very little battery power, so the battery life of a typical e-reader is upwards of six to 10 weeks, not mere hours (like what you'd experience using a traditional tablet). The goal of an e-ink or Paperwhite display is to showcase text in a way that replicates the printed pages from a traditional book as closely as possible. Another benefit of these displays is that they're much easier on the eyes, so they don't cause eye strain or fatigue during extended reading sessions.\n\nInternal storage: This determines how many e-books, audiobooks and other files you can store within the device. Even e-readers with just 16GB of storage can hold thousands of e-books or hundreds of audiobooks. However, if you're using an e-reader that also serves as a digital notepad, like the Scribe, you'll want more storage for all of your notes and related files.\n\nAudiobook and podcast playing: All of the e-readers in this roundup can play audiobooks and podcasts. Since these devices don't have built-in speakers, you'll need to pair wireless, noise-canceling headphones or earbuds with your e-reader.\n\nNote-taking and other features: Some e-readers, like the Kindle Scribe, can be used as a digital notebook. This means you can handwrite or draw directly on the device's display using a pen-shaped stylus. These e-readers also support cloud-based services, so you can automatically sync or backup your notes in the cloud, share them with your computer(s) and mobile devices, or share them with other people.\n\nDurability and waterproof rating: While many of the best e-readers are waterproof, meaning you can read in the bathtub, at the pool, or the beach and not have to worry about damaging the device if it gets wet, this is not the case for all of these devices. And while they're designed to be rather durable, to protect your e-reader's display when it's being stored or transported, we highly recommend purchasing an optional case or cover for the device.\n\nE-book and content selection: Every e-reader gives you easy access to one or more online e-bookstores. Most of these e-bookstores also have a subscription service. For a flat monthly fee, you get unlimited access to a vast library of e-books and audiobooks. But keep in mind that most e-readers are compatible with Overdrive's Libby service, which allows you to borrow e-books and audiobooks from your local public library for free.\n\nPhysical Size and Weight: Some popular e-readers, like the Amazon Kindle Paperwhite Signature edition, are designed to be about the same size and weight as a traditional paperback. The e-readers that can also serve as a digital notepad are a bit larger to provide plenty of writing space. The physical size and weight of the e-reader determine how comfortable it is to hold in your hands.\n\nIs Kindle Unlimited worth it?\n\nAmazon Kindle Unlimited is a subscription service that costs $11.99 per month. With an active subscription, you get unlimited access to more than four million e-book titles, including bestsellers, popular series, classics and more. You also get access to thousands of audiobooks and hundreds of magazines that you can access anywhere and anytime using your Kindle e-reader or the Kindle app running on your computer or mobile device.\n\nAll new Kindle purchases come with a three-month trial subscription to Kindle Unlimited. After the trial, you can cancel the subscription or continue it by agreeing to the membership (which you can cancel at any time). While you're a member, you can store content acquired from the Kindle Unlimited service on your e-reader for offline access. But once your subscription is canceled, all of this content will automatically get erased.\n\nMeanwhile, if you prefer to purchase e-books one at a time from the Kindle e-book store, but want an audiobook subscription that'll save you some cash, consider signing up for Audible. This service allows you to select one audiobook per month that you own outright, plus grants you unlimited access to an ever-expanding library of free audiobooks, podcasts and other audio content while you're an active subscriber -- all for $14.95 per month (after a free three-month trial for Prime members)."
