        "text": "Me tooðŸ™„Oxygen app on roku streaming stick plus will not work.It hasn't worked going on 2 weeks. I've done everything ðŸ˜« Does anyone know why? Does roku actually ever answer any these questions? ROKU,There's gotta be a reasonðŸ¤·\n\nI get the cloud path error on ROKU Express but not the Roku premiere. Express worked fine for about 3 weeks and now suddenly can't get anything LIVE.\n\nI've noticed that I can't access NBC Live, but I can access everything else that comes up when I click the NBC icon. I hope this is helpful to restore full service.\n\nI am having the same issues with Bravo and NBC. I can, however, watch both on my computer. The channel doesn't prompt me to add my Direct TV information, which is confusing. I have tried deleting app and restarting my Roku tv. Not sure what the problem is here, its super frustrating.\n\nI was having the same problem. I unlinked my tv provider and then re-activated using my login. Seems to be working for now.\n\nTry unlinking your tv provider and then re-activating with a new code. I was having the same problem. Itâ€™s working for me so far.\n\nI don't have cable TV, just Spectrum internet. Should I unlink from Spectrum? How do I do that?\n\nI have removed and restarted and added back nbc, but I still cannot get the live nbc to work. It works on two of my three roku TVs. This is not acceptable. Please fix this problem for us!!"
