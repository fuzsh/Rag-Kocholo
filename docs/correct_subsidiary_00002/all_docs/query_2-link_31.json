        "text": "Oprah Winfrey isn’t just a pop-culture phenomenon, she is a savvy businesswoman who has leveraged her popularity to build a media empire and a multi-billion dollar fortune.\n\nBorn in rural Mississippi, Oprah got her big break as the first black female news anchor at Nashville's WLAC-TV. She eventually moved to Baltimore in 1976, where she hosted a local talk show before being recruited to host her own morning show in Chicago, called AM Chicago. The show quickly became the area’s highest-rated talk show and was eventually syndicated and renamed as The Oprah Winfrey Show, which ran until May 2011.\n\nDespite stepping away from the spotlight, Oprah has kept busy with a range of projects and partnerships, including a collaboration with Kraft Heinz. These successful ventures have helped the queen of daytime TV amass a 2.6 billion fortune, per Forbes.\n\nKeep reading to find out the business ventures that Oprah owns.\n\nHarpo Inc.\n\nHarpo Inc. is Oprah’s media and entertainment company. Harpo (Oprah spelled backward) is the owner of Harpo Productions, its sole subsidiary.\n\nBased in West Hollywood, California, Harpo Productions is a multimedia production company founded by Oprah. The company is split into two divisions, the Oprah Winfrey Network (OWN), a TV network that Harpo owns a 25.5% stake in, and Harpo Print, which is responsible for O, The Oprah Magazine. The company also operated Harpo Films and Harpo Radio but shut down the ventures in 2013 and 2015 respectively.\n\nOutside of Oprah's own ventures, Harpo Productions also produces The Dr. Oz Show and The Nate Berkus Show.\n\nWeight Watchers\n\nIn 2015, Oprah bought a minority stake in global nutrition and weight loss program Weight Watchers for a reported $34 million. By 2020, the value of her investment in the publicly-traded company (now officially called WW International) had increased to as much as $430 million.\n\nOprah owns around 8% of the company and was given the option to buy an additional 4.3% of the company’s common stock on a fully diluted basis after signing a new partnership with the company."
