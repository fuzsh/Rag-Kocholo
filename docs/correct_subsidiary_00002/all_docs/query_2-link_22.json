        "text": "Oprah Winfrey’s former Oxygen business partner Geraldine Laybourne was the keynote speaker this week at an Alliance for Women in Media lunch, where she revealed that she and Winfrey are not into the new Oxygen.\n\n“Before she started her acceptance speech she basically said . . . ‘I want to say how sad I am at what Oxygen has become. It should not be an all-crime network. That is not what Oprah, Marcy [Carsey] and I set out to create and it makes me very, very sad,’ ” a spy told us.\n\nNow owned by NBC, Oxygen rebranded as a crime network over the summer.\n\nLaybourne’s lament stunned the room. “It was totally out of left field,” a spy said.\n\nA rep for Winfrey did not comment.\n\nA rep for the network said, “The ratings are up 44 percent since the transition to an all crime network. People are loving it.”"
