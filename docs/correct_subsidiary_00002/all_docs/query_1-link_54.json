        "text": "Researchers in Dallas are working on the next big breakthrough in concussion research.\n\nThey are looking for proof that breathing 100% oxygen in a pressurized chamber can help people recover faster.\n\nAnecdotally, hyperbaric chamber treatments seem to help patients, but experts say there is insufficient scientific evidence to back the claims.\n\nThe study at UT Southwestern utilizes a unique gas system that, for placebo participants, will mimic hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) environment but will provide the same oxygen as room air.\n\nThe active arm of the trial will provide 100% oxygen at increased pressure.\n\nIf patients in both arms improve, the benefit will be due to a placebo response, not HBOT.\n\n\"The idea is, well, something subtle is wrong with the brain. Maybe it's a little residual swelling. Maybe it's the circulation of the capillaries, the tiniest blood vessels, had been disrupted somehow. There's enough anecdotal evidence that some people seem to be helped, that it's worth looking into. Now, it's not cheap, and it's not easy but if we can bring back functioning people so they can work and live and have their life back, that's worth it,\" said Undersea and Hyperbaric Medicine program director Dr. James Berry.\n\nPersistent post-concussive symptoms include headaches, dizziness, fatigue, irritability, anxiety, trouble falling asleep or sleeping too much, loss of concentration and memory and ringing in the ears.\n\nThe trial is currently enrolling participants.\n\nThe study takes place at the Institute for Exercise and Environmental Medicine, a collaboration between UT Southwestern and Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas."
