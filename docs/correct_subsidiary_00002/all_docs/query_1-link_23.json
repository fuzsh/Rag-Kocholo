        "text": "\"Strut,\" a reality show featuring transgender models trying to make it big in the fashion industry, will premiere September 20 on Oxygen, the network revealed Tuesday.\n\nTrans models Laith De La Cruz, Dominique Jackson, Isis King, Ren Spriggs and Arisce Wanzer will be featured in the unscripted series, as will Cecilio Asuncion and Cassandra Cass of Slay Model Management. Whoopi Goldberg executive produced the show.\n\n“Our models come from all walks of life, all different backgrounds and ethnicities. They are struggling with things we can all relate to –- trying to make ends meet, fighting to make a name for themselves and navigating the minefields of personal relationships,\" Goldberg said in a statement.\n\n\"All of these struggles are amplified by the fact that they are also fighting to break down barriers and taking on the responsibility of representing the transgender community in today’s society. It’s time to separate caricature from real people and that’s what we are doing with 'Strut,'\" Goldberg added."
