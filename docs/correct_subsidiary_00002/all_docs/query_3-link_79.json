Introduction\n\nThese guidelines interpret the requirements for good manufacturing practices (GMP) in Part C, Division 2 of the Regulations. They were developed by Health Canada in consultation with stakeholders.\n\nGuidance documents like this one are meant to help industry and health care professionals understand how to comply with regulations. They also provide guidance to Health Canada staff, so that the rules are enforced in a fair, consistent and effective way across Canada.\n\nHealth Canada inspects establishments to assess their compliance with the Food and Drugs Act (the Act) and associated regulations. When we conduct an inspection, we will use this document as a guide in assessing your compliance with GMP requirements.\n\nThese guidelines are not the only way GMP regulations can be interpreted, and are not intended to cover every possible case. Other ways of complying with GMP regulations will be considered with proper scientific justification. Also, as new technologies emerge, different approaches may be called for.\n\nGuidance documents are administrative and do not have the force of law. Because of this, they allow for flexibility in approach. So use this guide to help you develop specific approaches that meet your unique needs.\n\nThe guidance in this document has been written with a view to harmonize with GMP standards from:\n\nthe World Health Organization (WHO)\n\nthe Pharmaceutical Inspection Cooperation/Scheme (PIC/S)\n\nthe International Council on Harmonisation (ICH)\n\nthe International Cooperation on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Veterinary Medicinal Products (VICH)\n\nother regulatory agencies in other countries\n\nThis document also takes into account current mutual recognition agreements (MRA) between Health Canada and other international regulatory authorities, as well as agreements with other parties.\n\nThis edition reflects recent regulatory amendments, clarifies existing requirements, incorporates common questions from industry, and provides an updated list of annexes.\n\nChecklist – GMP regulations by activity\n\nChart 1.0: GMP regulations applicable to which licensable activities Section Regulation F P/L I D W T Premises C.02.004 - Equipment C.02.005 - - - Personnel C.02.006 Sanitation C.02.007 - - - - C.02.008 - - - - Raw material testing C.02.009 - - - - * C.02.010 - - - - * Manufacturing control C.02.011 - - C.02.012 - Quality control department C.02.013 - C.02.014 - C.02.015 Packaging material testing C.02.016 - - - * C.02.017 - - - * Finished product testing C.02.018 - * C.02.019 - - * Records C.02.020 - C.02.021 C.02.022 - - - C.02.023 - C.02.024 - Samples C.02.025 - - - C.02.026 - - - Stability C.02.027 - - - * C.02.028 - - - * Sterile products C.02.029 - - - *\n\n*Where applicable, depending on the nature of the activities.\n\nF = Fabricator\n\nP/L = Packager/Labeller\n\nI = Importer (MRA and non-MRA)\n\nD = Distributor\n\nW = Wholesaler\n\nT = Tester\n\nAbout quality management\n\n4. Pharmaceutical quality system\n\nGuiding principles\n\nDo you hold an establishment licence, or run an operation governed by Part C, Division 2 of the Food and Drug Regulations? If you do, you must make sure that you comply with these requirements—and the marketing or clinical trial authorization—when you fabricate, package, label, import, distribute, test and wholesale drugs. You must not place consumers at risk because of poor safety, quality, efficacy, or for not complying with regulations.\n\nYou are responsible for meeting the requirements outlined in the Regulations and clarified in this guidance. You will also need the help and commitment of your suppliers and personnel at all levels of your establishment.\n\nTo meet the requirements, you should:\n\nhave a well-designed and correctly implemented pharmaceutical quality system (also known as a quality management system) that incorporates good manufacturing practices (GMP) and quality risk management\n\nfully document the pharmaceutical quality system and monitor its effectiveness\n\nmake sure your entire pharmaceutical quality system is properly resourced with qualified personnel and suitable/sufficient premises, equipment and facilities\n\nThe basic concepts of quality management, good manufacturing practices and quality risk management are inter-related. They are described here to emphasize their relationships and fundamental importance to the production and control of drugs.\n\nDeveloping a pharmaceutical quality system\n\nQuality management is a wide-ranging concept. It covers all matters that individually or collectively influence the quality of a drug. It is the total of the arrangements made to ensure that drugs are of the quality required for their intended use. It incorporates GMP.\n\nGMP applies to all drug product lifecycle stages: from the manufacture of investigational drugs, to technology transfer, to commercial manufacturing, through to product discontinuation. The pharmaceutical quality system can even extend to the pharmaceutical development lifecycle stage (as described in ICH Q10: Pharmaceutical Quality System). This should encourage innovation and continual improvement while strengthening the link between pharmaceutical development and full-scale manufacturing activities.\n\nYou should consider the size and complexity of your company's activities when developing a new pharmaceutical quality system or modifying an existing one. The system design should incorporate risk management principles, including the use of appropriate tools. While some aspects of the system can be company-wide and others site-specific, the effectiveness of the system is normally proven at the site level.\n\nTo ensure your pharmaceutical quality system is properly set up for fabricating, packaging, labelling, testing, distributing, importing or wholesaling drugs, you should:\n\nDesign, plan, implement, maintain and continuously improve on your system to allow the consistent delivery of products with proper quality attributes.\n\nManage product and process knowledge throughout all lifecycle stages.\n\nDesign and develop drugs in a way that takes into account GMP requirements.\n\nClearly outline management responsibilities.\n\nMake arrangements for:\n\nmanufacturing, supplying and using the correct starting and packaging materials\n\nselecting and monitoring suppliers\n\nverifying that each delivery is from the approved supply chain\n\nEnsure processes are in place to properly manage outsourced activities.\n\nEstablish and maintain a state of control by developing and using effective monitoring and control systems for process performance and product quality.\n\nRecords are appropriately reviewed and protected from accidental or intentional modification or deletion. To demonstrate a state of control, you should implement a data governance system.\n\nYou may find additional information in the PIC/S Good Practices for Data Management and Integrity in Regulated GMP/GDP environments (PI 041).\n\nTake into account the results of product and process monitoring in batch release and in the investigation of deviations. This will allow you to take preventive action to avoid potential deviations in the future.\n\nCarry out all needed controls on intermediate products, and any other in-process controls and validations.\n\nEnsure continual improvement by making quality improvements appropriate to the current level of process and product knowledge.\n\nMake arrangements to evaluate and approve planned changes before implementing them. Regulatory notification and approval of changes must be done as required.\n\nAfter implementing any change, conduct an evaluation to confirm that your quality objectives were achieved. Ensure there was no unintended negative impact on product quality at the time of release and through its shelf life.\n\nApply an appropriate level of root cause analysis when investigating deviations, suspected product defects and other problems. This can be determined using quality risk management principles. In cases where the true root cause(s) of the issue cannot be determined, identify the most likely root cause(s) and address those.\n\nWhere human error is suspected or identified as the cause, this should be justified with objective evidence. Ensure that process, procedural or system-based errors or problems have not been overlooked, if present.\n\nDetermine the full impact of the deviation, and document how you reached your conclusion.\n\nIdentify and carry out appropriate corrective actions and/or preventive actions in response to investigations. Monitor and assess the effectiveness of such actions, in line with quality risk management principles.\n\nMake sure the Quality Control Department approves each production batch of drugs before you sell or supply them. You must produce and control drugs according to marketing authorization requirements and any other regulations relevant to the production, control and release of drugs.\n\nEnsure that drugs—and the materials that go into making and packaging them—are stored, distributed and handled properly, so that quality is maintained throughout their shelf life.\n\nImplement a process for self-inspection and/or quality audit, to regularly assess the effectiveness and applicability of your pharmaceutical quality system.\n\nHave senior management participate actively in the pharmaceutical quality system. Their leadership is essential as they are ultimately responsible for ensuring an effective pharmaceutical quality system is in place. This includes making sure the system is properly resourced and that roles, responsibilities and authorities are defined, communicated and implemented throughout your organization. Senior management should also ensure staff—at all levels and sites within your organization—support and are committed to the pharmaceutical quality system.\n\nHave senior management periodically conduct a management review of pharmaceutical quality system operations, to continually identify risks and opportunities to improve products, processes and the system itself.\n\nDefine and document your pharmaceutical quality system. You should have a quality manual or equivalent documentation that contains a description of the system, including management responsibilities.\n\nGood manufacturing practices for drugs\n\nGood manufacturing practices (GMP) are part of quality assurance. They ensure that drugs are consistently produced and controlled. Drugs must meet the quality standards for their intended use—as outlined in the marketing authorization, clinical trial authorization or product specification.\n\nGMP is concerned with both production and quality control. To meet GMP requirements, you must:\n\nClearly define all manufacturing processes. Review them systematically in the light of experience. Show that they are capable of consistently manufacturing drugs of the required quality that comply with their specifications.\n\nValidate critical steps of manufacturing processes and key changes to the process.\n\nProvide all key elements for GMP, including:\n\nqualified and trained staff\n\nadequate premises and space\n\nsuitable equipment and services\n\ncorrect materials, containers and labels\n\napproved procedures and instructions\n\nsuitable storage and transport\n\nWrite step-by-step instructions and procedures in clear and direct language, specifically applicable to the facilities used.\n\nTrain operators to properly carry out procedures. Ensure they understand the importance of meeting GMP requirements as part of their role in assuring patient safety.\n\nCreate records (manually and/or by recording instruments) during manufacture. Show that all the steps required by the defined procedures and instructions were in fact followed, and met relevant parameters and/or quality attributes. Show that the quantity and quality of the drug was as expected.\n\nDocument any deviations. Investigate significant deviations to determine the root cause and impact. Ensure proper corrective and preventive action is taken.\n\nKeep records of fabrication, packaging, labelling, testing, distribution, importation and wholesaling in an easy-to-understand and accessible form. This allows the complete history of a lot to be traced.\n\nDistribute products in a way that minimizes any risk to their quality and takes account of Canadian good manufacturing practices which incorporate good distribution practice.\n\nControl storage, handling and transportation of drugs and their ingredients to minimize any risk to their quality.\n\nHave a system in place for recalling drugs from sale.\n\nExamine complaints about drugs. Investigate the causes of quality defects. Take appropriate measures to prevent problems from happening again.\n\nQuality control\n\nQuality control is the part of GMP that is concerned with:\n\nsampling\n\nspecifications\n\ntesting\n\ndocumentation\n\nrelease procedures\n\nYou must only release raw materials, packaging materials and products for use or sale if their quality is satisfactory. Quality control ensures that you carry out the necessary and relevant tests to ensure quality. It is not only done in labs—you must incorporate quality control into all activities and decisions about the quality of your products.\n\nTo meet basic quality control requirements, you must:\n\nEnsure you have adequate facilities, trained personnel and approved procedures for sampling and testing of raw materials, packaging materials, intermediate bulk and finished products, and—where appropriate—for monitoring environmental conditions.\n\nTake samples of raw materials, packaging materials and intermediate, bulk and finished products using authorized personnel and approved methods.\n\nValidate test methods. Qualify equipment, instruments and computer systems for their intended use.\n\nKeep records (manually and/or by recording instruments) to show you carried out all required sampling, inspecting and testing procedures. Record and investigate any deviations.\n\nEnsure finished products contain active ingredients complying with the qualitative and quantitative composition stated in the marketing or clinical trial authorization. Ensure they are of the purity required, enclosed within their proper containers, and correctly labelled and stored.\n\nDocument the results of your inspection and testing of intermediate, bulk and finished products and materials against specification.\n\nInclude in your product release procedures a review and evaluation of relevant production documentation, as well as an assessment of deviations from specified procedures.\n\nDo not release drugs for sale or supply before they are approved by your quality control department.\n\nKeep sufficient samples of raw material and finished product to allow future examination if needed.\n\nQuality risk management\n\nQuality risk management is a systematic process for the assessment, control, communication and review of risks to the quality of a drug across the product lifecycle. It can be applied both proactively and retrospectively.\n\nThe principles of quality risk management are that:\n\nThe evaluation of the risk to quality is based on scientific knowledge and experience with the process, and ultimately links to the protection of the patient.\n\nThe level of effort, formality and documentation of the quality risk management process is commensurate with the level of risk.\n\nExamples of quality risk management processes and applications can be found in ICH Q9: Quality Risk Management.\n\nGuidance\n\n5. Regulations\n\nFor each section below, the exact text from Part C, Division 2 of the Food and Drug Regulations (the Regulations) is provided first. This is followed by the rationale (why the rule is important) and Health Canada's interpretation (what you should do to be compliant), where needed.\n\nC.02.002\n\nC.02.002.1\n\nThis Division does not apply to fabricating, packaging/labelling, testing, storing and importing of antimicrobial agents.\n\nSale\n\nC.02.003\n\nNo distributor referred to in paragraph C.01A.003(b) and no importer shall sell a drug unless it has been fabricated, packaged/labelled, tested, and stored in accordance with the requirements of this Division.\n\nC.02.003.1\n\nNo person shall sell a drug that they have fabricated, packaged/labelled, tested or stored unless they have fabricated, packaged/labelled, tested or stored it in accordance with the requirements of this Division.\n\nC.02.003.2\n\nUse in fabrication\n\nC.02.003.3\n\nNo person shall use an active ingredient in the fabrication of a drug unless it is fabricated, packaged/labelled, tested and stored in accordance with the requirements of this Division.\n\nPremises\n\nC.02.004\n\nRationale\n\nYour establishment should be designed and constructed in a way that promotes cleanliness and orderliness and prevents contamination. Regular maintenance is required to prevent deterioration of the premises. The main objective of these efforts is product quality.\n\nInterpretation\n\nTake appropriate steps to minimize risks associated with building design and location, including measures to prevent contamination and mix-up of materials or drugs.\n\nMake sure your premises are designed, constructed and maintained so that they prevent the entry of pests or extraneous material into the building (or from one area to another).\n\nEnsure there are no holes or cracks in doors, windows, walls, ceilings and floors (other than those intended by design).\n\nUse doors that give direct access to the exterior from manufacturing and packaging areas for emergency purposes only. Make sure these doors are properly sealed. Ensure receiving and shipping areas do not allow direct access to production areas.\n\nSegregate production areas from all non-production areas. Clearly define individual manufacturing, packaging and testing areas, and segregate them if needed. Areas where biological, microbiological or radioisotope testing is carried out require special design and containment considerations.\n\nDo not locate other functions (such as research and development laboratories, diagnostic laboratories, and lab animal quarters) in the same building as manufacturing facilities unless you put in place enough measures to prevent cross-contamination. (See interpretation 11 for cross-contamination measures required.)\n\nSegregate mechanical areas such as boiler rooms, generators, and other engineering areas from production areas.\n\nTake measures to prevent contamination in all areas where raw materials, primary packaging materials, in-process drugs or drugs are exposed (to the extent required).\n\nEnsure floors, walls and ceilings allow cleaning. Seal brick, cement blocks and other porous materials. Avoid surface materials that shed particles.\n\nMake sure floors, walls, ceilings and other surfaces are hard, smooth and free of sharp corners where extraneous material can collect.\n\nSeal joints between walls, ceilings and floors.\n\nEnsure pipes, light fittings, ventilation points and other services do not create surfaces that cannot be cleaned.\n\nScreen and trap floor drains.\n\nMaintain air quality by controlling dust, monitoring pressure differentials between production areas (including between production and non-production areas), and checking and replacing air filters periodically. Ensure your air handling system is well defined, taking into consideration airflow volume, direction, velocity and the need to prevent cross-contamination. Check air handling systems periodically to ensure they comply with their design specifications. Keep records.\n\nControl temperature and humidity to the extent needed to safeguard materials and the reliability of production processes.\n\nSeparate eating areas, rest, change, wash-up and toilet facilities from production areas. Make sure they are adequately sized, well ventilated and allow good sanitary practices.\n\nDesign site layout to avoid mix-ups and optimize the flow of personnel and materials. Make sure:\n\nThere is enough space for receiving, storage and all production activities.\n\nWorking spaces allow the orderly and logical placement of materials and equipment (including parts and tools).\n\nWhere physical quarantine areas are used, they are well marked and segregated, with access restricted to designated staff. Electronic access to change quarantine inventory status control is restricted to designated staff.\n\nA separate sampling area is provided for raw materials. If sampling is performed in the storage area, it is done in a way that prevents contamination or cross-contamination.\n\nWorking areas are well lit.\n\nMovement of personnel, equipment and materials is designed to prevent contamination. Special considerations should be made for movement between self-contained and other facilities—this should be minimized and may require areas for decontamination.\n\nIdentify in your Validation Master Plan and qualify the utilities and support systems for buildings where drugs are fabricated or packaged/labelled. This includes heating, ventilating and air conditioning, dust collection, and supplies of purified water, water for injection, steam, compressed air, nitrogen, etc. Perform periodic verification and maintain records. For more guidance, see Guide to validation – drugs and supporting activities (GUI-0029).\n\nClearly identify the content of distribution systems for liquids and gases at their outlets.\n\nMaintain premises in a good state of repair. Ensure repair and maintenance operations do not affect drug quality.\n\nProvide and maintain separate rooms (where required) to protect equipment and control systems sensitive to vibration, electrical interference, and contact with excessive moisture or other external factors.\n\nIf you are a fabricator or packager, you must show that your premises are designed in a way that minimizes the risk of contamination between products (i.e. cross-contamination).\n\nUse a quality risk management approach to assess and control cross-contamination risks. Base this on an evaluation of the products manufactured (such as potency and toxicological evaluation). Take into account factors including:\n\nfacility/equipment design and use\n\npersonnel and material flow\n\nmicrobiological controls\n\nphysical, chemical and toxicological properties of materials used\n\nprocess characteristics\n\ncleaning processes\n\nanalytical capabilities\n\nThe outcome of your quality risk management process should help you determine the need for and extent to which premises and equipment should be dedicated to a particular product or product family. This may include dedicating either specific product contact parts or the entire manufacturing facility. It may be acceptable to confine manufacturing activities to a segregated, self-contained production area within a multi-product facility if you can justify it.\n\nSelf-contained facilities are required when a product presents a risk:\n\nthat cannot be properly controlled by operational and/or technical measures\n\nwhere scientific data does not support a safe threshold value for toxicity\n\nwhere threshold values derived from the toxicological evaluation are below the levels of detection\n\nfor certain classes of highly sensitizing drugs (such as penicillins and cephalosporins)\n\nEnsure external contamination with drug product residues does not exceed established limits on the final container and primary packaging (for the situations listed in interpretation 11.b). You may store products in common areas once they are enclosed in their immediate final containers and controls are in place to minimize risks of cross-contamination.\n\nEnsure no production activities of highly toxic non-pharmaceutical materials (such as pesticides and herbicides) are conducted in premises used for the production of drugs.\n\nEquipment\n\nC.02.005\n\nRationale\n\nTo fabricate drugs of consistent quality, you must make sure your equipment is appropriate for the intended use and performs as intended.\n\nThese requirements are meant to prevent the contamination of drugs by:\n\nother drugs\n\ndust and other airborne contaminants\n\nforeign materials, such as:\n\nrust\n\nlubricant\n\nparticles coming from the equipment\n\nContamination can also be caused by poor maintenance, misuse of equipment, exceeding the capacity of the equipment, and use of worn-out equipment.\n\nArranging your equipment in an orderly way makes cleaning adjacent areas easier and avoids interference with other processing operations. It also minimizes the circulation of personnel and optimizes the flow of materials.\n\nInterpretation\n\nMake sure the design, construction and location of your equipment allows cleaning, sanitizing and inspection of the equipment.\n\nEnsure equipment parts that come in contact with raw materials, intermediates or drugs are cleanable.\n\nEnsure tanks used in processing liquids and ointments are equipped with fittings that can be dismantled and cleaned. Ensure validated clean-in-place (CIP) equipment can be dismantled for periodic verification.\n\nEnsure filter assemblies are designed for easy dismantling.\n\nLocate equipment far enough away from other equipment and walls to allow cleaning of the equipment and adjacent area.\n\nSeal the base of immovable equipment properly along points of contact with the floor.\n\nKeep equipment clean, dry and protected from contamination when stored.\n\nEnsure equipment does not add extraneous material to the drug. Make sure that:\n\nsurfaces that come in contact with raw materials, intermediates or drugs are smooth and made of material that is non-toxic, corrosion-resistant, non-reactive to the drug being fabricated or packaged, and capable of withstanding repeated cleaning or sanitizing\n\nequipment design minimizes the possibility of a lubricant or other maintenance material contaminating the drug\n\nequipment made of material that is prone to shed particles or to harbour microorganisms does not come in contact with or contaminate raw materials, in-process drugs or drugs\n\nequipment should be subject to appropriate controls where there is a risk of metal contamination (e.g. use metal detectors in tabletting)\n\nchain drives and transmission gears are enclosed or properly covered\n\ntanks, hoppers and other similar fabricating equipment are equipped with covers\n\nOperate equipment in a way that prevents contamination.\n\nEnsure ovens, autoclaves and similar equipment contain only one raw material, in-process drug or drug at a time (unless precautions are taken to prevent contamination and mix-ups).\n\nLocate equipment in a way that prevents contamination from extraneous materials.\n\nPlace equipment in a way that optimizes the flow of material and minimizes the movement of personnel.\n\nLocate equipment so that production operations in the same area are compatible and to prevent cross-contamination between operations.\n\nLabel fixed pipework clearly to indicate the contents and (where applicable) the direction of flow.\n\nProvide dedicated production equipment where appropriate.\n\nOperate water purification, storage and distribution equipment in a way that ensures a reliable source of water of the proper chemical and microbial purity.\n\nMaintain equipment in a good state of repair.\n\nEnsure that equipment surfaces are free from cracks, peeling paint and other defects.\n\nEnsure gaskets are functional.\n\nAvoid the use of temporary devices (such as tape).\n\nMaintain equipment parts that come in contact with drugs to ensure drugs are fabricated or packaged in a way that keeps them free from contamination.\n\nMaintain equipment used for significant processing or testing operations according to a written preventative maintenance program. Keep maintenance records.\n\nDesign, locate and maintain equipment so that it serves its intended purpose.\n\nEnsure measuring devices are of a proper range, precision and accuracy. Calibrate this equipment on a scheduled basis and keep records.\n\nRemove equipment that is unsuitable for its intended use from fabrication, packaging/labelling and testing areas. When removal is not possible, clearly label equipment as unsuitable.\n\nEnsure equipment used during the critical steps of fabrication, packaging/labelling and testing (including computerized systems) is subject to qualification (as identified in your Validation Master Plan). Document all equipment qualification. For more information, see Guide to validation – drugs and supporting activities (GUI-0029) and PIC/S Annex 11: Computerised Systems.\n\nRequirements for computerized systems are detailed in section C.02.015 “Quality Control Department\" interpretation 8.f and section C.02.020–C02.024.1 “Records” interpretations 5 to 7.\n\nCalibrate, inspect or check equipment used for significant processing and testing operations according to a written program. Keep records. Ensure a system is in place to support identification of calibration status (you may use status labelling (tag) or some other method).\n\nIdentify equipment used for processing or testing operations with a unique number or code and maintain usage logs. These logs should include identification of products, dates of operation, cleaning and downtime due to frequent or serious malfunctions or breakdowns. Information collected will help identify negative performance trends.\n\nPersonnel\n\nC.02.006\n\nRationale\n\nYour senior management is responsible for providing adequate resources (materials, personnel, facilities and equipment). They must continually monitor and improve the effectiveness of your pharmaceutical quality system.\n\nWho you hire is one of the most important elements in any pharmaceutical operation. Without proper staff with a quality mindset and training, it is almost impossible to fabricate, package/label, test or store good quality drugs.\n\nIt is essential that only qualified staff supervise the fabrication of drugs. These operations are highly technical in nature and require constant vigilance, attention to detail, and a high degree of employee competence. The reason products often fail to meet required standards is because of poorly trained staff or a lack of understanding of the importance of production control.\n\nInterpretation\n\nThe person in charge of your quality control department (if you are a fabricator, packager/labeller, tester, importer or distributor) and the person in charge of your manufacturing department (if you are a fabricator or packager/labeller):\n\nmust hold a university degree; in Canada this must be a Canadian university degree or a degree recognized as equivalent by a Canadian university or Canadian accreditation body in a science related to the work being carried out\n\nmust have practical experience in their area of responsibility\n\ndirectly controls and personally supervises on site each working shift during which activities under their control are being conducted (for importers and distributors, the person in charge can be off-site in Canada if they are fully accessible to the quality control department and have enough knowledge of on-site operations to fulfill the responsibilities of the position)\n\nmay delegate duties and responsibility (for example, to cover all shifts) to a person who is qualified, while remaining accountable for those duties and responsibility (the person must have a diploma, certificate or other evidence of formal qualifications awarded after completion of a course of study at a university, college or technical institute in a science related to the work being carried out, combined with at least two years of relevant practical experience)\n\nThe person in charge of the quality control department of a wholesaler:\n\nmust be qualified by relevant academic training and experience\n\nmay delegate duties and responsibility to someone who meets the requirements under interpretation 2.a\n\nThe person responsible for packaging operations (including control over printed packaging materials and withdrawal of bulk drugs):\n\nmust be qualified by training and experience\n\nis directly responsible to the person in charge of the manufacturing department (or a person having the same qualifications)\n\nPersonnel in charge of secondary labelling operations and the quality control department:\n\nmust be qualified by relevant academic training and experience\n\ncan delegate their duties and responsibilities to a person who meets the requirements under interpretation 4.a\n\nEnsure enough personnel are available on site with the required qualifications and practical experience relevant to their responsibilities.\n\nDo not place so many responsibilities on any one individual that quality is put at risk.\n\nRecord specific duties for all responsible staff in a written work description.\n\nEnsure personnel have the authority to carry out their responsibilities.\n\nWhen key personnel are absent, appoint qualified replacements to carry out their duties and functions.\n\nEnsure all personnel conducting GMP activities are able to understand the written procedures for those activities.\n\nYour personnel must be aware of the principles of GMP that affect them. They must receive initial and continuing training relevant to their job responsibilities.\n\nFollow a written program and use qualified trainers to train personnel (including technical, maintenance and cleaning staff).\n\nAssess the effectiveness of continuing training periodically.\n\nProvide training before implementing new or revised standard operating procedures (SOPs).\n\nMaintain records of training.\n\nGive specific training to personnel working in areas where highly active, toxic, infectious or sensitizing materials are handled. Ensure access to relevant information (e.g. safety data sheets)\n\nReview the performance of all personnel periodically.\n\nConsultants and contractors must have the necessary qualifications, training and experience to advise on the subjects they are hired for.\n\nSanitation\n\nC.02.007\n\nRationale\n\nSanitation in a pharmaceutical plant influences the quality of drug products, as well as employee quality mindset. Drug products must be fabricated and packaged in areas that are free from environmental contamination and contamination by another drug.\n\nA written sanitation program provides some assurance that levels of cleanliness in your plant are maintained and that the provisions of sections 8 “Drugs” and 11 “Unsanitary manufacture, etc., of drug” in the Food and Drugs Act are satisfied.\n\nInterpretation\n\nEnsure you have a written sanitation program available on site if you fabricate or package/label drugs.\n\nDesign your sanitation program using quality risk management principles. Identify and reduce contamination risks in your facility design and operation (see interpretation 11, section C.02.004 “Premises”). Your sanitation program must contain procedures that describe the following:\n\ncleaning requirements that apply to all production areas of your plant, with emphasis on manufacturing areas that require special attention\n\nrequirements that apply to processing equipment\n\ncleaning intervals\n\nproducts for cleaning and disinfection, along with their dilution and the equipment to be used\n\nthe responsibilities of any outside contractor\n\ndisposal procedures for waste material and debris\n\npest control measures\n\nprecautions needed to prevent contamination of a drug when rodenticides, insecticides and fumigation agents are used\n\nmicrobial and environmental monitoring procedures (established based on quality risk management principles) that:\n\ndefine alert and action limits in areas where susceptible products are fabricated or packaged\n\ndescribe monitoring activities to ensure environmental conditions are met during production\n\nthe personnel responsible for carrying out cleaning procedures\n\nEnsure your sanitation program is implemented and effective in preventing unsanitary conditions.\n\nValidate cleaning procedures for manufacturing equipment based on Health Canada’s Cleaning Validation Guide (GUI-0028). This guide also provides guidance for establishing acceptable product residue limits.\n\nEnsure residues from the cleaning process (such as detergents and solvents) are removed from equipment.\n\nEnsure evidence is available to demonstrate that routine cleaning and storage of equipment does not allow microbial proliferation.\n\nFilter sanitizers and disinfectants (like isopropyl alcohol) to remove spores where needed.\n\nValidate analytical methods used to detect residues or contaminants. You can find guidance on analytical method validation in ICH Q2: Validation of Analytical Procedures: Text and Methodology or VICH GL2 Validation of analytical procedures : Methodology as applicable or any standard listed in Schedule B to the Act.\n\nCampaign production can be accepted where—on a product by product basis—proper justification is provided, validation is conducted, and rigorous validated controls and monitoring are in place that show that any risk of cross-contamination is minimized.\n\nMake sure the personnel who supervise your sanitation program are:\n\nqualified by training or experience\n\ndirectly responsible to a person who has the qualifications described under section C.02.006 “Personnel”.\n\nContain dusty operations. Avoid using unit or portable dust collectors in fabrication areas, especially in dispensing. If you do use them, ensure the effectiveness of their exhaust filtration is demonstrated and the units are regularly maintained according to written approved procedures.\n\nC.02.008\n\nRationale\n\nThe health, behaviour and clothing of your employees can contribute to product contamination. Poor personal hygiene will offset even the best sanitation program and greatly increase the risk of product contamination.\n\nInterpretation\n\nMake minimum health requirements available in writing.\n\nEnsure staff who have access to any area where a drug is exposed during fabrication or packaging/labelling have a thorough medical examination before starting work. Staff should receive periodic medical examinations based on their job requirements. Ensure qualified healthcare professionals authorized under their professional practice perform the medical examinations for communicable diseases.\n\nYou should not let anyone who is a known carrier of a communicable disease have access to any area where a drug is exposed.\n\nThe likelihood of a disease being transmitted through a drug product depends on the nature of the disease and the type of work the person carries out. Some diseases could be transmitted through a drug product if proper hygiene procedures are not followed by an infected person handling the product. You may need to consult with a doctor.\n\nA person may also be a carrier of a communicable disease and not be aware of it. So in addition to having strict personal hygiene procedures, you should have systems in place to provide an effective barrier that prevents product contamination. All personnel must follow these procedures at all times. If an employee is found to be a carrier of a communicable disease, contact Health Canada and perform a risk assessment to determine if there is any product impact.\n\nTell employees to report any health conditions that could adversely affect drug products to their supervisor.\n\nConduct supervisory checks to prevent any person who has an apparent illness or open lesions that may adversely affect the quality of drugs from handling exposed materials and drugs. The person must not handle exposed raw materials, primary packaging materials, in-process drugs or drugs until the condition is no longer judged to be a risk.\n\nAssess each employee's health before allowing them to return to the workplace after an absence due to an illness that may adversely affect the quality of products.\n\nEnsure a procedure is in place that describes what actions to take if a person who has been handling exposed raw materials, primary packaging materials, in-process drugs or drugs is found to have a communicable disease.\n\nEnsure all personnel who conduct visual inspections get periodic eye exams and/or periodic requalification.\n\nClearly define clothing requirements and hygiene procedures for staff and visitors in your written hygiene program.\n\nEnsure employees wear clean clothing and protective covering where a potential for contaminating a raw material, in-process material or drug exists. Have written procedures in place covering basic clothing requirements (such as protective garments and hair and beard covering) for any person entering manufacturing areas.\n\nYou may need more stringent requirements (such as a mask, dedicated shoes and clothes providing a higher level of protection) for operators working with exposed product.\n\nEnsure operators avoid direct skin contact with raw materials, primary packaging materials, equipment, in-process drugs or drugs.\n\nDo not allow unsanitary practices (such as smoking, eating, drinking and chewing) or allow staff to keep plants, food, drink, smoking material or personal medicines in production areas (or any other areas where they might adversely affect product quality).\n\nOutline requirements for personal hygiene (with an emphasis on hand hygiene). Ensure they are followed by employees.\n\nOutline requirements concerning cosmetics and jewellery worn by employees. Ensure they are followed by employees.\n\nStore soiled protective garments (if reusable) in separate containers until properly laundered and (if necessary) disinfected or sterilized. Ensure a formalized procedure for washing protective garments under the control of your company is in place. Washing garments in a domestic setting is unacceptable.\n\nRaw material testing\n\nC.02.009\n\nRationale\n\nTesting raw materials before you use them has two objectives:\n\nConfirm the identity of the raw materials.\n\nConfirm that the raw materials have the properties that will provide the desired quality, quantity or yield in a given manufacturing process.\n\nFor guidance on the control and testing of raw materials used for the manufacture of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), see Health Canada's Good manufacturing practices for active pharmaceutical ingredients (GUI-0104 and ICH Q7: Good Manufacturing Practices Guide for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients.\n\nHealth Canada encourages you to identify and qualify alternate suppliers for critical raw materials, with appropriate regulatory approval where applicable.\n\nInterpretation\n\nEnsure each raw material used to produce a drug is covered by specifications (see section C.02.002). These specifications must be approved and dated by the person in charge of your quality control department or by a designated alternate who meets the requirements described under section C.02.006, interpretation 1.d.\n\nEnsure your specifications for any raw material include or provide reference to (if applicable):\n\na description of materials, including the:\n\ndesignated name and internal reference code\n\nreference (if any) to the applicable standard for the raw material (e.g. prescribed standard, pharmacopoeia, in-house standard)\n\napproved fabricator\n\na list of tests, references to analytical procedures, and appropriate acceptance criteria\n\nstorage conditions and precautions\n\nthe maximum period of storage before re-test or expiry\n\nMake sure your specifications of raw materials comply with current versions of:\n\nthe marketing authorization\n\na recognized pharmacopoeia\n\nWhere appropriate, include other properties or qualities not addressed by the pharmacopoeia (for example, particle size, polymorphs, density, etc.) in the specifications.\n\nWhere a recognized pharmacopoeia (Schedule B of the Food and Drugs Act) contains a specification for microbial content, include that requirement.\n\nUse purified water (that meets any standard listed in Schedule B of the Act)when formulating a non-sterile drug product, unless otherwise required in one of these standards or the marketing authorization.\n\nInclude requirements in your specifications for total microbial count, which should not exceed 100 colony forming units (cfu)/ml.\n\nMonitor purified water on a routine basis to confirm absence of objectionable microorganisms. The purpose of the water and its use in different dosage forms will dictate which organisms are considered objectionable (for example, Escherichia coli and Salmonella for water used for oral preparations, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa for water used for topical preparations).\n\nUse water for injection (WFI) to formulate parenteral, irrigation and intra-ocular products. Purified water may be used to formulate ophthalmic products.\n\nEstablish alert and action limits for bacterial endotoxins and microbial load. These limits should meet any standard listed in Schedule B to the Act.\n\nWhile in use during processing, ensure WFI is sampled daily from at least two points on a rotating basis (so as to cover all outlets).\n\nTest water used in the preparation of parenterals for endotoxins. Ensure it complies with its approved specifications.\n\nTest water used for the final rinsing of container components that are used for parenteral drugs for endotoxins, unless such components are depyrogenated afterwards.\n\nEnsure gases used in manufacturing are of an appropriate grade. Monitor compressed air that comes into direct contact with primary contact surfaces, materials and/or the product to control the level of particulates, humidity, microbial contamination, and the absence of hydrocarbons (where applicable). The limits you use should take into consideration the stage of manufacture, product, and so on. Other tests might be needed depending on the nature of the product.\n\nValidate test methods and document the results of validation studies. Full validation is not needed for methods included in any standard listed in Schedule B to the Act. But if you use one of these methods, you must establish its suitability under actual conditions of use. This may include using the method for monitoring additional specified impurities that are not listed in the compendial monograph. Conduct method transfer studies when applicable.\n\nYou can find guidance on validating particular types of methods in ICH Q2: Validation of Analytical Procedures: Text and Methodology or VICH GL2 Validation of Analytical Procedures : Methodology as applicable or any standard listed in Schedule B to the Act.\n\nYou should have impurity specifications based on the impurity profile for each active ingredient and in accordance with the marketing authorization. For further detail on impurity profiles, refer to Good manufacturing practices for active pharmaceutical ingredients (GUI-0104) and ICH Q7: Good Manufacturing Practices Guide for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients.\n\nICH Q7 defines an impurity profile as “A description of the identified and unidentified impurities present in an API.” A description of identified and detectable unidentified impurities which are usually present in the raw material must be developed early on and maintained for each raw material. Where applicable, the maximum permissible amounts of each impurity should be recorded. Each commercial lot should be comparable in purity to this profile.\n\nWe can also call this profile a “reference profile” because the quality control department refers to it:\n\nwhen assessing the purity of each batch of active pharmaceutical ingredients (API)\n\nwhen evaluating the viability of proposed process changes\n\nIt is important for you to understand and control impurities in raw materials to avoid contamination (e.g. nitrosamines). For more information on the control of impurities, please see:\n\nICH Q3A: Impurities in New Drug Substances\n\nICH Q3B: Impurities in New Drug Products\n\nICH M7: Genotoxic Impurities – Assessment and Control of DNA Reactive (Mutagenic) Impurities in Pharmaceuticals to Limit Potential Carcinogenic Risk\n\nVICH GL10 Impurities in New Veterinary Drug Substances\n\nVICH GL11 Impurities in New Veterinary Medicinal Products\n\nTest a representative sample of each lot of raw material fully against specifications, using a statistically valid plan. Your sampling plan should be properly justified and based on a quality risk management principle.\n\nCarry out and record sampling according to approved, written procedures that describe:\n\nthe method of sampling\n\nthe equipment to be used\n\nthe amount of sample to be taken\n\ninstructions for any required sub-division of the sample\n\nthe type and condition of sample container to be used\n\nthe identification of the container sampled\n\nany special precautions to be observed, especially when sampling sterile or toxic materials\n\nthe storage conditions\n\ninstructions for cleaning and storing sampling equipment\n\nIn addition to the testing required in interpretation 9, test each container of a lot of raw material for the identity of its contents using a specifically discriminating identity test.\n\nInstead of testing each container for identity, you may test a composite sample (derived from sampling each container), as long as you meet the following conditions:\n\nA suitable test exists.\n\nThe number of individual containers for each composite sample does not exceed 10.\n\nA potency test is performed on each composite sample.\n\nInstead of testing each container for identity, you may test only a proportion of the containers, as long as there is evidence to ensure that no single container of raw material has been incorrectly labelled.\n\nInterpretation 11.b applies to raw material coming from a single product fabricator or plant. It also applies if it comes directly from a manufacturer (or in the manufacturer’s sealed container) and there is a history of reliability. (In this case, regular audits of the manufacturer’s quality assurance system must be conducted by or on behalf of the purchaser/drug fabricator.)\n\nThe available evidence should include an on-site audit report of the vendor by a person who meets the requirements of interpretation 1 under section C.02.006 “Personnel”. The audit report should address at least the following:\n\nthe nature and status of the manufacturer and the supplier, and their understanding of the GMP requirements of the pharmaceutical industry\n\nthe quality assurance system of the raw material manufacturer\n\nthe manufacturing conditions under which the raw material is produced and controlled\n\nProvided that you meet the requirements outlined in interpretations 11.b.i, you may conduct identity testing on representative samples. You should statistically determine the number of samples taken to prepare the representative sample and specify this number in a sampling plan. You should also define the number of individual samples that may be blended to form a composite sample, taking into account the nature of the material, knowledge of the supplier, and homogeneity of the composite sample.\n\nInterpretation 11.b does not apply when the raw material is used to formulate parenterals or is supplied by intermediaries (such as brokers), where the source of manufacture is unknown or not audited.\n\nEnsure each container in a batch is sampled and its contents positively identified when the raw material is handled in any substantial way (e.g. repackaged by a third party) after leaving the site of its fabrication.\n\nOnly use raw materials that have been released by your quality control department and are not past their established re-test date or expiry date in fabrication.\n\nIf you have any raw material in storage after the established re-test date, you must quarantine it.\n\nA batch of raw material can be re-tested and used immediately (within 30 days) after the re-test, as long as it continues to comply with the current specifications. The re-test date or expiry date is based on acceptable stability data developed under predefined storage conditions or on any other acceptable evidence.\n\nDo not use a raw material held in storage after the established expiry date in fabrication.\n\nIdentifying and choosing raw material vendors is an important operation. You should involve staff who have a particular and thorough knowledge of the materials and suppliers. Their knowledge of materials should include an understanding of risk and certification where required (e.g. Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE)/Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathy (TSE) risks).\n\nOnly source raw materials from approved fabricators named in the relevant specifications.\n\nEnsure active ingredients are manufactured by a Canadian fabricator holding an establishment licence, or by a foreign building identified on a Canadian establishment licence of the importer, as appropriate.\n\nConsider the quality compliance history of the raw material vendor when sourcing raw materials.\n\nC.02.010\n\nRationale\n\nSection C.02.010 outlines options for carrying out the testing required in section C.02.009. Sourcing raw materials is an important operation that requires specific and in-depth knowledge of the raw materials and their fabricator in order to maintain consistency and quality when fabricating drug product. Raw materials should come from reliable fabricators.\n\nInterpretation\n\nTesting other than identity testing: Perform testing on a sample of the raw material taken after the fabricator who formulates the raw material into dosage form receives it on their premises (unless the vendor is certified).\n\nIf you have a raw material vendor certification program, document it in a standard operating procedure. At a minimum, your program must include the following:\n\na written agreement outlining the specific responsibilities of each party involved, and specifying:\n\nthe content and format of the certificate of analysis, which presents actual numerical results and refers to the batch number, raw material specifications and validated test methods used\n\nthat the raw material vendor must inform the drug fabricator of any changes in the processing or specifications of the raw material\n\nthat the raw material vendor must inform the drug fabricator if there is any significant deviation during the manufacturing of a particular batch of raw material\n\nan audit report\n\nFor medicinal ingredients/APIs, the audit report must be issued by a qualified authority, a regulatory authority, a qualified body (such as the European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines and HealthCare (EDQM) or the World Health Organization (WHO)). The report must show that the API vendor complies with ICH Q7: Good Manufacturing Practices Guide for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (or with any standard or system of equivalent quality). For certain drugs (or if a recent report is not available), an on-site audit of the API vendor (against the same standard or its equivalent) by a person who meets the requirements of interpretation 1 under Section C.02.006 “Personnel” is acceptable. See How to demonstrate foreign building compliance with drug good manufacturing practices (GUI-0080) for more information.\n\nFor other raw materials, an audit report based on a regular on-site audit performed by a person who meets the requirements of interpretation 1 under section C.02.006 “Personnel” is acceptable.\n\nfull confirmatory testing of the first three lots of each raw material received from a vendor, and after any significant change to the manufacturing process\n\nYou must also have a copy of the residual solvent profile and, for medicinal ingredients, a copy of the impurity profile.\n\na description of how re-testing failures and re-qualification of the vendor are to be addressed\n\nthe list of raw materials not subject to the reduced testing program (e.g. reprocessed lots)\n\nfull confirmatory testing on a minimum of one lot per year of a raw material received from each vendor (choose the raw material on a rotational basis)\n\nIn addition, where multiple raw materials are received from the same vendor, you must carry out confirmatory testing for each raw material at least once every five years.\n\na document issued for each vendor, verifying that the vendor meets the criteria for certification\n\nThe document must be approved by your quality control department and updated periodically.\n\nGenerally, due to the nature of its operations, a broker or wholesaler of raw materials cannot be directly certified. However, when a broker or wholesaler supplies materials received from the original vendor without changing the existing labels, packaging, certificate of analysis and general information, then certification of the original source is still acceptable.\n\nIf new certificates are issued by or on behalf of repackers/reprocessors, agents or brokers, these certificates should show the name, address and telephone number of the lab that performed the analysis. They should also contain a reference to the name and address of the original manufacturer and to the original batch certificate. Attach a copy of the original certificate to the new certificates.\n\nIdentity testing: Conduct specific identity testing on all lots of any raw material received on the premises of the person who formulates the raw material into dosage forms. Perform this identity testing according to section C.02.009 “Raw Material Testing,” interpretations 9 to 11.\n\nIf you perform the identity test in C.02.010 “Raw Material Testing,” interpretation 2 and if your quality control department approves, you may use the lot of raw material selected for confirmatory testing in fabrication before completing all tests.\n\nEnsure transportation and storage conditions prevent changes to the potency, purity or physical characteristics of the raw material. To show these conditions have been met, you must have standard operating procedures and records for shipping and receiving that contain:\n\nthe type of immediate packaging for the raw material\n\nthe labelling requirements (including storage conditions and special precautions or warnings) for the packaged raw material\n\nthe mode(s) of transportation approved for shipping the packaged raw material\n\na description of how the packaged raw material is sealed\n\nthe verification needed to ensure that each package has not been tampered with and that there are no damaged containers\n\nevidence that special shipping requirements (like refrigeration) have been met if required\n\nIf a delivery or shipment of raw material is made up of different batches, you must consider each batch as separate for the purposes of sampling, testing and release.\n\nIf the same batch of raw material is received later on, you must also consider this batch as separate for the purposes of sampling, testing and release.\n\nHowever, full testing to specifications may not be needed if all these conditions are met:\n\na specifically discriminating identity test or combination of tests is conducted\n\nthe raw material has not been repackaged or re-labelled\n\nthe raw material is within the re-test date assigned by its vendor\n\nevidence is available to show that all pre-established transportation and storage conditions have been maintained\n\nManufacturing control\n\nC.02.011\n\nRationale\n\nYou must take measures to maintain the integrity of a drug product. This includes from the moment the raw materials enter your plant to the time you release the finished dosage form for sale and distribution. These measures should be documented to ensure that all of your processes are clearly defined, monitored, and systematically reviewed. They also demonstrate that your processes can consistently provide drug products that comply with their established specifications for quality.\n\nInterpretation\n\nGeneral\n\nRestrict production area access to designated personnel. Review the list of designated personnel periodically.\n\nHandle all raw materials, products and packaging materials according to pre-approved written procedures or instructions. This includes receiving, quarantining, sampling, storing, tracking, labelling, dispensing, processing, packaging and distributing. Keep records.\n\nEnsure that when you receive raw materials, packaging materials, intermediates and bulk drugs, you account for, document, label and hold them in quarantine until they are released by your quality control department.\n\nClean containers (where necessary) when you receive them, and label them with the required information.\n\nFor each delivery, check all containers for:\n\ncorrect labelling (including the name used by the supplier as stated in the specification)\n\ncompliance with information on the purchase order and shipping documentation\n\nRecord damage to containers, broken seals, evidence of tampering or contamination, and any other problems (such as temperature excursions) that might adversely affect the quality of a material. Report these problems to your quality control department and investigate them.\n\nYou must have procedures in place to ensure the identity of the contents of each container. Identify the containers that samples have been taken from.\n\nConfirm identity before mixing incoming materials with existing stock (e.g. solvents or stocks in silos). Create procedures for preventing mix-up when discharging incoming materials into existing stock.\n\nIf bulk deliveries are made in non-dedicated tankers, you should have measures in place to prevent cross-contamination (such as obtaining a certificate of cleaning, testing for trace impurities, or auditing the supplier).\n\nEnsure labels for bulk drugs, in-process drugs, raw materials and packaging materials have the following information (or provide traceability under a validated electronic system to):\n\nthe designated name and (if applicable) the code or reference number of the material\n\nthe specific batch number(s) given by the vendor, and receiving batch number issued upon receipt by the fabricator or packager/labeller\n\nthe disposition status of the contents (e.g. in quarantine, on test, released, rejected, to be returned or recalled)\n\nan expiry date or retest date\n\nthe stage of manufacturing of in-process material (if applicable)\n\nMake sure raw materials, packaging materials, intermediates, bulk drugs and finished products are:\n\nstored in locations that are separate and removed from immediate manufacturing areas, with controls in place that ensure batch segregation and stock rotation\n\ntransported under conditions determined by your quality control department to preserve their quality and safety\n\nOnly use materials released by your quality control department that are within their expiry date/retest date.\n\nBefore starting any processing operation, take and document all needed steps to ensure that your work area and equipment are clean (within the validated clean hold time). Ensure they are free from any raw materials, products, product residues, labels or documents not required for the current operation.\n\nOperations on different products should not be carried out at the same time or after each other in the same room, unless there is no risk of mix-up or cross-contamination.\n\nIf you implement validated changeover procedures, you may fabricate or package/label non-medicinal products in areas or with equipment that is also used to produce drugs.\n\nCarry out checks to ensure that transfer lines, hoses and other pieces of equipment used to transfer products from one area to another are correctly connected and do not pose a contamination risk.\n\nEnsure all materials, bulk containers, major items of equipment and rooms used are labelled (or otherwise identified). You should indicate the product or material being processed, its strength, the batch number, and (if appropriate) the stage of manufacturing. For equipment, vessels and rooms, this may include their clean status.\n\nProtect products and materials properly from microbial and other contamination at every stage of processing.\n\nMake sure qualified personnel dispense and verify raw materials following a written procedure. They must ensure that the correct materials are accurately weighed or measured into clean and properly labelled containers. Ensure raw materials that are being staged are properly sealed and stored under conditions consistent with the accepted storage conditions for that material.\n\nCheck measuring devices regularly for accuracy and precision. Keep records of all checks.\n\nEnsure that in-process control activities performed within production areas do not pose any risk to the quality of the product.\n\nCarry out checks on yields and reconciliation of quantities at appropriate stages of the process to ensure that yields are within acceptable limits. Record and investigate deviations from expected yields.\n\nAvoid any deviation from instructions or procedures. If deviations happen record them — have qualified personnel investigate and write a report that describes the deviation, the investigation, the impact of the deviation, the rationale for disposition of any associated materials or products, and any follow-up activities required. Your quality control department must approve the report and maintain records.\n\nClearly mark rejected materials and products. Store them separately in restricted areas, or control them using a system that ensures that they are either returned to their vendors or (where appropriate) reprocessed or destroyed. Record any actions taken.\n\nValidation\n\nValidate all critical production processes. For more information, see Guide to validation – drugs and supporting activities (GUI-0029).\n\nConduct validation studies according to predefined protocols. Follow validation protocols approved in marketing authorization submissions. Prepare, evaluate, approve and maintain a written report summarizing recorded results and conclusions.\n\nValidate changes to production processes, systems, equipment, materials or suppliers that may affect product quality and/or process reproducibility before implementing them.\n\nEvaluate critical processes and related procedures periodically to ensure they remain capable of achieving the intended results.\n\nManufacturing master formula\n\nEnsure processing operations are covered by a master formula. The master formula should be in accordance with the marketing authorization. The master formula must be prepared by—and subject to independent checks by—production and quality control personnel who have the qualifications described under section C.02.006 “Personnel”, interpretation 1.\n\nWrite the master formula to provide not less than 100% of label claim. Overages may be allowed to compensate for processing losses. They must be documented with justification and be in accordance with the marketing authorization. For more requirements on limits of variability, see section C.01.062 of the Regulations. In exceptional cases, overages to compensate for losses due to degradation during manufacturing or shelf life must be scientifically justified and in accordance with the marketing authorization.\n\nMaster formulae must also include the following:\n\nan identifier of the product, with a reference code relating to its specifications\n\nthe version number\n\na description of the dosage form, strength of the product, and batch size\n\na list of all raw materials to be used and the amount of each, using the designated name and a reference that is unique to that material, and including any processing aids that may not be present in the final product\n\na statement of the expected final yield (along with the acceptable limits) and relevant intermediate yields (where applicable)\n\nidentification of the principal equipment to be used and (if applicable) internal codes\n\nthe procedures (or reference to the procedures) to be used for preparing the critical equipment (e.g. cleaning, assembling, calibrating, sterilizing)\n\ndetailed stepwise processing instructions (e.g. checks on materials, pre-treatment, sequence for adding materials, mixing times, mixing speeds or temperatures)\n\nthe instructions for any in-process controls, along with their limits\n\nwhere needed, the requirements for environmental controls, storage of products and in-process materials, labelling storage conditions, maximum validated hold time, and any special precautions to be observed\n\nPackaging master formula\n\nEnsure packaging operations are covered by a master formula. Where applicable, the master formula should be in accordance with the marketing authorization. The master formula must be prepared by—and subject to independent checks by—packaging/labelling and quality control personnel who have the qualifications described under section C.02.006 “Personnel”.\n\nIn the case of a packaged product, ensure the master formula also includes the following for each product, package size and type:\n\nthe name of the product, with a reference code relating to its specifications\n\nthe version number\n\na description of the dosage form and strength of the product\n\nthe package size (expressed in terms of the number, weight or volume of the product in the final container)\n\na complete list of all the packaging materials required for a standard batch size (including quantities, sizes and types), with the code or reference number relating to the specifications for each packaging material\n\nwhere appropriate, an example or reproduction of the relevant printed packaging materials and specimens, indicating where the batch number and expiry date of the product are to be positioned\n\nspecial precautions to be observed, including a careful examination of the packaging area and equipment, including transfer lines and hoses (to ascertain the line clearance before operations begin)—record all verifications\n\na description of the packaging operations, including any significant subsequent secondary operations and the equipment to be used\n\ndetails of in-process controls, with instructions for sampling and acceptance limits\n\nthe expected final yield, with the acceptable limits\n\nwhere needed, the requirements for environmental controls, storage conditions of bulk and finished products, maximum validated packaging time, and any special precautions to be observed\n\nManufacturing operations\n\nCheck all materials in the production area when they are received for cleanliness, quantity, identity and conformity with the manufacturing records.\n\nEnsure each batch processed is effectively governed by a uniquely numbered batch record. This record should be prepared and verified by qualified personnel from the master production documents in a way that prevents errors.\n\nInclude the following information on or with the manufacturing batch record, as it becomes available during the process\n\ndates and times of production and of the start and completion of significant intermediate stages (such as blending and heating)\n\nthe receiving batch number and quantity of each raw material actually weighed and dispensed (for active raw material, the quantity is to be adjusted if the assay value is less than 98.0%, calculated on “as is” basis and on which the master formula was based)\n\nthe identification of personnel performing each significant step of the process, and of the person who checked each of these steps (such as weighing and adding a material to the batch)\n\nWhen the weighing and adding of materials to the batch is performed by validated and automated equipment, the degree of verification needed depends on the level of automation and validation.\n\nthe actual results of the in-process quality checks performed at appropriate stages of the process, and the identification of the person carrying them out\n\nthe actual yield of the batch at appropriate stages of processing and the actual final yields, along with explanations for any deviations from the expected yield\n\nafter completion, the signature of the person responsible for the processing operations\n\nYou may replace written batch records with validated electronic systems. Additional details on electronic systems can be found in the records section of this guide under C.02.020–C02.024.1.\n\nEnsure all manufacturing records are created, maintained, processed and reviewed as outlined in your establishment's data governance system.\n\nOnly combine batches with your quality control department’s approval and according to pre-established written procedures.\n\nYou must approve beforehand the introduction of part of a previous batch (conforming to the required quality) into the next batch of the same product at a defined stage of fabrication. Carry out this recovery according to a validated procedure and record it.\n\nPackaging operations\n\nPerform packaging operations according to comprehensive and detailed written operating procedures or specifications. These procedures/specifications must include:\n\nthe identification of equipment and packaging lines used to package the drug\n\nthe proper separation and (if necessary) dedication of packaging lines that are packaging different drugs\n\ndisposal procedures for unused printed packaging materials and rejected materials from the packaging operation\n\nEnsure packaging orders are individually numbered and include the batch number, expiry date and quantity of bulk product to be packaged, as well as the planned quantity of finished product that will be obtained. This record should be prepared and verified by qualified personnel from the master production documents in a way that prevents errors.\n\nBefore beginning any packaging operation, check that the equipment and work station are clear of previous products, documents and materials that are not needed for the planned packaging operations. Ensure equipment is clean (within the validated clean hold time) and suitable for use. Record all checks.\n\nCheck all products and packaging materials on receipt at the packaging line for cleanliness, quantity, identity and conformity with the packaging instructions.\n\nTake precautions to ensure that containers to be filled are free from contamination.\n\nEnsure the name and batch number of the product being handled is displayed at each packaging station or line.\n\nEnsure packaging orders include the following information (recorded at the time each action is taken):\n\nthe date(s) and time(s) of the packaging operations\n\nthe quantity, lot number, and/or analytical control number of each packaging material and bulk drug issued for use\n\nthe packaging line used\n\nidentification of the personnel who are supervising packaging operations and the withdrawal of bulks\n\nidentification of the operators of the different significant steps\n\nthe checks made for identity and conformity with the packaging instructions (including the results of in-process controls)\n\na check for whether on-line printing is correct\n\na check for the correct functioning of line monitors, electronic imaging, or vision systems\n\nhandling precautions applied to a partly packaged product\n\nnotes on any special problems, including details of any deviation from the packaging instructions (with written approval by qualified personnel)\n\nthe quantity of finished product actually obtained\n\na reconciliation of the quantity of printed packaging material and bulk drug used, destroyed or returned to stock\n\nTo prevent mix-ups, do not return samples taken away from the packaging line.\n\nWhenever possible, attach samples of the printed packaging materials used (including specimens bearing the batch number, expiry date and any additional overprinting) to packaging orders.\n\nFollow filling and sealing as quickly as possible by labelling. If labelling is delayed, have measures to ensure that no mix-ups or mislabelling can occur.\n\nOnce the packaging operation is complete, destroy any unused batch-coded packaging materials and record their disposal. Follow a procedure if non-coded printed materials are returned to stock.\n\nDestroy outdated or obsolete packaging materials and record their disposal.\n\nEnsure that products involved in non-standard events during packaging are inspected and investigated by qualified personnel. Keep a detailed record of this operation.\n\nWhen reconciling the amount of bulk product with the number of units packaged, investigate and account for any significant or unusual discrepancy observed before release.\n\nWhen reconciling the amount of printed packaging materials with the number of units packaged, investigate and account for any discrepancy observed before release. If you validate electronic verification of all printed packaging materials on the packaging line, you may not need a full reconciliation.\n\nEnsure printed packaging materials are:\n\nstored in an area with access restricted to designated personnel who are supervised by personnel qualified according to interpretation 3 or 4 of section C.02.006 “Personnel”, as applicable\n\nwithdrawn against a packaging order\n\nissued and checked by personnel who have the qualifications outlined under interpretation 3 or 4 of section C.02.006 “Personnel” as applicable\n\nidentified in a way that makes them distinguishable during packaging operations\n\nTo prevent mix-ups, you should use roll-fed labels instead of cut labels. Avoid gang printing (printing more than one item of labelling on a sheet of material).\n\nStore and transport cut labels, cartons and other loose printed materials in separate closed containers.\n\nOn-line verification of all labels by automated electronic means can be helpful in preventing mix-ups. Conduct checks to ensure that any electronic code readers, label counters or similar devices are operating correctly.\n\nTake special care when cut labels are used, when overprinting is carried out off-line, and in hand-packaging operations. In these cases, have one operator perform a 100% examination for correct labeling during or after labelling operations. Have a second operator independently verify this.\n\nCheck and record the performance of any printing (e.g. of code numbers or expiry dates) to ensure it is correct.\n\nEnsure every package of a drug is identified by a lot number and an expiry date.\n\nFinished products\n\nHold all in-process and finished products in quarantine. Identify them as such until released by your quality control department.\n\nAnnual product quality review\n\nConduct regular periodic or rolling quality reviews of all drugs. These reviews should be conducted annually but longer frequencies are acceptable if suitably justified. Verify the consistency of your existing process and the appropriateness of current specifications for raw materials, primary packaging materials and finished product. Highlight any trends and identify product and process improvements. Conduct and document these reviews for all products and batches produced using a common process, taking into account previous reviews. Include at least a review of:\n\ncritical in-process controls, finished product testing results and specifications\n\nall batches that failed to meet established specification(s) and their investigation\n\npost-marketing commitments, where applicable\n\nall significant deviations or non-conformances, their related investigations, and the effectiveness of corrective and preventative actions taken\n\nall changes carried out to the processes, analytical methods, raw materials, packaging materials or critical suppliers\n\nthe results of the continuing stability program and any adverse trends\n\nall quality-related returns, complaints and recalls, and the investigations performed at the time\n\nthe adequacy of any previous corrective actions related to product process or equipment\n\nthe qualification status of principal equipment and utilities\n\nagreements (to ensure they are up-to-date)\n\nYou may group quality reviews by product type (e.g. solid dosage forms, liquid dosage forms, sterile products) where scientifically justified.\n\nYour quality control department (if you are an importer or distributor) should ensure that the annual product quality review is performed in a timely manner and is accurate.\n\nWhere required, you should have an agreement in place between the various parties involved in a review (e.g. importer, distributor, fabricator). This agreement should define each party’s responsibilities in producing and assessing the quality review and taking any corrective and preventative actions. The scope of an importer’s Annual Product Quality Report (APQR) should extend to all batches made using the same process, specifications, facilities and formulation as the imported product, not limited to the batches received in Canada.\n\nYour quality control department should evaluate the results of this review, and assess whether corrective and preventative action or revalidation should be undertaken. Document reasons for any corrective actions. Carry out corrective and preventative actions in a timely and effective way. You should have procedures for the ongoing management and review of these actions, and verify how effective these procedures are during self-inspection.\n\nC.02.012\n\nRationale\n\nA recall removes from the market a drug that either:\n\ndoes not conform to the Act or Regulations\n\npresents a risk to consumer health\n\nDrugs that have left the premises of a fabricator, packager/labeller, distributor, wholesaler or importer may end up in a number of locations. Depending on the non-compliance and how serious the health risk is, you may need to recall a product from the market. If you are a fabricator, packager/labeller, distributor, wholesaler or importer, you are expected to be able to recall to the consumer level if needed. More guidance on recalls can be found in Recall policy for health products (POL-0016).\n\nThis regulation also requires fabricators, packagers/labellers, distributors, wholesalers and importers to maintain a program of self-inspection. The purpose of self-inspection is to evaluate whether all aspects of production and quality control comply with good manufacturing practices (GMP). A self-inspection program detects any shortcomings in the implementation of GMP and recommends corrective actions.\n\nDrugs offered for sale—whether they are produced in Canada or imported—must meet the requirements of Part C, Division 2 of the Food and Drug Regulations. If production and analysis are contracted out, they must be correctly defined, agreed upon, and controlled to avoid misunderstandings that could result in a product, work or analysis of poor quality. There should be a written agreement between the parties involved, clearly establishing the duties of each party.\n\nInterpretation\n\nRecall\n\nYou must have a written recall system in place to comply with article 21.3 of the Food and Drugs Act and section C.01.051 “Recalls” of the Regulations. It must include the following steps:\n\nNotify Health Canada of the recall. This notification may include an assessment of the impact that any recall action may have on the market availability of the drug.\n\nNotify all Canadian and foreign establishments involved in the fabrication, distribution or importation of the recalled product.\n\nTake prompt action to recall a product suspected or known to be in violation, according to a pre-determined plan. The procedures to be followed must be in writing and known to all concerned.\n\nIdentify the person(s) responsible for initiating and co-ordinating all recall activities.\n\nYou must be able to carry out your recall procedure at any time, during and outside normal working hours. You may use a voice mail system or an electronic means as part of your provisions for off-hours product recall activation. It should indicate appropriate contact information. Include the use of any voice mail system or other electronic means functions and monitoring requirements in your written procedures.\n\nYour recall procedure must outline the way to communicate and implement a recall and decide its extent.\n\nYour distribution records must enable tracing of each drug product. This includes any products in transit, any samples that have been removed by the quality control department, and any professional samples that have been distributed.\n\nIf you are a wholesaler, you must get drug products from companies that hold an establishment licence as required in Part C, Division 1A of the Regulations. This facilitates a system of control that permits complete and rapid recall.\n\nWhen the importer or distributor assumes some or all of the wholesaler’s responsibilities with respect to recalls, a written agreement must clearly describe each party’s responsibilities. The quality agreement must provide understanding of the wholesaler’s drug distribution supply chain.\n\nIdentify recalled products and store them separately in a secure area until their disposition is determined.\n\nAssess and record the progress and effectiveness of the recall at intervals. Issue a final report (including a final reconciliation).\n\nVerify the adequacy of recall procedures periodically. If a recall has not taken place, this may be achieved by carrying out a mock recall. Your quality control department should review and approve reports of these mock recalls.\n\nFor more information on recall procedures and drug shortages, see:\n\nDrug Shortages in Canada\n\nGuide to reporting drug shortages and discontinuations (GUI-0120)\n\nRecall Policy for health products (POL-0016)\n\nDrug and natural health products recall guide (GUI-0039)\n\nSelf-inspection\n\nYou must have a self-inspection program appropriate to your establishment's operations. This program must ensure compliance with Part C, Division 2 of the Regulations.\n\nYou must have a comprehensive written procedure that describes the functions of your self-inspection program.\n\nIf you are a fabricator who processes a drug from raw material through to dosage form, your program must address itself to all aspects of the operation. If you are a packager/labeller, distributor, importer or wholesaler who only packages and/or distributes drugs fabricated by another fabricator, your written program must cover only those aspects of the operations that you exercise control over on your premises.\n\nYour self-inspection team must include personnel or consultants who are suitably trained and qualified in GMP.\n\nYou must carry out periodic self-inspections.\n\nYour senior management must review reports on the findings of the inspections and on corrective actions. Implement corrective actions in a timely way.\n\nOutsourced activities\n\nIf you outsource any fabrication, packaging/labelling or testing activities, you must have a written agreement between the contract giver and the contract acceptor. You must clearly establish the responsibilities of each party to avoid misunderstandings that could result in a product or operation of poor quality. Ensure all arrangements for contract fabrication, packaging/labelling or testing comply with the marketing authorization for the drug product and API concerned.\n\nThe contract giver\n\nIf you are the contract giver, you are ultimately responsible to ensure processes are in place to control outsourced activities. Your quality system should include the control and review of any outsourced activities.\n\nYou are responsible for assessing the contract acceptor's continuing competence to carry out the work or tests required, according to the principles of GMP described in this guideline.\n\nIf you are a distributor of drugs fabricated, packaged/labelled and tested at in Canadian buildings, evidence that the Canadian fabricator or packager/labeller or tester holds a valid Canadian establishment licence is considered adequate.\n\nIf you are an importer of drugs fabricated, packaged/labelled or tested at a foreign building, you must meet the requirements described in How to demonstrate foreign building compliance with drug good manufacturing practices (GUI-0080).\n\nYou must provide the contract acceptor with all information needed to carry out contracted operations correctly, according to the marketing authorization and any other legal requirements. Ensure the contract acceptor is fully aware of any problems associated with the product, work or tests that might pose a hazard to premises, equipment, personnel, other materials or other products.\n\nYou are responsible for monitoring, reviewing and assessing records and results related to outsourced activities. You should ensure that all products, services and materials provided by the contract acceptor comply with GMP, the marketing authorization and the quality agreement.\n\nThe contract acceptor\n\nIf you are the contract acceptor, you must be able to properly carry out the work ordered by the contract giver (including having adequate premises, equipment, knowledge, experience and competent personnel).\n\nEnsure that all products, materials and knowledge delivered to you are suitable for their intended purpose.\n\nDo not subcontract to a third party any of the work entrusted to you under contract without the contract giver's prior evaluation and written approval. Arrangements made between you and any third party should ensure that information and knowledge—including from assessments of the suitability of the third party—are made available to the original contract giver.\n\nDo not make unauthorized changes (outside the terms of the contract) that may adversely affect the quality of the outsourced activities for the contract giver.\n\nAgreement\n\nEnsure there is a written agreement covering the fabrication, packaging/labelling or testing arranged among the parties involved. The agreement must specify the responsibilities of each party relating to the outsourced activities and control of the product.\n\nTechnical aspects of the agreement must be drawn up by qualified personnel who are knowledgeable in pharmaceutical technology and GMP.\n\nThe agreement should include the following:\n\na description of who is responsible for:\n\nwriting and approving raw materials, packaging materials and finished product specifications\n\npurchasing, sampling, testing and releasing raw materials and packaging materials\n\nwriting and approving manufacturing and packaging master formulae\n\nundertaking production, quality and in-process controls\n\nconducting analytical method validation\n\nconducting process validation\n\noverseeing the stability program\n\noverseeing transport and storage logistics and conditions\n\npreparing specific sections of the Annual Product Quality Report (APQR)\n\na clause saying there should be no subcontracting of any work without written authorization of the contract giver\n\nthe procedure used by the contract giver's quality control department to ensure that each lot or batch being released for sale has been fabricated, packaged/labelled and tested in compliance with GMP and marketing authorization requirements\n\na requirement for the contract acceptor to investigate and notify the contract giver of any deviations and out-of-specification results that may have an impact on the quality of the products\n\na description of how to handle rejected raw materials, packaging materials, in-process drugs, bulk drugs and finished products\n\na description of how complaints and information about potentially defective products received by the contract giver are (when applicable) handled and investigated by the contract acceptor (with results sent to the contract giver for review)\n\na requirement for changes to be governed by a change control system and approved by the contract giver and contract acceptor\n\na requirement for the contract acceptor to make all records related to the outsourced activities (e.g. fabrication, packaging/labelling and testing) available on request to the contract giver in a timely way\n\npermission for the contract giver to audit the facilities of the contract acceptor\n\na requirement to notify the contract giver of any significant changes in the regulatory status of the contract acceptor or their API vendors (this includes being notified of any recalls or other regulatory actions, such as statements of non-compliance, warning letters or import alerts/bans originating at any foreign buildings where drug product or API activities are conducted)\n\nfor drug product importers, a clause requiring:\n\nforeign drug product fabricators to use APIs manufactured at GMP-compliant buildings (this should also enable foreign drug product fabricators to conduct GMP corporate audits on other buildings used or to request the relevant GMP compliance evidence)\n\nany API fabricator to provide ongoing stability data to importers on request via the foreign drug product fabricator\n\nthe importer to be notified of changes to the API manufacturing process or supplier or specifications\n\na requirement for drug fabricators to provide a copy of any API fabricator's Annual Product Quality Report (APQR) upon request\n\na requirement for drug fabricators to ensure that API supplier buildings are compliant with Canadian GMP or ICH Q7 guidelines\n\nQuality control department\n\nC.02.013\n\nRationale\n\nThe Regulations and this guideline use the term “quality control” to refer to any quality unit that satisfies this role. A quality unit independent of production fulfills both quality assurance and quality control responsibilities. It can be made up of separate units, a single individual or a group, depending upon the size and structure of the organization. Quality control is the part of GMP concerned with sampling, specifications and testing. It also includes organization, documentation and release procedures.\n\nThis regulation provides for a quality control department that helps facilitate assurances that the proper production steps and product tests are carried out. It also facilitates assurances that raw materials and packaging materials are not released for use—and products are not released for sale—until their quality has been judged to be satisfactory.\n\nQuality control is not confined to lab operations. It must be incorporated into all activities and decisions concerning the quality of the product.\n\nManufacturing and quality control personnel share the same goal of ensuring that high-quality drugs are fabricated. But their interests may sometimes conflict in the short run as decisions are made that will affect a company's output. For this reason, you can best achieve an objective and accountable quality control process by creating an independent quality control department. The independence of the quality control department from manufacturing is considered fundamental.\n\nThe rationale for the requirement that the quality control department be supervised by qualified personnel is outlined under section C.02.006 “Personnel”.\n\nInterpretation\n\nIf you are a fabricator, packager/labeller, distributor, importer or wholesaler, you must have a person on site—or fully accessible to on-site quality control personnel—who is responsible for making quality control decisions. This person must have enough knowledge of on-site operations to fulfill the responsibilities of the position.\n\nYour quality control department must have sufficient workspace, trained personnel, materials and equipment to fulfill its duties and responsibilities. Your senior management should determine and provide adequate and appropriate resources to implement and maintain the pharmaceutical quality system and continually improve its effectiveness.\n\nEnsure approved written procedures are available for sampling, inspecting and testing raw materials, packaging materials, in-process drugs, bulk drugs and finished products.\n\nEnsure quality control personnel have access to production areas to fulfill responsibilities.\n\nC.02.014\n\nRationale\n\nYour quality control department is responsible for approving all raw materials, packaging materials and finished products. It is very important for this department to exercise adequate controls to ensure the quality of the end product.\n\nTo maintain this level of quality, it is also important to examine all returned drugs, and to give special attention to reprocessed drugs.\n\nInterpretation\n\nThe person in charge of your quality control department (or a designated alternate meeting the requirements described under section C.02.006 “Personnel”) must sign and date all decisions made by the quality control department, according to section C.02.014 “Quality Control Department”.\n\nYour quality control department’s assessment for the release of finished products must consider all relevant factors, including: production conditions, results of in-process testing, fabrication and packaging documentation, compliance with the finished product specifications, an examination of the finished package, and (if applicable) a review of the storage and transportation conditions.\n\nEvaluate deviations and borderline conformances according to a written procedure. Document the decision and rationale. Where appropriate, conduct trend analysis on batch deviations.\n\nAssess any non-conformances, malfunctions, alarms or errors (including those related to premises, equipment, sanitation and testing) that may have an impact on the quality and safety of batches pending release or released. Document the rationale.\n\nYour quality control department should ensure compliance to the current master production documents and marketing authorization (this does not apply to wholesalers).\n\nReview electronic records (where used) and relevant audit trails when reviewing records that support finished product release.\n\nYour quality control department must ensure that raw materials and packaging materials are quarantined, sampled, tested and released before being used to fabricate or package/label a drug.\n\nYou must destroy finished products returned from the market, unless it has been determined that their quality is satisfactory. Returned goods may be considered for resale only after they have been assessed by your quality control department, according to a written procedure. The assessment must take into consideration:\n\nthe reason for the return\n\nthe nature of the product\n\nthe storage and transportation conditions\n\nthe product's condition and history\n\nthe time elapsed since it was originally sold\n\nMaintain records of any action taken. You must have documentation available to support the decision to place returned goods into inventory for further resale. Wholesalers should get guidance from importers/distributors to make an informed decision about restocking the product.\n\nWhen you assess returned goods, you must consider the potential for counterfeit or tampering before considering for resale.\n\nIdentify rejected materials and products as such and quarantin"
