        "text": "KANSAS CITY, Mo. (KCTV/Gray News) - A construction worker in Missouri was listed in critical condition Monday morning after he was found unresponsive in a sewer pipe.\n\nEmergency medical services responded to Old Santa Fe Road just before 8 a.m. and found the man in a 15-foot manhole.\n\nKansas City Fire Department said they encountered dangerously low levels of oxygen while rescuing the 30-year-old from a sewer pipe. They were at 11%, a level that could be deadly.\n\n“Standard atmospheric oxygen levels are 21% and anything less than 19.5% is considered dangerous,” said KCFD Battalion Chief Michael Hopkins. “Usually for oxygen levels to get low something has to displace it, whether its methane, natural gas.”\n\nHopkins said their meters did not pick up any toxic fumes, leaving them wondering what caused the oxygen levels to drop so low.\n\n“It’s kind of an unusual situation that I’m sure that they’re all trying to work through to figure out what caused this,” Hopkins said.\n\nThe 30-year-old male construction worker was found unconscious and face down in about 6 to 8 inches of water. The victim was quickly evaluated and found to have no pulse, the Kansas City Fire Department told KCTV.\n\nFirst responders rescued the worker from the sewer with a rope and initiated CPR on him before he was taken to the hospital.\n\nThe worker is an employee of Global Earthwork + Underground, a company that has done a few other projects around Kansas City.\n\nHe had been installing new sewer systems at the time.\n\nThe company responded with a statement: “The safety and well-being of our employees, subcontractors, visitors, and the public is our top priority. We are currently working to gather all the facts and assess the situation thoroughly and are fully cooperating with (the Occupational Safety and Health Administration) and local authorities.”\n\nOSHA’s area director Karena Lorek said they found no prior violations involving the firm.\n\n“Under a quick history search we have not had any enforcement action with either one of these companies,” she said.\n\nLorek said they will be conducting a thorough investigation, as well as looking at the company’s confined space plans and protocols.\n\n“Testing for that oxygen level and or explosive gases prior to entry and throughout when you have an employee in a confined space is imperative to keep them safe,” she said.\n\nThe injury is being investigated by OSHA and the fire department. OSHA said the investigation can take up to six months to determine if there was a violation."
