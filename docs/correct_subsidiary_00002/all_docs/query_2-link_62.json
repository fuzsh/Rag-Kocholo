Welcome To The Family chronicles how cultures collide when white parents (O’Malley, McCormack) and Latino parents (Chavira, Machado) are bonded together by their children Molly (Ella Rae Peck) and Junior (Haro) who fall in love followed quickly by an unplanned pregnancy. Machado’s Lisette works at the DMV and is committed to co-parenting her son (Haro) with her ex-husband Miguel (Chavira). For Machado, repped by APA and D2 Management, Welcome To The Family is in first position to her USA pilot Paging Dr. Freed, an arrangement mirroring that for Paging Dr. Freed‘s Annie Potts who plays a lead in ABC’s dramedy pilot Murder In Manhattan. Haro is with Greene & Assoc.\n\nNatalie Hall (Pretty Little Liars) has landed a co-starring role on the CW pilot Oxygen, written by Meredith Averill and directed by Gary Fleder. It centers on Emery (Aimee Teegarden), a teen girl who falls in love with Roman (Matt Lanter), an alien boy, one of nine of his kind (The Orions) integrated into a suburban high school. Hall, repped by Paradigm and The Group, plays human girl Taylor, the undisputed queen of her high school who takes an interest in newcomer Emery but Emery’s friendliness towards the hated Orions may put a damper on their new friendship."
