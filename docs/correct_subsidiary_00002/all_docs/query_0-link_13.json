        "text": "Oxygen (branded on air as Oxygen True Crime) is an American television network owned by the NBCUniversal Television and Streaming division and business segment of NBCUniversal, a subsidiary of Comcast. The channel primarily airs true crime programming and dramas targeted towards women.\n\nThe network was founded by Geraldine Laybourne and Oprah Winfrey, and carried a format focused on lifestyle and entertainment programming oriented towards women, similar to competing channels such as Lifetime. NBCUniversal acquired the network in 2007; under NBCU ownership, the network increasingly produced reality shows aimed at the demographic, and was relaunched in 2014 to target a \"modern\", younger female audience. After the network experienced ratings successes with a programming block dedicated to such programming, Oxygen was relaunched in mid-2017 to focus primarily on true-crime programs. The channel initially operated as a cable network; in 2022, Oxygen began to also operate as a digital multicast television network on subchannels of NBC Owned Television Stations.\n\nAs of February 2015, approximately 77.5 million American households (66.5% of households with television) receive Oxygen. Under its current format, the network primarily competes with Investigation Discovery and HLN.\n\nTelevision networks in the United States NBCUniversal\n\nBravo\n\nCNBC\n\nE!\n\nGolf Channel\n\nMSNBC\n\nNBC\n\nNBCSN\n\nOxygen\n\nSyfy\n\nUSA Network\n\nParamount\n\nBET\n\nCBS\n\nCMT\n\nComedy Central\n\nMTV\n\nNickelodeon\n\nParamount Network\n\nPop\n\nTV Land\n\nVH1\n\nWalt Disney/Fox\n\nA&E\n\nABC\n\nDisney Channel\n\nESPN\n\nESPN2\n\nFox\n\nNews\n\nFS1\n\nFreeform\n\nFX\n\nHistory\n\nLifetime\n\nMyNetworkTV\n\nWarner Bros.
