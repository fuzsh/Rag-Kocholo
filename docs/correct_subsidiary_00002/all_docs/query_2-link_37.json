Traditionally, it occurs once a year in July.\n\nHow long does Prime Day last?\n\nAmazon is hosting Prime Day 2024 from 3 a.m. ET on Tuesday, July 16, through 3 a.m. ET on Wednesday, July 18.\n\nWhen does Prime Day end?\n\nPrime Day ends July 17 at 11:59 p.m. Pacific time, so east coasters have until about 3 a.m. on July 18, their time to shop the deals. That said, there are some extended deals worth shopping, going on now.\n\nWhen is the next Prime Day?\n\nAlready wondering when the next Amazon Prime Day is in 2024? Prime Day takes place in July each year. While Amazon hasn’t confirmed the dates for Prime Day 2025, it’s safe to assume it will take place in mid-July — similar to previous years. However,\n\nSince 2022, a similar sales event has been taking place in October under different monikers, which has acted as a precursor to their Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales.\n\nIn 2022, it was called the Early Access Sale, and in 2023, the Prime Big Deal Days.\n\nDo you have to have Amazon Prime for Prime Day?\n\nWhile Prime members can take full advantage of Amazon Prime Day (plus all the benefits of the subscription), interested shoppers can grab a 30-day free trial to enjoy Prime Day with no strings attached.\n\nWhat are the best Prime Day deals?\n\nFrom reporting on Amazon Prime Day throughout the years, we can tell you for certain that it’s the ideal period to pick up a new mattress, restock some new or upgraded kitchen items and comb through the massive catalog of Amazon best-sellers.\n\nDon’t miss Post Wanted’s around-the-clock coverage.
