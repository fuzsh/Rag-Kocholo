        "text": "NBC and YouTube TV are up in arms over their contract which is set to expire this September and, soon, it may see quite a few channels leave the popular service. Here’s a list of exactly which NBC channels will be removed from YouTube TV if the battle rages on.\n\nThe contract between NBC Universal and Google will expire on Thursday, September 30. At that point, all channels on YouTube TV that are produced by NBC Universal will be removed from streaming, though Google hasn’t directly confirmed if this will also affect recordings from those same networks.\n\nWhile there’s plenty of talk about “14+ channels” being removed, you might still be wondering what the exact list of channels being removed will include. Below, you’ll find a full list of the NBC channels that are being removed from YouTube TV.\n\nImportantly, if these channels are removed, Google has confirmed that it will lower the price of YouTube TV by $10/month. The dispute between Google and NBC supposedly stemmed from NBC pushing Google to bundle Peacock with YouTube TV.\n\nFirst and foremost, your local NBC news network will be removed from YouTube TV. This network will vary on a regional basis or even from city to city.\n\nLocal NBC Station\n\nTelemundo\n\nBravo\n\nOxygen\n\nCNBC\n\nThe Olympic Channel\n\nCNBC World\n\nNBC News Now\n\nE!\n\nSyfy\n\nThe Golf Channel\n\nUniversal Kids\n\nMSNBC\n\nUniverso\n\nUSA\n\nCozi\n\nNBCLX\n\nNECN\n\nNBC 4K content (Available in the 4K Plus Add On)\n\nBeyond the core NBC channels, the list of channels being removed from YouTube TV when the contract expires also includes quite a lot of regional sports channels. There are 14 regional NBC Sports networks in major cities and regions such as Chicago, Boston, NYC, and other regions.\n\nNBC Sports Net\n\nNBC Sports Bay Area\n\nNBC Sports Bay Area Plus\n\nNBC Sports Boston\n\nNBC Sports California\n\nNBC Sports California Plus\n\nNBC Sports Chicago\n\nNBC Sports Chicago Plus\n\nNBC Sports Chicago Plus 2\n\nNBC Sports Northwest\n\nNBC Sports Philadelphia\n\nNBC Sports Philadelphia Plus\n\nNBC Sports Washington\n\nNBC Sports Washington Plus\n\nSNYHD\n\nMore on YouTube TV:"
