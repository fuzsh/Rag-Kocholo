        "text": "Comcast Corporation. Headquarters: Philadelphia, Pennsylvania\n\nYear Founded: 1963\n\n2022 Annual Revenue: $121.4 billion\n\nComcast Corporation owns one of the most influential mass media and entertainment organizations in the world, NBCUniversal. This acquisition gave Comcast control of numerous brands that have taken them to conglomerate status. Some of these include:\n\nUniversal Pictures\n\nDreamworks Animation\n\nUniversal Parks and Resorts\n\nMSNBC\n\nOxygen\n\nE!\n\nUSA Network\n\nThese takeovers have made Comcast Corporation the second-largest broadcasting and television conglomerate in the world solely on the basis of revenue. They are also the largest cable television and internet service provider in America, serving areas in 40 States.\n\nFind Comcast Jobs Near Me\n\nAT&T. Headquarters: Dallas, Texas\n\nYear Founded: 1983\n\n2022 Annual Revenue: $120.741 billion\n\nWhile ATT is mostly known to the public for being the world’s largest telecommunications company and cell phone provider, they’re also considered the biggest media conglomerate by revenue after the acquisition of Warner Media in 2018.\n\nSince WarnerMedia is a major mass media company, it pushed its new owner into this role.\n\nIn the merger, ATT gained control of 98 recognizable companies that were previously functioning under Warner Media. Some of these include:\n\nHBO and Cinemax\n\nTurner Entertainment Networks\n\nAdult Swim and Cartoon Network\n\nCNN News Group\n\nDC Entertainment and Films\n\nWarner Bros Pictures\n\nThe bandwidth of viewership that ATT receives through these companies working under their domain, coupled with their immense yearly revenue makes them the largest media company to date.\n\nFind AT&T Jobs Near Me\n\nMeta – Facebook. Headquarters: Menlo Park, California\n\nYear Founded: 2004\n\n2022 Annual Revenue: $116.6 billion\n\nFacebook is the #1 social networking website in the world, but it also acts as a media conglomerate. Facebook’s CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, insists the website is a technology company, as opposed to media.\n\nRegardless, it’s taken on the form of mass media by providing people with news and loads of information on a grand scale.\n\nFacebook is hesitant to label itself as a media source because it inherently makes them responsible for the information that’s reported on their website. With 2.8 billion users worldwide, that’s a lot of people to be responsible for informing.\n\nFacebook is currently the third most popular website in the world, right behind Google and Youtube. The company also generates massive revenue annually, which is why it’s considered one of the largest media companies globally.\n\nFind Facebook Jobs Near Me\n\nThe Walt Disney Company. Headquarters: Burbank, California\n\nYear Founded: 1923\n\n2022 Annual Revenue: $82.7 billion\n\nMedia conglomerates don’t necessarily have to be news channels. They can be the largest producer of American animated film and television production, like The Walt Disney Company.\n\nFounded almost a hundred years ago, The Walt Disney Company is a mass media company that generally creates family-friendly content. Disney operates under a few film production company titles. These include:\n\nWalt Disney Pictures\n\nWalt Disney Animation Studios\n\nPixar\n\nMarvel Studios\n\n20th Century Studios\n\nSearchlight Pictures\n\nBlue Sky Studios\n\nDisney also owns several cable television networks, such as:\n\nDisney Channel\n\nFreeform\n\nESPN\n\nFX\n\nNational Geographic\n\nIn addition to television and movie production, The Walt Disney Company also earns a lot of its revenue from theme parks and consumer products.\n\nThrough these business avenues, The Walt Disney Company employs 223,000 people, as of 2019. More than a quarter of them work at Walt Disney World Resort, making them the largest single-location employer in the United States.\n\nFind The Walt Disney Company Jobs Near Me\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery, Inc. . Headquarters: New York, New York\n\nYear Founded: 1990\n\n2022 Annual Revenue: $33.8 billion\n\nPreviously known as Time Warner, WarnerMedia was acquired by ATT in 2018 for the sum of $85 billion and the assumption of the acquisition’s debt. This effectively pushed ATT into being the largest media conglomerate in the United States by revenue.\n\nWarnerMedia has ties to film, television, and cable companies. Some of their assets in this department include:\n\nTurner Broadcasting\n\nHBO\n\nWarner Bros.\n\nNew Line Cinema\n\nWarner Media was ranked 98th on the Fortune 500 list in 2018.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery, Inc. Jobs Near Me\n\nNetflix. Headquarters: Los Gatos, California\n\nYear Founded: 1997\n\n2022 Annual Revenue: $31.616 billion\n\nNetflix is one of the most impressive media companies to arise out of the 21st century. The business functions as a content streaming platform, and in recent years has transitioned into a production company as well.\n\nIn 2021, Netflix has officially reached the mark of 203.7 million subscribers worldwide, and nearly 66 million of them are Americans.\n\nNetflix currently has headquarters all over the world, from England to Los Angeles. The company is well connected internationally, operating in more than 190 countries.\n\nToday, Netflix is officially the biggest media company in terms of market capitalization, or market value.\n\nFind Netflix Jobs Near Me\n\nParamount Global-CBS. Headquarters: Manhattan, New York\n\nYear Founded: 2019\n\n2022 Annual Revenue: $30.15 billion\n\nThe establishment of ViacomCBS, similarly to many other media companies, emerged from a merger between CBS Corporation and Viacom in 2019. Hence their short history of little more than a year accounting for a seemingly enormous corporation.\n\nViacomCBS functions through a series of assets, much like the other conglomerates in the industry. The main holdings associated with ViacomCBS include:\n\nParamount Pictures Film\n\nCBS Entertainment Group\n\nMTV, Nickelodeon, BET, Comedy Central, and Showtime\n\nSimon Schuster Publishing\n\nIn total, the ViacomCBS conglomerate operates 170 networks with an estimated 700 million users across them.\n\nFind Paramount – CBS Jobs Near Me\n\nFox News. Headquarters: New York, New York\n\nYear Founded: 2019\n\n2022 Annual Revenue: $13.831 billion\n\nThe founding of Fox Corporation seems fairly recent, but that’s the result of a breakdown of its original company titled “21st Century Fox.”\n\nWhen 21st Century Fox was dismantled, the majority of its stock was acquired by The Walt Disney Company. Some assets remained after the deal, and these went on to create the Fox Corporation.\n\nMainly, the Fox Corporation works in the news and sports sector of the television broadcast. Their operating assets include:\n\nFox Broadcasting Company\n\nFox Television Stations\n\nFox News Media\n\nFox Sports Media Group\n\nTuning Streaming Service\n\nDespite being the product of the pieces that were left behind, Fox Corporation continues to be one of the largest media conglomerates in the United States, and their growth is projected to rise.\n\nFind Fox News Jobs Near Me\n\nHearst. Headquarters: New York, New York\n\nYear Founded: 1887\n\n2022 Annual Revenue: $11.5 billion\n\nWhile they have a hand in television like many other media companies, Hearst Corporation mainly owns newspapers and magazines.\n\nWhile the written forms of media have taken a major backseat to more visual mediums in the 21st century, they’re still a viable resource that millions of people use to gather information.\n\nHearst Corporation currently owns 360 companies in various fields. Some of the most popular media companies under their control include:\n\nCosmopolitan\n\nELLE\n\nEsquire\n\nGood Housekeeping\n\nO, The Oprah Magazine\n\nSan Francisco Chronicle\n\nThe News-Times\n\nMidland Daily News\n\nThat’s just to name a few businesses that the Hearst Corporation owns outright. The company also owns all A+E Networks in a 50/50 split with The Walt Disney Company.\n\nFind Hearst Jobs Near Me\n\nNews. Headquarters: New York, New York\n\nYear Founded: 2013\n\n2019 Annual Revenue: $10.39 billion\n\nThe News Corp that exists today was an offspring of a conglomerate that had been around since 1980 under the full title of “News Corporation.”\n\nThe rejuvenated version of News Corp is a media company owned by Rupert Murdoch, which does its business in news production, television, and book publishing.\n\nA sister company to another spin-off company, Fox Corporation, News Corp holds an eclectic group of assets. Some of the most profitable companies under their control include:\n\nNews UK\n\nDow Jones Company\n\nNews Corp Australia\n\nHarperCollins Publishing\n\nNews Corp is also a player in the digital real estate market as the owner of REA Group and Realtor.com."
