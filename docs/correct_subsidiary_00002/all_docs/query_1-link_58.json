        "text": "I can't believe how unhelpful Xfinity is being regarding this issue, especially since all other networks I watch haven't done this to their customers.\n\nSome of us don't do streaming, don't do HD, don't want to watch on a smaller device and don't have a TV capable of streaming, even with an added device cause our tv's don't have an HDMI port. We pay for cable and cable boxes and with that comes OnDemand, but now were being told too bad.\n\nWhy is it that Xfinity can't, as a business, contact NBC, another business, and find out why they are alienating some customers, because they don't have the latest and greatest, and aren't capable of viewing in HD or do streaming. That's the whole point of having cable, a cable box and, at least for me, paying well over $150/mo.\n\nOh, and by the way, the Xfinity Stream app doesn't appear to keep track of which episode of a show was last viewed, whereas OnDemand does.\n\nInteresting bit of info someone added to my post regarding this same issue ( https://forums.xfinity.com/conversations/channels-and-programming/nbc-shows-only-available-in-hd-format/65ba100956dae762b687fe06 ).\n\nComcast owns NBC, so it's TOTALLY in their control about how things are put out on demand. Seems as though they are trying to force people to go the route of the added cost of HD.\n\nI'm willing to pay for what I was getting, but if Comcast chooses to stick with this scam, then not only are they (Comcast and NBC) likely to lose out, but so would the shows themselves. There are ways to view most network shows and movies without having to pay or deal with commercials.\n\n@CactusThorn​ it's most likely going to apply to all networks under the NBC umbrella, which along with SyFy will probably also include Bravo, E!, Oxygen, USA and any other NBC branded offshoots. And Comcast owns NBC.\n\nAnother thing I have since found out, is that unless you have Xfinity internet, you can't use their Stream app on a smart TV, unless it's supposedly an Amazon TV. Even an Amazon fire stick won't cut it, even though you can install it and the error it gives says you need a video subscription."
