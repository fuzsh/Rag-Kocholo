        "text": "Jaipur, 24 October 2021: National Engineering Industries Ltd. (NEI), part of USD $2.4 billion diversified CK Birla Group today announced its support in setting up a state-of-the-art 4th generation PSA oxygen generation plant for Sawai Man Singh (SMS) Hospital in Jaipur. Shri Ashok Gehlot, Chief Minister of Rajasthan inaugurated the plant virtually on 24th October 2021.\n\nConsidering the uncertainty brought by the recent pandemic, the goal of this initiative is to ensure that there is self-sufficiency during such critical times in near future. The plant will produce oxygen at 750 litres per minute to fill 160-170 oxygen cylinders per day and will be able to support with uninterrupted oxygen supply to hospital patients.\n\nAccording to Rohit Saboo, President and CEO of NEI, “We want to ensure that we are able to help the state government in saving lives during such critical situations. An initiative like this, will be one of the solutions to survive through the future waves. Being present in the region for more than 75 years, it is our responsibility to support the state and its people in dire situations. Earlier this year, NEI had donated 100 oxygen concentrators to Rajasthan Government that were imported to support the state’s efforts against the COVID-19 battle. Committed towards this fight against the pandemic, NEI has institutionalised an approach to enable a safe environment for its employees as well as communities.”\n\nCommitted towards the fight against COVID-19, NEI has also recently supported hospitals in Rajasthan with oxygen cylinders and oxygen concentrators. The company had also donated 50 beds to the community health centre at Savli in Vadodara Gujarat. NEI also stood strong beside their employees by introducing several initiatives like flexible working, reduction in overall working hours, dedicated 24 hours helpline, medical insurance, paid leaves etc. The company had also organised a vaccination camp at its Jaipur facility for its 2000+ employees and their immediate family members."
