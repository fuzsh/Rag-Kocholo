To find out for sure, and to determine what channel number has been assigned to Oxygen in your area, check the channel listings provided by your local TV provider, or call your provider for the channel number.\n\nIn select markets, Oxygen is also available via a TV antenna.\n\nTo find out more and to check how to receive Oxygen where you live, check out our Channel Finder.\n\nHow can I get air dates and times for Oxygen shows?\n\nYou'll find complete show listings for today and every day for the next week in Oxygen.com's Show Schedule.\n\nWhy don't my TV listings match Oxygen's schedule?\n\nOxygen offers two feeds, Eastern and Pacific — which enables programs to start at the same time for viewers on both coasts. However, most satellite services and some cable systems offer the Eastern feed regardless of the time zone where subscribers live. In that case, viewers need to subtract hours (3 for Pacific, 2 for Mountain) from the time listed.\n\nWhich Oxygen shows are broadcast in High Definition?\n\nAll of Oxygen’s original programming is broadcast in High Definition. Occasionally acquired series may be broadcast in Standard Definition.\n\nHow do I submit story or show ideas to Oxygen?\n\nBecause of a number of factors, including volume of mail, employee safety, and legal issues, Oxygen cannot accept unsolicited creative ideas or materials.\n\nHow do I advertise with Oxygen?\n\nGet contact information on the advertising information page\n\nHow do I get press information about Oxygen shows?\n\nPress releases, photography, and public relations contacts for each Oxygen show are available to journalists on Oxygen's press site.\n\nWhere can I get general information about Oxygen?\n\nTo find out about the shows on the network, and some history, see our About Oxygen page.\n\nIs Closed Captioning Available on Oxygen?\n\nOxygen is pleased to offer closed captioning across a wide variety of its programming that it makes available on television and online.\n\nTo report an issue or concern regarding closed captioning on Oxygen programs, please click here.\n\nFull Episodes FAQ\n\nTo watch full episodes, download the Oxygen true crime app here: https://www.oxygen.com/oxygen-true-crime-app\n\nFor support and to answer any questions around our app, check-out our dedicated help center here.\n\nHow do I find what shows have full episodes available to watch?\n\nIf you want to watch full episodes on Oxygen.com via your desktop computer, just visit the Full Episodes section of the site accessible via the navigation menu at the top of the site. A list of all shows with full episodes to watch can be found there.\n\nIf you want to watch full episodes via the Oxygen True Crime app, once you are signed into the app you can select the “Shows” option in the main menu. Find the show you are looking for, select it and see what full episodes are available!\n\nWhat do the ratings codes (e.g., TV-14-DL) on the Schedule mean?\n\nThey indicate the age-appropriateness and type of content presented in a program. There are two parts after \"TV-\": An age-based rating, followed by a content descriptor. A summary of the codes we use is provided below for your convenience. For complete information, visit the TV Parental Guidelines at http://www.tvguidelines.org.\n\nContent codes: Suggestive dialogue (D), coarse or crude language (L), sexual situations (S) and violence (V).\n\nAudience age codes: All children (Y), children 7+ (Y7), children 7+ with fantasy violence (Y7-FV), all ages (G), parental guidance suggested (PG), unsuitable for children under 14 (14) and unsuitable for children under 17 (MA).\n\nWhy do I not see full episodes of a particular show that I am looking for?"
