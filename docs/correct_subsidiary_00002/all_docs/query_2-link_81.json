        "text": "The Rideout murder case captivated the Rochester community, and on Friday night, the story of that brutal killing was told to a national audience.\n\nThe hour-long segment called \"Devil's Bathtub\" by NBC's Dateline recalled much of the investigation into the death of Craig Rideout, whose body was found near a rural roadside in Yates County on July 21, 2016.\n\nHis estranged wife Laura Rideout and their oldest son, Colin Rideout, were convicted of second-degree murder this July, and another son, Alex Rideout, was convicted of two counts of tampering with evidence for his role in the botched effort to cover up the crime. Laura's boyfriend Paul Tucci was found not guilty of murder and tampering charges.\n\nCorrespondent Andrea Canning spoke to prosecutors, defense attorneys, investigators, and family members, exploring how marital discord set the Rideout family on a path towards murder.\n\nWhat dateline didn't say\n\nThere were a number of important details about the case that the Dateline episode did not touch upon.\n\nThe custody dispute over Craig and Laura's two youngest children was presented as the likely motive, because it was interfering with Laura Rideout and Tucci's plans to move to North Carolina. But the show did not reveal just how contentious the dispute had been, and the lengths to which Laura went to get her son Colin involved.\n\nText messages between Colin and Laura in January 2016 discussed a plan to get Elizabeth and Julia, the two oldest Rideout daughters, to stage an incident that could serve as grounds to get that custody order changed.\n\nThey hoped to provoke Craig Rideout to lose his temper so that they could call the police and accuse him of violence.\n\nColin sent text messages to his sisters with detailed instructions. \"Tell them you're afraid your dad is going to kill your younger siblings when he gets home,\" he wrote.\n\nAnd later, he texted: \"Don't hesitate to call 911... if ... he's ever screaming because that would play well in court.\"\n\nThe plan went awry when Craig Rideout did not react angrily.\n\nThis tension built through the succeeding months, culminating with a series of angry emails from Colin to his father. In them, the eldest Rideout son blamed his father for the unrest. Craig Rideout attempted to strike a conciliatory tone.\n\n“I enjoy talking with you and am generally proud of you as my son,\" Craig Rideout wrote. \"I would like to think that you and I can have a relationship without all the b***s*** and drama associated with your mother.”\n\nBut Colin was on the offensive and not willing to back down, imploring his father to relinquish custody of his younger siblings so they could move with their mother to North Carolina.\n\n“This is ridiculous. I am tired of your duplicity, your constant lying, and your disgusting attempts to keep my mother and siblings under your thumb,\" Colin wrote. \"While you maybe quote 'generally proud' of me as your son, I am not at all proud of you as my father. The things you do, especially your actions during this divorce are despicable.”\n\nFour days after Colin sent that email, his father was dead.\n\nPhysical evidence\n\nDateline mentioned blood spatter found in Craig Rideout's basement, and bloody clothes recovered from the trunk of a car Colin and Alex Rideout drove to Mendon Ponds Park.\n\nThose clothes and the amount of blood on each of them were key as jurors weighed which of the defendants were guilty of committing the murder.\n\nA pair of jeans belonging to Colin Rideout were soaked with blood, which prosecutors argued proved he was a principle actor in the attack of Craig Rideout. Laura Rideout's jeans also had a significant amount of blood.\n\nBut a pair of sweatpants belonging to Alex Rideout had a much smaller quantity of blood, and jurors repeatedly asked to look at those sweatpants as they deliberated. The lesser amount of blood raised reasonable doubt in juror's minds about whether Alex had been present for the murder or whether that blood got on his clothing during the botched effort to cover it up.\n\nDateline did not show viewers a map of cell tower pings captured from the phone in Craig Rideout's pants pocket after he was murdered. It was a key piece of evidence for prosecutors to establish a timeline for the killing.\n\nThose pings show Craig Rideout and his phone leaving his Penfield townhouse about 3:15 am on July 20, 2016, and tracing a path fifty miles southward to the Yates County roadside where his body was found just before dawn.\n\nViewers also didn't see surveillance videos from six different business that showed a pair of vehicles travelling the same route. Prosecutors say those vehicles were Craig Rideout's minivan and a car belonging to Paul Tucci and Laura Rideout, and showed them on their way to and from the scene where the body was dumped.\n\nNew details in Dateline episode\n\nDateline producers presented some evidence that had not been released publicly, including Robbyn Drew's 911 call to police to report that her brother was missing.\n\nViewers got to hear Craig Rideout's voice, when he called police days before he was murdered to report a break-in at his house. He was almost apologetic, saying he was only calling because his work Blackberry had been stolen.\n\nThe show included audio recordings of conversations with the two youngest Rideout children outside Craig's Penfield townhouse the day of his disappearance. Investigators from the Monroe County Sheriff's Office asked them where their father was, and when they had last seen them.\n\nAnd viewers saw video footage of those investigators speaking to Colin and Alex Rideout the next morning at Mendon Ponds Park. By then, officials had found and located their father's body, but the brothers were still playing it cool.\n\nInvestigator David Bolton asked Colin and Alex if he had any idea what might have happened to his father.\n\n\"I've been kind of worried about him,\" Colin said.\n\n\"I figured he was on the next flight to Mexico,\" Alex added.\n\nBolton then asked Colin Rideout what was going to be found in a pair of garbage bags, one floating in Devil's Bathtub pond and the other in the trunk of a car.\n\n\"I don't know what's in the bag,\" Colin said.\n\nBut Colin soon realized Bolton already knew the answer to that question, and began telling a different story. They both admitted having been in their father's basement the previous day.\n\n\"Well, there was a lot of blood in the basement. I was worried that something had happened,\" Colin said.\n\nTrial participants speak\n\nMost of the key figures in the Rideout trial appeared on the Dateline episode, including lead prosecutor Timothy Prosperi, MCSO investigator David Bolton, Sheriff Patrick O' Flynn, and Craig Rideout's sister Robbyn Drew. All five of the defense attorneys spoke about their strategies for establishing reasonable doubt.\n\nColin Rideout's fiancé, Chelsea Kneuer. appeared on the Dateline episode and made her first public comments on the case. Kneuer and Colin Rideout started dating when they were classmates at Pittsford Mendon high school, and they got engaged after she graduated from Michigan State University. She was a regular presence in the courtroom during the trial, collapsing in tears after Colin's guilty verdicts were read.\n\nShe remained his biggest supporter to the end, but didn't seem to have any answers for why Colin became entangled in the plot to murder his father.\n\n\"He's a smart guy, so no I don't think he would ever put himself in a situation,\" Kneuer said. \"He had a life ahead of him. He had no need.\"\n\nMonroe County District Attorney Sandra Doorley was asked point blank about whether she thought another defendant, Paul Tucci, had gotten away with murder.\n\n\"I believe he did,\" Doorley said.\n\nTucci, who continued to assert his innocence, told Dateline he knew others shared that view.\n\n\"You can't change people's beliefs that way \" Tucci said. \"I'm not here to change your mind. It's a sad story. A murder did occur, but I don't think the whole story is out there and I don't think the jury necessarily got it right. \"\n\nSLAHMAN@Gannett.com"
