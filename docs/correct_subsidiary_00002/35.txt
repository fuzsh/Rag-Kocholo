Background

On October 9, 2007, NBCUniversal announced it would purchase Oxygen Media (owner of the Oh! Oxygen network) for $925 million; the sale was completed on November 20, and the network rebranded to simply Oxygen.

In April 2014, as part of a gradual re-focusing of NBCU's women's pay-TV networks by new division head Bonnie Hammer and the appointment of Frances Berwick as the head of Oxygen and sister network Bravo, Oxygen underwent a shift in its programming strategy to focus on a "modern", young female audience.

In February 2017, NBCUniversal confirmed plans to re-format the network with a focus on true crime programming aimed towards women, including a larger re-branding; the change took effect in May that year.

1st Logo (June 2008-October 2014)

Visuals: A yellow "O"-shaped ring zooms out on an off-white background and stops near the left of the screen, with "oxygen" appearing in the middle of it. Next to it is

riginal

production

"production" is below "inal", and the Oxygen logo serves as the "O" in "riginal". Some "dust" emerges from behind the logo as multiple colorful objects (pink florals, popcorn kernels that pop into popcorn, diamonds, "O"-shaped rings, etc.) fly around and move in various ways. An NBCUniversal byline appears below.

Bylines:

June 2008-January 27, 2011: "A Division of NBC Universal", set in Akzidenz-Grotesk Extended Medium.

January 28, 2011-October 2014: "A Division of NBCUniversal", set in Rock Serif, the corporate font of NBCUniversal.

Variant: Sometimes, no byline appears.

2nd Logo (October 2014-July 2017)

Visuals: A white bar appears on the left side of a blue background, followed by a magenta "o" on top of it and "xygen" next to the "o". "original" and "production" in a smaller size appear next to "oxygen" from magenta bars sliding in from the left. The NBCUniversal byline also appears off-center below.

On Last Squad Standing, the logo is set on a moving red-yellow-purple background.

On Battle of the Ex-Besties, the logo is set on a teal background with a man and woman at the left and the right, respectively.

On Homicide for the Holidays, the logo is set on a nightly forest.

Technique: 2D computer animation, designed by Eloisa and animated at EyeballNYC.

On Three Days to Live, a mysterious beat is used.

On Homicide for the Holidays, a short haunted theme is used.

3rd Logo (July 2017-)

Visuals: On a slowly rotating forest backdrop viewed from below, the current Oxygen logo (the network name stacked in two on off-center yellow bars, resembling police tape) scans in, while "ORIGINAL PRODUCTION", along with the NBCUniversal byline and a copyright notice (crediting Oxygen Media Productions), glitches in below.
