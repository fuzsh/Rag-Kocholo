        "text": "A Model Assessment of Satellite Observed Trends in Polar Sea Ice Extents\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nVinnikov, Konstantin Y.; Cavalieri, Donald J.; Parkinson, Claire L.\n\n2005-01-01\n\nFor more than three decades now, satellite passive microwave observations have been used to monitor polar sea ice. Here we utilize sea ice extent trends determined from primarily satellite data for both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres for the period 1972(73)-2004 and compare them with results from simulations by eleven climate models. In the Northern Hemisphere, observations show a statistically significant decrease of sea ice extent and an acceleration of sea ice retreat during the past three decades. However, from the modeled natural variability of sea ice extents in control simulations, we conclude that the acceleration is not statistically significant and should not be extrapolated into the future. Observations and model simulations show that the time scale of climate variability in sea ice extent in the Southern Hemisphere is much larger than in the Northern Hemisphere and that the Southern Hemisphere sea ice extent trends are not statistically significant.\n\nTrend analysis of Arctic sea ice extent\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSilva, M. E.; Barbosa, S. M.; Antunes, LuÃ­s; Rocha, ConceiÃ§Ã£o\n\n2009-04-01\n\nThe extent of Arctic sea ice is a fundamental parameter of Arctic climate variability. In the context of climate change, the area covered by ice in the Arctic is a particularly useful indicator of recent changes in the Arctic environment. Climate models are in near universal agreement that Arctic sea ice extent will decline through the 21st century as a consequence of global warming and many studies predict a ice free Arctic as soon as 2012. Time series of satellite passive microwave observations allow to assess the temporal changes in the extent of Arctic sea ice. Much of the analysis of the ice extent time series, as in most climate studies from observational data, have been focussed on the computation of deterministic linear trends by ordinary least squares. However, many different processes, including deterministic, unit root and long-range dependent processes can engender trend like features in a time series. Several parametric tests have been developed, mainly in econometrics, to discriminate between stationarity (no trend), deterministic trend and stochastic trends. Here, these tests are applied in the trend analysis of the sea ice extent time series available at National Snow and Ice Data Center. The parametric stationary tests, Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF), Phillips-Perron (PP) and the KPSS, do not support an overall deterministic trend in the time series of Arctic sea ice extent. Therefore, alternative parametrizations such as long-range dependence should be considered for characterising long-term Arctic sea ice variability.\n\nChanges in the Areal Extent of Arctic Sea Ice: Observations from Satellites\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nParkinson, Claire L.\n\n2000-01-01\n\nWintertime sea ice covers 15 million square kilometers of the north polar region, an area exceeding one and a half times the area of the U. S. Even at the end of the summer melt season, sea ice still covers 7 million square kilometers. This vast ice cover is an integral component of the climate system, being moved around by winds and waves, restricting heat and other exchanges between the ocean and atmosphere, reflecting most of the solar radiation incident on it, transporting cold, relatively fresh water equatorward, and affecting the overturning of ocean waters underneath, with impacts that can be felt worldwide. Sea ice also is a major factor in the Arctic ecosystem, affecting life forms ranging from minute organisms living within the ice, sometimes to the tune of millions in a single ice floe, to large marine mammals like walruses that rely on sea ice as a platform for resting, foraging, social interaction, and breeding. Since 1978, satellite technology has allowed the monitoring of the vast Arctic sea ice cover on a routine basis. The satellite observations reveal that, overall, the areal extent of Arctic sea ice has been decreasing since 1978, at an average rate of 2.7% per decade through the end of 1998. Through 1998, the greatest rates of decrease occurred in the Seas of Okhotsk and Japan and the Kara and Barents Seas, with most other regions of the Arctic also experiencing ice extent decreases. The two regions experiencing ice extent increases over this time period were the Bering Sea and the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Furthermore, the satellite data reveal that the sea ice season shortened by over 25 days per decade in the central Sea of Okhotsk and the eastern Barents Sea, and by lesser amounts throughout much of the rest of the Arctic seasonal sea ice region, although not in the Bering Sea or the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Concern has been raised that if the trends toward shortened sea ice seasons and lesser sea ice coverage continue, this could entail major\n\nGlobal Warming and Northern Hemisphere Sea Ice Extent.\n\nPubMed\n\nVinnikov; Robock; Stouffer; Walsh; Parkinson; Cavalieri; Mitchell; Garrett; Zakharov\n\n1999-12-03\n\nSurface and satellite-based observations show a decrease in Northern Hemisphere sea ice extent during the past 46 years. A comparison of these trends to control and transient integrations (forced by observed greenhouse gases and tropospheric sulfate aerosols) from the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory and Hadley Centre climate models reveals that the observed decrease in Northern Hemisphere sea ice extent agrees with the transient simulations, and both trends are much larger than would be expected from natural climate variations. From long-term control runs of climate models, it was found that the probability of the observed trends resulting from natural climate variability, assuming that the models' natural variability is similar to that found in nature, is less than 2 percent for the 1978-98 sea ice trends and less than 0.1 percent for the 1953-98 sea ice trends. Both models used here project continued decreases in sea ice thickness and extent throughout the next century.\n\nLarge-scale variations in observed Antarctic Sea ice extent and associated atmospheric circulation\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nCavalieri, D. J.; Parkinson, C. L.\n\n1981-01-01\n\nThe 1974 Antarctic large scale sea ice extent is studied from data from Nimbus 2 and 5 and temperature and sea level pressure fields from the Australian Meteorological Data Set. Electrically Scanning Microwave Radiometer data were three-day averaged and compared with 1000 mbar atmospheric pressure and sea level pressure data, also in three-day averages. Each three-day period was subjected to a Fourier analysis and included the mean latitude of the ice extent and the phases and percent variances in terms of the first six Fourier harmonics. Centers of low pressure were found to be generally east of regions which displayed rapid ice growth, and winds acted to extend the ice equatorward. An atmospheric response was also noted as caused by the changing ice cover.\n\nReconstruction of past equilibrium line altitude using ice extent data\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nVisnjevic, Vjeran; Herman, Frederic; Podladchikov, Yuri\n\n2017-04-01\n\nWith the end of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), about 20 000 years ago, ended the most recent long-lasting cold phase in Earth's history. This last glacial advance left a strong observable imprint on the landscape, such as abandoned moraines, trimlines and other glacial geomorphic features. These features provide a valuable record of past continental climate. In particular, terminal moraines reflect the extent of glaciers and ice-caps, which itself reflects past temperature and precipitation conditions. Here we present an inverse approach, based on a Tikhonov regularization, we have recently developed to reconstruct the LGM mass balance from observed ice extent data. The ice flow model is developed using the shallow ice approximation and solved explicitly using Graphical Processing Units (GPU). The mass balance field, b, is the constrained variable defined by the ice surface S, balance rate Î² and the spatially variable equilibrium line altitude field (ELA): b = min (Î² á¹¡(S(x,y)- ELA (x,y)),c). (1) where c is a maximum accumulation rate. We show that such a mass balance, and thus the spatially variable ELA field, can be inferred from the observed past ice extent and ice thickness at high resolution and very efficiently. The GPU implementation allows us solve one 1024x1024 grid points forward model run under 0.5s, which significantly reduces the time needed for our inverse method to converge. We start with synthetic test to demonstrate the method. We then apply the method to LGM ice extents of South Island of New Zealand, the Patagonian Andes, where we can see a clear influence of Westerlies on the ELA, and the European Alps. These examples show that the method is capable of constraining spatial variations in mass balance at the scale of a mountain range, and provide us with information on past continental climate.\n\nStudies of the Antarctic Sea Ice Edges and Ice Extents from Satellite and Ship Observations\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nWorby, Anthony P.; Comiso, Josefino C.\n\n2003-01-01\n\nPassive-microwave derived ice edge locations in Antarctica are assessed against other satellite data as well as in situ observations of ice edge location made between 1989 and 2000. The passive microwave data generally agree with satellite and ship data but the ice concentration at the observed ice edge varies greatly with averages of 14% for the TEAM algorithm and 19% for the Bootstrap algorithm. The comparisons of passive microwave with the field data show that in the ice growth season (March - October) the agreement is extremely good, with r(sup 2) values of 0.9967 and 0.9797 for the Bootstrap and TEAM algorithms respectively. In the melt season however (November - February) the passive microwave ice edge is typically 1-2 degrees south of the observations due to the low concentration and saturated nature of the ice. Sensitivity studies show that these results can have significant impact on trend and mass balance studies of the sea ice cover in the Southern Ocean.\n\nMoving beyond the total sea ice extent in gauging model biases\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nIvanova, Detelina P.; Gleckler, Peter J.; Taylor, Karl E.\n\nHere, reproducing characteristics of observed sea ice extent remains an important climate modeling challenge.

G.\n\n2013-12-01\n\nSea ice in the Arctic is changing rapidly. Most noticeable has been the series of record, or near-record, annual minimums in sea ice extent in the past six years. The changing regime of sea ice has prompted much interest in seasonal prediction of sea ice extent, particularly as opportunities for Arctic shipping and resource exploration or extraction increase. This study presents a daily sea ice extent probabilistic forecast method with a 50-day lead time. A base projection is made from historical data and near-real-time sea ice concentration is assimilated on the issue date of the forecast. When considering the September mean ice extent for the period 1995-2012, the performance of the 50-day lead time forecast is very good: correlation=0.94, Bias = 0.14 Ã106 km^2 and RMSE = 0.36 Ã106 km^2. Forecasts for the daily minimum contains equal skill levels. The system is highly competitive with any of the SEARCH Sea Ice Outlook estimates. The primary finding of this study is that large amounts of forecast skill can be gained from knowledge of the initial conditions of concentration (perhaps more than previously thought). Given the simplicity of the forecast model, improved skill should be available from system refinement and with suitable proxies for large scale atmosphere and ocean circulation.\n\nDetermining the ice seasons severity during 1982-2015 using the ice extents sum as a new characteristic\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRjazin, Jevgeni; PÃ¤rn, Ove\n\n2016-04-01\n\nSea ice is a key climate factor and it restricts considerably the winter navigation in sever seasons on the Baltic Sea. So determining ice conditions severity and describing ice cover behaviour at severe seasons interests scientists, engineers and navigation managers. The present study is carried out to determine the ice seasons severity degree basing on the ice seasons 1982 to 2015. A new integrative characteristic is introduced to describe the ice season severity. It is the sum of ice extents of the ice season id est the daily ice extents of the season are summed. The commonly used procedure to determine the ice season severity degree by the maximal ice extent is in this research compared to the new characteristic values. The remote sensing data on the ice concentrations on the Baltic Sea published in the European Copernicus Programme are used to obtain the severity characteristic values. The ice extents are calculated on these ice concentration data. Both the maximal ice extent of the season and a newly introduced characteristic - the ice extents sum are used to classify the winters with respect of severity. The most severe winter of the reviewed period is 1986/87. Also the ice seasons 1981/82, 1984/85, 1985/86, 1995/96 and 2002/03 are classified as severe. Only three seasons of this list are severe by both the criteria. They are 1984/85, 1985/86 and 1986/87. We interpret this coincidence as the evidence of enough-during extensive ice cover in these three seasons. In several winters, for example 2010/11 ice cover extended enough for some time, but did not endure. At few other ice seasons as 2002/03 the Baltic Sea was ice-covered in moderate extent, but the ice cover stayed long time. At 11 winters the ice extents sum differed considerably (> 10%) from the maximal ice extent. These winters yield one third of the studied ice seasons. The maximal ice extent of the season is simple to use and enables to reconstruct the ice cover history and to predict maximal ice\n\nTowards Improving Sea Ice Predictabiity: Evaluating Climate Models Against Satellite Sea Ice Observations\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nStroeve, J. C.\n\n2014-12-01\n\nThe last four decades have seen a remarkable decline in the spatial extent of the Arctic sea ice cover, presenting both challenges and opportunities to Arctic residents, government agencies and industry. After the record low extent in September 2007 effort has increased to improve seasonal, decadal-scale and longer-term predictions of the sea ice cover. Coupled global climate models (GCMs) consistently project that if greenhouse gas concentrations continue to rise, the eventual outcome will be a complete loss of the multiyear ice cover. However, confidence in these projections depends o HoHoweon the models ability to reproduce features of the present-day climate. Comparison between models participating in the World Climate Research Programme Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) and observations of sea ice extent and thickness show that (1) historical trends from 85% of the model ensemble members remain smaller than observed, and (2) spatial patterns of sea ice thickness are poorly represented in most models. Part of the explanation lies with a failure of models to represent details of the mean atmospheric circulation pattern that governs the transport and spatial distribution of sea ice. These results raise concerns regarding the ability of CMIP5 models to realistically represent the processes driving the decline of Arctic sea ice and to project the timing of when a seasonally ice-free Arctic may be realized. On shorter time-scales, seasonal sea ice prediction has been challenged to predict the sea ice extent from Arctic conditions a few months to a year in advance. Efforts such as the Sea Ice Outlook (SIO) project, originally organized through the Study of Environmental Change (SEARCH) and now managed by the Sea Ice Prediction Network project (SIPN) synthesize predictions of the September sea ice extent based on a variety of approaches, including heuristic, statistical and dynamical modeling. Analysis of SIO contributions reveals that when the\n\nSpringtime atmospheric transport controls Arctic summer sea-ice extent\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKapsch, Marie; Graversen, Rune; TjernstrÃ¶m, Michael\n\n2013-04-01\n\nThe sea-ice extent in the Arctic has been steadily decreasing during the satellite remote sensing era, 1979 to present, with the highest rate of retreat found in September. Contributing factors causing the ice retreat are among others: changes in surface air temperature (SAT; Lindsay and Zhang, 2005), ice circulation in response to winds/pressure patterns (Overland et al., 2008) and ocean currents (Comiso et al., 2008), as well as changes in radiative fluxes (e.g. due to changes in cloud cover; Francis and Hunter, 2006; Maksimovich and Vihma, 2012) and ocean conditions. However, large interannual variability is superimposed onto the declining trend - the ice extent by the end of the summer varies by several million square kilometer between successive years (Serreze et al., 2007). But what are the processes causing the year-to-year ice variability? A comparison of years with an anomalously large September sea-ice extent (HIYs - high ice years) with years showing an anomalously small ice extent (LIYs - low ice years) reveals that the ice variability is most pronounced in the Arctic Ocean north of Siberia (which became almost entirely ice free in September of 2007 and 2012). Significant ice-concentration anomalies of up to 30% are observed for LIYs and HIYs in this area. Focusing on this area we find that the greenhouse effect associated with clouds and water-vapor in spring is crucial for the development of the sea ice during the subsequent months. In years where the end-of-summer sea-ice extent is well below normal, a significantly enhanced transport of humid air is evident during spring into the region where the ice retreat is encountered. The anomalous convergence of humidity increases the cloudiness, resulting in an enhancement of the greenhouse effect. As a result, downward longwave radiation at the surface is larger than usual. In mid May, when the ice anomaly begins to appear and the surface albedo therefore becomes anomalously low, the net shortwave radiation\n\nModulation of the Seasonal Cycle of Antarctic Sea Ice Extent Related to the Southern Annular Mode\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDoddridge, Edward W.; Marshall, John\n\n2017-10-01\n\nThrough analysis of remotely sensed sea surface temperature (SST) and sea ice concentration data, we investigate the impact of winds related to the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) on sea ice extent around Antarctica. We show that positive SAM anomalies in the austral summer are associated with anomalously cold SSTs that persist and lead to anomalous ice growth in the following autumn, while negative SAM anomalies precede warm SSTs and a reduction in sea ice extent during autumn. The largest effect occurs in April, when a unit change in the detrended summertime SAM is followed by a 1.8Â±0.6 Ã105 km2 change in detrended sea ice extent. We find no evidence that sea ice extent anomalies related to the summertime SAM affect the wintertime sea ice extent maximum. Our analysis shows that the wind anomalies related to the negative SAM during the 2016/2017 austral summer contributed to the record minimum Antarctic sea ice extent observed in March 2017.\n\nDynamic and thermodynamic impacts of the winter Arctic Oscillation on summer sea ice extent.\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPark, H. S.; Stewart, A.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nArctic summer sea ice extent exhibits substantial interannual variability, as is highlighted by the remarkable recovery in sea ice extent in 2013 following the record minimum in the summer of 2012. Here, we explore the mechanism via which Arctic Oscillation (AO)-induced ice thickness changes impact summer sea ice, using observations and reanalysis data. A positive AO weakens the basin-scale anticyclonic sea ice drift and decreases the winter ice thickness by 15cm and 10cm in the Eurasian and the Pacific sectors of the Arctic respectively. Three reanalysis datasets show that the (upward) surface heat fluxes are reduced over wide areas of the Arctic, suppressing the ice growth during the positive AO winters. The winter dynamic and thermodynamic thinning preconditions the ice for enhanced radiative forcing via the ice-albedo feedback in late spring-summer, leading to an additional 8-10 cm of thinning over the Pacific sector of the Arctic. Because of these winter AO-induced dynamic and thermodynamics effects, the winter AO explains about 22% (r = -0.48) of the interannual variance of September sea ice extent from year 1980 to 2015.\n\nRecord low lake ice thickness and bedfast ice extent on Alaska's Arctic Coastal Plain in 2017 exemplify the value of monitoring freshwater ice to understand sea-ice forcing and predict permafrost dynamics\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nArp, C. D.; Alexeev, V. A.; Bondurant, A. C.; Creighton, A.; Engram, M. J.; Jones, B. M.; Parsekian, A.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nThe winter of 2016/2017 was exceptionally warm and snowy along the coast of Arctic Alaska partly due to low fall sea ice extent. Based on several decades of field measurements, we documented a new record low maximum ice thickness (MIT) for lakes on the Barrow Peninsula, averaging 1.2 m. This is in comparison to a long-term average MIT of 1.7 m stretching back to 1962 with a maximum of 2.1 m in 1970 and previous minimum of 1.3 m in 2014. The relevance of thinner lake ice in arctic coastal lowlands, where thermokarst lakes cover greater than 20% of the land area, is that permafrost below lakes with bedfast ice is typically preserved. Lakes deeper than the MIT warm and thaw sub-lake permafrost forming taliks. Remote sensing analysis using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is a valuable tool for scaling the field observations of MIT to the entire freshwater landscape to map bedfast ice. A new, long-term time-series of late winter multi-platform SAR from 1992 to 2016 shows a large dynamic range of bedfast ice extent, 29% of lake area or 6% of the total land area over this period, and adding 2017 to this record is expected to extend this range further. Empirical models of lake mean annual bed temperature suggest that permafrost begins to thaw at depths less than 60% of MIT. Based on this information and knowledge of average lake ice growth trajectories, we suggest that future SAR analysis of lake ice should focus on mid-winter (January) to evaluate the extent of bedfast ice and corresponding zones of sub-lake permafrost thaw. Tracking changes in these areas from year to year in mid-winter may provide the best landscape-scale evaluation of changing permafrost conditions in lake-rich arctic lowlands. Because observed changes in MIT coupled with mid-winter bedfast ice extent provide much information on permafrost stability, we suggest that these measurements can serve as Essential Climate Variables (EVCs) to indicate past and future changes in lake-rich arctic regions. The\n\nThe Impact of a Lower Sea Ice Extent on Arctic Greenhouse Gas Exchange\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nParmentier, Frans-Jan W.; Christensen, Torben R.; Lotte SÃ¸rensen, Lise; Rysgaard, SÃ¸ren; McGuire, A. David; Miller, Paul A.; Walker, Donald A.\n\n2013-04-01\n\nArctic sea ice extent hit a new record low in September 2012, when it fell to a level about two times lower than the 1979-2000 average. Record low sea ice extents such as these are often hailed as an obvious example of the impact of climate change on the Arctic. Less obvious, however, are the further implications of a lower sea ice extent on Arctic greenhouse gas exchange. For example, a reduction in sea ice, in consort with a lower snow cover, has been connected to higher surface temperatures in the terrestrial part of the Arctic (Screen et al., 2012). These higher temperatures and longer growing seasons have the potential to alter the CO2 balance of Arctic tundra through enhanced photosynthesis and respiration, as well as the magnitude of methane emissions. In fact, large changes are already observed in terrestrial ecosystems (Post et al., 2009), and concerns have been raised of large releases of carbon through permafrost thaw (Schuur et al., 2011). While these changes in the greenhouse gas balance of the terrestrial Arctic are described in numerous studies, a connection with a decline in sea ice extent is nonetheless seldom made. In addition to these changes on land, a lower sea ice extent also has a direct effect on the exchange of greenhouse gases between the ocean and the atmosphere. For example, due to sea ice retreat, more ocean surface remains in contact with the atmosphere, and this has been suggested to increase the oceanic uptake of CO2 (Bates et al., 2006). However, the sustainability of this increased uptake is uncertain (Cai et al., 2010), and carbon fluxes related directly to the sea ice itself add much uncertainty to the oceanic uptake of CO2 (Nomura et al., 2006; Rysgaard et al., 2007). Furthermore, significant emissions of methane from the Arctic Ocean have been observed (Kort et al., 2012; Shakhova et al., 2010), but the consequence of a lower sea ice extent thereon is still unclear. Overall, the decline in sea ice that has been seen in recent\n\nObservations reveal external driver for Arctic sea-ice retreat\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nNotz, Dirk; Marotzke, Jochem\n\n2012-04-01\n\nThe very low summer extent of Arctic sea ice that has been observed in recent years is often casually interpreted as an early-warning sign of anthropogenic global warming. For examining the validity of this claim, previously IPCC model simulations have been used. Here, we focus on the available observational record to examine if this record allows us to identify either internal variability, self-acceleration, or a specific external forcing as the main driver for the observed sea-ice retreat. We find that the available observations are sufficient to virtually exclude internal variability and self-acceleration as an explanation for the observed long-term trend, clustering, and magnitude of recent sea-ice minima. Instead, the recent retreat is well described by the superposition of an externally forced linear trend and internal variability. For the externally forced trend, we find a physically plausible strong correlation only with increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration. Our results hence show that the observed evolution of Arctic sea-ice extent is consistent with the claim that virtually certainly the impact of an anthropogenic climate change is observable in Arctic sea ice already today.\n\nThe Impact of Geothermal Heat on the Scandinavian Ice Sheet's LGM Extent\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSzuman, Izabela; Ewertowski, Marek W.; Kalita, Jakub Z.\n\n2016-04-01\n\nThe last Scandinavian ice sheet attained its most southern extent over Poland and Germany, protruding c. 200 km south of the main ice sheet mass. There are number of factors that may control ice sheet dynamics and extent. One of the less recognised is geothermal heat, which is heat that is supplied to the base of the ice sheet. A heat at the ice/bed interface plays a crucial role in controlling ice sheet stability, as well as impacting basal temperatures, melting, and ice flow velocities. However, the influence of geothermal heat is still virtually neglected in reconstructions and modelling of paleo-ice sheets behaviour. Only in a few papers is geothermal heat recalled though often in the context of past climatic conditions. Thus, the major question is if and how spatial differences in geothermal heat had influenced paleo-ice sheet dynamics and in consequence their extent. Here, we assumed that the configuration of the ice sheet along its southern margin was moderately to strongly correlated with geothermal heat for Poland and non or negatively correlated for Germany.\n\nChange in the Extent of Baffin Island's Penny Ice Cap in Response to Regional Warming, 1969 - 2014\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCox, M. C.; Cormier, H. M.; Gardner, A. S.\n\n2014-12-01\n\nGlaciers are retreating globally in response to warmer atmospheric temperatures, adding large volumes of melt water to the world's oceans. The largest glacierized region and present-day contributor to sea level rise outside of the massive ice sheets is the Canadian Arctic. Recent work has shown that the glaciers of the southern Canadian Arctic (Baffin and Bylot Island) have experienced accelerated rates of ice loss in recent decades, but little is known regarding the spatial and temporal variations in rates of loss. For this study we examine in detail changes in the extent of the Penny Ice Cap (a proxy for ice loss) between 1969 and 2014 to better understand the climatic drivers of the recently observed accelerated rates of ice loss on Baffin Island. To do this, we reconstruct the extent of the ice cap for the year 1969 from historical maps and for the years 1985, 1995, 2010, and 2014 from Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 8 OLI imagery. We use 2009 SPOT HRS imagery and a novel extent comparison algorithm to assess the accuracy of glacier extents derived from Landsat imagery. Regional temperature and precipitation records were used to explain the spatial pattern of change. Due to large variation in elevations, hypsometry was also investigated as a contributor to differences in rates of change across the ice cap. Preliminary results show overall retreat throughout the ice cap but with regional differences in area and length change on either side of the Ice Cap divide.\n\nInsight into glacier climate interaction: reconstruction of the mass balance field using ice extent data\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nVisnjevic, Vjeran; Herman, FrÃ©dÃ©ric; Licul, Aleksandar\n\n2016-04-01\n\nWith the end of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), about 20 000 years ago, ended the most recent long-lasting cold phase in Earth's history. We recently developed a model that describes large-scale erosion and its response to climate and dynamical changes with the application to the Alps for the LGM period. Here we will present an inverse approach we have recently developed to infer the LGM mass balance from known ice extent data, focusing on a glacier or ice cap. The ice flow model is developed using the shallow ice approximation and the developed codes are accelerated using GPUs capabilities. The mass balance field is the constrained variable defined by the balance rate Î² and the equilibrium line altitude (ELA), where c is the cutoff value: b = max(Î²á¹¡(S(z) - ELA), c) We show that such a mass balance can be constrained from the observed past ice extent and ice thickness. We are also investigating several different geostatistical methods to constrain spatially variable mass balance, and derive uncertainties on each of the mass balance parameters.\n\nInfluence of Arctic Sea Ice Extent on Polar Cloud Fraction and Vertical Structure and Implications for Regional Climate\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nPalm, Stephen P.; Strey, Sara T.; Spinhirne, James; Markus, Thorsten\n\n2010-01-01\n\nRecent satellite lidar measurements of cloud properties spanning a period of 5 years are used to examine a possible connection between Arctic sea ice amount and polar cloud fraction and vertical distribution. We find an anticorrelation between sea ice extent and cloud fraction with maximum cloudiness occurring over areas with little or no sea ice. We also find that over ice!free regions, there is greater low cloud frequency and average optical depth. Most of the optical depth increase is due to the presence of geometrically thicker clouds over water. In addition, our analysis indicates that over the last 5 years, October and March average polar cloud fraction has increased by about 7% and 10%, respectively, as year average sea ice extent has decreased by 5% 7%. The observed cloud changes are likely due to a number of effects including, but not limited to, the observed decrease in sea ice extent and thickness. Increasing cloud amount and changes in vertical distribution and optical properties have the potential to affect the radiative balance of the Arctic region by decreasing both the upwelling terrestrial longwave radiation and the downward shortwave solar radiation. Because longwave radiation dominates in the long polar winter, the overall effect of increasing low cloud cover is likely a warming of the Arctic and thus a positive climate feedback, possibly accelerating the melting of Arctic sea ice.\n\nEstimating the extent of Antarctic summer sea ice during the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nEdinburgh, Tom; Day, Jonathan J.\n\n2016-11-01\n\nIn stark contrast to the sharp decline in Arctic sea ice, there has been a steady increase in ice extent around Antarctica during the last three decades, especially in the Weddell and Ross seas. In general, climate models do not to capture this trend and a lack of information about sea ice coverage in the pre-satellite period limits our ability to quantify the sensitivity of sea ice to climate change and robustly validate climate models. However, evidence of the presence and nature of sea ice was often recorded during early Antarctic exploration, though these sources have not previously been explored or exploited until now. We have analysed observations of the summer sea ice edge from the ship logbooks of explorers such as Robert Falcon Scott, Ernest Shackleton and their contemporaries during the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration (1897-1917), and in this study we compare these to satellite observations from the period 1989-2014, offering insight into the ice conditions of this period, from direct observations, for the first time. This comparison shows that the summer sea ice edge was between 1.0 and 1.7Â° further north in the Weddell Sea during this period but that ice conditions were surprisingly comparable to the present day in other sectors.\n\nPredicting the Extent of Summer Sea Ice in the Arctic\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRigor, I. G.; Wallace, J. M.\n\n2003-12-01\n\nThe summers of 1998 and 2002 had the least sea ice extent (SIE) in the Arctic. These observations seem to agree with the trends noted by Parkinson, et al. (1999, hereafter P99) for the period 1979-1997, but the spatial pattern of these recent decreases in summer SIE were different. The summer trends shown by P99, exhibit large decreases in SIE primarily in the East Siberian Sea (ESS), while the decreases observed during 1998 and 2002 were much larger in the Beaufort and Chukchi seas (BCS). We now show that the trends for the period 1979 - 2002 are much smaller in the ESS than the trends shown by P99, and the largest decreasing trends have shifted from the ESS to the BCS. Rigor, et al. (2002) showed that the changes in SIE that P99 noted were driven by changes in atmospheric circulation related to the phase of the prior winter Arctic Oscillation (AO, Thompson and Wallace, 1998) index. Given that the latest trends in SIE are different than those shown by P99, one could ask whether the affect of the AO on sea ice noted by Rigor, et al. (2002) has also changed, and whether some large scale climate modes other than the AO has influenced the climate of the Arctic Ocean more? To answer these questions, we applied Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis on the September SIE data from microwave satellites, and found that the first two modes SIE were most highly correlated to the prior winter AO, and the AO index of the summer months just prior to each September. These modes explain more than 45% of the variance in SIE, and show that the influence of the winter and summer AO dominates Arctic climate from 1979 - 2002. Using data from the International Arctic Buoy Programme and the National Centers for Environmental Prediction, we will show that the changes in sea ice extent are primarily driven by dynamic changes in sea ice thickness and discuss the implications for predicting summer SIE.\n\nRecalculated Areas for Maximum Ice Extents of the Baltic Sea During Winters 1971-2008\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nNiskanen, T.; Vainio, J.; Eriksson, P.; Heiler, I.\n\n2009-04-01\n\nPublication of operational ice charts in Finland was started from the Baltic Sea in a year 1915. Until year 1993 all ice charts were hand drawn paper copies but in the year 1993 ice charting software IceMap was introduced. Since then all ice charts were produced digitally. Since the year 1996 IceMap has had an option that user can calculate areas of single ice area polygons in the chart. Using this option the area of the maximum ice extent can be easily solved fully automatically. Before this option was introduced (and in full operation) all maximum extent areas were calculated manually by a planimeter. During recent years it has become clear that some areas calculated before 1996 don't give the same result as IceMap. Differences can come from for example inaccuracy of old coastlines, map projections, the calibration of the planimeter or interpretation of old ice area symbols. Old ice charts since winter 1970-71 have now been scanned, rectified and re-drawn. New maximum ice extent areas for Baltic Sea have now been re-calculated. By these new technological tools it can be concluded that in some cases clear differences can be found.\n\nA Detailed Geophysical Investigation of the Grounding of Henry Ice Rise, with Implications for Holocene Ice-Sheet Extent.\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWearing, M.; Kingslake, J.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nIt is generally assumed that since the Last Glacial Maximum the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) has experienced monotonic retreat of the grounding line (GL). However, recent studies have cast doubt on this assumption, suggesting that the retreat of the WAIS grounding line may have been followed by a significant advance during the Holocene in the Weddell and Ross Sea sectors. Constraining this evolution is important as reconstructions of past ice-sheet extent are used to spin-up predictive ice-sheet models and correct mass-balance observations for glacial isostatic adjustment. Here we examine in detail the formation of the Henry Ice Rise (HIR), which ice-sheet model simulations suggest played a key role in Holocene ice-mass changes in the Weddell Sea sector. Observations from a high-resolution ground-based, ice-penetrating radar survey are best explained if the ice rise formed when the Ronne Ice Shelf grounded on a submarine high, underwent a period of ice-rumple flow, before the GL migrated outwards to form the present-day ice rise. We constrain the relative chronology of this evolution by comparing the alignment and intersection of isochronal internal layers, relic crevasses, surface features and investigating the dynamic processes leading to their complex structure. We also draw analogies between HIR and the neighbouring Doake Ice Rumples. The date of formation is estimated using vertical velocities derived with a phase-sensitive radio-echo sounder (pRES). Ice-sheet models suggest that the formation of the HIR and other ice rises may have halted and reversed large-scale GL retreat. Hence the small-scale dynamics of these crucial regions could have wide-reaching consequences for future ice-sheet mass changes and constraining their formation and evolution further would be beneficial. One stringent test of our geophysics-based conclusions would be to drill to the bed of HIR to sample the ice for isotopic analysis and the bed for radiocarbon analysis.\n\nData-adaptive Harmonic Decomposition and Real-time Prediction of Arctic Sea Ice Extent\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKondrashov, Dmitri; Chekroun, Mickael; Ghil, Michael\n\n2017-04-01\n\nDecline in the Arctic sea ice extent (SIE) has profound socio-economic implications and is a focus of active scientific research. Of particular interest is prediction of SIE on subseasonal time scales, i.e. from early summer into fall, when sea ice coverage in Arctic reaches its minimum. However, subseasonal forecasting of SIE is very challenging due to the high variability of ocean and atmosphere over Arctic in summer, as well as shortness of observational data and inadequacies of the physics-based models to simulate sea-ice dynamics. The Sea Ice Outlook (SIO) by Sea Ice Prediction Network (SIPN, http://www.arcus.org/sipn) is a collaborative effort to facilitate and improve subseasonal prediction of September SIE by physics-based and data-driven statistical models. Data-adaptive Harmonic Decomposition (DAH) and Multilayer Stuart-Landau Models (MSLM) techniques [Chekroun and Kondrashov, 2017], have been successfully applied to the nonlinear stochastic modeling, as well as retrospective and real-time forecasting of Multisensor Analyzed Sea Ice Extent (MASIE) dataset in key four Arctic regions. In particular, DAH-MSLM predictions outperformed most statistical models and physics-based models in real-time 2016 SIO submissions. The key success factors are associated with DAH ability to disentangle complex regional dynamics of MASIE by data-adaptive harmonic spatio-temporal patterns that reduce the data-driven modeling effort to elemental MSLMs stacked per frequency with fixed and small number of model coefficients to estimate.\n\nUpdate on the Greenland Ice Sheet Melt Extent: 1979-1999\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nAbdalati, Waleed; Steffen, Konrad\n\n2000-01-01\n\nAnalysis of melt extent on the Greenland ice sheet is updated to span the time period 1979-1999 is examined along with its spatial and temporal variability using passive microwave satellite data. In order to acquire the full record, the issue of continuity between previous passive microwave sensors (SMMR, SSM/I F-8, and SSM/I F-11), and the most recent SSM/I F-13 sensor is addressed. The F-13 Cross-polarized gradient ratio (XPGR) melt-classification threshold is determined to be -0.0154. Results show that for the 21-year record, an increasing melt trend of nearly 1 %/yr is observed, and this trend is driven by conditions on in the western portion of the ice sheet, rather than the east, where melt appears to have decreased slightly. Moreover, the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo in 1991 is likely to have had some impact the melt, but not as much as previously suspected. The 1992 melt anomaly is 1.7 standard deviations from the mean. Finally, the relationship between coastal temperatures and melt extent suggest an increase in surface runoff contribution to sea level of 0.31 mm/yr for a 1 C temperature rise.\n\nThe role of declining summer sea ice extent in increasing Arctic winter precipitation\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHamman, J.; Roberts, A.; Cassano, J. J.; Nijssen, B.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nIn the past three decades, the Arctic has experienced large declines in summer sea ice cover, permafrost extent, and spring snow cover, and increases in winter precipitation. This study explores the relationship between declining Arctic sea ice extent (IE) and winter precipitation (WP) across the Arctic land masses. The first part of this presentation presents the observed relationship between IE and WP. Using satellite estimates of IE and WP data based on a combination of in-situ observations and global reanalyses, we show that WP is negatively correlated with summer IE and that this relationship is strongest before the year 2000. After 2000, around the time IE minima began to decline most rapidly, the relationship between IE and WP degenerates. This indicates that other processes are driving changes in IE and WP. We hypothesize that positive anomalies in poleward moisture transport have historically driven anomalously low IE and high WP, and that since the significant decline in IE, moisture divergence from the central Arctic has been a larger contributor to WP over land. To better understand the physical mechanisms driving the observed changes in the Arctic climate system and the sensitivity of the Arctic climate system to declining sea ice, we have used the fully-coupled Regional Arctic System Model (RASM) to simulate two distinct sea ice climates. The first climate represents normal IE, while the second includes reduced summer IE. The second portion of this presentation analyzes these two RASM simulations, in conjunction with our observation-based analysis, to understand the coupled relationship between poleward moisture transport, IE, evaporation from the Arctic Ocean, and precipitation. We will present the RASM-simulated Arctic water budget and demonstrate the role of IE in driving WP anomalies. Finally, a spatial correlation analysis identifies characteristic patterns in IE, ocean evaporation, and polar cap convergence that contribute to anomalies in WP.\n\nDeveloping and Implementing Protocols for Arctic Sea Ice Observations\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPerovich, Donald K.; Gerland, Sebastian\n\n2009-05-01\n\nArctic Surface-Based Sea Ice Observations: Integrated Protocols and Coordinated Data Acquisition; TromsÃ¸, Norway, 26-27 January 2009; The Arctic sea ice cover is diminishing. Over the past several years, not only has ice thinned but the extent of ice at the end of summer, and hence perennial ice, has declined markedly. These changes affect a wide range of issues and are important for a varied group of stakeholders, including Arctic coastal communities, policy makers, industry, the scientific community, and the public. Concerns range from the role of sea ice cover as an indicator and amplifier of climate change to marine transportation, resource extraction, and coastal erosion. To understand and respond to these ongoing changes, it is imperative to develop and implement consistent and robust observational protocols that can be used to describe the current state of the ice cover as well as future changes.\n\nThe impact of lower sea-ice extent on Arctic greenhouse-gas exchange\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nParmentier, Frans-Jan W.; Christensen, Torben R.; SÃ¸rensen, Lise Lotte; Rysgaard, SÃ¸ren; McGuire, A. David; Miller, Paul A.; Walker, Donald A.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nIn September 2012, Arctic sea-ice extent plummeted to a new record low: two times lower than the 1979â2000 average. Often, record lows in sea-ice cover are hailed as an example of climate change impacts in the Arctic. Less apparent, however, are the implications of reduced sea-ice cover in the Arctic Ocean for marineâatmosphere CO2 exchange. Sea-ice decline has been connected to increasing air temperatures at high latitudes. Temperature is a key controlling factor in the terrestrial exchange of CO2 and methane, and therefore the greenhouse-gas balance of the Arctic. Despite the large potential for feedbacks, many studies do not connect the diminishing sea-ice extent with changes in the interaction of the marine and terrestrial Arctic with the atmosphere. In this Review, we assess how current understanding of the Arctic Ocean and high-latitude ecosystems can be used to predict the impact of a lower sea-ice cover on Arctic greenhouse-gas exchange.\n\nBellingshausen Sea Ice Extent Recorded in an Antarctic Peninsula Ice Core\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nPorter, Stacy E.; Parkinson, Claire L.; Mosley-Thompson, Ellen\n\n2016-01-01\n\nAnnual net accumulation (A(sub n)) from the Bruce Plateau (BP) ice core retrieved from the Antarctic Peninsula exhibits a notable relationship with sea ice extent (SIE) in the Bellingshausen Sea. Over the satellite era, both BP A(sub n) and Bellingshausen SIE are influenced by large-scale climatic factors such as the Amundsen Sea Low, Southern Annular Mode, and Southern Oscillation. In addition to the direct response of BP A(sub n) to Bellingshausen SIE (e.g., more open water as a moisture source), these large-scale climate phenomena also link the BP and the Bellingshausen Sea indirectly such that they exhibit similar responses (e.g., northerly wind anomalies advect warm, moist air to the Antarctic Peninsula and neighboring Bellingshausen Sea, which reduces SIE and increases A(sub n)). Comparison with a time series of fast ice at South Orkney Islands reveals a relationship between BP A(sub n) and sea ice in the northern Weddell Sea that is relatively consistent over the twentieth century, except when it is modulated by atmospheric wave patterns described by the Trans-Polar Index. The trend of increasing accumulation on the Bruce Plateau since approximately 1970 agrees with other climate records and reconstructions in the region and suggests that the current rate of sea ice loss in the Bellingshausen Sea is unrivaled in the twentieth century.\n\nThe Influence of Arctic Sea Ice Extent on Polar Cloud Fraction and Vertical Structure and Implications for Regional Climate\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nPalm, Stephen P.; Strey, Sara T.; Spinhirne, James; Markus, Thorsten\n\n2010-01-01\n\nRecent satellite lidar measurements of cloud properties spanning a period of five years are used to examine a possible connection between Arctic sea ice amount and polar cloud fraction and vertical distribution. We find an anti-correlation between sea ice extent and cloud fraction with maximum cloudiness occurring over areas with little or no sea ice. We also find that over ice free regions, there is greater low cloud frequency and average optical depth. Most of the optical depth increase is due to the presence of geometrically thicker clouds over water. In addition, our analysis indicates that over the last 5 years, October and March average polar cloud fraction has increased by about 7 and 10 percent, respectively, as year average sea ice extent has decreased by 5 to 7 percent. The observed cloud changes are likely due to a number of effects including, but not limited to, the observed decrease in sea ice extent and thickness. Increasing cloud amount and changes in vertical distribution and optical properties have the potential to affect the radiative balance of the Arctic region by decreasing both the upwelling terrestrial longwave radiation and the downward shortwave solar radiation. Since longwave radiation dominates in the long polar winter, the overall effect of increasing low cloud cover is likely a warming of the Arctic and thus a positive climate feedback, possibly accelerating the melting of Arctic sea ice.\n\nArctic sea ice decline: Projected changes in timing and extent of sea ice in the Bering and Chukchi Seas\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nDouglas, David C.\n\n2010-01-01\n\namong models. High agreement also accompanies projections that the Chukchi Sea will be completely ice covered during February, March, and April at the end of the century. Large uncertainties, however, are associated with the timing and amount of partial ice cover during the intervening periods of melt and freeze. For the Bering Sea, median March ice extent is projected to be about 25 percent less than the 1979-1988 average by mid-century and 60 percent less by the end of the century. The ice-free season in the Bering Sea is projected to increase from its contemporary average of 5.5 months to a median of about 8.5 months by the end of the century. A 3-month longer ice- free season in the Bering Sea is attained by a 1-month advance in melt and a 2-month delay in freeze, meaning the ice edge typically will pass through the Bering Strait in May and January at the end of the century rather than June and November as presently observed.\n\nVariability and Trends in Sea Ice Extent and Ice Production in the Ross Sea\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nComiso, Josefino; Kwok, Ronald; Martin, Seelye; Gordon, Arnold L.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nSalt release during sea ice formation in the Ross Sea coastal regions is regarded as a primary forcing for the regional generation of Antarctic Bottom Water. Passive microwave data from November 1978 through 2008 are used to examine the detailed seasonal and interannual characteristics of the sea ice cover of the Ross Sea and the adjacent Bellingshausen and Amundsen seas. For this period the sea ice extent in the Ross Sea shows the greatest increase of all the Antarctic seas. Variability in the ice cover in these regions is linked to changes in the Southern Annular Mode and secondarily to the Antarctic Circumpolar Wave. Over the Ross Sea shelf, analysis of sea ice drift data from 1992 to 2008 yields a positive rate of increase in the net ice export of about 30,000 sq km/yr. For a characteristic ice thickness of 0.6 m, this yields a volume transport of about 20 cu km/yr, which is almost identical, within error bars, to our estimate of the trend in ice production. The increase in brine rejection in the Ross Shelf Polynya associated with the estimated increase with the ice production, however, is not consistent with the reported Ross Sea salinity decrease. The locally generated sea ice enhancement of Ross Sea salinity may be offset by an increase of relatively low salinity of the water advected into the region from the Amundsen Sea, a consequence of increased precipitation and regional glacial ice melt.\n\nObserved and Modeled Trends in Southern Ocean Sea Ice\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nParkinson, Claire L.\n\n2003-01-01\n\nConceptual models and global climate model (GCM) simulations have both indicated the likelihood of an enhanced sensitivity to climate change in the polar regions, derived from the positive feedbacks brought about by the polar abundance of snow and ice surfaces. Some models further indicate that the changes in the polar regions can have a significant impact globally. For instance, 37% of the temperature sensitivity to a doubling of atmospheric CO2 in simulations with the GCM of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) is attributable exclusively to inclusion of sea ice variations in the model calculations. Both sea ice thickness and sea ice extent decrease markedly in the doubled CO, case, thereby allowing the ice feedbacks to occur. Stand-alone sea ice models have shown Southern Ocean hemispherically averaged winter ice-edge retreats of 1.4 deg latitude for each 1 K increase in atmospheric temperatures. Observations, however, show a much more varied Southern Ocean ice cover, both spatially and temporally, than many of the modeled expectations. In fact, the satellite passive-microwave record of Southern Ocean sea ice since late 1978 has revealed overall increases rather than decreases in ice extents, with ice extent trends on the order of 11,000 sq km/year. When broken down spatially, the positive trends are strongest in the Ross Sea, while the trends are negative in the Bellingshausen/Amundsen Seas. Greater spatial detail can be obtained by examining trends in the length of the sea ice season, and those trends show a coherent picture of shortening sea ice seasons throughout almost the entire Bellingshausen and Amundsen Seas to the west of the Antarctic Peninsula and in the far western Weddell Sea immediately to the east of the Peninsula, with lengthening sea ice seasons around much of the rest of the continent. This pattern corresponds well with the spatial pattern of temperature trends, as the Peninsula region is the one region in the Antarctic with a strong\n\nEvidence for smaller extents of the northwestern Greenland Ice Sheet and North Ice Cap during the Holocene\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKelly, M. A.; Osterberg, E. C.; Axford, Y.; Bigl, M.; Birkel, S. D.; Corbett, L. B.; Roy, E. P.; Thompson, J. T.; Whitecloud, S.\n\n2013-12-01\n\nThe Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) and local glaciers on Greenland are responding dynamically to warming temperatures with widespread retreat. GRACE satellite data (e.g., Kahn et al., 2010) and the Petermann Glacier calving events document the recent expansion of ice loss into northwestern Greenland. To improve the ability to estimate future ice loss in a warming climate, we are developing records of the response of the northwestern Greenlandic cryosphere to Holocene climatic conditions, with a focus on past warm periods. Our ongoing research includes analyses of glacial geology, sub-fossil vegetation, lake sediment cores, chironomid assemblages and ice cores combined with glaciological modeling. To constrain past ice extents that were as small as, or smaller than, at present, we recovered sub-fossil vegetation exposed at the receding margins of the GrIS and North Ice Cap (NIC) in the Nunatarssuaq region (~76.7Â°N, 67.4Â°W) and of the GrIS near Thule (~76.5Â°N, 68.7Â°W). We present vegetation types and radiocarbon ages of 30 plant samples collected in August 2012. In the Nunatarssuaq region, five ages of in situ (rooted) vegetation including Polytrichum moss, Saxifraga nathorstii and grasses located <5 m outboard of the GrIS margin are ~120-200 cal yr BP (range of medians of the 2-sigma calibrated age ranges). Nine ages of in situ Polytrichum, Saxifraga oppositafolia and grasses from ~1-5 m inboard of the NIC margin (excavated from beneath ice) range from ~50 to 310 cal yr BP. The growth of these plants occurred when the GrIS and NIC were at least as small as at present and their ages suggest that ice advances occurred in the last 50-120 yrs. In addition to the in situ samples, we collected plants from well-preserved ground material exposed along shear planes in the GrIS margins. In Nunatarssuaq, two Polytrichum mosses rooted in ground material and exposed along a shear plane in the GrIS margin date to 4680 and 4730 cal yr BP. Near Thule, three ages of Salix arctica\n\nBedrock Erosion Surfaces Record Former East Antarctic Ice Sheet Extent\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPaxman, Guy J. G.; Jamieson, Stewart S. R.; Ferraccioli, Fausto; Bentley, Michael J.; Ross, Neil; Armadillo, Egidio; Gasson, Edward G. W.; Leitchenkov, German; DeConto, Robert M.\n\n2018-05-01\n\nEast Antarctica hosts large subglacial basins into which the East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS) likely retreated during past warmer climates. However, the extent of retreat remains poorly constrained, making quantifying past and predicted future contributions to global sea level rise from these marine basins challenging. Geomorphological analysis and flexural modeling within the Wilkes Subglacial Basin are used to reconstruct the ice margin during warm intervals of the Oligocene-Miocene. Flat-lying bedrock plateaus are indicative of an ice sheet margin positioned >400-500 km inland of the modern grounding zone for extended periods of the Oligocene-Miocene, equivalent to a 2-m rise in global sea level. Our findings imply that if major EAIS retreat occurs in the future, isostatic rebound will enable the plateau surfaces to act as seeding points for extensive ice rises, thus limiting extensive ice margin retreat of the scale seen during the early EAIS.\n\nRevisiting the Potential of Melt Pond Fraction as a Predictor for the Seasonal Arctic Sea Ice Extent Minimum\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nLiu, Jiping; Song, Mirong; Horton, Radley M.; Hu, Yongyun\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe rapid change in Arctic sea ice in recent decades has led to a rising demand for seasonal sea ice prediction. A recent modeling study that employed a prognostic melt pond model in a stand-alone sea ice model found that September Arctic sea ice extent can be accurately predicted from the melt pond fraction in May. Here we show that satellite observations show no evidence of predictive skill in May. However, we find that a significantly strong relationship (high predictability) first emerges as the melt pond fraction is integrated from early May to late June, with a persistent strong relationship only occurring after late July. Our results highlight that late spring to mid summer melt pond information is required to improve the prediction skill of the seasonal sea ice minimum. Furthermore, satellite observations indicate a much higher percentage of melt pond formation in May than does the aforementioned model simulation, which points to the need to reconcile model simulations and observations, in order to better understand key mechanisms of melt pond formation and evolution and their influence on sea ice state.\n\nSkillful Spring Forecasts of September Arctic Sea Ice Extent Using Passive Microwave Data\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nPetty, A. A.; Schroder, D.; Stroeve, J. C.; Markus, Thorsten; Miller, Jeffrey A.; Kurtz, Nathan Timothy; Feltham, D. L.; Flocco, D.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nIn this study, we demonstrate skillful spring forecasts of detrended September Arctic sea ice extent using passive microwave observations of sea ice concentration (SIC) and melt onset (MO). We compare these to forecasts produced using data from a sophisticated melt pond model, and find similar to higher skill values, where the forecast skill is calculated relative to linear trend persistence. The MO forecasts shows the highest skill in March-May, while the SIC forecasts produce the highest skill in June-August, especially when the forecasts are evaluated over recent years (since 2008). The high MO forecast skill in early spring appears to be driven primarily by the presence and timing of open water anomalies, while the high SIC forecast skill appears to be driven by both open water and surface melt processes. Spatial maps of detrended anomalies highlight the drivers of the different forecasts, and enable us to understand regions of predictive importance. Correctly capturing sea ice state anomalies, along with changes in open water coverage appear to be key processes in skillfully forecasting summer Arctic sea ice.\n\nTropically driven and externally forced patterns of Antarctic sea ice change: reconciling observed and modeled trends\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSchneider, David P.; Deser, Clara\n\n2018-06-01\n\nRecent work suggests that natural variability has played a significant role in the increase of Antarctic sea ice extent during 1979-2013. The ice extent has responded strongly to atmospheric circulation changes, including a deepened Amundsen Sea Low (ASL), which in part has been driven by tropical variability. Nonetheless, this increase has occurred in the context of externally forced climate change, and it has been difficult to reconcile observed and modeled Antarctic sea ice trends. To understand observed-model disparities, this work defines the internally driven and radiatively forced patterns of Antarctic sea ice change and exposes potential model biases using results from two sets of historical experiments of a coupled climate model compared with observations. One ensemble is constrained only by external factors such as greenhouse gases and stratospheric ozone, while the other explicitly accounts for the influence of tropical variability by specifying observed SST anomalies in the eastern tropical Pacific. The latter experiment reproduces the deepening of the ASL, which drives an increase in regional ice extent due to enhanced ice motion and sea surface cooling. However, the overall sea ice trend in every ensemble member of both experiments is characterized by ice loss and is dominated by the forced pattern, as given by the ensemble-mean of the first experiment. This pervasive ice loss is associated with a strong warming of the ocean mixed layer, suggesting that the ocean model does not locally store or export anomalous heat efficiently enough to maintain a surface environment conducive to sea ice expansion. The pervasive upper-ocean warming, not seen in observations, likely reflects ocean mean-state biases.\n\nTropically driven and externally forced patterns of Antarctic sea ice change: reconciling observed and modeled trends\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSchneider, David P.; Deser, Clara\n\n2017-09-01\n\nRecent work suggests that natural variability has played a significant role in the increase of Antarctic sea ice extent during 1979-2013. The ice extent has responded strongly to atmospheric circulation changes, including a deepened Amundsen Sea Low (ASL), which in part has been driven by tropical variability. Nonetheless, this increase has occurred in the context of externally forced climate change, and it has been difficult to reconcile observed and modeled Antarctic sea ice trends. To understand observed-model disparities, this work defines the internally driven and radiatively forced patterns of Antarctic sea ice change and exposes potential model biases using results from two sets of historical experiments of a coupled climate model compared with observations. One ensemble is constrained only by external factors such as greenhouse gases and stratospheric ozone, while the other explicitly accounts for the influence of tropical variability by specifying observed SST anomalies in the eastern tropical Pacific. The latter experiment reproduces the deepening of the ASL, which drives an increase in regional ice extent due to enhanced ice motion and sea surface cooling. However, the overall sea ice trend in every ensemble member of both experiments is characterized by ice loss and is dominated by the forced pattern, as given by the ensemble-mean of the first experiment. This pervasive ice loss is associated with a strong warming of the ocean mixed layer, suggesting that the ocean model does not locally store or export anomalous heat efficiently enough to maintain a surface environment conducive to sea ice expansion.

C.; Anderson, M. R.\n\n2011-12-01\n\nLittle research has gone into studying the concurrent variations in the annual loss of continental snow cover and sea ice extent across the land-ocean boundary, however, the analysis of these data averaged spatially over three study regions located in North America and Eastern and Western Russia, reveals a distinct difference in the response of anomalous snow and sea ice conditions to the atmospheric forcing. This study compares the monthly continental snow cover and sea ice extent loss in the Arctic, during the melt season months (May-August) for the period 1979-2007, with regional atmospheric conditions known to influence summer melt including: mean sea level pressures, 925 hPa air temperatures, and mean 2 m U and V wind vectors from NCEP/DOE Reanalysis 2. The monthly hemispheric snow cover extent data used are from the Rutgers University Global Snow Lab and sea ice extents for this study are derived from the monthly passive microwave satellite Bootstrap algorithm sea ice concentrations available from the National Snow and Ice Data Center. Three case study years (1985, 1996, and 2007) are used to compare the direct response of monthly anomalous sea ice and snow cover areal extents to monthly mean atmospheric forcing averaged spatially over the extent of each study region. This comparison is then expanded for all summer months over the 29 year study period where the monthly persistence of sea ice and snow cover extent anomalies and changes in the sea ice and snow conditions under differing atmospheric conditions are explored further. The monthly anomalous atmospheric conditions are classified into four categories including: warmer temperatures with higher pressures, warmer temperatures with lower pressures, cooler temperatures with higher pressures, and cooler temperatures with lower pressures. Analysis of the atmospheric conditions surrounding anomalous loss of snow and ice cover over the independent study regions indicates that conditions of warmer temperatures\n\nCorrelating Ice Cores from Quelccaya Ice Cap with Chronology from Little Ice Age Glacial Extents\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nStroup, J. S.; Kelly, M. A.; Lowell, T. V.\n\n2010-12-01\n\nProxy records indicate Southern Hemisphere climatic changes during the Little Ice Age (LIA; ~1300-1850 AD). In particular, records of change in and around the tropical latitudes require attention because these areas are sensitive to climatic change and record the dynamic interplay between hemispheres (Oerlemans, 2005). Despite this significance, relatively few records exist for the southern tropics. Here we present a reconstruction of glacial fluctuations of Quelccaya Ice Cap (QIC), Peruvian Andes, from pre-LIA up to the present day. In the Qori Kalis valley, extensive sets of moraines exist beginning with the 1963 AD ice margin (Thompson et al., 2006) and getting progressively older down valley. Several of these older moraines can be traced and are continuous with moraines in the Challpa Cocha valley. These moraines have been dated at <1050-1350-AD (Mercer and Palacios, 1977) and interpreted to have been deposited during the Little Ice Age. We present a new suite of surface exposure and radiocarbon dates collected in 2008 and 2009 that constrain the ages of these moraines. Preliminary 10Be ages of boulder surfaces atop the moraines range from ~350-1370 AD. Maximum and minimum-limiting radiocarbon ages bracketing the moraines are ~0-1800 AD. The chronology of past ice cap extents are correlated with ice core records from QIC which show an accumulation increase during ~1500-1700 AD and an accumulation decrease during ~1720-1860 AD (Thompson et al., 1985; 1986; 2006). In addition, other proxy records from Peru and the tropics are correlated with the records at QIC as a means to understand climate conditions during the LIA. This work forms the basis for future modeling of the glacial system during the LIA at QIC and for modeling of past temperature and precipitation regimes at high altitude in the tropics.\n\nSeasonal and interannual variability of fast ice extent in the southeastern Laptev Sea between 1999 and 2013\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSelyuzhenok, V.; Krumpen, T.; Mahoney, A.; Janout, M.; Gerdes, R.\n\n2015-12-01\n\nAlong with changes in sea ice extent, thickness, and drift speed, Arctic sea ice regime is characterized by a decrease of fast ice season and reduction of fast ice extent. The most extensive fast ice cover in the Arctic develops in the southeastern Laptev Sea. Using weekly operational sea ice charts produced by Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute (AARI, Russia) from 1999 to 2013, we identified five main key events that characterize the annual evolution of fast ice in the southeastern Laptev Sea. Linking the occurrence of the key events with the atmospheric forcing, bathymetry, freezeup, and melt onset, we examined the processes driving annual fast ice cycle. The analysis revealed that fast ice in the region is sensitive to thermodynamic processes throughout a season, while the wind has a strong influence only on the first stages of fast ice development. The maximal fast ice extent is closely linked to the bathymetry and local topography and is primarily defined by the location of shoals, where fast ice is likely grounded. The annual fast ice cycle shows significant changes over the period of investigation, with tendencies toward later fast ice formation and earlier breakup. These tendencies result in an overall decrease of the fast ice season by 2.8 d/yr, which is significantly higher than previously reported trends.\n\nAntartic sea ice, 1973 - 1976: Satellite passive-microwave observations\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nZwally, H. J.; Comiso, J. C.; Parkinson, C. L.; Campbell, W. J.; Carsey, F. D.; Gloersen, P.\n\n1983-01-01\n\nData from the Electrically Scanning Microwave Radiometer (ESMR) on the Nimbus 5 satellite are used to determine the extent and distribution of Antarctic sea ice. The characteristics of the southern ocean, the mathematical formulas used to obtain quantitative sea ice concentrations, the general characteristics of the seasonal sea ice growth/decay cycle and regional differences, and the observed seasonal growth/decay cycle for individual years and interannual variations of the ice cover are discussed. The sea ice data from the ESMR are presented in the form of color-coded maps of the Antarctic and the southern oceans. The maps show brightness temperatures and concentrations of pack ice averaged for each month, 4-year monthly averages, and month-to-month changes. Graphs summarizing the results, such as areas of sea ice as a function of time in the various sectors of the southern ocean are included. The images demonstrate that satellite microwave data provide unique information on large-scale sea ice conditions for determining climatic conditions in polar regions and possible global climatic changes.\n\nWind, current and swell influences on the ice extent and flux in the Grand Banks-Labrador sea area as observed in the LIMEX '87 experiment\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nArgus, Susan Digby; Carsey, Frank; Holt, Benjamin\n\n1988-01-01\n\nThis paper presents data collected by airborne and satellite instruments during the Labrador Ice Margin Experiment, that demonstrate the effects of oceanic and atmospheric processes on the ice conditions in the Grand Banks-Labrador sea area. Special consideration is given to the development of algorithms for extracting information from SAR data. It is shown that SAR data can be used to monitor ice extent, determine ice motion, locate shear zones, monitor the penetration of swell into the ice, estimate floe sizes, and establish the dimensions of the ice velocity zones. It is also shown that the complex interaction of the ice cover with winds, currents, swell, and coastlines is similar to the dynamics established for a number of sites in both polar regions.\n\nThe Impact of Stratospheric Circulation Extremes on Minimum Arctic Sea Ice Extent\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSmith, K. L.; Polvani, L. M.; Tremblay, B.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nThe interannual variability of summertime Arctic sea ice extent (SIE) is anti-correlated with the leading mode of extratropical atmospheric variability in preceding winter, the Arctic Oscillation (AO). Given this relationship and the need for better seasonal predictions of Arctic SIE, we here examine the role of stratospheric circulation extremes and stratosphere-troposphere coupling in linking the AO and Arctic SIE variability. We show that extremes in the stratospheric circulation during the winter season, namely stratospheric sudden warming (SSW) and strong polar vortex (SPV) events, are associated with significant anomalies in sea ice concentration in the Bering Straight and the Sea of Okhotsk in winter, the Barents Sea in spring and along the Eurasian coastline in summer in both observations and a fully-coupled, stratosphere-resolving general circulation model. The accompanying figure shows the composite mean sea ice concentration anomalies from the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM) for SSWs (N = 126, top row) and SPVs (N = 99, bottom row) for winter (a,d), spring (b,e) and summer (c,f). Consistent with previous work on the AO, we find that SSWs, which are followed by the negative phase of the AO at the surface, result in sea ice growth, whereas SPVs, which are followed by the positive phase of the AO at the surface, result in sea ice loss, although the dynamic and thermodynamic processes driving these sea ice anomalies in the three Arctic regions, noted above, are different. Our analysis suggests that the presence or absence of stratospheric circulation extremes in winter may play a non-trivial role in determining total September Arctic SIE when combined with other factors.\n\nContribution of Increasing Glacial Freshwater Fluxes to Observed Trends in Antarctic Sea Ice\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLe Sommer, J.; Merino, N.; Durand, G.; Jourdain, N.; Goosse, H.; Mathiot, P.; Gurvan, M.\n\n2016-02-01\n\nSouthern Ocean sea-ice extent has experienced an overall positive trend over recent decades. While the amplitude of this trend is open to debate, the geographical pattern of regional changes has been clearly identified by observations. Mechanisms driving changes in the Antarctic Sea Ice Extent (SIE) are not fully understood and climate models fail to simulate these trends. Changes in different atmospheric features such as SAM or ENSO seem to explain the observed trend of Antartic sea ice, but only partly, since they can not account for the actual amplitude of the observed signal. The increasing injection of freshwater due to the accelerating ice discharge from Antarctica Ice Sheet (AIS) during the last two decades has been proposed as another candidate to contribute to SIE trend. However, the quantity and the distribution of the extra freshwater injection were not properly constrained. Recent glaciological estimations may improve the way the glacial freshwater is injected in the model. Here, we study the role of the glacial freshwater into the observed SIE trend, using the state-of-the-art Antarctic mass loss estimations. Ocean/sea-ice model simulations have been carried out with two different Antarctic freshwater scenarios corresponding to 20-years of Antarctic Ice Sheet evolution. The combination of an improved iceberg model with the most recent glaciological estimations has been applied to account for the most realistic possible Antarctic freshwater evolution scenarios. Results suggest that Antarctica has contributed to almost a 30% of the observed trend in regions of the South Pacific and South East Indian sectors, but has little impact in the South Atlantic sector. We conclude that the observed SIE trend over the last decades is due to a combination of both an atmospheric forcing and the extra freshwater injection. Our results advocates that the evolution of glacial freshwater needs to be correctly represented in climate models.\n\nAssessing the Extent of Influence Subglacial Hydrology Has on Dynamic Ice Sheet Behavior\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBabonis, G. S.; Csatho, B. M.\n\n2012-12-01\n\nNumerous recent studies have done an excellent job capturing and quantifying the complex pattern of dynamic changes of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) over the past several decades. The timing of changes in ice velocities and mass balance indicate that the mechanisms controlling these behaviors, both external and internal, act over variable spatial and temporal regimes, can change in rapid and complex fashion, and have significant effect on ice sheet behavior as well as sea level rise. With roughly half of the estimated ice loss from the GrIS attributed to dynamic processes, these changes account for about 250 Gt/yr (2003-2008), equivalence to 0.6 mm/yr sea level rise. One of the primary influences of dynamic ice behavior is ice sheet hydrology, including the storage and transport of water from the supraglacial to subglacial environment, and the subsequent development of water transport pathways, thus demonstrating the need for further characterization of the subglacial environment. Enhanced dynamic flow of ice due to the influence of meltwater distribution on the subglacial environment has been reported, including In-SAR observations of large velocity increases over short periods of time, suggesting regions where dynamic changes are likely being caused by changes in hydrology. Additionally, building upon the 1993-2011 laser altimetry record, analyzed by our Surface Elevation Reconstruction And Change detection (SERAC) procedure, we have detected complex patterns of rapid thickening and thinning patterns over several outlet glaciers. This study presents a comprehensive investigation of hydrologic control on dynamic glacier behavior for several key sites in Greenland. We combine a high resolution surface digital elevation model (DEM) derived by fusing space- and airborne laser altimetry observations and SPIRIT SPOT DEMs, with a high resolution, hydrologically-corrected bedrock DEM derived from a combination of CResIS and Operation Icebridge ice penetrating radar data\n\n2015 Arctic Sea Ice Maximum Annual Extent Is Lowest On Record\n\nNASA Image and Video Library\n\n2015-03-19\n\nThe sea ice cap of the Arctic appeared to reach its annual maximum winter extent on Feb. 25, according to data from the NASA-supported National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) at the University of Colorado, Boulder.

We show that two distinct processes contributed to this event: First, the extreme El NiÃ±o event peaking in December-February 2015/2016 contributed to pronounced extratropical SH sea surface temperature and sea ice extent anomalies in the eastern Ross, Amundsen, and Bellingshausen Seas that persisted in part until the following 2016 austral spring. Second, internal unforced atmospheric variability of the Southern Annular Mode promoted the exceptional low sea ice extent in November-December 2016. These results suggest that a combination of tropically forced and internal SH atmospheric variability contributed to the unprecedented sea ice decline during the 2016 austral spring, on top of a background of slow changes expected from greenhouse gas and ozone forcing.\n\nA 21-Year Record of Arctic Sea Ice Extents and Their Regional, Seasonal, and Monthly Variability and Trends\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nParkinson, Claire L.; Cavalieri, Donald J.; Zukor, Dorothy J. (Technical Monitor)\n\n2001-01-01\n\nSatellite passive-microwave data have been used to calculate sea ice extents over the period 1979-1999 for the north polar sea ice cover as a whole and for each of nine regions. Over this 21-year time period, the trend in yearly average ice extents for the ice cover as a whole is -32,900 +/- 6,100 sq km/yr (-2.7 +/- 0.5 %/decade), indicating a reduction in sea ice coverage that has decelerated from the earlier reported value of -34,000 +/- 8,300 sq km/yr (-2.8 +/- 0.7 %/decade) for the period 1979-1996. Regionally, the reductions are greatest in the Arctic Ocean, the Kara and Barents Seas, and the Seas of Okhotsk and Japan, whereas seasonally, the reductions are greatest in summer, for which season the 1979-1999 trend in ice extents is -41,600 +/- 12,900 sq km/ yr (-4.9 +/- 1.5 %/decade). On a monthly basis, the reductions are greatest in July and September for the north polar ice cover as a whole, in September for the Arctic Ocean, in June and July for the Kara and Barents Seas, and in April for the Seas of Okhotsk and Japan. Only two of the nine regions show overall ice extent increases, those being the Bering Sea and the Gulf of St. Lawrence.For neither of these two regions is the increase statistically significant, whereas the 1079 - 1999 ice extent decreases are statistically significant at the 99% confidence level for the north polar region as a whole, the Arctic Ocean, the Seas of Okhotsk and Japan, and Hudson Bay.\n\nCritical Mechanisms for the Formation of Extreme Arctic Sea-Ice Extent in the Summers of 2007 and 1996\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nDong, Xiquan; Zib, Benjamin J.; Xi, Baike\n\nA warming Arctic climate is undergoing significant e 21 nvironmental change, most evidenced by the reduction of Arctic sea-ice extent during the summer. In this study, we examine two extreme anomalies of September sea-ice extent in 2007 and 1996, and investigate the impacts of cloud fraction (CF), atmospheric precipitable water vapor (PWV), downwelling longwave flux (DLF), surface air temperature (SAT), pressure and winds on the sea-ice variation in 2007 and 1996 using both satellite-derived sea-ice products and MERRA reanalysis. The area of the Laptev, East Siberian and West Chukchi seas (70-90oN, 90-180oE) has experienced the largest variation in sea-ice extentmoreÂ Â» from year-to-year and defined here as the Area Of Focus (AOF). The record low September sea-ice extent in 2007 was associated with positive anomalies 30 of CF, PWV, DLF, and SAT over the AOF. Persistent anti-cyclone positioned over the Beaufort Sea coupled with low pressure over Eurasia induced easterly zonal and southerly meridional winds. In contrast, negative CF, PWV, DLF and SAT anomalies, as well as opposite wind patterns to those in 2007, characterized the 1996 high September sea-ice extent. Through this study, we hypothesize the following positive feedbacks of clouds, water vapor, radiation and atmospheric variables on the sea-ice retreat during the summer 2007. The record low sea-ice extent during the summer 2007 is initially triggered by the atmospheric circulation anomaly. The southerly winds across the Chukchi and East Siberian seas transport warm, moist air from the north Pacific, which is not only enhancing sea-ice melt across the AOF, but also increasing clouds. The positive cloud feedback results in higher SAT and more sea-ice melt. Therefore, 40 more water vapor could be evaporated from open seas and higher SAT to form more clouds, which will enhance positive cloud feedback. This enhanced positive cloud feedback will then further increase SAT and accelerate the sea-ice retreat\n\nIntegrating Observations and Models to Better Understand a Changing Arctic Sea Ice Cover\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nStroeve, J. C.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nTThe loss of the Arctic sea ice cover has captured the world's attention. While much attention has been paid to the summer ice loss, changes are not limited to summer. The last few winters have seen record low sea ice extents, with 2017 marking the 3rdyear in a row with a new record low for the winter maximum extent. More surprising is the number of consecutive months between January 2016 through April 2017 with ice extent anomalies more than 2 standard deviations below the 1981-2010 mean. Additionally, October 2016 through April 2017 saw 7 consecutive months with record low extents, something that had not happened before in the last 4 decades of satellite observations. As larger parts of the Arctic Ocean become ice-free in summer, regional seas gradually transition from a perennial to a seasonal ice cover. The Barents Sea is already only seasonally ice covered, whereas the Kara Sea has recently lost most of its summer ice and is thereby starting to become a seasonally ice covered region. These changes serve as harbinger for what's to come for other Arctic seas. Given the rapid pace of change, there is an urgent need to improve our understanding of the drivers behind Arctic sea ice loss, the implications of this ice loss and to predict future changes to better inform policy makers. Climate models play a fundamental role in helping us synthesize the complex elements of the Arctic sea ice system yet generally fail to simulate key features of the sea ice system and the pace of sea ice loss. Nevertheless, modeling advances continue to provide better means of diagnosing sea ice change, and new insights are likely to be gained with model output from the 6th phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). The CMIP6 Sea-Ice Model Intercomparison Project (SIMIP) aim is to better understand biases and errors in sea ice simulations so that we can improve our understanding of the likely future evolution of the sea ice cover and its impacts on global climate. To\n\nVariability of Arctic Sea Ice as Determined from Satellite Observations\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nParkinson, Claire L.\n\n1999-01-01\n\nThe compiled, quality-controlled satellite multichannel passive-microwave record of polar sea ice now spans over 18 years, from November 1978 through December 1996, and is revealing considerable information about the Arctic sea ice cover and its variability. The information includes data on ice concentrations (percent areal coverages of ice), ice extents, ice melt, ice velocities, the seasonal cycle of the ice, the interannual variability of the ice, the frequency of ice coverage, and the length of the sea ice season. The data reveal marked regional and interannual variabilities, as well as some statistically significant trends. For the north polar ice cover as a whole, maximum ice extents varied over a range of 14,700,000 - 15,900,000 sq km, while individual regions experienced much greater percent variations, for instance, with the Greenland Sea having a range of 740,000 - 1,110,000 sq km in its yearly maximum ice coverage. In spite of the large variations from year to year and region to region, overall the Arctic ice extents showed a statistically significant, 2.80% / decade negative trend over the 18.2-year period. Ice season lengths, which vary from only a few weeks near the ice margins to the full year in the large region of perennial ice coverage, also experienced interannual variability, along with spatially coherent overall trends. Linear least squares trends show the sea ice season to have lengthened in much of the Bering Sea, Baffin Bay, the Davis Strait, and the Labrador Sea, but to have shortened over a much larger area, including the Sea of Okhotsk, the Greenland Sea, the Barents Sea, and the southeastern Arctic.\n\nAdditional Arctic observations improve weather and sea-ice forecasts for the Northern Sea Route\n\nPubMed Central\n\nInoue, Jun; Yamazaki, Akira; Ono, Jun; Dethloff, Klaus; Maturilli, Marion; Neuber, Roland; Edwards, Patti; Yamaguchi, Hajime\n\n2015-01-01\n\nDuring ice-free periods, the Northern Sea Route (NSR) could be an attractive shipping route. The decline in Arctic sea-ice extent, however, could be associated with an increase in the frequency of the causes of severe weather phenomena, and high wind-driven waves and the advection of sea ice could make ship navigation along the NSR difficult. Accurate forecasts of weather and sea ice are desirable for safe navigation, but large uncertainties exist in current forecasts, partly owing to the sparse observational network over the Arctic Ocean. Here, we show that the incorporation of additional Arctic observations improves the initial analysis and enhances the skill of weather and sea-ice forecasts, the application of which has socioeconomic benefits. Comparison of 63-member ensemble atmospheric forecasts, using different initial data sets, revealed that additional Arctic radiosonde observations were useful for predicting a persistent strong wind event. The sea-ice forecast, initialised by the wind fields that included the effects of the observations, skilfully predicted rapid wind-driven sea-ice advection along the NSR.

H.; Niessen, F.; Fahl, K.; Forwick, M.; Kudriavtseva, A.; Ponomarenko, E.; Prim, A. K.; Quatmann-Hense, A.; Spielhagen, R. F.; Zou, H.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nThe Arctic Ocean and surrounding continents are key areas within the Earth system and very sensitive to present and past climate change. In this context, the timing and extent of circum-Arctic ice sheets and its interaction with oceanic and sea-ice dynamics are major interest and focus of international research. New sediment cores recovered during the Polarstern Expeditions PS87 (Lomonosov Ridge/2014) and PS93.1 (Fram Strait/2015) together with several sediment cores available from previous Polarstern expeditions allow to carry out a detailed sedimentological and geochemical study that may help to unravel the changes in Arctic sea ice and circum-Arctic ice sheets during late Quaternary times. Our new data include biomarkers indicative for past sea-ice extent, phytoplankton productivity and terrigenous input as well as grain size, physical property, XRD and XRF data indicative for sources and pathways of terrigenous sediments (ice-rafted debris/IRD) related to glaciations in Eurasia, East Siberia, Canada and Greenland. Here, we present examples from selected sediment cores that give new insights into the timing and extent of sea ice and glaciations during MIS 6 to MIS 2. To highlight one example: SE-NW oriented, streamlined landforms have been mapped on top of the southern Lomonosov Ridge (LR) at water depths between 800 and 1000 m over long distances during Polarstern Expedition PS87, interpreted to be glacial lineations that formed beneath grounded ice sheets and ice streams. The orientations of the lineations identified are similar to those on the East Siberian continental margin, suggesting an East Siberian Chukchi Ice Sheet extended far to the north on LR during times of extreme Quaternary glaciations. Based on our new biomarker records from Core PS2757 (located on LR near 81Â°N) indicating a MIS 6 ice-edge situation with some open-water phytoplankton productivity, the glacial erosional event should have been older than MIS 6 (e.g., MIS 12?).\n\nStatistical Analysis of SSMIS Sea Ice Concentration Threshold at the Arctic Sea Ice Edge during Summer Based on MODIS and Ship-Based Observational Data.\n\nPubMed\n\nJi, Qing; Li, Fei; Pang, Xiaoping; Luo, Cong\n\n2018-04-05\n\nThe threshold of sea ice concentration (SIC) is the basis for accurately calculating sea ice extent based on passive microwave (PM) remote sensing data. However, the PM SIC threshold at the sea ice edge used in previous studies and released sea ice products has not always been consistent. To explore the representable value of the PM SIC threshold corresponding on average to the position of the Arctic sea ice edge during summer in recent years, we extracted sea ice edge boundaries from the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sea ice product (MOD29 with a spatial resolution of 1 km), MODIS images (250 m), and sea ice ship-based observation points (1 km) during the fifth (CHINARE-2012) and sixth (CHINARE-2014) Chinese National Arctic Research Expeditions, and made an overlay and comparison analysis with PM SIC derived from Special Sensor Microwave Imager Sounder (SSMIS, with a spatial resolution of 25 km) in the summer of 2012 and 2014. Results showed that the average SSMIS SIC threshold at the Arctic sea ice edge based on ice-water boundary lines extracted from MOD29 was 33%, which was higher than that of the commonly used 15% discriminant threshold. The average SIC threshold at sea ice edge based on ice-water boundary lines extracted by visual interpretation from four scenes of the MODIS image was 35% when compared to the average value of 36% from the MOD29 extracted ice edge pixels for the same days. The average SIC of 31% at the sea ice edge points extracted from ship-based observations also confirmed that choosing around 30% as the SIC threshold during summer is recommended for sea ice extent calculations based on SSMIS PM data. These results can provide a reference for further studying the variation of sea ice under the rapidly changing Arctic.\n\nHolocene sea surface temperature and sea ice extent in the Okhotsk and Bering Seas\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nHarada, Naomi; Katsuki, Kota; Nakagawa, Mitsuhiro; Matsumoto, Akiko; Seki, Osamu; Addison, Jason A.; Finney, Bruce P.; Sato, Miyako\n\n2014-01-01\n\nAccurate prediction of future climate requires an understanding of the mechanisms of the Holocene climate; however, the driving forces, mechanisms, and processes of climate change in the Holocene associated with different time scales remain unclear.
