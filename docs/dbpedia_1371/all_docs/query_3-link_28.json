In this disease, it is well appreciated that macrophages are immunosuppressive and contribute to the poor response to immunotherapy; however, the mechanisms of immune suppression are complex and not fully understood. Immunosuppressive macrophages are classically defined by the expression of the enzyme Arginase 1 (ARG1), which we demonstrated is potently expressed in pancreatic tumor-associated macrophages from both human patients and mouse models. While routinely used as a polarization marker, ARG1 also catabolizes arginine, an amino acid required for T cell activation and proliferation. To investigate this metabolic function, we used a genetic and a pharmacologic approach to target Arg1 in pancreatic cancer. Genetic inactivation of Arg1 in macrophages, using a dual recombinase genetically engineered mouse model of pancreatic cancer, delayed formation of invasive disease, while increasing CD8+ T cell infiltration. Additionally, Arg1 deletion induced compensatory mechanisms, including Arg1 overexpression in epithelial cells, namely Tuft cells, and Arg2 overexpression in a subset of macrophages. To overcome these compensatory mechanisms, we used a pharmacological approach to inhibit arginase. Treatment of established tumors with the arginase inhibitor CB-1158 exhibited further increased CD8+ T cell infiltration, beyond that seen with the macrophage-specific knockout, and sensitized the tumors to anti-PD1 immune checkpoint blockade. Our data demonstrate that Arg1 drives immune suppression in pancreatic cancer by depleting arginine and inhibiting T cell activation.\n\nResearch organism: Human, Mouse\n\nIntroduction\n\nPancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is currently the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States with a 5-y survival rate of 12% (Siegel et al., 2023). This poor survival rate is due to late detection and ineffective treatments. The hallmark mutation in PDA is found in the KRAS gene, most commonly KRASG12D (Hezel et al., 2006; Hingorani et al., 2003; Hingorani et al., 2005; Schneider and Schmid, 2003), whereas disease progression is accelerated by loss of tumor suppressor genes, including TP53, SMAD4, and INK4A (Hezel et al., 2006; Maitra and Hruban, 2008).\n\nStandard of care for PDA is a combination of systemic chemotherapy that includes FOLFIRINOX or gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel (Mizrahi et al., 2020), which provides limited improvement in patient survival. Oncogenic KRAS proteins were long thought to be ‘undruggable’ (Gysin et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2019). Recently, new approaches to drug discovery have led to the development of KRASG12C inhibitors (Canon et al., 2019; Fell et al., 2020), a common mutation in non-small cell lung cancer (Prior et al., 2012); initial clinical data show not only dramatic responses but also cases of primary or secondary resistance (Awad et al., 2021). While the applicability of G12C inhibitors is limited in PDA, which is rarely present with this specific allele (Witkiewicz et al., 2015), new KRASG12D inhibitors have recently been described and are entering the clinic (Hallin et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022). Based on the observations in lung cancer (Awad et al., 2021; Zhao et al., 2021) and on predictions based on mouse models that allow genetic inactivation of oncogenic KRAS (Collins et al., 2012; Ying et al., 2012), it is to be expected that resistance to KRAS G12D inhibitors will similarly arise; activation of anti-tumor immune responses remains our best hope for long-term tumor control. Although immune checkpoint inhibitors are effective in other cancers, this benefit has not translated to PDA (Brahmer et al., 2012; Royal et al., 2010) due to the severely immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) that characterizes this disease (Morrison et al., 2018; Vonderheide and Bayne, 2013). Approaches combining immune checkpoints and myeloid cell targeting might be more promising, based on preclinical studies (DeNardo et al., 2021; Gulhati et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2021). Here, we explore new approaches targeting macrophages to induce anti-tumor immunity in pancreatic cancer.\n\nThe pancreatic TME includes cancer-associated fibroblasts and a heterogenous population of immune cells, the majority of which is myeloid cells (Gabrilovich and Nagaraj, 2009). These myeloid cells include tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), immature myeloid cells, also referred to as myeloid-derived suppressor cells, and granulocytes, such as neutrophils (Gabrilovich et al., 2012). In contrast, CD8+ T cells are rare in the pancreatic TME, although their prevalence is heterogeneous in different patients (Stromnes et al., 2017). Single-cell RNA sequencing (sc-RNA-seq) analysis revealed that most CD8+ T cells infiltrating PDA have an exhausted phenotype (Steele et al., 2020). An understanding of the mechanisms mediating immune suppression in pancreatic cancer is needed to design new therapeutic approaches for this disease. Of note, analysis of long-term survivors revealed persistence of tumor-specific memory CD8+ T cells, indicating that when an anti-tumor immune response does occur, it leads to effective tumor control (Balachandran et al., 2017). Conversely, evidence of loss of antigens over time due to immunoediting has also been described (Łuksza et al., 2022). Furthermore, myeloid cell depletion in mouse models of pancreatic cancer led to activation of anti-tumor T cell responses (Mitchem et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2017a), spurring an effort to target myeloid cells in pancreatic cancer (Nywening et al., 2016); yet, clinical efficacy has been low, and more effective approaches are needed.\n\nMyeloid cells infiltrating the neoplastic pancreas, and ultimately those in PDA, express high levels of Arginase 1 (Arg1). ARG1 is one of the enzymes that metabolize arginine, and it is prevalently located in the cytoplasm, while the ARG2 isoform is prevalently mitochondrial (Bronte and Zanovello, 2005). Indeed, we previously showed that Arg1 expression in myeloid cells is driven by oncogenic Kras expression/signaling in epithelial cells, starting during early stages of carcinogenesis (Velez-Delgado et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2017b). Beyond our work, ARG1 is widely appreciated as a marker of alternatively polarized macrophages. An increase in tumor myeloid Arg1 expression has been reported in other cancers, including renal cell carcinoma (Rodriguez et al., 2009), breast (Polat et al., 2003; Singh et al., 2000), colon (Arlauckas et al., 2018), and lung cancer (Miret et al., 2019).\n\nIn addition to its role as a marker of alternatively polarized macrophages, ARG1 is a metabolic enzyme that breaks down the amino acid L-arginine to urea and ornithine (Jenkinson et al., 1996). Connecting this activity to myeloid Arg1 expression, several reports detail how arginine is necessary for the activation and proliferation of CD8 T cells (Rodriguez et al., 2007; Rodriguez et al., 2004). This indicates that myeloid cells may deplete arginine in the TME to dampen anti-tumor T cell activity. Based on these concepts, a small-molecule arginase inhibitor, CB-1158 (INCB001158) (Calithera Biosciences, Inc, South San Francisco, CA), was developed. CB-1158 treatment as monotherapy, or in combination with anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor, decreased tumor growth in vivo in mice with Lewis lung carcinoma (Steggerda et al., 2017). CB-1158 also inhibits human arginase, and it is being tested in a phase I clinical trial in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors (Pham et al., 2018; Steggerda et al., 2017).\n\nEncouraged by these studies and the prominent disease-specific expression of Arg1 in PDA macrophages, we set forth to determine its functional role. Here, we used a dual-recombinase approach to delete Arg1 in myeloid cell lineages via Cre-loxP technology and at the same time induced oncogenic Kras in pancreatic epithelial cells using the orthogonal Flp-Frt recombination approach. We discovered that Arg1 deletion in myeloid cells profoundly reshaped the TME, increased the infiltration of CD8+ T cells, and reduced malignant disease progression. However, we also noticed a resistance mechanism whereby other cells in the TME, such as epithelial cells, upregulate Arg1 expression, potentially blunting the effect of its inactivation in myeloid cells. We thus employed a systemic approach, whereby we treated a syngeneic orthotopic model of pancreatic cancer with the arginase inhibitor CB-1158 and found it to sensitize PDA to anti-PD1 immune checkpoint blockade. These results illustrate a functional role of Arg1 in pancreatic tumor-derived myeloid cells, reveal novel aspects of intratumoral compensatory metabolism, and provide new inroads to increase the efficacy of checkpoint immune therapy for PDA.\n\nResults\n\nPancreatic cancer infiltrating myeloid cells express Arginase 1\n\nWe have previously reported that expression of oncogenic Kras in pancreas epithelial cells drives expression of Arg1 in macrophages in vivo during early stages of carcinogenesis (Velez-Delgado et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2017b). We sought to determine whether Arg1 was also associated with late stages of carcinogenesis in mouse and human tumors. As there was no validated antibody for human ARG1 available, we performed ARG1 RNA in situ hybridization in human PDA, together with co-immunofluorescence staining for the immune cell marker CD45 and for the epithelial cell marker E-cadherin (ECAD) ( ). We observed prevalent ARG1 expression in CD45+ cells, and occasional low expression in ECAD+ cells ( , ). Analysis of a previously published sc-RNA-seq dataset, which includes 16 human PDA samples (Steele et al., 2020; and ), revealed highest expression of ARG1 in myeloid cells ( , ). In contrast, we observed minimal ARG1 expression in CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, epithelial cells, and fibroblasts ( ). ARG2 was expressed at high levels in endocrine cells, and at lower, but detectable levels in epithelial cells ( ). Thus, we conclude that myeloid cells are the main source of ARG1 in the pancreatic cancer microenvironment.\n\nFigure 1—figure supplement 1.\n\nInfiltration of myeloid cells, specifically macrophages, in pancreatic cancer portends worse patient survival (Sanford et al., 2013; Tsujikawa et al., 2017). We thus assessed whether ARG1 expression correlated with worse patient outcomes. Based on a publicly available human PDA microarray data set (GSE71729) (Moffitt et al., 2015), we found that high ARG1 expression in pancreatic cancer correlated with worse survival ( ), suggesting that ARG1 in myeloid cells may play a functional role in human PDA.\n\nNext, to determine whether the increase in Arg1 expression was recapitulated in a mouse model of pancreatic cancer, we analyzed our mouse sc-RNA-seq data from healthy mice and tumor-bearing KPC (KrasLSL-G12D/+;p53LSL-R172H/+;Ptf1aCre/+) (Hingorani et al., 2005) mice ( and ). We detected the highest level of Arg1 expression in macrophages ( and ). Importantly, Arg1 expression was enriched in PDA infiltrating macrophages compared to macrophages in the normal pancreas ( and ). Other cell types, such as epithelial cells and fibroblasts, only had sporadic Arg1 expression. Arg2 was also expressed in macrophages, albeit at low levels, and was the prevalent isoform in tumor-associated granulocytes ( ). To evaluate the protein expression of ARG1, we performed co-immunofluorescence staining. We included healthy pancreas samples, PanIN-bearing pancreata from KC mice (KrasLSL-G12D/+;Ptf1aCre/+) (Hingorani et al., 2003), and PDA. We did not detect ARG1 protein in the healthy pancreas. In contrast, both PanIN and PDA presented with frequent co-localization of the macrophage marker F4/80 with ARG1, consistent with prevalent expression in this cell population ( and ). Consistent with human data, expression of ARG1 in other cell types was rare ( and ). Thus, both in mouse and human pancreatic cancer, ARG1 is highly expressed and largely confined to tumors, where it is predominantly expressed in macrophages.\n\nArginase 1 deletion in myeloid cells reduces tumor progression and induces macrophage repolarization\n\nTo examine the function of myeloid Arg1 in PDA, we generated mice lacking Arg1 expression in myeloid cells. Specifically, we crossed Arg1f/f mice with Lyz2Cre/+ mice to generate Lyz2Cre/+;Arg1f/f mice (El Kasmi et al., 2008). Lyz2Cre/+ mice were generated by inserting the Cre cDNA in the endogenous M lysozyme (LysM) locus (Clausen et al., 1999), which is broadly expressed in myeloid cells, including macrophages and neutrophils (Clausen et al., 1999; El Kasmi et al., 2008). To validate the deletion of Arg1 in macrophages, we harvested bone marrow (BM) cells from wild type (WT) or Lyz2Cre/+;Arg1f/f mice and cultured these directly in pancreatic cancer cell conditioned media (CM) for 6 d. This protocol yields BM-derived TAMs ( ), as previously described (Zhang et al., 2017a). ARG1 expression was readily detectable in WT TAMs; in contrast, Lyz2Cre/+;Arg1f/f TAMs had none or very low ARG1 protein, indicating efficient Cre recombination ( ). We then sought to determine whether ARG1 expression in TAMs affected the metabolite composition of the media. We thus performed extracellular metabolomics by liquid chromatography couple tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and observed elevated levels of L-Arginine in the Lyz2Cre/+;Arg1f/f TAM medium compared with WT TAM medium ( ). This finding is consistent with WT TAMs depleting arginine from their growth medium at an enhanced rate, relative to TAMs lacking Arg1 expression.\n\nFigure 2—figure supplement 1.\n\nFigure 2—figure supplement 2.\n\nFigure 2—figure supplement 3.\n\nTo investigate the function of Arg1 in myeloid cells during PDA progression, we generated KrasFrt-STOP-Frt-G12D/+;Ptf1aFlpO/+ (KF); Lyz2Cre/+;Arg1f/f mice, hereafter referred to as KFCA ( and ). The dual-recombinase system integrates both Flippase-FRT (Flp-FRT) and Cre-loxP recombination technologies to independently modify epithelial cells and myeloid cells (Garcia et al., 2020; Wen et al., 2019). We aged a cohort of KF and KFCA mice for 2 mo, a timepoint at which PanIN lesions are formed in KF mice ( ). To evaluate the efficiency of Arg1 deletion, we performed co-immunofluorescent staining for ARG1, F4/80, and CK19. As expected, we observed abundant expression of ARG1 in F4/80+ macrophages in KF, and minimal to no expression of ARG1 in macrophages from KFCA tissue ( ). We then performed histopathological evaluation of the tissue to determine the functional effect of loss of myeloid Arg1. Here, we observed a trending decrease in ADM and PanIN lesions (although not statistically significant), accompanied by a reduction of desmoplastic stroma in KFCA, compared to age-matched KF pancreata ( ).\n\nTo investigate the causes underlying the trending reduction in PanIN formation, we performed an in-depth histological analysis. We previously showed that macrophages can directly promote epithelial cell proliferation during early stages in carcinogenesis (Zhang et al., 2017b). We and others have also demonstrated that macrophages also indirectly promote carcinogenesis by suppressing CD8+ T cell infiltration and activation (Bayne et al., 2012; Mitchem et al., 2013; Pylayeva-Gupta et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2017a; Zhu et al., 2017). Immunostaining for the proliferation marker Ki67 revealed a reduction in total cell proliferation, and a reduction in cell death as determined by cleaved caspase-3 (CC3) staining ( ). Immunofluorescence staining for immune cells by CD45 did not reveal changes in total CD45+ cells ( ). Similarly, we did not find changes in infiltrating F4/80+ macrophages or CD8+ T cells by immunohistochemistry staining ( ). Thus, loss of Arg1 in macrophages appears to reduce the ability of macrophages to promote proliferation but, at this stage, does not appear to correlate with changes in the immune system. These findings are consistent with our previous observations on the role of macrophages during the onset of carcinogenesis (Zhang et al., 2017b).\n\nGiven the trending reduction in PanIN formation, we next investigated the effects of myeloid Arg1 deletion on progression to PDA. For this purpose, we aged KF and KFCA mice to 9–16 mo ( ), an age where we have previously observed invasive cancer formation in KF mice (Garcia et al., 2020). Accordingly, 16 out of 26 KF mice (62%) had invasive disease; in contrast, only 5 out of 24 KFCA mice had progressed (21%) ( ). We then stained the tissue for ARG1 together with F4/80, and CK19. As expected, we observed high ARG1 expression in macrophages in KF tissues and little to no ARG1 expression in macrophages in KFCA pancreata ( ). Surprisingly, we observed substantial ARG1 expression in epithelial cells from the KFCA pancreata, while epithelial cells in KF mice had little to no ARG1 expression ( and ). So, while deletion of Arg1 in myeloid cells impairs malignant progression, it unleashes a compensatory upregulation of Arg1 in epithelial cells.\n\nWe noted that the epithelia that expressed ARG1 in KFCA mice had an elongated appearance, consistent with tuft cells, a cell type that is not present in the healthy pancreas but common in low-grade PanINs (Delgiorno et al., 2014). By co-immunostaining for the tuft cell marker COX1, we confirmed that tuft cells are the exclusive source of epithelial ARG1 in these samples ( ), suggesting a tuft cell response to accumulating arginine in the microenvironment.\n\nTo comprehensively characterize the phenotype of myeloid Arg1 deleted mice, we performed sc-RNA-seq on KF (n=1) and KFCA (n=1) pancreata dissected from 11 mo old mice. Unsupervised clustering identified abundant stromal and immune cells, and a small population of epithelial cells, in both genotypes ( and ). The percentage of total macrophages was similar between KF and KFCA pancreas ( , ). We then subclustered the macrophages, from which we identified five different macrophage populations based on distinct gene profiles ( and ). The macrophage 1 population was defined by Apoe, C1qa, and C1qc markers of TAMs in mouse and human pancreatic cancer (Kemp et al., 2021a), while the macrophage 5 population expressed Ear2 and Retnla ( ). Since macrophage APOE (Apolipoprotein E) is tumor promoting (Kemp et al., 2021a), we performed co-immunofluorescent staining for APOE, F4/80, and ECAD and detected a reduction in APOE expression ( ). scRNA-seq identified Apoe expression mainly in the KF macrophage 1 population with reduced expression in the KFCA population ( ).\n\nIntriguingly, sc-RNA-seq revealed that deletion of Arg1 in myeloid cells led to an upregulation of Arg2 expression, mainly in the macrophage 4 population expressing Chil3, Ly6c2, and Clec4e genes ( ), suggesting the existence of a compensatory mechanism. We then performed reactome pathway enrichment analysis on the macrophage sc-RNA-seq data to determine both up- and down-regulated pathways ( and ). Interestingly, KFCA macrophages, mainly the macrophage 3 population, exhibited upregulation of signaling pathways involved in MHC I antigen processing and cross presentation ( and ), suggesting an improvement in antigen-specific CD8+ T cell activation upon Arg1 deletion. Among the differentially expressed genes in MHC I-mediated antigen processing and presentation were H2-K1, Psmb8, H2-Q7, Ubb, H2-T23, Psmb9, H2-T22, Uba52, H2-Q6, Mrc1, Rbx1, Psmd8, Psmb5, and Znrf2 ( ).\n\nDeletion of Arginase 1 in myeloid cells increases CD8+ T cell infiltration and activation\n\nMacrophages in pancreatic cancer are highly immunosuppressive and have defective antigen presentation (DeNardo and Ruffell, 2019). As sc-RNA-seq suggested that Arg1 null macrophages have higher antigen presenting activity, we stained KF and KFCA pancreata for CD8 and observed increased CD8+ T cell infiltration in the latter ( ). We then sub-clustered T and natural killer (NK) cells in the sc-RNA-seq datasets from KF and KFCA pancreata and classified these into the following subclusters: naïve CD8+ T cells, cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, exhausted CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, regulatory T cells (Treg), γδ T cells, NKT, and NK cells ( ). From this analysis, we observed an increase in the percentage of both cytotoxic and exhausted CD8+ T cells in the KFCA model compared with KF ( ). Correspondingly, expression of genes related to CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity, including Granzyme b (Gzmb), Perforin 1 (Prfn1), and Interferon gamma (Ifng) was upregulated in CD8+ T cells from the KFCA model ( ). Accordingly, co-immunofluorescent staining for CD8, GZMB, and ECAD showed an increase in GZMB-expressing CD8+ T cells in KFCA pancreata ( and H). We also found that the expression of genes involved in T cell exhaustion such as cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein 4 (Ctla4), Furin, lymphocyte activating 3 (Lag3), and programmed cell death 1 (Pdcd1) was upregulated in the KFCA model, compared with the KF ( ). Taken together, deletion of Arg1 in myeloid cells resulted in an increase in CD8+ T cell infiltration and activation, counterbalanced by an increase in exhaustion as well.\n\nSystemic arginase inhibition in combination with anti-PD1 immune checkpoint reduces tumor growth\n\nOur genetic model revealed that deletion of Arg1 in myeloid cells reduced PanIN/PDA progression and was accompanied by an increased infiltration of CD8+ T cells. However, we also observed several compensatory mechanisms that may have blunted the effect of Arg1 loss. These included expression of Arg2 in myeloid cells and expression of Arg1 in epithelial cells. We reasoned that systemic inhibition of arginase (Steggerda et al., 2017), using a pharmacologic approach might bypass these compensatory mechanisms.\n\nWe implanted a KPC pancreatic cancer cell line (7940B) (Long et al., 2016) orthotopically into the pancreas of syngeneic C57BL6/J mice. Upon tumor detection (by palpation or by ultrasound), we randomly divided the mice into two groups to receive either vehicle or Arginase inhibitor (CB-1158, Calithera Biosciences) ( ). We pharmacologically treated the mice for 10 d and then harvested the tumors 20 d post-implantation. First, we investigated the infiltration of CD8+ T cells by staining the vehicle and CB-1158 mouse tissue for CD8 by immunohistochemistry . Interestingly, we observed that systemic inhibition of Arginase by CB-1158 increased the infiltration of CD8+ T cells ( ), recapitulating our findings from the genetically engineered model. To identify whether there was an increase in CD8+ T cell activation, we stained the tissue samples for CD8 and the activation marker GZMB, as well as the epithelial marker ECAD. While in the control tissue, GZMB expression was rare, in the CB-1158 treatment group, GZMB was common in CD8+ T cells ( ).\n\nFigure 4—figure supplement 1.\n\nFigure 4—figure supplement 2.\n\nData from the genetic model showed an increase in T cell activation but also an increase in exhaustion. We thus repeated the syngeneic orthotopic transplantation experiment described above, but this time we added blockade of the PD1 immune checkpoint to circumvent T cell exhaustion. Tumor bearing mice were divided into four different groups to receive: (1) vehicle + IgG control, (2) arginase inhibitor (CB-1158) + IgG, (3) vehicle + anti-PD1, and (4) CB-1158 + anti-PD1 ( ). We observed a trending decrease in tumor weight in the CB-1158 + IgG group and a significant decrease in tumor weight in the combination group of CB-1158 + anti-PD1 immune checkpoint blockade compared with our vehicle control group ( ). These findings recapitulated the decrease in tumor formation observed in the KFCA mouse model.\n\nWe then proceeded to characterize the tumor tissue. We examined ARG1 expression in macrophages (F4/80+) and epithelial (ECAD+) cells by co-immunofluorescence staining and observed no changes in ARG1 distribution or expression among treatment groups ( ), consistent with the notion that the CB-1158 Arginase inhibitor does not affect enzyme production but suppresses its activity. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining showed large necrotic areas in both CB-1158 and CB-1158 + anti-PD1 groups ( ). To further characterize the tumor tissue, we stained for cell proliferation (Ki67) and apoptotic cell death (CC3) by immunohistochemistry staining ( ). The combination treatment group showed a significant decrease in cell proliferation compared to the vehicle control group ( ). We also observed either a significant or trending increase in CC3 upon CB-1158 + IgG, vehicle + anti-PD1, or the combination treatment ( ). Additionally, metabolomics analysis of these orthotopic tumors revealed an increase in arginine levels in the tumors from mice treated with CB-1158 and anti-PD1 ( ).\n\nArginase breaks down arginine into urea and ornithine. Thus, it is equally conceivable that lack of arginine (Arg) or excess of ornithine (Orn) and/or urea might impair the ability of CD8+ T cells to proliferate and/or become activated. To determine how loss of Arginase increases CD8+ T cell proliferation and activation, we performed an in vitro CD8+ T cell proliferation and activation assay. We isolated naïve CD8+ T cells from spleen and lymph nodes of C57BL/6 mice and cultured them for 72 hr with complete RPMI media or with media lacking arginine (−Arg RPMI). In both media conditions, we added groups where the media was supplemented with either ornithine or urea, or with a combination of both ( ). We found that arginine deprivation results in reduced CD8+ T cell proliferation and activation ( ). Additionally, we found that culturing cells in RPMI media containing urea sightly enhanced CD8+ T cell proliferation and activation, compared to RPMI media control ( , gray bars), while no enhancement was observed with ornithine supplementation.\n\nWhen cells were cultured in RPMI media lacking arginine, supplementation with ornithine, but not urea, partially rescued the proliferation defect caused by lack of arginine. No further rescue occurred adding urea; neither ornithine nor urea rescued the activation defect caused by lack of arginine. We thus concluded that CD8+ T cells require arginine for proliferation and activation, and that the arginine breakdown byproducts are not harmful to CD8+ T cell proliferation nor are they able to fully rescue lack of arginine.\n\nTogether, these findings indicate that Arginase inhibition in combination with anti-PD1 reduces immune suppression and decreases pancreatic cancer tumor growth (see working model in ).\n\nDiscussion\n\nAbundant myeloid cells in the TME are associated with poor prognosis in multiple types of cancer, including PDA (Gentles et al., 2015; Sanford et al., 2013; Tsujikawa et al., 2017). In contrast, high levels of T cells correlate with longer survival (Gentles et al., 2015; Balachandran et al., 2017). We and others have shown that myeloid cells promote pancreatic cancer growth both directly and by inhibiting CD8+ T cell anti-tumor immunity (Zhang et al., 2017b; Zhang et al., 2017a; Mitchem et al., 2013; Halbrook et al., 2019; Steele et al., 2016; Liou et al., 2015). The specific mechanisms by which macrophages drive immune suppression, and how to best target macrophages to improve outcomes in pancreatic cancer remain poorly understood.\n\nMacrophages are plastic cell types, traditionally classified into pro-inflammatory ‘M1’ and anti-inflammatory ‘M2’ subtypes, based on their gene expression pattern (Mantovani et al., 2002). Recently, a wealth of evidence now supports the notion that TAMs are distinct from M1 and M2 (Boyer et al., 2022; DeNardo and Ruffell, 2019; Halbrook et al., 2019). Adding further complexity, TAMs also exhibit heterogeneous populations within an individual tumor. ARG1 is classically considered a ‘marker’ of the anti-inflammatory M2 state. In this study, we show that Arg1 is expressed in human and mouse TAMs, as well as in other myeloid populations. Furthermore, when we stratified human PDA based on ARG1 expression, we found inverse correlations between ARG1 and survival. However, prior to this work, a functional role of Arg1 in pancreatic TAMs and tumor immunity had not been evaluated.\n\nArginases are enzymes that hydrolyze the amino acid L-arginine to urea and L-ornithine in the liver urea cycle (Jenkinson et al., 1996). An analysis of plasma metabolites and tumor interstitial fluid in an autochthonous PDA mouse model revealed that L-arginine was drastically reduced in the tumor interstitial fluid (Sullivan et al., 2019). Additionally, ornithine levels increased in the PDA tumor interstitial fluid compared to plasma (Sullivan et al., 2019), suggesting arginase contribution to immunosuppression through depletion of arginine.\n\nThere are two isoforms of arginase, ARG1 and ARG2, located in the cytoplasm and mitochondria, respectively (Gotoh et al., 1996; Munder et al., 2005). The arginase genes share a 58% sequence identity (Haraguchi et al., 1987) and are almost identical at the catalytic site. Arg1 is normally expressed by hepatocytes, but it is also expressed in TAMs in a variety of tumor types. Arg2 is located in various cell types, including renal cells, neurons, and macrophages (Bronte and Zanovello, 2005; Caldwell et al., 2018). In a mouse model of Lewis lung carcinoma, myeloid cells express high levels of Arg1, resulting in impaired T cell function (Rodriguez et al., 2004). In that study, 3LL tumor cells were implanted subcutaneously in the right flank of the mice, and at the same time, mice were treated with the pan-arginase inhibitor tool compound N-hydroxy-nor-L-Arg. Arginase inhibition reduced subcutaneous tumor growth in a dose-dependent manner. The anti-tumor effect of the arginase inhibitor was in part dependent on T cell function, as inhibition on tumor growth was not observed when mice lacking a functional immune system were treated with the arginase inhibitor (Rodriguez et al., 2004). In another study (Miret et al., 2019), inhibition of arginase activity by the arginase inhibitor tool compound Cpd9 (Van Zandt et al., 2013) decreased T cell suppression and reduced tumor growth in a KrasG12D lung cancer mouse model. In a more recent study using a mouse model of neuroblastoma, myeloid Arg1 expression promoted tumor growth (Van de Velde et al., 2021).\n\nTo address the role of macrophage ARG1 in PDA, we used a dual-recombinase genetic approach to delete Arg1 in myeloid cells and aged the mice until most animals in the control group developed invasive PDA. We discovered that deletion of Arg1 in myeloid cells reduced progression to invasive disease, conversely resulting in accumulation of early lesions with prominent Tuft cells, a cell type that is protective toward tumor progression (DelGiorno et al., 2020; Hoffman et al., 2021). Reduced tumor progression was accompanied by changes in the immune microenvironment, such as an increase in infiltration and activation of CD8+ T cells. However, a fraction of the mice developed invasive disease. Complete CD8+ T cell reactivation against tumors did not occur as we also observed an increase in exhausted CD8+ T cells. Additionally, from sc-RNA-seq, we observed increased Arg2 expression in myeloid cells. This finding is in line with a report in which patients with ARG1 deficiency had an increase in ARG2 levels (Crombez and Cederbaum, 2005; Grody et al., 1993), suggesting compensation of ARG2 for the loss of ARG1.\n\nFurther analysis revealed that, in the absence of myeloid Arg1, the chemosensory tuft cells began to express ARG1. Tuft cells sense their surrounding environment and respond in a variety of ways, including modifying immune responses in a way that restrains PDA malignant progression (DelGiorno et al., 2020; Hoffman et al., 2021). Their compensation for the loss of myeloid Arg1 expression in what is likely now an arginine-rich microenvironment is consistent with these functions and suggests that systemic inhibition of ARG1 may have a more profound effect than its ablation from myeloid cells alone.\n\nTo systemically inhibit ARG1, we used CB-1158 (INCB001158), an orally bio-available small molecule inhibitor of arginase. CB-1158 is not cell permeable and thus does not inhibit liver ARG1, which would lead to immediate toxicity (Steggerda et al., 2017). In vitro, CB-1158 inhibits human recombinant ARG1 and ARG2. The in vivo action is attributed to inhibition of extracellular ARG1 released by TAMs and other myeloid cells (Steggerda et al., 2017). We used a syngeneic, orthotopic transplantation model based on KPC pancreatic cancer cells transplanted in C57Bl6/J mice (Hingorani et al., 2005; Long et al., 2016). Treatment with CB-1158 led to an increase in infiltrating CD8+ T cells, recapitulating the findings in the spontaneous model. Immune checkpoint therapies such as PD-1/PD-L1 used to enhance the anti-tumor immune response of T cells are not effective in pancreatic cancer (Brahmer et al., 2012), in part due to resistance mechanisms induced by myeloid cells. We found that the combination treatment of CB-1158 with anti-PD1 immune checkpoint blockade reactivated exhausted CD8+ T cells and decreased tumor growth. CB-1158 is currently evaluated as a single agent and in combination with immune checkpoint therapy or chemotherapy in patients with solid tumors (https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/, NCT02903914 and NCT03314935). An open question is whether the inhibitor also has a direct effect on epithelial cells. In a model of obesity-driven pancreatic cancer, Arg2 is upregulated in epithelial cells, and its knockdown reduces tumor growth in a cell autonomous manner, independently from immune responses (Zaytouni et al., 2017). While we did not observe Arg2 expression in epithelial cells in non-obese KF mice, analysis of human data revealed low, but detectable expression of Arg2, possibly supporting the possibility that, in human patients, CB-1158 might work through systemic inhibition of both arginase isoforms in multiple cell compartments, including epithelial cells.\n\nBecause of the heterogeneity of myeloid cells acquired by their interaction with the TME, myeloid cells most likely utilize multiple mechanisms that affect their function. Our findings show that one of the mechanisms by which myeloid cells promote immune suppression and tumor growth in pancreatic cancer is through overexpression and activity of Arg1. Thus, arginase inhibition may be an effective therapeutic strategy to enhance anti-tumor immune responses.\n\nMaterials and methods\n\nKey resources table\n\nReagent type (species) or resourceDesignationSource or referenceIdentifiersAdditional informationStrain, strain background (Mus musculus)C57BL/6 JJackson LaboratoryStock #: 000664Strain, strain background (M. musculus) Arg1f/f Jackson LaboratoryStock #: 008817Strain, strain background (M. musculus)KF Wen et al., 2019 Strain, strain background (M. musculus)KFCAThis paperPasca di Magliano Lab, University of MichiganCell line (M. musculus)7940B Long et al., 2016 KPC cell lineAntibodyARG1 (Rabbit, monoclonal)Cell Signaling, Danvers, MACat #: 93668 SIF: 1:75\n\nWB: 1:1000AntibodyCD45 (Mouse, monoclonal)R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MNCat #: MAB14302IF: 1:400AntibodyECAD (Mouse, monoclonal)Cell Signaling, Danvers, MACat #: 14472 SIF: 1:50AntibodyF4/80 (Rabbit, monoclonal)Cell Signaling, Danvers, MACat #: 70076 SIF: 1:250\n\nIHC: 1:250AntibodyCK19, Troma III (Rat, monoclonal)Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, Iowa City, IAIF: 1:50AntibodyKi67 (Rabbit, polyclonal)Abcam, Cambridge, UKCat #: ab15580IHC: 1:1000AntibodyCC3 (Rabbit, polyclonal)Cell Signaling, Danvers, MACat #: 9661 LIHC: 1:300AntibodyCD8 (Rabbit, monoclonal)Cell Signaling, Danvers, MACat #: 98941 SIHC: 1:300\n\nIF: 1:400AntibodyAPOE (Rabbit, monoclonal)AbcamCat #: ab183597IF: 1:500AntibodyCOX1 (Goat, polyclonal)Santa CruzCat #:\n\nSc-1754IF: 1:200AntibodyGZMB (Rabbit, monoclonal)Cell signalingCat #: D2H2FIF: 1:800AntibodyVinculin (Rabbit, monoclonal)Cell signalingCat #: 13901 SWB: 1:1000Commercial assay, kitAlexa fluor 488 Tyramide SuperBoost kitInvitrogenCat #:\n\nB40922Commercial assay, kitRNA Scope Multiplex Fluorescent v2 Detection KitAdvanced Cell DiagnosticsCat #:\n\n323110Commercial assay, kitRNAscope Probe-Hs-ARG1Advanced Cell DiagnosticsCat #:\n\n401581Chemical compound, drugCB-1158Calithera Biosciences, Inc, South San Francisco, CA100 mg/kg,\n\nOral gavage, twice a dayChemical compound, drugAnti-PD1BioXcellCat #:\n\nBE0033-2, clone J43200 μg/i.p.\n\nEvery 3 dSoftware, algorithmR Studio Rstudio.com Version: 4.1.1 -- \"Kick Things\"Software, algorithmImageJ Imagej.nih.gov Version: 2.0.0-rc-69/1.52 pSoftware, algorithmAdobe Illustrator Adobe.com 2022Software, algorithmHalo softwareIndica LabsSoftware, algorithmPrism 9 for macOS Graphpad.com Version: 9.4.1 (458), July 18, 2022\n\nMice studies\n\nArg1f/f mice (Stock # 008817) and C57BL/6 J WT mice (Stock# 000664) were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory and bred in-house. Arg1f/f mice were generated to have loxP sites flanking exons 7 and 8 in the Arg1 gene (El Kasmi et al., 2008). Lyz2Cre/+ mice and KF (KrasFrt-STOP-Frt-G12D/+;Ptf1aFlpO/+) mice were donated by Dr. Howard Crawford. Lyz2Cre/+ mice express Cre in myeloid cells due to the insertion of the Cre cDNA into the endogenous M lysozyme (LysM) locus (Clausen et al., 1999). Lyz2Cre/+;Arg1f/f mice were generated by crossing Lyz2Cre/+ mice with Arg1f/f mice. KFCA mice were generated by crossing KF mice with Lyz2Cre/+;Arg1f/f mice. Age matched male and female mice were used in these studies.\n\nOrthotopic surgery procedure\n\n50 μl of 50,000 7940B cells (C57BL/6 J) resuspended in a 1:1 ratio of RPMI medium 1640 (Gibco, 11875093) and Matrigel matrix basement membrane (Corning, 354234) were injected into the pancreas of C57BL/6 J mice. For surgery procedure, see Aiello et al., 2016. 7940B cells were derived from a male KPC (KrasLSL-G12D/+;p53LSL-R172H/+;Ptf1aCre/+) mouse tumor (Long et al., 2016). Cells were tested for mycoplasma by MycoAlertTM Plus Mycoplasma Detection Kit (Lonza). Once mice had established tumors, around day 10 after implantation, mice were randomized into different treatment groups.\n\nChemical compounds\n\nArginase inhibitor, CB-1158 was synthesized and provided by Calithera Biosciences, Inc, South San Francisco, CA (2017). For the mice studies, CB-1158 was dissolved in Milli-Q water and administered by oral gavage twice a day at 100 mg/kg. This treatment started 10 d after tumor implantation and lasted for 10 d. The control group received Milli-Q water by oral gavage, twice a day. Purified anti-mouse PD1 antibody (BioXcell #BE0033-2, clone J43) was used for the in-vivo anti-PD1 blockade experiments. Anti-PD1 was used at a dose of 200 μg/i.p. injection, every 3 d. The control group received Polyclonal Armenian hamster IgG (BioXcell, BE0091), and it was administered in parallel to anti-PD1.\n\nSingle-cell RNA-seq\n\nHuman sc-RNA-seq data were previously published in Steele et al., 2020 (NIH dbGaP database accession #phs002071.v1.p1). Healthy mouse pancreas sc-RNA-seq data were previously published in Kemp et al., 2021b (NIH dbGap database accession #GSM5011581), and mouse spontaneous PDA sc-RNA-seq data generated using the KPC (KrasLSL-G12D/+;p53LSL-R172H/+;Ptf1aCre/+) model was previously published (NIH dbGap databse accession GSE202651). To generate the KF and KFCA sc-RNA-seq data, pancreatic tissue was harvested from KF (n=1) and KFCA mice (n=1) at 11 mo of age. The tissue was mechanically minced, then digested with Collagenase V (Sigma C9263, 1 mg/ml in RPMI) for 30 min at 37°C with shaking. Digestions were filtered through 500 μm, 100 μm, and 40 μm mesh to obtain single cells. Dead cells were removed using the MACS Dead Cell Removal Kit (Miltenyi Biotec). Single-cell complementary DNA libraries were prepared and sequenced at the University of Michigan Advanced Genomics Core using the 10× Genomics Platform. Samples were run using 50-cycle paired-end reads on the NovaSeq 6000 (Illumina) to a depth of 100,000 reads. The raw data were processed and aligned by the University of Michigan Advanced Genomics Core. Cell Ranger count version 4.0.0 was used with default settings, with an initial expected cell count of 10,000. Downstream sc-RNA-seq analysis was performed using R version 4.0.3, R package Seurat version 4.0.2, and R package SeuratObject version 4.0.1 (RStudio Team RStudio: Integrated Development for R [RStudio, 2015]); http://www.rstudio.com/ R Core Development Team R: A Language and Environment for Statistical Computing (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, 2017); https://www.R-project.org/ (Butler et al., 2018; Stuart et al., 2019). Data were filtered to only include cells with at least 100 genes and genes that appeared in more than 3 cells. Data were normalized using the NormalizeData function with a scale factor of 10,000 and the LogNormalize normalization method. Data were then manually filtered to exclude cells with <1000 or >60,000 transcripts and <15% mitochondrial genes. Variable genes were identified using the FindVariableFeatures function. Data were scaled and centered using linear regression of transcript counts. PCA was run with the RunPCA function using the previously defined variable genes. Cell clusters were identified via the FindNeighbors and FindClusters functions, using dimensions corresponding to approximately 90% variance as defined by PCA. UMAP clustering algorithms were performed with RunUMAP. Clusters were defined by user-defined criteria. The complete R script including figure-specific visualization methods is publicly available on GitHub (https://github.com/PascaDiMagliano-Lab/Arginase-1-is-a-key-driver-of-immune-suppression-in-pancreatic-cancer, copy archived at swh:1:rev:ddd8595b93230f76ebc219588953cd36f4941572; Donahue, 2023).\n\nKaplan-Meier survival analysis\n\nFor Kaplan-Meier overall survival, we used the human dataset GSE71729 containing 125 primary PDA tumor samples. The samples were split into ARG1-low (n=62) and ARG1-high (n=63) groups. Survival analysis with log-ranked test was subsequently plotted in GraphPad Prism v9.\n\nHistopathology\n\nTissues were fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin overnight, dehydrated, paraffin-embedded, and sectioned into slides. H&E and Gomori’s Trichrome staining were performed according to the manufacturer’s guidelines.\n\nImmunohistochemistry (IHC)\n\nParaffin sections were re-hydrated with two series of xylene, two series of 100% ethanol, and two series of 95% ethanol. Slides were rinsed with water to remove previous residues. CITRA Plus (BioGenex) was used for antigen retrieval and microwaved for 5 min and then 3 min. Once cool down, sections were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS for 30 min. Primary antibodies were used at their corresponding dilutions (Key resources table) and incubated at 4°C overnight. Biotinylated secondary antibodies were used at a 1:300 dilution and applied to sections for 45 minat room temperature (RT). Sections were then incubated for 30 min with ABC reagent from Vectastain Elite ABC Kit (Peroxidase), followed by DAB (Vector).\n\nCo-immunofluorescence (Co-IF)\n\nDeparaffinized slides were blocked with 1% BSA in PBS for 1 hr at RT. Primary antibodies (Key resources table) were diluted in blocking buffer and incubated overnight at 4°C, followed by secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor secondaries, 1:300) for 45 min at RT. Slides were mounted with Prolong Diamond Antifade Mountant with DAPI (Invitrogen). TSA Plus Fluorescein (PerkinElmer) was also used in the Co-IF for primary antibodies.\n\nIn situ hybridization (ISH) with Co-IF\n\nThe RNA Scope Multiplex Fluorescent Detection Kit (Advanced Cell Diagnostics) was used according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The probe used for ARG1 was Hs-ARG1 (401581, Advanced Cell Diagnostics). Freshly cut human paraffin-embedded sections were baked for 1 hr at 60°C prior to staining. Slides were then deparaffinized and treated with hydrogen peroxide for 10 min at RT. Target retrieval was performed in a water steamer boiling for 15 min, and then slides were treated with the ProteasePlus Reagent (Advanced Cell Diagnostics) for 30 min. The RNA scope probe was hybridized for 2 hr at 40°C. The signal was amplified using the AMP (amplification) materials provided in the ACD Multiplex Kit (Advanced Cell Diagnostics). The signal was developed with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) channel. Once completed, the samples were washed in PBS, and then blocked for 1 hr with 5% donkey serum at RT. Primary antibody against CD45 (1:400) was incubated overnight at 4°C. Secondary antibodies (1:300 in blocking buffer) were incubated for 1 hr at RT, and samples were washed three times in PBS. Slides were counterstained with DAPI and mounted with ProLong Gold Antifade Mountant (Thermo Fisher Scientific).\n\nImages were taken either with an Olympus BX53 microscope, a Leica SP5 microscope, a Leica STELLARIS 8 FALCON Confocal Microscopy System, or scanned with a Pannoramic SCAN scanner (Perkin Elmer). Quantification of positive cell number or area was done using ImageJ, three to five images/slide (200× or 400× magnification) taken from three to four samples per group or using the Halo software (Indica Labs).\n\nCell culture\n\nThe 7940B cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, 11965–092) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin streptomycin. Tumor cell CM were collected from the 7940B cells that were cultured to confluency. Media were centrifuged at 300 g for 10 min at 4°C to remove contaminating tumor cells. These CM were used for the macrophage polarization assay. For macrophage polarization, BM cells were isolated from WT or Lyz2Cre/+;Arg1f/f mice femurs. Once isolated, BM cells were cultured with 7940B cell CM plus total DMEM media at a 1:1 ratio for 6 d. Fresh media were added during day 3. This process allowed the differentiation and polarization of BM cells to TAMs (Zhang et al., 2017a).\n\nIn vitro CD8 T cell culture\n\nNaïve CD8 T cells were isolated from C57BL/6 mouse spleens and lymph nodes by magnetic bead separation (Miltenyi Biotec, cat # 130-096-543), following the manufacturers’ protocols. T cells were activated with plate-bound anti-CD3e (2 μg/ml) and soluble anti-CD28 (1 μg/ml) in the presence of mIL-2 (10 ng/ml; R&D Systems). Cells were cultured in media constituted with RPMI powder (USBiological, R9010-01) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and supplemented with 10% FBS and 50 μM 2-Mercaptoethanol (Gibco) or in RPMI medium lacking arginine (−Arg RPMI). 1.15 mM arginine was added to the RPMI medium. Ornithine (Orn) and urea were added at 1.15 mM to the corresponding media. 2 × 105 cells in 200 μL of media were plated in a flat-bottom 96-well plate and cultured for 3 d. To assess proliferation, cells were labeled with 5 μM Cell Trace Violet in 0.1% BSA/PBS for 30 min at 37°C prior to activation.\n\nWestern blot\n\nTAMs from WT or Lyz2Cre/+;Arg1f/f mice were lysed in RIPA buffer (Sigma-Aldrich) with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma-Aldrich). Protein samples were quantified, normalized, and then electrophoresed in a 4–15% SDS-PAGE gel (BioRad). Protein was transferred to a PVDF (polyvinylidene difluoride) membrane (BioRad), blocked with 5% milk for 1 hr at RT, and then incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4°C (Key resources table). Membranes were then incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (1:5000) for 2 hr at RT. Membranes were washed, incubated in Western Lightning Plus-ECL (PerkinElmer), and then visualized with the ChemiDoc Imaging System (BioRad).\n\nMetabolomics analysis\n\nCM (200 µL) was collected from each well of WT and Lyz2Cre/+;Arg1f/f TAMs in a six-well plate after 6 d of culture and used for extracellular metabolite profiling. Briefly, to the 200 µL of media, 800 µL of ice-cold 100% methanol was added. Cell lysates from parallel plates were used for protein quantification, and the protein amount was used to normalize the volume of samples collected for metabolomics. The samples were centrifuged at 12,000 g for 10 min after which the supernatant was collected, dried using SpeedVac Concentrator, reconstituted with 50% v/v methanol in water, and analyzed by targeted LC-MS/MS and processed as previously described (Nelson et al., 2020). For metabolomics in orthotopic tumors, ~50 mg of tumor tissue was grinded into powder with mortar and pestle containing liquid nitrogen. Thereafter, the samples were suspended in 1 mL of 80% methanol in a 1.5-mL Eppendorf tube and stored overnight at –80°C. Next day, samples were centrifuged at top speed, and supernatant was collected into a new 1.5-mL Eppendorf tube, dried, and processed for LC-MS/MS as with the in vitro samples.\n\nStatistics\n\nGraphPad Prism 9 was used to perform statistical analysis. T-test or ANOVA was performed for group comparisons. R software 3.5.2 was used for the analysis of the microarray data set. A p-value was considered statistically significant when p<0.05.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nWe thank Daniel Long and Michael Mattea for histology services at the University of Michigan.

The proposed therapeutic combination is a convincing new approach for pancreatic cancer, with an enhanced response to immune therapy upon arginase inhibition.\n\n12: e80721.\n\nDecision letter\n\nGina M DeNicola, Reviewing Editor\n\nGina M DeNicola, Moffitt Cancer Center United States ;\n\nReviewed by Gina M DeNicola, Reviewer\n\nGina M DeNicola\n\nMoffitt Cancer Center United States\n\nFind articles by Gina M DeNicola\n\nOur editorial process produces two outputs: (i) public reviews designed to be posted alongside the preprint for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below. We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.\n\nDecision letter after peer review:\n\nThank you for submitting your article \"Arginase 1 is a key driver of immune suppression in pancreatic cancer\" for consideration by eLife. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Gina M DeNicola as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Wafik El-Deiry as the Senior Editor.\n\nThe reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.\n\nEssential revisions:\n\n1) Please tone down the language regarding Arg1 being previously used as merely a marker of macrophage identity. A general role for Arg1 and arginine metabolism by myeloid cells in immunosuppression has already been established by multiple studies, including those cited by the authors, in multiple tumor types. The authors should modify this text to avoid overstating their findings.\n\n2) Please provide additional data or moderate other claims as indicated where they are not justified by the data presented. The claim that Arg1 deletion in macrophages delayed the formation of invasive disease is not completely justified by the data presented.\n\n3) Please address reviewer points that require clarifications, and add quantifications where requested.\n\nReviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):\n\nThe authors should further support the claim that Arg1 deletion in macrophages delayed the formation of invasive disease, or moderate their language.\n\nFor the claim that Arg1 deletion in macrophages delayed the formation of invasive disease, ideally, more mice could be added to the cohort, but considering that it takes so long for the mice to develop tumors the authors could consider implanting the KPC 7940B line into LysMCre/+; Arg1fl/fl mice and performing a survival or time point analysis to further support this claim. Alternatively, they could perform this experiment with 7940B transplantation into BL6 mice and treat with the arginase inhibitor, then monitor the onset of PDAC.\n\nReviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):\n\nAlthough this does not decrease the translational relevance of their findings, a main weakness of the manuscript is that the authors do not show what breaking down arginine and generating ornithine and urea does/is needed for metabolically to impact immunity, as no such metabolic assays or experiments are performed anywhere in their work.\n\n1. It would therefore be best if the authors at least show that arginine breakdown is needed for CD8+ T cell activation and proliferation, as proposed/speculated.\n\nA few additional comments:\n\n2. CB-1158 inhibits both Arg1 and Arg2 as mentioned in the manuscript. Given that a metabolic role of tumor-cell specific Arg2 expression has previously been demonstrated in PDAC tumors, the observed anti-tumor CB-1158 effect could not be merely attributed to Arg1/Arg2 role in immunity, but also to tumor intrinsic effects of Arg2 on PDAC growth.\n\n3. Figure 1A: ISH- co-IF staining data should be strengthened to support the claim; Zoomed in the photo shows 3 cells (yellow) that co-stain for ARG1(red) and CD45 (green). No quantification is provided. To support their claim \"We observed prevalent ARG1 expression in CD45+ cells, and occasional low expression in ECAD+ cells\", the authors should quantify the ISH/co-IF staining as done in other Figure 2 and its Supplement. It would be best if the authors could also show the individual fluorescence channels (prior to merging) in Supplementary data if they do not fit in the main figure.\n\n4. The same comment as in point 3, i.e. quantify- for all other "
