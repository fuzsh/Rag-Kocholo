        "meta_description": "The genetic make-up of an individual contributes to the susceptibility and response to viral infection. Although environmental, clinical and social factors have a role in the chance of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and the severity of COVID-191,2, host genetics may also be important. Identifying host-specific genetic factors may reveal biological mechanisms of therapeutic relevance and clarify causal relationships of modifiable environmental risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection and outcomes. We formed a global network of researchers to investigate the role of human genetics in SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 severity. Here we describe the results of three genome-wide association meta-analyses that consist of up to 49,562 patients with COVID-19 from 46 studies across 19 countries. We report 13 genome-wide significant loci that are associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection or severe manifestations of COVID-19. Several of these loci correspond to previously documented associations to lung or autoimmune and inflammatory diseases3–7. They also represent potentially actionable mechanisms in response to infection. Mendelian randomization analyses support a causal role for smoking and body-mass index for severe COVID-19 although not for type II diabetes. The identification of novel host genetic factors associated with COVID-19 was made possible by the community of human genetics researchers coming together to prioritize the sharing of data, results, resources and analytical frameworks. This working model of international collaboration underscores what is possible for future genetic discoveries in emerging pandemics, or indeed for any complex human disease. A global network of researchers was formed to investigate the role of human genetics in SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 severity; this paper reports 13 genome-wide significant loci and potentially actionable mechanisms in response to infection.",

        "text": "Contributing studies\n\nAll of the participants were recruited following protocols approved by local Institutional Review Boards; this information is collected in Supplementary Table 1 for all 46 studies. All protocols followed local ethics recommendations and informed consent was obtained when required. Information about sample numbers, sex and age from for each contributing study is given in Supplementary Table 1. In total, 16 studies contributed data to the analysis of critical illness due to COVID-19, 29 studies contributed data to hospitalized COVID-19 analysis and 44 studies contributed to the analysis of all cases of COVID-19. Each individual study that contributed data to a particular analysis met a minimum threshold of 50 cases, as defined by the phenotypic criteria, for statistical robustness. The effective sample sizes for each ancestry group shown in Fig. 1 were calculated for display using the formula: ((4 × Ncase × Ncontrol)/(Ncase + Ncontrol)). Details of contributing research groups are provided in Supplementary Table 1.\n\nPhenotype definitions\n\nCOVID-19 disease status (critical illness and hospitalization status) was assessed following the Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia38. The critically ill COVID-19 group included patients who were hospitalized owing to symptoms associated with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and who required respiratory support or whose cause of death was associated with COVID-19. The hospitalized COVID-19 group included patients who were hospitalized owing to symptoms associated with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nThe reported SARS-CoV-2 infection group included individuals with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection or electronic health record, ICD coding or clinically confirmed COVID-19, or self-reported COVID-19 (for example, by questionnaire), with or without symptoms of any severity. Genetic-ancestry-matched control individuals for the three case definitions were sourced from population-based cohorts, including individuals whose exposure status to SARS-CoV-2 was either unknown or infection-negative for questionnaire/electronic-health-record-based cohorts. Additional information regarding individual studies contributing to the consortium are described in Supplementary Table 1.\n\nGenome-wide association studies and meta-analyses\n\nEach contributing study genotyped the samples and performed quality controls, data imputation and analysis independently, but following the consortium recommendations (information is available at https://www.covid19hg.org/). We recommended that genome-wide association study (GWAS) analyses were run using Scalable and Accurate Implementation of GEneralized mixed model (SAIGE)39 on chromosomes 1–22 and X. The recommended analysis tool was SAIGE, but studies also used other software such as PLINK40. The suggested covariates were age, age2, sex, age × sex and the 20 first principal components. Any other study-specific covariates to account for known technical artefacts could be added. SAIGE automatically accounts for sample relatedness and case–control imbalances. Quality-control and analysis approaches for individual studies are reported in Supplementary Table 1.\n\nStudy-specific summary statistics were then processed for meta-analysis. Potential false positives, inflation and deflation were examined for each submitted GWAS. Allele frequency plots against gnomAD 3.0 genomes were manually inspected for each study. Standard error values as a function of the effective sample size were used to find studies that deviated from the expected trend. Summary statistics passing this manual quality control were included in the meta-analysis. Variants with an allele frequency of >0.1% and an imputation INFO score of >0.6 were carried forward from each study. Variants and alleles were lifted over to genome build GRCh38, if needed, and harmonized to gnomAD 3.0 genomes41 by finding matching variants by strand flipping or switching the ordering of alleles. If multiple matching variants were included, the best match was chosen according to the minimum fold change in absolute allele frequency. Meta-analysis was performed using the inverse-variance-weighted (IVW) method on variants that were present in at least two-thirds of the studies contributing to the phenotype analysis. The method summarizes effect sizes across the multiple studies by computing the mean of the effect sizes weighted by the inverse variance in each individual study.\n\nWe report 13 meta-analysis variants that pass the genome-wide significance threshold after adjusting the threshold for multiple traits tested (P < 5 × 10−8/3). We report the unadjusted P values for each variant. We tested for heterogeneity between estimates from contributing studies using Cochran’s Q-test42,43. This is calculated for each variant as the weighted sum of squared differences between the effects sizes and their meta-analysis effect, the weights being the inverse variance of the effect size. Q is distributed as a χ2 statistic with k (number of studies) minus one degrees of freedom. Two loci reached genome-wide significance but were excluded from the significant results in Supplementary Table 2 due to heterogeneity between estimates from contributing studies and missingness between studies at chr. 6: 31057940–31380334 and chr. 7: 54671568–54759789; however, these regions are not excluded from the corresponding summary statistics in data release 5 (COVID-19 HGI (https://www.covid19hg.org/results/r5/) and GWAS Catalog (study code GCST011074)). For each of the lead variants reported in Supplementary Table 2, we aimed to find loci specific to susceptibility or severity by testing whether there was heterogeneity between the effect sizes associated with hospitalized COVID-19 (progression to severe disease) and reported SARS-CoV-2 infection. We used the Cochran’s Q measure42,43, calculated for each variant as the weighted sum of squared differences between the two analysis effect sizes and their meta-analysis effect with the weights being the inverse variance of the effect size. A significant P value of P < 0.004 ((0.05/13 loci) for multiple tests) indicates that the effect sizes for a particular variant are significantly different in the two analyses (Supplementary Table 2). For the nine loci, in which the lead variant effect size was significantly higher for hospitalized COVID-19, we carried out the same test again but comparing effect sizes from hospitalized COVID-19 with critically ill COVID-19 (Supplementary Table 4). Furthermore, we carried out the same test comparing meta-analysed hospitalized COVID-19 (population as controls) and hospitalized COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2-positive but non-hospitalized as controls) (Supplementary Table 4). For these pairs of phenotype comparisons, we generated new meta-analysis summary statistics to use; including only those studies that could contribute data to both phenotypes that were under comparison.\n\nPrincipal component projection\n\nTo project every GWAS participant into the same principal component (PC) space, we used pre-computed PC loadings and reference allele frequencies. For reference, we used unrelated samples from the 1000 Genomes Project and the Human Genome Diversity Project and computed PC loadings and allele frequencies for the 117,221 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that (1) are available in every cohort; (2) have a minor allele frequency of >0.1% in the reference; and (3) are LD-pruned (r2 < 0.8; 500-kb window). We then asked each cohort to project their samples using our automated script provided at https://github.com/covid19-hg/. It internally uses the PLINK244 --score function with the variance-standardize option and reference allele frequencies (--read-freq); so that each cohort-specific genotype/dosage matrix is mean-centred and variance-standardized with respect to reference allele frequencies, but not cohort-specific allele frequencies. We further normalized the projected PC scores by dividing the values by a square root of the number of variants used for projection to account for a subtle difference due to missing variants.\n\nGene prioritization\n\nTo prioritize candidate causal genes reported in full in Supplementary Table 2, we used various gene prioritization approaches using both locus-based and similarity-based methods. Because we only describe the in silico gene prioritization results without characterizing the actual functional activity in vitro or in vivo, we aimed to provide a systematic approach to nominate potential causal genes in a locus using the following criteria.\n\n(1) The closest gene: a gene that is closest to a lead variant by distance to the gene body.\n\n(2) Genes in the LD region: genes that overlap with a genomic range containing any variants in LD (r2 > 0.6) with a lead variant. For LD computation, we retrieved LD matrices provided by gnomAD v.2.1.141 for each population analysed in this study (except for admixed American, Middle Eastern and South Asian genetic ancestry populations, for whom data are not available). We then constructed a weighted-average LD matrix by per-population sample sizes in each meta-analysis, which we used as a LD reference.\n\n(3) Genes with coding variants: genes with at least one loss-of-function or missense variant (annotated by VEP45 v.95 with GENCODE v.29) that is in LD with a lead variant (r2 > 0.6).\n\n(4) eGenes: genes with at least one fine-mapped cis-eQTL variant (PIP > 0.1) that is in LD with a lead variant (r2 > 0.6) (Supplementary Table 5). We retrieved fine-mapped variants from the GTEx v.820 (https://www.finucanelab.org/) and eQTL catalogue46. In addition, we looked up significant associations in the Lung eQTL Consortium21 (n = 1,103) to further support our findings in lung with a larger sample size (Supplementary Table 7). We note that, in contrast to the GTEx or eQTL catalogue, we only looked at associations and did not fine-map our data to the Lung eQTL Consortium data.\n\n(5) V2G: a gene with the highest overall V2G score based on Open Targets Genetics (OTG)26. For each variant, the overall V2G score aggregates differentially weighted evidence of variant–gene associations from several data sources, including molecular cis-QTL data (for example, cis-protein QTLs from ref. 47, cis-eQTLs from GTEx v.7 and so on), interaction-based datasets (for example, promoter capture Hi-C), genomic distance and variant effect predictions (VEP) from Ensembl. A detailed description of the evidence sources and weights used is provided in the OTG documentation (https://genetics-docs.opentargets.org/our-approach/data-pipeline)26.\n\nPhenome-wide association study\n\nTo investigate the evidence of shared effects of 15 index variants for COVID-19 and previously reported phenotypes, we performed a phenome-wide association study. We considered phenotypes in OTG obtained from the GWAS catalogue (this included studies with and without full summary statistics, n = 300 and 14,013, respectively)48 and from the UK Biobank. Summary statistics for UK Biobank traits were extracted from SAIGE39 for binary outcomes (n = 1,283 traits) and Neale v.2 (n = 2,139 traits) for both binary and quantitative traits (http://www.nealelab.is/uk-biobank/) and FinnGen Freeze 4 cohort (https://www.finngen.fi/en/access_results). We report PheWAS results for phenotypes for which the lead variants were in high LD (r2 > 0.8) with the 13 genome-wide significant lead variants from our main COVID-19 meta-analysis (Supplementary Table 6). This conservative approach allowed spurious signals primarily driven by proximity rather than actual colocalization to be removed (see Methods).\n\nTo remove plausible spurious associations, we retrieved phenotypes for GWAS lead variants that were in LD (r2 > 0.8) with COVID-19 index variants.\n\nHeritability\n\nLD score regression v.1.0.149 was used to estimate the SNP heritability of the phenotypes from the meta-analysis summary statistic files. As this method depends on matching the LD structure of the analysis sample to a reference panel, the summary statistics of European ancestry only were used. Sample sizes were n = 5,101 critically ill cases of COVID-19 and n = 1,383,241 control participants, n = 9,986 hospitalized cases of COVID-19 and n = 1,877,672 control participants, and n = 38,984 cases and n = 1,644,784 control participants for the analysis of all cases—all including the 23andMe cohort. Pre-calculated LD scores from the 1000 Genomes European reference population were obtained online (https://data.broadinstitute.org/alkesgroup/LDSCORE/). Analyses were conducted using the standard program settings for variant filtering (removal of non-HapMap3 SNPs, the HLA region on chromosome 6, non-autosomal, χ2 > 30, minor allele frequency of <1%, or allele mismatch with reference). We additionally report SNP heritability estimates for the all-ancestries meta-analyses, calculated using European panel LD scores, in Supplementary Table 8.\n\nPartitioned heritability\n\nWe used partitioned LD score regression50 to partition COVID-19 SNP heritability in cell types in our summary statistics for European ancestry only. We ran the analysis using the baseline model LD scores calculated for European populations and regression weights that are available online (https://github.com/bulik/ldsc). We used the COVID-19 summary statistics for European ancestry only for the analysis.\n\nGenome-wide association summary statistics\n\nWe obtained genome-wide association summary statistics for 43 complex-disease, neuropsychiatric, behavioural or biomarker phenotypes (Supplementary Table 10). These phenotypes were selected based on their putative relevance to COVID-19 susceptibility, severity or mortality, with 19 selected based on the Centers for Disease Control list of underlying medical conditions associated with COVID-19 severity51 or traits reported to be associated with increased risk of COVID-19 mortality by OpenSafely52. Summary statistics generated from GWAS using individuals of European ancestry were preferentially selected if available. These summary statistics were used in subsequent genetic correlation and Mendelian randomization analyses.\n\nGenetic correlation\n\nLD score regression50 was also used to estimate the genetic correlations between our COVID-19 meta-analysis phenotypes reported using samples of only European ancestry, and between these and the curated set of 38 summary statistics. Genetic correlations were estimated using the same LD score regression settings as for heritability calculations. Differences between the observed genetic correlations of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 severity were compared using a z-score method53.\n\nMendelian randomization\n\nTwo-sample Mendelian randomization was used to evaluate the potential for causal association of the 38 traits on COVID-19 hospitalization, on COVID-19 severity and reported SARS-CoV-2 infection using samples of only European ancestry. Independent genome-wide significant SNPs robustly associated with the exposures of interest (P < 5 × 10−8) were selected as genetic instruments by performing LD clumping using PLINK40. We used a strict r2 threshold of 0.001, a 10-Mb clumping window, and the European reference panel from the 1000 Genomes Project54 to discard SNPs in LD with another variant with a smaller P-value association. For genetic variants that were not present in the hospitalized COVID-19 analysis, PLINK was used to identify proxy variants that were in LD (r2 > 0.8). Next, the exposure and outcome datasets were harmonized using the R package TwoSampleMR55. Namely, we ensured that the effect of a variant on the exposure and outcome corresponded to the same allele, we inferred positive-strand alleles and dropped palindromes with ambiguous allele frequencies, as well as incompatible alleles. Supplementary Table 10 includes the harmonized datasets used in the analyses.\n\nThe global test from Mendelian randomization pleiotropy residual sum and outlier (MR-PRESSO)56 software was used to investigate overall horizontal pleiotropy. In brief, the standard IVW meta-analytic framework was used to calculate the average causal effect by excluding each genetic variant used to instrument the analysis. A global statistic was calculated by summing the observed residual sum of squares, that is, the difference between the effect predicted by the IVW slope excluding the SNP, and the observed effect of the SNP on the outcome. Overall horizontal pleiotropy was subsequently analysed by comparing the observed residual sum of squares, with the residual sum of squares expected under the null hypothesis of no pleiotropy. The MR-PRESSO global test was shown to perform well when the outcome and exposure GWASs are not disjoint (although the power to detect horizontal pleiotropy is slightly reduced by complete sample overlap). We also used the regression intercept in MR-Egger57 to evaluate potential bias due to directional pleiotropic effects. This additional check was used in Mendelian randomization analyses with an \\({I}_{{\\rm{GX}}}^{2}\\) index surpassing the recommended threshold (\\({I}_{{\\rm{GX}}}^{2} > 90 \\% \\))58. Contingent on the MR-PRESSO global test results we analysed the causal effect of each exposure on COVID-19 hospitalization by using a fixed-effect IVW meta-analysis as the primary analysis, or, if pleiotropy was present, the MR-PRESSO outlier-corrected test. The IVW approach estimates the causal effect by aggregating the single-SNP causal effects (obtained using the ratio of coefficients method—that is, the ratio of the effect of the SNP on the outcome over the effect of the SNP on the exposure) in a fixed-effects meta-analysis. The SNPs were assigned weights based on their inverse variance. The IVW method confers the greatest statistical power for estimating causal associations59, but assumes that all variants are valid instruments and can produce biased estimates if the average pleiotropic effect differs from zero. Alternatively, when horizontal pleiotropy was present, we used the MR-PRESSO outlier-corrected method to correct the IVW test by removing outlier SNPs. We conducted further sensitivity analyses using alternative Mendelian randomization methods that provide consistent estimates of the causal effect even when some instrumental variables are invalid, at the cost of reduced statistical power including: (1) Weighted median estimator (WME); (2) weighted mode-based estimator (WMBE); and (3) MR-Egger regression. Robust causal estimates were defined as those that were significant at an FDR of 5% and either (1) showed no evidence of heterogeneity (MR-PRESSO global test P > 0.05) or horizontal pleiotropy (Egger intercept P > 0.05); or (2) in the presence of heterogeneity or horizontal pleiotropy, the WME-, WMBE-, MR-Egger- or MR-PRESSO-corrected estimates were significant (P < 0.05). All statistical analyses were conducted using R v.4.0.3. Mendelian randomization analysis was performed using the ‘TwoSampleMR’ v.0.5.5 package55.\n\nWebsite and data distribution\n\nIn anticipation of the need to coordinate many international partners around a single meta-analysis effort, we created the COVID-19 HGI website (https://covid19hg.org). We were able to centralize information, recruit partner studies, rapidly distribute summary statistics and present preliminary interpretations of the results to the public. Open meetings are held on a monthly basis to discuss future plans and new results; video recordings and supporting documents are shared (https://covid19hg.org/meeting-archive). This centralized resource provides a conceptual and technological framework for organizing global academic and industry groups around a shared goal. The website source code and additional technical details are available at https://github.com/covid19-hg/covid19hg.\n\nTo recruit new international partner studies, we developed a workflow in which new studies are registered and verified by a curation team (https://covid19hg.org/register). Users can explore the registered studies using a customized interface to find and contact studies with similar goals or approaches (https://covid19hg.org/partners). This helps to promote organic assembly around focused projects that are adjacent to the centralized effort (https://covid19hg.org/projects). Visitors can query study information, including study design and research questions. Registered studies are visualized on a world map and are searchable by institutional affiliation, city and country.\n\nTo encourage data sharing and other forms of participation, we created a rolling acknowledgements page (https://covid19hg.org/acknowledgements) and directions on how to contribute data to the central meta-analysis effort (https://covid19hg.org/data-sharing). Upon the completion of each data freeze, we post summary statistics, plots and sample size breakdowns for each phenotype and contributing cohort (https://covid19hg.org/results). The results can be explored using an interactive web browser (https://app.covid19hg.org). Several computational research groups carry out follow-up analyses, which are made available for download (https://covid19hg.org/in-silico). To enhance scientific communication to the public, preliminary results are described in blog posts by the scientific communications team and shared on Twitter. The first post was translated to 30 languages with the help of 85 volunteer translators. We compile publications and preprints submitted by participating groups and summarize genome-wide significant findings from these publications (https://covid19hg.org/publications).\n\nReporting summary"
