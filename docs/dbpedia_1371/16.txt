It was kind of a big collage. It was done having the drummer play different grooves with different sized drums, different snares, and then chopping it up into pieces. It's very cut and paste. There's wild little moments - drums fills that come from nowhere, piano glisses and things. It's sort of patchwork. It was all done in Pro Tools.
