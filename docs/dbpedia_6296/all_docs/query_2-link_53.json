        "meta_description": "Recently, many users prefer online shopping to purchase items from the web. Shopping websites allow customers to submit comments and provide their feedback for the purchased products. Opinion mining and sentiment analysis are used to analyze products’ comments to help sellers and purchasers decide to buy products or not. However, the nature of online comments affects the performance of the opinion mining process because they may contain negation words or unrelated aspects to the product. To address these problems, a semantic-based aspect level opinion mining (SALOM) model is proposed. The SALOM extracts the product aspects based on the semantic similarity and classifies the comments. The proposed model considers the negation words and other types of product aspects such as aspects’ synonyms, hyponyms, and hypernyms to improve the accuracy of classification. Three different datasets are used to evaluate the proposed SALOM. The experimental results are promising in terms of Precision, Recall, and F-measure. The performance reaches 94.8% precision, 93% recall, and 92.6% f-measure.",

        "text": "Introduction\n\nPeople all over the world use social networking sites to share their experiences, opinions and thoughts on specific topics with others. These opinions and thoughts are an important reference to others in evaluating the products and taking decisions on which product to purchase. Therefore, opinions collection and analysis play a vital role in the product design and marketing. However, the large number of opinions is considered as beneficial as challenging to analyze. Manual analysis is a time consuming and may fail or cause incorrect decisions. Therefore, opinion mining is used to solve this problem by monitoring the peoples’ feelings and emotions toward specific products or services (Arunkarthi & Gandhi, 2016). Opinion mining is useful for filtering the users’ opinions and generating a quick summary from a large amount data in an acceptable time. Thus, the opinion mining can be used in different fields of life, such as commerce, politics, finance, purchasing items, entertainment and others (Singh et al., 2019). Opinion mining consists of three main parts: opinion holder, opinion object, and opinion orientation (Neshan & Akbari, 2020). Opinion holder is the person who gives his/her opinion. Opinion object is the property or aspect that can be expressed by the opinion holder. Opinion polarity is the orientation of the opinionated object as a positive or negative.\n\nOpinion mining uses information retrieval and natural language processing techniques to analyse opinions. Therefore, the opinion mining methods are categorized according to the level of analysis into three levels (Sharma, Nigam & Jain, 2014): document, sentence, and aspect. The document level opinion mining, which classifies the whole document or review with positive or negative based on the number of negative and positive sentiment words that appeared in the review. In this level, the review is assumed to have opinions related to a single object, although the same review may contain different objects with different opinions of the same person. Therefore, this level of analysis is not accurate for decision making. The second level is the sentence-level opinion mining where each sentence is considered as a single review which contains only one opinion. The third one is the aspect level opinion mining. The product aspects are defined as the attributes or properties of the product. The aspects are categorized into implicit and explicit aspects. Implicit aspects are not explicitly written in the review, but extracted from the meaning. Explicit aspects are explicitly located in the review. In aspect level opinion mining, the review is classified into positive and negative label according to the product aspects appeared in the review sentences, whereas the same review may have different aspects with different sentiments. The aspect level opinion mining is the most powerful for decision making as it determines the points of strength and weakness of a product or service.\n\nThe aspect level opinion mining has two main steps. The first one is the aspect extraction step where the aspects of the product are extracted from the users’ reviews or comments. The second step is the reviews classification based on the extracted product aspects. Consider the following review from the mobile phone dataset, “the fm radio is cool.” Firstly, “fm radio” is extracted as aspect of mobile phone and (“cool”) as opinion word. Then, the review is classified according to “fm radio” as positive because “cool” is a positive oriented sentiment. The performance of the aspect-based opinion mining process is affected by the presence of negation words and spam aspects which are not related to the product. Therefore, in this paper a semantic-based aspect level opinion mining (SALOM) model is proposed to handle these issues and improve the efficiency of the aspect-based reviews classification. From this perspective, the proposed SALOM does the following: it identifies the actual aspects of the product based on the semantic similarity (Aboelela, Gad & Ismail, 2019). Furthermore, it handles the negation words appeared in the reviews’ sentences to assign accurate orientation scores. The proposed SALOM uses different types of product aspect (nearest aspect synonym, hyponym, and hypernym) to consider more reviews. These aspect types are extracted based on Wordnet taxonomy (Sharma, Nigam & Jain, 2014), and semantic similarity (Wan & Angryk, 2007). SALOM can deal with more than one aspect in the same review sentence. In addition, it uses a sentiment lexicon and two lists of the most popular positive and negative sentiment words to give more accurate sentiment scores. Finally, the proposed model generates a meaningful aspect-based review summary that helps producers and consumers make a decision. The experimental results show a promising performance compared to other methods. SALOM reaches to 94.8%, 93%, and 92.6% in terms of Precision, Recall and F-measure respectively.\n\nThe rest of the document is organized like this. Related work in “Related Work” presents a summary of previous studies in the area of opinion mining. How the SALOM model woks are described and explained in “The Proposed Semantic-based Aspect Level Opinion Mining (SALOM) Model”. “Experiments and Results” presents the characteristics of the dataset used, evaluation measures, experiments and outcomes. A discussion can be found in “Discussion”. The conclusion and future work are discussed in “Conclusion and Future Work”.\n\nRelated work\n\nThe related work section provides an overview of some studies in the field of opinion mining and sentiment analysis. Two types of studies are given. The first type is linked only to aspect extraction step. The second is related to the opinion mining process at the aspect level (aspect extraction + aspect-based reviews classification).\n\nA pattern knowledge approach is proposed in Htay & Lynn (2013). They defined some patterns to extract the opinionated aspects from the product’s reviews dataset. Nouns and noun phrases are assumed to be product aspects. Examples of the predefined patterns: (adjective, singular noun/plural noun) and (adverb/comparative adverb/superlative adverb, adjective/adverb/comparative adverb/superlative adverb, singular noun/plural noun). Stanford part of speech (POS) tagger (Chinsha & Joseph, 2015) is used to extract the defined patterns from reviews.\n\nKhan, Baharudin & Khan (2014), the authors identified the product aspects by using the semantic relation and the syntactic sequence. The semantic relation is based on polarity adjectives and the syntactic sequence is based on linguistic patterns.\n\nNouns and noun phrases are considered as product aspects in Maharani, Widyantoro & Khodra (2015). A syntactic pattern approach based on aspects observation is proposed to extract the product aspects from reviews dataset. To extract the aspects that match the predefined patterns, Stanford part of speech (POS) tagger is used. The proposed approach considered the part of speech tag of the current word, previous and next words (current, (current − 1), and (current + 1)).\n\nIn Bagheri & Nadi (2018), a framework is proposed to extract the single and multi-word aspects from customer reviews. The authors extracted five products’ datasets from Amazon.com to test the presented framework. The words with noun tags are considered as single-word aspects. For multi-word aspects, several patterns are defined to extract the aspects from reviews’ sentences. Moreover, the c-value measure is calculated for each extracted multi-word aspect to rank the aspects and select the important ones. For each candidate aspect, the Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) association measure is calculated to extract the final product aspects. Table 1 presents a summary of the studies performed aspect extraction only.\n\nIn Aboelela, Gad & Ismail (2019), the exact product aspects are extracted by using the WU-Palmer semantic similarity (Wan & Angryk, 2007). Nouns and noun phrases are considered as product aspects. Stanford part of speech (POS) tagger is used for tagging the reviews. The experiments are performed on three different product datasets and achieved promising results in terms of average recall, precision, and f-measure performance measures.\n\nIn Hu & Liu (2004), association mining rules and pruning algorithms are applied to find the product aspects from customer reviews. Whereas, the product aspects are assumed to be nouns and noun phrases, and the sentiment words assumed to be adjectives only. The experiments are performed on five products’ datasets collected from the Amazon.com. Wordnet lexicon is used to get the adjectives’ synonyms and antonyms. The negation and but clause are handled.\n\nIn Samha, Li & Zhang (2014), an opinionated summary is generated from user reviews. Main four tasks are presented: aspects and opinions extraction and classification of each aspect, grouping aspects based on similarities, find the most popular aspect sentences and finally, generate an opinionated summary. The authors used an opinion lexicon which contained a few numbers of sentiment words and a manually labeled sentiment lexicon to get the sentiment scores of aspects.\n\nIn Chinsha & Joseph (2015), adjectives and verbs are used as sentiment words. More combinations are proposed as opinion phrases such as adverbs, adjective combinations, and adverb, verb combinations. Stanford dependency parser (Marneffe, MacCartney & Manning, 2006) is used to extract the aspect related sentiment words from reviews. SentiWordnet (Esuli & Sebastiani, 2006) is used to detect the aspect orientation and Wordnet to get the aspect synonyms. Negative words are handled in classification phase.\n\nNouns and noun phrases are considered as product aspects in Sarawgi & Pathak (2017). The reviews are extracted from Amazon web services. Natural Language (NL) processor is used for sentence segmentation. Part Of Speech (POS) tagging and Apriori algorithm are used to get the most frequent aspects. Moreover, SentiWordnet lexicon is used to get the sentiment words (adjectives) orientation.\n\nFour modules are presented in Asghar et al. (2017) for aspect-based opinion mining, which namely aspect-sentiment extraction, aspect grouping, aspect-sentiment classification, and aspect-based summary generation. The accuracy of the classification is enhanced by using a sentiment lexicon and a revised corpus. The presented aspect extraction module is an improvement to the work proposed in Khan, Baharudin & Khan (2014). Nouns, noun phrases, and verbs are considered as product aspects. Therefore, an extended set of heuristic patterns is defined to gather the product aspects from dataset reviews. The presented approach achieved the highest precision compared to the other methods in Chinsha & Joseph (2015) and Samha, Li & Zhang (2014). Their approach did not consider the following: extracting the implicit aspects, handling multiple aspects and their related sentiments, slang, and emotions.\n\nA supervised learning model is presented in Haque, Saber & Shah (2018) to classify different unlabeled products’ datasets that come from Amazon.com. The datasets are labeled manually and different classifiers are used to get the right class label. The labeled datasets are processed to extract the aspects of each product. Bag of words, TF-IDF, and chi-square approaches are used to extract the aspects. Different classifiers have also been tested to classify the reviews according to the extracted aspects and to achieve the best classification performance. The used classifiers are the Linear Support Vector Machine, Multinomial Naïve Bayes, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Decision Tree.\n\nIn Güner, Coyne & Smit (2019), three different machine learning algorithms are experimented to classify product reviews that come from Amazon.com. The algorithms are the Multinomial Naïve Bayes (MNB), the Linear Support Vector Machine (LSVM), and the Long short-term memory network (LSTM). The experiments showed that the long short-term memory network (LSTM) achieved the highest accuracy. The main tasks of the approach presented in Güner, Coyne & Smit (2019) are aspect extraction, review classification. TF-IDF (Qaiser & Ali, 2018) and tokenization techniques are used for aspects extraction. For the classification with MNB and LSVM, the TF-IDF technique is applied. For classification with LSTM, the tokenization technique is performed. The tokenization technique consisted of three phases which are fitting on the training set, converting text to sequences, and padding sequences. Fitting on the training set was dependent on the number of unique words that existed in the reviews. Converting text to sequences was replacing the review words to unique integers, padding the sequences was making the sequenced arrays are equally sized by adding zeros to arrays.\n\nTwo aspect-based methods are proposed in Mowlaei, Abadeh & Keshavarz (2020) to generate dynamic lexicons. The first method used statistical methods and the other one used a genetic algorithm. The dynamic lexicons are context sensitive so, they assigned accurate scores to the words related to the context. The results showed that the use of these dynamic lexicons with most commonly used lexicons such as Bing Liu’s sentiment lexicon, MPQA Subjectivity lexicon, and SentiWordnet achieved better performance than using these known lexicons with each other.\n\nIn Neshan & Akbari (2020), a hybrid method is presented which used the lexicon-based techniques along with the machine learning methods to improve the accuracy of reviews classification. Parts of speech tagging is applied and verbs, adjectives and adverbs are considered as sentiment words. Lemmatization is performed for the extracted verbs, adjectives and adverbs and negation words are considered. SentiWordnet Score, positive and negative words ratios, Liu’s lexicon score, and SentiStrength score are used together to calculate a polarity score for each extracted sentiment word. The output polarity scores are used as input of a meta-classifier which classified the reviews to positive and negative based on four machine learning algorithms called Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Artificial Neural Network, and Decision Table. The results showed that the use of a meta-classifier improved the performance of reviews classification.\n\nMachine learning methods and lexicon-based techniques are used in Keyvanpour, Zandian & Heidarypanah (2020) to enhance the performance of opinions classification. Lexicon-based techniques are applied first and then the machine learning methods. Some documents are considered in the lexicon-based classification such as a document of stop words, a document of emotions along with their orientation, and a document of some positive and negative sentiment words. An enhanced neural fuzzy network is used to improve the performance of the proposed Opinion Mining Method based on Lexicon and Machine Learning (OMLML) method.\n\nRegarding to the mentioned disadvantages in Tables 1 and 2, the previous lexicon-based studies tried to improve the accuracy of reviews classification. However, they did not use the semantic tree to extract the aspects related to the product domain. In addition, they did not consider different types for product aspects. Moreover, most of these studies used only a sentiment lexicon, although it is insufficient to give accurate sentiment scores. Therefore, a semantic-based aspect level opinion mining (SALOM) model is proposed to address these challenges. The proposed model aims to enhance the performance of the opinion mining process and generate a helpful aspect-based review summary."
