        "text": "The word browse can be used for both books and music.\n\nAs pointed out in comments by 1006a, your example sentence does not even need a word - using Lauren's suggestion instead\n\nI'm going to browse (some) poetry and rap tomorrow\n\nAlso imho the word peruse should be a good fit as well, you could use browse for less intensity while peruse is more appropriate for a dedicated session of reading or listening without letting anyone disturb you.\n\nSome links to sites that show this usage for music:\n\nFind and Browse Music on Last.fm - https://www.last.fm/music\n\nMusic Playlist Channel on Youtube - https://www.youtube.com/user/browsemusicvideos\n\nBrowse Music by Artist - https://www.tunefind.com/browse/artist/a\n\nSome links to sites showing this usage for books:\n\nBrowse Books by Subject - https://www.barnesandnoble.com/h/books/browse\n\nBrowse Books & eBooks By Title - http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/browse/books/title/\n\nI agree with 1006a and Mitch -- enjoy works fine.\n\nMerriam-Webster includes this definition of enjoy:\n\nenjoy\n\nintransitive verb\n\n: to have a good time\n\ntransitive verb\n\n: to have for one's use, benefit, or lot : experience\n\nenjoyed great success\n\n(Emphasis mine)\n\nDictionary.com has these definitions:\n\nenjoy\n\nverb (used with object)\n\nto experience with joy; take pleasure in:\n\nHe enjoys Chinese food.\n\nto have and use with satisfaction; have the benefit of:\n\nHe enjoys an excellent income from his trust funds.\n\nSo it seems to me that one can enjoy enjoying books and music... or, simply, enjoy them.\n\nI enjoy poetry, rap, etc.\n\nI enjoy a lot of books\n\nAlthough for the latter, I would probably add \"and audiobooks\" just to be clear.\n\nAlso, I will note that I use \"consume\" with my kids all the time in this sense -- they are supposed to create something before they consume something, meaning that they have to draw a picture or write a story or something like that before they get to watch TV or play a computer game. (Reading books is an exception to this because I'd have more luck getting them to stop breathing.) But outside my (admittedly weird) family, it might sound weird to people.\n\nI wonder\n\nAppreciate\n\ncan be the answer for your question. That's what I would use. I tried to comment, but due to my low reputation, I can only post an answer.\n\nI'd like to ask, how does the following sentence sound?\n\nI enjoy appreciating poetry, rap, etc.\n\nDoes it changes the tone of what curiousdannii wanted to say in the first place?\n\nPlease let me know if it does not.\n\nThank you."
