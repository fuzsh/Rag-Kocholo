        "text": "Over the last few years, we've seen Clear Channel enter plenty of markets in NERW-land (and beyond) with \"Kiss\"-branded CHR stations, often challenging entrenched CHR competitors. But it's rare to see one of those competitors change course as quickly as in Harrisburg, PENNSYLVANIA, where Cumulus pulled the plug on CHR at \"Wink 104\" (WNNK 104.1) last week after more than a decade and a half in the format.\n\nThe move comes less than a year after Clear Channel flipped oldies WWKL-FM (99.3) to \"Kiss\" as WHKF; despite a much smaller signal, WHKF had pulled even with WNNK in the 12+ numbers by the most recent book. It didn't help, either, that WNNK parted ways with afternoon host Bruce Bond, one of the market's best-known personalities, last winter. (We hear Bond just might resurface in the market as an AM talker once his non-compete expires, by the way...)\n\nWNNK is still \"Wink 104,\" but it's competing in the hot AC arena now, offering up \"The Best Music of the 80s, 90s and Today\" and adding older tracks by Celine Dion and the like to the playlist.\n\nMoving east, Reading's WEEU (830) is reaching more of southeastern Pennsylvania these days, with a power boost last week that took the station's daytime signal from 5 kilowatts all the way to 20. The increase is giving WEEU a cleaner shot into Philadelphia during daylight hours; with 6 kW at night, WEEU remains limited to the immediate Reading and Berks County area after dark, though.\n\nPhiladelphia's WMWX (Mix 95.7) shifted some air talent this week, moving Rick Stacy to mornings and Danny Meyers to Stacy's old afternoon shift. The station also adjusted its music mix a bit, edging more towards hot AC.\n\nA bit of radio history died last week with the passing, at age 95, of the Rev. Dr. Carl McIntire. He was best known, perhaps, as the rabidly right-wing preacher whose \"Reformation Hour\" was heard on the radio from the 1960s until his recent retirement, but in radio circles he'll be forever known for the license revocation of WXUR and WXUR-FM in Media, near Philadelphia, in 1973.\n\nThe FCC revoked the stations' licenses after finding they had violated the (now-defunct) Fairness Doctrine by refusing to present the views of those opposed to McIntire's fiery anti-Communist, anti-modernist editorials. After the stations were silenced (the AM frequency, 690, reappeared later in the seventies as WPHE Phoenixville, while the FM side remained dark until 1983 when it reappeared as WKSZ, now WPLY), McIntire moved his operation to a ship anchored off the New Jersey shore, from which he operated on 1160 kHz for a few days until a fire broke out and destroyed much of the equipment.\n\nMcIntire never attempted to return to radio ownership after that, but his commentaries continued to air (most recently on WTMR in Camden) until he ceased producing them three years ago. He died Tuesday (March 19) in Voorhees, N.J.\n\nMoving into NEW YORK, the FCC gave the green light to another delayed ownership transfer, approving Cumulus' acquisition of the Aurora cluster in the New York City suburbs.\n\nIn the city, Joan Rivers exits WOR (710) and the WOR Radio Network just ahead of the schedule change that would have pushed her show back into the late-night hours. Could this be the first sign of bigger changes at the station and the network, under the new leadership of PD John Mainelli?\n\nWhile Ed Levine hasn't completed the move of WHTR (93.5 Corinth) into the Albany market quite yet, his engineers raised some eyebrows last week when the FCC Daily Digest carried a notice that an application for the move to 93.7 in Scotia had been dismissed \"at the applicant's request.\"\n\nNot to worry; that was simply a proposal to slightly modify the height on the still-valid CP to move WHTR to an 1150-watt signal from the Schenectady suburb. Another obstacle to the move has been cleared as well: Northeast Gospel Broadcasters' application for a change in frequency to their proposed Scotia translator of WNGN (91.9 Argyle) has been withdrawn. W288BD was granted on 105.5, with the proposal for 93.7 now off the table.\n\nNeed more evidence that the whole FM allocations procedure is completely broken? Probably not, but here's some anyway: Sacred Heart University went back to the FCC asking for a re-examination of the decision that allocated 102.5A to Rhinebeck, N.Y. instead of the university's proposal to give the frequency to North Canaan, Connecticut. SHU's argument runs like this: when the FCC gave Rhinebeck preference, it did so because Rhinebeck has 7,558 people while North Canaan has 3,350. But, the university argues, that's the Town of Rhinebeck with a population of more than 7,558 - and the FCC should have been considering the Village of Rhinebeck, which has 3,077 people and is thus smaller than North Canaan!\n\nThe FCC didn't buy it, ruling last week that the new allocations will stand, but the sheer amount of bureaucratic energy being expended on such nonsense should be an indication that there has to be a better way to make sense of the FM dial - or at least to account for the very different definitions of \"Town\" and \"Village\" in different parts of the country.\n\nLPFM news: the FCC granted two new LP-100s this week in the Empire State. Limestone Community Radio gets 104.7 in Limestone (just north of the Pennsylvania line near Olean), while Arcade Christian Broadcasting Corporation will get to put 100.3 on the air in Arcade, a half-hour or so east of Buffalo in Wyoming County.\n\nRich Stevens is out as morning co-host at WLLW (99.3 Seneca Falls); no word on a replacement at \"the Wall,\" and we hear Stevens is looking for work in the region.\n\nIn Binghamton, the transformation of standards WKOP (1360) into oldies WYOS displaced Hank Sommers' Saturday night standards/jazz show, but not to fear; it's resurfaced on sister station WNBF (1290), with a better signal to boot.\n\nThe RTNDA handed out this year's regional Edward R. Murrow awards last week, and nearly all the winners in Region 11 (New York/New Jersey/Pennsylvania) were from New York. In the large-market radio category, WINS took home awards for overall excellence and spot news (for 9/11 coverage); WNYC won the prizes for best newscast, best feature and best documentary and WCBS won for best use of sound. Philadelphia was represented for continuing coverage and writing (both to KYW) and best news series (WHTT).\n\nIn the small markets, Schenectady's WGY dominated, winning prizes for overall excellence, spot news and continuing coverage. Rochester's WHAM took home the best newscast award, and Albany's WAMC won for best news series."
