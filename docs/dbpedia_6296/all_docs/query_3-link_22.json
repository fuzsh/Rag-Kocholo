        "text": "We'll start in MASSACHUSETTS, where the Pax TV folks have come up with what may be an ingenious solution to some vexing DTV issues. WBPX (Channel 68) in Boston is one of several dozen stations around the country that will have to vacate its UHF channel in the next few years, as the FCC prepares to auction off the UHF spectrum above channel 51, in the \"non-core\" portion of the dial.\n\nWhile the auction will bring in some needed revenue for Pax (which owns many of the stations above channel 51 that will be displaced), it had the potential to leave the fledgling network without an outlet in Boston.\n\nEnter WBPX's digital allotment on channel 32. While Pax has yet to build WBPX-DT, it's asking the FCC to allow an unusual substitution: the move of WBPX's analog facilities from channel 68 to 32, to be replaced by a digital signal sometime after 2007.\n\nThe plan would involve a move from WBPX's current transmitter site at the Prudential Tower in Boston's Back Bay to the \"FM-128\" tower on Chestnut Street in Newton Upper Falls, thus restoring TV service to that stick for the first time since WHDH-TV (Channel 5) signed off there, thirty years ago next week.\n\nThere are some hurdles Pax will have to clear before WBPX can make its move, though: the channel 32 analog signal would fall afoul of a rule restricting TV signals that are seven channels apart from locating nearby. WBPX is offering a study to the FCC that suggests its new analog facility would not cause interference to Fox's WFXT on channel 25, just a mile away in Needham. Current FCC rules would force a channel 32 facility to be at least 95 km away from WFXT, putting it outside the Boston market.\n\nIf it's granted, WBPX would put a 700 kW directional signal, aimed east-southeast, atop the FM-128 tower at 292 meters above average terrain. We'll keep you posted as this unorthodox application makes its way through the Commission...\n\nMeanwhile, another Boston-market station wants to make a move: after more than four decades as a Worcester-licensed facility, WAAF (107.3) wants to change its city of license to Westborough, 15 miles or so closer in to Boston. The change wouldn't affect WAAF's construction permit, already granted, to move from Asnebumskit Hill in Paxton to the WUNI-TV (Channel 27) tower in Boylston.\n\nAnother move: WUNR (1600 Brookline) has applied for a new configuration at its Oak Hill, Newton transmitter site. We'd expected an application of this sort for a while now, to accomodate WRCA (1330) and WKOX (1200)'s planned moves to the site. WUNR would use 20 kW day and night from five 200-foot towers, three shared with WKOX and two others replacing WUNR's existing 350-footers. The reconstruction of the site still requires approval from Newton; that may be a long and difficult process.\n\nEddie Andelman's new WWZN (1510) talk show started last Monday (March 4); the longtime voice of WEEI is heard from noon to 3 PM on the station, which is owned by Sporting News Radio (not, as a certain Boston daily had it, the now-defunct \"One-on-One Sports.\")\n\nWhere are they now? Paul Jaxon, erstwhile half of the \"Jaxon and the Pharmacist\" morning team on WFNX, is out west now, doing afternoons at KURR in Salt Lake City. (He'd been heard most recently at the New Hampshire Seacoast's \"Shark\" combo of WSHK/WSAK.)\n\nWe're sorry to report the death of one of Boston's longest-running jazz radio voices. Mai Cramer, who hosted \"Blues After Hours\" on WGBH-FM (89.7) for more than two decades, died Feb. 25 after a battle with breast cancer. Cramer was just 54 years old.\n\nThe big news out of NEW YORK while we were away was taking place in Binghamton, where Citadel oldies outlet WYOS (104.1 Chenango Bridge) dropped its format March 1. The oldies moved down the dial to WKOP (1360 Binghamton), which dropped its standards format; WYOS then embarked on a day of stunting with a loop of \"Wild Thing\" before relaunching as \"Wild 104,\" challenging Clear Channel's WMRV (105.7 Endicott) for Binghamton's CHR audience.\n\nAt the helm of \"Wild\" as it begins its assault on Star 105.7 is the PD formerly known as \"Norm on the Barstool.\" Fresh from his stint at Rochester's WPXY (97.9), the now-renamed \"K.J. Bryant\" is doing afternoons on WYOS as he seeks a new morning show. Christine Fox of WFHN (107.1 Fairhaven MA) is doing middays by voicetrack, while Jerry Kidd, formerly of WMRV, is handling nights.\n\nWe hear WWYL will be the new call on 104.1 when the FCC gets around to it, while the venerable WKOP calls may disappear from 1360 again (anyone here remember WBNK or WRSG?) in favor of WYOS.\n\nMeanwhile out in Vestal, Clear Channel declined to renew the contracts of WBBI (107.5 Endwell)'s \"Breakfast Flakes,\" Jerry James and Dave Freeman. A year after luring the pair over from Citadel's top-rated WHWK (98.1), the company appears to be moving in a different direction with \"B107.5\" - we've heard rumors of a new oldies format here to pick up some of the listeners who used to tune to WYOS. Will Jerry and Dave return to the Hawk? Again...stay tuned!\n\nPlenty of news from New York City, too, and we'll start at talker WOR (710), where PD David Bernstein was shown the door last week after nearly a decade at the station. WOR officials say they want to take the station in a different direction; no word yet on where Bernstein (one of your editor's former bosses at Boston's WBZ) will land next.\n\nNew York's public radio station announced its post-9/11 plans to resume separate programming on its AM and FM facilities, and classical-music fans are already up in arms. WNYC has been simulcasting on 820 AM and 93.9 FM since its old FM transmitter site at the World Trade Center was destroyed; the plan now calls for and end to the simulcast on April 8. The FM side, which had been mostly classical before the attack, will now carry NPR news and talk during the 9 AM to 4 PM block, returning to music at 7 PM after \"All Things Considered.\" WNYC says it still hopes to add a second FM service to pick up the classical slack; expect plenty of protests from the music crowd before this is all over.\n\nOut on Long Island, Clear Channel parted ways with WALK-FM (97.5 Patchogue) station manager Mark Clark; no replacement has been named out there, either.\n\nThe programming on two of New York's leased-time outlets flipped last week, moving Korean-language broadcasts from WZRC (1480 New York) to WNSW (1430 Newark NJ), with the Chinese broadcasts that had been on 1430 heading up to 1480. Both stations are owned by Arthur Liu's Multicultural Broadcasting; the Korean programming is now also heard out on Long Island at WGSM (740 Huntington).\n\nWhile we're on that end of the New York AM dial, Spanish religious WWRV (1330 New York) was granted a license to cover for its power increase. WWRV moves up to 10 kW daytime from its New Jersey transmitter site, remaining at 5 kW after dark.\n\nFrom the nitpick department: WRKS-FM (98.7 New York) became WRKS(FM) this week. We're sure at least a few readers will actually find this information useful...\n\nAnd we're thrilled to report that the one and only Kemosabe, Dan Ingram, was back in the saddle last weekend on WCBS-FM (101.1) after a successful recovery from back surgery.\n\nMoving upstate again, WRNN (Channel 62) in Kingston wants a better facility for its Nyack-licensed LPTV signal. WRNN-LP wants to move from channel 35 to channel 20, increasing power from 800 watts to 2500 watts.\n\nIn Albany, Lisa Biello moves from music director to PD at WHRL (103.1), replacing Susan Groves at the Clear Channel modern AC outlet. On the AM side of the hallway, WGY (810 Schenectady) dropped Laura Schlessinger from its schedule last week. Glenn Beck replaces her in mid-mornings, while Tom Leykis disappears from the evening schedule, replaced by Phil Hendrie at 7 PM, followed by Art Bell at 10.\n\nAcross town, Radio Disney finally replaced the WGNA-FM (107.7) simulcast on WGNA (1460 Albany) on February 28. No new calls are in place on the now-Disney-owned AM yet.\n\nHere in Rochester, Clear Channel made a late-night shift on its two AMs, as Bell replaces the Truckin' Bozo on WHAM (1180). In addition to several dozen skywave signals, Bell had been heard in the market on WHAM sister station WHTK (1280), which is now running Fox Sports overnight.\n\nIn Syracuse, Radio Disney outlet WBGJ (100.3 Sylvan Beach) gets its transfer from original owner Kevin O'Kane to Craig Fox's Wolf Radio approved. We hear there may be a format change there soon. A bit to the north in Pulaski, WSCP-FM (101.7) amends its application for a power boost. Instead of asking for 3700 watts at 128 meters from a new tower next to its existing stick, WSCP now wants to go to 5200 watts at 100 meters.\n\nOver in Buffalo, sports WNSA (107.7 Wethersfield) is losing a downtown translator. W284AB (104.7 Buffalo) is being sold by former 107.7 owner John Casciani; the translator atop a downtown hospital will be the latest outlet for Bath-based religious network Family Life Ministries, relaying WCOU (88.3 Warsaw). WNSA will still be heard in Buffalo on its main signal and on the 107.3 translator licensed to Williamsville.\n\nDown in Jamestown, WKZA (106.9 Lakewood) applies for a power boost to 5100 watts at 225 meters.\n\nOn the LPFM front, there was plenty to report in the Empire State this week. The FCC dismissed the 93.3 application in Shirley (on Long Island) from Radio Nuevo Amanecer. It also dismissed a pile of applications from New York State, including: 93.9 Monticello, 94.7 Manorville, 95.7 Tunnel, 98.7 Grafton, 98.9 Hartfield, 100.7 Blodgett Mills, 103.9 Kingston, 105.9 New Hartford, 105.9 Little Valley and 107.9 Ellenville.\n\nThe FCC granted an even bigger pile of state applications (to be used for TIS-style traveler information on state highways and the New York Thruway): 92.7 Hartford, 92.9 Walton, 93.3 Coopers Plains, 94.1 Watertown, 94.3 Godeffroy, 94.9 Owego, 95.1 Witherbee, 96.1 Waterloo, 96.9 Austerlitz, 97.1 Porters Corners, 97.5 Warrensburg, 97.9 Belmont, 98.3 Mexico, 99.5 Blue Mountain Lake, 100.1 Albion, 100.5 Sloansville, 101.1 Hornell, 102.5 Dickinson Center, 102.7 Stamford, 103.7 West Beekmanstown, 104.1 Hunter, 104.5 Geneseo, 105.5 Martinsburg, 106.1 Oneonta, 106.5 Boswell Corners and 107.3 Russell.\n\nOne obituary this week: North Country bureau chief Mike Roach reports the death on February 27 of Robert Hartshorn. The former owner of WIGS (1230) and WGIX (95.3) in Gouverneur, as well as WTPL (now WRGR 102.3) in Tupper Lake, had been suffering from cancer. Since selling the stations in the mid-eighties, Hartshorn had been working as an employment counselor for the St. Lawrence County Office of Economic Development before retiring a few years back."
