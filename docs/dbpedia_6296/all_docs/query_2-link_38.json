        "text": "Introduction\n\nThe idea that rival marks should be assessed as a whole rather than in terms of their individual components is a well-established and widely accepted tenet of trademark law. Confusion, likelihood, similarity, etc. – these terms are allied to the concept of trademarks. An infringement action calls for a comparison of trademarks based on various factors. One crucial factor, and very often not considered part of strategies, is “conceptual similarity”. A test to the latter’s effect, namely the conceptual similarity test, compares competing marks based on the underlying idea or concept that the marks imply or portray. To portray instances, what has been the idea behind the inception of the impugned mark? Whether solely a word mark has been used or a logo/device has also been attached to the word mark? Like many other facets of trademark law that have been established through judicial acumen, the test of conceptual similarity is also one such.\n\nSimilarity vis-à-vis trademarks: Conceptual Similarity and Semantic Similarity\n\nThe concept of similarity is extremely crucial to the edifice of trademark law. As per Section 2(h) of the Trademarks Act, 1999, the marks will be deemed to be deceptively similar if the resemblance is likely to deceive or cause confusion. The said section implies that the resemblance should be such that it produces a hazy understanding of the rival mark being that of the victim mark. While certain marks are visually and/or phonetically similar, some marks do not fall in the latter category; however, they are still considered infringement. Here is where conceptual similarity steps in.\n\nThe conceptual similarity test compares competing marks based on the underlying idea or concept they indicate or project. The main issue in such a test is whether or not the average man might be misled or confused by two conceptually similar marks because of their similarity. This concept can be better explained with the help of the Delhi High Court judgment in the case of Shree Nath Heritage Liquor Pvt. Ltd. v. Allied Blender & Distillers Pvt. Ltd[1]. The marks in the present case were “OFFICER’S CHOICE” and “COLLECTOR’S CHOICE/OFFICER’S SPECIAL”. While a prima facie view herein would indicate a lack of phonetic similarity, the conceptual similarity test brings in a pivotal and exciting aspect to consider the words’ semantic synonymity. Citing the decision in the case of Corn Products v. Shangrila Foods[2] (wherein the marks “GLUVITA” and “GLUCOVITA” were considered), the semantic similarity was relied upon to decide on the basis for infringement beyond the normal binds of visual or phonetic similarity.\n\nThe above-mentioned case is a pioneer in the establishment of principles pertaining to semantic similarity. It has, for instance, referred to various case studies, for instance, the “Distinctive Brand Cues and Memory for Product Consumption Experiences[3]“, wherein one line is of utmost relevance to this article – that the conceptual background behind the brand name is what triggers the recollection of memory in a consumer, and not the brand name in itself. Further, the word “Collector” can be seen as a hyponym of the word “Officer”, in common parlance, both signifying a “Person holding an office of authority”.\n\nThus, since both trademarks in the current case are used in the same context for one single product, that is whisky, when a consumer is forced to decide on a purchase and is presented with the product of the appellant with the mark “Collector’s Choice”, the word “Collector” will cause him to think of the cue “Person holding an office of authority,” which is related to the word “Officer”. This signal may induce the consumer to mistakenly believe that the appellant’s whisky is the respondent’s or cause a false recollection that may confuse consumers. Thus, this concept of semantic synonymy is highly relevant to trademark jurisprudence and can be subdivided as follows.\n\nExpanding horizons of synonymy\n\nThe general understanding of synonymy is the phenomenon of two or more different linguistic forms with the same meaning. To this extent, synonymy can further be categorized. For example, synonyms of different degrees signify words with the same (although extended) meanings, but the degree of effectuation differs. For instance, fury, rage, and anger are synonyms with the same extended meaning of emotional excitement induced by intense displeasure. In contrast, anger is used commonly without a substantial degree of intensity, rage focuses on a loss of self-control, and fury empathizes with a rage so violent that it may approach madness. Similarly, are concepts of synonyms with different emotions, styles, collocations, etc.\n\nWhat becomes vital in each case, thus, is to establish the degree of synonymy with respect to other factors of similarity, which has been highlighted in the recent case of Metis Learning Solutions Private Limited v. Flipkart India Private Limited and Ors.[4] The court held that conceptual similarity could not be judged in isolation, and the overall phonetic, visual or structural similarity is also required to be seen holistically.\n\nIn Make My Trip (India) Private Ltd v. Make My Travel (India) Private Limited[5], the Court had to examine any deceptive similarity between the marks MakeMyTrip and MakeMyTravel. From a prima facie view, one part of the mark “MAKEMY” is identical, visually and phonetically, and hence, warrants no application of conceptual similarity. The test comes into the picture by comparing the rival marks’ latter half – “TRIP” and “TRAVEL”. While these two words are neither identical visually nor phonetically, they are synonyms and convey a similar idea with respect to the services they provide. Thus, the marks could be considered deceptively similar for establishing an infringement action.\n\nHyponymy & Hypernymy: An extended branch of conceptual similarity\n\nAlongside synonymy are two other important concepts we must look at – hyponyms and hypernyms. As per the Oxford English Dictionary, a Hypernym is a “word with a broad meaning constituting a category into which words with more specific meanings fall; a subordinate”. An example of this effect would be that ‘colour’ is a hypernym of ‘blue’, ‘dog’ is a hypernym of the breed ‘dachshund’, etc. On the contrary, a Hyponym is a “word of more specific meaning than a general or super-ordinate term applicable to it”; for example, ‘Spoon’ is a hyponym for ‘cutlery’, etc. Having a basic conceptual understanding of Hypernyms and Hyponyms, we now look at their relevance in trademark infringement actions.\n\nWhat hyponyms and hypernyms do is create a sense of inclusion. Sharing a hyponym in the form of a conceptual background would make the consumer think of the same thing, making it harder for him to remember the name of his favoured brand. Similarly, when two or more brand names are similar, for example, men’s perfume brands being called rugged and macho, while the meaning of each of these terms may vary according to the situation, in the context of men’s perfumes, they all refer to masculinity, and hence, are very likely to confuse the relevant category of consumers.\n\nConclusion\n\nTime and again, courts have taken the lead and strived to bring into the picture the diverse ways trademark infringement can occur. Nevertheless, a restricted and cautious approach must be followed in applying the concepts of conceptual similarity (including hypernyms and hyponyms), semantic similarity and synonymy. Best explained using an example, let us consider the men’s perfume example. Would trademark protection of synonyms cover all equivalent words, preventing the naming of any masculine fragrances after any phrase synonymous with “Tough”? Such situations may lead to malpractices such as monopoly, squatting, etc. Thus, to protect words that share a sense relation, a restrictive application must be made, preserving only those sense relations of the term where the context in which they are applied to the brand name is the same, causing identical concepts to be conveyed to consumers."
