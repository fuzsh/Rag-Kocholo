        "text": "Last week we talked about radio's popularity contest, Arbitron ratings.\n\nI promised you a look at the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Market.\n\nWe'll get to that, right after these messages.\n\nBut first, another great popularity contest on the radio, the weekly top 40 with Rick Dees, heard around here on 98.5 KRZ licensed to Freeland, an Entercom Communications station.\n\nIf you want to hear WKRZ clearly, tune to 107.9 WKRF, a simulcast signal of WKRZ.\n\nWKRF is licensed to Tobyhanna.\n\nThis signal is forever young. If you're over 40, you start to lose appreciation for lyrics like:\n\n\"They say my lip gloss is cool, my lip gloss be poppin\n\n\"I'm standing at my locker, and all the boys keep stoppin ...\" \"Lip Gloss\" by Lil' Mama.\n\nOr the frolicking fun of:\n\n\"They tried to make me go to rehab but I said 'no, no, no...' \"Rehab\" by Amy Winehouse\n\nIf you are an out-of-touch geezer looking to connect with a spry young teenager, get up-to-date in the afternoon by tuning in to the Sunday top 40 with Rick Dees.\n\nBefore he took the show over for Kasey Kasem, I knew a man in his late 70s who made a point of catching the countdown every week \"to stay in touch with hipsters.\"\n\nIt's the same great show it has always been.\n\nDees tells stories about the songs, throws in some humor, and tells the young'uns about remakes, likes Gym Class Heroes and their song \"Cupid's Chokehold,\" an amusing remake of Supertramp's \"Take a Look at My Girlfriend, (She's the only one I got).\"\n\nNothing makes a teenager more horrified than having a parent sing along with their favorite songs. That's what makes it so fun. Try launching into an explanation of where the 8-track clicked on the \"Breakfast in America\" album and watch them roll their eyes. Ordinarily, I like live local DJs, but when programming is a proven ratings getter, and entertaining to many generations, it is an excellent use of the airwaves. Must be one reason KRZ is top dog in Wilkes-Barre/Scranton.\n\nAnd now, back to the show:\n\nWilkes Barre/Scranton Market\n\nIncludes: Wyoming, Lackawanna, Luzerne, Columbia and Monroe\n\nPopulation: 684,200\n\nDiaries sent to: 1,349 households\n\nRatings shown here are for people 12 years and older listening from 6 a.m. until midnight, Monday through Sunday. This is the broadest measure.\n\nThe numbers represent \"average quarter hour.\" That is, the average percent of people listening during a 15-minute period.\n\nArbitron ratingsfor Wilkes Barre-Scranton\n\nAQH Share for Persons 12+, Mon-Sun 6AM-Mid\n\nWinter Spring\n\nWKRZ-FM Pop Contemporary Hit Radio 7.1 7.8\n\nWEZX-FM Classic Rock 5.0 7.2\n\nWMGS-FM Adult Contemporary 8.0 7.1\n\nWGGY-FM Country 6.9 6.6\n\nWBSX-FM Alternative 5.0 6.5\n\nWBHT-FM Pop Contemporary Hit Radio 5.5 4.9\n\nWILK-AM News Talk Information 4.1 3.8\n\nWSJR-FM Country 3.4 2.8\n\nWWRR-FM Classic Hits 3.0 2.8\n\nWILK-FM News Talk No ratings taken 2.2\n\nWSBG-FM Adult Contemporary 1.8 2.2\n\nWLNP-FM Soft Adult Contemporary 1.3 2.1\n\nWODE-FM Classic Hits 0.7 2.1\n\nWHLM-FM Classic Hits 2.2 1.8\n\nWZZO-FM Album Oriented Rock 0.7 1.7\n\nWQFM-FM Hot Adult Contemporary 1.3 1.4\n\nWCTO-FM Country 2.1 1.2\n\nWEJL-AM All Sports 0.8 1.2\n\nWNAK-AM Adult Standards 1.7 1.2\n\nWWYY-FM Active Rock 2.2 1.2\n\nWGMF-FM Oldies 0.5 1.0"
