        "text": "We woke up early here at NERW Central last Friday to listen to what we thought might be a big change at one of Philadelphia's lowest-rated FM stations. But while the news from WEJM wasn't very big (read on...), we were stunned by another piece of breaking news from another corner of NERW-land.\n\nAfter a career in Boston that spanned three decades, Andy Moes died of heart failure at his Milton home last Thursday night (Jan. 25). For a little over a year, Moes had been co-host of the \"Blute and Moes Show\" on WRKO (680), but his history in Boston radio began in the late seventies, when he began filling in on WROR (98.5, now WBMX). By 1979, Moes was co-hosting WROR's morning show with Joe Martelle, a gig that lasted more than a decade.\n\nIn 1991, Moes moved to WEEI (590) as the first signature personality of that station's new sports format. That lasted two years, until WEEI replaced Moes with Don Imus in morning drive. For the next few years, Moes was heard in a variety of weekend and night slots on WRKO before landing the morning job (with former Massport director Peter Blute) in October 1999.\n\nOff the air, Moes made headlines with his friendship with \"Frasier\" star Kelsey Grammer, which extended to a consulting deal for Moes in which he advised the show on how to design the studio of its fictional \"KACL Radio.\"\n\nOn air, WRKO filled Friday morning with Moes tributes, to be followed by a retrospective show Monday, after which Blute will be solo for now.\n\nMoes had been married for just six months at the time of his death. He was 51 years old.\n\nSpeaking of Saga, the company isn't following through on its plans to buy four stations in upstate NEW YORK. Last July, Ed Christian's group announced a $13.2 million deal to enter the Ithaca market by buying Eagle Broadcasting's cluster there (WHCU, WTKO, WYXL and WQNY). A petition to deny the transfer meant that the sale couldn't close by this Wednesday, so Saga has now pulled out of the deal.\n\nWho'll be next to try to acquire the stations, which dominate the small Ithaca market?\n\nJust a few dozen miles north of Ithaca sits the tiny town of Truxton, and that's where the NERW-mobile headed Friday in an attempt to figure out whether Syracuse Community Radio has really built its newest station. The answer, judging by the photo you'll see at <http://www.fybush.com/nerw.html>, is \"sort of.\"\n\nWe didn't hear WXXC (88.7) on the air, but then SCR has a tendency not to sign on until the evening hours (earlier in the afternoon we drove by SCR's original station, WXXE 90.5 Fenner, and it was not on the air either.)\n\nYou'll recall from last week's NERW that the construction permit for WXXC expired January 12, and that there was some speculation that SCR might not have told the truth when it filed an application for a license to cover that construction permit January 16. And indeed, we're told by a reader who visited the site earlier last week that the antenna shown here was not yet up during that earlier visit. What's more, the application for WXXC's license to cover states that the station was built according to the construction permit -- but that CP specifies a 12 meter structure, while this pole appeared to us to be considerably shorter.\n\n(NERW wonders why SCR is even bothering with a second station right now, instead of spending the money on something like a Comrex Hotline to provide listenable audio on the phone line that links the WXXE transmitter to the studio. We'd be surprised to find anyone who can listen to the phone-line audio on 90.5 for any length of time...)\n\nIn any case, expect the FCC to be hearing from several petitioners about this one.\n\nHere in Rochester, AllAccess reports Rick Mackenzie has left the PD chair at Infinity modern AC WZNE (94.1 Brighton). No word yet on a replacement for Mackenzie, whose career at Infinity Rochester also included some time at sister station WCMF (96.5). Holding down the fort at the Zone for now is Mike Danger, PD at sister station WPXY (97.9). (NERW wonders whether Mackenzie's departure was related to the Zone's anemic ratings in the just-released Winter book, which also showed a very weak start for Entercom's new 80s station, WBZA \"the Buzz\" 98.9, and a drop of a little more than a point as WBBF moved from the strong 98.9 signal to the 93.3 Avon rimshotter and back to its old home at 950 AM.)\n\nBuffalo is where the NERW-mobile was parked Monday night, as we tuned into the debut of WNLO (Channel 23) and its WIVB-produced 10 PM newscast. We tried to watch WNLO's predecessor, public TV WNEQ, as we drove through on Saturday, but WNEQ was keeping its usual evenings-only schedule and had yet to sign on for the afternoon.\n\nAcross town, WGRZ (Channel 2) is shuffling its anchor roster now that it's launched its 10 PM entry on Pax's WPXJ (Channel 51). Victoria Hong is now anchoring only the WPXJ show, with Maryalice Demler taking her spots at 6 and 11 on WGRZ.\n\nDown in Alfred, SUNY station WETD has dropped its application to move from 90.9 to 90.7, while in Fredonia, John Bulmer's WBKX (96.5) has applied to boost power from 660 watts to 1400 watts, remaining at the same transmitter site.\n\nThe FCC has finally made it official: as we reported two weeks ago, the new calls on 1410 in Watertown are WNER, replacing WUZZ. The station was still doing its satellite urban-oldies thing when we heard it on Friday, and we don't believe it ever used the WGME calls for which it applied earlier in the month. Also in Watertown, W25AB changes calls to WNYF-LP in anticipation of its launch as a Fox affiliate soon.\n\nOver in Glens Falls, Vox has changed the calls on two of its stations: WHTR (107.1 Hudson Falls) becomes WFFG-FM, while the WHTR calls move to the former WZZM-FM (93.5 Corinth). WHTR has been doing oldies as \"Wheels,\" while WZZM-FM has been country for years and years. Do the WFFG-FM calls portend the arrival of \"Froggy Country\" on 107.1, to match Vox's new Froggy outlet across the state line in Vermont (WWFY 100.9 Berlin)? We shall see...\n\nLast week, we told you the 96.1 CP in South Waverly PA was being sold to \"Fitzgerald and Hawras.\" This week, we can tell you that the new owners are the same folks who own WPHD (94.7 Tioga PA) in nearby Elmira and WCDW (100.5 Conklin NY) over in Binghamton -- and that 96.1, WMTG, will likely simulcast WPHD's \"The Met\" rock format when it signs on.\n\nDown in New York City, WNEW (102.7) is shuffling the deck on its talk lineup, again. The syndicated Ron and Fez show is now running there from noon till 3, with Leslie Gold returning to WNEW in the 9-noon slot.\n\nAs we'd predicted a few weeks back, former WNEW jock Vin Scelsa has found a new home in noncommercial radio at Fordham's WFUV (90.7). Scelsa's \"Idiots Delight\" will begin airing next Saturday from 8 PM until midnight (or whenever Scelsa's done), right after another WNEW alum, Pete Fornatale and \"Mixed Bag.\""
