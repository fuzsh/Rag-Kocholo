        "text": "Given a set of terms from a given domain, how can we structure them into a taxonomy without manual intervention? This is the task 17 of SemEval 2015. Here we present our simple taxonomy structuring techniques which, despite their simplicity, ranked first in this 2015 benchmark. We use large quantities of text (English Wikipedia) and simple heuristics such as term overlap and document and sentence co-occurrence to produce hypernym lists. We describe these techniques and pre-sent an initial evaluation of results.\n\nHypernymy relations (those where an hyponym term shares a “isa” relationship with his hypernym) play a key role for many Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, e.g. ontology learning, automatically building or extending knowledge bases, or word sense disambiguation and induction. In fact, such relations may provide the basis for the construction of more complex structures such as taxonomies, or be used as effective background knowledge for many word understanding applications. We present a publicly available database containing more than 400 million hypernymy relations we extracted from the CommonCrawl web corpus. We describe the infrastructure we developed to iterate over the web corpus for extracting the hypernymy relations and store them effectively into a large database. This collection of relations represents a rich source of knowledge and may be useful for many researchers. We offer the tuple dataset for public download and an Application Programming Interface (API) to help ...\n\nThis work exposes a method for extracting hyponymy-hypernymy relations from definitions situated on specialized texts in Spanish. The method starts with the automatic extraction of a set of hyponyms and hypernyms from analytical definitions. The set of hypernyms is employed as a seed to extract an additional set of relations from a domain-specific corpus. Our method considers a phase of shallow parsing for extracting fragments of analytical definitions where term and Genus Term are located. This method reaches an average recall over 89% and an average precision of 92% about relations found in a specialized corpus.\n\nHAL is a multi-disciplinary open access archive for the deposit and dissemination of sci-entific research documents, whether they are pub-lished or not.
