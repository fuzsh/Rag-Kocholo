        "text": "Regarding KNBR, San Francisco: Original call sign was KPO. Then after WWII it was KNBC for a while.\n\nWhen NBC wanted that call in Los Angeles they changed the station call to KNBR. When Susquehanna Radio bought it there was some consideration of requesting the original three letter call from the FCC, but finally corporate decided that owning a three letter call 50 kW Clear Channel station (which the President really wanted) might be too confusing to the listeners, so it stayed KNBR. Now Cumulus.\n\nThe NBC FM station was first KNBC-FM; then KNBR-FM; then KNAI News And Information (short lived), then KYUU (\"for you\"), and a dozen different ones since then. I think now it is KFRC, although those of us that have been around for along time will always consider \"KFRC\" to be \"The Big 610\".\n\nAnother call sign, although not broadcast, history: PH was a maritime station started in 1905 at the Palace Hotel in San Francisco. Letters were chosen as the \"sine\" following wireline telegraph practice. That station became KPH and is still licensed to Globe Wireless. I volunteer to operate and maintain the former KPH facility in Marin County that is now owned by the National Park Service. The KPH Project story can be found at the Maritime Radio Historical Society.\n\nOther San Francisco call history.\n\nKDFC, originally on 102.1 MHz started by and owned by Ed Davis, Sundial Broadcasting, is considered to be Damn Fine Classics.\n\nKFOG's signature was a steam diaphone fog horn. It signed on as KBAY.\n\nKSFR (long gone) was San Francisco Records.\n\nAll three stations were classical at one time. KDFC exists as a non-commercial station but still classical music.\n\nKPOO was a Lorenzo Milam station. He thought that \"POO\" was as close to bad taste as the FCC would allow.\n\nKGEI (now dark shortwave international broadcast) is General Electric International. Signed on as W6XBE.\n\nKRCA we now know was the call sign used during WWII by RCA Communications for OWI international broadcast from KET/KPH transmitter site in Bolinas, CA.\n\nThe station began as a startup in December of 1977. But well before that we'd spent four years fighting to move the 95.9 frequency off of Martha's Vineyard where it was used by WMVY. Eventually the FCC made WMVY take a different channel but WSRS, 96.1, kept us tied up for two years complaining about potential interference.\n\nIn May, 1977 the FCC finally granted our CP. But by that time, the Town of Marshfield had purchased our proposed transmitter site as conservation land to raise coyotes and spotted turtles. We found another site but when we approached the town Zoning Board, hundreds of angry potential neighbors turned out to deep six the tower. That particular meeting was well reported in the local papers. Shortly thereafter a lady called to offer us six acres of woodland next to the town landfill. She thought we might have fewer problems locating a tower there. As she adeptly observed...\"The landfill rats will be your closest neighbors. They don't vote and usually don't attend meetings.\" (We later discovered that a few of them did run for local office.)\n\nWhen we went to the Zoning Board for tower approval at the landfill site, only a few people showed up to complain and the board approved our application on the spot. After the meeting we stopped at a local Chinese restaurant to celebrate and plan the next move which was our call letter request. There were four of us and we got a bit skunked. A lot skunked actually. Someone suggested we memorialize our zoning victory with the call letters WATD. We retired to our lawyer's office and banged out the request letter on his old IBM Selectric. We mailed the letter that evening.=20\n\nA week later our station was officially WATD. It's a lasting tribute to the only place in town we could build a tower. WATD...\"W)e're A)t T)he D)ump\".\n\nThat was 23 years ago. In 1999 WATD was awarded the national Edward R. Murrow Award for Overall News Excellence. The station is one of the most honored in the state. We're usually sold out and run live 24 hours every day. But the dump is no more. On September 1, 2000 it officially became a \"transfer station\".\n\nWADN (FM) Concord, MA It was an AM, not an FM station. They called themselves \"Walden 1120\". They were never that near Walden Pond, except for being in Concord, but still used the name for an eclectic blend of folk music and BBC news. The station is now WBNW.\n\nWBNW, Boston -- now WEZE -- was a business news station, affiliated with the Bloomberg Network. There was once a sister station in Providence called WPNW.\n\nWAMH -- Amherst, Massachusetts -- student-operated station of Amherst and Hampshire Colleges. Originally, it was WAMF, Amherst College (Amherst FM, I suppose)\n\nWBOQ (FM) Gloucester, MA. This classical-music station calls itself WBACH, and the call letters reflect that. The station was previously known as WVCA -- Voice of Cape Ann.\n\nWCGY (FM) is now WQSX. For awhile, it was WEGQ, \"The Eagle.\" This station began life around 1960 as WGHJ, which were the owner's initials. It was simulcasting programs from WCCM and eventually became WCCM-FM.\n\nWCOP Boston is no longer WMEX. A couple of years ago, it became WROR temporarily, so that the owner could reserve the calls until they were ready to put them on one of their FM stations. Then it became WNFT (\"Nifty 1150\") until this year...\n\nWEZE Boston originally stood for Easy Listening music. The present WEZE used to be WEEI, and the original WEZE is now WPZE. The two stations were bought by a religious broadcaster who called WPZE \"Praise 1260,\" though now it is leased by Radio Disney.\n\nWFCR (FM) in Amherst, MA was originally =four= college radio. Then the four-college consortium founded Hampshire College, in the late 60s, and it became Five College Radio.\n\nThere used to be a WFTQ in Worcester, at 1440, which called itself \"14Q radio.\"\n\nWHDH, Boston originally had studios on the water in Gloucester. Its calls never really stood for We Haul Dead Haddock, but it was often said that they did.\n\nWJIB (FM) was given a nautical call because its studios, at the time, were located on Commercial Wharf, on the waterfront. It is no longer WCDJ and hasn't been for several years. The station began life in the 1940s as W1XHR, and then WXHR, which stood for Harvey Radio Laboratories, its owner. In the mid-1960s, it became WXHR-FM, when its then co-owned AM became WXHR(AM) and began simulcasting its classical music format. After the stations were sold, it became WJIB. The WCDJ calls went with a change to a smooth jazz format and apparently stood for CD-Jazz. It then became WBCS \"We're Boston's Country Station.\" A couple of years ago, when its owners bought out the competing country station, WKLB-FM (\"The Country Club\"), WBCS became WKLB-FM. Not long after, the WKLB calls and format moved to 99.5 in Lowell, where they are now (formerly WOAZ, \"The Oasis\") and this station became WSJZ \"Smooth Jazz\" again. Just a week or two ago, the station changed to a talk format, and the new call letters are WTKK.\n\nWJIB (AM) took those calls in order to take over the beautiful music format associated with WJIB (FM). That station began life in 1948 as WTAO, which stood for its dial position, 740. The T was supposed to represent a 7 and the A was supposed to be a 4. It became WXHR in the mid-1960s, as described above, for a couple of years. Then it became WCAS, which stood for Watertown, Cambridge, Arlington, Somerville. In bankruptcy, it became WLVG, and I don't know what that stood for. When Bob Bittner bought it, he first called it WWEA, for \"Earth Radio\" until the WJIB calls became available.\n\nWKLB-FM, Lawrence, Mass. These calls originally were on 105.7 in Framingham. Its moves to its present station are described above. It was previously WVBF, which you have listed. When the country music format was adopted, it became WCLB, \"The Country Club,\" but after the owners noticed a sudden precipitous jump in the ratings for classical music WCRB, they changed it to WKLB-FM. There is a WKLB (AM) in Kentucky, I think, which is unrelated. The original WKLB-FM (and WVBF) is now WROR.\n\nWLLH -- I believe you have the order wrong. It's Lowell, Lawrence, Haverhill. The station has always been based in Lowell, with a synchronous transmitter in Lawrence.\n\nWMBR (FM) studios are =still= located in Walker Memorial Basement at MIT. This station was formerly WTBS, \"Technology Broadcasting System until Ted Turner came along and made it worth their while to change calls.\n\nWMGT -- This is the original calls of the present WCDC, Channel 19 in North Adams, Massachusetts. The transmitter was (probably still is) located on Mt. Greylock. The present calls are a remnant of a three-station group in the 1950s called WCDA, WCDB, and WCDC, based in Albany. The CD stood for Capital District. WCDA was the main station, on channel 41, and the other two were relays. By the late 1950s, WCDA became WTEN, Channel 10 in Albany. WCDC still relays its programming. (WCDB signed off the air. WCDC still uses the same site as WMGT).\n\nWMTW-TV, WMTW-FM This was the original calls of Channel 8 in Poland Springs, Maine, and an FM station, both of whose transmitters were located on Mount Washington, New Hampshire. (The calls are now WHOM).\n\nWNRB, Boston -- used to be owned by National Religious Broadcasters. At one time in the 1980s, it was \"WMRE, the Memory Station,\" playing pre-rock-era pop music. Before that it was WITS, \"Weather, Information, Talk, Sports.\" It was originally WMEX, from the 1930s through the 1970s. In the late 50s and 60s, it was a popular Top 40 station, and because of that, when the former WCOP adopted an oldies format in 1985, it also adopted the WMEX calls.\n\nWORL -- used to be a station in Boston. It was WRYT in the 70s and 80s. When the present owners tried to get back the original calls, the best they could get was WROL, which is the current calls.\n\nWPLM -- At one time, they used the slogan \"We Play Lovely Music.\"\n\nWSNY -- These calls were once in Schenectady, New York. They also were once on 1150 in Boston.\n\nWUPY, WUPI -- These were the calls of an ill-fated jazz station in Peabody, Massachusetts in the 1960s. The calls stood for \"Whoopie.\"\n\nWXYZ, Detroit -- supposedly the original owner, George W. Trendel, wanted these call letters to stand for \"The Last Word in Broadcasting.\"\n\nKPSN, a station that lasted roughly from November 1925 until April 1931, stood for its newspaper owner, The P)asadena S)tar-N)ews, which was next door to the facility.\n\nKWTC in Santa Ana had calls requested for \"Kome West To California\". The slogan was used from late 1926 through 1928 by KWTC. Its first broadcast was on 10 December 1926. The owner, Dr. John Wesley Hancock signed an advertising deal with an Orange County-based cereal called \"Fig-Nuts\", made by the California Fig-Nuts Company in Orange. The plan by Hancock was to sell Fig-Nuts to out-of-state listeners by mail-order. KWTC got a related slogan then, \"The Date Station\", since Fig-nuts was a combination of roasted figs, dates, walnuts, raisins and whole wheat.\n\nLike most stations in the '20s, Hancock put KWTC on the air at night, when the signal could potentially skip out for hundreds of miles to DXers (distant listeners), under the right reception conditions. He reportedly had a car tour the country with a specially-equipped radio and antenna. The car would tour the west and midwest U.S., and pull into a different town each night. The engineer driving the car would tune into KWTC each night, reception permitting. The locals in town would then gather around the loudspeakers to hear the programs from Santa Ana, California and the Fig-Nuts commercials. KWTC and the slogan \"Kome West To California\" would be heard by as many listeners as possible, under this promotion by Doc Hancock.\n\n(Dr. Hancock, incidentally, was an eye doctor, who got interested in broadcasting through amateur radio). Orange County historian Jim Sleeper told the Los Angeles Times in 1981 that he had no idea whatever became of Fig-Nuts, and there's no record of how many sales of the cereal came through the KWTC broadcasts!\n\nKWTC became KREG, when it was owned by the Santa Ana Register newspaper. The paper eventually sold the station to Ernest Spencer and Wallace Wiggins and it became KVOE in 1936 for \"Voice Of the Orange Empire\". The calls were changed to KWIZ in 1954. An unconfirmed story is that calls were requested for \"Quiz\" since quiz shows were popular for a time on radio then.\n\nDuring a 40th Anniversary program in 1993, the meaning of KSBW channel 8 in Salinas was given: \"Salad Bowl of the World\". (Salinas Valley, CA, was made famous by writer John Steinbeck).\n\nI came across one of those obviously contrived call letter slogans created to fit the calls of a station that had been on the air for 2 years! This was from the Citizen's Radio Call Book of Fall-1924. It was for KFAW-Santa Ana (August 1922-November 1925) I found it on a site about low-power broadcasting...KFAW was only 10 watts. This said KFAW's slogan was \"K)ept F)rom A)wful W)inters\"!\n\nI thought I knew all the meanings of the early Los Angeles radio stations, but recently, I did a websearch on KGEF, Los Angeles (1926 to 1932), and found a website on the First United Methodist Church, which had the slogan for KGEF radio. KGEF was owned by Rev. Robert P. Shuler, of Trinity Methodist Church in downtown L.A. He was also known as \"Fightin\" Bob Shuler, and no relation to the pastor who runs the Crystal Cathedral today in Garden Grove, CA.\n\nThis story on the website says KGEF stood for: K)eep G)od E)ver F)irst That may be entirely possible, though I have never seen it in print in any of the Los Angeles radio magazines of the day....Unknown if it was heard on the air on KGEF, but that is likely. These slogans were mostly created after the call letters were assigned, and KGEF got their call letters in December 1926, assigned in sequential order. Shuler lost his license for KGEF in 1932, due to his controversial broadacsts attacking Jews, Catholics, Blacks, and going after the sinners in the L.A. Hollywood community who he deemed to be corrupt, dishonest, immoral and such.\n\nI found another meaning for KGEF, 1926-1932, from an individual who did a thesis on the station in 1975 for journalism class. He found KGEF not only stood for K)eep G)od E)ver F)irst, but they also made up this slogan, K)ind, G)entle, E)mphatic F)riend. I'm not sure if they mean the radio station or the pastor of the church, Bob Shuler, who owned the station and was pastor of Trinity Methodist Church where the KGEF studios were.\n\nI also have evidence now that KMIC, Inglewood, California stood for K-MIC or K-Mike for microphone, since the station was co-owned by the Universal Microphone Company of Inglewood from 1927-1929. James R. Fouch was owner of KMIC and the microphone manufacturer. They were located in the same building, the old Inglewood Chamber of Commerce Building, then at 219 N. Market Street in Inglewood. However, there's no evidence that KMIC used such a slogan on the air and in radio program schedules of the day, they never printed information that the station also owned Universal Microphone Company.Today, KMIC is 1150-AM in Los Angeles, KXTA.\n\nFirst of all, I have a correction...I think I'm right on this:\n\nWFBC, Greenville, S.C. - We Foster Better Citizenship. My father-in-law, who grew up in Greenville County, has a transcription from WFBC, dated 1935, with that slogan on it. Also, to my knowledge, WFBC was not moved from Knoxville...it began right there in Greenville in 1933. WIS in Columbia, and WNOX in Knoxville swapped frequencies in the late 30's. They were owned by the same companies, allowing WIS founder (in a manner of speaking) G. Richard Shafto to move WNOX's 560 to Columbia, where it could increase power to 5kw daytime (1kw non-da at night, later 5kw da-n, to protect WQAM in Miami. The WIS da was among the first in the country, so I'm told.), and move WIS's 1010 (later moving to 990) to Knoxville, where it could also operate with 5kw daytime, 1kw non-da nighttime (later increasing to 10kw day and night...da at night).\n\nWLBB, Carrollton, Ga. - I've heard about the Judge's supposed \"Love of Butter Beans\", but I don't think it's so. Bob Thorburn, long time manager of WLBB, says the calls were randomly assigned by the FCC, and that one the Judge's critics, because of the Judge's \"healthy\" appetite (he weighed over 350 pounds, and stood 6'6\"), came up with the Butterbeans slogan. The Judge, who had a wicked sense of humor, took the slogan and...well, ran with it...serving on the bench for over 50 years.\n\nWMOG, Brunswick, Ga. - Wonderful Marshes Of Glynn. Poem by Sydney Lanier. Brunswick is in Glynn County.\n\nWORG, Orangeburg, S.C. - Watching Orangeburg's Rapid Growth. Original calls were WBPD, which were nucleus of co-owner, Clarence Jones' ham calls, W4BPD. WORG calls now on FM licensed to Elloree, S.C., with studios in Orangeburg. The 1580 AM facility has WPJK, We Proclaim Jesus King (it has religious format).\n\nWTND, Orangeburg, S.C. - Founded by the Gressette family, owners of the Orangeburg Times And Democrat, locally referred to as the \"T & D\". Now silent.\n\nWRNO, Orangeburg, S.C. - Radio iN Orangeburg. Later, WDIX in DIXie. Now silent.\n\nWBAW, Barnwell, S.C. - Barnwell Allendale Williston\n\nWSNW, Seneca, S.C. - Seneca aNd Walhalla\n\nWCOS, Columbia, S.C. - Columbia's Own Station (WIS was owned by the Greenville based Liberty Life Insurance Co.)\n\nWJHP, Jacksonville, Fl. - John H. Perry, founder of station (and owner of the Jacksonville Times-Union). Station (1320 AM) was later WZAZ (I think that was it), WVOJ, and WQIK-AM. Now WJGR.\n\nWDLP, Panama City, Fl. - founded by John H. Perry, station was named for his wife, Dorothea Lindstrom Perry. Perry owned the Panama City News-Herald. Given Panama City's reputation as the \"Redneck Riviera\", many of the locals said the calls stood for We Drink Liquor Publicly. Station (590 AM) was later WGNE. Now WDIZ.\n\nWMGA, Moultrie, Ga. - Watching Moultrie Grow Agriculturally. This station has operated on 3 frequencies...first on 1400, (250w...later 1kw-d/250w-n), then on 1130 (10kw-d/10kw da-ch/250w da-n), and now on 580 (900w-d/250w da-n).\n\nWWNS, Statesboro, Ga. - Welcome to Where Nature Smiles. Interesting story...in the late 30's, Walter McDougald won a contest put on by the local Chamber Of Commerce. The contest was to come up with a slogan for the city of Statesboro. McDougald's slogan was \"Where Nature Smiles and Progress Has the Right of Way\". When Statesboro mayor Alfred Dorman built the station in 1946, he selected part of that slogan for the call sign. Four of Walter McDougald's sons would later have careers in broadcasting...Worth McDougald, (now retired) dean of the Henry Grady School of Journalism at the University of Georgia, Donald, who along with brothers Worth and Horace bought WWNS in 1958 (they sold it in 1975 for $800,000.00...just a tad more than the $85,000.00 they paid for it in '58), and Michael, who worked for WSB in Atlanta, built WCHK in Canton, Georgia, managed WAAX in Gadsden, Alabama, and owned WRGA-AM/WQTU-FM in Rome, Georgia, which he sold late last year. According to Mike, it was Statesboro having a station that made he and Worth pursue broadcasting as a career, with Don and Horace coming along later.\n\nWPTB, Statesboro, Ga. - Wonderful Place To Be. Helen Rosengart's (one of the owners) 7 year old son came up with this one.\n\nWCEH, Hawkinsville, Ga. - Cochran Eastman Hawkinsville. This regional (500w@610) had studios in all three towns, and broadcast daily from them into the mid-60's.\n\nI also used to work there [KGNO in Dodge City, KS], and there were at least two other slogans around I know of. In addition to K)ansas G)rows N)o O)nions, it according to a number of people in Dodge City also was alternatively known as K)ansas G)rows N)o O)ranges, which probably makes more sense than onions when you think about it. The other slogan, and probably the official one at one point, was K)ansas' G)ood N)eighbor O)peration.\n\nIn your call letter list, you mention KANS and KVGB. The KANS calls have been used in three different locations. First used in Wichita, the letters were on 1240 until the station changed frequencies to 1480 after WWII. (This station in time became top 40 outlet KLEO, and currently is the home to all sports KQAM). The second home to the calls was in Larned, which is on your list. This station on 1510 went on the air in 1963 and added an FM a few years later. Eventually, KANS-FM would become KQDF and later KGTR, it's current calls. KANS-FM is currently licensed to an Osage City licensed station on 92.9 (studio in Emporia). The Osage City and Larned stations were for a time under common ownership, and the Larned AM calls became KNNS after those stations were sold, with the KANS calls retained in Osage City/Emporia.\n\nKVGB in Great Bend also has a second meaning to it's call letters. It also was known as K)ansas V)oice of the G)olden B)elt, in reference to the area of Kansas where Great Bend is located (from the Golden Belt Highway, or US 40 between Kansas City and Denver)\n\nThree stations derive their call signs from Kanza, the indian tribe for which Kansas is named. They are KNZA in Hiawatha, KANZ in Garden City and KZNA in Hill City (the latter is a satellite for KANZ).\n\nThere are a number of cases in Kansas where parts of calls letters signify the past or current ownership. On radio, the LS suffix is derived from the initials of L)arry S)teckline, who built or bought a chain of radio stations he sold off the last of a couple of years ago. The LS calls were placed on a total of 11 stations over the years, first on KJLS in Hays in the early 70's, then to KWLS-KGLS Pratt and KSLS Liberal in the late 70's, then to KXLS Alva/Enid, OK and WWLS Moore, OK (old WNAD in Norman), and KQLS Colby in the Early 80's. Later on we would see KILS, first in Liberal (now KYUU) now at Minneapolis, KS (Salina), KOLS Dodge City (former KDCK), KZLS Great Bend (was KZXL), KBLS North Fort Riley, and KLLS Augusta/Wichita.\n\nTwo groups of TV (in Kansas) stations have common call sign prefixes. The NBC stations in Kansas begin with KSN, for K)ansas S)tate N)etwork (KSNW Wicihta, KSNC Great Bend (the C for Central), KSNG Garden City and KSNK Oberlin KS/McCook NE, and KSNT Topeka). KSN at one time also owned KSNF Joplin, MO, with the F denoting their coverage of four states. KWCH Wichita operates a chain in Western Kanas under the Kansas Broadcasting System moniker (KBSD Ensign/Dodge City, KBSH Hays, and KBSL Goodland).\n\nSometime, I or someone is going to have to sit down and write a history of Kansas broadcasting. In over 75 years, there have been more than a few legends made on the airwaves of the Sunflower State."
