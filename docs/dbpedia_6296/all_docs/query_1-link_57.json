Weekend programming will include The Baka Boyz on Saturday evenings and Throwback 2K with Chris Cruise on Sunday afternoons.\n\nOriginal Report 9/4: Seven Mountains Media is stunting with a loop of N’Sync’s “Pop” on its recent acquisitions in the Susquehanna Valley: 930 WHLM Bloomsburg, 1280 WBWX Berwick, 94.7 W234BH West Hazleton, 96.3 W242BY Berwick, 104.3 W282CO Bloomsburg, and 105.5 W288DF Danville PA.\n\nThe stations are promoting the launch of its new permanent brand on Tuesday, September 6 at 10:00am while redirecting listeners of the former Full Service Oldies format to new sister Classic Hits “Hanna Radio” 92.3 WHNA Riverside/106.1 WNNA Beaver Springs/97.5 W248DK Bloomsburg."
