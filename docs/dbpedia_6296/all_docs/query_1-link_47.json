        "text": "CFAC is an AM radio station serving Calgary, Alberta. Owned by Rogers Media, the station broadcasts a sports talk format branded as Sportsnet 960 The Fanâ€”co-branded with the Sportsnet television channel also owned by Rogers. CFAC broadcasts with a power of 50,000 watts 24 hours a day; the daytime signal is non-directional, and the nighttime signal is directional using a three-tower array. CFAC is currently the only radio station in Canada broadcasting on 960 AM, although the CRTC has issued an approval for a new station on 960 AM in Mississauga, Ontario. CFAC is a regional broadcast station because of its frequency of 960 AM.\n\nCFMJ is a Canadian radio station, broadcasting at 640 kHz on the AM dial. It is officially licensed to Richmond Hill, Ontario, but the studio is in the newly constructed Corus Quay building, located at 125 Queens Quay East in Toronto. The station airs a talk radio and sports format targeted to the entire Greater Toronto Area. CFMJ transmits with an eight-tower directional antenna; although it is a Toronto market station that is licenced to a suburb located to the north of the city, its transmitter is actually located in the town of Lincoln, in Niagara Region, near the southeast corner of Greenlane and Merritt Road. This location allows the station's 50,000 watt signal to cover a large portion of Southern Ontario beyond Greater Toronto, as well as western New York state, both during the day and at night.\n\nCFRI-FM is a Canadian radio station that broadcasts a contemporary hit radio format at 104.7 FM in Grande Prairie, Alberta. The station is branded as 2day FM and is owned by Vista Radio. The station began broadcasting on March 30, 2007. The station was originally called 104.7 Free FM and played a classic rock format. The current format was launched on July 14, 2014."
