        "text": "Isotopic Composition of Oxygen in Lunar Zircons\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nNemchin, A. A.; Whitehouse, M. J.; Pidgeon, R. T.; Meyer, C.\n\n2005-01-01\n\nThe recent discovery of heavy oxygen in zircons from the Jack Hills conglomerates Wilde et al. and Mojzsis et al. was interpreted as an indication of presence of liquid water on the surface of Early Earth. The distribution of ages of Jack Hills zircons and lunar zircons appears to be very similar and therefore analysis of oxygen in the lunar grains may provide a reference frame for further study of the early history of the Earth as well as give additional information regarding processes that operated on the Moon. In the present study we have analysed the oxygen isotopic composition of zircon grains from three lunar samples using the Swedish Museum of Natural History CAMECA 1270 ion microprobe. The samples were selected as likely tests for variations in lunar oxygen isotopic composition. Additional information is included in the original extended abstract.\n\nLong-Term (4 mo) Oxygen Isotope Exchange Experiment between Zircon and Hydrothermal Fluid\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBindeman, I. N.; Schmitt, A. K.; Lundstrom, C.; Golledge, S.\n\n2013-12-01\n\nKnowing oxygen diffusivity in zircon has several critical applications: 1) establishing zircon stability and solubility in hot silica-saturated hydrothermal solutions; 2) deriving metamorphic and magmatic heating timescales from intra-crystal oxygen isotopic gradients; 3) assessing the survivability of oxygen isotopic signatures in Hadean zircons. We report results of a microanalytical investigation of an isotope exchange experiment using a cold-seal pressure apparatus at 850Â°C and 500 MPa over 4 months duration. Natural zircon, quartz and rutile were sealed with a silica-rich solution doped with 18-O, D, 7-Li and 10-B in a gold capsule. The diffusion length-scales were examined by depth profiling using time-of-flight (TOF) and high-sensitivity dynamic secondary ionization mass spectrometry (SIMS). Starting materials had distinct and homogeneous Î´18O: zircon from Mesa Falls tuff of Yellowstone (+3.6â°), rutile from Karelia (-29â°), Bishop Tuff Quartz (+8.4â°), and Î´18O doped water (+400â°). Starting material zircon showed invariant 18O/16O during depth profiling. After the 4 month experiment, rutile crystal surfaces displayed etching (100's of nm), while zircon exteriors lacked visible change. Quartz was completely dissolved and reprecipitated in a minor residue. Rutile developed ~2 Î¼m long Fickian diffusion profiles largely consistent with the wet diffusion coefficients for rutile previously reported [1]. Surface U-Pb dating of zircon detected no significant Pb loss from the outermost ~300 nm of the crystal face and returned identical core-face ages. We performed Î´18O depth profiling of zircon in two directions. First, forward profiles (crystal rim inwards) by dynamic SIMS (no surface treatment besides Au-coating; Cs+ beam of 20 kV impact energy) showed initially high and decreasing 18O/16O over ~130 nm; TOF-SIMS forward profiles using a 2 kV Cs+ sputter beam and 25 kV Bi3+ primary ions on uncoated zircon surfaces (cleaned for 2 min with HF) yielded\n\nOxygen isotopic composition and U-Pb discordance in zircon\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nBooth, A.L.; Kolodny, Y.; Chamberlain, C.P.; McWilliams, M.; Schmitt, A.K.; Wooden, J.\n\n2005-01-01\n\nWe have investigated U-Pb discordance and oxygen isotopic composition of zircon using high-spatial resolution ??18O measurement by ion microprobe. ??18O in both concordant and discordant zircon grains provides an indication of the relationship between fluid interaction and discordance. Our results suggest that three characteristics of zircon are interrelated: (1) U-Pb systematics and concomitant age discordance, (2) ??18O and the water-rock interactions implied therein, and (3) zircon texture, as revealed by cathodoluminescence and BSE imaging. A key observation is that U-Pb-disturbed zircons are often also variably depleted in 18O, but the relationship between discordance and ??18O is not systematic. ??18O values of discordant zircons are generally lighter but irregular in their distribution. Textural differences between zircon grains can be correlated with both U-Pb discordance and ??18O. Discordant grains exhibit either a recrystallized, fractured, or strongly zoned CL texture, and are characteristic of 18O depletion. We interpret this to be a result of metamictization, leading to destruction of the zircon lattice and an increased susceptibility to lead loss. Conversely, grains that are concordant have less-expressed zoning and a smoother CL texture and are enriched in 18O. From this it is apparent that various stages of water-rock interaction, as evidenced by systematic variations in ??18O, leave their imprint on both the texture and U-Pb systematics of zircon.

The zircon crystals, dated by previous studies at ca. 12-9 ka, show a moderate inter-grain variation in Î´18O from 3.69â° to 5.03â°. These values are consistently lower than the normal mantle range, and interpreted to have resulted from the digestion of meteoric-hydrothermally altered intracaldera rocks in the shallow magma chamber beneath Baekdusan just prior to the crystallization of the zircons, rather than from derivation from low-Î´18O sources deep in the mantle. The whole-rock geochemical/isotopic considerations suggest that the magma mainly self-cannibalized the earlier erupted volcanic carapace around the magma chamber. This study highlights the usefulness of zircon oxygen isotopes for characterizing past volcanic activity that has now been commonly eroded away and implies that the generation of Yellowstone-type low-Î´18O magma is not a rare phenomenon in large-volume silicic eruptions.\n\nZircon oxygen isotopes reveal Ivrea-Verbano Zone source characteristics of the Sesia Valley Caldera\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nEconomos, R. C.; Quick, J. E.; Sinigoi, S.; de Silva, S. L.\n\n2013-12-01\n\nThe Sesia Valley, in the Italian Alpine foothills, contains >14 km diameter caldera adjacent to and structurally shallower than the famous Ivrea-Verbano Zone deep crustal section. The caldera and its associated eruptive sequence presents opportunity to explore volcanic magmatism in light of exposed and well characterized source candidates, namely lower crustal gabbros and the mid-crustal metasedimentary Kinzigite formation. Original geochemical characteristics of volcanic units have been obscured by the effects of subsequent hydrothermal alteration. The resistance of the mineral zircon to fluid alteration makes it a prime candidate for the preservation and exploration of these geochemical signals, such as O isotopes. Lower crustal gabbros in the Ivrea-Verbano Zone have broadly monotonic whole-rock Î´18O values between +8 and +9â°VSMOW (Sinigoi et al., 1994). Kinzigites preserve a much higher and more heterogeneous Î´18O values, typically ranging from +10â° up to +15â° (Baker, 1990). Zircons from the caldera-forming rhyolitic eruption units and a pre-caldera rhyodacitic unit were analyzed by ion microprobe at UCLA for in-situ oxygen isotope ratios. External reproducibility of within-mount standard R33 grains range from 0.27 to 0.36â°. Rhyolites from the caldera-forming eruption yield a range of Î´18O(zircon) values from 6.3â° to 8.3â°. This range displays rough correlation with CL activity - CL active grains have lower Î´18O(zircon) values while CL dark grains have higher Î´18O(zircon) values. This variation may correlate with U contents, which are notoriously low in zircons from Ivrea-Verbano Zone gabbros. We argue that the range in O isotope values suggests zircons are a good fit for magmas influenced by gabbro and Kinzigite sources. However, these zircons do not appear to be inherited directly from either the gabbro or Kinzigite sources as their O isotope signatures are typically intermediate between the two. The pre-caldera rhyodacite sample displays a\n\nOxygen diffusion in zircon\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWatson, E. B.; Cherniak, D. J.\n\n1997-05-01\n\nOxygen diffusion in natural, non-metamict zircon was characterized under both dry and water-present conditions at temperatures ranging from 765Â°C to 1500Â°C. Dry experiments were performed at atmospheric pressure by encapsulating polished zircon samples with a fine powder of 18O-enriched quartz and annealing the sealed capsules in air. Hydrothermal runs were conducted in cold-seal pressure vessels (7-70 MPa) or a piston cylinder apparatus (400-1000 MPa) on zircon samples encapsulated with both 18O-enriched quartz and 18O water. Diffusive-uptake profiles of 18O were measured in all samples with a particle accelerator, using the 18O(p, Î±) 15N reaction. For dry experimental conditions at 1100-1500Â°C, the resulting oxygen diffusivities (24 in all) are well described by: D dry (m 2/s) = 1.33 Ã 10 -4exp(-53920/T) There is no suggestion of diffusive anisotropy. Under wet conditions at 925Â°C, oxygen diffusion shows little or no dependence upon P H 2O in the range 7-1000 MPa, and is insensitive to total pressure as well. The results of 27 wet experiments at 767-1160Â°C and 7-1000 MPa can be described a single Arrhenius relationship: D wet (m 2/s) = 5.5 Ã 10 -12exp(-25280/T) The insensitivity of oxygen diffusion to P H 2O means that applications to geologic problems can be pursued knowing only whether the system of interest was 'wet' (i.e., P H 2O > 7MPa ) or 'dry'. Under dry conditions (presumably rare in the crust), zircons are extremely retentive of their oxygen isotopic signatures, to the extent that Î´ 18O would be perturbed at the center of a 200 Î¼m zircon only during an extraordinarily hot and protracted event (e.g., 65 Ma at 900Â°C). Under wet conditions, Î´ 18O may or may not be retained in the central regions of individual crystals, cores or overgrowth rims, depending upon the specific thermal history of the system.\n\nHeavy Isotope Composition of Oxygen in Zircon from Soil Sample 14163: Lunar Perspective of an Early Ocean on the Earth\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nNemchin, A. A.; Whitehouse, M. J.; Pidgeon, R. T.; Meyer, C.\n\n2006-01-01\n\nThirty oxygen analyses of a large (sub-millimetre) zircon grain from the lunar soil sample 14163 have been determined using CAMECA 1270 ion microprobe. The sample 14163 was returned form the Fra Mauro region by Apollo 14 mission. Zircon grain of 0.6-0.8 mm in size extracted from the sample was imaged using CL detector fitted to the Philips Electron Microscope in order to reveal internal structure. Oxygen isotopes have been analysed during two sessions. The first set of data was collected using the original mount where the grain was set in the resin attached to the glass slide. This resulted in the two complications: (i) standard zircon has to be analysed from the separate mount and (ii) the lunar zircon grain was rased in the holder compared to the standard. In order to investigate, if the elevated oxygen compositions observed during this session could have resulted from this difference in geometric configuration during the standard and sample analyses, the lunar zircon was extracted from the original mount, remounted with the standard chip in the new resin disk and reanalysed during the second session. All analyses made during the first session show delta O-18 values heavier than 6.0%. The second set of data has a wider spread of delta O-18 values with some values as low as 5.6%. Nevertheless, a half of observed delta O-18 values in this set is also higher than 6.0%. Slightly lighter oxygen compositions observed during the second session indicate possible dependence of measured delta O-18 values on the geometry of analysed samples. Presence of zircons with similar heavy oxygen isotope compositions on the Moon, which neither had liquid water or felic crust similar to that on the Earth nor ever developed regime similar to plate tectonics, suggests that other mechanisms can be responsible for elevated delta O-18 values in zircons. This implies that there is no support for the presence of an ocean on the surface of the early Earth and as the ocean appears to be an\n\nPost-caldera volcanism: In situ measurement of U-Pb age and oxygen isotope ratio in Pleistocene zircons from Yellowstone caldera\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nBindeman, I.N.; Valley, J.W.; Wooden, J.L.; Persing, H.M.\n\n2001-01-01\n\nThe Yellowstone Plateau volcanic field, the site of some of the largest known silicic volcanic eruptions, is the present location of NE-migrating hotspot volcanic activity. Most volcanic rocks in the Yellowstone caldera (0.6 Ma), which formed in response to the climactic eruption of 1000 km3 of Lava Creek Tuff (LCT), have unusually low oxygen isotope ratios. Ion microprobe analysis of both U-Pb age and ??18O in zircons from these low-??18O lavas reveals evidence of complex inheritance and remelting. A majority of analyzed zircons from low-??18O lavas erupted inside the Yellowstone caldera have cores that range in age from 2.4 to 0.7 Ma, significantly older than their eruption ages (0.5-0.4 Ma). These ages and the high-??18O cores indicate that these lavas are largely derived from nearly total remelting of normal-??18O Huckleberry Ridge Tuff (HRT) and other pre-LCT volcanic rocks. A post-HRT low-??18O lava shows similar inheritance of HRT-age zircons. The recycling of volcanic rocks by shallow remelting can change the water content and eruptive potential of magma. This newly proposed mechanism of intracaldera volcanism is best studied by combining in situ analysis of oxygen and U-Pb isotope ratios of individual crystals. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

T.; Nemchin, A. A.; Whitehouse, M. J.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nWe report the result of a SIMS U-Th-Pb and O-OH study of 44 ancient zircons from the Jack Hills in Western Australia with ages ranging from 4.3 Ga to 3.3 Ga. We have investigated the behaviour of oxygen isotopes and water in the grains by determining Î´18O and OH values at a number of locations on the polished surfaces of each grain. We have divided the zircons into five groups on the basis of their U-Th-Pb and OH-oxygen isotopic behaviour. The first group has concordant U-Th-Pb ages, minimal common Pb, Î´18O values consistent with zircons derived from mantle source rocks and no detectable OH content. U-Th-Pb systems in zircons from Groups 2, 3 and 4 vary from concordant to extremely discordant where influenced by cracks. Discordia intercepts with concordia at approximately zero Ma age are interpreted as disturbance of the zircon U-Th-Pb systems by weathering solutions during the extensive, deep weathering that has affected the Archean Yilgarn Craton of Western Australia since at least the Permian. Weathering solutions entering cracks have resulted in an influx of Th and U. Î´18O values of Group 2 grains fall approximately within the \"mantle\" range and OH is within background levels or slightly elevated. Î´18O values of Group 3 grains are characterised by an initial trend of decreasing Î´18O with increasing OH content. With further increase in OH this trend reverses and Î´18O becomes heavier with increasing OH. Group 4 grains have a distinct trend of increasing Î´18O with increasing OH. These trends are explained in terms of the reaction of percolating water with the metamict zircon structure and appear to be independent of analytical overlap with cracks. Group five zircons are characterised by U-Pb systems that appear to consist of more than one age but show only minor U-Pb discordance. Nevertheless trends in Î´18O versus OH in this group of grains resemble trends seen in the other groups. The observed trends of Î´18O with OH in the Jack Hills zircons are similar\n\nStability of Zircon and its Isotopic Ratios in High-Temperature Fluids: Long-Term (4 months) Isotope Exchange Experiment at 850 Â°C and 50 MPa\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBindeman, Ilya N.; Schmitt, Axel K.; Lundstrom, Craig C.; Hervig, Richard L.\n\n2018-05-01\n\nStability of zircon in hydrothermal fluids and vanishingly slow rates of diffusion identify zircon as a reliable recorder of its formation conditions in recent and ancient rocks. Debate, however, persists on how rapidly oxygen and key trace elements (e.g., Li, B, Pb) diffuse when zircon is exposed to hot aqueous fluids. Here, we report results of a nano- to micrometer-scale investigation of isotopic exchange using natural zircon from Mesa Falls Tuff (Yellowstone) treated with quartz-saturated, isotopically (18O, D, 7Li, and 11B) labeled water with a nominal Î´18O value of +450â° over 4 months at 850Â°C and 50 MPa. Frontside (crystal rim inwards) Î´18O depth profiling of zircon by magnetic sector SIMS shows initially high but decreasing 18O/16O over a 130 nm non-Fickian profile, with a decay length comparable to the signal from surficial Au coating deposited onto zircon. In contrast, backside (crystal interior outwards) depth profiling on a 2-3 Âµm thick wafer cut and thinned from treated zircon by focused ion beam (FIB) milling lacks any significant increase in 18O/16O during penetration of the original surface layer. Near-surface time-of-flight (TOF-SIMS) frontside profiles of uncoated zircon from 4-month and 1-day-long experiments as well as untreated zircons display similar enrichments of 18O over a distance of 20 nm. All frontside 18O profiles are here interpreted as transient surface signals from nm-thick surface enrichment or contamination unrelated to diffusion. Likewise, frontside depth profiling of H, Li, and B isotopes are similar for long- and short-duration experiments. Additionally, surface U-Pb dating of zircon from the 4-month experiment returned U-Pb ages by depth profiling with 1 Âµm penetration that were identical to untreated samples. Frontside and backside depth-profiling thus demonstrate that diffusive 18O enrichment in the presence of H2O is much slower than predicted from experiments in Watson and Cherniak (1997). Instead, intracrystalline\n\nDo Hf isotopes in magmatic zircons represent those of their host rocks?\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWang, Di; Wang, Xiao-Lei; Cai, Yue; Goldstein, Steven L.; Yang, Tao\n\n2018-04-01\n\nLu-Hf isotopic system in zircon is a powerful and widely used geochemical tracer in studying petrogenesis of magmatic rocks and crustal evolution, assuming that zircon Hf isotopes can represent initial Hf isotopes of their parental whole rock. However, this assumption may not always be valid. Disequilibrium partial melting of continental crust would preferentially melt out non-zircon minerals with high time-integrated Lu/Hf ratios and generate partial melts with Hf isotope compositions that are more radiogenic than those of its magma source. Dissolution experiments (with hotplate, bomb and sintering procedures) of zircon-bearing samples demonstrate this disequilibrium effect where partial dissolution yielded variable and more radiogenic Hf isotope compositions than fully dissolved samples. A case study from the Neoproterozoic Jiuling batholith in southern China shows that about half of the investigated samples show decoupled Hf isotopes between zircons and the bulk rocks. This decoupling could reflect complex and prolonged magmatic processes, such as crustal assimilation, magma mixing, and disequilibrium melting, which are consistent with the wide temperature spectrum from â¼630 Â°C to â¼900 Â°C by Ti-in-zircon thermometer. We suggest that magmatic zircons may only record the Hf isotopic composition of their surrounding melt during crystallization and it is uncertain whether their Hf isotopic compositions can represent the primary Hf isotopic compositions of the bulk magmas. In this regard, using zircon Hf isotopic compositions to trace crustal evolution may be biased since most of these could be originally from disequilibrium partial melts.\n\nZircon (Hf, O isotopes) as melt indicator: Melt infiltration and abundant new zircon growth within melt rich layers of granulite-facies lenses versus solid-state recrystallization in hosting amphibolite-facies gneisses (central Erzgebirge, Bohemian Massif)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTichomirowa, Marion; Whitehouse, Martin; Gerdes, Axel; Schulz, Bernhard\n\n2018-03-01\n\nIn the central Erzgebirge within the Bohemian Massif, lenses of high pressure and ultrahigh pressure felsic granulites occur within meta-sedimentary and meta-igneous amphibolite-facies felsic rocks. In the felsic granulite, melt rich parts and restite form alternating layers, and were identified by petrology and bulk rock geochemistry. Mineral assemblages representing the peak P-T conditions were best preserved in melanocratic restite layers. In contrast, in the melt rich leucocratic layers, garnet and related HP minerals as kyanite are almost completely resorbed. Both layers display differences in accessory minerals: melanosomes have frequent and large monazite and Fe-Ti-minerals but lack xenotime and apatite; leucosomes have abundant apatite and xenotime while monazite is rare. Here we present a detailed petrographic study of zircon grains (abundance, size, morphology, inclusions) in granulite-facies and amphibolite-facies felsic gneisses, along with their oxygen and hafnium isotope compositions. Our data complement earlier Usbnd Pb ages and trace element data (REE, Y, Hf, U) on zircons from the same rocks (Tichomirowa et al., 2005). Our results show that the degree of melting determines the behaviour of zircon in different layers of the granulites and associated amphibolite-facies rocks. In restite layers of the granulite lenses, small, inherited, and resorbed zircon grains are preserved and new zircon formation is very limited. In contrast, new zircons abundantly grew in the melt rich leucocratic layers. In these layers, the new zircons (Usbnd Pb age, trace elements, Hf, O isotopes) best preserve the information on peak metamorphic conditions due to intense corrosion of other metamorphic minerals. The new zircons often contain inherited cores. Compared to cores, the new zircons and rims show similar or slightly lower Hf isotope values, slightly higher Hf model ages, and decreased oxygen isotope ratios. The isotope compositions (Hf, O) of new zircons indicate\n\nZircon U-Pb ages and Hf isotopic compositions indicate multiple sources for Grenvillian detrital zircon deposited in western Laurentia\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHoward, Amanda L.; Farmer, G. Lang; Amato, Jeffrey M.; Fedo, Christopher M.\n\n2015-12-01\n\nCombined U-Pb ages and Hf isotopic data from 1.0 Ga to 1.3 Ga (Grenvillian) detrital zircon in Neoproterozoic and Cambrian siliciclastic sedimentary rocks in southwest North America, and from igneous zircon in potential Mesoproterozoic source rocks, are used to better assess the provenance of detrital zircon potentially transported across Laurentia in major river systems originating in the Grenville orogenic highlands. High-precision hafnium isotopic analyses of individual â¼1.1 Ga detrital zircon from Neoproterozoic siliciclastic sedimentary rocks in Sonora, northern Mexico, reveal that these zircons have low ÎµHf (0) (-22 to -26) and were most likely derived from â¼1.1 Ga granitic rocks embedded in local Mojave Province Paleoproterozoic crust. In contrast, Grenvillian detrital zircons in Cambrian sedimentary rocks in Sonora, the Great Basin, and the Mojave Desert, have generally higher ÎµHf (0) (-15 to -21) as demonstrated both by high precision solution-based, and by lower precision laser ablation, ICPMS data and were likely derived from more distal sources further to the east/southeast in Laurentia. Comparison to new and existing zircon U-Pb geochronology and Hf isotopic data from Grenvillian crystalline rocks from the Appalachian Mountains, central and west Texas, and from Paleoproterozoic terranes throughout southwest North America reveals that zircon in Cambrian sandstones need not entirely represent detritus transported across the continent from Grenville province rocks in the vicinity of the present-day southern Appalachian Mountains. Instead, these zircons could have been derived from more proximal, high ÎµHf (0), â¼1.1 Ga, crystalline rocks such as those exposed today in the Llano Uplift in central Texas and in the Franklin Mountains of west Texas. Regardless of the exact source(s) of the Grenvillian detrital zircon, new and existing whole-rock Nd isotopic data from Neoproterozoic to Cambrian siliciclastic sedimentary rocks in the Mojave Desert\n\nLi isotopes in archean zircons\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBouvier, A.; Ushikubo, T.; Kita, N.; Cavosie, A. J.; Kozdon, R.; Valley, J. W.\n\n2009-12-01\n\nLi is a fluid mobile, moderately incompatible element with a large mass difference between its two stable isotopes. Different processes can fractionate 7Li/6Li (fluid-rock interaction, metamorphic reactions, and Li diffusion), leading to variation by over 50â° of Î´7Li for common crustal material. These large variations make Î´7Li a potential tracer of continental weathering and of the fluids affecting magma sources. Here, we report Î´7Li and trace elements in Archean igneous zircons from TTG and sanukitoid granitoids from the Superior Province (Canada) in order to characterize Li in Archean zircons from well-described samples. These data are compared to detrital zircons from the Jack Hills (Western Australia) for which parent rock-type is uncertain. This study aims to better understand Li substitution in zircon and to evaluate the utility of Î´7Li and [Li] for Archean petrogenesis. Zircons (n=71) were analyzed for Î´7Li and trace elements (Li, P, Ca, Ti, V, Fe, Y, REE, U, Th) using an IMS-1280 ion microprobe. Most of the zircons display typical igneous REE patterns and zoning by CL. [Li] averages 13.1 Â± 9 for TTG, 25.7 Â± 19 for Sanukitoid and 31.0 Â± 14 ppm for Jack Hills zircons, which are distinct from mantle-related zircons (<0.1 ppm). Values of Î´7Li average 1.0 Â± 4.5â° for TTGs, 6.3 Â± 4.4â° for sanukitoids and -2.6 Â± 8.8â° for Jack Hills samples. Trace elements were analyzed from single spots in order to evaluate coupled substitutions. Atomic ratios (3Li+Y+REE)/P average 2.6, showing that Li and trivalent atoms are not charge-balanced by P, and suggesting that Li does not replace Zr, according to the xenotime substitution. However, (Y+REE)/(Li+P) atomic ratios average 1.0 Â± 0.6, supporting the hypothesis that Li is interstitial and partly compensates trivalent cations. Several observations in this study suggest that [Li] is primary in the studied zircons: i) if Li is interstitial, charge-balance and slow diffusion of REE would control Li mobility\n\n1.8 billion years of fluid-crust interaction: A zircon oxygen isotope record for the lower crust, western Churchill Province, Canadian Shield\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPetts, Duane C.; Moser, Desmond E.; Longstaffe, Frederick J.; Davis, William J.; Stern, Richard A.\n\n2014-04-01\n\nThe western Churchill Province of the Canadian Shield experienced a prolonged and complex formation history (ca. 4.04 to 1.70 Ga), with evidence for multiple episodes of orogenesis and regional magmatic activity. Here we report on the oxygen isotopic compositions of garnet and zircon recovered from lower crustal xenoliths, which have U-Pb ages between ca. 3.5 and 1.7 Ga. Overall, zircon from four metabasite xenoliths from the Rankin Inlet sample suite have Î´18O values ranging from + 5.5 to + 8.6â°. Zircon from three metatonalite/anorthosite xenoliths and five metabasite xenoliths from the Repulse Bay sample suite have Î´18O values of + 5.6 to + 8.3â°. High Î´18O values (> + 6.0â°) for the oldest igneous zircon cores (ca. 3.5 Ga and 3.0-2.6 Ga) indicate that their metatonalite/anorthosite protolith magmas were generated from, or had assimilated, supracrustal rocks that interacted previously with surface-derived fluids. Igneous zircon cores (ca. 2.9-2.6 Ga) from one metabasite xenolith have Î´18O values of + 5.6 to + 6.4â°, which suggests a formation from a mantle-derived basaltic/gabbroic magma. Metamorphic zircon cores (ca. 2.0-1.9 Ga) from one metabasite xenolith commonly have Î´18O values between + 6.0 and + 6.3â°, which is indicative of a basalt/gabbro protolith and localized reworking of the lower crust caused by regional-scale plate convergence. The wide range of Î´18O values (+ 5.5 to + 8.3â°) for ca. 1.75-1.70 Ga metamorphic zircon rims (identified in all xenoliths) indicates regional transient heating and reworking of mantle- and supracrustal-derived crust, induced by magmatic underplating along the crust-mantle boundary.\n\nOn the longevity of silicic magma based on multi-isotope investigation of zircons and modeling their survivals destinies\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBindeman, I.

E.\n\n2015-12-01\n\nLarge volumes of crystal poor, near-liquidus rhyolites are erupted worldwide as tuffs and lavas in rift and hot spots more common previously on early earth, creating temporally very high magma production rates. In this contribution we combine results of IDTIMS dating of zircons with numerical modeling of zircon crystallization. New investigation of zircons in major Yellowstone tuffs: Huckleberry Ridge (Members A,B,C), Mesa Falls, and Lava Creek (A,B) tuffs was done by a combination of in situ measurements of oxygen isotopes followed by ID-TIMS U-Pb dating, Hf isotopes and trace elemental investigation of single crystals. We discover that nearly all zircons are of eruption age, but display significant isotope (O,Hf) diversity and often show decoupled O and Hf isotope systematics. This record rapid (~103yrs) double or triple remelting and sequestration from diverse Archean crust and hydrothermally altered shallow-crustal rocks from previous eruptive cycles, followed by effective mixing of co-existing magma reservoirs with diverse zircons prior to eruptions. Similar results characterize other studied Snake River Plain rhyolites in pre-Yellowstone Heise complex. These results collectively suggest that zircons crystallize after reheating above saturation rejuvenation in isotopically-diverse areas of the crust in the magma plumbing system. Modeling of zircon and quartz dissolution and crystallization trajectories outline conditions of survival (inheritance) vs complete dissolution on conductive timescales, and when combined with a phase diagram, magma T-t paths can be computed. Zircon rejuvenation requires hot, >770-800Â°C peak temperatures lasting 10-102yrs. We speculate that near liquidus hot and dry Yellowstone rhyolites are kept alive in a multi-batch state by a series of interconnected pods and sills that can rapidly get thermomechanically assembled into large, shallow and eruptable supervolcanoic magma bodies. We suggest that overpressure and roof dynamics and\n\nNew Hf isotope data from the Jack Hills zircons: constraints on the Hadean crustal evolution\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAmelin, Y.; Davis, D.; Lee, D.\n\n2004-05-01\n\nHere we present a follow-up of our study of the \"older\" population of detrital zircons from the Jack Hills metaconglomerate W-74 [1]. We report Lu-Hf data for zircon grains, which have been previously analyzed with a number of techniques: BSE and CL imaging, detailed U-Pb SHRIMP geochronology, trace element concentrations, and oxygen isotopic compositions. After completion of non-destructive SIMS analyses and imaging, the zircons were extracted from the mounts, dissolved and analyzed for U-Pb and Lu-Hf using isotope dilution. Twenty five grains were air abraded before digestion, and eight grains were digested without abrasion. Four grains were cut, and the fragments were analyzed for U-Pb and Lu-Hf separately. The 207Pb/206Pb ages determined by isotope dilution vary between 3788-4186 Ma; the maximum SHRIMP spot 207Pb/206Pb ages of the same grains are between 3871-4276 Ma. The spot 207Pb/206Pb ages averaged over each grain are close to the whole grain isotope dilution values. The U-Pb discordance depends mainly on whether the grains were abraded: the median discordance of 27 abraded grains and fragments is 2.7 (the range is -0.4 to 20.2), whereas the median discordance of 11 unabraded grains and fragments is 66.5 (the range is 20.5 to 83.5). The epsilon176Hf values, calculated using the whole grain TIMS 207Pb/206Pb ages and the 176Lu decay constant of 1.865*10-11, are between -1.4 and -10.6. Using maximum SHRIMP spot 207Pb/206Pb ages and the same decay constant yields the range of epsilon176Hf of 0.1 to -8.6. If the decay constant of 1.983*10-11 is used instead, then the range of epsilon176Hf becomes 4.7 to -5.0 using the whole grain ages, or 6.3 to -3.0 using the maximum SHRIMP spot ages. Grain fragment analyses show internal variations of initial 176Hf/177Hf in three grains out of five. This observation is consistent with multi-episodic zircon growth rather than with ancient Pb loss. In the presentation we shall discuss the prospect of reliable interpretation of\n\nHf isotope compositions In detrital zircons as a new tool for provenance studies\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nJacobsen, Y. J.; MÃ¼nker, C.; Mezger, K.\n\n2003-04-01\n\nIdentifying the provenance of continental sediments is a major issue in palaeo-tectonic studies, providing important information for paleogeographic reconstructions. Isotope studies, e.g. those of whole rock Sm-Nd or detrital zircon U-Pb dating, have widely been used for this purpose. Here we assess the potential of combined Lu-Hf data and U-Pb ages determined on the same single detrital zircons as a new tool for provenance studies. Due to the low Lu/Hf ratios in zircons the Hf isotope composition of a zircon changes insignificantly after its crystallization. Thus each particular grain preserves information on the Hf-siotpe composition of its source and the age of this source. Provided that both the U-Pb and Lu-Hf isotope systems have not been disturbed, this information can be used to constrain the sources of each individual zircon. In order to demonstrate the capability of Hf isotope studies on detrital zircons for provenance studies, we obtained combined U-Pb ages and Lu-Hf isotope data for zircons from the Cambrian Junction Formation in New Zealand. The Junction Formation was deposited on the (present) SE margin of Gondwana near the Australian continent and consists of turbidites, siltstones and conglomerates [1]. Typical continent derived Paleozoic sediments in SE Gondwana generally show characteristic age maxima at 500-600 Ma, 1000-1200 Ma (Grenvillian) and additional older peaks (early Proterozoic to Archean) [2]. We focused on two groups of detrital zircons with Grenvillian and Proterozoic to Late Archean ages. The initial ÉHf values for these zircons range from 0.7 to -15.5 for the Grenvillian and from -5.2 to -14.1 for the Proterozoic/Archean zircons. Corresponding two stage Hf model ages range from ca. 1500 to 2500 Ma for the Grenvillian and from ca. 3200 to 3600 Ma for the Proterozoic/Archean zircons. Furthermore it can be shown that the Grenvillian zircons must have been derived from recycled Grenvillian provinces. Comparison of these Hf model ages\n\nWhat Hf isotopes in zircon tell us about crust-mantle evolution\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nIizuka, Tsuyoshi; Yamaguchi, Takao; Itano, Keita; Hibiya, Yuki; Suzuki, Kazue\n\n2017-03-01\n\nThe 176Lu-176Hf radioactive decay system has been widely used to study planetary crust-mantle differentiation. Of considerable utility in this regard is zircon, a resistant mineral that can be precisely dated by the U-Pb chronometer and record its initial Hf isotope composition due to having low Lu/Hf. Here we review zircon U-Pb age and Hf isotopic data mainly obtained over the last two decades and discuss their contributions to our current understanding of crust-mantle evolution, with emphasis on the Lu-Hf isotope composition of the bulk silicate Earth (BSE), early differentiation of the silicate Earth, and the evolution of the continental crust over geologic history. Meteorite zircon encapsulates the most primitive Hf isotope composition of our solar system, which was used to identify chondritic meteorites best representative of the BSE (176Hf/177Hf = 0.282793 Â± 0.000011; 176Lu/177Hf = 0.0338 Â± 0.0001). Hadean-Eoarchean detrital zircons yield highly unradiogenic Hf isotope compositions relative to the BSE, providing evidence for the development of a geochemically enriched silicate reservoir as early as 4.5 Ga. By combining the Hf and O isotope systematics, we propose that the early enriched silicate reservoir has resided at depth within the Earth rather than near the surface and may represent a fractionated residuum of a magma ocean underlying the proto-crust, like urKREEP beneath the anorthositic crust on the Moon. Detrital zircons from world major rivers potentially provide the most robust Hf isotope record of the preserved granitoid crust on a continental scale, whereas mafic rocks with various emplacement ages offer an opportunity to trace the Hf isotope evolution of juvenile continental crust (from ÎµHf[4.5 Ga] = 0 to ÎµHf[present] = + 13). The river zircon data as compared to the juvenile crust composition highlight that the supercontinent cycle has controlled the evolution of the continental crust by regulating the rates of crustal generation and intra\n\nZircon geochronology and Hf-O isotope geochemistry from granites in the Iapetus Suture Zone in Ireland and the Isle of Man\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFritschle, Tobias; Daly, J. Stephen; Whitehouse, Martin J.; McConnell, Brian; Buhre, Stephan\n\n2014-05-01\n\nLate Caledonian syn- to post-orogenic granites located in the Iapetus Suture Zone (ISZ) in Ireland and Britain have been related to A-type subduction and possible slab breakoff [1] following the Laurentia-Avalonian collision. Lack of reliable age data (especially in Ireland) has inhibited petrogenetic investigations of these rocks. Hence, ion microprobe U-Pb and oxygen isotope analyses as well as LA-MC-ICPMS Lu-Hf isotopic measurements on zircons from Irish and Isle of Man granites have been undertaken to provide better constraints on this enigmatic episode of the Caledonian Orogeny. Four stages of Late Caledonian granitic magmatism (c. 435, 417, 410 and 394 Ma) are indicated by U-Pb dating of oscillatory-zoned magmatic zircons. The Crossdoney, Kentstown, Drogheda and Ballynamuddagh granites together with a rhyolite from Glenamaddy have yielded U-Pb concordia ages, interpreted as intrusion-ages, between 419.9 Â± 4.3 Ma (Glenamaddy) and 415.8 Â± 2.0 Ma (Crossdoney) with a weighted average of 417.5 Â± 0.9 Ma (MSWD = 1.3). The Glenamaddy Granite - which intruded the Glenamaddy Rhyolite - yielded an age of 410 Â± 2.1 Ma. In addition, the Rockabill Granite yielded a younger age of 393.9 Â± 1.9 Ma, whereas the Carnsore Granite yielded an older age of 434.6 Â± 1.9 Ma. Inherited zircons (487 to 453 Ma) occur in several of the granites, and are interpreted to have been derived from Ordovician arc magmatic rocks accreted within the ISZ. A younger group of c. 440 Ma inherited zircons occurs in the c. 417 Ma Crossdoney and Ballynamuddagh granites. These grains could be related to continued or renewed Silurian arc magmatism. Hf-O isotopic measurements on the dated zircon grains range between -2 and +7 ÉHfi units and 5.5 to 8.5 o Î´18O. These are interpreted to indicate the contribution of juvenile mantle melts - possibly derived from the Ordovician arc - to some of the granites. Significant heterogeneities in zircon oxygen isotopes in at least four of the granites further\n\nOrigins and evolution of rhyolitic magmas in the central Snake River Plain: insights from coupled high-precision geochronology, oxygen isotope, and hafnium isotope analyses of zircon\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nColÃ³n, Dylan P.; Bindeman, Ilya N.; Wotzlaw, JÃ¶rn-Frederik; Christiansen, Eric H.; Stern, Richard A.\n\n2018-02-01\n\nWe present new high-precision CA-ID-TIMS and in situ U-Pb ages together with Hf and O isotopic analyses (analyses performed all on the same grains) from four tuffs from the 15-10 Ma Bruneau-Jarbidge center of the Snake River Plain and from three rhyolitic units from the Kimberly borehole in the neighboring 10-6 Ma Twin Falls volcanic center. We find significant intrasample diversity in zircon ages (ranges of up to 3 Myr) and in Î´18O (ranges of up to 6â°) and ÉHf (ranges of up to 24 É units) values. Zircon rims are also more homogeneous than the associated cores, and we show that zircon rim growth occurs faster than the resolution of in situ dating techniques. CA-ID-TIMS dating of a subset of zircon grains from the Twin Falls samples reveals complex crystallization histories spanning 104-106 years prior to some eruptions, suggesting that magma genesis was characterized by the cyclic remelting of buried volcanic rocks and intrusions associated with previous magmatic episodes. Age-dependent trends in zircon isotopic compositions show that rhyolite production in the Yellowstone hotspot track is driven by the mixing of mantle-derived melts (normal Î´18O and ÉHf) and a combination of Precambrian basement rock (normal Î´18O and ÉHf down to - 60) and shallow Mesozoic and Cenozoic age rocks, some of which are hydrothermally altered (to low Î´18O values) by earlier stages of Snake River Plain magmatism. These crustal melts hybridize with juvenile basalts and rhyolites to produce the erupted rhyolites. We also observe that the Precambrian basement rock is only an important component in the erupted magmas in the first eruption at each caldera center, suggesting that the accumulation of new intrusions quickly builds an upper crustal intrusive body which is isolated from the Precambrian basement and evolves towards more isotopically juvenile and lower-Î´18O compositions over time.\n\nRe-evaluation of the origin and evolution of > 4.2 Ga zircons from the Jack Hills metasedimentary rocks\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nNemchin, A. A.; Pidgeon, R. T.; Whitehouse, M. J.\n\n2006-04-01\n\nNew data are presented on internal structures, U-Pb systematics and oxygen isotope compositions of eight detrital zircons with ages greater than 4.2 Ga, from the Jack Hills metasedimentary belt, Australia. Cathodoluminescence imaging, ion-microprobe U-Pb and oxygen isotope results show evidence for an extensive period of complex zircon growth, secondary reaction and U-Pb isotopic disturbance from 4.36 to 3.90 Ga. In addition many of the zircons have discordant U-Pb systems and excess common Pb indicating a superimposed, relatively recent, reaction between radiation damaged zircon and low temperature fluids. The significance of oxygen isotope compositions for zircons with complex internal structures and U-Pb systems is complicated by uncertainty in the origin of the grains and the unknown effect of later reactions. However, a minority of grains with sharp oscillatory zoning, uniform and concordant U-Pb systems, igneous Th-U ratios and low common Pb contents, are interpreted as undisturbed primary magmatic zircons. The oldest identified, oscillatory zoned, magmatic grain, with an age 4363 Â± 20 Ma, is one of a few reported magmatic grains with this age, which is interpreted as the oldest reliable age for Hadean magmatic zircons. Mantle Î´18O values are reported for these zircons. Younger oscillatory zoned zircon, including oscillatory zoned cores in complex grains, have Î´18O values lower than 6.5â°, which are within the range of ion microprobe analysed Î´18O values for zircons in high temperature equilibrium with the normal mantle rocks of 5.3 Â± 0.6â° (2 standard deviations). These values are also within the range of Î´18O values found in lunar zircons. The absence of heavy oxygen in the grains that can be interpreted as primary magmatic zircons and the complex history over the period from 4.36 to 3.9 Ga, seen in all other Jack Hills zircons and reflected in the internal structures and U-Pb isotopic systems, questions the model for the early Earth involving long\n\nMagmatic oxygen fugacity estimated using zircon-melt partitioning of cerium\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSmythe, Duane J.; Brenan, James M.\n\n2016-11-01\n\nUsing a newly-calibrated relation for cerium redox equilibria in silicate melts (Smythe and Brenan, 2015), and an internally-consistent model for zircon-melt partitioning of Ce, we provide a method to estimate the prevailing redox conditions during crystallization of zircon-saturated magmas. With this approach, oxygen fugacities were calculated for samples from the Bishop tuff (USA), Toba tuff (Indonesia) and the Nain plutonic suite (Canada), which typically agree with independent estimates within one log unit or better. With the success of reproducing the fO2 of well-constrained igneous systems, we have applied our Ce-in-zircon oxygen barometer to estimating the redox state of Earth's earliest magmas. Using the composition of the Jack Hills Hadean zircons, combined with estimates of their parental magma composition, we determined the fO2 during zircon crystallization to be between FMQ -1.0 to +2.5 (where FMQ is the fayalite-magnetite-quartz buffer). Of the parental magmas considered, Archean tonalite-trondhjemite-granodiorite (TTG) compositions yield zircon-melt partitioning most similar to well-constrained modern suites (e.g., Sano et al., 2002). Although broadly consistent with previous redox estimates from the Jack Hills zircons, our results provide a more precise determination of fO2, narrowing the range for Hadean parental magmas by more than 8 orders of magnitude. Results suggest that relatively oxidized magmatic source regions, similar in oxidation state to that of 3.5 Ga komatiite suites, existed by â¼4.4 Ga.\n\nMagmatic and Crustal Differentiation History of Granitic Rocks from Hf-O Isotopes in Zircon\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKemp, , A.

J.\n\n2007-02-01\n\nGranitic plutonism is the principal agent of crustal differentiation, but linking granite emplacement to crust formation requires knowledge of the magmatic evolution, which is notoriously difficult to reconstruct from bulk rock compositions. We unlocked the plutonic archive through hafnium (Hf) and oxygen (O) isotope analysis of zoned zircon crystals from the classic hornblende-bearing (I-type) granites of eastern Australia. This granite type forms by the reworking of sedimentary materials by mantle-like magmas instead of by remelting ancient metamorphosed igneous rocks as widely believed. I-type magmatism thus drives the coupled growth and differentiation of continental crust.\n\nU-Pb ages and Hf isotope compositions of zircons in plutonic rocks from the central Famatinian arc, Argentina\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nOtamendi, Juan E.; Ducea, Mihai N.; Cristofolini, Eber A.; Tibaldi, Alina M.; Camilletti, Giuliano C.; Bergantz, George W.\n\n2017-07-01\n\nThe Famatinian arc formed around the South Iapetus rim during the Ordovician, when oceanic lithosphere subducted beneath the West Gondwana margin. We present combined in situ U-Th-Pb and Lu-Hf isotope analyses for zircon to gain insights into the origin and evolution of Famatinian magmatism. Zircon crystals sampled from four intermediate and silicic plutonic rocks confirm previous observations showing that voluminous magmatism took place during a relatively short pulse between the Early and Middle Ordovician (472-465 Ma). The entire zircon population for the four plutonic rocks yields coherent ÎµHf negative values and spreads over several ranges of initial ÎµHf(t) units (-0.3 to -8.0). The range of ÎµHf units in detrital zircons of Famatinian metasedimentary rocks reflects a prolonged history of the cratonic sources during the Proterozoic to the earliest Phanerozoic. Typical tonalites and granodiorites that contain zircons with evolved Hf isotopic compositions formed upon incorporating (meta)sedimentary materials into calc-alkaline metaluminous magmas. The evolved Hf isotope ratios of zircons in the subduction related plutonic rocks strongly reflect the Hf isotopic character of the metasedimentary contaminant, even though the linked differentiation and growth of the Famatinian arc crust was driven by ascending and evolving mantle magmas. Geochronology and Hf isotope systematics in plutonic zircons allow us understanding the petrogenesis of igneous series and the provenance of magma sources. However, these data could be inadequate for computing model ages and supporting models of crustal evolution.\n\nAn ion microprobe study of individual zircon phenocrysts from voluminous post-caldera rhyolites of the Yellowstone caldera\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWatts, K. E.; Bindeman, I. N.; Schmitt, A. K.\n\n2010-12-01\n\nFollowing the formation of the Yellowstone caldera from the 640 ka supereruption of the Lava Creek Tuff (LCT), a voluminous episode of post-caldera volcanism filled the caldera with >600 km3 of low-Î´18O rhyolite. Such low-Î´18O signatures require remelting of 100s of km3 of hydrothermally altered (18O-depleted) rock in the shallow crust. We present a high resolution oxygen isotope and geochronology (U-Th and U-Pb) study of individual zircon crystals from seven of these voluminous post-caldera rhyolites in order to elucidate their genesis. Oxygen isotope and geochronology analyses of zircon were performed with an ion microprobe that enabled us to doubly fingerprint 25-30 Âµm diameter spots. Host groundmass glasses and coexisting quartz were analyzed in bulk for oxygen isotopes by laser fluorination. We find that zircons from the youngest (200-80 ka) post-caldera rhyolites have oxygen isotopic compositions that are in equilibrium with low-Î´18O host groundmass glasses and quartz and are unzoned in oxygen and U-Th age. This finding is in contrast to prior work on older (500-250 ka) post-caldera rhyolites, which exhibit isotopic disequilibria and age zoning, including the presence of clearly inherited zircon cores. Average U-Th crystallization ages and Î´18O zircon values for Pitchstone Plateau flow (81Â±7 ka, 2.8Â±0.2â°), West Yellowstone flow (118Â±8 ka, 2.8Â±0.1â°), Elephant Back flow (175Â±22 ka, 2.7Â±0.2â°) and Tuff of Bluff Point (176Â±20 ka, 2.7Â±0.1â°) are overlapping or nearly overlapping in age and identical in oxygen isotope composition within uncertainty (2 SE). New U-Pb geochronology and oxygen isotope data for the North Biscuit Basin flow establish that it has an age (188Â±33 ka) and Î´18O signature (2.8Â±0.2â°) that is distinctive of the youngest post-caldera rhyolites. Conversely, the South Biscuit Basin flow has a heterogeneous zircon population with ages that range from 550-250 ka. In this unit, older and larger (200-400 Âµm) zircons have more\n\nOxygen isotopes reveal crustal contamination and a large, still partially molten magma chamber in ChaÃ®ne des Puys (French Massif Central)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFrance, LydÃ©ric; Demacon, Mickael; Gurenko, Andrey A.; Briot, Danielle\n\n2016-09-01\n\nThe two main magmatic properties associated with explosive eruptions are high viscosity of silica-rich magmas and/or high volatile contents. Magmatic processes responsible for the genesis of such magmas are differentiation through crystallization, and crustal contamination (or assimilation) as this process has the potential to enhance crystallization and add volatiles to the initial budget. In the ChaÃ®ne des Puy series (French Massif Central), silica- and H2O-rich magmas were only emitted during the most recent eruptions (ca. 6-15 ka). Here, we use in situ measurements of oxygen isotopes in zircons from two of the main trachytic eruptions from the ChaÃ®ne des Puys to track the crustal contamination component in a sequence that was previously presented as an archetypal fractional crystallization series. Zircons from Sarcoui volcano and Puy de DÃ´me display homogeneous oxygen isotope compositions with Î´18O = 5.6 Â± 0.25â° and 5.6 Â± 0.3â°, respectively, and have therefore crystallized from homogeneous melts with Î´18Omelt = 7.1 Â± 0.3â°. Compared to mantle derived melts resulting from pure fractional crystallization (Î´18Odif.mant. = 6.4 Â± 0.4â°), those Î´18Omelt values are enriched in 18O and support a significant role of crustal contamination in the genesis of silica-rich melts in the ChaÃ®ne des Puys. Assimilation-fractional-crystallization models highlight that the degree of contamination was probably restricted to 5.5-9.5% with Rcrystallization/Rassimilation varying between 8 and 14. The very strong intra-site homogeneity of the isotopic data highlights that magmas were well homogenized before eruption, and consequently that crustal contamination was not the trigger of silica-rich eruptions in the ChaÃ®ne des Puys. The exceptionally strong inter-site homogeneity of the isotopic data brings to light that Sarcoui volcano and Puy de DÃ´me were fed by a single large magma chamber. Our results, together with recent thermo-kinetic models and an experimental\n\nCorrelated microanalysis of zircon: Trace element, Î´ 18O, and U-Th-Pb isotopic constraints on the igneous origin of complex >3900 Ma detrital grains\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCavosie, Aaron J.; Valley, John W.; Wilde, Simon A.; E. I. M. F.\n\n2006-11-01\n\nThe origins of >3900 Ma detrital zircons from Western Australia are controversial, in part due to their complexity and long geologic histories. Conflicting interpretations for the genesis of these zircons propose magmatic, hydrothermal, or metamorphic origins. To test the hypothesis that these zircons preserve magmatic compositions, trace elements [rare earth elements (REE), Y, P, Th, U] were analyzed by ion microprobe from a suite of >3900 Ma zircons from Jack Hills, Western Australia, and include some of the oldest detrital zircons known (4400-4300 Ma). The same Ë20 Î¼m domains previously characterized for U/Pb age, oxygen isotope composition (Î´ 18O), and cathodoluminescence (CL) zoning were specifically targeted for analysis. The zircons are classified into two types based on the light-REE (LREE) composition of the domain analyzed. Zircons with Type 1 domains form the largest group (37 of 42), consisting of grains that preserve evolved REE compositions typical of igneous zircon from crustal rocks. Grains with Type 1 domains display a wide range of CL zoning patterns, yield nearly concordant U/Pb ages from 4400 to 3900 Ma, and preserve a narrow range of Î´ 18O values from 4.7â° to 7.3â° that overlap or are slightly elevated relative to mantle oxygen isotope composition. Type 1 domains are interpreted to preserve magmatic compositions. Type 2 domains occur in six zircons that contain spots with enriched light-REE (LREE) compositions, here defined as having chondrite normalized values of La N > 1 and Pr N > 10. A subset of analyses in Type 2 domains appear to result from incorporation of sub-surface mineral inclusions in the analysis volume, as evidenced by positively correlated secondary ion beam intensities for LREE, P, and Y, which are anti-correlated to Si, although not all Type 2 analyses show these features. The LREE enrichment also occurs in areas with discordant U/Pb ages and/or high Th/U ratios, and is apparently associated with past or present\n\nContrasting Cu-Au and Sn-W Granite Metallogeny through the Zircon Geochemical and Isotopic Record\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGardiner, Nicholas; Hawkesworth, Chris; Robb, Laurence; Whitehouse, Martin; Roberts, Nick; Kirkland, Chris\n\n2017-04-01\n\nMagmatic genesis and evolution - mediated by geodynamic setting - exert a primary control on the propensity of granites to be metal fertile. A revolution in our understanding of these petrogenetic processes has been made through a range of mineral-based tools, most notably the common accessory mineral zircon. There is consequently considerable interest in whether the geochemical and isotopic compositions of zircon can be applied to metallogenic problems. The paired magmatic belts of Myanmar have broadly contrasting metallogenic affinities (Sn-W versus Cu-Au), and are interpreted to have formed on the accretionary margin of the subducting Neo-Tethys Ocean. They therefore present the opportunity to geochemically compare and contrast the zircon compositions in two end-member types of granite-hosted mineral deposits generated in collisional settings. We present an integrated zircon isotope (U-Pb, Lu-Hf, O) and trace element dataset that fingerprint: (a) source; (b) redox conditions; and (c) degree of fractionation. These variables all impact on magma fertility, and our key question to address is whether they can be reliably traced and calibrated within the Myanmar zircon record. Granitoid-hosted zircons from the I-type copper arc have juvenile ÉHf (+7 to +12) and mantle-like Î´18O (5.3 â°), whereas zircons from the S-type tin belt have low ÉHf (-7 to -13) and heavier Î´18O (6.2-7.7 â°). Plotting Hf versus U/Yb reaffirms that the tin belt magmas contain greater crustal contributions than the copper arc rocks. Links between whole rock Rb/Sr and zircon Eu/Eu* highlights that the latter can be used to monitor magma fractionation in systems that crystallize plagioclase (low Sr/Y). Ce/Ce* and Eu/Eu* in zircon are thus sensitive to redox and fractionation respectively, and can be used to evaluate the sensitivity of zircons to the metallogenic affinity of their host rocks. Tin contents that exceed the solubility limit are required in order to make a magmatic\n\nUsing Oxygen Isotopes of Zircon to Evaluate Magmatic Evolution and Crustal Contamination in the Halifax Pluton, Nova Scotia\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMurray, K. E.; Lackey, J.; Valley, J. W.; Nowak, R.\n\n2007-12-01\n\nOxygen isotope analysis of zircon (Zrc) is well suited for parsing out the magmatic history in granitoids. The Halifax pluton is the largest pluton (1060 km2) in the peraluminous South Mountain batholith. The Halifax pluton is mapped as a concentrically zoned body, with outer units comprising granodiorite, monzogranite and a mafic porphyry; these units are locally rich in metasedimentary xenoliths and magmatic enclaves. The exterior units surround a more felsic core of leucogranite [1]. Previous oxygen isotope studies of the pluton report high whole rock Î´18O values that range from 10.7-11.7â° [2], and indicate a significant supracrustal component in the source of the pluton. We report the first Î´18O(Zrc) values from the Peggy's Cove monzogranite and an associated mafic porphyry. Samples were collected across 30 km of discontinuous exposures of the monzogranite. Values of Î´18O(Zrc) vary from 7.71-8.26â° (average = 8.15Â±Â±0.32â°(2 S.D.); n = 10). Small but systematic E-W regional variation in Î´18O(Zrc) values suggests heterogeneous magmatic contamination within the monzogranite. Meter-scale magmatic enclaves, observed in close association with pods of diverse xenoliths and smaller enclaves at the western Cranberry Head locality, are slightly enriched in Î´18O relative to the host monzogranite. These data combined support a model of magma mingling and heterogeneous mixing at the rim of the pluton, with contamination by high-Î´18O rocks. Additional high-Î´18O(Zrc) data from granodiorites on the northern margin of the Halifax pluton concur with these observations [3]. Typically, closed magmatic systems show increasing Î´18O with SiO2 because more felsic magmas have a greater percentage of high-Î´18O minerals such as quartz and feldspar. Thus, the Halifax pluton appears to exhibit an enrichment trend opposite of what would be expected of a closed evolving system. Emplacement mechanisms for the Halifax pluton proposed by previous workers suggest that the outer\n\nZircon U-Pb, O, and Hf isotopic constraints on Mesozoic magmatism in the Cyclades, Aegean Sea, Greece\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFu, Bin; BrÃ¶cker, Michael; Ireland, Trevor; Holden, Peter; Kinsley, Leslie P. J.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nCompared to the well-documented Cenozoic magmatic and metamorphic rocks of the Cyclades, Aegean Sea, Greece, the geodynamic context of older meta-igneous rocks occurring in the marble-schist sequences and mÃ©langes of the Cycladic Blueschist Unit is as yet not fully understood. Here, we report O-Hf isotopic compositions of zircons ranging in age from ca. 320 Ma to ca. 80 Ma from metamorphic rocks exposed on the islands of Andros, Ios, Sifnos, and Syros with special emphasis on Triassic source rocks. Ion microprobe (SHRIMP II) single spot oxygen isotope analysis of pre-Cretaceous zircons from various felsic gneisses and meta-gabbros representing both the marble-schist sequences and the mÃ©langes of the study area yielded a large range in Î´18O values, varying from 2.7 â° to 10.1 â° VSMOW, with one outlier at -0.4 %. Initial ÉHf values (-12.5 to +15.7) suggest diverse sources for melts formed between Late Carboniferous to Late Cretaceous time that record derivation from mantle and reworked older continental crust. In particular, variable Î´18O and ÉHf( t) values for Triassic igneous zircons suggest that magmatism of this age is more likely rift- than subduction-related. The significant crustal component in 160 Ma meta-gabbros from Andros implies that some Jurassic gabbroic rocks of the Hellenides are not part of SSZ-type (supra-subduction zone) ophiolites that are common elsewhere along the margin of the Pelagonian zone.\n\nZircon Hf-O isotopic constraints on the origin of Late Mesozoic felsic volcanic rocks from the Great Xing'an Range, NE China\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGong, Mingyue; Tian, Wei; Fu, Bin; Wang, Shuangyue; Dong, Jinlong\n\n2018-05-01\n\nThe voluminous Late Mesozoic magmatism was related to extensive re-melting of juvenile materials that were added to the Central East Asia continent in Phanerozoic time. The most favoured magma generation mechanism of Late Mesozoic magmas is partial melting of underplated lower crust that had radiogenic Hf-Nd isotopic characteristics, but this mechanism faces difficulties when interpreting other isotopic data. The tectonic environment controlling the generation of the Late Mesozoic felsic magmas is also in dispute. In this study, we obtained new U-Pb ages, and geochemical and isotopic data of representative Jurassic (154.4 Â± 1.5 Ma) and Cretaceous (140.2 Â± 1.5 Ma) felsic volcanic samples. The Jurassic sample has inherited zircon cores of Permian age, with depleted mantle-like ÎµHf(t) of +7.4 - +8.5, which is in contrast with those of the magmatic zircons (ÎµHf(t) = +2.4 Â± 0.7). Whereas the inherited cores and the magmatic zircons have identical mantle-like Î´18O composition ranges (4.25-5.29â° and 4.69-5.54â°, respectively). These Hf-O isotopic characteristics suggest a mixed source of enriched mantle materials rather than ancient crustal components and a depleted mantle source represented by the inherited Permian zircon core. This mechanism is manifested by the eruption of Jurassic alkaline basalts originated from an enriched mantle source. The Cretaceous sample has high ÎµHf(t) of +7.0 - +10.5, suggesting re-melting of a mafic magma derived from a depleted mantle-source. However, the sub-mantle zircon Î´18O values (3.70-4.58â°) suggest the depleted mantle-derived mafic source rocks had experienced high temperature hydrothermal alteration at upper crustal level. Therefore, the Cretaceous felsic magma, if not all, could be generated by re-melting of down-dropped supracrustal volcanic rocks that experienced high temperature oxygen isotope alteration. The two processes, enriched mantle-contribution and supracrustal juvenile material re-melting, are new\n\nCreation of a continent recorded in zircon zoning\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nMoser, D.E.; Bowman, J.R.; Wooden, J.; Valley, J.W.; Mazdab, F.; Kita, N.\n\n2008-01-01\n\nWe have discovered a robust microcrystalline record of the early genesis of North American lithosphere preserved in the U-Pb age and oxygen isotope zoning of zircons from a lower crustal paragneiss in the Neoarchean Superior province. Detrital igneous zircon cores with ??18O values of 5.1???-7.1??? record creation of primitive to increasingly evolved crust from 2.85 ?? 0.02 Ga to 2.67 ?? 0.02 Ga. Sharp chemical unconformity between cores and higher ??18O (8.4???-10.4???) metamorphic overgrowths as old as 2.66 ?? 0.01 Ga dictates a rapid sequence of arc unroofing, burial of detrital zircons in hydrosphere-altered sediment, and transport to lower crust late in upper plate assembly. The period to 2.58 ?? 0.01 Ga included ???80 m.y. of high-temperature (???700-650 ??C), nearly continuous overgrowth events reflecting stages in maturation of the subjacent mantle root. Huronian continental rifting is recorded by the youngest zircon tip growth at 2512 ?? 8 Ma (??? 600 ??C) signaling magma intraplating and the onset of rigid plate behavior.

Grib kimberlite (Arkhangelsk region, NW Russia): Evidence from mineral geochemistry and the U-Pb and Lu-Hf isotope compositions of zircon\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nShchukina, Elena V.; Agashev, Alexey M.; Zedgenizov, Dmitry A.\n\n2018-05-01\n\nThe concentrations of major and trace elements in minerals, reconstructed whole-rock compositions of zircon-bearing equigranular eclogites from the V. Grib kimberlite pipe located within the Arkhangelsk Diamondiferous Province (North-Western Russia), and results of the U-Pb and Lu-Hf isotope analyses of zircon grains from eclogites and granulite xenoliths are reported. These data suggest that the equigranular eclogites could represent the fragments of mid-ocean-ridge basalt that were metamorphosed during Paleoproterozoic subduction at 1.7-1.9 Ga. The Hf isotope compositions of the eclogitic zircon display uniformity and indicate corresponding Hf-depleted mantle model ages of 2.2-2.3 Ga. The formation of zircon in eclogites could have resulted from interactions with metasomatic/subduction-related fluids just prior to, but associated with, Paleoproterozoic eclogite formation. A link between eclogitic zircon formation and continental lower-crustal rocks can be excluded based on differences in the Hf isotope compositions of eclogitic and granulitic zircon grains. The U-Pb upper intercept age of granulitic zircon of 2716 Â± 61 Ma provides a new minimum age constraint for zircon crystallisation and granulite formation. The U-Pb ages obtained from granulitic zircon show two stages of Pb loss at 2.2-2.6 Ga and 1.7-2.0 Ga. The late Paleoproterozoic stage of Pb loss recorded in granulitic zircon is due to the intensive reworking of basement crustal rocks, which was caused by a tectonic process/subduction event associated with equigranular eclogite formation. Our data, along with evidence previously obtained from the V. Grib pipe coarse-granular eclogites, show at least two main subduction events in the lithospheric mantle of the Arkhangelsk region: the Archean (2.8 Ga) and Paleoproterozoic (1.7-1.9 Ga) subductions, which correspond to major magmatic and metamorphic events in the Baltic Shield.\n\nThe first Lu-Hf zircon isotope data for gabbro-diorite-tonalite associations of the Urals\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRonkin, Yu.

S.; Gerdes, A.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe Lu-Hf isotope systematics of zircon from the gabbro-plagiogranite association (gabbro, diorite, tonalite, and plagiogranite), which is one of the most typical associations of igneous rocks in the Urals, was studied for the first time. The isotope study yielded a unified age limit of 433 Ma, which corresponds to the time of formation of this rock association. The younger \"rejuvenated\" ages characterize superimposed thermal impact events, induced by the volcanic arc activity, as well as collisional and postcollisional processes. Here, the initial 176Hf/177Hf( t) ratio in the studied zircon from gabbro and plagiogranite corresponds in fact to a highly LILE-depleted (DM) mantle.\n\nPetrogenesis of Mesozoic granites in the Xitian, South China: Evidence from whole-rock geochemistry and zircon isotopes\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLiu, Q.; Sun, J.; He, M.; Hou, Q.; Niu, R.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nMesozoic granitoids are widespread in southeastern China, which accompanied with lots of world-famous polymetallic deposits. The mineralization is believed to be related to the Mesozoic granitic magmatism. However, the petrogenesis of these granites and their relation to the mineralization are still debated. As a typical granitic pluton, Xitian granites from the eastern Hunan Province are formed during this period and associated with tungsten-tin deposit. Whole-rock geochemical, SIMS zircon geochronology and oxygen isotopes, as well as LA-ICPMS zircon Lu-Hf isotopic analyses, were carried out on a suite of rocks from Xitian granitic pluton to constrain their magmatic sources and petrogenesis. Xitian granitic pluton is mainly composed of biotite adamellite, biotite granite, fine-grained granite. SIMS and LA-ICPMS U-Pb dating of zircons indicate that there are two episodes of these rocks, i.e., Late Triassic granites (227-233Ma) and Late Jurassic granites (150-154Ma). The Xitian granites are silica-rich, potassic and weakly peraluminous. Petrographic and geochemical features show that they are highly fractionated I-type granites. The combined elemental and isotopic results indicated that the Late Triassic granite in Xitian area experienced a process of crystal fractionation of crustal-derived magmas coupled with strong assimilation of the surrounding rocks. The occurrence of Jurassic granitoids in Xitian area is attributed to ascending of mantle-derived magmas, which provide heat for partial melting of crustal materials. The Late Jurassic granite may be derived from juvenile crust or partial melting of ancient crustal rocks, whereas high degrees of crystal fractionation further enriched tungsten-tin in the evolved granitic rocks.

Z.; Zhang, W. Q.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nHole U1473A was drilled to 790 meters below seafloor on the Atlantis Bank, an oceanic core complex in the Southwest Indian Ridge, where the upper crust has been removed by detachment faulting. The recovered core consists dominantly of olivine gabbro, with subordinate gabbro, gabbro with varying Fe-Ti oxide concentrations. Felsic veins intermittently occur throughout the whole core section. Zircons separated from twenty-four felsic samples have been conducted for U-Pb dating and O isotope analyses on the Cameca 1280 and Lu-Hf isotopes by laser ablation coupled with a MC-ICPMS. The zircons have highly variable contents of U (12-2078 ppm) and Th (5-801 ppm), yielding Th/U ratios of 0.33-0.81. They are typical oceanic zircons as defined by the trace element discrimination plots of Grimes et al. (2015). The weighted mean 206Pb/238U ages of the analyzed zircons vary from 11.29 to 12.57 Ma. Age differences between felsic veins throughout the whole core are not resolved within analytical uncertainty of the SIMS measurements. All felsic samples have similar zircon Hf isotope compositions, with initial 176Hf/177Hf ratios of 0.283126-0.283197 and ÉHf values of 12.76-15.27. Zircons from all felsic samples but one have mantle-like Î´18O values of 5.14-5.50â°. Zircons from one sample show partial resorption or total recrystallization; in comparison, they have lower Î´18O values of 4.81Â±0.21â°. Such characteristics provide clear evidence for hydrothermal alteration after magmatic intrusion.\n\nTriple oxygen isotope composition of photosynthetic oxygen\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nvan der Meer, Anne; Kaiser, Jan\n\n2013-04-01\n\nThe measurement of biological production rates is essential for our understanding how marine ecosystems are sustained and how much CO2 is taken up through aquatic photosynthesis. Traditional techniques to measure marine production are laborious and subject to systematic errors. A biogeochemical approach based on triple oxygen isotope measurements in dissolved oxygen (O2) has been developed over the last few years, which allows the derivation of gross productivity integrated over the depth of the mixed layer and the time-scale of O2 gas exchange (Luz and Barkan, 2000). This approach exploits the relative 17O/16O and 18O/16O isotope ratio differences of dissolved O2 compared to atmospheric O2 to work out the rate of biological production. Two parameters are key for this calculation: the isotopic composition of dissolved O2 in equilibrium with air and the isotopic composition of photosynthetic oxygen. Recently, a controversy has emerged in the literature over these parameters (Kaiser, 2011) and one of the goals of this research is to provide additional data to resolve this controversy. In order to obtain more information on the isotopic signature of biological oxygen, laboratory experiments have been conducted to determine the isotopic composition of oxygen produced by different phytoplankton cultures.\n\nTectono-magmatic evolution of the Chihuahua-Sinaloa border region in northern Mexico: Insights from zircon-apatite U-Pb geochronology, zircon Hf isotope composition and geochemistry of granodiorite intrusions\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMahar, Munazzam Ali; Goodell, Philip C.; Feinstein, Michael Nicholas\n\n2016-11-01\n\nWe present the whole-rock geochemistry, LA-ICP-MS zircon-apatite U-Pb ages and zircon Hf isotope composition of the granodioritic plutons at the southwestern boundary of Chihuahua with the states of Sinaloa and Sonora. These granodiorites are exposed in the north and south of the Rio El Fuerte in southwest Chihuahua and northern Sinaloa. The magmatism spans over a time period of 37 Ma from 90 to 53 Ma. Zircons are exclusively magmatic with strong oscillatory zoning. No inheritance of any age has been observed. Our new U-Pb dating ( 250 analyses) does not support the involvement of older basement lithologies in the generation of the granitic magmas. The U-Pb apatite ages from granodiorites in southwest Chihuahua vary from 52 to 70 Ma. These apatite ages are 1 to 20 Ma younger than the corresponding zircon U-Pb crystallization ages, suggesting variable cooling rates from very fast to 15 Â°C/Ma ( 800 Â°C to 500 Â°C) and shallow to moderate emplacement depths. In contrast, U-Pb apatite ages from the Sinaloa batholith are restricted from 64 to 61 Ma and are indistinguishable from the zircon U-Pb ages range from 67 to 60 Ma within the error, indicating rapid cooling and very shallow emplacement. However, one sample from El Realito showed a larger difference of 20 Ma in zircon-apatite age pair: zircon 80 Â± 0.8 Ma and apatite 60.6 Â± 4 Ma, suggesting a slower cooling rate of 15 Â°C/Ma. The weighted mean initial ÎµHf (t) isotope composition (2Ï) of granodiorites varies from + 1.8 to + 5.2. The radiogenic Hf isotope composition coupled with previous Sr-Nd isotope data demonstrates a significant shift from multiple crustal sources in the Sonoran batholithic belt to the predominant contribution of the mantle-derived magmas in the southwest Chihuahua and northern Sinaloa. Based on U-Pb ages, the absence of inheritance, typical high Th/U ratio and radiogenic Hf isotope composition, we suggest that the Late Cretaceous-Paleogene magmatic rocks in this region are not derived from\n\nContrasting sources of Late Paleozoic rhyolite magma in the Polish Lowlands: evidence from U-Pb ages and Hf and O isotope composition in zircon\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSÅodczyk, ElÅ¼bieta; Pietranik, Anna; Glynn, Sarah; Wiedenbeck, Michael; Breitkreuz, Christoph; Dhuime, Bruno\n\n2018-02-01\n\nThe Polish Lowlands, located southwest of the Teisseyre-Tornquist Zone, within Trans-European Suture Zone, were affected by bimodal, but dominantly rhyolitic, magmatism during the Late Paleozoic. Thanks to the inherited zircon they contain, these rhyolitic rocks provide a direct source of information about the pre-Permian rocks underlying the Polish Lowland. This paper presents zircon U-Pb geochronology and Hf and O isotopic results from five drill core samples representing four rhyolites and one granite. Based on the ratio of inherited vs. autocrystic zircon, the rhyolites can be divided into two groups: northern rhyolites, where autocrystic zircon is more abundant and southern rhyolites, where inherited zircon dominates. We suggest that the magma sources and the processes responsible for generating high silica magmas differ between the northern and southern rhyolites. Isotopically distinct sources were available during formation of northern rhyolites, as the Hf and O isotopes in magmatic zircon differ between the two analysed localities of northern rhyolites. A mixing between magmas formed from Baltica-derived mudstone-siltstone sediments and Avalonian basement or mantle can explain the diversity between the zircon compositions from the northern localities Daszewo and Wysoka KamieÅska. Conversely, the southern rhyolites from our two localities contain zircon with similar compositions, and these units can be further correlated with results from the North East German Basin, suggesting uniform source rocks over this larger region. Based on the ages of inherited zircon and the isotopic composition of magmatic ones, we suggest that the dominant source of the southern rhyolites is Variscan foreland sediments mixed with Baltica/Avalonia-derived sediments.\n\nGHR1 - A new Eocene natural reference material for U-Pb and Hf isotopic measurements in zircon\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nIbanez-Mejia, M.; Eddy, M. P.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nWe present chemical abrasion-isotope dilution-thermal ionization (CA-ID-TIMS) U-Pb zircon geochronology and solution multicollector-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS) Hf isotopic data from a proposed natural zircon reference material for use during in situ analyses of U-Pb and Hf isotopic ratios. The sample, GHR1, was collected from the rapakivi intrusive phase of the Eocene Golden Horn batholith in Washington, USA. Zircons separated from this sample range up to 250-300 Î¼m in length and have moderate aspect ratios. A weighted mean of 15 Th-corrected 206Pb/238U zircon dates from GHR1 produced at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is 48.132 Â± 0.023 Ma (2Ï analytical and tracer uncertainties only, MSWD=1.70) confirming that there is little or no inter-crystal age heterogeneity at the scale of a few 10 kyr. Solution MC-ICP-MS measurements of chemically purified aliquots give a 176Hf/177Hf weighted mean of 0.283050 Â± 17 (2Ï, n=10), corresponding to a ÉHf0 of ca. +9.3. The 2Ï variability of these measurements is comparable to our reproducibility of the JMC-475 Hf isotopic standard 0.282160 Â± 14 (n= 13), suggesting that GHR1 zircons are homogenous with respect to 176Hf/177Hf. In situ 206Pb/238U dates from collaborating secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), sensitive high-resolution ion microprobe (SHRIMP), and laser ablation ICP-MS (LA-ICP-MS) laboratories are in excellent agreement with the CA-ID-TIMS date and illustrate the reproducibility and potential value of this reference zircon. The mean values of 176Hf/177Hf measurements from two LA-ICP-MS laboratories are in agreement with the solution MC-ICP-MS value, but show slightly greater dispersion and higher (Lu+Yb)/Hf values. We attribute this discrepancy to apatite inclusions that are high in REE and may lead to greater isobaric interferences on 176Hf. These inclusions and potential isobaric interferences from REE were removed during the chemical abrasion step prior to bulk\n\nMagma mixing and the generation of isotopically juvenile silicic magma at Yellowstone caldera inferred from coupling 238Uâ230Th ages with trace elements and Hf and O isotopes in zircon and Pb isotopes in sanidine\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nStelten, Mark E.; Cooper, Kari M.; Vazquez, Jorge A.; Reid, Mary R.; Barfod, Gry H.; Wimpenny, Josh; Yin, Qing-Zhu\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThe nature of compositional heterogeneity within large silicic magma bodies has important implications for how silicic reservoirs are assembled and evolve through time. We examine compositional heterogeneity in the youngest (~170 to 70 ka) post-caldera volcanism at Yellowstone caldera, the Central Plateau Member (CPM) rhyolites, as a case study. We compare 238Uâ230Th age, trace-element, and Hf isotopic data from zircons, and major-element, Ba, and Pb isotopic data from sanidines hosted in two CPM rhyolites (Hayden Valley and Solfatara Plateau flows) and one extracaldera rhyolite (Gibbon River flow), all of which erupted near the caldera margin ca. 100 ka. The Hayden Valley flow hosts two zircon populations and one sanidine population that are consistent with residence in the CPM reservoir. The Gibbon River flow hosts one zircon population that is compositionally distinct from Hayden Valley flow zircons. The Solfatara Plateau flow contains multiple sanidine populations and all three zircon populations found in the Hayden Valley and Gibbon River flows, demonstrating that the Solfatara Plateau flow formed by mixing extracaldera magma with the margin of the CPM reservoir. This process highlights the dynamic nature of magmatic interactions at the margins of large silicic reservoirs. More generally, Hf isotopic data from the CPM zircons provide the first direct evidence for isotopically juvenile magmas contributing mass to the youngest post-caldera magmatic system and demonstrate that the sources contributing magma to the CPM reservoir were heterogeneous in 176Hf/177Hf at ca. 100 ka. Thus, the limited compositional variability of CPM glasses reflects homogenization occurring within the CPM reservoir, not a homogeneous source.\n\nApplying the Ce-in-zircon oxygen geobarometer to diverse silicic magmatic systems\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nClaiborne, L. L.; Miller, C. F.\n\n2012-12-01\n\nZircon provides information on age, temperature, and composition of the magma from which it grew. In systems such as Mount St. Helens, where zircon is not coeval with the rest of the crystal cargo, it provides the only accessible record of the extended history of the magmatic system, including cycles of intrusion, crystallization and rejuvenation beneath an active volcano (Claiborne et al., 2010). The rare earth elements, which are present in measureable quantities in zircon, provide information about the composition of the magma from which zircon grew. Unique among the generally trivalent rare earth elements, cerium can exist as either trivalent or tetravalent, depending on the oxidation state of the magma. The tetravalent ion is highly compatible in zircon, in the site that usually hosts tetravalent zirconium, and so the amount of Cerium in zircon relative (relative to what would be expected of trivalent Ce) depends the oxidation state of the magma from which it grew. Trail et al. (2011) proposed a calibration based on experimental data that uses the Ce anomaly in zircon as a direct proxy for magma oxidation (fugacity), describing the relationship between Ce in zircon and magma oxygen fugacity as ln(Ce/Ce*)D = (0.1156Â±0.0050)xln(fO2)+(13860Â±708)/T-(6.125Â±0.484). For systems like Mount St. Helens, where the major minerals record only events in the hundreds to thousands of years leading to eruption, (including the Fe-Ti oxides traditionally relied upon for records of oxidation state of the magmas), this presents a novel approach for understanding more extended histories of oxidation of magmas in the tens and hundreds of thousands of years of magmatism at a volcanic center. This calibration also promises to help us better constrain conditions of crystallization in intrusive portions of volcanic systems, as well as plutonic bodes. We apply this new oxygen geobarometer to natural volcanic and plutonic zircons from a variety of tectonic settings, and compare to\n\nZircon trace element and isotopic (Sr, Nd, Hf, Pb) effects of assimilation-fractional crystallization of pegmatite magma: A case study of the Guangshigou biotite pegmatites from the North Qinling Orogen, central China\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nYuan, Feng; Liu, Jia-Jun; Carranza, Emmanuel John M.; Zhang, Shuai; Zhai, De-Gao; Liu, Gang; Wang, Gong-Wen; Zhang, Hong-Yuan; Sha, Ya-Zhou; Yang, Shang-Song\n\n2018-03-01\n\nEvidence for open-system magmatic processes related to wallrock assimilation accompanied by fractional crystallization (AFC) is present in the Guangshigou biotite pegmatites, North Qinling Orogen. The biotite pegmatite-gneiss contacts generally coincide with the greatest enrichment of U and Th. Zircon Usbnd Pb dating constrains the crystallization ages of the biotite pegmatite (rim zone-415 Â± 2.6 Ma; internal zone-413.5 Â± 2.5 Ma), in line with a pyrite Pbsbnd Pb isochron age (413 Â± 22 Ma). Metamict areas in zircon show generally elevated concentrations of trace elements and expulsion of radioactive Pb. Internal zone samples, representing uncontaminated magma, have negative to positive zircon ( 413 Ma) ÎµHf(t) (- 1.53 - + 3.24), low ÎµNd(t) values (- 2.4), and old Hf and Nd model ages (tDM2 = 1.5-1.19 Ga, T2DM = 1.35 Ga, respectively), indicating a dominantly recycled Mesoproterozoic lower crustal material with involvement of some juvenile materials in the source region. The magmatic oxygen fugacity (fO2) and crystallization temperatures ranges from - 24.81 to - 13.34 of log fO2 and 570 Â°C to 793 Â°C, respectively. Compared to the internal zone, pegmatite rim samples display a variable and lower ÎµNd(t) values (- 3.9 to - 2.8) and T2DM (1.47-1.37 Ga), but similar Hf isotopic compositions, favouring a three-component isotopic mixing model (recycled Mesoproterozoic lower crust materials, juvenile materials, and host gneiss). Pronounced variations of Ti, Y, U, Th, Hf, and REE concentrations in zircon from grain to grain in individual samples and from area to area within individual grains suggest a fluctuating crystallization environment in hybridized magma from which the rim-hosted zircons crystallized. Variable and high radiogenic Pb ratios of pyrites forming in the hybridized magma were inherited from the matrix. Zircons from both zones exhibit similar Hf isotope patterns, indicating the rim-hosted zircons crystallized during the early stage of hybridization of\n\nZircon U-Pb geochronology and Sr-Nd-Pb-Hf isotopic constraints on the timing and origin of Mesozoic granitoids hosting the Mo deposits in northern Xilamulun district, NE China\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nShu, Qihai; Lai, Yong; Zhou, Yitao; Xu, Jiajia; Wu, Huaying\n\n2015-12-01\n\nLocated in the east section of the Central Asian orogen in northeastern China, the Xilamulun district comprises several newly discovered molybdenum deposits, primarily of porphyry type and Mesozoic ages. This district is divided by the Xilamulun fault into the southern and the northern parts. In this paper, we present new zircon U-Pb dating, trace elements and Hf isotope, and/or whole rock Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic results for the host granitoids from three Mo deposits (Yangchang, Haisugou and Shabutai) in northern Xilamulun. Our aim is to constrain the age and petrogenesis of these intrusions and their implications for Mo mineralization. Zircon U-Pb LA-ICP-MS dating shows that the monzogranites from the Shabutai and Yangchang deposits formed at 138.4 Â± 1.5 and 137.4 Â± 2.1 Ma, respectively, which is identical to the molybdenite Re-Os ages and coeval well with the other Mo deposits in this region, thereby indicating an Early Cretaceous magmatism and Mo mineralization event. Zircon Ce/Nd ratios from the mineralized intrusions are significantly higher than the barren granites, implying that the mineralization-related magmas are characterized by higher oxygen fugacity. These mineralized intrusions share similar zircon in-situ Hf and whole rock Sr-Nd isotopic compositions, with slightly negative to positive ÎµHf(t) ranging from - 0.8 to + 10.0, restricted ÎµNd(t) values from - 3.7 to + 1.6 but a little variable (87Sr/86Sr)i ratios between 0.7021 and 0.7074, indicative of formation from primary magmas generated from a dominantly juvenile lower crust source derived from depleted mantle, despite diverse consequent processes (e.g., magma mixing, fractional crystallization and crustal contamination) during their evolution. The Pb isotopes (whole rock) also show a narrow range of initial compositions, with (206Pb/204Pb)i = 18.03-18.88, (207Pb/204Pb)i = 15.48-15.58 and (208Pb/204Pb)i = 37.72-38.28, in agreement with Sr-Nd-Hf isotopes reflecting the dominance of a mantle component\n\nHigh Precision Isotope Analyses Using Multi-Collector SIMS: Applications to Earth and Planetary Science.\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKita, N.

A number of isotopically homogeneous mineral standards have been prepared and calibrated in order to certify the accuracy of analyses in the same level. When spatial resolution is critical, spot size is reduced down to sub- Î¼m for Î´ 18O to obtain better than 0.5â° (1SD) precision by using electron multiplier (EM) on multi-collection system. Multi-collection EM analysis is also applied at 10 ppm level to Li isotope ratios in zircon with precision better than 2â° (1SD). A few applications will be presented. (1) Oxygen three isotope analyses of chondrules in ordinary chondrites revealed both mass dependent and mass independent oxygen isotope fractionations among chondrules as well as within individual chondrules. The results give constraints on the process of chondrule formation and origin of isotope reservoirs in the early solar system. (2) High precision 26Al-26Mg (half life of 0.73 Ma) chronology is applied to zoned melilite and anorthite from Ca, Al-rich inclusions (CAI) in Leoville meteorite, and a well-defined internal isochron is obtained. The results indicate the Al- Mg system was remained closed within 40ky of the crystallization of melilite and anorthite in this CAI. (3) Sub- Î¼m spot analyses of Î´18O in isotopically zoned zircon from high-grade metamorphism reveals a diffusion profile of ~6â° over 2Î¼m, indicating slow diffusion of oxygen in zircon. This result also implies that old Archean detrital zircons (> 4\n\nSmall Volume Isotopic Analysis of Zircon Using LA-MC-ICP-MS U-Pb and Lu-Hf and Sub-ng Amounts of Hf in Solution\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBauer, A.; Horstwood, M. S.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nCrust-mantle evolution studies are greatly informed by zircon U-Pb and Lu-Hf isotopic datasets and the ease with which these data can now be acquired has seen their application become commonplace. In order to deconvolute geochemical change and interpret geologic variation in complexly zoned zircons, this information is most ideally obtained on the smallest volume of zircon by successive SIMS U-Pb and LA-MC-ICP-MS Lu-Hf isotopic analyses. However, due to variations in zircon growth zone geometry at depth, the Lu-Hf analysis may not relate to the lower volume U-Pb analysis, potentially causing inaccuracy of the resultant age-corrected Hf isotope signature. Laser ablation split-stream methods are applied to be certain that U-Pb and Lu-Hf data represent the same volume of zircon, however, the sampling volume remains relatively large at 40x30Âµm1. Coupled ID-TIMS U-Pb and solution MC-ICP-MS Lu-Hf work traditionally utilize whole-zircon dissolution ( 10-50ng Hf), which has the potential to homogenize different zones of geologic significance within an analysis. Conversely, modern ID-TIMS U-Pb methods utilize microsampling of zircon grains, often providing < 5ng Hf, thereby challenging conventional Lu-Hf acquisition protocols to achieve the required precision. In order to obtain usable precision on minimal zircon volumes, we developed laser ablation methods using successive 25um spot U-Pb and Lu-Hf ablation pits with a combined depth of 18um, and low-volume solution introduction methods without Hf-REE separation utilizing Hf amounts as low as 0.4ng, while retaining an uncertainty level of ca. 1 ÉHf for both methods. We investigated methods of Yb interference correction and the potential for matrix effects, with a particular focus on the accurate quantification of 176Lu/177Hf. These improvements reduce the minimum amount of material required for U-Pb and Hf isotopic analysis of zircon by about an order of magnitude. 1Ibanez-Mejia et al (2015).

Marginal zone (mesocratic metanorite) lies at the base of the massif. Main zone is composed of leucocratic metagabbro. The upper zone is alteration of mataanorthosite and leucocratic metagabbro. All rocks were subjected to granulate and anorthositic metamorphism. Age of magmatic crystallization of the massif was determined for the first time, using the U-Pb isotope method for single zircon grains. Three fractions of single zircons from anorthosite of the Kandalaksha massif gave precise U-Pb age of 2435.5 Â± 4.8 Ma. For the first time REE concentration (WR) was determined using a quadrupole mass spectrometer (Agilent 7500 ce ICP-MS) in the main varieties of rocks of the Kandalaksha-Kolvitsa paleoproterozoic complex. Anorthosite and leucocratic metagabbros (main zone) are characterized by a flat spectrum distribution of HREE, which were normalized by [1]. The REE pattern is characterized by significant positive anomalies of Eu ((Eu / Eu *)n = 3.72-3.91) in anorthosite and leucogabbros and 7.26 - in ortoamfibolitah. General content of individual elements that are common for this type of rocks: Cen = 5.82-8.54, Ybn = 1.54-1.58, which indicates that the process of crystallization of the rock occurred with predominant accumulation of plagioclase. According to geochemical and Nd-Sr isotopic data (ISr=0.702 - 0.706, ÉNd(T) = +1 - (-3)) Kandalaksha Kolvitsa complex, appear to have a general plume source with Paleoproterozoic layered intrusions of the Baltic Shield [2] Distribution of REE (ELAN-9000 ICP-MS) in zircon have a typical magmatic species: a positive Ce, negative Eu anomaly and HREE flat spectrum. Titanium content in zircons were measured for the calculation of their crystallization temperature with 8350C. These data are evidence of magmatic origin of zircon [3].

The output of the ArF laser is filtered in natural air and applied to an irradiation cell where it preferentially photodissociates molecules of oxygen gas containing .sup.17 O or .sup.18 O oxygen nuclides. A scavenger such as O.sub.2, CO or ethylene is used to collect the preferentially dissociated oxygen atoms and recycled to produce isotopically enriched molecular oxygen gas. Other embodiments utilize an ArF laser which is narrowly tuned with a prism or diffraction grating to preferentially photodissociate desired isotopes. Similarly, desired mixtures of isotopic gas can be used as a filter to photodissociate enriched preselected isotopes of oxygen.\n\nRecovering the primary geochemistry of Jack Hills zircons through quantitative estimates of chemical alteration\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBell, Elizabeth A.; Boehnke, Patrick; Harrison, T. Mark\n\n2016-10-01\n\nDespite the robust nature of zircon in most crustal and surface environments, chemical alteration, especially associated with radiation damaged regions, can affect its geochemistry. This consideration is especially important when drawing inferences from the detrital record where the original rock context is missing. Typically, alteration is qualitatively diagnosed through inspection of zircon REE patterns and the style of zoning shown by cathodoluminescence imaging, since fluid-mediated alteration often causes a flat, high LREE pattern. Due to the much lower abundance of LREE in zircon relative both to other crustal materials and to the other REE, disturbance to the LREE pattern is the most likely first sign of disruption to zircon trace element contents. Using a database of 378 (148 new) trace element and 801 (201 new) oxygen isotope measurements on zircons from Jack Hills, Western Australia, we propose a quantitative framework for assessing chemical contamination and exchange with fluids in this population. The Light Rare Earth Element Index is scaled on the relative abundance of light to middle REE, or LREE-I = (Dy/Nd) + (Dy/Sm). LREE-I values vary systematically with other known contaminants (e.g., Fe, P) more faithfully than other suggested proxies for zircon alteration (Sm/La, various absolute concentrations of LREEs) and can be used to distinguish primary compositions when textural evidence for alteration is ambiguous. We find that zircon oxygen isotopes do not vary systematically with placement on or off cracks or with degree of LREE-related chemical alteration, suggesting an essentially primary signature.
