This thesis investigates the stability of the Eti Copper Mine tailings dam using finite element analysis. Laboratory experiments were conducted to determine material properties of the tailings and embankment, including natural moisture content, grain size distribution, specific gravity, Atterberg limits, maximum dry density, and shear strength parameters. These properties were used as inputs for the finite element model. The stability of the existing dam and alternative dam geometries for future raises were analyzed under static loading conditions to evaluate stability problems and improve reliability.",
