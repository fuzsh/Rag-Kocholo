        "text": "Is Myanmar jadeitite of Jurassic age? A result from incompletely recrystallized inherited zircon\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nYui, Tzen-Fu; Fukoyama, Mayuko; Iizuka, Yoshiyuki; Wu, Chao-Ming; Wu, Tsai-Way; Liou, J. G.; Grove, Marty\n\n2013-02-01\n\nZircons from two Myanmar jadeitite samples were separated for texture, mineral inclusion, U-Pb dating and trace element composition analyses. Three types of zircons, with respect to U-Pb isotope system, were recognized. Type I zircons are inherited ones, yielding an igneous protolith age of 160 Â± 1 Ma; Type II zircons are metasomatic/hydrothermal ones, giving a (minimum) jadeitite formation age of 77 Â± 3 Ma; and Type III zircons are incompletely recrystallized ones, with non-coherent and geologically meaningless ages from 153 to 105 Ma. These Myanmar jadeitites would therefore have formed through whole-sale metasomatic replacement processes. Compared with Type I zircons, Type II zircons show typical metasomatic/hydrothermal geochemical signatures, with low Th/U ratio (< 0.1), small Ce anomaly (Ce/Ce* = < 5) and low Î£REE content (40-115 ppm). Type III zircons, however, commonly have the above geochemical signatures straddle in between Type I and Type II zircons. It is shown that the resetting rates of various trace element compositions and U-Pb isotope system of inherited zircons are not coupled \"in phase\" in response to zircon recrystallization during jadeitite formation. The observed abnormally low Th/U ratio and small Ce anomaly of some Type I zircons, as well as the lack of negative Eu anomaly of all Type I zircons, should be suspected to be of secondary origin. In extreme cases, incompletely recrystallized zircons may show typical metasomatic/hydrothermal geochemical signatures, but leave U-Pb isotope system partially reset or even largely unchanged. Such zircons easily lead to incorrect age interpretation, and hence erroneous geological implication. The Myanmar jadeitites, based on the present study, might have formed during the Late Cretaceous subduction before the beginning of India-Asia continental collision at Paleocene. Previously proposed Late Jurassic ages for Myanmar jadeitites are suggested as results rooted on data retrieved from incompletely\n\nImplications of Bishop Tuff zircon U-Pb ages for rates of zircon growth and magma accumulation\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nReid, M. R.; Schmitt, A. K.\n\n2012-12-01\n\nRates of geologic processes obtained from natural studies rely on accurate geochronologic information. An important benchmark in geochronology as well as a valuable source of insights into the evolution of voluminous explosive eruptions is the >600 km3 Bishop Tuff (BT). A recently determined weighted mean 206Pb/238U date of 767.1Â±0.9 ka for a BT zircon population [1] is indistinguishable from the recalibrated 40Ar/39Ar sanidine date of 767.4Â±2.2 ka [2], potentially providing a key intercalibration point between astronomical and radio-isotopic dating approaches. Consequences of these results are linear zircon growth rates of >1Ã10-14 cm/sec and magma accumulation rates of >200 km3/ka. In contrast, spatially selective SIMS U-Pb dating of BT zircons yielded mean pre-eruption ages of 850 ka [3], a difference that raises questions about the validity of intercalibration between U-Pb and K-Ar dating methods and the history of magma accumulation. We obtained new SIMS analyses of the BT zircons using more spatially and analytically sensitive methods and verifying our accuracy against the TIMS dated Quaternary zircon 61.308A (2.488Â±0.002 Ma). Analyses were performed on zircon rims and on oriented cross-sections exposed during optical interferometry-calibrated serial sectioning removing the outermost ~31 Î¼m. Sputtering by a 100 nA ion beam versus the normally employed 10-12 nA beam resulted in enhanced radiogenic Pb yields and analytical uncertainties for Quaternary zircon approaching the U-Pb age reproducibility of the primary zircon standard (~1-2 % for AS3). Ages obtained at ~31 Î¼m depth (representing <5% of crystal growth in most cases) average 892Â±26ka (MSWD=0.29), corroborating previous evidence for residence times of several tens of ka. Rim ages average 781Â±22 ka (MSWD=0.61), overlapping Ar/Ar determinations of eruption age and corroborating the importance of near-eruption aged zircon growth. Our results confirm the presence of BT zircon domains that predate\n\nU-Xe Degassing Ages of Terrestrial and Lunar Impact Zircons\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCrow, C. A.; Crowther, S.

Here we investigate detrital zircon from the latest Triassic (ca. 202 Ma) sedimentary strata directly underlying lava flows of the Central Atlantic magmatic province or interlayered within them. SHRIMP (Sensitive High-Resolution Ion MicroProbe) and LA-ICP-MS (Laser Ablation-Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry) U-Pb ages for zircon range from Paleozoic to Archean with a dominant Neoproterozoic peak, and significant amounts of ca. 2 Ga zircon. These ages suggest a prevailing West African (Gondwanan) provenance at all sampling sites. Notably, the Paleoproterozoic zircon population is particularly abundant in central Morocco, north of the High Atlas chain, suggesting the presence of Eburnean-aged rocks in this part of the country, which is consistent with recent geochronologic data from outcropping rocks. Minor amounts of late Mesoproterozoic and early Neoproterozoic zircon ages (ca. 1.1-0.9 Ga) in Moroccan samples are more difficult to interpret. A provenance from Avalonia or Amazonia, as proposed by previous studies is not supported by the age distributions observed here. An involvement of more distal source regions, possibly located in north-eastern Africa (Arabian Nubian Shield) would instead be possible. Paleozoic zircon ages are abundant in the Canadian sample, pointing to a significant contribution from Hercynian aged source rocks. Such a signal is nearly absent in the Moroccan samples, suggesting that zircon-bearing Hercynian granitic rocks of the Moroccan Meseta block were not yet outcropping at ca. 200 Ma. The only Moroccan samples that yield Paleozoic zircon ages are those interlayered within the CAMP lavas, suggesting an increased dismantling\n\nCoordinated UâPb geochronology, trace element, Ti-in-zircon thermometry and microstructural analysis of Apollo zircons\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nCrow, Carolyn A.; McKeegan, Kevin D.; Moser, Desmond E.\n\nHere, we present the results of a coordinated SIMS UâPb, trace element, Ti-in-zircon thermometry, and microstructural study of 155 lunar zircons separated from Apollo 14, 15, and 17 breccia and soil samples that help resolve discrepancies between the zircon data, the lunar whole rock history and lunar magma ocean crystallization models. The majority of lunar grains are detrital fragments, some nearly 1 mm in length, of large parent crystals suggesting that they crystallized in highly enriched KREEP magmas. The zircon age distributions for all three landing sites exhibit an abundance of ages at ~4.33 Ga, however they differ in thatmoreÂ Â» only Apollo 14 samples have a population of zircons with ages between 4.1 and 3.9 Ga. These younger grains comprise only 10% of all dated lunar zircons and are usually small and highly shocked making them more susceptible to Pb-loss. These observations suggest that the majority of zircons crystallized before 4.1 Ga and that KREEP magmatism had predominantly ceased by this time. We also observed that trace element analyses are easily affected by contributions from inclusions (typically injected impact melt) within SIMS analyses spots. After filtering for these effects, rare-earth element (REE) abundances of pristine zircon are consistent with one pattern characterized by a negative Eu anomaly and no positive Ce anomaly, implying that the zircons formed in a reducing environment. This inference is consistent with crystallization temperatures based on measured Ti concentrations and new estimates of oxide activities which imply temperatures ranging between 958 Â± 57 and 1321 Â± 100 Â°C, suggesting that zircon parent magmas were anhydrous. Together, the lunar zircon ages and trace elements are consistent with a â¤300 My duration of KREEP magmatism under anhydrous, reducing conditions.

Diffusive growth models predict asymmetric distributions of zircon dates and crystallization temperatures in a cooling magma, with volumetrically abundant old, hot crystallization at T sat decreasing continuously to volumetrically minor young, cold crystallization at T solid. We present integrated geochronological and geochemical data from Bergell Intrusion tonalites (Central Alps, Europe) that document zircon compositional changemoreÂ Â» over hundreds of thousands of years at the hand-sample scale, indicating melt compositional evolution during solidification. Ti-in-zircon thermometry, crystallization simulation using MELTS software, and U-Pb dates produce zircon mass-temperature-time distributions that are in excellent agreement with zircon growth models.

S.; Compston, W.\n\n1994-12-01\n\nA method is presented for detecting multiple components in a population of analytical observations for zircon and other ages. The procedure uses an approach known as mixture modeling, in order to estimate the most likely ages, proportions and number of distinct components in a given data set. Particular attention is paid to estimating errors in the estimated ages and proportions. At each stage of the procedure several alternative numerical approaches are suggested, each having their own advantages in terms of efficency and accuracy. The methodology is tested on synthetic data sets simulating two or more mixed populations of zircon ages. In this case true ages and proportions of each population are known and compare well with the results of the new procedure. Two examples are presented of its use with sets of SHRIMP U-238 - Pb-206 zircon ages from Palaeozoic rocks. A published data set for altered zircons from bentonite at Meishucun, South China, previously treated as a single-component population after screening for gross alteration effects, can be resolved into two components by the new procedure and their ages, proportions and standard errors estimated. The older component, at 530 +/- 5 Ma (2 sigma), is our best current estimate for the age of the bentonite. Mixture modeling of a data set for unaltered zircons from a tonalite elsewhere defines the magmatic U-238 - Pb-206 age at high precision (2 sigma +/- 1.5 Ma), but one-quarter of the 41 analyses detect hidden and significantly older cores.\n\nDepositional ages of clastic metasediments from Samos and Syros, Greece: results of a detrital zircon study\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLÃ¶wen, Kersten; BrÃ¶cker, Michael; Berndt, Jasper\n\n2015-01-01\n\nSiliciclastic metasediments from the islands of Samos and Syros, Cycladic blueschist unit, Greece, were studied to determine maximum sedimentation ages. Four samples from the Ampelos unit on Samos yielded age distribution spectra that range from ~320 Ma to ~3.2 Ga with a dominance of Cambrian-Neoproterozoic zircons (500-1,100 Ma). The youngest well-constrained age groups cluster at 500-550 Ma. Our results allow to link the Samos metasediments with occurrences showing similar age distribution patterns elsewhere in the eastern Mediterranean region (Greece, Turkey, Libya, Israel and Jordan) that record the influx of `Pan-African' detritus. The lack of post-500-Ma zircons in the Samos samples is in marked contrast to the data from Syros that indicates Triassic to Cretaceous depositional ages. The samples from Syros were collected from the matrix of a meta-ophiolitic mÃ©lange that is exposed near the top of the metamorphic succession as well as from outcrops representing the basal part of the underlying marble-schist sequence. The zircon populations from Syros were mainly supplied by Mesozoic sources dominated by Triassic protolith ages. Subordinate is the importance of pre-Triassic zircons, but this may reflect bias induced by the research strategy. Sediment accumulation continued until Late Cretaceous time, but the overall contribution of Jurassic to Cretaceous detritus is more limited. Zircon populations are dominated by grains with small degree of rounding suggesting relatively short sediment transportation. Available observations are in accordance with a model suggesting deposition close to the magmatic source rocks.\n\nAge and origin of the Merrimack terrane, southeastern New England: A detrital zircon U-Pb geochronology study\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSorota, Kristin\n\nMetasedimentary rocks of the Merrimack terrane (MT) originated as a thick cover sequence on Ganderia consisting of sandstones, calcareous sandstones, pelitic rocks and turbidites. In order to investigate the age, provenance and stratigraphic order of these rocks and correlations with adjoining terranes, detrital zircon suites from 7 formations across the MT along a NNE-trending transect from east-central Massachusetts to SE New Hampshire were analyzed by U-Pb LA-ICP-MS methods on 90-140 grains per sample. The youngest detrital zircons in the western units, the Worcester, Oakdale and Paxton Formations, are ca. 438 Ma while those in the Kittery, Eliot and Berwick Formations in the northeast are ca. 426 Ma. The Tower Hill Formation previously interpreted to form the easternmost unit of the MT in MA, has a distinctly different zircon distribution with its youngest zircon population in the Cambrian. All samples except for the Tower Hill Formation have detrital zircon age distributions with significant peaks in the mid-to late Ordovician, similar abundances of early Paleozoic and late Neoproterozoic zircons, significant input from Ë1.0 to Ë1.8 Ga sources and limited Archean grains. The similarities in zircon provenance suggest that all units across the terrane, except for the Tower Hill Formation, belong to a single sequence of rocks, with similar sources and with the units in the NE possibly being somewhat younger than those in east-central Massachusetts. The continuous zircon age distributions observed throughout the Mesoproterozoic and late Paleoproterozoic are consistent with an Amazonian source. All samples, except the Tower Hill Formation, show sedimentary input from both Ganderian and Laurentian sources and suggest that Laurentian input increases as the maximum depositional age decreases.\n\nEstimating the formation age distribution of continental crust by unmixing zircon ages\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKorenaga, Jun\n\n2018-01-01\n\nContinental crust provides first-order control on Earth's surface environment, enabling the presence of stable dry landmasses surrounded by deep oceans. The evolution of continental crust is important for atmospheric evolution, because continental crust is an essential component of deep carbon cycle and is likely to have played a critical role in the oxygenation of the atmosphere. Geochemical information stored in the mineral zircon, known for its resilience to diagenesis and metamorphism, has been central to ongoing debates on the genesis and evolution of continental crust. However, correction for crustal reworking, which is the most critical step when estimating original formation ages, has been incorrectly formulated, undermining the significance of previous estimates. Here I suggest a simple yet promising approach for reworking correction using the global compilation of zircon data. The present-day distribution of crustal formation age estimated by the new \"unmixing\" method serves as the lower bound to the true crustal growth, and large deviations from growth models based on mantle depletion imply the important role of crustal recycling through the Earth history.\n\nProterozoic tectonostratigraphy and paleogeography of central Madagascar derived from detrital zircon U-Pb age populations\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nCox, R.; Coleman, D.S.; Chokel, C.B.; DeOreo, S.B.; Wooden, Joseph L.; Collins, A.S.; De Waele, B.; Kroner, A.\n\n2004-01-01\n\nDetrital zircon UâPb ages determined by SHRIMP distinguish two clastic sequences among Proterozoic metasedimentary rocks from central Madagascar. The Itremo Group is older: zircon data, stromatolite characteristics, and carbon isotope data all point to a depositional age around 1500â1700 Ma. The Molo Group is younger, deposited between â¼620 Ma (the age of the youngest zircon) and â¼560 Ma (the age of metamorphic overgrowths on detrital cores). Geochronologic provenance analysis of the Itremo Group points to sources in East Africa as well as local sources in central and southern Madagascar but provides no evidence for a detrital contribution from northern and eastern Madagascar nor from southern India. Detrital zircon and sedimentologic similarities between rocks of the Itremo Group and the Zambian Muva Supergroup suggest a lithostratigraphic correlation between the two. The Molo Group has a strong 1000â1100 Ma detrital signature that also indicates an east African provenance and suggests a Neoproterozoic geographic connection with Sri Lanka but shows no indication of input from the Dharwar craton and eastern Madagascar. Central Madagascar was probably juxtaposed with the Tanzanian craton in the Paleoâ and Mesoproterozoic, whereas northern and eastern Madagascar were connected to India. Internal assembly of Madagascar postdates Neoproterozoic Molo Group sedimentation and is likely to have occurred at about 560 Ma.\n\nNew U-Pb zircon ages and the duration and division of Devonian time\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nTucker, R.D.; Bradley, D.C.; Ver Straeten, C.A.; Harris, A.G.; Ebert, J.R.; McCutcheon, S.R.\n\n1998-01-01\n\nNewly determined U-Pb zircon ages of volcanic ashes closely tied to biostratigraphic zones are used to revise the Devonian time-scale. They are: 1) 417.6 ?? 1.0 Ma for an ash within the conodont zone of Icriodus woschmidti/I. w. hesperius Lochkovian); 2) 408.3 ?? 1.9 Ma for an ash of early Emsian age correlated with the conodont zones of Po. dehiscens--Lower Po. inversus; 3) 391.4 ?? 1.8 Ma for an ash within the Po. c. costatus Zone and probably within the upper half of the zone (Eifelian); and 4) 381.1 ?? 1.3 Ma for an ash within the range of the Frasnian conodont Palmatolepis punctata (Pa. punctata Zone to Upper Pa. hassi Zone). U-Pb zircon ages for two rhyolites bracketing a palyniferous bed of the pusillites-lepidophyta spore zone, are dated at 363.8 ?? 2.2 Ma and 363 ?? 2.2 Ma and 363.4 ?? 1.8 Ma, respectively, suggesting an age of ~363 Ma for a level within the late Famennian Pa. g. expansa Zone. These data, together with other published zircon ages, suggest that the base and top of the Devonian lie close to 418 Ma and 362 Ma, respectively, thus lengthening the period of ~20% over current estimates. We suggest that the duration of the Middle Devonian (Eifelian and Givitian) is rather brief, perhaps no longer than 11.5 Myr (394 Ma-382.5 Ma), and that the Emsian and Famennian are the longest stages in the period with estimated durations of ~15.5 Myr and 14.5 Myr, respectively.\n\nPeninsular terrane basement ages recorded by Paleozoic and Paleoproterozoic zircon in gabbro xenoliths and andesite from Redoubt volcano, Alaska\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nBacon, Charles R.; Vazquez, Jorge A.; Wooden, Joseph L.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nHistorically Sactive Redoubt volcano is an Aleutian arc basalt-to-dacite cone constructed upon the JurassicâEarly Tertiary AlaskaâAleutian Range batholith. The batholith intrudes the Peninsular tectonostratigraphic terrane, which is considered to have developed on oceanic basement and to have accreted to North America, possibly in Late Jurassic time. Xenoliths in Redoubt magmas have been thought to be modern cumulate gabbros and fragments of the batholith. However, new sensitive high-resolution ion microprobe (SHRIMP) U-Pb ages for zircon from gabbro xenoliths from a late Pleistocene pyroclastic deposit are dominated by much older, ca. 310 Ma Pennsylvanian and ca. 1865 Ma Paleoproterozoic grains. Zircon age distributions and trace-element concentrations indicate that the ca. 310 Ma zircons date gabbroic intrusive rocks, and the ca. 1865 Ma zircons also are likely from igneous rocks in or beneath Peninsular terrane basement. The trace-element data imply that four of five CretaceousâPaleocene zircons, and Pennsylvanian low-U, low-Th zircons in one sample, grew from metamorphic or hydrothermal fluids. Textural evidence of xenocrysts and a dominant population of ca. 1865 Ma zircon in juvenile crystal-rich andesite from the same pyroclastic deposit show that this basement has been assimilated by Redoubt magma. Equilibration temperatures and oxygen fugacities indicated by Fe-Tiâoxide minerals in the gabbros and crystal-rich andesite suggest sources near the margins of the Redoubt magmatic system, most likely in the magma accumulation and storage region currently outlined by seismicity and magma petrology at â¼4â10 km below sea level. Additionally, a partially melted gabbro from the 1990 eruption contains zircon with U-Pb ages between ca. 620 Ma and ca. 1705 Ma, as well as one zircon with a U-Th disequilibrium model age of 0 ka. The zircon ages demonstrate that Pennsylvanian, and probably Paleoproterozoic, igneous rocks exist in, or possibly beneath, Peninsular\n\nPan-Africa/Pan-Brazilian detrital zircons in Lower Palaeozoic schists of SW Norway - enigmatic detrital zircon U-Pb ages\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZimmermann, Udo; BjÃ¸rheim, Maren; Clark, Chris\n\n2013-04-01\n\nWe present Sensitive High Resolution Ion Microprobe (SHRIMP) U-Pb zircon age data from metasedimentary rocks (schists and quartzites) located in the town of Stavanger (SW Norway). The metasedimentary sequence is composed of schists, medium grained quartz-rich metawackes and quartzites. Quartzites and meta-quartz-wackes exhibit a mylonitic fabric with newly grown fine-grained muscovite defining the fabric. Accessory minerals are zircon, allanite, detrital apatite, monazite, ilmenite, rutile and zircon. The schists are dark and dominated by quartz and feldspar in a fine chloritic and silica-rich matrix and represent the dominant lithology of the region. While quartzites and metawackes show typical geochemical characteristics for strongly reworked rocks, the schists have very low Zr/Sc and Th/Sc ratios below 0.9 and point together with other trace element ratios (La/Sc, Ti/Zr) to the strong influence of less fractionated, mafic, sources in the detritus, possibly arc derived. U-Pb ages of detrital zircon from quartzites range between 740 to 1800 Ma. There is a defined population at 1135 and 1010 Ma tentatively correlated with the Sveconorwegian orogeny. A second population at ~1450 Ma that can be related to a tectono-magmatic event during the Earliest Mesoproterozoic, also recorded in Oslo, southern Sweden and Bornholm, mapped along the proposed southern margin of Baltica. Other detrital zircons record ages between 1586 - 1664 Ma that are not related to the latter event. The oldest U-Pb detrital zircon grain age was 1796 Ma and is potentially associated with the terminal phase of the Svecofennian orogeny. Detrital zircons from the associated schists do show a similar abundance of main age clusters but the oldest found zircons dates to 2013 Ma while the maximum depositional age could be determined by grains of Cambrian to even Ordovician ages with a large 1 sigma error, as such that we rather propose a Cambrian maximum depositional age. It is possible to speculate that\n\nLow heat flow inferred from >4 Gyr zircons suggests Hadean plate boundary interactions.\n\nPubMed\n\nHopkins, Michelle; Harrison, T Mark; Manning, Craig E\n\n2008-11-27\n\nThe first approximately 600 million years of Earth history (the 'Hadean' eon) remain poorly understood, largely because there is no rock record dating from that era. Detrital Hadean igneous zircons from the Jack Hills, Western Australia, however, can potentially provide insights into the conditions extant on our planet at that time. Results of geochemical investigations using these ancient grains have been interpreted to suggest the presence of a hydrosphere and continental crust before 4 Gyr. An underexploited characteristic of the >4 Gyr zircons is their diverse assemblage of mineral inclusions. Here we present an examination of over 400 Hadean zircons from Jack Hills, which shows that some inclusion assemblages are conducive to thermobarometry. Our thermobarometric analyses of 4.02-4.19-Gyr-old inclusion-bearing zircons constrain their magmatic formation conditions to about 700 degrees C and 7 kbar. This result implies a near-surface heat flow of approximately 75 mW m(-2), about three to five times lower than estimates of Hadean global heat flow. As the only site of magmatism on modern Earth that is characterized by heat flow of about one-quarter of the global average is above subduction zones, we suggest that the magmas from which the Jack Hills Hadean zircons crystallized were formed largely in an underthrust environment, perhaps similar to modern convergent margins.\n\nU-Pb Detrital Zircon Ages from Sarawak: Changes in Provenance Reflecting the Tectonic Evolution of Southeast Asia\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBreitfeld, H. T.; Galin, T.; Hall, R.\n\n2014-12-01\n\nSarawak is located on the northern edge of Sundaland in NW Borneo. Five sedimentary basins are distinguished with ages from Triassic to Cenozoic. New light mineral, heavy mineral and U-Pb detrital zircon ages show differences in provenance reflecting the tectonic evolution of the region. The oldest clastic sediments are Triassic of the Sadong-Kuching Basin and were sourced by a Carnian to Norian volcanic arc and erosion of Cathaysian rocks containing zircons of Paleoproterozoic age. Sandstones of the Upper Jurassic to Cretaceous Bau-Pedawan Basin have distinctive zircon populations indicating a major change of tectonic setting, including initiation of subduction below present-day West Sarawak in the Late Jurassic. A wide range of inherited zircon ages indicates various Cathaysian fragments as major source areas and the arrival of the SW Borneo Block following subduction beneath the Schwaner Mountains in the early Late Cretaceous. After collision of the SW Borneo Block and the microcontinental fragments with Sundaland in the early Late Cretaceous, deep marine sedimentation (Pedawan Formation) ceased, and there was uplift forming the regional Pedawan-Kayan unconformity. Two episodes of extension were responsible for basin development on land from the latest Cretaceous onwards, probably in a strike-slip setting. The first episode formed the Kayan Basin in the Latest Cretaceous (Maastrichtian) to Early Paleocene, and the second formed the Ketungau Basin and the Penrissen Sandstone in the Middle to Late Eocene. Zircons indicate nearby volcanic activity throughout the Early Cenozoic in NW Borneo. Inherited zircon ages indicate an alternation between Borneo and Tin Belt source rocks. A large deep marine basin, the Rajang Basin, formed north of the Lupar Line fault. Zircons from sediments of the Rajang Basin indicate they are of similar age and provenance as the contemporaneous terrestrial sediments to the south suggesting a narrow steep continental Sundaland margin at the\n\nWhat can zircon ages from the Jack Hills detrital zircon suite really tell us about Hadean geodynamics?\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWhitehouse, Martin; Nemchin, Alexander\n\n2015-04-01\n\nAs the only direct sample of the Hadean Earth, detrital zircon grains from the Jack Hills, Western Australia, have been the subject of intense investigation over the almost three decades since their discovery. A wide variety of geochemical and isotopic analyses of these grains, as well as their mineral inclusions, have been used variously to support two fundamentally different models for Hadean geodynamics: (i) Some form of (not necessarily modern-style) plate recycling generating felsic (continental-type?) crust at the boundaries [1, 2], or conversely (ii) the persistence of a long-lived, stagnant basaltic lid within which magmatism occurred as a result of internal temperature perturbations and/or impacts [3, 4], a model also generally consistent with a wide range of observations from post-Hadean geochemical reservoirs. Despite the considerable time and resources expended, the majority of these studies uncritically accept the individual U-Pb zircon ages, even though their veracity is key to many of the interpretations [5, 6]. We report here the results of an in-depth evaluation of all published (and new) U-Pb ages from the Jack Hills zircon suite in order to define age populations that can be used with a high degree of confidence in geodynamic interpretations. A notable problem in the interpretation of U-Pb data from ancient zircon grains (including those as young as the Neoarchean) is that disturbance of the systematics even several 100 Ma after crystallization causes data to spread along the concordia curve without becoming discernably discordant within the relatively large error bounds associated with U/Pb ages from in situ dating methods (e.g. SIMS). While 207Pb/206Pb ages are typically more precise, individually they provide no means to detect Pb-loss-induced younging. However, if two or preferably more analyses have been made in the same zircon growth zone, a reasonable evaluation of the possibility of Pb-loss can be made. In the available Jack Hills zircon\n\nThe age of unusual xenogenic zircons from Yakutian kimberlites\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nVladykin, N. V.; Lepekhina, E. A.\n\n2009-12-01\n\nSeveral spindle-shaped grains of zircon, which have a small size (<0.25 mm) and a distinct purplish pink coloration were found in the crushed samples of kimberlites from the Aykhal, Komsomolskaya-Magnitnaya, Botuobinskaya (Siberian platform), and Nyurbinskaya (Yakutia) pipes and olivine lamproites of the Khani massif (West Aldan). U-Pb SHRIMP II zircon dating performed at the VSEGEI Center for Isotopic Research yielded the ages of 1870-1890 Ma for the pipes of the Western province (Aykhal and Komsomolskaya) and 2200-2750 Ma for the pipes of the eastern province (Nyurbinskaya and Botuobinskaya), which allowed us to consider these zircons to be xenogenic to kimberlites. Although these zircons resemble in their age and color those from the granulite xenoliths in the Udachnaya pipe [2], no other granulite minerals are found there. Thus, major geological events in the mantle and lower crust, which led to the formation of zircon-bearing rocks, happened at 1800-1900 Ma in the northern part of the kimberlite province, whereas in the Eastern part of the province (Nakyn field) these events were much older (2220-2700 Ma). It is known that the period of 1800-1900 Ma in the Earthâs history was accompanied by intense tectonic movements and widespread alkaline-carbonatite magmatism. This magmatism was related to plume activity responsible for overheating the large portions of the mantle to the temperatures at which some diamonds in mantle rocks would burn (northern part of the kimberlite province). In the Nakyn area, the mantle underwent few or no geological processes at that time, and perhaps for this reason this area hosts more diamondiferous kimberlites. The age of olivine lamproites from the Khani massif is 2672-2732 Ma. Thus, these are some of the worldâs oldest known K-alkaline rocks.\n\nThe role of trace element partitioning between garnet, zircon and orthopyroxene on the interpretation of zircon U-Pb ages: an example from high-grade basement in Calabria (Southern Italy)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFornelli, A.; Langone, A.; Micheletti, F.; Pascazio, A.; Piccarreta, G.\n\n2014-03-01\n\n, and (2) D opx/grt values define positive trends reaching values considered as suggestive of equilibrium from Er to Lu only with respect to the outer core of garnet. The presence of a zircon core dated 320 Ma in the inner rim of garnet suggests that it, as well as those dated at 325-320 Ma in the other textural sites and, probably, those dated at 339-336 Ma showing depletion of HREE, grew after the garnet core, which sequestered a lot of HREE and earlier than the HREE rich margin of garnet. The quite uniform REE contents in orthopyroxene from matrix and corona and the low and uniform contents of HREE in the zircon overgrowths dated at about 300 Ma allow to think that homogenisation occurred during or after the corona formation around this age. The domains dated around 325-320 Ma would approximate the stages of decompression, whereas the metamorphic peak probably occurred earlier than 339 Ma.\n\nZircon Age Distributions Provide Magma Fluxes in the Earth's Crust\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCaricchi, L.; Simpson, G.; Schaltegger, U.\n\n2014-12-01\n\nMagma fluxes control the growth of continents, the frequency and magnitude of volcanic eruptions and are important for the genesis of magmatic ore deposits. A significant part of the magma produced in the Earth's mantle solidifies at depth and this limits our capability of determining magma fluxes, which, in turn, compromises our ability to establish a link between global heat transfer and large-scale geological processes. Using thermal modelling in combination with high precision zircon dating we show that populations of zircon ages provide an accurate mean to retrieve magma fluxes. The characteristics of zircon age populations vary significantly and systematically as function of the flux and total volume of magma accumulated at depth. This new approach provides results that are identical to independent determinations of magma fluxes and volumes of magmatic systems. The analysis of existing age population datasets by our method highlights that porphyry-type deposits, plutons and large eruptions each require magma input over different timescales at characteristic average fluxes.\n\nFinding the \"true\" age: ways to read high-precision U-Pb zircon dates\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSchaltegger, U.; Schoene, B.; Ovtcharova, M.; Sell, B. K.; Broderick, C. A.; Wotzlaw, J.\n\n2011-12-01\n\nRefined U-Pb dating techniques, applying an empirical chemical abrasion treatment prior to analysis [1], and using a precisely calibrated double isotope Pb, U EARTHTIME tracer solution, have led to an unprecedented <0.1% precision and accuracy of obtained 206Pb/238U dates of single zircon crystals or fragments. Results very often range over 10e4 to 10e6 years and cannot be treated as statistically singular age populations. The interpretation of precise zircon U-Pb ages is biased by two problems: (A) Post-crystallization Pb loss from decay damaged areas is considered to be mitigated by applying chemical abrasion techniques. The success of such treatment can, however, not be assumed a priori. The following examples demonstrate that youngest zircons are not biased by lead loss but represent close-to-youngest zircon growth: (i) coincidence of youngest zircon dates with co-magmatic titanite in tonalite; (ii) coincidence with statistically equivalent clusters of 206Pb/238U dates from zircon in residual melts of cogenetic mafic magmas; (iii) youngest zircons in ash beds of sedimentary sequences do not violate the stratigraphic superposition, whereas conventional statistical interpretation (mean or median values) does; (iv) results of published inter-laboratory cross-calibration tests using chemical abrasion on natural zircon crystals of the same sample arrive at the same 206Pb/238U result within <0.1% (e.g., [2]); (v) Youngest crystals coincide in age with the astronomical age of hosting cyclic sediments. Residual lead loss may, however, still be identified in the case of single, significantly younger dates (>3 sigma), and are common in many pre-Triassic and hydrothermally altered rocks. (B) Pre-eruptive/pre-intrusive growth is found to be the main reason for scattered zircon ages in igneous rocks. Zircons crystallizing from the final magma batch are called autocrystic [3]. Autocrystic growth will happen in a moving or stagnant magma shortly before or after the\n\nZircon Messengers Reveal the Age and History of Great Basin Crust, Kern Mountains, Nevada\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGottlieb, E. S.; Miller, E. L.; Wooden, J. L.\n\n2011-12-01\n\nResults of SHRIMP-RG analyses of complexly zoned zircons from muscovite-bearing granitic rocks exposed in the Kerns Mountains of East-Central Nevada constrain the timing, duration, and loci of zircon growth within the interior of the U.S. Cordillera during Late Cretaceous through Eocene time. The Kern Mountains are an exhumed block of greenschist to amphibolite facies metamorphosed miogeoclinal rocks that were pervasively intruded by the Late Cretaceous Tungstonia granite pluton and the Eocene Skinner Canyon and Uvada plutons (Best et al., 1974). Euhedral zircons separated from a coarse-grained (2-3 cm) muscovite-bearing phase of the Tungstonia pluton exhibit complex cathodeluminescence (CL) zonation. Sub-angular to sub-rounded cores with highly variable CL are overgrown by oscillatory-zoned zircon which in turn is rimmed by dark CL zircon (U>5000 ppm). A weighted mean Pb/U age of 70.2Â±0.9 Ma (n=20, MSWD=2.5) obtained from the oscillatory-zoned zircon coincides with the end of Cretaceous peak metamorphism at shallow crustal levels. Pb/U ages from core zones (n=18) predominantly are 0.9-1.4 Ga (n=11; 7 of which <15% discordant) or 2.4-2.7 Ga (n=5; 1 of which <15% discordant), consistent with ages of detrital zircons within the Late Proterozoic McCoy Creek Group exposed in adjacent ranges. A previously undated muscovite-bearing dike in Skinner Canyon yielded a texturally complex population of subhedral zircon grains. CL imaging of these grains reveals fragmental, ghost-like cores surrounded by irregularly shaped overgrowth zones with diffuse boundaries which are rimmed by oscillatory-zoned zircon. Both oscillatory zoned and gradational rim areas (n=32) yielded Late Cretaceous to Eocene ages. Twelve spots define the age of intrusion at 41.7Â±0.3 Ma (MSWD=1.8), consistent with the local onset of Eocene magmatism. An older period of zircon growth from ~75-45 Ma, coincident with the proposed duration of the Laramide shallow slab, is defined by zircon with flat to\n\nU-Pb Detrital Zircon Geochronologic Constraints on Depositional Age and Sediment Source Terrains of the Late Paleozoic Tepuel-Genoa Basin\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGriffis, N.

C.\n\n2014-12-01\n\nThe late Paleozoic Ice Age (LPIA) is the longest-lived icehouse of the Phanerozoic and the only time a metazoan dominated and vegetated world transitioned from an icehouse climate into a greenhouse. Despite several decades of research, the timing, extent of glaciation and the location of ice centers remain unresolved, which prohibits reconstruction of ice volume. The Permo-Carboniferous sediments in the Tepuel-Genoa Basin, Patagonia contains a near complete record of sedimentation from the lower Carboniferous through lower Permian. Outsized clasts, thin pebble-rich diamictites and slumps represent the last of the late Paleozoic glacially influenced deep-water marine sediments in the MojÃ³n de Hierro Fm. and the Paleozoic of Patagonia. U-Pb analysis of detrital zircons separated from slope sediments reveal groupings (20 myr bins, nâ¥5 zircons) with peak depositional ages of 420, 540 to 660 and 1040 Ma. Zircon age populations recovered from the MojÃ³n de Hierro Fm. compare well with bedrock ages of the Deseado Massif of SE Patagonia, suggesting this may be a potential source of sediments. The maximum depositional age of the sediments is 306.05 Â± 3.7 Ma (2Ï) as determined by the median age of the two youngest concordant zircons that overlap in error. The youngest zircon from the analysis yields a 238U/206Pb age of 301.3 Â± 4.5 Ma (2Ï; MSWD = 2.3). Younger zircons from the analysis compare well with the age of granite bedrock exposed along the basin margin to the E-NE suggesting they may reflect a more proximal source. These data, which indicate a maximum age of late Carboniferous for the MojÃ³n de Hierro Fm, provide the first geochemical constraints for the timing of final deposition of glaciomarine sediments in the Tepuel-Genoa Basin, and contributes to the biostratigraphic correlation of the late Paleozoic succession in Patagonia with other key LPIA basins that has thus far been hindered by faunal provincialism.\n\nSignatures of mountain building: Detrital zircon U/Pb ages from northeast Tibet\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nLease, Richard O.; Burbank, Douglas W.; Gehrels, George E.; Wang, Zhicai; Yuan, Daoyang\n\n2007-01-01\n\nAlthough detrital zircon has proven to be a powerful tool for determining provenance, past work has focused primarily on delimiting regional source terranes. Here we explore the limits of spatial resolution and stratigraphic sensitivity of detrital zircon in ascertaining provenance, and we demonstrate its ability to detect source changes for terranes separated by only a few tens of kilometers. For such an analysis to succeed for a given mountain, discrete intrarange source terranes must have unique U/Pb zircon age signatures and sediments eroded from the range must have well-defined depositional ages. Here we use â¼1400 single-grain U/Pb zircon ages from northeastern Tibet to identify and analyze an area that satisfies these conditions. This analysis shows that the edges of intermontane basins are stratigraphically sensitive to discrete, punctuated changes in local source terranes. By tracking eroding rock units chronologically through the stratigraphic record, this sensitivity permits the detection of the differential rock uplift and progressive erosion that began ca. 8 Ma in the Laji Shan, a 10-25-km-wide range in northeastern Tibet with a unique U/Pb age signature.\n\nContinental crustal history in SE Asia: Insights from zircon geochronology\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSevastjanova, I.; Hall, R.; Gunawan, I.; Ferdian, F.; Decker, J.\n\n2012-12-01\n\nIt is well known that SE Asia is underlain mostly by continental crust derived from Gondwana. However, there are still many uncertainties about the ages of protoliths, origin, arrival ages and history of different blocks, because much of the basement is unexposed. We have compiled previously published and new zircon U-Pb age and Hf isotope data from SE Asia. Our data set currently contains over 8400 U-Pb ages and over 600 Hf isotope analyses from sedimentary, metamorphic and igneous rocks and work is continuing to increase its size and the area covered. Zircons range in age from 3.4 Ga to near-zero. Archean zircons (>2.5 Ga) are rare in SE Asia and significant Archean populations (particularly zircons >2.8 Ga) are found only in East Java and the Sibumasu block of the Malay Peninsula. The presence of Archean zircons strongly suggests that the East Java and Sibumasu blocks were once situated near present-day Western Australia. Detrital Paleoproterozoic (ca. 1.9-1.8 Ga) zircons are abundant in many parts of SE Asia. In Sundaland (Malay Peninsula, Sumatra, West Java, Borneo) the most likely source for these zircons is the tin belt basement, but a north Australian source is more likely for eastern Indonesian samples. An early Mesoproterozoic (ca. 1.6-1.5 Ga) zircon population, particularly common in eastern Indonesia, is interpreted to be derived from central or northern Australia. Mesoproterozoic zircons, ca. 1.4 Ga, are common only on fragments that are now attached to or were previously part of the north Australian margin, such as the Bird's Head of New Guinea, Timor, Seram, Sulawesi and SW Borneo. Hf isotope characteristics of zircons from Seram are similar to those of zircons from eastern Australia. This supports the suggestion that Seram was part of the Australian margin. Late Meso- and early Neoproterozoic zircons (ca. 1.2-1.1 Ga, 900 Ma, and 600 Ma) are present, but not abundant, in SE Asia. Dominant Phanerozoic populations are Permian-Triassic, Cretaceous, and\n\nZircon ages in granulite facies rocks: decoupling from geochemistry above 850 Â°C?\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKunz, Barbara E.; Regis, Daniele; Engi, Martin\n\n2018-03-01\n\nGranulite facies rocks frequently show a large spread in their zircon ages, the interpretation of which raises questions: Has the isotopic system been disturbed? By what process(es) and conditions did the alteration occur? Can the dates be regarded as real ages, reflecting several growth episodes? Furthermore, under some circumstances of (ultra-)high-temperature metamorphism, decoupling of zircon U-Pb dates from their trace element geochemistry has been reported. Understanding these processes is crucial to help interpret such dates in the context of the P-T history. Our study presents evidence for decoupling in zircon from the highest grade metapelites (> 850 Â°C) taken along a continuous high-temperature metamorphic field gradient in the Ivrea Zone (NW Italy). These rocks represent a well-characterised segment of Permian lower continental crust with a protracted high-temperature history. Cathodoluminescence images reveal that zircons in the mid-amphibolite facies preserve mainly detrital cores with narrow overgrowths. In the upper amphibolite and granulite facies, preserved detrital cores decrease and metamorphic zircon increases in quantity. Across all samples we document a sequence of four rim generations based on textures. U-Pb dates, Th/U ratios and Ti-in-zircon concentrations show an essentially continuous evolution with increasing metamorphic grade, except in the samples from the granulite facies, which display significant scatter in age and chemistry. We associate the observed decoupling of zircon systematics in high-grade non-metamict zircon with disturbance processes related to differences in behaviour of non-formula elements (i.e. Pb, Th, U, Ti) at high-temperature conditions, notably differences in compatibility within the crystal structure.\n\nDetrital zircon age patterns and provenance of the metamorphic complexes of southern Chile\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHervÃ©, F.; Fanning, C. M.; Pankhurst, R. J.\n\n2003-05-01\n\nZircon SHRIMP U-Pb age patterns are reported for 13 metasedimentary rocks from the low grade metamorphic complexes of the Patagonian Andes. Combined with four recently published patterns, these provide the first detailed survey of the provenance of these complexes. The youngest dated zircons, corresponding to maximum sedimentation ages, are Devonian-Late Triassic in the eastern Andes metamorphic complex, Carboniferous in the main range metamorphic complex, Permian in the Duque de York complex, and Late Triassic in the Chonos metamorphic complex. In the last two cases, these ages are in agreement with their respective fossil ages. Older components in the eastern Andes metamorphic complex include a large proportion of Proterozoic (predominantly 1000-1200 Ma) zircons, which may indicate distribution, probably by rivers, of detrital material from regions currently in northern South America, Africa, or east Antarctica. The abundance of Proterozoic zircons is very much less in the Duque de York complex, possibly because of the rise of an inferred Permian magmatic arc related to the Gondwanan orogeny and consequent westward migration of the watershed. A Late Triassic magmatic episode is registered in the Chonos metamorphic complex, where reappearance of significant Proterozoic zircons indicates exhumation of the cratonic areas or of recycled sedimentary material.\n\nZircon U-Pb ages and Hf-O isotopic composition of migmatites from the Zanjan-Takab complex, NW Iran: Constraints on partial melting of metasediments\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMoghadam, Hadi Shafaii; Li, Xian-Hua; Stern, Robert J.; Ghorbani, Ghasem; Bakhshizad, Farzaneh\n\n2016-01-01\n\nWe study migmatites and other metamorphic rocks in the Zanjan-Takab region of NW Iran and use these results to report the first evidence of Oligocene core complex formation in Iran. Four samples of migmatites associated with paragneisses, including leucosomes and associated para-amphibolite melanosomes were selected for U-Pb dating and Hf-O isotopic analysis. Zircon cores - interpreted as originally detrital zircons - have variable ages that peak at ca. 100-110 Ma, but their sedimentation age - indicated by the youngest 206Pb/238U ages - is ca. 35-40 Ma. New zircons associated with incipient melting occur as overgrowths around zircon cores and/or as newly grown grains. Morphologies and internal structures suggest that rim growth and formation of new zircons were associated with partial melting. All four samples contain zircons with rims that yield 206Pb/238U ages of 28-25 Ma, indicating that partial melting occurred in Late Oligocene time. Î´18O values for zircon rims vary between 8.2 and 12.3â°, significantly higher than expected for mantle inputs (Î´18O 6â°) and consistent with equilibrium with surface materials. Zircon rims yield ÎµHf(t) between 2.2 and 12.4 and two-stage Hf model ages of 448-562 Ma, indicating that the region is underlain by Cadomian-Caledonian crust. According to the Hf-O isotopic values, the main mechanism forming zircon rims was dissolution of pre-existing detrital zircons with reprecipitation of new zircon shortly thereafter. Oligocene ages indicate that partial melting accompanied core complex formation in the Zanjan-Takab region. Extension, melting, and core complex formation in south-central Iran are Eocene in age, but younger ages of Oligocene-Miocene in NW Iran and Turkey indicate that extension was distributed throughout the region during Cenozoic time.\n\nConstraints on the age and provenance of the Chugach accretionary complex from detrital zircons in the Sitka Graywacke near Sitka, Alaska\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nHaeussler, Peter J.; Gehrels, George E.; Karl, Susan M.\n\n2006-01-01\n\nThe Sitka Graywacke is the westernmost and youngest unit of the Chugach accretionary complex in southeastern Alaska. Using laser-ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy, we obtained 492 detrital-zircon ages on seven typical samples of Sitka Graywacke turbidites, which were collected in a transect across much of the unit near Sitka, Alaska. Individual grains range in age from 66 to 1,802 m.y. The youngest peak ages on relative-probability plots of the western four samples (74, 72, 74, and 74 m.y., from west to east) are distinctly younger than the youngest peak ages of the eastern three samples (105, 103, and 97 m.y., from west to east). These youngest peak ages set maximum depositional ages for each sample. We suggest that these peak ages are not significantly older (within ~5 m.y.) than the depositional age of the Sitka Graywacke because the deposits accumulated in a trench along a convergent margin, where magmatic sources likely continuously introduced juvenile zircons. The differences in the youngest cluster of detrital-zircon ages between the eastern and western sample localities is likely due to both a change in provenance and a fault. The similarity of the youngest peak ages in the Sitka Graywacke to fossil ages in the Valdez Group, in Prince William Sound, implies that the western part of the Sitka Graywacke is correlative with the Valdez Group, as previously inferred. However, the eastern part of the Sitka Graywacke has youngest detrital-zircon ages older than fossil ages in the Valdez Group and younger than fossil ages in the McHugh Complex, which in south-central Alaska is the oldest part of the accretionary complex. The age distribution of zircons in the older, eastern sequence suggests sources along the British Columbia margin. The detrital-zircon ages in the younger, western sequence are similar to igneous ages from south-central Alaska to southern British Columbia.

Sundaland comprises Indochina, the Thai-Malay Peninsula, Sumatra, Java, Borneo, and the shallow shelf between these landmasses. It is a composite region of continental crustal fragments that are separated by sutures that represent remnant ocean basins and volcanic arcs. The Malay Peninsula includes two of these fragments - East Malaya and Sibumasu - separated by the Bentong-Raub Suture Zone. The latter is a Palaeo-Tethyan ocean remnant. Granitoids of the Malay Peninsula are the major sources of detrital zircon in Sundaland. East Malaya is intruded by Permian-Triassic Eastern Province granitoids interpreted as products of Palaeozoic subduction of oceanic crust beneath the East Malaya Volcanic Arc. Sibumasu is intruded by Triassic Main Range Province granitoids interpreted as syn- to post-collisional magmatism following suturing to East Malaya. Locally, there are minor Late Cretaceous plutons. Basements of Sibumasu and East Malaya are not exposed and their ages are poorly constrained. The exact timing of the collision between these fragments is also contentious. In order to resolve these uncertainties, 752 U-Pb analyses from 9 samples were carried out on detrital zircons from modern rivers draining the Malay Peninsula and, of these, 243 grains from 6 samples were selected for Hf-isotope analyses. U-Pb zircon ages show that small numbers of Neoarchean-Proterozoic grains are consistently present in all samples, but do not form prominent populations. Permian-Triassic populations are dominant. Only one sample contains a small Jurassic population probably sourced from the area of Thailand and most likely recycled from fluvial-alluvial Mesozoic 'red-beds'. Late Cretaceous populations are locally abundant. Hf-isotope crustal model ages suggest that basement beneath the Malay Peninsula is heterogeneous. Some basement may be Neoarchean but there is no evidence for basement older than 2.8 Ga beneath\n\nTesting the reliability of information extracted from ancient zircon\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKielman, Ross; Whitehouse, Martin; Nemchin, Alexander\n\n2015-04-01\n\nStudies combining zircon U-Pb chronology, trace element distribution as well as O and Hf isotope systematics are a powerful way to gain understanding of the processes shaping Earth's evolution, especially in detrital populations where constraints from the original host are missing. Such studies of the Hadean detrital zircon population abundant in sedimentary rocks in Western Australia have involved analysis of an unusually large number of individual grains, but also highlighted potential problems with the approach, only apparent when multiple analyses are obtained from individual grains. A common feature of the Hadean as well as many early Archaean zircon populations is their apparent inhomogeneity, which reduces confidence in conclusions based on studies combining chemistry and isotopic characteristics of zircon. In order to test the reliability of information extracted from early Earth zircon, we report results from one of the first in-depth multi-method study of zircon from a relatively simple early Archean magmatic rock, used as an analogue to ancient detrital zircon. The approach involves making multiple SIMS analyses in individual grains in order to be comparable to the most advanced studies of detrital zircon populations. The investigated sample is a relatively undeformed, non-migmatitic ca. 3.8 Ga tonalite collected a few kms south of the Isua Greenstone Belt, southwest Greenland. Extracted zircon grains can be combined into three different groups based on the behavior of their U-Pb systems: (i) grains that show internally consistent and concordant ages and define an average age of 3805Â±15 Ma, taken to be the age of the rock, (ii) grains that are distributed close to the concordia line, but with significant variability between multiple analyses, suggesting an ancient Pb loss and (iii) grains that have multiple analyses distributed along a discordia pointing towards a zero intercept, indicating geologically recent Pb-loss. This overall behavior has\n\nZircon U-Pb dating of eclogite from the Qiangtang terrane, north-central Tibet: a case of metamorphic zircon with magmatic geochemical features\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZhai, Qing-guo; Jahn, Bor-ming; Li, Xian-hua; Zhang, Ru-yuan; Li, Qiu-li; Yang, Ya-nan; Wang, Jun; Liu, Tong; Hu, Pei-yuan; Tang, Suo-han\n\n2017-06-01\n\nZircon is probably the most important mineral used in the dating formation of high-pressure (HP) and ultrahigh-pressure (UHP) metamorphic rocks. The origin of zircon, i.e., magmatic or metamorphic, is commonly assessed by its external morphology, internal structure, mineral inclusions, Th/U ratios and trace element composition. In this study, we present an unusual case of metamorphic zircon from the Qiangtang eclogite, north-central Tibet. The zircon grains contain numerous eclogite-facies mineral inclusions, including omphacite, phengite, garnet and rutile; hence, they are clearly of metamorphic origin. However, they display features similar to common magmatic zircon, including euhedral crystal habit, high Th/U ratios and enriched heavy rare earth elements pattern. We suggest that these zircon grains formed from a different reservoir from that for garnet where no trace elements was present and trace element equilibrium between zircon and garnet was achieved. U-Pb dating of zircon gave an age of 232-237 Ma for the eclogite, and that of rutile yielded a slightly younger age of ca. 217 Ma. These ages are consistent with the reported Lu-Hf mineral isochron and phengite Ar-Ar ages. The zircon U-Pb and mineral Lu-Hf isochron ages are interpreted as the time of the peak eclogite-facies metamorphism, whereas the rutile U-Pb and phengite Ar-Ar ages represent the time of exhumation to the middle crust. Thus, the distinction between metamorphic and magmatic zircons cannot be made using only Th/U ratios and heavy REE compositions for HP-UHP metamorphic rocks of oceanic derivation.\n\nCoupling of Uranium and Thorium Series Isotope Systematics for Age Determination of Late Pleistocene Zircons using LA-ICP-MS\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSakata, S.; Hirakawa, S.; Iwano, H.; Danhara, T.; Hirata, T.\n\n2014-12-01\n\nZircon U-Th-Pb dating method is one of the most important tools for estimating the duration of magmatism by means of coupling of uranium, actinium and thorium decay series. Using U-Pb dating method, its reliability is principally guaranteed by the concordance between 238U-206Pb and 235U-207Pb ages. In case of dating Quaternary zircons, however, the initial disequilibrium effect on 230Th and 231Pa should be considered. On the other hands, 232Th-208Pb dating method can be a simple but powerful approach for investigating the age of crystallization because of negligible influence from initial disequilibrium effect. We have developed a new correction model for accurate U-Pb dating of the young zircon samples by taking into consideration of initial disequilibrium and a U-Pb vs Th-Pb concordia diagram for reliable age calibration was successfully established. Hence, the U-Th-Pb dating method can be applied to various zircons ranging from Hadean (4,600 Ma) to Quaternary (~50 ka) ages, and this suggests that further detailed information concerning the thermal history of the geological sequences can be made by the coupling of U-Th-Pb, fission track and Ar-Ar ages. In this presentation, we will show an example of U-Th-Pb dating for zircon samples from Sambe Volcano (3 to 100 ka), southwest Japan and the present dating technique using LA-ICP-MS.\n\nMass-spectrometric mining of Hadean zircons by automated SHRIMP multi-collector and single-collector U/Pb zircon age dating: The first 100,000 grains\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHolden, Peter; Lanc, Peter; Ireland, Trevor R.; Harrison, T. Mark; Foster, John J.; Bruce, Zane\n\n2009-09-01\n\nThe identification and retrieval of a large population of ancient zircons (>4 Ga; Hadean) is of utmost priority if models of the early evolution of Earth are to be rigorously tested. We have developed a rapid and accurate U-Pb zircon age determination protocol utilizing a fully automated multi-collector ion microprobe, the ANU SHRIMP II, to screen and date these zircons. Unattended data acquisition relies on the calibration of a digitized sample map to the Sensitive High Resolution Ion MicroProbe (SHRIMP) sample-stage co-ordinate system. High precision positioning of individual grains can be produced through optical image processing of a specified mount location. The focal position of the mount can be optimized through a correlation between secondary-ion steering and the spot position on the target. For the Hadean zircon project, sample mounts are photographed and sample locations (normally grain centers) are determined off-line. The sample is loaded, reference points calibrated, and the target positions are then visited sequentially. In SHRIMP II multiple-collector mode, zircons are initially screened (ca. 5 s data acquisition) through their 204Pb corrected 207Pb/206Pb ratio; suitable candidates are then analyzed in a longer routine to obtain better measurement statistics, U/Pb, and concentration data. In SHRIMP I and SHRIMP RG, we have incorporated the automated analysis protocol to single-collector measurements. These routines have been used to analyze over 100,000 zircons from the Jack Hills quartzite. Of these, ca. 7%, have an age greater than 3.8 Ga, the oldest grain being 4372 +/- 6 Ma (2[sigma]), and this age is part of a group of analyses around 4350 Ma which we interpret as the age when continental crust first began to coalesce in this region. In multi-collector mode, the analytical time taken for a single mount with 400 zircons is approximately 6 h; whereas in single-collector mode, the analytical time is ca. 17 h. With this productivity, we can produce\n\nZircon U-Pb ages and Hf isotopic compositions indicate multiple sources for Grenvillian detrital zircon deposited in western Laurentia\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHoward, Amanda L.; Farmer, G. Lang; Amato, Jeffrey M.; Fedo, Christopher M.\n\n2015-12-01\n\nCombined U-Pb ages and Hf isotopic data from 1.0 Ga to 1.3 Ga (Grenvillian) detrital zircon in Neoproterozoic and Cambrian siliciclastic sedimentary rocks in southwest North America, and from igneous zircon in potential Mesoproterozoic source rocks, are used to better assess the provenance of detrital zircon potentially transported across Laurentia in major river systems originating in the Grenville orogenic highlands. High-precision hafnium isotopic analyses of individual â¼1.1 Ga detrital zircon from Neoproterozoic siliciclastic sedimentary rocks in Sonora, northern Mexico, reveal that these zircons have low ÎµHf (0) (-22 to -26) and were most likely derived from â¼1.1 Ga granitic rocks embedded in local Mojave Province Paleoproterozoic crust. In contrast, Grenvillian detrital zircons in Cambrian sedimentary rocks in Sonora, the Great Basin, and the Mojave Desert, have generally higher ÎµHf (0) (-15 to -21) as demonstrated both by high precision solution-based, and by lower precision laser ablation, ICPMS data and were likely derived from more distal sources further to the east/southeast in Laurentia. Comparison to new and existing zircon U-Pb geochronology and Hf isotopic data from Grenvillian crystalline rocks from the Appalachian Mountains, central and west Texas, and from Paleoproterozoic terranes throughout southwest North America reveals that zircon in Cambrian sandstones need not entirely represent detritus transported across the continent from Grenville province rocks in the vicinity of the present-day southern Appalachian Mountains. Instead, these zircons could have been derived from more proximal, high ÎµHf (0), â¼1.1 Ga, crystalline rocks such as those exposed today in the Llano Uplift in central Texas and in the Franklin Mountains of west Texas.

Thermal annealing followed by CA techniques were used for ID-TIMS dating of a sub-set of zircon crystals previously analyzed by SIMS. Prior to TIMS analyses, zircon crystals were imaged by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to evaluate the effects of CA on crystal domains sampled by SIMS. SEM images reveal that whole portions of crystals were removed by the CA technique, and a heterogeneous pattern of etching that was not confined to specific compositional zones visible in cathodoluminescence. Most of the SIMS sputter pits that yield spurious ages, are associated with etching and/or preferential annealing by the combined annealing and CA technique, suggesting that the young ages relative to the 40Ar/39Ar age may be due to Pb loss. ID-TIMS yields a coherent U-Pb age population of 18.8 Ma, with several older and younger crystals that might reflect xenocrysts, Pb-loss, and/or younger crystallization. In order to maintain spatial resolution and further evaluate the effects of Pb-loss in PST zircon, the annealing and CA-technique will be applied to zircon prior to SIMS dating.

Cathodoluminescence (CL) imaging reveals both old, multistage zircons with complex growth histories and inherited cores, and young, first-cycle magmatic zircons. Paleoproterozoic ages between 2,200 and 1,800 Ma (K23 and S1), an age gap of 1,800-1,000 Ma for S1 and abundant Cadomian grains, indicate NW African/North Gondwanan derivation of these zircons. Also, A16 yields ages between 630 and 600 Ma that can be attributed to \"Pan-African\" orogenic processes. Significant differences are seen for the <500 Ma part of the age spectra with major age peaks at 493-494 and 344-335 Ma (K23 and S1), and 477 and 287 Ma (A16). All three samples show negative initial ÉHf signatures (-25 to -10, except one grain with +9.4) implying zircon crystallization from magmas derived by recycling of older continental crust. Hf isotopic compositions of 330- to 320-Ma-old zircons from S1 and K23 preclude a derivation from Bavarian Forest granites and intermediate granitoids. Rather, all the data suggest strong contributions of eroded local rocks (South Bohemian pluton, GfÃ¶hl unit) to loess material at the SE edge of the Bohemian Massif (K23 and S1) and sourcing of zircons from sediment donor regions in the Eastern Alps for loess at Wels (A16). We tentatively infer primary fluvial transport and secondary eolian reworking and re-deposition of detritus from western/southwestern directions. Finally, our data highlight that loess zircon ages are fundamentally influenced by fluvial transport, its directions, the interplay of sediment donor regions through the mixing of detritus and zircon fertility of rocks, rather than Paleowind directions.\n\nZircon U-Th and U-Pb Ages From Quaternary Silicic Volcanic and Plutonic Rocks, and Their Bearing on Granitoid Batholiths\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBacon, C. R.\n\n2007-12-01\n\nplutons near Mount Rainier and the Colorado River were emplaced and crystallized in pulses over ~2-3-Myr periods, some with coeval volcanics; and (4) Cretaceous batholiths in the Sierra Nevada and North Cascades preserve evidence of assembly over as much as 10 Myr; individual samples contain zircons that crystallized during intervals of >1 Myr. Zircon ages and wide-ranging trace element concentrations suggest crystallization mainly in differentiated melt pockets in high-crystallinity magmas that may repeatedly freeze and thaw. Some high-Th/U, incompatible-element rich, spongy textured zircons grew very late, in the presence of oxidizing fluid. Not all zircons survive recycling into undersaturated magmas, in which zircon will dissolve given enough time, depending on temperature and dissolved volatiles. Recent zircon geochronologic results for volcanic and plutonic rocks lend credence to the \"mush model\" of rhyolite genesis and batholith consolidation. Crystal-poor rhyolites and leucogranites are melts segregated by compaction or gas-driven filter pressing from granitoid crystal mush emplaced incrementally in the middle to upper crust and powered by basaltic magma repeatedly injected into the lower reaches of the mush column. Balance between heat loss and basaltic influx determines whether the mush freezes or partially thaws at any given time, blurs internal contacts in resulting plutons, and can produce large volumes of crystal-rich ignimbrite or rapid separation and eruption of crystal-poor rhyolite. Lifetimes of the largest volcano-plutonic systems, such as the Altiplano-Puna or Southern Rocky Mountains volcanic fields, are comparable to the ~10 Myr of the Tuolumne Intrusive Suite.\n\nCrustal Zircons from the Podiform Chromitites in Luobusa Ophiolite, Tibet\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nYamamoto, S.; Komiya, T.; Maruyama, S.\n\n2004-12-01\n\nin chromitites come from? It has been recognized that this ophiolite was formed at 110-120 Ma based on radiolaria in cherts overlying the pillow lavas (ALLEGRE et al., 1984; ZIABREV et al., 2003). In this study, the minimum age of 107 Ma, which we obtained from zircon in chromitites, is consistent to the age of the ophiolite. But, all other ages of zircons are much older than that of ophiolite. Yang et al. (2001) also reported U-Pb zircon ages of 450-910 Ma and Re-Os iridosmine age of 400 Ma from chromitites in Luobusa ophiolite. Mineral inclusions within zircons are crustal materials, which means that these zircons were crystallized in the low pressure crustal condition. Thus these zircons within chromitites are interpreted as xenocrysts from old crustal materials. Recently, old-age zircons (330 to 1600 Ma) were also reported from the Mid Atlantic Ridge MORBs (PILOT et al., 1998). They suggest one possibility that these old-age zircons may have derived from old continental crustal material, which have assimilated with the MORB magma during ascent. Moreover, Archean zircons were reported from pyroxenite dikes in Jormua ophiolite (PETRI et al., 2003). YU et al. (2001) reported that zircons from chromitites in Luobusa ophiolite have shorter inter-atomic distances of Zr-O and Si-O bonds. As a result, they concluded that Tibetan-zircons were derived from the high-pressure mantle environment. Judging from the line of evidence mentioned above, it is highly possible that these zircons captured by chromitites were originated from recycled crustal materials, convecting through upper mantle.\n\nDetrital zircon ages from southern Norway - implications for the Proterozoic evolution of the southwestern Baltic Shield\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKnudsen, T.-L.; Andersen, T.; Whitehouse, M. J.; Vestin, J.\n\nAn ion-microprobe (SIMS) U-Pb zircon dating study on four samples of Precambrian metasediments from the high-grade Bamble Sector, southern Norway, gives the first information on the timing of discrete crust-forming events in the SW part of the Baltic Shield. Recent Nd and Pb studies have indicated that the sources of the clastic metasediments in this area have crustal histories extending back to 1.7 to 2.1Ga, although there is no record of rocks older than 1.6Ga in southern Norway. The analysed metasediments are from a sequence of intercalated, centimetre to 10-metre wide units of quartzites, semi-metapelites, metapelites and mafic granulites. The zircons can be grouped in two morphological populations: (1) long prismatic; (2) rounded, often flattened. The BSE images reveal that both populations consist of oscillatory zoned, rounded and corroded cores (detrital grains of magmatic origin), surrounded by homogeneous rims (metamorphic overgrowths). The detrital zircons have 207Pb/206Pb ages between 1367 and 1939Ma, with frequency maxima in the range 1.85 to 1.70Ga and 1.60 to 1.50Ga. There is no correlation between crystal habit and age of the zircon. One resorbed, inner zircon core in a detrital grain is strongly discordant and gives a composite inner core-magmatic outer core 207Pb/206Pb age of 2383 Ma. Two discrete, unzoned zircons have 207Pb/206Pb ages of 1122 and 1133Ma, representing zircon growth during the Sveconorwegian high-grade metamorphism. Also the Î¼m wide overgrowths, embayments in the detrital cores and apparent ``inner cores'' which represent secondary metamorphic zircon growth in deep embayments in detrital grains, are of Sveconorwegian age. The composite-detrital-metamorphic zircon analyses give generally discordant 206Pb/238U versus 207Pb/235U ratios and maximum 207Pb/206Pb ages of 1438Ma. These data demonstrate the existence of a protocrust of 1.7 to 2.0Ga in the southwestern part of the Baltic Shield, implying a break in the overall westward\n\nErosional history of the Appalachians as recordeed in detrital zircon fission-track ages and lithic detritus in Atlantic Coastal Plain sediments\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nNaeser, C.W.; Naeser, N.D.; Edwards, Lucy E.; Weems, Robert E.; Southworth, C. Scott; Newell, Wayne L.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nComparison of fission-track (FT) ages of detrital zircons recovered from Atlantic Coastal Plain sediments to FT ages of zircons from bedrock in source terranes in the Appalachians provides a key to understanding the provenance of the sediments and, in turn, the erosional and depositional history of the Atlantic passive margin.In Appalachian source terranes, the oldest zircon fission-track (ZFT) ages from bedrock in the western Appalachians (defined for this paper as the Appalachian Plateau, Valley and Ridge, and far western Blue Ridge) are notably older than the oldest ages from bedrock in the eastern Appalachians (Piedmont and main part of the Blue Ridge). The age difference is seen both in ZFT sample ages and in individual zircon grain ages and reflects differences in the thermotectonic history of the rocks. In the east, ZFT data indicate that the rocks cooled from temperatures high enough to partially or totally reset ZFT ages during the Paleozoic and (or) Mesozoic. The majority of the rocks are interpreted to have cooled through the ZFT closure temperature (â¼235 Â°C) at various times during the late Paleozoic Alleghanian orogeny. In contrast, most of the rocks sampled in the western Appalachians have never been heated to temperatures high enough to totally reset their ZFT ages. Reflecting their contrasting thermotectonic histories, nearly 80 percent of the sampled western rocks yield one or more zircon grains with very old FT ages, in excess of 800 Ma; zircon grains yielding FT ages this old have not been found in rocks in the Piedmont and main part of the Blue Ridge. The ZFT data suggest that the asymmetry of zircon ages of exposed bedrock in the eastern and western Appalachians was in evidence by no later than the Early Cretaceous and probably by the Late Triassic.Detrital zircon suites from sands collected in the Atlantic Coastal Plain provide a record of detritus eroded from source terranes in the Appalachians during the Mesozoic and Cenozoic.

Poorly exposed, its age and correlation are uncertain. Is it part of the Pigeon Point section west of the San GregorioâHosgri fault? Does it rest on Nacimiento block basement? Is it dextrally offset from the Oligocene Cambria Felsite, â¼185 km to the southeast? Why is a calc-alkaline hypabyssal igneous rock intrusive into the outboard accretionary prism? To address these questions, we analyzed 43 oscillatory-zoned zircon crystals from three incipiently recrystallized pumpellyite Â± prehnite Â± laumontite-bearing Pescadero felsite samples by sensitive high-resolution ion microprobeâreverse geometry (SHRIMP-RG) and laser ablationâinductively coupled plasmaâmass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) techniques. Thirty-three zircons gave late Mesozoic U-Pb ages, with single-grain values ranging from 81 to 167 Ma; ten have pre-Mesozoic, chiefly Proterozoic ages. A group of the four youngest Pescadero zircons yielded an apparent maximum igneous age of ca. 86â90 Ma. Reflecting broad age scatter and presence of partly digested sandstone inclusions, we interpret the rest of the zircons (perhaps all) as xenocrysts. Twenty-three zircons were separated and analyzed from two samples of the similar Cambria Felsite, yielding a unimodal 27 Ma U-Pb age. Clearly, the origin of the Upper Oligocene Cambria Felsite is different from that of the Upper Cretaceous Pescadero felsite; these rocks are not correlated, and do not constrain displacement along the San GregorioâHosgri fault. Peak ages differ slightly, but relative probability curves for Mesozoic and pre-Mesozoic Pescadero zircons compare well, for example, with abundant U-Pb age data for detrital zircons from Franciscan metaclastic strata â¼100 km to the east in the Diablo RangeâSan Francisco Bay area, San Joaquin Great Valley Group turbidites, Upper Cretaceous Nacimiento block Franciscan strata, and Upper\n\nLA-ICP-MS zircon U-Pb and muscovite K-Ar ages of basement rocks from the south arm of Sulawesi, Indonesia\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nJaya, Asri; Nishikawa, Osamu; Hayasaka, Yasutaka\n\n2017-11-01\n\nThe zircon U-Pb and muscovite K-Ar age from the Bantimala, Barru and Biru basement complexes in the South Arm of Sulawesi, Indonesia provide new information regarding the timing of magmatism, metamorphism and sedimentation in this region and have implications for the origin and evolution of the study area. The study area is at the juncture between the southeast margin of Sundaland and Bird's Head-Australia. The age of both the zircon U-Pb of detrital materials in the Bantimala Complex and the muscovite K-Ar of amphibolite in the Biru Complex fall in the Late Early Cretaceous (between 109 and 115 Ma), which is a similar age range to previous data for both the sedimentary and metamorphic rocks. The youngest detrital zircon in the schist samples from the Barru Complex fall into the Triassic in age (between 243 and 247 Ma). These age data indicate that the protolith of all three basement complexes were involved in the subduction system and metamorphosed in the late Early Cretaceous, but there are several differences in their deposition environment under and out of the influence of the late Early Cretaceous magmatism in the Bantimala and Barru Complexes, respectively. Felsic igneous activities are confirmed in the Late Cretaceous and the Eocene by the zircon U-Pb age of igneous rocks intruding or included as detrital fragments in three basement complexes. These dates are similar to those reported from the Meratus Complex of South Kalimantan. The detrital zircon age distributions of the basement rocks in the South Arm of Sulawesi display predominant Mesozoic (Cretaceous and Triassic) and Paleozoic populations with a small population of Proterozoic ages supporting the hypothesis that the West Sulawesi block originated from the region of the circum Bird's Head-Australian, namely the Inner Banda block. The absence of Jurassic zircon age population in the South Arm of Sulawesi suggests the division of the South Arm of Sulawesi from the Inner Banda block in early stage of\n\nPermian single crystal U-Pb zircon age of the RoÅ¾Åava Formation volcanites (Southern Gemeric Unit, Western Carpathians, Slovakia)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nVozÃ¡rovÃ¡, Anna; Å melko, MiloÅ¡; Paderin, Ilya\n\n2009-12-01\n\nZircon populations from the RoÅ¾Åava Formation volcanic rock complex have been analysed. Euhedral zircons from the 1st volcanogenic horizon with fine oscillatory growth zoning, typical of magmatic origin, gave the average concordia age of 273.3 Â± 2.8 Ma, with Th/U ratios in the range of 0.44-0.73. The Permian ages ranging from 266 to 284 Ma were identified in the wider, zoned or unzoned, central zircon parts, as well as in their fine-zoned oscillatory rims. The average concordia age of 275.3 Â± 2.9 was obtained from the euhedral zircon population of the 2nd volcanogenic horizon of the RoÅ¾Åava Formation. The analyses were performed on zoned magmatic zircons in the age interval from 267 to 287 Ma, with Th/U ratios in the range of 0.39-0.75. In the later zircon population two inherited zircon grains were dated giving the age of 842 Â± 12 Ma (Neoproterozoic) and 456 Â± 7 Ma (Late Ordovician). The magmatic zircon ages document the Kungurian age of Permian volcanic activity and contemporaneous establishment of the south-Gemeric basin. The time span of volcanic activity corresponds to the collapse of the Western Carpathian Variscan foreland which expanded southward.\n\nProvenance studies by fission-track dating of zircon-etching and counting procedures\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nNaeser, N.D.; Zeitler, P.K.; Naeser, C.W.; Cerveny, P.F.\n\n1987-01-01\n\nIn sedimentary rocks that have not been heated to high enough temperatures to anneal fission tracks in zircon (greater than â 160Â°C), fission-track ages of individual detrital zircon grains provide valuable information about the source rocks eroded to form the sediments. The success of such studies depends, however, on the degree to which the ages determined from the detrital suite accurately portray the range of grain ages that are present in the suite. This in turn depends to a large extent on using counting and, in particular, etching procedures that permit proper sampling of grains with a wide range of age and uranium concentrations. Results are reported here of an experimental study of a âdetritalâ zircon suite manufactured from several zircon populations of known age. This study suggests that multiple etches are required when a complete spectrum of ages in a zircon suite is desired.\n\nProvenance studies by fission-track dating of zircon-etching and counting procedures\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nNaeser, Nancy D.; Zeitler, Peter K.; Naeser, Charles W.; Cerveny, Philip F.\n\n1987-01-01\n\nIn sedimentary rocks that have not been heated to high enough temperatures to anneal fission tracks in zircon (greater than approximately equals 160 degree C), fission-track ages of individual detrital zircon grains provide valuable information about the source rocks eroded to form the sediments. The success of such studies depends, however, on the degree to which the ages determined from the detrital suite accurately portray the range of grain ages that are present in the suite. This in turn depends to a large extent on using counting and, in particular, etching procedures that permit proper sampling of grains with a wide range of age and uranium concentrations. Results are reported here of an experimental study of a 'detrital' zircon suite manufactured from several zircon populations of known age. This study suggests that multiple etches are required when a complete spectrum of ages in a zircon suite is desired.\n\nUPb ages of zircon rims: A new analytical method using the air-abrasion technique\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nAleinikoff, J.N.; Winegarden, D.L.; Walter, M.\n\n1990-01-01\n\nWe present a new technique for directly dating, by conventional techniques, the rims of zircons. Several circumstances, such as a xenocrystic or inherited component in igneous zircon and metamorphic overgrowths on igneous cores, can result in grains with physically distinct age components. Pneumatic abrasion has been previously shown by Krogh to remove overgrowths and damaged areas of zircon, leaving more resistant and isotopically less disturbed parts available for analysis. A new abrader design, which is capable of very gently grinding only tips and interfacial edges of even needle-like grains, permits easy collection of abraded material for dating. Five examples demonstrate the utility of the \"dust-collecting\" technique, including two studies that compare conventional, ion microprobe and abrader data. Common Pb may be strongly concentrated in the outermost zones of many zircons and this Pb is not easily removed by leaching (even in weak HF). Thus, the benefit of removing only the outermost zones (and avoiding mixing of age components) is somewhat compromised by the much higher common Pb contents which result in less precise age determinations. A very brief abrasion to remove the high common Pb zones prior to collection of material for dating is selected. ?? 1990.\n\nDevonian to Carboniferous collision in the Greenland Caledonides: U-Pb zircon and Sm-Nd ages of high-pressure and ultrahigh-pressure metamorphism\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGilotti, Jane A.; Nutman, Allen P.; Brueckner, Hannes K.\n\n2004-10-01\n\n/U values than the HP ones, no Eu anomaly, and are thus comparable to UHP zircons in the literature. The 206Pb/238U age of these zircons is 360Â±5 Ma, much younger than the HP eclogites. The same sample gives a Sm-Nd age of 342Â±6 Ma. Unlike the HP eclogites, the Sm-Nd age of the UHP rock is ca. 20 Ma younger than the U-Pb zircon age and most likely records slow cooling through the closure temperature, since peak temperatures were in excess of 900Â°C. Widespread HP metamorphism of both the Laurentian and Baltica continental margins marks the culmination of this continent continent collision in the Devonian. Carboniferous UHP conditions, though localized in the east, suggest a prolonged collisional history rather than a short-lived Scandian orogeny. The traditional Silurian Scandian orogeny should thus be extended through the Devonian.\n\nTi-in-Zircon Thermometer: Preliminary Results\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFu, B.; Cavosie, A.
