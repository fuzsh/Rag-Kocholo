        "text": "U-Pb Dating of Calcite by LA-ICPMS\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHacker, B. R.; Kylander-Clark, A. R.; Holder, R. M.; Nuriel, P.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nAn emerging frontier area in geochronology is U-Pb dating of carbonate minerals by laser-ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICPMS). The spate of papers over the last few years applying LA-ICPMS to carbonate dating stems from the capability of LA-ICPMS to deal with the variable, and often low, U/Pb ratios of carbonate. LA-ICPMS is an excellent tool for efficiently screening out samples with low U/Pb ratios and provides the ability to measure many spots with different U/Pb ratios and obtain dates free of assumptions about the composition of common Pb. Because this technique is in its infancy, important questions remain. What percentage of carbonate samples have high enough U/Pbc ratios that they can be dated? What percentage of samples yield isochronous datasets? What are the limits on precision and accuracy of carbonate U/Pb dates? What is the best analytical method in the absence of isotopically homogeneous reference materials? Through the generosity of our colleagues we have acquired 8 reference materials ranging in age from 3 to 250 Ma. We have analyzed 125 unknowns from a variety of locations using a 193 nm ns laser with an 80-100 Î¼m spot and a Nu Plasma HR-ES. We measure 207Pb/206Pb using NIST 614 glass and then calculate a 206Pb/238U correction factor based on the measured vs. known ages of the reference materials. Sixty of these samples ( 50%) have high enough U/Pb ratios that they can be dated. There is great heterogeneity among the sample suites: some have no datable samples, whereas one suite of 68 samples yielded 53 datable rocks. Of the samples with high U/Pbc ratios, a majority yielded isochronous U-Pb data, indicating that the U-Pb system closed at a given time and was not subsequently disturbed.\n\nU-Pb SHRIMP dating of uraniferous opals\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nNemchin, A.A.; Neymark, L.A.; Simons, S.L.\n\n2006-01-01\n\nU-Pb and U-series analyses of four U-rich opal samples using sensitive high-resolution ion microprobe (SHRIMP) demonstrate the potential of this technique for the dating of opals with ages ranging from several tens of thousand years to millions of years. The major advantages of the technique, compared to the conventional thermal ionisation mass spectrometry (TIMS), are the high spatial resolution (???20 ??m), the ability to analyse in situ all isotopes required to determine both U-Pb and U-series ages, and a relatively short analysis time which allows obtaining a growth rate of opal as a result of a single SHRIMP session. There are two major limitations to this method, determined by both current level of development of ion probes and understanding of ion sputtering processes. First, sufficient secondary ion beam intensities can only be obtained for opal samples with U concentrations in excess of ???20 ??g/g. However, this restriction still permits dating of a large variety of opals. Second, U-Pb ratios in all analyses drifted with time and were only weakly correlated with changes in other ratios (such as U/UO). This drift, which is difficult to correct for, remains the main factor currently limiting the precision and accuracy of the U-Pb SHRIMP opal ages. Nevertheless, an assumption of similar behaviour of standard and unknown opals under similar analytical conditions allowed successful determination of ages with precisions of ???10% for the samples investigated in this study. SHRIMP-based U-series and U-Pb ages are consistent with TIMS dating results of the same materials and known geological timeframes. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

M.; Crowley, J. L.; Cottle, J. M.\n\n2012-12-01\n\nIt is increasingly common that hand samples of plutonic and volcanic rocks contain zircon with dates that span between zero and >100 ka. This recognition comes from the increased application of U-series geochronology on young volcanic rocks and the increased precision to better than 0.1% on single zircons by the U-Pb ID-TIMS method. It has thus become more difficult to interpret such complicated datasets in terms of ashbed eruption or magma emplacement, which are critical constraints for geochronologic applications ranging from biotic evolution and the stratigraphic record to magmatic and metamorphic processes in orogenic belts. It is important, therefore, to develop methods that aid in interpreting which minerals, if any, date the targeted process. One promising tactic is to better integrate accessory mineral geochemistry with high-precision ID-TIMS U-Pb geochronology. These dual constraints can 1) identify cogenetic populations of minerals, and 2) record magmatic or metamorphic fluid evolution through time. Goal (1) has been widely sought with in situ geochronology and geochemical analysis but is limited by low-precision dates. Recent work has attempted to bridge this gap by retrieving the typically discarded elution from ion exchange chemistry that precedes ID-TIMS U-Pb geochronology and analyzing it by ICP-MS (U-Pb TIMS-TEA). The result integrates geochemistry and high-precision geochronology from the exact same volume of material. The limitation of this method is the relatively coarse spatial resolution compared to in situ techniques, and thus averages potentially complicated trace element profiles through single minerals or mineral fragments. In continued work, we test the effect of this on zircon by beginning with CL imaging to reveal internal zonation and growth histories. This is followed by in situ LA-ICPMS trace element transects of imaged grains to reveal internal geochemical zonation. The same grains are then removed from grain-mount, fragmented, and\n\nIntra-grain Common Pb Correction and Detrital Apatite U-Pb Dating via LA-ICPMS Depth Profiling\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBoyd, P. D.; Galster, F.; Stockli, D. F.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nApatite is a common accessory phase in igneous and sedimentary rocks. While apatite is widely employed as a low-temperature thermochronometric tool, it has been increasingly utilized to constrain moderate temperature cooling histories by U-Pb dating. Apatite U-Pb is characterized by a thermal sensitivity window of 375-550Â°C. This unique temperature window recorded by the apatite U-Pb system, and the near-ubiquitous presence of apatite in igneous and clastic sedimentary rocks makes it a powerful tool able to illuminate mid-crustal tectono-thermal processes. However, as apatite incorporates only modest amounts of U and Th (1-10s of ppm) the significant amounts of non-radiogenic \"common\" Pb incorporated during its formation presents a major hurdle for apatite U-Pb dating. In bedrock samples common Pb in apatite can be corrected for by the measurement of Pb in a cogenetic mineral phase, such as feldspar, that does not incorporate U or from determination of a common Pb composition from multiple analyses in Tera-Wasserburg space. While these methods for common Pb correction in apatite can work for igneous samples, they cannot be applied to detrital apatite in sedimentary rocks with variable common Pb compositions. The obstacle of common Pb in apatite has hindered the application of detrital apatite U-Pb dating in provenance studies, despite the fact that it would be a powerful tool. This study presents a new method for the in situ correction of common Pb in apatite through the utilization of novel LA-ICP-MS depth profiling, which can recover U-Pb ratios at micron-scale spatial resolution during ablation of a grain. Due to the intra-grain U variability in apatite, a mixing line for a single grain can be generated in Tera-Wasserburg Concordia space. As a case study, apatite from a Variscan alpine granite were analyzed using both the single and multi-grain method, with both methods giving identical results. As a second case study the intra-grain method was then performed\n\nHigh spatial resolution U-Pb geochronology and Pb isotope geochemistry of magnetite-apatite ore from the Pea Ridge iron oxide-apatite deposit, St. Francois Mountains, southeast Missouri, USA\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nNeymark, Leonid; Holm-Denoma, Christopher S.; Pietruszka, Aaron; Aleinikoff, John N.; Fanning, C. Mark; Pillers, Renee M.; Moscati, Richard J.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThe Pea Ridge iron oxide-apatite (IOA) deposit is one of the major rhyolite-hosted magnetite deposits of the St. Francois Mountains terrane, which is located within the Mesoproterozoic (1.5â1.3 Ga) Granite-Rhyolite province in the U.S. Midcontinent. Precise and accurate determination of the timing and duration of oreforming processes in this deposit is crucial for understanding its origin and placing it within a deposit-scale and regional geologic context. Apatite and monazite, well-established U-Pb mineral geochronometers, are abundant in the Pea Ridge orebody. However, the potential presence of multiple generations of dateable minerals, processes of dissolution-reprecipitation, and occurrence of micrometer-sized intergrowths and inclusions complicate measurements and interpretations of the geochronological results. Here, we employ a combination of several techniques, including ID-TIMS and high spatial resolution geochronology of apatite and monazite using LA-SC-ICPMS and SHRIMP, and Pb isotope geochemistry of pyrite and magnetite to obtain the first direct age constraints on the formation and alteration history of the Pea Ridge IOA deposit. The oldest apatite TIMSÂ 207Pb*/206Pb* dates are 1471 Â± 1 and 1468 Â± 1 Ma, slightly younger than (but within error of) the ~1474 to ~1473 Ma U-Pb zircon ages of the host rhyolites. Dating of apatite and monazite inclusions within apatite provides evidence for at least one younger metasomatic event at ~1.44 Ga, and possibly multiple superimposed metasomatic events between 1.47 and 1.44 Ga. Lead isotop analyses of pyrite show extremely radiogenicÂ 206Pb/204Pb ratios up to ~80 unsupported by in situ U decay. This excess radiogenic Pb in pyrite may have been derived from the spatially associated apatite as apatite recrystallized several tens of million years after its formation. The low initialÂ 206Pb/204Pb ratio of ~16.5 andÂ 207Pb/204Pb ratio of ~15.4 for individual magnetite grains indicate closed U-Pb system behavior in\n\nLaser Ablation in situ (U-Th-Sm)/He and U-Pb Double-Dating of Apatite and Zircon: Techniques and Applications\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMcInnes, B.; DaniÅ¡Ã­k, M.; Evans, N.; McDonald, B.; Becker, T.; Vermeesch, P.\n\n2015-12-01\n\nWe present a new laser-based technique for rapid, quantitative and automated in situ microanalysis of U, Th, Sm, Pb and He for applications in geochronology, thermochronometry and geochemistry (Evans et al., 2015). This novel capability permits a detailed interrogation of the time-temperature history of rocks containing apatite, zircon and other accessory phases by providing both (U-Th-Sm)/He and U-Pb ages (+trace element analysis) on single crystals. In situ laser microanalysis offers several advantages over conventional bulk crystal methods in terms of safety, cost, productivity and spatial resolution. We developed and integrated a suite of analytical instruments including a 193 nm ArF excimer laser system (RESOlution M-50A-LR), a quadrupole ICP-MS (Agilent 7700s), an Alphachron helium mass spectrometry system and swappable flow-through and ultra-high vacuum analytical chambers. The analytical protocols include the following steps: mounting/polishing in PFA Teflon using methods similar to those adopted for fission track etching; laser He extraction and analysis using a 2 s ablation at 5 Hz and 2-3 J/cm2fluence; He pit volume measurement using atomic force microscopy, and U-Th-Sm-Pb (plus optional trace element) analysis using traditional laser ablation methods. The major analytical challenges for apatite include the low U, Th and He contents relative to zircon and the elevated common Pb content. On the other hand, apatite typically has less extreme and less complex zoning of parent isotopes (primarily U and Th). A freeware application has been developed for determining (U-Th-Sm)/He ages from the raw analytical data and Iolite software was used for U-Pb age and trace element determination. In situ double-dating has successfully replicated conventional U-Pb and (U-Th)/He age variations in xenocrystic zircon from the diamondiferous Ellendale lamproite pipe, Western Australia and increased zircon analytical throughput by a factor of 50 over conventional methods\n\nAir abrasion experiments in U-Pb dating of zircon\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nGoldich, S.S.; Fischer, L.B.\n\n1986-01-01\n\nAir abrasion of zircon grains can remove metamict material that has lost radiogenic Pb and zircon overgrowths that were added during younger events and thereby improve the precision of the age measurements and permit closer estimates of the original age. Age discordance that resulted from a single disturbance of the U-Pb isotopic decay systems, as had been demonstrated by T.E. Krogh, can be considerably reduced, and, under favorable conditions, the ages brought into concordancy. Two or more events complicate the U-Pb systematics, but a series of abrasion experiments can be helpful in deciphering the geologic history and in arriving at a useful interpretation of the probable times of origin and disturbances. In east-central Minnesota, U.S.A., Penokean tonalite gneiss is dated at 1869 ?? 5 Ma, and sheared granite gneiss is shown to have been a high-level granite intrusion at 1982 ?? 5 Ma in the McGrath Gneiss precursor. Tonalite gneiss and a mafic granodiorite in the Rainy Lake area, Ontario, Canada, are dated at 2736 ?? 16 and 2682 ?? 4 Ma, respectively. The tonalitic phase of the Morton Gneiss, southwestern Minnesota, is dated at 3662 ?? 42 Ma. ?? 1986.\n\nU-Pb Dating of Zircons and Phosphates in Lunar Meteorites, Acapulcoites and Angrites\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nZhou, Q.; Zeigler, R. A.; Yin, Q. Z.; Korotev, R. L.; Joliff, B. L.; Amelin, Y.; Marti, K.; Wu, F. Y.; Li, X. H.; Li, Q. L.;\n\n2012-01-01\n\nZircon U-Pb geochronology has made a great contribution to the timing of magmatism in the early Solar System [1-3]. Ca phosphates are another group of common accessory minerals in meteorites with great potential for U-Pb geochronology. Compared to zircons, the lower closure temperatures of the U-Pb system for apatite and merrillite (the most common phosphates in achondrites) makes them susceptible to resetting during thermal metamorphism. The different closure temperatures of the U-Pb system for zircon and apatite provide us an opportunity to discover the evolutionary history of meteoritic parent bodies, such as the crystallization ages of magmatism, as well as later impact events and thermal metamorphism. We have developed techniques using the Cameca IMS-1280 ion microprobe to date both zircon and phosphate grains in meteorites. Here we report U-Pb dating results for zircons and phosphates from lunar meteorites Dhofar 1442 and SaU 169. To test and verify the reliability of the newly developed phosphate dating technique, two additional meteorites, Acapulco, obtained from Acapulco consortium, and angrite NWA 4590 were also selected for this study as both have precisely known phosphate U-Pb ages by TIMS [4,5]. Both meteorites are from very fast cooled parent bodies with no sign of resetting [4,5], satisfying a necessity for precise dating.\n\nCombined apatite fission track and U-Pb dating by LA-ICPMS\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nChew, D. M.; Donelick, R. A.\n\n2012-04-01\n\nApatite is a common accessory mineral in igneous, metamorphic and clastic sedimentary rocks. It is a nearly ubiquitous accessory phase in igneous rocks, is common in metamorphic rocks of pelitic, carbonate, basaltic, and ultramafic composition and is virtually ubiquitous in clastic sedimentary rocks. In contrast to the polycyclic behavior of the stable heavy mineral zircon, apatite is unstable in acidic groundwaters and has limited mechanical stability in sedimentary transport systems. Apatite has many potential applications in provenance studies, particularly as it likely represents first-cycle detritus. Fission track and U-Pb dating are very powerful techniques in apatite provenance studies. They yield complementary information, with the apatite fission-track system yielding low-temperature exhumation ages and the U-Pb system yielding high-temperature cooling ages which constrain the timing of apatite crystallization. This study focuses on integrating apatite fission track and U-Pb dating by the LA-ICPMS method. Our approach is intentionally broad in scope, and is applicable to any quadrupole or rapid-scanning magnetic-sector LA-ICPMS system. Calculating uranium concentrations in fission-track dating by LA-ICPMS increases the speed of analysis and sample throughput compared to the conventional external detector method and avoids the need for neutron irradiation (Hasebe et al., 2004). LA-ICPMS-based uranium measurements in apatite are measured relative to an internal concentration standard (typically 43Ca). Ca in apatite is not always stochiometric as minor cations (Mn2+, Sr2+, Ba2+ and Fe2+) and REE can substitute with Ca2+. These substitutions must be quantified by multi-elemental LA-ICPMS analyses. Such data are also useful for discriminating between different apatite populations in sedimentary or volcaniclastic rocks based on their trace-element chemistry. Low U, Th and radiogenic Pb concentrations, elevated common Pb / radiogenic Pb ratios and U-Pb elemental\n\nFinding the \"true\" age: ways to read high-precision U-Pb zircon dates\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSchaltegger, U.; Schoene, B.; Ovtcharova, M.; Sell, B. K.; Broderick, C. A.; Wotzlaw, J.\n\n2011-12-01\n\nRefined U-Pb dating techniques, applying an empirical chemical abrasion treatment prior to analysis [1], and using a precisely calibrated double isotope Pb, U EARTHTIME tracer solution, have led to an unprecedented <0.1% precision and accuracy of obtained 206Pb/238U dates of single zircon crystals or fragments. Results very often range over 10e4 to 10e6 years and cannot be treated as statistically singular age populations. The interpretation of precise zircon U-Pb ages is biased by two problems: (A) Post-crystallization Pb loss from decay damaged areas is considered to be mitigated by applying chemical abrasion techniques. The success of such treatment can, however, not be assumed a priori. The following examples demonstrate that youngest zircons are not biased by lead loss but represent close-to-youngest zircon growth: (i) coincidence of youngest zircon dates with co-magmatic titanite in tonalite; (ii) coincidence with statistically equivalent clusters of 206Pb/238U dates from zircon in residual melts of cogenetic mafic magmas; (iii) youngest zircons in ash beds of sedimentary sequences do not violate the stratigraphic superposition, whereas conventional statistical interpretation (mean or median values) does; (iv) results of published inter-laboratory cross-calibration tests using chemical abrasion on natural zircon crystals of the same sample arrive at the same 206Pb/238U result within <0.1% (e.g., [2]); (v) Youngest crystals coincide in age with the astronomical age of hosting cyclic sediments. Residual lead loss may, however, still be identified in the case of single, significantly younger dates (>3 sigma), and are common in many pre-Triassic and hydrothermally altered rocks. (B) Pre-eruptive/pre-intrusive growth is found to be the main reason for scattered zircon ages in igneous rocks. Zircons crystallizing from the final magma batch are called autocrystic [3]. Autocrystic growth will happen in a moving or stagnant magma shortly before or after the\n\nConventional U-Pb dating versus SHRIMP of the Santa Barbara Granite Massif, Rondonia, Brazil\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nSparrenberger, I.; Bettencourt, Jorge S.; Tosdal, R.M.; Wooden, J.L.\n\n2002-01-01\n\nThe Santa Ba??rbara Granite Massif is part of the Younger Granites of Rondo??nia (998 - 974 Ma) and is included in the Rondo??nia Tin Province (SW Amazonian Craton). It comprises three highly fractionated metaluminous to peraluminous within-plate A-type granite units emplaced in older medium-grade metamorphic rocks. Sn-mineralization is closely associated with the late-stage unit. U-Pb monazite conventional dating of the early-stage Serra do Cicero facies and late-stage Serra Azul facies yielded ages of 993 ?? 5 Ma and 989 ?? 13 Ma, respectively. Conventional multigrain U-Pb isotope analyses of zircon demonstrate isotopic disturbance (discordance) and the preservation of inherited older zircons of several different ages and thus yield little about the ages of Sn-granite magmatism. SHRIMP U-Pb ages for the Santa Ba??rbara facies association yielded a 207Pb/206Pb weighted-mean age of 978 ?? 13 Ma. The textural complexity of the zircon crystals of the Santa Ba??rbara facies association, the variable concentrations of U, Th and Pb, as well as the mixed inheritance of zircon populations are major obstacles to using conventional multigrain U-Pb isotopic analyses. Sm-Nd model ages and ??Nd (T) values reveal anomalous isotopic data, attesting to the complex isotopic behaviour within these highly fractionated granites. Thus, SHRIMP U-Pb zircon and conventional U-Pb monazite dating methods are the most appropriate to constrain the crystallization age of the Sn-bearing granite systems in the Rondo??nia Tin Province.\n\nApatite U-Pb thermochronolgy applied to complex geological settings - insights from geo/thermochronology and geochemistry\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPaul, Andre; Spikings, Richard; Ulyanov, Alexey; Chew, David\n\n2016-04-01\n\nApplication of high temperature (>350oC) thermochronology is limited to the U-Pb system of accessory minerals, such as apatite, under the assumption that radiogenic lead is lost to thermally activated volume diffusion into an infinite reservoir. Cochrane et al. (2015) have demonstrated a working example from the northern Andes of South America. Predictions from volume diffusion theory were compared with measured single grain U-Pb date correlated to shortest diffusion radius and in-situ profiles measured by LA-ICP-MS. Results from both techniques were found to be in agreement with predictions from thermally activated, volume diffusion. However, outliers from the ID-TIMS data suggested some complexity, as grains were found to be too young relative to their diffusion radius. Interaction of multiple processes can be responsible for the alteration of apatite U-Pb dates such as: (1) metamorphic (over)growth, (2) fluid aided alteration/recrystallization and (3) metamictization and fracturing of the grain. Further, predictions from volume diffusion rely on the input parameters: (a) diffusivity, (b) activation energy and (c) shortest diffusion radius. Diffusivity and activation energy are potentially influenced by the chemical composition and subsequent changes in crystal structure. Currently there is one value for diffusion parameter and activation energy established for (Durango) apatite (Cherniak et al., 1991). Correlation between diffusivity/activation energy and composition has not been established. We investigate if correlations exist between diffusivity/activation energy and composition by obtaining single grain apatite U-Pb date and chemical compostion and correlating these to their diffusion radius. We test the consistency of apatite closure temperature, by comparing the apatite U-Pb dates with lower temperature thermochronometers such as white mica and K-feldspar Ar/Ar and by petrographic observations. We test if chemical information can be a proxy to identify\n\nChemical abrasion-SIMS (CA-SIMS) U-Pb dating of zircon from the late Eocene Caetano caldera, Nevada\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nWatts, Kathryn E.; Coble, Matthew A.; Vazquez, Jorge A.; Henry, Christopher D.; Colgan, Joseph P.; John, David A.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nZircon geochronology is a critical tool for establishing geologic ages and time scales of processes in the Earth's crust. However, for zircons compromised by open system behavior, achieving robust dates can be difficult. Chemical abrasion (CA) is a routine step prior to thermal ionization mass spectrometry (TIMS) dating of zircon to remove radiation-damaged parts of grains that may have experienced open system behavior and loss of radiogenic Pb. While this technique has been shown to improve the accuracy and precision of TIMS dating, its application to high-spatial resolution dating methods, such as secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), is relatively uncommon. In our efforts to U-Pb date zircons from the late Eocene Caetano caldera by SIMS (SHRIMP-RG: sensitive high resolution ion microprobe, reverse geometry), some grains yielded anomalously young U-Pb ages that implicated Pb-loss and motivated us to investigate with a comparative CA and non-CA dating study. We present CA and non-CAÂ 206Pb/238U ages and trace elements determined by SHRIMP-RG for zircons from three Caetano samples (Caetano Tuff, Redrock Canyon porphyry, and a silicic ring-fracture intrusion) and for R33 and TEMORA-2 reference zircons. We find that non-CA Caetano zircons have weighted mean or bimodal U-Pb ages that are 2â4% younger than CA zircons for the same samples. CA Caetano zircons have mean U-Pb ages that are 0.4â0.6Â Myr older than theÂ 40Ar/39Ar sanidine eruption age (34.00Â Â±Â 0.03Â Ma; error-weighted mean, 2Ï), whereas non-CA zircons have ages that are 0.7â1.3Â Myr younger. U-Pb ages do not correlate with U (~Â 100â800Â ppm), Th (~Â 50â300Â ppm) or any other measured zircon trace elements (Y, Hf, REE), and CA and non-CA Caetano zircons define identical trace element ranges. No statistically significant difference in U-Pb age is observed for CA versus non-CA R33 or TEMORA-2 zircons. Optical profiler measurements of ion microprobe pits demonstrate consistent depths of ~Â 1.6Â\n\nIntegrated Laser Ablation U/Pb and (U-Th)/He Dating of Detrital Accessory Minerals from the Naryani River, Central Nepal\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHorne, A.; Hodges, K. V.; Van Soest, M. C.\n\n2015-12-01\n\nThe newly developed 'laser ablation double dating' (LADD) technique, an integrated laser microprobe U/Pb and (U-Th)/He dating method, could be an exceptionally valuable tool in detrital thermochronology for identifying sedimentary provenance and evaluating the exhumation history of a source region. A recent proof-of-concept study has used LADD to successfully date both zircon and titanite crystals from the well-characterized Fish Canyon tuff, but we also believe that another accessory mineral, rutile, could be amenable to dating via the LADD technique. To continue the development of the method, we present an application of LADD to detrital zircon, titanite, and rutile from a sample collected on the lower Naryani River of central Nepal. Preliminary analyses of the sample have yielded zircon U/Pb dates ranging from 31.4 to 2405 Ma; zircon (U-Th)/He from 1.8 to 15.4 Ma; titanite U/Pb between 18 and 110 Ma; titanite (U-Th)/He between 1 and 16 Ma; rutile U/Pb from 6 to 45 Ma; and rutile (U-Th)/He from 2 to 25 Ma. In addition to the initial data, we can use Ti-in-zircon, Zr-in-titanite, and Zr-in-rutile thermometers to determine the range of possible long-term cooling rates from grains with U/Pb ages younger than collision. Thus far our results from zircon analyses imply a cooling rate of approximately 15Â°C/Myr; titanite analyses imply between 10 and 67Â°C/Myr; and rutile between 9 and 267Â°C/Myr. This spread in potential cooling rates, especially in the order of magnitude differences of cooling rates calculated from the rutile grains, suggests that the hinterland source regions of the Naryani river experienced dramatically different exhumation histories during Himalayan orogenisis. Ongoing analyses will expand the dataset such that we can more adequately characterize the range of possibilities represented in the sample.\n\nGeochemistry, zircon U-Pb dating and Hf isotopies composition of Paleozoic granitoids in Jinchuan, NW China: Constraints on their petrogenesis, source characteristics and tectonic implication\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZeng, Renyu; Lai, Jianqing; Mao, Xiancheng; Li, Bin; Ju, Peijiao; Tao, Shilong\n\n2016-05-01\n\nGranitoids are widely distributed in Jinchuan at the southwestern margin of the North China plate, which is also an important area of mineral deposits. The research subject of this article are two Paleozoic granitoids, a cataclastic syenogranite and a granodiorite porphyry. This study presents whole rock geochemistry and zircon U-Pb-Hf isotope data for the two granitoids to determine their petrogenesis, source characteristics and tectonic significance. The cataclastic syenogranite is characterized by metaluminous composition with high potassium, and LaN/YbN from 39 to 48. The composition with strong negative Eu anomalies and Zircon saturation temperatures (TZr) from 947 to 1072 Â°C classify this intrusion as an A-type granite. The granodiorite porphyry is metaluminous with high sodium, sub-alkaline, LaN/YbN ratios from 27 to 32. These I-type intrusions have no Eu anomalies and TZr ranges from 818 to 845 Â°C. Both the cataclastic syenogranite and granodiorite porphyry show enrichment of LREE and LILE and depletion of HREE and HFSE, except Hf and Zr. Using single zircon LA-ICP-MS U-Pb dating, the emplacement age of the cataclastic syenogranite and granodiorite porphyry are determined at 433.4 Â± 3.7 Ma and 361.7 Â± 4.6 Ma, respectively. Zircons from the cataclastic syenogranits have uniform negative ÎµHf(t) values (-11 Â± 0.5 to -9 Â± 0.5), implying the involvement of an old Palaeoproterozoic crustal source in magma genesis. The zircons from the granodiorite porphyry have ÎµHf(t) values that range from -8 Â± 1.0 to +10 Â± 0.6, suggesting heterogeneous source materials involving both juvenile and ancient crust reworked crustal components. Based on the geological significance of granites at the southwestern margin of the North China plate, the closure of the North Qilian Ocean occurred at â¼444 Ma. Geochemical features suggest that the cataclastic syenogranite and granodiorite porphyry formed in an intraplate extensional and compressional setting, respectively.

They are guide fossils to show formation ages of sedimentary sequences with the highest resolution [1] and good samples to verify the dating method. We developed the ion microprobe U-Pb dating of apatite [2] and applied the method to a Carboniferous conodont [3] by using a SHRIMP II installed at Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, Hiroshima University. Recently we have developed the NanoSIMS U-Pb dating method and successfully measured the formation ages of monazite [4] and zircon [5] at Atmosphere and Ocean Research Institute, University of Tokyo. In this work we carried out the NanoSIMS U-Pb dating of biogenic apatite such as conodont. Since the spot size of NanoSIMS is smaller than SHRIMP II, it is easier to have multi-spots on the single fragment of biogenic apatite. Based on the isochron method of U-Pb system, we have calculated the formation ages. They are consistent with those in literature. In order to study the chemical evolution of ocean during the past 600 Million years, strontium isotopes (87Sr/86Sr) of fossil marine carbonate such as coral skeletons and foraminifera tests were measured and compiled [6]. However they are not robust when the age is older than 500Ma, partly due to post-depositional histories. Apatite is more stable and more resistant to the alteration than carbonate [7]. Recently we have developed the method of NanoSIMS strontium isotopic analysis of a fish otolith, which composed of aragonite [8]. In this work we carried out the strontium isotopic analysis of biogenic apatite. The advantage of the ion microprobe technique over the TIMS (thermal ionization mass spectrometer) and MC-ICP-MS (multi-collector inductively coupled argon plasma mass spectrometer) method is preservation of the important textural context and to provide an opportunity for other simultaneous analytical work with high spatial resolution. This is the case for\n\nZircon U-Pb geochronology and geochemistry of granites in the Zhuguangshan complex, South China: Implications for uranium mineralization\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZhang, Long; Chen, Zhenyu; Li, Xiaofeng; Li, Shengrong; Santosh, M.; Huang, Guolong\n\n2018-05-01\n\nThe Zhuguangshan complex, composed of Caledonian, Indosinian, and Yanshanian granites, and Cretaceous mafic dykes, is one of the most important granite-hosted uranium producers in South China. Here we present LA-ICP-MS zircon U-Pb and hornblende 40Ar/39Ar geochronology and whole-rock and biotite geochemistry for the granites in this complex to evaluate the magmatism and its constraints on uranium mineralization. Samples collected from the Fuxi, Youdong, Longhuashan, Chikeng, Qiling, and Sanjiangkou intrusions yield zircon weighted 206Pb/238U ages of 426.7 Â± 5.4 Ma, 226.4 Â± 3.5 Ma, 225.0 Â± 2.7 Ma, 152.2 Â± 3.0 Ma, 153.9 Â± 2.1 Ma, and 155.2 Â± 2.1 Ma, respectively. A new Ar-Ar dating of the hornblende of the diabase from the Changjiang uranium ore field yields a plateau age of 145.1 Â± 1.5 Ma. These results coupled with published geochronological data indicate that six major magmatic events occurred in the study area at 420-435 Ma, 225-240 Ma, 150-165 Ma, 140 Ma, 105 Ma, and 90 Ma. Both U-bearing and barren granites occur in this complex, and they display differences in whole-rock and biotite geochemistry. The barren granites show higher Al2O3, CaO, TFMM, Rb, Zr, Ba, SI, Mg#, (La/Yb)N, and Eu/Eu*, but lower SiO2, ALK, Rb, DI, Rb/Sr, and TiO2/MgO than those of the U-bearing granites. Biotites in the U-bearing granites are close to the Fe-rich siderophyllite-annite end member with Fe/(Fe + Mg) ratios higher than 0.66, whereas those in the barren granites are relatively close to the Mg-rich eastonite-phlogopite end member with Fe/(Fe + Mg) ratios <0.66. The U-bearing granites were mainly derived from the partial melting of pelitic sedimentary source, whereas the psammitic source generated the barren granites. In addition, the barren granites show higher TFMM, Ba, and Eu/Eu* but lower SiO2, Rb/Sr and Al2O3/TiO2 ratios with higher zircon saturation temperatures relative to the U-bearing granites. These results indicate that the geochemical compositions of the U\n\nReply to Comment on \"Zircon U-Th-Pb dating using LA-ICP-MS: Simultaneous U-Pb and U-Th dating on the 0.1 Ma Toya Tephra, Japan\"\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nIto, Hisatoshi\n\n2015-04-01\n\nGuillong et al. (2015) mentioned that corrections for abundance sensitivity for 232Th and molecular zirconium sesquioxide ions (Zr2O3+) are critical for reliable determination of 230Th abundances in zircon for LA-ICP-MS analyses. There is no denying that more rigorous treatments are necessary to obtain more reliable ages than those in Ito (2014). However, as shown in Fig. 2 in Guillong et al. (2015), the uncorrected (230Th)/(238U) for reference zircons except for Mud Tank are only 5-20% higher than unity. Since U abundance of Toya Tephra zircons that have U-Pb ages < 1 Ma is in-between that of FCT and Plesovice, the overestimation of 230Th by both abundance sensitivity and molecular interferences is expected to be 5-20% for the Toya Tephra. Moreover Ito (2014) obtained U-Th ages of the Toya Tephra by comparison with Fish Canyon Tuff (FCT) data. Because both the FCT and the Toya Tephra have similar trends of overestimation of 230Th, the effect of overestimation of 230Th to cause overestimation of U-Th age should be cancelled out or negligible. Therefore the pivotal conclusion in Ito (2014) that simultaneous U-Pb and U-Th dating using LA-ICP-MS is possible and useful for Quaternary zircons holds true.\n\nMagmatic Longevity Constrained by ID-TIMS U-Pb Dating of Zircon and Titanite\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSzymanowski, D.; Wotzlaw, J. F.; Ellis, B. S.; Bachmann, O.; Von Quadt, A.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nClues about the timescales and thermal conditions associated with the growth and evacuation of large silicic magma reservoirs are frequently drawn from radiometric dating, diffusion modelling, or thermomechanical modelling. A growing amount of petrological and geochronological evidence, supported by thermal modelling, suggests that many silicic magma reservoirs may exist for some 104-106 years in the form of high-crystallinity mushes at relatively low temperatures ( 700-750Â°C; [1-3]). Geochronological studies addressing this issue typically utilise the U-Pb system in zircon capable of recording extended periods of crystallisation, particularly in evolved calc-alkaline systems that spend most of their lifetime zircon-saturated. In this study, we integrate U-Pb dating of zircon and titanite to investigate the longevity of the magma reservoir that produced the Kneeling Nun Tuff, a 35 Ma, >900 km3 crystal-rich rhyolitic super-eruption from the Mogollon-Datil volcanic field in New Mexico (USA). High-precision ID-TIMS U-Pb dates of single crystals of both zircon and titanite independently record a continuous crystallisation history over >400,000 years. We combine the dating of both accessory phases with textural, major, trace element and isotopic studies of single crystals, placing tight constraints on the thermal conditions of magma accumulation and storage while recording differentiation and rejuvenation processes within the magma reservoir. The results suggest a protracted `cool' upper-crustal storage of magma prior to the Kneeling Nun Tuff eruption followed by a melting event which reduced the magma crystallinity and conditioned it for eruption.

(2011) claim to provide the first successful direct dating of fossil bones and to establish the presence of Paleocene dinosaurs. Fassett et al. ignore previously published work that directly questions their stratigraphic interpretations (Lucas et al., 2009), and fail to provide sufficient descriptions of instrumental, geochronological, and statistical treatments of the data to allow evaluation of the potentially complex diagenetic and recrystallization history of bone. These shortcomings lead us to question the validity of the U-Pb dates published by Fassett et al. and their conclusions regarding the existence of Paleocene dinosaurs.\n\nConnecting the U-Th and U-Pb Chronometers: New Algorithms and Applications\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMcLean, N. M.; Smith, C. J. M.; Roberts, N. M. W.; Richards, D. A.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nThe U-Th and U-Pb geochronometers are important clocks for separate intervals of the geologic timescale. U-Th dates exploit disequilibrium in the 238U intermediate daughter isotopes 234U and 230Th, and are often used to date corals and speleothems that are zero age through 800 ka. The U-Pb system relies on secular equilibrium decay of 238U to 206Pb and 235U to 207Pb over longer timescales, and can be used to date samples from <1 Ma to 4.5 Ga. Disequilibrium plays a role in young U-Pb dates, but only as a nuisance correction. Both chronometers can produce dates with uncertainties <0.1% near the center of their applicable age ranges, but become less precise at their intersection, when the 238U decay chain approaches secular equilibrium and there has been little time for ingrowth of radiogenic Pb. However, if measurements or assumptions about both chronometers can be made, then they can be combined into a single, more informed date. Coupling the datasets can improve their precision and accuracy and help interrogate the assumptions that underpin each. Working with this data is difficult for two reasons. The Bateman equations are long and cumbersome for U decay chains that include 238U, 234U, 230Th, 226Ra, 206Pb and 235U, 231Pa, and 207Pb. Also, Pb measurements often comprise varying amounts of radiogenic Pb from locally heterogeneous U concentrations mixed with varying amounts of common Pb. At present there is no established, flexible computational framework to combine information from measurements and/or assumptions of these parameters, and no way to visualize and interpret the results. We present new algorithms to quickly and accurately solve the system of differential equations defined by both of the uranium decay chains and the linear regression through the U-Pb isochron. The results are illustrated on a new concordia diagram, where the concordia curve is determined by measured and/or assumed U-series disequilibrium and can have unfamiliar topologies. We\n\nNatural radionuclide mobility and its influence on U-Th-Pb dating of secondary minerals from the unsaturated zone at Yucca Mountain, Nevada\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nNeymark, L.A.; Amelin, Y.V.\n\n2008-01-01\n\nExtreme U and Pb isotope variations produced by disequilibrium in decay chains of 238U and 232Th are found in calcite, opal/chalcedony, and Mn-oxides occurring as secondary mineral coatings in the unsaturated zone at Yucca Mountain, Nevada. These very slowly growing minerals (mm my-1) contain excess 206Pb and 208Pb formed from excesses of intermediate daughter isotopes and cannot be used as reliable 206Pb/238U geochronometers. The presence of excess intermediate daughter isotopes does not appreciably affect 207Pb/235U ages of U-enriched opal/chalcedony, which are interpreted as mineral formation ages. Opal and calcite from outer (younger) portions of coatings have 230Th/U ages from 94.6 ?? 3.7 to 361.3 ?? 9.8 ka and initial 234U/238U activity ratios (AR) from 4.351 ?? 0.070 to 7.02 ?? 0.12, which indicate 234U enrichment from percolating water. Present-day 234U/238U AR is ???1 in opal/chalcedony from older portions of the coatings. The 207Pb/235U ages of opal/chalcedony samples range from 0.1329 ?? 0.0080 to 9.10 ?? 0.21 Ma, increase with microstratigraphic depth, and define slow long-term average growth rates of about 1.2-2.0 mm my-1, in good agreement with previous results. Measured 234U/238U AR in Mn-oxides, which pre-date the oldest calcite and opal/chalcedony, range from 0.939 ?? 0.006 to 2.091 ?? 0.006 and are >1 in most samples. The range of 87Sr/86Sr ratios (0.71156-0.71280) in Mn-oxides overlaps that in the late calcite. These data indicate that Mn-oxides exchange U and Sr with percolating water and cannot be used as a reliable dating tool. In the U-poor calcite samples, measured 206Pb/207Pb ratios have a wide range, do not correlate with Ba concentration as would be expected if excess Ra was present, and reach a value of about 1400, the highest ever reported for natural Pb. Calcite intergrown with opal contains excesses of both 206Pb and 207Pb derived from Rn diffusion and from direct ??-recoil from U-rich opal.

Stephen; Ulyanov, Alexey\n\n2017-04-01\n\nHigh temperature (>350â) U-Pb thermochronometers primarily use accessory minerals such as apatite, titanite and rutile, and assume that daughter isotopes are lost by thermally activated volume diffusion while the parent remains immobile. Studies exploiting such behaviour have been successfully used to reconstruct thermal histories spanning several hundred million years (e.g. Cochrane et al., 2014). However, outliers in date (ID-TIMS) vs diffusion length space are frequently observed, and grains are frequently found to be either too young or too old for expected thermal history solutions using the diffusion data of Cherniak et al. (2010). These deviations of single grain apatite U-Pb dates from expected behaviour could be caused by a combination of i) metamorphic (over-)growth, ii) fluid-aided Pb mobilisation during alteration/recrystallization, iii) parent isotope zonation, iv) metamictisation, and v) changes in diffusion length with time (e.g. fracturing). We present a large data set from the northern Andes of South America, where we compare apatite U-Pb ID-TIMS-(TEA) data with LA-ICP-MS element maps and in-situ apatite U-Pb LA-(MC)-ICP-MS dates. These are combined with U-Pb zircon and 40Ar/39Ar (muscovite) data to attempt to distinguish between thermally activated volume diffusion and secondary overgrowth/recrystallization. We demonstrate that in young (e.g. Phanerozoic) apatites that have not recrystallized or experienced metasomatic overgrowths, U-Pb dates are dominantly controlled by volume diffusion and intra-crystal uranium zonation. This implies that ID-TIMS analyses of apatites with zoned parent isotope distributions will not usually recover accurate thermal history solutions, and an in-situ dating method is required. Recovering the uranium distribution during in-situ analysis provides a means to account for parent zonation, substantially increasing the accuracy of the modelled t-T-paths. We present in-situ data from apatites where scatter in date v\n\nProspects for Practical Laser Ablation U/Pb and (U-Th)/He Double-Dating (LADD) of Detrital Apatite\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHorne, A.; Hodges, K. V.; Van Soest, M. C.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nA laser ablation micro-analytical technique for (U-Th)/He dating has been shown to be an effective approach to the thermochronologic study of detrital zircons (Tripathy-Lang et al., J. Geophys. Res., 2013), while Evans et al. (J. Anal. At. Spectrom., 2015) and Horne et al. (Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta, 2016) demonstrated how the technique could be modified to enable laser ablation U/Pb and (U-Th)/He double-dating (LADD) of detrital zircon and titanite. These successes beg the question of whether or not LADD is viable for another commonly encountered detrital mineral: apatite. Exploratory LADD studies in Arizona State University's Group 18 Laboratories - using Durango fluorapatite, apatite from the Fish Canyon tuff, and detrital apatite from modern fluvial sediments in the eastern Sierra Nevada of California - illustrate that the method is indeed viable for detrital apatite. However, the method may not be appropriate for all detrital samples. For example, many apatite grains encountered in detrital samples from young orogenic settings have low concentrations of U and Th and small crystal sizes. This can lead to imprecise laser ablation (U-Th)/He dates, especially for very young grains potentially obscuring or inhibiting relevant interpretations of the data set.\n\nAdvantages of conducting in-situ U-Pb age dating of multiple U-bearing minerals from a single complex: Case in point - the Oka Carbonatite Complex\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nChen, W.; Simonetti, A.\n\n2012-12-01\n\nA detailed radiometric investigation is currently underway focusing on U-bearing accessory minerals apatite, perovskite, and niocalite from the Oka Carbonatite Complex (Canada). One of the main objectives is to obtain a comparative chronology of melt crystallization for the complex. Unlike other commonly adopted U-bearing minerals (e.g., zircon, monazite) for in-situ dating investigations, apatite, perovskite, and niocalite contain relatively high contents of common Pb. Hence, careful assessment of the proportion and composition of the common Pb, and usage of appropriate matrix-matched external standards are imperative. The Madagascar apatite was utilized as the external standard for apatite dating, and the Emerald Lake and Durango apatites were adopted as secondary standards; the latter yield ages of 92.6 Â±1.8 and 32.2 Â±1.1 Ma, respectively, and these are identical to their accepted ages. Pb/U ages for apatite from Oka were obtained for different rock types, including 8 carbonatites, 4 okaites, 3 ijolites and 3 alnoites, and these define a range of ages between ~105 and ~135 Ma; this result suggests a protracted crystallization history. In total, 266 individual analyses define two peaks at ~115 and ~125Ma. For perovskite dating, the Ice River perovskite standard was utilized as the external standard. The perovskites from one okaite sample yield an age of 112.2 Â±1.9 Ma, and is much younger than the previously reported U-Pb perovskite age of 131 Â±7 Ma. Hence, the combined U-Pb perovskite ages also suggest a rather prolonged time of melt crystallization. Niocalite is a rare, accessory silicate mineral that occurs within the carbonatites at Oka. The international zircon standard BR266 was selected for use as the external standard and rastering was employed to minimize the Pb-U fractionation. Two niocalite samples give young ages at 110.6 Â±1.2 and 115.0 Â±1.9 Ma, and are identical to their respective apatite ages (given associated uncertainties) from the same\n\nEnhanced provenance interpretation using combined U-Pb and (U-Th)/He double dating of detrital zircon grains from lower Miocene strata, proximal Gulf of Mexico Basin, North America\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nXu, Jie; Stockli, Daniel F.; Snedden, John W.\n\n2017-10-01\n\nDetrital zircon U-Pb analysis is an effective approach for investigating sediment provenance by relating crystallization age to potential crystalline source terranes. Studies of large passive margin basins, such as the Gulf of Mexico Basin, that have received sediment from multiple terranes with non-unique crystallization ages or sedimentary strata, benefit from additional constraints to better elucidate provenance interpretation. In this study, U-Pb and (U-Th)/He double dating analyses on single zircons from the lower Miocene sandstones in the northern Gulf of Mexico Basin reveal a detailed history of sediment source evolution. U-Pb age data indicate that most zircon originated from five major crystalline provinces, including the Western Cordillera Arc (<250 Ma), the Appalachian-Ouachita orogen (500-260 Ma), the Grenville (1300-950 Ma) orogen, the Mid-Continent Granite-Rhyolite (1500-1300 Ma), and the Yavapai-Mazatzal (1800-1600 Ma) terranes as well as sparse Pan-African (700-500 Ma) and Canadian Shield (>1800 Ma) terranes. Zircon (U-Th)/He ages record tectonic cooling and exhumation in the U.S. since the Mesoproterozoic related to the Grenville to Laramide Orogenies. The combined crystallization and cooling information from single zircon double dating can differentiate volcanic and plutonic zircons. Importantly, the U-Pb-He double dating approach allows for the differentiation between multiple possible crystallization-age sources on the basis of their subsequent tectonic evolution. In particular, for Grenville zircons that are present in all of lower Miocene samples, four distinct zircon U-Pb-He age combinations are recognizable that can be traced back to four different possible sources. The integrated U-Pb and (U-Th)/He data eliminate some ambiguities and improves the provenance interpretation for the lower Miocene strata in the northern Gulf of Mexico Basin and illustrate the applicability of this approach for other large-scale basins to reconstruct sediment\n\nIn-Situ U-Pb Dating of Apatite by Hiroshima-SHRIMP: Contributions to Earth and Planetary Science.\n\nPubMed\n\nTerada, Kentaro; Sano, Yuji\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThe Sensitive High Resolution Ion MicroProbe (SHRIMP) is the first ion microprobe dedicated to geological isotopic analyses, especially in-situ analyses related to the geochronology of zircon. Such a sophisticated ion probe, which can attain a high sensitivity at a high mass resolution, based on a double focusing high mass-resolution spectrometer, designed by Matsuda (1974), was constructed at the Australian National University. In 1996, such an instrument was installed at Hiroshima University and was the first SHRIMP to be installed in Japan. Since its installation, our focus has been on the in-situ U-Pb dating of the mineral apatite, as well as zircon, which is a more common U-bearing mineral. This provides the possibility for extending the use of in-situ U-Pb dating from determining the age of formation of volcanic, granitic, sedimentary and metamorphic minerals to the direct determination of the diagenetic age of fossils and/or the crystallization age of various meteorites, which can provide new insights into the thermal history on the Earth and/or the Solar System. In this paper, we review the methodology associated with in-situ apatite dating and our contribution to Earth and Planetary Science over the past 16 years.\n\nPrecise U/Pb zircons dates of bentonites in Upper Ordovician and Lower Silurian reference sections in North America and Britain.\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSuarez, S. E.; Brookfield, M. E.; Catlos, E. J.; Stockli, D. F.; Batchelor, R. A.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nThe end of the Ordovician marks one of the greatest of the Earth's mass extinctions. One hypothesis explains this mass extinction as the result of a short-lived, major glaciation preceded by episodes of increased volcanism brought on by the Taconic orogeny. K-bentonites, weathered volcanic ash, provide evidence for increased volcanism. However, there is a lack of modern precise U-Pb dating of these ashes and some confusion in the biostratigraphy. The aim of this study is to obtain more precise U-Pb zircon ages from biostratigraphically constrained bentonites which will lead to better correlation of the Upper Ordovician and Lower Silurian relative time scales, as well as time the pulses of eruption. Zircon grains were extracted from the samples by heavy mineral separation and U-Pb dated using the Laser Ablation-Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometer at the University of Texas-Austin. We report here 3 precise U-Pb zircon ages from the Trenton Group, Ontario, Canada, and Dob's Linn, Scotland. The youngest age from the top of the Kirkfield Formation in Ontario is 448.0 +/- 18 Ma, which fits with existing late Ordovician stratigraphic ages. At Dob's Linn, Scotland, the site of the Ordovician/Silurian Global Boundary Stratigraphic Section and Point (GSSP), the youngest age for DL7, a bentonite 5 meters below the GSSP is 402.0 +/- 12.0 Ma, and for DL24L, a bentonite 8 meters above the GSSP is 358.2 +/- 7.9 Ma. These are Devonian ages in current timescales - the current age for the GSSP is 443.8 +/- 1.8 Ma, based on an U/Pb dates from a bentonite 1.6 meters above the GSSP at Dob's Linn. We are confident that our techniques rule out contamination and the most likely explanation is that the small zircons we analyzed either suffered Pb loss, or grew overgrowths during low grade hydrothermal metamorphism of the sediments during the intrusion of the Southern Upland Devonian granites during the Caledonian orogeny. These Devonian ages suggest that the 443.8 +/- 1.8 Ma age\n\nU Pb ages of angrites\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAmelin, Yuri\n\n2008-01-01\n\nPrecise U-Pb ages, determined with double spike ( 202Pb- 205Pb) thermal ionization m1ass spectrometry, are reported for angrites Angra dos Reis (AdoR), Lewis Cliff 86010 (LEW), and D'Orbigny. Nineteen of 23 acid-washed pyroxene fractions from these meteorites and whole rock fractions from D'Orbigny contain between 0.5 and 1.3 pg of total common Pb, indistinguishable from analytical blank. Measured 206Pb/ 204Pb ratios in these fractions are between 6300 and 14,100 for AdoR, 1160-4500 for LEW, and 608-8500 for D'Orbigny. Blank-corrected 206Pb/ 204Pb ratios for all three meteorites vary from 2160 to over 100,000. These fractions yielded precise and reproducible 207Pb â/ 206Pb â dates with the average values of 4557.65 Â± 0.13 Ma for AdoR, 4558.55 Â± 0.15 Ma for LEW, and 4564.42 Â± 0.12 Ma for D'Orbigny. Pb-Pb isochrons including data with slightly elevated common Pb, and U-Pb upper concordia intercepts, yield similar dates. The implications of these new Pb-isotopic ages of angrites are threefold. First, they demonstrate that AdoR and LEW are not coeval, and the group of \"slowly cooled\" angrites is therefore genetically diverse. Second, the new age of LEW suggests an upward revision of 53Mn- 53Cr \"absolute\" ages by 0.7 Ma. Third, a precise age of D'Orbigny allows consistent linking of the 53Mn- 53Cr and 26Al- 26Mg extinct nuclide chronometers to the absolute lime scale.\n\nTectono-magmatic evolution of the Chihuahua-Sinaloa border region in northern Mexico: Insights from zircon-apatite U-Pb geochronology, zircon Hf isotope composition and geochemistry of granodiorite intrusions\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMahar, Munazzam Ali; Goodell, Philip C.; Feinstein, Michael Nicholas\n\n2016-11-01\n\nWe present the whole-rock geochemistry, LA-ICP-MS zircon-apatite U-Pb ages and zircon Hf isotope composition of the granodioritic plutons at the southwestern boundary of Chihuahua with the states of Sinaloa and Sonora. These granodiorites are exposed in the north and south of the Rio El Fuerte in southwest Chihuahua and northern Sinaloa. The magmatism spans over a time period of 37 Ma from 90 to 53 Ma. Zircons are exclusively magmatic with strong oscillatory zoning. No inheritance of any age has been observed. Our new U-Pb dating ( 250 analyses) does not support the involvement of older basement lithologies in the generation of the granitic magmas. The U-Pb apatite ages from granodiorites in southwest Chihuahua vary from 52 to 70 Ma. These apatite ages are 1 to 20 Ma younger than the corresponding zircon U-Pb crystallization ages, suggesting variable cooling rates from very fast to 15 Â°C/Ma ( 800 Â°C to 500 Â°C) and shallow to moderate emplacement depths. In contrast, U-Pb apatite ages from the Sinaloa batholith are restricted from 64 to 61 Ma and are indistinguishable from the zircon U-Pb ages range from 67 to 60 Ma within the error, indicating rapid cooling and very shallow emplacement. However, one sample from El Realito showed a larger difference of 20 Ma in zircon-apatite age pair: zircon 80 Â± 0.8 Ma and apatite 60.6 Â± 4 Ma, suggesting a slower cooling rate of 15 Â°C/Ma. The weighted mean initial ÎµHf (t) isotope composition (2Ï) of granodiorites varies from + 1.8 to + 5.2. The radiogenic Hf isotope composition coupled with previous Sr-Nd isotope data demonstrates a significant shift from multiple crustal sources in the Sonoran batholithic belt to the predominant contribution of the mantle-derived magmas in the southwest Chihuahua and northern Sinaloa. Based on U-Pb ages, the absence of inheritance, typical high Th/U ratio and radiogenic Hf isotope composition, we suggest that the Late Cretaceous-Paleogene magmatic rocks in this region are not derived from\n\nZircon U-Pb chronology, geochemistry and Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic compositions of the Volcanic Rocks in the Elashan area, NW China: petrogenesis and tectonic implications\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZhou, H.; Wei, J.; Shi, W.; Li, P.; Chen, M.; Zhao, X.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nElashan area is located in the intersection of the East Kunlun Orogenic Belt (EKOB) and the West Qinling Orogenic (WQOB).

They are enriched in large ion lithophile elements (LILEs) and light rare earth elements (LREEs) and depleted in some high field strength elements (HFSEs, e.g., Nb, Ta, P and Ti), while having a flat heavy REE (HREEs) pattern. The âREE values of 178.68 to 298.11 ppm, average 230.50 ppm. The LREE/HREE values of 4.39 to 11.78 ppm, average 6.77 ppm. REE fractionation is obvious, REE distribution curve was right smooth, and have slightly negative Eu anomalies (Eu/Eu*=0.44-0.80, average 0.60), which as similar to the island arc volcanic rocks. The volcanic rocks have initial 87Sr/86Sr ratios of 0.71028-0.71232, ÉNd(t) values of -6.7 to -7.6, with T2DM-Nd ranging from 1561 to 1640 Ma. Pb isotopic composition (206 Pb / 204 Pb)t = 18.055 18.330, (207 Pb / 204 Pb)t = 15.586 15.618, (208 Pb / 204 Pb)t = 37.677 38.332. Geochemical and Sr-Nd-Pb isotopes indicates that Elashan group volcanic magma derived mainly from the lower crust. Elashan group volcanic rocks is the productive East Kunlun block and West Qinling block collision, which makes the thicken crust caused partial melting in the study area. The source rocks is probably from metamorphic sandstone of Bayankala. But with Y-Nb and Rb-(Y+Nb), R1-R2 and Rb/10-Hf-Ta*3 diagrams showing that intermediate-acid rocks mainly formed in volcanic arc-collision environment, probably the collision event is short , therefore rocks retain the original island\n\nMatrix effects for elemental fractionation within ICPMS: applications for U-Th-Pb geochronology\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nChen, W.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nRecent development in instruments provides significant technical supports for daily, quick, money saving geochemical analyses. Laser ablation ICPMS stands out due to these reasons, especially for the U-Th-Pb isotopic dating. Matrix-matched external standardization is by far the most common approach used in U-Th-Pb dating via LA-ICPMS. However, matrix-effects between standard and sample for in-situ dating have shown to be both significant and insignificant. It remains mysterious whether a well matrix-matched standard is needed for U-Th-Pb dating by LA-ICPMS. This study provides an experimental framework for the understanding of matrix effects induced elemental fractionation for U-Th-Pb associated with ICPMS. A preliminary study on the influence of varied U, Th and Pb amounts on their fractionations has been carried out. Experimental data show that different U, Th and Pb contents result in varied 238U/206Pb and 232Th/208Pb ratios. The fractionations of U/Pb and Th/Pb increase with the increasing contents (1 ppb to 100 ppb) with a strong positive anomaly at 10 ppb. Matrixes representing minerals frequently used in dating have been investigated for the influences on U/Pb and Th/Pb fractionations, which suggest a complicated effect. Little fractionations observed between mineral pairs (e.g., monazite and apatite; zircon and perovskite; rutile and perovskite; xenotime and baddeleyite), whereas large fractionations identified for other minerals (e.g., zircon and baddeleyite; monazite and sphene; rutile and baddeleyite). Single element matrix (i.e., Si, P, Ca, Zr, Ti) has been studied to identify their effects on the fractionations. U/Pb ratio increases with the increasing Si and P contents, whereas it decreases for Zr, Ca and Ti. Th/Pb ratio increases with increasing Si contents, decreases for P and Zr, and increases first then decreases for Ca and Ti. Above all, different matrix and U, Th and Pb amounts show distinct U/Pb and Th/Pb fractionations within ICPMS.

R.; Shaffer, M. E. F.; Ratschbacher, L.; Kylander-Clark, A. R.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nXenoliths that erupted in the SE Pamir of Tajikistan at 11.2 Ma from 1000-1050Â°C and 90 km depth illuminate what happens when crust founders into the mantle. The xenoliths are a broad range of crustal rock types and contain abundant xenoliths whose U-Pb isotopic ratios and trace-element contents were examined by laser-ablation split stream inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Cathodoluminescence imaging of the grains shows igneous cores with oscillatory zoning overprinted by substantial recrystallization. The bulk of the U-Pb dates are concordant and range from 160 Ma to 11 Ma. The range of dates suggest that the xenoliths were likely derived from the Jurassic-Cretaceous Andean-style magmatic arc and its Proterozoic-Mesozoic host rocks along the southern margin of Asia. The zircons show distinct changes in Eu anomaly, Lu/Gd ratio, and Ti concentrations that are interpreted to indicate garnet growth and minimal heating at 22-20 Ma, and then 200-300Â°C of heating, 25 km of burial, and alkali-carbonate melt injection at 14-11 Ma. These changes are interpreted to coincide with: i) heat input due to Indian slab breakoff at 22â20 Ma; ii) rapid thickening and foundering of the Pamir lithosphere at 14â11 Ma, prior to and synchronous with collision between deep Indian and Asian lithospheres beneath the Pamir.\n\nU-Pb Ages of Lunar Apatites\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nVaughan, J.; Nemchin, A. A.; Pidgeon, R. T.; Meyer, Charles\n\n2006-01-01\n\nApatite is one of the minerals that is rarely utilized in U-Pb geochronology, compared to some other U-rich accessory phases. Relatively low U concentration, commonly high proportion of common Pb and low closure temperature of U-Pb system of apatite inhibit its application as geochronological tool when other minerals such as zircon are widely available. However, zircon appear to be restricted to certain type of lunar rocks, carrying so called KREEP signature, whereas apatite (and whitlockite) is a common accessory mineral in the lunar samples. Therefore, utilizing apatite for lunar chronology may increase the pool of rocks that are available for U-Pb dating. The low stability of U-Pb systematics of apatite may also result in the resetting of the system during meteoritic bombardment, in which case apatite may provide an additional tool for the study of the impact history of the Moon. In order to investigate these possibilities, we have analysed apatites and zircons from two breccia samples collected during the Apollo 14 mission. Both samples were collected within the Fra Mauro formation, which is interpreted as a material ejected during the impact that formed the Imbrium Basin.\n\nPetrogenesis of granodiorite in the Balong region, eastern Kunlun Orogen, China: Constraints from zircon U-Pb geochronology, geochemistry and Sr-Nd-Hf isotopes\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHuang, X.; Li, H.; Wang, Y.; Liu, Y.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nNumerous granitoid intrusions that close to the Balong region have great scientific significance to reveal tectonic evolution and geodynamic background of eastern Kunlun Orogen (EKO). Balong granodiorite (BLG) is located at the northern of the EKO. It generally emplaced into the Proterozoic to Lower Palaeozoic rocks and contains abundant mafic microgranular enclaves. LA-ICP-MS zircon U-Pb dating of the BLG gives a 206Pb/238U age of 230.7Â±1.9 Ma, indicating that it was emplaced in the Late Triassic. The BLG is high-K calc-alkaline series and metaluminous, with SiO2 of 59.86 61.83%, K2O+Na2O of 5.98 6.40%, CaO of 4.95 5.77% and P2O5 of 0.14% 0.18%. The granodioritic rocks are enriched in LILE (Ba, Rb, Sr), but depleted in HFSE (Nb, Ta, P, Ti), with weak negative Eu anomalies (Î´Eu=0.70 0.82). Mineralogy and geochemistry of the rocks show an affinity to I-type granite. The BLG, having (87Sr/86Sr)i ratios of 0.70819 to 0.70832, ÉNd(t) values of -5.27 to -5.75, and zircon ÉHf(t) values ranging from -3.86 to -1.34. The whole-rock Nd isotopic model ages (1432 1471 Ma) and zircon Hf isotopic model ages (1205 1357 Ma) indicate that the BLG is generated by partial melting of lower crust (Precambrian metabasaltic basement rocks) with different degree of involvement of mantle material. Combined with regional geological data, the granodiorite was derived from dehydration melting of mafic lower crustal rocks during the subduction of the Anyemaqen ocean lithosphere at Late Permian-Triassic in a subduction setting. Basaltic magma underplating and crust-mantle mixing are main mechanisms for the origin of large-scale I-type granitoid in Balong.\n\nCapability of U-Pb dating of zircons from Quaternary tephra: Jemez Mountains, NM, and La Sal Mountains, UT, USA\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKrautz, Jana; Hofmann, Mandy; GÃ¤rtner, Andreas; Linnemann, Ulf; Kleber, Arno\n\n2018-01-01\n\nTwo Quaternary tephras derived from the Jemez Mountains, New Mexico - the Guaje and Tsankawi tephras - are difficult to distinguish due to their similar glass-shard chemical composition. Differences in bulk chemical composition are small as well. Here we examine the feasibility to assign an age to a distal tephra layer in the La Sal Mountains, Utah, by U-Pb dating of zircons and to correlate it with one of the two Jemez eruptions. We also dated original Jemez tephras for comparison. Even though the tephras are very young, we obtained reasonable age determinations using the youngest cluster of zircon grains overlapping in age at 2Ï. Thereafter, the Guaje tephra is 1.513 Â± 0.021 Myr old. The La Sal Mountains tephra is correlated with the Tsankawi tephra. Three samples yielded a common age range of 1.31-1.40 Myr. All ages are in slight disagreement with published age determinations obtained by 40Ar / 39Ar dating. These findings indicate that distal Jemez tephras can be distinguished by U-Pb dating. Furthermore, we encourage giving this method a try for age assignments even of Quaternary volcanic material.\n\nHigh-precision ID-TIMS zircon U-Pb geochronology using new 1013 Ohm resistors\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nVon Quadt, A.; Buret, Y.; Large, S.; Peytcheva, I.; Trinquier, A.; Wotzlaw, J. F.\n\n2015-12-01\n\nFaraday cups equipped with high gain amplifiers provide a means to measure small ion beams in static mode without the limited linear range of ion counting systems. We tested the application of newly available 1013 Ohm resistors to ID-TIMS zircon U-Pb geochronology using a range of natural and synthetic reference materials. The TritonPlus-RPQ at the Institute of Geochemistry and Petrology, ETH Zurich, is equipped with five new 1013 Ohm resistors and one MasCom secondary electron multiplier, allowing to measure the 202-204-205-206-207-208Pb masses in static mode. U is measured subsequently as U-oxide (265-267-270UO2) during a second step, also in static Faraday mode. The gain calibration of the 1013 Ohm resistors was performed using the procedure of Trinquier (2014), with 144Nd-146Nd being measured using 1011 Ohm resistor and 142-143-145-148-150Nd being measured using 1013 Ohm resitors (Trinquier, 2014; Koornneef et al., 2014). Standard deviations of the noise in all five new 1013 Ohm resistors are lower than 5.0 x 10-6 over a 6 month period, with no shift occurring over this time interval. This new detector set-up was tested by analyzing natural zircon standard materials and synthetic U/Pb solutions (www.earthime.org), ranging in age from ~2 Ma to ~600 Ma. All natural zircon standards were chemically abraded (Mattinson, 2005) and all samples were spiked with the ET2535 tracer solution. U-Pb dates obtained using the static measurement routine are compared to measurements employing dynamic peak jumping routines on the MasCom multiplier. This study illustrates the benefits and current limitations of using high gain amplifiers to measure small ion beams for zircon U-Pb geochronology compared to conventional dynamic ion counting techniques.

Baddeleyite (monoclinic ZrO2) is a refractory mineral chronometer of great potential to date these processes due to its widespread occurrence in achondrites and robust U-Pb isotopic systematics, but there is little understanding of shock-effects on this phase. Here we present new nano-structural measurements of baddeleyite grains in a thin-section of the highly-shocked basaltic shergottite Northwest Africa (NWA) 5298, using high-resolution electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) techniques, to investigate shock-effects and their linkage with U-Pb isotopic disturbance that has previously been documented by in-situ U-Pb isotopic analyses. The shock-altered state of originally igneous baddeleyite grains is highly variable across the thin-section and often within single grains. Analyzed grains range from those that preserve primary (magmatic) twinning and trace-element zonation (baddeleyite shock Group 1), to quasi-amorphous ZrO2 (Group 2) and to recrystallized micro-granular domains of baddeleyite (Group 3). These groups correlate closely with measured U-Pb isotope compositions. Primary igneous features in Group 1 baddeleyites (n = 5) are retained in high shock impedance grain environments, and an average of these grains yields a revised late-Amazonian magmatic crystallization age of 175 Â± 30 Ma for this shergottite. The youngest U-Pb dates occur from Group 3 recrystallized nano- to micro-granular baddeleyite grains, indicating that it is post-shock heating and new mineral growth that drives much of the isotopic disturbance, rather than just shock deformation and phase transitions. Our data demonstrate that a systematic multi-stage microstructural evolution in\n\nHigh-Precision U-Pb Geochronology of Ice River Perovskite: A Possible Interlaboratory and Intertechnique EARTHTIME Standard\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBurgess, S. D.; Bowring, S. A.; Heaman, L. M.\n\n2012-12-01\n\nAccurate and precise U-Pb geochronology of accessory phases other than zircon are required for dating some LIP basalts or determining the temporal patterns of kimberlite pipes, for example. Advances in precision and accuracy lead directly to an increase in the complexity of questions that can be posed. U-Pb geochronology of perovskite (CaTiO3) has been applied to silica-undersaturated basalts, carbonatites, alkaline igneous rocks, and kimberlites. Most published IDTIMS perovskite dates have 2-sigma precisions at the ~0.2% level for weighted mean 206Pb/238U dates, much less than possible with IDTIMS analyses of zircons, which limits the applicability of perovskite in high-precision applications. Precision on perovskite dates is lower than zircon because of common Pb, which in some cases can be up to 50% of the total Pb and must be corrected for and accurately partitioned between blank and initial. Relatively small changes in the composition of common Pb can result in inaccurate but precise dates. In many cases minerals with significant common Pb are corrected using Stacey and Kramers (1975) two stage Pb evolution model. This can be done without serious consequence to the final date for minerals with high U/Pb ratios. In the more common case where U/Pb ratios are relatively low and the proportion of common Pb is large, applying a model-derived Pb isotopic composition rather than measuring it directly can introduce percent-level inaccuracy to dates calculated with precisely known U/Pb ratios. Direct measurement of the common Pb composition can be done on a U-poor mineral that co-crystallized with perovskite; feldspar and clinopyroxene are commonly used. Clinopyroxene can contain significant in-grown radiogenic Pb and our experiments indicate that it is not eliminated by aggressive step-wise leaching. The U/Pb ratio in clinopyroxene is generally low (20 < mu < 50) but significant. Other workers (e.g. Kamo et al., 2003; Corfu and Dahlgren, 2008), have used two methods\n\n210Pb dating\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nSwarzenski, Peter W.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nRoughly fifty years ago, a small group of scientists from Belgium and the United States, trying to better constrain ice sheet accumulation rates, attempted to apply what was then know about environmental lead as a potential geochronometer. Thus Goldberg (1963) developed the first principles of the 210Pb dating method, which was soon followed by a paper by Crozaz et al. (1964), who examined accumulation history of Antarctic snow using 210Pb. Shortly thereafter, Koide et al. (1972, 1973) adapted this technique to unravel sediment deposition and accumulation records in deep-sea environments. Serendipitously, they chose to work in a deep basin off California, where an independent and robust age model had already been developed. Krishanswami et al. (1971) extended the use of this technique to lacustrine deposits to reconstruct depositional histories of lake sediment, and maybe more importantly, contaminant inputs and burial. Thus, the powerful tool for dating recent (up to about one century old) sediment deposits was established and soon widely adopted. Today almost all oceanographic or limnologic studies that address recent depositional reconstructions employ 210Pb as one of several possible geochronometers (Andrews et al., 2009; Gale, 2009; Baskaran, 2011; Persson and Helms, 2011). This paper presents a short overview of the principles of 210Pb dating and provides a few examples that illustrate the utility of this tracer in contrasting depositional systems. Potential caveats and uncertainties (Appleby et al., 1986; Binford, 1990; Binford et al., 1993; Smith, 2001; Hancock et al., 2002) inherent to the use and interpretation of 210Pb-derived age-models are also introduced. Recommendations as to best practices for most reliable uses and reporting are presented in the summary.\n\nThe double-edged sword of high-precision U-Pb geochronology or be careful what you wish for. (Invited)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBowring, S. A.\n\n2010-12-01\n\nOver the past two decades, U-Pb geochronology by ID-TIMS has been refined to achieve internal (analytical) uncertainties on a single grain analysis of Â± ~ 0.1-0.2%, and 0.05% or better on weighted mean dates. This level of precision enables unprecedented evaluation of the rates and durations of geological processes, from magma chamber evolution to mass extinctions and recoveries. The increased precision, however, exposes complexity in magmatic/volcanic systems and highlights the importance of corrections related to disequilibrium partitioning of intermediate daughter products, and raises questions as to how best to interpret the complex spectrum of dates characteristic of many volcanic rocks. In addition, the increased precision requires renewed emphasis on the accuracy of U decay constants, the isotopic composition of U, the calibration of isotopic tracers, and the accurate propagation of uncertainties It is now commonplace in the high precision dating of volcanic ash-beds to analyze 5-20 single grains of zircon in an attempt to resolve the eruption/depositional age. Data sets with dispersion far in excess of analytical uncertainties are interpreted to reflect Pb-loss, inheritance, and protracted crystallization, often supported with zircon chemistry. In most cases, a weighted mean of the youngest reproducible dates is interpreted as the time of eruption/deposition. Crystallization histories of silicic magmatic systems recovered from plutonic rocks may also be protracted, though may not be directly applicable to silicic eruptions; each sample must be evaluated independently. A key to robust interpretations is the integration high-spatial resolution zircon trace element geochemistry with high-precision ID-TIMS analyses. The EARTHTIME initiative has focused on many of these issues, and the larger subject of constructing a timeline for earth history using both U-Pb and Ar-Ar chronometers. Despite continuing improvements in both, comparing dates for the same rock\n\nOrigin and evolution of multi-stage felsic melts in eastern Gangdese belt: Constraints from U-Pb zircon dating and Hf isotopic composition\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGuo, Liang; Zhang, Hong-Fei; Harris, Nigel; Pan, Fa-Bin; Xu, Wang-Chun\n\n2011-11-01\n\nThis integrated study of whole rock geochemistry, zircon U-Pb dating and Hf isotope composition for seven felsic rocks from the Nyingchi Complex in eastern Himalayan syntaxis has revealed a complex magmatic history for the eastern Gangdese belt. This involves multiple melt sources and mechanisms that uniquely identify the tectonic evolution of this part of the Himalayan orogen. Our U-Pb zircon dating reveals five stages of magmatic or anatectic events: 165, 81, 61, 50 and 25 Ma. The Jurassic granitic gneiss (165 Ma) exhibits ÎµHf(t) values of + 1.4 to + 3.5. The late Cretaceous granite (81 Ma) shows variable ÎµHf(t) values from - 0.9 to + 6.2, indicating a binary mixing between juvenile and old crustal materials. The Paleocene granodioritic gneiss (61 Ma) has ÎµHf(t) values of + 5.4 to + 8.0, suggesting that it originated from partial melting of a juvenile crustal material. The Eocene anatexis is recorded in the leucosome, which has Hf isotopic composition similar to that of the Jurassic granite, indicating that the leucosome could be derived from partial melting of the Jurassic granite. The late Oligocene biotite granite (25 Ma) shows adakitic geochemical characteristics, with Sr/Y = 49.3-56.6. The presence of a large number of inherited zircons and negative ÎµHf(t) values suggest that it sourced from anatexis of crustal materials. In contrast to the Gangdese batholiths that are mainly derived from juvenile crustal source in central Tibet, the old crustal materials play an important role for the magma generation of the felsic rocks, suggesting the existence of a crustal basement in the eastern Gangdese belt. These correspond to specific magmatic evolution stages during the convergence between India and Asia. The middle Jurassic granitic gneiss resulted from the northward subduction of the Neo-Tethyan oceanic slab. The late Cretaceous magmatism is probably related to the ocean ridge subduction. The Paleocene-Eocene magmatism, metamorphism and anatexis are\n\nNew uppermost Cambrian U-Pb date from Avalonian Wales and age of the Cambrian-Ordovician boundary\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nDavidek, K.; Landing, E.; Bowring, S.A.; Westrop, S.R.; Rushton, A.W.A.; Fortey, R.A.; Adrain, J.M.\n\n1998-01-01\n\nA crystal-rich volcaniclastic sandatone in the lower Peltura scarabaeoides Zone at Ogof-odi near Criccieth, North Wales, yields a U-Pb zircon age of 491 ?? 1 Ma. This late Late Cambrian date indicates a remarkably young age for the Cambrian-Ordovician boundary whose age must be less than 491 Ma. Hence the revised duration of the post-Placentian (trilobite-bearing) Cambrian indicates that local trilobite zonations allow a biostratigraphic resolution comparble to that provided by Ordovician graptolites and Mesozoic ammonites.\n\nThe 238U/235U isotope ratio of the Earth and the solar system: Constrains from a gravimetrically calibrated U double spike and implications for absolute Pb-Pb ages\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWeyer, Stefan; Noordmann, Janine; Brennecka, Greg; Richter, Stephan\n\n2010-05-01\n\nThe ratio of 238U and 235U, the two primordial U isotopes, has been assumed to be constant on Earth and in the solar system. The commonly accepted value for the 238U/235U ratio, which has been used in Pb-Pb dating for the last ~ 30 years, was 137.88. Within the last few years, it has been shown that 1) there are considerable U isotope variations (~1.3â°) within terrestrial material produced by isotope fractionation during chemical reactions [1-3] and 2) there are even larger isotope variations (at least 3.5â°) in calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions (CAIs) in meoteorites that define the currently accepted age of the solar system [4]. These findings are dramatic for geochronology, as a known 238U/235U is a requirement for Pb-Pb dating, the most precise dating technique for absolute ages. As 238U/235U variations can greatly affect the reported absolute Pb-Pb age, understanding and accurately measuring variation of the 238U/235U ratio in various materials is critical, With these new findings, the questions also arises of \"How well do we know the average U isotope composition of the Earth and the solar system?\" and \"How accurate can absolute Pb-Pb ages be?\" Our results using a gravimetrically calibrated 233U/236U double spike IRMM 3636 [5] indicate that the U standard NBL 950a, which was commonly used to define the excepted \"natural\" 238U/235U isotope ratio, has a slightly lower 238U/235U of 137.836 Â± 0.024. This value is indistinguishable from the U isotope compositions for NBL 960 and NBL112A, which have been determined by several laboratories, also using the newly calibrated U double spike IRMM 3636 [6]. These findings provide new implications about the average U isotope composition of the Earth and the solar system. Basalts display a very tight range of U isotope variations (~0.25-0.32â° relative to SRM 950a). Their U isotope composition is also very similar to that of chondrites [4], which however appear to show a slightly larger spread.

We report in this paper trace- and rare-earth-element concentrations and Pb-Pb isotope dating for the Ni-Mo-PGE-Au sulfide ores and their host black shales. Both the sulfide ores and their host black shales show similar trace-element distribution patterns with pronounced depletion in Th, Nb, Hf, Zr, and Ti, and extreme enrichment in U, Ni, Mo, and V compared to average upper crust. The high-field-strength elements, such as Zr, Hf, Nb, Ta, Sc, Th, rare-earth elements, Rb, and Ga, show significant inter-element correlations and may have been derived mainly from terrigenous sources. The redox sensitive elements, such as V, Ni, Mo, U, and Mn; base metals, such as Cu, Zn, and Pb; and Sr and Ba may have been derived from mixing of seawater and venting hydrothermal sources. The chondrite-normalized REE patterns, positive Eu and Y anomalies, and high Y/Ho ratios for the Ni-Mo-PGE-Au sulfide ores are also suggestive for their submarine hydrothermal-exhalative origin. A stepwise acid-leaching Pb-Pb isotope analytical technique has been employed for the Niutitang black shales and the Ni-Mo-PGE-Au sulfide ores, and two Pb-Pb isochron ages have been obtained for the black shales (531Â±24 Ma) and for the Ni-Mo-PGE-Au sulfide ores (521Â±54 Ma), respectively, which are identical and overlap within uncertainty, and are in good agreement with previously obtained ages for presumed age-equivalent strata.\n\nIn situ SIMS U-Pb dating of hydrothermal rutile: reliable age for the Zhesang Carlin-type gold deposit in the golden triangle region, SW China\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPi, Qiaohui; Hu, Ruizhong; Xiong, Bin; Li, Qiuli; Zhong, Richen\n\n2017-12-01\n\nThe contiguous region between Guangxi, Guizhou, and Yunnan, commonly referred to as the Golden Triangle region in SW China, hosts many Carlin-type gold deposits. Previously, the ages of the gold mineralization in this region have not been well constrained due to the lack of suitable minerals for radiometric dating. This paper reports the first SIMS U-Pb age of hydrothermal rutile crystals for the Zhesang Carlin-type gold deposit in the region. The hydrothermal U-bearing rutile associated with gold-bearing sulfides in the deposit yields an U-Pb age of 213.6 Â± 5.4 Ma, which is within the range of the previously reported arsenopyrite Re-Os isochron ages (204 Â± 19 to 235 Â± 33 Ma) for three other Carlin-type gold deposits in the region. Our new and more precise rutile U-Pb age confirms that the gold mineralization was contemporaneous with the Triassic W-Sn mineralization and associated granitic magmatism in the surrounding regions. Based on the temporal correlation, we postulate that coeval granitic plutons may be present at greater depths in the Golden Triangle region and that the formation of the Carlin-type gold deposits is probably linked to the coeval granitic magmatism in the region. This study clearly demonstrates that in situ rutile U-Pb dating is a robust tool for the geochronogical study of hydrothermal deposits that contain hydrothermal rutile.\n\nGeochronology, geochemistry and Sr-Nd-Pb-Hf isotopes of the Early Jurassic granodiorite from the Sankuanggou intrusion, Heilongjiang Province, Northeastern China: Petrogenesis and geodynamic implications\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDeng, Ke; Li, Qiugen; Chen, Yanjing; Zhang, Cheng; Zhu, Xuefeng; Xu, Qiangwei\n\n2018-01-01\n\nMesozoic granitoid rocks represent a volumetrically component of the Northeastern (NE) China and preserve useful information about the tectonomagmatic history of this region. The Sankuanggou intrusion associated with skarn Fe-Cu deposit in the Duobaoshan ore field within NE China primarily consists of granodiorite with minor alkali-feldspar granite and diorite, which intrudes the Ordovician Duobaoshan Formation in the region. Zircon LA-ICP-MS U-Pb geochronology and whole-rock geochemistry, and Sr-Nd-Pb-Hf isotope analysis were performed on the Sankuanggou intrusion to investigate the petrogenesis and geodynamic implications. Zircon U-Pb dating of magmatic zircons from the granodiorite rock suggests that the intrusion was emplaced in the Early Jurassic (177 Â± 1 Ma). Geochemically, it belongs to the metaluminous to slightly peraluminous high-K calc-alkaline I-type granitoids with a narrow range of SiO2 concentration (65.73-67.33 wt.%), high Ba, Sr, LREE and LILE contents and low abundance of Rb, Y, HREE and HFSE. All of these studied samples have homogeneous initial isotope traits with (87Sr/86Sr)i ranging from 0.70415 to 0.70423, ÎµNd(t) of + 3.6 to + 4.0, (206Pb/204Pb)i = 17.933-18.458, (207Pb/204Pb)i = 15.520-15.587 and (208Pb/204Pb)i = 37.523-38.087, and zircon ÎµHf(t) values varying from + 4.8 to + 9.9. These results, combined with the previous data, demonstrate that the Sankuanggou granitoids were formed by partial melting of the pre-existing juvenile crust in an extensional regime related to the post-collisional setting following the closure of the CAOB rather than previously proposed continental arc setting related to Paleo-Pacific or the Mongol-Okhotsk subduction, although their potential influence should not be dismissed.\n\nZircon U-Pb dating of eclogite from the Qiangtang terrane, north-central Tibet: a case of metamorphic zircon with magmatic geochemical features\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZhai, Qing-guo; Jahn, Bor-ming; Li, Xian-hua; Zhang, Ru-yuan; Li, Qiu-li; Yang, Ya-nan; Wang, Jun; Liu, Tong; Hu, Pei-yuan; Tang, Suo-han\n\n2017-06-01\n\nZircon is probably the most important mineral used in the dating formation of high-pressure (HP) and ultrahigh-pressure (UHP) metamorphic rocks. The origin of zircon, i.e., magmatic or metamorphic, is commonly assessed by its external morphology, internal structure, mineral inclusions, Th/U ratios and trace element composition. In this study, we present an unusual case of metamorphic zircon from the Qiangtang eclogite, north-central Tibet. The zircon grains contain numerous eclogite-facies mineral inclusions, including omphacite, phengite, garnet and rutile; hence, they are clearly of metamorphic origin. However, they display features similar to common magmatic zircon, including euhedral crystal habit, high Th/U ratios and enriched heavy rare earth elements pattern. We suggest that these zircon grains formed from a different reservoir from that for garnet where no trace elements was present and trace element equilibrium between zircon and garnet was achieved. U-Pb dating of zircon gave an age of 232-237 Ma for the eclogite, and that of rutile yielded a slightly younger age of ca. 217 Ma. These ages are consistent with the reported Lu-Hf mineral isochron and phengite Ar-Ar ages. The zircon U-Pb and mineral Lu-Hf isochron ages are interpreted as the time of the peak eclogite-facies metamorphism, whereas the rutile U-Pb and phengite Ar-Ar ages represent the time of exhumation to the middle crust. Thus, the distinction between metamorphic and magmatic zircons cannot be made using only Th/U ratios and heavy REE compositions for HP-UHP metamorphic rocks of oceanic derivation.\n\nCretaceous crust beneath SW Borneo: U-Pb dating of zircons from metamorphic and granitic rocks\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDavies, L.; Hall, R.; Armstrong, R.\n\n2012-12-01\n\nMetamorphic basement rocks from SW Borneo are undated but have been suggested to be Palaeozoic. This study shows they record low pressure 'Buchan-type' metamorphism and U-Pb SHRIMP dating of zircons indicates a mid-Cretaceous (volcaniclastic) protolith. SW Borneo is the southeast promontory of Sundaland, the continental core of SE Asia. It has no sedimentary cover and the exposed basement has been widely assumed to be a crustal fragment from the Indochina-China margin. Metamorphic rocks of the Pinoh Group in Kalimantan (Indonesian Borneo) are intruded by granitoid rocks of Jurassic-Cretaceous age, based on K-Ar dating, suggesting emplacement mainly between 130 and 80 Ma. The Pinoh metamorphic rocks have been described as a suite of pelitic schists, slates, phyllites, and hornfelses, and have not been dated, although they have been correlated with rocks elsewhere in Borneo of supposed Palaeozoic age. Pelitic schists contain biotite, chlorite, cordierite, andalusite, quartz, plagioclase and in some cases high-Mn almandine-rich garnet. Many have a shear fabric associated with biotite and fibrolite intergrowth. Contact metamorphism due to intrusion of the granitoid rocks produced hornfelses with abundant andalusite and cordierite porphyroblasts. Granitoids range from alkali-granite to tonalite and contain abundant hornblende and biotite, with rare white mica. Zircons from granitoid rocks exhibit sector- and concentric- zoning; some have xenocrystic cores mantled by magmatic zircon. There are four important age populations at c. 112, 98, 84 and 84 Ma broadly confirming earlier dating studies. There is a single granite body with a Jurassic age (186 Â± 2.3 Ma). Zircons from pelitic metamorphic rocks are typically euhedral, with no evidence of rounding or resorbing of grains; a few preserve volcanic textures. They record older ages than those from igneous rocks; U-Pb ages are Cretaceous with a major population between 134 and 110 Ma. A single sample contains Proterozoic\n\nRe-appraisal of the stratigraphy and determination of new U-Pb dates for the Sterkfontein hominin site, South Africa.\n\nPubMed\n\nPickering, Robyn; Kramers, Jan D\n\n2010-07-01\n\nSterkfontein Caves is the single richest early hominin site in the world with deposits yielding one or more species of Australopithecus and possible early Homo, as well as an extensive faunal collection. The inability to date the southern African cave sites accurately or precisely has hindered attempts to integrate the hominin fossil evidence into pan-African scenarios about human evolutionary history, and especially hominin biogeography. We have used U-Pb and U-Th techniques to date sheets of calcium carbonate flowstone inter-bedded between the fossiliferous sediments. For the first time, absolute age ranges can be assigned to the fossil-bearing deposits: Member 2 is between 2.8 +/- 0.28 and 2.6 +/- 0.30 Ma and Member 4 between 2.65 +/- 0.30 and 2.01 +/- 0.05 Ma. The age of 2.01 +/- 0.05 Ma for the top of Member 4 constrains the last appearance of Australopithecus africanus to 2 Ma. In the Silberberg Grotto we have reproduced the U-Pb age of approximately 2.2 Ma of for the flowstones associated with StW573. We believe that these deposits, including the fossil and the flowstones, accumulated rapidly around 2.2 Ma. The stratigraphy of the site is complex as sediments are exposed both in the underground chambers and at surface. We present a new interpretation of the stratigraphy based on surface mapping, boreholes logs and U-Pb ages. Every effort was made to retain the Member system, however, only Members 2 and 4 are recognized in the boreholes. We propose that the deposits formally known as Member 3 are in fact the distal equivalents of Member 4. The sediments of Members 2 and 4 consisted of cone-like deposits and probably never filled up the cave. The U-Th ages show that there are substantial deposits younger than 400 ka in the underground cave, underlying the older deposits, highlighting again that these cave fills are not simple layer-cakes.\n\nFrom opening to subduction of an oceanic domain constrained by LA-ICP-MS U-Pb zircon dating (Variscan belt, Southern Armorican Massif, France)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPaquette, J.-L.; BallÃ¨vre, M.; Peucat, J.-J.; Cornen, G.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nIn the Variscan belt of Western Europe, the lifetime and evolution of the oceanic domain is poorly constrained by sparse, outdated and unreliable multigrain ID-TIMS U-Pb zircon dating. In this article, we present a complete in situ LA-ICP-MS dataset of about 300 U-Pb zircon analyses obtained on most of the ophiolitic and eclogitic outcrops of Southern Brittany, comprising new dating of previously published zircon populations and newly discovered rock samples. In situ dating and cathodo-luminescence imaging of each zircon grain yields new absolute time-constraints on the evolution of the Galicia-Moldanubian Ocean. The new results confirm that the opening of this oceanic domain is well defined at about 490 Ma. In contrast, the generally-quoted 400-410 Ma-age for the high-pressure event related to the subduction of the oceanic crust is definitely not recorded in the zircons of the eclogites. In light of these new data, we propose that the obduction of oceanic rock"
