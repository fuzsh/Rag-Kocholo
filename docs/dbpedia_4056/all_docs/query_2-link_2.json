        "text": "Courtship Song and Body Movement Characteristics.\n\nR . turcicus has very long courtship song, and its duration ranges between 106 and 147 s (115–142 s in Yaralıgöz, 111–147 s in Türbe, and 106–146 s in Uluağaç). The song is composed of three complex phases and body movements that generate respective phases.\n\nPhase I was always the longest: 96.2–136.5 ( ) in the main part of the song ( C and D). The courtship begins with this phase, and males show high activity in this phase. Phase I starts without any preparation part and involves a series of phrases ( C and A–C). Duration of each phrase ranges between 6 and 37 s ( ). All phrases in Phase I consist of two different parts ( D). The first part of the phrase is Part a, which involves a series of very clear pulses being produced by only one leg (M1a; B). While one of the hind legs produces Part a of the phrase, the other leg stays in the higher position during the first half of Part a ( B). The inactive leg goes down in two steps to the same position with the song-producing leg in the remaining part of Part a ( B). Part a usually lasts about 0.47–2.82 s ( ).\n\nThe second part of the phrase is Part b, involving a series of very clear syllables that are produced by the alternation of the two legs (M1b1; B). Duration of Phase I, Part b ranges between 4.5 and 34.6 s and is composed of about 9–72 syllables, each usually lasting about 375–808 ms ( ; ). Each syllable in the phrase is produced alternatively by the two legs. Each leg has a different role in each syllable production. When the active leg starts to move (up and down steps) to produce song elements, the passive leg always slightly changes the position to the starting point, and the roles of these two legs change in the next syllable ( B). Thus, each syllable involves several pulses with high amplitude, produced by the active leg, and a noisy part with low amplitude, produced by the passive leg ( B). The male body tilts through the active leg, which is responsible for the high-amplitude pulses in the syllable. This movement continues from right to left during Part b ( B). Antennal movements of the males during Part a and Part b song production are such that they open the antenna side to side nearly 180° during M1a and M1b1 ( B).\n\nThe males produce a visual display of M1b2 when Part b is finished ( B). After completing Part b in the phrase, male raised the tibia upward (M1b2-II); then the tibia was jerked into the air (M1b2-III), and the antennae ( M1b2) were pushed backward ( B). The tibia returned to the same position very fast after the jerk movements, and during this period, the antennae also returned to the initial position ( M1b2-IV). Because the jerk needs fast and strong body movements, the body could be stabilized after two or three times move the M1b2-V and M1b2-VI. During this circulation, the antennae first moved back ( M1b2-V) and returned to the initial position ( M1b2-VI) like the first direction of the antennae, but this time the distance was shorter than M1b2-III and M1b2-IV ( B).\n\nThe males start the courtship behavior with Phase I and mostly stop somewhere else in the phrase series, which stems from the environmental effect or female movements. If courting is interrupted, courtship behavior is adopted again from the beginning of the ritual.\n\nPhase II was the second regular part of the song, and it was always shorter, 5.9–10.3s ( ), than Phase I ( ). Phase II starts after Phase I and involves a series of short phrases ( E). The duration of each phrase ranged between 0.42 and 0.98 s ( ). All phrases in Phase II consist of two parts ( G). The first part is Part c and involves a series of isolated and repeated similar syllables ( G), which are produced with nearly synchronous leg movements ( M2c). Part c usually lasts about 0.25–0.72 s and is composed of approximately 6–37 syllables, each of which usually lasts about 10–45 ms ( ). The last syllable in the Part c is always longer, 54–377 ms ( ), than previous syllables in this part ( G). The second part of the phrase is Part d, which is faster and represents a shorter version of Part c ( G). Syllables in this part are not clearly differentiated, as a result of the unsynchronized leg movements ( M2d). Part d usually lasts about 112–638 ms ( ).\n\nThe regular part of the courtship song ends with Phase II. After this phase, males always move toward the female. In most cases, the female jumps away. If the female keeps near the male after Phase II, the male starts to produce the last phase of the courtship behavior.\n\nPhase III was the last and irregular part of the song with a duration ranging between 1.07 and 7.44 s ( ). Although males do not produce a complex and extensive song pattern in Phase III , they show visual complexity and different behavioral activities in the last period of the song ( D). In this part, males reveal high activity to convince the female to mate. Male succession on mating period directly link to change the female directions by the male ( M3-I–IV). Throughout the complete courtship ritual until this phase, males generally stay in opposite directions of the females ( M3-I). When the Phase II part of the song finishes, the male moves toward the female head to touch it and then turns back to the initial position ( M3-I). This cycle is completed with making M1b2 movements after M3-I by the males ( D). The number of cycles in Phase III shows differences from song to song and from male to male.\n\nMeasurements of the six song parameters (durations of Phase I, Part a; Phase I, Part b; Phase II, Part c; and Phase III, Part d; and syllable period of Phase I, Part a and Phase II, Part c) obtained from 14 males from three different populations are listed in . A CDF analysis was performed with the use of these six parameters of the courtship song, and the results of the song CDF show that all populations were not separated, and they exhibit unique patterns ( )."
