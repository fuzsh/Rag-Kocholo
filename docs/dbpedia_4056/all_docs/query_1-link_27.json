You can decide for how long you would like to receive the cached result by setting the parameter in the validation request. If you select 30 days, then we would first check our cache for past TIN validations up to 30 days of the last time this TIN was validated. Fonoa stores validated data for a period of 7 years, so these can be retrieved for tax compliance purposes with an exact timestamp of when the validation of that specific TIN took place.\n\nDepending on the country you select, you might need to provide further information in order to verify the Tax Identification Number.\n\nCurrently, only Turkey requires such additional piece of information you will need to specify the Province, and the relevant Tax Office. See attached request examples below, the request composes parameters for Istanbul (034) province and BÃœYÃœK MÃœK. VD.
