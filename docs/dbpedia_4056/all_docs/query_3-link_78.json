        "text": "Urbanization is the process of transforming a characteristically rural society into an urban one. The urban population is growing at an increasing rate while the rural population is declining, giving rise to imbalances in the development between urban and rural areas. The government’s strategy is to distribute the development to the major settlement centres in the rural areas, which are experiencing the same effects of urbanization as the urban areas in terms of changes to the use of land, especially the reduction of agricultural land and the increase in built-up areas. This study used the method of overlay in GIS applications to investigate land use changes, the speed of urban expansion and direction of development that has taken place from the period 2001 to 2018 in the town of Kuala Nerang, Kedah. This town has undergone a change in its status from a main settlement centre to a district administrative centre. Agricultural lands, which were targeted for development in the rural ar...\n\nThe relocation of the capital city of Indonesia to Sepaku District, North Penajam Paser Regency, East Kalimantan will have an impact on all existing aspects. Land cover in Sepaku District has decreased from year to year. The area of vegetated land cover in Sepaku District is assumed to be decreasing due to the relocation of the New Capital City (NCC) to the area, which will have a negative impact on the environment. Therefore, this study aims to determine the level of land cover change in Sepaku District and discuss how the condition of land cover in Sepaku District after the construction of the New Capital City (NCC). The method in this study uses GIS (Geographical Information System) analysis and descriptive analysis. The data used are land cover data from 2009 to 2019 to find out changes in land cover and population data from BPS to project the population. Based on the results of the analysis of land cover data from 2009 to 2019 there was a change from scrubland to industrial for...\n\nLand use of a region is the mirror image of the people’s livelihood. In rural areas agricultural land play the dominant role in its economy and built-up area i.e. residential, commercial and industrial area which control the economic activities of the region. Land use change occurs due to various reasons in different places and time. In 21st century, rapid urbanization causes not only the changes in land use but also it becomes a threat to the environment and ecology. So the land use change needs a special attention for sustainable development. New Town started to built in part of Rajarhat Block of North 24 Parganas and part of Bhangar Block of South 24 Parganas since 1990. It is located to the north-east of Salt Lake City and just to the north of East Calcutta Wetland. As this planned town is only 7 km from Kolkata, rapid growth of commercial, industrial and residential developments take place in this region. This on-going township project causes a huge change in land use and the changing land use has an enormous effect on the inhabitants of the old rural settlement. Authors aim to investigate the changing pattern of land use of this New Town area and its impact on the existing rural population. As the agricultural land transformed into residential and commercial or other urban functional areas, there is a gradual influx of population from different parts of Bengal and other parts of India as well. Some of rural populations are rehabilitated by the Government of West Bengal in other part of New Town. Some of the people lost their agricultural land and some of them lost their work related to primary activities i.e. agricultural labour, fishing etc. At first (village wise) demographic structure and its related changing occupational pattern have been analysed and a perception survey has undertaken by the authors to measure the level of satisfaction/dissatisfaction and to explain the factors behind it. Author made a careful study to observe the effect of land use change on the socio-economic conditions of the existing rural settlement of that region.\n\nThe application of geographic information systems (GIS) and remote sensing (RS) in urban planning are important tools for determining land use and land cover for development purposes. More data about urban development is needed to ensure effective land use planning. This study focuses on using GIS and RS to produce information about development changes in land use land cover in support of land use planning. The emphasis of this study will be on land development, change detection, and planning. LULC classes include bare land cover, built-up land cover, agriculture, forest and water bodies. Data obtained was pre-processed and classified using a maximum likelihood classifier and further analyzed using accuracy assessment using the kappa coefficient. The results showed that the overall accuracy of the LULC was 86.7%, 90% and 90%, whereas the kappa coefficient resembled 83.7%, 88.2%, and 92.6% for the years 2002, 2013 and 2022, respectively. This study indicated that in the last 20 years, forested land and built-up areas had significantly increased by 10.1% and 4.1%, respectively, in the basin. The overall increase of the built-up regions in vegetation was found to be 3.6% in total. This study demonstrates that integrating GIS with RS data is useful for providing baseline spatial information that assists informed land use planning managers in increasing environmental sustainability and development.\n\nUrban growth is a global phenomenon that comes with human settlements and accompanying anthropogenic activities plays an important role in the land use and land cover change. The city of Bangalore grew to 716 Km2 in 2007 with the creation of Bruhat Bangalore MahanagaraPalike (Pavan Srinath, 2014).The rapid urbanization in last four decades resulting in increase of paved area and decrease in agricultural land area which used to act as a percolation zone. It has also brought reduction in arable land, forest land and water bodies. The change of Land cover and land use in major cities is one of the major reasons for climate change. The paper is focused on change in Land cover and Land use that have taken place in Vrishabavathi sub-watershed (Upstream of Gali Anjaneya Temple of Bangalore) from 1973 to 2014 by using remote sensing and GIS techniques. The conclusions are drawn based on analyzing the multi-temporal and multi-spectral Landsat satellite images. The Landsat MSS satellite images for the year 1973, Landsat - thematic mapper (TM) satellite images for the year 1992, and Landsat - Enhanced Thematic mapper plus (ETM+) satellite images for the years 2001 and 2014 have been utilized to quantify the land-use /land-cover changes and the trend of urban growth in study area. The pattern of change in land use and land cover (LULCC) is obtained using four quantitative indices: Landuse/Landcover (LULC) Change Intensity Index (Ti), Dynamic Index (Ki), Integrated Index (Ld), and Rate of Change Index (Ai). These indices critically analyse the extent, rate, as well as the magnitude f change amongst the various LULC in the study area and provide a basis for comparison with other places and explain the nature of spatio-temporal dynamics of LULC as an Index of land degradation. The four indices computed for the study region determines the intensity with which the land surface and land cover is subjected change due to human activities. The Land-use/land-cover change due to new built-up area is found to be 13 % between 1973 and 1992, 3 % between 1992 and 2002, 11 % and between 2002 and 2014. The Annual growth rate of built-up area for these study years was 0.65% between 1973 and 1992 and 0.55 % between 2002 and 2014 respectively. The land-use/land-cover change statistics showed that the annual conversion rate of agricultural land and barren land to built-up area between 2002 and 2014accounted for more than 1%.\n\nThis study aims to determine the evaluation of land suitability in the development of settlements, the carrying capacity and the capacity of the environment for settlements, as well as the direction of settlement development in Ranah Batahan District, West Pasaman Regency. Data collection techniques include observation data, remote sensing data, Bappeda, BPS, interviews, and documentation. The sampling technique of this study was Total Sampling. Data analysis techniques used GIS analysis and Analytical Hierarchy Process. The results showed that: (1) land suitability for the development of settlement in Ranah Batahan District resulted in 4 classes of land suitability. Very suitable land consists of 9 land units, suitable land consists of 19 land units, land suitably consists of marginal land consists of 3 land units, unsuitable land consists of 8 land units. (2) the carrying capacity of land in the two Rural in Ranah Batahan District is very low. The carrying capacity of the land in ...\n\n— Land use that does not conform to its city plan is a common phenomenon that happens on fast growing cities. Land use conversion usually caused by discrepancy between the reasoning that underlie a city plan and market's judgement. At the area around Ir. Soekarno Street / MERR that designed as a part of Surabaya City Ring Road, the land use is gradually changing from settlement area into commercial area. In urban planning, it is important to understand the cause of land use change in order to be able to handle the implication well. Therefore, the research objective was to identify the factors that affecting land use conversion from settlement area into commercial area at Ir. Soekarno Street/MERR, Rungkut Madya Street, and Medokan Ayu Street. The research's methods are descriptive. The descriptive analysis was used to describe the land use change pattern at Ir. Soekarno Street/MERR, Rungkut Madya Street, and Medokan Ayu Street. Multiple regression analysis was used to analyses the factors that affecting land use conversion from settlement area into commercial area. The result showed that the factors that affecting land use conversion are land's value, average income of the land owner, and land use in the surrounding area.\n\nChanges in land use have caused various spatial consequences that occur substantially in an area. This study examines the pattern of land use changes from different room variations. The research was at a location in Ambon City. The materials in this study are Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS in 2010 and 2020, DEM SRTM, administrative maps, and development center maps. Research data were analyzed descriptively analytical, spatial, and temporal from the overlay results. The study results in show changes over ten years (2010-2020), indicating an increase in settlements covering an area of 23,810 ha per year. Differences in spatial variations based on administrative site, additional blocks in Sirimau District covering an area of 76,880 ha, and withdrawal of the most significant land in mixed gardens surrounding an area of 58,859 ha. In addition, there was additional weaponry on steep slopes (15 -30%) covering an area of 38,503 ha and a protected area of 16,505 ha by converting the use of forest land ..."
