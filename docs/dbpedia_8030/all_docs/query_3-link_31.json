Make that love. Impossible not to love.\n\nI don’t know what else to say at the moment, except for one thing.\n\nA strange thing; a thread that connected us.\n\nI read Mal’s LIFE: AN EXPLODED DIAGRAM only after taking him on as a client. Before that, I knew nothing of the book’s contents.\n\nMal, like me, had grown up in a remote part of Norfolk. LIFE is probably the most autobiographical of all his works, and it is set there.\n\nAs I read it, I became aware that one of the book’s characters – minor, but significant in plot terms – could only have been my own long-dead father.\n\nWe had dinner. He confirmed that the art teacher he had so deftly defined was indeed my father.\n\nI don’t know what the chances of that happening are – impossible to calculate.\n\nBut there it was: a bond, a thread of connection. Now undone.\n\nOr maybe not.\n\nI want to say more, but that’s it for me today. My thoughts now are with Mal’s family who, like the rest of us, have been untimely robbed of a great soul.\n\nThis has been a difficult day.
