        "text": "Othello\n\nDigital text from Folger Shakespeare Library; The Folger Library Shakespeare Editions, on which the Folger Digital Texts depend, make this editorial process as nearly transparent as is possible, in contrast to older texts, like the Moby™, which hide editorial interventions.\n\nBecause the Folger Digital Texts are edited in accord with twenty-first century knowledge about Shakespeare’s texts, the Folger here provides them to readers, scholars, teachers, actors, directors, and students, free of charge, confident of their quality as texts of the plays and pleased to be able to make this contribution to the study and enjoyment of Shakespeare.\n\nOthello - intro and audio clip\n\n\"The audio clip available here is a 1959 Royal Shakespeare Company performance with African-American actor Paul Robeson (1898-1976) playing Othello. Robeson was the first black actor since 1860 to perform the role in a major production. As the son of an escaped slave, he knew racism and prejudice, and his outspoken left-wing politics saw him victimized by the US's anti-Communist authorities and media of the 1950s.\""
