We are the world&#39;s leading pure-play coffee and tea company, with local roots dating back over two centuries: In 1753 in Joure, the Netherlands, Egberts Douwe founded his first coffee outlet.

Responsibly sourcing coffee means addressing problems on the ground to create real impact, whether that’s improved yields for farmers or reduced deforestation. In short, better outcomes for people and planet. Laurent shared some thoughts on our approach at the recent #IdeasFest held by FoodDrinkEurope in Brussels. Listen here & learn more about our #JDEPeetsCommonGrounds program at https://lnkd.in/eaPzzufQ www.jdepeets.com\n\nHummingbird Coffee, one of our leading brands in New Zealand (NZ), has brought new life to areas of Christchurch affected by the 2011 earthquake 🌳 Hummingbird, a homegrown Christchurch brand, partnered with a NZ charity called The Green Lab to support the creation of the Te Kohanga Taiao Sensory Nature Play Park in the Avon-Ōtākaro Forest Park, now open to the public. The park brought a deserted residential area in Christchurch back to life, having been part of the original ‘red zone’ devastated by the earthquake. The project also champions sustainability by using recycled materials and eco-friendly practices. In addition to Hummingbird’s financial support, volunteers from JDE Peet's NZ rolled up their sleeves to make this vision a reality, alongside civil society and members of the community. At JDE Peet's we believe it is our responsibility to bring people together, and we're proud to see our brands like Hummingbird Coffee making such a difference in local communities. #JDEPeets #HummingbirdCoffee #JDEPeetsCommonGrounds\n\n🎉 MOCCONA: Celebrating 70 Years of Coffee Magic!

At JDE Peet's we are taking an end-to-end sustainability approach, working with our partners along the supply chain, in our efforts to reduce emissions and waste as we strive towards a planet-positive future. It was great to see our own Simon Fox, who leads our efforts to minimise our environmental footprint — a key pillar of our Common Grounds programme — take to the edie stage to speak with other industry leaders on how we're addressing this next stage of our sustainability journey. Simon focused on how unlocking solutions to a net-zero value chain requires two main things: 🤝 Collaboration: working together and taking an inclusive approach to reduce risk in our value chain 🌱 Systemic Change: supporting farmers to become more climate resilient, improving their incomes while improving sustainable growing practices. For more information on our Common Grounds strategy, visit our website: https://lnkd.in/eVZjswzK #JDEPeetsCommonGrounds\n\nLed by our vision to provide a coffee or tea for every cup, we continue to expand our product lines, enhance quality and tap into new market segments. This means you can enjoy a cup from one of our brands no matter where you are in the world and whatever your taste preference is. This vision is reflected in our largest brand, JACOBS, who is dedicated to delivering only the best impeccable coffee for all and truly offers a coffee for every cup. In response to evolving consumer preferences, JACOBS is intensifying its focus on whole bean coffee, which has emerged as the fastest-growing segment in the coffee market. Offering a new portfolio of redesigned coffee blends in a new elevated packaging design linked to the codes of Whole Beans, JACOBS looks to excite consumers with a flavour profile for every taste Whether instant or ground coffee, whole beans or herbal teas – we believe it’s amazing what can happen over a cup of coffee or tea. #JDEPeetsCoffee #Coffee #Jacobs\n\nOn the ground in the South of Minas region, Brazil, we have been rolling out a groundbreaking initiative in partnership with coffee exporter Comexim Ltda and a local university. This project is aimed at enhancing the well-being of coffee farmers and collaborating to adopt more sustainable practices and promote reforestation. Hear from some of the people involved in this short video, and find the full video on our YouTube channel: https://lnkd.in/euWhdrcz About the project: 600 farmers, including 200 women and 121 young farmers benefit from the project and take part in activities such as: 🔹 Training farmers on water conservation, sustainable agricultural practices, and safe use of agrochemicals 🔹 Installing biodigesters for sewage treatment, benefiting 100 households 🔹 Promoting reforestation by distributing and planting 4,000 native tree seedlings 🔹 Conducting water quality analysis and environmental education with local youth and schools The expected outcomes: ☑️ Improved sanitation and environmental practices in farming communities ☑️ Enhanced agricultural productivity and sustainability ☑️ Greater community involvement and awareness in environmental conservation #JDEPeetsPlanet #JDEPeetsCommonGrounds #Coffee\n\nIt’s amazing what can happen over a cup of coffee! We recently celebrated the official opening of the OldTown Heritage Centre in Ipoh, where guests can enjoy a coffee while exploring Malaysian white coffee history and heritage and the work of local artists. The centre is a testament to our commitment to preserving and showcasing Malaysia's cultural legacy. It offers visitors an immersive journey through the evolution of coffee culture, from its humble beginnings to its modern-day prominence. This new space also includes a farm-to-fork café, featuring sustainable practices such as water and energy conservation, recycling, food waste composting, turning used cooking oil to biofuel usage and more.

That’s the #FoodFuture we see for coffee! We were proud to take part in the annual FoodDrinkEurope Ideas Fest in Brussels, where we had the chance to share how we see the future of sustainable coffee at JDE Peet’s with European policymakers and members of the European policymaking community interested in a more sustainable food chain. Thanks to everyone who participated in our workshop, joined the talk by our VP Sustainability Laurent Alexandre Sagarra, and enjoyed our coffees and teas throughout the day! #JDEPeetsCommonGrounds #EU #JDEPeetsPlanet"
