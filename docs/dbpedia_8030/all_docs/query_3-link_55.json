        "text": "MY OPINION:\n\nThe book, Keeper, is a classic rags to riches story where the main character is a destitute child who gradually rises to fame and fortune with the help of a mentor. The story grabs readers’ attention with its interesting storyline. There are unpleasant events that the main character faces, and there are exciting moments. However, it sometimes becomes repetitive because it mentions every detail about how the main character trains and plays soccer. For me, the book was unchallenging to comprehend because most of the time, the author chooses to use simple vocabulary. The book has a few adult words, and because of its straightforward language, I would recommend this book for the ages thirteen and fourteen. The author uses a plethora of literary terms such as foreshadowing, imagery, figurative language, and personification. As a result, Keeper can aid its readers in helping them recognize literary expressions. Overall, I would rate this book seven out of ten stars.\n\nSTUDY QUESTIONS AND VOCABULARY:\n\nFIRST SECTION\n\n1. What is the setting of the story based on clues given by the author?\n\n1a.
