        "text": "The director of the children’s programme at the Edinburgh international book festival is worried. According to Janet Smythe: “Young adult (YA) fiction, the major publishing creation of the last decade, means many readers will never experience some wonderful writing.” Perhaps she’s right. Perhaps all those MAAs (middle-aged adults) and OAs (older adults) do feel all those major publishing creations aren’t for them. But I’m not worried about adult-adults missing out on YA fiction in the slightest.\n\nFigures from Nielsen show that 80% of YA literature is read by people over 25. It’s a pretty astonishing and, to me, disturbing statistic. It strongly suggests that something has gone horribly wrong in publishing. (And, possibly, with those readers ...) Most people involved in publishing YA books would claim that these are intended to be read by teenagers. If this figure is correct, then they are missing that target. By decades. And that’s important, because many children stop reading when they reach the teenage years - especially boys. The world, it seems, suddenly holds pleasures greater than losing yourself in a great book. Could this be because the books that should belong to them, inhabiting their hearts and brains, are actually (consciously or subconsciously) directed at older readers?\n\nA little history. It’s possible to trace back literature pitched explicitly at teenagers to Margaret Daly’s Seventeenth Summer, written in 1942. The term “young adult” was coined in the 1960s for the US library system, looking for a pigeonhole to place books like this and SE Hinton’s The Outsiders. From there the expansion of the term was slow but steady. Until the 1990s, children’s publishers tended to use “teen fiction” to describe books aimed at 11- to 14-year-olds, and YA for 14+. At some time in the noughties this shifted again, with YA taking over the whole teen spectrum.\n\nAnd this change in terminology has been accompanied by a transformation in the nature of the books produced. Writers began to produce fiction that transcended a narrow age restriction. This includes some of the very finest living novelists, irrespective of genre - writers such as Meg Rosoff and Mal Peet and Patrick Ness. There are other, less well-known writers who are equally good. I have recently read books by Faye Bird, Jo Nadin and Martin Stewart that did everything I want great literature to do, to enthral and delight and ravish the imagination.\n\nSo what’s the problem? Well, I’d contend that at least some of these books appeal to me, as an adult, because they are not teenage books at all. They are adult fiction. The themes, the style, often even the characters belong in the world of adult literature. It is just some quirk of publishing that has left them washed up on the YA shore. For example, Mal Peet’s masterpiece, Life: An Exploded Diagram, was simply the best novel I read in 2011. It should have been up for the Booker prize. It was published as YA because Mal had always been published as YA.\n\nAlongside these many fine novels there is plenty of dross. As with most areas of publishing, YA follows the 90% rule. And much YA is a lazy, disheartening mush of false problems, fake solutions, idealised romance, second-rate fantasy, tired dystopias. Easy to read; easy to forget.\n\nBut my main concern isn’t with quality. For me, the problem is that a huge amount of theoretically teenage publishing is churning out books that simply aren’t for teenagers at all. And that must mean, given the finite opportunities for new books, that “real” teenage books aren’t getting published.\n\nIt seems an odd state of affairs. So what’s behind it? The underlying reasons are hugely complex, but I’d like to identify three:\n\nWriters. Many writers hate the idea that they are writing “for” a particular audience. They like the idea that their books are somehow universal. They also subscribe to the idea that a work of art is a solitary, internal process, like laying an egg. The egg they produce is a reflection of their own, adult tastes.\n\nEditors. Many of the editors are exactly in the over-25 demographic who love adult-oriented YA. Indeed, many of them write it. These are cultured, intelligent people, who love books, but it would be surprising if there weren’t a bias in favour of the kind of books they themselves love.\n\nPublicists/bloggers. Publicists at publishers have very limited budgets. One free source of publicity is the vibrant blogging community. The YA bloggers are almost all adults. They favour a particular type of YA novel.\n\nBut what should we do about it? The last thing I would want is for the many wonderful writers of YA not to get published. All we need to do is classify them honestly and openly as adult writers. This will free up valuable publishing space for teen writers, for novelists who are interested in writing as a communicative act, a conversation between the reader and writer. And that means focusing on the readers - the teenage readers that YA fiction doesn’t serve - finding a language to engage and entertain them, a literature that talks about their lives, their hopes, their fears and their dreams.\n\n— guardian.co.uk (c) Guardian News & Media Ltd, 2016"
