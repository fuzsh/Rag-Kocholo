        "text": "Life: An Exploded Diagram by Mal Peet is one of the best books I’ve read this year.\n\nIf I’m honest, I wasn’t initially attracted to the book when it came out (2011) because the plot features the Cuban Missile Crisis and I just thought, “boring.” I’ve got a problem with making untrue snap decisions about books.\n\nClem Ackroyd, our central character, lives with his parents and grandmother in a claustrophobic home too small to accommodate their larger-than-life characters in the bleak Norfolk countryside.\n\nLife takes us from intimate moments in a teenage boy’s life to the world stage and back again with ease.\n\nWe’re off to school with Clem and his mate, we’re picking strawberries in the blazing sun of the English countryside, we’re scoping out new places for make out sessions… then we’re in JFK’s war room, part of the Cuban Missile Crisis, flying high about the Arctic avoiding radar, we’re part of 9/11…\n\nI’m almost strictly a reader of contemporary fiction so don’t often find myself in war rooms and Presidential ponderings. These, like the Cuban Missile Crisis seem to be the fodder of the non-fiction set, which is something I’m typically not. However, despite my initial reservations I found myself enjoying the American history and politics enormously. In fact, I would hazard to say I enjoyed that more than the domestic settings I’m usually fonder of.\n\nWhen I was 16 I was an exchange student to USA (rather sadly it was me who was top of my American Government class) and Life took me back there. I remembered how much I love American history and found the side comments about JFK’s medical history and personal predilections fascinating. In fact, I’d now be really keen to read a biography of JFK so please recommend me one in the comments.\n\nLife is a book about the importance of events – about how it’s the ordinary, everyday, often (long-term) unforgettable lives that we lead that shape us far more than the recorded events of history that time tells us are important.\n\nThe juxtaposition of these world stage events with Clem’s everyday life is what makes Life: An Exploded Diagram so special and memorable. Because while world events will be remembered for all time as the events that have shaped and reshaped our world, in the face of personal discovery they’re all just background noise.\n\nWhat really matters to us as individuals are the events and effects of our own, tiny lives. Village life, our family, plans for a brighter future, a first, true love – all seem so massively effective and important – arguably even more so if you’re a teenager like Clem.\n\nIn Life, Clem’s life changes irrevocably when he meets Frankie, the daughter of a wealthy farmer, and experiences first love, in all its pain and glory. The first rush of love is thrilling and exciting and even better, clandestine. Anyone who has fallen in love as a teenager (and who didn’t) knows theirs alone is the greatest love story of all time.\n\nThroughout Life the story is told in flashback by Clem and moves from the past of his parents and grandmother to his own teenage years. I found the change of tense and narrative styles as we moved through time thrilling. Each character is so well developed and seems so large and important to the book that it’s hard to believe they don’t really exist.\n\nAlthough I finished reading Life a good few weeks ago it’s a book I’ve often reflected on since.\n\nIt’s a bit like John Lennon wrote in his song Beautiful Boy (Darling Boy), “Life is what happens to you/ While you’re busy making other plans.”\n\nA five star read.\n\nDon’t just take my word for it though – here’s my friend Courtney’s review.\n\nReviewed by Emma McCleary"
