        "text": "Title: Good Boy\n\nAuthor: Mal Peet\n\nIllustrator: Emma Shoard\n\nPublisher: Barrington Stoke\n\nPublication date: 15 March 2019\n\nGenre: YA novella\n\nPages: 88\n\nI read Mal Peet’s writing for the first time last year when Barrington Stoke kindly sent me a copy of The Family Tree, a beautiful novella about family and memories. I loved it, so naturally I jumped at the chance to review Good Boy, Barrington Stoke’s latest collaboration between Mal Peet and illustrator Emma Shoard.\n\nI am thrilled to be sharing my review today alongside a preview of some of Emma Shoard’s fantastic artwork. Be sure to let me know what you think in the comments!\n\nGood Boy is a short novella with a huge impact. It begins with the nightmare that haunts Sandie, a hulking, snarling black dog that pursues her endlessly. For years, the monster was kept at bay by her lovely pet dog, Rabbie, but now Sandie has grown up and Rabbie has sadly died… and the black dog is more real than ever before.\n\nIn a fascinating examination of what it is to be afraid, Mal Peet’s writing proves that he understood the intelligence of teen readers and their willingness to engage with complex emotions and experiences. Never patronising, it does so much in such a small space; every word of this striking novella has been chosen with precision.\n\nGood Boy keeps us guessing right to the final page (and beyond!) and I love how this is reflected in Emma’s haunting illustrations. There is ambiguity everywhere. You are left guessing in the darkness – what’s that there among the shadows? Did you see something? Or was that just your imagination?\n\nGood Boy is particularly suitable for struggling, reluctant or dyslexic readers aged 14+, but I would recommend this to teens and adults alike as an illuminating examination of fear and anxiety. The quote from Frank Cottrell Boyce really sums it up: “There are many writers who can take you inside a nightmare. It takes Mal Peet to show you the way back out.”\n\nI received this book free from the publishers in exchange for an honest review. Thank you, Barrington Stoke!"
