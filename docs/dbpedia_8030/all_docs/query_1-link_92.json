        "text": "This has been sitting on my \"to be read\" for quite a while, and I'm so glad I finally came around to it. It's a thrilling novel about jealousy, friendship and conscience.\n\nAfter having stolen a manuscript from her now dead friend and having published it under her own, racially ambiguous name, June lives in a constant hunt between her own conscience and the dreaded revelation by outsiders.\n\nIt's a great example of the unreliable narrator as the reader only gets to know June's own thoughts, and she's great at justifying herself. It's a book that will keep you own your toes because you're constantly required not to forget to make your own judgement of things.\n\nReady for a little visit to a japanese bookshop? This is the right place for anyone who wants to escape from everyday life and is looking for something think about. A wonderful collection of stories that was deservedly nominated for the Japanese Bookseller Award.\n\nHarriet and Wyn didn't really think their plan through and now they have to hide the truth from their friends. Pretending to still be in a relationship is harder than they thought. Especially when there are hidden feelings involved.\n\nFollow their journey and fall in love with their \"Happy Place\". But be aware: You might need a box of tissues right beside you at all times, while reading this book.\n\nNora is done with life...in the Midnight Library she has the unique chance to try out all her different lives by undoing one regret. Which one will she choose to live hence forward?\n\nA magical what-if novel that speaks to everyone, because we have all asked ourselves at least once: \"What if\"?.\n\nEasily one of the best books I've read this year.\n\nAt the age of 8, Alice begins to see other people's emotions in the form of colourful auras surrounding them. As we follow Alice on her life's journey it is clear that her ability can be a gift and a curse.\n\nI applaud Ahern's capability to take you through the whole spectrum of emotions and the brilliant character building she did with Alice.\n\nA captivating story filled with fantasy, high stakes and love. A human girl finds herself in a magical world where she faces many dangerous obstacles and needs to fight not only for her survival, but also for the inhabitants of Prythian. Loosely inspired by the elements of the story \"The Beauty and The Beast\", Sarah J. Maas has written a fantastic story which leaves the reader wanting to learn more about Feyre's journey and the characters the reader encounters throughout the story.\n\nThis book is definitely worth the hype! Although sceptical at first, unsure if it would live up to my expectations, I ended up giving a 5-star rating and even shed a tear or two at the end. Following a group of 4 college freinds as they navigate their way through life, Yanagihara lets us experience what true friendship and suffering are like. Every single page is beautifully written and encapsulating. This is a story that will stay with you forever."
