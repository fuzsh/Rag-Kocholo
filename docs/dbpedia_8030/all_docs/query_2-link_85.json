        "text": "There were many requests in the comment thread of my last post to list the titles and authors of my swag. Okay, I’m listing them. But remember, they’re mine, all mine! Bwah-hah, etc.\n\nPlus, most of these books don’t come out till autumn.\n\nAnd for a screen-filling, monster-huge version of this photo, click here.\n\nTOP ROW FROM LEFT\n\nThe Penalty by Mal Peet\n\nYA set in Brazil, about a soccer prodigy. I’ve heard good things about Peet.\n\n13 Bullets by David Wellington\n\nSplatterpunk vampire novel, by the author of the online zombie apocalypse novel Monster Island, which was cool.\n\nShinjuku Shark by Arimasa Osawa\n\nHardboiled detective in Tokyo. Adult themes!\n\nThe World Without Us by Alan Weisman\n\nNon-fic about what would happen to Earth if all humans disappeared instantly right now. Like, how long it would take everything to go back to a pre-technology state. I am so reading this, if only so my next zombie apocalypse novel has good science.\n\nPoseur by Rachel Maude\n\nThree girls start their own fashion label. A very pink book.\n\nZugzwang by Ronan Bennet\n\nA chess thriller (?) set in 1914. That’s the same time period as Leviathan, so it’s a must-read for me.\n\nThe Scandal of the Season by Sophie Gee\n\nAn affair in 1711 London, by an Aussie writer who Justine adores. And yes, nice cover.\n\nI repeat the swag photo, for ease of use. (And again, for a screen-filling, monster-huge version of this photo, click here.)\n\nMIDDLE ROW FROM LEFT\n\nDeadline by Chris Crutcher\n\nA teen has one year to live. Crutcher rocks.\n\nFoundling by D.M. Cornish\n\nLavishly illustrated Book 1 of Monster Blood Tattoo series.\n\nThe Asbolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian by Sherman Alexie\n\nYA about a Native-American teen who wants to become a writer.\n\nBetwixt by Tara Bray Smith\n\nYA supernatural about kids with gnarly powers.\n\nBoy Toy by Barry Lyga\n\nBy the guy who wrote The Amazing Adventures of Fanboy and Gothgirl, so should be really good.\n\nElectric Church by Jeff Somers\n\nHardboiled cyberpunk.\n\nGrub by Elise Blackwell\n\nA parody of the publishing world. Can’t wait.\n\nI repeat the swag photo, for ease of use. (And again, for a screen-filling, monster-huge version of this photo, click here.)\n\nBOTTOM ROW FROM LEFT\n\nLittle (Grrl) Lost by Charles De Lint\n\nSmall visitor in 14-year-old girl’s life. Love De Lint.\n\nShojo Beat 3\n\nA manga compilation.\n\nShonen Jump 2007\n\nAnother manga compilation.\n\nChibi Vampire by Yuna Kagesaki\n\nVampire manga!\n\nChain Mail by Hiroshi Ishikazi\n\nSee previous post.\n\nAvalon High by Meg Cabot\n\nA working document of the upcoming manga version of her series. It starts out in real art, changes to pencil sketches, then is just a rough script. Kewl object to own.\n\nApollo’s Song by Osamu Tezuka\n\nManga from the Astro Boy dude."
