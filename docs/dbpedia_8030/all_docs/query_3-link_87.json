        "text": "The extraordinary debut novel by Carnegie Medal-winning author Mal Peet about football, magic and self-discovery.\n\nThe award-winning first novel from Carnegie Medal-winning Mal Peet introduces legendary sports journalist Paul Faustino and the haunting tale of the world's greatest goalkeeper: the man they call El Gato,\"the Cat\". As Paul interviews El Gato, the World Cup stands on the table between them. In the hours that follow, El Gato tells his incredible story – how he, a poor logger's son, learns to become a World Cup-winning goalkeeper so good he is almost unbeatable. And the most remarkable part of this story is the man who teaches him: the mysterious Keeper, who haunts a football pitch at the heart of the claustrophobic rainforest...\n\nPhysical, spiritual – Arthurian, even – this is true enchantment. TES Teacher\n\nTense and atmospheric [...] refreshing original story in which footballing familiars are shot through with curious and satisfying magical realism.
