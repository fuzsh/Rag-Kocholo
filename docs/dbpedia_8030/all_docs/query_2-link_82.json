        "text": "One author\n\nGive the author's name and the year of publication. If the author's name is stated in the sentence, always place the year in parentheses immediately after the name.\n\n(Clark, 2019).\n\nClark's (2019) study shows that . . .\n\nTwo authors\n\nGive both names separated by the wordand when including the names in the text of a sentence. For citations in parentheses use an ampersand (&).\n\nFlannigan and McBride (2018) state the results...\n\n(Flannigan & McBride, 2018).\n\nThree or more authors\n\nGive the first author's last name followed by et al.\n\n(ALL citations) Sawyer et al. (2010)...\n\nOR\n\n(ALL citations) (Sawyer et al., 2010).\n\nIf the first author's name and the years of publications are the same for several references, include enough additional co-author names to eliminate ambiguity. Include a comma after the last name.\n\n(Martinez, Fuentes, et al., 2016).\n\n(Martinez, Aguilar, et al., 2016).\n\nMultiple works by the same author\n\nFor works published in the same year by the same author, add alphabetic designators to the year in both the in-text reference and reference list.\n\n(Anderson, 2003a, 2003b).\n\nFor works published in different years by the same author, place years in chronological sequence separated by commas.\n\n(McBride, 2003, 2007).\n\nMultiple works by the same authorand the same year\n\nWhen multiple references have an identical author (or authors or the in-text citation shortens to the same author) and the same publication year or no publication year, include a lowercase letter after the year in the reference list and in each in-text citation. When you have no date add a hyphen before the lowercase letters. Assign the letters according to the order of the references in your reference list. List references alphabetically by the first word after the date element when the authors and the dates match.\n\n(Carlson, 2022a).\n\n(Carlson, 2022b).\n\n(Carlson & Waters, 2022a).\n\n(Carlson et al., 2023c).\n\n(University of Miami, n.d.-a).\n\n(University of Miami, n.d.-b).\n\nAuthors with the same surname\n\nWhen authors of 2 works published in the same year have the same surname, include the initials of the author in the in-text citation and separate the names by a semicolon and space. When using initials in the text of a sentence do not invert the first name.\n\nJ. Dawson (1986) and T. Dawson (1986) accept the...\n\n(Dawson, J., 1986; Dawson, T., 1986)\n\nOrganizations as authors\n\nIf an organizational author is referenced only once or twice in a document, the full organizational name is acceptable. A shortened form can be used in the in-text reference if the organization has a familiar abbreviation. If using an abbreviated name for an organization, spell out the full name the first time referenced and give the abbreviation.\n\nFIRST citation National Library of Medicine (NLM, 2015)...\n\nNLM (2015) started...\n\nOR\n\nFIRST citation (National Library of Medicine [NLM], 2015).\n\n(NLM, 2015).\n\nWorks without authors\n\nBegin the in-text reference with the first word or first few words of the title, followed by a comma (a lengthy title may be shortened). Titles of an article, chapter or web page should be placed in double quotation marks. Titles of a periodical, book, report, or brochure should be italicized.\n\nARTICLE title (\"A New Deal,\" 2003).\n\nBOOK title (The Open Box, 1823).\n\nLONG book title (Handbook of Geriatric, 2000).\n\nReference: Handbook of geriatric drug therapy. (2000). Springhouse.\n\nWorks with Anonymous listed as author\n\nWhen a title lists the author of a work as Anonymous give the word Anonymous as the author's name in-text and in the reference list. Do not use the term Anonymous for works without authors listed.\n\nAnonymous (1983) said...\n\n(Anonymous, 1983).\n\nPlace the abbreviation n.d. (for no date) in place of the year for in-text citations and the reference list.\n\nBrigmeyer (n.d.) associates...\n\n(Brigmeyer, n.d.).\n\nWorks without Pagination (when using a direct quote)\n\nUse the abbreviation para. to indicate a numbered paragraph rather than a page number.\n\nHorowitz (2011) says, \"those who...\" (para. 3).\n\nHe says, \"those who...\" (Horowitz, 2011, para. 3).\n\nOR\n\nWhen no page numbers or paragraph numbers are present, use a heading title and the number of the paragraph after the heading. Click here to see the sample reference below.\n\nKona (2010) says of George Carlin's humor that, \"comedy is a disguise for unmasking other faces\" (\"The Carlinesque in George Carlin,\" para 2).\n\nThe author likens George Carlin's humor to \"a disguise for unmasking other faces\" (Kona, 2010, \"The Carlinesque of George Carlin,\" para. 2).\n\nPersonal communications\n\nPersonal communications (interviews, e-mail correspondence, lectures, etc.) should be used sparingly. When citing personal communications only cite this material in text, do not include personal communication citations in the reference list. They are excluded from the reference list because this is unrecoverable data. Give the name of the speaker and the exact date.\n\nA. M. Raulson (personal communication, January 28, 2020) says...\n\n(T. J. Mavin, personal communication, April 15, 2019).\n\nSecondary Sources\n\nSometimes you need to reference an idea using secondhand knowledge. This should be done rarely, it is always better to read the original work to get the most objective meaning. You ALWAYS cite the material you have in front of you, never use another author's references to cite material you have not accessed. When a work is out of print or hard to find, you may wish to use that author's idea in your paper. You need to give credit to the original author/thinker, but you cite the material you found it in, this way the reader can find the material as well. If you reference an out of print/hard to find item, your reader will not be able to find the same material.\n\nRawlings said (as cited in Belleville, 2006, p. 8), \"we need above all...a certain remoteness from urban confusion.\"\n\nIn the reference list cite the work YOU read:\n\nBelleville, B. (2006). Losing it all to sprawl: How progress ate my cracker landscape. Gainesville, FL: University Press of Florida.\n\nDirect Quotations\n\nDirect quotes should be used sparingly in any research paper. Use direct quotes to emphasize a particularly original turn of phrase or when technical lingo does not allow for proper rephrasing. When directly quoting, enclose the entire quote in quotation marks, copy the original wording exactly, and provide a page/line/paragraph number (when available).\n\nMoffett (2010) goes into great detail about the predatory and army-like nature of a colony of ants ensnaring its meal, \"the more the worm or grasshopper struggles, the more the masses converge on it...all the little ant jaws hold their prey taut\" (p.39).\n\nBlock quotations are direct quotations that contain 40 words or more. When quoting more than 40 words, do not use quotation marks; instead, set off the direct quote starting it on a new line and indenting a half inch from the margin.\n\nThe authors categorize chronic neck pain,\n\nwhen symptoms are present for 3 or more months, with either recurrent (multiple episodes separated by\n\nperiods of recovery) or persistent (no periods of recovery) pain. Strong evidence suggests that biomechanical factors,\n\nincluding repetitive movements, prolonged computer use, and poor workstation design, are associated with\n\nthe development of neck pain. (Bruflat et al., 2012, p. 1349)\n\nMultiple Citations by the Same Author in One Paragraph\n\nSometimes you might use the same source of information for an entire paragraph. In this case, you do not need to reference the author and year at the end of each sentence. You would want to provide the full in-text citation at the beginning and the end of the paragraph, but the sentences in between can reference just the author or organization. If you place the author's name in parentheses, then provide the year too."
