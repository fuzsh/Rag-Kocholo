        "text": "A quick summary of the book: Clem Ackroyd is born in Norfolk during a 1945 air-raid. We get to know him and the history of his family, and then as the story moves on to the summer of 1962, Clem, strawberry-picking in the fields, gets to know Frankie. Frankie is gorgeous – and the daughter of the landowner (and Clem’s father’s boss). The two begin a secret class-crossed relationship, making furtive phone calls and meeting in an abandoned barn. Meanwhile, on the far side of the Atlantic, tensions rise as the Cuban Missile Crisis unfolds. Talk of nuclear civil defence comes to Norfolk, and Clem starts to think about the end of the world as an imminent possibility. Two questions, “when will the Bomb drop” and “will I die a virgin”, sit side-by-side.\n\nI first read Life: An Exploded Diagram in December 2011, awarding it five stars and naming it my favourite book of that year. In August 2012, less than a year later, I read it for the second time, then returned to it for a third time in July 2013 (a story with strawberry-picking in it has to be a summer book really). This year marks the fourth time I’ve read it, and I’m so pleased it still packs a punch. The book is marketed as YA and centred on teenage characters, but is a fantastic novel deserving of a wider readership.\n\nThis book is brilliant. [. . .] This is real life, or at least, life then. [. . .] While there is love in this story, it is not [just] a love story, and similarly for war. It’s simply life, told beautifully”\n\nA somewhat saccharine review from my teenage self back in 2011.\n\nThe book is narrated by an older Clem, who looks back on the events, providing the occasional bit of foreshadowing and creating continuity between the passages of biography and history. For me, this older, wiser perspective is one of the things that keeps a story about teenagers relevant and engaging for an adult audience. The “exploded diagram” of the title is a reference to Clem’s profession as an artist: he draws pictures which show the component parts of something. His interest in structure, “the way things fit together (and come to pieces)”, also comes through in the careful structuring of the narrative, and in the kind of observations Clem makes.\n\nA little bit of literary analysis:\n\nThe book’s core themes of violence, conflict, and anticipation are visible from the outset. The story begins in Norfolk in March 1945, with the WWII home front to the fore:\n\nRuth Ackroyd was in the garden checking the rhubarb when the RAF Spitfire accidentally shot her chimney-pot to bits. The shock of it brought the baby on three weeks early.\n\n‘I was expectun,’ she’d often say, over the years. ‘But I wunt expectun that.'”\n\nMal Peet, Life: An Exploded Diagram (2011).\n\nClem is born against a background of conflict and violence. Birth is the first milestone event in a person’s life – tying this to conflict sets up a pattern in Clem’s life, which is punctuated by similarly explosive moments over the course of the book. In his narration, the older Clem reveals that he blames his “life-long dislike of surprises and loud noises” on the circumstances of his birth. This passage also reflects a detail from the novel’s historical context: fear of attack from the skies was a lasting impact of WWII aerial bombing, influencing perceptions of conflict in Britain well after the war had ended, and feeding into the Cold War fear of a nuclear bomb dropping from the sky.\n\nThroughout, characters spend time waiting for – expecting – one thing or another: the apocalypse, a phone call, a sexual encounter, the start of the school term, nuclear war, an incoming tide, an important appointment. Ruth’s pregnancy is a time of expectation which comes to an abrupt end “three weeks early”, something echoed by the rhubarb she grows, which we discover is “forced” (kept in the dark to accelerate its natural growth process and make it ready sooner). Our own sense of timing can’t be relied upon, these lines suggest, and anticipation won’t end the way we imagined it would.\n\nSome more quotations:\n\nall through that summer, while Frankie and I sought secret places to explore each other, Soviet men and armaments were being smuggled into Cuba”\n\nMal Peet, Life: An Exploded Diagram. p201\n\nTime stops for no man – and neither do big history or geopolitics. Conversely, at the same time as any major event, there are millions of tiny events which make up everyday life for ordinary people. Sometimes we notice the impact of one upon the other and sometimes we’re oblivious.\n\nIt seriously cheeses me off when some bloke called Wankstaff stands there and tells me that all I have to do is lie down and pull my jacket over my head and then carry on as normal. ‘Cos we are gone, comrade, when the Bomb goes off. Gone.”\n\nMal Peet, Life: An Exploded Diagram. p302\n\nClem’s friend Goz is sceptical about the government’s unscientific and naively optimistic approach to nuclear civil defence. Seems familiar, somehow. Elsewhere in the narration, we’re reminded that the strategy of Mutually Assured Destruction “depends upon powerful people being sane”. Quite.\n\nSimilar books include:\n\nThe somewhat grim The Burning Book (1984) by Maggie Gee is a novel about how a family’s history and their ordinary lives in Britain are brought to an abrupt end by nuclear apocalypse. With experimental passages and sections based on the testimonies of Hiroshima survivors, this is certainly not conventionally beautiful like Peet’s novel, but it covers similar anxieties and makes for powerful “discomfort reading”.\n\nBridge of Clay (2018) by Markus Zusak, a book about family, history, and loyalty, with some passages which reflect on the impact of big history on ordinary lives, a theme in Life: An Exploded Diagram. You can read my post about Zusak’s fiction, including my comments on Bridge of Clay here.\n\nOne Day (2009) by David Nicholls, another love story which makes great use of structure – it’s an episodic narrative following two people on one anniversary through the years. You can read Nicholls describing how the book came to be in this article from the Guardian.\n\nIf the passages from Life: An Exploded Diagram retelling the history of the Cuban Missile Crisis were the ones that gripped you, you might be interested in The 2020 Commission Report on the North Korean Nuclear Attacks Against the United States (2018) by Jeffrey Lewis, a speculative narrative imagining how the Trump presidency would have reacted to a nuclear attack. It’s packed with facts, and perhaps consequently a little dry at times, but still fascinating. I stuck this book in my 2020 New Year recommendations post – alas, I imagine it will read rather differently in the knowledge of Trump’s handling of the real Covid-19 crisis.\n\nIf you’ve read Life: An Exploded Diagram and have other suggestions for similar books, do leave a comment – particularly if you know of more diverse books. I’ve other potential posts lined up which refer to Life: An Exploded Diagram, so if there’s a specific theme from the book you’d like to know more about, leave a question about that too!\n\nLinks correct as of 19th February 2021."
