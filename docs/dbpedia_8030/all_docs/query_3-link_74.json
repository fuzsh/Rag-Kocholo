        "text": "Keeper\n\nThe extraordinary debut novel by Carnegie Medal-winning author Mal Peet about football, magic and self-discovery. The award-winning first novel from Carnegie Medal-winning Mal Peet introduces legendary sports journalist Paul Faustino and the haunting tale of the world's greatest goalkeeper: the man they call El Gato,'the Cat'. As Paul interviews El Gato, the World Cup stands on the table between them. In the hours that follow, El Gato tells his incredible story - how he, a poor logger's son, learns to become a World Cup-winning goalkeeper so good he is almost unbeatable. And the most remarkable part of this story is the man who teaches him: the mysterious Keeper, who haunts a football pitch at the heart of the claustrophobic rainforest...\n\nMal Peet (Author), James Goode (Narrator)\n\nAudiobook\n\nPlay Sample Listen For Free\n\nTamar\n\nWinner of the Carnegie Medal, Tamar is Mal Peet's astonishing novel about love, lies and secrets in a time of war.

Out of the past, another Tamar emerges, a man involved in the terrifying world of resistance fighters in Nazi-occupied Holland half a century earlier. His story is one of passionate love, jealousy and tragedy set against the daily fear and casual horror of the Second World War. Unravelling it will transform the younger Tamar's life...\n\nMal Peet (Author), Anna Maxwell Martin, Anton Lesser (Narrator)\n\nAudiobook\n\nPlay Sample Listen For Free\n\nThe Penalty\n\nFootball, corruption and dark secrets collide in the thrilling sequel to the award-winning Keeper by Carnegie Medal-winning author Mal Peet.

Flat broke. His star has waned. No one wants his novels about sensitive teenage boys. So his ruthless agent, Minerva Cinch, convinces him that his only hope is to write a sword-and-sorcery blockbuster. High Fantasy, specifically, or, to be more precise, Phantasy with a p-h. Unfortunately, Philip-allergic to the faintest trace of anything Tolkien-is utterly unsuited to the task. In Philip's darkest, whiskey-fueled hour, a dwarfish stranger comes to his rescue. But the deal Philip makes with Pocket Wellfair turns out to have Faustian consequences. The Murdstone Trilogy is a richly black comedy from a writer without peer.\n\nMal Peet (Author), James Langton (Narrator)\n\nAudiobook\n\nPlay Sample Listen For Free\n\nLife\n\nClem, a working-class boy living in government-assisted housing, and Frankie, the daughter of a wealthy landowner, must keep their relationship secret. If it’s discovered, their world will be blown apart. But unknown to them, President John F. Kennedy and the Russian leader, Nikita Khruschev, are shaping up to do just that — blow the world apart - as the two leaders fight over a small island in the Caribbean Sea, leading up to the events that will later be known as the Cuban Missile Crisis. For Frankie and Clem, “time, like everything else, is against them.” In his most brilliant and ambitious novel yet, Mal Peet portrays the shattering power of love and the ricocheting effect of war through generations. “Witty, super-smart, heartbreakingly generous, it’s so good, you almost want to keep it a secret.” — Patrick Ness, author of the award-winning Chaos Walking series “Life: An Exploded Diagram is Mal Peet’s finest work to date, by turns hysterically funny, sad, poignant, bitter, and rude, but always with that unfakeable sense of deep truth.” — Anthony McGowan, author of The Knife That Killed Me “A new novel by Mal Peet is always something to be eagerly anticipated: finely drawn characters, ambitious storytelling, a broad historical canvas, piercing social critique — and now, much more than in previous novels, a delightfully irreverent streak of humor.” — Jonathan Hunt, blogger for School Library Journal’s Heavy Medal blog “An astonishingly engaging, wonderful, un-put-downable book. His gorgeous writing makes one reread sentences over and over again for the pure joy of experiencing the language.” — Carol Stoltz, Porter Square Books, Cambridge, MA\n\nMal Peet (Author), Simon Vance, Simon Vance (Narrator)\n\nAudiobook\n\nPlay Sample Listen For Free\n\nKeeper\n\nIn a small newspaper office in South America, Paul Faustino, a veteran sports reporter, begins an exclusive interview with El Gato, the World Cup-winning soccer phenom. Over the course of the long night, El Gato tells the story of how an unspectacular teenager in a poor logging town became the world's most accomplished goalkeeper. It is a tale filled with tension, hunger, and magic, set in a mythic corner of the jungle. But above all it is a tale about El Gato's ghostly, but very real mentor: the Keeper. \"A well-written, fast-paced sports story that addresses far more than just the sport itself.\" - School Library Journal \"This haunting tale is full of sports action. . . . An unusual and compelling story.\" - KLIATT\n\nMal Peet (Author), Christopher Lane (Narrator)\n\nAudiobook\n\nPlay Sample Listen For Free\n\nThe Penalty\n\nAs the city of San Juan pulses to summer's sluggish beat, its teenage soccer prodigy, El Brujito, the Little Magician, vanishes without a trace - right after he misses a penalty kick and loses a big game for his team. Paul Faustino, South America's top sports reporter, is reluctantly drawn into the mystery of the athlete's disappearance. As a story of corruption and murder unfolds, Faustino is forced to confront the bitter history of slavery and the power of the occult. A deftly woven mystery flush with soccer and suspense, this gripping novel is one that shouldn't be missed. From the award-winning author of TAMAR, a time-shifting thriller about a vanishing soccer star, occult secrets, and the dark history of slavery.\n\nMal Peet (Author), Christopher Lane (Narrator)\n\nAudiobook\n\nPlay Sample Listen For Free\n\nExposure\n\nOtello is South America's star soccer player and has just signed a deal to play for a team in the southern part of his country, a region with a history of racism toward black northerners like Otello.
