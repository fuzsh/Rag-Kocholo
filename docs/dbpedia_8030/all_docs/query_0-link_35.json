        "text": "April 25, 2008\n\nYou may think this book is predictable but you’re in for a rude awakening. Keeper is an amazing story told by “El Gato” himself and his story of the mysterious keeper. It is an excellent gratifying soccer adventure with drama. This book contains easy to read material but enjoyable. If you ever thought you weren’t able to do something then this book is an inspiring self confident motivating inspiration. This book will leave you with a jaw dropping surprise at the end.\n\nThe author portrays the characters well through out the story, they never change who they are just the way they look at themselves. The Keeper and El Gato have the passion for the game itself, Soccer. This book is about a young boy who finds himself no good for soccer. A friend of his helps him with his no good stills to only become the worlds best Goal Keeper. The book talks about the vulnerability of a keeper and an opponent, with great tips on how to read the game itself.\n\nThis Book has taught me how to look at field form a different perspective. I have learned many things but Keeper led me into the goalies mind. I enjoyed the book and gave me more confidence on how to challenge my self to be a better soccer player.\n\nJune 25, 2017\n\nI really enjoyed the mystical realism aspects of this book. It's a solid sports book that delves into the spirituality that many people experience with sports. I've re-read this book a few times since the first time I picked this up and I've enjoyed this as much each time. If you've ever been into soccer/football I definitely think this is a worth read.\n\nFebruary 28, 2012\n\nBefore I go into the details of this review I feel it ought to be said that I have been a football/soccer goalkeeper for just about 16 years now - come to think of it that's half of my life! I was browsing casually for football related literature and amidst the pool of typical football \"oldstar\" biographies \"Keeper\" by Mal Peet stood out.\n\nThe first thing I noticed about it was its fiction nature, the second that it was given the tagline of a \"book for adolescents\".\n\nTo my utmost shame I have to admit that the latter fact turned me off a little. So I merely made a mental note about \"Keeper\" and moved on.\n\nIt was only after adding it in Goodreads some one or two months later, and reviewing some of the reviews it had gotten, that I decided to actually get and read it.\n\nI learned that perhaps the only thing \"adolescent\" about \"Keeper\" is its length - 224 pages. The Book itself is a wonderful fictional read for any football enthusiast such as myself.\n\nThe story of the book revolves around the now greatest football goalkeeper of all times, El Gato, who after single-handedly winning the FIFA world cup for his team is meeting a popular south-american sports journalist to give an exclusive interview.\n\nThe narration alternates between a dialogue of the two men and a monologue by Gato whenever he recalls his life and how he came to be the man that he is today.\n\nIndeed El Gato has come a long way to be the grand sportsman that he is now. He confesses into the reporter that in order to become a great football player he had to actually give up on playing football first. When I read these words I was as confused as you may be now but those challenging words only serve to draw you into the story and the world of the Keeper.\n\n\"Keeper\" is an adventurous, at times very magical story about the coming-of-age that every human being experiences - and no two experiences of that kind are the same.\n\nWe learn about the childhood home of Gato in South America, a rain forest/jungle logging camp that serves as the home to the families of the men that work as loggers there. Mal Peet manages to describe both the forest and the loggers' work in a vivid, authentic way. It is hard work to cut the forest down, to push back nature on soil that has been claimed by it many, many years before Man has even set foot on it. As such the only respite there is for anyone in El Gato's home camp is football - the elderly watch football games on a small TV set together whenever they need not work and the younger ones do of course play football themselves: dusty and bare-feeted football games those are of course, there is nothing glamorous about it but it makes them happy for a while. And moments of happiness they need to fade out the cruel and hard working environment that is their logging camp. The children's football games, however, do not excite one young boy, one called El Cigueno, the stork and one who would eventually be called El Gato, the cat - the protagonist. Back then, and out of frustration over his lacking football skills, the boy one day wanders off into the rain forest on a route he's never taken before. To his surprise he ends up on a clearing in the middle of the forest, something very unusual, and even more unusual is the football goal that is on that makeshift football pitch. This is the place where a mysterious person appears, a (goal)keeper obviously, who takes it upon himself to mentor young El Cigueno and have him become El Gato, the world's greatest goalkeeper.\n\n\"Keeper\" was a complete joy to read. I realise that may be so because I'm a football addict, but still I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in sports.\n\nThe descriptions of the football play are action-packed and vividly narrated - you cannot help but re-enact the scenes inside the book in your head and it is so accurate it is astonishing. The emotions and thoughts going through El Gato's mind whenever he plays are surprisingly close to what I tend to feel and think during a game. I remember more than a few moments when I had a smile on my face while reading the book since it all called so close to home. The sports related narrations of the book are top-notch.\n\nThe mystery parts of the book are compelling as well, especially since they are closely related to the rain forest. That setting made everything that much more enigmatic for me. It was fairly obvious where the book was headed story wise but nevertheless I felt this never decreased my enjoyment of it. I believe that is due to the lyrical, perhaps even magical nature of the narration. I cannot truly put my finger on it, but after turning the last page I sincerely wished that the story would not have come to an end yet. I wanted to return to the clearing in the rain forest, to El Gato and his mysterious mentor, and train football with them.\n\nJune 2, 2009\n\nI am not, and will not ever be, a soccer buff - but this book gave me an appreciation for the game that I definitely did not possess beforehand. Peet has written a novel that weaves mysticism and football into one package that takes surprising turns.\n\nAlternating between current day and El Gato's childhood, the reader is taken on a journey from his knobbly kneed, talentless beginnings to his World Cup winning present. It's a vivid journey, one where every event is written in action packed detail that allows you to be in the moment. The characters are expertly depicted. El Gato is a character that evolves beautifully, like a caterpillar into a butterfly, under the tutelage of the mysterious Keeper. In the end soccer/football is a metaphor for life; embrace your vulnerability and fear, work your butt off and stay open to opportunities and good things will come.\n\nIf there was anything to quibble, it would be the scenes in present day. Some of the dialogue felt a little flat for me, almost like it was an untruth. At time it was easy to resent Faustino and his interference into the unravelling past of El Gato. Perhaps this was the goal of Peet, for the journalist to add a splash of reality to the magical tale of the boy and the shadow? As the readers we want to return to the jungle, to the Keeper, to El Gato's journey as soon as possible. It's a fantastic way to build tension within the story and within the reader.\n\nIt's a lovely read. Full of joy for soccer, the technicalities of the game and of life, the need for belief in yourself and the impossible and the joy in success. It's quite a surprising read that runs the gamut of emotions and turns - highly recommended.\n\nAugust 24, 2014\n\nFabulous read for lovers of Football, and a ghost story.\n\nWinner of the Carnegie medal.\n\nExcellent read from an amazing author.\n\nDecember 31, 2018\n\n301218: read 021115. i did not then and do not now have any argument that promotes this to five stars. i just did. it is called ‘the world’s game’ and ‘the beautiful game’ but then my love is almost entirely as spectator, sure i played as kid, not sure if we had actual positions or i just liked wandering upfield... and so this book might to educate, experienced, readers where the game is a big deal, seem thin or contrived as any of those sports-heroes bio films ever seen. but i like this weird fantasy/sport/mysticism and the exposure of making myth. this is how i would like to imagine the players the play the games the emotions...\n\ni remember discussing with girl about relative merits of art (we were at some ballet...) and sport (i had wanted to watch something not very important...). she claimed art always expressed some emotions, summoned love, mourning etc. i said the only difference was that in sports you never know the ending, less the emotions you will have getting there... and i was really living through the most boring three hours in monkey suit with beauty beside me, but then she had come to some game for me. maybe my love of sport is too much to the art end (beautiful losses, ugly wins...), to team or player or season narratives, but this book works both for me...\n\nDecember 20, 2017\n\nLove soccer? Then this book is for you! Keeper by Mal Peet is a great book that will take you on an adventure like no other. Keeper follows El Gato, a boy who grows up in a small South American village and meets a strange ghost-like figure that trains him to become the best goalkeeper in the world. This book is very well written but I would have liked it even more if it had more detail on El Gato's time while he lived in San Juan and played for the club team there and more of a description of where the village he lived in was and what it was like but otherwise than that it was a very good book. My favorite part of this book is how well Mal Peet develops El Gato's relationships with others and how he feels about certain things, this development of El Gato really allows the reader to become attached to him and draw the reader into the book even more. This book also accurately depicts the life in a small forest village and how the role of men and women is much more different there than in our society. Keeper is a great balance of fantasy, diversity, and the beautiful game of soccer. This is a must-read book for every soccer player or anyone who wants a fun and thrilling book!\n\nJuly 19, 2017\n\nIt's a 1001 book and I found an ebook of it available---there's no other reason I decided to read it today. I knew it was about soccer, and I honestly can't think of something I like to read about less than sports.\n\nBut it is a 1001 book. And it was available today. And it is short. So I plunged in.\n\nAnd...I liked it. I liked it a lot.\n\nIt's the story of a boy who lives with his family in the South American jungle who learns how to play soccer from a mysterious figure in the wild. The boy is good, so good that he is recruited to play pro soccer and eventually wins the World Cup. This book is an interview between the boy, now thirty, and a sports reporter.\n\nI found myself (me, a person who knows almost nothing about soccer) fascinated with the story of the boy, his family, soccer, the mysterious coach. I can't wait to share it with a person out there who actually likes sports (!)\n\nApril 29, 2019\n\nMaybe 4.5. I always struggle with rating young adult books. I felt this one is good for all ages. It might even need older readers not because the content is mature it just felt like a serious book. Writing was excellent. Just the right amount of soccer and story.\n\nRead\n\nOctober 13, 2023\n\nToday’s interview will be fascinating folks. We are interviewing the Famous El Gato World Cup-winning goalkeeper. He is one of the best keepers ever to live. We will be learning about his life leading up to the cup until the last moment of the game. You are here with ESPN reporter Isaiah Hewlett and his exclusive interview with the world's best keeper from South Africa El Gato.\n\nIH: Hello El Gato I hope you are having an amazing morning and I am glad you were able to come here and tell us about your journey to winning the World Cup.\n\nEG: No problem. I am glad someone is interested in my story and would love to share all about my journey.\n\nIH: Well let's start with our first question then describe any influences in your past that led you to do the things you do today.\n\nEG: I know there has always been one thing that influenced me most in the past but I don’t know what I would call it. And if I told the real story most people wouldn’t believe me. I would describe my one influence as a man, a goalkeeper but no one would know him. The man was almost like a ghost but he was very wise and taught me everything I know about goalkeeping. Without him, I wouldn’t be in the position I am in today. And the other thing that influenced me isn’t a person but the jungle. The jungle is a place where everything has a purpose and a reason and without one of those pieces working in the way they are supposed to the jungle falls apart. The jungle helped me find my purpose and I will forever be thankful.\n\nIH: Well I hope that the “ghost” that influenced you so much and made you the person we know today sees this interview so that they can know the impact that you had on their lives. What do you consider your greatest achievement so far, and why?\n\nEG: Although many people will disagree with me, my greatest achievement so far is mastering the art of goalkeeping. Many would ask why it isn’t winning the World Cup but I think mastering my purpose in this world has way more value than any trophy could ever bring in my life. I dedicated countless hours to goalkeeping and now I have mastered it and that means a lot to me.\n\nIH: That was not the answer I was expecting but it seemed very meaningful and that leads to my next question. What is your greatest strength and why? What is your greatest weakness and why?\n\nEG: My greatest strength is my ability to protect my goal and my mastery of goalkeeping. I consider this my greatest strength because it is what has brought me to the position I am in today. But my greatest weakness is myself because as I said before I mastered goalkeeping and that means nothing can stand in my way but myself when I get into my mind is when I play my worst and things start to go downhill. This isn’t only for keeping though, it has been like that for anything I have done in my life. Only when I get in my way do I find myself failing?\n\nIH: Thanks for sharing that and your take on your greatest weakness was extremely eye-opening and humbling. Now I want to ask something about your life growing up. If you don’t mind, how did you feel about your surroundings (setting) growing up and why?\n\nEG: Growing up I lived in a pretty small town with vendors, bars, tiny houses, and many street soccer games all around me. But there was also a forest on the edge of my town. Growing up I mainly stayed in the town and it was pretty good but as I got older for certain reasons I started traveling to the forest more and more. I didn’t like the town as much because I was quiet and liked to observe but in the forest, I could do exactly that and I loved it. The forest is where I felt at home and I could be myself. My family didn’t like me in the forest and I was a good kid but that’s the one thing I didn’t listen to them about because they could never take me away from where I felt like I belonged.\n\nIH: Wow I didn’t know you valued your hometown so much. And I didn’t know one silly old forest could have so much impact on a person.\n\nEG: The forest wasn’t silly to me, it was something very special and something I valued throughout life and still to this day.\n\nIH: I am very sorry I didn’t mean to offend you but on to my next question. Would you describe yourself more as hardworking or lucky?\n\nEG: I would never call success \" luck\". I am an extremely hard-working man and have earned all of my success and skill. I may be lucky that I met the right people at the right times. But that is a different story for a different day. But I do not think any of my life is luck. I think it was fate and just me listening to my heart. I will never stop being hardworking and that is something I want the entire world to know.\n\nIH: Well you heard it on ESPN first El Gato is a very hardworking man, tell me one thing about yourself that most people don't know and why don't they know it?\n\nEG: There is one thing that most people don’t know about in my life and it was my journey to how I became such a great goalkeeper as many people say today. Most people don’t know this story because they wouldn’t believe me and why would I tell people something so important to me just for them to think it was a lie? I told you previously in the interview about the ghost but most people don’t know the full story about him and I don’t think I am ready to share that yet let me just tell you that he was the best keeper in the world before I even started keeping.\n\nIH: What are the three words you'd use to describe yourself and why those three words?\n\nEG: One word I would use to describe myself is wise, I am not saying this in a way to just make myself look good but I think one of my greatest qualities is my knowledge and understanding of the things around me. Another word I would use to describe myself is observant not only on the soccer field but in my everyday life I have always been observant even when I was busy studying in grade school. The last word I would use is hardworking as I said earlier. I work for everything I have and will continue to. I just want everyone to know my story.\n\nIH: Well ElGato you certainly showed us how humble you are and I admire that but has winning the World Cup changed how you view your life now?\n\nEG: Winning the World Cup was more like winning a trophy that represented all of the hard work in my life paying off. I am grateful for the trophy but the fame and popularity I have gained from it mean nothing to me as I am simply just a keeper and anyone who trains enough and has the heart can do exactly what I did. The key part is putting your mind to what you want to achieve.\n\nIH: Well that is a very different answer than what I think your teammates would have given me. Has your professional soccer career changed your life?\n\nEG: My professional soccer career changed my life by giving me purpose. Without a purpose in this world, no one can become anything and when I became a keeper everything changed for me, and going to the professional leagues just put the cherry on top because I was able to support my family still living in my hometown.\n\nIH: That is very thoughtful of you to think of the people you started with and something I think lots of professional athletes in general forget. I want to end things with this one last question: who is one person that you go to when you need anything in your life?\n\nEG: I would go back to the forest and go to the Ghost. Many people probably won’t believe me but he was very important to me and taught me most of the things I know. Most people probably think about how a ghost could be so influential. But he wasn’t just any ghost he was the keeper.\n\nIf you liked listening to this interview, read the book The Keeper by Mal Peet, where you can find out more about the Keeper and get a more in-depth look into his life.\n\nNovember 4, 2011\n\nI got this young adult novel for my daughter to read, but ended up reading it myself. It's quite an unusual story. Keeper is set up as a first-person narrative by El Gato, the nickname of the world's greatest soccer player. He is being interviewed by a journalist named Paul Faustino. El Gato relates his boyhood journey and transformation into an almost supernaturally gifted goalkeeper. Faustino is skeptical and wonders if he's being lied to.\n\nIt is a strange tale. El Gato is the son of a poor logger who lives in a village at the edge of the rainforest. He is not particularly adept at the town soccer games, and his gangly frame and clumsy play earns him the nickname El Cigüeño, the Stork. Despite his grandmother's dire warnings, he starts straying into the jungle, where he encounters an empty soccer field with a goal (which should tip you off that something isn't normal, as the jungle normally has to be hacked back from taking over the village -- there is no way a soccer field wouldn't revert to trees). He meets a spectral goalkeeper in old-fashioned soccer clothes from another era. Thus begin his extraordinary lessons in goal keeping. He explains his jungle absences by keeping journals filled with drawings and observations of the natural world. His mother has ambitions for him to go to university and become a scientist/naturalist. He is supposed to pay for this by joining his father as a logger for two years once he becomes 15, saving his money and then going off to school. There is an intensely brutal soccer game that takes place in a clearing at the camp every Saturday after payday, and the loggers typically play the camp mechanics. El Gato takes the place of a missing keeper, and his giftedness soon gives him a different destiny.\n\nThis book is very much worth reading. The description of goal keeping is interesting even if you are not a huge sports fan, as is the description of the brutal logging camp environment, and the Darwinian dog-eat-dog cruelties of the loggers and camp workers as well. This is a metaphysical journey as well -- what is your gift, and your place in the world? Well-written and unusual. I'll probably read it again.\n\nMay 24, 2010\n\nWhat the little snippet in Goodreads about this book doesn't tell you is that it's a really quite weird mixture of sports story and supernatural mystery, with a bonus ecological message. All of which sounds like a lot to swallow (as does the description of Pett's even-better 'Exposure' when described as a retelling of Hamlet in the context of contemporary celebrity culture and lingering racism) but 'Keeper' is an engrossing read.\n\nThe book opens with El Gato - keeper for the team that has just won the football world cup - sitting down for an interview with sport journalist Paul Faustino. Faustino is expecting material for a handy exclusive about the nail-biting final that will win favour with his boss, but El Gato takes the interview in quite a different direction. He begins with a vivid, but seemingly normal, account of his childhood in a logging town on the verge of the South American rainforest, and his uselessness in the pick-up games that the village kids play after school. At this point he is not El Gato (the cat) but La Ciguena (the stork)'staggering like a drunken goat' around the pitch.\n\nThen one day, out exploring the forest to avoid the shame of failing continually in front of the other kids, he stumbles on a clearing - a flat green paddock and a single set of goal posts. And a mysterious, flickering figure - the Keeper.\n\nThe Keeper transforms La Ciguena into El Gato through relentless training and some magically written scenes involving the rainforest. The magic isn't just in the supernatural storyline; it's also in the descriptions of the training and the games. Great sports writing - any great factual descriptive writing - leaves you with a deep desire to apply your new found insight to the subject matter for yourself. 'Keeper' has made me want to watch a game of soccer for the first time in years, to see how the goalie play the players and the game.\n\nNovember 5, 2023\n\nMagic\n\nThere is something in this book, akin to the euphoric high of knowing you do not have an alarm for the next day, that is gripping and beautiful. I have never, in my entire life, read a book like this. Through delicate, intricate, almost too meticulous writing, Peet seems to have conveyed a story in less than 250 pages that most writers would need 400 for. It doesn't make sense on the surface, how can someone weave words together with the tiniest of details and the most descriptive of passages, and yet, be concise? It's a phenomenal feat, one that I don't think I'll ever see again, or if I do, one that will never stop amazing me.\n\nPeet was a talented writer, and the world is lacking without his presence, but his art remains, ready to be admired and adored.\n\nThe book is technically simple, a conversation between two friends, one of whom is a journalist, the other a world-famous soccer player. It is a testament to Peet's talent that this conversation is never lost, nor is it ever too centered. It is neatly placed, thoughtfully crafted, and mimics all the other parts of this book in its deliberateness.\n\nThe magical realism YA genre typically is not my thing, especially as I've entered adulthood, but this book truly affected me beyond measure. I am forced to reflect on my life, my hopes, my dreams, my insecurities, and my fears when I read this book. I am forced to ask myself what it is that I want out of life and what it is that I want my life to get out of me.\n\nThis short, moving, incredibly written story should be on everyone's shelf. A great gift to anyone above the age of ten. A wonderful buddy read. A lovely book to save for a rainy day.\n\nSeptember 9, 2013\n\ni decided to read the book Keeper by Mal Peet because i really enjoy reading sports fiction, most soccer.\n\nThe category on the bingo board this book is under is 'A book that teaches you about a culture other than your own' it told you about how different it was to grow up in poor places like the ones in south america and how education wasn't the main priority. Also it shows how the people over there had to live, and there jobs were a lot harder then the jobs here but get a lot less money for it.\n\nThe most interesting character in the novel has to be the main one. El Gato (Big Cat) was a tall clumsy guy who played football with his mates outside the pizza shop. He really enjoyed being keeper but he was never really that good. He soon realizes that if he wants to continue becoming a goalie is cant just keep playing with his mates. So he starts to train 4-5 days a week and still works with his dad to help pay rent and for food. This shows real dedication and hard work and it does pay off eventually.\n\nMy most interesting quote in the novel was: A dream will be a dream unless you for fill it. This means that you can dream all you want but if that's all you do it wont become real, so you need to have that dream as motivation to achieve that goal/dream.\n\nWhat i learned from this book was that its not the richest people or most popular people or go far in life, its the people who put the most effort in and never stop trying/quit. Things may get hard at points but you always push through and there's always a good ending!\n\nNovember 20, 2008\n\nThe book review\n\nThe author of Mal Peet of the keeper, this story is about this boy who is about to get an opportunity of a lifetime. This boy is around 15 year old whose father works as a logger. Then one day he plays soccer in the plaza in town and one position was opened it was a new era in his life. After he arrived from a cruel day of soccer, he found a feeling to go in the forest and came across this clearing and saw a raggedy beat up net and saw a man standing there…\n\nThe keeper is a fantastic, thrilling story that includes sadness, happiness and exitment. I highly recommend this book to people that adore soccer and are sport lovers. This amazing story is realistic fiction. My option on this book is a very good review. That was a quick, short review from my opinion.\n\nAugust 17, 2011\n\nI picked this book up at my local library, interested by the name and the cover. Being a goalkeeper myself, I was curious as to what the book was about. I really enjoyed it and I thought the author did a wonderful job describing what went through a keeper's mind when they are in the net. He captured the emotion of El Gato very well. I know what it's like to be frustrated when you don't block a shot, or when your coach or \"mentor\", so to speak, gets mad and yells at you. I really related to this book and enjoyed it.\n\nMarch 26, 2014\n\nRocky's got nothing on El Gato!\n\nOctober 27, 2018\n\nKsiążkę Mala Peeta odkryłem przez przypadek. Jedno z czasopism akurat reklamowało tę książkę. Recenzja tej książki była dość dobra i zachęcająca. W dodatku temat piłki nożnej w tym roku był na tapecie ze względu na mistrzostwa świata w Rosji.\n\nKsiążka opisuje losy brazylijskiego piłkarza, bramkarza, który dorasta w dość trudnych warunkach w brazylijskiej prowincji. Mimo dość trudnej sytuacji oraz biedy jaka panuje w jego środowisku oraz w jego rodzinie udaje mu się osiągnąć to, o czym marzy każdy piłkarz, mianowicie zostać mistrzem świata i przyczynić się do wygranej w finale. Ale po kolei.\n\nKsiążka ma wymiar metafizyczny. Zastanawiam się ile pisać o treści, bo nie chcę zbyt wiele spojlować. Poruszanych jest tu kilka spraw. Dążenie dziecka do realizacji swoich marzeń, mimo przeciwności losu. Trudną sytuacje w Brazylii związaną z wycinaniem dżungli, płuc naszej planety oraz trudnych warunków jakie panują podczas prac związanych z wycinką Amazonii. Metafizyczny wątek dotyczy tego, iż aby osiągnąć sukces trzeba mieć wsparcie jakiejś osoby, której zależy na tym abyśmy osiągnęli sukces. Sukces nie rodzi się sam z niczego, potrzebna jest ciężka praca oraz wsparcie drugiej osoby.\n\nZaskoczyło mnie, że nie ma polskiego tłumaczenia tej książki, gdyż jednak książka jest dość popularna i została przetłumaczona na wiele języków.\n\n\"Keeper\" otwiera całą serię książek i myślę, że będę dalej sięgał po książki tego autora.\n\nNovember 4, 2019\n\nKeeper, by \"Mal Peet\", details the interview between El Gato and Paul Faustino. During the interview, El Gato talks about the process of his young self, La Cigueña, a skinny, tall, and confused boy, becoming the great goalkeeper he was. This process begins as El Gato, tired of feeling unworthy, wandered into the forest to keep his thoughts on something other than his failure. Unusually, he finds a clearance inside the forest. As soon he enters and looks around, El Gato is surprised with a ghost, or at least he thinks so. As he is taught by the ghost how to keep the ball and see its path, no one can defeat El Gato. After he fulfills his dream to win the World Cup, El Gato realized his teacher was the Goalkeeper who died in an airplane crash going to play in the same cup years before him. As he notices this, he immediately takes the trophy in his hand and travels all the way to his hometown. As he arrives at the forest, he sees himself in his teacher and gives him the trophy. When this happens, the mysterious forest teacher disappears, and El Gato is left smiling. The reader then notices the whole book is about gratefulness and fulfilling dreams.\n\nApril 3, 2019\n\nThe novel \"Keeper\" A mal peet story. The story is about a news reporter interviewing a World cup winning goalkeeper. The news reporter Paul faustino interviews El gato about how he won the World cup and everything else about his childhood. I really enjoyed this book and I recommend this book to everybody who enjoys sports, especially soccer. El gato also talks about how he cheated in the final of the World cup for the last penalty. It's a really good book, it's also inspiring at some points so I really recommend people to read this book. The Keeper was a mentor to El gato, a ghostly one but very real. What I mean by that was no one really knew if The Keeper really existed or not but El gato saw him as a real person. My opinion on this book is that I really liked this book and like I said this inspired me at some points, but I really recommend this book. It's mostly about soccer so it's a good book, and it was crazy how Gato's life changed so fast. By just walking into that forest and seeing that soccer post and being trained by the Keeper, which wasn't real and was a ghost. In my opinion I think I feel what he felt because I myself play soccer and know all the experiences he's gone through, especially when he started. This book has showed me that if you don't try and focus on what you want to do, you can't achieve what you want to do. El gato did so because he didn't know how to play goalkeeper and was soon trained and became a World cup winning goalkeeper, something everyone dreams of doing. My final thoughts on this book is that I really enjoyed reading this book and this book inspired me to try harder at what I want to accomplish.\n\nApril 3, 2018\n\nThe South American goalkeeper who has just led his team in winning the World Cup tells his life story to the most famous South American sports writer in an exclusive interview, but Paul (the writer) gets so much more than he bargained for in El Gato's story, and the keeper has his own motives for telling all of his secrets.\n\nI honestly didn't think I'd like this book, because I couldn't imagine enjoying any book about any kind of sport. But this one is about so much more than soccer. It combines a deep-set love of the game with a coming-of-age story wrapped in magical realism and with a healthy dose of environmental consciousness. In short, it's a winner.\n\nMarch 31, 2017\n\nMal Peet, Author of the book Keeper brought a very interesting book about a soccer player called \" El Gato\" He plays for his country that is Brazil, located in South America. He has the chance to help his country win the world cup a 5th time from the year it started, and show everyone that they are the most competitive in any competition. He goes through a lot before having that chance. He used to live in the jungle being a poor kid just playing soccer. Growing up he wanted to be something else, have the chance to play even more. I enjoyed the book because it talks about a sport I love that is soccer, and also the main character is from South America.\n\nJanuary 3, 2019\n\n4 years later, still the only book I can vividly remember every detail of, by far my favorite book I've ever read. Amazing\n\nMarch 29, 2020\n\nVery entertaining. Probably would rate it even higher if sports books were my jam, but definitely a solid read.\n\nSeptember 27, 2017\n\nLove this quick read -- soccer, possibility, dreams, and family all wrapped together.\n\nDecember 23, 2008\n\nKeeper\n\nMal Peet\n\nPP 240 New York\n\nCandlewick Press 14.99\n\n9780763632861\n\nJonathan Linfield\n\nMr.Nourok\n\n903 D\n\n12/22/2008\n\nYou open the book, you think about the book is going to go a different way. But then everything changes. You get into the book. You can’t get enough of it so you never put it down. You start to imagine your in the shoes of “El Gato” the soon to be world cup soccer goalie. You start thinking about your life and how it might go for you. You start to think maybe I can reach my goal but not the goal, which reaches the back of the net.\n\nThe story begins with an interview of El Gato the world cup winning soccer player. The interviewer starts asking questions about El Gato and how the winning and like a little of his childhood. Some parts can get so emotional you may even cry with El Gato come parts you might get this shock of excitement and just jump out of the you chair to scream yay. So as the story moves on you experience his life with him almost as if he is telling you his life but in such a way you don’t even think it’s a movie but that it’s a documentary that you are listening to.\n\nKeeper is a book that has many meaning behind it and strong ones, which are ones we people, experience all the time. From day to day and year-by-year as our life goes on. These meaning we might here be able to change our life the course we take and our what will soon be future. But the meaning it shows are Never give up on a dream just because someone says you can’t do it and the other strong one is you can be whatever you want to be if you are determined and you have your head in the right direction. To me these meant a lot because of course we all get our problems once and or twice well actually many times and this book, yes it might be about soccer but if you read below the text and dig deeper you will see that its more then just a story.\n\nThis book I would recommend for everyone because its not really written for just one type of people because everyone can look at it from a different angle and just get something different from it like a new story to tell or as I said before meaning and maybe even changing your life around in a different direction.\n\nSo right now get up walk to your bookstore pick up a copy buy it then read it. Of course I can’t be like an advertisement which say and get your money back but I think I can guarantee that you will enjoy this book so that’s the guarantee I give you.\n\nJanuary 10, 2011\n\nThe book Keeper by Mal Peet is a story about a soccer goalie who is from the forests of Puerto Rico. The whole book is an interview by a famous journalist of the time, Paul Faustino. Were he is from everyone plays soccer and only soccer, but not him. WHen he played soccer as a little boy, in the plaza, he didn't enjoy it as much as he did exploring the surrounding forest. On most days (while the other children were playing soccer in the plaza, the boy would be walking through the forrest exploring all the plants and animals. This went on for a long time,until one day he ventured a little bit further into the trees then he normally did. What he saw would change his life forever, Right in the middle of the dense forrest was a clearing, this clearing had very short grass and an old soccer goal. As the main charactor, El Gato (the cat) walked into the clearing, a shadowy figure emerged too. The figure was The Keeper. The Keeper would get El Gato to love soccer, and become very good at it.\n\nEl Gato would play in the saturday games with the people he worked with. By time he did this he was very good. His boss asked a scout from Boca Juniors (a very good club in San Juan) to cone watch him. When the guy came out and watched El Gato play he immedietly signed him on a two year contract whit them. Soon after he played with the Boca Juniors, he got called up to the Boca Sr. This was a very big deal because at the age of 16 he became the youngest player to play in a game for the top Boca team. Being on Boca lead hip to plying in the Champions League (and winning the cup), being the FIFA player of the year, and much more. When he was 30 he won the World Cup. Normally goalies retire what there in their late 30's, but El Gato decided to retire right after the World Cup. When he was asked why he was retiring at such a young age especially when he could do so much more with the sport, he said that he was going back to his hometown to make a differenc in the world because there are bigger things in the world then soccer... so that is what he did for the rest of his life.\n\nI think that this was a pretty good book because it was riviting, fun and interesting all the way thru."
