        "text": "One author\n\nGive the author's name and the page number or page range in parentheses. If the author's name is stated in the sentence, always place the page number in parentheses at the next natural pause in the text, usually at the end of the sentence.\n\n(Alexander 22-29).\n\nAlexander notes that race was a critical topic in the 1968 presidential race (22-29).\n\nTwo authors\n\nGive both names separated by the wordand when including the names in the text of a sentence or in parentheses.\n\nWilson and Schlosser state the results...(47).\n\n(Wilson and Schlosser 47).\n\nThree or more authors\n\nWhen mentioning the authors in the text, give all of the authors' names or list the first author and write \"and others\". For the parenthetical citation and Works Cited citation, give the first author's name followed by et al.\n\nJames and others claim that social customs prevalent in the southern United States have...(157-65).\n\nOR\n\nSocial customs in the southern United States have become...(James et al. 157-65).\n\nMultiple works by the same author\n\nInclude the author's name, then a comma, then a shortened version of the title, followed by the page reference.\n\n(Dickens, David Copperfield 347).\n\n(Dickens, A Tale of Two Cities 89).\n\nMultiple citations by the same author in one sentence\n\nWhen you have two citations for the same author in one sentence, usually quotes from two different pages, you can combine them in one citation at the end of the sentence like this: (Ibsen 1700, 1704).\n\nAuthors with the same surname\n\nWhen authors of two separate works in your Works Cited list have the same surname, include the first initial of the author you are referencing in the in-text citation.\n\n(H. Smith 34).\n\nMultiple works by different authors in the same citation\n\nInclude the last name and page reference for the first author, then a semi-colon, followed by the last name and page reference for the next author.\n\n(Smith 93; Fayett 131-32).\n\nOrganizations as authors/Corporate author\n\nList the corporate author followed by the page reference. Abbreviate words like Department.\n\n(American Library Association 17).\n\nOrganizations as authors/Corporate author that is also the Publisher\n\nWhen the author is an organization or corporation that is also the publisher, the Works Cited citation will begin with the title, instead of the author. Corresponding in-text citations should use an abbreviated version of the title and the page reference.\n\n(Publication 3).\n\nGovernment author\n\nIf the author is a government or government body, include the administrative layers listed in the Works Cited entry separated by commas. Use abbreviations for common words like Department (as \"Dept.\").\n\n(United States, Congress, House, Committee on the Judiciary 7).\n\nWorks without authors\n\nIf the Works Cited entry begins with a title because there is no author, use the title followed by the page reference in the in-text citation. Use an abbreviated version for long titles. To abbreviate a title, use as few words as possible, dropping articles and prepositions, but keeping the first word of the title as alphabetized in your Works Cited. The abbreviated title should be a noun phrase, so likely the first noun in the title along with any adjectives that come before it. Titles of an article, chapter, or web page should be placed in double quotation marks. Titles of a periodical, book, entire website, report, or brochure should be italicized.\n\nARTICLE title (\"New Deal\" 121).\n\nBOOK title (Open Box 18).\n\nLONG book title (Handbook of Geriatric Therapy 26).\n\nWorks with Anonymous listed as author\n\nOnly list Anonymous as the author when Anonymous is given as the author's name.

Do not use the term Anonymous for works without authors listed.\n\nAnonymous said...(83).\n\n(Anonymous 83).\n\nWorks without pagination\n\nWhen citing a website or webpage (without page numbers), include the author's name only in the in-text citation.\n\n(Horowitz).\n\n(United States, Congress, House, Committee on the Judiciary)\n\nEntire works\n\nIf you are referring to an entire work, you may identify the work in your text using the author or title name from your Works Cited list rather than a parenthetical citation.\n\nTo Kill a Mockingbird was published over fifty years ago and is still read by many students today.\n\nMultivolume works (one volume consulted)\n\nIf your Works Cited entry indicates only one volume of a multivolume set, include the page reference in the parenthetical citation. The volume is already specified in the Works Cited entry.\n\n(Norat 27).\n\nNorat, Gisela. \"Isabel Allende: Chilean and American Novelist.\" Notable Latino Writers, vol. 1, Salem Press, 2006, pp. 27-34.\n\nMultivolume works (more than one volume consulted)\n\nIf your Works Cited entry indicates more than one volume of a multivolume set, include both the volume and the page reference in the parenthetical citation to distinguish which volume is being referenced.\n\n(Notable, 1: 27).\n\nNotable Latino Writers, vol. 1, Salem Press, 2006, 3 vols.\n\nMedia with a timestamp and no page numbers\n\nIf your source has no page numbers but has a timestamp, such as a video or audio source, give the timestamp range instead of the page number ranges.\n\n(Busari 00:02:30 - 00:03:15).\n\nBusari, Stephanie. \"How Fake News Does Real Harm.\" TED, Feb. 2017, www.ted.com/talks/stephanie_busari_how_fake_news_does_real_harm?language=en."
