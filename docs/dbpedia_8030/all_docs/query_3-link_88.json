He had been diagnosed with cancer several months ago.\n\nPeet wrote young-adult novels, as well as educational children’s books co-authored with his wife Elspeth Graham. He won the 2005 Carnegie Medal for “Tamar,” a historical novel set during World War II.\n\nHis first novel for adults, “The Murdstone Trilogy,” was published last year.\n\nCox said the world had lost “an author of exceptional genius.”\n\n“The Fault in Our Stars” author John Green tweeted that Peet was “one of the greatest YA writers and a man I greatly admired (even when we disagreed!)”\n\nPeet is survived by his wife, three children and two grandchildren."
