Alain C Masquelet\n\nWhen can a defect be considered as severe? This is not a mild question because the answer is inevitably arbitrary. I propose the following answer: a defect is severe when the restoration of the injured structure cannot be performed without employing a palliative procedure. A limited bone or joint defect can be neglected. For instance, a small defect of cartilage in a joint will not have an effect on function. In case of soft tissue limited defect, direct restoration of the continuity can be obtained owing to the suppleness of the involved tissue which can be sutured. This is also the case for skin, arteries, nerves, muscles and tendons. In other cases, direct suturing is not possible and the defect cannot be neglected without an inacceptable functional impairment. The aim of this textbook is to provide some answers to the following questions: • How to repair a severe defect of a tissue of the upper limb? • What are the surgical procedures and what are their respective indications according to the features of the defect? • How to reconstruct a long bone defect? • How to perform a joint fusion when there is a bone defect? • What are the possible methods to restore the skin envelope, the continuity of nerves and tendons, etc.? All the answers to these questions require a good knowledge of conventional procedures, state-of-the-art advances in bioengineering and imagination. The course includes surgical precedures and general indications. The upper limb is an assembly of structures and tissues devoted to supporting the prehensile function of the hand. The initial trauma may lead to a variety of associated lesions of several tissues. A limited defect of the skin envelope can be combined with a severe defect of a long bone. In this situation we only consider the severe defect of the bone. But if a severe defect involves two or more structures, we call it a compound defect. A compound defect is the combination of several severe defects with varying degrees of involvement of the skin, muscles, bone, joints, tendons, nerves, arteries, etc. Thus we can give some definitions. • A defect always implies a defect of a particular tissue which is a component of the musculoskeletal system. • A severe defect cannot be treated without a palliative procedure of replacement. • A compound defect is the combination of several severe defects. Another important question is: How to repair a compound defect?\n\nSevere traumatic defects of the upper limb\n\n2\n\nIn this book two possibilities are considered: the replacement of each isolated tissue or the use of a compound transfer which allows the repair in a one-stage procedure. The aim is to provide an holistic view of all possibilities including the latest advances in bioengineering. The replantation of amputated segments of the upper limb and the severe injuries of the fingers will not be discussed.\n\nSoft tissue repair: flap techniques\n\n2 Pedicled fasciocutaneous and adipofascial flaps José Amarante\n\nIntroduction The forearm island flaps are probably, at present, one of the surgical techniques utilized most fre\n\nFigure 1 (a) A dorsal hand lesion. (b) The final result after a distally pedicled radial forearm flap.\n\nPedicled fasciocutaneous and adipofascial flaps\n\n5\n\nquently for reconstructive surgery of the hand. These flaps are based on the arteries and veins of the forearm and their septocutaneous branches. Their main advantages include the use of fasciocutaneous or adipofascial areas of reasonable dimensions, ease of reinnervation and their possible use as composite flaps. The last option allows the execution of cutaneous, tendinous and osseous reconstructions in the same operating time. The forearm radial flap (Fig. 1) was first described in plastic surgery literature as a free flap (Yang et al 1981) and later as a distally pedicled flap for hand reconstruction. It was used in cutaneous reconstructions (Stock et al 1981), reinnervation of the reconstructed area (Schoofs et al 1983) as well as in tendocutaneous (Reid and Moss 1983) and osteocutaneous reconstructions (Biemer and Stock 1983, Schoofs et al 1983). This flap can also be utilized as an adipofascial flap (Fig. 2) or as a purely fascial flap (Reyes and Burkhalter 1988). Presently it is one of the flaps that is used more frequently in reconstruction of the hand or as a free flap in diverse anatomical areas such as the oral cavity (Boyd et al 1994), the leg (Muhlbauer et al 1982) and the penis (Gottieb and Levine 1993). Some technical modifications have been recently published: an adipofascial flap pedicled in a single distal perforator artery preserving the radial artery (Weinzweig et al 1994, Koshima et al 1995) and also a radial forearm flap without the fascia for lowering the morbidity of the donor area (Lutz et al 1999). The ulnar forearm flap (Fig. 3) was initially described as a free flap (Lovie et al 1984) but is also used with a distal pedicle in reconstructive surgery of the hand (Elliot et al 1988, Glasson et al 1988, Guimberteau et al 1988). As a free flap\n\nFigure 2 (a) Planning an adipofascial radial forearm flap. (b) The dissection of the adipofascial radial forearm flap. (c) The adipofascial flap. (d) An aspect of the final result.\n\nSevere traumatic defects of the upper limb\n\n6\n\nand in a way similar to the radial forearm flap, it has surgical applications in various areas, namely the face, penis and leg (Christie et al 1994). It can be used as a cutaneous flap but also as a composite flap with tendons or bone from the ulna (Christie et al 1994). It is centred in the forearm in a position symmetrical to the radial flap and, as its name implies, is supplied by the ulnar artery and its septal branches. A large area of skin and subcutaneous cellular tissue of the anterior region of the forearm can be used in this type of flap. The radial and the ulnar forearm flaps, when utilized with a distal pedicle, are vascularized inversely to the normal flow secured by various existing anastomoses between the radial and ulnar arteries. Another flap that has identical vascularization when pedicled distally is the posterior interosseous flap (Fig. 4) (Zancolli and Agrigiani 1986). In this case, the circulation is assured by the existing anastomosis between the two interosseous arteries localized normally in the distal third of the forearm (Penteado et al 1986). This flap is almost exclusively used in reconstructive hand surgery (Masquelet and Penteado 1987, Maillard and Meredith 1991, Angrigiani et al 1993) as an osteocutaneous flap (Costa et al 1988) although some clinical cases have been described with reconstructions in other areas using this flap as a proximally pedicled flap (Nakajima et al 1986) or as a free flap (Tonkin and Stern 1989).\n\nFigure 3 (a) A lesion located on the dorsum of the hand.

(b) The final result.\n\nFigure 5 (a) A dorsal lesion on the hand. (b) The final result after an ulnodorsal septocutaneous flap reconstruction. Contrary to the flaps already described, the ulnodorsal septocutaneous flap (distal ulnar artery island flap) (Becker and Gilbert 1988a, 1991) and the median flaps (Niranjan and Shibu 1994) are supplied with a blood flow in the normal direction: the former through a distal branch from the ulnar artery (Fig. 5) (Becker and Gilbert 1991, HolevichMadjarova et al 1991, Niranjan and Shibu 1994) and the latter through a branch from the median artery. The median flap is rarely used in clinical practice as the median artery is rarely identified. For reconstructions in the elbow area it is possible to use flaps based on the recurrent radial or ulnar arteries with reverse flow (Figs 6 and 7). The recurrent radial artery has been used in a musculocutaneous flap based on the brachioradial muscle (Lai et al 1981) while the collateral radial artery is the base of a free flap (Song et al 1982, Katsaros et al 1984). The use of these two arteries for the execution of the inverted flow flap was first described by Maruyama (Maruyama and Takeuchi 1986) and later more clinical cases were described (Culberston and Mutimer 1987). Several authors described the execution of free flaps in the medial arm area (Daniel et al 1975, Dolmann et al 1979); the execution of the island flap with a proximal pedicle has also been described (Budo et al 1984). Maruyama was the\n\nSevere traumatic defects of the upper limb\n\n8\n\nFigure 6 (a) The area demanding reconstruction. (b) The final result with the recurrent ulnar flap. first to describe an inverted flow flap based on the recurrent ulnar artery and the collateral superior ulnar artery united by their anastomoses (Maruyama et al 1987). Kadry has also presented some clinical cases using this flap (Kadry et al 1989). All the flaps described can be used as fasciocutaneous or adipofascial flaps. For adipofascial flaps and before starting the true dissection of the flap, it is necessary to lift the skin from both margins of a longitudinal incision located in the long axis of the flap. It is obvious that the flap must include the main artery supplying the flap and the local fascia. Other flaps like the anterior interosseous (Hu et al 1994) and the neurocutaneous (Bertelli 1993, Bertelli and Pagliei 1998) are not large enough to reconstruct large defects so they are not discussed in this chapter.\n\nPedicled fasciocutaneous and adipofascial flaps\n\n9\n\nFigure 7 (a) A recurrent radial flap for reconstruction of the anterior surface of the elbow. (b) A recurrent ulnar flap already dissected. (c) The final result. (d) The donor areas. Still another option for hand reconstruction is to execute venous flaps in the forearm which, as the name indicates, avoids the use of arteries for the cutaneous blood supply (Amarante et al 1987, Thatte and Thatte 1987, Amarante et al 1988).\n\nSevere traumatic defects of the upper limb\n\n10\n\nRadial forearm flap The radial flap (see Fig. 1), which can be dissected from a vast area of the anterior region of the forearm, is based on the radial artery and its septal branches as they pass at the proximal level between the brachioradialis and flexor carpi radialis muscles and at the distal level between the flexor carpi radialis and the flexor digitorum superficialis muscles. If necessary, it is possible to use a musculocutaneous composite flap once the radial artery supplies the flexor carpi radialis, brachioradialis and palmaris longus muscles. Analogically, fragments of the radius could also be used given the fact that they are vascularized by the radial artery either directly or indirectly through the periosteal branches of the insertions of the flexor pollicis longus and pronator quadratus. The flap could be resensitized utilizing either the lateral or the medial cutaneous nerves of the forearm. The venous drainage of the flap is effected through the superficial venous system which communicates with the deep veins, satellites of the radial artery, the blood flowing posteriorly contrary to the normal flow. Surgical technique Before surgery, the permeability of the arteries of the hand must be evaluated by Allen’s test. The flap must be designed on the forearm centred on the trajectory of the radial artery. Next, an incision is made on the ulnar edge of the flap which must include the skin, subcutaneous tissue and fascia (easily identifiable at this level). The flap is raised from its bed with the exposure of the forearm muscles, which is achieved by sectioning the intermuscular septa that run from the deep surface of the fascia to the subjacent muscles. Maintaining this plane of dissection assures the connection of the radial artery to the flap once this is localized in the lateral intermuscular septa. The sectioning of the periosteal insertion of the lateral septum allows the liberation of the radial artery and the two satellite veins. With these vessels already referred to, the incision can proceed to the radial margin of the flap followed by its dissection in the subfascial plane. The retraction of the brachioradialis muscle permits the exposure of the superficial branch of the radial nerve which must be kept intact. After ligation of the proximal end of the radial artery and the two satellite veins, the flap can be lifted out progressively dissecting the pedicle towards the distal end. In the event that the intention is the reinnervation of the flap, one can proceed with the identification and isolation of a nerve in the cutaneous area of the flap. Normally the arc of rotation of the flap reaches the hand, that is the fingers, though one can substantially increase that arc of rotation by dissecting out the pedicle of the flap at the level of the anatomical snuff box in a manner that facilitates the passage between the abductor pollicis longus and extensor pollicis brevis muscles.\n\nPedicled fasciocutaneous and adipofascial flaps\n\n11\n\nIf the intention is to include a bone fragment with the flap, the insertion of the lateral intermuscular septum in the periosteum of the radius must be preserved intact. In this case, the dissec tion of the flap must be done more deeply through the flexor pollicis longus and the pronator quadratus muscles until the radius is reached. The donor area of the flap is usually closed with a dermo-epidermic graft, care being taken to first cover the tendons of the flexor carpi ulnaris and brachioradialis muscles and the superficial branch of the radial nerve. This is achieved by suturing the flexor digitorum superficialis to the flexor pollicis longus muscle.\n\nUlnar forearm flap The ulnar forearm flap (see Fig. 3) is based upon the ulnar artery and its septal branches which reach the fascia by passing between the flexor carpi ulnaris and flexor digitorum superficialis muscles. The venous drainage of the island pedicle flap occurs through the satellite veins of the ulnar artery. This flap can be resensitized using the medial cutaneous nerve of the forearm. The flap can also include muscles (flexor carpi ulnaris and palmaris longus) as well as a bone fragment from the ulna. Surgical technique Before raising the flap and because an important artery supplying the hand is going to be ligated, Allen’s test must be done to confirm the permeability of the radial artery. Once the permeability of the arterial vessels is verified, the flap is designed on the forearm, beginning the intervention by the identification of the ulnar artery at the distal end. The lateral edge of the flap is then incised up to the fascia, the flap being separated previously from the flexor digitorum superficialis muscle. If necessary the palmaris longus muscle or part of the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle could be included. The flap separation is continued at this level until the fascial septum separating the flexor digitorum superficialis muscle and flexor carpi ulnaris muscle is exposed. In this phase of the intervention, the septal branches of the ulnar artery are quite visible. The incision is concluded along the periphery of the flap, ligating, if necessary, some superficial veins and identifying the medial cutaneous nerve of the forearm in case the intention is to resensitize the flap. After the separation from its bed, the flap must now be progressively separated from the ulnar nerve. Next proceed with the sectioning of the ulnar artery and its satellite veins immediately after it gives rise to the common trunk of the interosseous arteries in such a way as to permit the transposition of the flap. Usually it is necessary to dissociate the vascular pedicle of the flap from the ulnar nerve at the distal end level and to ligate some arterial muscular branches. The donor area of the flap can be closed directly if it is of reduced dimensions otherwise it is necessary to use a dermo-epidermic graft.\n\nSevere traumatic defects of the upper limb\n\n12\n\nThe posterior interosseous forearm flap The posterior interosseous flap (see Fig. 4) is based on the artery of the same name and its septal branches. The flap is located on the posterior region of the forearm where the artery emerges at this level in the deep face of the supinator muscle. The point of emergence is approximately at the union of the superior third with the median third of a line that unites the epicondylus lateralis to the processus styloideus of the ulna. At the level of emergence of the artery on the posterior face of the forearm, it is accompanied by the posterior interosseous nerve. The nerve gives rise to a small branch that accompanies the artery in its distal trajectory. These two structures accompanied by the two satellite veins of the artery pass into the fascial septum situated between the extensor carpi ulnaris and extensor digiti minimi muscles. Surgical technique The surgery begins by drawing a line that unites the epicondylus lateralis to the processus styloideus of the ulna, corresponding to the trajectory of the posterior interosseous artery. The line must be drawn with the forearm in complete pronation and with the elbow flexed. The flap must be designed on the posterior region of the forearm so as to include the emergence of the posterior interosseous artery. Before the flap is raised at the distal level, the anastomosis between the two interosseous arteries must be confirmed. Then the incision into the skin and afterwards into the fascia can be done in such way as to preserve the anastomosis. After the verification, the incision of the flap proceeds at its periphery separating it from the muscular bed on both sides of the intermuscular septum until the emergence of the interosseous artery can be seen. In this phase it is crucial not to damage the posterior interosseous nerve. After the artery is ligated proximally the flap can be completely separated from the muscular bed and after the distal dissection of the arteriovenous pedicle, it can be transposed to the hand. If the flap is of small dimensions, one can close the donor area of the flap directly, otherwise it is necessary to apply a skin graft.\n\nUlnodorsal septocutaneous flap (distal ulnar artery island flap) This flap uses the distal branches of the ulnar artery in the forearm (see Fig. 5), which run directly to the forearm fascia passing the posterior surface of the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle. After ramifying and anastomosing at the level of the fascia with other branches of the septal arteries these distal ulnar branches are going to supply a localized area at the ulnar edge of the forearm extending between the trajectory of the palmaris longus and the extensor indicis muscles.\n\nPedicled fasciocutaneous and adipofascial flaps\n\n13\n\nSurgical technique The flap is drawn on the ulnar edge of the forearm and is centred largely on the anterior region. It axis of rotation is located in the plane of emergence of the most distal septocutaneous artery, which is situated about 3–4 cm from the pisiform bone. Eventually a second perforating artery about 7–8 cm from the pisiform bone can also be included. Usually, one proceeds with raising the flap from proximal to distal, incising the skin, the subcutaneous tissue and the fascia. This structure, in the area of the flexor carpi radialis muscle is thinner and difficult to dissociate from the muscle. It the flap is raised by proceeding distally one is able to see the first perfusing artery located about 7 cm from the pisiform bone, which can also be included in the flap. During the dissection at the distal level, damage to the dorsal branch of the ulnar nerve must be avoided. Then the flap is completely separated from its bed, remaining attached only by its artery and vein, which permits easy transposition to the dorsal or the palmar regions of the hand. The donor area of the flap, if it is of reduced size, can be closed directly. In the case of large flaps, a skin graft easily closes the donor area.\n\nRecurrent radial flap (lateral arm flap with inverted flux) This flap is located on the external margin of the arm and is based on the recurrent radial artery which is usually a branch of the radial artery. This artery, after giving rise to some muscular arterial branches to the supinator and brachial muscles leads proximally anastomosing with the collateral radial artery. Surgical technique The shape of the flap is drawn on the outside of the arm centred on a line that unites the lateral epicondyle to the inferior edge of the deltoid muscle. The incision, normally initiated at the anterior edge of the flap, must include skin, subcutaneous tissue and brachial fascia up to the muscular plane. The flap is then progressively raised from its bed, allowing the identification of the recurrent radial artery that is dissected in a manner to maintain its link with the flap through the septal prolongation of the fascia. The incision is afterwards completed on the whole periphery of the flap, which is completely raised from its bed, remaining attached at the distal end by the recurrent radial artery and its satellite veins after they are proximally ligated. Depending on the width necessary for the flap, the closure of the donor area may or may not require a skin graft.\n\nSevere traumatic defects of the upper limb\n\n14\n\nRecurrent ulnar flap (medial arm flap with inverted flow) This flap is found, as the name indicates, on the internal face of the arm (see Fig. 6) and is centred on the vascular axis constituted by the recurrent ulnar artery and the collateral ulnar arteries joined by their respective anastomoses. The recurrent ulnar artery divides after its origin into two arterial branches, one anterior and the other posterior, the latter having the greater calibre and an ascending trajectory between the bundles of the flexor carpi radialis. This branch artery with the greater dimension passes in its proximal trajectory along with the ulnar nerve behind the humeral epicondyle in order to anastomose with the superior collateral ulnar artery. Surgical technique After drawing the flap on the medial face of the arm, between the anterior and posterior medial lines, the incision is made into the skin, subcutaneous tissue and the brachial fascia in the anterior margin of the flap. Afterwards the flap is raised from its bed exposing the fascial septum between the triceps brachii and brachial muscle, which is incised longitudinally, care being taken not to injure the ulnar nerve. During this phase of the dissection, the recurrent blood vessels are normally identifiable.\n\nClinical cases A total number of 246 forearm island flaps were performed, of which 117 were radial forearm flaps, 6 were ulnar forearm flaps, 43 were posterior interosseous flaps and 80 were ulnodorsal septocutaneous flaps. Two radial forearm flaps were performed in direct flow. There were 157 male and 99 female patients, ranging in age from 1 year to 74 years. All the flaps were done by bloodless technique with the patients under endovenous anaesthesia, brachial plexus block or general anaesthesia. Of the cases, 111 were treated as a result of burns, 135 as result of emergency hand trauma and 11 were reconstructions following neoformation treatment. The dorsal region of the hand was the area treated most frequently (Table 1). The complications are shown in Table 2. We had difficulty in closing the donor area in some cases as a result of the skin graft revascularization, which had the inconvenience of prolonging the recovery period. Oedema was found in some flaps, a complication which was easily resolved in the majority of cases using an elastic bandage. Only in the case of one radial forearm flap did the oedema persist beyond 3 months. The difficulty of extension of the fifth finger was observed in four cases, in which the posterior interosseous flap was used.\n\nPedicled fasciocutaneous and adipofascial flaps\n\n15\n\nTable 1 Reconstructed areas and flaps used.

Thirteen patients had dysaesthesia. Considering the recurrent radial and ulnar flaps, ten recurrent ulnar and three recurrent radial flaps were performed in nine men and four women, between 22 and 36 years old. We preferred the recurrent ulnar flap since its donor area is easier to conceal. All the donor areas, except four cases, were directly sutured. In those four cases we used skin grafts to close the donor area. Both these flaps were used to reconstruct the anterior region of the elbow and in two cases we had to use both flaps (see Fig. 7) to accomplish the goal as the areas that demanded reconstruction were of large dimensions.\n\nSevere traumatic defects of the upper limb\n\n16\n\nTotal necrosis was not observed in any of the flaps. Partial necrosis on the periphery of two of the flaps was observed.\n\nDiscussion The flaps described are safe and in general easy to execute and can be used as fasciocutaneous or adipofascial flaps. We must consider several issues in the choice of antebrachial flaps: the anatomical variations; the point of rotation of the pedicle; the vascular disadvantages; and the scar in the donor area. Anatomical variations of the radial and ulnar arteries are rarely impediments to the raising of this flap (McCormack et al 1953, Coleman and Anson 1961, Amarante 1990). For example, the presence of the superficial ulnar artery, which occurs in 2–3% of the cases (McCormack et al 1953, O’Rahilly 1986), was initially considered to be an obstacle for the use of this flap (Fatah et al 1985), although clinical practice shows that its presence facilitates the raising of this flap (Glasson and Lovie 1988, Reis et al 1994). In every case and prior to the dissection, the viability of the hand circulation after the occlusion of either the radial or ulnar arteries must be verified by Allen’s test or by Doppler fluxometer (Gelberman and Blasingame 1981, Emerson et al 1985). Nevertheless, a negative Allen’s test is not an impediment to the execution of this flap (McGregor 1987a). So if one persists in raising the flap, during the operation the artery to be ligated must be clamped prior to raising the flap, which will permit the evaluation of the circulation of the hand (McGregor 1987b). This precaution is particularly important in traumatic injuries since the circulation can be interrupted in one of the main axes of the arm or in the vascular arcs of the hand. However this situation is rarely verified given that the anastomoses between the radial and ulnar arteries at the distal end are through the palmar and dorsal arcs, which usually permit raising the flap even in the presence of local lesions at the carpal level. The posterior interosseous flap, like the radial and ulnar flaps, is irrigated in inverted flow through the anastomoses between the interosseous arteries, which requires confirmation of its presence prior to the complete raising of the flap. In our work with 50 forearm dissections we verified that the anastomotic system was absent in one case and bilaterally absent in another case (Amarante 1990) although some authors reported after 100 upper arm dissections that only in 50% of the cases is there a real interosseous system (Huelin et al 1978, Barreiro and Huelin 1980). Penteado reported the absence of the same anastomosis in one of 70 cases studied (Penteado et al 1986) contrary to another study in 50 cases in which the anastomosis was always encountered between the two interosseous arteries (Costa et al 1991). The absence of the artery in the middle of the forearm, which also makes the execution of the flap unfeasible, was verified in four, two and one of 80, 36 and 70 arms, respectively (O’Rahilly 1986, Maillard and Meredith 1991, Angrigiani et al 1993). The absence of the same artery at the distal end in one clinical case was reported (Angrigiani et al 1993) and we have also observed in a clinical case bilateral disappearance of the artery in the middle third of both forearms preventing the use of the posterior interosseous flap. The patient was a 46-year-old man with a severe bilateral Dupuytren\n\nPedicled fasciocutaneous and adipofascial flaps\n\n17\n\ncontracture with involvement of the skin (Costa et al 1991). Considering all the anatomical data presented, prior to the execution of the posterior interosseous flap and consequently the proximal sectioning of the artery, it is necessary to confirm its presence at the distal level and the anastomosis with the anterior interosseous artery. Relative to the distal septal branch of the ulnar artery, its absence was report in one (Becker and Gilbert 1991) and in three (Amarante 1990) of 50 cases studied, so it is advisable to confirm its presence prior to raising the flap. During the execution of the ulnodorsal septocutaneous flap (Becker and Gilbert 1988a,b), we always try to include, whenever it is possible, a second septal artery which is normally located about 7 cm from the pisiform bone—which was regularly encountered in 50 dissections (Amarante 1990) and the superficial forearm fascia because we think this forearm flap is identical to the posterior septocutaneous tibial flap in the leg (Amarante et al 1986), both having a vast vascular network at the fascial level between the septocutaneous arteries, making it possible to raise a flap of appreciable dimensions based on one or two perforating arteries. Other flaps like these can be dissected in the arm using the fasciocutaneous arteries located by Doppler flowmeter (Bertelli 1993, Bertelli and Pagliei 1998). The chances of execution of the median flap are very uncertain owing to its anatomical characteristics. The median artery is reported to be constantly present (Huelin et al 1978) but the fact is that it has a reasonable calibre in only 8% of cases (Niranjan and Shibu 1994). Even in these one must confirm the presence of the perforating cutaneous artery which is absent in the great majority of cases. In the utilization of inverted flux flaps, the position of the rotation point of the pedicle can influence the selection, consonant with the area to be reconstructed. That point is related to the existing anastomosis between the two arteries which supply the flap. In the case of the ulnodorsal septocutaneous flap, its point of rotation is located at the level of origin of the most distal septocutaneous artery from the ulnar artery. The anatomical characteristics of the radial and ulnar forearm flaps permit reconstructions including the fingers and areas of the hand distal to the metacarpophalangeal joints where using either a posterior interosseous flap or an ulnodorsal septocutaneous ulnar flap was not indicated. An important factor in the choice of the flap is the vascular inconvenience resulting from the arterial ligation, as it will have repercussions in the forearm and hand blood supply. The ulnodorsal septocutaneous flap and other flaps based on the fasciocutaneous or neurocutaneous arteries (Bertelli 1993, Bertelli and Pagliei 1998) are, in this aspect, the ones with fewer vascular repercussions if the arterial branches utilized are almost exclusively cutaneous. The large calibre ulnar and radial flap arteries will be ligated at the proximal end in the forearm when the flap is completed. The interruption of any of these large arteries at the forearm level has negative repercussions, most of all, on the muscular and nervous vascularization. At the muscular level in the forearm, the ulnar artery practically supplies the flexor digitorum superficialis (Parry et al 1988, Parry and Mathes 1989, Revol et al 1991). The radial artery has only one muscular branch of significance to the pedicle of the flexor carpi radialis muscle (Parry et al 1988, Parry and Mathes 1989, Revol et al 1991). This muscular branch is found quite proximally and is not usually sectioned in the execution of the radial forearm flap. In contrast to the arteries already referred to, the interosseous arteries are of great importance at the forearm level, namely the posterior interosseous artery which supplies practically all the muscles of the\n\nSevere traumatic defects of the upper limb\n\n18\n\nposterior compartment of the forearm (Parry et al 1988, Parry and Mathes 1989, Revol et al 1991): extensor digitorum communis, extensor carpi ulnaris, extensor digiti minimi, abductor pollicis longus, extensor pollicis brevis, extensor pollicis longus, supinator and extensor indicis. This fact could explain the difficulty in effecting the extension of the fifth finger—verified in four patients on whom we executed this flap—the extensor digiti minimi is practically exclusively supplied by the posterior interosseous artery. Of great importance and also deserving mention is the contribution of the arteries of these flaps to the blood supply of the main nerves of the forearm. The ulnar nerve is mostly supplied by the ulnar artery while the superficial branch of the radial nerve, a sensory nerve, is supplied by the radial artery while its motor branch is supplied by the posterior interosseous artery (Bellinger and Smith 1980, Pinal and Taylor 1990). The paraesthesias reported by some authors (Christie et al 1994, Amarante 1990), resulting from the execution of the ulnar flap, are probably, to a greater extent, related to the minor trauma verified during the dissection of the flap than a diminution of the vascular flow, as recuperation from this complication is usually fast. Relative to the repercussions of the diminution of the blood supply at the level of the hand owing to the utilization of these flaps, it must be said that the perfusion by the distal septocutaneous ulnar artery as well as by the posterior interosseous artery contributes minimally to the vascularization of the hand through their anastomoses with the palmar and dorsal arcs. The major importance of the ulnar artery relative to the radial artery in the hand circulation is noted in the references (Barreiro and Huelin 1980). Therefore, it must be emphasized that the radial artery contributes significantly to the blood supply of the thumb and index finger (Coleman and Anson 1961, Mutz 1972, Braun 1977, Parks et al 1978). The importance of these arteries in the circulation of the hand was the main reason to perform venous bridges (Soutar et al 1983, Lovie et al 1984) but later it was reported that those venous bridges soon became occluded (Gelberman et al 1982, Boorman and Sykes 1987, Meland et al 1993). Recently, a study was published which compared the vascular status of one hand where a free radial forearm flap had been harvested without radial artery reconstruction, with the vascular status of the contralateral normal hand and the authors concluded that the vascular repercussions were not significant (Meland et al 1993). When using flaps based on the radial, ulnar and interosseous arteries we must consider the sequelae not only in the hand but also in the forearm. Another factor to consider when selecting the type of flap to use is related to the donor area. Whenever the execution of large flaps requires skin grafts, they take better in ulnar and interosseous flap donor areas once the graft is applied over the muscle mass with good vascularization (Glasson and Lovie 1988). When raising a large or a distally localized radial forearm flap there will be tendons exposed with deficient blood supply making revascularization of the graft difficult and prolonging the recovery period. This problem is more frequently encountered when using large free flaps. Several techniques have been described to avoid this inconvenience (Soutar et al 1983, Fenton and Roberts 1985, McGregor 1987b, Bardsley et al 1990, Masser 1990, Liang et al 1994). Another subsequent complication is the appearance of painful neuromas in the donor area of the flap due to sectioning of sensory nerves (Boorman and Sykes 1987, Timmons et al 1986).\n\nPedicled fasciocutaneous and adipofascial flaps\n\n19\n\nIt is also important to consider the appearance of the donor area. Flaps of identical dimensions raised from the anterior region of the forearm are less visible than those raised from the dorsal region. The more visible scar is therefore a result of a flap raised from the posterior interosseous artery. From among the forearm flaps which produce less visible donor scars, the first choice should be the ulnodorsal septocutaneous flap since it is raised on the ulnar edge of the forearm—an area little exposed in the functional position. The scar from raising a radial forearm flap on the radial side of the forearm is, compared to similar areas, more visible than a scar resulting from raising an ulnar flap. Any one of these flaps, if executed with reduced dimensions, which will permit the direct closing of the donor area, will cause fewer visible scars. The recurrent radial and ulnar flaps are useful for the reconstruction of areas in the elbow and it is important to point out the fact that the arteries that nourish these flaps are dispensable. When the flaps have small dimensions, it is possible to suture directly the donor area minimizing the aesthetic sequelae more so, with the recurrent ulnar flap as its donor scar is more concealed. For the reconstruction of large defects in the elbow it is possible to use both flaps simultaneously.\n\nConclusion In surgery of the hand, to reconstruct large cutaneous areas or in the case of simultaneous cutaneous, osseous and tendinous reconstructions we prefer to use the radial forearm flap as a fasciocutaneous, adipofascial or as a composite flap. For small areas localized proximally in the hand and not over the metacarpophalangeal joints, we opt for the ulnodorsal septocutaneous flap in which no important artery is sectioned. This flap produces, from an aesthetic point of view, fewer donor scars in the forearm. Given the importance of the ulnar artery in hand circulation and its proximity to the ulnar nerve, ulnar forearm flaps are used only in selected cases in spite of the scars in the donor areas being less visible. The posterior interosseous flap uses an artery that supplies almost all muscles in the posterior compartment of the forearm. This is why the use of this flap must be carefully thought out. The scar in the donor area of this flap is located in the dorsal region of the forearm and, of all the flaps described, is the most visible amongst those found in identical areas. We prefer to use the radial forearm flap and, for smaller areas, the ulnodorsal septocutaneous flap. For reconstruction of the elbow we prefer the recurrent ulnar flap if its donor scar will be less visible. If we need to reconstruct large areas we use both the recurrent ulnar and the recurrent radial flaps.\n\nReferences Amarante J (1990) Retalhos Septocutâneos de Fluxo Invertido Contribuição Para o seu Estudo a Nivel Distal dos Membros.

Therefore we believe, among others, that the combination of specialties, as represented in the orthoplastic approach, permits the best possible outcome in the treatment of the mangled upper extremity (Green 1994, Gopal et al 2000). The orthoplastic approach combines the best of two surgical specialists: the orthopedic surgeon with training and practice traditionally dedicated to the care of bone and joint injuries and the reconstructive plastic surgeon with expertise in soft tissue coverage and resurfacing (Levin 1993). Many recent advantages in reconstructive surgery have permitted greater salvage and more rapid restoration of the structure and function of injured upper extremity (Vasconez 1993). Stabilization, fixation and distraction of bony segments have been a key element in improving results. No less important has been the demonstration that rapid and optimal soft tissue reconstruction has a direct impact on the treatment of the limb as a whole. The primary goal of upper extremity reconstruction is to provide key functions such as sensory contact with the environment and the ability to manipulate objects. Described as the extension of the brain, the hand is the focus of reconstructive efforts and because the shoulder, arm and forearm permit the hand to accomplish all of its complex tasks, it is important to maintain or restore their function. The mangled upper extremity is a combination of injury to bones, joints, nerves and soft tissues. Skeletal stability is the basis for all other reconstruction, the initial management of the fracture sets the stage for subsequent events. It is beyond the scope of this chapter to go through all methods of fracture stabilization. Regardless what type of fixation is used, the importance of stable bone fixation must be emphasized, because the vascular, functional and soft tissue reconstruction depend on a stable skeleton. This chapter is limited to soft tissue coverage and reconstruction of the shoulder and brachium because the focus is on pedicled muscle and musculocutaneous flaps. The optimal timing of the soft tissue reconstruction in the severely traumatized upper extremity remains controversial. The argument favoring staged procedures is the need for a second look debridement (Gustilo et al 1990). If there is uncertainty about traumatized and devascularized tissue, a second look is done to allow more adequate debridement. The main argument for early reconstruction is to reduce the nosocomial contamination and secondary necrosis of exposed tissues. Late soft tissue reconstruction is associated with a significantly higher infection and flap complication rate when compared with early (within 72 hours) soft tissue coverage (Hertel et al 1999). We\n\nPedicled muscle and musculocutaneous flaps\n\n25\n\nbelieve, that the overall timing of the soft tissue reconstruction should ideally be immediate or as soon as possible. In questionable cases we use Godinas’s principles, a second look and soft tissue reconstruction within 72 hours past the injury (Godina 1986). Although various pedicled muscle and musculocutaneous flaps have been described for soft tissue reconstruction of the shoulder and brachium (Palmer and Miller 1988, Vasconez and Oishi 1993), we found almost all wounds to be manageable by either the pedicled latissimus dorsi flap or its anterior homologue, the pectoralis major muscle flap. There are certainly other choices, but these two flaps were found to have dependable and consistent anatomy, long vascular pedicles, providing reliable and predictable results and therefore becoming the workhorses of reconstructions for severe injuries to the shoulder and brachium (Dowden and McCraw 1980, Stern and Carey 1988, Minami et al 1990). Apart from traumatic soft tissue loss they are very useful in contaminated wounds of the shoulder and in wounds caused by radiation. Ger, Chang and Mathes demonstrated the value of muscle flaps in the treatment of osteomyelitis, which are more resistant to bacterial infection and rapidly recover from inoculation with bacterial suspension (Ger 1977, Chang and Mathes 1982, Mathes et al 1982). This suggests that muscle flaps in general are ideally suited for the treatment of osteomyelitic lesions. In addition, the transposition of the latissimus dorsi has been used to restore flexion or extension of the elbow (Hovnanian 1956, Zancolli and Mitre 1973). Furthermore, we have used transfer of the latissimus and pectoralis major musculocutaneous flaps as an adjunct in the treatment of patients who had chronic osteomyelitis and septic arthritis of the shoulder.\n\nSurgical anatomy Pedicled latissimus dorsi flap Extensive experience with the latissimus dorsi has shown it to be perhaps the most reliable and versatile of known flaps. It is the largest muscle in the body and is roughly quadrangular in shape, originating from the lumbar fascia and posterior part of the pelvis and inserting on the posterior aspect of the intertubercular groove of the humerus. Using the latissimus dorsi flap has resulted in no major demonstrable functional deficit. Its vascular supply is derived from the subscapular artery that bifurcates into the scapular circumflex and thoracodorsal arteries. The thoracodorsal artery continues posteriorly and inferiorly, giving off branches to the serratus anterior muscle. It enters the latissimus muscle together with the thoracodorsal nerve and vein at a well-defined neurovascular hilus, 2–3 cm medial to the lateral edge of the latissimus dorsi muscle and about 5 cm distal to the inferior scapular border. A secondary blood supply comes from several small perforator vessels along the spinous origin of the latissimus dorsi muscle. Based on the thoracodorsal artery, the rotation point is predictably located near the apex of the axilla posteriorly. This rotation point gives the flap an arc that allows it to reach the entire shoulder posteriorly and the upper arm. When the latissimus is used for reconstruction of the area of the upper arm and shoulder, the patient is placed in the lateral decubitus position and the entire hemithorax and the area of the arm that is to be reconstructed are prepared. The arm is left free to facilitate exposure and mobilization of the flap. Every soft tissue reconstruction starts\n\nSevere traumatic defects of the upper limb\n\n26\n\nwith a thorough debridement and removal of all devitalized tissues from the area to be reconstructed. After the debridement it can be decided whether a functional muscle transfer, a muscle flap plus split thickness skin graft or musculocutaneous latissimus dorsi flap is best suited for the existing defect. Horizontal incisions can be used to gain access to the muscle, but a vertical incision is more direct and expedient. The incision begins on the posterior aspect of the posterior axillary fold and is carried further parallel to the main axis of the muscle fibers. The skin on either side is dissected off the muscle. After the muscle is exposed, dissection is carried onto its undersurface, starting at the axilla, with care taken to preserve the thoracodorsal artery on the undersurface of the muscle. The latissimus dorsi muscle is elevated off the chest wall. It is best to first cut distally along the iliac crest, which then gives better exposure for dividing the attachments to the thoracolumbar fascia and scapula. After the muscle has been fully elevated, the humeral insertion as well as the branch of the thoracodorsal artery to the serratus muscle needs to be divided if the full arc of rotation is required. For flap inset the latissimus dorsi muscle can be passed anteriorly to the upper arm or the shoulder through a tunnel. If the tunnel is felt to be too tight full extension of the incision to the defect is required to rule out compromise or torque of the pedicle. When a flexorplasty is performed to restore elbow flexion, either the coracoid or the acromion process is exposed by a deltopectoral incision, and the biceps tendon is exposed by a separate incision distally. Both incisions are connected by means of a subcutaneous tunnel situated on the anterior aspect of the arm. The former origin of the latissimus dorsi muscle is passed through the tunnel and is sutured into the biceps tendon. Next, the humeral insertion of the latissimus is fixed proximally to the coracoid or the acromion. The upper extremity is immobilized with the elbow in 100° flexion and full supination for 6 weeks in a posterior plaster splint. At this juncture active motion of the shoulder motion and elbow is initiated. The latissimus dorsi muscle can as well be utilized to restore elbow extension in cases of triceps palsy or traumatic loss of the triceps muscle. The humeral insertion is left intact and the origin is sutured to the triceps tendon, the periosteum of the olecranon and the connective tissue muscle septa on the extensor surface of the forearm. Pedicled pectoralis major flap The pectoralis major muscle is located in the anterior chest wall and in many ways matches the characteristics of the latissimus dorsi muscle. The pectoralis major is particularly useful for the repair of anterior shoulder defects. The pectoralis can be dissected out from beneath the skin, rotated into position, and split skin applied to its exposed surface, or it can be used as a myocutaneous flap. The pectoralis muscle receives its main blood supply from the thoracoacromial artery, a branch of the subclavian artery. This main vascular axis runs on the undersurface of the pectoralis major muscle and can be identified by Doppler preoperatively. In addition there are numerous perforating vessels from the internal mammary artery. For use in reconstruction of shoulder defects, the muscle can survive solely on the thoracoacromial axis and the chest wall perforators can be safely divided. When elevated upon the thoracoacromial axis, whether as a myocutaneous flap or as a muscle flap alone, the pectoralis major has as its rotation axis a point 2 cm below and slightly medial to the\n\nPedicled muscle and musculocutaneous flaps\n\n27\n\ncoracoid process. Swinging upon this axis, the tip of the flap can completely cover the acromion, or head of the humerus. For flap harvest an oblique incision is marked from the coracoid down to either side of the nipple. The skin on either side is then elevated off the fascia of the pectoralis muscle. Once the entire muscle is exposed, dissection proceeds around its lateral margin on the chest wall. Care is taken to leave the pectoralis minor muscle and clavipectoral fascia intact. The fibers of origin of the pectoralis major are dissected bluntly off the chest wall, dividing the perforating branches of the internal mammary artery. When the pectoralis has been dissected free from the chest wall, it can be elevated and rotated into place. The effective length and reach of the flap is improved by dividing the insertion of the pectoralis major muscle. The pectoralis major muscle is quite vascular and accepts a skin graft readily. The donor wound can be closed primarily. If a skin component is incorporated we prefer situating the skin island above the pectoralis muscle. The pectoralis can also be used for biceps reconstruction, but requires lengthening of fascia to reach the biceps tendon.\n\nIllustrative case reports Case 1 A 54-year-old patient presented with right elbow osteomyelitis and concomitant brachial plexus palsy after a gun shot wound (Fig. 1a). The patient underwent repeated irrigation and debridement including bony debridement with a high-speed burr until punctuate bleeding (the socalled paprika sign) as an indication for healthy bone was obtained. The soft tissue coverage was performed with a pedicled latissimus dorsi island flap (Fig. 1b– d). Case 2 A 36-year-old female patient was admitted for treatment of deep shoulder infection after radiotherapy, chemotherapy and partial resection of the scapula, resection of the proximal humerus and lateral clavicle (Tikhoff–Linberg resection) for a malignant ossifying fibromyxoid tumor (Fig. 2a). During the tumor resection there was also involvement of the brachial plexus, which had to\n\nSevere traumatic defects of the upper limb\n\n28\n\nFigure 1 (a) Chronic right elbow osteomyelitis.

After thorough debridement the soft tissue defect at the shoulder measured 5 × 12 cm and was closed with a pedicled latissimus dorsi island flap. The patient is disease free since 18 months, shows no sign of infection and her pain status was classified as mild (Fig. 2b).\n\nPedicled muscle and musculocutaneous flaps\n\n29\n\nFigure 2 (a) Deep right shoulder infection.

Case 3 A 44-year-old patient had a severe, fulminant infection of the superficial fascia and subcutaneous tissue known as necrotizing fasciitis of the right upper extremity. The initial surgical incision revealed the pathognomonic liquefactive necrosis of the subcutaneous tissue and fascia with the characteristic appearance of grayish, watery and foul smelling fluid often referred to as ‘dishwater pus’. Immediate radical debridement was carried out well beyond the margins of the cellulitis. Repeated debridement including resection of the triceps muscle was warranted on a 12–24 hour\n\nSevere traumatic defects of the upper limb\n\n30\n\nFigure 3 (a) Right upper extremity after repeated debridement in a case of necrotizing fasciitis.

For functional restoration of the elbow extension a pedicled myocutaneous latissimus dorsi flap was used.

The patient showed active drainage from an infected glenohumeral joint (Fig. 4a). After debridement, the patient was left with a soft tissue defect located at the anterior aspect of the shoulder, which was closed using a pectoralis major island flap (Fig. 4b). The flap was harvested from distally to proximally and the skin island on top of the muscle was rotated into the shoulder defect (Fig. 4c–f). Postoperatively the range of motion of the shoulder was limited (Fig. 4g). The patient achieved 40° forward elevation, 30° lateral elevation and 30° external rotation. However, 7 years after the operation the patient showed stable wound coverage, there was no sign of infection and the patient was pain free.\n\nFigure 4(a,b) (a) Infected right glenohumeral joint.

Orthopedic and plastic surgeons are frequently called on to treat these injuries. Injuries to the upper extremity should be treated acutely, definitively, and comprehensively. Collaboration between the orthopedic and plastic surgeons in the treatment plan is essential if the patient is to obtain the best result. The transfer of the pedicled latissimus dorsi flap and pectoralis major flap prove to be useful not only to restore elbow flexion and extension but also provide regional coverage of the soft tissue about the shoulder and brachium. In addition, we have successfully used both muscle flaps as an adjunct in the management of chronic osteomyelitis and septic arthritis of the shoulder and elbow.\n\nReferences Bunnell S (1970) Surgery of the Hand.

For larger defects, it is necessary to use flaps from distant donor sites. The past two decades have seen major changes in reconstructive surgery of the upper extremity (Buncke and Schulz 1966, Bunck et al 1966, Cobbett JR 1969, Ikuta et al 1976, Yang and Gu 1979). The most important changes have been the timing of the reconstruction and the quality of transferred tissues available. Following the description of axial pattern flaps, the traditional teaching of length to breadth ratio in flap design became obsolete (McGregor and Morgan 1973, Cormack and Lamberty 1984). Large defects could thus be resurfaced immediately, but the hand still had to be attached to the body. For many patients, this resulted in unnecessary joint immobilization, stiffness and tenodesis. The advantages of the free flap over the distant pedicle in upper limb reconstruction are well documented. Free tissue transfers usually require only one operation and often allow all other reconstructive procedures to be done in a single stage (Höpfner 1903, Lapchinsky 1960, Komatsu and Taimai 1968, Biemer 1977a, Biemer and Duspira 1982, Costa 1994). Free flaps bring new blood supply to the reconstructed area, whereas the distant pedicle flap is parasitic on the recipient site after division of the pedicle. Free flaps also allow elevation of the hand and immediate motion. Physical therapy is started as soon as the patient recovers from anaesthesia, and reduces postoperative oedema and stiffness. None of this is possible when pedicle flaps are used, as they restrict the mobility of the hand and all joints proximal to the site of injury. Pedicle flaps still play an important part in the reconstruction of the hand that is, to provide extra skin cover. The groin flap fulfils an important role as a skin provider prior to toe transfer in cases of extensive soft tissue loss on the hand. As a pedicle flap it does not require dissection around the main arteries of the hand, which thus may be saved for use when the toe or toes are subsequently transferred. Its donor site is inconspicuous, thus it is a first choice in females. The distally based posterior interosseous fasciocutaneous island flap also has all these advantages, except the donor site is not inconspicuous. It is the author’s first choice for hand skin resurfacing (Fig. 1) (Costa and Soutar 1988, Costa et al 1988, 1991, 1996, Costa 1994).\n\nSevere traumatic defects of the upper limb\n\n36\n\nPrinciples of management A complex injury to the upper limb can be defined as one that involves two or more tissues of the limb and which jeopardizes upper limb function or survival. There are two major dangers, which arise in the immediate post trauma phase. The first is devascularization, which leads to necrosis and threatens the local survival of a particular structure. The second is oedema and its inevitable sequela, stiffness, which may severely impair the final functional result (Burke 1971, Robson et al 1974, Janzekovic 1975, Nylen and Carlsson 1980). Microsurgery has proved to be a powerful tool in the treatment of these two complications, by allowing arterial repair and hence revascularization and also venous repair to improve circulatory return and help combat oedema. The overall beneficial effects of improved vascularization include a favourable influence on the healing of skin, bone, tendon, nerve and other structures (Costa 1994).\n\nFigure 1(a–f)\n\nFree flaps\n\n37\n\nFigure 1(g,h) (a,b) Defect before and after debridement with exposed bones.

Immediate skin cover is preceded by thorough debridement of all dead tissue (Janzekovic 1975, Guofan et al 1981). The simplest method of obtaining skin cover is to use skin grafts but this requires a vascularized bed and immobilization to allow a satisfactory graft to take. Regional arm and forearm flaps have revolutionized skin cover of the upper extremity and form part of the reconstructive armamentarium. The main indications for a free flap in upper extremity reconstruction are where no local or regional flap can be used, extensive lesions of the arm, forearm and hand. Where specific large tissue losses are present the free flaps can be used as functional muscle, tendons, nerves, bone and fingers (Costa 1994). Many free flaps are available for use in reconstruction of the upper extremity. Choosing a flap with minimum donor site morbidity is a primary consideration in reconstructive surgery. With the current variety of free flaps, coverage may be tailored to the needs of the upper extremity recipient site, matching soft tissue, skin thickness, texture and colour. Thus, the defect to be reconstructed must be assessed for its need for bulk and surface cover. The selection of the flap will be governed, in part, by this assessment. In general, muscle flaps are used when defects require a relatively large volume flap and fascial and fasciocutaneous flaps are used to provide less bulky surface cover or a functional reconstruction.\n\nSevere traumatic defects of the upper limb\n\n38\n\nMuscle and musculocutaneous flaps (Table 1) These have the advantage that they can be placed between structures, thus filling what otherwise would be dead space. They well vascularize the areas in which they are placed and are helpful in treating both acute defects and defects left by debridement of bone following chronic osteomyelitis (Mathes and Nahai 1982). The muscle tissue is also quite useful for transfer as a functioning unit when microneurovascular anastomoses are performed (Fig. 2f–h) (Ikuta et al 1976, Manktelow and McKee 1978, Schenk 1978, Mathes and Nahai 1982).\n\nFascial and fasciocutaneous flaps (Table 2) These are excellent for coverage of large surfaces, although they lack the bulk to fill dead space. They result in minimal donor site morbidity and do not restrict range of motion in the\n\nTable 1 Musculocutaneous free tissue transfers.

Osteomyofasciocutaneous flaps These have specific indications for reconstruction of bone defects in the upper limb. These include the length of the defect, quality of surrounding soft tissue, malignancy (where chemotherapy or irradiation may be considered postoperatively and it is essential to maintain bone support while awaiting union and hypertrophy) and a record of prior failed conventional bone grafting techniques. Any long bone defect exceeding 8–10 cm in the upper limb should be considered for reconstruction by vascularized bone transfer. Shorter defects may warrant consideration if there are additional factors such as a poor surrounding soft tissue milieu due to prior infection or multiple surgical procedures. Management of extraarticular long bone defects in the upper extremity may be amenable to a variety of reconstructive measures including shortening, cancellous or corticocancellous autografts, synostosis, bone transport, vascularized bone grafts, diaphyseal allografts and metallic prosthetic replacement. Shortening and bone grafting in some form are the most widely applied techniques (Allien et al 1981, Dell and Sheppard 1984). The choice of the bone free flap is not a difficult task, since for the overwhelming majority of upper limb bone defects (for which a microvascular bone graft is indicated) the fibula is the preferred donor bone. A number of factors favour the fibula. A length of up to 30 cm can be obtained and the diameter of the fibula approximates that of the radius and ulna. For humerus reconstruction the fibular diameter permits intramedullary placement and demonstrates the ability to hypertrophy to the size of the diaphysis of the humerus. The cortical structure of the fibula permits excellent internal fixation potential with plates and/or screws. For radius and ulnar reconstructions, the fibula has a similar diameter to the diaphyses of the forearm bones. Frequently, for radius reconstruction the distal fibula end may be impaled into the distal radius metaphyseal flare (Pho 1979, Weiland et al 1979, Wood 1987, Zhong-Jia 1987). The anterior iliac crest based on the deep circumflex iliac vessels may occasionally be useful for reconstruction near the distal metaphysis of long bones or for reconstruction of a bony defect in the carpus. The author has encountered a situation of extensive carpal osteomyelitis where, after total bone carpal removal, a vascularized anterior iliac crest free flap was successfully transferred.\n\nFree flaps\n\n43\n\nEmergency free flaps The concept of emergency free tissue transfer was developed by Marko Godina (1986). In a series of 134 upper and lower limb traumatic injuries, 80% of the flaps were transferred immediately following the patient’s admission to hospital and 20% within 72 hours after injury, so defining the group of early free flaps. Lister and Scheker (1988) defined the emergency free flap as the flap transferred for coverage of soft tissue defects at the time of the first surgical procedure and during the first 24 hours after injury. The idea that the probability of failure of free tissue transfer is greater if done as an emergency procedure, still exists. Godina’s experience clearly demonstrated the opposite—his failure rate in 134 emergency and early free flaps transfers was 0.75%, compared with a 12% failure rate observed in his series of 167 delayed reconstructions (Godina 1986). Lister and Scheker (1988) reported 6.05% failure rate in 31 emergency free flaps; Arnez (1993) reinforced the concept with his 3% failure rate in 100 emergency free flaps. Costa et al (1997a) report a series of nine acute free flaps in head, upper and lower limb injuries with no postoperative infections and no failures, definitively confirming the reliability of the free flap concept. Combined orthopaedic and plastic surgery teams dealing with major trauma must follow strict principles of management to develop the most efficient approach for extensive wounds with large zones of injury. The first aim is to control infection and the principle is radical debridement (Janzekovic 1975, Haury et al 1978). Infection is present in granulation tissue which is poorly penetrated by systemic antibiotics (Burke 1971, Robson et al 1974). Nylen and Carlsson’s study, on upper extremity trauma treated with a conservative approach and serial debridement, had a 52% infection rate, while Godina reported a 17.5% infection rate during treatment of 167 grade III traumatic injuries on both lower and upper extremities (Nylen and Carlsson 1980, Godina 1986). The infection rate in 134, 31, 100 and 9 patients dropped drastically to 1.5% (Godina 1986), 9.7% (Lister and Scheker 1988), 2% (Arnez 1993) and 0% (Costa et al 1997a) respectively when these authors analysed their series of radical debridement and emergency free flap reconstructions.\n\nSevere traumatic defects of the upper limb\n\n44\n\nFigure 3 (a) Crush-degloving injury involving the dorsum of the left hand, with loss of skin and extensor tendons of the index, middle, ring and little fingers with tangential bone losses of the 2nd and 3rd metacarpal bones in a dental surgeon. (b) Marking of the tendofasciocutaneous dorsalis pedis flap on the dorsum of the left foot. (c) Raised flap, including long extensor tendons of the 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th toes, great saphenous vein, dorsalis pedis vessels and superficial peroneal nerve. (d–f) Appearance at 13 months after surgery. Good functional result of extension and flexion of the fingers. Good cosmetic result due to the similarities of the skin between the dorsum of the foot and hand. Open wounds are subject to further loss of tissues and extension of the zone of injury due to bone and tendon desiccation and formation of granulation tissue (Godina 1986,\n\nFree flaps\n\n45\n\nLister and Scheker 1988, Arnez 1993, Costa et al 1997a). The best surgical exposure of the whole wound is possible immediately after radical debridement, when there is no tissue fibrosis, friability or granulation, no anatomical structures displacement by wound contracture and no retraction of recipient blood vessels which still have integrity of their walls. For these reasons the success rate is higher in all series of emergency and early free flap transfers compared with the series of serial debridement and delayed wound closure. Nowadays, free tissue transfer is not a lengthy and unpredictable procedure. The entire initial procedure, which always includes debridement and frequently bone fixation, tendon repair, revascularization and even nerve grafting, should average under 5 hours for small defects, under 8 hours for medium defects and under 12 hours for large defects (Lister 1988, Lister and Scheker 1988). In our series, the longest procedures were all related to the flow-through radial midforearm flaps for coverage–revascularization and coverage–reimplantation, taking on average 10 hours. The total operating time per patient is in fact reduced, since the main reconstruction is accomplished in a single big operative procedure. Our shortest operative procedures took 7 hours (Costa et al 1997a). Cost effectiveness should also be considered. In Godina’s series the average length of hospital stay was 27 days and the average number of operations was 1.3 per patient (Godina 1986). In Lister and Scheker’s (1988) series of upper extremity injuries the average hospital stay was 11.8 days and 27 out of 31 patients returned to work, 18 of them to their previous employment. In Arnez’s (1993) series of 100 emergency free flaps the hospitalization ranged between 14 to 25 days. In our series the average hospital stay was 27.8 days (range 20–44 days) and the average number of operations was 2 per patient (Costa et al 1997a). Age is not a contraindication for the use of acute free flaps as clearly demonstrated by Lister (1988); the youngest patient on whom this author has performed an early free flap was 2.5 years old, the oldest was 76 and both did well. This point is also reinforced by our series in which the youngest patient was 4 years old and the oldest 65 (Costa et al 1997a). Thus, emergency free flaps have proved to be a more reliable technique than delayed wound closure, offering the patient an effective method of reconstruction with significant advantages in postoperative form and function. One-stage coverage and revascularization of traumatized limbs by a flowthrough radial mid-forearm free flap On analysing all the described axial flaps, one finds that few have the capacity to allow a flowthrough circulation. The theoretical idea of flow-through circulation was suggested by Soutar et al (1983) for head and neck reconstruction, that is, establishing an uninterrupted arter ial flow through a flap between the external carotid and distal facial artery. It was also suggested by Cormack and Lamberty (1984) with the use of Siamese or sister flaps in which a flap could be attached onto the end of another flap. Lamberty and Cormack (1983) reported one clinical case of head and neck reconstruction in which they used an antecubital fasciocutaneous free flap to reconstruct an excisional defect after removal of a squamous cell carcinoma, involving the left pinna and external auditory meatus. The proximal end of the divided facial artery was\n\nSevere traumatic defects of the upper limb\n\n46\n\nanastomosed to the proximal end of the radial artery and the distal end of the radial artery was looped back to be anastomosed to the distal end of the facial artery. The flaps which were considered suitable for this were the antecubital forearm flap (Lamberty and Cormack 1983) and the radial forearm flap (Lamberty and Cormack 1983, Soutar et al 1983). Costa et al (1991b) described the practical use of this concept in two clinical cases (hand and foot) in which uninterrupted arterial and venous flow was established through the radial mid-forearm fasciocutaneous flap, allowing revascularization of the ischaemic extremity (Fig. 4). The clinical importance of this concept is paramount. Exposure of deep structures, like tendons, nerves and/or bone with vascular damage which often accompanies major trauma of the extremities, may warrant flap cover with its own blood supply. If the clinical situation is complicated by ischaemia of the distal segment (hand or foot), we are dealing with a double problem of coverage and revascularization. In this type of situation, the choice of soft tissue reconstruction is not just dependent on the immediate problem of wound closure, the quality of the"
