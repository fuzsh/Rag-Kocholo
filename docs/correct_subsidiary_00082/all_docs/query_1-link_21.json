This Hotline Response provides information about Effi- cacy of Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Vaccines for Prevention of Cervical Cancer. To prepare this Hotline Response we consulted a number of infor- mation resources. We provide a description of these resources, including a complete outline of the databases we searched, our search strategies, and the search results at the end of this Response. ECRI has published a related Hotline (1); to access this and other materials on HPV, search the HTAIS Web site using the search term: HPV. General Comments: About Human Papillomavirus The human papillomavirus (HPV) is a sexually transmitted virus carried by over half of the sexually active population in the United States. Preva- lence estimates of HPV in the United States range from 6.2 million to 20 NOTE: These reports are provided as examples and are not intended to represent an en- dorsement by the committee. â Reprinted, with permission, from ECRI 2006. Copyright 2007 by ECRI Institute. 205\n\n206 KNOWING WHAT WORKS IN HEALTH CARE million people. In most people, the infection is entirely asymptomatic and causes no disease. However, in some people, HPV can cause genital or anal warts, recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP) lesions, and/or cancer, most notably of the cervix. Cervical cancer is the 11th most common can- cer among US women, and the second most common cause of cancer in women worldwide. An estimated 9,710 new cases of cervical cancer will occur in the United States alone in 2006, and 3,700 women will die from it. Although the conditions it causes may be treatable, HPV infection has no treatment, and use of condoms may not prevent HPV transmission. (See Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) links in section 8 of the Search Summary) Other cancers thought to be caused by HPV include vaginal, vulvar, and head and neck cancer. Additional information on HPV and HPV-Â­related diseases can be found through the Web sites listed in sec- tion 8 of the Search Summary. About HPV Vaccines Two major pharmaceutical companies have developed vaccines for HPV. These vaccines are administered in three injections: at day 1, month 2, and month 6. There are over 100 known strains of HPV, but only a few have been causally associated with cancer. Vaccines are intended to protect against the most dangerous strains of HPV. The following paragraphs include details from an Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices meeting held at the CDC in February 2006 regarding these vaccines. (See link in section 8 of the Search Summary) GlaxoSmithKline has produced a recombinant vaccine (Cervarix) against HPV strains 16 and 18, which are the strains responsible for 70% of cases of cervical cancer. This vaccine has been tested in 1,113 women for over two years. It was found to be well tolerated, with minimal, minor adverse events. It was also found to be highly efficacious, with 100% protection against persistent HPV (meaning the infection has not resolved within six months and is therefore more likely to lead to pathological changes) caused by the target strains. Through the follow-up period, 93% of patients had normal pap smears. 53 months after vaccination, 98% of patients still had HPV antigens thought to be protective. Phase III studies enrolling more than 30,000 patients internationally are currently underway. Merck & Co. has developed a vaccine (Gardasil) against HPV strains 16 and 18, as well as strains 6 and 11. Together, these strains account for more than 90% of cases of genital warts and RRP, in addition to protect- ing against cervical cancer. This vaccine has also been studied in men, who can develop cancer, RRP, and genital warts from HPV. In addition, men can transmit the virus to women, potentially causing cervical cancer in\n\nAPPENDIX E 207 their partners. The clinical trial for this vaccine enrolled 27,000 women and children in four continents. Thus far, results have been analyzed for 20,541 recipients, and 100% prophylactic efficacy has been found for cer- vical, vaginal, and vulvar cancers caused by HPT strains 16 and 18. It was also found to be efficacious in preventing re-infection in women who had previously been infected with HPV. Reported serious (unspecified) adverse events were low, affecting 0.4% of 27,000 women. The US Food and Drug Administration advisory panel on Vaccines and Related Biological Products has recommended approval of Merck & Co.âs application to market Gardasil. Formal approval by the FDA was received on June 8, 2006. Documents presented to the committee and final approval documents can be viewed through the Web sites listed in section 6 of the Search Summary. Recent Clinical Literature Our searches identified 14 randomized, controlled trials (RCTs), 37 tradi- tional reviews, and 3 cost analyses. These publications are categorized in Table 1. We subdivided the RCTs by clinical outcomes (e.g. persistent infec- tion and other treatment-requiring conditions) and intermediate outcomes (e.g. antibody titers). Since clinical outcomes are of more importance in healthcare, we summarized findings for these RCTs in Table 2. Although no evidenceÂ­-based conclusions can be drawn from abstracts, the results appear promising. The three cost analyses found that vaccinating for HPV should be less costly than frequently screening for its effects (i.e. administer- ing pap smears annually rather than tri-annually) and treating its sequelae (i.e. repeated pap smears, colposcopy, LEEP (loop electrosurgical excision procedure) for dysplasia, and cancer treatments).

Be- cause abstracts do not always accurately reflect the methods and findings of the full-length article or the limits on interpreting the published data, the reader is strongly encouraged to obtain the relevant articles before reaching conclusions about this technology. As such, ECRI has not evalu- ated the quality of these study designs, nor have we determined whether the authors used appropriate statistical methods to analyze their data. We are reluctant to comment on the reliability of these results in the absence of such evaluations. The purpose of this Hotline Response is to provide\n\nAPPENDIX E 209 you with a summary of the literature based on our searches, and to give you information about what this technology is purported to accomplish. This Response is not intended to provide specific guidance for the care of individual patients. Selected References Note: In preparing the Hotline Response, information specialists research the topic and compile a Bibliography. We exclude individual case reports because they may not represent routine use. Technical articles are also excluded unless they include clinical trial results. In writing the Hotline Response analysts screen the Bibliography for references relevant to the topic, and these are provided below in the narrower list of Selected References. References also include relevant ECRI content on your topic including ECRI documents that are not part of your HTAIS membership benefits. For an electronic copy of any non-HTAIS ECRI documents that are ref- erenced in your Hotline Response, please contact the Hotline Service.

The search was limited to English-language human clinical trials and review articles published in the last 5 years. Description of Search Results There is a small body of published literature available related to platelet-rich plasma (PRP) for bone healing and fusion. Twelve abstracts were found, inÂ­cluding 1 randomized controlled trial (n=10), 7 clinical studies (n=20 to 180), and 1 case report (n=3). In addition, 2 review articles and 1 article comparÂ­ing different com- mercially available methods of point-of-care platelet gel preparation were also retrieved. The clinical studies described the use of PRP for various orthopedic pro- cedures, including tibial osteotomy, foot and ankle surgery, total ankle arthroplasty, Charcotâs foot reconstruction, total knee arthroplasty, and lumbar fusion. Regulatory Agency Information Administration of PRP is a procedure and is, therefore, not subject to regulation by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). However, the devices used to prepare PRP are regulated by the FDA premarket approval process. Several centrifuge devices have been approved by the FDA for preparation of PRP, The GPSÂ® Plate- let Separation Kit (Biomet Inc.) is one example of an approved centrifuge device associated in the literature with the use of PRP for orthopedic applications. Biomet Inc. received 510(k) approval (K030555) for the GPS Platelet Separation Kit on April 11, 2003. It is designed for use in the clinical laboratory or intraopera- tively at the point of care, for the safe and effective preparation of platelet-poor plasma and platelet concentrate from a small sample (50-60 ml) of whole blood. Below are some of the centrifuge devices approved for platelet separation listed in the FDA 510(k) database.

Conclusions There is sufficient evidence to assess the safety and efficacy of PRP for bone healing for ankle indications. An assessment of this technology will be proÂ­vided in a Hayes Health Technology Brief and/or Hayes Medical Technology Directory report as permitted by our production schedule, with priority given to frequently requested topics. Other Relevant Information Of the estimated 5.6 million fractures that occur annually in the United States, ap- proximately 5% to 10% will demonstrate signs of impaired healing, which results in either delayed union or nonunion of the fracture. PRP contains growth factors that maybe useful in healing nonunion fractures. AlÂ­so known as platelet gel, or platelet concentrate, PRP is a blood product that is created by isolating and concentrat- ing platelets from the patientâs own blood. A centrifuge is used in this process to separate the blood into layers; the middle layer, or âbuffy coat,â contains plasma with concentrated platelets. PRP contains many growth factors, including platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), transforming growth factor (TGF-beta1), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-l), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). These proteins may pro- mote bone formation, but they are not universally recognized to be osteoinductive, or capable of inducing new bone growth. PRP may be mixed with bone grafting materials or applied during orthopedic surgery, with the hope it will facilitate the bone healing process. Currently, PRP is generally used as a graft extender and not as a replacement for the actual bone graft. Manufacturer Sites: Listed below are some manufacturers of centrifuge devices.

Arthroscopic ankle arthrodesis: factors influencing union in 39 consecutive patients. Collman DR. Kaas MH. Schuberth JM. Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Kaiser Permanente Medical Group, Modesto, CA, USA. BACKGROUND: Arthroscopic ankle arthrodesis is an effective alternative to open techniques with established advantages in select patient populations. The purpose of this study was to evaluate patients who had arthroscopic an- kle arthrodesis for end-stage arthritis with minimal to no deformity of the ankle and to report factors influencing union. METHODS: Thirty-nine consecutive patients had arthroscopic ankle arthrodeÂ­sis between 1994 and 2003. Clinical records and radiographs were retrospectively reviewed to evaluate variable that could predispose paÂ­tients to nonunion. Union outcomes were correlated with etiology of arthritis, ankle deformity, medical co-morbidities, and the use of deminerÂ­alized bone matrix or platelet-rich plasma. Arthroscopic ankle arthrodesis was accomplished with a consistent technique using crossed transÂ­malleolar cannulated screw fixation. RESULTS: Thirty-four of 39 patients (87.2%) achieved radiographic and clinical union. The average time to fusion was 47 (range 37 to 70) days. Poor bone quality and inherent positional ankle deformity were identified as risk factors for nonunion. Patients who smoked, had diabetes rnellitus, peripheral neuropathy, or other medical co-morbidi- ties attained ankle union in nearly all cases, In obese patients, there was an observed trend towards ankle nonunion (relative risk 5.81, p = 0.049, Fishers Exact test). The addition of demÂ­ineralized bone matrix or platelet-rich plasma did not improve the rate of ankle union. Aside from nonunion, 10 patients de- veloped minor comÂ­plications. CONCLUSION: Arthroscopic ankle arthrodesis achieves high union rates, facilitates short time to union, and permits rapid patient mobility. Careful patient selection is important for the procedure. Syn- thetic allograft or platelet-rich plasma did not enhance the fusion rate. Obese patients showed a trend towards nonunion in this series.

Department of Extra Corporeal Blood Management, Catharina Hospital, Eind- hoven, The Netherlands. everts@elive.nl Strategies to reduce blood loss and transfusion of allogeneic blood products\n\n222 KNOWING WHAT WORKS IN HEALTH CARE during surgical procedures are important in modern times. The most important and well-known autologous techniques are preoperative autologous predona- tion, hemodilution, perioperative red cell salvage, postoperative wound blood autotransfusion, and pharmacologic modulation of the hemostatic process. At present, new developments in the preparation of preoperative autologous blood component therapy by whole blood platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and platelet-poor plasma (PPP) sequestration have evolved, This technique has been proven to reduce the number of allogeneic blood transfusions during open heart surgery and orthopedic operations. Moreover, platelet gel and fi- brin sealant derived from PRP and PPP mixed with thrombin, respectively, can be exÂ­ogenously applied to tissues to promote wound healing, bone growth, and tissue sealing. However, to our disappointment, not many well-deÂ­signed scientific studies are available, and many anecdotic stories exist, whereas questions remain to be answered. We therefore decided to study periopera- tive blood management in more detail with emphasis on the application and production of autologous platelet gel and the use of fibrin sealant. This review addresses a large variety of aspects relevant to platelets, platelet-rich plasma, and the application of platelet gel. In addition, an overview of recent animal and human studies is presented. Publication Types: Review UI: 16921694 3: Advances in Therapy. 23(2):218-37, 2006 Mar-Apr. Autologous platelet-rich plasma for wound and osseous healing: a review of the literature and commercially available products. Roukis TS. Zgonis T. Tiernan B. Limb Preservation Service, Department of Vascular Surgery MCHJ-SV, Ma- digan Army Medical Center, Tacoma, Washington 98431, USA. The application of autologous platelets that have been sequestered, con- centrated, and mixed with thrombin to create growth factor-concentratÂ­ed, autologous platelet-rich plasma for application to soft tissue wounds and for osseous healing has been a subject of great interest for much of the past 2 decades. Autologous platelet-rich plasma, which consists of both quantitative and qualitative components, has the greatest poÂ­tency or ability to produce the desired effect. Manufacturers prepare autologous platelet-rich plasma with the ultimate goal of maximizing its benefits while minimizing potential risks, Unfortunately, the manufacturing processes for autologous platelet-rich plasma are highly variable, and the types of proprietary systems available on the market for soft tissue and osseous applications are numerous. The authors provide here an in-depth review of commercially available systems for delivery of autologous platelet-rich plasma that emphasizes the subtle yet important differences among systems. In addition, a detailed review of the literature regarding the use of autologous platelet-rich plasma in soft tissue\n\nAPPENDIX E 223 and osseous healing is provided. Although findings are not yet conclusive, autologous platelet-rich plasma has been shown to be safe, reproÂ­ducible, and effective in mimicking the natural processes of soft tissue wound and osseous healing.

Evaluation of bone healing enhancement by lyophilized bone grafts supple- mented with platelet gel: a standardized methodology in patients with tibial osteotomy for genu varus. Savarino L. Cenni F. Tarabusi C. Dallari D. Stagni C. Cenacchi A. Fornasari PM. Giunti A. Baldini N. Laboratory for Pathophysiology of Orthopaedic Implants, Istituti Ortopedioi Rizzoli, Via di Barbiano 1/10, 40136 Bologna, Italy. lucia.savarino@ior.it Orthopedic practice may be adversely affected by an inadequate bone re- pair that might compromise the success of surgery. In recent years, new approaches have been sought to improve bone healing by accelerating the rate of new bone formation and the maturation of the matrix. There is cur- rently great interest in procedures involving the use of platelet gel (PG) to improve tissue healing, with satisfactory results both in vitro and in maxillo- facial surgery. Otherwise, to our knowledge, only a preliminary clinical study was undertaken in the orthopedic field [Kitoh et al., Bone 2004;35:892-898] and the efficacy of PG is still controversial. Our paper focuses on the effect on bone regeneration by adding PG to lyophilized bone chips used for ortho- pedic applications. The clinical model and the laboratory methodology were standardized. As a cliniÂ­cal model, we employed the first series of patients of a randomized case-control study undergoing high tibial osteotomy (HTO) for genu varus. Ten subjects were enrolled: in 5 patients lyophilized bone chips supplemented with PG were inserted during tibial osteotomy (group A); 5 paÂ­tients were used as a control (group B) and lyophilized bone chips without gel were applied. Forty-five days after surgery, computed tomogÂ­raphy scan guided biopsies of grafted areas were obtained and the bone maturation was evaluated by a standardized methodology: the OsÂ­teogenic and angiogenio processes were semi-quantitatively characterized by using histomorphometry, and the mineral component of the lyophilized and host bone was analyzed by using X-ray diffraction technique with sample microfocusing and miororadiog- raphy. Lyophilized bone with PG seems to accelerate the healing process, as shown by new vessel formation and deposition of newly formed bone, with no evÂ­idence of inflammatory cell infiltrate, when compared with lyophilized bone without gel. On the contrary, lyophilized bone undergo a resorpÂ­tion\n\n224 KNOWING WHAT WORKS IN HEALTH CARE process, and a fibrous tissue often fills the spaces between chips. A histio- cytic/giant-cell reaction is sometimes present. Otherwise, no difÂ­ferences have been found concerning microstructure. Our findings show the reliability of the methodology used to monitor early bone repair. The completion of the study and the evaluation of the ultimate clinical outcome are necessary in order to verify PG in vivo effects in orthopedic surgery.

Union rates using autologous platelet concentrate alone and with bone graft in high-risk foot and ankle surgery patients. Bibbo C. Bono CM. Lin SS. Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Marshiceld Clinic, 1000 North Oak Av- enue, Marshfield, WI 54449, USA. bibbo.christopher@marshfieldclinic.org Adjuvant use of autologous platelet concentrate (APC) to assist bone healing in foot and ankle surgery has not been reported. This study exÂ­amined the clinical results and complications after the adjuvant use of APC in high-risk patients undergoing elective foot and ankle surgery. Patients at risk for bone- healing complications were prospectively enrolled over a 6-month period for the intraoperative application of APC. PaÂ­tients were followed every 2 weeks for radiographic union and complications. Sixty-two high-risk patients were enrolled, totaling 123 proceÂ­dures. Mean patient age was 51 years (range, 16-76), there were 36 females and 26 males, and 24 patients were smokers. Overall, a 94% union rate was achieved at a mean of 41 days. For APC alone, the mean time to union was 40 days; when APC was used with autograft, the mean time to union was 45 days (p = .173, two-tailed t-test). These data sug- gest that adjuvant APC results in an acceptable time to union and may be a useful adjunct to promote osseous healing in high-risk patients undergoing elective foot and ankle surgery.

Coetzee JC, Pomeroy GC, Watts JD, Barrow C. Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, University of Minnesota R200, 2450 Riverside Avenue South, Minneapolis, MN 55454, USA. Coetz001@tc.umn. edu BACKGROUND: The Agility (DePuy, Warsaw, Indiana) total ankle replace- ment has been in use since 1984. One of the most common comÂ­plications\n\nAPPENDIX E 225 continues to be delayed union or nonunions of the distal tibiofibular syndes- mosis. In the 1999, 114 Agility total ankle replacements were done at two cenÂ­ters in the United States without the use of autologous reported studies on the Agility ankle the deÂ­layed union and nonunion rate can be as high as 38%. METHODS: Since concentrated growth factors. Since July of 2001, 66 Agility ankles were implanted with Symphony (DePuy, Warsaw, Indiana) augmented bone grafting. The standard operative technique was followed in all the patients. ProspecÂ­tive data was collected on all patients. The standard ankle radiographs were taken preoperatively and postoperative at 8 weeks, 12 weeks, 16 weeks, 6 months, and yearly. CT scans were obtained at 6 months if fusion at the syndesmosis was questionable, The Graphpad Instat softÂ­ware (Graphpad Software Inc., San Diego, CA) was used for statistical analysis. The two-tailed unpaired t-test was used, and the value <0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: There was no statistical difference in the demographic data for the two groups. In 114 ankle replaceÂ­ments without autologous concentrated growth factors 70 fused at 8 weeks (61%), 14 fused at 12 weeks (12%), 13 fused at 6 months (12%). There were 17 nonunions (15%); delayed unions (3 to 6 months) and nonunions, therefore, equaled 27%. The syndesmosis fused in 50 of the 66 ankle replacements (76%) that had autologous concentrated growth fractures at 8 weeks (76%); 12 fused at 3 months (18%). 2 fused at 6 months (3%), 2 had nonunions (3%). Delayed unions (3 to 6 months) and nonunions equaled 6%. There was a statistically significant improveÂ­ment in the 8- and 12-week fusion rates, and a statisti- cally significant reduction in delayed unions and nonunions. CONCLUSION: Autologous concentrated growth factors appear to make a significant positive difference in the syndesmosis union rate in total ankle replacements.

Enhancement of syndesmotic fusion rates in total ankle arthroplasty with the use of autologous platelet concentrate, Barrow CR. Pomeroy GC. Orthopaedic Specialty of Spokane, 785 East Holland Avenue, Spokane, WA 99218, USA. cbarrow@orthospecialtyclinic.com BACKGROUND: One of the challenges of total ankle arthroplasty continues to be achieving a solid distal fusion of the tibiotibular joint. DeÂ­layed union rates of 29% to 38% and the nonunion rates of 9% to 18% for syndesmotic fusion have been documented. The risk of tibial comÂ­ponent migration has been re- ported to increase 8.5 times if a solid syndesmotic fusion is absent. Growth factors have been shown to accelÂ­erate bone healing and may enhance the\n\n226 KNOWING WHAT WORKS IN HEALTH CARE fusion of the syndesmosis and, thereby, decrease the frequency of nonunion and subsequent tibial component migration. METHODS: An autologous plate- let concentrate was used to increase the amount of growth factors at the site of the disÂ­tal tibiofibular joint fusion in 20 total ankle arthroplasties. RESULTS: Our 6-month fusion rate was 100%. When compared to historical controls (6-month fusion rate of 62%) the difference was statistically significant (p CONCLUSION: The improved rate of distal tibiofibular fusion may be attribut- able to the increased presence of growth factors provided by an autologous platelet concentrate.

Puno RM. Leatherman Spine Center, Louisville, Kentucky 40202, USA. lcarreon@spinemds.com STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect on fusion of adding platelet gel to autologous iliac crest graft. SUM- MARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Platelet gel is an osteoinductive material prepared by ultra-concentration of platelets and conÂ­tains multiple growth fac- tors. Proprietary commercial methods are available for harvesting autologous platelet gel concentrates for use as graft supplement in spine fusions. METH- ODS: We reviewed 76 consecutive patients who underwent instrumented posterolateral lumbar fusion with autologous iliac crest bone graft mixed with autologous growth factor (AGF). A control group was randomly selected from patients who underÂ­went instrumented posterolateral lumbar fusion with autologous bone graft alone. The groups were matched for age, sex, smok- ing history, and number of levels fused, Demographic, surgical, and clinical data were collected from medical records. Diagnosis of nonunion was based on exploration during revision surgery or evidence of nonunion on computer- ized tomography. The Fisher exact test was used to compare fuÂ­sion rates. RESULTS: In both groups, mean age was 50 years, and 24% were smokers. The nonunion rate was 25% in the AGF group and 17% in the control group. This difference was not statistically significant (P= 0.18). CONCLUSIONS: Platelet gel preparation requires blood draws from the patient. This procedure adds to the risk and cost of surgery. The technique for AGF harvest evalu- ated in this study provides the highest concentration of platelets among the commercially available methods. Despite this, we showed that platelet gel failed to enhance fusion rate when added to autograft in patients undergoing instrumented posterolateral spinal fusion. The authors do not recommend the use of platelet gel to supplement autologous bone graft during instrumented posterolateral spinal fusion.\n\nAPPENDIX E 227 Publication Types: Research Support.

This knowledge is clinically correÂ­lated with 50 Charcotâs foot reconstruction patients who had diabetes and who were randomized to a platelet-rich plasma (PRP) concentration system (Sym- phony, DePuy, Warsaw, Indiana) or a hollow-fiber hemoconcentration system (Interpore Cross AGF, Interpore Cross, Irvine, CalÂ­ifornia) trial. Although the literature supports the notion that Symphony produces a higher yield of intact platelets mole consistently, clinically, a statistically significantly higher num- ber of patients treated with Interpore Cross AGF went onto solid fusion. The findings may indicate that one type of PRP may be indicated for a particular clinical circumstance based on the patientâs medical history and resultant lo- cal wound enviÂ­ronment.

Transplantation of marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells and platelet-rich plasma during distraction osteogenesisâa preliminary result of three cases. Kitoh H. Kitakoji T. Tsuchiya H. Mitsuyama H. Nakamura H. Katoh M. Ishiguro N. Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Nagoya University School of Medicine, Showa-ku, Nagoya, Aichi 466-8550, Japan. hkitoh@med.nagoya-u.ac.jp Clinical results of distraction osteogenesis with transplantation of marrow- derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and platelet-rich plasma (PRP) were reviewed in three femora and two tibiae of the two patients with achon- droplasia and one patient with congenital pseudarthrosis of the tibia. MSCs derived from the iliac crest were cultured with osteogenic supplements and differentiated into osteoblast-like cells. PRP, which is known to contain several\n\n228 KNOWING WHAT WORKS IN HEALTH CARE growth factors and coagulate immediately by a minute introduction of throm- bin and calcium, was prepared just beÂ­fore transplantation. Culture-expanded osteoblast-like coils and autologous PRP were injected into the distracted callus with the thrombin-calÂ­cium mixture so that the PRP gel might develop within the injected site. Transplantation of MSCs and PRP was done at the lengthening and consolidation period in each patient. The target lengths were obtained in every leg without major complications and the average healing inÂ­dex was 23.0 days/cm (18.8-26.9 days/cm). Although these results are still preliminary, transplantation of osteoblast-like cells and PRP, which seemed to be a safe and minimally invasive cell therapy, could shorten the treatment period by acceleration of bone regeneration during disÂ­traction osteogenesis.

Role of activated growth factors in lumbar spinal fusions. Castro EP Jr. Tulane Health Sciences, New Orleans, Louisiana. fcastro@seortho.com BACKGROUND: The concentration of platelets into an activated growth factor (AGF) gel may stimulate graft consolidation into a fusion mass. Preoperative hemodilution and intraoperative clot activation may also reduce the overall blood loss. Consequently, the need for postoperative transfusions may also be reduced. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this work was to report our experi- ence with AGF platelet gels in transforamÂ­inal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) procedures. METHODS: A consecutive series of patients between 1996 and 1999 undergoing one- and two-level TLIFs with AGF were compared with a consecutive series of TLIF patients who did not receive AGF. Sixty-two con- trol subjects who did not receive AGF and 22 patients who received an AGF platelet gel were compared after 41 and 34 months of follow-up, respectively. RESULTS: On average, the AGF group required 18 minutes of additional preincision anesthesia (P = 0.0001). No statistical differences in the opÂ­erative times, estimated blood loss, postoperative drainage, percentage of patients requiring a transfusion, or length of hospitalization were apÂ­preciated between the two groups. The 19% decrease in the arthrodesis rate of the AGF group, as compared with the control group, did not reach statistical significance. Platelet counts from the AGF platelet concentrates demonstrated an average 3.5-fold increase compared with preoperative serum levels. CONCLUSIONS: The theoretical benefits of AGF platelet gel technology were not clinically ap- preciated. The cost of implementing this technology may therefore outweigh its theoretical benefits.\n\nAPPENDIX E 229 Publication Types: Clinical Trial Comparative Study Controlled Clinical Trial UI: 15385877 12: Journal of Extra-Corporeal Technology. 36(l):28-35, 2004 Mar Comparison of methods for point of care preparation of autologous platelet gel.

PG releases multiple growth factors, which have the ability to initiate and stimulate one growth factorâs function in the presence of others. This finding has resulted in the use of PG in orthopedic, plastic, and reconstructive surgery. The study compared the commercial systems available for the preparation of PG. All procedures were performed according to the manufacturers directions. The devices were evaluated with respect to ease of use, collection efficiency, platelet quality, and growth factor release. The SmartPReP requires only four processing steps compared to 12 to 24 required by other devices. The SmartPReP and the CATS were the most reproducible, as evidenced by their low coefficient of variation of 13% and 16%. The mean platelet yield was 72% for the SmartPReP, 58% for the 3iPCCS, 54% for the Sequestra, 31% for the Secquire, 31% for the CATS, 27% for the lnterpore Cross, and 42.6% for the Biomet OPS. The mean total amount of PDGF-AB and TGF-B1 obtained from the SmartPReP is greater than other systems evaluated. The SmartPReP produced a consistent PC with a yield that was four times baseline range with the lowest coefficient of variation.
