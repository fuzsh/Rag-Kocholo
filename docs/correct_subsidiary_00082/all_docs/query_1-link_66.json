These financial statements and financial highlights are the responsibility of the Trust's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial highlights based on our audit. The financial statements of the Trust for the year ended June 30, 1994 and the financial highlights for each of the four years in the period ended June 30, 1994 were audited by other auditors whose report, dated September 30, 1994, expressed an unqualified opinion on those statements. The other auditors' report included an explanatory paragraph that discussed the Trust's procedures for accounting for and reporting of the values of securities which are not readily ascertainable. We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Massachusetts State Teachers' and Employees' Retirement Systems Trust at June 30, 1995, and the results of its operations, the changes in its net assets and its financial highlights for the year then ended, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

Significant Accounting Policies General The Massachusetts State Teachers' and Employees' Retirement Systems Trust (the Trust) is a combined investment fund for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts State Employees' Annuity Fund (Employees) and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts State Teachers' Annuity Fund (Teachers). The Trust consists of two investment funds, known as the Capital Fund and the Cash Fund. The Trust was established by the Treasurer of the Commonwealth, as Trustee, under a Declaration of Trust dated January 1, 1989, pursuant to authority granted under Massachusetts General Laws. Cost of Investments The Trust's initial portfolio was acquired in an exchange of Trust units for Trust units held by unitholders in Treasurer's Management Trust, Treasurer's Fixed Income Securities Trust and Treasurer's Cash Management Trust. The cost at which investments are carried on the books and in the financial statements is based on the cost as reflected on the records of the three predecessor investment funds or, if acquired subsequently, on purchase cost. Valuation of Securities Securities (including options) listed on security exchanges or reported through the NASDAQ national market are valued at closing sales prices. If no sale has been reported, the last published sale or the mean between the last bid and asked prices, whichever is more recent, is used. If such price is unavailable or if, in the opinion of the Trustee, the value thus obtained does not fairly indicate the actual market value, the security is valued by a reputable broker or investment banker selected by the Trustee. Unlisted securities are valued at the current bid price. If no bid price exists, valuation is determined either by taking the mean between the most recent published bid and asked prices or by averaging quotations obtained from dealers, brokers or investment bankers approved by the Trustee. Short-term obligations are valued at cost, and market value is approximated at cost plus accrued interest receivable. Securities for which such valuations are unavailable are appraised at their fair value as determined in good faith by the investment managers responsible for such investments, at the direction of the Trustee. 8 L L I Massachusetts State Teachers' and Employees' Retirement Systems Trust Notes to Financial Statements (continued) 1. SigniHcant Accounting Policies (continued) Cash Cash represents amounts in bank depository accounts. Of the total cash balance, $100,000 is insured; the remaining balance is uninsured and not collateralized. In addition, $738,305 of the June 30, 1995 cash balance is held by brokers as margin on futures trading accounts. Foreign Currency Translation The accounting records of the Trust are maintained in U.S. dollars. Investment securities, other assets and liabilities initially valued in foreign currencies are converted into U.S. dollars based upon current exchange rates. Purchases and sales of foreign investment securities and income and expenses are converted into U.S. dollars based upon currency exchange rates prevailing on the dates of such transactions. Gains and losses attributable to foreign currency exchange rates on sales of securities are recorded for financial statement purposes as net realized gains and losses on investments. Gains and losses attributable to foreign exchange rate movements on income and expenses are recorded for financial statement purposes as foreign currency transaction gains and losses. That portion of both realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments that results from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates is not separately disclosed. Income For the Capital Fund, interest income is determined on the basis of interest accrued and discount earned, adjusted for amortization of premium or discount on long-term debt securities. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date. For the Cash Fund, interest income consists of interest accrued and discount earned, plus or minus net realized gain or loss, if any, on investments. Expenses The investment management fees applicable to the Capital Fund and the Cash Fund and all other expenses are borne by the Capital Fund. 9 L L r L r r Massachusetts State Teachers' and Employees' Retirement Systems Trust Notes to Financial Statements (continued) 1. Significant Accounting Policies (continued) Written Options The Trust may write call or put options for which premiums are received and are recorded as liabilities, and are subsequently adjusted to the current value of the options written. Premiums received from writing options which expire are treated as realized gains. Premiums received from writing options which are exercised or are closed are offset against the proceeds or amount paid on the transaction to determine the realized gain or loss. If a put option is exercised, the premium reduces the cost basis of the securities purchased by the Trust. The Trust, as writer of an option, may have no control over whether the underlying securities may be sold (call) or purchased (put) and, as a result, bears the market risk of an unfavorable change in the price of the security underlying the written option. Forward Foreign Currency Exchange Contracts The Trust may enter into forward foreign currency exchange contracts for the purchase or sale of a specific foreign currency at a fixed price on a future date to manage its exposure to the risk of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates. Risks may arise upon entering these contracts from the potential inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts and from unanticipated movements in the value of a foreign currency relative to the U.S. dollar. The gain or loss arising from the difference between the original contract and the closing of such contract is included in net realized gains (losses) on foreign currency transactions. Fluctuations in the value of forward foreign currency exchange contracts are recorded for financial statement purposes as unrealized gains or losses by the Trust. Futures Contracts The Trust may enter into financial futures contracts for the delayed delivery of securities, currency or contracts based on financial indices at a fixed price on a future date. In entering such contracts, the Trust is required to deposit either in cash or securities an amount equal to a percentage of the contract amount. Subsequent payments are made or received by the Trust each day, depending on the daily fluctuations in the value of the underlying security, and are recorded for financial statement purposes as unrealized gains or losses by the Trust. The Trust's investment in financial futures contracts is designed to hedge against anticipated future changes in interest or exchange rates or securities' prices. The Trust may also invest in financial futures contracts for nonhedging purposes. 10 Massachusetts State Teachers' and Employees' Retirement Systems Trust Notes to Financial Statements (continued) 1. Significant Accounting Policies (continued) Futures Contracts (continued) Although some financial futures contracts by their terms call for actual delivery or acceptance of financial instruments, in most cases the contracts are closed out prior to delivery by offsetting purchases or sales of matching financial futures contracts. When the contracts are closed, the Trust recognizes a gain or loss. Risks of entering into futures contracts include the possibility that there may be an illiquid market and/or that a change in the value of the contract may not correlate with changes in the value of the underlying securities. Security Loans Through December 5, 1994, the Trust lent securities in connection with a contractual agreement with its custodian, Boston Safe Deposit and Trust Company, at which time the contract was terminated. Security loans were collateralized at all times by cash or securities with a market value at least equal to 102% of the market value of the securities loaned. As with other extensions of credit, the Trust may bear the risk of delay in recovery or even loss of rights in the collateral should the borrower of the securities fail financially. The Trust received income earned on lent securities and a portion of the income earned on cash collateral. Since December 5, 1994, the Trust had no securities on loan. Investment Transactions Investment transactions are recorded on the trade date. Reclassifications Financial statement presentadon for fiscal years prior to 1995 displayed amounts for the Capital Fund and Cash Fund on a stand alone basis and did not include balances on a combmed Trust basis. Cash Fund balances in fiscal years prior to 1995 represented liquid amounts held by the investment managers as well as those of the Teachers' and Employees' Plans. Since the cash allocated to investment managers is a component of the Capital Fund, the activity related to this item must be eliminated for combined Trust basis financial statements. As a result, certain 1994 balances have been reclassified to permit comparison with the 1995 method of financial statement presentation. The separate components of Trust unit transactions for fiscal 1994 have not been presented. 11 r u r u [ [ L [ r L r i c L r [ [ Massachusetts State Teachers' and Employees' Retirement Systems Trust Notes to Financial Statements (continued) 2. Distributions Cash Fund The net income of the Cash Fund is determined daily, and all of the net income so determined is declared as a dividend to shareholders of record at the time of the declaration. Distributions are paid monthly in the form of additional shares of the Fund. Capital Fund The current practice of the Capital Fund is to declare and pay monthly distributions of all of the net investment income earned by the Fund. 3. Units of Participation The Declaration of Trust permits the Trustee to issue an unlimited number of full and fractional units of participation (without par value). Units of participation in the Capital Fund may be issued only to the Massachusetts State Employees' Annuity Fund and Massachusetts State Teachers' Annuity Fund. Units of participation in the Cash Fund may also be issued to the Capital Fund. 4. Investment Management Services The Trust has engaged a number of investment managers to perform investment advisory and management services for the assets of the Capital Fund. The Capital Fund pays a quarterly fee for management and services to each investment manager. The fee is calculated by applying an annual rate, which varies depending on the investment managers' contracts, to the market value of net assets. The market value of the investment managers' assets in the Trust is determined as of the last business day of the preceding quarter. Total investment management fees paid during the year ended June 30, 1995 amounted to $13,429,023, representing 0.18% of the Capital Fund's average net assets. The Cash Fund represents available cash invested in a short-term investment fund. This fund is managed by the custodian and is charged sweep fees for the activity. The sweep fees, which are paid at a negotiated rate of twelve basis points, are accounted for as a reduction of the interest income received. 12 L L r U L L L C [ L r r Massachusetts State Teachers' and Employees' Retirement Systems Trust Notes to Financial Statements (continued) 5. Investments Gross unrealized appreciation and depreciation on the Trust's investment portfolio as of June 30, 1995 were $881,456,426 and $112,514,132, respectively, resulting in net unrealized appreciation of $768,942,294. During the year ended June 30, 1995, the purchases and sales of investments of the Capital Fund, other than short-term obligations, aggregated $9,586,039,340 and $9,101,232,552, respectively. The Trust's Operating Trust Agreement authorizes the investment without limitation in bonds, debentures, notes, certificates and other evidence of indebtedness, whether or not in registered form, interests in real estate, venture capital and leveraged buyout investments, common and preferred stocks and all other forms of certificates representing an interest or participation in any enterprise, whether or not incorporated. Included in the Trust's investments are the following types of derivative securities. Mortgage-Backed Securities The Trust invests in mortgage-backed securities that provide a cash flow \"pass through\" of principal and interest payments by mortgagees from an underlying pool of mortgage loans. Mortgage-backed securities do not have a contractual maturity date and the Trust is subject to the risk of prepayment on this portfolio. Collateralized Mortgage Obligations The Trust invests in collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs) which are debt obligations collateralized by a pool of mortgages or mortgage-backed securities. CMOs separate the cash flows from the pool into \"classes,\" \"pieces\" or \"tranches\" with various maturities. CMOs are structured so that the cash flow received from the underlying pool can be allocated, on a prioritized basis, among the classes of bonds comprising the CMO. As with mortgage-backed securities, the Trust is subject to the risk of prepayment on CMO securities. Inverse Floaters The Trust invests in inverse floaters, structured from mortgage-backed securities, to hedge against prepayment risk related to falling interest rates. An inverse floater bears an interest rate that moves inversely to market interest rates. That is, when current market interest rates increase, the interest rate paid on the inverse floater I declines and vice versa. While inverse floaters may pay attractive yields, the Trust is i subject to risk from rising interest rates. 13 I Massachusetts State Teachers' and Employees' Retirement Systems Trust Notes to Financial Statements (continued) 6. Not Readily Marketable Investments In previous years, the Capital Fund had acquired a number of interests in venture capital and real estate funds, limited partnerships and alternative investment pools which consist principally of investments that are not readily marketable. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 1995, substantially all of these investments were transferred to the Pension Reserves Investment Trust (FRIT), an affiliated Commonwealth of Massachusetts pension fund. The asset transfer consisted of the following: PRIT's financial statements disclose the amount of the transfer at $671,254,000. The difference of $315,000 represents the price difference between Friday, March 31, 1995 and Monday, April 3, 1995 of the S&P 500 securities transferred from the Trust's separate account to PRIT's SSGA Flagship account, a commingled account. The Trust realized a gain of approximately $40.9 million as a result of the transfer of these securities at market value. As of June 30, 1995, approximately $75 million, or 0.97%, of the Trust's net assets remained invested in such alternative investments. The Trust contemplates that it will transfer these assets by December 3 1 . 7. Financial Instruments with Off-Balance Sheet Risk The Trust regularly trades financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of its investing activities to assist in managing exposure to market risks such as interest rates. These financial instruments include written options, forward foreign currency exchange contracts and futures contracts.

Financial Instruments with Off-Balance Sheet Risk (continued) The notional or contractual amounts of these instruments represent the investment the Trust has in particular classes of financial instruments and does not necessarily represent the amount potentially subject to risk. The measurement of the risks associated with these instruments is meaningful only when all related and offsetting transactions are considered. At June 30, 1995, several investment pools of the Trust held the following forward foreign currency exchange contracts.
