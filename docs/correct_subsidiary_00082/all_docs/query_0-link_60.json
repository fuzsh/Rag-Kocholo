        "text": "Report Highlights\n\nThe U.S. market for regenerative medicine products used in bone and joint applications was estimated to total $2.72 billion in 2012 and is projected to increase to $2.73 billion in 2013. The market should total nearly $3.9 billion by 2018 and have a five-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.3%.\n\nReport Includes\n\nAn overview of the market for regenerative medicines in bone and joint applications, whose key objectives are the utilization of living cells to repair or replace body tissue damaged by injury, disease, or the aging process.\n\nAnalyses of market trends, with data from 2012, estimates for 2013, and projections of compound annual growth rates (CAGRs) through 2018.\n\nCoverage of other regenerative applications, such as dental, neurologic, organ regeneration, cardiovascular, urologic, diabetes, and wound care, as well as stem cell research.\n\nIdentification of market drivers, including an increase in diseases and disorders that will benefit from these products, primarily arthritis, osteoporosis, and various types of bone and joint trauma (e.g., hip fractures, knee injuries); increasing use of nonautograft products by physicians; and innovative devices that incorporate bone- and cartilage-growth-stimulating agents in a regenerative appliance.\n\nDescriptions of products, such as bone and cartilage grafting and regenerative products derived from autologous, allogeneic, and synthetic sources, as well as electrical stimulators for bone growth and regenerative cartilage products.\n\nSTUDY SCOPE AND FORMAT\n\nThe U.S. has been the main regenerative medicine market both in terms of R&D innovation, patents, and product sales often accounting for as much as half of the market depending on the product niche; hence, the scope of the study is mainly the U.S., although global developments are discussed and measurements provided where relevant. The Overview section provides a background of the demographics underlying the market for bone and joint products, a definition of regenerative medicine and the technologies involved, and a discussion of regenerative products in development for applications other than bones and joints. Various application sections describe the leading bone and joint diseases and disorders applicable to regenerative technologies, including incidence and current methods of treatment.\n\nThe section on Products provides extensive descriptions and analyses (e.g., comparative analysis) of regenerative products used to treat bone and joint disorders, as well as a discussion of products in development.\n\nThe section on FDA clinical trials and newly approved products provides a discussion of regulatory issues affecting regenerative medicine products.\n\nAn extensive Company Profiles section provides estimates for the revenues of the leading companies and a concise description of leading and emerging companies in the area of regenerative products for bones and joints, including product introductions, patents, and overall business strategies.\n\nANALYST CREDENTIALS\n\nResearch analyst Kevin Gainer holds both B.A. and M.A. degrees in quantitative economic analysis, and has 25 years of economic and market research experience. He is the author of five published books; dozens of technical papers, analyses, and studies published in conference proceedings; and many unpublished reports within corporations. He has worked as a Research Editor and Project Analyst at BCC Research, and, over the last 25 years, has authored many BCC technology market research reports."
