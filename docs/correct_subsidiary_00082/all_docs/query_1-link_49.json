In most modern mammals the zygomatic bone forms a large part of the face and usually serves as a bridge that connects the facial skeleton to the neurocranium. Our aim is to provide information on the contribution of the zygomatic bone to variation in midfacial protrusion using three samples; humans, domesticated dogs, and monkeys. In each case, variation in midface protrusion is a heritable trait produced by one of three classes of transmission: localized dysmorphology associated with single gene dysfunction, selective breeding, or longâterm evolution from a common ancestor. We hypothesize that the shape of the zygomatic bone reflects its role in stabilizing the connection between facial skeleton and neurocranium and consequently, changes in facial protrusion are more strongly reflected by the maxilla and premaxilla. Our geometric morphometric analyses support our hypothesis suggesting that the shape of the zygomatic bone has less to do with facial protrusion. By morphometrically dissecting the zygomatic bone we have determined a degree of modularity among parts of the midfacial skeleton suggesting that these components have the ability to vary independently and thus can evolve differentially. From these purely morphometric data, we propose that the neural crest cells that are fated to contribute to the zygomatic bone experience developmental cues that distinguish them from the maxilla and premaxilla. The spatiotemporal and molecular identity of the cues that impart zygoma progenitors with their identity remains an open question that will require alternative data sets.

Dental implants are essential to restore aesthetics and function and subsequently quality of life in such group of patients. Zygomatic implants reduce the complications associated with bone grafting procedures and simplify the rehabilitation of atrophic maxilla and maxillectomy. The purpose of this study was to compare, by means of three-dimensional finite element analysis, the impact of different zygomatic bone support (10, 15, and 20mm) on the biomechanics of zygomatic implants. Results indicated maximum stresses within the fixture were increased by three times, when bone support decreased from 20 to 10mm, and concentrated at fixture/bone interface. However, stresses within the abutment screw and abutment itself were not significantly different regardless of the bone support level. Supporting bone at 10mm suffered double the stresses of 15 and 20mm. Fixture's deflection was decreased by two to three times when bone level support increased to 15mm and 20mm respectively. It was concluded that zygomatic bone support should not be less than 15mm and abutment screw is not at risk of fracture regardless of the zygomatic bone support.\n\nZygomatic implants: the impact of zygoma bone support on biomechanics.\n\nPubMed\n\nRomeed, Shihab A; Malik, Raheel; Dunne, Stephen M\n\n2014-06-01\n\nMaxillectomy and severely resorbed maxilla are challenging to restore with provision of removable prostheses.

We report about one case of complex prosthetic joint reconstruction extending to the neighbouring bony structures. A 57-year-old patient, operated several times for a cranio-facial fibrous dysplasia, presented with a recurring TMJ ankylosis and a complexe latero-facial bone loss on the right side. We performed a reconstruction procedure including the TMJ, the zygomatic arch and the malar bone by mean of custom made composite prosthesis (chrome-cobalt-molybdenum-titanium and polyethylene). Five years postoperatively, mouth opening, nutrition, pain and oral hygiene were significantly improved. Nowadays technical possibilities allow for complex facial alloplastic reconstructions with good medium term results. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Three-dimensional models of titanium zygomatic implants, maxillary prostheses, and human skulls were created and assembled using Mimics based on microcomputed tomography and cone beam computed tomography images. A variety of additional bone defects were created at the locations of four zygomatic implants to simulate multiple clinical scenarios. The volume meshes were created and exported into FEA software. Material properties were assigned respectively for all the structures, and von Mises stress data were collected and plotted in the postprocessing module. The maximum stress in the surrounding bone was located in the crestal bone around zygomatic implants. The maximum stress in the prostheses was located at the angled area of the implant-abutment connection. The model with anterior defects had a higher peak stress value than the model with posterior defects. All the models with additional bone defects had higher maximum stress values than the control model without additional bone loss. Additional alveolar bone loss has a negative influence on the stress concentration in the surrounding bone of quad zygomatic implant-supported prostheses. More care should be taken if these additional bone defects are at the sites of anterior zygomatic implants.\n\nBone condition of the maxillary zygomatic process prior to orthodontic anchorage plate fixation.\n\nPubMed\n\nPrÃ¤ger, T M; Brochhagen, H G; Mischkowski, R; Jost-Brinkmann, P G; MÃ¼ller-Hartwich, R\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe clinical success of orthodontic miniplates depends on the stability of the miniscrews used for fixation. For good stability, it is essential that the application site provides enough bone of good quality. This study was performed to analyze the amount of bone available for orthodontic miniplates in the zygomatic process of the maxilla. We examined 51 dental CT scans (Somatom Plus 4; Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) obtained from 51 fully dentate adult patients (mean age 24.0 Â± 8.1 years; 27 male and 24 female) prior to third molar surgery. The amount of bone in the zygomatic process region at the level of the first molar root tips and at several other cranial levels as far as 15 mm from the root tips was measured Bone thickness at the root tip level averaged 4.1 Â± 1.0 mm; the lowest value measured at this level in any of the patients was 2.7 mm. Bone thickness averaged 8.3 Â± 1.0 mm at 15 mm cranial to the root tips; 6.9 mm was the lowest value. The zygomatic process appears to provide sufficient bone to accommodate screws for miniplate fixation. While some patients may possess a borderline amount of bone at more caudal levels, lack of volume is not a problem near the zygomatic bone.\n\nCavernous hemangioma--uncommon presentation in zygomatic bone.\n\nPubMed\n\nDhupar, Vikas; Yadav, Sunil; Dhupar, Anita; Akkara, Francis\n\n2012-03-01\n\nHemangiomas are benign vascular neoplasms characterized by an abnormal proliferation of blood vessels. They may occur in any vascularized tissue including skin, subcutaneous tissue, muscle, and bone. Intraosseous hemangiomas are uncommon, constituting less than 1% of all osseous tumors. The most frequent sites are the calvaria and the vertebral column. Involvement of the facial bones is rare and occurs most commonly in the maxilla, mandible, and nasal bones. In literature, only 20 cases of zygomatic involvement have been reported. We report a case of an intraosseous hemangioma of the zygoma with the history and physical findings of slowly growing, bony, hard tumor causing facial and ocular deformity. The typical clinicopathologic and radiologic findings helped to set up the correct diagnosis. Early recognition and excision are recommended to preserve facial contour. Operative blood loss is minimal, and there is no need for preoperative angiography.\n\nMorphomic measurement of the temporalis muscle and zygomatic bone as novel predictors of hospital-based clinical outcomes in patients with mandible fracture.\n\nPubMed\n\nLisiecki, Jeffrey; Zhang, Peng; Wang, Lu; Rinkinen, Jacob; De La Rosa, Sara; Enchakalody, Binu; Brownley, Robert Cameron; Wang, Stewart C; Buchman, Steven R; Levi, Benjamin\n\n2013-09-01\n\nPatients with mandibular fracture often have comorbidities and concomitant injuries making the decision for when and how to operate a challenge. Physicians describe \"temporalis wasting\" as a finding that indicates frailty; however, this is a subjective finding without quantitative values. In this study, we demonstrate that decreased morphomic values of the temporalis muscle and zygomatic bone are an objective measure of frailty associated with increased injury-induced morbidity as well as negative impact on overall hospital-based clinical outcomes in patients with mandible fracture. Computed tomographic (CT) scans from all patients with a diagnosis of a mandible fracture in the University of Michigan trauma registry and with a hospital admission were collected from the years 2004 to 2011. Automated, high-throughput CT analysis was used to reconstruct the anatomy and quantify morphomic values (temporalis volume, area and thickness, and zygomatic thickness) in these patients using MATLAB v13.0 (MathWorks Inc, Natick, MA, USA). Subsequently, a subset of 16 individuals with a Glasgow Coma Scale of 14 or 15 was analyzed to control for brain injury. Clinical data were obtained, and the association between morphomic measurements and clinical outcomes was evaluated using Pearson correlation for unadjusted analysis and multiple regression for adjusted analysis. The mean age of patients in the study was 47.1 years. Unadjusted analysis using Pearson correlation revealed that decreases in zygomatic bone thickness correlated strongly with increases in hospital, intensive care unit, and ventilator days (P < 0.0001, P = 0.0003, and P = 0.0017, respectively). Furthermore, we found that decreases in temporalis mean thickness correlated with increases in hospital and ventilator days (P = 0.0264 and P = 0.0306, respectively). Similarly, decreases in temporalis local mean thickness are significantly correlated with increases in hospital and ventilator days (P = 0.0232 and P = 0\n\nComparing 3-dimensional virtual methods for reconstruction in craniomaxillofacial surgery.\n\nPubMed\n\nBenazzi, Stefano; Senck, Sascha\n\n2011-04-01\n\nIn the present project, the virtual reconstruction of digital osteomized zygomatic bones was simulated using different methods. A total of 15 skulls were scanned using computed tomography, and a virtual osteotomy of the left zygomatic bone was performed. Next, virtual reconstructions of the missing part using mirror imaging (with and without best fit registration) and thin plate spline interpolation functions were compared with the original left zygomatic bone. In general, reconstructions using thin plate spline warping showed better results than the mirroring approaches. Nevertheless, when dealing with skulls characterized by a low degree of asymmetry, mirror imaging and subsequent registration can be considered a valid and easy solution for zygomatic bone reconstruction. The mirroring tool is one of the possible alternatives in reconstruction, but it might not always be the optimal solution (ie, when the hemifaces are asymmetrical). In the present pilot study, we have verified that best fit registration of the mirrored unaffected hemiface and thin plate spline warping achieved better results in terms of fitting accuracy, overcoming the evident limits of the mirroring approach.

Methods Simulating zygomatic implantation was performed using seven cadaver heads and 3D-CT images from forty-eight adults. After measuring the maxillary-zygomatic complex, we analyzed the position between the implantation path and the maxillary sinus cavity as well as the distance between the implantation path and the zygomatic nerve. Results The distance from the starting point to the endpoint of the implant was 56.85 Â± 5.35âmm in cadaver heads and 58.15 Â± 7.37âmm in 3D-CT images. For the most common implantation path (80.20%), the implant went through the maxillary sinus cavity completely. The projecting points of the implant axis (IA) on the surface of zygoma were mainly located in the region of frontal process of zygomatic bone close to the lateral orbital wall. The distances between IA and zygomatic nerve in 53 sides were shorter than 2âmm. Conclusion The simulating zygomatic implantation on cadaver skulls and 3D-CT imaging provided useful anatomical data of the maxillary-zygomatic complex. It is necessary to take care to avoid the zygomatic nerve injury during implantation, because it frequently appears on the route of implantation.

A mechanical analysis.\n\nPubMed\n\nde Moraes, P H; Olate, S; NÃ³bilo, M de Arruda; Asprino, L; de Moraes, M; Barbosa, J de AlbergarÃ­a\n\n2016-04-01\n\nZygomatic implants may be used for dental rehabilitation in atrophic maxillae. The aim of this study was to establish experimentally the areas of stress distribution using 2 kinds of \"All-On-Four\" maxillary procedures. The best position to insert the implants was selected using polyurethane craniomaxillary models and surgical guides were made. Group 1 was designed with two posterior zygomatic implants and two conventional anterior implants, and group 2 with two posterior zygomatic implants and two anterior zygomatic implants. A titanium bar was built to link the 4 implants in both groups. Photoelastic replicas of these models were made and the implants were inserted using the surgical guides. An Instrom 4411 testing machine was used to perform a unilateral compressive loading at the level of the right first molar until 2mm of displacement was obtained. Group 1 showed a high strain concentration in the right lateral orbital region at the level of the apex of the zygomatic implant. Less strain was noticed at the apical levels of the conventional implants in the anterior sector and of the contralateral zygomatic implant. Group 2 showed high strains in the lateral inferior orbital area. The load was low in the alveolar bone sector. Zygomatic bone and paranasal structures are loaded at high levels when zygomatic implants are used to stabilize a full maxillary prosthodontic rehabilitation on 4 implants. The use of 4 zygomatic implants loads the alveolar bone to a lower extent and seems better suited from a mechanical point of view than the use of 2 zygomatic implants.

The repercussions of ICD on the face are not well described in the midfacial region. Here we assessed the shape of the zygomatic bone in different types of ICDs. We considered 14 non-deformed skulls, 19 skulls with antero-posterior deformation, nine skulls with circumferential deformation and seven skulls with Toulouse deformation. The shape of the zygomatic bone was assessed using a statistical shape model after mesh registration. Euclidian distances between mean models and Mahalanobis distances after canonical variate analysis were computed. Classification accuracy was computed using a cross-validation approach. Different ICDs cause specific zygomatic shape modifications corresponding to different degrees of retrusion but the shape of the zygomatic bone alone is not a sufficient parameter for classifying populations into ICD groups defined by deformation types. We illustrate the fact that external mechanical constraints on the skull vault influence midfacial growth. ICDs are a model for the study of the influence of epigenetic factors on craniofacial growth and can help to understand the facial effects of congenital skull malformations such as single or multi-suture synostoses, or of external orthopedic devices such as helmets used to correct deformational plagiocephaly.

Stable fixation of fractured fragments after adequate exposure is critical for ensuring three-dimensional anatomic reduction. Between January 2008 and December 2010, 17 patients with zygomatic fractures were admitted to our hospital; there were 15 male and 2 female patients. The average age of the patients was 41 years (range, 19 to 75 years). We exposed the inferior orbital rim and zygomatic complex through a lateral brow, intraoral, and subciliary incisions, which allowed for visualization of the bone, and then the fractured parts were corrected using the Carroll-Girard T-bar screw. Postoperative complications such as malar asymmetry, diplopia, enophthalmos, and postoperative infection were not observed. Lower eyelid retraction and temporary ectropion occurred in 1 of the 17 patients. Functional and cosmetic results were excellent in nearly all of the cases. In this report, we describe using the Carroll-Girard T-bar screw for the reduction of zygomatic fractures. Because this instrument is easy to use and can rotate to any direction and vector, it can be used to correct displaced zygomatic bone more accurately and safely than other devices, without leaving facial scars.\n\n[Reconstruction of zygomatic-facial massive defect using modified bilobed flap after resection of skin cancer].\n\nPubMed\n\nLing, Bin; Abass, Keremu; Hu, Mei; Yin, Xiaopeng; Hu, Lulu; Lin, Zhaoquan; Gong, Zhongcheng\n\n2013-01-01\n\nTo investigate the clinical application of the modified bilobed flap in the reconstruction of zygomatic-facial massive defect after resection of skin cancer. Between August 2009 and October 2011, 15 patients with skin cancer in the zygomatic-facial region underwent defect reconstruction using modified bilobed flaps after surgical removal. There were 12 males and 3 females, aged 52-78 years (mean, 64.1 years). The disease duration was 1-14 months (mean, 4.6 months). Among the patients, there were 11 cases of basal cell carcinoma and 4 cases of squamous cell carcinoma; 1 patient had infection and the others had no skin ulceration; and tumor involved the skin layer in all patients. According to TNM staging, 13 cases were rated as T2N0M2 and 2 cases as T3N0M3. The defect size ranged from 4.0 cm x 2.5 cm to 6.5 cm x 4.0 cm after cancer resection. The modified bilobed flaps consisting of pre-auricular flap and post-auricular flap was used to repair the defect after cancer resection. The size ranged from 4.0 cm x 2.5 cm to 6.5 cm x 4.0 cm of the first flap and from 3.0 cm x 2.0 cm to 5.0 cm x 3.0 cm of the second flap. Partial incision dehiscence occurred in 1 case, and was cured after dressing change; the flaps survived and incision healed primarily in the other cases. Fourteen patients were followed up 12-24 months (mean, 18.7 months). No recurrence was found, and the patients had no obvious face asymmetry or skin scar with normal closure of eyelid and facial nerve function. At last follow-up, the results were very satisfactory in 5 cases, satisfactory in 7 cases, generally satisfactory in 1 case, and dissatisfactory in 1 case. The pre- and post-auricular bilobed flaps could be used to reconstruct the massive defects in the zygomatic-facial region after resection of skin cancer.\n\nAdvantages of a Beveled Osteotomy on the Zygomatic Arch During Reduction Malarplasty.\n\nPubMed\n\nLee, Tae Sung; Park, Sanghoon\n\n2017-10-01\n\nDuring a conventional reduction malarplasty procedure, a dual approach including intraoral incisions and preauricular incisions is made to reduce both the zygomatic body and arch. As the preauricular approach is performed to cut the zygomatic arch, there are several remarkable advantages that can be achieved by simply beveling the osteotomy anteriorly on the zygomatic arch. This has the benefits of enhancing bone union by the increase in cross-sectional area for bone contact, decreasing palpability on the osteotomy site, placing the osteotomy more posteriorly, preventing depression in the anterior malar region, and reducing the need for metal fixtures.\n\nBiomechanical 3-Dimensional Finite Element Analysis of Obturator Protheses Retained with Zygomatic and Dental Implants in Maxillary Defects\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAkay, Canan; YaluÄ, Suat\n\n2015-01-01\n\nBackground The objective of this study was to investigate the stress distribution in the bone around zygomatic and dental implants for 3 different implant-retained obturator prostheses designs in a Aramany class IV maxillary defect using 3-dimensional finite element analysis (FEA). Material\\\\Methods A 3-dimensional finite element model of an Aramany class IV defect was created. Three different implant-retained obturator prostheses were modeled: model 1 with 1 zygomatic implant and 1 dental implant, model 2 with 1 zygomatic implant and 2 dental implants, and model 3 with 2 zygomatic implants. Locator attachments were used as a superstructure. A 150-N load was applied 3 different ways. Qualitative analysis was based on the scale of maximum principal stress; values obtained through quantitative analysis are expressed in MPa. Results In all loading conditions, model 3 (when compared models 1 and 2) showed the lowest maximum principal stress value. Model 3 is the most appropirate reconstruction in Aramany class IV maxillary defects. Two zygomatic implants can reduce the stresses in model 3. The distribution of stresses on prostheses were more rational with the help of zygoma implants, which can distribute the stresses on each part of the maxilla. Conclusions Aramany class IV obturator prosthesis placement of 2 zygomatic implants in each side of the maxilla is more advantageous than placement of dental implants. In the non-defective side, increasing the number of dental implants is not as suitable as zygomatic implants.

It had large, centralized radiolucent regions consisting of fatty bone marrow and sparse trabeculae. A discrete, proliferative nodule within the osteoma consisted of closely-packed woven bone trabeculae and pleomorphic osteoblasts associated with haphazard osteoid deposits, resembling osteosarcoma-like change. These heterogeneous structural features were at variance with more classic reports of osteoma, which usually describe a uniform cancellous or cortical bone architecture.\n\nThe biomechanics of zygomatic arch shape\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSmith, Amanda L.; Grosse, Ian R.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nMammalian zygomatic arch shape is remarkably variable, ranging from nearly cylindrical to blade-like in cross section. Based on geometry, the arch can be hypothesized to be a sub-structural beam whose ability to resist deformation is related to cross sectional shape. We expect zygomatic arches with different cross sectional shapes to vary in the degree to which they resist local bending and torsion due to the contraction of the masseter muscle. A stiffer arch may lead to an increase in the relative proportion of applied muscle load being transmitted through the arch to other cranial regions, resulting in elevated cranial stress (and thus, strain). Here, we examine the mechanics of the zygomatic arch using a series of finite element modeling experiments in which the cross section of the arch of Pan troglodytes has been modified to conform to idealized shapes (cylindrical, elliptical, blade-like). We find that the shape of the zygomatic arch has local effects on stain that do not conform to beam theory. One exception is that possessing a blade-like arch leads to elevated strains at the postorbital zygomatic junction and just below the orbits. Furthermore, although modeling the arch as solid cortical bone did not have the effect of elevating strains in other parts of the face, as had been expected, it does have a small effect on stress associated with masseter contraction. These results are counterintuitive. Even though the arch has simple beam-like geometry, we fail to find a simple mechanical explanation for the diversity of arch shape.

We developed a novel aqua splint and suture technique for stabilizing isolated zygomatic arch fractures. The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of novel aqua splint and suture technique in isolated zygomatic arch fractures. Patients with isolated zygomatic arch fractures were treated by a single surgeon in a single center from January 2000 through December 2012. Classic Gillies approach without external fixation was performed from January 2000 to December 2003, while the novel technique has been performed since 2004. 67 consecutive patients were included (Classic method, n = 32 and Novel method, n = 35). An informed consent was obtained from all patients. The novel aqua splint and suture technique was performed by the following fashion: first, we evaluated intraoperatively the bony alignment by ultrasonography and then, reduced the depressed fracture surgically using the Gillies approach. Thereafter, to stabilize the fracture and obtain the smooth facial figure, we made an aqua splint that fit the facial contour and placed monofilament nonabsorbable sutures around the fractured zygomatic arch. The novel aqua splint and suture technique showed significantly correlated with better cosmetic and functional results. In conclusion, the aqua splint suture technique is very simple, quick, safe, and effective for stabilizing repositioned zygomatic arch fractures. The aqua splint suture technique can be a good alternative procedure in isolated zygomatic arch fractures.\n\nThe Biomechanics of Zygomatic Arch Shape.\n\nPubMed\n\nSmith, Amanda L; Grosse, Ian R\n\n2016-12-01\n\nMammalian zygomatic arch shape is remarkably variable, ranging from nearly cylindrical to blade-like in cross section.

Here, we examine the mechanics of the zygomatic arch using a series of finite element modeling experiments in which the cross section of the arch of Pan troglodytes has been modified to conform to idealized shapes (cylindrical, elliptical, blade-like). We find that the shape of the zygomatic arch has local effects on stain that do not conform to beam theory. One exception is that possessing a blade-like arch leads to elevated strains at the postorbital zygomatic junction and just below the orbits. Furthermore, although modeling the arch as solid cortical bone did not have the effect of elevating strains in other parts of the face, as had been expected, it does have a small effect on stress associated with masseter contraction. These results are counterintuitive. Even though the arch has simple beam-like geometry, we fail to find a simple mechanical explanation for the diversity of arch shape. Anat Rec, 299:1734-1752, 2016.

V.\n\n2018-03-01\n\nCustom individual implants for the reconstruction of craniofacial defects have gained importance due to better qualitative characteristics over their generic counterparts â plates, which should be bent according to patient needs. The Additive Manufacturing of individual implants allows reducing cost and improving quality of implants. In this paper, the authors describe design of zygomatic implant models based on computed tomography (CT) data. The fabrication of the implants will be carried out with 3D printing by selective laser melting machine SLM 280HL.\n\nZygomatic implant-retained fixed complete denture for an elderly patient.\n\nPubMed\n\nBaig, Mirza Rustum; Rajan, Gunaseelan; Yunus, Norsiah\n\n2012-06-01\n\nDental rehabilitation of a completely edentulous geriatric patient has always been a challenge to the clinician, especially in treating those with higher expectations and demands. Treatment duration and the amount of residual alveolar bone available are often important considerations when planning for dental implant-based fixed treatment for these patients. With the introduction of zygomatic implants, a graftless alternative solution has emerged for deficient maxillary bone with provision for immediate loading. This article describes the treatment of a completely edentulous elderly patient using zygomatic implants in conjunction with conventional implants. The implants were immediately loaded using a definitive acrylic resin fixed denture reinforced with a cast metal framework, to provide function and aesthetics.

The inherent advantages include reliable vascularity, adequate size, and proximity to the defect. Although contemporary surgical techniques provide fair surgical results with low rate of complications, their intraoral transposition involve additional surgical trauma by intentional fracturing of the zygomatic arch. We have proposed herein a simpler technique of temporalis myofascial flap transposition into the oral cavity without zygomatic arch osteotomy.

A 7-month-old, mixed breed, male dog suffered the sudden-onset of unilateral painful exophthalmos and a gradual swelling of the right temporal region. A compressing, right retrobulbar mass was observed by ultrasound. Computed tomography revealed a large multiloculated cyst-like lesion of the right zygomatic gland projecting into the orbital space, thus displacing the eyeball. The ipsilateral molar part of the maxillary bone was underdeveloped, besides showing crowded, abnormal, multiple, unerupted maxillary molar teeth in the caudal maxillary region. Modified lateral orbitotomy and a selective caudal maxillary bone access were performed. The cyst-like lesion was removed and the zygomatic gland and the wall was collected for histology, which confirmed the mucocele. Clinical and imaging examinations six months after surgery showed neither recurrence of the mucocele nor ocular abnormalities. A possible common pathogenic mechanism involving these two conditions could be hypothesized.

This study tests a new device used for reconstructing mandibular defects based on the principle of bone transport distraction osteogenesis. Methods Thirteen beagle dogs were divided into control and experimental groups. In all animals, a 3 cm defect was created on one side of the mandible. In eight control animals, the defect was stabilized with a reconstruction plate without further reconstruction and the animals were sacrificed two to three months after surgery. The remaining five animals were reconstructed with a bone transport reconstruction plate (BTRP), comprising a reconstruction plate with attached intraoral transport unit, and were sacrificed after one month of consolidation. Results Clinical evaluation, cone-beam CT densitometry, three-dimensional histomorphometry, and docking site histology revealed significant new bone formation within the defect in the distracted group. Conclusion The physical dimensions and architectural parameters of the new bone were comparable to the contralateral normal bone. Bone union at the docking site remains a problem.

To assess the fixation of zygomatic-complex and mandibular fractures with biodegradable copolymer osteosynthesis system. In randomly selected 13 patients, zygomatic-complex and mandibular fractures were plated using resorbable plates and screws using Champy's principle. All the cases were evaluated clinically and radiologically for the type of fracture, need for the intermaxillary fixation (IMF) and its duration, duration of surgery, fixation at operation, state of reduction at operation, state of bone union after operation, anatomic reduction, paresthesia, occlusal discrepancies, soft tissue infection, immediate and late inflammatory reactions related to biodegradation process, and any need for the removal of the plates. Descriptives, Frequencies, and Chi-square test were used. In our study, the age group range was 5 to 55 years. Road traffic accidents accounted for the majority of patients six, (46.2%). Postoperative occlusal discrepancies were found in seven patients as mild to moderate, which resolved with IMF for 1-8 weeks. There were minimal complications seen and only as soft tissue infection. Use of biodegradable osteosynthesis system is a reliable alternative method for the fixation of zygomatic-complex and mandibular fractures. The biodegradable system still needs to be refined in material quality and handling to match the stability achieved with metal system. Biodegradable plates and screws is an ideal system for pediatric fractures with favorable outcome.\n\nThe zygomatic implant perforated (ZIP) flap: a new technique for combined surgical reconstruction and rapid fixed dental rehabilitation following low-level maxillectomy.\n\nPubMed\n\nButterworth, C J; Rogers, S N\n\n2017-12-01\n\nThis aim of this report is to describe the development and evolution of a new surgical technique for the immediate surgical reconstruction and rapid post-operative prosthodontic rehabilitation with a fixed dental prosthesis following low-level maxillectomy for malignant disease.The technique involves the use of a zygomatic oncology implant perforated micro-vascular soft tissue flap (ZIP flap) for the primary management of maxillary malignancy with surgical closure of the resultant maxillary defect and the installation of osseointegrated support for a zygomatic implant-supported maxillary fixed dental prosthesis.The use of this technique facilitates extremely rapid oral and dental rehabilitation within a few weeks of resective surgery, providing rapid return to function and restoring appearance following low-level maxillary resection, even in cases where radiotherapy is required as an adjuvant treatment post-operatively. The ZIP flap technique has been adopted as a standard procedure in the unit for the management of low-level maxillary malignancy, and this report provides a detailed step-by-step approach to treatment and discusses modifications developed over the treatment of an initial cohort of patients.\n\nThe fixation effect of a silk fibroin-bacterial cellulose composite plate in segmental defects of the zygomatic arch: an experimental study.\n\nPubMed\n\nLee, Jung Min; Kim, Ji Heui; Lee, Ok Joo; Park, Chan Hum\n\n2013-06-01\n\nBioresorbable fixation systems have been popular for the treatment of facial fractures. However, their mechanical properties are uncertain and complications have been reported. To overcome these problems, we developed a bioresorbable fixation plate using a composite of silk fibroin and bacterial cellulose (SF-BC) with biodegradability and increased biocompatibility. To investigate the regenerative effect of the bioresorbable SF-BC fixation plate on zygomatic arch defects in rats. In vivo animal study. The SF-BC composite plate had a tensile strength similar to that of a polylactic acid plate and a tight, pore-free microstructure. Bilateral segmental bone defects (2 mm in length) were created in the zygomatic arches of adult rats. One side was fixed with the SF-BC composite plate, and the other side was left without fixation. Academic research laboratory. Fifteen adult Sprague-Dawley rats. Fixation of the zygomatic arch defect with the SF-BC composite plate. Micro-computed tomography and histological evaluation of bone samples. Gross inspection revealed no specific complication. At 1, 2, 4, and 8 postoperative weeks, the zygomatic arches were explored by micro-computed tomography and histological examination. Control sides did not heal completely and showed bony degeneration and necrosis during the 8-week follow-up. However, we observed new bone formation in sides treated with the SF-BC composite plate, and bony defects were completely healed within 8 weeks. The SF-BC composite plate is a potential candidate for a new bioresorbable fixation system. Our composite material could considerably shorten bone regeneration time. Additional study of the control of biodegradability and mechanical properties of SF-BC composite plates and a comparative study with the resorbable plates currently in use should be undertaken.\n\nFixation of zygomatic and mandibular fractures with biodegradable plates\n\nPubMed Central\n\nDegala, Saikrishna; Shetty, Sujeeth; Ramya, S\n\n2013-01-01\n\nContext: In this prospective study, 13 randomly selected patients underwent treatment for zygomaticâcomplex fractures (2 site fractures) and mandibular fractures using 1.5 / 2 / 2.5-mm INION CPS biodegradable plates and screws.

Material and methods The surgical technique is described and two cases reported. The zygomatic fixture has a complete extrasinus path in order to preserve the sinus membrane and to avoid any post-surgical sinus sequelae. Results The surgical procedure allows an optimal position of the implant and consequently an ideal emergence of the fixture on the alveolar crest. Conclusion The surgical procedures and the zygomatic implant design reduce remarkably the serious post-operative sequelae due to the intrasinus path of the zygomatic fixtures.

To examine the origin, course and distribution of this nervous branch, 42 head halves of 21 Japanese cadavers (11 males, 10 females) and 142 head halves of 71 human dry skulls were used. The branch was observed in seven sides (16.7%); it originated from the communication between the lacrimal nerve and the zygomaticotemporal branch of the zygomatic nerve or from the trunk of the zygomatic nerve. In two head halves (4.8%), the branch pierced the anterior part of the temporalis muscle during its course to the skin of the anterior part of the temple. The small canal in the suture was observed in 31 head halves (21.8%) of the dry skulls. Although this nervous branch is inconstantly observed, it should be called the temporal branch of the zygomatic nerve according to the constant positional relationship to the sphenoid and zygomatic bones. According to its origin, course and distribution, this nervous branch may be considered to be influential in zygomatic and retro-orbital pain due to entrapment and tension from the temporalis muscle and/or the narrow bony canal.

The fracture was approached via a modified lateral orbitotomy and a fragment of the lacrimal bone removed. The rostral portion of the fracture was stabilized with a 5-hole 2.0 dynamic compression plate bone plate. The surgical correction achieved sufficient skeletal fixation for proper anatomical reduction of the globe and excellent cosmetic and functional outcomes.\n\nModified endoscopic medial maxillectomy for zygomatic implant salvage.\n\nPubMed\n\nSchwartz, Joseph S; Tajudeen, Bobby A; Adappa, Nithin D; Palmer, James N\n\n2016-01-01\n\nOdontogenic chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is an epidemiologically important disease process due, in part, to the increasingly commonplace use of dental restorative procedures such as zygomatic implantation.

Lawrence\n\n2007-03-01\n\nA system for the semi-automatic reconstruction of highly fragmented bone fractures, developed to aid in treatment planning, is presented. The system aligns bone fragment surfaces derived from segmentation of volumetric CT scan data. Each fragment surface is partitioned into intact- and fracture-surfaces, corresponding more or less to cortical and cancellous bone, respectively. A user then interactively selects fracture-surface patches in pairs that coarsely correspond. A final optimization step is performed automatically to solve the N-body rigid alignment problem. The work represents the first example of a 3D bone fracture reconstruction system and addresses two new problems unique to the reconstruction of fractured bones: (1) non-stationary noise inherent in surfaces generated from a difficult segmentation problem and (2) the possibility that a single fracture surface on a fragment may correspond to many other fragments.\n\nTrans-zygomatic middle cranial fossa approach to access lesions around the cavernous sinus and anterior parahippocampus: a minimally invasive skull base approach.\n\nPubMed\n\nMelamed, Itay; Tubbs, R Shane; Payner, Troy D; Cohen-Gadol, Aaron A\n\n2009-08-01\n\nExposure of the cavernous sinus or anterior parahippocampus often involves a wide exposure of the temporal lobe and mobilization of the temporalis muscle associated with temporal lobe retraction. The authors present a cadaveric study to illustrate the feasibility, advantages and landmarks necessary to perform a trans-zygomatic middle fossa approach to lesions around the cavernous sinus and anterior parahippocampus. The authors performed bilateral trans-zygomatic middle fossae exposures to reach the cavernous sinus and parahippocampus in five cadavers (10 sides). We assessed the morbidity associated with this procedure and compared the indications, advantages, and disadvantages of this method versus more extensive skull base approaches. A vertical linear incision along the middle portion of the zygomatic arch was extended one finger breadth inferior to the inferior edge of the zygomatic arch. Careful dissection inferior to the arch allowed preservation of facial nerve branches. A zygomatic osteotomy was followed via a linear incision through the temporalis muscle and exposure of the middle cranial fossa floor. A craniotomy along the inferolateral temporal bone and middle fossa floor allowed extradural dissection along the middle fossa floor and exposure of the cavernous sinus including all three divisions of the trigeminal nerve. Intradural inspection demonstrated adequate exposure of the parahippocampus. Exposure of the latter required minimal or no retraction of the temporal lobe. The trans-zygomatic middle fossa approach is a simplified skull base exposure using a linear incision, which may avoid the invasivity of more extensive skull base approaches while providing an adequate corridor for resection of cavernous sinus and parahippocampus lesions. The advantages of this approach include its efficiency, ease, minimalism, preservation of the temporalis muscle, and minimal retraction of the temporal lobe.\n\nTissue-Engineered Autologous Grafts for Facial Bone Reconstruction\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBhumiratana, Sarindr; Bernhard, Jonathan C.; Alfi, David M.; Yeager, Keith; Eton, Ryan E.; Bova, Jonathan; Shah, Forum; Gimble, Jeffrey M.; Lopez, Mandi J.; Eisig, Sidney B.; Vunjak-Novakovic, Gordana\n\n2016-01-01\n\nFacial deformities require precise reconstruction of the appearance and function of the original tissue. The current standard of careâthe use of bone harvested from another region in the bodyâhas major limitations, including pain and comorbidities associated with surgery. We have engineered one of the most geometrically complex facial bones by using autologous stromal/stem cells, without bone morphogenic proteins, using native bovine bone matrix and a perfusion bioreactor for the growth and transport of living grafts. The ramus-condyle unit (RCU), the most eminent load-bearing bone in the skull, was reconstructed using an image-guided personalized approach in skeletally mature Yucatan minipigs (human-scale preclinical model). We used clinically approved decellularized bovine trabecular bone as a scaffolding material, and crafted it into an anatomically correct shape using image-guided micromilling, to fit the defect. Autologous adipose-derived stromal/stem cells were seeded into the scaffold and cultured in perfusion for 3 weeks in a specialized bioreactor to form immature bone tissue. Six months after implantation, the engineered grafts maintained their anatomical structure, integrated with native tissues, and generated greater volume of new bone and greater vascular infiltration than either non-seeded anatomical scaffolds or untreated defects. This translational study demonstrates feasibility of facial bone reconstruction using autologous, anatomically shaped, living grafts formed in vitro, and presents a platform for personalized bone tissue engineering.

Four cadaveric heads (8 parotid regions), examined under 3-40x magnification, were dissected from lateral to medial to expose the EFN. In a vertical plane just anterior to the tragus, the distance from the superior edge of the ZA to the facial nerve (FN) is, on average, 26.88 mm. The FN then courses superiorly and anteriorly, crossing the ZA 18.65 mm anterior to the tragus on average. Thus, three points can be used to depict a triangle: A, at the level of the anterior border of the tragus, just above the superior edge of the ZA; B, 26 mm below A; and C, 18 mm anterior to A. This so called facial-zygomatic triangle represents the area where surgical dissection can be performed with no risk of damaging the FN. Thus, the closer one stays to the tragus, the lesser the risk of damaging the FN below the ZA. If the incision is carried out on a vertical plane closer to the tragus, the skin can be safely cut up to 2 cm below the ZA. The facial-zygomatic triangle is a very useful superficial landmark to avoid FN damage when working below the ZA.\n\nEfficacy of Honeycomb TCP-induced Microenvironment on Bone Tissue Regeneration in Craniofacial Area.\n\nPubMed\n\nWatanabe, Satoko; Takabatake, Kiyofumi; Tsujigiwa, Hidetsugu; Watanabe, Toshiyuki; Tokuyama, Eijiro; Ito, Satoshi; Nagatsuka, Hitoshi; Kimata, Yoshihiro\n\n2016-01-01\n\nArtificial bone materials that exhibit high biocompatibility have been developed and are being widely used for bone tissue regeneration. However, there are no biomaterials that are minimally invasive and safe. In a previous study, we succeeded in developing honeycomb Î²-tricalcium phosphate (Î²-TCP) which has through-and-through holes and is able to mimic the bone microenvironment for bone tissue regeneration. In the present study, we investigated how the difference in hole-diameter of honeycomb Î²-TCP (hole-diameter: 75, 300, 500, and 1600 Î¼m) influences bone tissue regeneration histologically. Its osteoconductivity was also evaluated by implantation into zygomatic bone defects in rats. The results showed that the maximum bone formation was observed on the Î²-TCP with hole-diameter 300Î¼m, included bone marrow-like tissue and the pattern of bone tissue formation similar to host bone. Therefore, the results indicated that we could control bone tissue formation by creating a bone microenvironment provided by Î²-TCP. Also, in zygomatic bone defect model with honeycomb Î²-TCP, the result showed there was osseous union and the continuity was reproduced between the both edges of resected bone and Î²-TCP, which indicated the zygomatic bone reproduction fully succeeded. It is thus thought that honeycomb Î²-TCP may serve as an excellent biomaterial for bone tissue regeneration in the head, neck and face regions, expected in clinical applications.\n\n[Pelvic reconstructions after bone tumor resection].\n\nPubMed\n\nAnract, Philippe; Biau, David; Babinet, Antoine; Tomeno, Bernard\n\n2014-02-01\n\nThe three more frequent primitive malignant bone tumour which concerned the iliac bone are chondrosarcoma, following Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma. Wide resection remains the most important part of the treatment associated with chemotherapy for osteosarcoma and the Ewing sarcoma. Iliac wing resections and obdurate ring don't required reconstruction. However, acetabular resections and iliac wing resection with disruption of the pelvic ring required reconstruction to provide acceptable functional result. Acetabular reconstruction remains high technical demanding challenge. After isolated acetabular resection or associated to obdurate ring, our usual method of reconstruction is homolateral proximal femoral autograft and total hip prosthesis but it is possible to also used : saddle prosthesis, Mac Minn prosthesis with auto or allograft, modular prosthesis or custom made prosthesis, massive allograft with or without prosthesis and femoro-ilac arthrodesis. After resection of the iliac wing plus acetabulum, reconstruction can be performed by femoro-obturatrice and femora-sacral arthrodesis, homolateral proximal femoral autograft and prosthesis, femoral medialisation, massive allograft and massive allograft. Carcinological results are lesser than resection for distal limb tumor, local recurrence rate range 17 to 45%. Functional results after Iliac wing and obdurate ring are good. However, acetabular reconstruction provide uncertain functional results. The lesser results arrive after hemipelvic or acetabular and iliac wing resection-reconstruction, especially when gluteus muscles were also resected. The most favourable results arrive after isolated acetabular or acetabular plus obturateur ring resection-reconstruction.\n\nComparative study between cortical bone graft versus bone dust for reconstruction of cranial burr holes\n\nPubMed Central\n\nWorm, Paulo V.; Ferreira, Nelson P.; Faria, Mario B.; Ferreira, Marcelo P.; Kraemer, Jorge L.; Collares, Marcus V. M.\n\n2010-01-01\n\nBackground: As a consequence of the progressive evolution of neurosurgical techniques, there has been increasing concern with the esthetic aspects of burr holes. Therefore, the objective of this study was to compare the use of cortical bone graft and bone dust for correcting cranial deformities caused by neurosurgical trephines. Methods: Twenty-three patients were enrolled for cranial burr hole reconstruction with a 1-year follow-up. A total of 108 burr holes were treated; 36 burr holes were reconstructed with autogenous cortical bone discs (33.3%), and the remaining 72 with autogenous wet bone powder (66.6%). A trephine was specifically designed to produce this coin-shaped bone plug of 14 mm in diameter, which fit perfectly over the burr holes. The reconstructions were studied 12 months after the surgical procedure, using three-dimensional quantitative computed tomography. Additionally, general and plastic surgeons blinded for the study evaluated the cosmetic results of those areas, attributing scores from 0 to 10. Results: The mean bone densities were 987.95 Â± 186.83 Hounsfield units (HU) for bone fragment and 473.55 Â± 220.34 HU for bone dust (P < 0.001); the mean cosmetic scores were 9.5 for bone fragment and 5.7 for bone dust (P < 0.001). Conclusions: The use of autologous bone discs showed better results than bone dust for the reconstruction of cranial burr holes because of their lower degree of bone resorption and, consequently, better cosmetic results. The lack of donor site morbidity associated with procedural low cost qualifies the cortical autograft as the first choice for correcting cranial defects created by neurosurgical trephines.

Apropos of 85 cases].\n\nPubMed\n\nAit Benhamou, C; Kadiri, F; Laraqui, N; Benghalem, A; Touhami, M; Chekkoury, A; Benchakroun, Y\n\n1996-01-01\n\nOur retrospective study has concerned 85 cases of zygomatic-orbito molar fractures, hospitalised and treated from january 1983 to december 1992. 86% of patients were men. The young adult is interested in 78% of cases. The traffic accidents are predominant in 45%. The diagnosis is especially, made by the clinic and confirmed by the radiology. The abstension is justificate in 27, 1% due to the absence of deplacement and associated disorders. The orthopedic treatment concerns the len deplaced (20% of cases) and stable molar fractures. The surgery such as reduction with osteosynthesis or reconstruction of floor is realised in 55% of patients presenting deplaced fractures with norphologic and/or fonctionel disorders. The evolution is good in general. Few sequellaes has been noted in 25% cases. The authors insist on the interest of the precocity of diagnosis and treatment and on the multidisciplinar collaboration which permit an adapted treatment with few sequellaes.\n\nCranial Bone Graft Donor Site Reconstruction.\n\nPubMed\n\nÃelik, Muzaffer\n\n2017-01-01\n\nMy most important concern, in my entire experience with cranial bone grafting procedures, is managing the bone graft donor site such as donor site cavity from harvesting and weakness of the cranium. The most common patient complaint, following cranial bone grafting for aesthetic indications, is the presence of a cavity at the donor site. The authors have managed more than 200 patients since 2001, wherein the cranial bone graft-donor sites were reconstructed with tiny bone chip lamellae harvested from the area adjacent to the donor site. This procedure was associated with a low incidence of patient complaints, thereby suggesting higher patient satisfaction. This approach for cranial bone grafting appears to have a high patient acceptance.\n\nEfficacy of Honeycomb TCP-induced Microenvironment on Bone Tissue Regeneration in Craniofacial Area\n\nPubMed Central\n\nWatanabe, Satoko; Takabatake, Kiyofumi; Tsujigiwa, Hidetsugu; Watanabe, Toshiyuki; Tokuyama, Eijiro; Ito, Satoshi; Nagatsuka, Hitoshi; Kimata, Yoshihiro\n\n2016-01-01\n\nArtificial bone materials that exhibit high biocompatibility have been developed and are being widely used for bone tissue regeneration. However, there are no biomaterials that are minimally invasive and safe. In a previous study, we succeeded in developing honeycomb Î²-tricalcium phosphate (Î²-TCP) which has through-and-through holes and is able to mimic the bone microenvironment for bone tissue regeneration. In the present study, we investigated how the difference in hole-diameter of honeycomb Î²-TCP (hole-diameter: 75, 300, 500, and 1600 Î¼m) influences bone tissue regeneration histologically. Its osteoconductivity was also evaluated by implantation into zygomatic bone defects in rats. The results showed that the maximum bone formation was observed on the Î²-TCP with hole-diameter 300Î¼m, included bone marrow-like tissue and the pattern of bone tissue formation similar to host bone. Therefore, the results indicated that we could control bone tissue formation by creating a bone microenvironment provided by Î²-TCP. Also, in zygomatic bone defect model with honeycomb Î²-TCP, the result showed there was osseous union and the continuity was reproduced between the both edges of resected bone and Î²-TCP, which indicated the zygomatic bone reproduction fully succeeded. It is thus thought that honeycomb Î²-TCP may serve as an excellent biomaterial for bone tissue regeneration in the head, neck and face regions, expected in clinical applications.

Published data for autogenous and alloplastic skull reconstructions were also examined to explore associations that might guide treatment. A retrospective review of autogenously reconstructed secondary skull defects was undertaken. A structured literature review was also performed to assess potential differences in reported outcomes between autogenous bone and synthetic alloplastic skull reconstructions. Weighted risks were calculated for statistical testing. Ninety-six patients underwent autogenous skull reconstruction for an average defect size of 93 cm (range, 4 to 506 cm) at a mean age of 12.9 years. The mean operative time was 3.4 hours, 2 percent required allogeneic blood transfusions, and the average length of stay was less than 3 days. The mean length of follow-up was 28 months. There were no postoperative infections requiring surgery, but one patient underwent secondary grafting for partial bone resorption. An analysis of 34 studies revealed that complications, infections, and reoperations were more commonly reported with alloplastic than with autogenous reconstructions (relative risk, 1.57, 4.8, and 1.48, respectively). Autogenous reconstructions are feasible, with minimal associated morbidity, for patients with skull defect sizes as large as 500 cm. A structured literature review suggests that autogenous bone reconstructions are associated with lower reported infection, complication, and reoperation rates compared with synthetic alloplasts. Based on these findings, surgeons might consider using autogenous reconstructions even for larger skull defects.

A statistical shape model (SSM) can be used to virtually reconstruct a glenoid bone defect and to predict the inclination, version, and center position of the native glenoid. An SSM-based reconstruction method has already been developed for acetabular bone reconstruction. The goal of this study was to evaluate the SSM-based method for the reconstruction of glenoid bone defects and the prediction of native anatomic parameters. First, an SSM was created on the basis of 66 healthy scapulae. Then, artificial bone defects were created in all scapulae and reconstructed using the SSM-based reconstruction method. For each bone defect, the reconstructed surface was compared with the original surface. Furthermore, the inclination, version, and glenoid center point of the reconstructed surface were compared with the original parameters of each scapula. For small glenoid bone defects, the healthy surface of the glenoid was reconstructed with a root mean square error of 1.2âÂ±â0.4 mm. Inclination, version, and glenoid center point were predicted with an accuracy of 2.4Â°âÂ±â2.1Â°, 2.9Â°âÂ±â2.2Â°, and 1.8âÂ±â0.8âmm, respectively. The SSM-based reconstruction method is able to accurately reconstruct the native glenoid surface and to predict the native anatomic parameters. Based on this outcome, statistical shape modeling can be considered a successful technique for use in the preoperative planning of shoulder arthroplasty.

For the reconstruction of smaller and more extensive defects we used predominantly (92.7%) autogenous (autologous) untreated spongiosa and in only 7% of the cases allogenic (homologous) spongiosa from an organ bank, this being added if necessary. Recently the additionally introduced vascularized bone chip has become a useful extension of the therapy concept. The problems and complications of defect reconstruction are demonstrated for 705 cases of bone infection with 472 defects of different sizes, based on a comprehensive classification with defect calculation. Surgical technical approach and special aspects of after-treatment are described, as well as the results for every group of cases. We achieved stability and freedom from infection in a total of 93.7% of the patients. As was to be expected, the problems grow with the size of the defect. Particularly problematic are joint infections with adjacent extensive circular defect.\n\nZygomatic implants placed using the zygomatic anatomy-guided approach versus the classical technique: a proposed system to report rhinosinusitis diagnosis.\n\nPubMed\n\nAparicio, Carlos; Manresa, Carolina; Francisco, Karen; Aparicio, Arnau; Nunes, Jonas; Claros, Pedro; Potau, Josep M\n\n2014-10-01\n\nThe first aim of this study is to compare the outcomes in rehabilitating the atrophic maxilla using zygomatic implants (ZIs) and regular implants (RIs) using the classical zygomatic technique (CZT) versus the zygomatic anatomy-guided approach (ZAGA). The second goal of this paper is to propose a standardized system to report rhinosinusitis diagnosis. Twenty-two consecutive zygomatic patients operated on from 1998 to 2002 and 80 consecutive zygomatic patients operated on from 2004 to October 2009 were selected. All included patients were in a maintenance program. Survival rates (SRs) of ZI and RI were recorded. Implants were individually tested using PeriotestÂ® (Periotest value [PTv], Siemens AG, Bensheim, UK). Sinus health was radiographically and clinically assessed according to Lund-Mackay system and Lanza and Kennedy survey recommended by Task Force on Rhinosinusitis for research outcomes. A satisfaction questionnaire (Oral Health Impact Profile for assessing health-related quality of life in Edentulous adults) and different anatomical measurements were also performed. No significant differences (pâ=â.602) were observed with respect to SR between the two groups (95.12% vs 96.79%). Significant differences (pâ=â.000) were found comparing measurements of ZI head distance to the alveolar crest (5.12âÂ±â2.38âmm vs 2.92âÂ±â2.30âmm). With the CZT, more palatal emergence of ZI was observed. PTv gave significantly greater stability for the CZT compared with the ZAGA group in both measurements (-4.38âÂ±â1.75 vs -2.49âÂ±â4.31, pâ=â.000; -4.94âÂ±â1.46 vs -3.11âÂ±â5.06, pâ=â.000). Lund-Mackay score was significantly lower for the ZAGA group (2.38âÂ±â3.86 vs 0.56âÂ±â1.26, pâ=â.042). Statistically significant difference (pâ=â.047) regarding the percentage of patients with no signs or symptoms of rhinosinusitis (Lanza and Kennedy test negative and Lund-Mackay score zero) was observed between groups (54.55% vs 76\n\nInfluence of the prosthetic arm length (palatal position) of zygomatic implants upon patient satisfaction\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPellicer-Chover, Hilario; Cervera-Ballester, Juan; PeÃ±arrocha-Oltra, David; BagÃ¡n, Leticia; PeÃ±arrocha-Diago, MarÃ­a\n\n2016-01-01\n\nBackground To assess the influence of the prosthetic arm length (palatal position) of zygomatic implants upon patient comfort and stability, speech, functionality and overall satisfaction. Material and Methods A retrospective clinical study was made of patients subjected to rehabilitation of atrophic maxilla with complete maxillary implant-supported fixed prostheses involving a minimum of two zygomatic implants (one on each side) in conjunction with premaxillary implants, and with 12 months of follow-up after implant loading. Subjects used a VAS to score general satisfaction, comfort and stability, speech and functionality, and the results were analyzed in relation to the prosthetic arm length of the zygomatic implants 12 months after prosthetic delivery. Results Twenty-two patients participated in the study, receiving 22 prostheses anchored on 148 implants (44 were zygomatic and 94 were conventional implants). The mean right and left prosthetic arm length was 5.9Â±2.4 mm and 6.1Â±2.7 mm, respectively, with no statistically significant differences between them (p=0.576). The mean scores referred to comfort/retention, speech, functionality and overall satisfaction were high - no correlation being found between prosthetic arm length and patient satisfaction (p=0.815). Conclusions No relationship could be identified between prosthetic arm length (palatal position) and patient satisfaction. Key words:Zygomatic implants, patient satisfaction, zygomatic prosthesis, prosthetic arm length.

Presenting complaints included exophthalmia, protrusion of the third eyelid, and periorbital swelling without any history of trauma. Low-field MRI allowed for adequate diagnosis of zygomatic gland disease in all cases and provided detailed information about both the specific tissue characteristics of each lesion and extension into surrounding structures. MRI findings were also helpful for surgical planning and dictated the choice of a modified lateral orbitotomy without removal of the orbital ligament. Histopathologic diagnosis for each of the three dogs was a mucocele, a malignant mixed salivary tumor, and sialadenitis.\n\nChest wall reconstruction using iliac bone allografts and muscle flaps.\n\nPubMed\n\nGarcia-Tutor, Emilio; Yeste, Luis; Murillo, Julio; AubÃ¡, Cristina; Sanjulian, Mikel; Torre, Wenceslao\n\n2004-01-01\n\nTechnically we can divide full-thickness thoracic reconstruction into 2 parts: providing a rigid support and ensuring well-vascularized coverage. Since 1986, the authors' center has had ample experience with bone banks and the use of cryopreserved bone grafts, which led them to consider the possibility of using these grafts for full-thickness chest wall reconstruction. They describe 3 patients in whom resection of the tumor and reconstruction of the thorax were carried out using iliac bone allografts covered with muscle flaps (1 pectoralis major and 2 rectus abdominis). None of the patients experienced breathing difficulties, pain, or instability after 14 months, 18 months, and 11 years of follow-up. The result of the reconstruction was excellent in all 3 patients in terms of function and aesthetics. The advantage of allografts compared with synthetic materials is their potential integration; they can become part of the host patient's living tissue.\n\nNovel composite implant in craniofacial bone reconstruction.\n\nPubMed\n\nPeltola, Matti J; Vallittu, Pekka K; Vuorinen, Ville; Aho, Allan A J; Puntala, Antti; Aitasalo, Kalle M J\n\n2012-02-01\n\nBioactive glass (BAG) and polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) have been used in clinical applications. Antimicrobial BAG has the ability to attach chemically to surrounding bone, but it is not possible to bend, drill or shape BAG during the operation. PMMA has advantages in terms of shaping during the operation, but it does not attach chemically to the bone and is an exothermic material. To increase the usefulness of BAG and PMMA in skull bone defect reconstructions, a new composite implant containing BAG and PMMA in craniofacial reconstructions is presented. Three patients had pre-existing large defects in the calvarial and one in the midface area. An additive manufacturing (AM) model was used preoperatively for treatment planning and custom-made implant production. The trunk of the PMMA implant was coated with BAG granules. Clinical and radiological follow-up was performed postoperatively at 1 week, and 3, 6 and 12 months, and thereafter annually up to 5 years. Computer tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography (PET-CT) were performed at 12 and 24 months postoperatively. Uneventful clinical recovery with good esthetic and functional outcome was seen. CT and PET-CT findings supported good clinical outcome. The BAG-PMMA implant seems to be a promising craniofacial reconstruction alternative. However, more clinical experience is needed.\n\nReconstruction of the mandible bone by treatment of resected bone with pasteurization.\n\nPubMed\n\nUehara, Masataka; Inokuchi, Tsugio; Sano, Kazuo; Sumita, Yoshinori; Tominaga, Kazuhiro; Asahina, Izumi\n\n2012-11-01\n\nThe results of long-term follow-up for reimplantation of the mandibular bone treated with pasteurization are reported. Mandibulectomy was performed for mandibular malignancy in 3 cases. The resected bones were subsequently reimplanted after treatment with pasteurization in 3 cases to eradicate tumor cells involved in the resected bone. Although postoperative infection was observed in 2 of 3 cases, reimplantation of the resected mandibular bone treated by pasteurization was finally successful. Ten to 22 years of follow-up was carried out. Pasteurization was able to devitalize tumor cells involved in the resected bone and to preserve bone-inductive activity. Reimplantation of pasteurization could be a useful strategy for reconstruction of the mandible in patients with mandibular malignancy.\n\nReconstruction of mandibular defects with autogenous bone grafts: a review of 30 cases.\n\nPubMed\n\nSajid, Malik Ali Hassan; Warraich, Riaz Ahmed; Abid, Hina; Ehsan-ul-Haq, Muhammad; Shah, Khurram Latif; Khan, Zafar\n\n2011-01-01\n\nMultitudes of options are available for reconstruction of functional and cosmetic defects of the mandible, caused by various ailments. At the present time, autogenous bone grafting is the gold standard by which all other techniques of reconstruction of the mandible can be judged. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the outcome of different osseous reconstruction options using autogenous bone grafts for mandibular reconstruction. This Interventional study was conducted at Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, King Edward Medical University/Mayo Hospital Lahore, from January 2008 to July 2009 including one year follow-up. The study was carried out on thirty patients having bony mandibular defects. They were reconstructed with the autogenous bone grafts from different graft donor sites. On post-operative visits they were evaluated for outcome variables. Success rate of autogenous bone grafts in this study was 90%. Only 10% of the cases showed poor results regarding infection, resorption and graft failure. Autogenous bone grafts, non-vascularised or vascularised, are a reliable treatment modality for the reconstruction of the bony mandibular defects with predictable functional and aesthetic outcome.\n\nVisualization of postoperative anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction bone tunnels\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2011-01-01\n\nBackground and purpose Non-anatomic bone tunnel placement is the most common cause of a failed ACL reconstruction. Accurate and reproducible methods to visualize and document bone tunnel placement are therefore important. We evaluated the reliability of standard radiographs, CT scans, and a 3-dimensional (3D) virtual reality (VR) approach in visualizing and measuring ACL reconstruction bone tunnel placement. Methods 50 consecutive patients who underwent single-bundle ACL reconstructions were evaluated postoperatively by standard radiographs, CT scans, and 3D VR images. Tibial and femoral tunnel positions were measured by 2 observers using the traditional methods of Amis, Aglietti, Hoser, StÃ¤ubli, and the method of Benereau for the VR approach. Results The tunnel was visualized in 50â82% of the standard radiographs and in 100% of the CT scans and 3D VR images. Using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), the inter- and intraobserver agreement was between 0.39 and 0.83 for the standard femoral and tibial radiographs. CT scans showed an ICC range of 0.49â0.76 for the inter- and intraobserver agreement. The agreement in 3D VR was almost perfect, with an ICC of 0.83 for the femur and 0.95 for the tibia. Interpretation CT scans and 3D VR images are more reliable in assessing postoperative bone tunnel placement following ACL reconstruction than standard radiographs.

METHODS: A retrospective study had been preformed to compare the outcomes among patients who received pelvic reconstructive surgery with allogeneic bone graft after en bloc resection of pelvic tumors and patients who received en bloc resection only. RESULTS: Patients without reconstruction had significantly lower functional scores at 3 months (10 vs. 15, P = 0.001) and 6 months after surgery (18.5 vs. 22, P = 0.0024), a shorter duration of hospitalization (16 day vs. 40 days, P < 0.001), and lower hospitalization costs (97,500 vs. 193,000 RMB, P < 0.001) than those who received pelvic reconstruction. Functional scores were similar at 12 months after surgery (21.5 vs. 23, P = 0.365) with no difference in the rate of complications between the two groups (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS : Pelvic reconstruction with allogeneic bone graft after surgical management of pelvic tumors is associated with satisfactory surgical and functional outcomes. Further clinical studies are required to explore how to select the best reconstruction method. Level of Evidence IV, Case Series.

In this study, porous scaffolds for bone reconstruction were prepared using heat-pressing and salt-leaching methods. High-density polyethylene (HDPE) and poly(ethylene-co-acrylic acid) (PEAA) were chosen as the polymer composites for producing a porous scaffold of high mechanical strength and having high reactivity with biomaterials such as collagen, respectively. The porous structure was observed through surface images, and its intrusion volume and porosity were measured. Owing to the carboxylic acids on PEAA, collagen was successfully grafted onto the porous HDPE/PEAA scaffold, which was confirmed by FT-IR spectroscopy and electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis. Osteoblasts were cultured on the collagen-grafted porous scaffold, and their adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation were investigated. The high viability and growth of the osteoblasts suggest that the collagen-grafted porous HDPE/PEAA is a promising scaffold material for bone generation.\n\nCranial Reconstruction Using Autologous Bone and Methylmethacrilate.\n\nPubMed\n\nNovakoviÄ, Nenad; MalivukoviÄ, Ana; MiniÄ, Ljubodrag; LepiÄ, Milan; MandiÄ-RajÄeviÄ, Stefan; RasuliÄ, Lukas\n\n2017-06-01\n\nHaving in mind the importance of reconstruction of the calvaria, our goal was to compare the complication rates following the use of autologous bone and methylmethacrilate grafts, and explain the factors influencing them. The authors collected information of all the patients undergoing cranial reconstructive surgery (Nâ=â149) at the Military Medical Academy in Belgrade. Procedures were performed either using a craniotomy bone flap, removed and replaced in the same act, or using methylmethacrilate. These 2 groups were compared using the Chi-squared test, controlling for the confounding influence of the size of the defect. Intracranial neoplasms were the cause for the reconstruction in 71.1% of patients. The total complication rate was 7.4%, while the infection rate was 5.4%. The infection rate was significantly higher in those procedures done using methylmethacrilate (11.3% compared with 2.1%, Pâ=â0.017), but when controlling for the confounding effect of the size of the defect treated, the difference in infection rate was significant only in large defects (13.9% compared with 2%, Pâ=â0.031), while for small defects the difference was not statistically significant. Our study suggests that the material used for reconstruction of calvaria influences the infection rate only in large and complicated defects. Considering the importance of the reconstruction, further studies should explore and confirm the role of material type on the rate of complications.\n\nReconstruction of large diaphyseal bone defect by simplified bone transport over nail technique: A 7-case series.\n\nPubMed\n\nFerchaud, F; Rony, L; Ducellier, F; Cronier, P; Steiger, V; Hubert, L\n\n2017-11-01\n\nReconstruction of large diaphyseal bone defect is complex and the complications rate is high. This study aimed to assess a simplified technique of segmental bone transport by monorail external fixator over an intramedullary nail.A prospective study included 7 patients: 2 femoral and 5 tibial defects. Mean age was 31years (range: 16-61years). Mean follow-up was 62 months (range: 46-84months). Defects were post-traumatic, with a mean length of 7.2cm (range: 4 to 9.5cm). For 3 patients, reconstruction followed primary failure. In 4 cases, a covering flap was necessary. Transport used an external fixator guided by an intramedullary nail, at a rate of 1mm per day. One pin was implanted on either side of the distraction zone. The external fixator was removed 1 month after bone contact at the docking site. Mean bone transport time was 11 weeks (range: 7-15 weeks). Mean external fixation time was 5.1months (range: 3.5 to 8months). Full weight-bearing was allowed 5.7months (range: 3.5-13months) after initiation of transport. In one patient, a pin had to be repositioned. In 3 patients, the transported segment re-ascended after external fixatorablation, requiring repeat external fixation and resumption of transport. There was just 1 case of superficial pin infection. Reconstruction quality was considered \"excellent\" on the Paley-Marr criteria in 6 cases. The present technique provided excellent reconstruction quality in 6 of the 7 cases. External fixation time was shorter and resumption of weight-bearing earlier than with other reconstruction techniques, notably including bone autograft, vascularized bone graft or the induced membrane technique. Nailing facilitated control of limb axis and length. The complications rate was 50%, comparable to other techniques. This study raises the question of systematic internal fixation of the docking site, to avoid any mobilization of the transported segment. The bone quality, axial control and rapidity shown by the present technique make\n\nOutcome of bone recycling using liquid nitrogen as bone reconstruction procedure in malignant and recurrent benign aggressive bone tumour of distal tibia: A report of four cases.\n\nPubMed\n\nGede, Eka Wiratnaya I; Ida Ayu, Arrisna Artha; Setiawan I Gn, Yudhi; Aryana Ign, Wien; I Ketut, Suyasa; I Ketut, Siki Kawiyana; Putu, Astawa\n\n2017-01-01\n\nAmputation still considered as primary choice of malignancy treatment in distal tibia. Bone recycling with liquid nitrogen for reconstruction following resection of malignant bone tumours offers many advantages. We presented four patients with osteosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, adamantinoma and recurrent giant cell tumour over distal tibia. All of the patients underwent wide excision and bone recycling using liquid nitrogen as bone reconstruction. The mean functional Musculoskeletal Tumor Society (MSTS) score was 75% with no infection and local recurrent. The reconstruction provides good local control and functional outcome.\n\nComputer-assisted midface reconstruction in Treacher Collins syndrome part 1: skeletal reconstruction.\n\nPubMed\n\nHerlin, Christian; Doucet, Jean Charles; Bigorre, MichÃ¨le; Khelifa, Hatem Cheikh; Captier, Guillaume\n\n2013-10-01\n\nTreacher Collins syndrome (TCS) is a severe and complex craniofacial malformation affecting the facial skeleton and soft tissues. The palate as well as the external and middle ear are also affected, but his prognosis is mainly related to neonatal airway management. Methods of zygomatico-orbital reconstruction are numerous and currently use primarily autologous bone, lyophilized cartilage, alloplastic implants, or even free flaps. This work developed a reliable \"customized\" method of zygomatico-orbital bony reconstruction using a generic reference model tailored to each patient. From a standard computed tomography (CT) acquisition, we studied qualitatively and quantitatively the skeleton of four individuals with TCS whose age was between 6 and 20 years. In parallel, we studied 40 controls at the same age to obtain a morphometric database of reference. Surgical simulation was carried out using validated software used in craniofacial surgery. The zygomatic hypoplasia was very important quantitatively and morphologically in all TCS individuals. Orbital involvement was mainly morphological, with volumes comparable to the controls of the same age. The control database was used to create three-dimensional computer models to be used in the manufacture of cutting guides for autologous cranial bone grafts or alloplastic implants perfectly adapted to each patient's morphology. Presurgical simulation was also used to fabricate custom positioning guides permitting a simple and reliable surgical procedure. The use of a virtual database allowed us to design a reliable and reproducible skeletal reconstruction method for this rare and complex syndrome. The use of presurgical simulation tools seem essential in this type of craniofacial malformation to increase the reliability of these uncommon and complex surgical procedures, and to ensure stable results over time.

We asked whether reconstruction with a circumferential metal mesh, impacted bone allografts, and a cemented stem would lead to acceptable survival in these patients. We retrospectively reviewed 14 patients (15 hips) with severe proximal femoral bone defects (average, 12Â cm long; 14 type IV and one type IIIB using the classification of Della Valle and Paprosky) reconstructed with this method. The minimum followup was 20Â months (average, 43.2Â months; range, 20â72Â months). Preoperative Merle DâAubignÃ© and Postel score averaged 4.8 points. With revision of the stem as the end point, the survivorship of the implant was 100% at one year and 86.6% at 72Â months. The mean functional score at last followup was 14.4 points. We observed two fractures of the metal mesh at 31 and 48Â months in cases reconstructed with a stem that did not bypass the mesh. Dislocation (3 cases) and acute deep infection (3 cases) were the most frequent complications. Patients with complete absence of the proximal femur may be candidates for biological proximal femoral reconstructions using this salvage procedure. Bone impaction grafting must be a routine technique if this method is selected. Level of Evidence: Level IV, therapeutic study.

This study retrospectively evaluated 106 hips that underwent acetabular reconstruction using a KT plate between November 2000 and December 2010. Thirty-eight primary total hip arthoplasties (THAs) and 68 revised THAs were performed, and the mean duration of clinical follow-up was 8 years (5-14 years). Regarding reconstructing the acetabular bone defects, autografts were used in 37 hips, allografts in 68 hips, and A-W glass ceramics in 2 hips. One hip exhibited radiological migration and no revision for aseptic loosening. The mean Merle d'AubignÃ© Clinical Score improved from 7.5 points (4-12 points) preoperatively to 10.9 points (9-18 points) at the last follow-up. The Kaplan-Meier survival rate for radiological migration of primary and revised THAs at 10 years was 100% and 97% (95% confidence interval: 96%-100%), respectively. Bone remodeling was evaluated using the radiological demarcation at the bone-to-bone interface, and an improvement of 100% in primary THAs and 94% in revised THAs was observed. For massive bone defects, acetabular reconstruction using the KT plate with a structural bone grafting can yield successful results. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Inc.
