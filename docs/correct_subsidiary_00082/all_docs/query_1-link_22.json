        "text": "The elution of colistimethate sodium from polymethylmethacrylate and calcium phosphate cement beads.\n\nPubMed\n\nWaterman, Paige; Barber, Melissa; Weintrob, Amy C; VanBrakle, Regina; Howard, Robin; Kozar, Michael P; Andersen, Romney; Wortmann, Glenn\n\n2012-06-01\n\nGram-negative bacilli resistance to all antibiotics, except for colistimethate sodium (CMS), is an emerging healthcare concern. Incorporating CMS into orthopedic cement to treat bone and soft-tissue infections due to these bacteria is attractive, but the data regarding the elution of CMS from cement are conflicting. The in vitro analysis of the elution of CMS from polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) and calcium phosphate (CP) cement beads is reported. PMMA and CP beads containing CMS were incubated in phosphate-buffered saline and the eluate sampled at sequential time points. The inhibition of the growth of a strain of Acinetobacter baumannii complex by the eluate was measured by disk diffusion and microbroth dilution assays, and the presence of CMS in the eluate was measured by mass spectroscopy. Bacterial growth was inhibited by the eluate from both PMMA and CP beads. Mass spectroscopy demonstrated greater elution of CMS from CP beads than PMMA beads. The dose of CMS in PMMA beads was limited by failure of bead integrity. CMS elutes from both CP and PMMA beads in amounts sufficient to inhibit bacterial growth in vitro. The clinical implications of these findings require further study.\n\nA modified PMMA cement (Sub-cement) for accelerated fatigue testing of cemented implant constructs using cadaveric bone.\n\nPubMed\n\nRace, Amos; Miller, Mark A; Mann, Kenneth A\n\n2008-10-20\n\nPre-clinical screening of cemented implant systems could be improved by modeling the longer-term response of the implant/cement/bone construct to cyclic loading. We formulated bone cement with degraded fatigue fracture properties (Sub-cement) such that long-term fatigue could be simulated in short-term cadaver tests. Sub-cement was made by adding a chain-transfer agent to standard polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) cement. This reduced the molecular weight of the inter-bead matrix without changing reaction-rate or handling characteristics. Static mechanical properties were approximately equivalent to normal cement. Over a physiologically reasonable range of stress-intensity factor, fatigue crack propagation rates for Sub-cement were higher by a factor of 25+/-19. When tested in a simplified 2 1/2-D physical model of a stem-cement-bone system, crack growth from the stem was accelerated by a factor of 100. Sub-cement accelerated both crack initiation and growth rate. Sub-cement is now being evaluated in full stem/cement/femur models.\n\nEffects of loading concentration, blood and synovial fluid on antibiotic release and anti-biofilm activity of bone cement beads.\n\nPubMed\n\nDusane, Devendra H; Diamond, Scott M; Knecht, Cory S; Farrar, Nicholas R; Peters, Casey W; Howlin, Robert P; Swearingen, Matthew C; Calhoun, Jason H; Plaut, Roger D; Nocera, Tanya M; Granger, Jeffrey F; Stoodley, Paul\n\n2017-02-28\n\nAntibiotic loaded cement beads are commonly used for the treatment of biofilm related orthopaedic periprosthetic infections; however the effects of antibiotic loading and exposure of beads to body fluids on release kinetics are unclear. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of (i) antibiotic loading density (ii) loading amount (iii) material type and (iv) exposure to body fluids (blood or synovial fluid) on release kinetics and efficacy of antibiotics against planktonic and lawn biofilm bacteria. Short-term release into an agar gel was evaluated using a fluorescent tracer (fluorescein) incorporated in the carrier materials calcium sulfate (CaSO 4 ) and poly methyl methacrylate (PMMA). Different fluorescein concentrations in CaSO 4 beads were evaluated. Mechanical properties of fluorescein-incorporated beads were analyzed. Efficacy of the antibiotics vancomycin (VAN) or tobramycin (TOB) alone and in combination was evaluated against lawn biofilms of bioluminescent strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Zones of inhibition of cultures (ZOI) were measured visually and using an in-vivo imaging system (IVIS). The influence of body fluids on release was assessed using CaSO 4 beads that contained fluorescein or antibiotics and were pre-coated with human blood or synovial fluid. The spread from the beads followed a square root of time relationship in all cases. The loading concentration had no influence on short-term fluorescein release and pre-coating of beads with body fluids did not affect short-term release or antibacterial activity. Compared to PMMA, CaSO 4 had a more rapid short term rate of elution and activity against planktonic and lawn biofilms. This study highlights the importance of considering antibiotic loading and packing density when investigating the clinical application of bone cements for infection management.

It was tested in an attempt to improve on the conventionally used pure PMMA bone cement. By knowing the densities of the powders and their volumes, the mass of each was calculated for the most efficient packing of PMMA and Al2O3 powders and a 65% PMMA: 35% Al2O3 ratio by weight composition was determined. This was tested, as well as the pure cement so comparisons could be made. Cylinders for the strength tests were also made of silane treated Al2O3. The compositions were tested for compressive and tensile strengths. The pure PMMA, composite and silane treated composite had compressive strengths of 79.64 +/- 13.0, 83.17 +/- 4.8, and 71.52 +/- 8.6 MPa and the tensile strengths were 6.69 +/- 0.6, 5.12 +/- 0.3, and 7.12 +/- 0.5 MPa respectively. Also the 65%-35% PMMA-Al2O3 composite required 64% less monomer for mixing than did the pure cement which is thought to be better for tissue healing. The maximum temperature attained from room temperature was 110 degrees-115 degrees C for both cements. The composite took 6.5 min longer to reach its peak temperature than did the pure cement. The bone cements were implanted for one week in a rabbit and both compositions seemed acceptable by the tissue.\n\nBiomechanical evaluation of bone screw fixation with a novel bone cement.\n\nPubMed\n\nJuvonen, Tiina; Nuutinen, Juha-Pekka; Koistinen, Arto P; KrÃ¶ger, Heikki; Lappalainen, Reijo\n\n2015-07-30\n\nBone cement augmentation is commonly used to improve the fixation stability of orthopaedic implants in osteoporotic bone. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of novel bone cements on the stability of bone screw fixation by biomechanical testing and to compare them with a conventional Simplex(Â®)P bone cement and requirements of the standards. Basic biomechanical properties were compared with standard tests. Adhesion of bone cements were tested with polished, glass blasted and corundum blasted stainless steel surfaces. Screw pullout testing with/without cement was carried out using a synthetic bone model and cancellous and cortical bone screws. All the tested bone cements fulfilled the requirements of the standard for biomechanical properties and improved the screw fixation stability. Even a threefold increase in shear and tensile strength was achieved with increasing surface roughness. The augmentation improved the screw pullout force compared to fixation without augmentation, 1.2-5.7 times depending on the cement and the screw type. The good biomechanical properties of novel bone cement for osteoporotic bone were confirmed by experimental testing. Medium viscosity of the bone cements allowed easy handling and well-controlled penetration of bone cement into osteoporotic bone. By proper parameters and procedures it is possible to achieve biomechanically stable fixation in osteoporotic bone. Based on this study, novel biostable bone cements are very potential biomaterials to enhance bone screw fixation in osteoporotic bone. Novel bone cement is easy to use without hand mixing using a dual syringe and thus makes it possibility to use it as required during the operation.\n\nEnhanced bone screw fixation with biodegradable bone cement in osteoporotic bone model.\n\nPubMed\n\nJuvonen, Tiina; Koistinen, Arto; KrÃ¶ger, Heikki; Lappalainen, Reijo\n\n2012-09-27\n\nThe purpose of this study was to study the potential of novel biodegradable PCL bone cement to improve bone screw fixation strength in osteoporotic bone. The biomechanical properties of bone cement (Îµ-polycaprolactone, PCL) and fixation strength were studied using biomechanical tests and bone screws fixed in an osteoporotic bone model. Removal torques and pullout strengths were assessed for cortical, self-tapping, and cancellous screws inserted in the osteoporotic bone model (polyurethane foam blocks with polycarbonate plate) with and without PCL bone cement. Open cell and cellular rigid foam blocks with a density of 0.12 g/cm3 were used in this model. Removal torques were significantly (more than six-fold) improved with bone cement for cancellous screws. Furthermore, the bone cement improved pullout strengths three to 12 times over depending on the screw and model material. Biodegradable bone cement turned out to be a very potential material to stabilize screw fixation in osteoporotic bone. The results warrant further research before safe clinical use, especially to clarify clinically relevant factors using real osteoporotic bone under human body conditions and dynamic fatigue testing for long-term performance.\n\nPre-packing of cost effective antibiotic cement beads for the treatment of traumatic osteomyelitis in the developing world - an in-vitro study based in Cambodia.\n\nPubMed\n\nNoor, S; Gilson, A; Kennedy, K; Swanson, A; Vanny, V; Mony, K; Chaudhry, T; Gollogly, J\n\n2016-04-01\n\nThe developing world often lacks the resources to effectively treat the most serious injuries including osteomyelitis following open fractures or surgical fracture treatment. Antibiotic cement beads are a widely accepted method of delivering antibiotics locally to the infected area following trauma. This study is based in Cambodia, a low income country struggling to recover from a recent genocide. The study aims to test the effectiveness of locally made antibiotic beads and analyse their effectiveness after being gas sterilised, packaged and kept in storage Different antibiotic beads were manufactured locally using bone cement and tested against MRSA bacteria grown from a case of osteomyelitis. Each antibiotic was tested before and after a process of gas sterilisation as well as later being tested after storage in packaging up to 42 days. The gentamicin, vancomycin, amikacin and ceftriaxone beads all inhibited growth of the MRSA on the TSB and agar plates, both before and after gas sterilisation. All four antibiotics continued to show similar zones of inhibition after 42 days of storage. The results show significant promise to produce beads with locally obtainable ingredients in an austere environment and improve cost effectiveness by storing them in a sterilised condition.

This contribution considers a continuum-mechanically based modelling approach and simulation techniques to predict the cement distributions within a vertebra during injection. To do so, experimental investigations, imaging data and image processing techniques are combined and exploited to extract necessary data from high-resolution Î¼CT image data. The multiphasic model is based on the Theory of Porous Media, providing the theoretical basis to describe within one set of coupled equations the interaction of an elastically deformable solid skeleton, of liquid bone cement and the displacement of liquid bone marrow. The simulation results are validated against an experiment, in which bone cement was injected into a human vertebra under realistic conditions. The major advantage of this comprehensive modelling approach is the fact that one can not only predict the complex cement flow within an entire vertebra but is also capable of taking into account solid deformations in a fully coupled manner. The presented work is the first step towards the ultimate and future goal of extending this framework to a clinical tool allowing for pre-operative cement distribution predictions by means of numerical simulations.

To realize this, Î±-TCP/HAp functionally graded porous beads are fabricated with two main purposes: to maintain the function of the scaffold with sufficient strength up to the growth of new bone, and is absorbed completely after the growth. HAp is a bioactive material that has both high strength and strong tissue-adhesive properties, but is not readily absorbed by the human body. On the contrary, Î±-TCP is highly bioabsorbable, resulting in a scaffold that is absorbed before it is completely replaced by bone. In this study, we produced porous, bead-shaped carriers as scaffolds for osteoblast culture. To control the solubility in vivo, the fabricated beads contained Î±-TCP at the center and HAp at the surface. Cell adaptability of these beads for bone tissue engineering was confirmed in vitro. It was found that Î±-TCP/HAp bead carriers exhibit low toxicity in the initial stages of cell seeding and cell adhesion. The presence of HAp in the composite bead form effectively increased ALP activity. In conclusion, it is suggested that these newly developed Î±-TCP/HAp beads are a promising tool for bone tissue engineering.

The purpose of this study was to identify thresholds of cement morphology parameters to maximize fixation strength using a minimum amount of cement. Twenty-three cadaveric tibiae were analyzed that had been implanted with tibial trays in previous studies and for which the pull-out strength of the tray had been measured. Specimens were separated into a group failing at the cement-bone interface (INTERFACE) and one failing in the bulk bone (BULK). Maximum pull-out strength corresponds to the ultimate strength of the bulk bone if the cement-bone interface is sufficiently strong. 3D models of the cement mantle in situ were reconstructed from computed tomography scans. The influences of bone mineral density and 6 cement morphology parametersÂ (reflecting cement penetration, bone-cement interface, cement volume) on pull-out strength of the BULK group were determined using multiple regression analysis. The threshold of each parameter for classification of the specimens into either group was determined using receiver operating characteristicÂ analysis. Cement penetration exceeding a mean of 1.1 mm or with a maximum of 5.6 mm exclusively categorized all BULK bone failure specimens. Failure strength of BULK failure specimens increased with bone mineral density (R 2 Â = 0.67, P < .001) but was independent of the cement morphology parameters. To maximize fixation strength, a mean cement penetration depth of at least 1.1 mm should be achieved during tibial tray cementing. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Despite extensive fire safety education and training, complete elimination of OR fires still has not been achieved. Each fire requires an ignition source, a fuel source, and an oxidizer. In this case report, we describe the potential fire hazard of bone cement in the OR. A total knee arthroplasty was performed with a standard medial parapatellar arthrotomy. Tourniquet control was used. After bone cement was applied to the prepared tibial surface, the surgeon used an electrocautery device to resect residual lateral meniscus tissue-and started a fire in the operative field. The surgeon suffocated the fire with a dry towel and prevented injury to the patient. We performed a PubMed search with a cross-reference search for relevant papers and found no case reports outlining bone cement as a potential fire hazard in the OR. To our knowledge, this is the first case report identifying bone cement as a fire hazard. OR fires related to bone cement can be eliminated by correctly assessing the setting time of the cement and avoiding application sites during electrocautery.\n\nFiber-enriched double-setting calcium phosphate bone cement.\n\nPubMed\n\ndos Santos, LuÃ­s Alberto; CarrodÃ©guas, RaÃºl Garcia; Boschi, Anselmo Ortega; Fonseca de Arruda, AntÃ´nio Celso\n\n2003-05-01\n\nCalcium phosphate bone cements are useful in orthopedics and traumatology, their main advantages being their biocompatibility and bioactivity, which render bone tissue osteoconductive, providing in situ hardening and easy handling. However, their low mechanical strength, which, in the best of cases, is equal to the trabecular bone, and their very low toughness are disadvantages. Calcium phosphate cement compositions with mechanical properties more closely resembling those of human bone would broaden the range of applications, which is currently limited to sites subjected to low loads. This study investigated the influence of added polypropylene, nylon, and carbon fibers on the mechanical properties of double setting alpha-tricalcium phosphate-based cement, using calcium phosphate cement added to an in situ polymerizable acrylamide-based system recently developed by the authors. Although the addition of fibers was found to reduce the compression strength of the double-setting calcium phosphate cement because of increased porosity, it strongly increased the cement's toughness (J(IC)) and tensile strength. The composites developed in this work, therefore, have a potential application in shapes subjected to flexure.

From December 2010 to December 2012, 32 patients with severe OVCFs were randomly assigned to either group H using high viscosity cement (n=14) or group L using low viscosity cement (n=18). The clinical outcomes were assessed by the Visual Analog Scale (VAS), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), Short Form-36 General Health Survey (SF-36), kyphosis Cobb's angle, vertebral height, and complications. Significant improvement in the VAS, ODI, SF-36 scores, kyphosis Cobb's angle, and vertebral height were noted in both the groups, and there were no significant differences between the two groups. Cement leakage was seen less in group H. Postoperative assessment using computed tomography identified cement leakage in 5 of 17 (29.4%) vertebrae in group H and in 15 of 22 (68.2%) vertebrae in group L (P=0.025). The PVP using high viscosity bone cement can provide the same clinical outcome and fewer complications compared with PVP using low viscosity bone cement. Copyright Â© 2014.

Bone cement was soaked in Ringer's body solution to test its capacity of fast formation of hydroxyapatite crystals and self-solidification. Scan electronic microscope (SEM) observation and compressive strength measurement were taken to analyze the mechanical properties and the micro- morphological structure of CF reinforced alpha-TCP bone cement. The results showed that the bone cement was transferred into hydroxyapatite plates after being soaked in Ringer's simulated body fluid for 5 days. Suitable amount of carbon fibers could well spread in and bond with the matrix of the bone cement. The mechanical properties of the bone cement have been improved by CF reinforcing; the compressive strength reaches 46.7 MPa when the amount of carbon fibers is 0.5% in weight percent, which is 22% higher than that of the non-reinforced alpha-TCP bone cement.\n\n[Significance of bone mineral density and modern cementing technique for in vitro cement penetration in total shoulder arthroplasty].\n\nPubMed\n\nPape, G; Raiss, P; Kleinschmidt, K; Schuld, C; Mohr, G; Loew, M; Rickert, M\n\n2010-12-01\n\nLoosening of the glenoid component is one of the major causes of failure in total shoulder arthroplasty. Possible risk factors for loosening of cemented components include an eccentric loading, poor bone quality, inadequate cementing technique and insufficient cement penetration. The application of a modern cementing technique has become an established procedure in total hip arthroplasty. The goal of modern cementing techniques in general is to improve the cement-penetration into the cancellous bone. Modern cementing techniques include the cement vacuum-mixing technique, retrograde filling of the cement under pressurisation and the use of a pulsatile lavage system. The main purpose of this study was to analyse cement penetration into the glenoid bone by using modern cement techniques and to investigate the relationship between the bone mineral density (BMD) and the cement penetration. Furthermore we measured the temperature at the glenoid surface before and after jet-lavage of different patients during total shoulder arthroplasty. It is known that the surrounding temperature of the bone has an effect on the polymerisation of the cement. Data from this experiment provide the temperature setting for the in-vitro study. The glenoid surface temperature was measured in 10 patients with a hand-held non-contact temperature measurement device. The bone mineral density was measured by DEXA. Eight paired cadaver scapulae were allocated (n = 16). Each pair comprised two scapulae from one donor (matched-pair design). Two different glenoid components were used, one with pegs and the other with a keel. The glenoids for the in-vitro study were prepared with the bone compaction technique by the same surgeon in all cases. Pulsatile lavage was used to clean the glenoid of blood and bone fragments. Low viscosity bone cement was applied retrogradely into the glenoid by using a syringe. A constant pressure was applied with a modified force sensor impactor.

The objectives of our study were to evaluate different ALABC for elution kinetics, thermal stability, and mechanical properties. A 10 or 20% mixture (w/w) beads of medium viscosity bone cement (DePuy, Inc) and vancomycin (VAN), gentamycin (GM), daptomycin (DAP), moxifloxacin (MOX), rifampicin (RIF), cefotaxime (CTX), cefepime (FEP), amoxicillin clavulanate (AmC), ampicillin (AMP), meropenem (MER), and ertapenem (ERT) were formed and placed into wells filled with phosphate-buffered saline. Antibiotic concentrations were determined using high-performance liquid chromatography. Antimicrobial activity was tested against Micrococcus luteus ATCC 9341 or Escherichia coli ATCC 25922. AmC, AMP, and FEP concentration rapidly decreased after day 2, being almost undetectable at day 4. Sustained and high elution rates were observed with VAN, GM, MOX, and RIF for the 30-day duration of the experiment. DAP, MER, ERT, and CTX elution rates constantly decreased from day 4. All antibiotics tested retained antimicrobial activity proving thermal stability. Mechanical properties of ALABC were maintained except when RIF was used.

Bacterial cellulose, a three-dimensional hydrophilic mesh, may retain antibiotics and release them gradually. We hypothesized that the addition of cellulose to antibiotic bone cement would improve mechanical strength and antibiotic release. Questions/purposes We therefore examined the mechanical strength and antibiotic release of cellulose antibiotic cement. Methods A high dose of antibiotics (5Â g per 40Â g cement powder) was incorporated into bacterial cellulose and then mixed with bone cement. We compared the compression strength, fracture toughness, fatigue life, and elution kinetics of this formulation with those of plain cement and a traditional antibiotic cement. Results The average values for compression strength, fracture toughness, and fatigue life of the cellulose antibiotic cement were 97%, 97%, and 78% of the values obtained for plain cement, respectively. The corresponding values for the traditional antibiotic cement were 79%, 82%, and 17%, respectively. The cumulative elution over 35Â days was 129% greater from the cellulose antibiotic cement than from the traditional antibiotic cement. Conclusions With a high dose of antibiotics, incorporating cellulose into the bone cement prevented compression and fracture fragility, improved fatigue life, and increased antibiotic elution. Clinical Relevance Antibiotic cements containing cellulose may have applications in clinical situations that require high levels of antibiotic release and preservation of the mechanical properties of the cement. PMID:20945120\n\nCalcium phosphate compatible bone cement: Characterization, bonding properties and tissue response\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRoemhildt, Maria Lynn\n\nA novel, inorganic, bone cement, containing calcium phosphate, developed for implant fixation was evaluated. Setting properties were determined over a range of temperatures. The flow of the cement was greatly increased by application of vibration. Changes in the cement during hydration and aging were evaluated. Compressive strength of the cement over time was studied under simulated physiological conditions from 1 hour to 1 year after setting. After 1 day, this cement had equivalent compressive strength to commercially used PMMA cement. The strength was found to increase over 1 month and high strength was maintained up to 1 year. The shear strength of the cement-metal interface was studied in vitro using a pull-out test. Prepared specimens were stored under physiological conditions and tested at 4 hours, 24 hours, and 60 days. Comparable interfacial shear strength values were found at 4 hours, 24 hours and 60 days for the experimental cement and were not significantly different from values obtained for PMMA cement. In vivo tissue response was evaluated after cement implantation in the femoral medullary canal in canines. Tissue response and bonding at the cement-bone interface were evaluated at 2, 6, and 12 weeks. Cortical bone was found in direct contact with the OC-cement and was healthy. The strength of the cement-bone interface, measured using a push-out test, was significantly higher for the experimental cement than for commercial PMMA bone cement.\n\nN-acetyl cysteine (NAC)-mediated detoxification and functionalization of poly(methyl methacrylate) bone cement.\n\nPubMed\n\nTsukimura, Naoki; Yamada, Masahiro; Aita, Hideki; Hori, Norio; Yoshino, Fumihiko; Chang-Il Lee, Masaichi; Kimoto, Katsuhiko; Jewett, Anahid; Ogawa, Takahiro\n\n2009-07-01\n\nCurrently used poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA)-based bone cement lacks osteoconductivity and induces osteolysis and implant loosening due to its cellular and tissue-toxicity. A high percentage of revision surgery following the use of bone cement has become a significant universal problem. This study determined whether incorporation of the amino acid derivative N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) in bone cement reduces its cytotoxicity and adds osteoconductivity to the material. Biocompatibility and bioactivity of PMMA-based bone cement with or without 25mm NAC incorporation was examined using rat bone marrow-derived osteoblastic cells. Osteoconductive potential of NAC-incorporated bone cement was determined by microCT bone morphometry and implant biomechanical test in the rat model. Generation of free radicals within the polymerizing bone cement was examined using electron spin resonance spectroscopy. Severely compromised viability and completely suppressed phenotypes of osteoblasts on untreated bone cement were restored to the normal level by NAC incorporation. Bone volume formed around 25mm NAC-incorporated bone cement was threefold greater than that around control bone cement. The strength of bone-bone cement integration was 2.2 times greater for NAC-incorporated bone cement. For NAC-incorporated bone cement, the spike of free radical generation ended within 12h, whereas for control bone cement, a peak level lasted for 6 days and a level greater than half the level of the peak was sustained for 20 days. NAC also increased the level of antioxidant glutathione in osteoblasts. These results suggest that incorporation of NAC in PMMA bone cement detoxifies the material by immediate and effective in situ scavenging of free radicals and increasing intracellular antioxidant reserves, and consequently adds osteoconductivity to the material.\n\nA New Biphasic Dicalcium Silicate Bone Cement Implant.\n\nPubMed\n\nZuleta, Fausto; Murciano, Angel; Gehrke, Sergio A; MatÃ©-SÃ¡nchez de Val, JosÃ© E; Calvo-Guirado, JosÃ© L; De Aza, Piedad N\n\n2017-07-06\n\nThis study aimed to investigate the processing parameters and biocompatibility of a novel biphasic dicalcium silicate (CâS) cement. Biphasic Î±Â´ L + Î²-CâS ss was synthesized by solid-state processing, and was used as a raw material to prepare the cement. In vitro bioactivity and biocompatibility studies were assessed by soaking the cement samples in simulated body fluid (SBF) and human adipose stem cell cultures. Two critical-sized defects of 6 mm Ã were created in 15 NZ tibias. A porous cement made of the high temperature forms of CâS, with a low phosphorous substitution level, was produced. An apatite-like layer covered the cement's surface after soaking in SBF. The cell attachment test showed that Î±Â´ L + Î²-CâS ss supported cells sticking and spreading after 24 h of culture. The cement paste (55.86 Â± 0.23) obtained higher bone-to-implant contact (BIC) percentage values (better quality, closer contact) in the histomorphometric analysis, and defect closure was significant compared to the control group (plastic). The residual material volume of the porous cement was 35.42 Â± 2.08% of the initial value. The highest BIC and bone formation percentages were obtained on day 60. These results suggest that the cement paste is advantageous for initial bone regeneration.\n\nMixing of acrylic bone cement: effect of oxygen on setting properties.\n\nPubMed\n\nHe, Shulin; Scott, Christopher; Higham, Paul\n\n2003-12-01\n\nThe present study investigates the effect of different mixing methods on the setting properties of bone cement. It was found that vacuum mixing decreased the setting time of the bone cement by nearly 2 min (10%), compared to mixing in air. Two additional experiments, in which the bone cement powders were purged with argon or oxygen, and mixed with the methyl methacrylate monomer, revealed that oxygen concentrations in the bone cement had a great effect on the setting time. The setting time increases significantly as the oxygen concentration increases, which suggests that the decrease in the setting time by vacuum mixing may be attributed to the lower oxygen levels present in the mixer. No significant effect was observed on dough time or maximum exothermic temperature by varying oxygen concentrations in the bone cement mixer.\n\nIonic liquid as a potential solvent for preparation of collagen-alginate-hydroxyapatite beads as bone filler.\n\nPubMed\n\nIqbal, Bushra; Sarfaraz, Zenab; Muhammad, Nawshad; Ahmad, Pervaiz; Iqbal, Jibran; Khan, Zia Ul Haq; Gonfa, Girma; Iqbal, Farasat; Jamal, Arshad; Rahim, Abdur\n\n2018-07-01\n\nIn this study, collagen/alginate/hydroxyapatite beads having different proportions were prepared as bone fillers for the restoration of osteological defects. Ionic liquid was used to dissolve the collagen and subsequently the solution was mixed with sodium alginate solution. Hydroxyapatite was added in different proportions, with the rationale to enhance mechanical as well as biological properties. The prepared solutions were given characteristic bead shapes by dropwise addition into calcium chloride solution. The prepared beads were characterized using FTIR, XRD, TGA and SEM analysis. Microhardness testing was used to evaluate the mechanical properties. The prepared beads were investigated for water adsorption behavior to ascertain its ability for body fluid uptake and adjusted accordingly to the bone cavity. Drug loading and subsequently the antibacterial activity was investigated for the prepared beads. The biocompatibility was assessed using the hemolysis testing and cell proliferation assay. The prepared collagen-alginate-HA beads, having biocompatibility and good mechanical properties, have showed an option of promising biologically active bone fillers for bone regeneration.\n\nA New Biphasic Dicalcium Silicate Bone Cement Implant\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMurciano, Angel; MatÃ©-SÃ¡nchez de Val, JosÃ© E.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThis study aimed to investigate the processing parameters and biocompatibility of a novel biphasic dicalcium silicate (C2S) cement.

Testing was undertaken at both 25 and 37 degrees C using an oscillating parallel plate rheometer. Results showed that the three high viscosity cements exhibited distinct differences in curing rate, with CMW 1 curing in 8.7 min, Palacos R and Cemex ISOPLASTIC in 13 min at 25 degrees C. Furthermore it was found that these curing rates were strongly temperature dependent, with curing rates being halved at 37 degrees C. By monitoring the change of viscosity with time over the entire curing process, the results showed that these cements had differing viscosity profiles and hence exhibit very different handling characteristics. However, all the cements reached the same maximum viscosity of 75 x 10(3) Pa s. Also, the change in elastic/viscous moduli and tan delta with time, show the cements changing from a viscous material to an elastic solid with a clear peak in the viscous modulus during the latter stages of curing. These results give valuable information about the changes in rheological properties for each commercial bone cement, especially during the final curing process.\n\nCreep and fatigue behavior of a novel 2-component paste-like formulation of acrylic bone cements.\n\nPubMed\n\nKÃ¶ster, Ulrike; Jaeger, Raimund; Bardts, Mareike; Wahnes, Christian; BÃ¼chner, Hubert; KÃ¼hn, Klaus-Dieter; Vogt, Sebastian\n\n2013-06-01\n\nThe fatigue and creep performance of two novel acrylic bone cement formulations (one bone cement without antibiotics, one with antibiotics) was compared to the performance of clinically used bone cements (Osteopal V, Palacos R, Simplex P, SmartSet GHV, Palacos R+G and CMW1 with Gentamicin). The preparation of the novel bone cement formulations involves the mixing of two paste-like substances in a static mixer integrated into the cartridge which is used to apply the bone cement. The fatigue performance of the two novel bone cement formulations is comparable to the performance of the reference bone cements. The creep compliance of the bone cements is significantly influenced by the effects of physical ageing. The model parameters of Struik's creep law are used to compare the creep behavior of different bone cements. The novel 2-component paste-like bone cement formulations are in the group of bone cements which exhibit a higher creep resistance.\n\nInfluence of bone density on the cement fixation of femoral hip resurfacing components.\n\nPubMed\n\nBitsch, Rudi G; JÃ¤ger, Sebastian; LÃ¼rssen, Marcus; Loidolt, Travis; Schmalzried, Thomas P; Clarius, Michael\n\n2010-08-01\n\nIn clinical outcome studies, small component sizes, female gender, femoral shape, focal bone defects, bad bone quality, and biomechanics have been associated with failures of resurfacing arthroplasties. We used a well-established experimental setup and human bone specimens to analyze the effects of bone density on cement fixation of femoral hip resurfacing components. Thirty-one fresh frozen femora were prepared for resurfacing using the original instruments. ASR resurfacing prostheses were implanted after dual-energy X-ray densitometer scans. Real-time measurements of pressure and temperature during implantation, analyses of cement penetration, and measurements of micro motions under torque application were performed. The associations of bone density and measurement data were examined calculating regression lines and multiple correlation coefficients; acceptability was tested with ANOVA. We found significant relations between bone density and micro motion, cement penetration, cement mantle thickness, cement pressure, and interface temperature. Mean bone density of the femora was 0.82 +/- 0.13 g/cm(2), t-score was -0.7 +/- 1.0, and mean micro motion between bone and femoral resurfacing component was 17.5 +/- 9.1 microm/Nm. The regression line between bone density and micro motion was equal to -56.7 x bone density + 63.8, R = 0.815 (p < 0.001). Bone density scans are most helpful for patient selection in hip resurfacing, and a better bone quality leads to higher initial component stability. A sophisticated cementing technique is recommended to avoid vigorous impaction and incomplete seating, since increasing bone density also results in higher cement pressures, lower cement penetration, lower interface temperatures, and thicker cement mantles.

It is motivated by the significances of DCPA and silicon in bone physiological activities. More specifically, this paper examined the effects of various experimental parameters on the properties of such composite cements. In this work, DCPA cement powders were synthesized using a microwave synthesis technique. Mixing colloidal nanosilica directly with synthesized DCPA cement powders can significantly reduce the washout resistance of DCPA cement. In contrast, a DCPA-nanosilica cement powder prepared by reacting Ca(OH)2 , H3 PO4 and nanosilica together showed good washout resistance. The incorporation of nanosilica in DCPA can improve compressive strength, accelerate cement solidification, and intensify surface bioactivity. In addition, it was observed that by controlling the content of NaHCO3 during cement preparation, the resulting composite cement properties could be modified. Allowing for the development of different setting times, mechanical performance and crystal features. It is suggested that DCPA-nanosilica composite cement can be a potential candidate for bone healing applications.

The MC-PMMA was embedded into rabbits and co-cultured with MG 63 cells to exam bone tissue compatibility and gene expression of osteogenesis. Results 15.0%(wt) impregnated MC-PMMA significantly lowered compressive modulus while little affected compressive strength and solidification. MC-PMMA bone cement was biologically safe and indicated excellent bone tissue compatibility.

The genes of osteogenesis exhibited significantly higher expression level in MC-PMMA. Conclusions MC-PMMA presented perfect mechanical properties, good biosafety and excellent biocompatibility with bone tissues, which has profoundly clinical values.

The monomers include bis-phenol A glycidyl dimethacrylate (bis-GMA), urethane dimethacrylate (UDMA) and triethylene glycol dimethacrylate (TEGDMA) as a viscosity modifier. Two-paste systems were formulated containing 60% by weight of a bioactive ceramic, hydroxyapatite. A methacroyloxy silane (A174) was used as a coupling agent due to its higher water stability in comparison to other aminosilanes to silanate the hydroxyapatite particles prior to composite formulation. A comparison of the FT-infrared spectrum of hydroxyapatite and silanated hydroxyapatite showed the presence of the carbonyl groups ( approximately 1720 cm(-1)), -C=C-( approximately 1630 cm(-1)) and Si-O- (1300-1250 cm(-1)) which indicated the availability of silane groups on the filler surface. Two methods of mixing were effected to form the bone cement: firstly by mixing in an open bowl and secondly by extruding the two pastes by an auto-mixing tip using a gun to dispense the pastes. Both types of cements yielded low polymerization exotherms with good mechanical properties; however, the lower viscosity of UDMA allowed better extrusion and handling properties. A biologically active apatite layer formed on the bone cement surface within a short period after its immersion in simulated body fluid, demonstrating in vitro bioactivity of the composite. This preliminary data thus suggests that UDMA is a viable alternative to bis-GMA as a polymerizable matrix in the formation of bone cements.\n\nPolymethylmethacrylate bone cements and additives: A review of the literature\n\nPubMed Central\n\nArora, Manit; Chan, Edward KS; Gupta, Sunil; Diwan, Ashish D\n\n2013-01-01\n\nPolymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) bone cement technology has progressed from industrial Plexiglass administration in the 1950s to the recent advent of nanoparticle additives. Additives have been trialed to address problems with modern bone cements such as the loosening of prosthesis, high post-operative infection rates, and inflammatory reduction in interface integrity. This review aims to assess current additives used in PMMA bone cements and offer an insight regarding future directions for this biomaterial. Low index (< 15%) vitamin E and low index (< 5 g) antibiotic impregnated additives significantly address infection and inflammatory problems, with only modest reductions in mechanical strength. Chitosan (15% w/w PMMA) and silver (1% w/w PMMA) nanoparticles have strong antibacterial activity with no significant reduction in mechanical strength. Future work on PMMA bone cements should focus on trialing combinations of these additives as this may enhance favourable properties.

Here, we investigated the degradation and bone regeneration capacity of experimental struvite (MgNH 4 PO 4 Â·6H 2 O) forming magnesium phosphate cements in two different orthotopic ovine implantation models. Cements formed at powder to liquid ratios (PLR) of 2.0 and 3.0â¯gâ¯ml -1 were implanted into trabecular bone using a non-load-bearing femoral drill-hole model and a load-bearing tibial defect model. After 4, 7 and 10â¯months the implants were retrieved and cement degradation and new bone formation was analyzed by micro-computed tomography (ÂµCT) and histomorphometry. The results showed cement degradation in concert with new bone formation at both defect locations. Both cements were almost completely degraded after 10â¯months. The struvite cement formed with a PLR of 2.0â¯gâ¯ml -1 exhibited a slightly accelerated degradation kinetics compared to the cement with a PLR of 3.0â¯gâ¯ml -1 . Tartrat-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining indicated osteoclastic resorption at the cement surface. Energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) revealed that small residual cement particles were mostly accumulated in the bone marrow in between newly formed bone trabeculae. Mechanical loading did not significantly increase bone formation associated with cement degradation. Concluding, struvite-forming cements might be promising bone replacement materials due to their good degradation which is coupled with new bone formation. Recently, the interest in magnesium phosphate cements (MPC) for bone substitution increased, as they exhibit high initial strength, comparably elevated degradation potential and the release of valuable magnesium ions. However, only few in vivo studies, mostly including non-load-bearing defects in small animals, have been performed to analyze the degradation and regeneration capability of MPC\n\nBone density and anisotropy affect periprosthetic cement and bone stresses after anatomical glenoid replacement: A micro finite element analysis.\n\nPubMed\n\nChevalier, Yan; Santos, InÃªs; MÃ¼ller, Peter E; Pietschmann, Matthias F\n\n2016-06-14\n\nGlenoid loosening is still a main complication for shoulder arthroplasty. We hypothesize that cement and bone stresses potentially leading to fixation failure are related not only to glenohumeral conformity, fixation design or eccentric loading, but also to bone volume fraction, cortical thickness and degree of anisotropy in the glenoid. In this study, periprosthetic bone and cement stresses were computed with micro finite element models of the replaced glenoid depicting realistic bone microstructure. These models were used to quantify potential effects of bone microstructural parameters under loading conditions simulating different levels of glenohumeral conformity and eccentric loading simulating glenohumeral instability. Results show that peak cement stresses were achieved near the cement-bone interface in all loading schemes. Higher stresses within trabecular bone tissue and cement mantle were obtained within specimens of lower bone volume fraction and in regions of low anisotropy, increasing with decreasing glenohumeral conformity and reaching their maxima below the keeled design when the load is shifted superiorly. Our analyses confirm the combined influences of eccentric load shifts with reduced bone volume fraction and anisotropy on increasing periprosthetic stresses. They finally suggest that improving fixation of glenoid replacements must reduce internal cement and bone tissue stresses, in particular in glenoids of low bone density and heterogeneity.

These cements typically have an abundance of beneficial qualities, however their lack of bioactivity allows for continued development. To enhance osseointegration and bioactivity, calcium phosphate cements prepared with hydroxyapatite, brushite or tricalcium phosphates have been introduced with rather unsuccessful results due to increased cement viscosity, poor handling and reduced mechanical performance. This has limited the use of such cements in applications requiring delivery through small cannulas and in load bearing. The goal of this study is to design an alternative cement system that can better accommodate calcium-phosphate additives while preserving cement rheological properties and performance. In the present work, a number of brushite-filled two-solution bone cements were prepared and characterized by studying their complex viscosity-versus-test frequency, extrusion stress, clumping tendency during injection through a syringe, extent of fill of a machined void in cortical bone analog specimens, and compressive strength. The addition of brushite into the two-solution cement formulations investigated did not affect the pseudoplastic behavior and handling properties of the materials as demonstrated by rheological experiments. Extrusion stress was observed to vary with brushite concentration with values lower or in the range of control PMMA-based cements. The materials were observed to completely fill pre-formed voids in bone analog specimens. Cement compressive strength was observed to decrease with increasing concentration of fillers; however, the materials exhibited high enough strength for consideration in load bearing applications. The results indicated that partially substituting the PMMA phase of the two-solution cement with brushite at a 40% by mass concentration provided the best combination of the\n\nBone preserving techniques for explanting the well-fixed cemented acetabular component.\n\nPubMed\n\nStevens, Jarrad; Macpherson, Gavin; Howie, Colin\n\n2018-06-01\n\nRemoval of a well-fixed, cemented acetabular component at the time of revision hip surgery can be complex. It is essential to remove the implant and cement mantle in a timely fashion while preserving bone stock and osseous integrity. The biomechanical properties of polymethylmethacrylate cement and polyethylene can be utilised to aid with the removal of well cemented implants which are often harder than the surrounding bone. While removal of loose components may be relatively straightforward, the challenge for the revision arthroplasty surgeon often involves the removal of well-fixed implants. Here, we present three established techniques for the removal of a well-fixed cemented acetabular component and one novel modification we have described before. We collate and review four techniques for removing well-fixed cemented acetabular implants that utilise the different biomechanical properties of bone cement and polyethylene. These techniques are illustrated with a photographic series utilising saw bones. A step-by-step approach to our new technique is shown in photographs, both in the clinical setting and with a \"Sawbone\". This is accompanied by a clinical video that details the surgical technique in its entirety. These techniques utilise different biomechanical principles to extract the acetabular component. Each technique has advantages and disadvantages. Our new technique is a simplification of a previously published extraction manoeuvre that utilises tensile force between cement and the implant to remove the polyethylene cup. This is a safe and reproducible technique in patients with a well-fixed cemented acetabular implant. Understanding the biomechanical properties of polymethylmethacrylate bone cement and polyethylene can aid in the safe removal of a well-fixed cemented acetabular component in revision hip surgery. The optimal technique for removal of a cemented acetabular component varies depending on a number of patient and implant factors. This summary of\n\nMicro-mechanical damage of trabecular bone-cement interface under selected loading conditions: a finite element study.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhang, Qing-Hang; Tozzi, Gianluca; Tong, Jie\n\n2014-01-01\n\nIn this study, two micro finite element models of trabecular bone-cement interface developed from high resolution computed tomography (CT) images were loaded under compression and validated using the in situ experimental data. The models were then used under tension and shear to examine the load transfer between the bone and cement and the micro damage development at the bone-cement interface. In addition, one models was further modified to investigate the effect of cement penetration on the bone-cement interfacial behaviour. The simulated results show that the load transfer at the bone-cement interface occurred mainly in the bone cement partially interdigitated region, while the fully interdigitated region seemed to contribute little to the mechanical response. Consequently, cement penetration beyond a certain value would seem to be ineffective in improving the mechanical strength of trabecular bone-cement interface. Under tension and shear loading conditions, more cement failures were found in denser bones, while the cement damage is generally low under compression.\n\nIn vivo response of bioactive PMMA-based bone cement modified with alkoxysilane and calcium acetate.\n\nPubMed\n\nSugino, Atsushi; Ohtsuki, Chikara; Miyazaki, Toshiki\n\n2008-11-01\n\nThe use of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA)-based bone cement is popular in orthopedics for the fixation of artificial joints with bone. However, it has a major problem with prostheses loosening because of coverage by fibrous tissue after long-term implantation. Recently, a bioactive bone cement has been developed that shows direct bonding to living bone through modification of PMMA resin with gamma-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane (MPS) and calcium acetate. The cement is designed to exhibit bioactivity, through incorporation of silanol groups and calcium ions. Thus, it has the potential to form a layer of bone-like hydroxyapatite, which is essential for achieving direct bonding to living bone. This type of modification allows the cement to show spontaneous hydroxyapatite formation on its surface in a simulated body fluid after one day, and there is evidence of osteoconduction of the cement in rabbit tibia for periods of more than three weeks. However, the influence of the dissolved ions from the modified cement has not yet been clarified. Thus, the authors focused on the dissolution of the modified PMMA-based bone cement and its tissue response in muscle and bone by comparison with the behavior of non-modified PMMA-based bone cement. One week after implantation in the latissimus dorsi of a rabbit, the modified PMMA-based bone cement showed more inflammatory width than the commercial cement. However, four weeks after implantation, the inflammatory width of both cements was essentially the same. The osteoconductivity around the modified cement was higher than that for the conventional cement after four weeks implantation. These results indicate that the initial dissolution of calcium acetate from the modified cement to form the hydroxyapatite induced the acute inflammation around tissue, but also developed the osteoconductivity. It is suggested that the initial inflammation can be effective for inducing osteoconduction through a bone healing reaction when the\n\n[Experiment of porous calcium phosphate/bone matrix gelatin composite cement for repairing lumbar vertebral bone defect in rabbit].\n\nPubMed\n\nWang, Song; Yang, Han; Yang, Jian; Kang, Jianping; Wang, Qing; Song, Yueming\n\n2017-12-01\n\nTo investigate the effect of a porous calcium phosphate/bone matrix gelatin (BMG) composite cement (hereinafter referred to as the \"porous composite cement\") for repairing lumbar vertebral bone defect in a rabbit model. BMG was extracted from adult New Zealand rabbits according to the Urist's method. Poly (lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA) microsphere was prepared by W/O/W double emulsion method. The porous composite cement was developed by using calcium phosphate cement (CPC) composited with BMG and PLGA microsphere. The physicochemical characterizations of the porous composite cement were assessed by anti-washout property, porosity, and biomechanical experiment, also compared with the CPC. Thirty 2-month-old New Zealand rabbits were used to construct vertebral bone defect at L 3 in size of 4 mmÃ3 mmÃ3 mm. Then, the bone defect was repaired with porous composite cement (experimental group, n =15) or CPC (control group, n =15). At 4, 8, and 12 weeks after implantation, each bone specimen was assessed by X-ray films for bone fusion, micro-CT for bone mineral density (BMD), bone volume fraction (BVF), trabecular thickness (Tb. Th.), trabecular number (Tb.N.), and trabecular spacing (Tb. Sp.), and histological section with toluidine blue staining for new-born bone formation. The study demonstrated well anti-washout property in 2 groups. The porous composite cement has 55.06%Â±1.18% of porosity and (51.63Â±6.73) MPa of compressive strength. The CPC has 49.38%Â±1.75% of porosity and (63.34Â±3.27) MPa of compressive strength. There were significant differences in porosity and compressive strength between different cements ( t =4.254, P =0.006; t =2.476, P =0.034). X-ray films revealed that the zone between the cement and host bone gradually blurred with the time extending.

Material/Methods CPC and PMMA were mixed in different ratios (3: 1, 2: 1, 1: 1, 1: 2, 1: 5, 1: 10, 1: 15, and 1: 20). PMMA solvent is a general solvent containing a dissolved preparation of the composite bone cement specific to a given specimen to determine biological safety, biomechanics, and tissue compatibility. Results The CPC/PMMA (33%) group, CPC/PMMA (50%) group, CPC/PMMA (67%) group, and CPC/PMMA (75%) group were more in line with the composite bone cement without cytotoxicity requirements. The compressive strength of the CPC/PMMA (67%) group and CPC/PMMA (75%) group was 20Mpaâ30Mpa, while that of the CPC/PMMA (4.8%) group, CPC/PMMA (6.25%) group, CPC/PMMA (9.1%) group, CPC/PMMA (16.7%) group, CPC/PMMA (33%) group, and CPC/PMMA (50%) group was 40Mpaâ70Mpa. Curing time was longer in the CPC group (more than 11 min) and shorter in the PMMA group (less than 2 min). The results of weight loss rate showed that there were no significant differences between the CPC/PMMA group (4.8%, 6.25%, 9.1%, 16.7%, 33%) and PMMA control group (p>0.05). With the decrease of CPC content, the rate of weight loss gradually decreased. Conclusions The CPC/PMMA (50%) group, CPC/PMMA (67%) group, and CPC/PMMA (75%) group provide greater variability and selectivity for the composite bone cement in obtaining better application.

Component loosening is a significant problem and is primarily caused by bone resorption at the bone-cement interface in cemented implants. It is our hypothesis that localized shear stresses are responsible for the resorption. It was previously shown analytically that local stresses at the interface could be reduced by using a cement of lower modulus. A new reduced modulus cement, polybutyl methylmethacrylate (PBMMA), was developed to test the hypothesis. PBMMA was formulated to exist as polybutyl methacrylate filler in a polymethyl methacrylate matrix. The success of PBMMA cement is based largely on the fact that the polybutyl component of the cement will be in the rubbery state at body temperature. In vitro characterization of the cement was undertaken previously and demonstrated a modulus of approximately one-eighth that of conventional bone cement, polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) and increased fracture toughness. The purpose of this experiment was to perform an in vivo comparison of the two cements. A sheep model was selected. Total hip arthroplasty was performed on 50 ewes using either PBMMA or PMMA. Radiographs were taken at 6 month intervals. At one year, the contralateral femur of each sheep was implanted so that each animal served as its own control, and the animals were sacrificed. The stiffness of the bone-cement interface of the femoral component within the femur was assessed by applying a torque to the femoral component and demonstrated a significant difference in loosening between the cements when the specimens were tested in external rotation (p < 0.007). Evaluation of the mechanical data also suggests that the PBMMA sheep had a greater amount of loosening for each subject, 59% versus 4% for standard PMMA. A radiographic analysis demonstrated more signs of loosening in the PMMA series\n\n[The injection of acrylic bone cement prevents bone collapse in the intercalar bones lacking bony support: an experimental sheep semilunar bone model].\n\nPubMed\n\nUnsal, Murat; Tetik, Cihangir; Erol, BÃ¼lent; CabukoÄlu, Cengiz\n\n2003-01-01\n\nIn a sheep semilunar bone model, we investigated whether collapse in the intercalar bones lacking bony support could be prevented by the injection of acrylic bone cement. The study included 16 limbs of eight sheep. Preoperatively, anteroposterior and lateral views of the carpal joints in the fore limbs were obtained. The animals were divided into four groups. In group 1 (n=3) no surgical procedure was performed in the right semilunar bones, whereas the periosteum on the contralateral side was elevated (group 2; n=3). The first two groups were left as controls. In Group 3 (n=5) the left semilunar bones were filled with acrylic bone cement following decancellation of the bone, while the right semilunar bones were left decancellated (group 4; n=5). The sheep were monitored for three months. Radiographs of the carpal joints were obtained to evaluate collapse occurrence in the semilunar bones. Thereafter, the animals were sacrificed and the semilunar bones were excised for biomechanical and histological examinations. Osteonecrosis and cartilage damage were sought and resistance to compressive forces was investigated. Radiologically, the extent of collapse was statistically significant in the semilunar bones in group 4 (p<0.05). The use of acrylic bone cement was found to prevent collapse in group 3, with no significant difference being noted between preoperative and postoperative semilunar bone heights (p>0.05). Biomechanically, the least resistance to compressive forces was measured in group 4 (p<0.05). Histologically, cartilage damage and osteonecrosis were only seen in group 4. Our data suggest that the use of acrylic bone cement prevents collapse in the semilunar bones, without inducing any cartilage damage or osteonecrosis.\n\nMethod of adhering bone to a rigid substrate using a graphite fiber reinforced bone cement\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nKnoell, A. C.; Maxwell, H. G. (Inventor)\n\n1977-01-01\n\nA method is described for adhering bone to the surface of a rigid substrate such as a metal or resin prosthesis using an improved surgical bone cement. The bone cement has mechanical properties more nearly matched to those of animal bone and thermal curing characteristics which result in less traumatization of body tissues and comprises a dispersion of short high modulus graphite fibers within a bonder composition including polymer dissolved in reactive monomer such as polymethylmethacrylate dissolved in methylmethacrylate monomer.\n\nThe effect of N-acetylcysteine on mechanical fatigue resistance of antibiotic-loaded bone cement.\n\nPubMed\n\nSukur, Erhan; Akar, Abdulhalim; Topcu, Huseyin Nevzat; Cicekli, Ozgur; Kochai, Alauddin; Turker, Mehmet\n\n2018-05-31\n\nThis biomechanical study evaluates the effect of N-acetylcysteine alone and in combination with the most commonly used antibiotic-loaded bone cement mixtures. We mixed eight bone cement mixture groups including combinations of N-acetylcysteine, gentamicin, teicoplanin, and vancomycin and applied a four-point bending test individually to each sample on days 1 and 15 using an MTS Acumen test device. The result was less than 50Â MPa-the limit declared by the ISO (International Standards Organization)-in only the \"gentamicin + bone cement + N-acetylcysteine\" group. Mechanical fatigue resistance of the bone cement decreased significantly with the addition of N-acetylcysteine both on day 1 and day 15 (pâ<âÂ 0.001). With the addition of N-acetylcysteine into the \"gentamicin + bone cement\" and \"vancomycin + bone cement\" mixtures, a significant decrease in mechanical fatigue resistance was observed both on day 1 and day 15 (pâ<âÂ 0.001). In contrast, with the addition of N-acetylcysteine into the \"teicoplanin + bone cement\" mixture, no significant difference in mechanical fatigue resistance was observed on days 1 and 15 (pâ=â0.093, pâ=â0.356). Preliminary results indicate that adding N-acetylcysteine to teicoplanin-loaded bone cement does not significantly affect the cement's mechanical resistance, potentially leading to a new avenue for preventing and treating peri-prosthetic joint infection. N-acetylcysteine may, therefore, be considered as an alternative agent to be added to antibiotic-loaded bone cement mixtures used in the prevention of peri-prosthetic joint infection.\n\nDoes bone cement in percutaneous vertebroplasty act as a stress riser?\n\nPubMed\n\nAquarius, RenÃ©; van der Zijden, Astrid Maria; Homminga, Jasper; Verdonschot, Nico; Tanck, Esther\n\n2013-11-15\n\nAn in vitro cadaveric study. To determine whether percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) with a clinically relevant amount of bone cement is capable of causing stress peaks in adjacent-level vertebrae. It is often suggested that PVP of a primary spinal fracture causes stress peaks in adjacent vertebrae, thereby leading to additional fractures. The in vitro studies that demonstrated this relationship, however, use bigger volumes of bone cement used clinically. Ten fresh-frozen vertebrae were loaded until failure, while registering force and displacement as well as the pressure under the lower endplate. After failure, the vertebrae were augmented with clinically relevant amounts of bone cement and then again loaded until failure. The force, displacement, and pressure under the lower endplate were again registered. Stress peaks were not related to the location of the injected bone cement. Both failure load and stiffness were significantly lower after augmentation. On the basis of our findings, we conclude that vertebral augmentation with clinically relevant amounts of bone cement does not lead to stress peaks under the endplate. It is therefore unlikely that PVP, in itself, causes detrimental stresses in the adjacent vertebrae, leading to new vertebral fractures.

Some implants had a titanium-bead porous coat at the proximal end. These were of three types: In the first type, the porous coat was covered with hydroxyapatite to obtain a bony seal; the second type was prepared for a polymethylmethacrylate seal; in the third type, the porous zone was surrounded by a 2-mm-thick space to allow the formation of a fibrous seal. Small polyethylene particles were injected into the knees once a week during the third and fourth months after implantation. The animals were euthanized 2 months later. Major longitudinal sections of the implants and the surrounding bone were examined under a polarized light microscope. Birefringent particles were counted at the cement-bone and cement-implant interfaces. Osteolysis was not observed. None of the seals significantly decreased the migration of particles around the cemented part of the implants. Particles were observed in cement fissures and vacuoles. They migrated at both interfaces and in the bone itself. They were visible in marrow spaces between bone trabeculae. Copyright 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

It involves augmenting mechanical properties of the femur by injecting Polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) bone cement. To reduce the risks involved and maximize the outcome, however, the procedure needs to be carefully planned and executed. An important part of the planning system is predicting infiltration of cement into the porous medium of cancellous bone. We used the method of Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) to model the flow of PMMA inside porous media. We modified the standard formulation of SPH to incorporate the extreme viscosities associated with bone cement. Darcy creeping flow of fluids through isotropic porous media was simulated and the results were compared with those reported in the literature. Further validation involved injecting PMMA cement inside porous foam blocks - osteoporotic cancellous bone surrogates - and simulating the injections using our proposed SPH model. Millimeter accuracy was obtained in comparing the simulated and actual cement shapes. Also, strong correlations were found between the simulated and the experimental data of spreading distance (R(2)â=â0.86) and normalized pressure (R(2)â=â0.90). Results suggest that the proposed model is suitable for use in an osteoporotic femoral augmentation planning framework.\n\nOptimisation of a two-liquid component pre-filled acrylic bone cement system: a design of experiments approach to optimise cement final properties.\n\nPubMed\n\nClements, James; Walker, Gavin; Pentlavalli, Sreekanth; Dunne, Nicholas\n\n2014-10-01\n\nThe initial composition of acrylic bone cement along with the mixing and delivery technique used can influence its final properties and therefore its clinical success in vivo. The polymerisation of acrylic bone cement is complex with a number of processes happening simultaneously. Acrylic bone cement mixing and delivery systems have undergone several design changes in their advancement, although the cement constituents themselves have remained unchanged since they were first used. This study was conducted to determine the factors that had the greatest effect on the final properties of acrylic bone cement using a pre-filled bone cement mixing and delivery system. A design of experiments (DoE) approach was used to determine the impact of the factors associated with this mixing and delivery method on the final properties of the cement produced. The DoE illustrated that all factors present within this study had a significant impact on the final properties of the cement. An optimum cement composition was hypothesised and tested. This optimum recipe produced cement with final mechanical and thermal properties within the clinical guidelines and stated by ISO 5833 (International Standard Organisation (ISO), International standard 5833: implants for surgery-acrylic resin cements, 2002), however the low setting times observed would not be clinically viable and could result in complications during the surgical technique. As a result further development would be required to improve the setting time of the cement in order for it to be deemed suitable for use in total joint replacement surgery.\n\nStrain-controlled fatigue of acrylic bone cement.\n\nPubMed\n\nCarter, D R; Gates, E I; Harris, W H\n\n1982-09-01\n\nMonotonic tensile tests and tension-compression fatigue tests were conducted of wet acrylic bone cement specimens at 37 degrees C. All testing was conducted in strain control at a strain rate of 0.02/s. Weibull analysis of the tensile tests indicated that monotonic fracture was governed more strongly by strain than stress. The number of cycles to fatigue failure was also more strongly controlled by strain amplitude than stress amplitude. Specimen porosity distribution played a major role in determining the tensile and fatigue strengths. The degree of data scatter suggests that Weibull analysis of fatigue data may be useful in developing design criteria for the surgical use of bone cement.\n\nProton Range Uncertainty Due to Bone Cement Injected Into the Vertebra in Radiation Therapy Planning\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nLim, Young Kyung; Hwang, Ui-Jung; Shin, Dongho, E-mail: dongho@ncc.re.kr\n\n2011-10-01\n\nWe wanted to evaluate the influence of bone cement on the proton range and to derive a conversion factor predicting the range shift by correcting distorted computed tomography (CT) data as a reference to determine whether the correction is needed. Two CT datasets were obtained with and without a bone cement disk placed in a water phantom. Treatment planning was performed on a set of uncorrected CT images with the bone cement disk, and the verification plan was applied to the same set of CT images with an effective CT number for the bone cement disk. The effective CT numbermoreÂ Â» was determined by measuring the actual proton range with the bone cement disk. The effects of CT number, thicknesses, and position of bone cement on the proton range were evaluated in the treatment planning system (TPS) to draw a conversion factor predicting the range shift by correcting the CT number of bone cement. The effective CT number of bone cement was 260 Hounsfield units (HU). The calculated proton range for native CT data was significantly shorter than the measured proton range. However, the calculated range for the corrected CT data with the effective CT number coincided exactly with the measured range. The conversion factor was 209.6 [HU . cm/mm] for bone cement and predicted the range shift by approximately correcting the CT number. We found that the heterogeneity of bone cement could cause incorrect proton ranges in treatment plans using CT images. With an effective CT number of bone cement derived from the proton range and relative stopping power, a more actual proton range could be calculated in the TPS. The conversion factor could predict the necessity for CT data correction with sufficient accuracy.Â«Â less\n\nThe Biomechanical Properties of Pedicle Screw Fixation Combined With Trajectory Bone Cement Augmentation in Osteoporotic Vertebrae.\n\nPubMed\n\nFan, Haitao T; Zhang, Renjie J; Shen, Cailiang L; Dong, Fulong L; Li, Yong; Song, Peiwen W; Gong, Chen; Wang, Yijin J\n\n2016-03-01\n\nThe biomechanics of pedicle screw fixation combined with trajectory cement augmentation with various filling volumes were measured by pull-out, periodic antibending, and compression fatigue tests. To investigate the biomechanical properties of the pedicle screw fixation combined with trajectory bone cement (polymethylmethacrylate) augmentation in osteoporotic vertebrae and to explore the optimum filling volume of the bone cement. Pedicle screw fixation is considered to be the most effective posterior fixation method. The decrease of the bone mineral density apparently increases the fixation failure risk caused by screw loosening and displacement. Trajectory bone cement augmentation has been confirmed to be an effective method to increase the bone intensity and could markedly increase the stability of the fixation interface. Sixteen elderly cadaveric 1-5 lumbar vertebral specimens were diagnosed with osteoporosis. The left and right vertebral pedicles were alternatively randomized for treatment in all groups, with the contralateral pedicles as control. The study groups included: group A (pedicle screw fixation with full trajectory bone cement augmentation), group B (75% filling), group C (50% filling), and group D (25% filling). Finally, the bone cement leakage and dispersion were assessed and the mechanical testing was conducted. The bone cement was well dispersed around the pedicle screw. The augmented bone intensity, pull-out strength, periodic loading times, and compression fatigue performance were markedly higher than those of the control groups. With the increase in trajectory bone cement, the leakage was also increased (P<0.05). The pull-out strength of the pedicle screw was increased with an increase in bone mineral density and trajectory bone cement. It peaked at 75% filling, with the largest power consumption. The optimal filling volume of the bone cement was 75% of the trajectory volume (about 1.03 mL). The use of excessive bone cement did not increase\n\nEvaluation of four biodegradable, injectable bone cements in an experimental drill hole model in sheep.\n\nPubMed\n\nvon Rechenberg, Brigitte; GÃ©not, Oliver R; Nuss, Katja; Galuppo, Larry; Fulmer, Mark; Jacobson, Evan; Kronen, Peter; Zlinszky, Kati; Auer, JÃ¶rg A\n\n2013-09-01\n\nFour cement applications were tested in this investigation. Two dicalcium phosphate dihydrate (DCPD-brushite) hydraulic cements, an apatite hydraulic fiber loaded cement, and a calcium sulfate cement (Plaster of Paris) were implanted in epiphyseal and metaphyseal cylindrical bone defects in sheep. The in vivo study was performed to assess the biocompatibility and bone remodeling of four cement formulations. After time periods of 2, 4, and 6 months, the cement samples were clinically and histologically evaluated. Histomorphometrically, the amount of new bone formation, fibrous tissue, and bone marrow and the area of remaining cement were measured. In all specimens, no signs of inflammation were detectable either macroscopically or microscopically. Cements differed mainly in their resorption time. Calcium sulfate was already completely resorbed at 2 months and showed a variable amount of new bone formation and/or fibrous tissue in the original drill hole over all time periods. The two DCPD cements in contrast were degraded to a large amount at 6 months, whereas the apatite was almost unchanged over all time periods. Copyright Â© 2013.

Utilizing high resolution finite element analysis of a series of implanted cadaver glenoids, the objective of this study was to quantify relationships between construct morphology and resulting mechanical stresses in cement and trabeculae. Eight glenoid cadavers were implanted with a cemented central peg implant. Specimens were imaged by micro-CT, and subject-specific finite element models were developed. Bone volume fraction, glenoid width, implant-cortex distance, cement volume, cement-cortex contact, and cement-bone interface area were measured. Axial loading was applied to the implant of each model and stress distributions were characterized. Correlation analysis was completed across all specimens for pairs of morphological and mechanical variables. The amount of trabecular bone with high stress was strongly negatively correlated with both cement volume and contact between the cement and cortex (r =â-0.85 and -0.84, p < 0.05). Bone with high stress was also correlated with both glenoid width and implant-cortex distance. Contact between the cement and underlying cortex may dramatically reduce trabecular bone stresses surrounding the cement, and this contact depends on bone shape, cement amount, and implant positioning.

This study aimed to improve their bioactivity and osseointegration by incorporating strontium-containing borate bioactive glass (SrBG) as the reinforcement phase and bioactive filler of PMMA cement. The prepared SrBG/PMMA composite cements showed significantly decreased polymerization temperature when compared with PMMA and retained properties of appropriate setting time and high mechanical strength. The bioactivity of SrBG/PMMA composite cements was confirmed in vitro, evidenced by ion release (Ca, P, B and Sr) from SrBG particles. The cellular responses of MC3T3-E1 cells in vitro demonstrated that SrBG incorporation could promote adhesion, migration, proliferation and collagen secretion of cells. Furthermore, our in vivo investigation revealed that SrBG/PMMA composite cements presented better osseointegration than PMMA bone cement. SrBG in the composite cement could stimulate new-bone formation around the interface between the composite cement and host bone at eight and 12 weeks post-implantation, whereas PMMA bone cement only stimulated development of an intervening connective tissue layer. Consequently, the SrBG/PMMA composite cement may be a better alternative to PMMA cement in clinical applications and has promising orthopaedic applications by minimal invasive surgery.

M.; Rahman, M. M.; Singh, R.\n\n2017-06-01\n\nCalcium phosphate cement has been prepared via chemical precipitation method for injectable bone filling materials. Calcium hydroxide, Ca(OH)2, and diammonium hydrogen phosphate, (NH4)2HPO4, were used as calcium and phosphorus precursors respectively. The synthesized powder was mixed with water at different powder-to-liquid (P/L) ratios, which was adjusted at 0.8, 0.9, 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2. The influence of P/L ratio on the injectability, setting time and mechanical strength of calcium phosphate cement paste has been evaluated. The synthesized powder appeared as purely hydroxyapatite with nanosized and agglomerated spherical particles. All cement pastes show excellent injectability except for the paste with P/L ratio 1.2. Calcium phosphate cement with P/L ratio 1.1 shows the ideal cement for bone filler application with good injectability, the initial and final setting times of 30 min and 160 min, and the compression strength of 2.47 MPa. The result indicated that the newly developed calcium phosphate cement is physically suitable for bone filler application. This paper presents our investigation on the effect of P/L ratio on the handling and mechanical properties of calcium phosphate cement prepared via wet chemical precipitation method.\n\nThe long-term in vivo behavior of polymethyl methacrylate bone cement in total hip arthroplasty.\n\nPubMed\n\nOonishi, Hiroyuki; Akiyama, Haruhiko; Takemoto, Mitsuru; Kawai, Toshiyuki; Yamamoto, Koji; Yamamuro, Takao; Oonishi, Hironobu; Nakamura, Takashi\n\n2011-10-01\n\nThe long-term success of cemented total hip arthroplasty (THA) has been well established. Improved outcomes, both radiographically and clinically, have resulted mainly from advances in stem design and improvements in operating techniques. However, there is concern about the durability of bone cement in vivo. We evaluated the physical and chemical properties of CMW1 bone cements retrieved from patients undergoing revision THA. CMW1 cements were retrieved from 14 patients who underwent acetabular revision because of aseptic loosening. The time in vivo before revision was 7-30 years. The bending properties of the retrieved bone cement were assessed using the three-point bending method. The molecular weight and chemical structure were analyzed by gel permeation chromatography and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. The porosity of the bone cements was evaluated by 3-D microcomputer tomography. The bending strength decreased with increasing time in vivo and depended on the density of the bone cement, which we assume to be determined by the porosity. There was no correlation between molecular weight and time in vivo. The infrared spectra were similar in the retrieved cements and in the control CMW1 cements. Our results indicate that polymer chain scission and significant hydrolysis do not occur in CMW1 cement after implantation in vivo, even in the long term. CMW1 cement was stable through long-term implantation and functional loading.\n\nThe long-term in vivo behavior of polymethyl methacrylate bone cement in total hip arthroplasty\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2011-01-01\n\nBackground and purpose The long-term success of cemented total hip arthroplasty (THA) has been well established.

H.; Saidin, S.\n\n2017-05-01\n\nAn injectable calcium phosphate (CaP) bone cement has been widely used for musculoskeletal and bone disorder due to its biocompatible and osteoconductive properties. In this study, CaP was successfully synthesized from crab shells by a wet chemical route. Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) microspheres which have been produced through a double emulsion technique were incorporated into the CaP mixture for the purpose of bone cement solidification. The ratio of both compounds, CaP and PLGA, were set at 8:2. The CaP and PLGA/CaP bone cement were analyzed by ATR-FTIR, FESEM-EDX and contact angle analyses. The bone cement was composed of CaP and PLGA where the micro-powders of CaP were agglomerated on the PLGA microspheres. Addition of the PLGA has increased the hydrophilicity of the bone cement which will be beneficial for materials degradation and bone integration.\n\nEvaluation of the effects of implant materials and designs on thermal necrosis of bone in cemented hip arthroplasty.\n\nPubMed\n\nLi, Chaodi; Kotha, Shiva; Mason, James\n\n2003-01-01\n\nThe exothermic polymerization of bone cement may induce thermal necrosis of bone in cemented hip arthroplasty. A finite element formulation was developed to predict the evolution of the temperature with time in the cemented hip replacement system. The developed method is capable of taking into account both the chemical reaction that generates heat during bone cement polymerization (through a kinetic model) and the physical process of heat conduction (with an energy balance equation). The possibility of thermal necrosis of bone was then evaluated based on the temperature history in the bone and an appropriate damage criterion. Specifically, we evaluate the role of implant materials and designs on the thermal response of the system. Results indicated that the peak temperature at the bone/cement interface with a metal prosthesis was lower than that with a polymer or a composite prosthesis in hip replacement systems. Necrosis of bone was predicted to occur with a polymer or a composite prosthesis while no necrosis was predicted with a metal prosthesis in the simulated conditions. When reinforcing osteoporotic hips with injected bone cement in the cancellous core of the femur, the volume of bone cement implanted is increased which may increase the risk of thermal necrosis of bone. We evaluate whether this risk can be decreased through the use of an insulator to contain the bone cement. No thermal necrosis of bone "
