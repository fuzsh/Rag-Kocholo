A list of the data controllers and contact details can be found inÂ Appendix 1Â to this Notice.\n\nPlease carefully review this Notice. We will process any Personal Data we collect in accordance with applicable law and as explained in this Notice (unless, as explained below, a separate policy or notice governs).

To the extent you were provided with a different privacy notice or policy that applies, those policies or notices will govern our interactions with you, not this one.\n\nPersonal Data\n\nâPersonal Dataâ is any information â as electronically or otherwise recorded-- that can be used to identify a specific individual or that we can link directly to an individual, such as name, address, email address, telephone number, credit card number, or health or treatment information, as applicable. Personal Data in some jurisdictions can include information that indirectly identifies a person â such as a unique number assigned to a patient by a Healthcare Provider, even absent other identifying information. Please note that, for patients, as described below, we often receive information about you from your Healthcare Provider.\n\nPersonal Data may include information considered sensitive in some jurisdictions, such as biometric information, genetic information, health information, financial account information, specific geolocation, ethnic or racial origin, information concerning your sex life or your sexual orientation, social security number, driverâs license number, state identification card number, passport number, and other similar information. Personal Data that could be considered sensitive Personal Data under applicable law is indicated with a caret (^) in the chart below.\n\nThe below table is a high-level summary of the types of Personal Data we may collect from you. Following that high-level summary is additional detail and information on how we collect, process, and use Personal Data and the potential sources and recipients of your Personal Data, now and over the past twelve months. Some jurisdictions require us to state the legal bases for processing your Personal Data, which is included below, but please note that not all jurisdictions may recognize all legal bases.Â The types of Personal Data we collect and disclose depends on your relationship with Zimmer Biomet. Not all of the categories listed in the following charts may apply to you.

You should use care before posting information about yourself, including Personal Data. Because these are public postings, you should have no expectation of privacy or confidentiality in the content you submit to Interactive Features in connection with the Products and Services. Your disclosure of any Personal Data through the Interactive Features is at your own risk. Based on your disclosure of Personal Data through the Interactive Features we may use anonymized and/or de-identified data for which your individual personal characteristics have been removed such that you are not identified and the information is no longer considered Personal Data under data protection lawsÂ\n\nDepending on where you live, you may have the following rights with respect to some or all of your Personal Data:\n\nTo exercise the rights described under the section above titled âSelling and Sharing Your Personal Dataâ;\n\nTo request information about whether, and how, we process your Personal Data;\n\nto request access to and a copy of your Personal Data including to provide your Personal Data directly to another organization (called, in some locations, a right to data portability) (including under GDPR Articles 15 and 20);\n\nto request that we correct or update your Personal Data (including under GDPR Article 16);\n\nto request that we delete your Personal Data (including under GDPR Article17);\n\nto request that we restrict or block or to object to or opt-out of the processing of your Personal Data, including your sensitive Personal Data Â (including under GDPR Articles 18, 21 and 22), or to revoke your consent (including under GDPR Article 7);\n\nto appeal the denial of a request; and\n\nto lodge a complaint with the data protection authority in your jurisdiction.\n\nTo exercise these rights, appeal the denial of one of your requests, or make a complaint about how we process your Personal Data, please submit a request using the Privacy Request Form, write at privacy.nam@zimmerbiomet.com or for the US only, call us at 1-844-922-2721.
