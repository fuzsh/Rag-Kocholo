        "text": "The development of biomaterials have existed from around half a century and manifest its use in different fields. Biomaterials are used in living creature body, looking on its biocompatibility nature. In recent years, advances of biomaterials are showing a marked presence in the fast growing fields of pharmaceuticals and medicines. According to their availability, different types of biomaterials like metal, ceramic, polymer and their composites are used for several purpose in the body. In this review article, types of biomaterials have been discussed with their advantages, disadvantages and recent applications in the pharmaceutical field such as implants used to mimic the structure and function of tissues, dental implants, wound healing, cell regeneration, regenerative medicines, delivery of drugs and different organ regeneration. Organ regeneration leading to replacement of organs such as heart, trachea and lungs etc. by use of specific biomaterials have been reported with the diag..."
