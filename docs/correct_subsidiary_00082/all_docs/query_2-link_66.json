This Notice applies to Personal Data collected or processed by us online (through websites, applications, and otherwise), when we provide products or services to you, your doctor, hospital, medical treatment or scanning facility, or other healthcare provider (collectively, “Healthcare Provider,” which refers both to the Healthcare Provider institution, organization, or company, and individuals employed by or working for or with such organization), or your patients, and in other situations where you interact with us, including anywhere this Notice is posted or referenced (products, services, websites, and other systems will be referred to in this Notice as “Products and Services”). This Notice also applies to Personal Data that is collected or processed when you interact with us in-person, by telephone, or by mail.\n\n齐默Biomet may have other unique privacy notices that apply to certain specific situations, such as privacy notices for specific Products and Services in various specific circumstances. To the extent you were provided with a different privacy notice or policy and those policies or notices apply, those policies or notices will govern our interactions with you, not this one.\n\nIf you provide Personal Data of anyone other than yourself, please note that you are responsible for complying with all applicable privacy and data protection laws prior to providing that information to Zimmer Biomet (including obtaining consent, if necessary and required).\n\nPlease carefully review this Notice. To the extent permitted by applicable law, by providing us your Personal Data or otherwise interacting with us, you are agreeing to this Notice.\n\nThe Zimmer Biomet subsidiary or affiliate with whom you, your Healthcare Provider, or your patient is interacting or who owns and operates the Product or Service is, where applicable, the entity responsible for the collection and use of your Personal Data (known in some jurisdictions as the data controller). A list of the data controllers and contact details can be found in Appendix 1 to this Notice.\n\nPersonal Data\n\n“Personal Data” is any information that can be used to identify an individual or that we can link directly to an individual, such as name, address, email address, telephone number, credit card number, or health or treatment information, as applicable. Personal Data in some jurisdictions can include information that indirectly identifies a person – such as a unique number assigned to a patient by a Healthcare Provider, even absent other identifying information. Please note that, for patients, as described below, we often receive information about you from your Healthcare Provider.\n\nSome examples of instances where we collect Personal Data include if you:\n\nregister for an account for one of our Products or Services;\n\nsign up for newsletters or other informational or marketing materials;\n\nparticipate in our events, conferences, or trainings, including surgery trainings and Product and Service demonstrations;\n\nask us a question by contacting us;\n\napply for employment with us;\n\ninteract with us as a customer, vendor, supplier, or business partner or an employee or representative of same, including if you provide information about your customers or patients;\n\nrespond to our surveys or questionnaires;\n\nmake a complaint to us or to our customers about us; or\n\npurchase, use, or receive our Products or Services.\n\nWe will process any Personal Data we collect in accordance with applicable law and as explained in this Notice (unless, as explained above, one of our other policies or notices governs). In some circumstances, if you do not want to provide us with your information, certain Products and Services may be unavailable to you.\n\nBelow is a summary of how we may collect, process, and use Personal Data and the potential recipients of your Personal Data, now and over the past twelve months.
