        "text": "To facilitate patient healing in injuries and bone fractures, metallic implants have been in use for a long time. As metallic biomaterials have offered desirable mechanical strength higher than the stiffness of human bone, they have maintained their place. However, in many case studies, it has been observed that these metallic biomaterials undergo a series of corrosion reactions in human body fluid. The products of these reactions are released metallic ions, which are toxic in high dosages. On the other hand, as these metallic implants have different material structures and compositions than that of human bone, the process of healing takes a longer time and bone/implant interface forms slower. To resolve this issue, researchers have proposed depositing coatings, such as hydroxyapatite (HA), polycaprolactone (PCL), metallic oxides (e.g., TiO 2 , Al 2 O 3), etc., on implant substrates in order to enhance bone/implant interaction while covering the substrate from corrosion. Due to many useful HA characteristics, the outcome of various studies has proved that after coating with HA, the implants enjoy enhanced corrosion resistance and less metallic ion release while the bone ingrowth has been increased. As a result, a significant reduction in patient healing time with less loss of mechanical strength of implants has been achieved. Some of the most reliable coating processes for biomaterials, to date, capable of depositing HA on implant substrate are known as sol-gel, high-velocity oxy-fuel-based deposition, plasma spraying, and electrochemical coatings. In this article, all these coating methods are categorized and investigated, and a comparative study of these techniques is presented.\n\nDue to the chemical similarity to natural calcified tissues (bones and teeth) of mammals, calcium orthophosphates (abbreviated as CaPO 4) appear to be good biomaterials for creation of artificial bone grafts. However, CaPO 4 alone have some restrictions, which limit their biomedical applications. Various ways have been developed to improve the properties of CaPO 4 and their functionalization is one of them. Namely, since surfaces always form the interfaces between implanted grafts and surrounding tissues, the state of CaPO 4 surfaces plays a crucial role in the survival of bone grafts. Although the biomedically relevant CaPO 4 possess the required biocompatible properties, some of their properties could be better. For example, functionalization of CaPO 4 to enhance cell attachment and cell material interactions has been developed. In addition, to prepare stable formulations from nanodimensional CaPO 4 particles and prevent them from agglomerating, the surfaces of CaPO 4 particles are often functionalized by sorption of special chemicals. Furthermore, there are functionalizations in which CaPO 4 are exposed to various types of physical treatments. This review summarizes the available knowledge on CaPO 4 functionalizations and their biomedical applications.\n\nThe state-of-the-art on calcium orthophosphate (CaPO4)-containing biocomposites and hybrid biomaterials suitable for biomedical applications is presented. Since these types of biomaterials offer many significant and exciting possibilities for hard tissue regeneration, this subject belongs to a rapidly expanding area of biomedical research. Through the successful combinations of the desired properties of matrix materials with those of fillers (in such systems, CaPO4 might play either role), innovative bone graft biomaterials can be designed. Various types of CaPO4-based biocomposites and hybrid biomaterials those are either already in use or being investigated for biomedical applications are extensively discussed. Many different formulations in terms of the material constituents, fabrication technologies, structural and bioactive properties, as well as both in vitro and in vivo characteristics have been already proposed. Among the others, the nano-structurally controlled biocomposites, those containing nanodimensional compounds, biomimetically fabricated formulations with collagen, chitin and/or gelatin, as well as various functionally graded structures seem to be the most promising candidates for clinical applications. The specific advantages of using CaPO4-based biocomposites and hybrid biomaterials in the selected applications are highlighted. As the way from a laboratory to a hospital is a long one and the prospective biomedical candidates have to meet many different necessities, the critical issues and scientific challenges that require further research and development are also examined.\n\nNanometric particles and crystals play very important roles in biological systems. For example, calcium orthophosphates (abbreviated as CaPO4) of nanometric dimensions represent the basic inorganic building blocks of bones and teeth of mammals. According to recent discoveries in biomineralization, zillions nanometric crystals of biologically formed CaPO4 are nucleated in body fluids and, afterwards, they are self-assembled into these complex structures. In addition, both a greater viability and a better proliferation of various types of cells have been detected on smaller crystals of CaPO4. All these effects are due to a higher surface-to-volume ratio, an increased reactivity and biomimetic morphologies of the nanometric particles. Thus, the nanometric and nanocrystalline forms of CaPO4 appear to be natural for living organisms and, thus, they have a great potential to revolutionize the hard tissue-engineering field, starting from bone repair and augmentation to controlled drug delivery systems. Therefore, preparation and applications of nanometric CaPO4 are the important topics in modern biomaterial science and such formulations have been already tested clinically for various purposes. Currently, more efforts are focused on the possibility of combining nanometric CaPO4 with cells, drugs and/or other biologically active substances for multipurpose applications. This review describes current state of the art and recent developments on the subject, starting from synthesis and characterization to biomedical and clinical applications.\n\nBiodegradable metals have been suggested as revolutionary biomaterials for bone-grafting therapies. Of these metals, magnesium (Mg) and its biodegradable alloys appear to be particularly attractive candidates due to their non-toxicity and as their mechanical properties match those of bones better than other metals do. Being light, biocompatible and biodegradable, Mg-based metallic implants have several advantages over other implantable metals currently in use, such as eliminating both the effects of stress shielding and the requirement of a second surgery for implant removal. Unfortunately, the fast degradation rates of Mg and its biodegradable alloys in the aggressive physiological environment impose limitations on their clinical applications. This necessitates development of implants with controlled degradation rates to match the kinetics of bone healing. Application of protective but biocompatible and biodegradable coatings able to delay the onset of Mg corrosion appears to be a reasonable solution. Since calcium orthophosphates are well tolerated by living organisms, they appear to be the excellent candidates for such coatings. Nevertheless, both the high chemical reactivity and the low melting point of Mg require specific parameters for successful deposition of calcium orthophosphate coatings. This review provides an overview of current coating techniques used for deposition of calcium orthophosphates on Mg and its biodegradable alloys. The literature analysis revealed that in all cases the calcium orthophosphate protective coatings both increased the corrosion resistance of Mg-based metallic biomaterials and improved their surface biocompatibility.\n\nVarious types of grafts have been traditionally used to restore damaged bones. In the late 1960s, a strong interest was raised in studying ceramics as potential bone grafts due to their biomechanical properties. A bit later, such synthetic biomaterials were called bioceramics. In principle, bioceramics can be prepared from diverse inorganic substances but this review is limited to calcium orthophosphate (CaPO4)-based formulations only, which possess the specific advantages due to the chemical similarity to mammalian bones and teeth. During the past 40 years, there have been a number of important achievements in this field. Namely, after the initial development of bioceramics that was just tolerated in the physiological environment, an emphasis was shifted towards the formulations able to form direct chemical bonds with the adjacent bones. Afterwards, by the structural and compositional controls, it became possible to choose whether the CaPO4-based implants remain biologically stable once incorporated into the skeletal structure or whether they were resorbed over time. At the turn of the millennium, a new concept of regenerative bioceramics was developed and such formulations became an integrated part of the tissue engineering approach. Now CaPO4-based scaffolds are designed to induce bone formation and vascularization. These scaffolds are usually porous and harbor various biomolecules and/or cells. Therefore, current biomedical applications of CaPO4-based bioceramics include bone augmentations, artificial bone grafts, maxillofacial reconstruction, spinal fusion, periodontal disease repairs and bone fillers after tumor surgery. Perspective future applications comprise drug delivery and tissue engineering purposes because CaPO4 appear to be promising carriers of growth factors, bioactive peptides and various types of cells.\n\nCalcium phosphate (CaP) ceramic coatings have been used to enhance the biocompatibility and osteoconduc-tive properties of metallic implants. The chemical composition of these ceramic coatings is an important parameter, which can influence the final bone performance of the implant. In this study, the effect of phase composition of CaP-sputtered coatings was investigated on in vitro dissolution behavior and in vivo bone response. Coatings were prepared by a radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering technique; three types of CaP target materials were used to obtain coatings with different stoichiometry and calcium to phosphate ratios (hydroxyapatite (HA), a-tricalciumphosphate (a-TCP), and tetracalciumphosphate (TTCP)) were compared with non-coated titanium controls. The applied ceramic coatings were characterized by X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectros-copy.
