        "text": "Paul Kurtz had been playing the piano for about three years when he heard the fight song being played at a Florida Gators football game.\n\n\"What instrument is that?\" he remembers thinking. \"I want to play it.\"\n\nThe instrument was a trumpet. Today, almost five decades later, Kurtz, 60, is still playing his trumpet. He plays in two bands, the Jacksonville Community Band and the Recycles Orchestra.\n\nWhen he performs with the bands, he usually relies on his memory. Kurtz is blind, so to read music he has to play the trumpet one handed, which is challenging, especially when the music calls for him use a mute on his trumpet.\n\n\"I memorize fairly quickly,\" he said. \"I've had to all my life.\"\n\nBorn premature, Kurtz was placed in an incubator. Exposure to high levels of oxygen damaged his retinas. He had some light perception until he was about 11 years old, but he's functioned as a blind person his entire life.\n\nAfter earning a bachelor's degree in psychology from Florida Southern College, where he also played in the band, Kurtz went to Florida State University, earning a master's degree in counseling. while also taking music courses.\n\nBack in Jacksonville, Kurtz spent about a decade counseling disabled students at what is now Florida State College at Jacksonville. Meanwhile he earned an associate's degree from FSCJ in computer science.\n\n\"I could see computers were going to be the future for blind people and really for everybody,\" he said.\n\nThe married father of two children then spent about two decades as a computer programmer, systems analyst and systems manager at the Jacksonville Naval Air Station. The final two years of his career were back at FSCJ, teaching computer skills to blind students.\n\nFinding sheet music in Braille is difficult, Kurtz said. His own collection, gathered over the years, was compiled by getting sighted musicians to read the music to him while he recorded the notes on his Braille typewriter. He's also spent a lot of money to get music text books done in Braille. He's got a collection of about 30, for which he paid $300-$600 per copy.\n\n\"It's expensive being a blind person, by the way,\" he said.\n\nOver the years, he's taken many music courses and is fairly close to a bachelor's in music education from JU. But because of the expense of the tuition, Kurtz, who has been retired since 2008, said he isn't sure he'll ever finish that degree.\n\nBesides he stays quite busy. Both bands he plays with perform regularly and rehearse weekly except in the summer. The Recycles rehearse each Monday from 10 a.m.-noon at Riverside Avenue Christian Church, 2841 Riverside Ave. The Jacksonville Community Band rehearses each Tuesday from 7:30-9 p.m., St. Mark's Evangelical Lutheran Church, 3976 Hendricks Ave. Both bands are always on the lookout for new members, Kurtz said. He also plays weekly at his church, Christian Family Fellowship church on Old Middleburg Road.\n\n\"It's a lot of work for the members of these community music groups, rehearsing, traveling, and playing,\" he said. \"It's an investment of time and money. But it's worth it to provide people with that enjoyment and hope.\"\n\nCharlie Patton: (904) 359-4413"
