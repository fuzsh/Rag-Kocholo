        "text": "By Steven Huff\n\nBuffalo, Forest Lawn Cemetery, Part 2: Edward Caleb Randall and Paul Kurtz\n\nIn my Part 1 post on Forest Lawn Cemetery, I wrote that this expanse of wooded acres is the resting place of numerous people important to history, such as Millard Filmore, thirteenth President of the United States, Ely S. Parker, who wrote the terms of surrender at Appomattox, Seneca chief Red Jacket, and Louise Bethune, the first woman architect. I’ll add a few more here (and still more in Part 3).\n\nBuried here are 17 unidentified victims of the infamous wreck of the New York Express train of the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern railroad. Bound for Buffalo on the afternoon of December 18, 1867, the last two passenger cars jumped the rail on the bridge over Big Sister Creek in the town of Angola, near Lake Erie, and plunged into the creek, killing 49 and injuring 40 more. Most of the dead were in the last car which caught fire when the stove spilled. Known as the Angola Horror, it was one of the most tragic accidents in U.S. railroad history. The unidentified were burned beyond recognition. The tragedy led to safety reforms in railroad passenger cars—phasing out flammable wooden cars for iron, and the standardization of track gauges.\n\nThere is the Butler Mausoleum, for Edwin H. Butler, the founder and one-time owner of the Buffalo Evening News. It was his carriage, by the way, that on September 6, 1901, drove President William McKinley to the Temple of Music at the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo where he was shot by Leon Czolgosz.\n\nAnd singer-musician-producer Rick James (1948-2004), whose highly successful career, and troubled life, ended in cardiac arrest at his home in Burbank, California. His bestselling albums were Come and Get It, Fire It Up, and Bustin’ out of L Seven.\n\nI am going to repeat here the information from Part 1 on getting to Forest Lawn. From the New York State Thruway, take the Kensington Expressway (Route 33) west toward the city of Buffalo. Take the exit for the Scajaquada Expressway (Route 198) and follow it to the right-side exit for Delaware Avenue, where you will turn right. Following Delaware you’ll see the sloping hills of the cemetery on your left. Stay in the left lane. The corner of Delaware and West Delavan Avenue is tricky, and to turn into the cemetery gate on your left you must be very cautious.\n\nComing in the next post—Buffalo, Forest Lawn Part 3: Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm is buried in Forest Lawn, the first African American woman elected to Congress, and the first black candidate to run for nomination for president in the Democratic Party. She is the author of a captivating autobiography, Unbossed and Unbought. And Edward Streeter, author of the famous novel, Father of the Bride, which became a movie classic.\n\nThe two writers I am focusing on in this post could hardly be more dissimilar. Paul Kurtz was a scholar, skeptic, atheist, and secular humanist. Edward Caleb Randall was a skeptic and agnostic trial lawyer before converting to spiritualism and communing with the dead.\n\nEdward Caleb Randall (1860-1935): Speaking for the Dead\n\nHe was born in 1860 in Ripley, New York, a quiet rural town on the shore of Lake Erie, near Fredonia. It’s still a rural place. When you drive the New York State Thruway to the very western end, the surrounding fields and woods is Ripley. But Edward Caleb Randall’s life was on an upward spiral. Admitted to the bar at 23, he was a trial lawyer with a yen for business, and before he died he was board president of the American Superpower Corporation, the Niagara Terminals Buildings, Inc., Cataract Development Corporation, and two or three other business—all at once. It’s a wonder that he had time to get married, but he did, to Maria Howard of Buffalo, where he had migrated after a short stint as a lawyer in Dunkirk.\n\nMake no mistake, he was a serious man, and by accounts an agnostic. According to N. Riley Heagerty, “he had no place in his mind for even a conception of a spiritual existence, or for any agencies in the universe other than matter and force.”\n\nThings began to change in 1890 when several people came to him and asked him to investigate a certain Mrs. French of Rochester, who they said was a magician of some sort, and a fraud. Being a sharp trial lawyer, they assumed that he would raise the shade on her tricks. So, he went to 227 Tremont Street in Rochester and knocked on her door. (The house is no longer there.) And this is where the published account is a little fuzzy. The train from Buffalo to Rochester would have been a short ride, maybe a couple hours; but why would a renowned trial lawyer, a stalwart agnostic, bother with such an inquest? He must have been in one of those dire mid-life broods, although he was only 30. He must have been feeling his Doric columns trembling a bit.\n\nThe Real Mrs. French\n\nThe woman he met, Emily S. French, was an elderly widow with a bad heart, living with her daughter in a modest home, who refused to accept money for her services as a medium. Everyone who has written about her has attested to her civility and refinement, so Randall must have been a little disarmed. He was probably expecting a charismatic Madam Blavatsky, or an exotic with a crystal ball.\n\nAnd here’s another fuzzy thing: He says that he when he entered her house he met two other men “of national reputation.” He doesn’t say who they were, no doubt because he thought it wise not to expose reputable men who visit spirit mediums. One individual who was named as a regular participant in the early sessions was Monroe County judge William Dean Shuart, who died in April of 1900 and no longer needed protection. But all the published obituaries that followed, while attesting to his being an upright citizen with many friends and absolutely trustworthy, made no mention of his dabbling in spiritualism. Another was A. W. Moore, an immigrant artist from England who was then secretary of the Rochester Art Club. Both men were strong defenders of Mrs. French when others attended the seances and voiced disbelief and insinuated that she was a fraud.\n\nWith everyone seated, she turned out the lights. And the disembodied voices began to talk.\n\nIt was a life-altering experience for Randall. He became a firm believer in life after death and the author of six books on mediumship and the spirit world. In The Dead Have Never Died he wrote, “I have had strange experiences in my psychic investigations during the last twenty years. Refusing to be limited by accepted laws, I have devoted my thought to conditions prevailing beyond what is generally termed the material, and by combining and blending the mental and vital, with the tangible or physical forces, I have been able to have speech with those long thought dead. As a result I have found an unknown country about and beyond this Earth, and I would not go from this world of men without leaving a record of what I have learned.”\n\nOver the next twenty years—until her death in 1912—Randall and Mrs. French communed with the voices. Everyone joined hands in the seances, so it would have been impossible for her to pull a lever of some kind. Her house was searched for pipes or other apparatus by which some actor could have imposed his voice. Mrs. French was nearly deaf, and sometimes she would talk while a spirit was speaking, so it was not likely that she was an accomplished ventriloquist. Moreover, they held the same sort of sessions with Mrs. French at other people’s homes, with similar results.\n\nOne regular spirit voice claimed to be the Seneca chief Red Jacket, who lamented the state of his soul at the time of his death, blaming the “fire water” that whites had given him.\n\nThe New York Test\n\nIn early 1905, Randall wrote to the publisher Isaac Kauffman Funk, of Funk & Wagnall’s, and suggested that he test Mrs. French. He was the man who had employed more than 700 scholars to produce the Funk & Wagnall’s Standard Dictionary. Funk, a Lutheran minister, was also a psychic researcher, but particularly cautious. Shortly thereafter, he received a letter from Moore, also urging his attention to Mrs. French. But he declined. Then he was visited by an unnamed lawyer from Rochester who had been to numerous seances with Mrs. French, had known her for many years, and attested to her integrity. It seems there was quite a spiritualist movement in Rochester at that time in the higher circles of society, although very discreet. Funk relented.\n\nHe stipulated a number of conditions to avoid being duped. She was to travel to New York City alone except for one “lady escort.” The sittings were to take place at a home designated by Funk, one that he could thoroughly check, and that he would not make known to them until after they arrived. He later wrote that “These terms were accepted cheerfully.”\n\nAlthough in feeble health, Mrs. French was put through the wringer. She sat with Funk and others for nights on end, twelve sessions in all, in a locked room, and she repeatedly summoned voices purportedly from the world beyond, and Funk could find no possible way that she could have produced the voices herself. Red Jacket’s voice returned, saying, according to Funk, “’We live as real lives, more real—on this side than we did when on earth….In fact, everything here is so real that many who come over—die, as you call it—do not know for a long time that they are dead. A great part of the work to be done here is to instruct the dead in the true science of progress.’”\n\nApparently convinced, Funk recounted the sessions in his book, The Psychic Riddle.\n\nRandall wrote, “Again, one word to those who mourn. There is no death; there are no dead. Those whom we love and who loved us, in obedience to the great law of evolution, have simply progressed to a new plane of existence…. They walk with us, know our trials, help us by their mental suggestions, and comfort us by tender, loving thoughts.”\n\nBut it is fair to ask, what was really going on? Randall logged some 700 sessions with Emily French, some with his wife in attendance, some with Moore, Judge Shuart, some with Funk, and with numerous others. Many seances were held in the Randall home in Buffalo. Could all those people have been deluded on every occasion for the twenty years until Mrs. French’s death in 1912?\n\nThe Psychic Highway\n\nEmily S. French and her spiritualist associates could be viewed as an extension of the movement of enthusiastic religion that, beginning in the early 1800s, swept east to west across New York State along the route of the Erie Canal, which included revivalist denominations; millennialism, such as Millerism; Jemima Wilkerson’s cultist Public Universal Friends; Mormonism, which of course is now recognized as a solid denomination; and the Oneida Colony. The nineteenth-century evangelist Charles Finney called it the Burned Over District. But it is also called the Psychic Highway because it includes psychic phenomena and mediums, the most famous of which are the Fox sisters of Hydesville, New York. Today, the largest spiritualist community in the western world is Lilydale, in Chautauqua County.\n\nHis Books\n\nEdward Caleb Randall’s books are, Life’s Progression (1906); Future of Man (1908); The Dead Have Never Died (1917), which is his best-known title; Frontiers of the After Life (1922);Told in the After Life (1925); and The Living Dead (1927). There is also a more recent compilation of his work edited by N. Riley Heagerty, and titled, The French Revelation (1995, 2015).\n\nFinding the Grave\n\nFrom the Main Gate, follow the white, blue and yellow striped path until you come to the first bridge over Scajaquada Creek, then continue on that road through its winds until you reach the north end of the cemetery. Then the path curves to the east. Section X is on the right, which is your destination. Circle around the section—which will have you leaving the path for a new narrower one—until you see a sign “U/X” marking the border of the sections. You will see a prominent monument for R. L. Howard. To the left of that monument are two small stones for Edward C. Randall and his wife Maria.\n\nAnd, by the way, Emily S. French is buried in Mount Hope Cemetery in Rochester, in Section O—\n\nas is Judge William Dean Shuart, in Section 4.\n\nSources: Edward Caleb Randall, The Dead Have Never Died VVVVVVV; N.a., Biographical info on Edward C.

Funk, The Psychic Riddle, New York: Funk & Wagnalls, 1907, ebook;\n\nPaul Kurtz (1925-2012) Secular Humanist and Skeptic\n\nPaul Kurtz was a man whose life is both easy and difficult to summarize. Easy in that he held unwaveringly to secular, scientific and ethical humanism. Difficult, because in fact he did so much for the cause of nonreligion-based ethics, which he referred to as Planetary Humanism, and to scientific skepticism, a standard now carried by Richard Dawkins and others. And he was not afraid to cross swords in the cause.\n\nLike Leslie Fiedler (In Buffalo, Forest Lawn Part 1), he was born in New Jersey to Jewish parents, and came here to teach. He was Professor-Emeritus of Philosophy at the State University of New York at Buffalo, and chair of the Institute for Science and Human Values. He founded the Center for Inquiry in Amherst, New York in 1991. The brass plate that covers his grave, in addition to noting his service in the Army in World War II, reads, Secular Humanist. In case anyone should wonder.\n\nHe also added a word to the English language: eupraxophy, meaning an ethical, non-religious, life of free thought and logic, with a cosmic outlook based on science.\n\nIn 1969 he founded the publishing house Prometheus Books which published works on secular humanism which the big houses regarded as radioactive because of their anti-religious slant. It has always been the role of small presses in America to publish works that otherwise would not reach the reading public; Kurtz understood this, and the importance of the enterprise.\n\nHe founded the bi-monthly journal Free Inquiry in 1980, published by the Council for Secular Humanism, an affiliate of the Center for Inquiry, which is still an influential publication and a flagship for skepticism. He left the Center for Inquiry in 2010 after a dust-up with the board over succession. Anyone who has ever worked for a board knows how easily such things happen.\n\nHis Books\n\nKurtz wrote or edited more than fifty books, including, The Humanist Alternative (1973); Exuberance: An Affirmative Philosophy of Life (1978); Forbidden Fruit: The Ethics of Humanism (1988); Living Without Religion: Eupraxophy (1994); Humanist Manifesto 2000 (2000); Embracing the Power of Humanism (2000); Affirmations: Joyful and Creative Exuberance, (2004); Skepticism and Humanism: The New Paradigm (2001); and What Is Secular Humanism? (2006). His last book, The Turbulent Universe, was published posthumously by his old press Prometheus in 2013.\n\nFinding the Grave\n\nFrom the main gate, follow the yellow-blue-and-white-striped road, turning right before the bridge over Scajaquada Creek. Immediately after you pass the Mirror Lake Pond, you will be in a section of classic mausoleums—an extraordinary sight, really. Find a modest mausoleum for Sheehan on the right. To the right of that mausoleum is a tree, and to the right of the tree, is the humble brass plate over the grave of Paul Kurtz. It is flat on the earth; you have to walk up to it to see it.\n\nSources: Robert Evans, “Paul Kurtz, ‘giant’ of humanism, dead at 86,” Reuters, 22 Oct., 2012, web (accessed 10/11/18 P); “Paul Kurtz, ‘an extraordinary proponent of humanism,’ 1925-2012,” International Humanist and Ethical Union, 22 Oct. 2012, web (accessed 10/11/18).\n\nText and cemetery photos copyright 2018 by Steven Huff"
