        "text": "Your principles are dead… How can our principles become dead, unless the impressions (thoughts) which correspond to them are extinguished.” - Marcus Aurelius A Republic functions at its best when the populace has the same basic values, virtues and morals. Sharing similar principles is essential. “Reason” no longer seems “reasonable” once individual perspectives become increasingly skewed. When preference to things becomes so divided and diluted that we can’t reasonably decide on what is right and wrong, what is just and unjust, then functioning as a united people becomes delicate. The way to “undue” a well functioning republic is to start the undoing process on the young. When principles such as patriotism, manners, respect, and accountability are taken out of the schools and organizations; you slowly forget they exist, and therefore, these ideals slowly become extinct. But how do we fix it??? It has been fixed in the past multiple times. Sadly, those periods are scarred with tribulations and dark histories and no population ever volunteers to subject themselves to that type of situation to fix an issue that most do not even care about anymore. The young people are our single best hope! Teach your kids to read and think. Introduce the classics to them and let them dive down the works of the great writers of the past. They should read Plato and walk with Aristotle through his ethics. They should study Rome to understand our constitution. Converse with Plutarch and explore the Bible. Relax to Jane Austin and journal like Marcus Aurelius. Teach them to walk with Christ and ride along with Paul Revere. Allow their minds to sit for a bit in the Gulag with Alexander and read the sermon on the mount from the letters in red. Allowing your principles to be eroded away by the media, devious cultures, and selfish pleasures is not rational. We have the power to change the trajectory, we just have to be wiling to put in the effort and provide the wisdom and tools our children will need to make it happen. At this point, our best hope is in them. New Video Out on Marcus Aurelius’ Meditations! Enjoy! https://lnkd.in/g3sseB4q"
