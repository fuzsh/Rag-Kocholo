        "text": "In the debate “Is Goodness Without God, Good Enough?” we hear Dr. Paul Kurtz and Dr. William L.Craig debate whether or not you need to believe in God to be moral. Dr. Kurt defends the affirmative and Dr. Craig arguing the negative of this topic. Dr. Kurtz starts of his debate by saying that goodness without God is not only good enough but better than a religious morality. Dr. Kurtz then goes on to state that a person can be moral without God and that millions of Americans believe in morality but do not believe in God. Dr. Kurtz then suggests that religion is often an impediment to morality, but can have some positive consequences such as consolation, hope, and good will. He then notes that religion could have some negative consequences such …show more content…\n\nDr. Kurtz states “Humanists believe that happiness here and now is our basic good; not salvation in the afterlife or the next life” (12:19-12:33). Dr. Kurtz believes human beings are potentially moral that are capable of moral behavior. Humans are able of making moral choices, being good and right depends on social conditions and moral education. He thinks it’s important to cultivate and nourish the young the capacity for morality. Under these conditions, Dr. Kurtz thinks it possible to develop a sense of empathy towards other human beings. He believes that what we ought to do should depend upon a rational investigation of the alternatives. Children should learn what they ought to do from experience. We should develop moral sensibility that does not depend on authority or commandments. In his conclusion Dr. Kurtz says that morality is basic to the human condition, you live and learn and you learn by living. Humans change from experience, we cannot look back at the Bible or Coran for guidance but look ahead into the future. He argues that humans need to use their intelligence to identify common moral principles to which ethical dilemmas can be …show more content…\n\nCraig starts off by agreeing that humans can be moral without believing in God, but that goodness without God is not possible. He then lists three options: theism, humanism, and nihilism. Dr. Craig argues that humanism is not the default position. If theism is wrong, humanism does not win by default maybe then nihilism is right. He goes on to explain that Dr. Kurtz must show that in the absence of God, nihilism is not true. According to Dr. Kurtz, if theism is true, we have a sound foundation for morality. We would have a sound basis for objective moral values which means those values are true independent if anyone thinks so. Objective moral values are rooted in God, he is the source of moral values. If theism is true then we have a sound basis for objective moral duties. We have moral obligations whether we think so or not, they are divine commands. Also, if theism is true we have a sound basis for moral accountability. God is a just judge who will hold all of us accountable for our actions. Dr. Kurt then moves on to explain that if theism is false then we do not have a sound foundation for objective morality. If theism is false we have no moral values, humans are just like any other species of animals. In an atheistic view, human beings are by-products of socio-bio evolution. Dr. Kurt then claims that humanist are guilty of speciesism because they see humans as a special race. If atheism is true then human beings are not responsible for certain actions, such as rape,"
