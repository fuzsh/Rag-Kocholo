        "text": "A lot of things happened. Here are some of the things. This is TPM’s Morning Memo. Sign up for the email version.\n\nProject 2025 Is Dead, Long Live Project 2025\n\nOf all the Trump flailing over the past 10 days, nothing was quite as comical, nonsensical, and ineffectual as yesterday’s big push to try to shove Project 2025 – the centerpiece of MAGA world’s planning for a Trump II presidency – down the memory hole.\n\nWhere to even begin with this? It’s bogosity piled on top of bogosity in an effort to pretend it was a rogue effort by unsanctioned people very distant from the former president. None of that was true from the beginning. It wasn’t true yesterday. And it won’t be true tomorrow. What happened yesterday amounts to a whole lot of nothing.\n\nBut you don’t have to believe me. The Trump campaign effort to try to make it all go away was itself incriminated by the Trump fingerprints left all over the place. Nothing says “we had nothing to do with this” quite like forcing out the Project 2025 head honcho and making public statements that the same fate awaits anyone else who dares draw too much bad publicity for the former president.\n\n“Reports of Project 2025’s demise would be greatly welcomed and should serve as notice to anyone or any group trying to misrepresent their influence with President Trump and his campaign—it will not end well for you,” Trump campaign senior advisers Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita said in a statement (emphasis mine).\n\nOn the surface, the only semi-meaningful change seems to be the departure of Paul Dans, who was Project 2025’s director. Beyond that, the work of Project 2025, to the extent it wasn’t already done, will continue under the auspices of the Heritage Foundation, which has housed Project 2025 all along. “Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts will take over Project 2025’s operations,” the WSJ reported.\n\nMost importantly, the work that Project 2025 was doing is basically already done. It assembled a 900-page blueprint for a radical far-right agenda for Trump II and became a clearinghouse for potential personnel in a second Trump term. Perhaps a better way to phrase it is that a bunch of alum from Trump I have been charting out who they would hire for Trump II. None of that goes down the memory hole or disappears. “This tool was built for any future administration to use,” said Heritage’s Roberts.\n\nDespite the big display of opprobrium from the Trump campaign, including warning that participants in Project 2025 would be barred from serving in a Trump II administration, few took the threat very seriously:\n\nSome Project 2025 participants have responded by doubting a ban could be enforced when contributors include close Trump advisers such as former White House speechwriter Stephen Miller, former acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement Tom Homan, and former White House economic adviser Peter Navarro. Miller has denied his involvement in Project 2025, but his America First Legal group is a participating organization, and his deputy, Gene Hamilton, wrote the playbook’s chapter on the Department of Justice.\n\nThe best way to think of yesterday’s mini-eruption was as a calculated planned media effort by the Trump campaign to try to drive a stake through the heart of the ongoing series of negative stories about Project 2025 and its plans for Trump II. They needed a head on a pike as a sign that this was “real” and not just a media effort. Dans served that purpose, but one sacrificial lamb doesn’t make this any less of a targeted media effort. “Today’s news looks like political maneuvering, not a substantive disavowal of the policies Trump has advocated for up until now,” Joyce Vance rightly observed.\n\nThe icing on the cake is that Roberts, the Heritage Foundation leader who helped spearhead Project 2025 and will now pick up the pieces after the Trump campaign’s eruption, has a book coming out in September with a glowing forward from none other than GOP vice presidential nominee JD Vance.\n\nJD Vance Is The Oppo Gift That Keeps On Giving\n\nIt’s getting hard to keep track of all of the examples of JD Vance publicly scorning people without children over a period of years:\n\nTPM’s Emine Yücel: Vance’s History Of Extremist Remarks On Family Doesn’t Stop At ‘Childless Cat Ladies’\n\nMedia Matters: Three more Fox interviews where Vance lashed out at “childless” Democrats like VP Harris\n\nCNN: It’s not just ‘cat ladies’: JD Vance has a history of disparaging people without kids\n\nOn The Trail\n\nKamala Harris held a raucous rally Tuesday night in Atlanta, where Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-GA) had the crowd eating from his hand:\n\nKamala Harris will hold her first joint event with her not-yet-named running mate in Philadelphia on Tuesday, Politico reports, before the new Democratic ticket embarks on a four-day campaign tour through Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona and Nevada.\n\nPresident Biden will keynote the first night of Democratic national convention, CNN reports.\n\nTrump’s Blatantly Racist Appeal\n\nThese excerpts from Trump’s interview with Laura Ingraham don’t take any reading between the lines to understand:\n\n2024 Ephemera\n\nAZ-Sen: Big Lie aficiando Kari Lake won the GOP primary for U.S. Senate over Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb. She will face off against Rep. Reuben Gallego (D-AZ) in one of the most closely watched Senate races this cycle.\n\nBloomberg News/Morning Consult poll: Kamala Harris has turned a two-point Biden deficit across seven swing states into a 48%-47% lead over Donald Trump.\n\nElon Musk’s X/Twitter suspended and then reinstated the “White Dudes for Harris” account after its $4 million fundraising call Monday night.\n\nQuote Of The Day\n\nI picked this room for this interview. This is my favorite room in the Justice Department. It’s a law library. For more than 20 years, I was a federal judge. Do I look like somebody who would make that basic mistake about the law? I don’t think so.\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland, on U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon’s ruling in the Mar-a-Lago case that he unlawfully appointed Jack Smith as special counsel.\n\nGood Read\n\nJoan Biskupic: The inside story of John Roberts and Trump’s immunity win at the Supreme Court\n\nTina Peters Goes On Trial\n\nThe former county clerk in Mesa County, Colorado who stands accused of tampering with voting machines in 2020 in a cockamamie search for evidence of election fraud finally goes on trial in state court today. Just one of the many echo effects of Donald Trump’s Big Lie crusade.\n\nHey Folks!\n\nThe annual TPM Journalism Fund drive is in full swing. We’re more than halfway to our goal of $500,000. Many of you have already contributed. Thank you for that!\n\nIf you haven’t had a chance to click through and complete a transaction, it’s straightforward and will just take a moment.\n\nIt’s deeply gratifying to get the kind of reader support we do. It helps align our mission with our financing in a seamless, organic way that makes it crystal clear who we are here to serve with our work and who is here to support our work. That alignment is the bedrock underneath the TPM community.\n\nPlease contribute what you can so we that can tackle whatever comes next with clarity and purpose.\n\nWelcome To All The New Morning Memo Readers!\n\nWe added several hundred new Morning Memo subscribers in July. Welcome, it’s great to have you here!\n\nJuly was exactly the kind of news environment Morning Memo was designed to tackle: a blizzard of new developments, historic events, and roiling political turmoil.\n\nThe goal is to try to break the chaos down into constituent parts, find the common patterns that make seemingly disparate developments part of a coherent whole, and narrate through the turmoil in a way that makes things a little less chaotic.\n\nJuly was the acid test for that kind of daily approach to the news. Thanks for taking the plunge with us!"
