        "text": "The Journal of the History of Philosophy is an internationally recognized quarterly that publishes peer-reviewed articles, notes, discussions, and book reviews devoted to the history of philosophy. In light of the expertise of our editorial team, we consider contributions in the following areas: Ancient Greek and Latin Philosophy, early to late Medieval Philosophy (Latin, Arabic, Hebrew), and European and Anglo-American philosophical traditions from the Renaissance to 20th century. We also consider contributions that explore historical influences between these areas and with traditions in the history of philosophy not mentioned here. The journal publishes material in English, French, and German. It appears quarterly in January, April, July, and October."
