        "text": "Author: Ejikemeuwa Ndubisi J. O\n\nDepartment: Philosophy\n\nAffiliation: Nnamdi Azikiwe University Awka\n\nHuman life is full of puzzles and wonder. Certain things in the world appear to be mysterious. More so, the human person is a being that desires to know. In a bid to understand the puzzles of life, some people make certain claims to knowledge. While religion makes claim to knowledge with reference to a supernatural being or a deity, the paranormals try to interpret the puzzles of life beyond the range of normal experience or scientific explanation. Religion and the paranormals tend to go beyond nature in their quest to understand nature. This study, therefore, concerned itself with a critical appraisal of Paul Kurtz’s Eupraxophy. Eupraxophy is the humanist philosophy of Paul Kurtz. It is concerned with the good and wellbeing of the human person from the point of view of the natural light of reason. Kurtzian Eupraxophy is based on the proper use of reason, critical intelligence and wisdom. It therefore rejects any supernatural interpretation of the world and sees the human person as the measure of all things. For Kurtz, every claim to knowledge must be empirically justified for it to be accepted as a true knowledge. Against the understanding of Paul Kurtz’s Eupraxophy, some fundamental questions quickly come to mind: How reliable are the claims of religion and the paranormals? Can the claims of religion and the paranormals be rationally and objectively demonstrated? Is there any basis for religious and paranormal beliefs? To what extent can we say that the claims of religion and the paranormals are meaningful or meaningless? Do religion and the paranormals have anything to add to human knowledge? So, employing the method of philosophical analysis, this onerous research work attempted to provide answers to the above and the related questions. This study observed that most of the claims of religion and the paranormals cannot withstand thorough rational justification. More so, the way and manners religious and paranormal believers practice their beliefs have some social, economic, political and health implications. It is the submission of this study that it is only the proper application of human reason that will help the human person to understand the puzzles of life and be able to solve human problems. The work, among other things, calls for a total transformation from the culture of believing-without-inquiry into critical inquiry- before-believing, especially among contemporary Nigerians. This, in the view of this study, is one of the ways to minimize the excesses or the irrationalities of religious and paranormal beliefs.\n\nFor full copy of this document please visit the digital library help desk.\n\nAuthor: Nweke Innocent Ogbonna\n\nDepartment: Religion and Human Relations\n\nAffiliation: Nnamdi Azikiwe University Awka\n\nThe research studies how secularism has affected African Traditional Religion. This work will not understudy all the Africa world, it will for clarity sake study the African Traditional Religion in the old Anambra Local Government Area, comprising Oyi, Anambra East, Anambra West and Ayamelum Local Government Areas of Anambra State. It equally answers the question on whether African Traditional Religion is still relevant in the midst of secularism. It traced the historical development of secularism, and it was discovered through this study that secularism came from the West. It was traced back to the ancient philosopher Protagoras who propounded the theory, “man is the measure of all things”. This theory introduced into existence, the enthronement of man and reasoning, and the dethronement of God. However, the 18th – 19th century philosophers took after Protagoras and through their idea, the idea of God was relegated to the background, and reasoning was enthroned. It was also discovered that secularism came into Africa from the Western world and it came as a result of poverty, Christianity, colonialism and identity crisis. Secularism came in and changed the mentality of Africans from being “notoriously religious”, living communal life and having regard for life, to disregard for God, individualistic living and the abuse of life. Secularism, as discovered in this work, can be seen in different areas of the life of Africans – cultural, religious, and educational life. This work adopted the primary and secondary sources of data collection. The data collected were thoroughly analyzed with firm objectivity using historical and phenomenological methods of interpretation. The work argues that although secularism has done more harm than good to the African Traditional Religion, the African God is still relevant to the African man, bearing in mind that Africans are by nature religious. The study advocates the need for the media to be educated on a study of African culture since a lot of information pass through the media, and also the need for Africans to develop a theology that affirms the human person, in order to re-mould into shape the original identity of Africans. The study also reveals the need for Africans to develop the character of self – acceptance as against self – rejection. Africans should accept themselves first, what they have, and accept their values before others will accept them. The dissertation is of importance to the scholars of African Traditional Religion and lovers of African culture, who may want to embark on similar studies.\n\nFor full copy of this document please visit the digital library help desk.\n\nAUTHOR: OGUOMA, PATIENCE UCHENWA\n\nDEPARTMENT: MUSIC\n\nAFFILIATION: NNAMDI AZIKIWE UNIVERSITY, AWKA\n\nMusic constitutes the strongest, the most effective, remarkable tie and cultural identity of the member towns of Alaenyi clan. The musical activities include those of the adolescent girls which consist of singing of lullabies, folktale songs, play and game songs, entertainment music performances, singing of work songs, playing of musical instruments, and dancing during social ceremonies of Nwam e toola (puberty), marriages and burials. To a very large extent, avu ifo (folk songs) and avu oro (play songs) which form the bedrock of most adult traditional musical activities have evoked love, patriotism, to name a few; Nwam e toola (puberty rites) promoted chastity; charismatic and mesmerising Alija and other dances projected cultural heritage, and promoted chances for girls’ marriage; Iku nwa activated the spirit of industry and caring; while marriage activities taught respect and solidarity, among a litany of social values. In the light of those potentials listed above, it became apt and pertinent to save those musical activities from extinction. Using musical and anthropological equipment such as observation, participation, interviews, video and audio recorders, notes and scholarly writings, this descriptive study systematically identified and collected the music samples for documentation and further research. It discussed the historical and other ethnographic backgrounds of Alaenyi; studied and analyzed the musical and non-musical data: and adjudged their implications. The findings of the study revealed that, among other benefits, the younger generations would learn history, social norms, proper traditional dance styles, leadership and followership skills, and effective use of leisure time. Parents would get closer to their kids while schools’ curricula become highly enriched. Cultural heritage (material and non-material) of the communities are projected and enhanced, while the libraries are enriched with cultural artefacts for the State and National museums. The study would also benefit the Ministries of Information, Culture and Tourism, National and International Associations of Igbo studies, and Research Students of Ethnomusicology.\n\nTO VIEW THE FULL CONTENT OF THIS DOCUMENT, PLEASE VISIT THE UNIZIK LIBRARY WEBSITE USING THIS LINK, http://naulibrary.org/dglibrary/admin/book_directory/Music/11509.pdf\n\nAUTHOR: UBAKU, KELECHI CHIKA\n\nDEPARTMENT: HISTORY AND INTERNATIONAL STUDIES\n\nAFFILIATION: NNAMDI AZIKIWE UNIVERSITY, AWKA\n\nIgbo land is the home of Igbo people and it covers most of the south- eastern Nigeria. These people are culturally rich, industrious, friendly, and mostly literate. They have a dynamic and fascinating cultural heritage which says lots about them. Additionally, there exist inter-community relations among these people. Such relations usually take economic, political, social, and cultural dimensions, and this is the case of the people of Awo-Omamma and Amiri communities. This research work therefore reveals the various practices which have provided the pedestal for cordial economic, political, social, and cultural relations between the people of the aforementioned communities since 1970. The research further revealed some conflictual developments which have been negatively affecting these cordial relations. However, possible remedial measures were provided which if adopted can enable both communities to be conflict free and experience total cordiality in relating with one another.\n\nTO VIEW THE FULL CONTENT OF THIS DOCUMENT, PLEASE VISIT THE UNIZIK LIBRARY WEBSITE USING THIS LINK, http://naulibrary.org/dglibrary/admin/book_directory/History_International_Relations/11414.pdf\n\nAUTHOR: OKUDO CHRISTOPHER ODINAKOLISA.\n\nDEPARTMENT: GUIDANCE & COUNSELLING\n\nAFFILIATION: NNAMDI AZIKIWE UNIVERSITY, AWKA\n\nThe study was on adolescents’ appraisal of family background characteristics as determinant of their psychosocial adjustment level. The main purpose of study was to determine family background characteristics as judged by the adolescents and how that relates to their psychosocial adjustment levels. Ten research questions and seven null hypotheses guided the study. Correlation survey design was adopted for the study. The population of the study was all the students of senior secondary (II) students in Anambra state Nigeria during the 2010 academic session, totaling 12,560 students. The sample consisted of 600 students selected through Simple random procedure. The research instrument was a questionnaire titled Family Background Characteristic Evaluation Profoma (FABCEP) made up of 84 items grouped into six clusters. The data collected were analyzed using aggregate scores and Pearson’s product moment correlations to answer the research questions. The hypotheses were tested using t-test for correlations, t-test for mean scores and ANOVA at 0.05 level of significance. The findings revealed that nurturance pattern/socialization styles, family social standing, family level of expenditure on adolescents and education of parents were vital constituents of family background characteristics; it also revealed the students’ rating of their family nurturance pattern, social standing, level of expenditure and level of education as being fairly good, high, average and above average respectively. Furthermore, the adolescents rated their psychosocial adjustments to be fairly well adjusted and indicated that a positive and high relationship existed between their psychosocial adjustment and their family level of expenditure while the adolescents observed a moderate positive relationship between the family nurturance pattern, social standing in the community, education level of parents and their psychosocial adjustment levels. Based on the findings and their implications, the following recommendations were made; parents should be conscious of their obligations towards the socialization and upbringing of the children, realizing that socialization is a task, it is demanding, it needs skills and it is costly. They should avail themselves of the opportunities that make them informed persons. Finally, family social workers, agencies and institutions that interact with adolescents and parents especially counselors should facilitate information dissemination.\n\nTO VIEW THE FULL CONTENT OF THIS DOCUMENT, PLEASE VISIT THE UNIZIK LIBRARY WEBSITE USING THIS LINK, http://naulibrary.org/dglibrary/admin/book_directory/Guidance_and_counselling/11384.pdf"
