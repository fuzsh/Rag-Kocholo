        "text": "Because it can be difficult to define one’s worldview, I want to explore a particular term: non-denominational. In any context when you don’t know the exact terminology, it’s tricky figuring out how to find what you need. If Google has taught us anything, it is that!\n\nWhen I get a request for a non-denominational ceremony, after exploring this with the couple I discover what they actually want is a secular or spiritual ceremony. Not always, but fairly often. There is a common misunderstanding of this word \"non-denominational,\" and many reasons behind that.\n\nIf a couple does not have a house of worship they are attached to, they use non-denominational as a \"catch-all\" term. Some people are estranged from their faith and use this word looking for an alternative. Others may be getting married out-of-town and don’t know anyone there, so \"non-denominational\" casts a wide net. Or maybe they do not hold traditional religious beliefs at all and think the \"non\" part of the word means not, as in not religious.\n\nFor all these reasons this word, non-denominational, comes up often, in the hope it will fulfill a need. And we all need meaningful and honest rituals and ceremonies to mark the big milestones in life. We humans need someone or something to turn to for weddings, births, coming of age and death rituals. It can be hard to find the right fit.\n\nHere's what non-denominational actually means — it refers to any religious group that is not a part of a specific denomination, but usually accepting of most Christian practices. In other words, people from any and all Christian backgrounds. According to the Center for the Study of Global Christianity, a theological seminary, there are more than 200 Christian denominations in the U.S. and a staggering 45,000 globally.\n\nThe word some couples may be looking for is not non-denominational, but ‘secular,’ or ‘humanist.’ The main premise of the Humanist philosophy is the rejection the super-natural, with a belief in science. Very importantly there is an emphasis on morality based on learning and a perspective that strives to make life better for all people. The Humanist Society (full disclosure, I’m a Humanist Celebrant) has chapters in 70 countries. Humanism advocates for human rights and the building strong ethical lives through rational thought.\n\nAnother word that comes up frequently is ‘spiritual,’ defined as: the recognition of a feeling or sense or belief that there is something greater than myself, something more to being human than sensory experience, and that the greater whole of which we are part is cosmic or divine in nature. This idea is very compatible with secular humanism. As a celebrant, I often invoke nature, peace, the universe and concepts from far and wide to bring a sense of spirituality into any ceremony.\n\nAnd the word \"celebrant\" is also not common in the United States. Celebrant simply means someone who performs \"rites,\" or an officiant. In fact, priests are often called celebrants.\n\nThis unfamiliarity is why many couples are having friends and family members officiate their weddings. But I must put a little plug in for us professionals. We Humanist celebrants and other professionals have extensive training and guidelines and bring a lot to the table.\n\nIt is a sad misunderstanding to think that those who do not worship a Supreme Being (God, Jesus, Allah, or any number of incarnations or representations thereof) are without morals. This is certainly not the case. On the other side of that coin are people who claim to be religious only to discover they are completely without morals. That’s humans for ya!\n\nI’m not here to knock the non-denominational churches, many do great things in their communities. Some are so small as to meet in people’s homes or storefronts. They often run our food banks, emergency housings and tend to people in need, as Jesus intended. But others are more than happy to simply offer a feel-good approach, and mega-churches put on quite a show. Some non-denominational leaders are charismatic people who, in my opinion, are simply con artists. Joel Osteen, Creflo Dollar, Jesse Duplantis and Kenneth Copeland are worth millions. They all lead non-denominational churches. We don't know what they pay in taxes or how they spend their millions.\n\nAlso be aware that many leaders of non-denominational churches may have no background or education relevant to their role, not only spiritually, but as counsellors - not having attended seminary or other relevant training.\n\nWhen you look at Humanists and religious people you will find many shared values. According to Paul Kurtz, considered the father of secular Humanism, the goals of Humanism are to tell the truth, keep promises, be honest, sincere, benevolent, reliable, dependable, show fidelity, appreciation, gratitude, be fair-minded, just, tolerant. A humanist should not steal, injure, maim or harm other persons… a pretty good list of values, I’d say.\n\nI think we can all agree on that."
