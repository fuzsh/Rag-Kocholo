1. Paul Kurtz was an influential philosopher and skeptic, known for coining the term "secular humanism" and advocating for a rational, ethical, and non-religious worldview. What may surprise you is that he initially studied for the priesthood and was ordained as a Catholic priest before abandoning his religious beliefs.

2. Despite his background in philosophy and skepticism, Kurtz developed a keen interest in parapsychology and founded the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (CSICOP). He wanted to challenge paranormal claims and investigate them scientifically, but ultimately distanced himself from the field after becoming disillusioned with the lack of scientific evidence.

3. Kurtz played a significant role in the establishment of the American Humanist Association (AHA) and the International Humanist and Ethical Union (IHEU). He actively promoted humanist values, including reason, science, and compassion, and was involved in various humanist organizations around the world.

4. In addition to his work in humanism and skepticism, Kurtz was also a strong advocate for secular ethics and served as the editor-in-chief of the journal "Free Inquiry." He believed that ethical behavior can be derived from reason and empathy without the need for religious dogma.
