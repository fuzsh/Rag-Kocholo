        "text": "Dear Alex the reports are in the two archives you mention. The damage was largely rot, shot hits and stress of weather after her capture. Yours Andrew ________________________________________ From: Alex Pocklington [<a class=\"moz-txt-link-abbreviated\" href=\"mailto:drachinifel@thundersdawn.com\">drachinifel@thundersdawn.com</a>] Sent: 13 June 2012 21:31 To: Lambert, Andrew Subject: 'The Challenge' Good evening, I have recently purchased you fine book regarding the war of 1812 and would like to ask a question that has been bugging me for a while. It is to do with the capture of the USS President and her later dockyard survey wherein she was found to be damaged and rotted enough to warrant a break-up as opposed to a repair. Specfically, I was wondering if the dockyards report with the list and type of damage/rot they encountered is still available, and if so is it free to the public or would I have to contact somewhere like Kew or the National Martime Museum to view it? Many thanks for reading and many thanks also for the excellent read the book is providing. Alex Pocklington."
