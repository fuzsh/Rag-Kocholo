        "text": "Ruthlessly pursuing spectrum superiority over our adversaries! To meet the Air Force’s growing demand for spectrum effects, the 350th Spectrum Warfare Wing recently reactivated the historic 563rd Electronic Warfare Squadron, in San Antonio, Texas. The 563rd EWS’ history dates to World War II, and the unit most recently served as the Air Force’s electronic warfare and navigation officer training squadron. It provided undergraduate training to newly commissioned officers as the 563rd Flying Training Squadron until its deactivation in 2010. The 563rd EWS’ new mission is to design, develop and employ software-based EW capabilities that provide modern capabilities to warfighters. The unit will focus on executing software development, exploring areas for new software initiative, and educating the 350th SWW on software integration. As the Air Force reoptimizes itself for a new strategic environment, the electromagnetic spectrum is the global common that unites all domains of battle. The 350th SWW serves as the Air Force’s most consequential wing in winning its battles of today and tomorrow in the spectrum. #culture #veterans #America #Freedom #honor #Artist #Veteran #VeteranOwned #Military #MadeInUSA #MadeInAmerica #metalart #art #Artwork\n\nThe Air Force plans to introduce five EA-37B Compass Call electronic-attack aircraft in the upcoming fiscal year, part of a transition from the aging EC-130H fleet to a more modern and compact set of airborne jammers. These new jets, fitted with advanced electronic attack equipment, are designed to jam enemy signals, hack wireless devices, and suppress air defenses. The first of these aircraft was delivered last year, with the 43rd Electronic Combat Squadron at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base being the first to make the transition. The move comes as the Air Force aims to enhance capabilities against advanced adversaries and consolidate crew roles with the smaller airframe. #AirForce #CompassCall #ElectronicAttack #DefenseTechnology #sandiego #unitedstatesofamerica #OmicronVis\n\nAnother first one for us: All navy vessels with helicopter landing areas upgraded to Frictape Perimeter Safety Nets It is a bit of special moment for us at Frictape: for the first time ever, one sovereign Navy decided to upgrade all vessels with helicopter landing areas to our perimeter safety nets. And for the well known reasons - superior safety performance, ease of install and maintenance, lifetime, superior lifetime costs. And thousands of actual data points on in-field performance from last ca 20 years of usage globally - hard data talks more than marketing. We have multiple Navy and paramilitary organizations as our customers and they typically install our products on increasing amount of vessels - but seeing entire fleet going for Frictape is something special. Makes us feel trusted, humble and happy. Have a good week ahead ! #helideck #safety #offshore #navy #militarytechnology #helipad\n\nThe Air Force plans to introduce five EA-37B Compass Call electronic-attack aircraft in the upcoming fiscal year, part of a transition from the aging EC-130H fleet to a more modern and compact set of airborne jammers.

William L. Leukering, 28, of #Metropolis, #Illinois, killed during #WWII, was #AccountedFor Mar. 20, 2023. In the summer of 1944, Leukering was assigned to the 816th Bomber Squadron (Heavy), 483rd Bomber Group (Heavy), 15th Air Force based. Leukering was a radio operator on a B-17G Flying Fortress that was struck by enemy anti-aircraft during a bombing raid on German air defense installations in Memmingen, Germany. Due to the damage to the B-17G, the pilot ordered the crew to bail out. Six of the airmen parachuted successfully, while the other five crew members, including Leukering, were believed to still be on board. The surviving crew witnessed the aircraft explode in an area south of Memmingen, Germany. Leukering's body was not recovered, and the Germans never reported him as a prisoner of war. To identify Leukering's remains, scientists from DPAA used dental and anthropological analysis. Additionally, scientists from the Armed Forces Medical Examiner System (#AFMES) used mitochondrial #DNA (#mtDNA) analysis.
