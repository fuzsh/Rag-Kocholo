        "text": "In lieu of an abstract, here is a brief excerpt of the content:\n\n6 Luchino Visconti's (Homosexual) Ossessione William Van Watson In his article ''Anthropomorphic Cinema,\" Luchino Visconti disdained the term \"vocation\" in relationship to his profession as film director, calling it \"a romantic notion far removed from our contemporary reality, an abstract term coined for the artists' convenience, to distinguish their own privileged activity from that of other men.... To choose a profession does not mean to seal oneself off in it, as many artists do.\"1Visconti used the term \"anthropomorphic\" as a euphemism for the \"humanism\" associated with French cinema of the period, particularly with the cinema of Jean Renoir, with whom Visconti had worked as an assistant. Visconti called for an engage cinema that eschewed the \"artificial superimpositions \" of the calligraphers and established genres of Fascist-era cinema. Instead, he aspired to \"tell the stories of living human beings, men living in the middle of things.\" As opposed to the calligraphers' emphasis on mise-en-scene, Visconti asserted that \"the weight of the human being, his presence, is the only thing that fills up the motion picture frame.... The real problem is to find what is concrete and original in [his] personality.\" His stress on the iconic presence of the human being prompts Visconti to advocate the use of \"non-actors who ... have more authentic and healthier instincts\" than professional actors who inhabited a rarefied environment both off-screen and on. Partly because of this expressed interest in an engaged, humanist cinema and his declared support for the use of non-professionals, Visconti's first film, Ossessione (1942), an adaptation of James Cain's The Postman Always Rings Twice (1934), has often been viewed as a precursor of the neorealist cinema which would later blossom in postwar Italy. The film's empa172 Luchino Visconti's (Homosexual) Ossessione 173 thy for the disenfranchised, its predominance of medium shots that prioritize human interaction, the rawness of its footage, its bleak conclusion , the dense and detailed texture of its social sequences, and its use of location shooting, especially the expanse of the murky Padana region that would reappear in Roberto Rossellini's Paisan (1946), all argue for Ossessione as a neorealist prototype. In opposition to Mussolini's Fascism , neorealism leaned toward the left from its inception, so that Visconti 's longtime association with the Italian Communist Party (PCI) and his active participation in the partisan cause during the Nazi occupation of Rome served to provide retroactive confirmation of Ossessione 's proto-neorealist pedigree. In contrast to neorealist theorists' attempts to reclaim Ossessione as a neorealist, and therefore, objective film, it is largely an example of auteurist, and therefore, subjective cinema. Despite his protests to the contrary, much of Visconti's work is bathed in \"romantic notion[s] far removed from our contemporary reality,\" and the arc of his filmography reveals an artist increasingly \"sealed off\" in the sort of aesthetic hermeticism he disdained in the Fascist-era calligraphers. To be fair, though, Roberto Campari is perhaps most accurate in his assessment of Visconti as the \"grand synthesis\" of the dual and dueling Italian cinematic traditions of overt aestheticism and critical social engagement.2 During his search for the \"concrete and original\" in the human being in Ossessione, Visconti employed calligraphism in a viably integrated manner. He recreates the work of painter Renato Guttuso when Giovanna sits down amid a mass of dirty bottles and dishes in the kitchen after a busy day at the trattoria. Another scene shows her slouched in an isolated chair in an homage to Vincent Van Gogh, while the very figure of Giovanna herself was consciously modeled after women in the paintings of the artist Amedeo Modigliani. One of Visconti's identifying characteristics as film auteur would become his meticulous and brilliant deployment of mise-en-scene, so much so that he is sometimes pejoratively dismissed as a mere \"metteur-en-scene. \" Visconti's pessimism further distinguishes his filmography as a whole, and Ossessione in particular, from neorealist cinema. Millicent Marcus has sensitively recounted neorealism's provocative nature, its preference for proactive prescription over passive description, and its goal of inciting change with its agitational endings.3 Ossessione's bleak ending differs from those of the neorealist works of Rossellini and Vittorio De Sica, in that the death of Giovanna and the arrest of Gino inspire no call to arms, nor do they reverberate with echoes of social ills to be cured. Rather than looking forward to the Marxist utopian prescriptions of neorealism proper, Ossessione looks back to..."
