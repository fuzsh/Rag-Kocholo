        "text": "Roberto Rossellini’s “War Trilogy,” a new boxed set from Criterion, is something of a misnomer. Only two of its films are set in the Second World War; all three of these works, however, look ahead to the world that had to be reconstructed after its end.\n\nRossellini conceived “Rome Open City”—which is widely hailed as the seminal work of Italian neorealism—in June, 1944, as he watched Italians cheer the arriving American Army. He first planned to make a movie about the newly liberated city, but instead told a story about the era that had just ended: the struggle of the Italian resistance against the German occupation. The drama, centered on a cell of fighters trying to avoid capture, also highlights Italy’s postwar political fault lines in its depiction of an anti-Fascist priest’s surprising alliance with Communists. The film’s first part features the Germans’ bloody roundup of resisters; the second, set mainly in German headquarters, depicts torture and execution. Rossellini’s unflinching depiction of harsh social and physical realities goes hand-in-hand with expressive performances (it’s the film that made Anna Magnani an international star) and melodramatic turns: for Rossellini, a clear view of the world implied an unambiguous morality as well.\n\nIn a 1970 interview included as an extra in the set, Rossellini explained that his “neorealism” meant simply “to get rid of the structure” of conventional moviemaking. The sketch-like format of the six-part “Paisan,” from 1946, enabled him to mix actors and nonactors, to film in sequence and improvise his stories as he went along, and to use newsreel-style camerawork. The stories focus largely on the relations of American forces with the local population during the last days of the war and the beginning of reconstruction, but here, too, the main themes are degradation, destruction, and death (the movie begins and ends with executions committed by German occupiers). Yet for Rossellini, liberation was also a matter of aesthetics: his audaciously spontaneous methods were a sign not merely of authenticity but also of freedom.\n\nFilmed in the ruins of Berlin in 1947, “Germany Year Zero” tells a horrific story of a twelve-year-old boy whose family lives in desperate poverty. While attempting to help in any way he can, the boy falls into the clutches of a former teacher, a discredited Nazi, who lures him with political propaganda into a terrible crime. In all three films, Rossellini gives the Germans plenty of screen time (the effete, bilingual S.S. officer in “Rome Open City” seems to be a template for Quentin Tarantino’s Colonel Hans Landa) and lets them vent their ideology at length: for Rossellini, the war was also a war of ideas, and it’s one that, even with the arrival of peace, was hardly won. ♦"
