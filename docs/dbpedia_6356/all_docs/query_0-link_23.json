        "text": "Part of my 5 Directors x 5 Unseen Films (9) challenge.\n\nThis follow-up to director Roberto Rossellini's Rome, Open City (1945) is the second installment of his \"War Trilogy,\" moving the point of focus from the German occupation to the Allied invasion and liberation of Italy in 1943-44. The film is divided into six segments, each one relating a story of a specific location heading north from Sicily to Naples, then Rome, Florence, a monastery in the Appenine Range toward San Marino and eventually Porte Tolle in the Po River Delta south of Venice.\n\nRossellini's genius was to make communication and understanding between the Americans and the Italians the main emphasis of the film, as apart from the war against the Germans and fascists. He shows how the level of comprehension grows from ignorance and mistrust in the first episode to true camaraderie by the final scene. Language barriers and cultural differences account for much of the confusion encountered here, but an honest desire to connect overcomes those and brings the two nationalities into a real \"paisà\" (countryman) relationship.\n\nMy favorite episodes of the six were the fourth and fifth ones, which bring nurse Harriet White (Harriet Medin) into harm's way and three American Army chaplains into contact with with skeptical Franciscan monks. I also liked how newsreel footage was used to set up each episode, except the last, which ends on an unexpectedly sad note.\n\nAt the very first Venice Film Festival in 1946, this won the ANICA Cup and the International Critics Award - Special Mention. It was also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Writing, Story and Screenplay four years later."
