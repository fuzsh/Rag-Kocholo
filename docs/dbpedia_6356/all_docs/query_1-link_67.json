        "text": "From Between Two Worlds: Juliette Binoche as Marianne Winkler, an uncover journalist working with people who clean luxurious ferries in the dead of night\n\nDear friends,\n\nSo here I am with the second part of this blog, only this time I begin with a good movie, again focusing on women, which I’ve just seen and want to recommend, and then go on to the four poems I want to share. Between Two Worlds is based on Florence Aubenas’s The Night Cleaner, a best-selling memoir of a journalist who presented herself as another near destitute person to an employment agency, where she is led to take a low paid gruelling job as a cleaning person in a team driven to do far too much for them in a brief period of time. Like The Miracle Club, it’s directed and written by women, with a nearly all women cast, and like them is getting mostly luke-warm reviews, which this time concentrate indignantly on the attention spent on the hypocrisy of passing and using other people’s trust and friendship to produce a book. (An English language version of this is Barbara Ehrenreich’s Nickel and Dimed, by contrast, curiously enough treated with real respect.)\n\nI find the supposed discomfort with Binoche and the story-line as narrow and unfair as the reviewers find the POV of the film. It’s the experience itself, what it’s like to live such a life, and the knowledge that huge numbers of people in the world’s economies now are driven to such extremities (3 jobs with barely time to sleep), treated harshly and indifferently. I found myself remembering my 27 years as an adjunct and the snobbery and hard work for a derisory salary I was subjected to; remembering my daughter Laura’s two years working with a team of lighting and decoration experts who did the same kind of hard work in the dead of night at stop speed, pushed on harshly by supervisors; I saw it with two women friends, and they too when it was over, had been excited and moved to remember analogous experiences of their own. The gig economy now reaches millions of people in the US. Not only go see it, but vote to help unions, to re-distribute taxes so the wealthy pay their real share, and the money used to create reform, change and better working lives for all people.\n\n***************************************\n\nAnd now I have four more poems to share that I know Jim loved to read from poets who were his favorites. For Philip Larkin, W. H. Auden, e.e. cummings and C.P. Cavafy Jim had several books each, sometimes it was just books of poetry (cummings 4 books), sometimes books of letters and a life (Auden and Cavafy), and sometimes studies of the poetry with just one book (Larkin).\n\nThe poetry by Larkin Jim inclined to most was not the famous shocker types (“This be the verse”) but more the longer ones drenched in history (around churches, chapels, buildings), but he quoted the most\n\nHigh Windows\n\nWhen I see a couple of kids\n\nAnd guess he’s fucking her and she’s\n\nTaking pills or wearing a diaphragm,\n\nI know this is paradise\n\nEveryone old has dreamed of all their lives—\n\nBonds and gestures pushed to one side\n\nLike an outdated combine harvester,\n\nAnd everyone young going down the long slide\n\nTo happiness, endlessly. I wonder if\n\nAnyone looked at me, forty years back,\n\nAnd thought, That’ll be the life;\n\nNo God any more, or sweating in the dark\n\nAbout hell and that, or having to hide\n\nWhat you think of the priest. He\n\nAnd his lot will all go down the long slide\n\nLike free bloody birds. And immediately\n\nRather than words comes the thought of high windows:\n\nThe sun-comprehending glass,\n\nAnd beyond it, the deep blue air, that shows\n\nNothing, and is nowhere, and is endless.\n\nNow Jim himself is gone into that blue sky. This is very much worth reading on Larkin’s poetry in general.\n\n************************************************\n\nI’m probably going to be quoting the famous poems here, for again with W. H. Auden I see some longer moving meditative pieces that are too long, but I cannot resist (with its very own picture)\n\nMusee des Beaux Arts\n\nAbout suffering they were never wrong,\n\nThe old Masters: how well they understood\n\nIts human position: how it takes place\n\nWhile someone else is eating or opening a window or just walking dully along;\n\nHow, when the aged are reverently, passionately waiting\n\nFor the miraculous birth, there always must be\n\nChildren who did not specially want it to happen, skating\n\nOn a pond at the edge of the wood:\n\nThey never forgot\n\nThat even the dreadful martyrdom must run its course\n\nAnyhow in a corner, some untidy spot\n\nWhere the dogs go on with their doggy life and the torturer’s horse\n\nScratches its innocent behind on a tree.\n\nIn Breughel’s Icarus, for instance: how everything turns away\n\nQuite leisurely from the disaster; the ploughman may\n\nHave heard the splash, the forsaken cry,\n\nBut for him it was not an important failure; the sun shone\n\nAs it had to on the white legs disappearing into the green\n\nWater, and the expensive delicate ship that must have seen\n\nSomething amazing, a boy falling out of the sky,\n\nHad somewhere to get to and sailed calmly on.\n\nLandscape with the Fall of Icarus, c.1555 (oil on canvas) by Bruegel, Pieter the Elder (c.1525-69)\n\nHis is a messy poetry.\n\n*****************************************\n\ne.e. cummings Jim appreciated the love poetry, the erotic stuff, the lack of pomposity; many of them are impossible to replicate in a blog, for their effect is dependent on stanzaic playfulness, breaking with regular punctuation. Jim found cummings to be joyful, and I’ll copy one of those I think his best, very allusive:\n\nanyone lived in a pretty how town\n\nanyone lived in a pretty how town\n\n(with up so floating many bells down)\n\nspring summer autumn winter\n\nhe sang his didn’t he danced his did.\n\nWomen and men(both little and small)\n\ncared for anyone not at all\n\nthey sowed their isn’t they reaped their same\n\nsun moon stars rain\n\nchildren guessed(but only a few\n\nand down they forgot as up they grew\n\nautumn winter spring summer)\n\nthat no one loved him more by more\n\nwhen by now and tree by leaf\n\nshe laughed his joy she cried his grief\n\nbird by snow and stir by still\n\nanyone’s any was all to her\n\nsomeones married their everyones\n\nlaughed their cryings and did their dance\n\n(sleep wake hope and then)they\n\nsaid their nevers they slept their dream\n\nstars rain sun moon\n\n(and only the snow can begin to explain\n\nhow children are apt to forget to remember\n\nwith up so floating many bells down)\n\none day anyone died i guess\n\n(and noone stooped to kiss his face)\n\nbusy folk buried them side by side\n\nlittle by little and was by was\n\nall by all and deep by deep\n\nand more by more they dream their sleep\n\nno one and anyone earth by april\n\nwish by spirit and if by yes.\n\nWomen and men(both dong and ding)\n\nsummer autumn winter spring\n\nreaped their sowing and went their came\n\nsun moon stars rain\n\n********************************************************\n\nPenelope by Angelica Kauffmann\n\nAnd now Cavafy where Jim had too many favorites but above all there was\n\nIthaca (so many translations, this by Edmund Keely)\n\nAs you set out for Ithaka\n\nhope your road is a long one,\n\nfull of adventure, full of discovery.\n\nLaistrygonians, Cyclops,\n\nangry Poseidon—don’t be afraid of them:\n\nyou’ll never find things like that on your way\n\nas long as you keep your thoughts raised high,\n\nas long as a rare excitement\n\nstirs your spirit and your body.\n\nLaistrygonians, Cyclops,\n\nwild Poseidon—you won’t encounter them\n\nunless you bring them along inside your soul,\n\nunless your soul sets them up in front of you.\n\nHope your road is a long one.\n\nMay there be many summer mornings when,\n\nwith what pleasure, what joy,\n\nyou enter harbors you’re seeing for the first time;\n\nmay you stop at Phoenician trading stations\n\nto buy fine things,\n\nmother of pearl and coral, amber and ebony,\n\nsensual perfume of every kind—\n\nas many sensual perfumes as you can;\n\nand may you visit many Egyptian cities\n\nto learn and go on learning from their scholars.\n\nKeep Ithaka always in your mind.\n\nArriving there is what you’re destined for.\n\nBut don’t hurry the journey at all.\n\nBetter if it lasts for years,\n\nso you’re old by the time you reach the island,\n\nwealthy with all you’ve gained on the way,\n\nnot expecting Ithaka to make you rich.\n\nIthaka gave you the marvelous journey.\n\nWithout her you wouldn’t have set out.\n\nShe has nothing left to give you now.\n\nAnd if you find her poor, Ithaka won’t have fooled you.\n\nWise as you will have become, so full of experience,\n\nyou’ll have understood by then what these Ithakas mean.\n\nFor this I have a video of another poet reading aloud his response:\n\nA response by Theo Dorgan\n\nWhen you set out from Ithaca again,\n\nlet it be autumn, early, the plane leaves falling as you go,\n\nfor spring would shake you with its quickening,\n\nits whispers of youth.\n\nYou will have earned the road down to the harbour,\n\nduty discharged, your toll of labour paid,\n\nthe house four-square, your son in the full of fatherhood,\n\nhis mother, your long-beloved, gone to the shades.\n\nWalk by the doorways, do not look left or right,\n\ndo not inhale the woodsmoke,\n\nthe shy glow of the young girls,\n\nthe resin and pine of home.\n\nAllow them permit you to leave,\n\nthey have been good neighbours.\n\nPlank fitted to plank, slow work and sure,\n\nthe mast straight as your back.\n\nWater and wine, oil, salt and bread.\n\nTake a hand in yours for luck.\n\nCast off the lines without a backward glance\n\nand sheet in the sail.\n\nThere will be harbours, shelter from weather,\n\nThere will be long empty passages far from land.\n\nThere may be love or kindness, do not count on this\n\nbut allow for the possibility.\n\nBe ready for storms.\n\nWhen you take leave of Ithaca, round to the south\n\nthen strike far down for Circe, Calypso,\n\nwhat you remember, what you must keep

It is very sad to me that I cannot go out at night as I cannot drive at night any more. It’s also been another summer of dream frustration (for the desire is a product of dreams) without any trip to the beach.\n\nI have been missing Jim very badly this 11th summer without him for himself as my one friend who understood and for other reasons too.\n\nFor me there’s been less going out, not more; I love my online life but there is increasingly less of that too. It’s hard for me to keep this blog up as I work on projects for papers or reviews, and follow my own bents too. I also discover that I don’t remember details as well; my mind is more diffusely alive to the social world around me and not so filled with books as it once was; I’m more outward without being able to cope with social life any more than I once did. I would do so much better with and for Jim if we had a second time round — but, as Father Macdermot hints (see The Miracle Club below, especially click on the reviews), there are no miracles of the traditional type for us to discern.\n\nBut over this week or today I’ve been cheered by feeling reminded a couple of times of poetry by men (and it does seem to have been all by men) whom Jim would read and reread, and whose work it may be said constituted his favorite: I have much in house on and by Basil Bunting, William Empson, John Betjeman, Robert Graves, Philip Larkin, W.H. Auden, e.e. cummings, C. P Cavafy.\n\nToday I also attended the National Book Festival located here in DC, — from home (so I could also read 8 essays on Trollope and shop with Izzy in five different places for groceries & and the like): I listened to and watched three full and several parts of various sessions. Now one type of book missing it seemed to me (very strange but perhaps showing the commercialization of this fair) was poetry, so here finally a subject for a blog that might interest people: a few of Jim’s favorite poems, from four of these people, those I know he read over and over. I’ve linked the poetry into discussions of these poets and these poems (one by me)\n\nBasil Bunting:\n\nA thrush in the syringa sings.\n\nHunger ruffles my wings, fear,\n\nlust, familiar things\n\nDeath thrusts hard. My sons\n\nby hawk’s beak, by stones,\n\ntrusting weak wings\n\nby cat and weasel, die.\n\nThunder smothers the sky.\n\nFrom a shaken bush I\n\nlist familiar things\n\nfear, hunger, lust.\n\nO gay thrush!\n\nWilliam Empson:\n\nMissing Dates A villanelle\n\nSlowly the poison the whole blood stream fills.\n\nIt is not the effort nor the failure tires.\n\nThe waste remains, the waste remains and kills.\n\nIt is not your system or clear sight that mills\n\nDown small to the consequence a life requires;\n\nSlowly the poison the whole blood stream fills.\n\nThey bled an old dog dry yet the exchange rills\n\nOf young dog blood gave but a month’s desires.\n\nThe waste remains, the waste remains and kills.\n\nIt is the Chinese tombs and the slag hills\n\nUsurp the soil, and not the soil retires.\n\nSlowly the poison the whole blood stream fills.\n\nNot to have fire is to be a skin that shrills.\n\nThe complete fire is death. From partial fires\n\nThe waste remains, the waste remains and kills.\n\nIt is the poems you have lost, the ills\n\nFrom missing dates, at which the heart expires.\n\nSlowly the poison the whole blood stream fills.\n\nThe waste remains, the waste remains and kills.\n\nFor a very different mood, from Summoned By Bells (one of Jim’s favored volumes). One aspect is the book supplies psychological and spiritual experiences attached to local places, to your memory of your past — and Jim came from, grew up in southeastern England.\n\nJohn Betjeman:\n\nDEAR lanes of Cornwall! With a one-inch map,\n\nA bicycle and well-worn “Little Guide”,\n\nThose were the years I used to ride for miles\n\nTo far-off churches. One of them that year\n\nSo worked on me that, if my life was changed,\n\nI owe it to St. Ervan and his priest\n\nIn their small hollow deep in sycamores.\n\nThe time was tea-time, calm free-wheeling time,\n\nWhen from slashed tree-tops in the combe below\n\nI heard a bell-note floating to the sun;\n\nIt gave significance to lichened stone\n\nAnd large red admirals with outspread wings\n\nBasking on buddleia. So, casting down\n\nIn the cool shade of interlacing boughs,\n\nI found St. Ervan’s partly ruined church.\n\nIts bearded Rector, holding in one hand\n\nA gong-stick, in the other hand a book,\n\nStruck, while he read, a heavy-sounding bell,\n\nHung from an elm bough by the churchyard gate.\n\n“Better come in. It’s time for Evensong.”\n\nThere wasn’t much to see, there wasn’t much\n\nThe “Little Guide” could say about the church.\n\nHoly and small and heavily restored,\n\nIt held me for the length of Evensong,\n\nSaid rapidly among discoloured walls,\n\nImpatient of my diffident response.\n\n“Better come in and have a cup of tea.”\n\nThe Rectory was large, uncarpeted;\n\nBooks and oil-lamps and papers were about;\n\nThe study’s pale green walls were mapped with damp;\n\nThe pitch-pine doors and window-frames were cracked;\n\nLoose noisy tiles along the passages\n\nLed to a waste of barely furnished rooms:\n\nClearly the Rector lived here all alone.\n\nHe talked of poetry and Cornish saints;\n\nHe kept an apiary and a cow;\n\nHe asked me which church service I liked best —\n\nI told him Evensong… “And I suppose\n\nYou think religion’s mostly singing hymns\n\nAnd feeling warm and comfortable inside?”\n\nAnd he was right: most certainly I did.\n\n“Borrow this book and come to tea again.”\n\nWith Arthur Machen’s “Secret Glory” stuffed\n\nInto my blazer pocket, up the hill\n\nOn to St. Merryn, down to Padstow Quay\n\nIn time for the last ferry back to Rock,\n\nI bicycled — and found Trebetherick\n\nA worldly contrast with my afternoon.\n\nI would not care to read that book again.\n\nIt so exactly mingled with the mood\n\nOf those impressionable years, that now\n\nI might be disillusioned. There were laughs\n\nAt public schools, at chapel services,\n\nAt masters who were still ‘big boys at heart’—\n\nWhile all the time the author’s hero knew\n\nA Secret Glory in the hills of Wales:\n\nCaverns of light revealed the Holy Grail\n\nExhaling gold upon the mountain-tops;\n\nAt “Holy! Holy! Holy!” in the Mass\n\nKing Brychan’s sainted children crowded round,\n\nAnd past and present were enwrapped in one.\n\nIn quest of mystical experience\n\nI knelt in darkness at St. Enodoc;\n\nI visited our local Holy Well,\n\nWhereto the native Cornish still resort\n\nFor cures for whooping-cough, and drop bent pins\n\nInto its peaty water . . . Not a sign:\n\nNo mystical experience was vouchsafed:\n\nThe maidenhair just trembled in the wind\n\nAnd everything looked as it always looked . . .\n\nBut somewhere, somewhere underneath the dunes,\n\nSomewhere among the cairns or in the caves\n\nThe Celtic saints would come to me, the ledge\n\nOf time we walk on, like a thin cliff-path\n\nHigh in the mist, would show the precipice.\n\nRobert Graves:\n\nWhen I first met Jim he couldn’t stop talking about Robert Graves’s White Goddess (he was very young, not 21), and over our first couple of years we acquired his extraordinary Greek Myths (now a foundational resource for me), the I, Claudius books, Goodbye to All That, his travel regional writing and of course Collected Poems. This remains my favorite, read aloud to me by Jim so many years ago:\n\nShe tells her love while half asleep\n\nShe tells her love while half asleep,\n\nIn the dark hours,\n\nWith half-words whispered low:\n\nAs Earth stirs in her winter sleep\n\nAnd put out grass and flowers\n\nDespite the snow,\n\nDespite the falling snow\n\n***********************\n\nMaggie Smith as Lily\n\nI am not going to resist adding (non sequitor) that I went to a very different kind of movie than those two millions of US people have been to see in the last three weeks: The Miracle Club by Thaddeus O’Sullivan, filmed in Ireland (where I shall go next year with Road Scholar at last). This modest summer movie is better and more successful than people make out: a relief against the over-produced overloud overaggressive Barbie and Oppenheimer, and done tastefully so that what moves is not meretricious. To me and a woman friend I went with (a new British friend, just my age, with husband and autistic son), it brought back memories of analogous real or meaningful experiences both of us had had: how it took a professional teacher for disabled children to get Isobel to start talking finally at age 2 and 1/2. The script is much better than the groans over lines manifesting emotion the reviewers would prefer to see repressed.\n\nSo recommended — as ever Maggie Smith steals the show except when suddenly Laura Linney is so stilly there. Reviewed by Dalya Alberge in The Guardian and by Sheila O’Malley for RogerEbert.com; and Peter Debruge for Variety.\n\nIt occurs to me I’ve provided enough matter for one night; I’ll come back later in the week with some favorites of Jim by Larkin, cummings, Auden, and Cavafy. And perhaps another summer film too.\n\nEllen\n\nBill Nighy as Mr Williams\n\nAimee Woods as Miss Harris (Living, 2022, Ishiguro and Nighy, the moving spirits)\n\nCillian Murphy as Oppenheimer presented as timeless, and Kitty Oppenheimer and Emily Blunt playing her as she grew older (Oppenheimer, 2023)\n\nThis is to defy the ludicrous pairing of the Greta Gertwig’s Barbie movie and Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer. Barbie is a doll with a toxic body for women (one of the contributors to eating disorders) with a look of joyful compliance on her face (any kind of sex, any kind of capitalism) Living is about the preciousness of life however poignant and inadequate and short-lasting our moments of joy. I’m combining Oppenheimer with this relatively recent film, Living, screenplay writer Kazuo Ishiguro, starring Bill Nighy. Living is now available streaming. They are linked because Ishiguro is Japanese-British and a great deal of his deeply poignant tragic outlook comes from his having grown up in a Japan upon which these atom bombs were leased, and having seen the horrific damage radiation and the Promethean explosion caused); Ikiru is a Japanese product.\n\nI invite others to make these your pair for returning to going out to the movies this week and the still real pleasures of streaming from home.\n\n***********************************************************\n\nTom Burke as the failed writer who helps Mr Williams not to be robbed and to live a little in a local working class spa\n\nLast night I re-watched Living — I was able to dwell deeply in it. It’s a redo of Kurosawa’s Ikiru — while the confrontational theme is the indifference of bureaucracy to citizens in need of a service or help (I know too much about that now from the dysfunctional passport agency), the deeper theme is life seen through the lens of a man’s coming death: his attempt to live and how poignant this is; his moving the bureaucracy to do one small good for a constituency, a playground for a group of working class women for their children.\n\nA series of links (I am crediting Russell Stone and Stephanie Simcox for all of these; they were presented during class at OLLI at Mason when the class had watched Living and then discussed the film together — and are sparing me the need to work to produce any longer remarks)\n\n1, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVo5kLt_-BU\n\n2. . https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/watch/-it-s-about-procrastination-actor-bill-nighy-on-the-award-winning-living-156252229997\n\n3. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVMS7X0YIOk\n\n4. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPTNYIyRk4U&t=933s\n\nAlso of interest:\n\n5 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzSf_bnqLoQ\n\nI think Living superior to Ikiru because the secondary people whom Mr Williams meets are far more personalized, individuated, come across as real complex people. In Kurosawa’s film, all the characters but the hero remain generalized types. I felt for Tom Burke as the anonymous gifted writer Mr Williams meets at a working class British spa. He conveyed the compassion and despair and acceptance of life the movie intended.\n\n***************************\n\nThis afternoon I saw Oppenheimer. Here are two excellent documentaries you can accompany the film with (for context). First, an outline of the story in this review:\n\nhttps://tinyurl.com/y9t4sctf\n\nOn YouTube To end all war: Oppenheimer and the Atomic Bomb — is truly worth it, 1 hour and one half — includes how the US govt hounded him when he tried to control the use of this bomb. I don’t know who has the power to do this but someone has blocked my transfer of the YouTube video from YouTube to this site. I can’t even use the link as that produces a black box. The link here will get you to the right page. It’s the first video on top.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=To+end+all+war%3A+Oppenheimer+and+the+Atomic+Bomb+\n\nOppenheimer, the real story, 2023 documentary available at BritBox and on Prime Video, is also very good, more narrowly autobiographical.\n\nOn Nolan’s movie itself, my take:\n\nThe movie theater actually seemed to have a lot of people — not super-crowded but it did not seem empty. Two auditoriums for Oppenheimer, and one for Barbie and something else.\n\nGo see it, vote for it in effect.\n\nSo honest reaction. The first 20 minutes — very irritating. I almost left but that I am in this movie course and so should sit there for the sake of the class and hoped-for discussion to come. Ridiculously unreal conversations emphasizing sarcasms; conversation is not a trading of jeering barbs except if you want to provoke laughter in a movie-house from the inane. But then the story kicked in. Just seen it the one time so unaware when this started.\n\nWhen the riveting story matter of the hounding of Oppenheimer in this small closed room began and alternated with more than one time line, I was pulled in. Nolan used color to try to indicate closer to the present but he was not consistent. That the movie is meant to be seen more than once is shown by how at the close we revert in memory (and with brief flashbacks) to what we didn’t realize was prime fodder for this “closed hearing.” For example, what did Oppenheimer talk with Einstein about while Lewis Strauss became enraged as he felt snubbed. I have not read American Prometheus and it strikes me this is one of those films where there is an interaction between book and film.\n\nSo let me move to what’s important: it is vindication of Oppenheimer. If you knew only vaguely that he was persecuted (as was his Russian counterpart, another of these “geniuses”), now you know his life story, the 1930s experience of communism-socialism (the film is too careful here and afraid to show truly how there was an American communist party supporting the Spanish republicans), Oppenheimer’s first mistress (gratuitous embarrassing nakedness) and then back and forth, not always easy to follow how the Manhattan project emerged. Full disclosure: when I was a child my father would tell me what an evil man was Edward Teller, profoundly obtuse about what nuclear bombs could do. Emily Blunt is terrific in her part; Branagh gets to pay Nils Bor — a tremendous compliment. I know many of the names because of years of reading Feynman’s “Los Alamos from Below” — he was very much a junior person. I admit getting a great kick out of picking out the actor playing those drums — dressed up like a young Feynman — Feynman did play those drums as the first test went off. He was a socially awkward nervous man and this part of his way of participating in social life.\n\nI thought the final ending through maybe not historical true, where all characters get together to expose Stuart Lewis very effective, but wrong-headed the way US movies can be — it was the situation — the McCarthyite era that Lewis exploited.\n\nThere are some important matters left out of the film: ought the US to have dropped the first bomb; should the allies have tried to persuade the Japanese these were horrifically deadly bombs? could we have. More realistically ought we to have dropped the 2nd within 3 days, giving the Japanese so little time to respond to the first. Also how devastating are the deadly results of radiation. I have some links in the comments to discussions of these issues.\n\nCillian Murphy’s career should be made (if it hasn’t been already) — except he is not a glamorous male icon. Ditto Emily Blunt.\n\nDon’t miss it.\n\nFun for me was to spot the actor playing Richard Feynman. I taught his Surely You’re Joking, Mr Feynman! and What Do You Care What Other People Think! in a course called Advanced Writing on the Natural Science and Tech at least 33 times; the latter includes his ironic (hilarious and serious) “Los Alamos from Below,” where he is a “low person” but there and yes he played the bongo drums frequently and played them through the first denotation of the atomic bomb. The actor’s hair and dress recalled Feynman. Feynman did write separately and seriously about the dangers of these nuclear bombs, but (unlike Oppenheimer) he denied feeling guilt.\n\nFor the New Statesman, Pippa Bailey wrote a positive review dwelling on the artistic techniques, uses of color and black-and-white to reveal two perspectives across the film: Oppenheimer’s Tormented Soul. Manohla Dargis also writes fully and intelligently about the film as art and story: A Man for Our Time.\n\nThe first gadget:\n\nIt seems to me crucially important as many people as possible see at least the first documentary as we hear Putin and Biden (more quietly) go to it, implicitly threaten one another with (in Biden’s case now multi-cluster bombs) and Putin modern nuclear weapons. That would certainly end all wars. See below Amy Goodman’s interviews with historians of this project (in the comments), and our nuclear age: omitted from the film is any serious consideration of the effects of radiation and an alternative consideration of where the US should have used these bombs.\n\nEllen\n\nBruno, the irresistible son (Enzo Staiola)\n\nAntonio Ricci (Lamberto Maggiorani), his desperate father lands a job (Bicycle Thieves)\n\nSilvana (Silvana Mangano), one of two central heroines rice workers\n\nFrancesca (Doris Dowling), her rival & friend\n\nA young Vittorio Gassman, tremendously gifted man (Bitter Rice)\n\nFriends and readers,\n\nYou owe this blog review to my observing that coming this fall, there will be two movie courses I know I’ll love at OLLI at AU (under headers like “moral and gender studies”) and one I’m taking just now at OLLI at Mason (less pretentious but still recent) fine movies. To my also noticing that Susan Bordo’s substack newsletter endorsing with grandiose language a second movie just made from Nabokov’s pornographic Lolita (the latest by Adrian Lyne, who characteristically makes movies with “queers” the vulnerable victim). Both films are violent pornography targeting women, from a book where an author (Nabokov) exploits the use of irony to encourage his audience to revel in sado-masochism and cruelty to women. Third, the resounding success of Succession: about as vicious a set of capitalist puppets as one can find (with the kick how they make fun of others, and subtextually exposing “weakness”).\n\nSomewhere some place here on the Internet someone ought to be pointing to actual great, good, nobly moral films. I studied and taught these as part of my Italian Novels of the 20th century course this past spring, but they transcend their particular origin while remaining firmly products of the post WW2 era.\n\nBriefly, Italian neo-realistic films made between 1946 and sometime in the 1970s. There are recognized 7 indisputable masterpieces of this subgenre in Italian, of which Bicycles Thieves is one. What they share: a mode of visual storytelling such that the cameras are set into a location of ordinary scenic reality, be it city really extant or country, or places – apartment houses, clubs – where ordinary people live, work, play. The people of the story are impoverished, desperately deprived which we see them every day coping with; our characters who we are to care intensely about are in some kind of crisis – and the way the situation is portrayed the viewer is made to imagine reality does not have to be this way: Rossellini Open City, Rome (Anna Magnani); Paisan Germany Year Zero (1946); 2 more by Di Sica, Shoeshine, and Umberto D (the 1st about children, the second people needing their pension); Visconti’s The Earth Trembles. A not quite forgotten equivalent, pushed to the side because by an open communist, using box office stars and film noir techniques, Giuseppe De Santis, Bitter Rice (Riso Amaro) about women rice field workers; also forgotten is a central woman screenplay writer for all many of these, Suso Cecchi d’Amico.\n\nThese have their origins in the 1930s, in the US in King Vidor Our Daily Bread, in Italy in the 1930s where there was no tightly controlled single govt (as in Germany) so class conflict was centrally on the agenda, and a number of central people in the Neo-realistic films got their start in Mussolini’s theaters; France with Jean Renoir (coming out of German Expressionism); UK so complicated to discuss (the class system upheld still ) and US too sad (the intransigent anti-socialist McCarthy era) so all we’ve got at the time is William Wyler (remember The Ox-bow Incident) and Frank Capra, Marty and Pawnbroker. In England in the 1950s, a few unforgettable ones are made where ironic deep rebellion is central: The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner, This Sporting Life, Room at the Top, A Touch of Honey (again just one by a woman allowed in). From perspective of literary people this kind of cinema in Italy is 1890s verismo novels ( which you may catch in Operas like Mascagni’s Cavalleria Rusticano and Leoncavallo’s Pagliacci). For England and the US short realistic novellas and plays (Angry Young Men type or very sad). The Soviet school of cinema in the early 20th century influenced these 20 years of films. Montage invented, juxtaposition.\n\nI could stop here and just cite two wonderful video discussions. Neorealistic films: Mark Shiel, Life as It is:\n\nJust on Bitter Rice: Brian Berry\n\n************\n\nBut I’ll include a couple of paragraphs each: Some have described The Bicycle Thieves and others of the famous seven as dramas of loneliness, of isolation. Whether it be that Antonio is tricked by a group of bicycle thieves, or himself set upon a community who defends the bicycle thief or attack him for stealing one of theirs, he is ever alone. Amid the worst thing of all: anonymous crowds. We are so used to it we don’t think about it – the rehearsal of a play or entertainment in the same spot a political meeting is held. Repeated disjunctions between the image we see and what is asserted about it. The point endlessly is social reform, a regeneration of a sense of self – as in Carlo Levi’s argument for eradicating fascism from Italy and set up a genuinely socialist egalitarian society, the basis must be self-esteem for all. That you have the right to be indignant, to fight for rights for rights. The one hopeful note is the boy, his son, better than him at recognizing absurdity, at sticking to a task, at sheer loving.\n\nThe film asks the question of what is a hero? It’s anti-Italian state in all its forms. Dramatizing sports (very popular) but also gambling and fortune telling. Camerini in the 30s depicted the depression, unusual but not forbidden altogether, using inexperienced actors, improvisation, and in later years Camerini learned to talk of his use of montage – stills following stills. The story element not upper class. It also as far as it dares exposes the uselessness, meagreness of the Catholic church’s endeavors to function as a charitable space within a community.\n\nBicycle Thieves shows a communal tragedy. Music is very evocative – in many of these films the musical paratexts and themes are central to part o their effect: they repeat and repeat. Are accused of sentimentality – maybe to the super-rich it is despicable sentimental to care about the troubles of others but I daresay that is not true of our own. The American Everyone’s Protest Novel is sentimental.\n\nRead Marilyn Fabe’s Closely Watched Films, Chapter 6: Bicycle Thieves (you must scroll down and click to enlarge)\n\n************\n\nBerry suggested Bitter Rice combined the techniques and outlook of neo-realism with highly melodramatic uses of film noir (especially at film’s end in the granary) – dark and light imagery. The presence of box office stars also skews it so we get highly theatrical presentations – the death by hanging from a hook of Walter (Vittorio Gassman), the PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) of Silvana after she’s been raped, led to shoot people, betray the other rice workers that leads to her suicide by jumping from the high top of a watchtower. Berry talks of 2 romances, but I fail to see how Walter’s behavior to either woman can be seen as romantic: the old myth of women attracted to vicious men is operative in this film. Ralph Vallone as Marlo, a brother type.\n\nAmong the many feminocentric (before the word existed) motifs of the film is women’s friendships, women as a support network for one another – conversations about things other than men. It passes the Bechtel test before Bechtel was born. Women with babies. The central couple of the film are Francesca and Silvana – we have a use of announcer for over-voice. The film expands our geographical temporal understanding of Italian realities.\n\nOn Silvana Mangano. To make a somewhat respectable career, she was somewhat careful what roles she took, and never became as famous or rich as she could have. This one of her early key remembered films. She also married the director and helped his career -– de Laurentis. As a committed Giuseppe de Santis was determined to expose the false myths about women as producers of food (that was the second essay I sent – a Song of Protest). Rice workers had a reputation for militancy. Silvana dressed to evoke Rita Hayworth (remember the poster poor Antonio in Bicycle Thieves was putting up so badly was of Rita Hayworth).\n\nBitter Rice evokes a connection between the fecund female body and the landscape — this kind of association is a throwback, refusing to acknowledge independent individual action the way men are granted, she is not an animal. To De Santis credit the film is not picturesque, not sentimental; you redeem yourself by working; fighting over rules against non-union people are part of the reality. Silvana reads photo novels, dances American style dances (her mother was English); she is aspirational, moody irritable – all this sets her apart and makes her friendly with Francesca also an outsider.\n\nRead Pasquale Ianone: A Field In Italy\n\nUnlike Bicycle Thieves, Bitter Rice was excluded from chief festivals, criticized heavily as left-wing propaganda, nonetheless it made its way as proletarian romance, 5th highest grossing film in Italy 1949-50; NYTimes critic liked its plainness and directness. Another essays about its direct Italian context and defiance of fascist stereotypes show it was meant to expose the pressure women into becoming work horses, mothers as if that would make them powerful and happy.\n\n***************************\n\nAnd now I have for a while concluded all the blogs I wanted to make out of the wonderful course I taught this spring, which matter I will do again, but with a different set of books & films from the era.\n\nThe women returning to their shacks, working, laughing in the wet and rain\n\nSeeking the stolen bicycle in the downpour\n\nEllen\n\nYoung Phineas (Donal McCann) in Parliament, trying to speak … (1974 BBC Pallisers, scripted Simon Raven)\n\nDear friends and readers,\n\nI seem never to tire of doing talks for the Every-Other-Week Trollope Society group (physically located, centered in London). This time I covered Chapter 14-26 of Phineas Finn: You can find the transcript in two places. First just alone, by itself, A academia.edu: “Words for Sale”; then on the Trollope Society London (website) “Words for Sale”, linked to the original illustrations by Sir John Millais, the text itself, and then uniquely (it’s nowhere else on the Internet), a video of the talk I gave\n\nThe theme I traced through the intersections of the dramatized scenes of love and politics as we watch Phineas Finn and Lady Laura Standish (then Kennedy) slowly mature is that of speech, talk, words, the content and meaning of what characters say to one another, and, just as important, what they omit to say, what they are silent about but whose realities left unarticulated everyone who understands what’s happening knows. I began with the two brilliantly astonishing scenes of Phineas at first try hard as he might fail to talk, and then fail to talk to any purpose. He is learning his trade of in the hard give-and-take situation of parliamentary debate. I then turned to how this theme is working out in the earliest disillusioning scenes of Lady Laura’s marriage, and her attempt to bring her violent brother, Chiltern, and their wealthy cousin, Violet Effingham together to become man and wife.\n\nIn my text I provide transcripts of two scenes in the Pallisers which correspond to and shed light on what is not said in Trollope’s text, and a third mostly wholly invented scene of Phineas come to the police station after his landlord, Mr Bunce, has been arrested and jailed for demonstrating for the secret ballot (put down by an irritated policeman to his trying to reach the arm of his admired radical politician, Mr Turnbull).\n\n**********************************\n\nCanvassing for voters — Frontispiece for Ralph the Heir (illustrator Francis A Fraser)\n\nI want also briefly to couple Phineas Finn with Trollope’s Ralph the Heir, which a group of friends and readers of Trollope recently read on TrollopeandhisContemporaries, a listserv community at groups. Both are highly original in the frank and perceptive way they present politics as a social experience, as a job someone undertakes to obtain power by a place in Parliament amid a working party (then the conservatives or Tories versus the liberal Whigs). The angle taken in Phineas Finn is that of an aspiring young man, Catholic Irish, who has a conscience but also means to make a good living and live among the political and social elite of England (so he must not just get a seat, but take office when his party is in power). Phineas is both idealistic and realistic, but he never doubts the worth or value of what he is doing.\n\nIn Ralph the Heir, the value of political work, its effectiveness, and its central functioning place in any social order is doubted. Ralph the Heir was written 3-4 years after PF, after Trollope himself had run for Parliament for the borough of Beverley and been appalled and humiliated by the way the glib and corrupt (bribes used at crucial turning points) opponents conducted themselves — and defeated him. Trollope called Ralph the Heir his “worst” novel, and it is true, the depiction of young adult characters when in love, and the excusing of the complacent fatuous heir (as opposed to a rather noble cousin, excluded on grounds of his illegitimacy) and the continual harping exposure of the Newton family’s obsessive rivalries seen at their hottest in the older generation do not show Trollope at his best. But the chapters dramatizing all phases of an election, the delving into the performative thinking and acting of the candidates and campaign managers provides startling and for today still relevant and brilliant insight.\n\nBy contrast to Phineas Finn, in Ralph the Heir Trollope, through his characters’ experiences of an election and party life, suggests he does not believe in the power of a political organization or act to transform society for the better, and in his later fiction no longer believes in the power of fiction to do much good. It might entertain; it might not make things worse. There is nothing like Mr Monk’s idealistic noble letter on representation and the importance of a constituency in Ralph the Heir.\n\nThe sincere speech of the radical (socialist really) candidate, Ontario Moggs (for whom Trollope shows much sympathy) at a tavern\n\nThe two novels can be seen brought together beautifully in John Halperin’s Trollope and Politics: A study of the Pallisers and others, which, despite the subtitle, rightly takes for its central long analysis, Ralph the Heir. What makes most readers turn to Halperin’s book as a whole is how lucid he is, how well-informed about parliamentary procedures, and how he supplies (speculatively of course) real life individuals as the source of many of Trollope’s portraits. In his chapters on Phineas Finn and Phineas Redux (as one long book in two parts) he cites a persuasive candidate for Phineas Finn, the character. John McCourt’s Writing the Frontier: Anthony Trollope between Britain and Ireland supplies three other possibilities and probably gives a much fairer account of its Anglo-Irish politics.\n\nIn his long chapter on Ralph the Heir Halperin makes the case that Trollope was intensely angry after Beverly (deeply disappointed by the political world), and to me he brings out that politics in the narrow (getting into power and elected, passing legislation) and the broader sense (how should states be organized? what are good norms? an ideology of is social life? what is meant by terms like representation) is central to all of Trollope’s oeuvre. On this novel specifically, he comes close to saying Sir Thomas Underwood, by far the most seriously meant and interesting character in Trollope’s book, a partly failed barrister, and independent or better yet solitary scholar working on his own book on Sir Francis Bacon, is a portrait of Trollope himself in depression and anger and inward solitariness. Trollope pours himself into many of his characters, in this novel Ontario Moggs is partly a portrait of Trollope too — as an outsider, easily out-maneuvered. I add so is Phineas Trollope (and I suggest this in my above talk and paper).\n\nThis is not the place to go over the details either of PF or Ralph the Heir. I wrote a full blog here on Phineas Finn after I finished teaching it a few years ago as an “uprooted person” (in Simon Weil’s sense) as well as an Irish member. While we were reading Ralph the Heir, I wrote many postings — sometimes one a day, one or more for each of its chapters, and you may find them in the archives of TrollopeandHisContemporaries, typing into the search engine “Ralph the Heir.” It’s a wonderfully alive, vivid performance, the characters feel so close to the reader, that you can find yourself unexpectedly moved and/or gripped or sharply amused by its ironies. Halperin is right about it as autofiction: it can help you understand the autobiographical roots of parallel scenes written by Trollope, closely similar illustrations by Millais (in content and feel) and plot-turns and characters in Orley Farm.\n\nThis by Millais of Lucius Mason (Orley Farm) after he realizes he is not the heir to Orley Farm could be several characters in other of Trollope’s novels, but in Ralph the Heir, especially Ralph the disinherited.\n\nYou are also missing out on some of Trollope’s shrewdest and thought-provoking depictions of politics if you neglect it.\n\nThe yearning Moggs writing a letter — he also writes his own speeches\n\nEllen\n\n1963 Tom Jones: Tom (Albert Finney), Sophia (Susannah York) — Tony Richardson & Tom Osborne (see blog)\n\n1997 Tom Jones Fielding keeping count of characters passing by every which way (John Sessions) — Simon Burke & Metin Huseyin (see blog)\n\n2023 Tom Jones Tom (Solly McLeod) and his mother, Bridget Allworthy (Felicity Montagu) overcome as they recognize one another as mother and son — Gwyneth Hughes and Georgia Parris (blog just below)\n\nTom: Can a man ever be a gentleman if he doesn’t know who his father is?\n\nAunt Bridget: Kindness and good conduct make a true gentleman …\n\nDear friends and readers — and movie watchers,\n\nI’ve been having this deeply pleasurable time watching all three Tom Jones movies in a row, then separately, and then returning to the book, which I taught at both OLLIs in 2015, and then watching them all over again. Reading Osborne’s screenplay! all of which I’ve also written many blogs about (here at Ellen and Jim, there at Austen Reveries, and one paper at academia.edu.) Not to omit a 10 page paper long ago (1966, long lost sight of) as an undergraduate on the plot-design and introductory ironic chapters!\n\nNot to worry, this is not going to be another blow-by-blow account. Nowadays I don’t need to do that because of all the recaps on the Internet, and especially when it’s the tone and ideas/themes figured forth that matter rather than the literal happenings (though these count too). I’ve found 4 very thorough recaps for you. What these do not have and I’ve found little evidence for on popular sites is any knowledge of Henry Fielding’s book.\n\nThe points I want to make about the first two movies follow in block form; the third I expatiate a bit.\n\nIn 1963 the daring highly original independent artist, Tony Richardson, together with the playwright, John Osborne, one of those angry young men who wrote all male-centered plays, created a highly memorable striking 2 hours and 8 minutes of brilliant film making for the cinema.\n\nUnder the impression the book is this good-natured and benign comedy (however savage in action, amoral in norms, coolly detached when it comes to poetic justice), distanced by a narrator, they elected to imitate film types — so we get speeding up and antics as if this were silent film with comical silent film type music. They opted (perhaps unconsciously) to make sex a hilarious joke (this is a male film where rape is a kind of joke, as it is in Fielding’s book). Subversive mischief is the feel of the whole thing. No one even now who ever sees the film can forget the hunt (first time ever done on film), the intensely sensual eating at one another of Tom and Mrs Waters (aka Jenny Jones [Joyce Redman) thought to be his mother at that moment. Both the 1997 and 2023 serials include an imitation of both.\n\nThe terrified much put-upon Partridge (the unforgettable Jack MacGowan — the movie has a number of the Ealing comedy regulars in it) trying to hold up Tom on the road\n\nThe characters remain at a distance from us, like puppets occasionally coming alive for intensities of emotion, both joy and exhilarated varieties. The film is brought to an end suddenly by replacing the last quarter of the novel with an imitation of Gay’s Beggar’s Opera, where Tom as Macheath comes near hanging, and he and Sophia finally fall into one another arms.\n\nNow and again Osborne’s screenplay has appercus about the action, humane nature, life that are worth a serious read and do show an understanding of Fielding’s work.\n\nI recommend studying the published screenplay which comes with 200 stills in black-and-white picked and judiciously scattered by Robert Hughes so as to repeat something of the experience with some understanding of what this is about that you imagine you are having in the movie-theater.\n\n************************************************\n\nIn 1997 one of the finest of the BBC screenplay writers, Simon Burke, and the thoroughly professional director, Metin Huseyin, decided to make a paean to Fielding and his book, to truly faithfully put onto the screen a translation of as much of the book as they could, making Fielding a presence in the film as narrator, voice-over, traffic director, ironic commentator.\n\nI find it superior to either of the other two in conveying the complex and contradictory meanings of the book. The serial is 5 hours long and so the only one which can do justice to the tangled series of diabolical conspiracies (however burlesquely done) that come near to destroying Tom for real. The mood is comical melodrama for the characters as they come and go (however Polonius like this sounds). They’ve altered the frat boy forgiven perspective of the book: this is a pro-active Sophia (Samantha Morton), accompanied by an actively involved wry Honor (Kathy Burke inimitable. risking her job to do the right thing). Sophia is an overt feminist – she will not marry Tom until he proves himself faithful for two years (and we see in the fast forward of two small children, that he was made to so wait). The film-makers bring in the original allusions more: Mrs Waters (Camille Couduri) half-naked following Tom is a leering Eurydice and he a bewildered Orpheus as in the book.\n\nNote how different is the meeting of Tom (Max Beasley) and Partridge (Ron Cook) on the road — they hug frantically as long-lost father and son\n\nNow the characters are allowed to come up close to us as people: they considerably softened Mr Allworthy so that Benjamin Whitlow continually shows love, forgiveness, fondness for Tom, appreciation of him until Tom is betrayed by his own over-emotionalism (we are expected to feel in the film and also the book) upon Mr Allworthy’s recovery. Mrs Bridget (Tessa Peake-Jones) is very fond of Tom throughout; she tells him it’s necessary to do more than be virtuous; one must appear so. Here the women are not slathering all over Tom. I can’t speak too highly of Frances de la Tour as Aunt Western (crazed for status, money, luxury), Lindsay Duncan as Lady Bellaston, turned into a fiendish over-sexed termagant (a Madame de Merteuil), with Peter Capaldi as stalking rapist also roused by indignation, jealousy. The ending here resembles Les Liaisons Dangereuses as they attempt to press-gang, humiliate, frame, drive Tom into murder.\n\nThey take the film’s social criticism of the society at the time seriously, have a wider range of application (like the Jacobite war), even if at the end the Team Tom has formed and saves Tom out of gratitude. Tom quietly takes charge of himself by the end of the third episode and is saving Nancy, refusing promiscuous sex (realizing how degraded he’s become). It’s also hilariously funny as the outward antics show the good characters hysterically trying to escape the nooses the bad characters set up for them, with people jumping out of windows. There are two spontaneous duels: Brian Blessed magnificent as Western simply shoots Fellamar – why bother with swords?\n\nIt’s a very satisfying film. Watch it over and over.\n\nSophia and Tom at the piano, Squire Western singing along … a joyous moment\n\n*****************************************\n\nAnd so we come to our newest entry:\n\nGwyneth Hughes and Georgia Parris’s iteration is outstanding for having switched the perspective to that of a woman: our narrator is now Sophia (Sophia Wilde), brought over from Jamaica as the child of an enslaved black woman Squire Western impregnated (actually named! Beneba!) because the old man, Western (Alun Armstrong become a weakly affectionate lonely man) needs an heir and some hope in the form of a next generation. She speaks in the tone of deep memory; she organizes the events in the sequence she tells them so that she has equal time.\n\nBoth Tom and Sophia are then are outcasts brought tenuously into the families now. Gwyneth Hughes wrote Miss Austen Regrets and if you follow her career has a record of turning masculinized works into women-centered ones with a genuinely female POV dominating (see my blog on her Five Days). Hughes’s Aunt Western (Shirley Henderson) says she never married and honestly doesn’t see why women should; she also hilariously and also frankly worries over the state of Sophia’s hair when her black lady’s maid, Honor, is not there to make it look polished or styled. Pearl Mackie as Honor is made to do a reprise of Kathy Burke only now the two women (Sophie and Honor) become equals and friends.\n\nSneaking out to go on the road after Tom and to London to find the (false) safety of Lady Bellaston (played by the enormously tall and statuesque Hannah Waddington) and “Aunt” Harriet (Tamzin Merchant who in the book is Sophia’s cousin, Tamzin Merchant) who flees Mr Fitzpatrick far less frantically than in the book where his violence is rightly taken seriously.\n\nThe new important emphasis is an increase of moral gravitas for this Tom: Solly McLeod evidences a tender gravity towards Sophia and an overt selfless kindness throughout — that is indeed what makes him a gentleman. In this film he worries about this as no Tom has before him. Well before he has to be stopped jumping into women’s beds; he hates writing the lying letter to Lady Bellaston as “it’s ugly.” Told by Black George that George stole the 500£ Mr Allworthy (James Fleet, playing his usual self-deprecating way) meant for Tom, and that he used it to build a new house for his family, Tom says he is glad to have been of use. The actor may have been chosen because he’s taller than Waddington (so their liaison will not seem grotesque), but he is no macho male (not a body-built like Sam Heughan aka Jamie from Outlander), and worries about hurting other people’s feelings. He is not so much imprudent (the incident of the drunkenness after Mr Allworthy recovers from an illness is omitted) but rather not looking out for himself: unsuspicious is the note hit. Partridge (Daniel Rigby) here becomes a hanger-on as he does not in the other versions (Fielding’s included) because Tom does have a mind of his own — the comedy comes from this Partridge’s yearning to return home.\n\nClose up we see there is no harm in the Squire and his sister\n\nThe use of a female narrator and female POV just transforms it. Repeatedly events we saw from a particular’s POV or Fielding’s are now one of these women. Armstrong as Western keeps muttering about “the women in this family,” but in this film duels are seen as ridiculous things men do. When Tom is having sex with Mrs Waters at Upton, our POV is that of Sophia and Honor listening from the other side. When Fitzpatrick interrupts Tom and Mrs Waters, our POV is that of Mrs Waters ostentatiously (to us) pretending to be eager and waiting patiently for Fitzpatrick all this while. Again and again the mad-dog violent sexual predator is made to seem silly but also mortally dangerous and not to be trusted. The men are seen through immediately (that Mr Fitzpatrick has taken bribes); the women enigmatic. When Tom despairs in prison upon learning he may have fucked his mother, his words have a plangency rarely projected by men.\n\nSophie Wilde is of course central too; she is wise beyond her years — the black actress moves into this princess role so gracefully — in one sequence she sings a lovely 18th century sounding song. Perhaps she is too without bitter memories (Georgiana Lambe in the latest Sanditon is more realistic this way), too trusting. This film is not color blind; it means to be color conscious but they did not want to register too closely the horrors of enslavement this pastoral skirts.\n\nTom and Sophia dancing\n\nAll the characters want to return home, and home is not Jamaica, or a particular house, but a yearning to escape individual trouble and vexation. It is a funny at times, but in a genuinely more benevolent way than the previous. The jokes are not aggressive (Partridge echoes Pistol from Shakespeare: “Speak or die!”), no one mocks anyone but Bellaston, Fellamar (Tom Durrand Pritchard) and the gloating spiteful Blifil (James Wilbraham) whom poetic justice leaves with in the city (at a gothic like door) with the cold ambitious Lady Bellaston.\n\nThey are for the countryside, anti-artifice, and this links the film back to the 2007 Mansfield Park by Maggie Waddie — the ending of both is closely similar. A picnic wedding with a beautiful dance between our hero and heroine and then circle dancing of all as they look forward to peaceful future in this haven of Paradise Hall where once Blifil is ejected (presented as twisted by his envy and jealousy over everyone’s deep love for Tom, but especially his mother) all are safe, stable, contented. We are told Mrs Waters (Susannah Fielding) and Mrs Fitzgerald got on quite well together and never missed Mr F with his crazed sexual predation and violent turn for duels. Honor marries a black inn-keeper and becomes a pub-landlady nearby.\n\nI admit this is not a film where returning to Fielding’s book will do you much good if you want to deepen your understanding of what has given rise to the film. This anti-competitive theme is not taken from Fielding’s book but is a reaction to our world today. No one wants to hustle for gigs. The palette of the movie is pastoral repeatedly — mostly rich autumn colors. Frances Grey as Mrs Miller would not be out of place in the BBC Cranford.\n\nJames Fleet as Squire Allworthy sheltering under a tree in the landscape\n\nEllen\n\nBurt Lancaster as Don Fabrizio Corbera, Prince of Salina (from Il Gattopardo, Lucino Visconti, 1963)\n\nDear friends and readers,\n\nThis book represents a complete turnabout for me, and twice: I started the term regretting that I had chosen this book as not having enough story to it, as too reactionary, maybe static, and, before it was time to discuss it with the class, I fell in love with it as quietly subtly intensely active (though the most overt actions, the battles are off-stage), profound in its understanding of how politics works, encompassing in an epitomizing way of the history and culture of history from well before to well after the Risorgimento, but centering on one of its central phases, Garibaldi’s invasion of Sicily. I had partly been influenced by my first watching of the film in the American version (cut down, and dubbed by others, except for Lancaster’s voice, which was his own), which on first blush (I now think I was so tired), I found so flat and stilted; but again, before it was time to discuss the film with the class, I had watched the whole of the Italian version (with all speaking Italian except Lancaster, and here he was dubbed), 3 hours and 40 minutes and was mesmerized, deeply affected. In fact I watched it twice, and then four different features about it, Visconti, Lancaster, the book.\n\nLampedusa was a great poet whose work emerges from a kind of exile imposed on himself; his novel as great historical novel which while presenting a version of the Risorgimento which many would say is wholly inadequate and reactionary, nonetheless stands up to scrutiny because of the scepticism and irony with which just about everything is viewed, the main character’s real intelligence and insight into everyone he meets, and his essential kindly humanity. It is often not mentioned that he fought in World War Two; he did live a life apart immersed in literary and art study, but he also experienced much of life — like Italo Calvino’s nun who goes nowhere. He presided over the decay and loss of his family estate, watched the world lurch through changes from the opening of the century to a decade after World War Two.\n\nIt is partly an autobiographical book because the prince is based on Lampedusa’s real great-grandfather, a learned, solitary (despite being surrounded by people), non-professional scientist when there was no such thing as a scientific profession and a rentier; he devoted himself to astronomy. Fabrizio is the book as he is the movie: his quiet, melancholic, ironic self fills its spaces; fundamentally he’s alienated from his society while belonging utterly to it – he belongs nowhere and is at its core. He lives just outside the rough and tumble of the world while being intensely aware of how it works. The prince’s nephew, Tancredi, is partly based on Lampedusa’s own nephew (minus the cold callowness) — his nephew has today turned one of the castles in the book into a tourist house, set in a beautiful landscape.\n\nWhat we see in our book is a specific phase of the risorgimento: how it was experienced in the early 1860s and at and around Palermo. The book opens with our characters being told of the military come, Garibaldi at the head winning again and again, everywhere, sometimes fighting fiercely, others being welcomed in a celebratory spirit (Naples). Garibaldi is the great absent-presence of this book. He is never on stage but we hear about him all the time – Scott is a lot kinder and brings his world historical characters on stage, but Scott is not such a conservative as Lampedusa who didn’t want to dramatize Garibaldi as his presence would have contradicted the prince’s idea that all revolutions do is replace an old corrupt order with a new one.\n\nI find the wikipedia article provides an excellent synopsis and phase-by-phase plot-summary. This is well put:\n\nThe novel is the story of Don Fabrizio Corbera, Prince of Salina,[3] a 19th-century Sicilian nobleman caught in the midst of civil war and revolution. As a result of political upheaval, the prince’s position in the island’s class system is eroded by newly-moneyed peasants and “shabby minor gentry.” As the novel progresses, the Prince is forced to choose between upholding the continuity of upper class values, and breaking tradition to secure the continuity of his family’s influence. A central theme of the story is the struggle between mortality and decay (death, fading of beauty, fading of memories, change of political system, false relics, etc.), and abstraction and eternity (the prince’s love for the stars, continuity and the resilience of the Sicilian people). In a letter to a friend, the author notes: “Be careful: the dog Bendicò is a very important character and is almost the key to the novel”. This heraldic emblem is the key to destruction, in the sense that ruin comes even to the dog.”\n\nJeffrey Meyers’s literary close reading in the Italian Quarterly is also suggestive: The Leopard is a richly symbolic novel from the first scene during the Rosary to the final moment when the carcass of Bendicò is flung out the window. The symbols form two categories: there are those which emerge and disappear only to be found later in a somewhat varied form, like a pattern of dolphins leaping through the sea. These may be called recurrent symbols, which only grow to their fullest meaning toward the end of the book, and through their very expansion advance the theme of the novel. Through repetition and variation they function also as leitmotifs and thereby effect a structural unity. The eviscerated soldier, the stars, Sicily itself, and Bendicò are recurrent symbols, woven like threads into the fabric and texture of Lampedusa’s art.\n\nThe second mode of symbols are used more conventionally; they occur and evoke a higher meaning only once. But these static\n\nsymbols often appear in an expanded moment which allows their meanings to reverberate through the novel and foreshadow the future. Prophecy is used structurally to link the present with the future and to give an air of predestined inevitability to important actions. The most successful symbols in this group are the series of objets d’art which illustrate and prophesy the love of Tancredi and Angelica….”\n\nI love the houses, the wandering through the rooms of Tancredi and Angelica, how they get lost in the palace at Donnafugato, the highly ironic and despairing political scenes — even if the mayor wins he lies about the count so that it should be unanimous; the cry of anguish of the progressive man that the prince will do nothing for the immiserated poor; then the luxury and delicacy of the ball itself, finally how gently the prince died — how he wanted to go. The gentle comedy.\n\nI leave my reader to peruse the rest of these wikipedia articles (above, below, one on Lampedusa), and find and read the articles I cited in the comments\n\nLampedusa was motivated finally to write the book towards the very end of his life when he went to a literary fair and conference for the first time in many years and thought to himself I can do as well as these people – and of course felt he was coming to the end of his life – he was no longer well. He drove himself to finish it, and when he died, it had been rejected by a couple of the major Italian publishers. It’s sad to know he never knew of its publication nor the several short stories he wrote around the same time and readied for publication.\n\nThe initial reception was very mixed – to say the least. It was rejected and not until Eugenio Montale, a major poet, and Giorgio Bassani championed it, did it see the light of day as a book. Bassanio was not socialist and at one time was a fascist – so it was a political time-bomb. What happened was it sold phenomenally well. You can think of it as the Downton Abbey of its day.\n\nVery slowly since it has gained much respect as a poetic masterpiece, psychological study of a particular kind of man at place in time, as a historical novel set in 1860 in Palermo where all around the main action slaughters are going on, and fierce politics – overheard by our prince and brought as news by his nephew, Tancredi, and experienced as a plebiscite where there seem to be (astonishing) no contrary votes.\n\nIn a kind of touristy essay – by a man who visited the cemetery in Palermo where the Lampedusa family is buried after he had read the novel many years before and once again – Richard O’Mara remarks that the Mayor we meet, Calogero, as the prince half-predicts, did found a Mafioso organization which still exists because when the Americans came in with their ambiguous Marshall Plan, they handed out a number of central positions to Mafioso agents.\n\nThe famous highpoint of the ball: the prince dances with his coming daughter-in-law\n\nThe film too did not initially get the respect it should have — because it’s a costume drama, and had star types at the center. But the sheer popularity of it won out. As with Hollywood movies when it comes time to give out prizes, they shower second-rate movies that were phenomenal successes at the box office, but later as the movie shows sustaining power, gains an audience, the film critics who count look again — or look louder. Over the years, this long unusual film for its time, Il Gattopardo, been studied and found to be immensely rich in dialogues, events, details, cinematography, and depth of emotion. It is also gently funny: the specifics of many of the characters make us laugh while we feel for them. It was filmed entirely on location, and use was made of real buildings, real churches, the Sicilian landscape, monuments, sky.\n\nAgain wikipedia did real justice to it. Here are some of my notes:\n\nI was fully involved and discovered the movie to be (for 2 hours and 40 minutes) mostly a light comedy with melancholy undertones, with a simple story, focusing on the central male, the Prince played by Lancaster. He dominates the film and carries it — not an easy thing to do\n\nLancaster delivers a remarkable performance. The second star cast was Alan Delon and he speaks French so in neither version can you hear him. The one street battle scene (Garibaldi invades Sicily) is very well done, but at a distance and not long enough for the burden of meaning it’s asked to bear. The outlook is very anti-risorgimento with the political idea that the peasant world does not want to change; since we hardly see any we are not in a position to judge. The other idea that you have to permit change in order to keep things the same is acted out in an election presented in the film as useless. The class snobbery as in the book is not contradicted; there is no downstairs.\n\nThe scenes between the prince and a sort of hunting comrade and the middle mayor whose daughter, Angelica (Claudia Cardinale) the Prince’s nephew marries are among the best for understanding the characters and Visconti’s outlook (an aristocrat himself albeit a man of the left).\n\nBeyond that the filming of the places is remarkable and the last quarter the film devoted to a ball whose different phases have different symbolic resonances — it reminded me very much of the balls in Margaret Mitchell’s Gone With the Wind — we do glimpse that the nephew’s marriage is one of convenience, but as the inner life of his coming wife is downplayed and one of calculation — we don’t feel grief.\n\nI like this comment about the ending of both book and film by Randy Boyagoda:\n\nThe novel’s appeal could be attributed to its beautiful prose (obvious even in translation), to its languid pacing, and to how it unfolds the many layers of intrigue and fidelity within a family and between a family and the people around them. But it’s this moment–the beginning of the Prince’s decline, and its rationales and causes–that makes The Leopard more than just another underappreciated classic. It’s this moment that makes it speak to the kinds of concerns we each have to deal with these days in our personal, professional, and faith lives … There is far more at play in the Prince’s Donnafugata dilemma than obvious irony and poetic social justice. Taken in the context of the whole novel, it is a superb evocation of what it means to be a serious person out of step with one’s time … What matters in each of these situations is accepting that you need to act for the greater good while also accepting the permanent possibility of a Pyrrhic victory\n\nThe last glimpse of Fabrizio as he walks home in the dark\n\nEllen\n\nCliff top — Aliano, Italy, in Lucania region\n\nDear friends and readers,\n\nThere is no doubt in my mind that the favorite text — the one most liked, respected over this past year that I’ve taught has been Carlo Levi’s Christ Stopped at Eboli (published 1945). It’s common to call this wonderful meditative account of Levi’s time of forced exile at Grassano and then Gagliano a poetic masterpiece; it also provides a profound and empathetic explanation of how millions of people can become fascists, once again (alas) an important topic in our world today.\n\nI offered this more concise and simple description of it the last time I wrote of it here:\n\nIt’s an ethnographic and anthropological study. It covers the year he spent in internal exile — a peculiarly Italian form of imprisonment descending from the Roman period, where a person is cut off, exiled from his or her community, isolated in a remote spot and watched to keep him or her from any kind of political activity, news of the world he or she understands. (A number of the Jewish and socialist/communist literati in Italy were treated this way: Ginzburg’s memoir includes a couple of years in Abruzzi.) Carlo Levi may be said to have thoroughly internalized his exterior culture — he acts as physician (he was trained to be a doctor), paints (his vocation), writes, joins in tangentially — which culture during his sojourn expands to sympathize with these strange and victimized (for centuries) people he finds himself among, whom since the Northerners know little of them, he is determined to bring before the world of his readers (the book was written in 1946 after Mussolini fell from power).\n\nHis conclusion that these people live in a timeless realm they cannot be plucked from is shown to be inadequate by his own account: He repeats many times that things there do not have to be the way they are; a wide government program well funded, providing irrigation, changing the financial laws, redistributing land, education, would transform the habitus and its people who have been given no opportunity, no good choices (like the working class whites of the US), exploited by every group that has taken power over them, and the result has been seething just repressed destructive violence. (The lesson for our era is more direct in Carlo Levi’s book’s conclusions than the above books.) He compels our attention by the riveted and insightful nature of the chronological settling in and living alongside story he tells. His sister visits him at one point, and we see this world from her experienced sophisticated compassionate eyes she registers shock and horror at a majority of children suffering from malaria, insects, uneducated, dressed in rags, with no hope for a better future than unending hard farm work which barely supports them — and is not enough to pay the overlords demanded taxes.\n\nA detail from one of his embracingly beautiful depiction of the people of Lucania\n\n***************************************************\n\nSo let me go a little more into detail as it’s so relevant to our world today\n\nThe title of Levi’s book is a proverbial phrase often repeated by the local peasants and which `in their mouths may be no more than the expression of a hopeless feeling of inferiority. We are not Christians, we’re not human beings’. Levi explains its much deeper meaning: Eboli is `where the road and the railway leave the coast of Salerno and turn into the desolate reaches of Lucania. Christ never came this far, nor did time, nor the individual soul, nor hope, nor the relation of cause and effect, nor reason nor history’. Levi says in the second half, to begin reform you must begin to eradicate this idea they are inferior and their lives worth nothing. An intense empathy at the same time as he does not sentimentalize these people – he sees them out of clear sceptical disillusioned eyes – Levi mediates a gap between them and us. A new world cannot come from the plans or documents of a few enlightened men (and/or women).\n\nThe book sort of divides into two parts. Until about Chapters 12-13, we see him enter this hovel, what life with the widow is like, and get a series of portraits of fascist officials, then specific types (rather like Chaucer) of people doing specific jobs (postmaster, inspector, tax collector), all humanized, given psychological and social depth. The first half of the book might be described as his search for a place he can live with some hope of enacting his professions as a painter and now doctor. It takes two attempts: first he goes to live in a crumbling hospital-prison; then one of the upper class people in the village has a vacant three room building which can be turned into kitchen, bedroom, and studio, with a balcony. Levi then acquires a housekeeper and cook Giulia Venere, and settles in. But each step enables him to develop ideas about the place and people. We see the murderous (because so desperate) internecine family and frenemy politics, men who went to the America (mostly NYC) and having made a little money (almost inexplicably) come back to live in poverty once again – who they are and how they now live. Through the women whose children he cares for and a failed attempt to hire housekeeper and then successful one, he tells of the average lives of these women, almost perpetually pregnant, and most of the pregnancies not from husbands – gone away for years, many of their children dying, they too in their houses long hours of primitive tasks, the most important of which is food production.\n\nThe second half after he sets this up we get longer sections on history and politics, and some festivals he experiences, his own trip to the previous place he lived, home, his failed attempt to do something about the malaria. Levi here expatiates in compelling tales his political and philosophical point of view: we learn of the later 19th century wars of brigandage in southern rural Italy – a precursor in fascism. Though they had no political or philosophical POV Levi does adumbrate his political and philosophical point of view in his review of the wars of brigandage – a precursor in some ways to fascism, though they had no political or philosophical POV.\n\nI find the whole long section about bringandate extraordinary. I know few texts like it. Among the utterances in this section are the crazed ideas that he quotes people spouting; they remind me of the crazed ideas Trump manages to evoke from his “base” as it’s called. People saying things you just don’t know where to begin to try to convince them otherwise\n\nBasically he argues to have a real revolution one must break with the past. Italy never developed a full middle class bourgeoisie across the country; those who were middle class had developed through compromises with the upper classes – protectionism, rifling of state and taxpayers coffers; they absolutely excluded from any power working and lower middle class people. He was against notions of resistance; fundamental problems are too deep. This apparent passivity and unchangingness (which is what we find asserted in many reactionary and conservative books) is born of hopelessness and an inculcated sense of inferiority; what you have beneath that is a ferocity born of despair. His description of these people could describe Trump’s armed people on Jan 6th.\n\nHe also argues elsewhere (a book called Fear of Freedom) people are afraid of freedom; they fear liberty -this is very like Rousseau. Man is born free but everywhere in chains. To which a 19th century philosopher said this is to say sheep are born carnivorous and everywhere eat grass. A critique of western civilization – not to speak of tribal life. Religions seek certainty and stability in rituals and myths. Each life is an individual journey. Inherited codes and practices are only a kind of outer skin or protective layer – law, which must be reinterpreted over and over as circumstances and needs change.\n\nThe Risorgimento was basically the take over of all Italy by the form of government that had evolved in the north, in Turin and Piedmont and it wouldn’t do. It emerges from the Napoleonic take-over (invasion) of Italy which provoked the individual states and regions to go to war against the colonialist powers who had taken over Italy before Napoleon: Austria and France in the North, Venice itself over others, Spain in the south, the Ottoman empire, the south west: gradually after a series of wars, defeats and successes, until a culmination in the battles fought by Garibaldi, backed by the philosophy of Mazzini, and ideas of reform from Cavour, this Rising Again, took shape. One obstacle I’ve not yet mentioned was the Catholic Church and its grip on Rome; that was not broken until late in the 19th century.\n\nWhat he does in his one fiction and his memoirs and travel books is reveal the inner workings of a society as a sort of anthropological study with the aim ultimately of emancipating people – of course now you come for gov’t helps in health, infrastructure, education. But that’s not the heart of what needs to be transformed. He much admired Antonio Gramsci another complicated brilliant man who was not directly murdered in prisons but whose health and selfhood so destroyed (like Oscar Wilde) 3 years later he died at home. But more important is a politics of position. That is achieved by getting purchase on what people remember, what they think is their history, what they read … That is by education. It’s crucial to educate people to know and think (if you are determined to control them) what favors you – that is what all this banning of books and unashamed attempt to repress modern education in schools and colleges is about. Books which reveal the true history of enslavement in this country, the Jim Crow era (a regime of terrorism) are crucial to teach so as to enable people to know who they are – and also in forming identities. People are sheep. Films and books matter.\n\nThe old order is dead. The new order cannot yet be born. In this interregnum a variety of pathological symptoms arise — Gramsci — that is what Levi is showing us in southern Italy\n\nLevi’s book combines a people outside of History with Hope. He shows them being crashed into by History – in the form of the State – demanding taxes, conscription, its officers controlling people – but he sees hope of change\n\nFamilies have been dispersed, houses devastated, property destroyed, states overturned. If these ruins were only material the world would quickly go back to what it was. But the old sense of the family has been lost, the old sense of home has changed, the old sense of property no longer has the validity it once had, the old sense of the State has lost all power. And something deeper has changed in men’s souls, something which is difficult to define, but which is expressed unconsciously in every act, every word, every gesture: the very vision of the world, the sense of the relationship of people with each other, with things and with destiny [from another text by Levi written in 1944].\n\nHe is convinced history is of essential importance even if the average person cannot see this, pp 137-38 Shakespeare’s earliest plays are histories – Wars of the Roses, government’s being overturned, tyrants emerging – he does not defend brigandage – of course not9 – but we need to understand it. One problem with the Jan 6th hearings is the kinds of questions people are allowed to ask in modern courts of law do not elicit from the answerers what we would like truly to know about them. Levi can find food for thought in the classics because he reads them – as it were aright. On p 141 we see him considering Virgil’s Aeneid not as it’s usually discussed but to bring out what Virgil is silent about.. Very violent societies – state (Trollope says) is that level of organization which has the monopoly on violence in any given area – that’s neutral but you can have different ways of electing and choosing that state. Blind urges to destruction gets us nowhere (that is what we are seeing the present GOP under Trump attempting today).\n\nIn a museum in Matera — a woman and children\n\nThere is much to entertain too. Funny stories: two men forbidden to carry on their relationship as resisters leave bowls of spaghetti out in a specific place for one another so they can eat the same meal at the same time. A story of resilience. There are poignant retellings of womens’ lives vis-à-vis their children. When he makes a serious attempt to get the local authorities to do something about the malaria, his license to practice is taken away. He submits a plan that worked in Grassano, and the Gagliano mayor forbids him to practice. This prohibition does enrage and rouse the people. At least one man dies directly as a result of his not being able to help him; another man has a ruptured appendix and every effort is made by his brother and Levi to get Levi to his side. They do not have the arms or wherewithal to riot as a mob, so they put on a play where they enact the roles of the people who truly are oppressing them as comic and horrible monsters. (There is also a Christmas play). He feels for animals and makes us feel for them: the women are forced to neuter their pigs and the ritual terrifies the women and the pigs: Levi describes their ordeal graphically.\n\nThere is cheerfulness too. For unexplained reasons Levi is given “time off” or “away” from Gagliano, to return to the more middle class Grassano, a sort of vacation from the monotony. He goes to cafes, participates in games, talk; among other things, the towns people also put on a play. He is treated like some kind of star. I felt he was treated as an extraordinary person and this worked on his sensibility a bit too strongly. But at the core of this book is his love for these people (although he cannot live here, does not belong) and atttempts to help them. The last couple of pages of the book repeat his political and moral ideas and are a vow to enact them politically if he survives. And he did.\n\n***********************************************\n\nI conclude with a little life:\n\nHis years were 1902 – 1975. He grew up in Turin, both parents wealthy, his father a doctor. Levi trained as a doctor at first – we see that ability come into prominence in his time in Lucania. His sister with whom he was close and whose visit to Gagliano (as I said), provides an important section of the book – she brings some tools of his medical trade, some tools for his painting trade; a stethoscope is unheard of in this place. Luisa’s astonishment and shock when she visits this rural southern part of Italy for the first time enables us to see the place through the eyes of someone never come near such a place – horror especially at the children covered with insects so diseased so young – none of it necessary (she says and knows as this does not exist in the north). The theme of the book, through her eyes is, someone or people elsewhere have made the choices which lead to this environment and the peasants knowing no hope or nothing better have acquiesced – but are in their deepest selves very angry – whence among others fascism – we are seeing something of the same thing here in the US. Sister is a child psychologist, pediatrician at a time few women in Italy were highly educated and she begins immediately to make plans for people to enact on these people’s behalf.\n\nBy 1923 Levi had been living in Paris as a painter; by 1928 he had given up the profession of medicine and become a painter – and went back to Turin. He was also in Rome where he lived a good deal in the later part of his life. 1934 the year he was arrested for anti-fascist activity was the same year Mario Levi swims to safety in Switzerland; Levi had founded a party calling itself Justice and Liberty – 1929. Ginzburg belonged – so that’s how Natalia met him. There were spies or moles everywhere and one who presented himself as a pornographer (he had to pretend to some talent) was a member of the secret police. In 1936 Levi was released and moved quickly to Paris until the fall of Mussolini. He joined the Political Action Party (see just below), influenced by a politically active man named Gobetti (also turns up in Family Lexicon) edited papers and returning to hiding wrote. He took refuse in Southern France and also the Pitti Palace in Florence where he is said to have written Christ Stopped at Eboli. Throughout the 1930s, 40s fascist police a constant threat. Christ Stopped at Eboli was published by Einaudi for whom Natalia worked – so too Pavese and others – a very in group.\n\nOne of Levi’s own paintings: a vista, a view of Aliano\n\nAfter the war, he met the woman who became his partner, Lenuccia Salva. 1950 he edited Italia Libera, identified as the voice of Partito d’Azione (Action Party). He wrote one novel, The Watch (Orologio) using some of this journalism I Rome. He was imitating non-fiction works – in the experimental mode popular among the more artistic – -elite – since Joyce’s Ulysses, Woolf’s Mrs Dalloway. They play games with time. The watch occurs over three days during which time the protagonist has lost his watch. He is doing for Italy and Rome after the war what he had done for Lucania during: recording life culture politics impingement of history. He wrote another marvelous meditative book about Italy just after the war: Fleeting Rome.\n\nHe lived a life of energy and fervor – he painted away, had lots of exhibits. His experiences in Sicily ae another semi-autobiographical book, Words are Stones (Le parole sono pietre) won a prestigious prize. Traveled to Germany & Italy and recorded what he saw – one book called The Future has an Ancient Heart. I like that. 1963 elected Senator on the communist ticket, died of pneumonia in January 1975.\n\nLevi left much of his writing out of print or scattered and in 2002 was published Fleeting Rome, wonderful book – in seach of La Dolce Vita. Posthumous. There is no biography in English, and no inexpensive one in Italian or any other language. He was a communist; communists are erased; in the 1930s they didn’t get prizes, stories about them didn’t get prizes …\n\nChrist Stopped at Eboli had a hard time penetrating the US market; early reviews by US people condemned it (this was the 1950s remember – with McCarthyism and John Birch Society on the war path) as propaganda. It made its way slowly and a film made hardly seen in the US Francesco Rosi, Christ Stopped at Eboli, a sort of neo-realistic documentary (1979) I have the first half of a faulty DVD set; the second disk is missing. There are Wonderful features about the making of the film, the director and Levi himself.\n\nFilmed on location, here is the stairway leading up to the house Levi lived in.\n\nHe was buried in Aliano and today people come to tour Aliano to see his house; various signs tell you what he did here and there.\n\nI must not leave out his dog, Barone. The film shows him taking Barone on by chance; in fact, he told people he wanted a dog for a companion, and this dog was a beautiful good-natured stray (in effect) and he was given him. Barone today is buried next to Levi’s father (presumably in Turin). The photo at the beginning of this section is of Levi and Barone.\n\nEllen"
