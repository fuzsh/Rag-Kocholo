        "text": "“One can’t live without Rossellini,” a character declares in Bernardo Bertolucci’s 1964 film “Before the Revolution.” Yet, almost three decades after Roberto Rossellini’s death in 1977, most moviegoers in America manage to live without the Italian director, though perhaps not as happily as they might. With the vast majority of his films unavailable for home rental, the father of Italian neo-realism and Isabella Rossellini has been reduced to little more than a cinephile cult figure, a faded saint on an art house fresco.\n\nThe retrospective of Rossellini’s film and television work that opens on Wednesday at the Museum of Modern Art may not revive the director’s reputation, but it’s wonderfully welcome nonetheless, an instant, essential event. Organized by the museum and the Cinematheque Ontario, the show runs through Dec. 22 and is slated to travel to Los Angeles and London. It includes a parallel exhibition of Rossellini film posters (some on loan from Ms. Rossellini’s former husband, Martin Scorsese), and encompasses both familiar titles, like the neo-realist classic “Open City” (1945), and some of the more unfamiliar features he made for television after he seemed to abandon the art form he helped revolutionize.\n\nThe Rossellini reality principle is ephemeral and profound. He helped usher the world back into cinema by mixing authentic people and locations in with actors and studio sets. But neo-realist directors like Rossellini and Vittorio De Sica do not, to paraphrase the critic André Bazin, simply deck out a formal story with touches of reality, as if reality were bits of tinsel. Instead, they offer fragments of reality that retain all of its mystery and ambiguity and whose meaning we piece together, much as the characters do. Others put reality, Bazin writes, “in a cage or teach her to talk, but De Sica talks with her, and it is the true language of reality that we hear, the word that cannot be denied, that only love can utter.”\n\nRossellini once said that at the time he made “Open City” there was a “tremendous need for truth”; in this he and his fellow neo-realist directors “were maintaining a moral position more than a style.” But Rossellini, who directed features for the Fascist regime before he became an anti-Fascist filmmaker, was not a man to keep opportunity knocking. Witness the story that Tag Gallagher tells in his biography “The Adventures of Roberto Rossellini” about a script girl, who, while hurrying through Rome as Americans poured into the city in June 1944, bumped into the director. “We have to make a movie,” Rossellini said. “Right now. All we have to do is look around us and we’ll find all the stories we need.”\n\nSeven months later, bankrolled by a countess, with a script partly written by Federico Fellini, he began shooting “Open City,” about the men, women and children in Rome who resisted the German occupation. Production wrapped in May 1945, the same month German forces in Italy surrendered; by early the next year, critics were in raptures over a film in which, as one wrote, “people act like people, not actors.” In The New York Times, Bosley Crowther exulted: “To us who have been accustomed to the slickly manufactured sentiments of Hollywood’s studio-made pictures, the hard simplicity and genuine passion of this film lend to its not unfamiliar story the smashing impact of a shocking exposé.”\n\n“Open City” may no longer shock, but even repeat viewings fail to blunt its force. Shot in black and white in studio sets and on location, the story loosely follows a partisan leader whose acquaintances include the saltiest salt of the earth, among them a neighborhood priest and a pregnant woman played by a magnificent Anna Magnani. In this wounded city, filled with bombed-out buildings and blitzed-out faces, everyone or nearly everyone dies: the resistance leader is tortured to death, the pregnant woman is gunned down, and the priest is executed. By the final credits, only the children and the enemy remain.\n\nOf the film, Rossellini said, “I tried to explore and understand, because I had the feeling that we were all responsible for what happened, all of us.” He might well have believed this, but neither “Open City” nor “Paisan” (1946), another story about the resistance, pays mind to Italian responsibility. There is a smattering of Italian Fascists in “Paisan,” shooting it out with partisans in a thrillingly staged Florence street battle. But even the homegrown soldiers in “Open City” don’t have the stomach for Nazi-style barbarism, and in the film’s climax an Italian firing squad lowers its guns, leaving a disgusted German officer to deliver the fatal bullet. There are bad Germans in each film and, for the most part, Italian partisans, Italian martyrs and Italian victims.\n\n“Open City” and “Paisan” made Rossellini an international name. But the enthusiasm inspired by these films soon waned in some quarters, starting with his brutal 1947 film “Germany Year Zero,” in which the theme of sacrifice transmutes — depending on how you interpret a child’s suicide — into an embrace of nihilism or a gesture toward transcendence. Shot in the still-ravaged streets of Berlin in 1947 and, as usual (if disconcertingly), dubbed into Italian, the film follows the tow-headed 12-year-old Edmund, who, after spending much of the film struggling to feed his besieged family, commits murder and then suicide. Critics who had embraced the nominal social realism of Rossellini’s resistance films wondered at the message he now seemed to be sending.\n\nIn some respects, Edmund is at once a stand-in for all the German children whose lives were shattered by the war and a ghostly reminder of the German generation that had been abandoned, with catastrophic consequences, after World War I. But Edmund is also very much a real child, at times a rather frail-looking German boy who does not represent or explain something extraneous to what we see on screen, like innocence or purity. He is not a symbol or an abstraction, but a body moving through a wretchedly real time and space that Rossellini refuses to shape into a palatable narrative. Which is why the filmmaker’s moral position doesn’t arrive at the finale, but is inscribed in every image of this terminally alone child.\n\nFrench critics stuck by Rossellini through the 1950s, while the Italian Marxists and American moralists took turns throwing darts. The Marxists didn’t like what they were seeing; the moralists didn’t like what they were hearing. After writing Rossellini a charmingly coy letter expressing interest in working with him, the Hollywood wife, mother and star Ingrid Bergman was soon starring in his new film, “Stromboli” (1949). She was also soon pregnant by him, a scandal that erupted with all the fury of the volcano that blows in the film’s ending. Senator Edwin C. Johnson, a Democrat from Colorado, condemned Bergman’s “moral turpitude ” and damned Rossellini as a “love pirate.” The outrage wasn’t postmodern cheeky (“Bergillini!”) but 17th-century scarlet A.\n\nBergman and Rossellini, who married after the birth of their son, Roberto, completed five features, which create a fascinating shadow biography, creative as well as personal. In “Stromboli,” the Swedish Bergman plays a Lithuanian-born displaced person, Karin, who tries to emigrate to Argentina and instead marries an Italian soldier. He whisks her off to his primitive island where, surrounded by silent women, whistling men and the simmering volcano of the film’s title, she loses her bearings. Much like the astonishing scene of fishermen pulling enormous, thrashing tuna from the water, the craggy, foreboding landscape isn’t a backdrop to Karin’s alienation but a manifestation of it. An alienation that finally leads her to the edge of the volcano’s fiery mouth, where she cries out, “I’m afraid, I’m afraid ... what mystery, what beauty, oh my God.”\n\nSeveral years and films later, the flowing lava in “Stromboli” led to Rossellini’s “Journey to Italy” (1953). Here, Bergman and a seemingly uncomfortable George Sanders play a married couple, Katherine and Alex, who travel to the Naples countryside to sell a house. They eat, sleep and one night, they quarrel. Consequently, they take separate day trips, a division that essentially continues until an acquaintance cajoles them into visiting Pompeii. There, amid the ruins, they watch a worker reveal the traces of a man and woman frozen in eternal embrace, a vision that causes Katherine to flee, remarking, “Life is so short.” Right afterward, while watching a religious procession, they are separated by the crowd until something — grace, love or perhaps the warm sea of bodies — brings them together.\n\nIt is a shattering reunion, sublime and terrifying. Here, against all apparent reason and the evidence of their actions, two people affirm their love for each other in the shadow of another couple’s death. Bazin, who is always worth quoting, believed that the world of Rossellini was one of “pure acts, unimportant in themselves but preparing the way (as if unbeknownst to God himself) for the sudden dazzling revelation of their meaning.” Some Bazin detractors chalked this up to his Catholicism, but you don’t have to believe in any god to appreciate Rossellini’s sense of worldly grace, to see how Bergman’s face lights up like the sun in “Stromboli” and how she clasps poor George Sanders in an embrace that will immortalize their images more lastingly than any in Pompeii.\n\nFor Bazin and the young critics and would-be filmmakers of Cahiers du Cinéma, like Jean-Luc Godard, Rossellini’s films were deep wells from which, some 50 years after the birth of the movies, they could draw ideas about cinema’s relationship to reality and subjectivity. Traditional fiction film built worlds out of illusionist tricks. Rossellini presented the world, unadorned, like the gift that it is. In one of his triumphs, the beautiful, acutely moving “Flowers of St. Francis” (1950), there is a moment in which St. Francis, played by a real monk, asks a bird to hush its singing because he’s trying to pray to God. It’s easy for you to talk to God, he explains. It’s harder for us humans."
