        "text": "Neorealism is a type of film movement that left its mark on the Italian film industry during the 1940s and 1950s. Neorealism emphasizes the rebirth of Italy through the events of resistance against the Fascists and Nazis, as well as the liberation of the country by the allies. Neorealist films reshape the Italian modern society because theses films emphasize poverty, inequalities, desire for freedom, resistance against the Germans, and democracy. However, these films also bring up political disagreements because it shows Italy in an honest light, which is both critical and difficult.\n\nNeorealism has a distinct set of characteristics that make it unique. Because there was a limited amount of money in the film industry during the time, filmmakers had to do with what they had. Films were shot on film, which showed the reality and conditions of Italy after World War II, as well as made up for the lack of film studios. Additionally, actors were unprofessional. What I found interesting to learn was that the space and materials included in a film were just as important as the characters. As I think about this idea more and more, it makes sense because materials and locations helped convey moods, emotions, statuses, and realism at the time.\n\nPaisan is a neorealist film that is composed of six episodes. These episodes make one think intellectually, as each are connected to the liberation and resistance of Italy. Paisan starts out in Southern Italy and works itself up to Northern Italy, mimicking the liberation of the country. What I found intriguing about each episode was that almost all of them opened with a news-reel footage. This helped explain what was going on in each city during World War II, as well as provided a sense of existence of the time. These fragmented stories that make up each episode leaves one to ponder about what happened. As I watched Paisan, I had to be an active watcher because I did not want to miss any important parts. Rossellini withholds knowledge in each episode, leaving spectators to assume the missing information. I find this clever and different because most films I currently watch are predictable, but do not leave out anything that is considered significant.\n\nWhen reading Schoonver’s journal ‘Brutal Vision,’ I found it almost surprising that advertisements for Paisan were either aimed at the mass audience to be sexual or aimed at a class audience to be more formal and scholastic. I believe that films should stray away from advertising sexuality because it diminishes women, as well as focuses on the wrong things. Films should rather focus on and advertise themes such as family or passion, although it is difficult to do so when the majority of individuals are drawn in by themes of sex and desire.\n\nRome Open City is another recognizable film created during the neorealist movement. In a book about Rome Open City, David Forgacs writes that Rossellini says ‘ideas generate images.’ I found this inspiring and true because ideas are just the start of something special. As I mentioned previously, films that I normally watch tend to be predictable. However in neorealist films, such as ones like Rome Open City, I find them to be unpredictable. Pina’s death came out of nowhere, and there was no suspense to build up the scene. Main characters do not normally die in the middle of a film, however, Rome Open City opposes this belief with this new idea. I initially could not believe my eyes when I saw this scene, but I was more shocked by the scene that followed it where Manfredi and Francesco had found a way to escape the Nazi’s. What I find amusing about neorealism is the effects is leaves on its viewers. There is always an emotion to be felt, which is what spectators desire most from a film."
