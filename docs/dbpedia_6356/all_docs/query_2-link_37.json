She was in Rome, observing the excited atmosphere following national Liberation from Nazi and Fascist forces. Mussolini had been killed in Northern Italy by the partisans a few days earlier. The historic news compelled her to write a remarkable entry, a moral portrait of the man who had dominated Italian life for more than twenty years. Morante describes the dictator as the champion of a country and of a people with no sense of the common good: All these crimes of Mussolini’s were tolerated, even encouraged and applauded. Now, a people that tolerates its leader’s crimes becomes an accomplice to these crimes. If it encourages and applauds them, it becomes, worse than an accomplice, an instigator of these crimes. [. . .] Did the majority of the Italian population realize these acts were crimes? Almost always, they realized it, but such is the Italian people that it gives its votes to the strong rather than to the just; and if it’s made to choose between personal gain and duty, even as it knows what its duty would be, it chooses personal gain.1\n\nMorante’s focus on the ethical accountability of the Italian people for crimes perpetrated by Fascism is quite at odds with the political narratives and historical interpretations of the following years. These narratives aimed at legitimizing the birth of the new Republic after the ordeal of the war, alleging that Italians preserved a moral stability, despite twenty years of\n\n19571-Baldasso_AgainstRedemption.indd 1\n\n10/3/22 11:21 AM\n\n2 | Introduction: Ruins and Debris of a Contested History\n\ndictatorship—an assessment that found in liberal philosopher Benedetto Croce its most outspoken advocate, even outside of Italy.2 Neorealist movies and Resistance novels also largely depict the Italian people, particularly the lower classes, as essentially unaffected by Fascist propaganda.3 Morante goes against the grain, ascribing the considerable support Mussolini and his regime enjoyed to a set of dishonest practices widespread among ordinary Italians. In her arguments, the writer avoids any recourse to cliché, like the supposedly defective “Italian character,” which was common among her contemporary commentators as a means to trivialize the national catastrophe and its moral responsibility.4 On the contrary, she singles out the conscious individual and collective choices that sustained Mussolini and the Fascist regime until the disaster of the war. Little more than a year later, Morante and her husband, Alberto Moravia, hosted Curzio Malaparte for dinner at their house in Capri. At the time, Malaparte was at the peak of his literary fame: His Kaputt, published in 1944 in Naples while the war was still raging, quickly became a best seller across Europe. He wrote indignantly of the views Morante and Moravia expressed on that occasion in a letter to his old friend, Giuseppe Prezzolini: At a certain point, I don’t know why, it occurred to Moravia to ask me, snickering, if I was sorry Italy had lost the war. Naturally I immediately responded that not only am I sorry Italy lost the war but I’m profoundly saddened it didn’t win it. Protests from Moravia and his wife, who cried: “No, it’s a good thing that Italy lost the war, it deserved worse, etc., etc.”5\n\nMalaparte concludes the letter with personal remarks on the state of the country after the military defeat: “I believe, dear Prezzolini, that the only way to react to wretchedness, to defeat, to dishonor, to humiliations, is to feel that one is Italian, to proclaim oneself Italian, etc.” His response to Italy’s fall was, as he himself states, “my country right or wrong.”6 The private writings of Morante and Malaparte bear witness to the political and cultural discontent of these years on how to navigate the post-­ Fascist transition in national history. They sample a larger disagreement with the historical truthfulness of the narratives of redemption and of national rebirth (“Secondo Risorgimento”) that took shape between the demise of Mussolini’s regime in the summer of 1943 and the victory of the Christian Democrats over the Left in the April 18, 1948, general elections. Early postwar narratives of national redemption emerged as a response to the demands of the moment, yet they commanded public discourse and justified political agendas for decades to come.\n\n19571-Baldasso_AgainstRedemption.indd 2\n\n10/3/22 11:21 AM\n\nIntroduction: Ruins and Debris of a Contested History | 3\n\nThis book distinguishes, analyzes, and theorizes early postwar literary practices as a primary means of communicating intellectual dissent, challenging established categories of cultural analysis of the period, and shedding new light on the role of cultural policies in institutionalizing collective memory. By tracking the heated debates these publications sparked, this study elucidates the range and fluidity of opinions in the years before ideological struggle fossilized into Cold War oppositions and offers a more nuanced comprehension of the passage from Fascism to democracy in Italy. Whether fostered by the Resistance myth of a new Risorgimento for the country or sanctioned by Benedetto Croce’s authoritative reading of the Fascist ventennio as a “parenthesis” in Italian history, the idea of a collective redemption prompted interpretations of the recent national past not as one of catastrophe but as one of moral regeneration. “Redenzione” (“redemption”), with its overtly religious or mystical undertones, and the more secular concept of a moral “riscatto” (literally: “ransom”) were ubiquitous terms in the 1943–1948 political debate, which appropriated and then normalized language and slogans of the armed insurrection against Fascism and the Nazi invaders. Political redemption and moral regeneration informed collective memory for decades to come, thereby legitimizing the new party system that granted continuity to the Italian state.7 The regenerative impact of Neorealism and its imaginary—easily the most influential cultural phenomenon of the period—reinforced a collective sense of a “new beginning,” encouraging national reconstruction.8 While documenting collective war traumas or the structural injustices of Italian society, cinematic gems such as Roberto Rossellini’s Rome Open City (1945) or Luchino Visconti’s The Earth Trembles (1948) concurrently paved a clear path to national and personal palingenesis, turning the singular private struggle into a meaningful fragment of the new national epic.9 Far from achieving the lyrical intensity and complex hermeneutics of Rossellini or Visconti, the literary counterparts to these momentous films expressed, as Charles Leavitt recently put it, “the profound faith in the power of culture to redeem society, a faith that was frequently communicated in Christian terms.”10 Together with its international outreach, the Neorealist imaginary nurtured a strong sense of collective awareness in the country’s cultural and political elites, based on the countless vicissitudes of loss and hardship that Italians shared. The ills of recent history, which affected the lives of every single Italian, became the catalyst for a new perception of national belonging.11 For early postwar intellectuals, Neorealism also represented a call for cultural renewal, showing and prescribing new modalities of intervention,\n\n19571-Baldasso_AgainstRedemption.indd 3\n\n10/3/22 11:21 AM\n\n4 | Introduction: Ruins and Debris of a Contested History\n\nfar from the nationalist models of the Fascist regime.12 In this sense, the oft quoted opening editorial of Elio Vittorini’s influential journal Il Politecnico aptly exemplifies this larger cultural project: “Will we ever have a culture that knows how to protect man from his sufferings rather than limit itself to consoling him?”13 One of the consequences of this project’s political soundness was the marginalization of other intellectual stances expressing different, if not opposite, views. Subsequent cultural accounts of the transition preferred to ignore inconvenient experiences like those typified by Morante and Mala­ parte’s excerpts, as they irremediably complicate the frame of national narratives of redemption. Already in 1971, Romano Luperini, from a radical Marxist perspective, characterized the intellectual policies that guaranteed the continuity of the state as “the ideology of reconstruction”—that is, skirting around the unresolved shortcomings of democracy in post-­Fascist Italy for the sake of national unity.14 Two decades later, political journalist Enzo Forcella, who after the 1943 armistice did not join the Resistance, critically reexamined his own experience as unassimilable to any redemptive narrative: “It’s a matter of months, years, of errors, of doubts, confusion, and uncertainties. What’s difficult to accept is the repression, at times the actual erasure, of memory, of these doubts and of these errors. The acquiescence to conformism.”15 Though its aesthetic dominated the early postwar conversation, Neo­ realism and the lively exchange inspired by its seminal works do not paint the full picture of the intellectual debate during the post-­Fascist transition in Italy. As the excerpts taken from Morante and Malaparte make clear, the sense of a “new beginning” evoked by Neorealist aesthetics or the redemptive narratives of Italian history fell short and could not fully encompass the contradictory and often explosive cultural and social scenario of the time.16 Post–Cold War historiography has demonstrated how such a scenario was marked by the institutional and political continuity between the monarchy that supported Fascism and the newborn republic led by the center-­ right Catholic-­oriented coalition.17 Continuity of the state notwithstanding, private memory and public accounts of the time provide abundant evidence of how these years were also characterized by loss, trauma, and ideological uncertainties after more than twenty years of pervasive totalitarian pedagogy, the enduring effects of war, and of a long dictatorship that set to aggressively modernize the country.18 In this complex situation, the memory of the Resistance as a second Risorgimento developed also as a result of the political needs of the moment. As Rosario Forlenza argued, “There is no\n\n19571-Baldasso_AgainstRedemption.indd 4\n\n10/3/22 11:21 AM\n\nIntroduction: Ruins and Debris of a Contested History | 5\n\ndoubt that it produced a distorted version of history. It denied public expression to those stories, experiences, and memories that did not fit with the Resistance as popular epic and founding moment for the new national identity.”19 This study focuses on the heterodox voices that, during the transition, stressed not just the institutional but also the cultural continuity between the new democracy and the previous regime. Together with Morante and Malaparte, authors as diverse as Carlo Levi, Alberto Moravia, Umberto Saba, Ennio Flaiano, and Vitaliano Brancati challenged the assumption of Italy’s moral regeneration after the break with Fascism. In the early postwar period, coming to terms with this historical continuity implied the haunting problem of Italian responsibility in WWII, the working through of national defeat, as well as the firm disavowal of past cultural and political models. Such past models engendered the definitive shipwreck—not the rebirth—of the national state born with the Risorgimento. According to these authors, only an uncompromising appraisal of the shipwreck could lead to emancipation from Fascism and its cultural models. After experiencing Italian totalitarianism, the aforementioned authors spelled out from contrasting political positions a radical critique of beliefs like the preeminence of the State and of History over the lives of individuals. These beliefs were crucial principles of the Fascist ideology of Italian national history developed in particular by Giovanni Gentile and Gioacchino Volpe from the idealistic philosophy and historicism that characterized the previous liberal regime and that profoundly influenced early twentieth-­century Italian culture.20 In Fascist and liberal ideologies, these notions assumed the role of unquestionable, metaphysical premises for narratives of national redemption, to the detriment of what Carlo Levi calls in his commentaries the “life-­in-­ relation” of the single person within their community. The firm rejection of any political finalism—of any political theology— was, for these intellectuals, the starting point for a wealth of compelling inquiries into the debris of prewar ideas and the anxieties of early postwar society. With their writing, they ventured well beyond the strict borders of Italian history into the crisis of European civilization that led up to WWII and the Holocaust. Their works range from Malaparte’s critical appraisal of the tragic contrast between the destructive power of modern technology and the fragility of creaturely life;21 to Moravia’s radical humanism and refusal of revolutionary politics; to Brancati’s moral inquiry into his own personal responsibility with the regime; to Saba, Flaiano, and Morante’s denunciation of how racial and gender biases predated, persisted, and\n\n19571-Baldasso_AgainstRedemption.indd 5\n\n10/3/22 11:21 AM\n\n6 | Introduction: Ruins and Debris of a Contested History\n\nsurvived the fall of Fascism; to Carlo Levi’s envisioning of a new body politic constituted not on exclusion but on inclusion and pluralism. In this study, I place these better-­known writers in dialogue with remarkable but now almost forgotten figures such as Giuseppe Berto, Vittorio Zincone, and Guido Piovene, as well as other intellectuals who, during the transition, critically tackled singular aspects of the discourses of national redemption—from Alberto Savinio to Carlo Emilio Gadda to Primo Levi. As my research shows, the main political and cultural journals of the time, such as Aretusa, Il Ponte, La Nuova Europa, Mercurio, Società, Italia Libera, regardless of political affiliations, reviewed and debated these texts; their ideas circulated and were elaborated in original ways. In fact, as Daniela La Penna recently put it, “the postwar periodical press acted as a public performative space where individuals and groups verbalised their distance from the Fascist past and competed for new forms and sources of intellectual and political legitimation.”22 The disquieting continuity between Fascist ideology and religious propaganda, crucial for the totalitarian project, was at the center of these authors’ historical and existential reflections.23 The nature of their investigations into totalitarianism, ideology, and redemptive readings of history obliged them to take a critical stance against the Communist credo and reexamine the significance of religion and the figure of Christ—an obsessive presence, from Berto to Malaparte to Carlo Levi—in modern society. Interestingly, the rejection of religion as both practice and narrative, and of the meaning of Christ as “Redeemer,” goes hand in hand with the reappraisal of his figure as a symbol of victimization and tragic sacrifice—ultimately of scapegoating. These authors’ criticism of ideology and religion, as well as their anarchical reading of the figure of Christ, could not but trigger violent opposition from the two new political and cultural forces that dominated postwar Italy, Christian Democracy (DC) and the Italian Communist Party (PCI), as well as from intellectuals aligned with either side.24 As writer Corrado Alvaro bitterly meditated in a 1946 article, the legacy of Fascism and the war had to be addressed as a denial of the millennial Christian civilization and of its most important achievements: Perhaps the most serious thing to happen to today’s man has been the destruction of human solidarity; that is, of that concept—perhaps the highest in all of civilization, the greatest achievement of two thousand years of Christianity—by which the wrong of one, tolerated and unseen and not vindicated and not paid for and not redeemed, sooner or later becomes the wrong of all of society.25\n\n19571-Baldasso_AgainstRedemption.indd 6\n\n10/3/22 11:21 AM\n\nIntroduction: Ruins and Debris of a Contested History | 7\n\nThe crisis denounced by Alvaro was far more radical than the institutional and political struggle for power over the peninsula. For authors such as Moravia, Saba, and Carlo Levi, the recent past had to be relentlessly revisited and reappraised in order to dismantle Fascist ideology. In their works, they signal the conspicuous persistence of totalitarian tenets, not least in what Brancati called “Pure Anti-­Fascism.”26 The Fascist ideology of Italian history and its delusions was indeed the principal narrative of redemption to which these writers directed their critical attention. Formal and poetical elaboration, the unremitting search for a plurality of truths in history, and a sense of their literature as testimony are all concerns present in their writing in the attempt to break free from Fascist rhetoric and dismiss new redemptive narratives of the early postwar. The “Political Wrong” of Literature during the Transition\n\nMussolini’s regime grounded its legitimacy on the myths of Italian history, from the Roman Empire to the Renaissance. The totalitarian regime coalesced aggressive nationalism with the liberal secular religion of the fatherland in its ideology of national history. According to Claudio Fogu, Fascist propaganda asserted the absolute immanency and “history-­making” quality of its own agency.27 This conception interpreted the myths of national regeneration of WWI and the March on Rome as its “sacred” historical foundation. The March on Rome meant also the reclamation of the Roman imperial past, of which the regime proclaimed itself historical heir. Fascist rhetoric envisioned present individual sacrifice as an expiation leading to the future redemption of the entire nation from the errors of the past. The myth of Rome and its Empire is the more apparent, though not the only, facet of the historical rhetoric supporting the Italian state until the disaster of WWII.28 With the proclaimed goal of refashioning Italy as a world power, Mussolini and his acolytes turned this historicist mentality into reckless fanaticism. Still, a rhetorical mindset preceded Fascism.29 During the transition, historicist self-­representations of the country were heralded once again by liberal philosopher Benedetto Croce, reinvigorated by his international moral authority as a long-­standing opposer of the regime. These historicist paradigms and rhetorical mindsets would survive in the parties that would later constitute the parliamentarian democracy, albeit profoundly transformed. After WWII, Christian Democrats and Communists both claimed their legitimacy as national forces not only from the founding event of the Resistance against Nazi-­Fascism, but also as bearers of transnational narratives. Although utterly divergent in their ends, Catholic and Communist ideologies\n\n19571-Baldasso_AgainstRedemption.indd 7\n\n10/3/22 11:21 AM\n\n8 | Introduction: Ruins and Debris of a Contested History\n\novercome the present by projecting political and existential fulfillment in the absolute future of Christianity and of the Revolution, respectively. After the establishment of a democratic and constitutional Italy in 1948, Catholic transcendence justified the seizure of power; Communist historical dialectics fostered stark parliamentarian opposition.30 Christian or secular, each dominant narrative of the recent past during the early postwar period featured eschatological pretenses. Croce interpreted Fascism as a “parenthesis” or as a “foreign sickness” in an organism that was otherwise healthy and that recuperated its true form through the antibodies gained during the war. With the myth of the “Secondo Risorgimento,” anti-­ Fascist forces celebrated the armed Resistance as the moral rebirth of the nation. In the speeches of their leaders, from Actionist Ferruccio Parri to Monarchist Luigi Einaudi, the Risorgimento’s moral legacy turned into a rhetorical call for action.31 Its appeal also functioned as historical legitimization for the new political forces aiming to ground post-­Fascist Italy in the values of the Resistance.32 In the revealing words of anti-­Fascist leader Leone Ginzburg, written shortly before his arrest and murder by the Fascists and published in early 1945, the Risorgimento implies for each Italian “a straightforward choice that precedes any historiographical evaluation. Indifference is not an option.”33 Encompassing varying positions of the anti-­Fascist political spectrum, the “Secondo Risorgimento” narrative thus encouraged many disillusioned young Italians who were willing to pay for their moral riscatto to take up arms for the anti-­Fascist Resistance.34 This younger generation was educated in the civic religion of the fatherland under Fascism but was disenchanted after the regime’s ethical failures and military setbacks. As Giaime Pintor stressed in his influential 1943 article “The Time of Redemption,” this trope epitomized the moral crisis that propelled personal participation within the collective struggle for national redemption, pitting the “new” revolution of his generation against the discredited and now disavowed Fascist revolution.35 Finally, Italian Communists, whose brigades were the majority among partisan organizations, perceived the Nazi-­Fascist defeat as a confirmation of the Marxist master narrative and the triumph of the Soviet “new man.” In the immediate postwar period, the promise of a new leftist society seemed imminent, galvanized by the striking victory of the Red Army on the Eastern Front and the landslide success of Clement Attlee’s Labor Party in Great Britain in the 1945 elections.36 Each of these readings of the recent past projected onto post-­Fascist Italy, which had miraculously survived the war\n\n19571-Baldasso_AgainstRedemption.indd 8\n\n10/3/22 11:21 AM\n\nIntroduction: Ruins and Debris of a Contested History | 9\n\nand a humiliating defeat, a lineage of progress and regeneration—a collective redemption after the shameful subjugation to Mussolini’s regime. As David Ward argued, Catholic and Communist ideologies offered effective “patterns of conversion,” able to seamlessly integrate Fascist and liberal ideologies of Italian history into their redemptive narratives.37 More recently, Luca La Rovere pointed out how the debate on the legacy of Fascism in the early postwar mainly focused on how to fold into democracy the so-­called Lictorian generation, who grew up during the totalitarian regime and was educated exclusively by Fascist organizations.38 According to La Rovere, this public exchange considerably complicates the generally held paradigm of a widespread repression of the recent past during the transition, contesting the idea of a clear cultural caesura in 1940s Italy.39 Once again, Enzo Forcella posed the question with distinctive lucidity. In his diaries he describes how “according to the anti-­Fascist historiographical canon, the ‘coming-­of-­age story’ of the so-­called ‘Lictorian generation’ ” was established in those years along the lines of “the dialectical template of Error-­Bewilderment-­ Redemption. The error of more or less convinced support for Fascism, the bewilderment provoked by the disaster of September 8, and the realization of one’s political commitment, with the consequent redemption through participation in the Resistance.”40 While these “patterns of conversion” sanctioned the new political power, they also obliterated the pioneering texts that nonaligned intellectuals elaborated in those same years on completely different bases. Mediated through fiction or autobiographical accounts, authors such as Saba, Berto, Brancati, and Flaiano represented the vacuum left behind by the demise of the ideology of Italian history that had sustained the state from the Risor­ gimento to WWII. If the nationalistic (and romantic) idea of Italy was dead, the space was open for alternative interpretations and proposals—not only for new political ideas about the future Italy but also for unconventional narratives about its past. Italo Calvino famously recalled the early postwar period as characterized by an intense “craving to tell stories.” This obsession with telling and retelling, mentioned in the 1964 preface to his 1947 novel The Path to the Spiders’ Nests, was only partly due to the joy of regained freedom after the dictatorship’s repression of discontent and the cruelties of the war.41 After Fascism and its ideological monopoly of the national past, the truth of Italian history could not be but a plurality of truths, as the collective participation in the new democracy made clear. “And the harvest was ubiquitous,” confirms Natalia Ginzburg in her 1963 autobiographical novel Family Lexicon,\n\n19571-Baldasso_AgainstRedemption.indd 9\n\n10/3/22 11:21 AM\n\n10 | Introduction: Ruins and Debris of a Contested History\n\n“because everyone wanted to take part in it. The result was a fortuitous fusion between the languages of poetry and politics, as they appeared intertwined together.”42 In this sense, the collective struggle for national liberation was a counterargument to the Fascist ideology of national history. The term “Liberation,” observes Giovanni De Luna, denotes a vigorous and even fierce collective agency.43 By claiming the “history-­making” quality of popular participation during the anti-­Fascist struggle, the Liberation liquidated the ideology of the regime, which markedly rejected any idea of popular agency. Yet, as the November 1945 showdown of the national coalition government led by Parri demonstrated, the forces that guided the Resistance failed to merge and consolidate the new Italy around the military success against Fascism. That was the moment, Alba de Céspedes wrote in the journal Mercurio, in which groups of artists and intellectuals “lined up alongside political and military forces against an obvious and universally hated enemy, such that the artist, the intellectual, the politician, the combatant merged into one.”44 Published at the beginning of 1948, de Céspedes’s column recalls the Liberation as an extraordinary but unrepeatable existential possibility—testifying at the same time that political disillusionment was already palpable by 1948. Historian Silvio Lanaro describes the subsequent 1949–1953 period as characterized by the “the putting on ice of the constitution and the repudiation of anti-­Fascism as the founding ideology and vehicle of a renewed national identity.”45 With an attentive politics of memory, the parties of the Left then defended (and somehow appropriated) the legacy of the Resistance as the founding myth of their Italy.46 During the transition, experiences that did not fit with the Resistance as popular epic and founding moment for the new national identity were dismissed or belittled: groundbreaking works such as Carlo Emilio Gadda’s Eros and Priapus (published 1967, but written in 1944–1945) or Primo Levi’s If This Is a Man (1947) had great difficulty finding a publisher; others, like Carlo Levi’s Christ Stopped at Eboli (1945) or Morante’s Lies and Sorcery (1948), though they enjoyed a wide readership, were harshly criticized for their unconventional representations of “revolutionary” subjects, thereby minimizing their cultural value on ideological grounds.47 In fact, the 1943–1948 transition does not present a consistent, recognizable, easily framed debate but instead a proliferation, a multiplication of heterodox voices.48 According to the political philosopher Jacques Rancière, a void of power typically engenders what he calls an “excess of speech”: Every event, among speakers, is tied to an excess of speech in the specific form of a displacement of the statement: an appropriation “outside the truth”\n\n19571-Baldasso_AgainstRedemption.indd 10\n\n10/3/22 11:21 AM\n\nIntroduction: Ruins and Debris of a Contested History | 11 of the speech of the other (of the formulas of sovereignty, of the ancient texts, of the sacred word) that makes it signify differently.49\n\nThe conditions of this “excess of speech” were produced by the unforeseeable series of events that began with the September 8, 1943, armistice and the discrediting of institutional authorities in Italy. This vacuum of authority opened possibilities for what Rancière called the expression of “the political wrong”—granting the right to speak to subjects that were not considered as such, qua outside of what is consensually held as the political.50 These subjects were chiefly the Italian people themselves, who could exercise the possibility of true participation in the political arena for the first time after the heavily limited freedom and sovereignty granted by the Fascist (and liberal) regime. The works I examine in this book express the “political wrong” of the transition to democracy in Italy. My analysis restores to us their disruptive political charge in the broader context of the early postwar intellectual debate. Their inventiveness and insight are illuminated by their controversial reception. The case of Carlo Levi’s most overtly political book, The Watch (1950), is emblematic. The novel received contentious reviews, especially in the press close to the PCI, and aroused fierce discussion when published. Still today, the book and debate are generally overlooked in both literary and intellectual histories.51 The “political wrong” of The Watch was not just the author’s portrayal of De Gasperi and Togliatti as equally responsible for the end of the extraordinary season of hope inaugurated by the Liberation, but also the treatment of postwar society’s ills as transversal and not ascribable to any single social class. In The Watch, individual and collective experiences are unaffected by Marxist ideology. Still, the novel’s “political wrong” resides also in its visionary and often oneiric style: while firmly rooted in the observation of Italian postwar reality, it dialogues with modernist and cosmopolitan literary practices. The Watch challenges Neorealist poetics, which postulated a simpler, paratactic style supposedly more representative of people’s lived experience, by arguing that traumatic experience is inherently resistant to verbalization.52 Marginalization within the postwar Italian cultural canon has been the destiny of many publications that expressed the “political wrong” in the passage to post-­Fascism. These publications feature not only multilayered and literary self-­conscious works such as The Watch but also pivotal journals of the period, from Luigi Salvatorelli’s La Nuova Europa to de Céspedes’s Mercurio. These journals offered an outlet for nonconformist intellectual and political positions, which had not yet hardened into the Communist vs.\n\n19571-Baldasso_AgainstRedemption.indd 11\n\n10/3/22 11:21 AM\n\n12 | Introduction: Ruins and Debris of a Contested History\n\nChristian Democrat struggle and the debate internal to each of these parties.53 From the cultural criticism of the Liberation’s periodicals to experimental novels, all of these works call into question historicist rhetoric. They articulated different truths by denouncing policies and procedures of symbolic redemption. At the heart of their anxieties were the “historic imaginary,” studied by Fogu, and the rhetorical concept of life that sustained power and the failed policies of the Italian state. Novels such as Flaiano’s A Time to Kill (1947) and Malaparte’s The Skin (1949) pinpoint the collective repression and the lack of a radical rift in Italian culture after Fascism. At the same time, daring, if less accessible, literary endeavors like Saba’s Shortcuts and Very Short Stories (1946) or Carlo Levi’s Fear of Freedom (written in 1939, but published in 1946) openly challenged historicist rhetoric by deploying contrasting hermeneutic paradigms.54 The cultural references here are Nietzsche and Freud, or the ethnological findings of the Collège de sociologie launched by Georges Bataille and Roger Caillois.55 What connected these disparate works was not just the distance of their authors from the Communist Party, which embraced the “Secondo Risor­ gimento” trope during the transition.56 All these works outright reject historicism and its teleological readings of Italian history. After already thriving in liberal Italy, historicism inflated Fascist pretensions and survived in the new democratic debate via redemptive narratives. Brancati mordantly captures the issue in his Roman Diary, written in the early postwar but published as a volume only posthumously: The character of modern rhetoric is not literary, but historicist. Literary rhetoricians are famous for the enormity of their images; modern rhetoricians will remain famous for the enormity of the second term of the comparison in their historical references. Every nationalist, at the end of a skirmish, compares his reign to the Roman Empire; every progressive, at the end of some upheaval or reform, compares his exploits to the Christian revolution.57\n\nContemporary critics, especially among the Communist ranks, were fully aware of how historicism permeated through modern Italian culture and how pervasive Croce’s influence was. Overcoming Croce and his historicism meant a repudiation of discursive practices that shaped the formation of most Italian intellectuals. However, after the demise of Fascism, more urgent political agendas took the place of Croce’s neo-­idealist concept of freedom. Ultimately limited to the ruling class, Croce’s freedom now appeared as a\n\n19571-Baldasso_AgainstRedemption.indd 12\n\n10/3/22 11:21 AM\n\nIntroduction: Ruins and Debris of a Contested History | 13\n\nphilosophical confirmation of the status quo, if not the relic of an old world that had already been subjugated by Mussolini and his cohorts.58 The overall question developed in ways that literary critic Giacomo Debenedetti epitomized in a public intervention significantly titled “Likely Autobiography of a Generation” (1949). Speaking on the behalf of a generation that came of age during Fascism and the war, Debenedetti’s proposed solution was: “Depart from Croce on the roads laid out by him.”59 Historicism was not just self-­referential; it needed to give way to a “new historicism.” A few years earlier, another prominent literary critic, Natalino Sapegno, had already clarified this “new historicism.” In his influential 1945 article “Marxism, Culture, and Poetry,” Sapegno proclaimed Marxism to be the “integral historicism” able to complete and overcome Croce’s now defective model.60 The cultural and critical discourse of the Marxist Left in Italy would then be impregnated with Crocean terminology, from Vittorini’s project of cultural renewal in Il Politecnico to Ernesto de Martino’s ethnological investigation of Southern Italy in pioneering books such as The Magical World (1948).61 In such an intricate scenario, nonaligned intellectuals publicly took a stand by rejecting historicism and its redemptive narratives altogether. But why did they use literature as the main vehicle of their cultural and political discontent? Throughout the life of the Italian state, from Mazzini to Mussolini, national literature was the common ground on which the Italian identity coalesced.62 Stefano Jossa cogently argues that: The political horizon of the literary community is, therefore, tremendous: literature responds to the crisis of history by giving to an Italy that is “fragmented and divided” on the political level a different, cultural type of unity, one founded on the myths and values shared on another level. Thus is created a space of literature, which has for a long time been the site of Italian identity.63\n\nHowever, as Antonio Gramsci denounced in Prison Notebooks, first published in the late 1940s, national literature was not a democratic space in Italy—hence his stress on the creation of a national-­popular literature.64 “Gramscians before Gramsci,” as Luperini bitingly calls them, the critics of PCI-­leaning journals such as Rinascita or Società, as well as Neorealist memoirists like Roberto Battaglia and his Man and Partisan (1945), tried to close this traditional gap by theorizing the “poetics of the chronicle” and supporting the populist epic of the Resistance (which we will see in detail in the next section).65\n\n19571-Baldasso_AgainstRedemption.indd 13\n\n10/3/22 11:21 AM\n\n14 | Introduction: Ruins and Debris of a Contested History\n\nOn the contrary, the writers I reference here utilized literature specifically for the ideological charge it acquired in Italian life. They did not consider literature as merely fiction or as rhetorical discourse with artistic pretensions. Nor did they consider it as simply a cultural institution deeply rooted in Italian society. Despite different agendas and poetics,66 for writers such as Morante, Moravia, Brancati, Carlo Levi, and Malaparte, literature was an ongoing exercise of critique for the given historical truth by means of the “displacement of the statement” Rancière mentioned. As a matter of fact, these authors recovered an idea of literature that is essentially pre-­romantic and pre-­national, yet one that is also consistent with the troubled Italian cultural identity.67 Their accounts do not just defy current ideas of modern(ist) literature; they also return to the core of the humanist tradition for which literature offered the ethical paradigm for the field of cultural production.68 The voices of this debate on the legacy of the Italian ideology of history cannot be seen merely as “transitional objects.” Their problematic reception cannot be justified solely by the ideological pervasiveness of antagonistic narratives of redemption or the global reach of Neorealism.69 These voices are ascribable to a larger historiographical postwar paradigm that characterized European politics and civilization after 1945. This paradigm positions early postwar Italian culture and society in a broader frame in which, as historian Frank Biess contends, “postwar histories were shaped not just by the external context of the Cold War but also by their preceding wartime histories.”70 In Italy, in the decades that followed, “the uncertainties of the immediate postwar years were forgotten,” as Tony Judt put it, primarily because of improvements in living and economic conditions, not unlike what occurred in other Western European countries. Nevertheless, he concludes, “the likelihood that they would take a different turn had seemed very real in 1945.”71 The disagreement I retrace in this study bears witness to such possibilities in Italy—and to such uncertainties. The next section details how two main processes structured the conflict over Italian history in the transition years: the working through of the collective and personal trauma of the national defeat and the ensuing disavowal of past models of life, culture, and politics. Both processes were haunted by the ghosts of totalitarianism and the responsibility of the war. Admitting the Defeat, Dismissing Past Models\n\n“It was still impossible to tell what country would win the war,” claims Galeazzo Ciano in Malaparte’s novel Kaputt in 1943, and yet “it was clear what countries had already lost it [. . .]. Poland and Italy.”72 As also alluded to by\n\n19571-Baldasso_AgainstRedemption.indd 14\n\n10/3/22 11:21 AM\n\nIntroduction: Ruins and Debris of a Contested History | 15\n\nMalaparte in his letter to Prezzolini, the significance of the military defeat was of fundamental concern to the Italian state, which was born out of the ashes of war and a totalitarian regime. Different interpretations of the defeat echoed across popular opinion but also affected Italian intellectuals and their cultural output. No other issue received more attention than national defeat in the immediate responses to WWII—only to disappear a few years later, overshadowed by new political preoccupations.73 The question was almost entirely silenced in the country’s public discourse after the promulgation of the new constitution on January 1, 1948, and the establishment of the Republic. The victory of the anti-­Fascist forces against Fascism and the Nazi occupiers soon became the principal national narrative.74 If anti-­Fascist victory and national military defeat were two sides of the same coin, only the first befitted the selective memory of the newborn democratic state as its legitimizing event. While the Resistance inspired massive literary, artistic, and filmic production, the vast majority of these accounts were reticent about the military defeat, its responsibility, and its horrors.75 Countering widespread assumptions, writers like Berto, Brancati, and Malaparte made this burdensome legacy the main theme of their artistic and intellectual inquiry, or, rather, their core poetics. Admitting the defeat became the propeller of their writing. They found in literature the appropriate outlet to voice their disagreements with what they felt was an increasingly frustrating public discourse. Their responses take different, at times opposite, poetic, psychological, and political paths. After openly endorsing Fascism, they elaborated the trauma of the defeat in profoundly original ways, arriving at contrasting conclusions. A melancholic gaze toward the past is the constitutional feature of their writing.76 Still, it is just the first reaction of a much more articulated response, dissimilar to the collective and individual cupio dissolvi that is the real subject of a great many publications and diaries of those troubled years.77 Reflecting on existential failure after the war, a main character of Piovene’s novel The False Redeemers (1949) concludes: “I don’t always want to live.”78 A case in point is De Profundis (1948), a controversial pamphlet by the esteemed jurist Salvatore Satta.79 In the book, the bleak atmosphere resulting from a supposed “death of the fatherland” clouds the persistence of conservative ideas with apocalyptic tones. Satta employs concepts that informed liberal and then Fascist policies—among them clear anti-­Semitic remarks. Pursuing an understanding of the unpredictable events of the national collapse, Satta’s De Profundis is emblematic for its inability to renounce past models.\n\n19571-Baldasso_AgainstRedemption.indd 15\n\n10/3/22 11:21 AM\n\n16 | Introduction: Ruins and Debris of a Contested History\n\nConversely, the writers I reference in my research draw radical conclusions from the national defeat: with their work, they enact a consequential and thought-­provoking dismissal of past models. Where others mourn the past as ruins, they bitterly observe it as an accumulation of debris.80 From Malaparte to Saba, this new literature is concerned first of all with the liquidation of the old European civilization, which disgracefully perished with the world conflict. Significantly, their responses often provoked outrage from the early postwar cultural and political establishment, both from conservative and progressive sides. For authors such as Berto and Brancati, dismissing past models meant also disputing the cultural principles of their education. Their writing recuperates the forms of the traditional novel in order to work through their individual responsibility with Fascism. Novels such as Berto’s The Sky Is Red (1946) and Brancati’s Beautiful Antonio (1949) explore the moral void left by the dictatorship and traditional Italian institutions—from the Church to the family—that collaborated with Fascism and willingly approved its reactionary myths.81 Their dramatic rejection of Catholic education and patriarchal sexual roles—in apparent continuity with Fascism—speak volumes to the fallacy of the moral regeneration that the regime change promised to bring to a society still burdened by traditional inequality and condescending practices. Beginning with Carlo Levi’s Christ Stopped at Eboli, the works of these writers were tremendously popular in early postwar Italy and achieved considerable recognition beyond national boundaries as well. Malaparte’s books were translated into all the main European languages, attaining immense popularity, particularly in Paris. According to contemporary records, he was the only Italian writer able to mirror d’Annunzio’s stunning success decades before in the French capital, paving the way for other Italian authors such as Moravia, Vittorini, and Piovene.82 Bruno Romani, the correspondent for the newspaper Il Tempo, significantly reported: “The translation of Malaparte’s Kaputt meant, for literature, what Rome, Open City meant for our cinema.”83 In addition to Paris—still then the cultural capital of Europe—these books were also successful overseas. In those years, Berto’s The Sky Is Red, together with the subsequent The Brigand (1951), sold about two million copies in the USA and the USSR.84 In light of this data, it is remarkable that these texts and their authors played such a marginal role in postwar Italian literature and culture. Or rather, how official records, anthologies, and scholarly research about early postwar Italy omitted or just dismissed them without a thorough critical appraisal.85\n\n19571-Baldasso_AgainstRedemption.indd 16\n\n10/3/22 11:21 AM\n\nIntroduction: Ruins and Debris of a Contested History | 17\n\nCommenting on history (and memory) formation in the aftermath of historic events, anthropologist Michel-­Rolph Trouillot concludes: “Silences are inherent in history because any single event enters history with some of its constituting parts missing.”86 The memory and the formation of a public discourse on the military defeat in Italy—with all its exclusions— has been the focus of a considerable body of scholarly work recently.87 My research strives to illuminate the moment of interpretative fluidity, in which the intellectuals who addressed the “missing constituting parts” of redemptive narratives of Italian history were still active players in the cultural—and literary—field. Most of the testimonies of ex-­Fascists spared no effort to underplay their personal involvement in the regime by trivializing the Fascist ventennio as a whole (e.g., Indro Montanelli, Here They Do Not Rest, 1945); or by tracing the personal conversion to the new anti-­Fascist agenda as a redemptive journey (e.g., Ruggero Zangrandi’s The Long Journey, 1948), setting influential standards for the aforementioned “patterns of conversion.”88 This widespread attitude was sustained by a “well-­established journalistic-­literary tradition [that] contributed to the diffusion of an image of the days that followed the fall of Fascism as the revelation of the substantive extraneousness of the Italians to the regime,” as La Rovere puts it.89 It is no surprise, then, that in a review of Malaparte’s The Skin published in 1950, Giovanni Spadolini complains about the absence of a “literature of the defeat” in Italy like the one that characterized Germany’s defeat in the Great War: “In the great swarm of memorials, of confessions and defenses (useful or useless, stingy or generous), it seemed almost as if our writers were restrained from or afraid of drawing inspiration from collective life in the years of the defeat and invasion.”90 During the armed Resistance against Nazi and Fascist forces, the stories of the partisan struggles were mushrooming in journals and newspapers in the form of the “chronicle.” For its alleged lack of rhetorical embellishment, this genre was then codified by Marxist literary critics in the journal Società as the most apt way to represent the heroism as well as the harshness of the Resistance.91 The genre gave voice and literary authority to a multitude of individual stories that, considered together, could establish the new civil epic of anti-­Fascist Italy. The real protagonist of all these stories was the Italian people, and the chronicles had also the merit of echoing a specifically Italian literary tradition, born in the middle ages, in an historical moment when the official doctrine of Communism in Italy was adopting a national agenda. Philip Cooke affirms the centrality of the Resistance short story for postwar Italian literature.92 Drawing from a 1949 article by Calvino,93 he also\n\n19571-Baldasso_AgainstRedemption.indd 17\n\n10/3/22 11:21 AM\n\n18 | Introduction: Ruins and Debris of a Contested History\n\nargues that the partisan short stories stand for a particular case of literature for the masses. Moreover, these stories instituted the rhetorical paradigms that characterized the postwar representation of the period, beginning with the parallel between the Risorgimento and the Resistance, in which the latter was considered a historic completion of the former. Cooke comments: There is, in other words, a “carry forward” effect that sees the topoi and language used in that period, for a particular purpose (that of encouraging morale and a sense of group identity), percolating into another period, when the Resistance was effectively over, but other battles were taking place.94\n\nThe persistence of past historical models profoundly impacted each narrative about a possible collective future. Recent events were interpreted within a framework that had a long cultural tradition. Among the many aspects of this complex milieu, two main trends deeply impacted public and intellectual discourses. First, the memory of the Resistance obliterated the collective consent to Mussolini’s regime. The two years of the civil war were characterized by the violent victimization of Italian people: in the aftermath of WWII, this traumatic memory took center stage. As a consequence, Italians’ quotidian acceptance of—if not approval or open collaboration with—the crimes perpetrated by the Fascist state over twenty years of rule was relegated to the background. The partisans became a synecdoche for the Italian people as a whole, although they were a small, albeit praiseworthy, minority. Second, as Fogu poignantly observes, a crucial feature of the memorialization-­historicization process of this difficult past was that “the replacement of the biennio for the ventennio in public memory took place in forms that were absorbed and transfigured from Fascist historical culture itself.”95 Once again, at stake here is not only the political and institutional continuity between Fascism and post-­Fascism but also the persistence of the rhetorical and literary tradition that was exalted and exacerbated by the Fascist regime. After all, as Guri Schwarz sharply stated, The anti-­Fascism of the very early republican period was also an instrument of sociocultural stabilization; it was bent to the need to emerge from the war without breaking too sharply with the past and constituted the principal anchor of the political system.96\n\nThis rhetorical tradition is not an exclusive Italian specialty: “From the beginning of time,” writes Léon Blum from his confinement after the collapse of the Third Republic in France, “national calamity has been linked with the\n\n19571-Baldasso_AgainstRedemption.indd 18\n\n10/3/22 11:21 AM\n\nIntroduction: Ruins and Debris of a Contested History | 19\n\nidea of sin and error, and with its natural extension: contrition, expiation and redemption.”97 Evoked already by Forcella in his diaries as constituting what he calls “the Bildungsroman of the anti-­Fascist canon,” these tropes draw heavily from Christian—especially Catholic—practices and institutions. Transferred into the arena of national accomplishments, they set the standard for the collective redemption promised by the ideologies of the modern nation-­state. As Alberto Banti and Emilio Gentile have documented,98 both the birth of the Italian state during the Risorgimento and the Fascist totalitarian regime actively sustained and were backed by a religion of the fatherland whose tropes employ undertones of Christian liturgy. Presented as a revolution, the Secondo Risorgimento trope displayed a rhetorical continuity with recent and more distant pasts. Signaling rhetorical continuity is not the same as leveling the divergent ideologies of the Italian nation that confronted each other in the 1943–1945 civil war. Fascist ideology was defeated in 1945 after its political collapse on July 25, 1943. Nevertheless, its historicist rhetoric, which envisioned present suffering as an expiation necessary for future redemption from the mistakes of the past, survived in the parties of the newborn parliamentarian democracy. In fact, every war undertaken by the Italian state since the Risorgimento was promoted as redemption for past sins and errors. Leaving aside the propaganda surrounding the two world wars,99 according to the socialist Giovanni Pascoli, the 1911 Italo-­Turkish war was the “triumphant and redemptive march” of the new proletarian nation, whereas the 1935 invasion of Ethiopia was repeatedly depicted in Mussolini’s speeches as “the redemptive war.”100 The ideology of the State as the vehicle for Italy’s and Italians’ historical redemption supported the liberal and Fascist regimes through a figural reading of the past as the foreshadowing of the present—another trait with remote origins in Christian hermeneutics. After the war, this ideology yielded to a more personal, almost intimate narrative. As in Zangrandi’s widely read memoir, the “long journey through Fascism” to the new secular faith of Communism or to the return to Catholicism evolved into a widespread pattern of conversion. According to La Rovere, this deeply personal yet collective process of atonement developed into the required token necessary to gain access to the new postwar society and its parties—in particular for the younger intellectual generations.101 The secular redemption advocated by the PCI, a party that presented itself as the heir to the long-­lasting Ri­ sorgimento tradition, was at odds with the repentance and the return to orthodoxy required by the Christian Democrats. The Catholic ranks followed the lines dictated already in 1937 by Pope Pius XII in the encyclical Divini\n\n19571-Baldasso_AgainstRedemption.indd 19\n\n10/3/22 11:21 AM\n\n20 | Introduction: Ruins and Debris of a Contested History\n\nRedemptoris, in which Communism was proclaimed a “false messianism.”102 Still, both sides retained collective as well as individual features that were not mutually exclusive, as the persistence of a Catholic mindset and traditional social habits in Communist regions showed.103 The issue of personal responsibility could be absorbed into a new narrative, especially for those who believed in and actively contributed to the Fascist regime, as well as soldiers who fought and killed for a cause that was now discredited and stigmatized. This narrative enabled traumatized veterans to make sense of what they had experienced during the war, often from the perspective of both the perpetrator and the victim. With its neutral connotation, implying something neither negative nor positive, the Italian word “reduce” conveys much more accurately the ambiguity of their moral position than the English term “survivor.” These soldiers lived through the war and its violence, yet the designation “reduce” does not indicate whether they were the agents or recipients of violence. It is no surprise, then, that this word appears so often in postwar Italian culture.104 For most partisans, the war was not targeted only at the liberation of the national territory from what they deemed as illegitimate occupiers. They also fought for a new social equality against the old elites who supported Fascism for decades. As Claudio Pavone argues in his now classic A Civil War: A History of the Italian Resistance (1991), class struggle and revolution were pivotal in a war in which ideology played such a key role.105 In other words, the anti-­Fascist idea of national revolution as collective redemption initially clashed with the Catholic concept of religious restoration through the intimate pattern of “contrition, expiation and redemption.” After Fascism and its disastrous war, redemption could only come with a radically renewed society. In this broader perspective, violence also acquired different meanings—and a different accountability. Resistance literature, as Robert Gordon has poignantly argued, was fundamental in shaping this new discourse of violence, proposing narratives of “good” partisan violence—a heroic struggle for liberation against overwhelming odds, for the good of the nation (or group or class)—as opposed to the “bad” violence—the violence of pure power and oppression—of the Nazis and Fascists. In more interesting cases, however, writers showed an acute awareness, well before historians opened up this issue, of the moral difficulty of narratives of good violence.106\n\nNarratives of “good” violence, often in the form of the Resistance “short story,” directly contributed to the formation of a public memory of the period.\n\n19571-Baldasso_AgainstRedemption.indd 20\n\n10/3/22 11:21 AM\n\nIntroduction: Ruins and Debris of a Contested History | 21\n\nHowever, canonized writers such as Cesare Pavese, Italo Calvino, or, later on, Beppe Fenoglio and Luigi Meneghello resisted univocal and consolatory interpretations of war’s violence. In their nuanced accounts, they exposed the personal and collective contradictions of the civil struggle.107 Moreover, the public discourse regarding the Resistance and the ensuing selective memory sidelined not only the morally justified violence perpetrated by anti-­Fascist forces but also the impressive amount of violence and wreckage caused by Allied intervention and occupation of Italian territory. In fact, Allied bombings did not stop after the armistice. The new air warfare aimed at exporting freedom to Fascist countries through the extensive bombings of civilian targets. With a self-­indulgent rhetorical abuse, the Allies named the new strategy “wings of democracy.” More realistically, historian Leonardo Paggi described it as “openly terroristic behavior.”108 As Gordon has stressed, a significant number of Italian writers were keenly aware of the moral difficulty of narratives of good violence. This awareness did not avoid the emergence of two main problems characterizing the intellectual production of early postwar Italy—two questions easily transformed into stereotypes in popular discourse. First, a significant consequence of the aforementioned redemptive patterns was the collective victimization of Italians, with the risk of belittling responsibility or even clearing the country’s wrongdoing in WWII. The second issue is not at all alien to this collective victimization, engaging some of the nonconformist writers who actively contributed to this kind of literature. By overtly admitting national defeat, Malaparte and Berto gave voice to a discontent that was silenced in conventional Resistance narratives, yet they also occupied a controversial position because of their collaboration with the regime. Their problematic situation resulted in the alleged inability to acknowledge the moral accountability of their act of writing, as they had been responsible in prima persona for the construction of a Fascist culture through their intellectual, journalistic, and literary work, often endorsing its imperialist and racist political agenda. “Every society experiences defeat in its own way,” claims Wolfgang Schivelbusch in a comparative study on national responses to military setbacks; “a state of unreality—or dreamland—is invariably the first of these.”109 The collapse of a defeated regime produces a massive psychological strain on the population. The destruction of the regime’s symbols by the same people who enthusiastically applauded its achievements in better times is an eloquent sign of this stress, not just of the ephemeral euphoria of regained freedom.110 This state of unreality follows the disappearance of the overwhelming presence of the political in every aspect of private and collective life, a\n\n19571-Baldasso_AgainstRedemption.indd 21\n\n10/3/22 11:21 AM\n\n22 | Introduction: Ruins and Debris of a Contested History\n\ncharacteristic of totalitarian regimes. This existential and historical void cannot but lead to a traumatic break with the past. The resulting trauma is not only a personal catastrophe but also the painful individual participation in a collective bereavement—the loss of a fantasy of omnipotence that characterized the psychological life of individuals and of the masses under the regime. In Freudian terms, this loss is characterized not by the mourning of an external object’s deprivation, but with the melancholy resulting from an emptying of the self. This experience corresponds to the impossibility of reflecting one’s own narcissism in an external—in this case collective— mirror. Reflecting on the work of mourning in postwar Germany, Eric Santner concludes that one fairly common strategy of circumventing this complex layering of mourning tasks (and thereby remaining within the closure of narcissism) was to identify with the victim, to become the one who helplessly and innocently suffered the deceptions and ravages of the fascist utopia as well as the destruction wrought by the allied forces.111\n\nIn spite of the obvious differences, a parallel can be drawn in the Italian situation, in which the identification with the victim frequently became a substitution for mourning and a defense against historical guilt. The traumatic break from the collapse of Fascism caused a wound so profound in collective imagination and personal experience that, as many commentators signaled, the debate over the nation almost disappeared in the months directly following the end of the war.112 It was only to reappear when Italian politics converged around positions in line with the new international Cold War opposition before the 1948 general elections.113 Such a resounding void is distinctively relevant, as it occurred when a shared idea of the nation could finally be negotiated for the first time in more than twenty years, during which the hegemonic power in charge had a monopoly over its meaning. Literature, once again, strove to fill this void. No writer in Italy denounced the postwar collective symbolic identification with the victim like Carlo Emilio Gadda did. As he writes in Eros and Priapus, “The narcissistic lie is, in the course of history, what the dissipation of the individual is in private life. It consists in denying a series of true facts that are not welcome back.”114 Gadda’s contentious pamphlet was written in 1944–1945 but was deemed unpublishable at the time. Defying literary genres, political prudence, and (neo)realist poetics, Eros and Priapus pursues with unparalleled verbal violence an auto-­da-­fé of Fascism and of the widespread popular cult of the Duce, which persisted long after his death. To this end, Gadda’s writing\n\n19571-Baldasso_AgainstRedemption.indd 22\n\n10/3/22 11:21 AM\n\nIntroduction: Ruins and Debris of a Contested History | 23\n\ncannot be but an “act of conscience”—that is, a painful excavation of the individual impulses and collective desire, national conformism, and violent egotism that consigned Italy and Europe to Mussolini and Hitler, and reduced both to a landscape of “dreadful debris” (paventosa macerie).115 Countering any consoling identification with the victim, Gadda claims with another expressionist image that his own writing of history is the “poor act of someone who holds a lamp up to the corpse’s face, sending cockroaches scurrying out into every direction of the night.”116 Mussolini’s regime placed the supremacy of the Italian nation at the center of its public discourse. Communists and Christian Democrats featured policies that were transnational in their scope but acted with a national agenda. In the early postwar, an open confrontation over the Italian nation was avoided, particularly before the exclusion of the Communist Party from the government in 1947 by the Christian Democrats, up until then allied in the name of the common national cause. With the sanction of the Liberals and the historical justifications formulated by Croce, Italy before Fascism became the true expression of the nation, in continuity with a historicist vision that preferred to elide responsibilities and gray zones, for the sake of a supposedly higher national interest—to which the PCI and the authoritative leader Palmiro Togliatti “strategically” adhered, condemning itself to political marginalization. This complex scenario enriches our understanding of the “political wrong”—as Rancière suggested—of the literary works of Morante, Moravia, Brancati, Berto, Flaiano, Carlo Levi, and Malaparte during the transition to democracy. Together with the other protagonists of these pages, they bear witness to the exceptional intellectual season occasioned in Italy upon the downfall of Mussolini and concluded with the institutionalization of party politics. Their work raised a wealth of questions that postwar narratives of redemption left unanswered. Specific concerns should now be addressed following individual intellectual trajectories or close readings of the most significant publications, as the general plan of my research will display. Plan of the Work\n\nMy examination of each writer’s voice in these debates blends intellectual history with analysis of language and rhetorical discourses. I investigate the trajectory of each author through their different literary practices, at times privileging journalistic production over more canonical forms like novels, as in the cases of Moravia and Piovene. This methodology finds confirmation in the range of these writers’ works. Their literary production was not meant to be an organic corpus; rather, it was an ongoing experiment with genres\n\n19571-Baldasso_AgainstRedemption.indd 23\n\n10/3/22 11:21 AM\n\n24 | Introduction: Ruins and Debris of a Contested History\n\nand languages, spanning from cultural commentaries to theater, from memoirs to fiction. The plots of their books or short stories often inspired film adaptations. Brancati, Flaiano, and Berto, for instance, wrote several screenplays. The material uncertainty of the time often affected the ephemeral sense of ideas and debates, from book projects to journalistic contributions. Commenting on the literary achievements of Berto’s The Sky Is Red, Andrea Zanzotto suggested a crucial dimension for my analysis. Zanzotto points out the distinctive success of the novel’s language: “a ‘language of transition’ that turns out in some way to be self-­sufficient, precisely in its transience.”117 According to the poet, only a few works during the transition elaborated a language that, in its “self-­sufficiency,” could mirror the atmosphere of the period. The attempt to articulate an autonomous language, affected neither by past models nor by any redemptive rhetoric, will then be one of the main focuses of this book. Without indulging in any determinism, the need to devise new literary and rhetorical practices reveals the inherent difficulty to make sense of a troubled and traumatic past. This multifold approach enables me to enlarge the scope of my investigation, focusing on topics addressed only partially by canonized authors, and with the further possibility of contextualizing their claims through different perspectives. It also allows me to recover the dialogical spontaneity of the political disagreement and of the “excess of speech” characterizing the transition. Lastly, such methodology leads me to conclusions that go beyond the political and poetic development of singular personalities by illuminating the intellectual exchange they had with minor figures—at the same time emphasizing the originality of specific works. Literary critic Alberto Asor Rosa noted how little discussion there was in Italian anti-­Fascist culture on the nature of the totalitarian state.118 The first chapter of this book challenges this thesis by retracing the contributions that tackled this fundamental issue and situating the Italian case within the larger totalitarian paradigm. Allegedly, this assumed lack of discussion was due to a willingness to avoid a direct confrontation with Stalin’s USSR, in a period in which many European intellectuals were looking at Soviet Russia as the model for future society, thereby refusing to consider the conspicuous signs of its pitfalls.119 This might also have been the reason why Italian texts directly addressing this problem were then completely overlooked. Books such as The Totalitarian State (1947) by Vittorio Zincone and The Volga Rises in Europe (1943) and Das Kapital (1949) by Curzio Malaparte are not comparable to the crass anti-­Communist polemic à la Montanelli or Longanesi.120 As intellectuals who fervently adhered to the Fascist totalitarian state, they\n\n19571-Baldasso_AgainstRedemption.indd 24\n\n10/3/22 11:21 AM\n\nIntroduction: Ruins and Debris of a Contested History | 25\n\nexperienced this political phenomenon from within, and were actively involved in the organization of consensus. Finally, by retrieving the great deal of contributions that Alberto Moravia published in the Liberation press, I retrace the evolution of his thinking on totalitarianism. Between his pamphlet Hope: Christianity and Communism (1944) and Man as An End (published 1953, but written in 1946), Moravia develops coherent arguments against political utopias by pinpointing the “necessary violence” that revolutionary practices have historically embraced.121 The second chapter examines the working through of the past by three former Fascist writers: Giuseppe Berto, Guido Piovene, and Vitaliano Brancati. The common thread tying together their disparate experiences after the war is the literary transfiguration of their previous commitment to Mussolini’s regime around the admission of personal responsibility. Through successful novels such as Berto’s The Sky Is Red and Brancati’s Beautiful Antonio, or an intense journalistic activity as in the case of Piovene, these writers attempted to work out a new language reflecting the burdensome responsibility of their past choices. Their efforts—at times ill-­fated as in the case of Piovene—stand out in the general postwar scenario. Most ex-­Fascist intellectuals narrated their past involvement with Fascism as a short-­lived moment of perdition before their ideological conversion to the new postwar credos. The third chapter revolves around the rejection of what philosopher Guido De Ruggiero calls the “fetishism of history,” the historical imaginary exacerbated by the Fascist regime that conditioned public discourse even after its fall. Opposition to historicism—heralded by Croce as the teleological progress of freedom—was widespread in the early postwar. Still, only authors who grounded their disagreement on the tragic and traumatic experiences of recent history fleshed out its unequivocal refusal. For them, the rejection of Fascism on a political level could only accompany the refusal of historicism in the cultural realm. Umberto Saba’s Shortcuts and Very Short Stories was the first volume in Italy to argue for an alternative genealogy of Fascist violence, tracing it back to the nationalist and imperialist myths that constituted bourgeois and liberal culture. The book thus called attention to the civilizational break constituted by the genocidal attack on European Jewry. With her novel Lies and Sorcery, Elsa Morante expands Saba’s poetic insights into a radical reconsideration of traditional society based on privilege and its bearing on present Italy even beyond Fascism. Traditional gender and racial bias that still haunt the present are at the center of another outstanding novel: Ennio Flaiano’s A Time to Kill, which harrowingly recollects the ghosts of Italy’s colonialism.\n\n19571-Baldasso_AgainstRedemption.indd 25\n\n10/3/22 11:21 AM\n\n26 | Introduction: Ruins and Debris of a Contested History\n\nThe fourth chapter concentrates on Carlo Levi, possibly the most far-­ reaching in his refusal of past models among anti-­Fascist intellectuals. Levi establishes an oppositional polarity with Malaparte: The two develop quite antithetical responses from their common dismissal of the historicist rhetoric inherited from the Fascist and liberal regimes. The chapter examines how Levi elaborated the most consequential critique of the totalitarian state to appear in Italy in those years. Levi’s cosmopolitan experiences of Libertarian Judaism, political activity in the socialist-­liberal Action Party, and European culture between the two wars conjure up an unpredictable empathy with subaltern and marginal classes in his Christ Stopped at Eboli.122 With stunning poetic intensity, the memoir subverts the stability of the many dichotomies of Western political thought, advocating a new polity based on inclusion, autonomy, and self-­government. Furthermore, his other neglected texts Fear of Freedom and The Watch feature, respectively, as the first critical theory of totalitarianism in Italy and a rebuttal of the models of time, history, and politics that sustained the new party system that took power after the transition.123 My investigation concludes with Curzio Malaparte, who programmatically set out to narrate the Italian defeat as an integral component of the general collapse of European civilization. Usually quickly dismissed for his Fascist past, Malaparte was an ingenious and nonconformist intellectual whose outstanding historical sensibility was rivaled only by his narcissism. As Milan Kundera contends, Malaparte invented with his best-­known novels Kaputt and The Skin, “a form that is totally a new thing,” able to express the tragic contrast between the destructive power of modern technology and the fragility of creaturely life.124 With his representational prowess, Mala­ parte tackled all the main concerns of the discussion on recent Italian history: the rejection of past models, the unrestrained technological violence of the Nazi as well as of the Allied bombings, a critique of the centrality of the State and totalitarianism, the racial agenda of modern power, and the memory of the destruction of European Jewry.\n\n19571-Baldasso_AgainstRedemption.indd 26\n\n10/3/22 11:21 AM\n\n1\n\nAfter Italian Totalitarianism\n\nThe Italian Experience within the Totalitarian Paradigm\n\nIn his 1982 essay, influential literary critic Alberto Asor Rosa highlighted how early postwar Italian culture lacked a thorough discussion of totalitarianism: In this Italian anti-­Fascist and Resistance culture, the importance of antitotalitarian polemic is unexpectedly limited and circumscribed, in a way that is very different than what had happened or was happening in those years in the area of European anti-­Fascist culture. [. . .] On this front there is never an organic refusal of power or the state.1\n\nThe passage outlines the theoretical limits of the anti-­Fascist debate, in a period when the intellectual class that served the regime was almost seamlessly absorbed into the democratic state. Remarkably, the term “totalitarian” was first coined and employed by anti-­Fascists in Italy in the early 1920s to denounce Mussolini for his illiberal practices.2 The Duce replied by reusing the concept of “totalitarian state” as a boastful description of his political ambitions and accomplishments. His notorious aphorism is in this sense quite fitting: “All within the state, nothing outside the state, nothing against the state.”3 For Fascist ideology, the State was the founding principle, the ultimate goal, and the only political reality. The Fascist party itself was, in the late 1930s, absorbed and integrated into the body of the State, unlike the institutional developments in Nazi Germany.4 The totalitarian state and its unconstrained monopoly of power and violence were by no means a negligible legacy of Mussolini’s dictatorship. Having linked its destiny with Fascism, Italy’s state apparatus was widely discredited in the early postwar period, eliciting an extensive popular disaffection to its institutions. The results of this calamitous embrace are still vivid in today’s political debate, featuring disagreement, contrastive memories and fostering adversarial perceptions of national belonging.5 Why, then, did anti-­Fascist intellectuals refrain from conducting an extensive\n\n19571-Baldasso_AgainstRedemption.indd 27\n\n10/3/22 11:21 AM\n\n28 | After Italian Totalitarianism\n\nanalysis of such a burdensome heritage? What about the intellectuals who did not fully identify as anti-­Fascist? After all, as Paolo Alatri compellingly wrote in the journal La Nuova Europa, just two months after the end of the conflict, Fascism died because it hadn’t learned how to keep its promises, not because the promises themselves were revealed to be monstrous. It died because it hadn’t managed to offer compensation for sacrifices solicited and imposed, not because the sacrifices themselves were discovered to be nefarious and the compensation criminal [. . .]. To this day, the great mass of Italian nationalists would like a politics of “prestige,” while they should be thinking only of a mea culpa, which in political terms translates into the radical substitution of the Fascist class for the anti-­Fascist one, in the harshest of purges.6\n\nAs historians Filippo Focardi and Ruth Ben-­Ghiat maintain, the totalitarian features of Fascist rule in Italy were already being downplayed in the 1940s. The comparison with Nazi terror and genocidal policies across Europe further aided this minimizing process.7 The reasons were multifold, since political convenience intertwined with refashioning existing stereotypes by Italians and Allies alike. The stakes were indeed high for both: from Italy’s strategic relevance in the new geopolitical configuration, to the necessity of the continuity of the state, to the fear of a Communist takeover—all counterarguments condemning Alatri’s firm appeal to political marginality. A new wave of (old) essentialisms about the supposedly “defective” Italian character led to a selective memory, if not an utter reticence, regarding Fascism’s active role in the war and related crimes. These clichés depicted Italians as passive victims, prompting a general forgetting of their role as perpetrators. Italian intervention in WWII is still remembered today with a mix of passiveness and insubordination.8 Collective memory coalesced around the terrible years of the Italian civil war, foreign occupation of national soil, or painful episodes removed from their original context, such as the disastrous Italian campaign in Russia.9 Institutional celebrations concentrated on the memory of these traumatic events, obliterating Fascist aggression and occupation of African states, Greece and the Balkans, and Southern France.10 The Italian racial campaigns that culminated in the 1938 anti-­Semitic laws are a shameful case in point.11 Only recently, prompted in part by the migration (and detention) crises in the Mediterranean of the last decades, public debate in Italy has openly addressed the neglected histories of the diaspora, forced mobility, and\n\n19571-Baldasso_AgainstRedemption.indd 28\n\n10/3/22 11:21 AM\n\nAfter Italian Totalitarianism | 29\n\ncolonial violence that feature among the most enduring legacies of Mussolini’s regime.12 At the time, however, influential and internationally acclaimed anti-­ Fascist intellectuals such as Benedetto Croce and diplomats such as Carlo Sforza spared no effort in minimizing Italian agency in WWII, especially the popular participation in the regime’s imperial campaigns.13 In public speeches and articles published abroad, such as “The Fascist Germ Still Lives,” which appeared in the New York Times on November 28, 1943, Croce depicts the totalitarian mentality as inherently alien to Italians, who are intrinsically more “human” than their German counterparts. Fascism, he argued, was a European phenomenon, not exclusively an Italian one. While Nazi barbarity could be traced back to the long history of the German Sonderweg (“Special Path”), Fascism in Italy was only a temporary illness. After this bout, Croce concluded, Italians had developed strong antibodies.14 Tropes labeling Italians as inherently good began surfacing in books such as Carlo Sforza’s The Real Italians: A Study in European Psychology. Published in English in the United States in 1942, following its first release in Montreal as Les Italiens tels qu’ils sont one year earlier, Sforza’s essay aimed to rehabilitate Italians and their country in the eyes of foreign public opinion by countering the Fascist imperial rhetoric of Romanità. Interestingly, the clichés displayed in these publications reiterate many aspects of Fascist propaganda, especially the 1920s Strapaese (“Super-­country”) movement or the effort by the ideologues of the regime to spell out the difference between—and the superiority of—Italian totalitarianism and its German analog. In one instance, Sforza argues that “the peculiar genius of Italy is particularist; the opposite of particularism is fascism, which is totalitarian by necessity.”15 These clichés have a long history in Italy and abroad, which cannot be recounted here.16 Such influential assumptions deeply affected the understanding of Italian involvement in WWII and the Holocaust for decades to come, and can be traced even in books such as Hannah Arendt’s Eichmann in Jerusalem.17 Liberal anti-­Fascists did not develop the intellectual tools for a real reconsideration of Italian totalitarianism. As in the cases of Croce and Sforza, they simply declared it alien to the Italian character. A public debate on this issue would have entailed for liberals a thorough reappraisal of the conception of the state at the base of their political views. For decades, the regime’s propaganda hailed the 1922 March on Rome as the foundational event of a new era. In reality, Fascism crushed the liberal state in Italy without abruptly breaking with its past traditions but by taking over its institutions one by\n\n19571-Baldasso_AgainstRedemption.indd 29\n\n10/3/22 11:21 AM\n\n30 | After Italian Totalitarianism\n\none and depriving them of any legal and political relevance—beginning with the parliament. Liberals, however, were hardly representative of the disparate anti-­Fascist forces. Among the partisans, for instance, revolutionary culture was widespread—and the major force among the armed resistance were the Communists. Asor Rosa’s remark on how anti-­Fascist culture avoided addressing the legacy of totalitarianism is still valid today when we consider that a large number of Fascist intellectuals and bureaucrats shifted to Communism. Here, the cult of the State was not at the forefront of the ideological debate. A public debate on totalitarianism would have engendered an implicit critique of the Soviet state, in which Italian Communists placed all their hopes for the future. Galvanized by the victory over Nazism, in which the Soviets bore the heaviest military burden, Stalin’s USSR was untouchable to anti-­ Fascist intellectuals before the onset of the Cold War.18 Enzo Traverso recalls how few European intellectuals (among them Gaetano Salvemini) denounced Stalinism in the late 1930s in the midst of the Great Terror in the USSR. This position did not change after the temporary disappointment of the Molotov-­Ribbentrop Pact. Traverso also reports how, during the conflict, American war propaganda depicted Stalin as the good “oncle Joseph” and how difficult it was for George Orwell to find a publisher in 1941 for his book Animal Farm, a biting political satire of Stalin’s USSR.19 Among the writers who would later embrace the PCI, Alberto Moravia was one of few in the immediate postwar to openly address the issue of the state and its impact on modern life. The principal concerns of his essay Man as an End (published in 1953 but written in 1946) pertain much more to moral than to political philosophy.20 In his book, Moravia criticizes the extreme rationalization and politicization of every aspect of an individual’s life, a widespread condition he interprets as a consequence of modernization. In particular, the author focuses on what he calls “instrumental rationality,” the modern habitus of perceiving human beings as a means to an end. Man as an End firmly rejects the ideological deployments of such habitus, aimed at correcting both individual and collective life, along abstract systems of beliefs. Moravia’s arguments in this essay feature evident political undertones, for he sees the massive implementation of “instrumental rationality” as one of the major characteristics of totalitarian regimes. His Man as an End contributes to European thought’s return to humanism after the war.21 Although the essay’s anti-­Fascist agenda is evident, its main argument implicitly criticizes Communist ideas. This might have been one of the reasons behind the author’s decision to delay the publication of the piece, written\n\n19571-Baldasso_AgainstRedemption.indd 30\n\n10/3/22 11:21 AM\n\nAfter Italian Totalitarianism | 31\n\nright after the war, until 1953. In fact, Man as an End is better understood in the context of Moravia’s other works of the transition years, from his fiction to his hectic collaboration with liberation newspapers and journals. In these neglected pieces, he develops arguments that disavow the myths of social palingenesis that characterize totalitarianism.22 I will return to Moravia more extensively at the end of this chapter, after my examination of the intellectuals who tackled the role of the state directly in their writing and did not avoid an open confrontation with totalitarianism. Among them, the most radical is undoubtedly Carlo Levi. His political and literary elaborations of the problem of the state, from Fear of Freedom to The Watch, constitute an unconventional theory of totalitarianism and a fierce critique of early postwar Italian politics. Levi’s intellectual influence during the transition was huge: in the subsequent decades, the rhetorical and political charge of his original position would be conveniently overshadowed by the international success of Christ Stopped at Eboli. Levi’s polemic against the political use of Italy’s past will lead us to new queries, which will be discussed at length in the fourth chapter. For now, it is important to note that Asor Rosa’s claim should be at least corrected. While no extensive interpretations of totalitarianism appeared in Italy that could match, for example, the works of the German-­Jewish diaspora in New York, valuable texts published in those years approached the problem from alternative points of view, opening the debate to the Italian experience within the totalitarian paradigm. In these instances, new and old stereotypes coexist and intermingle with outstanding insights. Noteworthy analyses of totalitarianism came from intellectuals who knew the mechanisms of the totalitarian state all too well, having worked for years within the apparatus of the Fascist regime. In their postwar writings, they not only condemned the political theology created by Fascism but also crossed into new territory where (most) anti-­Fascist intellectuals were not ready, or able, to venture—at least not until USSR’s invasion of Hungary in 1956. These former Fascist intellectuals linked totalitarianism with Stalinism: the dismissal of the totalitarian experience under Mussolini grounded and justified their rejection of Communism. A controversial protagonist in this neglected story is Curzio Malaparte, “Fascism’s most formidable writer,” as Piero Gobetti called him in the 1920s.23 Malaparte’s postwar skepticism of any narrative of national regeneration was profoundly rooted in his perception of the historical failure of European civilization. Malaparte would develop his unconventional outlook through the polemical depiction of Nazi—and Allied—occupied Europe in Kaputt and The Skin, examined in the concluding chapter. However, Malaparte’s\n\n19571-Baldasso_AgainstRedemption.indd 31\n\n10/3/22 11:21 AM\n\n32 | After Italian Totalitarianism\n\nearly 1940s articles for Prospettive, the journal he directed, and his reports from the Eastern Front, which he collected in a single volume with the significant title The Volga Rises in Europe in 1943, display how he articulated an ambivalent autonomy from Fascist culture since the beginning of the war. In fact, Mussolini’s regime had barely tolerated his identification as a self-­proclaimed “Protestant” Fascist—someone who ambiguously blended intellectual nonconformism and political acquiescence for personal profit.24 Remarkably, Malaparte’s distance turned into a skeptical disavowal of totalitarianism and revolutionary politics during the transition period. His critique of the ideological aspects of Marxist doctrine takes center stage in his play Das Kapital (1948), in a moment when popular and intellectual support for Communist parties reached an apex all over Western Europe. Another little-­known contemporary commentator on totalitarianism was the journalist Vittorio Zincone. His essay The Totalitarian State (1947) offers a convincing comparative appraisal of totalitarian regimes and the political techniques employed by charismatic leaders such as Lenin, Stalin, Mussolini, and Hitler. Despite their differences, both Malaparte and Zincone spell out in their works how Communism was not the necessary solution of the historical impasse following WWII. Admittedly, the two authors’ intimate involvement in totalitarianism was far from innocent. In their writings, however, they transform their personal disillusion with Mussolini’s regime into a unique hermeneutic instrument. Malaparte and Zincone not only describe the impact of ideology on the body and mind of individuals, but they also explain the internal functioning of totalitarian political projects without downplaying their intrinsic violence. Anti-­Communist slurs were common among conservative or reactionary journalists in the early postwar. Once they conveniently minimized their past collaborations, some of them, like Guglielmo Giannini or Indro Montanelli, strove to foreground their newly acquired ideological independence. In their articles, they piled up populist slogans for a middle class that was wary of a Communist takeover. In this sense, historian Piergiorgio Zunino, pigeonholed Malaparte and Longanesi as “survivors” of the regime.25 Yet differences between the two authors are profound—especially on an ideological level—and telling. Despite conspicuous fluctuations, also inspired by Palmiro Togliatti’s initial benevolence towards him, Malaparte’s rejection of the Marxist teleological interpretation of history had little to do with a stubborn personal adhesion to Fascist ideology or a general contempt for anti-­Fascist ideals, as was the case in Longanesi. Giorgio Napolitano, President of the Italian Republic from 2006 to 2015, remembers in a recent interview how Malaparte’s\n\n19571-Baldasso_AgainstRedemption.indd 32\n\n10/3/22 11:21 AM\n\nAfter Italian Totalitarianism | 33\n\n1941 reports from the Eastern Front were received by young Communists like him as a call to arms.26 Whether or not intended by Malaparte, Napolitano’s recollections evidence the ideological fluidity of the period, in which personal disillusionment with Fascism mixed with the confused excitement of a forthcoming change of regime. Malaparte’s and Zincone’s critiques resulted from the working through of their autobiographical experience within the totalitarian state. Their refusal to embrace Marxism and its political party went hand in hand with another dissent—their resistance to the redemption and forgiveness offered by Catholic politics. This double aversion emerged in their writings once they realized that the sacralization of politics sustaining totalitarian states did not just constitute a political fallacy; it posed a grave threat to the lives of individuals and communities. Emilio Gentile developed this assessment further in his research on Fascist ideology and politics.27 The historian argues that the distinctive totalitarian aspects of a modern authoritarian regime such as Italian Fascism were mass mobilization and a conception of politics in which the political entity becomes the source of devotion and cult, organized around a system of beliefs, symbols, and rites. Today, these concepts are considered critical to describe the different, at time contrasting, practices of totalitarian regimes in Europe.28 Still, Malaparte, Zincone and Moravia insightfully developed similar considerations in the transition years in a highly personal way— through fictional and dialogic representations or journalistic writing with literary ambitions. Specters of a Revolutionary Past: Curzio Malaparte\n\nLike many intellectuals of the early twentieth century, Curzio Malaparte fully embraced the myth of the palingenetic war and fought in WWI, both in France and on the Italian front. A revolutionary at heart, he then enthusiastically adhered to Fascism, believing Mussolini’s movement to be the historic force capable of modernizing Italy and of creating “the new man”—the other nefarious myth of modernist politics.29 To that end, he also followed with increasing attention the Russian Revolution and the developments of Soviet society. As a correspondent for the daily La Stampa, he traveled to Russia in 1929 and successfully published in Paris two essays that analyzed the revolutions in Europe, sacrificing historical accuracy for the sake of his argument: Technique du coup d’état (1931) and Le bonhomme Lénine (1932). The books were censored in Italy and their author fell from grace, although the real reason behind this fall was his ill-­timed criticism of prominent Fascist figures such as Italo Balbo.30 In the early 1950s, Malaparte would\n\n19571-Baldasso_AgainstRedemption.indd 33\n\n10/3/22 11:21 AM\n\n34 | After Italian Totalitarianism\n\ncomment: “For the young Italian generations of 1919, Mussolini was their first love, the lover that betrayed them, on the moral (political, social, intellectual, artistic) level, with the old, reactionary generations (the monarchy, the church, big industry, the nobility).”31 After the personal shock of his confinement in 1933 for “anti-­Fascist activities abroad”—a fact that he would exaggerate after the war—Malaparte kept cynical and ambiguous proximity with the regime and its protagonists. The reasons for this behavior are multifold. On the one hand, the Fascist state was a major source of patronage for intellectuals; on the other, friendship with powerful figures of the regime granted him a mobility and an intellectual liberty otherwise impossible in Italy. This line of conduct was quite common under the dictatorship, particularly for authors who would later constitute the modern canon in Italy, such as Ungaretti, Pirandello, Vittorini, and Gadda.32 Only in the late 1930s, after his confinement, would Malaparte regain a reasonable degree of freedom as a public intellectual and journalist. Personal disillusions, including his failure to become a protagonist in Fascist Italy’s political debate, prompted him to dismiss any faith in revolutionary politics—a rejection that was confirmed by his witnessing of total war. In his works, he would then pursue a tragic understanding of history, thereby challenging postwar redemptive narratives. Nevertheless, the intellectual freedom he regained in the early 1940s as editor of the journal Prospettive and war correspondent for Corriere della Sera signaled an artistic independence that was rare under Fascism. His ambivalent and calculated detachment from Fascist cultural politics was based more on personal disappointment than on ethical grounds. Yet it sheds light on the regime’s ongoing erosion of consent, especially among the intellectual class that was summoned to support its military efforts. As Alatri would clarify in his 1945 article cited above, Fascism in Italy “died because it hadn’t learned how to keep its promises, not because the promises themselves were revealed to be monstrous.” Malaparte theorized his practice of artistic autonomy from Fascist cultural politics already in 1940—well before the fall of Mussolini. In “Our Sin,” an editorial published in 1940 for Prospettive, he ambiguously hints at the double feature of his—indeed of modern—writing: What counts the most in our literature [. . .] are not the pages written, so to speak, with black ink; it’s not the visible writing, but what is legible under the page, everything that is not a precise and perceptible sign [. . .] everything that is written with white ink. We all write with white ink. And what saves\n\n19571-Baldasso_AgainstRedemption.indd 34\n\n10/3/22 11:21 AM\n\nAfter Italian Totalitarianism | 35 our visible writing is exactly the completely modern awareness of perceiving, under the accepted pages, the thousand others unsaid, foregone, etc.33\n\nIn this excerpt, Malaparte describes his writing as a self-­concealment as much as an exposé, both features coexisting on the same page. Modernist writing is eminently self-­reflective and I believe that finding an allusion to Fascist censorship in this passage would be an overinterpretation. Still, through the metaphor of the “white ink,” Malaparte argues for the aut"
