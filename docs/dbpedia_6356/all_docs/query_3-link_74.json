        "text": "Media and translation has developed significantly. Since both disciplines presents communication across language, cultures and which has been developing as a major form of literary studies today. Now it is known truth that, translation is more than a linguistic exercise and Cinema is no longer a mere source of entertainment. This proposed paper look into the relevance of understanding cinema as a major form of literary criticism and its visual impact as well as its ideological implications on its audience, by examining Louis Althusser's conception of cinematic ideology. As we know cinema is not an innocent act or it is not created in vacuum. It is a reflection of the society most of the times. The intention is to exam the challenges and implications of cinemas which are produced based on real incidences which are taken place in Indian society. This paper attempts to examine the challenges and ideological implications by observing the 1947 India Pakistan Partition films mainly Deepa Mehta's Earth and Phoolan Devi's biography based film Bandit Queen. By analysing and examining above mentioned films tries to see the problems and challenges which occurred during the production of cinema which are based on real facts and its ideological implications are presented along with the entertainment. Finally it tries to see the changes in the actual facts/base material during translation of reality into cinema and its impact on nationality,\n\nIn this study, the Soviet animation cinema's ideological discourses, which showed the consequences and reflections of the political ideology of the era, were examined. In line with the findings, it was considered that these animated films constitute a kind of cultural memory that exhibits the political history and social culture of the Soviets. The article's ideological discourse analysis method was applied by considering Teun A. van Dijk's study titled Ideological Discourse Analysis. As part of this research, because ideological discourses were analyzed, only short films with propaganda content were regarded among Soviet animations, and the scope of the study was restricted. Furthermore, the date range taken about the films was the term of Soyuzmultfilm, the official animation studio of the Soviet Union. The films created by the studio, which began its actions in 1936 until the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, were taken into account. The conclusions of discourse analysis were evaluated according to the headings 'self-identity', 'activity', 'goal', 'norm and value', 'position and relation' and 'resource' mentioned in the article Ideological Discourse Analysis, and the ideological discourses in Soviet animated cinema were analyzed. Turkish: Sovyet Animasyon Çalışmalarında İdeolojik Söylem Çözümlemeleri Bu çalışmada, dönemin siyasal ideolojisinin etkilerini ve yansımalarını gösteren Sovyet animasyon sinemasının ürettiği ideolojik söylemler incelenmiş, bulunan bulgular doğrultusunda bu animasyon filmlerin Sovyetlerin siyasal tarihini ve toplumsal kültürünü yansıtan bir çeşit kültürel hafıza oluşturduğu irdelenmiştir. Makaledeki ideolojik söylem analizi yöntemi Teun A. van Dijk’in Ideological Discourse Analysis başlıklı makalesi dikkate alınarak uygulanmıştır. Çalışma kapsamında ideolojik söylemler incelendiği için Sovyet animasyonları arasında yalnızca propaganda içerikli olan kısa filmler ele alınmış ve çalışmanın kapsamı sınırlandırılmıştır. Ayrıca filmlerle ilgili alınan tarih aralığı Sovyetler Birliği’nin resmi animasyon stüdyosu olan Soyuzmultfilm dönemidir. 1936 yılında faaliyetlerine başlayan stüdyonun 1991 yılında Sovyetler Birliği’nin dağılmasına kadar geçen sürede ürettiği filmler dikkate alınmıştır. Söylem analizinde bulunan bulgular Ideological Discourse Analysis makalesinde belirtilen ‘öz-kimlik’, ‘aktivite’, ‘hedef’, ‘norm ve değer’, ‘konum ve ilişki’ ve ‘kaynak’ başlıkları üzerinden değerlendirilmiş ve Sovyet animasyon sinemasındaki ideolojik söylemler çözümlenmiştir.\n\nYouTube media is a media used by people of all ages, including children. Animation has become one of the most common shows watched by children. However, the show &quot;Nussa Official&quot; from the Youtube platform was accused of having issues of intolerance and radicalism. This study uses a qualitative approach with the method of reception analysis Stuart Hall, which categorizes into three types of acceptance .. The results show that public acceptance in accepting the issue of intolerance and radicalism have their respective perceptions. In accepting the issue of intolerance, none of the informants occupy a dominant hegemonic position, while in the case of radicalism, the informants are in all positions, namely dominant-hegemonic code, negotiated code and oppositional code.\n\nMedia plays a significant role in the reproduction and dissemination of government ideology due to its ability to reach billions of people. The aim of this study is to evaluate the first Turkish cartoon series “Pepee” in relation to the Turkish ruling party AKP’s ideology.

Furthermore, as ideology is a means by which cinema apparatus sutures audience within movie narration, the movie ideology and its relation with the given fantasy will be discussed as well.

Countries, nations and organisations adopt this tool to influence the minds of the masses in favour or against some individual or group. The current study attempts to investigate the anti-Pakistan sentiment as depicted in the film media, mainly in the Hollywood movies. It is hypothesised that a hostile and biased image of Pakistan is portrayed and represented in Hollywood cinema. Under the guise and garb of entertainment, film industries have become propaganda tools to serve vested interests of the powers that invest in the industry to malign Pakistan and to portray a negative image of the country. To unearth the hidden motives and to deconstruct the meanings encoded in the dialogues of the movies against Pakistan, Fairclough's 3 D model of critical discourse analysis is employed. The study examined five Hollywood movies (aired post 9/11), purposefully selected for the analysis. The dialogues pregnant with anti-Pakistan theme were chosen for the analysis. It was concluded that the movies are a deliberate attempt to represent Pakistan's stereotypical image as a terrorist state. It was further revealed that the purpose behind the antagonistic portrayal of Pakistan is to mutilate its impression across the globe. The study is an eye-opener for the Pakistani viewers of Hollywood cinema and is an attempt to make them able to detect the invisible powers working under the garb of entertainment and to counter their propaganda by not getting influenced.\n\nThe significance of movies in information dissemination and ideological creation through language is undeniable. This study aims to investigate how Hollywood movies and documentaries depict Muslims.
