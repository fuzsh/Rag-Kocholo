        "text": "How are ideologies, including binary opposites, explored in your chosen films?\n\nBoth Trainspotting (Danny Boyle, 1996) and This is England (Shane Meadows, 2007) depict life in the UK in the 1980s and 90s and deal with cultural aspects of life in these time periods. Themes of growing up in poverty and deprived urban environments, engaging in friendships, peer pressure and falling into the wrong crowd are evident in their narratives. These themes are portrayed through different ideological approaches taken by the filmmakers.\n\nIdeology is the attitudes, views and values deliberately presented to the audience by filmmakers either implicitly or explicitly, through the use of stereotypes and binary oppositions, like masculinity and femininity. In Stuart Hall’s theory of how audiences respond to ideological messages in film, he presents three types of reading: preferred (in which the audience accepts and agrees with the director’s intended meaning behind the film), oppositional (in which the audience rejects the intentions of the film) or negotiated (in which the audience accepts some messages and rejects others).\n\nTrainspotting (Danny Boyle, 1996) follows flawed but engaging young protagonist Mark Renton as he battles his addiction to heroin amongst a crowd of friends dealing with the same, or equally morally flawed, issues.\n\nA preferred reading of Trainspotting, having witnessed the progression of addicts throughout the film, will view the drug lifestyles of the main characters as ideologically unsound and undergo the same moral realisations as Renton’s character who by the end of the film concludes that there is nothing wrong with choosing life over the appealing, but also traumatic, life of drugs. Oppositional readings may be more inclined to accept the character’s initial positive response to drugs, failing to see the clear warnings against using them whilst a negotiated reading may acknowledge the problematic and unappealing sides of addiction but be filled with temptation regardless.\n\nTrainspotting defines youth culture of the 1990s by focusing on the influence that drugs have on the impressionable youth. From the opening sequence, it becomes clear that ideologies of drugs and addiction are the dominant focus of the film; a tracking shot takes us past female character Allison’s baby into a separate room before stabilising on a shot of the group of friends injecting heroine thus forcing us to focus on the youths and their engagement in drug culture. Boyle initially presents drugs as an alternative path to everyday boring capitalist life thus playing with the binary opposition of conformity and non-conformity as well as positive youth and decrepit old age as the youths engage in drug use and rave culture over responsibility, insisting they will never fall into the lifestyles of their parents whom they deem boring and miserable. The anti-materialistic and anti-consumerist sentiment becomes almost a political message. However, as the film progresses, the presentation of addiction becomes more dark and less ideological. To the characters, drugs are their lifeline; in one sequence Renton visits the “worst toilet in Scotland”, mise-en-scene sees the room is covered in brown and dark colours whilst the drugs in the scene are pure white, almost glowing, thus presenting them as the “light” in Renton’s life which is furthered by the surreal sequence that follows of him diving into the toilet to retrieve the drugs.\n\nRenton’s overdose acts as the ultimate indicator of the dangers of addiction; the use of point of view shots as he surreally descends into the carpet and when he is at the hospital and the nurses crowd over him in a panic force the audience into the position of a drug addict to allow us to see his dissent and undesirable loss of touch with reality, highlighted through the binary opposite of reality and surrealism, and feel personally revolted and uncomfortable by the prospect. Ironically, it is arguably the moment that we are forced into the perspective of Renton through camerawork, that we simultaneously begin to feel detached from him or at least from his ideology of drugs. A birds eye view close up of his face gasping and smiling amusingly once he is brought back by the nurses and the ironic sound design of Lou Reed’s “Perfect Day” are used to juxtapose the dangers of addiction with the 1990s youths engagement in drug culture.\n\nTrainspotting approaches the ideology of drug use through the binary opposition of those who do drugs and those who don’t. The binary opposition is evident in the opening sequence as Renton and his friends are introduced, through freeze-frames with their names on screen, playing football. Renton and his friends through mise-en-scene are presented with dishevelled clothes and messy appearances whereas the group they are playing against, non-drug users, are wearing matching well-put together uniforms. Parallel actions of the two teams, emphasised through the use of match cuts, present them as existing at the same age in the same culture but taking two separate paths in life. Moral ideology is tackled in the film through the comparison drawn between hedonistic abusal of drugs and more casual legal drug users. Renton, Sickboy and their gang are shown to be full-time heroine users whereas Tommy, Begbie and even Renton’s parents, whilst criticising the heroine users, are shown to have their own immoral tendencies such as smoking, excessive drinking and violence, or in Begbie’s case all of the above. Every character is depicted as morally questionable to varying degrees, even young Diane blackmails Renton into a relationship thus highlighting the hypocrisy of corrupt society.\n\nWhilst Trainspotting undeniably focuses on its male protagonists with the female characters serving as little more than love interests, the ideologies of masculinity and femininity are still explored within the narrative. In one sequence located in the club, parallel editing shows Spud and Tommy talking about sex whilst Gail and Lizzy do the same, upon returning to each other shot reverse shot is used between the two pairs as the boys insist they were talking about “football” and the girls “shopping”. The sequence points out gender stereotypes and arguable dismisses them as facades masking the similarities between men and women. Liberal views on gender are apparent in Renton’s monologue about the differing norms of the 1990s and suggests that “one thousand years from now their will be no guys and no girls”. Varying aspects of masculinity are explored through the male characters. Traditional masculinity is asserted through Begbie’s character displaying aggression to assert dominance through bar fights; however, new complex masculine behaviours are also apparent in Tommy’s character who, whilst representing typical athletic prowess, is in touch with his feelings, and through Renton’s intellectual masculinity. Whilst traditional roles and inequalities are evident through the binary opposite of men and women and masculinity and femininity, Trainspotting aims to reflect the liberalisation of gender norms in the 1990s in order to project the ideology of a changing world.\n\nOverall, Trainspotting explores the ideology of drugs through binary oppositions of drug users and non-drug users and non-conformity and conformity. The final monologue delivered by Renton in which he opts to join the capitalist society and “choose life” perhaps presents the ideology of drug use as ephemeral and a temporary part of youth rebellion thus dissuading us from the damaging lifestyle.\n\nThis is England (Shane Meadows, 2007) is an autobiographical film following Shaun, a 12 year old boy, as he becomes friends with a group of teen skinheads before being swayed by the arrival of Combo, a racist ex-convict; the skinheads are divided in the film into two factions that Shaun finds himself fluctuating between.\n\nA preferred reading of This is England accepts Meadows’ positive presentation of skinheads shown through Woody’s group of friends and understands the message that groups cannot be taken at surface level. An oppositional reading may continue to associate skinheads with racism, as was common of the 1980s with the group increasingly associated with the national front and racist sentiment, due to the presentation of the second faction headed by Combo.\n\nThis is England is a social realist film and, like Trainspotting, depicts youth culture. In the 1980s urban British setting, skinhead culture takes control of the youths. The contextual opening montage is accompanied by the non-diegetic compiled score of a Jamaican reggae song “S4-46 Was My Number” by The Toots and The Maytals, music reflective of the youthful skinheads movement; the montage of 1980s life features scattered shots of skinheads as well as shots of a national front rally with skinheads present. These two factions of skinheads are separated more throughout the film as the binary opposite of skinheads and racists becomes more apparent.\n\nThe more positive presentation of the skinhead movement is introduced to the audience in the same way as it is to Shaun: through his introduction to Woody’s group. Meadow’s uses montage as a form of time compression to show Woody and his friends spending time and bonding with Shaun. The non-diegetic compiled score Louie Louie that accompanies the montage is by The Toots and The Maytals, the same artist used in the opening montage thus furthering this as a representation of 1980s skinhead youth culture. The use of slow motion on wide shots of Shaun walking and laughing with his new friends promotes the ideology of the skinhead movement as a positive for young people thus encouraging us to take the preferred reading of the film. The latter half of the skinheads vs racists binary opposition is also shown through a montage and introduced to us again in the same way it is introduced to Shaun: through his conversion into this Combo’s group. As Combo tells a racist story to Woody’s group, thus introducing the idea of skinheads association with racism, slow motion is used to put emphasis on the reaction shots of the groups as well as the enthusiastic facial expressions of Combo; the non-diegetic piano composed score evokes feelings of disapproval of the message that Combo is spreading. A few sequences later, Shaun is shown hanging out with Combo’s gang through a montage. At one point in the montage, the use of a long fade from a mid-shot of Shaun walking to a close-up tracking shot of the racist slang graffitied on walls is used to symbolise his immersion in this new culture. A slow-motion long shot of the gang walking towards the camera is visually identical to the same shot used in the earlier montage of Woody’s gang walking; however, the repeated use of the sad non-diegetic emotive piano score is used to give the sequence a tragic tone rather than an upbeat tone to present the group as a band of misfits connected through an ill-thought ideology of racism.\n\nA central theme in This is England is the impressionability of younger members of society. This theme is highlighted by the ideology of paternalism. The opening shot of the film begins as a close-up of a photo of Shaun’s deceased father before tracking out to show Shaun who sits up and looks at the photo thus automatically introducing the presence of paternalism. Within the film, with Shaun’s father dead from the war, Woody and Combo both act as surrogate father figures. Woody takes Shaun under his wing and comforts him after he is bullied before buying him clothes and including him in all of his friends’ outings and activities; as an audience positioned with Shaun, we feel inclined to like Woody’s paternal position. When Shaun begins his conversion to Combo’s racist gang, it is clear that he takes over the paternal role from Woody. In one sequence, Combo scares two Pakistan boys playing football; shot reverse shot between a close-up of Combo as he threatens the boys with racist remarks and a close-up of Shaun who is shown to be smiling is evidence of Shaun’s idolisation of his new paternal figure. However, unlike Woody the audience is not encouraged to be persuaded by Combo’s views, instead the use of the non-diegetic sad piano score is used to highlight the tragedy of Shaun being led astray. The binary opposition of Woody and Combo emphasises the difference in the two factions of Skinhead culture and uses the character of Shaun and the prominence of youthful impressionability to encourage the audience to side with Woody and disassociate with Combo’s racist ideology.\n\nWhilst, like Trainspotting, This is England focuses dominantly on its central male characters, ideologies of masculinity and femininity are apparent. Within the youthful skinhead group, gender doesn’t appear to matter: the haircuts and clothing are encapsulated in the same movement rather than by their individual gender restrictions and identifications. Through the focus on the male characters, the theme of masculinity is apparent. The male characters are shown to have violent tendencies rooted in them; in the first sequence following Shaun we see him engage in a fistfight at school with a boy called Harvey. Through Combo’s character we are presented with two aspects of toxic masculinity (referring to masculine norms that can be harmful to men and those around them): violence and negation of emotion and as an audience. Combo, after brutally beating Shaun’s friend Milky in front of him, tells Shaun to stoop crying because “real men don’t cry”. The enforcement of this traditional masculine ideal immediately after the emotional intensity of the scene emphasised through the frequent close-ups of the violent beating as well as reaction shots of Shaun is distress, is used to highlight the flaws in Combo’s ideology of masculinity.\n\nOverall, the ideological focus of This is England centres around the skinhead movement but within this, many binary opposites are explored including youth and old age and skinheads and racists.\n\nBoth This is England and Trainspotting explore ideologies relevant to the contexts in which they are set in order to represent youth culture at that time. In Trainspotting, addiction takes charge as the dominant theme and the preferred ideology sees drug use as a dangerous path. In This is England, the skinhead movement takes charge to promote themes of childhood impressionability and friendship and the preferred ideology separates the racism of the era from the simultaneous skinhead culture."
