It includes a chronology, a list of acronyms and abbreviations, an introductory essay, a map, a bibliography, and nearly 400 cross-referenced dictionary entries on prominent individuals, institutions, events, politics, economics, society, and culture.\n\nModern Italy\n\nItaly exercises a hold on the imagination of people, and its long history has led to a seemingly inexhaustible supply of cultural achievement. Rome, Florence, and Venice are among the top destinations for tourists and art lovers, and Italy’s natural beauty and cuisine are renowned. The country’s history and politics are also a source of endless fascination—modern Italy has consistently been a “political laboratory” for the rest of Europe. In the 19th century, Italian patriotism was of crucial importance in the struggle against the absolute governments reintroduced after the Congress of Vienna in 1814–1815. After the fall of Fascism during World War II, Italy became a model of rapid economic development, though its politics has never been less than contentious and its democracy has remained troubled.\n\nGILBERT AND NILSSON\n\nSECOND EDITION\n\nSECOND EDITION\n\nmodern italy\n\nMARK F.

Yet, differences persist between the more prosperous North and the far poorer South, and regionalism remains strong. Moreover, Italy’s progress has been far from smooth or exempt from turmoil, most notably during the Fascist regime and World War II, and gradually muted but serious conflicts between right and left have plagued it ever since. Despite its efforts, the postwar regime has been unable to overcome all the tensions and thoroughly modernize the state, although its economy has fared well enough until recently and its society has changed remarkably. Moreover, Italian leaders have taken the country into all the European ventures from the very start, and Italy plays an important role in the European Union. So much has happened in Italy since unification that there seems to be no end to what might be surveyed in this volume. It has therefore focused on certain prominent individuals, basic institutions, crucial events and fundamental features needed to understand modern Italy. Of course, it also sheds light on the occasionally larger than life persons who have emerged and shaped its course. Along with history and politics, the dictionary includes entries on economics, society, and culture. The context for all this is provided in an introduction, and the chronology traces the many twists and turns in greater detail. The lists of acronyms, kings, presidents, and prime ministers are useful references. And the selective bibliography is a good starting place for readers who want to know more. As some have noticed, changes in Italy are not only theatrical, they sometimes almost verge on soap opera, as in the previous government, so it is harder than elsewhere to keep up with events. This makes the ix\n\n07_244_1Front.qxd\n\nx •\n\n7/23/07\n\n5:33 AM\n\nPage x\n\nEDITOR’S FOREWORD\n\nsecond edition of the Historical Dictionary of Modern Italy particularly welcome. The first edition was written by K. Robert Nilsson and Mark F. Gilbert. The former, who was professor emeritus at Dickinson College, sadly passed away shortly after publication of the first edition, and so the work on this second edition was undertaken by Professor Gilbert alone. He has taught Italian politics and history at Dickinson College, the University of Bath in England, and the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies in Bologna and teaches contemporary European history at the University of Trento, Italy. He has written extensively on Italian politics, including The Italian Revolution: The End of Politics Italian Style? This experience has certainly benefited the second edition, which is not only updated but considerably expanded. Jon Woronoff Series Editor\n\n07_244_1Front.qxd\n\n7/23/07\n\n5:33 AM\n\nPage xi\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe first edition of this book was begun by Bob Nilsson and myself in 1996 when I was assistant professor of political science at Dickinson College and Bob was professor emeritus in the same discipline at the college. Bob and his wife Judy were great friends to my wife and me during our time in the United States and before that during Bob’s last year as director of Dickinson College’s European Studies program in Bologna. Bob and I collaborated on the first edition for three years. In editing and extending this second edition, I realized just how much Bob knew about a huge range of topics in Italian life, language, and society. An expert on post-1945 party politics, he had nevertheless contributed to a large number of the cultural and social entries in the dictionary, and most of his original contribution remains in this second edition. Bob died shortly after the publication of the first edition of this book, and Dickinson College renamed its Bologna Center in his honor. It was a worthy tribute to an outstanding teacher and remarkable man who knew Italy as very few foreigners can claim to do. I would like to thank Jon Woronoff for his considerable patience and his help with the editing of this book, and Susan McEachern of Rowman & Littlefield for authorizing the use of the map, which was originally published in the second (2004) edition of Europe Today, edited by Ronald Tiersky. The first edition of this dictionary was prepared by Vickie Kuhn of the Political Science Department at Dickinson College; her fine work made preparing this second edition all the easier. Between 1997 and 2002, I taught modern Italian history and Italian language in the Department of European Studies at the University of Bath. Writing the first edition of this book helped me enormously in the preparation of my lectures. I made many friends at Bath, and my particular regards go to the Italian section of the department, namely Jacqui Andall, Anna Cento Bull, Adalgisa Giorgio, and Ernest Hampson, for xi\n\n07_244_1Front.qxd\n\nxii •\n\n7/23/07\n\n5:33 AM\n\nPage xii\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nhaving made my years at Bath so enjoyable and worthwhile. This book would have been very different had I not worked among such knowledgeable and enthusiastic colleagues. My wife, Luciana, is the root source of my interest in Italy. She and Francisco have put up with me as usual while I passed long hours in the office ensuring that I had “bolded” the right words and cross-referenced correctly. The book contains much new material (there are more than 70 new entries, and dozens of former entries have been expanded or significantly revised). I hope it will be a useful source of information for people who wish to know more about this undeniably fascinating country.\n\n07_244_1Front.qxd\n\n7/23/07\n\n5:33 AM\n\nPage xiii\n\nAcronyms and

Andreotti is accused of being the mastermind behind the P2. 1984 During the campaign for the elections to the European Parliament, PCI leader Enrico Berlinguer dies of a stroke. Two million people attend the funeral. The PCI overtakes the DC in the Euro-poll, obtaining over 33 percent of the vote. Bettino Craxi and the church agree to revisions of the Lateran pacts, which end Catholicism’s status as the official religion of the state. 1985 A referendum against a law passed by the Craxi government to end automatic cost-of-living increases is defeated. In June, Francesco Cossiga is elected president of the Republic. Achille Lauro crisis roils Italian–American relations but boosts Craxi’s standing with public opinion and the Arab world. Deaths of two of postwar Italy’s most eminent novelists, Italo Calvino and Elsa Morante. 1986 The so-called maxitrial of over 400 alleged mafiosi takes place in Palermo. After two years of hearings, life sentences are meted out to almost the entire leadership of Cosa Nostra, including the boss of bosses, Michele “the pope” Greco. Tensions between the DC and the PSI cause the downfall of Craxi’s first government in June after nearly three years in power—a postwar record. Craxi forms a second cabinet in August on the understanding that he will give way to a DC premier in March 1987. 1987 Craxi reneges on his promise to resign, causing the most difficult and drawn-out government crisis of the 1980s. In June, elections are held to resolve the issue. The PSI does well, advancing to 14 percent, and the PCI’s share drops again. Giovanni Goria (DC) becomes premier at the head of a hapless administration that is sabotaged mercilessly by the PSI. A referendum held in November abolishes Italy’s nuclear power program.

Italy is paralyzed by wildcat strikes called by unofficial trade unions in the transport sector. Death in May of Giorgio Almirante, historic leader of Italian neofascism. 1989 The DC removes De Mita from the party leadership, replacing him with Arnaldo Forlani. In July, De Mita is replaced as prime minister by Andreotti. The end of communism in Eastern Europe provokes vast changes in the PCI. Its leader, Achille Occhetto, announces his intention to transform the party into a formation “new even in name.” Death of the Sicilian novelist and political activist Leonardo Sciascia in November. 1990 Parliament whitewashes a report revealing that there was widespread electoral fraud in Naples in the 1987 elections. Sixty-seven percent of a special conference of the PCI back Occhetto’s decision to create a new party. In October, Occhetto announces that the new party will be called the Partito Democratico della Sinistra/Democratic Party of the Left (PDS). Regional elections reveal the local strength of the Lombard League. A secret network of underground anticommunist armed cells known as “Gladio” is discovered. Death in February of Alessandro Pertini, Italy’s most loved president and wartime hero. Italy plays host to the soccer world cup. 1991 Italian airmen and ships participate in the Gulf War. The PCI’s Twentieth Party Congress votes in February to change the party’s name. A faction leaves to form the Partito di Rifondazione Comunista/ Communist Refoundation Party (PRC). Autonomist movements unite to form the Lega Nord/Northern League (LN). President Cossiga uses presidential powers to block investigation of his role in the creation of “Gladio” and attacks Italy’s institutions in an endless series of public outbursts. A referendum on electoral reform passes by a huge majority in June against the wishes of the party hierarchies. Tens of thousands of Albanian boat people attempt to migrate to Italy. 1992 Treaty of Maastricht signed in February. General elections in April end in a historic defeat for the DC and a triumph for the LN. President Cossiga resigns, provoking a major political crisis. After the mafia kills prosecutor Giovanni Falcone, Parliament elects Oscar Luigi Scalfaro (DC) to the presidency.

In September the lira collapses and the new government of Giuliano Amato (PSI) is forced to take emergency measures to save the country from financial crisis. 1993 The Amato government collapses under the weight of the corruption investigations and public demands for change after a second referendum on electoral reform in April. The governor of the Bank of Italy, Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, is appointed premier. The LN achieves a massive victory in local elections held in June. In December, political leaders of all parties publicly admit to huge corruption in the trial of a Milanese businessman; investigations begin into the mafia links of several prominent politicians, notably Giulio Andreotti, who is eventually charged with ordering the murder of a journalist, Mino Pecorelli, in 1979. Death, in November, of Federico Fellini. 1994 Victory, in elections held under new majoritarian rules, of the media entrepreneur Silvio Berlusconi. Together with the LN and the neofascist Alleanza Nazionale/National Alliance (AN), Berlusconi forms a government in May. Berlusconi’s government lasts until December, when the LN votes against the government in a vote of confidence. By December, Berlusconi, too, is indicted. 1995 The most tormented government crisis even of postwar Italian history is resolved by the appointment in January of Lamberto Dini, an economist and banker, at the head of a government of unelected technocrats. Dini is supported in Parliament by the LN, the PDS, and the remnants of the DC, who have retaken the name of the PPI. The polemics aroused by Dini’s appointment cause the lira to plummet against the mark and lead to worries about Italy’s political stability. Romano Prodi, a Bologna economics professor, forms a center-left coalition with the support of the PDS. The Olive Tree Coalition (Ulivo), as it is known, rapidly wins public support. 1996 Prodi wins national elections held in April, but his government is dependent on the PRC for a majority in Parliament. The new government is forced to make harsh economic decisions to meet the deadlines laid down for monetary union by the Maastricht treaty. A bicameral commission on constitutional reform is announced. In September the LN, flush with victory because of its strong showing in\n\n07_244_1Front.qxd\n\n7/23/07\n\n5:34 AM\n\nPage xxxv\n\nCHRONOLOGY\n\n• xxxv\n\nthe general elections, proclaims that it will work for the Constitution of an independent republic of Padania. 1997 March: Italy agrees to head a multinational UN force to assist in ensuring humanitarian aid to Albania. Over 16,000 refugees flee that country to land in nearby southern Italy. April: Administrative elections in many Italian cities see the PRC gain while other major parties, both in the Olive Tree Coalition and in the opposition, fare poorly. October: The PRC protests deep budget cuts in pensions and health care by threatening to withdraw its support of the government. 1998 Italy qualifies to convert to the euro in May. However, the bicameral commission on constitutional reform collapses in June and the Olive Tree Coalition government falls on a vote of confidence on October 9. Massimo D’Alema becomes prime minister of a new centerleft government at the end of October. The new government is immediately plunged into a diplomatic crisis when Abdullah Ocalen, leader of the Kurdish guerrilla movement in Turkey, surrenders to Italian authorities. Ocalen is wanted in both Germany and Turkey and faces the death penalty in the latter. He is extradited to Turkey in January 1999. Earlier in the year, in February, a low-flying U.S. jet cuts the cable of a ski gondola in the Trentino town of Cavalese, killing 20 tourists and provoking widespread indignation. In party politics, the Democratici di Sinistra/Democrats of the Left (DS) supersede the PDS on 13 February 1998; AN, meanwhile, holds a major conference in Verona to continue its shift toward a postfascist ideological identity. In July, Berlusconi is sentenced to two years and nine months’ imprisonment, pending appeal, on four charges of corrupting tax officers. Berlusconi’s sentence evokes international discussion of the “Berlusconi Problem” and the normality of Italian democracy. Berlusconi is acquitted in May 2000 of one of the charges and the court finds extenuating circumstances for the others. 1999 On 1 January 1999, the exchange rates of the 11 participating currencies are fixed and the euro becomes a financial reality. Romano Prodi creates the Democrats for the Ulivo, a new political formation, in February and polemicizes with the DS and the PPI. He leaves Italian politics in June to become president of the European Commission. The D’Alema government vacillates over the NATO bombing of Kosovo and Yugoslavia, first condemning, then supporting, the raids. The\n\n07_244_1Front.qxd\n\nxxxvi •\n\n7/23/07\n\n5:34 AM\n\nPage xxxvi\n\nCHRONOLOGY\n\ngovernment’s other major decision of the year is the privatization of ENEL, the state electricity company, in which the state retains a 51 percent stake. D’Alema resigns in December to reshuffle his government. This is the first government crisis managed by President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, who is elected on 13 May, with broad bipartisan support. Roberto Benigni’s La Vita è bella, a daring tragicomic film about Italian Jews in Auschwitz, wins three Oscars, including best picture, in March. 2000 The pope opens the Jubilee year in Rome. The culmination will be a huge open-air mass in Rome on 19 August attended by more than 2,000,000 young people from all over the world. In politics, the year is dominated by the creation in February of the Casa delle Libertà/House of Freedoms (CDL) by Silvio Berlusconi, which links together Forza Italia, the LN, AN, and two centrist parties in a right-of-center coalition. The new coalition achieves a substantial victory in the regional elections of April 2000, taking over 60 percent of the vote in Lombardy. D’Alema’s government falls after the vote, and D’Alema is replaced by Giuliano Amato. In October, Francesco Rutelli, the youthful mayor of Rome, is nevertheless preferred to Amato as the Olive Tree Coalition’s candidate for the premiership in the 2001 general elections. On the sporting front, Italy reaches the final of the European football championship, losing 2–1 to France on 2 July, and finishes an excellent seventh in the medals table of the Sydney Olympics in September, winning 13 gold medals. The disgraced former premier Bettino Craxi dies in Tunisia in January. 2001 Striking victory for Silvio Berlusconi’s CDL in general elections in May despite an international press outcry against the Milanese businessman, whom The Economist denounces as “unfit to govern Italy.” The center-right parties take nearly 50 percent of the popular vote and Forza Italia, Berlusconi’s own party, obtains 29.4 percent (10.9 million votes), easily the highest total of any single party. The new government immediately has to deal with a major crisis: In July an estimated 9,000 anarchists and no-global activists cause massive street violence in Genoa during the G8 summit. One demonstrator is killed by police gunfire, 180 people are injured, and tens of millions of euros of damage is done to the city center. On 22 July, a police blitz in a Genoa hostel housing no-global demonstrators provokes polemic after dozens\n\n07_244_1Front.qxd\n\n7/23/07\n\n5:34 AM\n\nPage xxxvii\n\nCHRONOLOGY\n\n• xxxvii\n\nof innocent protesters are savagely beaten by policemen. On 8 October, a collision between two aircraft at Milan’s Linate airport causes 118 deaths and a major investigation into airport security. In foreign policy, Italy approves U.S. military action in Afghanistan on 9 October with a bipartisan motion of Parliament. Parliament also approves Italian participation in the peacekeeping force in the following month. Death in July of Indro Montanelli, famous journalist and writer and outspoken critic of Silvio Berlusconi. 2002 Euro notes circulate from 1 January. Lira notes disappear from circulation on 28 February. The introduction of the euro is accompanied by a lengthy polemic about shopkeepers exploiting the monetary changeover to raise prices. In politics, the year starts badly for Berlusconi’s coalition when Renato Ruggieri resigns as foreign minister on 5 January in protest of the euroskeptical attitudes of the government. Berlusconi takes over the ministerial portfolio and acts as his own foreign minister until November, when he is replaced by Franco Frattini. The government’s aggressive rhetoric against the judiciary, and its attempts to favor the prime minister by decriminalizing offences of which Berlusconi himself is accused, provokes a backlash in civil society. Milanese judge Francesco Saverio Borrelli invites the judiciary to “resist, resist, resist” against political pressures on 15 January. In February, the so-called girotondo movement is launched by film director Nanni Moretti and other leading intellectuals. On 24 March, the small parties of the center-left, including the PPI, consolidate into a single party called Democrazia e Libertà/Democracy and Liberty Party (DL). Francesco Rutelli is the first party leader. On 14 September, approximately one million people protest against the government’s abuse of the law-making process to serve political ends. The year is also characterized by personal tragedies. On 7 March, more than 50 would-be immigrants are killed when their boat capsizes near the island of Lampedusa. Thirty-seven die in similar circumstances on September 15. On 19 March, left-wing terrorists inspired by the Red Brigades kill a Bologna University teacher and government consultant, Marco Biagi. The killers are later arrested after a train shootout in which a policeman is killed. A trade unionist called Massimo D’Antona had previously been killed by the same gang of terrorists, in May 1999. On 31 October, 27 children and their teacher are killed in Molise when a primary school collapses during an earthquake.\n\n07_244_1Front.qxd\n\nxxxviii •\n\n7/23/07\n\n5:34 AM\n\nPage xxxviii\n\nCHRONOLOGY\n\n2003 The year opens with intense political protests over the war in Iraq. Over a million antiwar activists march through Rome on 15 February. The Berlusconi government nevertheless approves the use of NATO bases in Italy by U.S. jets and on 15 April votes to take part in a peacekeeping exercise in Iraq; 3,000 Italian troops are eventually sent at the end of the conflict to serve in southern Iraq. On 12 November, 19 Italian soldiers and 8 Iraqis are killed by a suicide bomber at the Italian mission headquarters in Nassirya. Italy’s European policy falls into disarray after Berlusconi opens the Italian presidency of the European Union (EU) in July by insulting a German deputy of the European Parliament. Following further anti-German remarks made by government ministers, Chancellor Gerhard Schröder is forced to cancel a planned vacation in Italy. Italy’s presidency fails to get EU-wide approval of the constitutional treaty proposed by a constitutional convention in July 2003. Domestic politics is dominated by the conflict between the courts and the political class. On 29 April, Cesare Previti, Berlusconi’s longtime close advisor, is condemned to 11 years’ imprisonment for corruption. Giulio Andreotti’s decade-long legal battle against charges of murder and association with the mafia is ended by an unequivocal acquittal on the first charge and a somewhat less ringing vote of confidence on the second. At the end of the year, Parmalat, a foodstuffs multinational, collapses amid Enron-like allegations of fraud, false accounting, and illegal disposal of assets. Death, on 24 January, of FIAT boss Gianni Agnelli. Luciano Berio, a daunting contemporary composer, dies in May. 2004 On 5 May, Berlusconi’s government reaches its 1060th day, the longest administration in republican Italy’s history. In June, however, European elections are won by the center-left opposition, and Forza Italia’s share of the vote falls to just 21 percent. The cause of the government’s lack of popularity is Italy’s economic malaise. Low growth, rising public debt, and worries about competitiveness characterize political discourse in 2004. On July 3, Giulio Tremonti, “superminister” for economic affairs, resigns and is replaced by Domenico Siniscalco. The year is dominated by political turbulence within the CDL, and at the end of the year Berlusconi is obliged to bring one of his principal critics, Marco Follini, the secretary of the Unione dei democratici cristiani e di centro/Union of Christian Democrats and\n\n07_244_1Front.qxd\n\n7/23/07\n\n5:34 AM\n\nPage xxxix\n\nCHRONOLOGY\n\n• xxxix\n\nthe Center (UDC), into the government as deputy prime minister. The year is also marked by the abolition of compulsory military service starting 1 January 2005 and, on 29 October, by the signature of the EU constitutional treaty in Rome. Norberto Bobbio, a leading philosopher, dies on 9 January. Umberto Bossi, the leader of the LN, is hospitalized for six months after a heart attack. Bossi’s absence from politics slows passage of the CDL’s sweeping proposed reform of the Constitution, which is the centerpiece of its domestic agenda but is regarded with hostility by the UDC. 2005 On 10 February, Romano Prodi, now free of his commitments in Brussels, presents the Unione, a new electoral alliance between the Olive Tree Coalition and the PRC. The new alliance enjoys quick successes. In April, it inflicts a crushing defeat on the CDL in the regional elections. The center-right wins only Lombardy and Venetia; the other 13 regions without a special statute vote for the center-left. The defeat weakens Berlusconi’s political position. He resigns on 20 April and presents a reshuffled administration on 27 April. The new government is plagued by political turmoil: In October, the same month that Romano Prodi wins a “primary” to become the Union’s official leader, Marco Follini declares Berlusconi unsuitable to be prime minister. Further political tension is caused by the publication of illicit recordings of telephone conversations that appear to show that the governor of the Bank of Italy, Antonio Fazio, had intervened behind the scenes to prevent a Dutch bank from taking over Antonveneto, a small northern Italian bank. Fazio is forced to resign in December, but in the meantime the affair arouses considerable international criticism. In November, the government enacts a constitutional reform empowering the president of the Council of Ministers, creating a Senate of the Regions, and transferring exclusive competence to the regions for matters concerning health care, the police, and education. It is the most sweeping reform to the 1948 Constitution in the history of the Republic. The new law is to be subject to ratification by a confirmatory referendum. In December, the government also passes a new electoral law restoring proportional representation. The death on 2 April of John Paul II causes widespread public mourning. 2006 The first four months of the year are dominated by the electoral campaign, in which Silvio Berlusconi, whose defeat was taken for\n\n07_244_1Front.qxd\n\nxl •\n\n7/23/07\n\n5:34 AM\n\nPage xl\n\nCHRONOLOGY\n\ngranted at the onset, leads the CDL to near-victory. After the poll on 9–10 April, only 24,000 votes separate the two coalitions in the elections to the Chamber of Deputies, with both sides getting approximately 19 million votes. In the Senate elections, the CDL actually gets more votes than the Union, but obtains fewer seats. The Union, however, is reliant on the votes of the life senators for a majority. The new Parliament chooses Giorgio Napolitano to succeed Carlo Azeglio Ciampi on 10 May. On 17 May, Romano Prodi presents his new government, which survives a vote of confidence in the Senate by a narrow margin. At the end of June, the CDL’s constitutional law is heavily defeated in the confirmatory referendum: 62 percent vote against. On 9 July, Italy wins the World Cup for the fourth time, beating Germany in the semifinal and France in the final. In August 2006, Italy takes a leading role in the decision to send an EU peacekeeping force to Lebanon to police the ceasefire between Hizbullah and Israel. Over 2,000 Italian troops are committed. Italy pledges itself to take command of the mission in February 2007.\n\n07_244_2Intro.qxd\n\n7/23/07\n\n5:40 AM\n\nPage 1\n\nIntroduction\n\nItaly is a country that exercises a hold on the imagination of people all over the world. Its long history has left an inexhaustible treasure chest of cultural achievement: There is hardly a town in Italy that does not repay a visit. Great historic cities such as Rome, Florence, and Venice are among the most sought-after destinations in the world for tourists and art lovers. Italy’s natural beauty and cuisine are rightly renowned. But Italy’s history and politics are also a source of endless fascination. Modern Italy has consistently been a political laboratory for the rest of Europe. In the 19th century, Italian patriotism was of crucial importance in the struggle against the absolute governments reintroduced after the Congress of Vienna in 1814–1815. The subsequent transformation of this patriotic feeling, which was celebrated by the great British historian G. M. Trevelyan in his trilogy of books on Giuseppe Garibaldi, into a jingoistic form of nationalism and imperialism, is less well known but equally significant in historical terms. Italy’s parliamentary democracy struggled against the powerful ideological forces unleashed by the country’s poverty and its political class’s ambitions until 1922, when Fascism came to power. After the fall of Fascism during World War II, Italy became a model of rapid economic development, though its politics has never been less than contentious and its democracy has remained a troubled one. This book is an attempt to introduce the key personalities, events, social developments, and cultural achievements of Italy since the beginning of the 19th century, when Italy first began to emerge as something more than a geographical entity and national feeling began to grow.\n\nLAND AND PEOPLE The long boot-shaped peninsula of Italy separates the Mediterranean basin into western and eastern halves. In addition, the largest islands in 1\n\n07_244_2Intro.qxd\n\n2 •\n\n7/23/07\n\n5:40 AM\n\nPage 2\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nthe Mediterranean Sea, Sicily and Sardinia, are both part of Italian territory. Italy is just over 300,000 square kilometers (115,830 square miles) in size and some 1,500 kilometers (938 miles) in length. It has some 7,600 kilometers (4,722 miles) of coastline. The country’s northernmost cities, Aosta and Bolzano, are in the heart of the Alps; Sicily, by contrast, is just a ferry ride away from North Africa. In all there are 12 degrees of latitude between the southernmost tip of Sicily and the frontiers with France, Switzerland, and Austria. Italy’s geographical coordinates are N 42° 50, E 12° 50. The North has a continental climate, with occasional extremes of heat, humidity, and cold; the South is more typically Mediterranean in temperature, with scorching heat in the summer and mostly mild winters. Daytime summer temperatures are 33–35ºC in the North, 38–42ºC in the South. In the winter, by contrast, southern towns such as Palermo or Naples rarely drop below freezing point and may even enjoy temperatures of 10–15ºC, while the Po River valley endures long weeks of subzero weather and dense fog. The South is very dry; indeed, water shortages are becoming a political problem of some importance. Almost all the country is mountainous. In Sicily there are peaks exceeding 3,000 meters (9,847 feet), including Mount Etna, one of the world’s highest active volcanoes. The Apennines run for 745 miles like the shinbone of the Italian boot through Umbria, the Marches, Abruzzi, Molise, and Campania. The highest peaks are in the western Alps: Monte Rosa is over 4,600 meters (15,203 feet) in height and Monte Bianco (Mont Blanc), Europe’s highest mountain, is 4,810 meters (15,755 feet). The highest points in the eastern Alps are to be found in the Trentino and in Alto Adige. These are Ortles, at 3,905 meters (12,812 feet), and Gran Zebrù (in German, Königsspitze), at 3,857 meters (12,654 feet). The Alps are populated by several linguistic minorities of some importance. Ladini are to be found in large numbers in Friuli, Trentino, and Alto Adige; German speakers are a large majority of the people that inhabit Alto Adige, or Süd Tirol. French speakers dwell in the Valle d’Aosta. The only lowland areas are the fertile flood valley of the Po River, Italy’s longest river at 652 kilometers (405 miles), and the heel of the Italian boot, Apulia. Many of Italy’s largest industrial cities (Turin, Milan, Brescia, Bologna, Padua) are concentrated in the Po River valley, while Apulia boasts some of Italy’s most important ports: Bari, Taranto, and Brindisi.\n\n07_244_2Intro.qxd\n\n7/23/07\n\n5:40 AM\n\nPage 3\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n• 3\n\nThe mountainous terrain ensures that population density is very high in the flatter, more accessible parts of the country and along the coast. Big cities such as Milan, Genoa, Rome, and Naples all have densities of over 2,000 people per square kilometer, and almost all of the country, including some of the most mountainous areas, has more than 200 inhabitants per square kilometer. Only the sun-scorched, barren uplands of Sardinia, southern Italy, and Sicily are sparsely inhabited. Even the Alps are dotted with villages and thriving small commercial centers. In addition to the Po, other important rivers are the Adige, which flows from the Alps to the Adriatic sea and is some 410 kilometers (255 miles) in length, and the Tiber (Tevere), which is also just over 400 kilometers in length. There are several important lakes, of which the largest is the pistol-shaped Lake Garda, which is 370 square kilometers (143 square miles) in area. Lake Garda is shared by the regions of Venetia, Lombardy, and the autonomous province of Trentino. Other important lakes are Lake Bolsena in Latium and Lakes Maggiore and Como on the Lombardy–Switzerland border. Italy is divided into 20 regions and 103 provinces (see REGIONALISM). The largest region in population is Lombardy, which has nearly 9.5 million inhabitants, 16 percent of the nation’s total population. The largest region in area is Sicily, with a surface area of 25,700 square kilometers (9,925 square miles).\n\nHISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT A visitor to Italy today, observing the busy commercial success that pervades almost the entire peninsula, might be excused for thinking that the country had enjoyed a long history of Swiss-like political stability, economic development, social cohesion, and peace. In fact, Poland aside, no other European nation has been so constantly ravaged by war and invasion as Italy. The peninsula has been an enticing prize for the dominant European power of every epoch since the final collapse of Rome in AD 476. Beginning with the Lombards, who swept through all of northern and central Italy after AD 568 and gradually established (by the standards of the time) a welladministered, though loosely organized, state that increasingly coveted the wealthy but less politically cohesive South, Italy has\n\n07_244_2Intro.qxd\n\n4 •\n\n7/23/07\n\n5:40 AM\n\nPage 4\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nabsorbed waves of foreign invasion that have left their traces in the cultural and political DNA of the peninsula’s inhabitants. At the risk of over-generalizing, it has been broadly true that the accidents of geography and history ensured that the North has been influenced by northern Europe, and in particular the civilizations of France and Germany, while the South has been dominated by Mediterranean powers. The South, as a consequence, has known a more absolutist tradition of rule, while the cities of the North were freer to develop their own forms of rule. The Holy Roman Empire, to which northern Italy nominally belonged after AD 773, when the Lombards were defeated by Charlemagne, was not able to exercise its authority in the peninsula after Charlemagne’s death in AD 814, and political power in northern Italy devolved on local noblemen and churchmen. The North’s primary form of organization became the city-state: small, with a politically active aristocracy and a sometimes turbulent populace. These cities were hardly models of good government. They were riven by bloody factional strife and interfamily warfare, but they were economically dynamic, and possessed—to use, anachronistically, the language of modern-day political science—a conscious political identity. This enabled them to unite against an outside aggressor: Between 1152 and 1176, the efforts of Frederick Barbarossa to restore the Holy Roman Empire’s authority in northern Italy were defeated by a league of northern Italian cities, the Lega Lombarda. In the South, by contrast, the Arabs, who occupied Sicily and much of southern Italy in AD 827, turned Palermo into one of the most prosperous and technologically advanced cities in the world in the ninth century. They were supplanted in the 11th century by the Normans, who established a highly centralized form of government that brooked no opposition. The last attempt to unify the peninsula before the 19th century took place at the beginning of the 13th century when Frederick Barbarossa’s grandson, Frederick II, who had inherited the throne of Sicily from the Normans, endeavored to restore imperial authority over both the papacy and the city-states. Italy was ravaged by a civil war between the supporters of the empire (the Ghibellines) and the pope (Guelfs). After 30 years of constant fighting, the country was left prostrated but disunited upon Frederick’s death in 1250. Frederick’s successors continued the struggle, but the papacy was aided by the French king of Anjou, who\n\n07_244_2Intro.qxd\n\n7/23/07\n\n5:40 AM\n\nPage 5\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n• 5\n\nmade southern Italy part of the Angevin empire in 1266. By the beginning of the 14th century, Italy lacked any central authority whatever: Neither the papacy, the Angevins, nor the Holy Roman Empire was strong enough to impose order on the peninsula, which broke down into perpetual and internecine warfare. In 1316, the papal curia was removed to Avignon in southern France, removing the one symbol of authority in central Italy, which soon degenerated into anarchy and baronial feuding. Consolidation took place in the 14th century, which saw the rise of several native Italian principalities or republics to positions of power within the peninsula. Under the leadership of the Visconti family, Milan established itself as the dominant force in the North and Center of the country. Its main rivals were Venice, which enjoyed stable aristocratic government, a growing empire in Dalmatia, and domination over the northeast of the peninsula, and Florence, which overran nearly all of modern-day Tuscany. All three of these states eclipsed the Angevins, whose hold on southern Italy was somewhat tenuous, and who were replaced as rulers by the expansionist Kingdom of Aragon in the 15th century. The three great Italian states of northern and central Italy were the envy of Europe from 1300 onward. They were the most populous and wealthy societies of their day, with an advanced industrial base, sophisticated banking systems, and sublime levels of artistic achievement. The Renaissance, the revival of classical learning, was of course a Europewide phenomenon, but its home was in Italy, where the wealth of the noble families enabled artistic patronage on a grand scale. The 14th and 15th centuries were the age of Petrarch, Boccaccio, Michelangelo, Raphael, and Benvenuto Cellini; before them had come the towering genius of Dante, the poet whose writings mark the transition between the ancient world and the modern. Renaissance Italy, despite the creation in 1454 of an “Italian League” among Milan, Venice, Florence, the papacy, and the Kingdom of Naples, was plagued by continual warfare. At the end of the 15th century Italy was invaded by Charles VIII of France, who was followed by the Spanish and the forces of the revived Holy Roman Empire. Italy became a battleground for the powers. This was the age of Niccolo Machiavelli, the Florentine diplomat whose willingness to accept the ruthless laws of Realpolitik still shocks, but who saw clearly that the wealth and artistic glory of the Italian states counted for nothing in the absence of military preparedness, social discipline, and political unity.

By dynastic chance, Charles already possessed the crowns of Spain, Austria, and Burgundy, and thus controlled all of continental Europe from the Polish border to Spain— except Italy, which split the vast empire in half, and France, with whom he fought several bloody wars throughout his reign. France’s hold on Lombardy was ended after the battle of Pavia in 1525, and in 1530 Charles conquered Florence. Charles annexed Milan for Spain; placed Florence in the hands of the Medici family; established the dukedoms of Savoy, Ferrara, Mantua, Urbino, Modena, and Parma; left Lucca, Venice, and Genoa as aristocratic republics; allowed papal control over much of central Italy; and ruled Naples and the South through a viceroy. In the following decades, Venice, the one Italian state to retain some status as a European power, saw its empire in the eastern Mediterranean nibbled away by the rising power of the Ottoman Turks. Italy thus entered a long period of domination by the Spanish crown, and the parts of the peninsula that were most directly ruled by Spain were drawn into the Spanish state’s decline and eventual fall. Southern Italy, in particular, was bled dry by the need to subsidize the gargantuan edifice of the Spanish court and was deeply influenced politically by the corruption and feudalism of Spanish rule. Italy became one of the chief prizes for the powers of Europe in the War of the Spanish Succession (1701–1713). The main beneficiary of the war, in Italian terms, was Austria, which annexed Lombardy in 1707 and added Mantua and the mainland South in 1714, with Sicily passing briefly under the control of the Dukedom of Savoy, which also expanded its influence in Piedmont. Savoy, a hereditary duchy enjoying great autonomy from the Holy Roman Empire, which had been governing a tract of territory on both sides of the Alps since the Middle Ages, exchanged Sicily for Sardinia in 1720. The new Kingdom of Sardinia, and its capital, Turin, became an established power within the peninsula. The map of Italy was redrawn twice more before 1748. Austria’s gains were reduced later in the same century after the short War of the Polish Succession (1733–1735), when Charles Bourbon of Spain became king of the Two Sicilies and reunited Naples with Sicily. In 1748, the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle, which brought to an end the War of the Austrian Succession, saw the Bourbons extend their influence, while Modena fell into Austrian hands. Between 1748 and 1796 the Italian peninsula was at peace; astonishingly, this\n\n07_244_2Intro.qxd\n\n7/23/07\n\n5:40 AM\n\nPage 7\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n• 7\n\nwas the longest period without major war since the fall of the Roman Empire. In 1796, Napoleon invaded Italy at the head of the French revolutionary army, ending the Venetian Republic’s long independent history and driving the Savoys from Turin; he returned again in 1800 to reestablish French dominion. Like the Lombards, Franks, Arabs, Normans, Angevins, Aragonese, French, Spanish, and Austrians before him, he drew and redrew the political map of the peninsula with scant regard for the wishes of its inhabitants (see NAPOLEONIC ITALY). In so doing, however, he created the Kingdom of Italy in 1805. Naples was added the following year, with only Sicily remaining outside French rule. Napoleon undertook an ambitious period of modernization: A unified civil code was introduced, the power of the clergy was reduced, and internal customs duties were abolished. Many of these reforms were only partially implemented, but an important principle had at least been established. Italy, finally, was being treated as something more than a geographic expression: It had begun the process of becoming a state.\n\nMODERN ITALY The starting point in the story of modern Italy is the Congress of Vienna (1814–1815), at which the great powers of Europe—notably Austria— put the lid of absolutist rule on the cauldron of Italian national and liberal sentiment brought to a boil by the French Revolution and the Napoleonic conquests in Italy. Four main powers dominated the peninsula after the treaty: Austria, which regained sovereignty over Venice and Lombardy and exercised decisive influence over the nominally independent duchies of Tuscany, Modena, Parma, and Lucca; the Kingdom of Sardinia, comprising modern-day Sardinia, Liguria, Piedmont, Aosta, and Nice, which was restored to the House of Savoy; Naples, which was restored to Ferdinand IV of Bourbon and which swiftly annexed Sicily to create the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies; and the Papal States, consisting of modern-day Emilia-Romagna, Lazio, and the Marches, which was directly ruled by the pope. The areas closest to the Austrian border (Trento and Friuli) were absorbed into Austria itself. All told, the Congress of Vienna left nearly five million Italians under direct Austrian rule.\n\n07_244_2Intro.qxd\n\n8 •\n\n7/23/07\n\n5:40 AM\n\nPage 8\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe first half of the 19th century was marked by uprisings against absolute rule in Naples and Turin. Spurred on by the carbonari, secret societies of progressive young noblemen, soldiers, professionals, and students, liberal revolutions broke out in Naples in 1820, Piedmont in 1821, and the Papal States in 1831. The goal of the revolutionaries—a Constitution, similar to the one adopted in Spain in 1812, which compelled the crown to share executive power with a parliament elected by the wealthier classes—seems modest in retrospect, but it was bitterly resisted by the arch-conservative chief minister of the Austrian Empire throughout this period, Klemens von Metternich, who feared that the contagion of liberal ideas would spread to his own realm. Forceful Austrian intervention soon quelled all three uprisings, but the fact that the monarchies and duchies of Italy relied on a foreign power for their continued existence inevitably led to the struggle against absolute rule transforming itself into a nationalist one. By 1848, the “year of revolutions,” nationalist feeling was widespread among the Italian middle and upper classes. One of the leading nationalists, the former priest Vincenzo Gioberti, became prime minister of Sardinia after King Charles Albert, under popular pressure, granted constitutional rule; another, the republican Giuseppe Mazzini, became part of the committee of “dictators” that ruled Rome after a popular uprising had driven out the pope. All of Italy from Venice to Palermo was incandescent with revolutionary activity in 1848–1849 (see REVOLUTIONS OF 1848).\n\nTHE RISORGIMENTO The revolutions of 1848 nevertheless met the same fate as their predecessors. Austrian troops crushed uprisings in Lombardy and Venetia; French soldiers restored the pope’s authority in Rome; and the Sardinian army, which supported the rebels in Milan and Venice, proved woefully unable to match the Austrians on the battlefield and was defeated at the battles of Custoza and Novara. The rising star of Sardinian politics, Count Camillo Benso di Cavour, drew the conclusion that nationalist fervor was not by itself enough to ensure the expulsion of Austria from the peninsula: Diplomacy and economic modernization were of greater importance. Cavour became premier of the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia in 1852 and swiftly began building railways,\n\n07_244_2Intro.qxd\n\n7/23/07\n\n5:40 AM\n\nPage 9\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n• 9\n\nopening protected markets to foreign competition, and strengthening the military. In foreign policy, he cultivated Britain and France, sending a contingent of Bersaglieri to the Crimean War in 1855, thereby winning a seat at the subsequent peace conference in Paris. In 1858, at Plombières, Cavour struck a cynical secret bargain with Emperor Napoleon III of France, under the terms of which he would surrender Nice and Savoy to France in exchange for guaranteed French assistance in a defensive war with Austria. At the same conference, it was foreseen that all of northern Italy would be annexed by Sardinia, that a French prince would rule over a central Italian state, and that Naples would be ruled by a figure acceptable to the French. The three kingdoms would be organized in a loose Italian federation, with the pope as the nominal head. Cavour’s conception of a united Italy, in short, recognized the necessity for a foreign and papal role and was principally directed at extending the Savoyard Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia’s own power and ridding the peninsula of the Austrians. In the event, almost all of Italy was unified by October 1860, and King Victor Emmanuel II of Sardinia was crowned “Re d’Italia” in March 1861. In other words, Cavour obtained more for the throne of Sardinia than he had originally intended. Historians have been divided over how far his diplomatic skills were responsible for this striking success. Cavour can take credit for forcing the Austrians’ hand and tricking them into war in April 1859 and for having prepared the Sardinian army to the point where it was able to provide vital support to its French allies in the summer of 1859. But both national feeling and sheer chance played an undeniably important role. Without such incidental factors as the incompetence of Austrian diplomacy, the vainglory of Napoleon III, and the military genius of the “hero of two worlds,” Giuseppe Garibaldi, unification might have been postponed for several decades. National feeling led to the peoples of central Italy rising in support of Cavour after the outbreak of war with Austria and to their eventual annexation by Piedmont-Sardinia in the spring of 1860—although Cavour handled masterfully the diplomatic tensions caused by this move. Hostility to feudalism enabled Garibaldi to lead successful revolutions in Sicily and the rest of the South in the spring and summer of 1860 and might have led to Italian unification taking a more radical turn had Cavour not risked international displeasure by invading the Papal States and marching on Garibaldi’s headquarters in Naples in October 1860.\n\n07_244_2Intro.qxd\n\n10 •\n\n7/23/07\n\n5:40 AM\n\nPage 10\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nGaribaldi himself contributed immensely to Cavour’s success by placing his nationalist principles ahead of his republican and socialist sympathies and surrendering his conquests in southern Italy to Victor Emmanuel without bloodshed. Unification, in other words, was the outcome of a complex combination of human, diplomatic, and political factors. It remains true, however, that without Cavour’s instinctive grasp of the principles of Realpolitik, events might well have taken a vastly different turn. The Piedmontese statesman is the only Italian leader of the last two centuries who can stand comparison with such great figures in modern European history as Bismarck, Gladstone, Masaryk, Churchill, De Gaulle, and Adenauer.\n\nLIBERAL ITALY The Italy that emerged in March 1861 was essentially PiedmontSardinia writ large. The capital of the new state was Turin, the Statuto Albertino (the Constitution of 1848) was adopted in toto for the new kingdom, and almost all of the dominant political figures were Piedmontese. The North was by far the richest part of the country and the only one that was industrialized. Many of Italy’s subsequent problems can be traced to the lopsided balance of power within the new state. Southern Italy, in particular, was undeniably neglected by the northern power brokers in industry and politics and was left to stagnate—with the complicity of its own ruling class of landlords and aristocrats—as a semifeudal backwater. In addition to immense economic difficulties, the new Italian state had to complete the process of unification. Venetia, Trentino, and Trieste remained under Austrian control in 1861, and the pope’s authority in Rome was protected by a French expeditionary force that had no difficulty in crushing an attempt by Garibaldi and a small army of patriots to seize the city at the battle of Mentana in 1867. The questions of Venetia and Rome were resolved by astuteness. In 1866, Italy allied with Prussia against Austria and, despite a poor military performance, was rewarded with Venetia after the war. In 1870, the defeat of Napoleon III at the hands of Bismarck allowed Italy to march troops into Rome. Papal possessions were reduced in size to the walls of the Vatican, and for the next 50 years, church–state relations were extremely tense. The\n\n07_244_2Intro.qxd\n\n7/23/07\n\n5:40 AM\n\nPage 11\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n• 11\n\nChurch suspended all diplomatic relations with the Italian state, did its best to have Italy ostracized by Catholic nations such as France, and banned Catholics from taking part in Italian political life. Only in 1913, when the rise of socialism alarmed the Vatican hierarchy, was this ban relaxed. Italian socialism arose in particularly intransigent form because the Italian state failed, in the 30 years following unification, to provide elementary social justice. Newly unified Italy was “liberal” in the sense that it could boast parliamentary institutions, but it was not in any way democratic. Unlike Britain, where the suffrage was extended to almost all the adult male population by 1884, and where trade unions were granted significant opportunities to organize manual workers, Italian governments were reluctant to concede basic political rights to the working class. From 1876 onward, after the “parliamentary revolution” brought Agostino Depretis to power, Italy was governed by the socalled parliamentary left, but Depretis, despite many promises, failed to widen the suffrage in any significant way. An electoral law extending the suffrage from 600,000 voters to just over 2,000,000 was passed against stiff parliamentary opposition in 1882, but this was still less than 7 percent of the adult population. Having passed this law, Depretis rid himself of his more radical parliamentary supporters by appealing to the conservative opposition to “transform themselves” into a force of government (see TRASFORMISMO). Only in 1912, long after comparable European states, was universal male suffrage conceded, and the first election under these rules was held in 1913. A similarly narrow-minded view prevailed in the political class’s attitude toward socialism and trade unionism. Depretis’s successors (he died in 1887)—even former radicals such as Garibaldi’s onetime secretary, Francesco Crispi—took a harsh line with the nascent movements of the working class and peasants. Crispi used the regular army to crush a peasant revolt in Sicily in 1893–1894, and in 1898, a government that included prominent moderates suppressed bread riots in Milan with implacable zeal. Hundreds of striking workers were killed by troops commanded by General Bava Beccaris. Repression made no difference to the growth of the workers’ movements. Social conditions, including blatantly unjust systems of land tenure, made inevitable their appearance on the political scene. A greater show of tolerance, and a less ruthless defense of the propertied class’s privileges, might have led the\n\n07_244_2Intro.qxd\n\n12 •\n\n7/23/07\n\n5:40 AM\n\nPage 12\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nPartito Socialista Italiano/Italian Socialist Party (PSI), which was founded in 1892, to develop into a moderate “labor” force on the British model. Its founder, Filippo Turati, was a pragmatic figure who warned against violent revolution, and other early Socialists were willing to cooperate with relative progressives such as the several-times premier, Giovanni Giolitti, to win concrete social and political reforms. Instead, the PSI embraced both dogmatic Marxism and the violent syndicalism espoused by the French theorist Georges Sorel. By 1912, the PSI had developed an intransigence of its own. Its new voice was Benito Mussolini, who would soon quarrel with the PSI over the issue of intervention in the Great War, but who relished the turbulent mass politics offered by the labor movement.\n\nIMPERIALISM AND WAR Readiness to experiment with the politics of violence was growing on the political right too. Italy’s colonial adventures, which began with Depretis in the mid-1880s, and continued under Crispi in the 1890s, failed to leave Italy with an adequate place in the sun and, on two occasions— at Dogali in 1887 and Adowa in 1896—ended in military setbacks at the hands of Ethiopian tribesmen. By the first decade of the 20th century, nationalist theorists (including some socialists) were claiming that Italy was a “proletarian” nation that had been robbed of its birthright by rapacious powers such as Britain and France. This resentful mood led directly to a short war with Turkey that ended with Italy occupying the Dodecanese Islands, including Rhodes, and most of modern-day Libya. These gains were confirmed by the Treaty of Lausanne in October 1912. Such a minor war (only 3,000 Italians were killed) was hardly sufficient for the more headstrong members of the nationalist intelligentsia, or for “futurist” thinkers such as Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, whose Futurist Manifesto (1909) described war as the world’s only “true hygiene.” The desire for war at all costs was a decisive force in pushing Italy into war on the side of the Entente in May 1915, although a majority of the Italian people were opposed to intervention and Italy was bound by treaty to Austria and Germany. Italy had followed a pro-German foreign policy since 1882, when it joined the Triple Alliance. The Triple Al-\n\n07_244_2Intro.qxd\n\n7/23/07\n\n5:40 AM\n\nPage 13\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n• 13\n\nliance, which gave Italy an Austro-German military guarantee in the event of an aggressive French war, made perfect sense in strategic terms, but it was unpopular with a vocal section of Italian public opinion, the so-called irredentisti, who resented the fact that no effort was being made to recapture the “unredeemed” territories of Trento and Trieste. After the outbreak of war in August 1914, Italy’s leaders saw the opportunity to bargain for a return of the Italian-speaking parts of the Austrian Empire. Italy argued that it deserved compensation for entering the war, and a cynical auction took place between the two warring blocs of powers, with Austria eventually offering a generous territorial settlement in exchange for Italy’s at least remaining neutral. Giolitti famously wrote that the Central Powers had offered parecchio (a large amount) and favored neutrality. The Entente offered more, however. The Treaty of London, secretly signed in April 1915, promised to satisfy Italy’s imperial dreams in the eastern Mediterranean. Huge, intimidating public demonstrations were held by the nationalists during what was called the “radiant May,” and a climate of support for intervention was created. On 24 May 1915, Italian troops invaded Austrian-held territory near Trieste. World War I was an unmitigated disaster for Italy. Italian troops suffered hundreds of thousands of casualties vainly trying to push the AustroGerman forces back across the Isonzo River near Trieste and out of their impregnable strongholds in the Trentino and Venetian Mountains. No fewer than 11 Italian offensives took place on the Isonzo front before mounting losses and plummeting morale brought the Italians to an exhausted halt. In October 1917, an Austro-German counterattack at Caporetto made short work of the demoralized Italians, who fell back to the Piave River, almost at Venice, suffering huge losses in men and materials. Here, fighting with immense bravery, the army narrowly succeeded in holding the line. When the Austrian Empire collapsed in 1918, Italy reoccupied the territories lost in October 1917, but the defeat of Caporetto left an indelible scar on the national consciousness. World War I brought Italy fewer compensations in terms of territory or prestige than its leader had expected. Needing to placate Woodrow Wilson’s desire to construct a new Europe on the principles of self-determination, Britain and France reneged on the Treaty of London, and Italy’s dreams of establishing a colonial empire in the eastern Mediterranean were dashed.
