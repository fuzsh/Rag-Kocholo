        "text": "Abstract\n\nThe paper aims at exploring the factors responsible for the escalation of religious militancy in the Swat region of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan as well as the impacts the crisis had on the region. Key dynamics that played a significant role in the rise of unprecedented insurgency during the year 2009 are investigated. To this end, both primary and secondary data were collected during the field work in a series of interviews with informed stakeholders in the case study area. Evidence indicates that the crisis of militancy was not the product of a single factor as is commonly pointed out. The analysis shows that there are various issues including ideological, political, constitutional, judicial and administrative factors that paved the way for the intensification of religious extremism and militancy in the Swat valley. Among the ideological and religious factors, the first Afghan War as well as the on-going ‘war on terror’ greatly fuelled militancy in the region. Concerning political, judicial and administrative factors, the incomplete merger of the Swat State with Pakistan and lack of good governance and judicial reforms over a long period of time also increased frustration among the local population, the factor tactfully exploited by Taliban militants in Swat. While the study focuses on District Swat in Pakistan, this research has broader implications in relevant settings of weak governance and fragile situations where central governments are unable to establish their writ and authority."
