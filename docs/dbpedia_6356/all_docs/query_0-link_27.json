In two weeks the strike spread to railways and factories across the northern industrial belt. Mussolini, shaken, ordered the arrest of hundreds of workers.

On July 25th,  he was deposed, arrested and replaced by his Chief of Staff, Marshal Badoglio. With the regime's weakening lifting, the socialists and communists began to emerge from the underground and organise openly. Badoglio opened secret negotiations with the allies, which resulted in an armistice, the Armistice of Cassibile, on September 3rd.\n\n\n\nThe result was chaos as dozens of Italian divisions were deployed in the Balkans and a few still in Russia.

The German occupation of Italy took place over the week of 12th – 19th September to deter Romania, Hungary and Finland from following the same path, and to stop the allies advancing north to the very border of the Reich. Rome was occupied on September 10th after a bitter battle with partisans at Porta San Paulo. The King and Badoglio fled to Brindisi, thus destroying their credibility.\n\n\n\nAcross Italy partisans began a guerrilla war against the Germans and their Italian puppets. This was dramatised in the Roberto Rossellini film ‘Paisan’ in which the partisans attack the occupiers from the marshes along the Adriatic coast. The activation of working-class resistance to the Nazis terrified the allies, who at all costs needed to preserve the rule of capital in Italy and Europe.\n\n\n\nThe declaration of war on Germany by the Badoglio government on October 13th was part of a strategy by the Italian ruling class to save themselves and their property  from their own people, and by the western powers to try to prevent workers liberating themselves across Italy and maybe setting up some sort of socialist or communist government. This strategy was picked up by Ted Grant and brilliantly analysed in his “Aid the Italian Revolution’ of 1943.
