        "text": "This article consists of interviews with five world experts on the memory of Fascism. Taking the centenary of the March on Rome as an opportunity to rethink the development of Italian collective memory, the five interviewees were asked to reflect on different aspects of the Italian memory of Fascism, addressing the dominant conceptualisations, limits, and transformations of the discourses used to narrate Fascism in Italian culture. The result of these conversations, which touch upon issues related to the memory of the Resistance, the Second World War, the Holocaust, and colonialism, is a rich overview of the main trends and current trajectories of Italian memory culture, which can help us imagine the future directions of the Italian memory of Fascism and enhance interventions in this field by memory scholars and memory activists.\n\nMoving from an article written by the American historian Ruth Ben-Ghiat concerning the relationship between Italian people and the monumental legacy of Italy’s Fascist past, this paper aims to tackle the broader issue of Collective Memory of Italian Fascism. Namely, the memory of a rather benign form of totalitarianism which is not stained by the horrible crimes of its Nazi counterpart, and towards which the Italian population – because of its inherent goodness - never totally adhere to. To determine the way in which this image established itself, the topic is approached through the tools supplies by Memory Studies, in an attempt to identify those intellectual and cultural traditions which have framed this particular representation of the past and those active memory agents who selectively adapted and manipulated history. In particular, attention is given to the specificity of the historical period in which the process of establishing a collective memory took place, the failure of the purges against the Fascists and the lack of persecution against war criminals, which lead to a misleading evaluation of the legacy of Fascism and the war. Furthermore, active agents of memory are individuated in the work of the scholars who dealt with the history of Fascism, in the Allies and the propaganda techniques they deployed during the war, and finally in the visual media and their active role in forging specific exculpatory memories. What this paper ascertains, therefore, is how these policies of re-elaboration of the national past mainly pointed towards establishing an aura of social amnesia around Fascism, its crimes and the connivance of Italian people. This collective amnesia, however, left gaps and ‘black holes’ into the collective memory of Italians. As this paper argues, these gaps were fulfilled thanks to a constant comparison with Nazi Germany and the brutality of its crimes, thus establishing what is known as the ‘bad Germans/good Italians’ trope which is central in evaluating what has established itself to be the collective memory of Italian Fascism.\n\nThis dissertation intends to retrace and critically reconstruct the multiple, and sometimes intimately diverging, trajectories followed by the literary memory of the anti-Jewish persecution in the territories of postwar Italian literature. Specific attention has been accorded to areas and segments of this cultural field that have generally remained at the margins of scholarly inquiry, with a methodological choice has resulted both in a hermeneutic recuperation of texts that have been object of a precocious rejection and perduring disinterest in the cultural economy of the memory of the Shoah in Italy – as it is the case with Otto ebrei by Giacomo Debenedetti – and in an excavation intended to explore literary genres generally excluded from critical mappings of Italian literature about the Jewish genocide – such as poetry, theatrical works, or accounts and memoirs authored Fascist and post-Fascist writers. In bringing at the center of the scrutiny forms of expressions and corresponding intellectual sedimentations previously relegated at the margins of the critical debate, this interpretive reorientation has been thus intended to highlight a series of conceptual and critical articulations that inhabit and at the same time problematize the literary memory of the Shoah in postwar Italy. The identification these “memory perspectivisms” has represented the primary intellectual goal pursued in Counter-memory, Autofictions, (Anti)Poetry: Rethinking Holocaust Literature in Postwar Italy. The first of these literature/memory articulations, is represented by what I termed as a literary “counter-memory” of the Shoah in postwar Italy. The second critical segment of this dissertation has scrutinized what I proposed to call post-Fascist, autofictional narratives of the persecution. The theoretical and cultural implications of the problematic literary paradox raised by Theodor Adorno in 1947 – “writing poetry after Auschwitz is barbaric” – have been at the center of the fourth chapter of the dissertation, dedicated to a critical reconstruction of the intellectual genealogies that shaped the field of poetic memories of the Jewish genocide in postwar Italy. The fifth and concluding chapter of the dissertation, instead, has been dedicated to a literary genre thus far substantially neglected in critical studies about Italian literature on the Shoah, that of theatrical representations."
