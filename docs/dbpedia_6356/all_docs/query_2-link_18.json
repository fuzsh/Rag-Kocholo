        "text": "This essay explores the 1950s as a space of cultural transition through two bodies of iconic images: Tazio Secchiaroli’s 1958 reportage of Aiché Nanà’s striptease and Franco Pinna’s documentation of the rituals of mourning during his work in Salento with anthropologist Ernesto de Martino. Produced on the eve of the miracolo economico, these images are iconic condensations of the contrasting cultural horizons defining the national imaginary of 1950s Italy. Challenging the self-containment of these images, the essay journeys outside the frames into the surrounding historical, cultural and geographical landscapes. To explore how, through photography, Italy visually negotiated the persistence of the past and the advent of modernity, the author traces a genealogy of Italian photography from political action to paparazzismo and examines the significance of the ethnographic journey to the south. Pinna’s photography and de Martino’s ethnography emerge as sites where post-war Italy faces the intractable realities of death and the return of a ‘bad’ past. The essay investigates how ritual mourning engages the photographic image to reveal an amnesiac culture of the spectacle exposing Italy’s relation to history as a modern repressed.\n\nIn Cinema, the landscape presents itself to the viewer in its complexity relative to the plot. The viewer, in turn, translates the images of this landscape through their own personal issues, which influence the way they perceive their spaces, because, in addition to the viewer's perceptive capacity, their knowledge, feelings and beliefs come into play, which in turn are shaped by historical, social and cultural aspects of the place. Thus, while the landscape is, in itself, a witness element of the story to be told and of its own history, the spectator (or observer) is also a witness to the processes that occur in the space presented to him, which redefine its meanings based on of the proposed diegesis. Thus, through analysis of the film: ``Uma Estranha Passagem em Veneza`` (The Comfort of Strangers), 1990, directed by Paul Schrader and based on the novel by writer Ian McEwan (``Ao Deus Dar``, 1981), we present discussions on interdisciplinary concepts, reflections and definitions, between cinema and studies relating to the philosophy of landscape, both as an element of observation and as a filmic element. To this end, we used reflections from authors such as Berque (2010), Simmel (2009), Lynch (2018), Aumont (1999), among others. The landscape in this case is the city of Venice (Italy), where the plot takes place. City destination for thousands of tourists who are attracted by its historic landscape. In this sense, Venice has its image transformed in the filmic conception, so that the destination landscape of (new) possible lives becomes configured as a landscape of death."
