        "text": "About Christian persecution in Pakistan\n\nPakistan was not founded as a Muslim country. But against the wishes of its founder, it became one in 1956. General Zia-ul Haq, who ruled from 1980 to 1986, aligned with extreme Muslims and introduced the world’s most infamous blasphemy laws, enabling Christian persecution in Pakistan to take root; merely accusing a believer of slandering the Prophet Muhammed brings automatic jail time.\n\nPersecuted Pakistani Christians form a quarter of the thousands accused—and one can languish for years in prison without action. Subsequent governments in Pakistan have tried to relax the regulations, but the culture has continued to Islamicize; it is estimated that extremist mullahs control over 20% of the population with their violent ideologies. While religious conversion is technically allowed, in practice Islamist mobs are continually mobilized to control Christians and keep them on the defensive."
