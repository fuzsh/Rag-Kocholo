        "text": "A 43-year age difference didn’t stop these two from having some fun in the sun.\n\nAoki Lee Simmons, 21, was spotted kissing restaurateur Vittorio Assaf, 65, during a romantic vacation to St. Barts on Tuesday.\n\nIn photos obtained by Page Six exclusively, the youngest daughter of Kimora Lee Simmons and Russell Simmons packed on the PDA with the much-older Serafina co-founder while enjoying time at a beach.\n\nAt one point, Aoki posed for Assaf as he took pictures of her with his phone. They also took a dip in the clear blue water and shared a steamy kiss while on the white sand.\n\nThe model wore an olive-green bikini with a tribal print on the front, while Assaf went shirtless, only sporting a pair of light-blue-and-white-printed swim trunks.\n\nPage Six reached out to reps for both Aoki and Assaf for comment but did not immediately hear back.\n\nOn Friday, Aoki posted some snaps from her trip to the Caribbean island on Instagram — but she notably did not include her beau in any of them.\n\n“Girls (possibly mermaids!) on film,” she captioned a carousel of pictures of herself posing in a bikini near a huge rock.\n\nAnd on March 27, she shared a video of herself on a beach wearing the same bikini as she did in the photos we obtained of her and Assaf together.\n\nThe Milan-born businessman also posted pictures from his trip, featuring one of his friends whom he said he has known for “25 years.”\n\nAssaf made headlines in 2021 when his now-ex-wife, former model Charlotte Bonstrom, left him after having an affair with her twin sister’s ex-husband, Thierry Gillier.\n\n“Charlotte and I are in the process of getting divorced — she wants to get remarried,” Assaf told Page Six at the time. “[She] is getting married to Thierry Gillier, the ex-husband of her sister.”\n\nAssaf and Bonstrom were married for more than 20 years and share two kids: Vittorio Jr. and Valentina.\n\nThe restaurateur was most recently linked to 24-year-old model Nya Gatbel.\n\nFor more Page Six you love…\n\nListen to our weekly “We Hear” podcast\n\nShop our exclusive merch\n\nMeanwhile, Aoki is typically private in her personal life.\n\nLast February, however, she shared a picture with her then-boyfriend in honor of Valentine’s Day.\n\nAoki clapped back at haters after the photo was met with backlash from fans who questioned why the Harvard grad — whose mom is Japanese and Korean and dad is African American — was dating outside her race.\n\n“It’s genuinely so awful. How is any young person supposed to have a normal well adjusted life if this is what happens over a Godamn [sic] tagless valentines day post?!” she wrote on her Instagram Stories at the time.\n\n“Sure I guess I knew the world was stuck in 1950 and would have some recessive & to say about something as simple as an interracial relationship……. Like that’s truly sad, especially from people of color, but it was expected.”"
