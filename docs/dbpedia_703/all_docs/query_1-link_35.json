        "text": "Well, after a long time of waiting, I finally got a sealed copy of \"Southern Tracks & Fantasies\".\n\nI have an old copy of this but it has seen much better days but I know EVERY pop, crack and distorted sound on that thing.\n\nI took some peak levels from my original copy to prepare for a needle-drop of my new album. (all is good).\n\nCarefully opened my new treasure and made sure it was nice 'n clean.\n\nWhile listening to the new copy (while transfering it to computer) I noticed that some of those blimished noises that I heard on my original was, infact, on the new one! (No sweat... can deal with that with a few tweaks)\n\nNow I was begining to wonder if I was imagining all of these sounds from years of listening to my original (very worn) copy but unfortionatly the computer don't lie.\n\nMy original came from a radio station (way back in 1976) and marked as a promotional copy.. Even has the promotional stamp on the back cover.\n\nThe new, sealed, one doesn't have a stamp BUT has \"promotional copy not for sale\" marked on the lable of the record itself.\n\nCurious to know if anybody has a retail version of this and have they noticed if their presssing is on the shoddy-side or was it only the promotional copies that were a bit naff?\n\nOutside of that, I personally regard Mr. Davis as a great songwriter (even befor his \"I go crazy\" era (though a beautiful song) and wonder if anybody has an idea of what he's doing now days?\n\nAll well, time to burn that needle-drop and enjoy!!!\n\nAll of his albums are on Bang, as far as I know. Sony owns the company's masters. They have issues at least two greatest hits-type CDs. I have no idea why any of his albums have not been issued on CD. A small company RSI has issued an album by the band Brick, through Sony Music special products division. I am unhappy with the sound because it is light on the bass and is EQ'd high in the midrange.\n\nActually, Steve put \"Ain't Gonna Hurt Nobody\" on a CD years ago. Perhaps he can tell us what the tapes actualy sound like.\n\nPaul Davis moved over to Arista in the early 80's after his tenure at Bang Records. His biggest hits there were \"Cool Night\" and my personal fave \"'65 Love Affair\".\n\nI would love to see Sony Legacy reissue \"Good High\" and \"Brick\" on CD. I love both of those albums and Brick is seriously under represented on CD.\n\nI have been a long time fan of Paul Davis and his career is a bit tricky to follow but here is what I have found thru research about his music!\n\nPaul began his professional music career as a songwriter/performer for \"Malaco Records\" back in the mid 60's. Most of what Paul Davis recorded or wrote for them was released on the box set called \"The Last Soul Company\" Malaco A Thirty-year Retrospective. Bert Burns over at \"Bang Records\" lured him there and between 1970 and 1982, Paul placed 15 records on Billboard's Pop Charts, 12 of which were on \"Bang\", the rest were on \"Arista\". As for Paul on compact disc, the \"BANG\" years have only been represented on 2 \"Best Of\" comps and a rare \"Promo-only\" 2 CD set called \"WEB IV MUSIC\" which contained a few unreleased Paul Davis songs along with many of other artists hits that were \"WEB IV\" published songs! Also the great album called \"Paul Davis\" (that featured the hit \"Do Right\") was released in Japan only in 1991 on Sony Records (Great sound quality!) His only Arista album \"Cool Night\" was also released in Japan on CD also in 1991 (Flat and lifeless sound) and that the same album was also released on CD in the U.S. on K-Tel or a subsidary of K-Tel. (I don't have that one and can't confirm it's sound quality) None of his other Bang albums have been released on CD that I'm aware of!\n\nAfter Paul's Arista album, he cut a few songs for movie soundtracks including...\"The Karate Kid\" and \"About Last Night! Then he became very popular as a Nashville songwriter penning many country hits like \"Bop\" for Dan Seals, \"Meet Me In Montana\" by Dan Seals & Marie Osmond, \"Ypu're Still New To Me\" by Paul Davis, Marie Osmond & Paul Overstreet and a few Tanya Tucker tunes!\n\nI also read that Paul was also actually shot at as he was an innocent bystander during a robbery. He survived the gunshot!\n\nIn the late 90's there was a bit of noise being made that the old \"BANG RECORDS\" was reforming as \"BANG II RECORDS\" and while a few country releases did come out on BANG II, there was a proposed and recorded (I believe) new album from Paul Davis that unfortuantly never saw the light of day because BANG II went belly up before it's release! I was truly saddened that Paul's chance to \"Ride 'em\" again was not to be! With so many internet record companies and small distributers like CD BABY and the such out there today, I would hope that Paul COULD record again, if he wishes!\n\nHope that helps with your questions about Paul Davis?\n\nChris C"
