        "text": "1 / 5\n\nStatement black eyeliner\n\nNo indie sleaze adjacent eye look is complete without dramatic eyeliner. However, as striking as the long wings Charli’s sporting lately, they can be intimating to draw.\n\n“For eyeliner you can use two pieces of tape to balance both sides before you start. Extend the line’s thickness step by step,” advises local make-up artist, Wee Ming. “Once you’re done drawing both sides, you may remove the tape.”\n\nIf you prefer a softer affair or don’t feel confident using liquid eyeliner, you can opt for a retractable gel liner for better control over your lines. Afraid your eyeliner will fade from a sweaty night out? “My advice is prepare some cotton buds. I wouldn’t advise applying much powder around the eye areas as it could enhance fine lines and make your eye make-up look more heavy,” states Wee Ming.\n\nLife Liner Quick ‘n Easy Precision Liquid Liner\n\nHuda Beauty\n\n$34\n\nEpic Ink Liner\n\nNYX\n\n$19.90\n\n2 / 5\n\nSmokey eyeshadow\n\nThey’re the make-up world’s equivalent to a club classic, but Charli XCX gives them a brat makeover with a limited palette of neutral browns and sharp wings radiating from the outer corners for an edgy look.\n\n“You may start with a light brown shade on your eyelids, then add layers of darker browns over it. To contour your eye sockets, you may use a sharp-tipped brush to extend the darkest hue to the end corners to make it sharper,” says Wee Ming. “For the lower lids, you can use a slim brush to blend your brown shadows starting from the inner to outer corners. Lastly, use a clean brush to brighten the inner corners, preferably in a champagne or light beige shade. To give it a defined shape, you may use black eye pencil to line your lash line.”\n\nAlternatively, you can opt for a Y2K style with a colourful, eye-catching shade and pair it with bleached eyebrows for maximum impact.\n\nRimmel Magnif'eyes Eye Contouring Palette Nude Edition\n\nRimmel\n\n$18\n\nSephora Collection 12H Retractable Waterproof Eyeliner in 01 Matte Black\n\nSephora Collection\n\n$20\n\n3 / 5\n\nBare base\n\nA look strong enough to withstand the humidity of both our climate and the club doesn’t need to utilise elaborate contouring methods or full coverage—after all, expressing yourself is key to authentically executing the brat girl look. Thus, don’t pressure yourself to cake on more layers of foundation than you need.\n\n“Keep foundation as light as possible for our humid weather. For it to last throughout long hours, you can use a layer of loose powder.” Wee Ming asserts.\n\nIf you are not in the mood for foundation, you can opt for a tinted moisturiser instead, which has all the coverage with none of the density that comes with traditional foundations.\n\nKVD Vegan Beauty Good Apple Skin-Perfecting Foundation Balm\n\nKVD Beauty\n\n$65\n\nClé De Peau Beauté Concealer\n\nClé De Peau Beauté\n\n$115\n\n4 / 5\n\nNude lips\n\nThe brat girl look is all about the eyes, so it’s best to keep the rest of your face minimal. Go for a shade similar to your natural lip colour. If you’re aiming to sport a bolder look, use a darker lip liner for the outer corners and pair it with an unsaturated nude shade with grey undertones.\n\nWhen asked about advice, Wee Ming claims, “It’s best to use a lip liner before and after applying your nude lipstick.”\n\nNot in the mood for lipstick, or just want to further simplify your look? Go for a tinted lip balm or skip colour entirely with a plain one to keep your lips hydrated.\n\nTarte Maracuja Juicy Plumping Lip Oil in Buffed Rose\n\nTarte\n\n$42\n\nMake Up For Ever Artist Colour Pencil in 608 Limitless Brown\n\nMake Up For Ever\n\n$35\n\n5 / 5\n\nTousled hair\n\nLike the ’80s Club Kids and the indie sleaze rockers that live on in the brat girl, a volumous and deliberately unkept mane is a statement maker. Simply add a styling paste or hairspray with dry shampoo or a sea-salt spray and scrunch your hair with your hands. The amount of teasing and product you need to use will depend on your hair type and density, but it’s best to put more focus on the middle section and the crown for maximum texture.\n\nBetter yet, lightly detangle your bedhead first thing in the morning and incorporate a texturing paste to hold it in place.\n\nKevin Murphy Anti-Gravity Spray\n\nKevin Murphy\n\n$47\n\nHanz de Fuko Claymation\n\nHanz de Fuko\n\n$35"
