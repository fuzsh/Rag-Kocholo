        "text": "At ease with the thought…\n\nReleased: May 1982\n\nSong history: Written by lead singer Gordon Deppe, it was released as the first single from the band’s second album Arias and Symphonies in May 1982, and became the band’s first hit.\n\nHighest chart position in Canada: #40! (I guess it hit the charts for 9 weeks? Still, #40! “Arias and Symphonies” made it to #18 and it didn’t appear on this list!)\n\nFun fact: The music video was the first ever played on MuchMusic (Canada’s answer to MTV).\n\nMy take: 100!!!\n\nAre you hype? I’m hype as HELL. This Sunday will be my top 10 of the year, followed by a few honourable mentions–excellent songs that managed to garner some Canadian chart success, but didn’t crack the top 100. Ones that I’m actually excited to talk about. Yay!\n\nI’m also hype because after a disappointing 90s, “Nova Heart” reverses the trend, bringing us a catchy, well-written new wave hit–the sort of thing that I was hoping more of the year would be filled with. (No, that year in Canadian musical history is 1980, in which tracks by XTC, Martha and the Muffins, the B-52′s, the Vapors, the Flying Lizards, and the Boomtown Rats all became massive hits. If I ever did another year, I’d be sorely tempted by 1980 for that alone.) At any rate, “Nova Heart” is a great tune, with a rich synth hook, a bouncy bass line, lovely background vocals, and loads of atmosphere.\n\nIt’s kind of neat seeing a Spoons song in the top 100, even if it is right there at #100. If you’re not Canadian, you’d have to dig pretty deep to find Spoons in the new wave encyclopedia; unlike Martha and the Muffins or Men Without Hats, they didn’t have any hits outside of their homeland. And even here, their hits never cracked the top 10 (although with Canadian content laws being what they are, you still tend to hear them a lot on the radio).\n\nSpoons’ bread-and-butter is melodic, high-energy synthpop with overwrought lyrical metaphors. (“You’ve been camera-shy! In my life!”, or maybe “She’s losing him in romantic traffic!”) Of course, I couldn’t make that assertion if I hadn’t consumed a significant portion of their discography; I’m a big fan. More than anything, I just love how much energy they have, and “Nova Heart” is a great example. In the context of the album, Arias and Symphonies, it’s actually one of the more downtempo tracks–which says a lot, doesn’t it? That a song this dynamic can be considered a “slow” track? But I think that works to its advantage. Some of Spoons’ songs move at such a breakneck pace that the lyrical sentiment is lost, but “Nova Heart” is just slow enough to bring out its emotion. And the metaphor they used isn’t as contrived as usual; instead, it’s thoughtful and elegant.\n\nIn general, the lyrics are some of the best I’ve encountered in a long time. They take a bit of interpreting, but they are interpretable (unlike “Cat People”) and not embarrassingly dashed-off (unlike everything else in the 90s). They introduce, flesh out, and sustain a particular concept, and do so in a novel way. “Nova Heart”’s verses explore themes of creation and (impending) destruction, and the chorus always comes back to the narrator’s wish to sleep in the “nova heart” of his lover. Not only sleep, but rest, and even hide–the world outside is intimidating and scary, but he can at least count on one nova not to burn out. Very nice.\n\nBut as good as the lyrics are, the music is even better. It’s all about the layers–layers of synthesizer, layers of harmonies, even layers of drum machines. (I’m here for it.) They all work with each other rather than against, creating a listening experience that’s at once invigorating and calming. If I had to pick out my favourite element, it’d be Sandy Horne’s lighter-than-air background vocals. Her voice is the band’s secret weapon, and it’s put to fantastic use on “Nova Heart”’s chorus, where her simple oohs and ahhs add a sense of peace to the dynamic synths. That goes for the whole song, in fact–through and through, the music reflects the lyrics. The verses, with all of their fiery energy, reflect the narrator’s tension, while the chorus slows things down and adds a soothing element to show that there’s at least one force of calm in his life.\n\nIf this hadn’t been in the top 100, I would’ve seriously considered giving it an honourable mention, that’s how good it is. It’s simply on another level from most of what I’ve reviewed. You’d think that most songs would have music that closely reflects the lyrics; turns out, only a few of them do. And those few songs tend to be my absolute favourites. Combine that with a great rhythm, good lyrics, and loads of synths and you have one of the best tunes I’ve reviewed all year. The only thing that’s missing is good lead vocals. I’m not the biggest fan of Gordon Deppe’s Overdramatic Canadian New Wave Singing Voice (it’s a thing), and he lays it on a bit thick here. But that’s it. The rest of the song is magic. I also have to say, it’s grown on me a lot–I never thought I’d be rating it what I am, given how much I like other songs on the album more, but yeah, it’s a damn good one as well.\n\nAlso, go listen to Arias and Symphonies if you like fast-paced, atmospheric synthpop. Great album.\n\nMy rating: 9/10. An excellent way to close out the year.\n\nDon’t it make ya feel alright!\n\nReleased: 1982 (began climbing the charts in August)\n\nSong history: Headpins was Chilliwack’s side project in the ‘80s, featuring powerhouse vocalist Darby Mills as well as Chilliwack’s main songwriters, Brian “Too Loud” MacLeod and Bill Henderson. They cowrote this track for the band’s 1982 debut album Turn it Loud.\n\nHighest chart position in Canada: #14\n\nFun fact: Counting this song, MacLeod and Henderson have written the most hits of 1982, with four hits under their belt. (Hall and Oates are the next most prolific hitmakers with three.)\n\nMy take: Along with blatant ‘60s nostalgia grabs, another interesting microgenre that’s popped up in 1982 is stripped-down, wailing, glammish, balls-to-the-wall hard rock, driven by searing guitar chords and a gutsy female vocalist. We saw it with Joan Jett, Toronto, and now Headpins, who turn in a rather minor entry. I think in a year so overloaded with this kind of rock, “Don’t It Make Ya Feel” doesn’t really stand out. It’s got a good sense of energy, but it’s surprisingly tuneless for MacLeod and Henderson, whose songs this year are packed with hooks.\n\nIt could be that I’m not a big fan of call-and-response choruses where the real melody is the “call,” while the “response” is just belting out parts of the “call”. Which is exactly what this song is. I’m someone who loves her hooks and wants her choruses to be the catchiest, most singable parts of the song, and in that department, this tune is lacking. There’s no denying that Darby Mills has a powerful voice, but it’s only put to good use in the verses, which are considerably better than the chorus. Mills is allowed to flex her vocal muscles in a way that’s tuneful and enjoyable to listen to, and also, that guitar riff is nice–glammish and fun.\n\nAside from that, though, there’s little for me to recommend in “Don’t It Make Ya Feel.” The best way to describe it is “uninspiring.” Uninspiring and uninspired. Apart from a few moments in the music, I don’t hear anything of what made Chilliwack so great in this song. The excellent vocals, beautiful harmonies, sharp songwriting, and musical twists are gone. Instead, we have dull, generic party lyrics (which are quickly attaining their place in my book as the #2 most boring pop song topic, right behind love), married to a tired rock sound, all helmed by a talented singer whose talents are squandered by a boring chorus. Those pluses I listed above? That’s all there is. And while I wouldn’t consider this a “bad song” per se–I can listen to it the whole way through and not cringe–I can’t see it growing on me the same way that “Fantasy” did, all because the hooks aren’t there.\n\nMy rating: 4/10. Serious meh. It’s a shame, because I love MacLeod and Henderson as songwriters, but this ain’t doin’ it for me.\n\nLife is just a fantasy, can you live this fantasy life!\n\nReleased: March 1982\n\nSong history: Written and produced by Aldo Nova in 1982 for his self-titled debut, “Fantasy” was inspired by Nova’s first trip to New York–he hadn’t left his hometown of Montreal until he was 21, and the big city inspired him. It became a surprise hit in both his native Canada and the US, reaching the American top 30 (#23).\n\nHighest chart position in Canada: #14\n\nFun fact: Aldo Nova went on to be a big name in the music industry–not just in Canada but internationally, as both a producer and a songwriter. He’s worked with such artists as Bon Jovi, Celine Dion, Blue Oyster Cult, and Clay Aiken, whose Nova-cowritten “This is the Night” became the best-selling single of 2003.\n\nMy take: It’s easy to see why Aldo Nova became such a behind-the-scenes superstar. His debut single “Fantasy” proves why. It’s got two things going for it: it’s catchy as hell, and it’s forward-thinking. An ear for hooks and an eye to the future are both dynamite qualities to have as a songwriter/producer, so it’s no wonder that he attained all that success.\n\nBut does that make “Fantasy” a good song? Well…er…it’s not something I enjoy listening to, and I’ll tell you why. Yes, it’s catchy, but it’s not a sort of catchiness that has much to it after a few listens. But more importantly, the genre that it precedes is…not my favourite, to say the least.\n\n“Fantasy” sounds like late ‘80s hair-metal. It’s there in the overproduced, dissonant rhythmical synths; it’s there in the crunching guitar chords; and it’s there in Nova’s over-the-top performance. (It’s also there in the music video, which features Nova in a skin-tight leopard jumpsuit, wielding a guitar as a laser-shooting weapon. For the record, I am entirely here for the music video.) I’m not a fan of most late ‘80s music, and hair-metal is one of my least favourite genres, so I don’t have much use for this musically. Mainly, it’s those synths I don’t like. They’re loud, relentless, atonal, and blaring, and they just don’t sound good to me. And they’re all over the song.\n\nIt’s also a deeply, deeply cheesy tune, and while cheese has its merits for pure entertainment/novelty value, it doesn’t make for a good repeated listen. There are just too many things in this song that make me roll my eyes. The starry-eyed lyrics (composed of big-city cliches), the whispered “it’s just a fantasy,” the glammish falsetto harmonies, the aforementioned synths…it all becomes too much, and it pulls down the genuinely good elements in the song, of which there are a few. The synth riff is actually pretty badass, and the guitar solo is fantastic, one of the best I’ve heard all year. In a more subtle, less over-the-top song, these could be highlights. But in “Fantasy,” they end up getting lost in the shuffle, just another symbol of its excess. The song turns a rockin’ guitar solo into a rawkin’ guitar solo, man!\n\nI dunno. Listening to it more and more, I find that “Fantasy” isn’t as bad as I’ve made it out to be. I’m not inclined to be too harsh on it. It’s a sturdily written pop tune that has its naive charms. I can’t say it’s a great song, or even a good one, but it’s is solidly okay. And it laid the groundwork for Nova’s career as a hitmaker, so there’s that.\n\nMy rating: 6/10. I’ll give it a pass.\n\nSee these eyes so green…\n\nReleased: March 1982\n\nSong history: In 1981, producers began work on a remake of the classic ‘40s horror film Cat People. For the music, they commissioned disco pioneer Giorgio Moroder, who teamed up with David Bowie to cowrite the movie’s lead single, “Cat People (Putting Out Fire)”. It was released as a single a month before the movie’s release, and while it became a massive hit in several European countries (hitting the top 10 in Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland), it was only a minor hit in Bowie’s native UK (#26), as well as a blip on the US charts (#67). It did considerably better in Canada, peaking at…\n\nHighest chart position in Canada: #13\n\nFun fact: This is a song with a lot of re-releases: three times in the span of 1982, as well as a completely new re-recording for Bowie’s 1983 album Let’s Dance. The re-recording features one of the first appearances by Stevie Ray Vaughn.\n\nMy take: Uh…hmm. Okay.\n\nIt appears I’ve bitten off more than I can chew. I’ve been coasting through the last few reviews, and I could get away with that because hey–the songs weren’t putting in any effort, why should I? Except now, when I run into a song that has thought and intelligent writing put into it, I have to devote a similar level of effort to the review. And as it happens, I don’t know this song; I started my listening process on a Friday this time; and I’m utterly unprepared to tackle a song with any amount of creativity or depth.\n\nBlah blah blah, you don’t care about my writing process, you came for the review. So let’s get to it. I have to say, I like “Cat People.” A lot. It’s got a great groove, nice singing, some fantastic “Young Americans”-ish background vocals, and a real sense of energy. It reminds me more of the ‘70s than the ‘80s, which is refreshing after a slew of hits whose only distinguishing characteristic was being very ‘80s. And it’s just plain fun.\n\nOne of the reasons it recalls the ‘70s is that slow-building intro, which is something a lot of disco songs did. (Maybe that’s where Moroder fits in.) That combined with the prog-ish organs lends it an appealing old-school vibe. In fact, aside from a light wash of synths, you’d be hard-pressed to tell that this was from the ‘80s. The music is the song’s best element. I love the organs and keyboards, I love the tough-yet-relaxed rhythm, and I especially love those background vocals (been so looooong!).\n\nThose background vocalists are a more essential part of the chorus than Bowie himself, although he holds his own. I actually like his singing on this quite a bit. Bowie’s vocals are the main sticking point for my loving him as an artist–as a singer, he can be hit-or-miss. He’s got this thick, dramatic baritone that he can do a lot with, but sometimes he insists on singing in registers that just don’t suit him. (See also: OMD’s Andy McCluskey.) On this, though? He’s great. Like Phil Collins on “Abacab,” he takes the nonsensical lyrics and turns them into a story. His performance is a lil’ hammy, but it totally works. I mean, c’mon. He’s putting out the fire…with gasoline!\n\nSo do the lyrics to “Cat People” have anything to do with the movie? I have no idea. Songfacts tells me that apparently it was thrown into the credits, not really used in the movie, so I get the sense that the song was incidental, and thus the lyrics didn’t really need to connect. They cycle through a series of different eye colours, tortured emotional sentiments, and overwrought metaphors, and they don’t tell a cohesive narrative (which I’d prefer). But they do have some thought put into them, at least. That’s more than I can say for most of the songs this year.\n\nHonestly, while I like “Cat People” a lot more than I thought I would, it’s never going to be an all-time fave for me. I’m putting together my top 10 list from this year, and there’s no way this will be on it. On the list of “pleasant surprises,” sure. But it’s not quite there yet; the chorus isn’t tuneful enough and the lyrics don’t hit that hard. Regardless, it is a pleasant surprise, and it’s a breath of fresh air after the deluge of mediocrity that’s been the 90s.\n\nMy rating: 7/10. Not bad, David Bowie. Not bad at all.\n\nRock’n’roll was simple and clear!\n\nReleased: February 1982\n\nSong history: Davis had recently moved record labels from Bang Records to Arista, who convinced him to go in a poppier direction (he was previously a folk-country artist). Originally titled “‘55 Love Affair,” the song’s year was changed to ‘65 to appeal to a younger audience, though all the references were still stuck in the ‘50s. This was his most commercially successful hit, peaking at #6 in the States.\n\nHighest chart position in Canada: #11\n\nFun fact: The music video is composed entirely of news articles from 1965.\n\nMy take: Okay, so “Did it in a Minute” wasn’t cut-rate Hall and Oates. This is. They don’t play this much on the radio anymore, apparently, because “’65 Love Affair” was completely new to me. The first time I heard it, I was like “what is this backwater Hall and Oates-lite doo-wop bullshit?” And another lesson I’ve learned: it’s only gonna make a bad song worse if you review it on a Thursday, because then you have to listen to it four days in a row.\n\nOf all the blatant ‘60s nostalgia-grabs that I’ve covered this year, “’65 Love Affair” is the worst. And I’m not the only one who thinks it sucks. Multiple sources claim that Davis was so disgusted by it that he pretty much dropped out of the recording industry for the rest of his career, only guest-starring on a couple of country duets throughout the ‘80s. (A bit sad, really, considering that he had begun to dip his toe back into the musical waters right before his untimely death in 2008.) The lyrics read like a list of ‘50s/’60s buzzwords and name-checks (when they’re not your standard done-to-death love song), the music combines the worst tendencies of ‘60s and early ‘80s pop, and the rhythm is absolutely awful.\n\nThat last one, in my opinion, is the greatest sin. You all know how important rhythm is to me right now, and when I first listened to this song, it was all I could fixate on. I get what they’re going for with the whole midcentury vibe and the hard, rudimentary drumming, but it comes across less Ronettes and more…Sesame Street. It’s so on-the-beat, and while it might not be so bad on the verses, on the chorus it works against the music and just sounds awkward. They should’ve done something to vary it up, maybe even dropped the rhythm entirely, because what they did doesn’t work at all. The synthesized, unnatural handclaps don’t help. And the more the song goes on, the more lifeless it sounds.\n\nBut in general, the song’s music is lacking. This whole ‘60s-meets-’80s vibe has rarely worked in the singles I’ve covered, partly because in the ‘80s, melodies and music had evolved so much that anything looking back only highlighted how simple rock used to be. And while that’s the intended appeal of “’65 Love Affair”, it’s not done in an appealing way. Hearing the mix of ‘80s organs and synthesizers makes you wonder why they didn’t just pick one and stick with it. It’s like they’re regressing while they’re progressing. As for the singing, Davis might’ve been a fine vocalist, but his talents are put to poor use here–he ain’t no Daryl Hall, and because the music recalls Hall and Oates so much, that’s heard as a weakness. The harmonies are passable for the most part, except for the mega-low “yeahs”, which unfavourably recall Wham’s “Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go”. (Yeah, yeah, that song came out years afterwards. I don’t care. It was stupid there and it was stupid here.)\n\nNow let me make it clear–this isn’t the worst song I’ve heard this year. I can listen to it the whole way through, and the melody isn’t bad; I can tolerate having it stuck in my head, unlike many of the all-time worst. As mediocre as this is, I can see Davis’ songwriting talent and his appeal as an artist. I just don’t think it’s displayed here. “’65 Love Affair” has “sellout” written all over it, and the weakness of the music makes it an unpleasant listen to boot. He didn’t even sell out well.\n\nMy rating: 3/10. Pretty damn bad.\n\nGonna tell gonna tell gonna tell the truth…\n\nReleased: 1982\n\nSong history: The second single off of Toronto’s Get it On Credit, “Start Tellin’ the Truth” was written by guitarist Brian Allen.\n\nHighest chart position in Canada: #15\n\nFun fact: On the local Toronto CHUM FM charts, this song made it all the way to #4. Guess you’d expect that from a band named after the city!\n\nMy take: This is going to be a short one, as I’m very tired and this song isn’t interesting to me. “Start Tellin’ the Truth” is, in short, an adequate rock song with a really nice hook (+1) marred by oversinging (-1). I don’t mind listening to it, but it’s not blowing me away either.\n\nWith its intro, “Start Tellin’ the Truth” promises something a lot harder than it delivers. It’s a very hard-rock guitar intro, but as the drums and synths kick in, it becomes clear that this will be a more reflective, less balls-to-the-wall song than their previous entry (“Your Daddy Don’t Know”). The tempo is restrained, the background vocals are soft and high, and the lyrics concern matters a little more mundane. On that note, the words are nothing Shakespearean, but I do appreciate two things: 1) they deal with something other than love (in this case, compulsive lying), and 2) they pick one topic and sustain it throughout the verses. This may seem ridiculous, but after several songs whose lyrics consist of cut-and-paste love song cliches assembled with little narrative, I’m glad to see something different.\n\nContinuing with the positive theme, I think the song’s greatest strength is its background vocals, both in the verses and in the chorus. Well, that and the hook, which is sung by the background vocalists anyway. I could listen to “start tellin’ the, start tellin’ the truth” all day. It’s just so nice. They also carry through on the song’s great guitar solo, a detail I didn’t notice until I watched the video. A very subtle and seamless touch.\n\nNow as for the oversinging…it’s not so much of an issue at the beginning of the song, but more towards the end, with all the choruses stacked together. This leaves Holly Woods improvising, slathering her (admittedly powerful) voice all over the track in an effort to keep interest. She’s got one of those very Canadian overwrought dramatic voices–I’m not sure how to describe it, but you know it when you hear it. Carole Pope (of Rough Trade) has it; so do Ivan Doroschuk (Men Without Hats) and Gordon Deppe (Spoons). I’m also not sure why so many Canadians choose to sing like this. At any rate, she can rein it in like she does on the first half, but when she starts laying it on thick, it mars the end of the song. Doesn’t completely ruin it, but it does taint it a little.\n\nMy rating: 6/10. More good than bad, but I wouldn’t ever consider this a fave, and I likely won’t listen to it again after this review.\n\nYou did it you did it you did it you did it you did it in a minute!\n\nReleased: March 1982\n\nSong history: This was another song where Sara Allen, Daryl Hall’s girlfriend at the time, played a big role–in this case, with the chorus. Well, actually, it was Allen’s sister Janna who started it all. According to Hall’s interview with Songfacts, “I was in the car with Janna, and she said, ‘I got this idea for a chorus,“ and she sang that chorus. That’s how it all started. And I said, \"That’s great.’ We got out of the car, I went to a keyboard, and I put the chords to it. I worked on a verse, and then Sara and I sat and wrote the lyrics together for the verse. So it was sort of a three-way collaboration on that song.” It was released as the third of four singles from their album Private Eyes, and the first of the four not to hit #1–though don’t let that fool you into thinking it did badly or anything. It still made the top 10.\n\nHighest chart position in Canada: #10\n\nFun fact: The cover of this single is way cooler than the single itself. Yes, even with Hall’s white socks.\n\nMy take: In the great Hall and Oates oeuvre, “Did It In a Minute” stands as a decidedly lesser entry. It ain’t no “You Make My Dreams,” that’s for sure. The best way I can think of describing it is that it sounds like an ad jingle. I dunno, I hear this and all I can think is “the best part of waking up is Folgers in your cup!” or “Mentos fresh and full of life!” It’s that scrubbed-clean, saccharine, overly ecstatic sound, and I don’t like it.\n\nAfter watching a few live performances, I think the problem lies mostly in the production. The song itself is fine, but the way it’s mixed just brings out the cheese. It all starts with the intro. There’s a couple of versions of this song, one of which kicks off the track with a wailing guitar note, but even that doesn’t manage to make the song edgier; the blast of synths and simplistic piano chords works to sand off all of the edges. These chords are sustained throughout the verses, keeping the cheesiness intact, and even the harmonies add to it with how smoothly they’re laid over top. This, in turn, takes the exceedingly catchy chorus and verses (really, the whole song is catchy as hell) and turns that strength into a weakness. And hey, normally, I like catchiness. The strong emphasis on melody is exactly why I enjoy pop music. But because of the uber-clean production and instrumentation, “Did It In a Minute” feels too catchy somehow, like it’s trying to hammer you over the head with its hooks. Maybe they should’ve taken some cues from “I Can’t Go for That” and employed a bit of restraint. Like I said, the live versions are perfectly fine, so it’s the production that must be the issue.\n\nHall’s singing doesn’t help. He follows the melody closely, never deviating, never improvising, never allowing his voice to go scratchy or off-key. A bit of dimension in his performance, as well as in the uber-smooth background vocals, would’ve made a big difference.\n\nThere is one exception to all this, and it’s in the pre-chorus. This is where the great Hall and Oates songwriting comes into play, and thankfully the production doesn’t muck things up too terribly. It’s got this really cool round-robin cascade of lines, some of which are sung up the octave and some down. Lyrically, it’s also the most coherent part of the song, and I like how it’s different from one pre-chorus to the next. But in general, this is not a song you want to be listening to for lyrics. Like most songs I’ve covered, “Did It In a Minute” consists of a series of slapped-together love song cliches, all tied together with a simile, metaphor, or line that hasn’t been used yet. Guys, eventually these will all be used. Why not write about something that isn’t love?\n\nBut that’s another rant for another day. Overall, “Did It In a Minute” is a song that could’ve been decent if they had rawed it up a little. I say “decent” because I can’t imagine this being a fave of mine even at its core–the melody isn’t enjoyable enough. I haven’t liked getting this song stuck in my head, which is never a good sign. A lesser entry in the Hall and Oates oeuvre, for sure. That’s OK, though. There’s still plenty of songs of theirs I do like.\n\nMy rating: 5/10. Meh. They can do better.\n\nGonna swallow my tears…\n\nReleased: September 1981\n\nSong history: The song was originally written and released by Quarterflash’s predecessor group, Seafood Mama, in 1980, where it did well on local Portland stations but failed to capture the attention of other audiences. A re-arranged version was released as Quarterflash’s first single in late 1981; this one was massively successful, climbing all the way up to #3 in the States as well as peaking fairly high on the Canadian charts.\n\nHighest chart position in Canada: #10\n\nFun fact: After this song hit the charts in 1982, Elton John enlisted Quarterflash as an opening act–something he rarely had.\n\nMy take: As with our last entry (“Pac-Man Fever”), all the good stuff in today’s song is packed into one element: lead vocalist and saxophonist Rindy Ross. Now, “Harden My Heart” is a better song in general, with a nicer melody, smarter instrumentation, sharper songwriting, and more to it besides novelty. But all of the song’s “ofness” is derived from her contributions alone. She’s what gives the song its strength and character, and let’s face it: this would be a fairly bland tune otherwise.\n\nI mean, really, it still is. But let’s make a pitstop into Positivity Lane before driving straight down Critical Road. (It’s an issue for me, man. Writing this blog has made me a lot meaner about the music I listen to.) “Harden My Heart” opens with one of the most memorable sax riffs in ‘80s rock, and what’s even more remarkable is that it was played by a woman, who was also the lead singer. In concert videos, you can actually see her play the riff, then hang the sax on her shoulder and sing. That’s pretty cool, and we haven’t seen a combination female-sax-lead-singer ever since. But many reviews simply get stuck on the “wow it’s a woman!” thing and fail to mention how good the riff is. Saxophones can can be great, but they need to be done right or they get real annoying real fast. “Harden My Heart” does its sax very well, making it seem like a natural musical element rather than a gimmick. It’s a very singable, hummable riff. And that’s intentional–Rindy Ross herself said that she viewed the saxophone as an extension of her voice, expressing what her singing couldn’t.\n\nSpeaking of which, the song’s other great element is Rindy’s voice. It’s got a lot of dimension, going from chest to head, pure to gritty, and high to low depending on what the lyrics require. And what’s better is that she emotes–something that can’t be said of many vocalists I cover. She sounds like she’s lived the experience that she’s singing about, which counts for a lot. A good, emotive performance can often elevate pedestrian lyrics, and that’s the case for “Harden My Heart”. On paper, none of these lyrics are anything beyond your typical pop-song pap, but they sound honest when delivered. The harmonies are quite nice, too.\n\nNow let’s get back onto Critical Road. With its restrained rock rhythm and its melody, which insinuates rather than grabs, “Harden My Heart” is not a very showy track. And I think that’s my main objection. It’s competent, not great. I like “Harden My Heart”, for the most part. It’s a very well-put-together song, with all of its elements forming a solid, seamless whole, and I’d go as far as to say that it’s a good song. But that’s all it is. Maybe that’s due to the weakness of individual elements (the lyrics, some of the instruments, the guitar solo), or it could be my general ambivalence about love songs, but whatever the reason, it doesn’t hit me the right way. It leaves no impression other than “well that was a pleasant way to fill three-and-a-half minutes.” When I stop and pay attention to it, I can appreciate the thought that’s been put into it, as well as the sheer subtlety of the song (and yes, it’s incredible that a song with such prominent sax can be called “subtle”, so points for that too). But it doesn’t grab me, or make me feel the happiness that a fave would. It is like many tunes this year, a well-written but flavourless love song that could be better if it did something different for once.\n\nMy rating: 7/10. A good song, not a great one."
