        "text": "As part of the promotional tour for Deadpool & Wolverine, director Shawn Levy is answering questions from time to time regarding his upcoming Star Wars movie. A few weeks ago, he confirmed that Jonathan Tropper is penning the script for the film. Now, in a sit down with Josh Horowitz on the Happy, Sad, Confused podcast, Levy was asked again about it.\n\nRight out of the gate, Horowitz asked if Levy is writing the movie with any actors in mind. The filmmaker was surprised at first by the question, and then replied:\n\n“Wow! You’re asking the right questions. Sort of, yes. Please don’t ask a follow-up! (Laughs.)”\n\nThe question, and in particular the response, is quite relevant. A few months ago, reporter Jeff Sneider mentioned in his newsletter that it was his understanding that Shawn Levy’s Star Wars film was set to feature the character of Rey Skywalker in some capacity. While Daisy Ridley hasn’t been officially attached to it, and no one else has followed up on that tip, Levy’s response might add fuel to that fire.\n\nAnd yet, his next words may feel contradictory to the notion of focusing on an already known character. The director then emphasized that he wants to focus on new stories set in the galaxy far, far away. When asked what Star Wars means to him, he said:\n\n“The experience of crafting this story has forced me to think about that question. There’s only so many times that Star Wars movies can revisit the same section of the timeline. Because I don’t wanna do a Star Wars movie that is redundant to others, nor am I interested in doing one that has to serve another movie.\n\nI really wanted to craft something that felt organic to me in tone and characters. There’s certainly the Force, and a connection to something bigger than our individual selves, and the way that that can make us powerful. Those themes, combined with visual delight and wish fulfillment – that’s Star Wars to me.”\n\nLittle else is known about Levy’s film for now, including a release date or a production schedule. But writing is seemingly underway, and it looks like this could be Levy’s next feature film. Elsewhere, The Mandalorian & Grogu is set to start production imminently.\n\nCheck out the full video below:"
