Because the needs, responsibilities, hopes, and expectations associated with each type of relationship vary, the personal meanings and social implications of each type of death also differ. Thus, it is assumed that the death of a spouse, for example, is experienced differently from the death of a child. 75\n\nThis chapter summarizes and discusses current knowledge about the various psychosocial responses to particular types of bereavement. The focus is on loss of immediate kinâ€”spouse, child, parent, and sibling. There is also discussion of the response to suicide, often regarded as one of the most difficult types of loss to sustain. Other types of particularly difficult losses, such as multiple simultaneous deaths resulting from accidents or natural disasters and deaths caused by war and terrorism, are not discussed.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nAlthough only a small number of different types of losses have been discussed in this chapter, they indicate that different kinds of relationships and different sets of circumstances influence the personal mean ings and feelings associated with bereavement. More data are needed on the response to loss of various types of relationships, and under various conditions of death. Much attention has been paid to responses to conjugal bereavement in adults, but there is relatively little information on other types of losses, such as the death of siblings and parents. As the average age at death continues to rise and as medical technology allows the prolongation of lives that previously would have ended naturally, an increasing number of people will have to deal with issues raised by elderly and ailing parents, including the thorny issues surrounding assisted suicide. Responses to loss under all these circumstances deserve exploration in order to provide appropriate assistance to the bereaved."
