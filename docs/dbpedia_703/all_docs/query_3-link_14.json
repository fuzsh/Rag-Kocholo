        "text": "With the Olympics still in full swing, it’s the perfect time to highlight 1988’s “One Moment in Time” by Whitney Houston!\n\nThe song was written by Albert Hammond (the man behind “It Never Rains in Southern California”) and John Bettis for the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea, and released as a single from the Olympic soundtrack compilation album of the same name–produced in conjunction with NBC Sports.\n\nThe single was the studio version of the song that Whitney sang live during the opening ceremonies.\n\n(Note: Other artists featured on the album included The Four Tops, The Bee Gees, Eric Carmen, Taylor Dayne and composer/conductor John Williams.)\n\n“One Moment in Time” was an anthem for believing in yourself against all odds, and struck a chord not only in America, but around the world.\n\nThe proof: It charted in 20 countries, all but 3 in the top 10! In the US alone, it topped Billboard’s Adult Contemporary Chart, and reached #5 on the Hot 100!\n\n“One Moment in Time” by Whitney Houston gets the Gold Medal for being: an inspirational Song of Olympic proportions…and a Great Song of 1988!\n\nGuitarist Paul Dean of the Canadian group Loverboy went to a nearby beach on a sunny Wednesday afternoon…hoping to find something that might inspire him to write a song.\n\nWhat he found was a distinct lack of people. In fact, the beach was nearly deserted.\n\nIt occurred to him that everybody must be “waiting for the weekend.”\n\nThen it occurred to him that “Waiting for the Weekend” was a great song title. But not so fast…\n\nWhen he took it back to the group, vocalist Mike Reno thought a better title would be “Working for the Weekend.” And so…a Great Song of 1982 was born!\n\nAt the time, Loverboy had only released one album, and they were struggling, playing to small crowds in small bars across Canada and the US…but once they added the finished song to their playlist, they started packing the dance floors. and they knew they were onto something.\n\nIn late 1981,”Working for the Weekend” became the lead single from their second album, “Get Lucky,” and–as luck would have it–by early ‘1982, they’d hit the jackpot!\n\nIn Canada, the song reached #10 on the Top 40, while here in the States, it climbed to #2 on Billboard’s Rock Chart–while continuing to pack dance floors across North America.\n\nThen, At the end of the decade, VH-1 listed “Working for the Weekend” at #100 on their list of the 100 Greatest Songs of the ’80s!\n\nSo ironically, an empty beach inspired A Great Party Song of 1982!\n\n1984’s“What About Me” is a Country Crossover that features an All-Star cast of singers and songwriters, and notable for the list of stars who DIDN’T make the lineup!\n\nGet your scorecards ready, because here we go!\n\n“What About Me” was written by Kenny Rogers, Richard Marx, and David Foster (known for his work with Chicago and scores of other artists, including his current wife, Katharine McPhee).\n\nIt was written as trio, and designed for Kenny, Lionel Ritchie, and Barbra Streisand, but then Lionel backed out, which led Barbra to back out as well.\n\nSo then it was offered to Olivia Newton-John and Jeffrey Osborne…but Olivia was working on a duet with Barry Gibb, and although she wanted to do it, the timing was wrong. Then Jeffrey had a scheduling conflict, so it was on to round 3.\n\nThe third time was the charm, as Kim Carnes and James Ingram stepped in to help Kenny complete”What About Me” as the lead single from his album” of the same name. Whew!\n\nThe song was a about a romantic triangle, with each singer trying to work out what they felt for whom, and it immediately became a hit, topping the Adult Contemporary Charts in both the US & Canada. (How could it lose with all that star power?)\n\nSide Note: It was the first #1 song as a songwriter for Richard Marx.)\n\n“What About Me” by Kenny Rogers, Kim Carnes, and James Ingram: an All-Star lineup with a Great Country Crossover…on from 1984!\n\nThe ’70s were quite the decade for John Denver: hit after hit, millions of albums and singles sold, TV specials and guest appearances, movies, extended tours, etc…etc…\n\nThe man was extremely busy for 10 straight years, so it was only natural that when the ’80s came around, he lightened his schedule and turned his attention to several special projects and humanitarian pursuits, many involving natural resource and environmental conservation.\n\nJohn still toured a bit and released a few albums and singles here and there, but his main focus was elsewhere.\n\nThat said, his last big hit was released in 1982: the simple, yet beautiful “Shanghai Breezes.”\n\nJohn was visiting Shanghai and was starting to feel homesick, when he realized that the sun, moon, stars, and even the breezes were the same no matter where he was at the time.\n\nThat simple thought gave birth to a song that went to #1 on the Adult Contemporary Charts in both the US and Canada.\n\nIt was John’s last #1 song…and also the last to appear in the Top 40 (at #31).\n\nNOTE: In case you’ve ever wondered, the flute solos were performed by Jim Horn, a member of the legendary group of studio musicians called “The Wrecking Crew.” During his long career, Jim has played woodwinds for everyone from The Beatles and Beach Boys…to The Rolling Stones, The Carpenters., and Tom Petty–just to name a small handful.\n\n“Shanghai Breezes” by John Denver: one last Great Song from a legendary performer.\n\nFor the stories behind more than 1,700 Great Songs of the ’70s and ’80s, visti my Facbeook page at https://www.facebook.com/MichaelCuuuk/\n\nIf you’ve been following this blog for any given length of time, you’ve probably noticed that I often include Canadian chart statistics. There are 2 reasons for this:\n\n#1: It’s no secret that many Canadian groups and artists have crossed over the border to influence American musical tastes…and vice versa.\n\n#2: I grew up near the Canadian border, and it certainly influenced MY musical tastes! 🙂\n\nOn any given song, the chart numbers between countries could virtually be identical, or wildly different. And Then there are songs that don’t cross the border at all–and that can ALSO go both ways!\n\nI bring this up because this week’s featured Great Song of the ’80s , is a rarity: a Great Canadian Song that took 6 YEARS to cross the border and become a Great Song here in the US!\n\nIn 1983, Arnold Lanni, keyboardist for the Canadian group Sherriff, fell in love with Valeri Brown and wrote her a song for Valentine’s Day. They married 2 years later, but before that happened, Sheriff recorded and released “When I’m With You.”\n\nThe song went to #8 on Canada’s Top 40, but stalled at #61 in the US.\n\nNow You’d think that would be the end of it…and it almost WAS, especially after Sheriff turned in their badges and broke up in 1985.\n\nBut then, in November of 1988, KDWB in Minneapolis and WKTI in Milwaukee started playing the song…and by early 1989, other stations in the Midwest…and then the rest of the country… had started playing it as well, which led Capitol Records to re-issue the single.\n\nThis time, “When I’m With You” went to #1 on Billboard’s Hot 100 and Adult Contemporary Charts in the US …but failed to chart at all in Canada!\n\nMany people thought Sheriff should reunite and go out on tour to back the song, but the ex-band members refused, and that was that.\n\nSo in the end, Sheriff became a one-hit wonder TWICE…with”When I’m with You:” a Great Song of 1983 up North…and 1989 here in the States.\n\nFor the stories behind more than 1,700 Great Songs of the ’70s and ’80s, visit my Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/MichaelCuuuk/\n\nn the mid-80s, a lack of good material mixed with a serious drug problem put Eddie Money’s career on the skids. His record label, Columbia, was about ready to drop him, but, because he was cleaning himself up, they decided to give him one last chance–but only if he allowed them to choose his material. Eddie really had no choice but to agree.\n\nOne of the songs Columbia wanted him to record, was “Take Me Home Tonight.” Eddie didn’t think it had much hit potential, but he was intrigued by the part of the song that sampled “Be Me Baby,” the 1963 classic by the Ronettes–sung by Ronnie Spector (who, back in the day, was married to production genius–and future convicted murderer–Phil Spector).\n\nEddie thought it would be a good idea to have Ronnie record the part herself, but when he was told by Columbia that she wasn’t available…he asked his friend Martha Davis of the The Motels to sing it.\n\nMartha declined and told Eddie he should call Ronnie himself and not take “No” for an answer.\n\nSo Eddie called Ronnie and caught her in the middle of washing dishes. Ronnie told him she’d retired because she was tired of all the drama stardom had brought her way. Basically, she was happy to be living a quiet life out of the spotlight.\n\nBut Eddie had a comeback ready: “But Ronnie, the whole song is a tribute to you!”\n\nThat did the trick!\n\nThe song was recorded and released as a single from Eddie’s “last chance” album, “Can’t Hold Back.” And people LOVED IT!\n\n“Take Me Home Tonight” topped Billboard’s Mainstream Rock Chart, and reached #4 on the Hot 100! It later garnered a Grammy nomination for “Best male Rock Performance.” (Perhaps it should have been for “Best Duo,” but that’s just my personal opinion.)\n\nEddie Money was back…and so was Ronnie Spector, who then came out of retirement and resumed her singing career.\n\n“Take me Home Tonight:” A double comeback for Eddie and Ronnie, and a Great Song of 1986!\n\nSinger/Songwriter Paul Davis set out to write a song that would sound like something Hall & Oates might record, while at the same time, have sort of a nostalgic feel to it.\n\nHe called it: “55 Love Affair,” which, in itself, is a pretty good title, but the suits at Paul’s record company (Bang Records), had a question.\n\nThey asked Paul how old he was in 1955. The Answer…was 7.\n\nAt that point, they suggested he change the title to “65 Love Affair” since more people would believe a 17-year-old in love.\n\nExcellent point, so Paul adjusted the title and lyrics accordingly.\n\nAnd When the song was released as a single (from the album “Cool Night,” Paul did indeed sound a bit like Hall & Oates…and it was more believable, age-wise. SO believable, it spent FIVE MONTHS on Billboard’s Hot 100, peaking at #6. It also reached #5 on The Adult Contemporary Chart.\n\nThe moral of the story? Sometimes when you listen to the suits, you hit the charts with a BANG! Pun intended. “65 Love Affair” by Paul Davis: a Great Song of 1982!\n\nIn 1983, the British reggae band UB40 was putting together “Labour of Love,”an album of cover versions of songs they liked, and they decided to record a version of a rather obscure song by Jamaican-born singer Tony Tribe that only made it to #46 on the UK charts back in 1969.\n\nOr so they thought.\n\nBecause the name of the composer listed on the sheet music was N. Diamond, they naturally assumed it was Jamaican singer Negus Diamond.\n\nBut…in reality, it was NEIL Diamond, whose origina1967 version of “Red Red Wine” was not even CLOSE to being a reggae song–and not really a hit either.\n\nNeil’s original label was Bang Records, and when he left after releasing 2 albums, Bang started tinkering with his music’. They added a choir to the song…without Neil’s knowledge or permission., and the single never made it above #62 on the Hot 100.\n\nCut to the ’80s:\n\nUB40’s single version was released in 1983 in the UK, and went to #1, but stalled at #34 in the US when it was released in 1984. But hold on…\n\nIn 1988, it was re-issued in the US–and this time it was the full album version, including the rap break that had been edited out of the original single.\n\nTTHIS version quickly topped Billboard’s Hot 100!\n\nEverybody was a winner–including Neil Diamond–who received residuals, of course…but also loved UB40’s version so much, he started performing in it concert using THEIR reggae arrangement instead of his non-reggae original!\n\nWhen you put the story all together, it’s pretty obvious that “Red Red Wine” was destined to be a Great Song all along…NO thanks to Bang Records in 1967, but with a positive nod to Tony Tribe in 1969, and the combined talents of Neil Diamond and UB40 from 1983-to 1988!\n\nUB40:\n\nNeil Diamond:\n\nEarly in his career, Richard Marx had written a song so personal, he had no intention of recording it for release.\n\n“Right Here Waiting” was a love letter to his wife-to-be, actress Cynthia Rhodes, who was in South Africa shooting a film. He wanted to visit her, but his visa application was rejected. So he recorded a personal copy and sent it to her by mail. (This, of course, was during the ’80s, when there was no such thing as email or Skype.)\n\nAnd That was that…until it wasn’t.\n\nOne day, Barbra Streisand asked Richard to “write her a hit.”\n\nAfter some serious internal debate, he sent her “Right Here Waiting.” The next day, she called Richard and told him she loved the music and the melody…BUT if she were going to record it, he’d have to rewrite the lyrics because, and I quote: “I will NOT be right here, waiting for ANYBODY!”\n\nNow that may SEEM like a classic example of “Barbra the Diva” talking, but Richard has always felt that it was actually a kick in the pants to record and release the song himself.\n\nSo he did…and “Right Here Waiting” became a monster hit!\n\nWhen it was released from the album, “Repeat Offender,” it reached the Top 10 in 11 countries, including #1 in the US on both the Hot 100 and Adult Contemporary Charts.” It also went to #1 in Australia, New Zealand, and Ireland.\n\nNote: Richard and Cynthia were married from 1989 to 2014.\n\nRight Here Waiting” by Richard Marx, with special thanks to Barbra Streisand: A Great Song of 1989!\n\nFor the stories behind more than 1,600 Great Songs of the ’70s and ’80s, visit my Facebook Page at https://www.facebook.com/MichaelCuuuk/\n\nVince Gill: You may know him as a country music superstar and a member of the Grand Ol’ Opry. You may know him as a current touring member of The Eagles. Or you may know him as Mr. Amy Grant. 🙂\n\nBut in 1980, before all of the above, he was the lead singer for Pure Prairie League.\n\nHe wasn’t with them very long…but long enough be the vocalist of their biggest hit (and Great Song): “Let Me Love You Tonight.”\n\nWhile the radio airwaves at the turn of the decade were primarily a mix of new wave, disco, power ballads and hard rock, there was still room on the charts for country/rock, and “Let Me Love You Tonight” was a perfect example.\n\nLed by Vince’s pure tenor, the song topped Billboard’s Adult Contemporary Chart, and reached #10 on the Hot 100.\n\nNote: The saxophone riffs were played by the legendary David Sanborn, who passed away recently at the age of 78.\n\n“Let Me Love You Tonight” by Pure Prairie League–featuring Vince Gill and David Sanborn: a Great Song of 1980!\n\nFor the stories behind more than 1,600 Great Songs of the ’70s and ’80s, visit my Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/MichaelCuuuk"
