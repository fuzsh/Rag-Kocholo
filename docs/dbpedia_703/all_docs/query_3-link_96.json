        "text": "PARIS: The International Olympic Committee (IOC) is facing renewed pressure to give Australian sprinting legend Raelene Boyle the two gold medals of which she was robbed amid the East German doping saga that rocked world sport.\n\nDavid Howman, the chair of the Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU) and a former director-general of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), has called for the IOC to give Boyle the gold medals she deserves and to apologise to the champion sprinter.\n\nBoyle won silver medals in the women's 100m and 200m at the Munich 1972 Olympics.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nREAD MORE: Pole vault freak caps gold with world record jump\n\nREAD MORE: IBA slams IOC as boxing gender furore heats up\n\nREAD MORE: Jess Fox in tears as little sister wins first gold\n\nThe gold medallist in both of those events was Renate Stecher of East Germany. After two decades of rife suspicion surrounding the cleanliness of Stecher, files were released that confirmed she had been taking a steroid called Oral Turinabol over the two years leading up to the 1972 Games.\n\nAt the Stade de France on Wednesday morning (AEST), 52 years after Boyle was beaten to gold by Stecher, the women's Paris Games 200m final will take place.\n\n\"The pressure that has been imposed on the IOC is appropriate and I would have thought from my perspective ... that these are the sorts of things you can do to right wrongs [handing out medals decades later],\" Howman told Wide World of Sports.\n\n\"There are hurdles to surmount in doing that, but at the end of the day, you've got to sit back and say, 'Well, what's the fair and right thing to do in situations like that when you are fully aware of what went wrong?', and the answer for me is pretty simple.\n\n\"Give her the medal that she should have got and rock up and say, 'We're sorry'.\"\n\nStecher was among an estimated 10,000 East German athletes from various sports who doped across the 1960s, '70 and '80s.\n\nDoping had already been rife for several years when the German Democratic Republic (GDR) secretly passed a bill in 1974, mandating systemic use of performance-enhancing drugs.\n\nThe IOC has refused for decades to hand out medals to those who were cheated, or strip medals from those who doped, due to an eight-year statute of limitations that prevents such action after the passing of so much time.\n\nBut Howman won't cop it.\n\n\"It is a reason [the IOC's statute of limitations], but I think those reasons can be surmounted in the name of the right thing to do,\" said the AIU boss.\n\n\"I would put more emphasis on that than I would on being restrained by lawyers or legal action.\n\n\"I think you have to look at things in this hard light of day and say, 'Well, now we know this, this and this, and therefore we think this is an opportunity to remedy a wrong'.\n\n\"I wouldn't worry about stripping them [the medals]; I would worry about acknowledging and rewarding, rather than the other side of it.\"\n\nBoyle has spoken out on many occasions about the injustice of the East German doping era.\n\n\"You go to the museum in Berlin and you can pull out drawers and see what those women were taking to make them run so fast,\" Boyle said in 2019.\n\nHowman admitted Boyle, 73, faced a \"really sad situation\".\n\n\"She knows in her heart that she would have beaten people who were cheating,\" he said, \"but that's no comfort when you haven't been recognised by the world.\""
