        "text": "Back in 1967, coincidentally the \"summer of love,\" social psychologist and professor Arthur Aron met his future wife, a fellow researcher. Together, they developed 36 questions meant to spark connection and intimacy between two people, which they published in 1997. Though it's clear that there's no single question that can guarantee love and connection, the notion is that active listening and mutual vulnerability—the willingness to really open yourself up to and receive someone else—can build empathy, trust, and warmth. Probing questions also tend to reveal someone's values, qualities, fears, and personal past, so even if they don't lead to love or you're already in love, they also help you learn a lot about your partner, friends, and self.\n\nUsing Aron's list as inspiration, we came up with 65 questions of our own to ask your partner, friends, or even yourself when you want to dig a little deeper. Whether you find yourself sitting on a long car drive with a loved one, or you simply want to get to know someone on a deeper level, these 65 questions will definitely beget some interesting conversations (or journal entries if you want to treat them as introspective prompts).\n\n65 Questions to Ask Your Partner to Dig Deeper in Your Relationship\n\nWhat is your most irrational fear?
