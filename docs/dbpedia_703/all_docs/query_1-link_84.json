        "text": "It Ends with Us box office opening prediction\n\nWayfarer Studios and Sony's movie adaptation of author Colleen Hoover’s novel It Ends With Us, starring Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni and directed by the latter, will be released on August 9. Blake is also a producer on It Ends with Us. Per Deadline, It Ends With Us presales are through the roof, with NRG’s conservative $23 million opening estimates for the $25 million production. Moreover, presales indicate a $30 million opening for It Ends With Us, fuelled by the author’s fandom.\n\nMeanwhile, Deadpool & Wolverine, which was released on July 26, is expected to lead its third weekend with a $50 million collection. The MCU film, directed, produced and co-written by Shawn Levy, became the second movie this year in the US and Canada to pass $400 million, after Inside Out 2. The fastest movie to hit $400 million remains Marvel Studios’ Avengers: Endgame, which reached the milestone in five days in 2019.\n\nAbout It Ends with Us\n\nThe film does deals with the topic of domestic abuse, and follows Lily Bloom (Blake Lively), who overcomes a traumatic childhood to start a new life and chase a lifelong dream of opening her own business. A chance meeting with a neurosurgeon named Ryle Kincaid (Justin Baldoni) sparks an intense romance before Lily begins to see sides of Ryle that remind her of her parents’ relationship."
