        "text": "Stories You May Like\n\nTo mark Valentine’s Day, we share a host of ‘happily ever after’ stories of alumni who found their soulmate in a fellow Cornellian\n\nBy Beth Saulnier & Alexandra Bond ’12\n\n(But, as he told himself: “You’re not Wesley Snipes.”)\n\nLater that day, they hung out at Collegetown Bagels with some classmates, and the group migrated to a basement music spot.\n\n“We entered the club, danced,” he recalls. “We’ve been dancing ever since.” Sixteen years after they met, they exchanged wedding vows at Willard Straight’s Ivy Terrace—becoming two of the innumerable Big Red grads over the decades who have met their mates on the Hill.\n\nIn honor of Valentine’s Day, Cornellians asked alumni couples to share their love stories. The response was overwhelming—more than space allows us to include—with romantic tales spanning generations.\n\nSome of the pairs met during their very first days on the Hill, while others connected years or even decades after graduation. Here’s a sampling:\n\n(Stories have been edited and condensed.)\n\nBarbara Cole Feiden ’48 & Barry Feiden ’49\n\nIt eventually led to 67 years of a happy marriage and three wonderful children. Barry died five years ago, but I cherish his memory and the memories of Cornell.”\n\nTom Rakowski ’72 & Carol Carnes Rakowski ’75\n\nCarlos Maymi ’90 & Steven Rapkin, MS ’90\n\nAfter a year of weekend visits, we eventually moved into our own apartment in Hoboken, NJ, where we still reside after 26 years. When work permits, we enjoy travel—from distant locales like Botswana and Komodo Island to cultural centers like Paris and Madrid to camping in U.S. national parks. A particular focus has been travel to wine-producing regions, which we experienced as students visiting the wineries of Cayuga Lake.”\n\nKenneth Kupchak ’64, JD ’71 & Patty Geer Kupchak ’67\n\nArthur Kirk Field ’60, MS ’61 & Marcia Case Field ’61\n\nRaymond Ortiz ’04, MPA ’06 & Danya Contreras ’13\n\nAfter taking some time to get to know each other, our love story truly began; we have enjoyed traveling, completing advanced degrees, and welcoming new family members (nieces, nephews, and pets).\"\n\nBetty Schultz Goldberg ’61 & Josh Goldberg ’63, MS ’65\n\nI told him he ate like a steam shovel. He said, ‘Thank you.’ I was appalled and refused to sit at the same table with him. Skip ahead to the present. Josh and I have been married for nearly 60 years. Did his table manners improve? Hell, yes.”\n\nKathleen Miller ’82 & Brian Pickerall ’82\n\nWhen we got to the corner of Thurston and Wait, she headed for the Alpha Phi house while the rest of the group headed for Dickson. Thankfully, a friend asked, ‘Who’s walking her to Alpha Phi?’ I did, and we were married four years later.”\n\nMichelle Moyal, DVM ’07 & Morgan Dickens ’08\n\nFrom Michelle: “I met my wife playing intramural basketball, and we reconnected years later on Facebook; a few years after that, I drummed up the courage to email her. Five years later, we were married at the Johnson Museum, under the lights of Cosmos by Leo Villareal. Sometimes, I marvel at our being together; on such a large campus, the odds that we would have met were so small.\"\n\nDavid Morrow III, DVM ’60, PhD ’67 & Linda Macdonough Morrow, MS ’66\n\nAdam Breitman ’08 & Allyson Davis Breitman ’08\n\nIn 2008 we ended up living in NYC, about 100 feet from each other—again by chance. Maybe fate? I formally asked her out, and she eventually said yes. Fast forward through a wedding, two Reunions, six Cornell hockey games at Madison Square Garden, and almost eight years of marriage, and we now live in Westchester with our two kids.”\n\nEric Key ’77, PhD ’83 & Cynthia Grossel Silber ’80\n\nFrom Cynthia: “He was my first love, but my father vehemently disapproved; my family was Jewish and his was not. I ended our relationship—and, as Dorothy Parker said, ‘broke my heart to clattering bits.’\n\nWe each went on to marry other people and raise families, and didn’t speak for over 30 years. In 2009, separated from my husband, I contacted people from my past. Eric was separated as well—and again, I was swept off my feet.\n\nStories You May Like\n\nIn 2018, we were married. Let no one tell you that older people don’t feel the freshness of love with the same magic and intensity as the young. If anything, it is more precious later in life.”\n\nKaren Kaufman Polansky ’67 & Steven Polansky ’67\n\nMichael Strok ’68 & Dale Chodosh Strok ’69\n\nPaul Hayre ’91 & Jeannette Perez-Rossello ’91\n\nMatthew Nagowski ’05 & Catherine March, MEng ’14\n\nJoel Negrin ’68 & Linda Schwartz Negrin ’69\n\nDavid Jackson ’04 & Tiffany Hunter Jackson ’05\n\nOur courtship was a romantic whirlwind: we were engaged in January 2021, married two months later, and had our first child in early 2022.”\n\nRob Rosenberg ’88 & Pat Cook ’89\n\nFrom Rob: “After graduation, I went to work for a boutique advertising agency in New York. I gave the Career Center my contact info to mentor seniors, and I got three; one was Pat. During winter break, I helped with their résumés and job strategies. When the agency was hiring an entry-level person, I gave HR Pat’s résumé, which I considered the strongest, and they hired her. We became friends and ultimately fell in love. We’ll celebrate our 30th anniversary in June. We also produced two Cornellians: son Reed ’20 and daughter Grayson ’23.”\n\nRebecca Gendelman ’14 & Jesse Orshan ’15, BS ’14\n\nJeffrey McPeek ’82, BS ’83 & Julie Doig McPeek ’83\n\nGregory Meyer ’06, MILR ’08 & Marijke Schouten ’10\n\nSince graduating, we've traveled to 15 countries, married with all our favorite Cornellians present, and adopted a rescue bulldog who sports a Big Red jersey on game days. We're a ‘legacy love story,’ because my husband's parents were married their sophomore year!”\n\nRisa Mish ’85, JD ’88 & John Lauricella, MFA ’87, PhD ’93\n\nDennis Norfleet ’65 & Doren Poland Norfleet ’65\n\nDavid Mazaika ’85 & Kristina Salerno Mazaika ’92\n\nTop image: Illustration by Cornell University, from a photo by iStock.
