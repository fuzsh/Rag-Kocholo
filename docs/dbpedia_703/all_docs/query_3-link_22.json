It peaked at #2 on the R&R chart, shut out by that damn \"Ebony And Ivory\".\n\nOh well, at least that's better than if it had been blocked out of #1 by \"Lean Back\" by Terror Squad\n\nPost by My Life Is A Stereo on\n\nthis song drives me to the brink of ......... well nothing anymore....I just make sure to avoid it.\n\nPost by freakyflybry2 on\n\nIt's a pretty good song... very typical for its era, but not for him!\n\nMay he R.I.P. :(\n\nPost by dth1971 on\n\nCould have been #1 on R&R!\n\nPost by tico on\n\nI remember HBO used to play this video when they did played videos back in the day. I like this, but not nearly as much as Paul's other hits \"I Go Crazy\" and \"Cool Night\". Also, may Paul rest in peace."
