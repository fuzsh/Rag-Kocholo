        "text": "Welcome back to Music Mondays, where I share a song that I like at the start of the week. This week is “’65 Love Affair” by Paul Davis. I’m sure I heard this on the radio, but I primarily became familiar with it with the “80s Flashback” CD from Target’s Pure Gold Hits line of compilation albums.\n\nIt’s a song about lost love, but the tune is so happy you’d never know unless you paid attention to the lyrics.\n\nI was a car hop\n\nYou were into be-bop\n\nYou sang “do wop diddy wop diddy wop doo”\n\nAll of them changes you put me through\n\nIf I could go back again\n\nWell I know I’d never let you go\n\nBack with some of my friends\n\nTo that wonderful\n\n’65 Love Affair\n\nWe wasn’t gettin’ nowhere\n\nBut we didn’t care\n\nIt was a crazy\n\n’65 Love Affair\n\nRock ‘n’ roll was simple and clear\n\nOh, I still can hear\n\nI can hear it baby\n\nYeah!\n\nWell I acted like a dumb-dumb\n\nYou were bad with your pom-poms\n\nYou said “ooh wah go team ooh wah go”\n\nOoh-ee baby I want you to know\n\nIf I could go back in time\n\nWell, I know somehow you’d still be mine\n\nI wouldn’t be so blind\n\nTo that wonderful\n\n’65 Love Affair\n\nWhen rock ‘n’ roll was simple and clear\n\nOh, I still can hear\n\nI can hear it baby\n\nWell, I tried to make you give in\n\nOne night at the drive-in\n\nYou said “oh no baby, oh no woo”\n\nAll of them changes you put me through\n\nIf I could go back in time\n\nWell, I know somehow you’d still be mine\n\nI wouldn’t be so blind\n\nTo that wonderful\n\n’65 Love Affair\n\nWe weren’t going nowhere\n\nBut we didn’t care\n\nIt was a crazy\n\n’65 Love Affair\n\nRock ‘n’ roll was simple and clear\n\nOh, I still can hear\n\nI can hear it baby\n\nWe sang\n\n“doo wop diddy wop diddy wop doo\n\ndoo wop diddy wop diddy wop doo\n\n(Oh yeah)\n\ndoo wop diddy wop diddy wop doo\n\ndoo wop diddy wop diddy wop doo\n\ndoo wop diddy wop diddy wop doo\n\ndoo wop diddy wop diddy wop doo\n\ndoo wop diddy wop diddy wop doo\n\n(Go, go, go team go!)\n\ndoo wop diddy wop diddy wop doo\n\n(Go, go, go team go!)”\n\nIf I could go back again\n\nWell I know our love would never end\n\nBack with all my friends\n\nTo that wonderful"
