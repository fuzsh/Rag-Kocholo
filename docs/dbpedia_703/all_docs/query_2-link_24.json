        "text": "The 65 Roses Story\n\nMary G. Weiss became a volunteer for the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation in 1965 after learning that her three little boys had CF. Her duty was to call every civic club, social, and service organization seeking financial support for the mission. Mary’s 4-year-old son, Richard (Ricky), listened closely to his mother as she made each call.\n\nAfter several calls, Richard came into the room and told his Mom, “I know what you are working for.” Mary was dumbstruck because Richard did not know what she was doing, nor did he know that he had cystic fibrosis.\n\nWith some trepidation, Mary asked, “What am I working for, Ricky?” He answered, “You are working for 65 Roses.” Mary was speechless.\n\nHe could not see the tears running down Mary’s cheeks as she stammered, “Yes, Ricky, I’m working for 65 Roses.”\n\nSince 1965, the term “65 Roses” has been used by children of all ages to describe their disease. But, making it easier to say does not make CF any easier to live with each day.\n\nThe horrible fact is that cystic fibrosis is a life-threatening genetic disease that affects more than 40,000 children and adults in the United States.\n\nSadly, Richard lost his fight against CF in 2014, and Mary passed away in 2016. Mary generously provided a gift in her will to the CF Foundation in memory and honor of her children. Their legacy lives on as we work to find a cure for all people with cystic fibrosis.\n\nThe “65 Roses” story has captured the hearts and emotions of all who have heard it. The rose, appropriately the ancient symbol of love, has become a symbol of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation.\n\nMore than 65 years later, we celebrate the legacy of the Weiss family and the 65 Roses story on June 5 (6/5) with 65 Roses Day.\n\nYou're invited to join the 65 Roses® Club, a dedicated group of CF Foundation donors determined to help us find a cure for CF by providing a steady, reliable stream of support that enables the Foundation to fund highly innovative research and drug development, and provide high-quality, specialized care for people with CF.\n\nHelp accelerate progress and join today!\n\n65 Roses® is a registered trademark of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation."
