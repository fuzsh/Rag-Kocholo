        "text": "Jennifer Lopez is putting it all out there in \"This Is Me…Now: A Love Story.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, the \"Can't Get Enough\" singer released the trailer for her Amazon Prime Video movie, set to debut on Feb. 16 along with her upcoming album \"This is Me…Now,\" a 20-year follow-up to her hit album \"This is Me…Then.\"\n\nAnd there is a lot happening in the trailer.\n\n\"I know what they say about me … about hopeless romantics … that we're weak. But, I'm not weak. I learned the hard way that not all stories have a happy ending,\" Lopez says at the start of the clip as scenes flash from three different marriages with husbands played by Tony Bellissimo, Derek Hough and Trevor Jackson, and a motorcycle crash involving her fourth (and real-life) husband Ben Affleck.\n\nAs one of her marriages unravel, Lopez tells Hough's character, \"Being with you feels like home, but I left home for a reason.\"\n\nHer friends stage an intervention worried that she has a sex addiction; there are dance breaks, Fat Joe as her marriage therapist and post-apocalyptic scenes as her mechanical heart appears to malfunction — all within two-and-a-half minutes.\n\nThe chaotic mix of scenes has left people on social media stunned and curious to see what unfolds in the 65-minute movie.\n\n\"'Being with you feels like home, but I left home for a reason' WHAT??? What even is this??? I mean it looks insane, but I’m so intrigued? Is it a movie? A visual album? An accompaniment? She’s a sex addict who works in a nuclear post apocalyptic factory? Idk but I’m sat,\" one social media user reacted to the trailer.\n\nCulture newsletter writer Hunter Harris commented, \"She is so funny be serious. fat joe as the therapist. she's working in the coal mines?? jennifer lopez in the multiverse of madness.\"\n\n\"I need someone to rent out a private screening. I need outfits. I need an open bar. I need this to be all we talk about for the next year,\" singer and \"Jagged Little Pill\" actor Sean Doherty added.\n\nIn a release, Lopez promises a long list of celebrity cameos including Trevor Noah, Kim Petras, Post Malone, Keke Palmer, Sofia Vergara, Jenifer Lewis, Neil deGrasse Tyson and more.\n\nLopez, 54, recorded \"This is Me ... Now\" at her Los Angeles home in 2022 and 2023. According to a release, the lyrics in the new songs will examine \"the highs and lows of life, love and relationships with unflinching honesty and introspection.\"\n\nJLo is sexy and self-deprecating as a bride in new 'Can’t Get Enough' video\n\nOn the red carpet at the Golden Globe Awards on Jan. 7, Lopez talked to Variety about the new album.\n\n“I think it might surprise some people. It’s definitely kind of a meta story about the journey that it takes from getting from heartbreak back to love … I am somewhat of an expert you could say in a real way. Not so much about marriage but on weddings,” she said. “Again, I don’t take myself too seriously. I think that life is a crazy journey where you fall down and you get back up, and you keep trying and you never give up.”\n\nThe album's first single \"Can't Get Enough\" was released on Jan. 10 with a music video featuring Hough.\n\nContributing: Melissa Ruggieri"
