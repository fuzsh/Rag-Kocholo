        "text": "As far as Potterheads go, there are those of us who have a) read each of the seven books multiple times, b) binged all eight of the movies more than we can count, or c) done all of the above.\n\nBut whether we're looking at the novels or films, both are masterfully done and based on the prose and imagination of J.K. Rowling. Still, as fans, we can't help but compare the two, because with each of the movies lasting well over two hours and Rowling's books each including more than 76,000 words, there were bound to be some elements that were lost in translation.\n\nBelow, we've outline key plot points from both, analyzing the most crucial differences between the books and movies. (And yes, Harry's eyes are #1.)\n\nHarry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\n\nDaniel Radcliffe—who has blue eyes—was allergic to colored contacts, so in the films, The Boy Who Lived's eyes were not green like they are in the novels.\n\nRowling described Hermione as having extremely bushy hair and large front teeth, but as we can see, Emma Watson did not.\n\nIn contrast to Rupert Grint's appearance, Rowling describes Ron as tall and lanky, with a long nose and blue eyes. (Grint has green).\n\nAunt Petunia and Dudley are blonde, but in the films, they're brunette.\n\nThe movies never mention Hagrid's motorbike was once Sirius Black's.\n\nIn the film, the snake Harry speaks Parseltongue to at the zoo is a Burmese Python—but in the book, it's a Boa Constrictor.\n\nIn the novel, Harry met Draco Malfoy and rejected his friendship in Diagon Alley, but in the film, this happens at Hogwarts before the Sorting Hat ceremony.\n\nThe Sorting Hat sings a song before every ceremony—but not in the movie.\n\nIn the book, Voldemort kills Quirrell by leaving his head, but in the film, Harry kills Quirrell by touching his face.\n\nHarry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\n\nIn the book, Mr. Weasley fixes Harry's glasses in Diagon Alley instead of Hermione.\n\nBig screenn Hermione is aware of the term \"Mudblood,\" while the book character needs to be taught its meaning by Ron.\n\nThe movie never clarifies that Mr. Filch is a squib and has no magic.\n\nIn the film, the heir of Slytherin message is written in blood, while in the book, it's paint.\n\nHarry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\n\nHarry pretends to be Neville Longbottom while on the Knight Bus in the novel.\n\nThere is no Hogwarts choir in the book, but you see them perform in the third film.\n\nIn the book, Sir Cadogan's portrait replaces the Fat Lady's after she's attacked by Sirius Black.\n\nOn the big screen, it's never shown that Harry wins Hogwarts' Quidditch Cup.\n\nThe film doesn't explain the origin story of The Marauders—James Potter (Prongs), Sirius (Padfoot), Remus Lupin (Moony), and Peter Pettigrew (Wormtail)—or their Marauder's Map and Lupin's connection to the Shrieking Shack.\n\nHarry was joined by Ron and Hermione in the novel when he eavesdropped on Fudge's Leaky Cauldron conversation.\n\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\n\nPercy Weasley's job at the ministry and the betrayal of his family isn't in the film.\n\nDumbledore calmly confronted Harry about putting his name in the Goblet of Fire in the book, whereas in the movie, he was rather angry...and intense.\n\nHead of the Department of Magical Games and Sports, Ludo Bagman was omitted from the film, as his character was combined with Barty Crouch's.\n\nIn the books, journalist Rita Skeeter can turn into a beetle and is an unregistered animagus.\n\nHermione's SPEW (The Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare) wasn't mentioned in the film.\n\nNeville gave Harry the gillyweed for the second Triwizard Tournament task, but it was actually Dobby in the book.\n\nVoldemort has red eyes in the books, not white.\n\nAfter Harry won the Triwizard Tournament, he gave his 1000 galleon winnings to Fred and George so they could start Weasleys Wizard Wheezes—which isn't in the film.\n\nHarry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\n\nQuidditch is not featured at all in the fifth film, including Ron being named keeper and Professor Umbridge banning Harry, Fred, and George from Quidditch. Ginny then replaced Harry as seeker.\n\nHagrid told Harry about Thestrals in the book, while Luna Lovegood did in the movie.\n\nThe film doesn't show the full extent of Snape's worst memory, which involved Lily Potter and the Marauders.\n\nWhile Cho Chang spills the beans about Dumbledore's Army in the film, it's actually Marietta Edgecombe in the book.\n\nHarry goes on a date with Cho Chang in the novel, but not the movie.\n\nRon and Hermione are prefects—but not in the movie.\n\nIt's revealed in the books, but not the movies, that Professor Trelawney's prophecy about The Chosen One who will defeat Voldemort—\"born to those who have thrice defied him, born as the seventh month dies\"—could have also been applied to Neville Longbottom.\n\nHarry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\n\nHarry inherited Grimmauld Place and Kreacher in the book after Sirius Black's death.\n\nIn the book, Bill and Fleur are living at The Burrow planning their wedding, and Fleur clashes with Mrs. Weasley.\n\nAfter Draco leaves Harry unconscious on Hogwarts Express, Tonks finds him in the novel—but it's Luna in the film.\n\nThe story of the pureblood Gaunt family—Voldemort's descendants—is cut from the film.\n\nThough the Burrow is attacked by Death Eaters during the Christmas on the big screen, that never happens in the book.\n\nIn the film, it's not mentioned that the werewolf Greyback turned Lupin.\n\nYears earlier, Dumbledore rejected Voldemort's Defense Against the Dark Arts application, which may be why the position is cursed.\n\nGinny hid the Half-Blood Prince's book in the Room of Requirement in the film, but Harry did it in the book.\n\nFor the novel, Harry and Ginny's first kiss is in front of the whole school during a Quidditch match.\n\nIt's not explained in the film that Snape named himself the \"Half-Blood Prince\" because he's half wizard, half muggle, and his mother's maiden name is Prince.\n\nBill Weasley is bitten by Fenrir Greyback in the book.\n\nGinny and Harry are in relationship throughout much of the book, but Harry breaks up with her for safety.\n\nHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\n\nHarry's farewell with the Dursleys is omitted from the film, including Dudley thanking Harry for saving his life. (But it is a deleted scene in the adaptation.)\n\nThe backstory of Regulus Black, a former Death Eater and Sirius' brother, is not expanded upon in the films.\n\nRemus' reveal of Tonks' pregnancy, the birth of their son Teddy, and the fact that Harry is the godfather isn't mentioned in the film.\n\nHarry and Hermione do not dance together in the tent in the books like they do in the film.\n\nIn the novel, Harry discovers the message on the Snitch soon after he receives it, as opposed to in the film when he figures it out much later.\n\nPeter Pettigrew dies in the books after being compelled to strangle himself with the hand gifted to him by Voldemort.\n\nIt's Harry's idea to release the Gringotts dragon in the novel, but Hermione's in the films\n\nDumbledore's full backstory—from his friendship with Gellert Grindelwald to the tragedy of his sister Ariana—isn't detailed in the movie.\n\nPercy is very much present at the Battle of Hogwarts.\n\nIn the book, Hermione and Ron's first kiss is in-front of Harry...after they destroy the Horcrux.\n\nHarry breaks the Elder Wand in half at the end of the film. But in the book, he uses it to fix his wand, and then returns it to Dumbledore's grave.\n\nMissing Film Characters\n\nCharlie Weasley - Ron's second oldest brother who works with dragons in Romania\n\nPeeves - A mischievous Hogwarts Poltergeist\n\nWinky - Barty Crouch's drunken former house elf\n\nProfessor Binns - A ghost who teaches History of Magic at Hogwarts\n\nAndromeda and Ted Tonks - Nymphadora Tonks' parents\n\nGeneral Notes\n\nJames and Lily Potter were just 21 when they died, but were portrayed by much older actors. Same with Remus, Sirius, and Peter, who would have been around 32 when they were first introduced in Prisoner of Azkaban.\n\nPotterheads have long complained about how Ron was portrayed in the films. While he largely served as comic relief, many of his braver and more intelligent moments throughout the books were given to Hermione on the big screen.\n\nFans also feel that Ginny was dealt a disservice in the films, as she was much more outgoing, vivacious, and dynamic in the books.\n\nFor more stories like this, sign up for our newsletter.\n\nMcKenzie Jean-Philippe\n\nEditorial Assistant\n\nMcKenzie Jean-Philippe is the editorial assistant at OprahMag.com covering pop culture, TV, movies, celebrity, and lifestyle. She loves a great Oprah viral moment and all things Netflix—but come summertime, Big Brother has her heart. On a day off you'll find her curled up with a new juicy romance novel."
