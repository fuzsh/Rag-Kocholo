I was a car hop You were into be-bop You sang do wop diddy wop diddy wop doo All of them changes you put me through If I could go back again Well I know I'd never let you go Back with some of my friends To that wonderful '65 love affair We wasn't gettin' nowhere But we didn't care It was a crazy '65 love affair Rock 'n' roll was simple and clear Oh, I still can hear I can hear it baby Well I asked you like a dumb-dumb You were bad with your pom-poms You said ooh wah go team ooh wah go Ooh-ee baby I want you to know If I could go back in time Well, I know somehow you'd still be mine I wouldn't be so blind To that wonderful '65 love affair When rock 'n' roll was simple and clear Oh, I still can hear I can hear it baby Well, I tried to make you give in One night at the drive-in You said oh no baby, oh no woo All of them changes you put me through If I could go back in time Well, I know somehow you'd still be mine I wouldn't be so blind To that wonderful We sang doo wop diddy wop diddy wop doo Doo wop diddy wop diddy wop doo
