Welcome back to Music Mondays, where I share a song that I like at the start of the week. This week is “’65 Love Affair” by Paul Davis. I’m sure I heard this on the radio, but I primarily became familiar with it with the “80s Flashback” CD from Target’s Pure Gold Hits line of compilation albums.

It’s a song about lost love, but the tune is so happy you’d never know unless you paid attention to the lyrics.

I was a car hop

You were into be-bop

You sang “do wop diddy wop diddy wop doo”

All of them changes you put me through

If I could go back again

Well I know I’d never let you go

Back with some of my friends

To that wonderful

’65 Love Affair

We wasn’t gettin’ nowhere

But we didn’t care

It was a crazy

’65 Love Affair

Rock ‘n’ roll was simple and clear

Oh, I still can hear

I can hear it baby

Yeah!

Well I acted like a dumb-dumb

You were bad with your pom-poms

You said “ooh wah go team ooh wah go”

Ooh-ee baby I want you to know

If I could go back in time

Well, I know somehow you’d still be mine

I wouldn’t be so blind

To that wonderful

’65 Love Affair

When rock ‘n’ roll was simple and clear

Oh, I still can hear

I can hear it baby

Well, I tried to make you give in

One night at the drive-in

You said “oh no baby, oh no woo”

All of them changes you put me through

If I could go back in time

Well, I know somehow you’d still be mine

I wouldn’t be so blind

To that wonderful

’65 Love Affair

We weren’t going nowhere

But we didn’t care

It was a crazy

’65 Love Affair

Rock ‘n’ roll was simple and clear

Oh, I still can hear

I can hear it baby

We sang

“doo wop diddy wop diddy wop doo

doo wop diddy wop diddy wop doo

(Oh yeah)

doo wop diddy wop diddy wop doo

doo wop diddy wop diddy wop doo

doo wop diddy wop diddy wop doo

doo wop diddy wop diddy wop doo

doo wop diddy wop diddy wop doo

(Go, go, go team go!)

doo wop diddy wop diddy wop doo

(Go, go, go team go!)”

If I could go back again

Well I know our love would never end

Back with all my friends

To that wonderful
