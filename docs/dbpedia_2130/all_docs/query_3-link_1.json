        "text": "I was born in North Wales in 1951. While still at school I discovered the work of sci-fi, fantasy author Ray Bradbury and this instilled in me a burning ambition to become an author. My first children's book, Sebastian Darke: Prince of Fools (2007), was published all around the world and became a five-part series. I have gone on to publish many other books for younger readers from middle grade to YA.\n\nTitles include my Edinburgh trilogy Crow Boy, Seventeen Coffins and One For Sorrow, and stand-alone novels The Calling, The Slithers, The Sins of Allie Lawrence, The Book of Secrets and Stand and Deliver. A new novel Flipped! will be published by UCLan Publishing in 2025.\n\nI also publish novels under the pen name of Danny Weston. There are eight titles to choose from - The Piper, Mr Sparks, The Haunting of Jessop Rise, Scarecrow, Inchtinn, The Witching Stone, A Hunterâ€™s Moon and Postcards from Valhalla."
