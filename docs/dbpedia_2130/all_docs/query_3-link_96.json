        "text": "We are proud to present a rare scoop of The Forbidden by author F R Tallis. This book has been hailed as `a darkly joyful ride with creepy and thrilling moments in abundanceâ by the Independent on Sunday. And we think it will become a classic of the horror and supernatural genre. Although this author has written crime novels under another name this is his debut writing as F R Tallis.\n\nEach rare first edition book has been signed, lined, dated, doodled and numbered at his home in London. And they are first edition first printings.\n\nThe Forbidden starts when ambitious Doctor Paul ClÃ©ment takes a job at the mission hospital on Saint SÃ©bastien, he has dreams of discovering cures for tropical diseases. What he finds is a place where the black arts are just a way of life. After witnessing the ritualistic murder of a young man, said to be one of the living dead, he is forbidden to speak of what he has seen. On returning to Paris, ClÃ©ment’s attention turns to studying the nervous system and resuscitation. He is told of patients who have apparently died, been brought back to life, and whilst suspended between life and death, experience what they believe to be heaven. ClÃ©ment attempts a daring experiment in order to confirm these extraordinary reports, but the outcome is wholly unexpected. Could it be that when he is resuscitated, he brings something back with him – an ancient evil, so powerful that it can never be destroyed? Is the good doctor slowly succumbing to madness, or has he really passed through the gates of hell?\n\nFrank Tallis is a writer and clinical psychologist. In 1999 he received a Writers’ Award from the Arts Council of Great Britain and in 2000 he won the New London Writers’ Award. In 2005 MORTAL MISCHIEF was shortlisted for the Ellis Peters Historical Dagger Award and for the Quais du Polar Award in France, 2007. FATAL LIES was longlisted for the International Thriller Writers’ Best Paperback Award, 2010. DARKNESS RISING was runner up for the 2009 Medical Journalist’s Association fiction award and shortlisted for the Elle Prix de Letrice in 2010. It was also shortlisted for an Anthony and an Edgar in 2011. DEADLY COMMUNION was shortlisted for an Edgar in 2012. The Liebermann books have been translated into fourteen languages and optioned for TV adaptation. Frank Tallis also writes horror and supernatural fiction as F.R.Tallis. THE FORBIDDEN (2012) is published by Macmillan. THE SLEEP ROOM will be published Summer 2013.\n\nReview\n\n‘Reading The Forbidden offers the same thrilling sense of familiarity and discovery as stumbling across a top-notch Hammer movie or a vintage Dennis Wheatley novel….What we have here is a proper scare-your-socks-off horror tale, featuring gore, demons, possession and exorcism. Tallis weaves real historical figures into the narrative and conjures up fin-de-siÃ¨cle France beautifully, but his main intention, excellently achieved, is to jolt even the hardiest of hearts’ –Financial Times\n\n‘a darkly joyful ride with creepy and thrilling moments in abundance’ –The Independent on Sunday\n\nBook Description\n\nWhen ambitious Doctor Paul ClÃ©ment takes a job at the mission hospital on Saint SÃ©bastien, he has dreams of discovering cures for tropical diseases.
