        "text": "I’ve been a published author since 1977. When I began, I was writing thrillers for grown-ups and you’ll find them on this site… but since 2007, I’ve been writing for children.\n\nMy best-known books are the Sebastian Darke adventures, which relate the tale of a hapless would-be jester and his miserable sidekick, Max. They have been translated into several languages and are read by children all around the world.\n\nI also created the Alec Devlin mysteries, the dark and sometimes terrifying adventures of a fifteen-year-old archaeologist, with a knack for encountering danger and intrigue, wherever he goes. Each book concerns a different ancient civilization.\n\nMost recently, I’ve embarked on the Movie Maniacs series. Have you ever wanted to be in the movies? Mr Lazarus, the new projectionist at the Paramount Picture Palace has found a way to put you there… quite literally.\n\nMore projects are on the way, so keep coming back – read my blog, send me a line to tell me what you thought about a book, or simply ask a question. I do my best to answer every message I receive!\n\nAuthor Visits\n\nWould you like me to visit your school or library? I specalise in events for large groups of children, which usually comprise a talk, reading and a lively Q & A session. I specialise in motivating children and after a visit, I often hear back from teachers who tell me that their children have started work on their own books! I can also arrange to do a book signing, with all titles offered at discounted prices. If you would prefer a workshop session, I can offer these too, but with smaller groups (up to 30 children).\n\nTo make a booking, or for more information, please contact me directly at philipcaveney@gmail.com or phone 07821619842"
