        "text": "BOOKTHINK: So where are you from Philip?\n\nCAVENEY: I was born in North Wales, but my parents were in the RAF and I spent much of my childhood trolling around the length and breadth of Britain, with a few years spent in Singapore and Malaysia.\n\nBOOKTHINK: Tell us your latest news.\n\nCAVENEY: The thing that I'm most excited about at present is that we have serious film interest from Hollywood. I can't name any names, but a major player has read Sebastian Darke and wants to make a movie of it! Of course, it might all come to nothing, but it's caused some sleepless nights.\n\nBOOKTHINK: When and why did you begin writing?\n\nCAVENEY: When I was around thirteen, I read a Ray Bradbury novel called Something Wicked This Way Comes. It absolutely blew me away and I quite clearly remember thinking, \"This is what I want to do with my life.\" From then on, I began to write stories. I think I drove my English teachers half mad with my desperate attempts to create fiction from the most inane topics.\n\nBOOKTHINK: When did you first consider yourself a writer?\n\nCAVENEY: In 1976, when I sold my first novel, The Sins Of Rachel Ellis. I don't care what anyone says, the day somebody likes your work enough to pay money for it, is the day you feel different about your abilities.\n\nBOOKTHINK: What inspired you to write your first book?\n\nCAVENEY: I'd been reading a lot of Arthurian books, with particular regard to Merlin and I thought, \"I wonder if I could do a contemporary version of it.\"\n\nBOOKTHINK: Who or what has influenced your writing?\n\nCAVENEY: Funnily enough, cinema is a much bigger influence on me than other writers. I see my books as \"head movies\" which play on a big silver screen in my cranium.\n\nBOOKTHINK: How did you come up with the title Sebastian Darke?\n\nCAVENEY: I created the character and he needed a name. He was always going to be Darke, and somehow, no other Christian name seemed right for him. I recently received an email from the real Sebastian Darke, telling me he had been given the book and was enjoying it.\n\nBOOKTHINK: What books have most influenced your life?\n\nCAVENEY: Umm... I'm not sure they have influenced my life, but the following titles have been a big influence on my career as a writer: Lord of the Flies, Catcher In The Rye, Something Wicked This Way Comes and the complete works of Elmore Leonard.\n\nBOOKTHINK: If you had to choose, which writer would you consider a mentor?\n\nCAVENEY: Well, originally it was definitely Ray Bradbury. These days I'd have to go for Elmore Leonard. I appreciate he's writing for a totally different market to me, but I've always admired his ear for dialogue and the fact that at seventy-odd his writing is still so cool!"
