        "text": "Get 'paid' to walk using free apps\n\nWalking has great value – not just to your health, or to the environment, but also monetary value. This is because there are a plethora of free apps (or ones you can use if you have certain health/life insurance plans) that effectively pay you to walk.\n\nHow to keep fit for FREE\n\nGetting something totally free is likely to get a true MoneySaver's heart pumping faster than any cardio workout ever could. But, if that's not enough, I've rounded up 20+ ways you can exercise and get fit without spending a penny, both outdoors and at home.\n\nHanley Economic launches top easy-access savings rate in 14 years at 4.25% - but you need to jump through some hoops to get it\n\nHanley Economic Building Society's new easy-access savings rate is the highest in 14 years and it overtakes the previous top rate of 3.71%.\n\nTed Baker to close all remaining stores after falling into administration – your shopping, refund and gift card rights explained\n\nFashion retailer Ted Baker will close all remaining stores this week, after falling into administration in March this year. Below we round up what you need to know – including how to try to get your money back if you've been left out of pocket.\n\nTesco shopper? You've got two weeks left to spend £14 million of expiring Clubcard vouchers – or extend them with our trick\n\nIf you've got a Tesco Clubcard, check if you have any vouchers close to expiring, as £14 million-worth are due to run out on Saturday 31 August. Don't want to spend your vouchers yet? We've got a trick to extend their validity.\n\neBay to stop accepting American Express from today – be careful if you're planning to use PayPal as a workaround\n\nOnline marketplace eBay will stop accepting American Express ('Amex') cards as a direct payment method from today (Saturday 17 August). You'll still be able to use your Amex on eBay by going through PayPal – but be wary of doing this with large purchases, as you may lose valuable Section 75 protection.\n\nInflation-linked broadband, mobile and TV price hikes to be banned from next year\n\nBroadband, mobile and pay TV firms will no longer be able to hit customers with inflation-linked price hikes mid-contract from January 2025, regulator Ofcom has confirmed. But, as MoneySavingExpert.com (MSE) founder Martin Lewis has warned, the new rules will still allow for above-inflation price rises.\n\nMartin Lewis: Confused by the difference between the 'two-child benefit cap' and limits on Child Benefit? An explainer\n\nConfused about the 'two-child benefit cap' and what it really means? MoneySavingExpert.com founder Martin Lewis has a quick and simple video briefing to clear up some of the misinformation. It takes you through Child Benefit rules, the two-child limit for Universal Credit and the benefits cap.\n\nBuy now, pay later regulation confirmed by new Government – but timeline remains unclear\n\nRegulation of the buy now, pay later (BNPL) sector WILL go ahead, the new Government has confirmed. It means consumers will finally get much-needed safeguards on BNPL purchases, as well as protection from unsustainable borrowing – something MoneySavingExpert.com (MSE) and its founder Martin Lewis have long campaigned for. Though we still don't know when any new rules will take force."
