        "text": "Wow this is a book that should be on every collectorâ bookshelf! The team at Doodled Books can’t speak highly enough of Philip Caveney – his writing style is amazing and Sebastian Darke is one of our favourite series.\n\nNow this book is tipped for the top – currently a Big Name Hollywood Film Company is looking at buying the film rights. Take a look at the pictures for more visuals of this book. Each bookÂ is numbered 1 of 1 signed, lined, dated (with the publication date) and rare doodle.\n\nProduct Description\n\nMax, the talking buffalope, has an enquiring mind, a keen sense of humour, and a grumpy disposition. Orphaned by the villainous Neruvians, sold off as a slave to the callous Berundians, he escapes into the wilderness, is attacked by vicious lupers, and rescued in the nick of time by the jester, Alexander Darke.\n\nAlexander is young and fairly unsuccessful. Done out in a costume of many colours, he totes his caravan around, entertaining people with (mostly bad) jokes. Max settles in with Alexander and his elvish wife, Sarah. He makes himself indispensable and the partnership prospers. Word gets around, and a Royal Command Performance is arranged. They are top of the bill. But everything that can go wrong goes wrong…. hilarously. The hitherto lugubrious King Cletus is enchanted. Stars overnight, they see off their arch-rival, the bad comic Jonathan Jolly.\n\nSarah finds that she is expecting a happy event. Fetch the midwife! A nightmare journey back. Max to the rescue again! Sebastian Darke is born.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nPhilip Caveney is the author of the hugely successful Sebastian Darke and Alec Devlin series for children, as well as many thrillers for adults. Originally trained in graphic design, he has worked extensively in the theatre in London and Wales and as an advertising copywriter, lyricist and screenwriter.\n\nProduct details"
