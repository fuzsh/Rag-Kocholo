        "text": "There are three age categories – Bookbug Readers (age three to seven), Younger Readers (age eight to 11) and Older Readers (age 12 to16). All this year’s winning books have fantastical themes, from a magical mouse to a mysterious shop.\n\nPuttock, from Edinburgh, who was a previous winner in 2006, won the Bookbug category for his picture book Mouse’s First Night at Moonlight School, illustrated by Ali Pye.\n\nThe book follows Mouse on her first day at Miss Moon’s Moonlight School where she is too shy to even say hello. Luckily, with help from Miss Moon and her new friends Bat, Cat and Owl, a game of hide-and-seek makes Mouse feel at home.\n\nMacKenzie, from Renfrew, scooped the Younger Readers prize with The Nowhere Emporium which tells of orphan Daniel Holmes’s adventures when he stumbles upon a shop from nowhere that appears in Glasgow. Its owner, Mr Silver, draws Daniel into a breathtaking world of magic and enchantment.\n\nHe previously won the award in 2011 for fantasy adventure Zac and the Dream Pirates.\n\n“These awards are extra-special because it’s the readers who make the final decision. Children don’t often get the chance to have a voice on this sort of scale, and I believe it’s important for them to know that they have that voice and that their opinions matter,” said MacKenzie.\n\nWeston, who has published three other novels under the name Philip Caveney, won the Older Readers category for his book The Piper.\n\nIt follows Peter and his little sister, Daisy, who are evacuated from London to the countryside and find themselves on an isolated farm in the middle of a treacherous marshland.\n\nAs Daisy gets drawn deeper into the secrets of their new home, Peter starts to realise that something very sinister is going on.\n\nWeston, from Glasgow, said: “I am absolutely thrilled to have won this award, especially because it has been voted for, not by critics and industry insiders, but by the people who matter most; the young readers for whom the story was actually written. Thanks to everyone who voted for The Piper. You have rocked my world.”\n\nHis previous books were time travel adventures, all set in Edinburgh at different points in its history. The first book Crow Boy is set in Mary King's Close, Seventeen Coffins is all about the tiny coffins found on Arthur’s Seat in 1836 and the most recent book, One For Sorrow, is all about Robert Louis Stevenson.\n\nThe Scottish Children’s Book Awards are run by Scottish Book Trust and supported by Creative Scotland.\n\nJasmine Fassl, head of schools at Scottish Book Trust, said: “It’s a well-worn statistic that a love of books is more important for children’s educational success than their family’s socio-economic status. Initiatives like the Scottish Children’s Book Awards are intended to instill a love of books in children right from the very start, by making the process of reading fun, interactive and collaborative.\n\n“But it’s the teachers, librarians, parents, and of course the authors and illustrators, who bring this project to life for the pupils – who download the resources, who put on the silly voices, who cuddle and tickle and leap about.\n\n“Today we’re celebrating all the people who bring the magic of books to children and set them on a path to being booklovers for life.”\n\nEach winning book received £3,000, and this year almost 30,000 votes were cast by children.\n\nAly Barr of Creative Scotland said: “Once again the Children’s Book Awards confirm Walt Disney’s maxim that 'there is more treasure in books than in all the pirate’s loot on Treasure Island'. If you’re only buying one book for your child this year, buy all three.”"
