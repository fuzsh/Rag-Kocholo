        "text": "Category: Non-Fiction\n\nA Ship in the Dark- Yarrow Townsend\n\nYarrow Townsend’s 2022 debut The Map of Leaves was an exquisite and thrilling tale of a fiesty orphaned girl who can ‘hear’ plants with an eco-thriller self sufficiency plot driving an adventure across the landscape to seek a herbal cure, and ultimately the true cause of the sickness spreading through the lands. Thus I'm delighted … Continue reading A Ship in the Dark- Yarrow Townsend\n\nGlassborn- Peter Bunzl\n\nI’m delighted to be rounding off the celebrations for the publication of Glassborn by Peter Bunzl which launched yesterday. I've been a huge fan of Peter's writing since Cogheart with its ability to address the shadows of our ordinary lives and shine a light of hope for healing through the realms of historically inspired fantasy. Glassborn … Continue reading Glassborn- Peter Bunzl\n\nHistory Factopia! Paige Towler and illustrations by Andy Smith\n\nBritannica Books have been on a mission the last few years producing children’s educational content with vibrancy and vigour bringing both a respected name and fun to the classroom or non fiction shelves in your home. History Factopia! is bursting full of bite sized facts of a historical nature and is ideal for fans of … Continue reading History Factopia! Paige Towler and illustrations by Andy Smith\n\nInto the Faerie Hill H S Norup\n\nToday, the third eco fabulist novel from HS Norup is published, Into The Faerie Hill brings us to European folklore about The Hidden Folk, and the landscapes, particularly hills that should not be disturbed in the name of human progress. If you've known me for a while, ecofabulism is one of my favourite genres, with … Continue reading Into the Faerie Hill H S Norup\n\nLet’s Get Festive: Gracie Fairshaw and Trouble At the Tower by Susan Brownrigg\n\nToday is my turn in the Let's Get Festive! 12 Days of Christmas Tour, and I’ve thought long and hard about what to feature here. I thought about leaning into another folklorist Wintertide like I did with The Clockwork Crow, but then as everyone else on the tour was taking a jolly tone, I thought, … Continue reading Let’s Get Festive: Gracie Fairshaw and Trouble At the Tower by Susan Brownrigg\n\nStand And Deliver- Philip Caveney\n\nPhilip Caveney has brought his thrilling adventures to historical settings with Stand And Deliver! Perfect for lovers of historical fiction that asks questions of its readers about the way we frame lovable rogues and criminal behaviour, and ideal for those studying the History of Crime and Punishment- though perhaps more relevant at the GCSE end. … Continue reading Stand And Deliver- Philip Caveney"
