        "text": "Author Philip Caveney visited the Library on Friday to speak to S1 and S2 students about his work. Philip recently won the Scottish Children’s Book Award with his novel The Piper, a ghostly tale written under the pen name Danny Weston. His new book The Calling is set in Edinburgh on an evening when, once a year, all the city’s stautes come to life. Philip challenged students to name the statues featured in the book before entertaining us with a reading."
