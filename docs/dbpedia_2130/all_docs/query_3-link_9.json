        "text": "December 27, 2023\n\nIt's been a long time since I last read a Lost Civilization novel. In fact I thought the genre had been adopted by science fiction writers. Nevertheless, this is one. A forgotten Aztec city hidden away in dense forest somewhere in the south of Mexico with its own little active volcano ready to obliterate the evidence at the end of the adventure. And I really mean little - it is bubbling away beneath the city step pyramid, which appears to be hollow and acts as an artificial volcanic cone.\n\nAlec Devlin, his companions Mr. Coates and Ethan Wade, and a motley group of fellow travellers crash land in the jungle and are soon captured by very unfriendly warriors from the mysterious city of Colotlan. The city is ruled by Chicahua, a twelve year old boy emperor who is struggling to resist his high priest - think in terms of Conrad Veidt in The Thief of Baghdad - the wicked Itztli, and is not really being helped much by his adviser Coyotl. Coyotl turns out to be a British explorer called William Travers who \"went native\", as the saying used to be, in a big way. I assume he is loosely based on Percy Fawcett, who disappeared in the Amazon rainforest in 1925. His role in the plot seems to be to resolve the problem of language differences and allow the dialogue to flow. Can Alec and his pals escape being sacrificed to the gods? It's bound to be a close run thing.\n\nCompared to The Eye of the Serpent this story works quite well, despite all of its silliness and improbability. The reason I think is that here Alec is finally allowed to be free of adult protection and become an action hero under his own steam. The moment that happens after the plane crash the plot improves immeasurably, the pace increases, and the action is no longer held back by the adults acting out dialogue from old movies and old memories. The ending may be a little sentimental but, let's face it, the kid had been battered, bruised, threatened, chased by a jaguar and shot in the back with an arrow fired by a living dead ghoul. He deserved a lie down and be a trifle weepy. It's all very silly but sit back and lap up the fantasy and it's not at all bad.\n\nFebruary 7, 2013\n\nI really liked this book because, while it's fiction and fantasy, it is based on real facts about the Aztecs, Mexicans and the civil war and how it portrays americans as people who only care about personal gain and showed a petrol mine in Mexico where an American doesn't care about the Mexicans and their rainforest and cuts it down for his mine in the name of \"progress\". I choose to read this book because its written by Philip Caveney and I enjoyed his Sebastian Darke trilogy. It's about an adventurous teenager in the 1920's when Mexico had just emerged out of civil war and his father works in the embassy on behalf of Britain. Alec sets out with his faithful valet Coates. Alec is the main character. It's really fun to relate to him personally as he is a teenage boy who just doesn't understand some of the wrong things that seem to happen and because hes young and not matured yet, he questions all the things that everyone else would just normally accept as commonplace. It's amazing how a life threatening situation can force you to think about the things that really matter in life. The author has summarised most of the story in the blurb, which at the start made me think this must be a very predictable book, BUT, when I got to reading the characters and the sheer detail in which they were described and their personalities, they are so complex just like real life. There are so many twists and moments where your heart is literally beating at twice the speed. The only reason I didn't think it was perfect was because I didn't like the ending, it seemed too planned and plotted and bits where the author just decribes how the people ared feeling when they are locked up in a cell and about to die which is pretty obvious they're going to feel horrified. This book is really good for people who like to think a lot and relate stories with real life to learn something from them.\n\nI think this book could fit into the category 'A book that teaches you about another time in history' because, although it is fiction, many of the horrible things mentioned in that book are true and reminder of the past where lots went wrong and no one did anything about some of those things."
