        "text": "I am shining a spotlight on The Rat King: The Rats of Letniv Volume One by Emma Miles as part of her blog tour.\n\nThe Rats of Letniv is a prequel to the Fire-Walker saga and Land Beneath the Sky companion books. This young adult, fantasy was published on 31st October 2023.\n\nBlurb\n\nBeing the son of a Coven Lord is a far and desperate cry from luxury and safety. Every day Rothfel must prove he is worth the food his father puts on the table, and avoid the notice of Lord Atise’s brutal bodyguard, Bicken. When his only friend, a lowly slave, is cruelly taken from him, Rothfel finds himself alone in the sprawling, chaotic city of Letniv.\n\nYearning for friendship, love, and approval, he is offered a hand from the unlikeliest of places…\n\nBut who is really worth his loyalty?\n\nAkimas Atise, his distant, cold, and terrifying father?\n\nGolghen, the mysterious chameleon of Letniv city; king of liars, king of thieves?\n\nGentle, brave Leida; slave, concubine, descendant of the free women of the north?\n\nOr Zephyr? Ghost, murderer, and devoted follower of the King of Rats.\n\nRothfel is only ten, but his choices, his love, his loyalty… will change the Land Beneath the Sky.\n\nBlurb from The Rat King by Emma Miles\n\nA Word from the Author\n\nI often get asked when I knew I was a writer; the answer is always. A writer is what I am, it’s in my soul. There have been times in my life when I couldn’t write, and times when my writing has been the only thing that kept me going. I think I always longed for something deeper from life, something more meaningful, and I found it in my imagination and in the music of words.\n\nIt was poetry which first caught my attention, and whilst my younger cousins called for ghost stories it was animals I first wrote of. I think I gravitated toward fantasy because of the freedom it gives, I could create my own worlds and decide my own rules. My Wind’s Children trilogy was born from an image that came to me whilst daydreaming, of a young man sitting alone below a bridge. I didn’t know who he was; it turns out neither did he, but we found out together.\n\nI’m now working on my seventh book and love writing more than ever, it’s an addiction, an obsession, but one I now share with my wonderful writing family. My beta readers, my editor, and you, my readers, having you with me on my journey means the world to me.\n\nI write as much as I can around work, but I also try to squeeze in a ridiculous amount of hobbies! I’m a wildlife photographer and do a little archery. I paint, sculpt with clay, withies and driftwood, preferring to be outdoors if I can. I still have a love for the theatre, having started out in life studying backstage crafts, and a great love for language. I speak a little French, Romanian and Italian, ma non molto bene!\n\nThanks for reading this. If you read any of my books and love them, please come say hello and tell me, you’d be surprised at how much that means to an author.\n\nTake care of yourself.\n\nEm x\n\nYou can read reviews on Goodreads and Amazon.\n\nI would like to thank Dave from The Write Reads for inviting me on tour to Noly for designing and creating the banner.\n\nIt is my stop on the epic Do Penguins Like the Cold? blog tour. So grab your life jacket and wrap up warm – it’s time to go polar!\n\nIn this entertaining and highly informative book, expert field guide Huw Lewis Jones and nature illustrator Sam Caldwell take readers on an intrepid voyage to meet the eighteen species of penguin and to witness the conservation work underway to protect these incredible birds and their native habitats.\n\nBy observing penguins first hand, readers will discover whether penguins truly like the cold, how their diving skills make up for the fact that penguins can’t fly, and how to tell what a penguin had for dinner based on the colour of its poo!\n\nYou’ll travel by ship across mighty oceans, visit remote islands and trek across icy landscapes to discover all the different types of penguin, from emperors and kings to chinstraps and rockhoppers. This book is packed with facts, fun and everything there is to know about penguins and gives readers a taste of what it’s really like to work in the wild.\n\nHuw Lewis Jones is an expedition leader, naturalist and award-winning author of books for adults and children, including Do Bears Poop in the Woods? He teaches natural history at Falmouth University and is lucky to have met many penguins in the wild.\n\nSam Caldwell is an illustrator based in Glasgow, Scotland. He studied painting at the Edinburgh College of Art and is the\n\nillustrator of several books for children, including Do Bears Poop in the Woods?\n\nMy stop on the tour takes the form of a book review.\n\n********\n\nTitle: Do Penguins Like the Cold?\n\nWritten by: Huw Lewis\n\nIllustrated by: Sam Caldwell\n\nPublished by: Thames & Hudson\n\nDo Penguins Like the Cold? by Huw Lewis and Sam Caldwell is a fascinating tour to Antarctica with tour guide Huw and expedition illustrator Sam. On our trip we can learn lots of incredible facts about penguins and where they live, how they survive and what we can do to protect them in their natural homes and habitats. This creative non-fiction picture books contains everything you want to know about penguins and more.\n\nSome of my favourite parts was discovering where the word ‘penguin’ originated from and learning the differences between the eighteen species of penguin, what they eat and how technology can help them.\n\nThe illustrations are bold with bright backgrounds and borders that bleed to the edges of the page. There is a lot of action in the pictures to keep young readers turning the pages and encourage them to explore. Included throughout are images of Huw and Sam and their band of excited children who are accompanying them on the expedition.\n\nThis entertaining picture book would be perfect for children interested in wildlife and conservation and useful in the classroom to support a project on contrasting environments or Humans and Animals.\n\n********\n\nYou can buy copies of Do Penguins Like the Cold? by Huw Lewis and Sam Caldwfrom your local bookshop, or online at uk.bookshop.org which supports local, independent bookshops.\n\nTo follow the rest of the tour check out the schedule below:\n\nI would like to thank Anne Cater from Random Things Tours for inviting me to take part in this blog tour. Thank you.\n\nTo read my other reviews of children’s books published by Thames and Hudson see:\n\nBlog Tour – If I had a Polar Bear\n\nBook Review: The Tiny Grain of Sand\n\nBook review – Photo Adventures\n\nThe latest addition to the wildly popular series of bedtime stories imagines what it would be like to have a polar bear for a pet.\n\nWhat would it be like to have a polar bear as a pet? It might be an unconventional\n\nchoice, but it would be sure to give the best bear hugs…\n\nPolar bears are cuddly but they’re also very strong. As marine mammals, they can swim for days at a time – that’s serious perseverance! So if Santa ever needed help delivering his presents, guess who he would call?\n\nJoin our funny female protagonist as she wonders ‘what would life be like… if I had a\n\npolar bear?’\n\nBlurb for If I Had A Polar Bear by Gabby Downay and Alex Barrow\n\nGabby Dawnay is a writer and poet. She is a regular contributor to OKIDO magazine\n\nand a script-writer for children’s television.\n\nAlex Barrow is a London-based illustrator, and the art director for and a regular\n\ncontributor to OKIDO magazine.\n\nAlex and Gabby are the duo behind children’s picture books If I had a dinosaur, A House\n\nfor Mouse and A Song for Bear, all published by Thames & Hudson.\n\nMy stop on the tour takes the form of a book review.\n\n********\n\nTitle: If I had a Polar Bear\n\nWritten by: Gabby Dawnay\n\nIllustrated by: Alex Barrow\n\nPublished by: Thames & Hudson\n\nIf I Had A Polar Bear by Gabby Dawnay and Alex Barrow is a heart-warming picture book about love and imagination. A young girl dreams of owning a polar bear and all the things they could do together. As well as being a lovely story it is full of interesting facts about polar bears.\n\nI enjoyed the way the illustrations are part of the text. This worked perfectly on the pdf I was sent but not so well in the e-book as my e-reader did not format the pages properly. This meant the illustrations were all out of place so the text unfortunately did not make sense.\n\nWritten in rhyming couplets this book was easy to read aloud. The illustrations of the polar bear as a faint pencil outline gives the desired effect of the polar bear being imaginary. but also highlights how a polar bear’s fur is translucent not white. I particularly liked the addition of double-page spreads with no text. The pastel colours add to the magical feel of the story.\n\nA highly entertaining read. A great book for reading at bedtime and for encouraging young children to use their imagination.\n\n********\n\nTo follow the rest of the tour please see the schedule below:\n\nYou can buy copies of If I Had A Polar Bear by Gabby Dawnay and Alex Barrow from your local bookshop, or online at uk.bookshop.org which supports local, independent bookshops.\n\nI would like to thank Anne Cater from Random Things Tours for inviting me to take part in this blog tour.

The sources for the data for each spread are listed at the back of the book providing opportunities for the reader to check them for themselves.\n\nEach double-page spread is introduced by the fictional character Lucia who comes from Spain, written by the publisher Mireia Trius. Starting with her name, family and pet Lucia moves on to talk about world population and significant cultural features such as languages, jobs, school and religion. Children can explore what life is like for Lucia in Spain compared to where they live and the rest of the world. The data is presented in interesting, visually stimulating ways which every reader can spend hours exploring. The infographics will engage the most reluctant reader as they are able to browse the pages in any order.\n\nIt was fascinating to discover that Hong Kong has the smallest average house sizes at 45m² compared to Australia which has the largest average house size at 214m²; or to compare the different school uniforms around the world and noticing very few of them wear ties and blazers; or view age, geography and language as if here were only 100 people in the world, which really does put things in perspective.\n\nThis would be an excellent resource for introducing the study of data and statistics to Key Stage Two pupils and would also be great for discussion points in PSHE and Citizenship. It would also be a good way of introducing the use of different keys and different graphical ways data can be presented. This book provides the foundations to help children recognise how data can be manipulated by presenting it in different ways, such as changing to vertical scale to make it bigger or smaller, or skipping numbers, not starting at zero, which is an important skill in our increasingly digital world.\n\nThis book was originally reviewed for Armadillo Magazine\n\nSomething I particularly enjoy is writing plays. I think it comes quite naturally to me as I am a very visual writer. During my career as a teacher and as a writer I have written a wide variety of plays for primary school. Many of these were for school Christmas productions when I was teaching. I have also had several plays published. I am particularly proud of Quick and Easy Plays for Primary School, which is a teacher resource of twenty-seven plays compiled into a folder.\n\nTitle: Quick and Easy Plays for Primary School\n\nWritten by: Anita Loughrey\n\nIllustrated by: Catherine Ward\n\nPublished by: Hopscotch Educational\n\nThis lever arch folder, published by Hopscotch Educational, a division of the Mark Allen Publishing Group, contains twenty-seven differentiated and cross-curricular Quick and Easy Plays for Primary School with teacher notes and suggestions for making props and costumes.\n\nThe plays were written to be versatile, so they could be used for guided reading as well as being performed on stage. I have used this resource during school visits to encourage students to create and write their own plays. The handy ring-binder format allows the teacher to add their own notes, which is always useful in a teaching environment.\n\nThis folder contains plays themed around the following topics:\n\nChildhood Experiences – friends, school journey, Victorian childhood\n\nTraditional stories – fairy tales, myths and legends, fables\n\nStories form other cultures – creation stories, Chinese festivals, Christmas\n\nEach topic contains three differentiated plays for the age range. As you can see, there are nine plays in each chapter. The first play in each set of three is the easiest and is suitable for younger or less able children within this age range. The language level and stage directions are much simpler than in the next two. The font size is also larger in the first plays. Here is an example of one of the simpler plays:\n\nThe third play in each set of three is the most challenging play with more complex language and more detailed stage directions. The font size is smaller in these plays. Here is an example of one of the more challenging plays:\n\nThere are six folders in the series, each written by a different author. Mine is aimed at ages 9-10, which would be Year Five.\n\nTo purchase a copy of Quick and Easy Plays for Primary School by Anita Loughrey directly from the publisher Hopscotch Educational, or your local bookshop should be able to order copies.\n\nTitle: Music and How it Works: The Complete Guide for Kids\n\nWritten by: Charlie Morland\n\nIllustrated by: David Humphries\n\nConsultant: Gareth Dawson\n\nPublished by: DK Children\n\nMusic and How it Works: The Complete Guide for Kids provides answers to questions such as, why do we like music, do animals like music, how sound is made and what animal can produce the highest pitch? It provides a very comprehensive look at music and everything involved in creating and listening to music. For example children can discover more about the seven ingredients of music: rhythm, dynamics, melody, harmony, tibre, texture and form. It discusses reading music and the different notes as well as explaining sharps and flats, intervals, tones and semitones and octaves.\n\nThis book provides opportunities for children to discover their own love of music by looking at scales, chords and keys, different instruments and different genres such as opera, blues, rock and hip-hop to K-pop and electronic music. The author, Charlie Morland, includes ‘playlists’ of key pieces encouraging the children to look up pieces of music to listen to themselves. There is also an insightful look behind the scenes at the process of the music industry.\n\nThe vibrant, modern feel using bright colours, photographs and infographics will appeal to children of all ages. I particularly liked the way this book clearly explains the psychology and math behind music, how it can affect our mood and improve our minds and the research into the Mozart Effect. At the back of the book is a musical timeline which gives a breakdown of music throughout history from the first percussion to using streaming apps such as Spotify.\n\nThis is the ideal book for anyone who is interested in music whether that is listening to their favourites, or learning an instrument, or writing and composing their own songs from the introduction to the final chorus. It is guaranteed to help children to develop a deep passion for music. The perfect addition for all school libraries.\n\nThis book was originally reviewed for Armadillo Magazine.\n\nOver the years I have written a lot of teacher resources. 100+ Fun Ideas for Science Investigations in the Primary Classroom is one of my favourites.\n\nTitle: 100+ Fun Ideas for Science Investigations in the Primary Classroom\n\nWritten by: Anita Loughrey\n\nIllustrated by: Pat Murray\n\nPublished by: Brilliant Publications\n\nIt contains over 100 exciting, fun classroom experiments in an easy-to-use layout to help teach scientific investigation in the primary classroom. The activities require a minimum of preparation and only the simplest of science equipment. Each activity provides opportunities for children to develop their skills of scientific enquiry.\n\nAll experiments listed in this book closely match the statutory and non-statutory guidelines and schemes of work for Key Stages 1 and 2.\n\nWith the aid of this book, the children are given the confidence and courage in order to thrive inside the classroom whilst having fun in the meantime. This therefore naturally promotes the development of key scientific attitudes applicable both inside and outside of the classroom. Group co-operation is also encouraged within the investigative activities, helping to enforce the importance of leadership and appropriate communication skills.\n\nThis compilation of exciting ideas for classroom experiments has been tested and approved by primary school teachers over a period of 17 years of education. You can be assured that the activities in this book will lay the relevant foundations for secondary education and support every child’s journey through education.\n\nTo purchase a copy of 100+ Fun Ideas for Science Investigations in the Primary Classroom by Anita Loughrey directly from the publisher Brilliant Publications or from your local bookshop will be able to order copies, or online at uk.bookshop.org, an organisation with a mission to financially support local, independent bookshops."
