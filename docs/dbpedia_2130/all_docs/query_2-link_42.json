        "text": "Pretentious Gay Crow\n\nGroup: Members\n\nPosts: 770\n\nJoined: 20-November 18\n\nAwards: 2\n\nThe Terraformed Mars Community Project\n\nThere is very little that the people of Mars can agree on, but one of those precious few includes the truth that we are not of this world. Every culture of every corner of the globe tells a tale of survivors fleeing a damaged world, traversing the space between the stars to come here and make a new home. But whatever unity those first settlers had has long since dissipated, and now man makes claim to every piece of land available to him. Kings and queens, warlords and despots, rulers fair and cruel alike vie with one another for limited space, from the bottom of the Mariner Valley to the peak of Olympus Mons. But man’s claim is tenuous, for the beasts and the trees and the land itself still assert themselves, reminding that none is above the wills of nature.\n\nThis is the story of Life on Mars.\n\n~~~~~~\n\nThe Terraformed Mars Community Project focuses on the peoples and species of a terraformed, but still hostile, Mars. In it, people can make the plants and animals that inhabit the Red Planet five million years post terraforming, from the lowliest insect to the mightiest whale. Once the biota has been sufficiently filled out, people can begin officially making societies that inhabit the world. Both parts will be purview to some rules, which will be explored in more detail below.\n\nThe Setting\n\nThe specifics of the timeline before humans first started terraforming Mars isn’t the focus of this project and will be kept vague; all you need to know is that Earth was in rough shape and began a great automated terraforming project on Mars that went sideways. First, the seed species component was partially damaged, leaving out most of the original biota planned, including any domestic species. Even worse, however, was the fact that the department that was made to give colonists technology to survive a still-terraforming planet was damaged beyond repair. To compensate, the terraforming AI gave the planet 5,000,000 years to evolve to partially fill in the gaps and allow the planet to better sustain a human population.\n\nThe human population was mainly composed of cryoslept scientists, engineers, and other experts, and so had some beginning knowledge of basic agriculture and metallurgy. This allowed more organized societies to appear earlier than if they had started as entirely hunter-gatherers. At the present day, roughly 1,000 years after human settlement, iron age societies are increasingly the norm across regions capable of supporting advanced agriculture. Still, in regions too hostile for farming, hunter-gatherers still exist, making due on the edges of habitable Mars.\n\nThe fate of Earth will be left unexplained by me and this project. Feel free to speculate in and out of universe though!\n\nThe Rules and Expectations: Spec\n\nThis is probably the easier thing to talk about, since this is a spec forum. To begin with, individual species will be described using the following format I ~~stole~~ borrowed from Chuditch’s Hellhole Continent.\n\nQUOTE\n\nCOMMON NAME\n\nGenus species (note: optional, since this means very little to the Martians themselves)\n\n[Picture of the creature (optional)]\n\nOTHER NAMES: Does it have any alternative common names?\n\nANCESTOR: What seeded species does it descend from?\n\nSIZE: Specify what you are measuring, such as height or length.\n\nDIET: What does it eat? Please give a more detailed description than just 'meat' or 'plants', for example 'medium-sized to small mammals' or 'low shrubs and grasses'.\n\nDISTRIBUTION: Where on Mars does it occur? Give a rough description, for example 'Mariner Valley' or 'north-east Elysium.' Alternatively, you can provide a map of its range.\n\nHABITAT: What habitat does it prefer?\n\nBIOLOGY:\n\nA general description of the creature, including its evolutionary history, habits and appearance. Should be at least a paragraph long, but optimally more.\n\nINTERACTIONS WITH HUMANS:\n\nA range of information regarding the creature's relationship with humans can be discussed here. Until human societies get the greenlight, keep it fairly vague. If done after, feel free to go into detail.\n\nIf I had to ask for a theme for the species, I’d say “Bizarro Pleistocene” or “Low Fantasy Ice Age”. That means very little, I know, but hopefully that gives the idea of what I’m picturing in my head.\n\nLooking at the map down below, all of the species were seeded somewhere between Mariner Valley and the northern shore of the Tarsis Plautau, leaving the Hellas Basin devoid of life initially.\n\nOnce enough species have been described (as decided by me), we can start adding humans more directly to the mix. That does not mean, however, that you can’t submit more species!\n\nThe Rules and Expectations: Humans\n\nI am well aware that this may be the first time some of you may try your hand at human worldbuilding, and so some more detail will be needed.\n\nTo begin, you will use this template for making your society. Like it says at the top, what you write there is not binding, it's more a proof of concept for your culture/nation/people. If it needs work, I am more than happy to help revise it, until it's ready for the project.\n\nSome things to consider when making your nation that will make it more likely to be approved:\n\n1. Don’t make it gross. This seems self explanatory, but I think it warrants closer attention. There is no problem with making a fictional society that doesn’t appeal to all our modern sensibilities regarding race, gender, sexuality, and other such issues; nor is it inherently bad if you talk about such issues, and the consequences thereof, in moderation. That is not an excuse to be a bigot yourself and make a gross utopia in your image. It’s the difference between “the Gronks hate the Slonks due to ancient rivalries and simple bigotry” and “the Gronks hate the Slonks because the Gronks are great and pure while the Slonks are dirty and gross and deserve to all die.”\n\n2. Don’t make obvious one-to-one parallels to existing cultures and nations. This is more a personal taste thing, but I’m generally not a fan of sci-fi/fantasy cultures that are just “Romans in Space!” or “The Chinese but Magical!” That isn’t to say you can’t take inspiration from existing cultures, just don’t make it a direct copy.\n\n3. Don’t do an agenda. I know a lot of you here have strong opinions on the environment and how humans treat it, but don’t make your whole people an aesop. So no anti-extinction crusaders against all logging, and no doomsday ecocide corpo-fascist dictatorships.\n\n4. Cooperate with other people. This is not a competition to make the most powerful and perfect nation ever conceived, but a collaborative worldbuilding project. The more you include and play off others ideas, the more attached it will feel to the world.\n\n5. Try not to make too many pop culture references. Look, I love it when far-future settings either get modern stuff wrong or even mythologize it, and to a certain extent that will happen here. But don’t make it too blatant, where it’s like “SpongeRobert the Square fought the Evil King Plankton, thus creating the sea.” If you want to make a pop culture reference in your culture, really, really distort it and fold in a dozen other references until the original story is so far removed that its barely recognizable.\n\nResources\n\nThe Seed List\n\nWorkshop Thread\n\nThe Map\n\nThanks to AlexanderNorthAH on DeviantArt for the base, and Kamm for providing the coastal border.\n\nMap with Martian Region Names\n\nThis post has been edited by prehistorickid: Jan 9 2024, 10:28 PM\n\n--------------------\n\nCurrent Projects:\n\nSelector's Choice: A seedworld filled with peoples favorite species, very chaotic.\n\nThe Sapient Condition A fantasy slice-of-life webcomic with heavy spec evo and worldbuilding focus. Currently in early development, but snippets can be found in COM's 133, 136, and 137.\n\nMud and Coal Community project about a seed world with a Devonian-Carboniforous vibe. Curated by BlueSkinnedBeast, Torvo, and myself.\n\nUncertain Status Projects:\n\nUnnatural Reserves: A community project about a god-like entity evicting humans from certain regions and the consequences thereof.\n\nThe Many Worlds of Odd Gods: A community project about the spec evo adventures of gods with very niche domains.\n\nTemere: One iteration of an old project of mine, with fantasy and spec evo elements. Many of the concepts will be reworked into The Sapient Condition.\n\nPassergrande: Basically a South American version of Madagascar.\n\nLas Islas del Atlantico: My first proper forum project about an enlarged Azores. Most of it doesn't hold up to my current standards but I enjoy what I made for it.\n\nGeneric Seed World Project: Low effort thing I do when I feel like it.\n\nSpoiler: click to toggle\n\nSapient Bivalve\n\nGroup: Moderator\n\nPosts: 745\n\nJoined: 2-July 21\n\nAwards: 8\n\nSHUGGOATH\n\nBubalovis nivalis\n\nPicture\n\nOTHER NAMES: Great Shoat, Woolly Buffalope, Lord of the Snows, other names\n\nANCESTOR: Takin (Budorcas taxicolor)\n\nSIZE: Roughly 3.5-4m in length and up to 2.5m at the shoulder\n\nDIET: Mixed grazer/browser. Eats grass, other low-growth plants, smaller shrubs and trees, occasionally low-calorie foods like mosses, lichens and tree bark.\n\nDISTRIBUTION: Dry tundral regions of the southern hemisphere between the Argyre and Hellas Seas.\n\nHABITAT: Polar tundra and/or mammoth steppe.\n\nBIOLOGY:\n\nOne of the largest descendants of the Takin, the Shuggoath approaches the size of a woolly rhinoceros or Elasmotherium. Possessing a long, shaggy coat of thick hair over an insulating underlayer of short, very dense fur, it is well adapted to the sometimes extreme cold of the Martian tundra biome. The outer coat is reddish-brown in the summer and grey in the winter, offering at least token camouflage to such a large creature.\n\nSomewhat resembling a very large musk-ox in overall appearance, but proportionally taller, the Shuggoath has a prominent nose similar to that of the saiga. The closely-spaced, swollen nasal passages both filter out Martian dust and warm the cold air entering the lungs. Both sexes grow horns, though the horns of males are longer; females’ horns are usually not much more than pointed nubs. Males use their horns for sexual display and combat; usually a mutual sizing-up of the size of the two males and their horns is enough to settle the issue but closely-matched bulls will fight by butting their horns.\n\nAs a large grazer-browser, the Shuggoath herds are partly responsible for maintaining the mammoth steppe-like quality of much of the southern tundra, trampling or eating tree saplings and keeping the biome open. Shuggoaths switch between grazing in the summer and browsing in the winter, even eating lichens and tree bark when other food is not available. Their herds are typically composed of up to 20 animals, normally adult females together with their calves from the prior two years’ breeding cycles. Adolescent (3rd year) males are driven away and form bachelor herds of up to 10 individuals, competing for mating rights in their 4th and 5th years.\n\nINTERACTIONS WITH HUMANS:\n\nShuggoaths are large enough and have an extended enough juvenile period that domestication is very difficult. They are, however, a large and impressive species that is often imbued with totemic, ritualistic or symbolic meaning by the human cultures that impinge upon their range.\n\nShuggoaths intruding onto human-settled lands are often driven off or hunted and killed; with their gregarious nature and highly adaptable diet they can do serious damage to any crops. They are large enough that any Shuggoath is potentially dangerous; bachelor males are particularly aggressive, however. Their hides and pelts are highly prized for blankets and suchlike, but the difficulty of killing them can make Shuggoath hide a prestige good.\n\n--------------------\n\nCurrent Projects:\n\nThe Clambrian: Bivalve seedworld\n\nDrassoffa: A community prompt seedworld of fossil formations, managed by SunSnowJaguarunnos25\n\nSelector's Choice 2: Electric Boogaloo: Second iteration of a very chaotic collaborative seedworld, managed by prehistorickid\n\nUncertain Status:\n\nThe Beak Shall Inherit the Earth: Rise of the Dicynodonts\n\nHelp Topics:\n\nPlant Spec: Not As Hard As You Think: How to spec with plants as well as animals\n\nHow To Make Your Seedworld Interesting: General advice for seedword spec"
