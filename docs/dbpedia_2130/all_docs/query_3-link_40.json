        "text": "Tag: Friendship\n\nInto the Faerie Hill H S Norup\n\nToday, the third eco fabulist novel from HS Norup is published, Into The Faerie Hill brings us to European folklore about The Hidden Folk, and the landscapes, particularly hills that should not be disturbed in the name of human progress. If you've known me for a while, ecofabulism is one of my favourite genres, with … Continue reading Into the Faerie Hill H S Norup\n\nBookBounding: Mini Collection for Libby and the Highland Heist by Jo Clarke, illustrations by Becka Moor\n\nTo celebrate the publication of Libby and the Highland Heist, I embarked upon a cosplay project to honour the stories, the intent and Becka Moor’s illustrations.

Perfect for lovers of historical fiction that asks questions of its readers about the way we frame lovable rogues and criminal behaviour, and ideal for those studying the History of Crime and Punishment- though perhaps more relevant at the GCSE end. … Continue reading Stand And Deliver- Philip Caveney\n\nThe Miraculous Sweetmakers: The Frost Fair by Natasha Hastings illustrated by Alex T Smith\n\nI'm honoured to be celebrating Natasha's gorgeous middle grade debut The Miraculous Sweetmakers: The Frost Fair which is released in the UK on the 27th October, my only regret, is that I didn't have enough time, nor energy to create a bookbounding costume in time for my date on the Write Reads Tour, as I … Continue reading The Miraculous Sweetmakers: The Frost Fair by Natasha Hastings illustrated by Alex T Smith"
