I began by writing thrillers for adults and you’ll find info about them on the site… but since 2007, I have written almost exclusively for children and young adults.\n\nI began with the Sebastian Darke books, the madcap adventures of a would-be jester and, after that, the books just seemed to spill out of me!\n\nIn 2012, I decided I also wanted to write supernatural stories, so I invented my evil twin, Danny Weston, who specialises in books that give readers the chills! (Click on the scary face top right to read more about his titles!)\n\nThere’s always a new project on the boil and like most authors, I love to hear from my readers. You can send me a line, share your views on a book you’ve recently read - or simply ask me a question.\n\nI do my best to answer every message!\n\nAvailable Now!\n\nStand and Deliver!\n\nNed is awkward, a little shy, and just trying to find his place in the world. He also happens to be the assistant to the nation's most feared highwayman, The Shadow...\n\nIn a time when highwaymen ruled the roads, Ned is reluctantly swept up into a whirlwind of adventure. Whilst escaping the grasps of the thief-takers, Ned soon finds himself stepping into his Master's shoes and an unwanted life of crime. The pressure is building with new friends and enemies galore when Ned stumbles upon a long-infamous gem, The Bloodstone, which forces him to make an important choice. Can he ultimately escape this new threat and finally free himself from the grips of The Shadow?\n\nOrder from Amazon here"
