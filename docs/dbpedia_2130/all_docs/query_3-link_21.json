        "text": "Sebastian Darke: Prince of Pirates: A motley crew of adventurers on the trail of hidden pirate treasure and danger.\n\nSebastian Darke is a half-elf, half-human whose father bequeathed him the family business: itinerate Prince of Fools. Sebastian unfortunately has no talent for jokes or juggling, as his last job proved, but he does have a talent for getting in trouble.\n\nSebastian is heart-broken and on the way to Ramalat to hire a ship to take him, his cantankerous buffalope Max and the fierce Golmiran warrior Cornelius to sea to find Captain Callinestra’s fabled treasure. Cornelius bought the map from a dying man when he was in hospital recovering from his wounds he got in the struggle to help set Princess Kerin, now Queen Kerin, on the throne of Keladon. Queen Kerin and Sebastian cannot be together since she must marry to secure her throne, and Sebastian isn't royalty. In order to get to Ramalat they must past through the Geltane Forest and trouble awaits them around every bend.\n\nPhilip Caveney wastes no time and jumps directly into this sequel to Sebastian Darke: Prince of Fools. Sebastian Darke: Prince of Pirates is a stand alone young adult novel full of sorcery, double crosses, pirates, danger, surprises and adventure. Sebastian and his tiny band of travelers are quirky individuals. The author sets a fast pace with side trips into absurdity and slapstick humor. There is everything from sophomoric bathroom humor and subtle witticisms to mystery and danger in this adventure on the high seas.\n\nCoupled with comic book style illustrations, Sebastian Darke: Prince of Pirates is a rollicking and exciting adventure that pays due homage to Robert Louis Stevenson’s Treasure Island, Captain Kidd and every swashbuckling movie of the 1940s and 1950s. I found Sebastian Darke’s latest adventure charming and fun.\n\nReviewer: J. M. Cornwell"
