        "text": "This British import features an inept jester who has inherited his fatherâ€™s pointy cap but none of his skill, a wisecracking buffalope, a waist-high soldier who has dauntless courage, and an intrepid, though spoiled, princess who finds her true self through adversity. What more could a quest novel require? Other than the quest, of course, which the aforementioned jester and aspiring comedian Sebastian, seventeen and needing to earn his way in the world, promptly undertakes. His simple desire to work in a nearby kingdom turns into an epic pursuit to save the princess from the treacherous king, leading to kidnappings, murder plots, and battles with fierce, filthy, and loathsome creatures (and even less hygienic brigands), all requiring every bit of bravado and cleverness Sebastian and his loyal allies can muster. This rollicking adventure includes an ideal mix of medieval setting, sardonic humor, absurd situations, and memorable if not complex characters. Even if King Septimus lacks depth, for example, his unmitigated evil is a crisp contrast to the earnest, if sometimes bumbling, good-hearted efforts of Sebastian and his buffalope, Max. Medieval fans looking for a breezy and amusing perspective to balance the often weighty tales of knights, quests, and honor will find this an entirely enjoyable outing, and they will be pleased about the promised sequel wherein Sebastian and Max, having saved their first princess, will surely be ready for more adventure."
