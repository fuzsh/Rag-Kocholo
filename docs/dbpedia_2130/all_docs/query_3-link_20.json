        "text": "June 15, 2022\n\nI don't know what it is, whether I'm already used to the formula, the book features my favourite story setting (the sea), or the author genuinely improved, but I enjoyed the second book in tis series far more than I did the first. Many of the same issues still persist as in the first book, but Prince of Pirates starts of far quicker with less exposition, gets interesting quicker, has better landing jokes, & all round more solid characters & relationships. As well as that, something I failed to mention in my first review, was the fact that all the plot threads were tied off, & many aspects brought up earlier, always had a payoff in the end, barring a few. This ability to not leave any plot threads untied is genuinely something to admire within a writer's style, & can certainly make up for weak prose or uninteresting storylines, & I commend the author for having so much control over his plot.\n\nOverall, a certainly amazing read, a hidden gem that helped me unwind & just enjoy myself, & I am still glad this series showed up on my bookshelf for no reason one day years ago.\n\nAugust 1, 2017\n\nSilly fluff of a sequel. There's nothing wrong with it (and a lot right): Max's grumbling buffalope and Cornelius the brave are back with Sebastien; there's some dark magic, and some scary eel shark things, and a castaway, and a beautiful young captain, and obstacles to overcome, and treasure found and lost. There are more adventures to be had. I'm not sure there is more to learn about the characters. I think I'll have to leave the other sequels for another lifetime...\n\nJuly 26, 2024\n\nThis edition's cover truly not giving it any justice, it looks like a middle grade kind of book, but I will consider more like an innocent YA, I liked it a lot , the adventure the thrill , The Characters .\n\nthis one is a very Pirates of a Caribbean flavored adventure. and I like how you can see the development of charcutiers in it , Esp. Sebastian. cant wait to read the third one.\n\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.\n\nJune 23, 2021\n\nÑe, son libros entretenidos para pasar el rato, sin más ni más pero eso sí, son libros pensados para niños\n\nSeptember 8, 2023\n\nEs mi libro favorito desde los 12 años. Tiene un par de huecos incidentales, no de la trama en sí. Aún así es muy divertido.\n\nJuly 28, 2012\n\nThoughts on the Overall Book: I thought it was a good book, it wasn't great, but it wasn't the worse thing I have read either and I did enjoy it. It was a classic adventure story, and if it was a bit cliché, than that is just typical of the genre, so I'm okay with that.\n\nCharacters: Sebastian, Cornelius and Max are a fun trio, and again typical of the adventure genre. I enjoyed their banter and how they interacted with each other. I also liked Jenna a lot, though I was afraid she was going to be one of those \"I can rule the world\" women because she was a ship's captain. She wasn't anything like that though, and for that I'm grateful. Yes, she and Sebastian had a little of romantic interest between them, but it was not distracting to the story-line. I also like the Kid, he was actually one of my favorite characters. The villains, I think should have been better crafted, because they weren't really evil enough nor were they in the book enough. Leonora was scary and evil, but there should have been more of her.\n\nProblems/What bothered me:The problem with the baddies mentioned above mostly, and also it seemed that all the fight scenes between the characters and the villains should have been longer and more suspenseful, but that is my only main complaint. As I said, this isn't the best book I've read, but I don't really have anything else to complain about either.\n\nConclusion: 3 stars. I wish I could have been able to find the first one to read first. It's not really necessary to this story to do so, but I think it might be a better story. I do want to read the other books in the series.\n\nRecommended Audience: Young teens or older who enjoy adventure stories. There was no bad content or language so it could be read by anyone 12 and up, I would say. It's an easy read and if you're looking for something meatier, you might be disappointed by it, but as a fun summer read it's good.\n\nMay 25, 2009\n\nA motley crew of adventurers on the trail of hidden pirate treasure and danger.\n\nSebastian Darke is a half-elf, half-human whose father bequeathed him the family business: itinerate Prince of Fools. Sebastian unfortunately has no talent for jokes or juggling, as his last job proved, but he does have a talent for getting in the way of trouble.\n\nHeart-broken and on the way to Ramalat to hire a ship to take him, his cantankerous buffalope, Max, and the fierce Golmiran warrior, Cornelius, to sea to find Captain Callinestra’s fabled treasure. Cornelius bought the map from a dying man when he was in hospital recovering from his wounds in the struggle to help set Princess Kerin, now Queen Kerin, on the throne of Keladon. Queen Kerin and Sebastian cannot be together since she must marry to secure her throne and Sebastian isn't royalty.\n\nIn order to get to Ramalat they must past through the Geltane Forest and trouble awaits them around every bend.\n\nPhilip Caveney wastes no time and jumps directly into this sequel to Sebastian Darke: Prince of Fools. Sebastian Darke: Prince of Pirates is a standalone young adult novel full of sorcery, double crosses, pirates, danger, surprises and adventure. Sebastian and his tiny band of travelers are quirky individuals that set a fast pace with side trips into absurdity and slapstick humor. There is everything from sophomoric bathroom humor and subtle witticisms to mystery and danger in this adventure on the high seas.\n\nCoupled with comic book style illustrations, Sebastian Darke: Prince of Pirates is a rollicking and exciting adventure that pays due homage to Robert Louis Stevenson’s Treasure Island, Captain Kidd and every swashbuckling movie of the 1940s and 1950s. I found Sebastian Darke’s latest adventure charming and fun.\n\nSeptember 28, 2010\n\nAkhirnya buku Sebastian Dark kelar juga dibaca, sepertinya butuh waktu yang lama untuk membaca buku ini. aku bingung apakah karena ceritanya yang gak terlalu menarik perhatianku atau karena niat membaca sedang berkurang..hehehe..\n\nBuku ini ternyata buku lanjutan alias buku kedua. Tapi sepertinya setiap buku memiliki pertualangan yang berbeda sehingga jangan khawatir kalau belum membaca buku pertama tapi sudah membaca buku keduanya, seperti aku ini,,hehehe\n\nDibuku ini, Sebastian bersama dengan teman seperjuangnya Max dan cornelious (semoga gak salah nama, males buka bukunya lagi sih..)\n\nmempunyai misi untuk mendapatkan harta karun.\n\nTetapi perjalanan mereka ternyata tidak semudah yang dipikirkan, banyak sekali kejadian-kejadian yang mereka alami, kadang mengerikan, lucu membuat kita tertawa terkhusus si Max, kerbau yang unik, kenapa unik ??? karena bisa ngomong,,hehehe,,,\n\nWalaupun buku ini lebih banyak menceritakan pertualangan Sebastian dkk untuk mendapatkan harta karun, tetapi ada cerita cintanya juga,,hehehe,,\n\nSebastian yang digambarkan sebagai seorang pria tampan bisa membuat seorang kapten cantik bernama Jenni suka padanya. Tetapi Sebastian yang pada saat itu masih terpengaruh kutukan dari seorang penyihir cantik tapi jahat bernama Leonora. Jadi ada kisah \"cinta bertepuk sebelah tangan\" nih.\n\nSo, buat yang ingin membaca buku ini, selamat membaca pertualangan Sebastian dkk untuk mencari harta karun, yang katanya peta harta karun yang mereka dapatkan sebenarnya mereka beli dari seseorang yang akan mati..hehehe..jadi gak yakin nih, Sebastian bisa mendapatkan harta karun atau tidak ya???? (Jawabannya, cari sendiri dibuku ini ya..:) )\n\nAugust 6, 2024\n\nActual rating: 3.5 stars\n\nI really am enjoying these books. Sebastian is still sort of nerdy, though I also wonder how all the ladies swoon over him (like Cornelius wonders). Oh well, guess he has some sort of charm the women pick up on ;)\n\nI really wish Jenna had a different name because it doesn't really fit her character. I can't decide what her name should be (unusual for me in these sort of situations) but I didn't think Jenna fit her at all.\n\nThe ending surprised me a bit. I was expecting something completely different to happen, but I was happy what I thought was going to happen didn't. It would have made me sad.\n\nOne more to go to wrap up Sebastian's adventures. I enjoy these characters and the stories, so I'm excited to see what happens next.\n\nOctober 22, 2013\n\nSuka...petualangan lautnya keren. Meskipun si Sebastian Darke ini tampaknya bukan tipe pahlawan favorit saya. Lemah terhadap wanita dan perlu banyak keberuntungan. Tapi saya suka sama sifat Sebastian yang sangat menyanyangi Max.\n\nDi sini Sebastian, Cornellius dan Max berpetualang mencari harta karun di sebuah pulau terpencil. Masalah pertama mereka temui saat melewati hutan dimana ada penyihir wanita cantik yang jahat. Masalah berikutnya terjadi di lautan di mana dengan kapal Sea Witch yang dikapteni oleh seorang kapten perempuan bernama Jenna, mereka harus menghadapi perompak dan pelaut licik.\n\nMenemukan harta karun tersebut bukan berarti berhasil mendapatkannya. Terutama karena ada gangguan dari si penyihir dan pelaut licik.\n\nJune 28, 2010\n\nThis book was slightly better than the first one, although I'm not sure I liked tge ending as much. The witch's character seemed like an afterthought, even though she was present at the beginning. It added a little tension, but she should have been treated differently, ie. as more of a main character. I still love the main characters, despite their few flaws. I also love that in each book (so far) there is a strong female character. I found that somewhat lacking in the books I read as a kid, the women were usually portrayed as vapid and whimpering. I'd like to know what adventures befall Sebastian, Cornelius and Max next.\n\nJune 3, 2015\n\nIt was ok, reminiscent of Geoffrey McSkimming. Plenty of jokes and mucking around and dialogue that is supposed to be witty. The female characters are active and capable but all beautiful and all sexualised in reference to the main character (yawn of tedium). I would love a book like this with female characters that were equally active and capable but not attracted to or attractive to the main character and not always descibed so much in terms of beauty and slimness.\n\nIt didn't suck. Read it if you want to, I am not burning to read the whole series which seems likely to be the same thing over and over again possibly with different women.\n\nSeptember 2, 2009\n\nAnother fun installment in what appears to be the many careers of Sebastian Darke. In this one, he trades in his jester's hat for a tri-corn pirate's hat in search of a mythical treasure across the seas. The problem is, he and his friends are now plagued by a witch who has bespelled him and dogs their heels, throwing roadblocks in their way at every turn. Silliness and body humor included, this was a fun read that would appeal to both boys and girls, I think.\n\nAugust 28, 2009\n\nI REALLY enjoyed this one, actually more than the first. I was trying to decide if I would simply recommend this one to a friend or if I would say read them both. I think read them both, because then the characters' relationships and personal motivations and group dynamic will make more sense. But the plot in this one was much funnier to me, and I really liked it. The characters are absolutely hilarious and really feed off of each other really well. I will be recommending this one!\n\nFebruary 4, 2016\n\nKali ini yang lebih sering bertengkar dengan Max adalah Cornelius, membuat saya ketawa pukul-pukul bantal bacanya. Dan Sebastian... oh, demi gigi Shadlog! Yang di kepalanya, nyaris di seluruh perjalanan petualangan mereka, cuma diisi dengan perempuan cantik, perempuan cantik, dan perempuan cantik. Setelah hatiku cukup remuk di buku pertama? Yang benar saja! (meskipun kebanyakan bukan karena \"kehendak\"nya sih...)\n\nApril 28, 2009\n\nSebastian Darke is back in another humorous and epic adventure, with his pint-sized warrior buddy, and his morose talking buffalope. This time he is trading in his jester’s cap for a sword and taking on huge snakes, enchantresses, sea monsters, and blood thirsty pirates. Anchors away with Philip Caveney’s “Sebastian Darke: Prince of Pirates”.\n\nApril 27, 2012\n\nas Phil read this book (and other couple books) for his son, then it's good for kiddies. but the humour lies within is fair enough for mid-adult reader. really nice cut from a thriller-based-writer !!??..\n\n@_@\n\nNovember 12, 2012\n\nAlso diese Frauengeschichten lassen mein Herz bluten.\n\nDas Buch verflog wieder, aber ich persönlich brauche eine Pause bevor ich mir den dritten Band besorge und lese.\n\nImmernoch gut für Zwischendurch.\n\nJanuary 9, 2016\n\nAntes de empezar a leer el libro, no tenía mucha fe en él, pero en verdad me gustó mucho. Lo disfruté demasiado, esta combinación de piratas, aventuras, acertijos, centauros y tesoros es explosiva. Te sumerges en el libro completamente. Lo recomiendo\n\nDecember 5, 2010\n\nDi buku ke dua ini kisah petualangannya lbh seru dr buku pertamanya.\n\nMarch 4, 2012\n\nThe second in the series, I thought it captured my interest well, and I loved all the twists and new findings as the book goes on.\n\nRead\n\nDecember 5, 2010\n\nCerita petualangan yang seru dan kocak dengan bumbu ketegangan yang menghibur dengan Tuan Darke, tetap sebagai karakternya sang pangeran patah hati."
