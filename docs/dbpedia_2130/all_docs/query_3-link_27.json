        "text": "they said. We don’t know why, but mostly obeyed. The dog touched us though, so it had perhaps not had the memo. It was a nice looking dog, as was the other one at the party.\n\nBecause it was a party. The 60th birthday of Fledgling’s Clare, and along with many members of her family, some booky types had been invited, and we huddled in one corner, along with the dog. Helen Grant and Kirkland Ciccone had arrived at the same time, one trying to gain entrance at the front and the other at the back. (It’s not easy for us country types, arriving in the big city.) I was next, and simply followed the lady at the pedestrian crossing. Bearing both flowers and a gift bag she was clearly in the know. Then it was Alex Nye, who had chosen a different [again] route to the house.\n\nThere was much food. Kirkland said he was there to eat. I restrained myself – a little – but needed Helen Grant’s longer arm to reach the sweet stuff.\n\nI chatted a bit to my new friend from the pedestrian crossing, explaining – when she asked – that Kirkie writes strange books.\n\nWe all agreed that leaving by six would be good, and seeing how the others had arranged their outward journeys I offered to take them away in my taxi. One for all and all that. It’s complicated booking taxis… I was awfully afraid that I had accidentally asked them to come to a Perth address, but after hanging about on the pavement, there the cab was. So not Perth after all.\n\nThe literary conversation flowed better with less background competition. Foreign books are the way to go. Or historical crime. By happy coincidence we all required the same train from Waverley, and with my sharp elbows we even got seats together. It was clearly a popular time to leave Edinburgh. One by one we disembarked, saying we really need to meet up more often, what with our literaryness not always being appreciated by our near and dear ones.\n\nMaybe I can stop agonising about when to arrive if we do. I worked so hard at not being too early, only to find that the others were there already. Except for Philip and Lady Caveney who are so cool they arrived when we left… (It’s understanding how much party there is going to be. A bit like the length of string.)\n\nAnd whatever you do, don’t hand your mobile to Kirkie. He might just delete your photo.\n\nSome of you did see me coming and exited swiftly(ish). But that’s OK. I mean, it’s not, but it’s a free country, and if I saw fit to move to Scotland ten years ago, I dare say others are allowed to move to England, or even further afield.\n\nI refer – of course – to my retort to Herald Scotland’s panicky article about who was left now that Julia Donaldson had left the country. And yes, seeing as I was close to moving in the opposite direction, I didn’t exactly want to see any of the other nine authors disappearing too.\n\n‘Nine?’ you say. Precisely. I started counting and came up with ‘a few’ more Scottish children’s authors. Some of them pretty major, too, so the Herald wasn’t looking too carefully. (Won’t list them again, as it’s easy to get too listy, but read my post from January 15th 2014. Such a long time ago.) It was back in the day when authors regularly commented on here, and I was particularly taken by Kathering Langrisk who took three comments to get her own name right. ☺️ (With me it’s usually my address I can’t always manage. Crescent, Avenue, Gardens, Terrace.)\n\nI ruled against listing adult crime writers, and if I stick to this, I still have well over twenty more authors than I did in 2014. And I’ve not exactly gone out of my way to find every last one, although for my lunches I did scour every possible literary lady I could come up with. Among them were ones who ‘followed me’ to Scotland, like Che Golden, Lee Weatherly and Philip Caveney. Much appreciated.\n\nGeographically closest to me are Alex Nye and Moira Mcpartlin. Distance is not a problem though, and I have enjoyed getting to know Barbara Henderson and Lindsay Littleson. Artists Kate Leiper and Ross Collins are people I admire greatly. Sarah Broadley, Sheila Averbuch, Vikki Gemmell and Lynne Rickards make for good company at parties. And many more, from launches, events, awards.\n\nMoving to England is one thing, but anyone who moves to Vienna is likely to find me on their doorstep at some point.\n\nI have still to get my cinnamon bun act together. But one of these days. Slowly learning who likes coffee, or who must have tea. And if it should be Earl Grey, or absolutely not Earl Grey. And I had no idea how popular Prosecco would turn out to be. Not much call for Irn Bru.\n\nCovid – and Brexit – have changed lives. But there is still plenty of hope for the future of children’s books in Scotland.\n\nYou already know there was a launch last night for C J Dunford and her Fake News, talking to Dr Noir, aka Jacky Collins, about what she had done and why and how.\n\nCaroline, as she’s really called, is completely new and unknown to me, which makes her all the more interesting. She has her own teenagers, and her youngest son is also a non-reader, and she dedicated Fake News to him in the hopes that he’ll start reading. There was a little bit of adult pressure on him last night, so I’ll be contrary and hope that he can withstand this push to read.\n\nBut anyway, Caroline knows teenagers and what they are like, which as I said shows in the book. She spoke for a while with Dr Noir, and we were promised some mystery guests, which, being me, I didn’t relish at all.\n\nThey turned out to be Alex Nye and Philip Caveney, also with Fledgling Press, and so were totally welcome and it was good to see them. I should learn that they are unlikely to drag strangers in off the streets to discuss literature. Dr Noir withdrew and left the three of them to chat about how they write, and to compare notes, and to sing the praises of Fledgling.\n\nI have to agree. Fledgling publish a bunch of varied books for all kinds of readers, all with some Scottish connection.\n\nThis was another event where the Resident IT Consultant was quite satisfied, because he’d just finished Fake News and was feeling enthusiastic. Even Daughter muttered positive comments about what she heard, so clearly it’s an interesting sounding story, whether or not one ends up reading.\n\nCaroline is already writing a second book, about something else, but didn’t rule out returning to our Fake News team later on. Although, as she so nicely put it, she feels she left them in a good place, so they don’t absolutely need a sequel.\n\nSo, that was quite an acceptable book launch!\n\nHere’s one I went to earlier.\n\nA chance encounter online, with a fairly cute looking plague doctor, reminded me of my real life encounter with one of those. Real life, but, I think, not real plague doctor.\n\nOn the other hand, the way things are going, how could I possibly be sure?\n\nIt’s now nearly seven years since I made the jump and crossed over the Scottish border to live, which was a generally wise choice, or so I believe. Within days there was an event at an Edinburgh school, featuring none other but another Stopfordian, who has since also moved, but hadn’t then.\n\nIt was he, Philip Caveney, who had written about a plague doctor, and ever the good publisher, Clare at Fledgling had spirited one up, complete with stick and all. Mercifully I don’t recall what he was supposed to do with the stick.\n\nBut a good day was had by all, I’m sure, and I reckon his mask was a lot more uncomfortable than the ones we are wearing now. And we’re not getting into strange cars at all.\n\nIn Philip Caveney’s new book, The Sins of Allie Lawrence, 16-year-old Allie storms out of her home and gets offered a lift by a handsome young man. Which she accepts. (Don’t do this!)\n\nNick, as he calls himself, offers to make her [theatre] dreams come true, and Allie finds this far too tempting to say no. (Always say no!)\n\nShe signs a contract with Nick and he takes her to Edinburgh, where in fact, her dreams do come true. But as with everything that comes too easily, it’s perhaps less satisfying than Allie had hoped for. And Nick, well, he’s rather devilish, isn’t he?\n\nThis last thing was a relief to me. I’d have been far more worried about Allie, had Nick been a normal pervert preying on young girls.\n\nHowever, as we got close to the end, I could see no obvious way out for Allie and had to deduce that maybe she’d have to be sacrificed in order to show readers what not to do. Once you’re in with the devil, there really is no way out.\n\nThis is another great story from Philip, written in his usual strong style, and showing us what the world of theatre in Edinburgh might be like. Luxury flats and rave reviews. That sort of thing.\n\nRead and learn. And enjoy, obviously.\n\nYou could tell it has been cold in Edinburgh. For the launch of his new book The Sins of Allie Lawrence on social media, Philip Caveney has walked, or been made to walk, all over the place to be filmed saying stuff about his book. This is good. I reckon authors should be made to work hard. And Philip looks reasonably handsome in a knitted hat, so that’s not the disaster it could have been.\n\nHe started by reading from this, his 54th, or maybe 55th, book. He’s been at it for 43 years (which fact made Helen Grant say something less well thought through), so that could be why he’s not counting so well. But at least the flowers in the background were not plastic. Kirkland Ciccone wondered about that.\n\nAs you can tell, this launch was well attended by quite a few of Philip’s peers, and it felt almost as if we were meeting in real life. Except there was no cake. Apparently I was meant to do the cake. Oops.\n\nPhilip took us round past Söderberg’s and round some fancy apartment near the Meadows, and at least two theatres, plus other Edinburgh sights. It made us all wish we were there.\n\nOnce this prancing around town was over, it was question time, with lots of people asking, both from before and also during the event, as well as some recorded questions from three child readers. He likes his covers. In fact, he seemed to have some of them framed on the wall behind him.\n\n‘The ideas will come’, he said ominously regarding where he gets his ideas from. And he does like all his children, I mean books, because if he doesn’t, then how can he expect the rest of us to like them? Good question.\n\nThere will be at least three drafts of a book, taking two to three months to begin with. Philip quite fancies being picked by Netflix, and who wouldn’t? His alter ego, Danny Weston, was originally a character in one his early books, and someone he needs for the really creepy stuff. Like his most evil character, Mr Sparks, in the book dedicated to me. Such a relief to know that.\n\nHaving autonomy when he writes might be the best thing about being an author. In fact, if no publisher were to be interested in his books, Philip would still write them. He said something about ‘howling into the void’ but mercifully I have already forgotten what that was about. Sounds desperate. And just think, if his then 10-year-old daughter hadn’t wanted to read his totally unsuitable adult novel, there might never have been these books to entertain, or scare, younger readers.\n\nRewrite, rewrite, rewrite. He’s still not quite Ray Bradbury (but it can’t be long now), author of his favourite book, the book that changed his life. As to why Allie comes from Killiecrankie, Philip simply needed a ridiculous name. But not even this passed without argument (from a man closer to Killiecrankie than some of us).\n\nThat’s book launches for you. All sorts of people attend them.\n\nThe other day I discovered a lone book on the coffee table. That is unusual. Mostly I have a pile of three or four, that are either queueing or are emergency spares if things take a turn for the worse. But there I was, with just the one book. It’s Philip Caveney’s latest, which he’s about to launch this week. I now stand a small chance of reading the book by then. The Sins of Allie Lawrence. I’m scared already.\n\nThe Costa shortlist, by which I obviously mean the children’s Costa shortlist, turned up in the paper this past week. I’d like to think it’s because newspapers always feel this is important stuff, and not that they are keen to fill pages easily. I’ve only read one of the shortlisted books, Meg Rosoff’s The Great Godden. But as I looked at the five author photos, I could count meeting three of the writers. Should I get a hobby?\n\nI’ve got On the Cover of The Rolling Stone whirring around in my head. At the time – like in the early 1970s ? – I didn’t really know The Rolling Stone. But as Dr Hook sang so wistfully about it, I got that it was a big deal. Not sure what authors dream of, but I imagine that ending up on the cover of The Bookseller can’t be a totally bad thing to happen. Very happy for Liz Kessler whose new book, When the World Was Ours – out in January – is covering the latest Bookseller.\n\nBookwitch hasn’t ‘bitten’ for a long time. But better late than never.\n\nDanny Weston has a new book out, which he launched in Edinburgh on Friday. He had to do it without me, but I gather it went well enough despite this. It’s called Inchtinn, Island of Shadows. Danny had even baked Inchtinn cakes. I bet he ate most of them himself, or possibly his friend Philip Caveney helped with the eating. (I won’t post that picture here. It is too dreadful.)\n\nIf it’s dreadful you’re after, you only need to look at this photo from when the witch met Vaseem Khan at Bloody Scotland last month. Vaseem looks just fine, but, well, that creature on the left… Sorry.\n\nThat was the event when we discussed humour and how important it is, while not being taken seriously (!) by enough publishers. This is what Sarah Govett has found as well. After her dystopian trilogy a few years ago, she has tackled teen humour, much in the vein of Louise Rennison. If she’s to be believed – and I see no reason why not – teens are crying out for more funny books. India Smythe Stands Up is the book for you, fresh from Sarah’s keyboard.\n\nIt’s important to keep track of children’s books. Even the Resident IT Consultant seems to feel this. I was a little surprised to find his companion in the holiday reading sofa, but who am I to say anything?\n\nAnd, I knew this news was coming, but it’s still good to have it confirmed. There is another book from Meg Rosoff. It’s old YA, or some such thing. And not very long, apparently. We will have to wait until next summer, but the witch who waits for something good… (The Great Godden, since you ask.)\n\nI trust you will remember to attend Cymera next weekend? I mean, you already have your tickets, or at least a hitlist for events not to be missed, and your bag is packed and all that?\n\nGood. I’ll be generous. Your hitlist needn’t be the same as mine. It’s not technically possible to see it all, unless you are Hermione Granger, so choice needs to enter into things. There are some events where I’ve really had to decide who’s more important to me.\n\nAnd then the question is whether I’ll get up early enough on the Saturday to see Philip Caveney, who will now be without his partner in crime, Dawn Finch. (Of course I will. Just teasing.)\n\nThe other question is whether you can outlast me. Let me be the first to tell you that yes, you can. However keen I am, I will flag at some point.\n\nBut you know, there are so many people I like, like Helen Grant – wearing her YA mantle, but talking about her adult Ghost – and Moira McPartlin, Claire McFall, James Oswald, and yes, Philip Caveney. Robot Chickens. As well as these excellent people, there will be another 70 mostly unknowns [to me] so you won’t have to worry about any inconvenient quiet moments.\n\nGet your tickets here. Now, before they sell out. Which would be a good thing, but not for you."
