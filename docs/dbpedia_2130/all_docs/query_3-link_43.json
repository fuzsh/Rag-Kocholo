In September 2010 the company was restructured with a view to expanding the business and encouraging new talent in both the writing world and associated fields – namely illustration, increasing sales and enhancing company visibility. We now produce both printed books and ebooks distributed through Faber Factory.\n\nWe like to publish new Scottish writing talent, historically focusing on life stories, historical fiction and cookbooks but now expanded into teen novels, literary fiction and occasionally children’s books. This does not preclude writers of other nationalities submitting work – we read all submissions.\n\nRecent successes include Philip Caveney’s teen novel Crow Boy, Winchman by Chris Murray in 2013, The Darkest Walk by Malcolm Archibald and Life Behind Bars: Confessions of a Pub Landlady by Linda Tweedie and Kate McGregor, both finalists in The People’s Book Prize 2012 and Moira McPartlin’s The Incomers – shortlisted for The Saltire First Book Award 2012.\n\nWe run an annual design competition in association with Edinburgh College of Art, the winner of which produces a book cover for a Fledgling Press new title. Winner of the 2013 competition was Rachel Cartwright’s cover for Dickson Telfer’s The Red Man Turns to Green, published June 2013."
