        "text": "This semester, university police at UAM have been engaging in emergency preparedness training for everything from campus incidents to the total solar eclipse. UAM hosted Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) training in February for local emergency response units, including members from the UAM Police Department, the Arkansas National Guard, the Lake Hamilton and McGehee fire departments and representatives from state parks. This was the third time in the last year that UAM had hosted FEMA training. John Minard, Emergency Management Training Coordinator at the Arkansas Division of Emergency Management, instructed the FEMA courses taught on UAM’s campus. Minard stated, “By having a diverse demographic in these classes, we end up with the most important aspect: interoperability, meaning multiple agencies and jurisdictions working together, even if they never have before. This allows FEMA to integrate our resources into the community a lot quicker.” During the February FEMA training, attendees completed two courses: “Advanced Incident Command System for Complex Incidents, ICS 400” and “Intermediate Incident Command System for Expanding Incidents, ICS 300.” These courses gave attendees tools and management training to prepare them for unexpected and infrequent emergency situations. Another subject of discussion at the training was the total solar eclipse on April 8. The population of Arkansas was estimated to double in the path of totality during the solar eclipse. Attendees were informed that when an unusually large influx of people is anticipated to concentrate in an area, FEMA helps the cities organize and redistribute emergency personnel and equipment from nearby towns. FEMA also reminded the emergency personnel in attendance of their responsibility to communicate with their local businesses in preparation for the eclipse; grocery stores, hospitals and gas stations need to have more products and employees available to accommodate the influx of visitors. Chief John Kidwell, director of the University Police Department at UAM, stated, “Prompted by our FEMA training and in preparation for the solar eclipse, our police department ensured all UAM emergency vehicles were full of gas to prevent the officers from being grounded if there was a gas shortage. FEMA classes are helping our local city, county and government agencies prepare for emergency situations like this that we may not have thought about before.” FEMA classes are free to all residents of Arkansas. They are funded by a federal grant program called the Emergency Management Performance Grant (EMPG). EMPG funding allows these classes to be held in the community every few weeks. Volunteer, private and faith-based organizations often attend and benefit from interaction with the state’s first responders. For more information about upcoming FEMA courses at UAM, contact John Minard at john.minard@adem.arkansas.gov or call 501-683-6755.\n\nUAM recently received a donation of $150,000 from the Treadwell family in memory of Virginia Lee Treadwell Allen. Allen, a Monticello native, passed away in May 2023. She was the eldest of seven children. Throughout her life, she held various jobs, including roles in bookkeeping and accounting, before retiring as an interior designer. Renee Treadwell, Allen’s sister, graduated from UAM in 1979 with a Bachelor of Arts in elementary education degree. She explained the motivation behind her family’s gift to UAM, stating, “Even though Virginia wasn’t formally educated, she knew education was very important and encouraged all her siblings to get a higher level of education. From the time she graduated high school, she immediately started working and sending money to our parents to help support her younger siblings still living at home. She knew that education would have made her life a lot easier, so she encouraged each of us to pursue it. Our family wanted this money to go to UAM because we believe it would’ve been something she was pleased with.” The donation was contributed to the UAM Fund, which was created in 2020 through a generous private donation to the UAM Foundation. The fund is available for use at the discretion of the chancellor of UAM to provide financial support for the university’s operational expenses, capital projects, equipment needs and academic instruction. Dr. Peggy Doss, chancellor of UAM, offered thanks for the Treadwell family’s contribution, stating, “We would like to express our sincere gratitude to the Treadwell family for their generous donation in memory of Virginia Allen. Ms. Allen had an incredible story; her dedication to providing financial support for her younger siblings and her encouragement to each of them to pursue an education reflected her wisdom in recognizing the opportunities that education creates for people. Generations of students will benefit from this gift to the UAM Fund, and we thank the Treadwell family for this fitting tribute to Ms. Allen’s legacy.”\n\nThe University of Arkansas at Monticello College of Technology-Crossett (UAM-CTC) will hold its commencement exercises for the graduating class of 2024 on Thursday, June 27, at 7 p.m. at the Crossett High School Arena. Doors will open at 5:30 p.m. Over 100 graduates will be recognized with the awarding of technical certificates and Associate of Applied Science degrees in the following programs: Early Childhood Education, Electromechanical Technology, Electromechanical-Instrumentation, General Technology, Health Information Technology, Heating, Ventilation, Air Conditioning and Refrigeration Technology, Hospitality Services, Industrial Technology, Practical Nursing and Welding Technology. Diplomas will also be presented for completers of the UAM Adult Education program who have earned their GEDs. UAM-CTC will also recognize its 2024 Outstanding Alumnus, Zachary Meeks. Meeks graduated from UAM-CTC in 2007 with a technical certificate in Electromechanical Technology and Instrumentation. He has worked maintenance as an E&I with Georgia Pacific, has been a field service engineer, senior field service engineer and service operation leader and is currently a field service manager with Honeywell. For questions regarding commencement or UAM-CTC’s programs of study, contact 870-460-2016.\n\nUAM will continue restoration efforts on two historic properties and begin work on a third project thanks to a $934,269 grant awarded to the university from the Arkansas Natural and Cultural Resources Council (ANCRC). In May, the ANCRC approved the FY2025 grant funding for UAM. The Visual and Performing Arts Center, built in 1954 and previously used as the Student Union on UAM’s Monticello campus, received $855,012 in funding for the first of a two-phase renovation process. The first phase will address exterior renovations, including roof repairs, restoration of stone veneer, concrete elements and steel windows, new rooftop HVAC units and exterior painting. The building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. UAM also received $45,115 for the Trotter House and $34,142 for the 1937 Faculty House. Both projects will enter the final phase of a three-phase renovation. The Trotter House, in Monticello, Arkansas, operates as a bed and breakfast and provides learning opportunities for UAM students in the hospitality program. Built in 1896, the Eastlake-style house was owned by prominent banker V.J. Trotter and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The ANCRC’s grant funds will support the renovation of the interior wood trim. The interior restoration of the 1937 Faculty House, located on UAM’s Monticello campus, will see the replication of the original wallpaper, which will be installed in the living room, first floor hallway and stairwell. The house was built in 1937 and served as faculty housing until 2018. The structure, designed by Little Rock architect A.N. McAninch, is an early example of the Art Moderne style in southeast Arkansas and is largely unchanged from its original construction. It is the last remaining structure from the original faculty village and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Dr. Peggy Doss, chancellor of UAM, stated, “We are extremely grateful to the ANCRC for its continued support of UAM’s historic properties. The Visual and Performing Arts Center, Trotter House and 1937 Faculty House are all on the National Register of Historic Places, and we greatly value the history they represent at UAM. The grant funds provided are essential to support necessary restorations and ensure these buildings continue to play a significant role in the future of the university. This year marks the first grant funds received for the Visual and Performing Arts Center. We are excited to have this building, which is prominently featured on campus, undergo improvements that will create a better space for our music program.”\n\nNational Park College (NPC) and the University of Arkansas at Monticello (UAM) announced a new bachelor’s degree partnership Tuesday. The institutions will collaborate to bring a Bachelor of Science in Nursing degree to Hot Springs beginning in July 2025. All four years of the new bachelor’s degree will be offered on the NPC campus. Students will complete the Associate of Science in Nursing degree enrolled as NPC students and the remainder of the Bachelor of Science in Nursing degree enrolled as UAM students. While completing the associate degree coursework, students will be charged NPC tuition rates. UAM tuition rates will apply for students to finish the Bachelor of Science in Nursing program. Participants will have access to the full range of services and resources provided by both NPC and UAM. Upon completion, students will receive an associate degree diploma from NPC and a bachelor's degree diploma from UAM. All NPC students who apply to UAM will automatically be considered for UAM’s Nighthawk Transfer Scholarship, which offers a $3,000 award per semester for a maximum of four academic terms of continuous enrollment. Students enrolled in the Bachelor of Science in Nursing program at NPC with 55 hours completed at NPC with a minimum of a 2.5 cumulative grade point average will be eligible for the scholarship. Dr. John Hogan, president of NPC, said, “This has been quite a long journey, and I am glad we have found a partner in UAM that will work with us in the spirit of meeting our students’ needs. Health care is the top industry in our community, and nursing is the most significant need of our employers. It has been a frustrating and arduous effort to provide students with this degree option, so I am grateful for the patience of our students, the support our community and UAM’s willingness to stand beside us and take on this important responsibility.” Dr. Peggy Doss, chancellor of UAM, said, “Adding the Bachelor of Science in Nursing program to our campus within a campus partnership with National Park College will effectively address another crucial need in the Arkansas workforce. Ensuring the availability of highly skilled nurses in every part of the state is fundamental to meeting the health care needs of our communities. We are enthusiastic about the opportunity to once again collaborate with NPC, demonstrating the strength of cooperation between two Arkansas higher education institutions. As a result, NPC students will have a pathway to pursue an affordable four-year nursing degree from the University of Arkansas at Monticello, supported by the Nighthawk Transfer Scholarship.”"
