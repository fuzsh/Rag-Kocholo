We can answer this question by saying that Johnny Cash is immortal indeed. However, this is depends on his performance and people who mimic his performance. Johnny Cash made himself a legendary by beliving in himself first and by practicing what he love until he became what he dreamed to be.

Their child now became a singer, songwriter, and author too. His debut was with his mother, June Carter Cash, on her CD in 1999. (J. C. Cash) “He’s just like my father that way-my father just adored my mother and let her do whatever she wanted. John’s like that. He’s a very rare man, a very good man, and I’ve had a good life with him. I’m proud to be walking in the wake of Johnny’s fame.” (Shuang)\n\nWhen Johnny Cash found the light in his life, he decided to survive and be the man that he is.

When Johnny Cash passed away, people felt deeply sad because he was the legendary. Some of Johnny Cash songs were describing an event in his life. Something was good and something was bad. I think Johnny Cash wanted to take something away by singing or writing songs. Some people say he was a sad person all of his life because of his black clothes and sad songs. This is certainly wrong because as I mentioned before that he wear black because he love the color. In summer, he liked to wear blue.
