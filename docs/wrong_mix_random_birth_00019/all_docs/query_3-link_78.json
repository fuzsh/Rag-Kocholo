        "text": "Since 2018, American Idol viewers have tuned in to watch the judging trio of Luke Bryan, Katy Perry, and Lionel Richie. Fans watched for seven seasons as their bond strengthened. However, despite tongue-in-cheek plans to kidnap her, Katy Perry judged her final episode on May 19. The “Roar” singer has pivoted back to her music career for the time being. The online Idol community has feverishly speculated on Perry’s replacement since the GRAMMY nominee announced her departure back in February. Both Luke Bryan and Lionel Richie have weighed in on who they’d like to see take over the “Woman’s World” singer’s chair. Some of these picks are more likely than others, and some are a total long shot.\n\nLionel Richie Has Two Superstars In Mind\n\nLike viewers, Lionel Richie and Luke Bryan are still in the dark about Perry’s replacement. But Richie, 74, has two big names in mind. The “All Night Long” singer has previously revealed that he hopes to see Kelly Clarkson or Taylor Swift join him on set.\n\n“You know what I’m saying, Kelly, we’ve been together a long time,” Richie joked of the first-ever American Idol winner.\n\nHe added, “Kelly, if you don’t have anything else to do, I’d like to drop that out there. Big fan!”\n\nThis scenario is unlikely, as Kelly Clarkson herself has already shut it down. The former Voice coach made a promise to her children that she wouldn’t take on another time-consuming reality gig. Don’t worry, though—the former Commodores singer has a backup plan.\n\n“By the way, Taylor, if you’re available, we’d like to have you out here,” Lionel Richie told Entertainment Tonight. “Call me!”\n\nYes, Richie was referring to perhaps the biggest pop star on the planet, Taylor Swift. And the “Karma” singer does wrap up her billion-dollar “Eras” tour this December. But Swift never rests for long, so it’s likely that future projects would prevent her from joining Idol.\n\nSo Who Will Replace Katy Perry, Then?\n\nA report published by the Online Betting Guide last Thursday (July 11) lists Miley Cyrus as the 6/4 favorite to replace Katy Perry on American Idol. The “Wrecking Ball” singer dethrones Jennifer Lopez, who was listed as the favorite in May but did not appear in the most recent running.\n\n[RELATED: Lionel Richie Tells Katy Perry’s Replacement What They Must Bring to ‘American Idol’]\n\nFellow GRAMMY winners Pink and Meghan Trainor are also in the running, although one certainly seems more keen than the other to join Lionel Richie and Luke Bryan.\n\nFeatured image by John Angelillo/UPI/Shutterstock"
