HGI are smaller and they do have an onsite grill with a pretty decent breakfast available for around $10 to $12. They won't have a convenience store and are usually only about 4 stories tall. Also, if you're a hilton diamond, they have upgraded rooms for you at a normal hilton but at an HGI, they only have limited suites and probably won't give those to you.\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by Didi\n\nI hope that this is the proper forum for my question:\n\nWhat is the difference between a Hilton and a Hilton Garden Inn?\n\nUnfortunatelly, I never stayed in the latter category, and therefore I have no idea what it makes different from a Hilton.\n\nMay 29, 2007, 4:44 am\n\nJoin Date: Aug 2004\n\nLocation: Helsinki, Finland\n\nPrograms: BA Gold\n\nPosts: 660\n\nOnly good till the end of the year...\n\nbut the scandic in oulu is now open, very nice too!\n\nhttp://www.scandic-hotels.com/oulu\n\nThought this should be added to the master list.\n\nCheers\n\nSep 13, 2007, 8:51 pm\n\nFlyerTalk Evangelist\n\nJoin Date: Feb 2002\n\nLocation: El Paso, TX, USA\n\nPrograms: Kicked out of all of them\n\nPosts: 32,554\n\nHere is my review of the Doubletree Holland Michigan\n\nhttp://www.flyertalk.com/forum/showthread.php?t=735922\n\nDec 15, 2007, 5:36 pm\n\nJoin Date: Jul 2006\n\nLocation: York, PA\n\nPrograms: MRSPG LT Tit, HH Diamond, Hertz Pres.\n\nPosts: 1,737\n\nClub Lounges\n\nI have searched and searched pages upon pages.
