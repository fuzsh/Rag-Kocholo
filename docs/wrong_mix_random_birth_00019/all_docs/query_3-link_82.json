        "text": "Katy Perry is looking to start some conversation!\n\nET spoke with the blonde-locked \"Chained to the Rhythm\" singer ahead of her 2017 GRAMMY Awards performance, where her flashy wardrobe seemed so fitting given the global disco ball guerilla rollout of her new single.\n\nNEWS: Every Time Beyonc√© Has Literally Owned the GRAMMYs\n\n\"I actually picked this look before I even thought about the disco ball extravaganza, or disco ball treasure hunt,\" Perry admits, before explaining the promotional stunt for her song. \"I love making people go outside, and I love the interaction. I love launching something in a different way. I've always done that kind of thing.\"\n\nWhether that's any indication of her performance with Skip Marley at the awards show remains to be seen, but Perry did explain that she hopes the show will make a statement.\n\nNEWS: 2017 GRAMMY Awards: All the Nominations\n\n\"[Marley is] an amazing artist. Bob Marley's grandson,\" she said. \"I'm just so excited to bring this song and hopefully start conversations because of it.\"\n\nAs for the blonded-out look, Perry admitted it has more to do with process of elimination than anything else.\n\n\"It's the last color I have yet to do on my head, so that's why I'm here,\" she shared.\n\nNEWS: GRAMMYs 2017 Cheat Sheet: Everything You Need to Know\n\nFair enough!\n\nWatch the video below for more on Perry's new music."
