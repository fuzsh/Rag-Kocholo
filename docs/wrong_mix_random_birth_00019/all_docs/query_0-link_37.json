Much like you, we have also had to make adjustments here on our end to accommodate this change. We have been working around the clock to implement safeguards within our distribution center, and are pleased to say that we are confident in the steps that we have taken to keep our family of staff safe and healthy.\n\nWe ask that you please be patient with us during this unprecedented time, as we work tirelessly to ship all orders just as quickly (and safely) as we can. Delays should be expected for all orders placed. Please rest assured that we are doing everything we can to get your order shipped as quickly as possible. We appreciate your understanding, and will continue to serve you in the best way we can!"
