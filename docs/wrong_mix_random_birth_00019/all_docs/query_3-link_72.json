        "text": "Katy Perry slipped into black leather thigh-high boots on the red carpet at the iHeartRadio Music Awards in Los Angeles on Monday.\n\nThe “American Idol” judge’s boots featured a smooth black leather upper and a slouchy silhouette. The thigh-high style was complete with an elongated pointy toe and skinny stiletto heel that looked to be around 3 to 4 inches in height.\n\nPerry was seen wearing another pair of over-the-knee boots, a white Bottega Veneta style, on her Instagram on March 25. Known for her eclectic shoe style, the “Roar” hitmaker also wore giant Vivienne Westwood platforms at the Billboard Women in Music on March 6. Days later, on March 9, she was spotted stepping out in strappy black Saint Laurent stiletto sandals.\n\nRelated\n\nSince 2014, the iHeartRadio Music Awards has celebrated outstanding achievement in music. The program honors the most-played artists and songs on iHeartRadio stations and the iHeartRadio app. The 2024 honorees include Beyoncé, who will receive the Innovator Award, and Cher, who will receive the 2024 Icon Award. Performers include Justin Timberlake, Green Day, TLC, Jelly Roll, Lainey Wilson and Tate McRae.\n\nWatch on FN\n\nKaty Perry’s Shoe Brand"
