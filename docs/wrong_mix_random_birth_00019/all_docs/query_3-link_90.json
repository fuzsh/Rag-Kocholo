        "text": "What makes a powerful woman? Is it her forthright demeanor? Her compassion? Her ability to inspire and corral large groups? Her eagerness to challenge injustices and usher change? For Diane von Furstenberg, it is all of the above.\n\nLast Thursday at the Brooklyn Museum, the legendary fashion designer hosted her 10th annual DVF Award, a recognition that celebrates the tremendous work of powerful female figures from disparate industries. Past honorees include Ingrid Betancourt, Oprah Winfrey, Hilary Rodham Clinton, Dr. Jane Goodall, Glora Steinman and Sunitha Krishnan. They are all leaders in their respective fields who serve as role models for future generations. This year, five more names were inducted into this illustrious pantheon: Nadia Murad, Hadeel Mustafa Anabtawi, Susan Burton, Katy Perry and Anita F. Hill.\n\n“What all these women are in common is that they have character,” said von Furstenberg after walking to the stage, overlooking a sea of fashionably dressed men and women. “We all know that character is the only thing we have total control of. We could lose our health. We could lose our wealth. We could lose our family; we could lose our freedom. But we never lose our character—even under torture. The women we honor tonight all have had the courage to fight, the strength to survive and the leadership to inspire.”\n\nShe then introduced the night’s first award recipient, Nadia Murad, the 2018 Nobel Peace Price winner who is a leading advocate for survivors of genocide and sexual violence. Murad has been at the forefront of ending such atrocities after she was abducted in 2014, when the Islamic State of Iraq sought to cleanse the country of all Yazidis.\n\nNext to the podium was actress Allison Williams, who eloquently highlighted the many accomplishments of Hadeel Mustafa Anabtawi, the founder of the Alchemist Lab. Through this organization, Anabtawi has initiated educational centers that have taught valuable to over 25,000 children in cities, remote villages and refugee camps.\n\nActress Julia Stiles then walked up to induct Susan Burton, an author and the founder of A New Way of Life Reentry Project. After the accidental death of her young son, Burton fell to drugs and alcohol, which led to 20 years of being in the prison system. She would later recover and bounce back to life, so to speak, with the aim of helping others that have gone through similar experiences. She is also the founder of All of Us or None, the Formerly Incarcerated and Convicted Peoples and Families Movement and also leads the Sisterhood Alliance for Freedom and Equality.\n\nLater came a performance by Chloe and Halle Bailey, two sisters that are tooted for being Beyoncé’s protégés. This was followed by media maven and businesswoman Arianna Huffington, who gushed over Katy Perry’s inspiring song lyrics, her appointment as an UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador and her work with the LGBTQ+ community.\n\n“It’s an honor and privilege to receive an award that’s grounded in uplifting and inspiring women—especially at a time like this, when it’s never been more important,” Perry said after a crowd-pleasing comment about her Spanx rolling up and waxing poetic about von Furstenberg. “As I look around at my fellow honorees—Anita, Hadeel, Susan, Nadia—I think about the remarkable courage you’ve demonstrated; the resilience you have put into practice and, on top of that, the astounding good you continue to do in the world after experiences that would have made other shrink.”\n\nPerry looked humbled and radiant by experience. And though she may have been the biggest celebrity name that evening, she was not the most glamorous. That distinction, according to von Furstenberg, went to Gloria Steinem, the virtual face of the feminist movement who was on hand to present the last award to Anita Hill.\n\nSteinem went on to recount Hill’s many accomplishments, both in the political arena and higher education. She is best known for accusing U.S. Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment. At the time, she received tremendous scrutiny and was seemingly vilified by the Senate Judiciary Committee for speaking out on the matter. But her bravery didn’t go unnoticed by the general public. Her action encouraged other women to file complaints, changing office dynamics forever. As Steinem enthusiastically declared: “The person I am introduction is my favorite word—fan-fucking-tastic.”\n\nThen, when Hill, graced the stage, like all the women before her, she showed no ounce of ego, no whimper of self-aggrandizement. “I really do feel like I’m just getting started,” she said to thunderous applause.”\n\nIndeed, what the event represented most was camaraderie. It showed how when women band together, the sky’s the limit. It showed that power is not a silo, a status achieved by one woman doing what is best for her. To be sure, through their careers and personal interactions, all the honerees at the 2019 DVF Awards proved that tenfold.\n\nFor More, See:\n\nHow Rent the Runway Kids Is Capitalizing On The Growth Of Luxury Childrenswear\n\nChannel Cary Grant's Star Quality With This Sunglass Collection By Oliver Peoples\n\nStaud Steps Forward With A New Shoe Collection"
