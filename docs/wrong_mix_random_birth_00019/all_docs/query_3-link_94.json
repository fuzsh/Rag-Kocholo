Perry, topping the number of Kids' Choice Award nominations by an individual this year, will join host Will Smith and a powerhouse roster of celebrity presenters, including Chris Rock (What to Expect When You're Expecting), Emma Stone (The Amazing Spider-Man), Andrew Garfield (The Amazing Spider-Man), Zac Efron (The Lucky One), Heidi Klum (Project Runway), Victoria Justice (Victorious), Miranda Cosgrove (iCarly), Big Time Rush, Chris Colfer (Glee) and Cee Lo Green (The Voice) as well as recently announced performers, UK pop sensation One Direction.

The special edition Teenage Dream: The Complete Confection will be in stores March 27th and features three new songs, including \"Part Of Me,\" which debuted at #1 on iTunes, with over 400,000 downloads in its first week, after an electrifying performance at this year's Grammy Awards. Perry is nominated for three Kids' Choice Awards this year, including Favorite Female Singer, Favorite Song (\"Firework\") and Favorite Voice in an Animated Movie for her role on The Smurfs.\n\nFans can now vote for their favorite stars on Nick.com and via a Facebook application that will live on the Nickelodeon Facebook page. Users will be able to vote from a tab on the page and, for the first time ever, the entire voting experience can be embedded directly into Facebook wall posts. Also new this year, fans will be able to vote for their favorite nominees on Twitter through the use of custom hash tags.\n\nThis year, kids not only pick the winners, but they get to help host Will Smith pull off the greatest celebratory silver anniversary slime moment. Through a brand-new iPad, iPhone and iPod app, and the KCA website, kids need to find slime hidden throughout the photo galleries, news, and videos. If kids collect enough slime, Will Smith will pull off the biggest slime event ever in this year's show. Aided by weekly mission videos featuring iCarly's Jennette McCurdy, Jerry Trainor, and Nathan Kress, kids will have the chance to earn digital rewards and move up the slime operative ranks.\n\nLeading up to the show, the apps and website will also feature daily KCA news, video updates, photo galleries and videos from past KCAs, behind the scenes video of this year's preparations, and dedicated information pages on the host and nominees.
