        "text": "Music legends Beyonce and Cher have both been honoured with special awards at this year’s iHeartRadio Awards, being held in Los Angeles today.\n\nAnd fellow superstar Taylor Swift is the artist up for the most awards, with nine nominations including Song of the Year and Artist of the Year - which she won, telling fans she has “so many exciting things coming up” in her video acceptance speech.\n\nBut before that was the red carpet – and the biggest surprise among the arrivals has been former Dance Moms child star JoJo Siwa, now 20 and looking all-but-unrecognisable in a KISS homage of a see-through bodysuit:\n\nTo refresh your memory, here’s Siwa just a few short years ago, at the 2018 TV Week Logie Awards:\n\nKaty Perry, looking amazing in shades and a see-through mesh dress:\n\nRapper Ice Spice, swapping out her trademark curls for waist-length hair:\n\nTori Spelling – in the news today after she called her husband on the latest episode of her podcast to tell him she’d filed for divorce:\n\nRapper Latto:\n\nGreedy hitmaker Tate McRae:\n\nControversial couple Amy Robach and TJ Holmes, who now host an iHeartRadio podcast together after leaving their respective spouses for each other when they were US morning TV hosts:\n\nRapper GloRilla:\n\nSinger and dancer Tori Kay in an outfit that’s more cut-outs than actual dress:\n\nActor and rocker Jared Leto:\n\nSinger, actor and talk show host Jennifer Hudson:\n\nAll About That Bass singer Meghan Trainor:\n\nRapper Ludacris, who’s host of today’s ceremony:\n\nDuring the ceremony, Cher was given the Icon Award for her “unparalleled contributions to music and pop culture for over seven decades.” Her old friend and occasional co-star Meryl Streep was on hand to present her with the award.\n\nSinger Jennifer Hudson duetted with Cher, delivering a performance of one of her signature songs, If I Could Turn Back Time.\n\nMeanwhile Beyonce – who released her eighth studio album Cowboy Carter last Friday – skipped the red carpet but appeared on stage to accept the Innovator Award.\n\nMusic legend Stevie Wonder was on hand to present her with her trophy, and Beyonce gave fans a snippet of brand new info about her new album as she accepted the award.\n\n“Thank you for playing the harmonica on Jolene,” she said to Wonder, referencing the Dolly Parton cover on the new record.\n\nIt makes for a rare award show appearance for the super-private star, who shocked fans over the weekend when she made a surprise appearance in a Toyko record store, signing copies of her new album for a handful of lucky fans."
