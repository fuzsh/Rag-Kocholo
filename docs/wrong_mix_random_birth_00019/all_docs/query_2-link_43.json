        "text": "The Glenmede Trust Company was founded in 1956 for one purpose: to serve in perpetuity as Trustee and Administrator of The Pew Memorial Trust, the initial funding source for the nonprofit now known as The Pew Charitable Trusts.\n\nThis was a bold objective and demanded two distinct qualities from the newly established Glenmede Trust Company: an everlasting commitment to fiduciary values and the longevity to fulfill its duties.\n\nOver the decades, we have consistently combined these qualities with purposeful innovation to keep our clients one step ahead in this ever-changing world."
