        "text": "Johnny Cash\n\nSinger, songwriter, guitarist\n\nFor the Record…\n\nSelected discography\n\nWritings\n\nSources\n\nFor more than thirty years the craggy-faced Johnny Cash has been one of America’s most popular country singers. Cash’s appeal has even extended beyond the bounds of country and western music to embrace pop, blues, and folk audiences who often reject the pure country sound. A member of the Country Music Hall of Fame since 1980, Cash is renowned for his combination of rural music traditions—especially gospel and ballads—with innovation and experimentation from a number of contemporary sources.\n\nAdditionally, critics of modern music have noted that Cash’s performances are greatly enhanced by his carefully-crafted stage persona, based on a pastiche of rough-hewn backwoodsmen from a bygone era. In Johnny Cash, writes Henry Pleasants in The Great American Popular Singers, “the artist is the man rather than the art…. The man—the life story, the successes, the humiliations, the disasters, the fascinating juxtaposition of the sinister and the charming, the suggestion of unpredictability—is an attractive figure.”\n\nPleasants also comments that possibly more important “is the figure he seems to represent: the frontier American…. Johnny Cash entered upon the musical scene at a moment in history when America … had grown unsure of itself and its direction. It looked back nostalgically to a time when life was simpler, closer to nature, less tortured by tempo and doubt. Johnny had sprung from a backwater of that earlier environment, and he revived it in song as had no previous singer.” In The Best of the Music Makers, George T. Simon characterizes Cash as “a man of experience and magnetism who, for years, has conveyed to millions the truth and emotion of country music.”\n\nCash was born in Kingsland, Arkansas, February 26, 1932, the fourth of seven children of Ray and Carrie Cash. Although the Great Depression hit hard in Arkansas, it is unfair to describe the Cash family as poverty-stricken. In 1935 they moved to Dyess, Arkansas, where they worked together to grow cotton. Eventually, through hard labor and frugality, they prospered to the extent that they were able to buy the forty-acre farm on which they lived.\n\nJohnny Cash grew up in a charismatic religious environment—he is descended on both sides from Baptist missionaries and preachers—and gospel music was a staple in the home. When he was four his parents bought a battery-powered radio (Dyess had no electricity), and the youngster was exposed to such country music pioneers as the Carter Family, Jimmie Rodgers, and Ernest Tubb. In Stars of Country Music, Frederick E. Danker writes: “For the Cashes, their old hymns and the newer Carter Family versions seemed central to their lives.”\n\nFor the Record…\n\nBorn February 26, 1932, in Kingsland, Ark.; son of Ray (a farmer) and Carrie (Rivers) Cash; married Vivian Liberto, 1954 (divorced, 1966); married June Carter (a singer), March 1, 1968; children: (first marriage) Rosanne, Kathy, Cindy, Tara; (second marriage) John Carter.

Agent—Agency for the Performing Arts, 9000 Sunset Blvd., Suite 1200, Los Angeles, CA 90069.\n\nLate in the 1930s Cash’s brother Roy formed a band, and Johnny vowed he would someday do the same—he had no affection for the long hours and rough work of cotton farming. Cash graduated from Dyess High School in 1950 and worked briefly in a Pontiac, Michigan, auto plant and an Arkansas oleomargarine factory before joining the Air Force for a four-year stint. He was stationed in Germany, and it was there that he learned to play the guitar. He had long written poetry, but in Germany, with the help of some friends, he began turning his verses into songs.\n\nAfter he was discharged in 1954 he married Vivian Liberto and settled in Memphis, where he sold electrical appliances door-to-door. Pleasants suggests that had Cash been a more successful salesman he might never have become a professional entertainer. In 1954 he teamed with two new friends, Marshall Grant and Luther Perkins, to form a small gospel band. They played informally for several months, then Cash’s financial situation impelled him to try to find a recording contract—or at least some profitable gigs.\n\nLuckily, an innovative producer named Sam Phillips was living in Memphis at the time; his Sun record label had introduced Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, Carl Perkins, and Roy Orbison, to name a few. Cash approached Phillips early in 1955 for an audition. He was denied a contract but given some valuable advice, namely to retire his gospel repertoire and work in a commercial vein. Several months later Johnny Cash and the Tennessee Two returned to the Sun studios with new material, and Phillips put them under contract.\n\nSuccess came quickly after that. The band’s first single, “Cry, Cry, Cry,” was a regional hit. The next year, 1956, Cash and the Tennessee Two had a dual country and pop hit with “I Walk the Line,” also recorded on the Sun label. According to Gene Busnar in Superstars of Country Music, Cash’s career “took off. In the years to come he would sell tens of millions of records, host his own prime-time television show, star in movies, and secure a position as one of the true superstars of country music.” Busnar makes another point, however: “Too often fame and fortune can create more problems than they solve. For a long time, Johnny Cash’s success was little more than a heavy cross to bear.”\n\nThat statement may be an exaggeration, but it is certain that drug abuse almost claimed Cash’s life in the mid-1960s. In 1958 he resigned from his regular appearance on Nashville’s Grand Ole Opry—considered the pinnacle of the country music profession—in favor of national touring and mainstream television appearances. The decision was a sound one artistically, but the physical and emotional toll of constant travel was severe. Cash began to take amphetamines and barbiturates; he and his band members pulled pranks and sometimes wound up in scrapes with the law as they moved from show to show across the country.\n\nFor seven years Cash was addicted to dangerous drugs; his first marriage ended in 1966, his voice began to fail, and at one point his weight dropped from 200 to 153 pounds. He was cared for on more than one occasion by June Carter, whose group, the Carter Family, toured with him. Finally, an almost-fatal overdose scared him into a series of rehabilitation programs. He married Carter in 1968 and credited her—and his renewed Christian faith—with his salvation.\n\nIronically, Cash’s struggles with substance abuse had little effect on the quality of his music. Not only was the singer able to keep his band and his backup troupe constant throughout the period, he also managed to make “key achievements in repertory expansion, recording activity, and road-show innovations,” observed Danker. Cash reached beyond the country tradition into folk and blues, performed “message music” about the plight of Native Americans and prison inmates, and recorded songs written by such maverick artists as Kris Kristofferson and Bob Dylan.\n\nBusnar concluded that Cash “achieved a national recognition by the end of the sixties that was unmatched in country music history.” A 1968 live album, At Folsom Prison, afforded Cash his biggest crossover success. As its title suggests, the album was recorded before an audience of prisoners; Danker maintains that the work reveals “the finest troupe and most polished road show” ever mounted in country music. At Folsom Prison propelled Cash to the top of the Country Music Association Awards in 1969. He won “best male vocalist,” “entertainer of the year,” “best single,” “best album,” an “outstanding service” award, and, with Carter, “best vocal group.” From 1969 until 1971 he hosted his own television variety show, and when that was cancelled he returned to touring with Carter and his friend Carl Perkins, who had joined his retinue in 1966.\n\nCash has also written books and starred in films. His 1975 autobiography, Man in Black, sold 250,000 hardcover copies, and his 1986 novel Man in White, about Saint Paul, has been optioned for a movie. Cash’s own movie roles, including “A Gunfight” and “Stagecoach,” capitalize on the same image that he projects in concert, an image People magazine contributor Andrea Chambers described as “scarred … like a strip-mined Appalachian mountainside, … dark and somber, … [with a] deep, rumbling voice that would rather converse with God or the dogwoods than almost anybody else.”\n\nAssessments of Cash’s talent highlight two characteristics of the charismatic “Man in Black.” First, he writes much of his own material, drawing on his own past, his nation’s mythic Western history, social problems, family and romantic love, and religious faith. Danker contends that this highly personal style of writing-performing “continues as one of country music’s distinctive features” through the efforts of artists like Cash.\n\nSecond, Cash’s unusually deep voice and his mix of singing and speaking in his tunes has produced an original—and subsequently much-imitated—style. “With Johnny Cash, as with other country and blues singers, the context is oratorical rather than melodic or harmotic,” writes Pleasants. “The lyric is more important than the tune. Since the singer is working closer to the less precise intonation and inflections of speech, imprecision in the identification and articulation of pitches becomes, if not necessarily a virtue, at least a compatible idiosyncrasy.”\n\nTo put it succinctly, Cash sings with his soul as well as his voice, and the resulting gravelly baritone can sustain the moods of a surprising variety of songs. Now into his third decade as a performer, Cash gives more than seventy-five concerts a year. He still struggles with the seductive dangers of substance abuse but is helped by the concern of his wife, his four daughters, his son, and numerous grandchildren. “I had some bad old days,” Cash told People.”I always remember that God forgives, though, and one of the worst things you can do is not to forgive yourself.”\n\nSelected discography\n\nJohnny Cash with His Hot and Blue Guitar, Sun, 1957.\n\nThe Fabulous Johnny Cash, Columbia, 1958.\n\nRide This Train, Columbia, 1960.\n\nBlood, Sweat, and Tears, Columbia, 1963.\n\nRing of Fire, Columbia, 1963.\n\nI Walk the Line, Columbia, 1964.\n\nBitter Tears: Ballads of the American Indian, Columbia, 1964.\n\nOrange Blossom Special, Columbia, 1965.\n\nBallads of the True West, Columbia, 1965.\n\nMean As Hell, Columbia, 1966.\n\nEverybody Loves a Nut, Columbia, 1966.\n\nGreatest Hits: Volume I, Columbia, 1967.\n\nCarrying on with June Carter, Columbia, 1967.\n\nFrom Sea to Shining Sea, Columbia, 1968.\n\nAt Folsom Prison, Columbia, 1968.\n\nOld Golden Throat, Columbia, 1968.\n\nHoly Land, Columbia, 1969.\n\nAt San Quentin, Columbia, 1969.\n\nJohnny Cash, Harmony, 1969.\n\nOriginal Golden Hits: Volume I and II, Sun, 1969.\n\nShow Time with the Tennessee Two, Sun, 1970.\n\nStory Songs of Trains and Rivers with the Tennessee Two, Sun, 1970.\n\nHello, I’m Johnny Cash, Columbia, 1970.\n\nThe World of Johnny Cash, Columbia, 1970.\n\nSinging Storyteller with the Tennessee Two, Sun, 1970.\n\n(With June Carter) Jackson, Columbia, 1970.\n\nLiving Legend, Sun, 1970.\n\nLittle Fauss and Big Halsy, Columbia, 1970.\n\nGet Rhythm, Sun, 1970.\n\nThe Johnny Cash Show, Epic, 1970.\n\nRough Cut King of Country Music, Sun, 1970.\n\nSunday Down South with Jerry Lee Lewis, Sun, 1970.\n\nShow, Columbia, 1971.\n\nJohnny Cash: The Man, the World, His Music, Sun, 1971.\n\nMan in Black, Columbia, 1971.\n\n(With Jerry Lee Lewis) Johnny Cash Sings Hank Williams, Sun, 1971.\n\nCollections: Great Hits Volume II, Columbia, 1971.\n\nOriginal Golden Hits Volume III, Sun, 1972.\n\nA Thing Called Love, Columbia, 1972.\n\nFolsom Prison Blues, Columbia, 1972.\n\n(With Carter) Give My Love to Rose, Harmony, 1972.\n\nAmerica, Columbia, 1972.\n\nJohnny Cash Songbook, Harmony, 1972.\n\nAny Old Wind That Blows, Columbia, 1973.\n\nI Walk the Line, Nash, 1973.\n\n(With Carter) Johnny Cash and His Woman, Columbia, 1973.\n\nRagged Old Flag, Columbia, 1974.\n\nJunkie and Juicehead, Columbia, 1974.\n\nJohnny Cash Sings Precious Memories, Columbia, 1975.\n\nJohn R.

He has also reached a substantial audience of rock fans, thanks to his outlaw persona, deep, authoritative voice, and dark songs like “Folsom Prison Blues.” After enjoying a string of hits in the 1950s and even greater success in the late 1960s, when he was briefly the best-selling recording artist in the world, he saw his edgy, close-to-the-bone style go out of fashion. Even as his 1980s work was neglected, however, he appeared before adoring throngs worldwide. In 1994, well past his sixtieth birthday, he came roaring back with a sparsely recorded album that ranked among his best work and earned him a Grammy Award. “Can you name anyone in this day and age who is as cool as Johnny Cash?” asked Rolling Stone rhetorically. “No, you can’t.”\n\nJ. R. Cash was born into an impoverished Arkansas family in 1932 and grew up working in the cotton fields. His Baptist upbringing meant that the music he heard was almost entirely religious, and the hymns sung by\n\nFor the Record…\n\nBorn J. R.

Record company —American Recordings, 3500 West Olive, Burbank, CA 91505.\n\ncountry greats like the Carter Family and Ernest Tubb reached him on the radio and made an indelible impression. “From the time I was a little boy,” he recollected to Steve Pond in a 1992 Rolling Stone interview, “I never had any doubt that I was gonna be singing on the radio.” His brother Roy formed a band when he was young, increasing John’s determination to do the same one day.\n\nCash had no idea, though, what path would lead him to his destiny. He held a few odd jobs after graduating from Dyess High School in 1950, but eventually opted for a four-year stay in the Air Force. Stationed in Germany, he endured what he would later describe as a lonely, miserable period. Fortunately, he learned to play the guitar and began turning the poetry he’d been writing into song lyrics. After seeing a powerful film about Folsom Prison, he sat down to write what would become one of his signature songs—“Folsom Prison Blues.” His empathy for prisoners and other marginalized people would consistently inform his work. With his powerful position in a generally conservative musical world, he also championed Native American rights and other social ills.\n\nCash left the military in 1954 and married Vivian Liberto, whom he met before joining the air force; they had corresponded throughout his tour of duty. The two lived in Memphis, Tennessee, and he earned a meager living selling appliances. “I was the worst salesman in the world,” Cash confided to Pond. Nonetheless, he summoned the passion to sell himself as a singer, playing with a gospel group and canvassing radio stations for chances to perform on the air.\n\nWent to Sun\n\nEventually Cash was granted an audience with trailblaz-ing producer Sam Phillips, at whose Sun Studios the likes of Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, Carl Perkins, and others made recordings that would help change the course of popular music. Phillips was a hard sell, but Cash won the opportunity to record his first single; “Cry, Cry, Cry” became a number 14 hit in 1955, and Cash’s group played some local gigs with Presley. Pond describes Cash’s early records as “stark, unsettling and totally original. The instrumentation was spare, almost rudimentary” featuring bass and lead guitar supplied by his Tennessee Two and Cash’s rhythm guitar, which had “a piece of paper stuck underneath the top frets to give it a scratchy sound.”\n\nIn 1956 Cash left his sales job and recorded the hits “Folsom Prison Blues” —containing the legendary and much-quoted lyric “I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die”—and “I Walk the Line.” The next year saw the release of the one album released by Sun before his departure from the label, Johnny Cash With His Hot & Blue Guitar. He and the Tennessee Two left the label after a string of hits and signed with CBS/Columbia Records in 1958. Singles he recorded on Sun at Phil-lips’s insistence just before his contract lapsed continued to chart for years afterward, much to Cash’s chagrin. Yet he charted on CBS as well with a bevy of singles and such albums as Blood, Sweat and Tears and Ring of Fire.\n\nIn the midst of his success, however, Cash grew apart from Vivian and their children. He grew dependent on drink and drugs and became increasingly dissolute. Such misery no doubt contributed force to such work as 1963’s “Ring of Fire,” which was cowritten by June Carter, who also performed on the track. Cash and Carter—of the famed Carter family—became increasingly close, both professionally and personally. His marriage collapsed in 1966 and he nearly died of an overdose. Cash has long attributed his subsequent rehabilitation to two factors: Carter and God. He and Carter wed in 1968 and later had a son, John.\n\nIn any event, Cash expanded his repertoire as the 1960s unfolded, incorporating folk music and protest themes. He recorded songs by folk-rock avatar Bob Dylan and up-and-comers like Kris Kristofferson, but by the end of the decade, driven perhaps by his generally out-of-control life, his hits came largely from novelty songs like Shel Silverstein’s “A Boy Named Sue.” Even so, by 1969 Cash was the best-selling recording artist alive, outselling even rock legends The Beatles. That year saw him win two Grammy Awards for Johnny Cash at Folsom Prison, a live album for a worshipful audience of prisoners that led, perhaps inevitably, to Johnny Cash at San Quentin. From 1969 to 1971 he hosted a smash variety program for television, The Johnny Cash Show.\n\nThe 1970s saw more career triumphs, notably a Grammy-winning duet with Carter on Tim Hardin’s “If I Were a Carpenter,” a command performance for President Richard Nixon, acting roles in film and on television, a best-selling autobiography, and several more hit albums, including Man in Black, the title of which would become his permanent show business moniker. While this label has been associated with his “outlaw” image, he and his bandmates originally wore black because they had nothing else that matched; besides, as Cash informed Entertainment Weekly, “black is better for church.”\n\nInducted into Country Music Association Hall of Fame\n\nIn 1980 Cash was inducted into the Country Music Association Hall of Fame. He had become a music hero worldwide, appearing in eastern Europe before the fall of the Soviet empire and praising those who agitated for democracy. Yet during the 1980s, Cash became less and less of a priority for his record label; country music had come to be dominated by younger, pop-inclined artists who favored slick production. He continued to struggle with drugs, eventually checking into the Betty Ford clinic. There, he has said, he experienced a religious epiphany.\n\nCash wrote a novel, Man in White, about the life of the apostle Paul, and continued indulging his eclectic musical tastes, recording songs by mavericks like Elvis Costello. Alongside Kristofferson, Willie Nelson, and Waylon Jennings, he participated in a collaborative album, The Highwayman; he also joined Jerry Lee Lewis, Carl Perkins, and country-rock giant Roy Orbi-son for a reunion recording called Class of ’55 (Memphis Rock & Roll Homecoming), which enjoyed solid sales. A daughter by his first marriage, Rosanne, became a country star in her own right; Johnny Cash, himself, even as his albums sold poorly, was firmly established as a living legend of country music and a profound influence on rock and roll. In 1992 he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and 1993 saw him contribute a vocal performance to Zooropa, by rock superstars U2.\n\nYet Cash tired of record-business priorities. “I kept hearing about demographics [market studies of consumers] until it was coming out my ears,” the singer told Christopher John Farley of Newsweek. The first label representative who seemed to understand him after this bitter experience was, ironically enough, best known for his work with hardcore rap, metal, and alternative acts. Rick Rubin had founded his own label, first called Def American and later changed to American Recordings, to support acts he believed in. Though not intimately acquainted with his work, he admired the Cash’s artistic persona. “I don’t see him as a country act,” Rubin told Farley. “I would say he embodiesrock‘n’roll. He’sanoutlaw figure, and that is the essence of what rock ‘n’ roll is.”\n\nRubin’s appeal to Cash lay in his idea for a record. After seeing one of the country legend’s performances, the producer “said he’d love to hear just me and my guitar,” Cash told Los Angeles Times writer Robert Hilburn. These were the words the veteran artist had waited decades to hear; he had suggested such a minimal approach many times to country producers, only to have it vetoed immediately on commercial grounds. Rubin simply set up a tape machine in his Hollywood living room and allowed Cash to do what he does best.\n\nRubin “was a lot like Sam [Phillips], actually,” Cash ventured to Hilburn. “We talked a lot about the approach we were going to take, and he said, ‘You know, we are not going to think about time or money. I want you to come out as much as you can.” Without such constraints—which had clipped Cash’s wings in his Nashville years—he was free to experiment with a wide range of material. Recording over 70 songs, mostly at Rubin’s house but also at his own cabin in Tennessee and at the trendy Los Angeles nightspot The Viper Room, Cash had a valedictory experience. He later told Time’s Farley that the work was his “dream album.”\n\nThe material was culled to 13 tracks, including traditional songs, some Cash originals, and compositions by such diverse modern songwriters as Kristofferson, Leonard Cohen, Tom Waits, Nick Lowe, Glenn Danzig, and Loudon Wainright III. The leadoff track, “Delia’s Gone,” grimly describes the murder of a faithless woman; Rubin seemed to invite comparisons between Cash and the controversial metal and rap acts on his label. Titled American Recordings, the album was released in 1994; Johnny Cash was 62 years old. The liner notes contained testimonials from both Rubin and Cash. “I think we made a brutally honest record,” the producer declared. “Working with Rick,” Cash averred, “all the experimenting, kinda spread me out and expanded my range of material. This is the best I can do as an artist, as a solo artist, this is it.”\n\nAmerican Recordings Wins A Grammy\n\nCritics seemed to agree. Karen Schoemer of Mirabella praised it as “a daring, deceptively simple album” that “operates on a mythic scale, which suits someone who’s always been larger than life. What is breathtaking is Cash’s ability to analyze his aging self, and the failures, weaknesses, strengths and wisdoms that time bestows.” Village Voice critic Doug Simmons praised it as “fiercely intimate,” while Rolling Stone’s Anthony DeCurtis called it “unquestionably one of his best albums,” one which “will earn him a time of well-deserved distinction in which his work will reach an eager new audience.”\n\nWhile American Recordings didn’t take the charts by storm, it restored Johnny Cash’s sense of mission. It also earned him a 1995 Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album. He played a sold-out engagement in Los Angeles just before his nomination, before an audience studded with such music stars as Tom Petty, Sheryl Crow, and Dwight Yoakam.\n\nAbout the prospect of an “eager new audience” Cash himself—who seriously considered playing at the alternative-rock festival known as Lollapalooza before declining the offer—was philosophical. “I nolongerhavea grandiose attitude about my music being a powerful force for change,” he told Entertainment Weekly. Even so, he allowed, “I think [today’s youth] sees the hypocrisy in government, the rotten core of social ills and poverty and prejudice, and I’m not afraid to say that’s where the trouble is. A lot of people my age are.” One thing remained constant, as he told Rolling Stone: “I feel like if I can just go onstage with my guitar and sing my songs, I can’t do no wrong no matter where I am.”\n\nSelected discography\n\nOn Columbia, unless otherwise noted\n\nJohnny Cash with His Hot and Blue Guitar, Sun, 1957.\n\nThe Fabulous Johnny Cash, 1958.\n\nRide This Train, 1960.\n\nBlood, Sweat and Tears, 1963.\n\nRing of Fire, 1963.\n\nI Walk the Line, 1964.\n\nBitter Tears: Ballads of the American Indian, 1964.\n\nOrange Blossom Special, 1965.\n\nBallads of the True West, 1965.\n\nMean As Hell, 1966.\n\nEverybody Loves a Nut, 1966.\n\nHappiness is You, 1966.\n\nJohnny Cash’s Greatest Hits, 1967.\n\nJohnny Cash at Folsom Prison (includes “Folsom Prison Blues”), 1968.\n\nThe Holy Land, 1969.\n\nJohnny Cash at San Quentin, 1969.\n\nJohnny Cash, Harmony, 1969.\n\nOriginal Golden Hits: Volume I and II, Sun, 1969.\n\nShow Time with the Tennessee Two, Sun, 1970.\n\nStory Songs of Trains and Rivers with the Tennessee Two, Sun, 1970.\n\nHello, I’m Johnny Cash, 1970.\n\nThe World of Johnny Cash, 1970.\n\nSinging Storyteller with the Tennessee Two, Sun, 1970.\n\n(With June Carter) Jackson, 1970.\n\nLiving Legend, Sun, 1970.\n\nLittle Fauss and Big Halsy, 1970.\n\nGet Rhythm, Sun, 1970.\n\nThe Johnny Cash Show, Epic, 1970.\n\nRough Cut King of Country Music, Sun, 1970.\n\nShow, 1971.\n\nJohnny Cash: The Man, the World, His Music, Sun, 1971.\n\nMan in Black, 1971.\n\n(With Jerry Lee Lewis) Johnny Cash Sings Hank Williams, Sun, 1971.\n\nCollections: Great Hits Volume II, 1971.\n\nOriginal Golden Hits Volume III, Sun, 1972.\n\nA Thing Called Love, Columbia, 1972.\n\nFolsom Prison Blues, Columbia, 1972.\n\n(With Carter) Give My Love to Rose, Harmony, 1972.\n\nAmerica, 1972.\n\nJohnny Cash Songbook, Harmony, 1972.\n\nAny Old Wind That Blows, Columbia, 1973.\n\nI Walk the Line, Nash, 1973.\n\n(With Carter) Johnny Cash and His Woman, 1973.\n\nRagged Old Flag, 1974.\n\nJunkie and Juicehead, 1974.\n\nJohnny Cash Sings Precious Memories, 1975.\n\nJohn R.

He also reached a substantial audience of rock fans, thanks to his charismatic outlaw persona, deep, authoritative voice, and dark songs like \"Folsom Prison Blues.\" After enjoying a string of hits in the 1950s and even greater success in the late 1960s, when he was briefly the bestselling recording artist in the world, Cash saw his edgy, close-to-the-bone style eventually go out of fashion. Even as his 1980s work was neglected, however, he retained a strong and loyal fan base worldwide. In 1994, well past his sixtieth birthday, Cash came roaring back with a sparsely recorded album that ranked among his best work and earned him a Grammy award. \"Can you name anyone in this day and age who is as cool as Johnny Cash?\" asked a writer for Rolling Stone rhetorically. \"No, you can't.\"\n\nCash was born into an impoverished Arkansas family in 1932 and grew up working in the cotton fields. His Baptist upbringing meant that the music he heard was almost entirely religious, and the hymns sung by country greats like the Carter Family and Ernest Tubb reached him on the radio and made an indelible impression. \"From the time I was a little boy,\" he recollected to Steve Pond in a Rolling Stone interview, \"I never had any doubt that I was gonna be singing on the radio.\" His brother Roy formed a band when he was young, increasing Johnny's determination to do the same one day.\n\nCash had no idea, though, what path would lead him to his destiny. He held a few odd jobs after graduating from Dyess High School in 1950, but eventually opted for a four-year stay in the U.S. Air Force. Stationed in Germany, he endured what he would later describe as a lonely, miserable period. Fortunately, he learned to play the guitar and began turning the poetry he had been writing into song lyrics. After viewing a powerful film about Folsom Prison, he sat down to write what would become one of his signature songs, \"Folsom Prison Blues.\" Cash's empathy for prisoners and other marginalized people would consistently inform his work. With his powerful position in a generally conservative musical world, he also championed Native American rights and spoke out against various social ills.\n\nCash left the military in 1954 and married Vivian Liberto, whom he had met before joining the Air Force; they had corresponded throughout his tour of duty. The two lived in Memphis, Tennessee,\n\nwhere Cash earned a meager living selling appliances. \"I was the worst salesman in the world,\" he confided to Pond. Nonetheless, he summoned the passion to sell himself as a singer, playing with a gospel group and canvassing radio stations for chances to perform on the air.\n\nMakes First Recording\n\nEventually, Cash was granted an audience with trailblazing producer Sam Phillips, at whose Sun Studios the likes of Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, Carl Perkins, and others made recordings that changed the course of popular music. Phillips was a hard sell, but Cash won the opportunity to record his first single, and \"Cry, Cry, Cry\" became a number 14 hit in 1955. Cash's group, the Tennessee Two, also played some local gigs with Presley. Pond describes Cash's early records as \"stark, unsettling and totally original. The instrumentation was spare, almost rudimentary,\" featuring bass and lead guitar supplied by the Tennessee Two and Cash's rhythm guitar, which had \"a piece of paper stuck underneath the top frets to give it a scratchy sound.\"\n\nIn 1956 Cash left his sales job and recorded the hits \"Folsom Prison Blues\"—containing the legendary and much-quoted lyric \"I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die\"—and \"I Walk the Line.\" The next year saw the release of the one album released by Sun before Cash's departure from the label, Johnny Cash with His Hot and Blue Guitar. Cash and the Tennessee Two left the label after a string of hits and signed with CBS/Columbia Records in 1958; interestingly, singles he recorded on Sun at Phillips's insistence just before his contract lapsed continued to chart for years afterward, much to Cash's chagrin. Yet he charted on CBS as well with a bevy of singles and such albums as Blood, Sweat, and Tears and Ring of Fire.\n\nTurns to God\n\nIn the midst of his success, however, Cash grew apart from Vivian and their children. He also grew dependent on alcohol and drugs, and his on-the-road lifestyle became increasingly dissolute. Such misery no doubt contributed force to such work as 1963's \"Ring of Fire,\" which was co-written by musician June Carter, who also performed on the track. Cash and Carter, a scion of the famed musical Carter Family—became increasingly close, both professionally and personally. By 1966 Cash's marriage had collapsed, and that year he nearly died of an overdose. Cash attributed his subsequent rehabilitation to two factors: Carter and God. He and Carter wed in 1968 and later had a son, John.\n\nCash expanded his repertoire as the 1960s unfolded, incorporating folk music and protest themes. He recorded songs by folk-rock singer Bob Dylan and up-and-comers like Kris Kristofferson, but by the end of the decade, driven perhaps by his generally out-of-control lifestyle, his hits came largely from novelty songs like Shel Silverstein's \"A Boy Named Sue.\" Even so, by 1969 Cash was the best-selling recording artist alive, outselling even rock legends the Beatles. That year saw him win two Grammy awards for Johnny Cash at Folsom Prison, a live album for a worshipful audience of prisoners that led to Johnny Cash at San Quentin. From 1969 to 1971 he hosted a smash variety program for television, The Johnny Cash Show.\n\nThe 1970s saw more career triumphs, notably a Grammy-winning duet with wife June Carter Cash on Tim Hardin's song \"If I Were a Carpenter,\" a command performance for President Richard M. Nixon, acting roles in film and on television, a bestselling autobiography, and several more hit albums, including Man in Black, the title of which had become his permanent show-business moniker. While this label has been associated with his \"outlaw\" image, Cash and his bandmates originally wore black because they had nothing else that matched; besides, as Cash informed a writer for Entertainment Weekly, \"black is better for church.\"\n\nIn Cash's 1975 autobiography, also titled Man in Black, he describes his years of fighting an addiction to drugs. He began to take amphetamines—\"uppers\"—to stay awake for the grueling tours and to provide a constant supply of energy for his concerts, and barbiturates—\"downers\"—to fall asleep afterward. Addicted for seven years, Cash saw his health deteriorate; he became violent, depressed, and suicidal. In 1967 he woke up in a jail cell in Lafayette, Georgia, and admitted he was addicted. With the help of his strong Christian faith, his doctor, and his soon to be bride June Carter, Cash successfully completed his withdrawal from drug dependency. Throughout the book Cash stresses \"the religious aspects of his life,\" wrote a Library Journal reviewer, and he credits his ultimate salvation to his faith in Jesus Christ. According to a Publishers Weekly reviewer, Cash's account is a brutally honest version \"that goes further in personal disclosure than anything written about him thus far.\" The book met with critical and popular success, selling over 250,000 hardcover copies.\n\nIn 1980 Cash was inducted into the Country Music Association Hall of Fame. He had become a music hero worldwide, appearing in eastern Europe before the fall of the Soviet empire and praising those who agitated for democracy. Yet during the 1980s, Cash became less and less of a priority for his record label; country music had come to be dominated by younger artists who were either pop-inclined or \"roots\" artists who favored more sophisticated production. These troubles led Cash to again struggle with drugs; he eventually checked into the Betty Ford clinic for rehabilitation. There, he said, he experienced a religious epiphany.\n\nA Book about St. Paul\n\nCash's second book, Man in White, draws upon his personal struggle with drugs and is the result of almost ten years of research and writing. The manuscript—carried from city to city in saddlebags, and worked on in buses and hotel rooms—was written in longhand on yellow legal pads. It is the story of the biblical Saul of Tarsus, the Jewish Pharisee, who, in approximately 37 A.D., converted to Christianity after an encounter with \"the man in white,\" or Jesus, on the Damascus road. In the book, Cash fictionalizes the three-year span of Saul's anti-Christian zealotry prior to his conversion, and the three-year interval afterward, during which Saul changed his name to Paul, built up relationships with the apostles, and prepared for the first of his numerous missionary journeys. Cash acknowledged that he was inspired to write the book because Paul's transforming experience so closely paralleled his own. After more than seven years of drug addiction and violence, Cash's rehabilitation was \"like a new birth, a new lease on life,\" he was quoted as saying by William Griffin in a Publishers Weekly interview. \"My mind was renewed … I was transformed, and I identified with Paul the apostle.\"\n\nMany reviewers praised Man in White for its characterization and historical authenticity, and the novel was even optioned for a movie. John Lawson, a School Library Journal critic, wrote that \"this well-researched novel breathes life into Paul,\" the disciples, and the high priest, making \"the characters and times come alive.\" Rene H. Engel commented in the Los Angeles Times Book Review that, although Cash's music is the best descriptor of his personality, \"if the reader considers Cash's powerful identification with Paul, then the Man in White, together with [Cash's] autobiography, does give us some insight into the convictions of the man in black.\"\n\nDuring the 1980s Cash continued to indulge his eclectic musical tastes. Alongside Kristofferson, Willie Nelson, and Waylon Jennings, he participated in a collaborative album, The Highwaymen, which was followed by two other albums by the team. He also joined Jerry Lee Lewis, Carl Perkins, and country-rock giant Roy Orbison for a reunion recording called Class of '55 (Memphis Rock & Roll Homecoming), which enjoyed solid sales. A daughter by his first marriage, Rosanne, became a country star in her own right; Johnny Cash himself, even as his solo albums sold poorly, was firmly established as a living legend of country music and a profound influence on rock and roll. In 1992 he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nYet Cash tired of record-business priorities. \"I kept hearing about demographics [market studies of consumers] until it was coming out my ears,\" the singer told Christopher John Farley of Time. The first label representative who seemed to understand Cash after this bitter experience was, ironically enough, a man best known for his work with hardcore rap, metal, and alternative acts. Rick Rubin had founded\n\nhis own label, first called Def American and later changed to American Recordings, to support acts he believed in. Though not intimately acquainted with Cash's work, Rubin admired the singer's artistic persona. \"I don't see him as a country act,\" Rubin told Farley. \"I would say he embodies rock 'n' roll. He's an outlaw figure, and that is the essence of what rock 'n' roll is.\"\n\nRubin's appeal, to Cash, lay in the producer's idea for a record. After seeing one of the country legend's performances, Rubin \"said he'd love to hear just me and my guitar,\" Cash told Los Angeles Times writer Robert Hilburn. These were the words the veteran artist had waited decades to hear; he had suggested such a minimal approach many times to country producers, only to have it vetoed immediately on commercial grounds. Rubin simply set up a tape machine in his Hollywood living room and allowed Cash to play guitar and sing.\n\nRubin \"was a lot like Sam [Phillips], actually,\" Cash told Hilburn. \"We talked a lot about the approach we were going to take, and he said, 'You know, we are not going to think about time or money. I want you to come out as much as you can.'\" Freed from the constraints that had clipped Cash's wings in his Nashville years, he was able to experiment with a wide range of material. Recording over seventy songs, mostly at Rubin's house but also at his own cabin in Tennessee and at the trendy Los Angeles nightspot The Viper Room, Cash had a valedictory experience. He later told Time's Farley that the work was his \"dream album.\"\n\nFirst Release on American Recordings\n\nThe recorded material was culled to thirteen tracks, including traditional songs, some Cash originals, and compositions by such diverse modern song-writers as Kristofferson, Leonard Cohen, Tom Waits, Nick Lowe, Glenn Danzig, and Loudon Wainright III. The lead-off track, \"Delia's Gone,\" grimly describes the murder of a faithless woman; Rubin seemed to invite comparisons between Cash and the controversial metal and rap acts on his label. Titled American Recordings, the album was released in 1994; its artist was sixty two years old. The liner notes contained testimonials from both Rubin and Cash. \"I think we made a brutally honest record,\" the producer declared. \"Working with Rick,\" Cash averred, \"all the experimenting, kinda spread me out and expanded my range of material. This is the best I can do as an artist, as a solo artist, this is it.\"\n\nCritics seemed to agree. Karen Schoemer of Mirabella praised American Recordings as \"a daring, deceptively simple album\" that \"operates on a mythic\n\nscale, which suits someone who's always been larger than life. What is breathtaking is Cash's ability to analyze his aging self, and the failures, weaknesses, strengths and wisdoms that time bestows.\" Village Voice critic Doug Simmons praised it as \"fiercely intimate,\" while Rolling Stone's Anthony DeCurtis called it \"unquestionably one of his best albums,\" one which \"will earn him a time of well-deserved distinction in which his work will reach an eager new audience.\"\n\nWhile American Recordings sold only modestly well, it restored Cash's sense of mission. It also earned him a 1995 Grammy Award for best contemporary folk album. He played a sold-out engagement in Los Angeles just before his nomination, before an audience studded with such music stars as Tom Petty, Sheryl Crow, and Dwight Yoakam. And in September of 1996 he played a set at the CMA Music Marathon in Manhattan, previewing songs from a new album, Unchained, as well as performing cover versions from younger artists such as Beck and Soundgarden.\n\nIn later years, health problems caused Cash to limit his touring schedule. He began to suffer from Shy-Drager's syndrome, a degenerative nerve disease that can cause blackouts, tremors, and muscle stiffness and made him prone to pneumonia. He was hospitalized with pneumonia twice in 1998 and again in October 1999. Yet, as the 1990s waned and the millennium turned over, Cash—now approaching the end of his seventh decade—returned to the recording studio and issued American III: Solitary Man in 2000; the title track from that album won a Grammy for best male country vocal performance. Also in 2000 he compiled a three-disc retrospective boxed set called Love, God, Murder, one of more than one hundred Cash retrospective packages compiled since the 1950s. Indeed, 1999 alone saw the release of nearly two dozen Cash collections, and that year he was honored also with the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award from the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences.\n\nConnects with Younger Generation\n\nAbout the prospect of an \"eager new audience\" Cash himself—who seriously considered playing at the alternative-rock festival known as Lollapalooza before declining the offer—was philosophical. \"I no longer have a grandiose attitude about my music being a powerful force for change,\" he told a contributor to Entertainment Weekly. Even so, he allowed, \"I think [today's youth] sees the hypocrisy in government, the rotten core of social ills and poverty and prejudice, and I'm not afraid to say that's where the trouble is. A lot of people my age are.\" One thing remained constant, as he told Rolling Stone: \"I feel like if I can just go onstage with my guitar and sing my songs, I can't do no wrong no matter where I am.\"\n\nIf you enjoy the works of Johnny Cash\n\nIf you enjoy the works of Johnny Cash, you may also want to check out the following recordings:\n\nWaylon Jennings, Singer of Sad Songs, 1970.\n\nWillie Nelson, Red Headed Stranger, 1975.\n\nMerle Haggard, If I Could Only Fly, 2000.\n\nCash continued to reach this new audience with a fourth effort in the American Recordings series, American IV: The Man Comes Around. Once again, the legendary country singer delved into the works of younger artists like Depeche Mode's \"Personal Jesus\" and Nine Inch Nails' \"Hurt.\" The latter song also became a popular video, launching the song onto the Modern Rock Tracks chart. The video, directed by Mark Romanek, earned six nominations at the 2003 MTV Awards, and won in the best cinematography category. American IV: The Man Comes Around rose to number two on the Top Country Albums chart and was certified gold in 2003.\n\nCash's success, however, was mingled with continued health problems and personal tragedy. June Carter Cash, his wife of thirty-five years, died of complications following heart surgery on May 15, 2003. \"After June died,\" friend Kris Kristofferson told a People contributor, \"life was a struggle for him. His daughter told me he cried every night.\" Cash was eager to attend the MTV Awards in August of 2003, but had been re-admitted to the hospital due to complications from diabetes. On September 12, 2003, almost four months after the death of his wife, Cash died. A memorial service, held at Hendersonville, North Carolina, on September 15, 2003, was attended by friends, family, and his musical peers. \"He stood up for the underdogs, the downtrodden, the prisoners, the poor, and he was their champion,\" Kristofferson told People. \"He appealed to people all over the world.\"\n\nBiographical and Critical Sources\n\nbooks\n\nCampbell, Garth, Johnny Cash: He Walked the Line, John Blake, 2004.\n\nCash, Johnny, Man in Black: His Own Story in His Own Words, Zondervan (Grand Rapids, MI), 1975.\n\nCash, Johnny, and Patrick Carr, Cash: The Autobiography, HarperSanFrancisco (San Francisco, CA), 1997.\n\nCash, Johnny, Ring of Fire: The Johnny Cash Reader (interviews), edited by Michael Streissguth, Da Capo Press (New York, NY), 2002.\n\nContemporary Musicians, Volume 46, Gale (Detroit, MI), 2004.\n\nCusic, Don, Johnny Cash: The Songs, Thunder's Mouth Press, 2004.\n\nLewry, Peter, I've Been Everywhere: A Johnny Cash Chronicle, Helter Skelter Publishing, 2001.\n\nMcCall, Michael, and Nicholas Maier, Johnny Cash: An American Legend, AMI Books, 2003.\n\nMiller, Bill, Cash: An American Man, CMT, 2004.\n\nMoriarty, Frank, Johnny Cash, MetroBooks (New York, NY), 2000.\n\nStreissguth, Michael, Johnny Cash at Folsom Prison: The Making of a Masterpiece, Da Capo Press (New York, NY), 2004.\n\nTurner, Steve, The Man Called Cash: The Life, Love, and Faith of an American Legend, W Publishing Group, 2004.\n\nUrbanski, Dave, The Man Comes Around: The Spiritual Journey of Johnny Cash, Relevant Books, 2003.\n\nperiodicals\n\nBillboard, March 30, 2002, Wes Orshoski, \"Johnny Cash: An American Original,\" p. 1.\n\nBooklist, October 1, 1997, Mike Tribby, review of Cash: The Autobiography, p. 274.\n\nEntertainment Weekly, February 18, 1994, pp. 57-67.\n\nKirkus Reviews, July 15, 1986, p. 1039.\n\nLibrary Journal, November 1, 1975, review of Man in Black, p. 2042; June 1, 2002, Eric Hahn, review of Ring of Fire: The Johnny Cash Reader, p. 154.\n\nLos Angeles Times, April 28, 1984; April 25, 1994, Robert Hilburn, pp. F1, F5.\n\nLos Angeles Times Book Review, September 12, 1986, Rene H.

He has also reached a substantial audience of rock fans, thanks to his outlaw persona, deep, authoritative voice, and dark songs like \"Folsom Prison Blues.\" After enjoying a string of hits in the 1950s and even greater success in the late 1960s, when he was briefly the best-selling recording artist in the world, he saw his edgy, close-to-the-bone style go out of fashion. Even as his 1980s work was neglected, however, he appeared before adoring throngs worldwide. In 1994, well past his sixtieth birthday, he came roaring back with a sparsely recorded album, American Recordings, that ranked among his best work and earned him a Grammy Award. \"Can you name anyone in this day and age who is as cool as Johnny Cash?\" asked Rolling Stone rhetorically. \"No, you can't.\"\n\nJohn R. Cash was born into an impoverished Arkansas family in 1932 and grew up working in the cotton fields. His Baptist upbringing meant that the music he heard was almost entirely religious, and the hymns sung by country greats like the Carter Family and Ernest Tubb reached him on the radio and made an indelible impression. \"From the time I was a little boy,\" he recollected to Steve Pond in a 1992 Rolling Stone interview, \"I never had any doubt that I was gonna be singing on the radio.\" His brother Roy formed a band when he was young, increasing John's determination to do the same one day.\n\nCash had no idea, though, what path would lead him to his destiny. He held a few odd jobs after graduating from Dyess High School in 1950, but eventually opted for a four-year stay in the Air Force. Stationed in Germany, he endured what he would later describe as a lonely, miserable period. Fortunately, he learned to play the guitar and began turning the poetry he'd been writing into song lyrics. After seeing a powerful film about Folsom Prison, he sat down to write what would become one of his signature songs—\"Folsom Prison Blues.\" His empathy for prisoners and other marginalized people would consistently inform his work. With his powerful position in a generally conservative musical world, he also championed Native American rights and other social ills.\n\nCash left the military in 1954 and married Vivian Liberto, whom he met before joining the Air Force; they had corresponded throughout his tour of duty. The two lived in Memphis, Tennessee, and he earned a meager living selling appliances. \"I was the worst salesman in the world,\" Cash confided to Pond. Nonetheless, he summoned the passion to sell himself as a singer, playing with a gospel group and canvassing radio stations for chances to perform on the air.\n\nMade First Recording\n\nEventually Cash was granted an audience with trail-blazing producer Sam Phillips, at whose Sun Studios the likes of Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, Carl Perkins, and others made recordings that would help change the course of popular music. Phillips was a hard sell, but Cash won the opportunity to record his first single; \"Cry, Cry, Cry\" became a number 14 hit in 1955, and Cash's group played some local gigs with Presley. Pond describes Cash's early records as \"stark, unsettling and totally original. The instrumentation was spare, almost rudimentary,\" featuring bass and lead guitar supplied by his Tennessee Two and Cash's rhythm guitar, which had \"a piece of paper stuck underneath the top frets to give it a scratchy sound.\"\n\nIn 1956 Cash left his sales job and recorded the hits \"Folsom Prison Blues\"—containing the legendary and much-quoted lyric \"I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die\"—and \"I Walk the Line.\" The next year saw the release of the one album released by Sun before his departure from the label, Johnny Cash With His Hot & Blue Guitar. He and the Tennessee Two left the label after a string of hits and signed with CBS/Columbia Records in 1958. Singles he recorded on Sun at Phillips's insistence just before his contract lapsed continued to chart for years afterward, much to Cash's chagrin. Yet he charted on CBS as well with a bevy of singles and such albums as Blood, Sweat and Tears and Ring of Fire.\n\nRehabilitation\n\nIn the midst of his success, however, Cash grew apart from Vivian and their children. He grew dependent on drink and drugs and became increasingly dissolute. Such misery no doubt contributed force to such work as 1963's \"Ring of Fire,\" which was cowritten by June Carter, who also performed on the track. Cash and Carter—of the famed Carter family—became increasingly close, both professionally and personally. His marriage collapsed in 1966 and he nearly died of an overdose. Cash has long attributed his subsequent rehabilitation to two factors: Carter and God. He and Carter wed in 1968 and later had a son, John.\n\nFor the Record . . .\n\nBorn John R. Cash on February 26, 1932, in Kingsland, AR; died on September 12, 2003, in Nashville, TN; son of Ray (a farmer) and Carrie (Rivers) Cash; married Vivian Liberto, 1954 (divorced, 1966); married June Carter (a singer-songwriter), 1968; children: (first marriage) Rosanne, Kathy, Cindy, Tara; (second marriage) John Carter.\n\nWorked in auto assembly plant and margarine factory, 1949-50; recorded debut single \"Hey Porter\"/\"Cry, Cry, Cry\" for Sun Records, 1955; released debut album Johnny Cash with His Hot & Blue Guitar, 1957; signed with Columbia Records and released Ride This Train, 1960; hosted television program The Johnny Cash Show, 1969-71; wrote autobiography Man in Black and novel Man in White ; signed with Mercury Records and released Johnny Cash Is Coming to Town, 1987; signed to American Recordings and released American Recordings, 1994; released Unchained, 1996; issued box set, Love, God, Murder, 2000; recorded American IV: The Man Comes Around, 2002.\n\nAwards: Grammy Awards: (with June Carter) Best Country and Western Performance Duet, 1967; Best Album Notes, 1968; Best Country Vocal Performance, Male, 1968; Best Country Vocal Performance, Male, 1969; Best Album Notes, 1969; (with June Carter) Best Country Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group, 1970; (with Carl Perkins, Jerry Lee Lewis, Roy Orbison, Sam Phillips, Rick Nelson, and Chips Moman) Best Spoken Word or Non-Musical Recording, 1986; Best Contemporary Folk Album, 1994; (with Rick Rubin) Best Country Album, 1997; Best Male Country Vocal Performance, 2000; Best Male Country Vocal Performance, 2002; Best Short Form Music Video, 2003; Country Music Association Awards, Album of the Year, 1968; Single of the Year, 1969; Album of the Year, 1969; (with June Carter-Cash) Vocal Group of the Year, 1969; Male Vocalist of the Year, 1969; Entertainer of the Year, 1969; Single of the Year, 2003; Album of the Year, 2003; Music Video of the Year, 2003; inducted into Country Music Hall of Fame, 1980; inducted into Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, 1992; Songwriters Guild of America, Aggie Award (highest honor), 1989; National Medal of Honor, 2001.\n\nIn any event, Cash expanded his repertoire as the 1960s unfolded, incorporating folk music and protest themes. He recorded songs by folk-rock avatar Bob Dylan and up-and-comers like Kris Kristofferson, but by the end of the decade, driven perhaps by his generally out-of-control life, his hits came largely from novelty songs like Shel Silverstein's \"A Boy Named Sue.\" Even so, by 1969 Cash was the best-selling recording artist alive, outselling even rock legends The Beatles. That year saw him win two Grammy Awards for Johnny Cash at Folsom Prison, a live album for a worshipful audience of prisoners that led, perhaps inevitably, to Johnny Cash at San Quentin. From 1969 to 1971 he hosted a smash variety program for television, The Johnny Cash Show.\n\nThe 1970s saw more career triumphs, notably a Grammy-winning duet with Carter on Tim Hardin's \"If I Were a Carpenter,\" a command performance for President Richard Nixon, acting roles in film and on television, a best-selling autobiography, and several more hit albums, including Man in Black, the title of which would become his permanent show business moniker. While this label has been associated with his \"outlaw\" image, he and his bandmates originally wore black because they had nothing else that matched; besides, as Cash informed Entertainment Weekly, \"black is better for church.\"\n\nIn 1980 Cash was inducted into the Country Music Association Hall of Fame. He had become a music hero worldwide, appearing in eastern Europe before the fall of the Soviet empire and praising those who agitated for democracy. Yet during the 1980s, Cash became less and less of a priority for his record label; country music had come to be dominated by younger, pop-inclined artists who favored slick production. He continued to struggle with drugs, eventually checking into the Betty Ford clinic. There, he has said, he experienced a religious epiphany.\n\nNew Fame Through Collaborations\n\nCash wrote a novel, Man in White, about the life of the apostle Paul, and continued indulging his eclectic musical tastes, recording songs by mavericks like Elvis Costello. Alongside Kristofferson, Willie Nelson, and Waylon Jennings, he participated in a collaborative album, The Highwayman. He also joined Jerry Lee Lewis, Carl Perkins, and country-rock giant Roy Orbison for a reunion recording called Class of '55 (Memphis Rock & Roll Homecoming), which enjoyed solid sales. A daughter by his first marriage, Rosanne, became a country star in her own right; Johnny Cash, himself, even as his albums sold poorly, was firmly established as a living legend of country music and a profound influence on rock and roll. In 1992 he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and 1993 saw him contribute a vocal performance to Zooropa, by rock superstars U2.\n\nYet Cash tired of record-business priorities. \"I kept hearing about demographics [market studies of consumers] until it was coming out my ears,\" the singer told Christopher John Farley of Newsweek. The first label representative who seemed to understand him after this bitter experience was, ironically enough, best known for his work with hardcore rap, metal, and alternative acts. Rick Rubin had founded his own label, first called Def American and later changed to American Recordings, to support acts he believed in. Though not intimately acquainted with his work, he admired the Cash's artistic persona. \"I don't see him as a country act,\" Rubin told Farley. \"I would say he embodies rock 'n' roll. He's an outlaw figure, and that is the essence of what rock 'n' roll is.\"\n\nRubin's appeal to Cash lay in his idea for a record. After seeing one of the country legend's performances, the producer \"said he'd love to hear just me and my guitar,\" Cash told Los Angeles Times writer Robert Hilburn. These were the words the veteran artist had waited decades to hear; he had suggested such a minimal approach many times to country producers, only to have it vetoed immediately on commercial grounds. Rubin simply set up a tape machine in his Hollywood living room and allowed Cash to do what he does best.\n\nRubin \"was a lot like Sam [Phillips], actually,\" Cash ventured to Hilburn. \"We talked a lot about the approach we were going to take, and he said, 'You know, we are not going to think about time or money. I want you to come out as much as you can.\" Without such constraints—which had clipped Cash's wings in his Nashville years—he was free to experiment with a wide range of material. Recording over 70 songs, mostly at Rubin's house but also at his own cabin in Tennessee and at the trendy Los Angeles nightspot The Viper Room, Cash had a valedictory experience. He later told Time 's Farley that the work was his \"dream album.\"\n\nFirst American Recording\n\nThe material was culled to 13 tracks, including traditional songs, some Cash originals, and compositions by such diverse modern songwriters as Kristofferson, Leonard Cohen, Tom Waits, Nick Lowe, Glenn Danzig, and Loudon Wainright III. The leadoff track, \"Delia's Gone,\" grimly describes the murder of a faithless woman; Rubin seemed to invite comparisons between Cash and the controversial metal and rap acts on his label. Titled American Recordings, the album was released in 1994; Johnny Cash was 62 years old. The liner notes contained testimonials from both Rubin and Cash. \"I think we made a brutally honest record,\" the producer declared. \"Working with Rick,\" Cash averred, \"all the experimenting, kinda spread me out and expanded my range of material. This is the best I can do as an artist, as a solo artist, this is it.\"\n\nCritics seemed to agree. Karen Schoemer of Mirabella praised it as \"a daring, deceptively simple album\" that \"operates on a mythic scale, which suits someone who's always been larger than life. What is breathtaking is Cash's ability to analyze his aging self, and the failures, weaknesses, strengths and wisdoms that time bestows.\" Village Voice critic Doug Simmons praised it as \"fiercely intimate,\" while Rolling Stone 's Anthony DeCurtis called it \"unquestionably one of his best albums,\" one which \"will earn him a time of well-deserved distinction in which his work will reach an eager new audience.\"\n\nWhile American Recordings didn't take the charts by storm, it restored Johnny Cash's sense of mission. It also earned him a 1995 Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album. He played a sold-out engagement in Los Angeles just before his nomination, before an audience studded with such music stars as Tom Petty, Sheryl Crow, and Dwight Yoakam. And in September of 1996 he played a set at the CMJ Music Marathon in Manhattan, previewing songs from a new album, Unchained, as well as performing cover versions from younger artists such as Beck and Soundgarden.\n\nIn later years, health problems caused Cash to limit his touring schedule. He suffered from Shy-Drager's Syndrome, a degenerative nerve disease that can cause blackouts, tremors, muscle stiffness, and made him prone to pneumonia. He was hospitalized with pneumonia twice in 1998 and again in October 1999. Yet, as the 1990s waned and the millennium turned over, Cash—approaching the end of his seventh decade—returned to the recording studio and issued American III: Solitary Man in 2000; the title track from that album won a Grammy for Best Male Country Vocal Performance. Also in 2000 he compiled a three-disc retrospective boxed set, called Love, God, Murder. It was one of more than 100 retrospective packages that had been compiled since the 1950s. Indeed, 1999 alone saw the release of nearly two dozen Cash collections, and that year he was honored also with a lifetime achievement Grammy Award from the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences.\n\nConnected With a Younger Generation\n\nAbout the prospect of an \"eager new audience\" Cash himself—who seriously considered playing at the alternative-rock festival known as Lollapalooza before declining the offer—was philosophical. \"I no longer have a grandiose attitude about my music being a powerful force for change,\" he told Entertainment Weekly. Even so, he allowed, \"I think [today's youth] sees the hypocrisy in government, the rotten core of social ills and poverty and prejudice, and I'm not afraid to say that's where the trouble is. A lot of people my age are.\" One thing remained constant, as he told Rolling Stone : \"I feel like if I can just go onstage with my guitar and sing my songs, I can't do no wrong no matter where I am.\"\n\nCash continued to reach this new audience with a fourth effort in the American Recordings series, American IV: The Man Comes Around. Once again, the legendary country singer delved into the works of younger artists like Depeche Mode's \"Personal Jesus\" and the Nine Inch Nails' \"Hurt.\" The latter song also became a popular video, launching the song onto the Modern Rock Tracks chart. The video, directed by Mark Romanek, earned six nominations at the 2003 Music Television (MTV) Awards, and won in the best cinematography category. American IV: The Man Comes Around rose to number two on the Top Country Albums chart and was certified gold in 2003.\n\nCash's success, however, was mingled with continued health problems and personal tragedy. June Carter Cash, his wife of 35 years, died of complications following heart surgery on May 15, 2003. \"After June died,\" friend Kris Kristofferson told People, \"life was a struggle for him. His daughter told me he cried every night.\" Cash was eager to attend the MTV Awards in August, but had been re-admitted to the hospital due to complications from diabetes. On September 12, 2003, almost four months after the death of his wife, Cash died. A memorial service, held at Hendersonville, North Carolina on September 15, 2003, was attended by friends, family, and his musical peers. \"He stood up for the underdogs, the downtrodden, the prisoners, the poor, and he was their champion,\" Kristofferson told People. \"He appealed to people all over the world.\"\n\nSelected discography\n\nJohnny Cash with His Hot and Blue Guitar, Sun, 1957.\n\nThe Fabulous Johnny Cash, Columbia, 1958.\n\nBlood, Sweat and Tears, Columbia, 1963.\n\nRing of Fire, Columbia, 1963.\n\nI Walk the Line, Columbia, 1964.\n\nBitter Tears: Ballads of the American Indian, Columbia, 1964.\n\nOrange Blossom Special, Columbia, 1965.\n\nMean As Hell, Columbia, 1966.\n\nJohnny Cash at Folsom Prison, Columbia, 1968.\n\nThe Holy Land, Columbia, 1969.\n\nJohnny Cash at San Quentin, Columbia, 1969.\n\nShow Time with the Tennessee Two, Sun, 1970.\n\nStory Songs of Trains and Rivers with the Tennessee Two, Sun, 1970.\n\nHello, I'm Johnny Cash, Columbia, 1970.\n\nThe World of Johnny Cash, Columbia, 1970.\n\nSinging Storyteller with the Tennessee Two, Sun, 1970.\n\n(With June Carter) Jackson, Columbia, 1970.\n\nRough Cut King of Country Music, Sun, 1970.\n\nMan in Black, Columbia, 1971.\n\n(With Jerry Lee Lewis) Johnny Cash Sings Hank Williams, Sun, 1971.\n\nA Thing Called Love, Columbia, 1972.\n\nFolsom Prison Blues, Columbia, 1972.\n\n(With Carter)Give My Love to Rose, Harmony, 1972.\n\nAmerica, Columbia, 1972.\n\nAny Old Wind That Blows, Columbia, 1973.\n\nI Walk the Line, Nash, 1973.\n\n(With Carter) Johnny Cash and His Woman, Columbia, 1973.\n\nRagged Old Flag, Columbia, 1974.\n\nJunkie and Juicehead, Columbia, 1974.\n\nJohn R.

Nonetheless, he summoned the passion to sell himself as a singer, playing with a gospel group and canvassing radio stations for chances to perform on the air.\n\nPlays with Presley\n\nEventually Cash was granted an audience with trail-blazing producer Sam Phillips, at whose Sun Studios the likes of Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, Carl Perkins, and others made recordings that would help change the course of popular music. Phillips was a hard sell, but Cash won the opportunity to record his first single; \"Cry, Cry, Cry\" became a number 14 hit in 1955, and Cash's group played some local gigs with Presley. Pond describes Cash's early records as \"stark, unsettling and totally original. The instrumentation was spare, almost rudimentary\" featuring bass and lead guitar supplied by his Tennessee Two and Cash's rhythm guitar, which had \"a piece of paper stuck underneath the top frets to give it a scratchy sound.\"\n\nIn 1956 Cash left his sales job and recorded the hits \"Folsom Prison Blues\"—containing the legendary and much-quoted lyric \"I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die\"—and \"I Walk the Line.\" The next year saw the release of the one album released by Sun before his departure from the label, Johnny Cash With His Hot & Blue Guitar. He and the Tennessee Two left the label after a string of hits and signed with CBS/Columbia Records in 1958. Singles he recorded on Sun at Phillips's insistence just before his contract lapsed continued to chart for years afterward, much to Cash's chagrin. Yet he charted on CBS as well with a bevy of singles and such albums as Blood, Sweat and Tears and Ring of Fire.\n\nIn the midst of his success, however, Cash grew apart from Vivian and their children. He grew dependent on drink and drugs and became increasingly dissolute. Such misery no doubt contributed force to such work as 1963's \"Ring of Fire,\" which was co-written by June Carter, who also performed on the track. Cash and Carter—of the famed Carter family—became increasingly close, both professionally and personally. His marriage collapsed in 1966 and he nearly died of an overdose. Cash has long attributed his subsequent rehabilitation to two factors: Carter and God. He and Carter wed in 1968 and later had a son, John.\n\nCash Sells\n\nIn any event, Cash expanded his repertoire as the 1960s unfolded, incorporating folk music and protest themes. He recorded songs by folk-rock avatar Bob Dylan and up-and-comers like Kris Kristofferson, but by the end of the decade, driven perhaps by his generally out-of-control life, his hits came largely from novelty songs like Shel Silverstein's \"A Boy Named Sue.\" Even so, by 1969 Cash was the best-selling recording artist alive, outselling even rock legends The Beatles. That year saw him win two Grammy Awards for Johnny Cash at Folsom Prison, a live album for a worshipful audience of prisoners that led, perhaps inevitably, to Johnny Cash at San Quentin. From 1969 to 1971 he hosted a smash variety program for television, The Johnny Cash Show.\n\nThe 1970s saw more career triumphs, notably a Grammy-winning duet with Carter on Tim Hardin's \"If I Were a Carpenter,\" a command performance for President Richard Nixon, acting roles in film and on television, a best-selling autobiography, and several more hit albums, including Man in Black, the title of which would become his permanent show business moniker. While this label has been associated with his \"outlaw\" image, he and his bandmates originally wore black because they had nothing else that matched; besides, as Cash informed Entertainment Weekly, \"black is better for church.\"\n\nIn 1980 Cash was inducted into the Country Music Association Hall of Fame. He had become a music hero worldwide, appearing in eastern Europe before the fall of the Soviet empire and praising those who agitated for democracy. Yet during the 1980s, Cash became less and less of a priority for his record label; country music had come to be dominated by younger, pop-inclined artists who favored slick production. He continued to struggle with drugs, eventually checking into the Betty Ford clinic. There, he has said, he experienced a religious epiphany.\n\nCash wrote a novel, Man in White, about the life of the apostle Paul, and continued indulging his eclectic musical tastes, recording songs by mavericks like Elvis Costello. Alongside Kristofferson, Willie Nelson, and Waylon Jennings, he participated in a collaborative album, The Highwayman; he also joined Jerry Lee Lewis, Carl Perkins, and country-rock giant Roy Orbison for a reunion recording called Class of '55 (Memphis Rock & Roll Homecoming), which enjoyed solid sales. A daughter by his first marriage, Rosanne, became a country star in her own right; Johnny Cash, himself, even as his albums sold poorly, was firmly established as a living legend of country music and a profound influence on rock and roll. In 1992 he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and 1993 saw him contribute a vocal performance to Zooropa, by rock superstars U2.\n\nYet Cash tired of record-business priorities. \"I kept hearing about demographics [market studies of consumers] until it was coming out my ears,\" the singer told Christopher John Farley of Newsweek. The first label representative who seemed to understand him after this bitter experience was, ironically enough, best known for his work with hardcore rap, metal, and alternative acts. Rick Rubin had founded his own label, first called Def American and later changed to American Recordings, to support acts he believed in. Though not intimately acquainted with Cash's work, he admired the singer's artistic persona. \"I don't see him as a country act,\" Rubin told Farley. \"I would say he embodies rock 'n' roll. He's an outlaw figure, and that is the essence of what rock 'n' roll is.\"\n\nRubin's appeal to Cash lay in his idea for a record. After seeing one of the country legend's performances, the producer \"said he'd love to hear just me and my guitar,\" Cash told Los Angeles Times writer Robert Hilburn. These were the words the veteran artist had waited decades to hear; he had suggested such a minimal approach many times to country producers, only to have it vetoed immediately on commercial grounds. Rubin simply set up a tape machine in his Hollywood living room and allowed Cash to do what he does best.\n\nRubin \"was a lot like Sam [Phillips], actually,\" Cash ventured to Hilburn. \"We talked a lot about the approach we were going to take, and he said, 'You know, we are not going to think about time or money. I want you to come out as much as you can.\" Without such constraints—which had clipped Cash's wings in his Nashville years—he was free to experiment with a wide range of material. Recording over 70 songs, mostly at Rubin's house but also at his own cabin in Tennessee and at the trendy Los Angeles nightspot The Viper Room, Cash had a valedictory experience. He later told Time' s Farley that the work was his \"dream album.\"\n\nThe material was culled to 13 tracks, including traditional songs, some Cash originals, and compositions by such diverse modern songwriters as Kristofferson, Leonard Cohen, Tom Waits, Nick Lowe, Glenn Danzig, and Loudon Wainright III. The leadoff track, \"Delia's Gone,\" grimly describes the murder of a faithless woman; Rubin seemed to invite comparisons between Cash and the controversial metal and rap acts on his label. Titled American Recordings, the album was released in 1994; Johnny Cash was 62 years old. The liner notes contained testimonials from both Rubin and Cash. \"I think we made a brutally honest record,\" the producer declared. \"Working with Rick,\" Cash averred, \"all the experimenting, kinda spread me out and expanded my range of material. This is the best I can do as an artist, as a solo artist, this is it.\"\n\nCritics seemed to agree. Karen Schoemer of Mirabella praised it as \"a daring, deceptively simple album\" that \"operates on a mythic scale, which suits someone who's always been larger than life. What is breathtaking is Cash's ability to analyze his aging self, and the failures, weaknesses, strengths and wisdoms that time bestows.\" Village Voice critic Doug Simmons praised it as \"fiercely intimate,\" while Rolling Stone's Anthony DeCurtis called it \"unquestionably one of his best albums,\" one which \"will earn him a time of well-deserved distinction in which his work will reach an eager new audience.\"\n\nWhile American Recordings didn't take the charts by storm, it restored Johnny Cash's sense of mission. It also earned him a 1995 Grammy Award for best contemporary folk album. He played a sold-out engagement in Los Angeles just before his nomination, before an audience studded with such music stars as Tom Petty, Sheryl Crow, and Dwight Yoakam. And in September of 1996 he played a set at the CMJ Music Marathon in Manhattan, previewing songs from his album Unchained as well as performing cover versions from younger artists such as Beck and Soundgarden.\n\nAbout the prospect of an \"eager new audience\" Cash himself—who seriously considered playing at the alternative-rock festival known as Lollapalooza before declining the offer—was philosophical. \"I no longer have a grandiose attitude about my music being a powerful force for change,\" he told Entertainment Weekly. Even so, he allowed, \"I think [today's youth] sees the hypocrisy in government, the rotten core of social ills and poverty and prejudice, and I'm not afraid to say that's where the trouble is. A lot of people my age are.\" One thing remained constant, as he told Rolling Stone: \"I feel like if I can just go onstage with my guitar and sing my songs, I can't do no wrong no matter where I am.\"\n\nFurther Reading\n\nRees, Dafydd, and Luke Crampton, Rock Movers & Shakers, Billboard, 1991.\n\nEntertainment Weekly, February 18, 1994, pp. 57-67.\n\nHits, May 2, 1994.\n\nLos Angeles Times, April 25, 1994, pp. F1, F5.\n\nMirabella, July 1994.\n\nPeople, May 16, 1994.\n\nRolling Stone, December 10, 1992, pp. 118-25, 201; May 5, 1994, p. 14; May 19, 1994, pp. 97-98; June 30, 1994, p. 35.\n\nTime, May 9, 1994, pp. 72-74.\n\nVillage Voice, May 18, 1994. □\n\nCash, Johnny\n\ndeep-voiced country singer; b. Kingsland, Ark., Feb. 26, 1932. Johnny Cash grew up in Dyess, Ark., where he had moved at the age of three. Following his discharge from the Air Force in July 1954, he traveled to Memphis and eventually auditioned for Sam Phillips of Sun Records in March 1955. Signed to Sun, Cash managed pop hits with his own “I Walk the Line,” “Ballad of a Teenage Queen,” “Guess Things Happen That Way,” and “The Ways of a Woman in Love.” In 1957 W. S. Holland joined his backup band, becoming one of the first drummers in country music. In August 1958 Johnny Cash switched to Columbia Records and soon hit with “Don’t Take Your Guns to Town.” Moving to Calif., Cash started working with June Carter, of the legendary Carter Family, in 1961. He began feeling the strain of constant touring and the collapse of his first marriage and grieved the death of friend Johnny Horton. As a consequence, Cash started taking amphetamines and tranquilizers to cope with his hectic life.\n\nIn 1963 Johnny Cash scored his first major pop hit on Columbia with “Ring of Fire.” He soon began hanging out on the periphery of the Greenwich Village folk music scene, and his next hit, “Understand Your Man,” had a distinctive folk feel to it. In 1964 he appeared with Bob Dylan at the Newport Folk Festival. During this time, Cash recorded a number of folk songs, including Peter LaFarge’s “Ballad of Ira Hayes” and Dylan’s “Don’t Think Twice, It’s Alright,” and, with June Carter, “It Ain’t Me, Babe,” another country and pop hit.\n\nDespite increasing popular success, Johnny Cash’s life seemed to deteriorate. In October 1965 he was arrested at El Paso International Airport in possession of hundreds of stimulants and tranquilizers. After being found near death in a small Ga. town in 1967, Cash decided to reform. With June Carter providing moral support, he cleaned up his act. The couple scored a smash country hit with “Jackson” in 1968, the year they married. In 1970, they hit the pop charts with Tim Hardin’s “If I Were a Carpenter.”\n\nJohnny Cash began a series of successful TV appearances in 1967, and his 1968 Johnny Cash at Folsom Prison remained on the album charts for more than two years and revitalized his career. The album yielded a top country hit and moderate pop hit with “Folsom Prison Blues.” In early 1969 Cash scored another top country and moderate pop hit with Carl Perkins’s “Daddy Sang Bass.” Cash’s penchant for novelty songs culminated in his biggest pop hit, “A Boy Named Sue,” from Johnny Cash at San Quentin, another best-seller. The 1969 debut show for his ABC network TV series featured a film of Cash and Bob Dylan recording “Girl from the North Country.” The song later appeared on Dylan’s first country album, Nashville Skyline. Later shows featured artists such as Gordon Lightfoot, Kris Kristofferson, Waylon Jennings, and Joni Mitchell. During the 1969 Newport Folk Festival, Johnny Cash introduced Kris Kristofferson, later recording his “Sunday Morning Coming Down” and bolstering his early career.\n\nJohnny Cash again demonstrated his social consciousness in the early 1970s with the hits “What is Truth” and “Man in Black.” He also narrated and co-produced the soundtrack to the Christian epic Gospel Road and assisted in the production of The Trail of Tears, a dramatization of the tragedy of the Cherokee Indians, broadcast on public television (PBS). Cash scored another pop novelty hit with “One Piece at a Time” in 1976 and hit the country charts in 1978 with “There Ain’t No Good Chain Gangs,” recorded with Waylon Jennings. His last major country hit came in 1981 with “The Baron.” Future country star Marty Stuart was a member of Cash’s band from 1979 to 1985.\n\nIn 1985 Johnny Cash joined Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson, and Kris Kristofferson to tour and record as the Highwaymen. They hit the top of the country charts with Jimmy Webb’s “The Highwayman.” The following year, Cash reunited with old Sun Records alumni Carl Perkins, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Roy Orbison for Class of ’55, contributing “I Will Rock & Roll with You.” Cash was dropped from the Columbia Records roster in 1986 and he subsequently signed with Mercury Records, switching to American Records in 1993. In 1990 he joined Jennings, Nelson, and Kristofferson as the Highwaymen for another album and round of touring. Cash sang “The Wanderer” with U2, included on their Zooropa album. In 1994 he recorded the moody, acoustic American Recordings album for American Records under producer Rick Rubin, best known for his work with Run-D.M.C, Public Enemy, and the Red Hot Chili Peppers. The following year, Cash once again joined the Highwaymen, to tour and record for Liberty Records The Road Goes on Forever. However, he retired from active performing in 1997, after announcing he was suffering from a degenerative nerve disease. Helping to broaden the scope of country-and-western music and popularize country music with rock and pop fans, Johnny Cash became the first international country star and may have done more to popularize country music than anyone since Hank Williams. Indeed, his TV series (1969–71) was instrumental in widening the audience for country music. Additionally, he was instrumental in introducing Bob Dylan and Kris Kristofferson to broader public acceptance. Johnny Cash was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992.\n\nWritings\n\nMan in Black (Grand Rapids, Mich., 1975); Man in White: A Novel (San Francisco, 1986); with Patrick Carr, Cash: The Autobiography (San Francisco, 1997).\n\nDiscography\n\nThe Fabulous Johnny Cash (1958); Hymns b"
