        "text": "“The goddess energy in this room is undeniable,” Katy Perry said as she stood at the podium Thursday night, accepting The Inspiration DVF Award for her work with UNICEF, LGBTQ advocacy, and other philanthropic causes. And it was a very celebratory, highly spirited evening: the 10th Annual DVF Awards, held this year for the first time at the Brooklyn Museum. In addition to Perry, four other women, including Anita Hill, were honored for their achievements in effecting change in their communities and the world.\n\nPerry—whose award was presented by Arianna Huffington—received the most applause during her speech when she noted toward the end that “intersectional feminism is the only kind of feminism.” She also shared a lesson from her years in the public eye: “Great change begins with yourself. You cannot help heal others without also being on a healing journey yourself.”\n\nShe said on stage that, at the beginning of her career, she used to “shy away somewhat from the idea of being a role model” as her “understanding of that responsibility was an assumption that I needed to be perfect in order to do so.” She has since learned that “perfection is the endgame, and I have failed and I most definitely will fall short, but I will continue to be brave enough to take chances to strive for better outcomes.”\n\nBefore the ceremony, Perry—wearing a pair of violet statement earrings and a matching printed dress—said, at first, she was surprised when Diane von Furstenberg initially reached out to her. Perry said, ”I’m really honored to be in this company because I was like, ‘Okay, I’m just a pop star, and here’s, like, Anita Hill and all these other ladies. I’m like, ‘I haven’t . . . yet changed laws yet.’ I’m not there yet. But my main purpose is hopefully that everybody can feel connected and feel community and feel seen and safe and celebrated.”\n\nHaving just talked about her mother on the red carpet, Perry was visibly emotional, wiping away a remaining tear (“My lashes are gonna fall off,” she joked). She called von Furstenberg “magnetic and iconic,” and said that she was immediately on board when she learned the premise was around “women continuing to uplift each other and say, ‘Hey, we’re on the same team and you're not alone, and let’s fight this one together.’” Perry said, “I think sometimes women feel really alone, even with other women. So I just wanted to be here to shine a light and to, I guess, be inspiring . . . that’s what they’re calling me tonight! And to be inspired. I’m here to learn as well.”\n\nGloria Steinem presented Hill with The Lifetime Leadership DVF Award, which concluded the programming, following the other awards presentations (Nadia Murad, Susan Burton, and Hadeel Mustafa Anabtawi were also honored) and a performance by Chloe x Halle. Hill delivered a rousing speech, in which she spoke at length about what she went through in 1991 during the Clarence Thomas hearings, and how “no one would have predicted 28 years ago that I would still be here.” She added, “The due process is designed to make women like myself disappear.” She implored everyone in the room: “When the government fails, I want you to commit to standing with the women who need to be heard, deserve to be heard, and have the right to be heard.”\n\nSteinem said before the ceremony that Hill’s bravery in 1991 is what created the groundwork for the #MeToo movement of the past several years. “I, like the rest of the country, saw her first on television when she was called upon to testify and told the truth and was not supported by the Judiciary Committee as she should have been, and there were other witnesses who could have come forward to say similar things about Clarence Thomas, but they did not call those witnesses,” she said. “So, I saw her bravery and her dignity and her truth-telling and now it’s taken a while; she should have been believed and supported then. But now her truth-telling was the first big consciousness-raising, and it started a whole process that, now, we see is the majority process with #MeToo around the world.”\n\nJoe Biden, who has been criticized for the way he oversaw the Thomas hearing, has recently said he has “regret” about the situation. He also issued an apology, recorded on video, last week after being accused of inappropriate touching by multiple women, pledging to change his behavior.\n\nSteinem said before the ceremony, “It’s clear that [Biden] recognizes that he made a mistake when he did not call the other witnesses who could have supported her testimony, and he has apologized for that, and that’s important.” As for the crowded field of potential Democratic candidates for the 2020 presidential race, Steinem said she will champion whoever comes out on top. “I’m glad there are all these candidates, and I think we’ll have to see who can communicate with the most authenticity and the issues that are clearly majority issues. But the important thing to me is that we stop saying, ‘What are they doing?’ and say, ‘What are we doing?’ because whoever, any one of those candidates, I would work my heart out.”\n\nOther attendees Thursday evening included Allison Williams, Julia Stiles, Barry Diller, Nicky Hilton Rothschild, Seth and Alexi Meyers, Maye Musk, and Fran Lebowitz.\n\nMore Great Stories from Vanity Fair\n\n— Inside a multi-million-dollar makeup heist\n\n— Tracy Morgan takes you to Brooklyn, and shows you how it’s changing\n\n— What it’s like to play Camilla Parker Bowles\n\n— Let Maya Rudolph and Amy Poehler take you on a journey through Wine Country\n\nLooking for more?
