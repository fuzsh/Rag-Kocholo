Jan and I will spend eternity together - what a wonderful thingto know. I am Linda Buchheit, the best friend for the last 41 years. She had lots of patience and was strong in her walk with the Lord. There were several important things in her life: work, church, her friends and family, and spreading the love of Jesus and asking that question that all Christians should ask, and that is whether you know Jesus as your personal savior. Her job was very important to her. She worked over 30 years for Russell Yarbrough Moving Company, which became part of her family with all the drivers and her special friend, Richard Pavis, and family, and all the folks that work for Russell as well. Grace Baptist Church was her home away from home. She was active in everything and was a friend to everyone. She did the banking and the reports and anything she was asked to do for God and the church. She got so tired at the end, but she kept everything up.Survivors include brothers and their families, Doug and Shirley, of St. Louis; Leon and Polly, his friend, of St. Louis; and Burl and Jackie and family, of Montana. She had many other nieces and nephews and many other family and friends. And she was so very special to my family members. She was preceded in death by grandparents; mother and father; and other aunts and uncles; plus, her very special friend, Joey Buchheit, who went home to the Lord on Oct. 1, 2011.
