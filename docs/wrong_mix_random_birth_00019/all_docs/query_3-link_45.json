        "text": "Katy Perry's been given a humanitarian award by the woman she supported during the US presidential campaign - Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe politician, who was defeated by Donald Trump, got a standing ovation as she walked onstage in New York.\n\nUnicef's Audrey Hepburn Humanitarian Award was handed to the singer in recognition of her work with vulnerable children and as a goodwill ambassador.\n\nHillary's appearance at the Snowflake Ball was a surprise to most people.\n\nShe has only made one other public appearance since conceding the election.\n\nOn stage, she described Katy Perry as someone who has \"the spirit and the energy and the compassion that Audrey Hepburn brought to her work from Unicef\".\n\nShe also said that the 32-year-old had the most Twitter followers, then jokingly added that she \"might have some competition\" - an apparent reference to president-elect Donald Trump's constant tweeting.\n\nPerry made her support for Clinton very clear during the campaign., external\n\nClinton also said the star's lyrics \"remind us when you get knocked down to get back up\", which led to more cheers in the audience.\n\nKaty Perry was a major supporter of the Democrat, who won the popular vote in America, and campaigned for her.\n\nShe's also been involved with activism around breast cancer and HIV awareness."
