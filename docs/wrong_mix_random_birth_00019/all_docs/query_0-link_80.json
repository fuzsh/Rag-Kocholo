Her role in this fast-paced setting is a combination of raw emotion, high intensity, and a desire to support patients and their families through what is oftentimes the worst day of their lives. Her time with them may only be a few hours, but she is honoured to support them, and takes pride in trying to be the calming force. Over 20-years later, Stephany’s passion and dedication to this work burns as bright as ever.

Private practice affords her the opportunity to do deeper work with a diverse range of clients. By helping clients learn more about themselves, they begin to create a life that feels more authentic to them. Asking for help shows signs of strength, confidence and resourcefulness.

During our comprehensive substance dependency evaluation, areas reviewed by our treatment team of doctors and chemical dependency counselors include the substance use disorder, co-occurring mental health conditions and the patient’s overall physical condition, including an assessment of chronic medical conditions that contributed to the addiction or have been made worse by substance abuse. Initial detoxification may take anywhere from a couple of days to a couple of weeks, depending on the type of drug and the level of addiction. During that time, patients may be prescribed medications that significantly relieve physical withdrawal symptoms and reduce cravings. Medications may include: Suboxone (buprenorphine) Vivitrol (naltrexone) Librium Campral (acamprosate) Neurontin (gabapentin) Clonidine Vistaril (hydroxyzine) We use those medications as needed, and to the extent desired by the patient and indicated by their condition, to allow patients to focus on their recovery.

Law enforcement personnel and first responders often struggle to manage the challenges associated with competing demands.

I believe that we are made for connection and attachment. When relationships have been harmed or trauma has occurred, there is a fracture, wound or scar. This can run deep and needs to be treated with tenderness and understanding. Those who have experienced trauma may not understand the toll it has done to the brain, body, heart, soul or voice. I have the privilege of educating and finding therapeutic ways in which the client can heal. It is a true honor to walk alongside someone while they find their way towards healing and wholeness. I have the honor of serving first responders and those dear to them. I am a Certified First Responder Counselor (CFRC).
