        "text": "Last night, the 10th installment of Diane von Furstenberg's eponymous awards honoring female change makers took place at the Brooklyn Museum. Just a staircase away from Judy Chicago's iconic feminist artwork The Dinner Party, the museum's grand third floor was transformed with chic white leather couches and a cloud-like carpet. But even more awe-inspiring than the setting were the five remarkable women upon whom the bestowed a $50,000 grant—and the powerful speeches they shared throughout the evening.\n\nThe honorees were Professor Anita Hill, who received the Lifetime Leadership Award, and Susan Burton, who received the People's Voice Award. (Burton is the founder of A New Way of Life, an organization that provides housing, employment assistance, legal services, and more to formerly incarcerated women.) International awards went to Nadia Murad, the 2018 co-recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize and founder of Nadia's Initiative, and Hadeel Mustafa Anabtawi, an entrepreneur who founded The Alchemist Lab, an educational center that's helped over 25,000 children in refugee camps acquire the skills and confidence to explore the world around them. Katy Perry received the Inspiration Award, using her acceptance speech to reiterate the importance of a nuanced movement that doesn't just support one kind of woman: \"Intersectional feminism is the only feminism.\"\n\nCleo Wade, Seth and Alexi Meyers, Olivia Palermo, Coco Rocha, Tina Brown, Nicky Hilton Rothschild, Cindy McCain, and Sheila Nevins were among the well-polished guests in the audience. Elaine Welteroth emceed the night, while Gloria Steinem, Julia Stiles, Ariana Huffington, and Alison Williams each presented a nominee.\n\nGloria Steinem, Diane von Furstenberg, and Anita Hill\n\nDiane von Furstenberg, shining in a sequined, diagonally striped dress and emerald earrings, began the evening by speaking about the power of character and sharing her story of being born to a Holocaust survivor. \"Behind every one life saved, there is a dynasty. I am actually a proof of that. After surviving the genocide, my mother gave me life. My birth was a miracle and I was her revenge,\" she said.\n\nVon Furstenberg then presented the evening's first award to Nadia Murad, whose once peaceful life turned into a nightmare in 2014 when ISIS invaded her village of Sinjar, Iraq, and began a horrific massacre against the Yazidi population. Murad, then 19, was kidnapped and held as a sex slave. Her mother and eight of her brothers were killed.\n\nIn her short speech, a gracious Murad thanked von Furstenberg and her attorney, Amal Clooney, for filing charges against a German citizen who became an active member of ISIS and enslaved a mother and child. (Clooney had filed the charges just the day before.) \"The genocide is not over. Until we bring justice to the victims of this genocide, ISIS is not defeated,\" Murad said.\n\nNadia Murad at the 2019 DVF Awards\n\nAnita Hill, Katy Perry, Susan Burton, and Mustafa Anabtawi spoke about their upbringings, and the different struggles around the world that sparked their activism. And, as Hill mentioned in her speech, the U.S. has its own: \"No one would have predicted 28 years ago that I would still be here. The due process is designed to make women like myself disappear.\"\n\nA moving set from Chloe x Halle came in the middle of the ceremony, offering a moment of reflection. And following Hill's closing speech, Welteroth announced that the museum would be extending invitations for everybody to stay and enjoy the ongoing Frida Kahlo exhibition and dessert.\n\nELLE.com spoke to Diane von Furstenberg about mentorship, a role she's long championed, and the importance of women having confidence in 2019. \"I think it's important to all women to support one another. And sometimes, you'd think it's the big person that mentors the small one, but we all learn from each other.\"\n\nChloe x Halle performing at the 2019 DVF Awards\n\nCoco Rocha, glowing in a blush pink DVF power suit, reflected on von Furstenberg supporting her from her very first season, years before the era of #MeToo and #TimesUp. \"A memory I remember really well is her, along with Anna Wintour, saying to go ahead and speak on behalf of the models on subjects of backstage and treatment, and what we needed to improve.... To have her and Anna's approval on the subjects has made me, since then, have these conversations all over the world and feel that I have the right.\"\n\nAttendees Maye Musk and Coco Rocha at the 2019 DVF Awards\n\nGloria Steinem, who at 85 is as sharp, engaging, and radiant as ever, best captured the essence of the DVF Awards. When asked by ELLE.com why it's important for women to own our achievements, she responded: \"If we don’t recognize each other, it’s kind of unlikely that we will be recognized by the existing hierarchies, or that we will be recognized for the right reason.\"\n\nShe added, \"Diane has always, always been such a leader of recognizing and identifying and giving the histories of other women as a gift to the world.\""
