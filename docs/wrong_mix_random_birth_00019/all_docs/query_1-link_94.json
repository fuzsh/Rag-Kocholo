But I’m also wishing it would all slow down a little bit and not be over so fast. You, too?? What a year, Siestas. What a year. I told you several SSMT posts ago that my memory work with you has never meant more to me or held a more prominent place in my personal life and I still mean that. I am so thankful for this process that I am almost without words.\n\nI am on my way to Pensacola, Florida for our final Living Proof Live (I go in on Thursdays these days) so, once again, I better get with it! I chose this particular verse (and version) specifically in view of the holiday spending-madness that many of us have ahead. You won’t find a single Scrooge at this ministry. Like many of you, we all love to shower our friends and family members in Christmas gifts to the degree that we’re able and we pray to have pure hearts as we give. We give these small tokens of grace to one another this time of year because of the priceless Gift God has given to us in Christ Jesus. I think it can be a beautiful thing and I also respect those who, by conviction, choose not to participate in the retail hype. I get that completely. Those of us who will be in the malls and shopping online, however, might really be blessed by a mutual reminder to try to stay within our means over these next few weeks and not pile up debts. It takes the joy right out of the giving if we’re paying for it for the entire next year…and with interest. SO, how about this Scripture this time around?\n\nBeth, Houston. “Let no debt remain outstanding, except the continuing debt to love one another, for he who loves his fellowman has fulfilled the law.” Romans 13:8 NIV\n\nSmiling. Man. God seems to have a word for everything, doesn’t He?\n\nI love you guys so much! I can’t wait to see some of you in Pensacola! The rest of you pray for us, okay?"
