Tasha Wilson Wins AR Milken Award

Kingsland Elementary School | Kingsland, AR | Nov 30, 2018

Milken Educator Award recipient Tasha Wilson listens to the long ovation from her students and colleagues. Wilson mentors novice teachers each year and often steps into their classrooms to model lessons. Kingsland’s principal is in the building only in the afternoons, so Wilson steps in during the mornings, handling assemblies and other administrative duties—but she is committed to the classroom.
