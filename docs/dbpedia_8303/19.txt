Description

BleachBit is a free, open source disk cleaner, system optimizer and also a privacy tool: an excellent, free alternative to other similar tools such as CCleaner.

You can use this software for various tasks (see the features section below) such as: delete temporary system files (history, logs), remove browser history, cache, cookies and much more. It can also shred files preventing data recovery and has the ability to overwrite the free disk space which also prevents data recovery. The software interface is pretty simple and although, you might feel a little intimidated when using it for the first time, for basic usage, just choose the (1) area you want to clean (e.g. browser cookies and history) (2 - optional) use the "Preview and (3) "Clean" button. A good idea would be to check the "Documentation" section before actually using the program - you only need a few minutes to read all of it. If you need to ask a question, the "Help" section has several, additional links to several places where you can get help, such as the forum. Currently, this tool runs on MicrosoftÂ® WindowsÂ® (available as an installer and portable version) and Linux.
