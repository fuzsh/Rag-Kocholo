        "text": "*facepalm* You're completely right. Nice work!\n\nI'm not sure exactly what some of the parameters mean (particularly the search parameter), but we could probably figure them out with some time & effort. I think I've got them all worked out. For future reference, or anybody who happens to be interested, here's what I think:\n\ncommand can have a value of delete or winreg. delete means a file/folder deletion, while winreg means a Registry key deletion.\n\nsearch can have a value of walk.all, walk.files, file, or glob. walk.all means recursively delete all files and folders in the specified folder, walk.files means delete all files but not any folders in the specified folder, file means delete a single file, and glob means delete all files matching the (RegEx?) pattern in path.\n\npath is the path to the folder or Registry folder to delete items from. For files/folders, it can also contain what appears to be RegEx patterns; these patterns are used in conjunction with the search parameter to determine which files/folders are deleted.\n\nI don't have time to do anything with this right now, but later in the summer I'll look into making a cleaners package for the official PortableApps programs.\n\nWell, there are still a couple of things that need to be dealt with on my end. DT1 has a couple of minor things I'm cleaning up in DT2 (I'll drop that in a few moments), and I want to create a plugin installer with cleaners for as many official PA releases as possible. I've also got to chase down the BleachBit author and get him to create an interface for language switching - currently, BleachBit has no way to switch the language. BleachBit looks at the %LANG% environment variable (which usually isn't set) or uses the Windows language, which could easily become a nightmare for PortableApps users who have to shift from machine to machine.\n\nAfter I get those things dealt with, we'll need to wait a week or two to make sure everything is working properly, then we can ask John for PR status.\n\nI just got this message back from the BleachBit dev:\n\nThis code probably has changed since 0.7.4. I suggest he report the\n\nbug in the BleachBit forum or bug tracker.\n\nIf you want to file a bug report, I'll pass on the link to it; otherwise, I can just tell him you can't reproduce the issue and decided to let it go. What would you like to do?"
