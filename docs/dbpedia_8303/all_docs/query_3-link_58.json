So is it really useful for Linux/*nix systems? Is there an equivalent for GNOME?\n\nThanks.\n\nEach has its advantages and disadvantages,i have two desktop computers at home, one (Linux) belonging to my brother and the other (Windows 10) to me.\n\nBleachBit is working on Linux,it does do very well,but sometimes,i have no patience as it needs enought time to work.\n\nBut for Windows computer,i just select some program or data (Files) that i don’t want,then using CCleaner to reinstall or delete them."
