        "text": "If you’re looking for a programming language to learn, you can’t do much better than Python. Originally released in 1991 by creator Guido van Rossum and re-released as Python 3 in 2008, the Python programming language has been gaining popularity ever since.\n\nIn October 2021, Python made headlines as the world’s most popular programming language, beating out longtime leaders C and Java. It’s a coding powerhouse with applications across industries, and it’s easy for beginners to learn and use for:\n\nBack-end web development\n\nData science\n\nData analytics\n\nData visualization\n\nMachine learning and artificial intelligence\n\nScientific computing\n\nTask automation\n\nFinance\n\nProgramming education\n\nGame development\n\nWhat kind of programming language is Python?\n\nPython is a general-purpose programming language. Unlike domain-specific languages like HTML or SQL, which serve specific functions, Python can handle a broad range of tasks. Its uses range from task automation and data analysis to software development.\n\nThere are several types of general purpose languages. Python is an object-oriented programming language, meaning that it separates its code into self-contained entities called “objects.” Each object includes data and the code that processes that data.\n\nObjects make code more maintainable and easy to transfer from one project to another. Being an object-oriented language is part of what makes Python an efficient, user-focused language.\n\nWhat are Python packages and modules?\n\nPortable, well-organized code forms the foundation of Python. Instead of having to code everything from scratch, users can take pre-written Python code from resources known as packages or modules.\n\nModules help programmers:\n\nOrganize complex programs into smaller manageable units.\n\nMinimize the amount of raw code needed for a project.\n\nWhat are Python libraries and frameworks?\n\nPython programmers can package modules into libraries and frameworks. At the simplest level:\n\nA module is a section of reusable code.\n\nA library is a collection of modules.\n\nA framework is made up of libraries.\n\nYou’d use a module and a library to create your own code structure. A framework is more like a scaffolding — something you can take as a whole and drop in your own details.\n\nFrameworks are popular in web and app development tasks because they eliminate repetitive work, letting developers get creative faster.\n\nWhat are the applications of Python?\n\nPython was designed for mass usability from day one. Guido van Rossum wanted his language to be:\n\nIntuitive to use.\n\nAs powerful as competitors like C++ and JavaScript.\n\nOpen-source.\n\nAs understandable as everyday English.\n\nIn many ways, he succeeded. Python’s simple syntax and readability has made the language popular with developers and non-developers alike. Today, a vast Python programming community spans multiple industries.\n\nBack-End Web Development\n\nThere are two parts to any web application: the front end and the back end:\n\nThe front end is the user interface—the parts you see as a website visitor.\n\nThe back end handles behind-the-scenes functions, such as databases that store user login information.\n\nFor web developers, Python is primarily a back-end language. It provides the code that fetches user-requested information from required databases, then returns that information to the user.\n\nPython’s power comes from its popular web frameworks.\n\nDjango fast-tracks web development so programmers can launch new apps or sites in hours.\n\nFlask is a micro-framework that works as an application programming interface, also called an API. It streamlines and simplifies the buildup of web applications.\n\nPyramid is for projects that “start small but finish big.” It helps apps scale and stay functional no matter how much they grow.\n\nSome frameworks, including Django and Pyramid, are full-stack. They work on the front and back end, offering more functionality to developers.\n\nData Science\n\nData science uses technology and analytics to draw business insights from big data. Data scientists spend their days sourcing, organizing, and modeling data to get better insights and solve business problems.\n\nIn a survey by data science technology company Anaconda, 96% of respondents said they use Python at least occasionally, while 63% say they use it always or frequently.\n\nData scientists use Python to build complex machine learning algorithms that can handle large volumes of data. Python is the language of choice because it’s simple and scalable, while also offering multiple machine learning and data processing libraries. For example:\n\nKeras builds neural networks and advanced data models.\n\nPandas can manipulate and analyze large volumes of data.\n\nNumPy lets you work with special multi-value variables called arrays.\n\nPython also has several ready-to-use automation frameworks, including PYUnit and UnitTest, that let data scientists run experiments quickly and easily. The faster the test, the more quickly it delivers results.\n\nData Analytics\n\nWhile data scientists spend their time manipulating raw data, analysts take existing data points and extract useful insights. In the past few years, data analytics has become a core business function, driving more business decisions than ever before.\n\nPython helps data analysts do their jobs more efficiently and get more out of large data sets. Analysts use many of the same standard libraries as data scientists, including:\n\nPandas\n\nNumPy\n\nScrapy\n\nBeautifulSoup\n\nData analysts’ Python libraries typically focus on automating workflows, finding data, and reformatting data to make it more useful.\n\nData Visualization\n\nData is only valuable if decision-makers can look at it and understand trends, patterns, and relationships. Data visualization makes this easier by converting raw data into charts, graphs, plots, and other accessible graphic representations.\n\nPython offers a variety of graphing libraries that let you create any kind of visualization you might want, from basic bar graphs to interactive charts. Some of the most popular data visualization libraries include:\n\nMatplotlib: Great for creating basic visualizations like bar graphs, line charts, and scatter plots\n\nSeaborn: Based on Matplotlib, but with a more advanced interface that creates beautiful graphs faster\n\nPlotly: Ideal for making publication-ready interactive graphs of all kinds\n\nYou can create simple graphs and charts as a basic user, or advance your skills and develop highly complex visualizations for expert audiences.\n\nMachine Learning and Artificial Intelligence\n\nIn the past few years, the world has made major strides in AI—getting computers to mimic human intelligence. One of the most popular forms of AI today is machine learning, which teaches computers to learn from patterns.\n\nMachine learning can:\n\nPredict patient outcomes in healthcare.\n\nSuggest music and movies based on a viewer’s past choices.\n\nHandle customer service questions online.\n\nTranslate languages with better accuracy than ever before.\n\nPython is the number-one programming language for machine learning. It’s stable yet flexible, so developers can rely on it for complex projects. It’s also easy to learn, so developers can get to the deep work faster.\n\nMost importantly, Python offers a wide range of libraries specifically designed for machine learning. Among the most popular are:\n\nSciKit-Learn: Simplifies the interface of machine learning algorithms.\n\nTensorflow: Builds advanced neural networks for companies like Dropbox and Google.\n\nMlPy: Predicts outcomes by analyzing patterns.\n\nUsing these libraries, scientists implement new algorithms and expand what machine learning can accomplish.\n\nScientific Computing\n\nScientific computing uses computers to solve real-world problems, usually in the science or engineering fields. Researchers and engineers use scientific computing to develop mathematical models and test hypotheses, often in scenarios where real-world experimentation would be dangerous or impossible.\n\nAlongside MATLAB, Python is a go-to language for developing these mathematical models. It’s easy to learn, has plenty of support documentation, and offers multiple input/output options to simplify data processing.\n\nPython also has multiple libraries designed to handle calculation tasks:\n\nNumPy is “the fundamental language for scientific computing with Python.”\n\nSciPy provides multiple scientific programming algorithms.\n\nMatplotlib is essential for data visualization.\n\nTools like these are essential in today’s scientific computing world, which handles an ever-increasing volume of data.\n\nPython also supports more advanced scientific computing. Its machine learning capabilities let researchers uncover new patterns and correlations. It’s also extremely flexible as a language for APIs, which connect with cloud-based systems and even advanced quantum computers.\n\nTask Automation\n\nProgrammers, engineers, and researchers always look for ways to automate repetitive tasks, such as checking for file errors or scrubbing data. The process of coding these automations is called scripting.\n\nPython is the ideal scripting language. Thanks to its simple syntax and readability, even relative beginners can use it to write basic automations. There are multiple scripting features built into the language, and many of its libraries have scripting resources.\n\nYou can automate nearly any repetitive task with Python, including:\n\nEmail sending\n\nFile reading or writing\n\nCompleting PDF and CSV files\n\nExtracting data from web pages\n\nFetching details of operating systems\n\nThere are many more automation options beyond these, thanks to Python’s extensive libraries and support for different data structures. And if your target automation doesn’t match with one of Python’s existing structures, you can create your own.\n\nFinance\n\nPython is widely recognized as one of the best and most useful programming languages for the finance industry. It’s approachable for non-tech professionals to learn and can handle both basic and advanced tasks, such as:\n\nPredicting the value of stocks and other assets.\n\nAnalyzing industry trends and patterns.\n\nAutomating data analysis workflows.\n\nPython is especially popular in quantitative finance, which handles the analysis of large datasets. Its machine learning libraries, including PyBrain and SkiKit, power advanced machine analytics, while libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib make creating advanced visualizations simple.\n\nPython also allows financial technology (FinTech) professionals to quickly build and scale a minimum viable product, or MVP. This allows financial services providers to adapt more easily to changing consumer demands. Plus, Python’s many libraries let different products communicate with other software, so new products can more easily integrate with real-world applications.\n\nProgramming Education\n\nPython is an important part of the programming educator’s toolkit. A reported 71% of educators use Python to teach machine learning and data science, while 88% of students learn Python to enter those fields.\n\nPython is a valuable educational language for several reasons:\n\nIts syntax is simple, so students spend less time learning commands and more time coding.\n\nIts robust documentation lets students practice independent problem-solving.\n\nBecause its learning curve is less steep than that of other languages, educators can cover advanced topics faster and in more depth.\n\nEducators can use Python to teach multiple types of programming.\n\nComputer programming with Python has real-world applications in multiple fields, from software development to data analysis.\n\nPython is the go-to educational language for leading institutions, including the famous Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In 2018, its Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python became the most popular massive open online course (MOOC) in school history.\n\nGame Development\n\nVideo game development isn’t the most popular use of Python, mostly because competitors like C++ and C# are faster and more powerful. Still, popular video games like Battlefield 2 and Civilization IV have used Python for select elements.\n\nAlso, the Python library PyGame has been a go-to resource for many beginner game developers. PyGame is free, runs on any platform, and is accessible to anyone with a basic knowledge of Python programming.\n\nInterestingly, a popular game engine called Godot bases its native scripting language, GDScript off of Python. Folks who learn Python and want to make video games will feel at home scripting in Godot.\n\nWhere can beginners learn Python?\n\nedX offers Python courses from some of the world’s top institutions, including MIT and Harvard University. Some are basic introductions, while others show how to apply Python to disciplines like predictive modeling and data engineering. Check out your options today, and get ready to add this valuable skill to your programming resume.\n\nYou can also find a Python tutorial on almost any coding app or educational platform, thanks to the language’s growing popularity. Any one of them will introduce you to basic commands and Python vocabulary, but they’re not all of equal quality. If you want to be a Python developer at every level, it’s worth finding a reputable course."
