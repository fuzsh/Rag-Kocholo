        "text": "Most websites consist of HTML show the structure of a website. Together with CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactive functionality, the website can provide value for its visitors. Some of the used JavaScript libraries are heavy on bandwidth, so website owner may use a content delivery network (CDN). The primary goal for a CDN is to get data closer to the end-user, which results in faster downloads and increasing the performance of the website.\n\nSome common JavaScript libraries are used on many websites. As not every single website creator can pay the costs of a CDN, bigger companies might actually sponsor bandwidth on their CDN edge servers. While this is great from a cost perspective, it also introduces a privacy concern. The owner of the CDN can exactly see what websites a user is visiting by looking at the related requests to the CDN and the related referrer. This is where Decentraleyes comes into place, by intercepting requests to content delivery networks (CDN).\n\nPrivacy Badger provides protection against website visitor trackers. These trackers come in the form of beacons or invisible pixels and have the goal to collect information about the browser. This data is often shared by third parties and used to create a profile of a particular browser. As minor differences for each user may lead to an individual user, these third parties may even link some of the data to the related individual. Tools like Privacy Badger do not provide guarantees that they block everything, yet can decrease the amount of data greatly."
