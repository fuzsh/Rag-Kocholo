        "text": "PyCharm\n\nPyCharm is a proprietary Python IDE solution. Pycharm is developed by JetBrains, which develops a suite of code editors for other languages in addition to Python. PyCharm is compatible with macOS, Linux, and Windows, so you can use it across systems.\n\nThere are two versions of the tool: a free open-source edition and a paid version. So, if you’re looking for a free Python IDE, this might be your ticket.\n\nIf you choose the paid version, you’ll get advanced features like database and SQL support, remote development capabilities, and scientific tools. Featuring a sleek and intuitive UI, here’s what you can expect to see when you try to make a new project in Pycharm:\n\nPyCharm advertises itself as a platform that brings all the Python development tools you need together in one location. It offers basic intelligent code completion, saving you time and freeing you from monotony or repetitive tasks and quick bug fixes. The platform also offers support for several popular web development frameworks, like FastAPI, Django, Pyramid, Flask, and Google App Engine. In addition, PyCharm supports several languages in addition to Python, including JavaScript, Node.js, HTML/CSS, SQL, and JavaScript frameworks like VueJS, ReactJS, and Angular. Whether you’re interested in the open-source version or the professional edition, you can get started for free.\n\nVisual Studio Code\n\nVisual studio code is an open-source code IDE developed by Microsoft. It is written in Electron and works across major operating systems including MacOS, Linux, and Windows. It has a beautiful modern UI owing to its development by the highly skilled designers and developers at Redmond.\n\nAs an open-source solution, VS Code offers several powerful tools out of the box, including an intelligent autocompletion feature, a built-in debugger, and built-in Git commands, among other things. Since it’s open source, it’s also extensible creating a sea of plugins to enhance the IDE like Docker support. Search a seemingly endless number of integrations and plugins to make your VS Code experience that much stronger.\n\nVS Code integrations can be enabled or disabled at will. VS Code multiple programming languages and frameworks besides Python, including JavaScript, Markdown, Ruby, C++, Go, PHP, Java, and numerous others.\n\nSpyder\n\nSpyder is an open-source IDE originally created by Pierre Raybaut for scientific Python development workflows that work across macOS, Linux, and Windows environments. It is created specifically for data science, research, and scientific computing.\n\nSpyder offers a range of features, such as an interactive Python console, a debugger, a variable explorer, a code editor, and a powerful library of plugins like Spyder Notebook and Spyder Terminal, making it an excellent choice for scientific computing, research, and data analytics. Spyder supports most of the common scientific libraries like SciPy, Matplotlib, Dask, Pandas, and Numpy out of the box making it ideal for data-related workflows. If you’re a data nerd who loves seeing everything in one place, you’ll love Spyder.\n\nHere’s an example of what your experience will look like:\n\nJupyter Lab and Jupyter Notebooks\n\nJupyter Notebook is an open-source web app that enables Python developers to create and collaborate on documents that include code, visualizations, narrative text, and other items. The platform is well-suited to several use cases, including data science, machine learning, statistical modeling, and data visualization.\n\nAs a developer in the scientific computing space or a bona fide data scientist, you may want to give Jupyter a spin. Jupyter is also popular among data science beginners. While Jupyter was founded as a Python editor, the platform has since begun supporting several different languages, including R, Julia, and Scala. (In fact, its name comes from supporting Julia, Python, and R!) Jupyter lets users share their work through email, Dropbox, and Github, accelerating collaboration.\n\nThe platform also works with Docker and Kubernetes to streamline deployment and installation with containerization.\n\nOn the other hand, JupyterLab is an open-source web-based IDE that is built upon Jupyter Notebook technology. JupyterLab system supports over 100 programming languages (called “kernels” in the Jupyter ecosystem) including Python as explained in this article. It allows you to run code in a variety of ways, including running code cells within the interface, running code in a separate console, and launching interactive applications.\n\nThis is what JupyterLab looks like on start:\n\nEmacs\n\nDeveloped by Richard Stallman, Guy Steele, and David Moon, Emacs is a text editor written in its own language, Emacs Lisp, and is compatible everywhere. Emacs is a powerful, extensible, and highly customizable text editor that has been around for decades. It is widely used by programmers, system administrators, writers, and other professionals who need a versatile tool for working with text. Developers pair Emacs with Evil, a complete emulation of Vim’s multi-model editor, and the results are impressive.\n\nOne of its greatest strengths is its ability to support multiple programming languages and file types, including C++, Python, HTML, and LaTeX. The main disadvantage of Emacs though is that it has a steep learning curve and its download process for Windows OS is not direct. If you want to master Emacs, expect to spend a while getting to know it.\n\nSublime Text\n\nSublime Text is a proprietary sophisticated text editor compatible across macOS, Linux, and Windows environments. Sublime Text is free to test, you need to buy a license to use it continuously. That said, the company doesn’t enforce a time limit. So, in theory, you could use it for free in perpetuity. But the developers probably deserve to be paid, especially if you end up using the tool for a while, so proceed wisely. Since Sublime Text is proprietary, you can’t edit its internals or view the source code thus it shouldn’t come as a surprise that, despite its age, Sublime doesn’t offer a robust marketplace of plugins and integrations. However, what the editor lacks in plugins, it wins in terms of power and speed. It also comes with great features out of the box for example multiple cursors.\n\nVim\n\nVim (i.e., Vi iMproved) was created by Bram Moolenar in 1991 as a rewrite of the older Vi that Bill Joy developed back in the ‘70s. It is written in its own language (Vimscript) and is compatible everywhere. Vim is an excellent choice for developers who enjoy performing every action directly from the keyboard without having to use a mouse.\n\nVim is designed to be efficient and flexible, with many powerful features and commands that can help developers quickly and easily navigate, edit, and manipulate text. One of the main powers of Vim is that a user can record a macro and replay them to automate repetitive tasks.\n\nVim was once notorious for being hard to quit. When you open up Vim today, you’ll see a “:q to quit” message in the lower left-hand corner. That was added quite a bit after Vim launched.\n\nBut even with the slow advancements, you’ll be rewarded for getting to know Vim. Competent Vim users will blaze past previous speeds at which they previously edited text.\n\nMaster Vim’s commands and you can do amazing things. But everything has a cost. If you’re looking at a big project in your immediate future and need to get up and running fast, you’re far better off with one of the editors above. Why? Look at the basic commands you need to know to use Vim, and you’ll realize it will take you months to get comfortable with them.\n\nDataspell\n\nJetBrains DataSpell is an addition to the JetBrains IDEs. It is a cutting-edge integrated development environment (IDE) specifically designed for data scientists and analysts. With its extensive set of tools and features, DataSpell simplifies the process of working with data, enabling users to efficiently clean, visualize, and analyze datasets thus making it an indispensable tool for data-driven professionals.\n\nSome of the key features of JetBrains DataSpell are:\n\nDesigned for data scientists and analysts with high interactivity and smart coding assistance\n\nSupports Python, R, and SQL programming languages.\n\nSeamless integration with local and remote Jupyter, JupyterLab, and JupyterHub servers.\n\nData cleaning and visualization tools with a scientific Python console for live outputs.\n\nAdvanced code refactoring and debugging\n\nBuilt-in version control system\n\nCollaborative features for team-based projects\n\nExtensive library support and customizability\n\nNeoVim\n\nNeoVim is a hyperextensible modern fork of the Vim text editor. It was created in 2014 to modernize Vims architecture for maintenance and extensibility. It is fully compatible with most of the Vims plugins while adding new features and improvements.\n\nNeoVim has a built-in terminal emulator which makes running shell scripts easy. NeoVim has 30% less code than Vim and thus provides a faster and more flexible editing experience than Vim. At the same time, it makes it easier for developers to extend the editor for their specific use cases. Here is an example of the default NeoVim interface in Windows 11.\n\nThe above IDEs are the most commonly used Python IDE’s and editors. Furthermore, below is a list of other tools worthy of mentioning when dealing with Python editing."
