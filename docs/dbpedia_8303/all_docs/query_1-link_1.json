        "text": "BleachBit is written in Python, which is an interpreted language, so BleachBit is not compiled.\n\nI have never tried to run it headless, but here's how I would start. It seems like you are installing from source rather than from a deb, rpm, or similar package, so it should be fine to install all the sources. Then invoke BleachBit using command line parameters as if you wanted the CLI from a GTK+ environment. That should be it.\n\nThe code you copied means that GTK+ will be used only if there are no command line arguments. The system won't even check whether GTK+ is installed! BleachBit uses the same technique to support multiple operating systems in the same source code without \"recompiling.\""
