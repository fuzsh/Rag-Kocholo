        "text": "Yes. Years before I wrote BleachBit I wrote another cross-platform, desktop application using C++ and wxWidgets. This creates a more native look and feel on Windows (and other platforms like Mac), and it is easier to make a smaller installer package.\n\nHowever, it takes more time to write code for C/C++ than with Python, so for a fixed amount of development time, there are fewer features.\n\nBased on the principle that function is more, a rewrite is not likely.\n\nYes, I figured. Python is good, simple, and fast language. You can Python in half the time it would take to master C++. Of course, python is also a sloppy language and lacks functionality and features you would only see in C/C++. I guess it doesn't matter, but I figured it would give you something to think about in the distant future.\n\nHmm, I am not sure what C/C++ features are missing in Python. It seems to be the other way around. Python's motto is \"batteries included,\" and it comes with a good set of features. For example, BleachBit uses a lot of native features in Python for XML processing, JSON, unit testing. Many other features can easily be added through Python modules, which are easy to install, like through PIP.\n\nPython can also be used to call C/C++ APIs, like I am doing in Windows for the recycling bin.\n\nPython is dynamically typed, and when used improperly, this can lead to errors, but so far this has not been an issue for BleachBit. It is something I am aware of, and assertions and unit tests are some methods to avoid these kinds of errors.\n\nYes. MaÃ«l Lavault has contributed a lot of code (in a separate branch in Git) to update BleachBit from GTK version 2 to GTK 3, though it needs some polishing, especially for Windows.\n\nOnce this GTK modernization is done, I would like to modernize Python too."
