        "text": "In addition to @anon6471198 's suggestion, I would add another one:\n\nUbuntu-cleaner.\n\nEverything has its pros and cons. Bleachbit is more verbose and selective in your choices. Ubuntu-cleaner does not need to be differentiated as root in order to use it and is thorough and very easy to use.\n\nBoth are quite safe.\n\nI would give Ubuntu-cleaner an additional point for safety, however. As Bleachbit offers more select-ability of what you are removing, a user can accidentally wipe data they didn't want to lose.\n\nWhich... may relate to the warning above to use it responsibly.\n\nWhen I was a Windows user, I used CCleaner. I would consider the above two choices similar in function and usability to familiar CCleaner, but more thorough in action and results.\n\nInstallation:\n\nUbuntu-cleaner is independently developed and open source, so resides in its own repository:\n\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:gerardpuig/ppa\n\nsudo apt update && sudo apt install ubuntu-cleaner\n\nI have used both since I moved over to Linux and never had either of them fail me or behave buggy.\n\nThere was one small gripe about Bleachbit that I had in which it places two panes very near to eachother overlapping the checkboxes: you can read this guide here to solve that:\n\nNo, when you run sudo apt clean in terminal, in fact, that is what is purged. The residual packaging and configuration files from an installation you ran previously.\n\nWhen you use the remove --purge parameter, it is the same: I t not only removes the software, but also the packaging and configuration. A simple removal leaves that stuff behind.\n\nAnd for good reason.\n\nIt's all about efficiency. When a person installs software, there is a high probability that they will reinstall it. By retaining the initial downloaded package, it spares taking up bandwidth by repeating the download. It is faster, since the user waits less time, as it does not need to run the download again.\n\nMuch of this is stored in the Apt Cache.\n\nOther things cleaners remove include indexed thumbnails, temp files, trash can contents, old kernels, browser caches (Which can get hefty) and uneeded packages (Which sudo apt autoremove takes care of) which are dependency packages installed but no longer needed."
