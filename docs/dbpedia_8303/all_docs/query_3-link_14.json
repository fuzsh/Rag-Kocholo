        "text": "Looking for a detailed CCleaner vs BleachBit comparison?\n\nHaving cache, temporary files and unnecessary clutter in your PC is inevitable over time. Still, manually cleaning it up can be a hassle. That’s where disk-cleaning apps come into play!\n\nCCleaner and BleachBit stand out from the rest. So, let’s see what makes them unique and how well they fare against each other when it comes to features, ease of use, pricing, and more.\n\nNow, let’s get to it!\n\nCCleaner vs BleachBit – Features\n\nCCleaner and BleachBit quickly became my go-to apps from the fairly large pool of cleaning apps I was testing. So, here’s a quick rundown of each application’s features.\n\nCCleaner – Complete PC Performance Optimizer\n\nWhen I installed CCleaner, the fantastic and user-friendly interface was one of the first things I liked about it.\n\nAdditionally, it automatically eliminated the stress of manually cleaning my PC with regular scans and suggestions. In short, the free version had everything I needed to optimize my PC.\n\nHere are some other standout factors:\n\nLightweight app. When I downloaded the installation package, it was only a little over 70 MB and it took less than 100MB of disk space upon installing it.\n\nOne-click scan your PC. CCleaner’s best feature is the ability to scan your entire PC in just one click.\n\nUninstall unwanted apps in seconds. The app automates the uninstallation process for you so that you can remove apps with one click.\n\nBoost system performance. CCleaner allows you to disable apps to make your PC start up and run faster.\n\nFree more disk space. The app makes it easy to free up disk space all in one place, thereby cutting out unnecessary manual cleaning.\n\nPC health check. CCleaner offers health checks and privacy protection, which gives you better control of your system.\n\nPC drivers update. The free app enables you to check online for driver updates so you can keep your device running at optimum levels.\n\nAvailable for multiple devices. You can download and use CCleaner on Windows, MacOS, Android, and iOS.\n\nBleachBit – Lightweight Disk Cleaner\n\nBleachBit is the second app I found myself using when I wanted more control over junk files on my PC.\n\nIt’s a completely free service that focuses on disk cleaning.\n\nThe interface caught my attention because it’s quite straightforward. It offers simplicity without any bundled apps upon installation – unlike CCleaner. What also makes it stand out is its remarkable file-shredding capability. It can securely delete files and make any form of recovery impossible.\n\nI found its cleaning strength impressive; covering caches, cookies, browsing history, temp files, and logs, all while prioritizing user privacy.\n\nStill, it lacks the range of capabilities CCleaner has: driver updates, startup optimization, and advanced PC optimization.\n\nHere’s a quick overview:\n\nLightweight app. The BleachBit application package was just 11MB and it only took a few seconds to install.\n\nCustom scanning options. Unlike CCleaner which allows you to one-click scan your computer for redundant files, BleachBit lets you select the apps and directories. This gives you more control over the cleaning process.\n\nClear unnecessary files. This cleaner can handle individual app caches and cookies, temp files and logs, and all other unnecessary files.\n\nFile shredder. You can shred-delete files to prevent data recovery.\n\nEase of Use and User Interface\n\nBoth CCleaner and BleachBit are easy to use and boast user-friendly interfaces.\n\nHowever, CCleaner has a more beginner-friendly interface.\n\nOnce you launch the app, you’re greeted by a clean UI with a button you can click to start scanning your computer right away. This works perfectly if you just want to optimize your PC without getting under the hood.\n\nIf you’re an advanced user, the custom clean tab will give you more control over the cleanup process as you can choose which apps to include when scanning.\n\nIn contrast, BleachBit’s user interface is less fancy and a bit more complicated.\n\nHowever, what I like about it is that it puts you in complete control of apps and computer folders to scan for optimization. You can pre-select what you want to delete even before starting the scanning process.\n\nIt also has a dark mode which can extend your battery life when you turn it on.\n\nIn short, CCleaner will work for both beginners and advanced users while BleachBit might take a beginner some time to get used to.\n\nPricing\n\nBoth apps are available for free. However, people who want more features can opt for the paid packages. Let’s review this below:\n\nCCleaner\n\nCCleaner offers four subscription plans depending on the features you want and the number of devices:\n\nFree. Covers basic PC health checks, disk cleaning, and privacy protection. You can also scan the web for available drivers but you’ll need a premium plan to download the updates if found.\n\nProfessional ($24.95). Grants access to CCleaner’s advanced features such as its driver updater, app optimization, file restorer, automatic cleaning, real-time threat monitoring, and priority support on one PC for one year.\n\nProfessional Plus ($39.35). All the features in Professional on 3 PCs for a year.\n\nPremium Bundle ($64.95). All the features in Professional Plus in addition to enhanced browser security, premium tech support, and pro access on Android and Mac.

The open-source nature of the tool means all the app’s features are available for free once you download the software on your device. However, you can only use the app on Windows and Linux.\n\nCCleaner vs BleachBit: Head-to-Head Comparison\n\nHow do both applications fare when I put them side by side? Check the table below to find out:\n\nVerdict\n\nAfter exploring the features of both applications in this CCleaner vs BleachBit review, my take is that each has its strengths.\n\nIf you’re seeking a free product with a handy file-shredding option, BleachBit is a great choice.\n\nHowever, if you’re looking for more thorough cleanup, optimization, and update features, then the paid version of CCleaner is the way to go.\n\nIf you’re just dipping your toes into disk cleaner apps and want to give one a shot, BleachBit is a good starting point."
