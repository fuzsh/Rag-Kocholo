You can develop and host your website or any other code directly from your browser without having to install software or manage your own server.\n\nNeed more power? Upgraded plans start at $5/month.\n\nStart running Python online in less than a minute! »\n\nWatch our short video »\n\nNot convinced? Read what our users are saying!\n\nPythonAnywhere makes it easy to create and run Python programs in the cloud. You can write your programs in a web-based editor or just run a console session from any modern web browser. There's storage space on our servers, and you can preserve your session state and access it from anywhere, with no need to pay for, or configure, your own server. Start work on your work desktop, then later pick up from where you left off by accessing exactly the same session from your laptop.\n\nSign up and try it out! »\n\nBatteries included\n\nWith Python versions 2.7, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9 and 3.10, and all the goodies you normally find in a Python installation, PythonAnywhere is also preconfigured with loads of useful libraries, like NumPy, SciPy, Mechanize, BeautifulSoup, pycrypto, and many others. Check out our full list of batteries included.\n\nPowerful servers\n\nPythonAnywhere runs on super-powerful servers hosted by Amazon EC2, and you can take full advantage of that. Without paying a penny, you can run simple Python programs to help you explore your ideas. For heavy-duty processing, you only pay for what you use, so you can get access to teraflops of power without needing to explain yourself to the electricity company.\n\nPython is a great language for teaching, but getting it installed and set up on all your students' computers can be less than easy. PythonAnywhere provides an environment that's ready to go — including a syntax-highlighting, error-checking editor, Python 2 and 3 consoles, and a full set of batteries included. Avoid all the hassles of getting Python installed on everyone's laptop, and making sure everyone can pip install all the right packages.\n\nDistributing assignments and monitoring progress is easy\n\nOnce a student has nominated you as their teacher, you can see their files and Python consoles, so you can help them more easily. You can copy files into their accounts so that you can give them a starting point for their assignments, and you can see their solutions.\n\nWe can even create student accounts in bulk for you, and pre-populate them with files that you provide — just let us know!\n\nAll your students have the same environment\n\nThe same operating system, the same console, the same text editor — save yourself from having to customise your lessons and instructions for Windows/Mac/Linux, and from having to debug issues in different shells and editors.\n\n...and they can work together\n\nYour students can choose to share their consoles with each other, too — so they can work on group projects remotely, or help each other in-class.\n\nSign up and try it out! »\n\nPythonAnywhere education help pages »\n\nStart work at work or at school, and continue at home\n\nBecause PythonAnywhere is web-based, it can follow you around on any computer (or iPad, or Chromebook) with a browser, so you or your students can work from wherever you like.\n\nWhat does it cost?\n\nIt's free! Our basic accounts are free, and we only charge for more advanced services (like professional web app hosting, or big number-crunching requirements), none of which are needed for basic \"intro to programming\" type courses. If you need larger amounts of processing power, then get in touch — you can also get an idea of our prices on the pricing page.\n\nLimitations\n\nOur education support is evolving rapidly, and there are a few limitations right now; check out this help page for the current list."
