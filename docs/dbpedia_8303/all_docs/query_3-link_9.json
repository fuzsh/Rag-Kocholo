If so then please share your reviews…\n\nAlso suggest some real good alternatives of CCleaner\n\nP.S. I don’t trust Adv. System Cleaner, TuneUp Utilities as they keep coming up with Adwares.\n\nWhat features of CCleaner do you regularly use?\n\nKnowing this will help narrow down some alternatives.\n\nPersonally I usually just use it for disk cleanup, I don’t mess with registry “cleaners” or disk wiping inside of Windows.\n\nPS: The malware slipped into one of the update servers affecting 32bit installations. It was stopped before any damage was done and a new version update was pushed ASAP.\n\nI’ve been using BleachBit for a while - I think it’s helpful. When I install it on a computer it also copies a configuration file with the default settings that I defined, so the users don’t have to figure out which boxes to check.\n\nNeither? I prefer opensource or paid tools I can vet. Definitely something with posted hashes of the download and companies with a long history of success.\n\nThat said, I don’t use these quick fix it tools. Built in Windows tools and manual/your scripted cleanup are better options because you know what changes are being made."
