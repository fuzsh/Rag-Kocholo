        "text": "This page is for good quality software on Windows, based on the contributions of /g/ users. This page is not for solidifying preferences or ideology; it is considered to be \"value-free\" and thus permitting of both reference to open source software and closed source software, for-profit and not-for-profit. This is not your soapbox, your ballot box, or pulpit. Stay constructive and avoid politics and arguments.\n\nPackage manager\n\nYou can (and should) install a package manager. It gives you the benefit of being able to download and install a lot of popular software via a single command on the command line, instead of having to navigate to a website, download it and run it. Take a look at Chocolatey NuGet and NPackd for more info. This is an advantage that OSX and Linux users have been enjoying for years, and now you should too.\n\nFor an all-at-once installation to install all of your selected favourite software in one go (useful on a fresh install of Windows), check out Ninite.\n\n*nix environment on Windows\n\nIf you're feeling a bit limited or alienated with Windows' command line tools, you can set up a native *nix environment on Windows.\n\nCygwin is a good choice to \"Get that Linux feeling - on Windows.\" It is basically the Wine of Windows, but without recreating system libraries and such. GOW is considered an improvement on it.\n\nGOW is GNU on Windows. It's like a much lighter Cygwin, it comes with a terminal option in Windows explorer, and also comes with over Linux 100+ binaries natively compiled for Windows.\n\nMinGW is another minimalist set of *nix binaries natively compiled for Windows.\n\nMobaXterm SSH client and terminal with embedded X server for Windows; supports the remote desktop protocols RDP, VNC and Xdmcp and connects via SSH, telnet, rlogin, Mosh and SFTP; also available as portable version for USB stick.\n\nMsysgit is not as big of a *nix environment as the others. It is the native Windows build of git, which also provides a shell with simple *nix utilities with cp, mv, rm, etc. and other basic coreutils you might need. Read the page for details.\n\nIf you're running Windows 10, there's the Windows Subsystem for Linux, which allows you to run an Ubuntu environment natively in Windows (think Wine but in reverse). Other distros are officially supported including Debian and SUSE, and there's a guide for using a custom distro.\n\nSSH\n\nCommunications\n\nWeb browsers\n\nSee also: Web browsers\n\nFirefox\n\nFirefox is free software developed by Mozilla. It is highly extensible via addons and included as the default browser in many Linux distributions. It is often criticized on /g/ and /tech/ as \"SJWfox\" because of some Mozilla developers outspoken campaigns on social and political issues.\n\nChromium\n\nChromium builds are based off the underlying code of Chrome. While nearly identical to Google's browser, they lack proprietary components like automatic updating and flash player. However, Chromium still phones home to Google.\n\nIridium\n\nIridium is a FLOSS fork of Chromium stripped of as many botnet and proprietary \"features\" as possible. It used to phone home to Iridium's servers for development purposes, but it no longer does that. Nonetheless, it is still as fast as a Chromium fork is expected. Use at your own risk.\n\nPale Moon\n\nPale Moon is a snowflake fork of Firefox under a snowflake open source license. It has a familiar pre-\"Australis\" UI, and maintains support for the older XUL addon/theming standard. Uses its own \"Goanna\" rendering engine, forked from Gecko, which performs poorly with some CSS/JS-heavy sites. Does not support current Firefox addons, and has its own addons (see also: JustOff addons).\n\nOpera\n\nOpera is a proprietary web browser that has pioneered open web standards for over two decades. It is notable for being the first web browser to sport a tabbed interface. It is developed and maintained by Opera Software. It used to feature its own rendering engine called Presto, but it has been since superceded by Chromium's Blink engine.\n\nFalkon\n\nFalkon is a KDE web browser using QtWebEngine rendering engine, previously known as QupZilla. It aims to be a lightweight web browser available through all major platforms. This project has been originally started only for educational purposes. But from its start, Falkon has grown into a feature-rich browser.\n\nFalkon has all standard functions you expect from a web browser. It includes bookmarks, history (both also in sidebar) and tabs. Above that, it has by default enabled blocking ads with a built-in AdBlock plugin.\n\nTor Browser\n\nTor Browser (formerly known as Tor Browser Bundle) is a package of a modified Firefox extended support release, NoScript, HTTPS-Everywhere, Tor, TorButton and TorLauncher. It automatically routes traffic through the Tor network and deletes history and cookies when closed.\n\nSeaMonkey\n\nSeaMonkey is a continuation of the Mozilla suite. Unlike most modern web browsers, it is an Internet suite, complete with bundled programs for email, IRC, and web design. It is compatible with most Firefox add-ons.\n\nMidori\n\nMidori is a fast, lightweight, LGPL licensed browser using the WebKit rendering engine. It is the default browser in Elementary OS, Raspbian and Trisquel Mini.\n\nK-Meleon\n\nK-Meleon is a FOSS web browser for Windows. It uses the Gecko rendering engine just like Firefox, but sports a native Windows UI. It is absurdly configurable. Also very suitable for Pentium M and older systems because of it's speed.\n\nOtter Browser\n\nOtter Browser is a FOSS web browser that aims to recreate the best aspects of the classic Opera (12.x) UI using Qt5.\n\nEmail clients\n\nDesktop email clients provide off-line email storage and additional features over most web-mail clients.\n\nThunderbird\n\nThunderbird is a free and open source email client based upon the Gecko rendering engine. Like its sibling Firefox, it offers the user extensive customization options via third-party add-ons.\n\nClaws-Mail\n\nClaws-Mail is a lightweight FOSS (GPL) email client based on GTK+. Supports PGP, vCalendar (Outlook compatible), RSS/Atom feeds, spam filtering and more via a well-maintained collection of first party plugins. Sending HTML emails is not supported. Reading HTML emails is usable but much improved by enabling WebKit or LiteHTML rendering engines.\n\nInstant Messaging (IM) clients\n\nPidgin\n\nPidgin, formerly known as GAIM, is a free and open source instant messaging client developed in C. It is based upon Libpurple and offers support for XMPP, Bonjour, Gadu-Gadu, IRC, GroupWise, Sametime, SILC, SIMPLE and Zephyr out of the box. Support for additional protocols like Matrix and Signal is offered through third-party plugins. Plugins are available for OTR, OMEMO and many other features. Beware it stores passwords in plain text by default.\n\nGajim\n\nGajim is a FOSS cross-platform GUI XMPP client written in Python. It supports OMEMO and not OTR.\n\nRetroShare\n\nRetroShare is an open source decentralized communication platform. It provides secure chat, photo and video sharing using OpenPGP to authenticate peers and OpenSSL to encrypt all communication.\n\nRicochet IM is and end-to-end encrypted instant messages which uses Tor hidden services.\n\nInternet Relay Chat (IRC) clients\n\nGraphical User Interface (GUI)\n\nHexChat\n\nHexChat is a popular replacement for the XChat IRC client, a client which offered a free binary for Linux but charges money for the Windows version. HexChat is a continuation of XChat and makes both its source code and binaries available to users of all platforms it's created for. Like its parent software, HexChat is licensed under the GNU GPL. It includes all the basic features one would need, and can be ideal both for new users and IRC veterans. Has built-in plugins for Lua, Perl and Python scripting.\n\nSmuxi\n\nSmuxi is another crossplatform IRC client and uses the GTK.

It is absolutely not recommended for privacy, and only recommended for normal non controversial conversations with your friends and family who won't settle for anything else. New versions of Skype are now a cancerous Electron app, but the old version is still available. Block apps.skype.com in your firewall or hosts file to block Skype ads.\n\nJitsi\n\nJitsi is a real Skype alternative using standards compliant FLOSS. It supports text encryption with OTR and audio/video encryption with ZRTP. The downside is it being bulky Java.\n\nGoogle Voice\n\nGoogle Voice runs in a web browser and requires a plugin for full functionality.

Like 7zip, it is capable of retrieving files from virtually any archive that one might encounter.\n\nWinRAR Archiver\n\nUnless one has some specific purpose in mind, the use of WinRAR is not recommended.\n\nWinRAR is a proprietary shareware archiver developed by the brothers Eugene and Alexander Roshal. Its once ubiquitous RAR format is still used almost universally by the Warez Scene, although it has falling out of favour with many other communities due to the growing popularity of 7z.

However, it has not been updated since December 2015, and has issues recognizing two different torrents with the same name as, well, different torrents. It is recommended to use qBittorrent, Deluge, or Transmission instead.\n\nFTP clients\n\nFileZilla\n\nFilezilla is a free and open source FTP, SFTP, and FTPS client written in C++.
