As stated, BleachBit is written in Python and PyGTK. There may be minimal changes to the Python code, and maybe some in the CleanerML (mostly XML) which defines which files should be cleaned.\n\nIf you have any issues, best to ask in an OpenBSD forum or on the BleachBit forum.\n\n(I am the BleachBit author.)"
