        "text": "Thanks for your reply, usually I did \"aptitude autoclean\" and it works after packet updates but in grub.cfg I have, like what I wrote above, text lines of old kernels.\n\nOld kernel lines start with \"} menuentry 'Debian GNU/Linux, with Linux 3.16.0-4-686 and it start...\" and end with \"initrd /initrd.img-3.16.0-4-686-pae }\"\n\nOk this file is not heavy about dimension but it could be nice to have a grub.cfg without old kernel lines, how could I make a own bleachbit cleaner?\n\nMaybe it could be also a grub utility to clean it... I don't know...\n\nGabriele"
