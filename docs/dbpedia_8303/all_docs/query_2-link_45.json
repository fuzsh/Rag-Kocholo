        "text": "Python has quickly become one of the most popular programming languages due to its simplicity, versatility, and abundance of resources available to those learning the language. It’s often the first language that beginner programmers learn, and it’s also widely used in the industry for purposes ranging from web development to data analysis.\n\nThe Python community is huge, and according to GitHub, Python keeps growing, with a 22.5% increase as of 2022. It’s also the third-most used programming language in 2023. This is the main reason why we have access to a wide variety of frameworks, most of them open-source.\n\nIn this article, we’ll dissect the most popular and useful Python frameworks that you should get to know.\n\nCheck Out Our video guide to the best Python frameworks:\n\nWhat Is a Python Framework?\n\nA Python framework is a collection of Python modules that provides a set of common functionality that can be used as a structure for building applications of any type.\n\nFrameworks are designed to simplify the development process by providing a general guideline on how we should build software and abstracting away some of the more complex or repetitive tasks. This allows you to focus on writing unique and custom logic for your applications, rather than having to reinvent the wheel.\n\nAn example of a repetitive task would be handling HTTP requests. Because most web applications need to handle this type of request, developers use existing frameworks that facilitate this function instead of writing everything from scratch or reusing the same code across different projects.\n\nNow that we have the concept of frameworks crystalized, let’s explore some types of Python frameworks.\n\nTypes of Python Frameworks\n\nPython has a variety of frameworks available for different types of development. Let’s take a look at a few of them.\n\nFull-Stack Framework\n\nA full-stack Python framework is a set of tools that provides everything a developer needs to build a complete web application from start to finish.\n\nThis includes a way to create the frontend — for example, a system of templates and an approach to display information to the user — and the backend, including common functionality like creating database records, handling HTTP requests, and controlling the security of the application.\n\nMicroframework\n\nA microframework is a minimalistic framework that provides only the essential components needed to build some sort of application.\n\nIt’s designed to be lightweight and easy to extend, making it a good choice for small projects or for developers who want more control over their code.\n\nAsynchronous Frameworks\n\nAn asynchronous framework is designed to handle concurrency and parallelism, allowing developers to build applications that can perform multiple tasks simultaneously.\n\nThe Python Package Manager (pip)\n\npip is a package manager for Python packages. If you’ve already installed Python, you have access to pip’s command line interface, which allows you to install Python packages.\n\nA package is an isolated and reusable collection of code that provides specific functionality to solve a common task (web development, authentication, GUI). All the frameworks we’re going to see next are part of the Python standard library, meaning they’re available as a pip package.\n\nYou can install any package available on the Python Package Index (PyPI) with the following command:\n\npip install package-name\n\nYou can also install packages from a text file — for example, a requirements file for a project — with the command below.\n\npip install -r requirements.txt\n\nPython Framework vs Python Library\n\nA Python library is a collection of functions and methods that can be used to perform specific tasks, such as parsing data or generating a random number. A library is generally more limited in scope and is meant to be used as a tool within a larger application.\n\nA Python framework, on the other hand, provides a complete set of tools and features that can be used to build an entire application. It usually defines the workflow software developers follow when creating a project.\n\nThis doesn’t mean you can’t expand the capabilities of a framework with other packages, which are often called plugins.\n\nWhy Use a Python Framework?\n\nThere are several benefits to using a Python framework when developing applications. Let’s review some of them:\n\nFrameworks make your software developer’s job easier: By providing a structure for the code and a set of tools and features that streamline the development process, frameworks can make it easier and more efficient for developers to build applications.\n\nFrameworks promote code organization: A well-designed framework helps to ensure that the code is organized and maintainable, making it easier to understand and modify the source code in the future.\n\nFrameworks can increase productivity: By providing pre-built components and tools and adhering to industry standards, frameworks allow developers to focus on the unique aspects of their applications rather than spending time on basic tasks.\n\nNow that you have enough theoretical background, let’s go over the top 25 Python frameworks.\n\nTop 25 Python frameworks\n\nHere are 25 of the most popular Python frameworks, divided into sections by functionality.\n\nPython Microframeworks\n\nThe following are lightweight microframeworks, useful when you want to create a simple app rapidly or have little memory consumption in your server.\n\n1. Flask\n\nFlask is a lightweight micro-framework used to quickly build simple web applications. It includes support for Jinja templates (a way to reuse HTML code), request handling, and application signaling.\n\nIt genuinely takes less than six lines of code to start a Flask app:\n\nfrom flask import Flask app = Flask(__name__) @app.route(\"/\") def hello_world(): return \"Hello Kinsta\"\n\nFeatures:\n\nLightweight and easy to use\n\nHigh flexibility\n\nBuilt on top of the Python standard library\n\nSupport for routing and views (controllers)\n\nSupport for templating with Jinja\n\nGreat documentation and community\n\nSupport for handling cookies and user authentication\n\nYou’ll also have access to some extension packages like Flask-RESTful, which adds support for building powerful REST APIs, and Flask-SQLAlchemy, a convenient way to use SQLAlchemy in your flask app.\n\n2. Bottle\n\nWant to create ridiculously light web applications with no other dependencies? Bottle is a lightweight Python microframework designed to easily build small- or medium-sized web applications. It doesn’t include any external dependencies aside from the Python standard library,\n\nBottle is built on top of the WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) standard and is compatible with most web servers and Python versions.\n\nFeatures:\n\nEasy to learn and use\n\nBuilt-in template system\n\nSuitable for building small web applications and APIs\n\nVery low memory usage\n\nHTTP, forms, and routing support\n\n3. CherryPy\n\nCherryPy is a minimalistic web application development framework for Python. It’s an object-oriented framework (OOP) that allows you to build web applications in the same way you would with any other OOP in Python.\n\nIt’s been around since 2002 and has been widely adopted in production environments across a diverse range of websites, from those with simple functionality to those that demand high complexity. For example, both giant software services Netflix and Hulu use CherryPy as part of their infrastructure.\n\nThe main task of CherryPy is to handle HTTP requests and match them with the adequate logic written by the developers. This means that by default, CherryPy doesn’t provide database access or HTML templating, leaving all the logic of the application to you.\n\nFeatures:\n\nMature framework\n\nHandle HTTP requests\n\nFlexible and extensible plugin system\n\nBackend-only framework\n\nObject-oriented development\n\nStable API\n\nPython Web Frameworks\n\nThe following are complete web frameworks that include components for common web development tasks such as database access, form handling, and security. Unlike microframeworks, Python web frameworks provide everything you need out of the box.\n\nYou should really consider your needs when building a web app. Sometimes it’s more than enough to just use WordPress.\n\n4. Django\n\nDjango is one of the most popular and widely used web frameworks in the Python ecosystem. It’s a rock-solid full-stack framework that includes everything you need to build a complete web application.\n\nIt was first introduced in 2005 as a Pythonic way to build a newsletter site. Nowadays, it’s one of the most used Python libraries for web development, with almost 8 million downloads per month. Some of the biggest sites made ever were originally created with Django, such as Instagram, Discus, Pinterest, Bitbucket, and Chess.com.\n\nDjango follows the Model-view-template (MVT) architecture and includes built-in features, such as templating, database management, admin panel, signals, and views (to manage the logic of your backend). To tackle Django, it is advisable you have strong fundamentals of Python Object-oriented programming, as well as functional programming.\n\nYou won’t go wrong by choosing Django for your next web project. It’s a powerful web framework that provides everything you need to build fast and reliable websites. And if you need any additional features — say, the ability to create a REST API to use with modern frontend frameworks like React or Angular — you can use extensions like Django REST framework.\n\nPlus, Django is one of the simplest frameworks to set up and deploy through Kinsta.\n\nFeatures:\n\nVery secure framework\n\nBuilt-in admin panel\n\nProprietary template language that dynamically displays HTML\n\nObject-relational-mapper (ORM), lay out the database with Python classes\n\nDatabase querying with Python API\n\nGreat CLI tools\n\nWide variety of extensions\n\n5. FastAPI\n\nFastAPI is a modern web framework that does one thing spectacularly well: build APIs.\n\nSince its release in 2018, it has rapidly gained popularity due to its great performance and simplicity. In fact, according to PyPi Stats, FastAPI has over 9 million monthly downloads, surpassing even full-stack frameworks like Django.\n\nBear in mind that FastAPI’s only purpose is to build backend APIs. That means you must have a frontend framework (like Vue.js) to display your site to your users.\n\nThat said, the framework is incredibly easy to work with, and you can even deploy an app with FastAPI through Kinsta and your GitHub repo in mere minutes.\n\nFeatures:\n\nFollows open standards for APIs like OpenAPI and JSON schema.\n\nData validation and serialization\n\nAutomatic documentation of your API\n\nModern web framework\n\nBased on Python 3.6+ features like type declarations\n\nType validation thanks to Pydantic\n\nAsynchronous programming support\n\n6. Pyramid\n\nPyramid is a flexible and extensible web framework that’s well-suited for both small and large applications. It’s the sweet spot between a microframework like Flask and a full-stack framework like Django.\n\nPyramid includes the most common features you would need when developing a Python web application, but it lets you focus on only the components you need for your project.\n\nFeatures:\n\nLightweight and flexible\n\nSupport for the Mako template language\n\nEasy authentication and authorization implementation\n\nWSGI-compliant request and response objects\n\nSimple testing and debugging with built-in testing helpers and an interactive debugger\n\nThird-party libraries and plugins with easy integration\n\n7. Tornado\n\nTornado is an open-source asynchronous web framework and networking library for building web applications using Python. It was originally developed at FriendFeed, a social media aggregator that was later acquired by Facebook. It’s now widely used in a variety of applications, including web services, real-time analytics, and other high-concurrency applications.\n\nTornado is optimized for handling a large number of simultaneous connections, making it suitable for applications that require a long-lived connection to each user (e.g., chat apps, bots, and web scrapers).\n\nFeatures:\n\nScalable (can handle thousands of open connections)\n\nCustom tornado templates\n\nBuilt-in user authentication\n\nWebSockets and long-polling capabilities\n\nThird-party authentication options\n\nInternationalization support\n\nGUI Frameworks\n\nThe following Python graphical user interface (GUI) frameworks provide a wide range of tools and features for creating desktop applications, including support for event-driven programming, widgets, and graphics.\n\n8. PyQt\n\nPyQt is one of the most popular sets of Python bindings for the Qt cross-platform application framework. This framework perfectly combines the simplicity of Python as a general-purpose language and the powerful Qt application framework built in C++.\n\nBear in mind that PyQt comes with two licensing options:\n\nGPLv3: Free to use, but anyone you distribute it to is able to redistribute it (probably for free)\n\nCommercial: Lets you keep your code private so you can monetize your work, but you’ll have to pay for a license for every developer that uses it (currently $550 per developer)\n\nFeatures:\n\nBacked by Riverbank\n\nEvent-driven programming for handling user interactions\n\nIntegration with other libraries and frameworks\n\nInternationalization and localization support\n\nAccess to a large number of functionalities from the Qt library\n\nSupport for multimedia, WebKit and WebEngine, database integration\n\nCross-platform compatibility with Windows, Linux, and macOS\n\n9. Tkinter\n\nTkinter is a built-in Python GUI framework. It’s part of the standard library, so you won’t have to install any additional dependencies.\n\nSimilar to PyQt (which uses Qt), Tkinter uses a graphical user interface toolkit called Tk. It also provides a set of tools for creating various widgets such as buttons, labels, text boxes, and menus.\n\nIn general, Tkinter is a great way to quickly create small GUI programs, but due to its outdated look and feel, you might be better off choosing a beefier framework for bigger projects.\n\nFeatures:\n\nSupport for common widgets used in GUI apps\n\nEvent-driven programming for handling user interactions\n\nBuilt-in support for images and colors\n\nCross-platform compatibility with Windows, Linux, and macOS\n\nPart of the standard library\n\nLightweight\n\n10. Kivy\n\nKivy is an open-source framework for creating cross-platform mobile and desktop applications with Python. It’s well suited for creating interactive and visually appealing applications, such as games and multi-touch applications, and its main sale point is one single codebase for every major platform (Windows, Linux, macOS, iOS, and Android).\n\nUnlike PyQt, Kivy is free and open-source, isn’t a wrapper around an external UI library, and is licensed under the MIT license, which means you can ship and monetize your Kivy apps.\n\nFeatures:\n\nOpen-source toolkit for creating multi-touch apps\n\nSupport for various platforms, including mobile and desktop\n\nBuilt-in support for graphics, animations, and UI elements\n\nCan be integrated with other libraries and frameworks\n\n11. PySide\n\nPyside is an open-source toolkit for creating multi-platform applications. It’s based on the Qt library (similar to PyQt) and provides access to a wide range of functionalities.\n\nPyside also supports multiple input methods and event-driven programming and includes built-in support for graphics and multimedia.\n\nBecause it’s licensed under LGPL you can create proprietary software more easily. It’s backed by the Qt company and supports Linux, macOS, and Windows.\n\nFeatures:\n\nLGPL licensed\n\nBacked by the Qt Company\n\nSupport for displaying images, videos, and other types of media in your application\n\nThree versions to use with Qt4, Qt5, and Qt6 respectively\n\n12. PySimpleGUI\n\nPySimpleGUI has been gaining popularity in the Python community for its simple and easy-to-use API.\n\nIt’s a great option for creating simple and easy-to-use graphical user interfaces in Python and allows you to add a GUI to your already working scripts pretty easily. PySimpleGUI wraps the power of 4 different GUI libraries, PySide, Tkinter, wxPython, and Remi.\n\nFeatures:\n\nGreat documentation\n\nSimple to learn and use\n\nFull set of ready-to-use widgets\n\nSupport for Python 3.4+\n\nPython Machine Learning Frameworks\n\nThe following are Python software libraries that provide pre-built functionality and tools to help developers build and deploy machine learning models, supporting common tasks such as data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, as well as tools for deploying models to production.\n\n13. scikit-learn\n\nscikit-learn is the most popular machine-learning library, being used both in the tech industry and in academia.\n\nIt provides efficient tools for common ML tasks, and it’s built on top of other scientific libraries like Numpy and SciPy.\n\nFeatures:\n\nFree and open source\n\nEfficient tools for data mining and data analysis\n\nProvides a wide range of algorithms for classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction\n\nActive community and development, with well-documented API and tutorials\n\n14.
