        "text": "Python is a top choice for #MLapplications and Data Scientists. It’s been around for 25 years but was noticed after Python use cases in scientific computing. A Statista report suggests almost 48.07% of developers use Python after JavaScript and HTML/CSS.\n\nPython development gains momentum because of its powerful libraries, data structures, community support, and frameworks. It is a performance-driven language perfectly used for web apps, game development, scientific and numeric computing, operating system, etc.\n\n10 Important Python Use Cases You Need to Know\n\nMore than 8.2 million developers are using #Pythonlanguage because of its dynamism. It makes debugging easy and encourages the rapid development of application prototypes. It marks its presence in different fields, as shown through different use cases of Python.\n\nWebsite Applications\n\nHire a Python developer who will help you understand what you must keep in mind when developing this use case of Python. Developers can create robust and scalable web apps using Python using the common back-end logic. It is used with frameworks like Pyramid, Flask, and Django.\n\nGet easy integration with protocols like SSI, HTTPS, etc., and support XML and JSON.\n\n2. Artificial Intelligence\n\nPython is a general-purpose language that made its way to this complex Python use case, Artificial Intelligence. Due to Python’s prebuilt libraries, less coding, easy learning, community support, etc., you can also use it for ML and deep learning.\n\nPython application development companies use this language to handle computation and build machine-learning models. It supports multiple AI solutions like image recognition, data processing, advanced computing, etc.\n\n3. Internet of Things\n\nIt is one of the best use cases for Python that connects hardware devices seamlessly. Regarding the Python best use cases for IoT, it implements the business logic straight to the device level.\n\nPython helps build high-performance IoT systems by combining the modern framework and protocol for data transfer. Developers use Raspberry Pi to perform high-level computations to turn normal objects into smart electronics.\n\n4. Game Development\n\nPython app development providers continuously implement this programming language for this use case Python. It has impacted the gaming industry majorly because of its power to handle complexities.\n\nThe popular Python frameworks used for game development are PyKyra, Pygame, PyOpenGL, Pyglet, Panda3D, Kivy, and Cocos2D. Battlefield 2 and Civilization IV game engines were built using Python, allowing easy customization.\n\n5. Enterprise Applications\n\nMost Python development services providers develop huge complex enterprise applications using Python. This use case in Python is secure and scalable and handles multiple database requests at once. The scalability and readability make Python the top choice for ERP too.\n\nTryton and Odoo are two frameworks provided by Python to develop ERP applications. It offers API advantages, too, as Python SDK can be integrated with third-party applications.\n\n6. Desktop GUI\n\nIt is one of the front-end #Pythonprogramming use cases and proves Python can also develop rich front-end graphical user interfaces. Tkinter library in Python helps design user interfaces.\n\nThe toolkits of Python, like Kivy, PyQT, PyGUI, etc., help design the user interface across multiple platforms. Being open-source, scalable, readable, and platform-independent, Python developer picks this language. It helps build high-quality GUIs.\n\n7. Operating System\n\nDo you know about Red Hat’s Anaconda, Fedora, and Ubuntu’s Ubiquity? Well, these two operating systems use one of these use cases for Python. Combined with C, these programming languages develop powerful operating systems.\n\nThe operating systems built using Python are running on billions of computers today. The easy-to-read and simple syntax will help coordinate on the front and help beginners work on sophisticated software.\n\n8. Script Writing And Automation\n\nThe best Python application development provider, BoTree Technologies, uses these Python scripting use cases to write scripts for text file parsing. It generates sample inputs to test the application, replaces Bash scripts, and scrapes content from websites and blogs.\n\nAfter using the frameworks and libraries, the #Pythonusecases for automation will help automate tasks like sending basic emails or deployments.
