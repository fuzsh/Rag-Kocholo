        "text": "TIOBE Index for August 2024\n\nAugust Headline: Python is chasing Java's TIOBE index records\n\nThis month, Python has a ranking of more than 18% for the first time in its history. The last time a language hit more than 18% was Java in November 2016. Java is also the language with the highest ranking ever: 26.49% in June 2001. Runner up C++ is now exactly 8% behind Python, and that difference between position #1 and position #2 is also almost a record. The highest difference ever between position #1 and position #2 was in November 2016 when Java was 9.55% ahead of C. In summary, Python's hegemony is now undeniable. It is likely that it is Python's next step to become the most popular programming language ever. Is there any new language expected to come close to Python soon? Possible contenders Rust and Kotlin are approaching the TIOBE index top 10 fast, but it will take a lot of time before they become a real threat to Python. --Paul Jansen CEO TIOBE Software\n\nThe TIOBE Programming Community index is an indicator of the popularity of programming languages. The index is updated once a month. The ratings are based on the number of skilled engineers world-wide, courses and third party vendors. Popular web sites Google, Amazon, Wikipedia, Bing and more than 20 others are used to calculate the ratings. It is important to note that the TIOBE index is not about the best programming language or the language in which most lines of code have been written.\n\nThe index can be used to check whether your programming skills are still up to date or to make a strategic decision about what programming language should be adopted when starting to build a new software system. The definition of the TIOBE index can be found here.\n\nAug 2024 Aug 2023 Change Programming Language Ratings Change 11Python18.04%+4.71%23C++10.04%-0.59%32C9.17%-2.24%44Java9.16%-1.16%55C#6.39%-0.65%66JavaScript3.91%+0.62%78SQL2.21%+0.68%87Visual Basic2.18%-0.45%912Go2.03%+0.87%1014Fortran1.79%+0.75%1113MATLAB1.72%+0.67%1223Delphi/Object Pascal1.63%+0.83%1310PHP1.46%+0.19%1419Rust1.28%+0.39%1517Ruby1.28%+0.37%1618Swift1.28%+0.37%179Assembly language1.21%-0.13%1827Kotlin1.13%+0.44%1916R1.11%+0.19%2011Scratch1.09%-0.13%\n\nOther programming languages\n\nThe complete top 50 of programming languages is listed below. This overview is published unofficially, because it could be the case that we missed a language. If you have the impression there is a programming language lacking, please notify us at tpci@tiobe.com.

Until 2010, \"(Visual) Basic\" referred to all possible dialects of Basic, including Visual Basic. After some discussion, it has been decided to split \"(Visual) Basic\" into all its dialects such as Visual Basic .NET, Classic Visual Basic, PureBasic, and Small Basic, just to name a few. Since Visual Basic .NET has become the major implementation of Visual Basic, it is now called \"Visual Basic\".\n\nThe programming language SQL was added to the TIOBE index in 2018 after somebody pointed out that SQL is Turing Complete. So although this language is very old, it has only a short history in the index.\n\nProgramming Language Hall of Fame\n\nThe hall of fame listing all \"Programming Language of the Year\" award winners is shown below. The award is given to the programming language that has the highest rise in ratings in a year."
