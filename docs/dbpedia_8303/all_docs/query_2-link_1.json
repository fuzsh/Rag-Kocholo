        "text": "Why is Python so Popular?\n\nPython is a dynamically typed, open-source language. It supports many programming models, including object-oriented, structured, and functional programming. The useful features that contribute to Python’s popularity are listed below:\n\nVersatility\n\nRapid development\n\nData processing\n\nCost-effectiveness\n\nEfficiency and reliability\n\nRobust frameworks and libraries\n\nVersatility\n\nPython is very flexible. It offers developers options to try something innovative. A person fluent in this language is free to create similar things, but they can also try to make something original. Those who prefer to work with cutting-edge technology might become adventurous in their projects just by learning this one language.\n\nRapid development\n\nPython’s simplicity allows the application development process to go faster. You spend less time building scripts because Python syntax is easier to understand than other languages. Also, Python doesn’t require you to define variables in advance because it is a dynamically typed language. You end up with a scalable, cross-platform mobile app that is also simple to maintain and debug, which helps you save a ton of time and effort.\n\nData processing\n\nMany companies use machine learning, big data, and cloud computing to modernize and enhance their workflows and processes. Python is the only language used for various data processing tasks in tech businesses. Thanks to its useable data arrangement and analysis simplicity, Python is used for research and development. Every day, numerous machine learning systems use many Python modules.\n\nCost-effectiveness\n\nPython application development is reasonably priced. This programming language is open-source and available without a license fee. A sizable developer community continuously supports, updates, and enhances this language. Also, it contains a sizable standard library that addresses the problems with installing third-party libraries for mobile apps made with Python.\n\nEfficiency and reliability\n\nPython can help practically anywhere. A developer won’t experience any performance reduction. It can be applied in various settings, including creating desktop Python based apps, mobile applications, hardware programs, and web applications. Due to its wide range of business applications, Python’s versatility makes it more compelling.\n\nRobust frameworks and libraries\n\nBecause of its sizable supportive community, Python has excellent libraries that developers can use to make choices and save time and effort during the first phases of project development. Many cloud media services offer cross-platform support via tools resembling libraries, which can be helpful. Frameworks aid apps made in Python to become straightforward, enabling native-looking and functioning applications.\n\nLearn more about the possibilities with Python development in our blog.\n\n3 Tech Giants Using Python\n\nEveryone knows the five most well-recognized tech brands or tech giants Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple, and Microsoft. Some of them build and run their systems using Python. Here are three top apps built with Python.\n\nAmazon\n\nGoogle\n\nFacebook\n\nAmazon\n\nAmazon is a major player in e-commerce, cloud computing, and media. It is the world’s largest company selling goods and services online. Amazon is expanding into e-commerce markets around the world. It is the company using Python to create the recommendation engine. The Python machine learning system uses a Hadoop database. Python is one of the most remarkable technologies for in-depth data analysis because it scales well.\n\nGoogle\n\nGoogle is a search engine market leader with a share of around 84.7 percent as of January 2023. Guido Van Rossum, the creator of Python, worked for Google from 2005 to 2012, demonstrating the significance of Python to the company. The company uses Python as one of its server-side languages, along with C++, Java, and Go. Google has chosen Python due to its ease of maintenance and readability.\n\nFacebook\n\nFormerly known as Facebook, Meta Platforms, Inc is an American social network conglomerate. Python makes up 21 percent of the codebase, making it a significant component of the Facebook technology stack. Python helps Facebook’s development team write less code. They also improved the consistency of the infrastructure and the app’s efficiency. Additionally, Python enables Facebook users to post updates, photos, and status updates.\n\nStreaming Services Using Python\n\nStreaming media allow users continuously receive media from a streaming provider over the Internet. Spotify and Netflix, two titans in the streaming services sector, are some of the best apps made in Python.\n\nSpotify\n\nSpotify is the largest music streaming service in the world, with annual sales of about $4 billion. It is one of the most popular apps made with Python among companies. Python’s advanced data analytics and rapid development pace influenced its decision to employ it. Python based application allows the company to control features like Radio and Explore, which depend entirely on the user’s musical preferences.\n\nNetflix\n\nNetflix is one of the world’s most popular video streaming services. Its revenue increased from 3.6 billion dollars a decade earlier to almost $31.6 billion in 2022. Python is becoming increasingly popular among Netflix developers due to its robust built-in standard library, and concise, clear, and expressive syntax. Moreover, Python has a big developer community and an abundance of third-party libraries to address specific issues.\n\nSoftware as a Service Using Python\n\nSaaS also has a broad spectrum of popular application which are designed using Python.
