        "text": "What\n\nPython is a widely-used, interpreted, object-oriented, and high-level programming language with dynamic semantics, used for general-purpose programming. It’s everywhere, and people use numerous Python-powered devices on a daily basis, whether they realize it or not.\n\nWho\n\nWhy\n\nPython is omnipresent, and people use numerous Python-powered devices on a daily basis, whether they realize it or not. There are billions of lines of code written in Python, which means almost unlimited opportunities for code reuse and learning from well-crafted examples. What’s more, there is a large and very active Python community, always happy to help.\n\nThere are also a couple of factors that make Python great for learning:\n\nIt is easy to learn – the time needed to learn Python is shorter than for many other languages; this means that it’s possible to start the actual programming faster;\n\nIt is easy to use for writing new software – it’s often possible to write code faster when using Python;\n\nIt is easy to obtain, install and deploy – Python is free, open and multiplatform; not all languages can boast that.\n\nProgramming skills prepare you for careers in almost any industry, and are required if you want to continue to more advanced and higher-paying software development and engineering roles. Python is the programming language that opens more doors than any other. With a solid knowledge of Python, you can work in a multitude of jobs and a multitude of industries. And the more you understand Python, the more you can do in the 21st Century. Even if you don’t need it for work, you will find it useful to know.\n\nWhere\n\nPython is the programming language that opens more doors than any other. With a solid knowledge of Python, you can work in a multitude of jobs and a multitude of industries. And even if you don’t need it for work, you will still find it useful to know to speed certain things up or develop a deeper understanding of other concepts.\n\nPython is a great choice for career paths related to software development, engineering, DevOps, machine learning, data analytics, web development, and testing. What's more, there are also many jobs outside the IT industry that use Python. Since our lives are becoming more computerized every day, and the computer and technology areas previously associated only with technically gifted people are now opening up to non-programmers, Python has become one of the must-have tools in the toolbox of educators, managers, data scientists, data analysts, economists, psychologists, artists, and even secretaries.\n\nPython goals\n\nIn 1999, Guido van Rossum defined his goals for Python:\n\nan easy and intuitive language just as powerful as those of the major competitors;\n\nopen source, so anyone can contribute to its development;\n\ncode that is as understandable as plain English;\n\nsuitable for everyday tasks, allowing for short development times.\n\n20+ years later, it is clear that all these intentions have been fulfilled. Some sources say that Python is the first-most popular programming language in the world, while others claim it’s the third.\n\nEither way, it occupies the first position in the top ten of the TIOBE Programming Community and PYPL PopularitY of Programming Language Indexes. (February 2022)\n\nPython isn’t a young language. It is mature and trustworthy. It’s not a one-hit wonder. It’s a bright star in the programming firmament, and time spent learning Python is a very good investment."
