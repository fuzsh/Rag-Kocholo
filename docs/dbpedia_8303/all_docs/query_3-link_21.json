There was a general consensus favoring BleachBit as the best open-source alternative to CCleaner, but other tools were also mentioned. Some users also cautioned against using registry cleaners and recommended using built-in Windows tools for cleaning and defragmenting drives.",

It is available as an installer as well as a portable application.\""
