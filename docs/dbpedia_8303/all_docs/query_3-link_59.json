Not sure how can an IT company take 6+ months to fix a bug.\n\nAll we use CCleaner cloud is to run a temp files cleanup everyday and run a defrag on the disk once a quarter. Group commands are a joke in CCleaner cloud, you cannot push commands to multiple computers at a time. You need to do manually for each computer.\n\nWe are now planning to move away from CCleaner and was wondering what other commercial software’s are available which are similar to CCleaner.\n\nAny other suggestions are welcome."
