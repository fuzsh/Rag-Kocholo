        "text": "Server-side web development includes the complex backend functions that websites perform to display information to the user. For example, websites must interact with databases, talk to other websites, and protect data when sending it over the network.\n\nPython is useful for writing server-side code because it offers many libraries that consist of prewritten code for complex backend functions. Developers also use a wide range of Python frameworks that provide all the necessary tools to build web applications faster and more easily. For example, developers can create the skeleton web application in seconds because they don’t need to write it from scratch. They can then test it using the framework’s testing tools, without depending on external testing tools.\n\nSoftware testing is the process of checking whether the actual results from the software match the expected results to ensure that the software is error-free.\n\nDevelopers use Python unit test frameworks, such as Unittest, Robot, and PyUnit, to test the functions they write.\n\nSoftware testers use Python to write test cases for various test scenarios. For example, they use it to test the user interface of a web application, multiple software components, and new features.\n\nDevelopers can use several tools to automatically run test scripts. These tools are known as Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) tools. Software testers and developers use CI/CD tools such as Travis CI and Jenkins to automate tests. The CI/CD tool automatically runs the Python test scripts and reports the test results whenever developers introduce new code changes."
