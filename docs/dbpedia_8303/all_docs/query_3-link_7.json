Things to look at on the system level are temporary files (just use tmpfs(5) for /tmp, or enable automatic cleanup on boot), and maybe left-over databases and other transient files (/var/db and other locations below /var) or configurations (/usr/local/etc) for software you removed. These are simple enough to find yourself if you really want to delete them.\n\nSo, all that's left is your user's home directory. It's much more accessible than e.g. the user part of Windows' \"registry\", just look out for dotfiles.\n\nAlso, always use srm with Guttman wipe instead of plain bland rm\n\nNow-a-days you can safely do that on SSDs as well.\n\nNo. Although it's very likely to overwrite all data, in presence of a wear-balancing drive firmware (also using spare cells), there can never be a guarantee.\n\nFor 100% peace of mind maintain access to large powerful magnets, an acid vat, a drill machine, heavy boulders and a thaumaturge on a retainer.\n\nFor 100% peace of mind, always apply full-disk encryption before ever using the drive. With spinning disks, overwrites with random data (no excessive passes needed) works, with SSDs with wear-balancing firmware, you can never be sure. But encrypted data without the key is just random noise for sure.\n\nFDE goes without saying. Was discussing a scenario wherein someone already has access and is digging through your now unlocked disk.\n\nAbout FDE - it's a shame the default FBSD installer only supports full-disk encryption and not full custom partition encryption using the guided installation wizard. That would really come handy for those who dual boot other OSes. BTW if what is the inode (UFS) equivalent for ZFS?\n\nNo. Although it's very likely to overwrite all data, in presence of a wear-balancing drive firmware (also using spare cells), there can never be a guarantee.\n\nFor 100% peace of mind, always apply full-disk encryption before ever using the drive.

Even without disk-ecryption there is boot-time without encryption.\n\nThis means disk-encryption is as vulnerable.\n\nSo just put encryption on your vulnerable data.\n\nYou are talking about evil-maid attack? Using /boot from the disk you encrypted is not wise.. must use an external medium.\n\nFollow-up question regarding UEFI.\n\n\".. Ideally each step of this process would involve a cryptographic handshake; boot1.efi would verify loader.efi which would in turn verify the kernel, thereby ensuring that only authorized code is run. Currently there is no support for these verifications. However, the goal of securely booting the kernel can still be achieved. \"\n\nFreeBSD UEFI Secure Boot | FreeBSD Foundation\n\n1. Introduction Secure boot provides a way to ensure that only authorized EFI binaries are loaded by a computer's firmware. This ensures that no malicious code can run before the operating system is loaded. This document describes one method of securing FreeBSD's boot process. FreeBSD's regular...\n\nIs this still the situation?\n\nI don't agree. Even without disk-ecryption there is boot-time without encryption.\n\nUhm what? You probably mean you'll (normally) have an unencrypted bootloader on the disk. On a modern FreeBSD system, that would be an ESP containing nothing but (stock) loader.efi(8)\n\nThis means disk-encryption is as vulnerable.\n\nThat makes no sense, unless you talk about offline attacks with physical access fiddling with that boot loader. A whole different topic (and even worse with just some encrypted files on your disk).\n\nSo just put encryption on your vulnerable data.\n\nA running system offers tons of possible leaks (swap, temporary files, ...). Only with FDE, you close them all. Apart from that, the topic was \"wiping\", which isn't reliably possible with modern SSDs. Throwing away the encryption key is reliable."
