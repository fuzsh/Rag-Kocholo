This programming language is used for the development of:\n\nquantitative finance analytics tools that operate on huge datasets\n\nbanking software e.g. mobile banking apps and platforms\n\nalgorithmic trading systems\n\ncryptocurrency solutions\n\nFor your understanding, let’s take an example that you can create a simple blockchain app using Python with the least lines of code. This is possible because the language is simple, minimalistic and there are many free ready-to-use Python packages for blockchain.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nPopular Frameworks for Python App Development\n\nWhat Type of Apps Can You Build in Python?\n\nAre These Apps The Reason for Python Popularity?\n\nOther Use Cases of Python Language\n\nPopular Applications Built Using Python\n\nConclusion\n\nFrequently Asked Questions about Python\n\nSo, let’s take the road of knowledge leading towards the answer regarding Python for app development and the kind of applications that can be built on it.\n\nPopular Frameworks for Python App Development\n\nMobile app development with python turns your app into a more versatile option as it has a powerful advantage of cross-platform app development. We will not dig deep into the frameworks but will provide you a rough idea. So, here is a list of frameworks to help you demystify developing mobile apps made with Python.\n\nWhat Type of Apps Can You Build in Python?\n\n1. Blockchain applications\n\nBlockchain, being one of the hottest trends of this decade in technology, has swept the market off its feet. From the developers’ point of view, Blockchain development is not as easy as shelling peas. However, apps made by Python have literally made it so. By employing Python frameworks like Flask, developers can use HTTP requests to interact with their blockchain over the Internet and create endpoints for distinct functions of blockchain. Developers are also able to run the scripts on multiple machines for developing a decentralized network – all with the help of Python.\n\n2. Command-line applications\n\nCommand-line applications and Console Applications are the same. It is a computer program created to be utilized from the command line or a shell and does not have any graphical UI. Python is deemed as a suitable language for such applications because of its Read-Eval-Print-Loop (REPL) feature which enables developers to evaluate the language and identify new possibilities.\n\nSince Python is a popular language globally, top app development companies have access to a sea of free Python libraries that they can use for building command-line apps.\n\n3. Audio and Video applications\n\nMobile app development with python helps in creating music and other types of audio and video applications. Since the internet is loaded with audio and video content, you can use Python for analyzing it all. Some Python libraries like PyDub and OpenCV also help in the successful completion of the app development.\n\nYouTube is one of the apps that is built with Python. So, you can easily surmise now how effective and incredible this language is in delivering apps with high performance.\n\n4. Game app development\n\nFor all the gaming enthusiasts, many games such as EVE Online and Battlefield 2 have been created using Python. The Battlefield 2 game employs Python for all of its add-ons and functionalities and the World of Tanks game uses it for the majority of its features. In fact, Disney’s Pirates of the Carribean game was written with the help of the Panda 3D game engine – whose game development language is Python.\n\nDevelopers are given the facility to create a rapid game prototype and Python can be used to test them in real-time. Additionally, Python in game development can be used to create game designing tools that assist in many tasks of the development process, namely, creating dialog trees and level designing.\n\n5. System administration applications\n\nSystem Administration applications are a savior for the management, to say the least.\n\nMobile app development with Python is regarded fit for creating system administration apps as it allows developers to easily communicate with the operating system. It enables developers to interface with the OS on which Python is currently running. This language makes all the IO operations accessible which includes simple reading and writing to the file system.\n\n6. Machine learning applications\n\nAnother inspiring tech trend of this decade is Machine learning development. Machine learning is an algorithm technology that feeds data to operating systems and enables them to make intelligent decisions. Before creating applications of machine learning was a tricky task, but now we have Python mobile app development for machine learning applications.\n\nPython comes loaded with libraries like Pandas and Scikit for machine learning that are available in the market for free and can be used under GNU license.\n\nWith the basic knowledge of Python mobile app development, developers can create machine learning apps with the help of these highly competent and effective libraries.\n\n7. Business applications\n\nApplication made by Python highly supports practical agility, This is why Python also assists in ERP and E-Commerce app development solutions.\n\nOdoo, an all-in-one management software is written in Python and provides a wide range of business apps forming a suite of business management apps. One of the known applications built with Python is Tryton, which is a three-tier general-purpose and high-level application. It is so easy to create such apps with Python which is why app development companies choose it.\n\nAre These Apps The Reason for Python Popularity?\n\nAccording to the TIOBE Programming Community index for July 2020, Python language is in the third position among the top 20 programming languages used by skilled engineers around the globe.\n\nThe reason why python mobile app development is so popular is because it provides various benefits to different apps. Thus, we can say that the above applications play some role for Python’s popularity.\n\nSome of the benefits are listed below.\n\nIt is a versatile, efficient and reliable programming language.\n\nPython web app development is much faster than most modern languages.\n\nPython’s code is easy to read, understand and learn.\n\nIt is compatible with numerous operating systems.\n\nIt facilitates test-driven app development.\n\nHundreds of Python libraries and frameworks are available for developers.\n\nIt gives excellent cross-platform support.\n\nPython supports Big Data, Machine Learning & Cloud Computing.\n\nIt has a strong supportive community and corporate sponsors.\n\nOther Use Cases of Python Language\n\n1. Web and Software development\n\nSince Python has a code that is very simple and easy to understand, this uncomplicates the web and Software development services, making the process more efficient. Another charming feature of Python is its compatibility to integrate with other languages, making it a more flexible option.\n\nSome effective frameworks like Django and Pyramid assist the developers in software development for an app using Python and enable them to create web apps from scratch. The standard library of Python web app development also supports numerous internet protocols including XML, JSON, and HTML. Instagram is one such application created with Django.\n\n2. Image processing and OCR\n\nPython has this amazing ability of object detection and Image processing. With the help of a wide range of Python libraries such as PyTesseract for OCR (Optical Character Recognition), TensorFlow for object detection and the Python Imaging Library (PIL) for Image processing, it has become highly efficient for developers to create apps made with Python having self-contained deep learning and Computer Vision capabilities.\n\n3. Automated testing\n\nWhen it comes to Automated Testing, Python is the language of choice. Automated testing is the process of execution of the apps’ features using a script rather than a human being. In this regard, Python along with Selenium (a web-based automation tool) provides a plethora of libraries and tools to perform automated tests. These tools are also known as CI/CD tools acronymous of “Continuous Integration” and “Continuous Deployment” and can run the tests, compile and publish applications along with deploying them into production.\n\n4. Web crawlers\n\nWeb Crawlers, also known as Spiderbot, are typically used to make a duplicate copy of all the visited pages of the world wide web for later preparation by a search engine.
