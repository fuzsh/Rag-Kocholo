You're following in the footsteps of many great programmers when you create this project.\n\nTo create your Hello World! program, follow these steps:\n\nOpen your Start menu and choose Python (command line).\n\nYou should get a prompt that looks like >>>.\n\nAt the moment, you're doing everything in interactive mode in the Python interpreter. That's where the >>> comes in. Python shows you >>> when you're supposed to type something.\n\nAt the prompt, type the following. Use a single quote at the start and the end â it's beside the Enter key:\n\nprint('Hello World!')\n\nPress the Enter key.\n\nPython runs the code you typed.\n\nYou see the output shown in Figure 1. Congratulations â you've written your first program. Welcome to the Python-programmers-in-training club.\n\nFigure 1: Your Hello World! program is ready for more instructions.\n\nCheck that the parentheses and single quotes are in the right places.\n\nCheck that for each opening parenthesis there is a closing parenthesis. (Otherwise, you're left hanging.\n\nCheck that for each opening quote there's a closing quote.\n\nProgramming languages have their own grammar and punctuation rules. These rules are the language's syntax. Humans, can work most stuff out even if perfect not you're is grammar (See? You figured out what that sentence was trying to say), but Python pretty much freaks out if you get the syntax wrong.\n\nAbout This Article\n\nThis article is from the book:\n\nPython For Kids For Dummies ,\n\nAbout the book author:\n\nBrendan Scott is a dad who loves Python and wants kids to get some of its magic too. He started pythonforkids.brendanscott.com to help teach his oldest child to code. He maintains it to help other young people learn Python.\n\nThis article can be found in the category:\n\nPython ,"
