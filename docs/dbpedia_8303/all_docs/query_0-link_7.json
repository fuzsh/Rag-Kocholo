Normally you could take the Firefox CleanerML file and tweak the paths, but Firefox is the last cleaner that is written in Python, so the choices are either to do it in Python (which requires extra skills) or sort of start over in CleanerML.\n\nThe good news is someone started it (see pale_moon.xml), though it is not complete or up to date."
