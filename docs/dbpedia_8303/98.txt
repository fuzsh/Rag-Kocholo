An older version (0.6.4?) was ported to NetBSD and many or all of the changes were taken upstream, but the NetBSD porter didn't seem to continue it. As stated, BleachBit is written in Python and PyGTK. There may be minimal changes to the Python code, and maybe some in the CleanerML (mostly XML) which defines which files should be cleaned.

If you have any issues, best to ask in an OpenBSD forum or on the BleachBit forum.
