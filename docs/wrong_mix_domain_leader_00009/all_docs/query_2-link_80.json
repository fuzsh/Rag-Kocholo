        "text": "A bit of a longer post, but WOW, was it an exciting last few days! Recently, Students Consulting for Non Profit Organizations - Ohio State, had the chance to embark on our annual Chicago site visit, and quite honestly, the trip was nothing short of breathtaking! Over the course of three days, we were so fortunate to have some amazing experiences that helped showcase the talent of SCNO, and the opportunities that come from The Ohio State University Fisher College of Business! We started our trip on Wednesday at Salesforce, where we had a chance to meet with SCNO alum Shane Ross, and learn more about how technology firms have a wide breadth of opportunities (While also taking in the amazing views of Chicago from the Salesforce Tower)! Then, on Thursday, we kicked off with Huron, hosted by Elizabeth Entinghe! Everyone in SCNO had a wonderful time speaking with former Ohio State alumni on a panel including Swathi Vudatala, Patricia Myton, Ryan Edmiston, Noelle Bruno, and Sarah M.! Plus, we were so fortunate to visit with Huron's CEO, Mark Hussey, who shared his advice on leadership and motivating people! From there, we joined forces with Buckeye Undergraduate Consulting Club, and moved over to Crowe's stunning brand new office space! Amanda Leonard, Abbi Feeley, and Allison Stettler were all gracious enough to share more about Crowe, and the variety of projects available in consulting! The day didn't end there, however, because we made one more stop at Bain & Company, for a visit with Sumitro Chakravarti, Katie Gordon, Lauren Nichols, Jacob Auvil, Pat Mulligan, Marcus Tenenbaum, Brad J. Rollins, and Jennifer (Linker) Jacobs, all of whom showcased their experiences at Bain. We were also incredibly lucky to have a very insightful discussion about balance and motivation within consulting! And last, but certainly not least, we made a stop at Deloitte, to explore both their commercial and government consulting arms. Sailor Seguine-Hall took the lead on coordinating the visit, but it also was made possible by Shaun Loftin, Sarah Laubach, Jake Koch, Hayden Baer (He/Him), Matthew Haight, Eli Giterman, Erin Cheung, RHIA, and Resha Panda, RHIA. All in all, it was a pretty amazing trip that would not have been possible without the planning, hard work, and dedication on Kara Abney, Darshita Bajoria, and Joseph Piehowicz! The best is yet to come for consulting at Fisher, and I feel very humbled to play a small part in it!\n\nLast Friday, Justin Vescera, Sasha Haines, and I had the incredible opportunity to help lead the second-annual McKinsey & Company X The Ohio State University Fisher College of Business Case Challenge! 50 Students (all signing up in less than two and a half minutes) had a chance to present to a panel of McKinsey judges and receive tailored feedback based on a specialized business case! After an absolutely incredible day, teams from Students Consulting for Non Profit Organizations - Ohio State, Delta Sigma Pi-Nu Chapter , and Buckeye Undergraduate Consulting Club finished in the Top 3! Everyone who participated should be incredibly proud of the week's worth of work they put in. The event certainly served to showcase the consulting and analytical thinking skills within Fisher! Great moments are the work of many, and this case challenge would not have been possible without the support of some amazing people! From the judges, including Christopher Scott, Ziqi Chen, Andrew Shin, Charlie Baca, Greta Warmbier, and Geoffrey Gao, to those like Katie Passen who aided with event logistics, I was super lucky to work with some amazing people! I already can't wait for next year! Cheers to the future of consulting in Fisher!"
