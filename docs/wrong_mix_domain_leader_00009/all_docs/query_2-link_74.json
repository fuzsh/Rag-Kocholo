        "text": "June 8, 2006\n\nGranger Says Killing al-Zarqawi Huge Victory in War on Terror; Sign that Iraq will Not Tolerate Terrorism\n\nWASHINGTON, D.C.-Congresswoman Kay Granger (R-Fort Worth) today praised Iraqi and U.S. Forces for the successful intelligence gathering and subsequent bombing raid that led to the death of al-Qaeda terrorist leader in Iraq, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. Zarqawi, one of the most wanted terrorists in Iraq and the War on Terror, was responsible for the planning of hundreds of attacks that led to the deaths of American and Iraqi civilians.\n\n\"The death of terrorist Abu Musab al-Zarqawi is a major blow to al-Qaeda in Iraq and a major victory for Iraqis and Coalition Forces in Iraq and in the War on Terror,\" said Congresswoman Granger. \"His death sends a clear message to terrorists in Iraq and in the region: Terrorism in Iraq will not be tolerated. Individuals who participate in acts of terrorism will be hunted down and arrested or killed.\""
