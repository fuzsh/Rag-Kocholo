Mao said publicly, on the 14 February anniversary of the Sino-Soviet treaty, that if the \"imperialists start a war of aggression, we, together with the people of the whole world, will certainly wipe them from the face of the earth.\" This statement Peiping's current propaganda on nuclear weapons has been greatly expanded in recent weeks It expresses the view that a predominantly agrarian country like China would be less vulnerable to such weapons than would the United States and United Kingdom. At the same time Peiping has indicated some ap- prehension, and its line has apparently been designed in large part to mobilize international pressure to deter the United States from using nuclear weapons li Mar 55 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE BULLETIN Page 4 Ap15i~ e1For Releas 2002/10/21 0 - AO01900230001-5 25X1A Approved For le ease 2002/10/21 : CIA-RDP79T00975 01900230001-5 25X1 NEAR EAST - AFRICA 4. Britain and Iraq hope to conclude new defense arrangements by 2May?. Britain is making every effort to meet Iraq's target date of 2 May for the termi- nation of the present Anglo-Iraqi treaty and the completion of new defense ar- rangements according to the Foreign Office. Iraqi's premier Nuri Said has proposed that the new arrangements provide for joint training of military forces, reciprocal staging rights, British technicians at Iraqi airfields, and flying of the Iraqi flag over the fields. He has suggested that these arrangements be effected by British acces- sion to the Turkish-Iraqi pact, signature of a brief new agree- ment containing nothing which might antagonize extreme national- ists in Iraq, and an exchange of secret notes containing those provisions most likely to-disturb the nationalists. Comment: The new arrangements will probably also include a provis on Tor stationing British planes at Iraqi airfields. Currently Britain has three fighter squadrons and a photo reconnaissance squadron at two fields in Iraq. 11 Mar 55 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE BULLETIN Page 5 25X1A Approved For Releas - 001900230001-5 25X1A the military arrangements now being discussed by Defense Minis- ter Azm with Egypt and Saudi Arabia, Egyptian troops might be stationed in Syria, ostensibly to protect, but in reality to control, the country. Atasi declared that if the time has come for Syria to align itself with another country, that country should be Iraq bec.use of their common boundary, common cultural backgrounds and complementary economies. The president's son, stressing his father's preference for Iraqi over Egyptian troops in Syria, said that their entrance into the country, while hard to defend legally, could be regularized after the fact. Comment.- The Syrian conservatives, led by. Atasi, are desperately looking or a means .to overthrow the leftist government of Premier Asali in order to regain power. A move to bring Iraqi troops into Syria would have serious repercussions in the Near East. None of the other Arab states is in a position to counter such a move with ef- fective military force. Israel is bitterly opposed to an Iraqi-Syrian union, but would hesitate to resort to war over it. LATIN AMERICA 6.

Ibanez himself stated last year that if Congress did not grant his request for special powers, he might dissolve it and rule by decree. He did not carry out this threat, however, and is believed still reluctant to abandon constitutional procedures. Any \"government of .forcers would almost certainly require army support, which in the early stages would probably be forthcoming. The current commander in chief of the army, General Enrique Franco Hidalgo, has not shown any per- sonal political ambition, but is popular within. Chile and is friendly to the United States. 11 Mar 55 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE BULLETIN Page 7 25X1A Approved For Release 2002/10/21 : CIA-RDP79T00975AO01900230001-5"
