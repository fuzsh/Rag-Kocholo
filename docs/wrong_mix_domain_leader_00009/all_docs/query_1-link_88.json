        "text": "I. Summary\n\nA crisis of serious proportions is brewing in northern Iraq, and may soon explode into open violence.Since 1975, the former Iraqi government forcibly displaced hundreds of thousands of Kurds, Turkomans, and Assyrians from their homes, and brought in Arab settlers to replace them, under a policy known as \"Arabization.\"With the overthrow of that government in April 2003, the Kurds and other non-Arabs began returning to their former homes and farms.Ethnic tensions between returning Kurds and others and the Arab settlers escalated rapidly and have continued to do so, along with tensions between the different returning communities-particularly between Kurds and Turkomans-over control of the oil-rich city of Kirkuk. In the absence of a speedy implementation of plans to address the conflicting land and property claims and the needs of the different communities, ownership disputes may soon be settled through force.\n\nIn the context of negotiations over the political future of Iraq and the handover of sovereignty to the Iraqi Interim Government (IIG) by the U.S.-led Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) on June 28, 2004, the Kurdish leadership pressed for a number of demands that would consolidate the gains they have made in areas under their control since 1991 as well as realize some of their other long-standing political aspirations.Some of these demands have direct bearing on the future of the hundreds of thousands of victims of Arabization, and are in line with what the Kurdish leadership sees as a historic opportunity to reverse the consequences of what was, in effect, an ethnic cleansing campaign conducted by successive Iraqi governments over several decades.They include a determination of the future status of the city of Kirkuk, which is linked to a return to pre-Arabization administrative boundaries in the relevant governorates; the right of all internally displaced persons to reclaim, and return to, their original homes; and the removal of all Arabs brought from other parts of the country for the purpose of altering the demographic makeup of the northern region.Some of these demands are shared by other ethnic communities that also suffered Arabization - the Turkomans and to a lesser extent the Assyrians but are at variance on crucial points.\n\nWhat does unite all the parties concerned is the wish to see past injustices redressed, particularly through a fair mechanism for the settlement of property disputes which lie at the heart of the problem.Resolving these disputes in a timely, fair, and effective manner involves a highly complex operation, which may take years to complete, but on which hinges the ability to diffuse ethnic tensions which are close to a breaking point.The Iraq Property Claims Commission, which was established by law in January 2004, more than eight months after the cessation of major hostilities, has yet to become operational.Moreover, the law fails to address the burning issue of what is to become of the so-called Arabization Arabs, in particular whether they will have the right to choose their place of residence following the resolution of property disputes.They, in a real sense, have become the latest victims of internal displacement.\n\nSince at least the 1930s, successive Iraqi administrations have attempted to change the ethnic make-up of northern Iraq by expelling Kurds, Turkomans, and Assyrians from their homes and repopulating the areas with Arabs moved from central and southern Iraq.Arabization first occurred on a massive scale in the second half of the 1970s, following the creation by the Iraqi government of an autonomous zone in parts of Iraqi Kurdistan. During that period, some 250,000 Kurds and other non-Arabs were expelled from a huge swath of northern Iraq, ranging from Khanaqin on the Iranian border all the way to Sinjar on the Syrian-Turkish border were forcibly displaced. These comprised entire families, including women and children. Simultaneously, the Iraqi government brought in landless Arabs and their families from the nearby al-Jazeera desert to farm the former Kurdish lands.The land titles of the Kurds and other non-Arabs were invalidated.The land was declared government land, but was leased on annual contracts only to the new Arab farmers. However, they did not receive freehold title to the lands.\n\nIn 1988, the Iraqi government launched the Anfal campaign against the Kurds, killing some 100,000 Kurds and destroying many of their villages, which left hundreds of thousands of Kurds homeless.Although the aims of the Anfal campaign was not Arabization-the aim was genocide-in its aftermath Kurds were not allowed to return to their destroyed villages.Their property rights, too, were invalidated, and Arabs were brought to settle and farm some of their lands.\n\nThe policy of Arabization continued right up to the fall of Saddam Hussein's government in April 2003.Kurds and other non-Arabs in Kirkuk faced constant harassment, and were forced to choose between immediate expulsion or joining the Ba`th Party, changing their ethnic identity (commonly referred to as \"nationality correction\") to Arab, and \"volunteering\" for paramilitary forces such as the Jerusalem Army (Jaysh al-Quds).Families who refused to comply were issued expulsion orders requiring them to leave their homes and were then expelled to the Kurdish-controlled areas.The government of Iraq expelled approximately 120,000 persons from Kirkuk and other areas under Iraqi government control during the 1990s in furtherance of its Arabization policies.Arabs were encouraged to settle in the north through financial incentives and subsidized home prices.\n\nThe impact of three decades of forced displacement and Arabization has been immense.U.N.-Habitat counted a total of 805,505 displaced persons living in the Kurdish governorates of Arbil, Duhok, and Sulaimaniyya in 2001. Arabization, as a policy of forced transfer of populations, constituted a crime against humanity, and the victims of that policy have a right to return to their homes or be compensated.However, the rights of the victims of Arabization must be implemented in a manner that does not cause additional human rights abuses against the ethnic Arab populations who settled in the north. Fair and impartial procedures are needed to determine the status of claims and the rights of individuals. Special efforts may be necessary in order to guarantee that returning women, including but not limited to heads of households, are able to exercise their property and inheritance rights. It will also be important to ensure that property restitution rights not be restricted to owners of housing or other property but also address the rights of tenants, cooperative residents, and other tenure groups.\n\nThe situation in northern Iraq changed drastically during the 2003 conflict.A large number of Arab settlers and their families left their homes well in advance of the arrival of Kurdish and U.S. forces, leaving many of the Arabized villages empty.For the Arab settler families, the war was a devastating blow, leaving them homeless often after living for decades in the Arabized villages.For the moment, many of these villages remain empty.The judicial mechanism to determine claims to properties has not yet become operational, and many Kurds displaced from their villages through Arabization are simply too poor to rebuild their homes or even pay for the trip to their villages without assistance.\n\nIn most cities like Kirkuk and Mosul, as well as towns such as Khanaqin and Sinjar, many Arab settlers chose to remain, explaining they had property deeds to their homes.Tensions in these urban areas run high, as returning Kurds and other non-Arabs attempt to reclaim their property.In some places, particularly in Kirkuk and Khanaqin, some Kurdish officials have attempted to expel Arab residents through threats and intimidation and seize their homes for redistribution among Kurdish Peshmerga fighters and the families of slain fighters.[1]\n\nIn light of the tremendous pressures Kurdish leaders face from their displaced and victimized constituents who are demanding redress, the Kurdish leadership has shown a clear commitment to preventing mass retaliation.In contrast to similar conflicts where formerly victimized populations seize control-the situation of Kosovar Albanians following the NATO war is a close analogy-few acts of retaliation and no massacres were committed by Kurdish forces.At the same time, Kurdish leaders remain committed to their declared policy that Arabization must be reversed completely and that Arabs who came north during the Arabization period must leave, thereby setting themselves up for a major confrontation in the future.\n\nThe lack of widespread retaliation killings and other serious human rights abuses by Kurdish forces should not obscure the underlying reality of a dramatic change in power relations in northern Iraq.Arab families are almost completely powerless in the face of Kurdish forces, which were among the few militias in Iraq to have been allowed by U.S. and coalition forces to retain their arms.Serious intimidation of Arab families by Kurdish officials has taken place in areas where Peshmerga forces of both the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) began deploying following the fall of the former Iraqi government.\n\nThe U.S.-led Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) failed to address the rising tensions in northern Iraq, and to implement a strategy to resolve the claims and needs of the different communities in northern Iraq.When the CPA was formally dissolved on June 28, 2004, more than a year after the fall of the government of Iraq, the mechanism to resolve competing property claims had yet to become operational. The necessary legislation was initially promulgated in January 2004, but only finalized on June 24, 2004, just days before the handover of formal governing authority to the IIG, and the humanitarian needs of displaced persons-Kurds as well as Arabs, women and children as well as men-meanwhile went largely unmet.\n\nEqually dismal has been the failure of the Kurdish leadership to put in place a coordinated and unified policy for dealing with the expected influx of displaced Kurdish and other families into Kirkuk and other areas, particularly with regard to their humanitarian needs.There were reports of Kurds being compelled to return to the Kirkuk area against their will.Hundreds of thousands of others are waiting to return to their homes and farms, and their patience is quickly running out.A large number of Arab families were forced to flee their homes during the 2003 conflict. At present, these internally displaced Arabs have no recourse to determine their rights.\n\nSignificantly, many of the Arab settlers interviewed by Human Rights Watch in the months following the fall of the former government indicated that they recognized the Kurdish claims to their properties.Many told Human Rights Watch that they were willing to give up their homes in Arabized villages in return for humanitarian assistance in finding new homes and livelihoods for their families.The willingness of the Arab settlers to seek compromise perhaps offered great hope of peacefully resolving the crisis in northern Iraq.\n\nOver time, with no tangible steps having been taken to resolve property disputes, and with mounting tensions and deteriorating security conditions in Kirkuk and its environs, attitudes on all sides have hardened considerably.More than one year on, it has become doubly difficult to find a just and peaceful resolution to the many competing claims.Both coalition and Kurdish officials alike must be held responsible for the lack of both pre-war and immediate post-war planning. .As one CPA official told Human Rights Watch, \"We missed an opportunity to put something in place that would inspire confidence.\"\n\nThe crisis of displacement and conflicting property claims in northern Iraq is potentially one of massive proportions, and can only be resolved through resolute action by the international community.As of July 2004, it is far from clear that the Iraq Property Claims Commission will provide the resolution mechanism needed to adjudicate property disputes in a manner that is expedient, accessible, fair, and impartial.The success of any property resolution process will also require a massive humanitarian response to meet the housing and living needs of these newly displaced families as well as the equally needy Kurds and others in northern Iraq who are attempting to return to their homes.\n\nII. Recommendations\n\nTo the Iraqi Interim Government\n\nEnsure that the Iraq Property Claims Commission (IPCC) takes up the adjudication of property claims at the earliest possible time, in a manner that is non-discriminatory, fair, and efficient, and in accordance with international due process standards.\n\nEnsure that all necessary resources are in place to deal promptly with the expected large number of claims.\n\nEnsure that law enforcement resources are sufficient to enforce property restitution judgments in a manner consistent with international human rights standards.\n\nEnsure that property records are freely accessible to displaced persons.\n\nConduct a campaign to disseminate as widely and as effectively as possible, in Iraq and in countries with sizeable Iraqi refugee populations, all necessary information about property restitution rights and procedures for submitting a property claim.\n\nEnsure that there is a durable and equitable resettlement solution for Arab families displaced or to be displaced as part of the property claims resolution process, a solution that does not render them homeless and recognizes their right to choose their place of residence without coercion.\n\nEnsure that property claims resolution mechanisms and resettlement programs fully address the rights of returnee women to full equality with regard to housing, property, and land restitution, in particular in terms of access, control, ownership, and inheritance rights.\n\nEnsure that the housing restitution rights of tenants and other tenure groups as well as owners are addressed.\n\nEnsure access to legal counsel for all persons affected by the property claims resolution mechanisms.\n\nEnsure that property restitution rights extend to heirs of original owners, and clarify that claims are not rendered void due to the passage of time.\n\nEnsure that compensation provided in resolving property claims is reasonable in relation to the damage suffered by the victim of displacement and/or illegal property confiscation.\n\nReview and where necessary amend existing legislation to ensure compliance with international standards regarding the rights of refugee and displaced persons to return to their homes and/or receive compensation for illegal confiscation or destruction of their property.\n\nIncorporate the principles of the Iraqi Property Claims Commission Statute into domestic legislation.\n\nTo the principal Kurdish, Turkoman, and Assyrian political parties:\n\nUrge communities and constituencies to exercise restraint and refrain from exercising force or threats of force to repossess claimed property.\n\nDiscourage further returns of internally displaced persons (IDPs) to former places of residence until property claims are processed.\n\nCoordinate provision of humanitarian assistance to IDPs who have returned to places of origin but are living in dire or makeshift conditions.\n\nEnsure that there are no further forced expulsions of Arabs who benefited from the former government's Arabization campaign, in particular by the Peshmerga or other party militias.\n\nTo the member states of the U.S.-led coalition and the international donor community\n\nProvide humanitarian assistance for those returning or newly displaced persons currently living without adequate shelter, physical security, or access to basic needs.\n\nProvide assistance to the new government of Iraq to repair damaged housing and to construct or subsidize construction of adequate, affordable, and accessible housing for returning displaced persons and refugees whose homes have been destroyed or are no longer accessible, and for persons displaced by the property restitution process.\n\nEnsure adequate funding and resources for the effective operation of the Iraq Property Claims Commission, including the protection and re-establishment of housing and property records.\n\nIII. Background: Forced Displacement and Arabization of Northern Iraq\n\nThe Mass Displacement of the mid-1970s\n\nSince the 1930s, but particularly from the 1970s onwards, successive Iraqi administrations have forcibly displaced hundreds of thousands of ethnic Kurds, Turkomans (a Turkish-speaking Iraqi minority), and Assyrians from northern Iraq, and repopulated the area with Arabs moved from central and southern Iraq.[2]This policy, known as \"Arabization\" (ta'rib) was conducted in order to consolidate government control over the valuable oil resources and arable lands located in northern Iraq.The massive forced displacement of Kurdish families from northern Iraq is not synonymous with Arabization, as armed conflict and the genocidal Anfal campaign of 1988 also accounted for large numbers of displaced Kurds.But even when Kurds were displaced by armed conflict or the Anfal campaign, the Iraqi government often ensured that their displacement became permanent and brought in Arab settlers to take over their homes.For the hundreds of thousands of Kurds displaced from their homes by Arabization, armed conflict, and genocide in Iraq, their continued displacement represents a crime that must be redressed.\n\nThe first massive wave of forced displacement in northern Iraq followed the 1974 unilateral declaration by the Iraqi government of a Kurdistan Autonomous Region covering the northern governorates of Arbil, Sulaimaniyya, and Dohuk.The area comprised some 14,000 square miles but included only half of the land area claimed by Iraq's Kurds, and excluded the oil-rich lands around the city of Kirkuk.In the wake of the 1974 autonomy decree, the Ba'th Party embarked on the Arabization of the oil-producing areas around Khanaqin, evicting Kurdish farmers and replacing them with Arab tribal families from southern Iraq.Tens of thousands of villagers from the Barzani tribe were also forcibly removed from their homes following the collapse in 1975 of the Kurdish revolt, led by Mulla Mustafa Barzani.The villagers were relocated to barren sites in the southern deserts, where they had to rebuild their lives from scratch.By the late 1970s, the Iraqi government had forcibly evacuated as least a quarter of a million Kurdish men, women, and children from areas bordering Iran and Turkey.Their villages were destroyed to create a cordon sanitaire along these sensitive frontiers, and the inhabitants relocated to settlements built for that purpose located on the main highways in army-controlled areas of Iraq Kurdistan.[3]\n\nThe scale of the displacement of Kurds in the north during the mid-1970s was immense, displacing the entire Kurdish population from an area reaching from the town of Khanaqin, close to the Iranian border, to the Syrian and Turkish border areas around Sinjar.Many Kurdish villages were bulldozed, and new Arab settlements were built nearby.The bureaucratic nature of the Iraqi state makes it possible to reconstruct the scale of the displacement, as many of the landownership records of the pre-Arabization period still exist.The decrees passed by the Ba`th government in implementation of its Arabization policy also exist, as do detailed records of the Arab families that were brought to inhabit the vacated areas.An official of the Agricultural Department in Shaikhan district, located in Mosul governorate (renamed Nineveh by the Iraqi government), listed forty-six originally Kurdish and Yazidi villages that had been Arabized in the 1970s.[4]\n\nTens of thousands of displaced men, women, and children fled into Iran.Most returned to Iraqi Kurdistan after the establishment of Kurdish self-rule in the aftermath of the 1991 Gulf War, but were unable to return to their original villages located outside Kurdish-controlled areas.The majority of the displaced Kurdish population were expelled or fled to the Kurdish Autonomous Region, or were resettled in the large-scale \"complexes\" or \"collective villages\" built by the Iraqi government.Others were forcibly settled far away in central and southern Iraq, often in majority Sunni towns that formed the backbone of support for Ba`th Party rule. When Human Rights Watch researchers visited the Sunni towns of al-Ramadi and al-Falluja in April and May 2003 respectively, they found entire neighborhoods of desperately poor Kurds who had been forcefully displaced from their homes in the north since the mid-1970s, and had never been allowed to return home.\n\nThe 1988 Anfal Campaign\n\nDuring the 1980-88 war between Iraq and Iran, the Kurdish Peshmerga reconstituted itself, with backing from Iran. Towards the end of the Iran-Iraq war, from February 23 until September 6, 1988, the Iraqi government launched its Anfal campaign against the Kurds, under the direction of 'Ali Hassan al-Majid, a cousin of Saddam Hussein who earned the nickname \"Chemical Ali\" for his use of chemical weapons against Kurds in northern Iraq.The Anfal campaign reached genocidal proportions, resulting in the \"disappearance\" of some 100,000 Kurds, whose bodies are now being recovered in mass graves located across Iraq.During the Anfal campaign, the Iraqi government destroyed between 3,000 and 4,000 Kurdish villages and towns, displacing hundreds of thousands of Kurds.Some of the displaced Kurds were settled in army-guarded \"collective settlements,\" while others were deported to southern Iraq or fled to neighboring states, notably Iran.The Anfal operation devastated Iraqi Kurdistan, leaving the entire region in ruin and a large proportion of the population displaced.\n\nThe genocidal nature of the Anfal campaign made it drastically different from the earlier and later Arabization campaigns.However, for the displaced Kurds, the impact of the Anfal campaign was similar.After the 1991 Gulf War (see below), Kurdish villagers displaced during the Anfal campaign were able to return to many destroyed villages that were within the zone controlled by Kurdish forces.However, some villages destroyed during the Anfal fell outside that zone for example parts of Makhmour district and displaced Kurds were unable to return to those areas.\n\nThe Repopulation of the North with Arab Tribes\n\nThe methods used by the Iraqi government to effect the forced displacements of the 1970s and 1980s involved first and foremost military force and intimidation: entire Kurdish villages were completely depopulated and bulldozed by Iraqi forces.But the Iraqi government followed up the brutality with legal decrees aimed at consolidating the displacement.First, the property deeds of the displaced Kurds were invalidated by legal decree, most frequently without compensation or with nominal compensation.The Iraqi government nationalized the agricultural lands, making them the property of the Iraqi state.\n\nThe Iraqi government simultaneously embarked on a massive campaign to resettle the formerly Kurdish areas with Arab farmers and their families, thus completing the Arabization process.The Iraqi government did not have to look far for eager recruits for its Arabization campaign: located southwest of Mosul was the large al-Jazeera desert, home to hundreds of thousands of loyalist nomadic Sunni Arab tribesmen.Enticed with free, irrigated land, and encouraged by their tribal shaikhs, the al-Jazeera tribesmen abandoned their hard lives in the desert and moved north en masse.\n\nOne elderly Arab tribesman from the al-Hadidi tribe recounted how his family and other tribesmen had moved north in late 1974 to be resettled in an emptied Kurdish village:\n\nWe went to Hin Djok at the end of 1974, October or November.Before this, we used to live like shepherds with our sheep, south of Mosul.We had no lands, and we used to take our sheep [grazing in the desert.]In 1974, the government came and asked if we wanted lands in the north.We were very grateful and voluntarily went to the north. We built our own houses, all of our families built new houses, and we also dug water wells.Each farmer got sixty dunums[5] of irrigated land.[6]\n\nAnother elderly Arab tribesman from the al-Hadidi tribe explained how forty-seven families from his tribe went to the Kurdish village of Khani Siddiq in 1975:\n\nWe went to Khani Siddiq in 1975.Before, we were living from place to place in the al-Jazeera desert, in our tents.We owned no land.The government came to us and said they would take us to villages in the north.The government kicked out the Kurds and gave them compensation, and then brought us.The government didn't force us to go to the north.They came and asked us if we had lands and we said no.They said that if anyone wanted to the north, they would take us.We were very happy to go to the north because we had no irrigated lands in the south.\n\nThere were little houses in the village.We reconstructed those houses and built some new ones.They gave us sixty dunums each, but this was different in each village.[7]\n\nThe process by which Arabs came to the north was remarkably similar throughout the vast region the Iraqi government repopulated with Arabs, stretching from Khanaqin near the Iranian border to Sinjar near the Syrian border.'Alaiwi Sanur Hamid al-Sayeh, an elderly Arab farmer who moved with about thirty Arab families to the village of Suhaila near the Syrian border in 1974, described his move in nearly identical terms to the version given by the al-Hadidi tribesmen above, who settled in Shaikhan district hundreds of miles away:\n\nWe came to Suhaila in 1974.We came from Salahuddin governorate, from the al-Jazeera desert.The government and the Ba`th moved us from al-Jazeera to this village.The government came to us, and announced that there were lands in these villages, and if we wanted to register [for land], we could.We registered, and one day they brought vehicles to transport us.Before this, we were living like bedouin in tents.They assigned each farmer 100 dunums.[8]\n\nThe shaikhs of the Arab tribes of the al-Jazeera desert-the area from which the largest number of Arab settlers came-confirmed this version of events in interviews with Human Rights Watch.According to Shaikh Nawwaf Hawwaz al-'Atmi al-Shummari, a leader of the al-Shummar tribe in the north, Iraqi government representatives came to the al-Jazeera desert in 1974, asking them to move north: \"The government came to us and told us to go live there [in the north], saying they would give us some land, just to protect the oil fields.We went to live in seven villages, each with 100 to 150 families.\"[9]Shaikh Mustafa Ahmad al-Warsan, the head of the large al-Hadidi tribe that settled dozens of Kurdish villages in the north, gave a similar explanation:\n\nPrior to the 1970s, the Arabs of our tribes used to live in the al-Jazeera desert, and none of them used to own any land.Or they lived in villages that belonged to other people and worked their land [as sharecroppers].The people who lived in the al-Jazeera desert lived in temporary settlements [i.e. tents] because there was no water there, so their life depended on the rain.The land in the al-Jazeera doesn't belong to anyone [individually], so some people used 500 dunums, others 1,000 dunums.\n\nThe government announced [in the mid-1970s] to all the tribes in the al-Jazeera that there were irrigated lands in the north.Most of the people went north because of these lands.It was different from village to village-some farmers received twenty dunums, others thirty.This depended on the size of the village and the number of people who went to the village.\n\nThe agreement they gave us was that we had rental contracts with the government.Each farmer had a contract and we used to pay a rent rate every year.This contract was renewed annually.[10]\n\nShaikh Mustafa made a point of crucial relevance to the resolution of the property disputes in the north, namely that the majority of Arabs who came to the north to resettle rural villages were not given title to the land they farmed, but rather worked under annual rental contracts.While the rights of these Arab farmers, who built their homes on the land and often lived there for decades, should not be minimized, at the same time it is of legal relevance that most Arabs were never made the actual owners of the land taken from the Kurds-a situation different from the urban Arabization of Kirkuk, where the Arabs who came to the area were given full title to the land.\n\nHuman Rights Watch interviewed dozens of Arab families and Arab tribal leaders who ventured to the north under the Arabization campaign, and the majority of those interviewed clearly stated that they had come to the north by choice, after being offered lucrative irrigated land by the government.Some stressed, however, that their desperate economic situation in the al-Jazeera desert gave them little choice.Shaikh Hamdi Idbis Hussain, head of the al-Luhaib tribe, explained why he decided to accept a government offer to settle formerly Kurdish villages in the Makhmour district in the mid-1990's: \"We went there because the members of my tribe are very poor and had no land.Most of them used to live on just one meal a day.\"[11]An Arab farmer who had resettled from the al-Jazeera desert to the village of Shamarash in Shaikhan district stressed that he had little choice in the move: \"We moved because there was an order from the government to move to this village.Whether I was happy or unhappy, I had to obey that order.During the last regime, if the government gave an order to the people to do something, they had to obey.\"[12]\n\nWhile the majority of Sunni Arabs from the al-Jazeera desert appear to have moved to the north either voluntarily or with minimal coercion, a small number of Shi`a tribes who were moved to the north appear to have come under much greater pressure to do so.For example, the government in 1975 ordered some 150 families from the Shi`a al-Shuraifi tribe to leave their ancestral home in al-Nassiriyya and to resettle in Khanaqin.Their ancestral lands were then given away to other tribes, and they were registered as residents of Khanaqin.The al-Shuraifi leadership claims they were moved against their will and lost their ancestral lands because they refused to join the Ba`th Party and were suspected of being sympathetic to the outlawed Islamic Da'wa and Iraqi Communist parties.[13]\n\nAnother Shi`a tribe from the south, the Albu Mahmoud tribe from Kut, also claimed to have been similarly forced to resettle in Khanaqin in 1975: \"We were displaced by the government in 1975 to Khanaqin, because they wanted to take us to the Kurdish areas.We were forced to go to the north: They displaced us to replace the Kurds.\"[14]A third Shi`a tribe, the al-Fahd from Kut, also claimed to have been forced to go north, \"because of the ethnic cleansing of the Kurds.\"[15]Altogether, Human Rights Watch found about 450 Shi`a families who claimed to have been forcefully resettled by the Iraqi government to Khanaqin.Following the March 2003 war, they were evicted by the original Kurdish owners and were living in abandoned government buildings when Human Rights Watch met them.\n\nThe 1991 Gulf War and its Aftermath\n\nThe 1991 Gulf War between Iraq and the U.S.-led coalition that ousted Iraqi forces from Kuwait was followed by large-scale uprisings against the government of Saddam Hussein among the Shi`a in the south and the Kurds in the north.Kurdish guerillas, profiting from the disorder of the Iraqi army that was still reeling from a devastating defeat in Kuwait, briefly occupied nearly all of the areas they considered historically Kurdish, including Kirkuk.Some vengeance killings took place as the population acted out its anger against those associated with the Iraqi government, killing Ba`th Party officials, local bureaucrats, and intelligence agents, but such killings were more widespread in the south.[16]\n\nThe U.S. did not come to the support of the uprisings, and the Iraqi government was able to reorganize loyalists within the army. With the support of Ba`th Party cadre and supportive tribal allies the government soon mounted a counter-offensive and quickly crushed the uprisings, killing thousands of civilians using indiscriminate force, and rounding up tens of thousands more and executing them.In response to atrocities committed by the Iraqi troops, the U.S., Britain, and France unilaterally declared a \"no-fly zone\" over northern Iraq that would remain in place until the fall of the Iraqi government of Saddam Hussein.In October 1991, the Iraqi government withdrew its military forces and civilian administrators from the northern governorates of Dohuk, Sulaimaniyya, and Arbil, granting de facto autonomy to the Kurds in the area.The Kurds established their own administration, an uneasy alliance between the two main Kurdish political parties, the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) led by Mas'ud Barzani, and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) led by Jalal Talabani, as well as a number of other smaller political parties.The withdrawal of Iraqi troops from the northern governorates allowed a significant number of Kurds to return there, although many continued to be displaced from their original homes and lived in dismal IDP camps.\n\nThe establishment of Kurdish control over the three northern governorates also led to the expulsion of a significant number of Arabs who had settled some of the land during the Arabization campaign and which were now under Kurdish control.Many of the Arabs displaced from such areas remained landless for several years until the Iraqi government settled them on other lands seized from the Kurds later in the 1990s.For example, the al-Fahd tribe was originally resettled in 1975 from the southern town of Kut to agricultural land located near Qara Tapa in Sulaimaniyya governorate.They were displaced in 1991: \"During the war in 1991, the Kurds came and took our land and houses and we were evicted from the area.\"[17]The tribe then led a landless existence until they were again resettled near Khanaqin in 1997, only to be evicted again during the 2003 conflict.\n\nFollowing the 1991 uprisings, the Iraqi government's crackdown led to further displacement of Kurds and other minorities in the north.During the crackdown, as many as between one and two million northerners, most of them Kurds, fled to Iran, Turkey, or the mountainous areas still under Kurdish control.[18]Some Kurdish neighborhoods in Kirkuk were leveled during the crackdown, and the Iraqi government actively resisted the return of Kurds and other minorities to the city of Kirkuk, even refusing the United Nations permission to monitor returns of ethnic minorities to Kirkuk.[19]\n\nThe Arabization of the Kirkuk Region\n\nFollowing the failed 1991 uprisings, the Iraqi government focused its Arabization efforts on the oil-rich city of Kirkuk and its surrounding area.Kurds, Turkomans, and Assyrians came under constant pressure to sign \"ethnic identity correction\" forms relinquishing their ethnicity and registering officially as Arabs.[20]Non-Arabs were also required to become members of the Ba`th Party, and to serve in \"volunteer\" militias such as Jaysh al-Quds (Jerusalem Army) or the Fida'iyyi Saddam (Saddam's Martyrs, often referred to in Western media as the Fedayeen).Families that refused to comply were issued formal expulsion orders requiring them to leave their homes and move to Kurdish-controlled areas.The government of Iraq displaced approximately 120,000 persons from Kirkuk and other areas under government control from 1991 to 2000 in furtherance of its Arabization campaign.[21]Arab families were given financial incentives to move north, and the Iraqi government embarked on housing construction projects to bring more Arab families north in order to change the demographic make-up of the north.\n\nThe decades of state persecution of Kurds and the repeated forced displacement in the north have created a massive caseload of IDPs in the northern governorates, including many who have been displaced multiple times.A 1998 study conducted by the United Nations Center for Human Settlements (UN-Habitat) estimated that nearly one million of the three million people living in northern Iraq had been displaced at one time or another, a caseload that includes the estimated 100,000 persons displaced from factional Kurdish in-fighting in the mid-1990s.[22]\n\nIn 2001, UN-Habitat released a more detailed study that showed just how permanent much of the forced displacement by the Iraqi government had been.The study counted a total of 805,505 displaced persons in the three northern governorates controlled by Kurdish forces.The majority, or 446,000 displaced, continued to live in the \"collective towns\" constructed by the Iraqi government during the forced displacement campaigns of the 1970s and the 1988 Anfal campaign.[23]An undetermined number of families are headed by women: the Habitat report notes that in some areas, notably in Duhok governorate, \"the 'widows' factor is extremely high.\"[24]If the number of persons displaced by inter-Kurdish fighting in the mid-90's (estimated at 100,000 to 110,000) is excluded from the UN-Habitat estimate, it appears that some 700,000 persons continued to live in displacement in the north as a direct result of the Iraqi government's forced displacement policies that continued for nearly three decades.\n\nThe Legal Framework of Arabization\n\nWhile violence and coercion formed the basis of the Iraqi government's Arabization campaign, the government also used legal means to dispossess non-Arabs in the north, and to give their lands and property to Arab settlers.Understanding this legal framework is crucial to resolving the property disputes that are occurring now in northern Iraq, following the overthrow of the former government.\n\nAmong the first steps taken by the Ba`th Party when it came to power in 1968 was a major land reform campaign aimed at further eroding the power of the landlords who had controlled much of the agricultural land in the country, often owning hundreds of thousands of dunums of land.Their economic base had already been broken ten years earlier as a result of agricultural reforms implemented by the government of 'Abd al-Karim Qassim upon the overthrow of the Iraqi monarchy in 1958.The Qassim government promulgated the Agrarian Reform Act (Law No. 30 of 1958), limiting the maximum amount of land any individual could own to 2,000 dunums[25] and expropriating all lands in excess of this limit.The financial compensation paid for expropriated land was nominal, and many landowners received none.When the Ba`th Party came to power, it cancelled all preceding laws, thus voiding the 1958 law and issued even more far-reaching reforms. The Ba`th's Agrarian Reform Act (Law No. 117 of 1970) limited individual ownership to a maximum of 1,000 dunums of rainfall-dependent lands, and abolished compensation payments.While these laws were implemented without discrimination throughout Iraq, they also dispossessed many large landowners in the north, Iraq's richest agricultural zone.Subsequently, individual ownership of the same type of land in the Kurdish north was further limited to 300 dunums.[26]\n\nWhen the government began mass expulsions of non-Arabs in the north during the mid-1970s, the vast majority of the expelled farmers had property rights to the land they lost, rights which had been confirmed through a process known as taswiya (literally, 'settlement').[27]According to Najib Fa'iq Ahmad, who has headed the legal office and the expropriations department of the Kirkuk agriculture office for more than a decade: \"All of the inhabitants of these districts had taswiya property deeds, dating back to the Ottoman period.Mr. Lyon, a British official, confirmed those deeds in 1936 [during the period of British rule].Their rights were absolute under taswiya: they could sell the land, and after the landowner died, the land was split between his children. The taswiya deeds were kept in the property registration department-and they are still there.\"[28]\n\nFollowing the mass expulsions of minorities in the mid-1970s, the Revolutionary Command Council (RCC) issued a series of orders, expropriating the land left empty.For example, Order 369 of 1976 expropriated the land of hundreds of villages in sixty districts surrounding Kirkuk.The government supposedly paid nominal compensation for these lands, at the rate of six Iraqi dinars per dunum, but almost no displaced Kurds or Turkomans were able to claim even this compensation, as it required going to inaccessible government offices: \"No one came to claim their compensation because either they didn't know or they had been expelled.\" Najib Fa'iq Ahmad explained, \"so after fifteen years the money went back to the government.\"[29]Similar laws and orders allowed the government to freely seize and convert land in the north to government-owned land.\n\nOnce the land was nationalized, the government then rented the land to newly arrived Arab farmers at nominal rates, under annual, renewable contracts issued by district agricultural departments.At most of the agricultural departments visited by Human Rights Watch, the agricultural contracts were still on file, making it possible to determine exactly the number and names of families living in each Arabized village in the north.\n\nIV. Legal Standards\n\nForced Population Transfers as a Crime Against Humanity\n\nThe expulsions of ethnic Kurds, Turkomans, and Assyrians from northern Iraq amount to an Iraqi government policy of forced transfer of populations, aimed at changing the demographic nature of northern Iraq-a policy commonly referred to as \"Arabization.\"Underlying this demographic change was the Iraqi government's desire to reduce the political power and presence of ethnic minorities in order to consolidate government control over this oil-rich region.The forcible and arbitrary transfer of populations--that is, without any grounds permissible under international law-has been defined in the International Criminal Court statute as a crime against humanity.[30] Although the crimes described here occurred prior to the ICC statute's coming into force, and Iraq in any case is not a party to the statute, the statute itself is considered to reflect customary international law.\n\nPrior to the coming into force of the International Criminal Court (ICC) treaty, international criminal law sometimes did not distinguish between the crime of deportation, defined as \"the forced removal of people from one country to another,\" and the crime of forced population transfer, defined as the \"compulsory movement of people from one area to another within the same State.\"[31] Deportation has been recognized as a crime against humanity in each of the major international criminal instruments prior to the ICC, including the Nuremberg Charter, the Tokyo Charter, the Allied Control Council Law No. 10, and the statutes of the international criminal tribunals for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and Rwanda (ICTR).[32]The long-standing definition of \"deportation\" as a crime against humanity included the crime of forced population transfer within a state's borders.[33]\n\nThe Statute of the ICC, which came into force on July 1, 2002,[34] includes among its definitions of crimes against humanity \"deportation or forcible transfer of population.\"According to one commentator, forcible transfer was specifically included \"to make it expressly clear that transfers of populations within a State's borders were also covered.\"[35]The crime of forcible transfer of populations includes \"the full range of coercive pressures on people to flee their homes, including death threats, destruction of their homes, and other acts of persecution such as depriving members of a group of employment, denying them access to schools, and forcing them to wear a symbol of their religious identity.\"[36]\n\nIn order to be recognized as a crime against humanity under the requirements put forth by the ICC, the forced transfer of population also must be committed as \"part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population, with knowledge of the attack.\"[37]The \"attack\" does not necessarily need to be a military attack as defined under international humanitarian law, and \"need not even involve military forces or armed hostilities, or any violent force at all.\"[38]In the landmark Akayesu judgment, the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda defined attack in a way that encompasses the forced transfer practices used by Iraq and described in this report, stating:\n\nAn attack may also be nonviolent in nature, like imposing a system of apartheid, which is declared a crime against humanity [by the] Apartheid Convention of 1973, or exerting pressure on the population to act in a particular manner, may come under the purview of an attack, if orchestrated on a massive scale or in a systematic manner.[39]\n\nThe expulsions of ethnic Kurds, Turkomans, and Assyrians from northern Iraq meet the other elements of the \"part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population\" test.Almost all of the expelled persons were civilians.In order to be widespread, the attacks must include \"massive, frequent, large-scale action, carried out collectively with considerable seriousness,\"[40] a requirement met by the hundreds of thousands of victims of the expulsion policies.The use of standardized expulsion procedures-such as the expulsion orders and specialized detention facilities used in the 1990s in Kirkuk-as well as the clear involvement of Iraqi officials in all aspects of the expulsions including opposition to U.N.-facilitated returns,[41] also reflect the systematic character of the attacks, a requirement that is defined as requiring \"a pattern or methodical plan\" that is \"thoroughly organized and following a regular pattern.\"[42]\n\nThe actions of the former Iraqi government meet all the requisite elements of the crime against humanity of forced transfer of civilian populations.First, Iraq has \"forcibly transferred, without ground permitted under international law,\" hundreds of thousands of Kurds, Turkomans, and Assyrians \"to another location, by expulsion or other coercive acts.\"[43]Second, the persons expelled or forcibly transferred from northern Iraq \"were lawfully present in the area from which they were deported or transferred.\"[44]Third, the Iraqi government knew that the expelled persons were lawfully present in northern Iraq.[45]Finally, the expulsions from northern Iraq were pursued as a matter of government policy.\n\nHuman Rights Provisions Relevant to Forced Transfer\n\nArticle 12 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), to which Iraq became a party in 1971, establishes that everyone shall have \"the right to liberty of movement and freedom to choose his residence.\"[46]The freedom to choose one's residence incorporates the right not to be forcibly moved.[47]Restrictions on movement and choice of residence are permitted only when provided by law and for reason of \"national security, public order (ordre public), public health or morals, or the rights and freedoms of others,\" and such restrictions must be consistent with other rights recognized in the ICCPR.\n\n\"Ethnic Cleansing\"\n\nEthnic cleansing refers to the policy of \"rendering an area ethnically homogeneous by using force or intimidation to remove targeted persons or a given group from the area.\"[48]Ethnic cleansing is not defined in any international criminal convention or under customary international law, but it is a concept that is \"culled from the Yugoslav conflict, where the term has been used by the Serb leadership in connection with their military campaigns to cleanse territories that are intended to be part of 'Greater Serbia.'\"[49]Ethnic cleansing is similar to forced population transfer, but involves an additional element of the use of \"terror-inspiring violence.\"[50]The United Nations has repeatedly characterized the practice of ethnic cleansing as a violation of international humanitarian law, and has demanded that perpetrators of ethnic cleansing be brought to justice.[51]\n\nThe 1988 Anfal campaign, which caused the deaths of some 100,000 Kurds and the displacement of hundreds of thousands of others and the destruction of their villages, included the use of terror-inspiring violence.Iraqi policies shared with Balkan ethnic cleansing policies an intent to alter permanently the ethnic make-up of northern Iraq-hence the common characterization of the Iraqi government policy as \"Arabization.\"Such attempts to alter permanently the ethnic make-up of a region have been characterized as contrary to international law by the U.N. Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, in a 1995 opinion relating to Bosnia-Herzegovina: \"any attempt to change or uphold a changed demographic composition of an area, against the will of the original inhabitants, by whichever means, is a violation of international law.\"[52]\n\nThe Right of Forcibly Displaced Persons to Return to their Home, or be Compensated for their Losses\n\nInternational law not only specifies the forced and arbitrary transfer of populations as a crime against humanity, but also provides for a remedy for the persons victimized by these forced transfers.Persons forcibly transferred from their homes in violation of international standards are entitled to return to their home areas and property, a right known as the \"right to return.\"[53]\n\nMost international human rights instruments recognize the right to return to one's country.[54]Although there is no specific provision in international covenants affirming the right of internally displaced persons to return to their places of origin, this right, or at least the obligation of states not to impede the return of people to their places of origin, is implied. For example, article 12 of the ICCPR recognizes the right to enter one's own country.[55]Article 12 also recognizes the right to choose freely one's own place of residence, which incorporates the right to return to one's home area.In some cases, the right to return to one's former place of residence is also supported by the right to family reunification and to protection for the family.Moreover, as noted by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, \"the right to return to one's own country is increasingly seen as linked with the right to adequate housing.\"[56] Recognizing these various rights, the Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights has reaffirmed \"the right of all refugees and internally displaced persons to return to their homes and places of habitual residence in their country and/or place of origin, should they so wish.\"[57]\n\nThe U.N. Security Council and other U.N. bodies have also repeatedly asserted the right of internally displaced persons to return to their former homes.The Security Council, in its resolution 820 (1993) dealing with Bosnia and Herzegovina, stated that \"all displaced persons have the right to return in peace to their former homes and should be assisted to do so.\"Similar language by the Security Council affirming this right to return can be found in resolutions addressing the conflicts in Abkhazia and the Republic of Georgia, Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Cambodia, Croatia, Cyprus, Kosovo, Kuwait, Namibia, and Tajikistan.[58]The U.N. Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD), in its General Recommendation XXII on Article 5 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination has stated:\n\nAll refugees and displaced persons have, after their return to their homes of origin, the right to have restored to them property of which they were deprived in the course of the conflict and to be compensated appropriately for any such property that cannot be restored to them.[59]\n\nSection V of the United Nations Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement (the Guiding Principles) contain the Principles Relating to Return, Resettlement and Reintegration of Internally Displaced Persons. Principle 28 provides that:\n\nCompetent authorities have the primary duty and responsibility to establish conditions, as well as provide the means, which allow internally displaced persons to return voluntarily, in safety and with dignity, to their homes or places of habitual residence, or to resettle voluntarily in another part of the country. Such authorities shall endeavour to facilitate the reintegration of returned or resettled internally displaced persons.\"[60]\n\nThis principle further provides that special efforts should be made to ensure the full participation of all internally displaced persons in the planning and management of such processes. The participation of women, in particular, is essential.\n\nThe Commission on Human Rights has often recognized the need for property restitution as an effective remedy for forced displacement.[61]In 1996, the European Court of Human Rights recognized the right of a displaced Greek Cypriot to claim her property, despite the fact that she had not resided there for twenty-two years.[62]Finally the ICC Statute authorizes restitution as a remedy, stating that \"[t]he Court shall establish principles relating to reparations to, or in respect of, victims, including restitution, compensation and rehabilitation.\"[63]\n\nWhen displaced persons are unable to return to their homes because their property has been destroyed or claims against a current occupant are unsuccessful, they are entitled to compensation.The right to an effective remedy, contained in ICCPR article 2(3), suggests that there should be a right to financial compensation when a displaced person cannot repossess her property.In the Cyprus case mentioned above, the European Court of Human Rights recognized the plaintiff's right to compensation for the years that she had been denied access to her property.[64]\n\nPrinciple 29(2) of the Guiding Principles provides that:\n\ncompetent authorities have the duty and responsibility to assist returned and/or resettledinternally displaced persons to recover, to the extent possible, their property and possessions which they left behind or were dispossessed of upon their displacement. When recovery of such property and possessions is not possible, competent authorities shall provide or assist these persons in obtaining appropriate compensation or another form of just reparation.\n\nCompensation, when it is provided, must be given in a manner which is reasonable in relation to the damage suffered.[65] The European Court of Human Rights, in a ruling, clearly stated that compensation for deprivation of property \"must be given in a prompt, appropriate and effective manner and in 'an amount reasonably related to [the value of the property]\"[66]\n\nThe Need for Fair and Impartial Procedures and the Rights of Secondary Occupants\n\nWhile the ethnic Kurds, Turkomans, and Assyrians displaced by Iraq's Arabization and other forced displacement policies have a right to return to their homes or receive compensation for their losses, it is important that this right is implemented in a manner that does not cause additional human rights abuses.The ethnic Arab populations brought in by the Iraqi government-some against their will, but most with financial or other incentives-also have accumulated rights that must be respected.Many Arabs paid the government for the homes or land they occupied, or built their own homes on the land.Because of the time that has elapsed since the original expropriations in some areas-nearly thirty years for the expropriations and expulsions of the mid-1970s-many properties have changed hands a number of times, and the current occupants are often far removed from the original beneficiary of the expropriation and Arabization policies.\n\nFirst and foremost, any attempt to redress past abuses and to repossess private property should be free of violence, intimidation, and threats.In many prior conflicts, the collapse of an abusive administration is often followed by a security vacuum in which the former victims of abusive policies may wreak revenge on perceived government supporters and beneficiaries.[67]Such revenge attacks constitute serious human rights abuses. Iraqi government forces, along with U.S.-led coalition forces have a duty to prevent such abuses, and the Iraqi government has the responsibility to bring the perpetrators to justice.\n\nThe right to repossess private property must be balanced against any rights these secondary occupiers may have under domestic or international law, using impartial and efficient procedural safeguards.The U.N. Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights urged \"all states to ensure the free and fair exercise of the right to return to one's home and place of habitual residence by all refugees and internally displaced persons and to develop effective and expeditious legal and administrative procedures to ensure the free and fair exercise of this right, including fair and effective mechanisms to resolve outstanding housing and property problems.\"[68]In the former Yugoslavia, the Dayton Accords created a Commission for Real Property Claims (CRPC) and the Office of the High Representative Ombudsperson to resolve property disputes.[69]All parties to the property disputes in Iraq, including the victims as well as the beneficiaries of the Arabization policies, have a right to fair and unbiased procedures to determine their conflicting claims.\n\nOne particular difficulty faced by many programs aimed at returning displaced persons and re-creating multi-ethnic communities in the Balkans after years of forced displacement and severe human rights abuses is continuing discrimination policies and violence between ethnic communities, which make it nearly impossible for minorities to live peacefully among hostile majorities, even when their legal claims have been recognized.[70]In order to prevent communal violence and retaliation, any program to implement the right to return of the displaced communities must ensure that persons who have their claims legally recognized can actually return to their homes in safety.\n\nFinally, it must be recognized that adjudication of individual property claims and the recognition of the right to return will not be a sufficient response to address the consequences of nearly three decades of Arabization in northern Iraq.Programs will need to be developed to provide alternative housing, land, or compensation for the parties who will not have their rights to property recognized, in order to avoid making tens of thousands of families homeless and landless.\n\nMoreover, care must be taken to ensure that even those who do not have lawful or other rights to dwell within housing or property registered to returnees do not become homeless or subject to other human rights violations. In this regard, account should be taken of the views of the U.N. Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Paragraph 16 of the Committee's General Comment 7 (1997) on Forced Evictions states\n\nEvictions should not result in rendering individuals homeless or vulnerable to the violation of other human rights. Where those affected are unable to provide for themselves, the State party must take all appropriate measures, to the maximum of its available resources, to ensure that adequate alternative housing, resettlement or access to productive lands, as the case may be, is available.[71]\n\nV.The 2003 Iraq War and its Aftermath\n\nVoluntary Displacement of the Arab Settlers\n\nOn March 20, 2003, the United States and its allies went to war against Iraq, with the stated aim of overthrowing the government of Saddam Hussein.Although a large-scale northern offensive could not take place because of Turkey's refusal to allow U.S. troops transit and basing rights on its territory, the Kurdish areas did prove an important launching ground for a second front against the Iraqi forces.U.S. Special Forces based in Kurdish-controlled northern Iraq worked closely with the Peshmerga forces of the KDP and the PUK.As the intensive U.S. bombing campaign began to have its effect on Iraqi forces, the Peshmerga forces moved south with the U.S. Special Forces, ultimately seizing control of a large swath of land which they considered historically Kurdish, from Khanaqin on the Iranian border to Tuz Khurmatu in the center and Sinjar on the Syrian border-an area that included the main northern city of Kirkuk.\n\nMuch of the Arab population brought to rural areas in the north during the Arabization campaign fled during the war, leaving large swaths of territory unpopulated.Among the reasons cited by the Arabs for their flight were the intensity of the bombing campaign and the proximity of the front lines with its associated dangers, fears of revenge from returning Kurds, and in many cases the remarkable recognition that the land they lived on did not truly belong to them, but rather to the Kurds or other minorities who had been expelled.Equally remarkable, although sporadic violence and intimidation by Peshmerga forces did take place (see below), Human Rights Watch is not aware of a single massacre committed against Arab settlers by returning Kurds or other minorities.This is an experience vastly different from that of the Balkans, where bloodshed was routine during the various \"ethnic cleansing\" campaigns that characterized those conflicts.\n\nThe majority of the displaced Arab families interviewed by Human Rights Watch clearly stated that they fled their villages long before any Kurdish fighters ever reached them, in order to avoid bloodshed.For example, Badr'Arab al-Budair, one of about 150 al-Budair tribal families moved from Diwaniyya to Khanaqin in 1975, explained how he had fled his home during the war:\n\nWhen the war started, the [Iraqi] army pulled out of the area between us and [Kurdish-controlled] Kifri.The tribes remained alone, without any force [defense].The bombardment of American aircraft came on our homes, and the shelling of the Kurds started falling on us.So we moved with some of our goods from our places in Kifri and came here [to Ba'quba].We left behind all of our agricultural products and goods.I left a tractor and its instruments, two million dinars worth of agricultural products, and my house.[72]\n\nThe majority of Arab families who fled their villages during the war sought safety in nearby urban centers, such as Kirkuk and Mosul.When they attempted to return to their villages after the war, most were prevented from doing so by the Kurdish civilians and fighters who had returned to the same villages from which they had been originally displaced.\n\n'Abdullah 'Ali Mudhar al-Hadidi, a thirty-eight-year-old Arab farmer who settled in Musikan village in Shaikhan district in 1975 together with fifteen other families, described how he and the other villagers fled from Musikan after some fifteen armed villagers were killed during a U.S. coalition bombing raid.After the war ended, he and two others tried to go back to their village to retrieve some belongings, but were arrested and detained for two days by armed men loyal to Mas'ud Barzani's KDP:\n\nI was part of a group of three men, unarmed.After the coalition forces took control of Mosul, we just went back to the village to retrieve some goods from our houses.The Peshmerga arrested us and detained us in their office for twenty-four hours.They then moved us to detention in Faruq town.The building had a yellow flag, they belonged to Mas'ud [Barzani's KDP].They didn't do anything to us, they treated us normally, but they told us that the next time we came to the village, they would detain us longer because these villages belong to the Kurds, and we are not allowed to go back anymore.[73]\n\nCase Study: Kis Qal'a village, Shaikhan district\n\nThe village of Kis Qal'a, located in the Shaikhan district of Nineveh governorate just north of Mosul, provides a typical example of the sequence of events in most of the formerly Arabized areas of northern Iraq.According to Haji Muhammad Ya'qub Hussain, an official in the agricultural department in Shaikhan district, the Revolutionary Command Council issued an order in March 1975 nationalizing all of the land in the district and other neighboring districts: \"There were 188 villages in Shaikhan.The government cancelled all of the property certificates, of the Kurds and the other nationalities in the villages.Most of these lands, maybe ninety percent, were owned by the people [living in the villages.] The law of 1975 Arabized the whole area, and brought the Arabs to all of the Kurdish villages.\"[74]\n\nPrior to the expulsion of the Kurdish villagers, the 1,600 dunums of land that made up Kis Qal'a were owned by four Kurdish brothers who were leading members of the Zitki tribe.The brothers had title deeds to the property, and the other villagers of Kis Qal'a worked for them as tenant farmers.\n\nShaikh 'Abd al-Karim 'Abd Zitki, the Kurdish leader of Kis Qal'avillage and a descendant of the original Kurdish owners, recalled how the Iraqi government had kicked him and the other villagers of Kis Qal'a out of their homes on April 15, 1975:\n\nThe eviction and expulsion happened in one day, and on the same day they brought the Arabs.I was born in 1957, so I was seventeen at the time.They came and ordered us to leave Kis Qal'a.We could choose where we wanted to go, but the only condition was that it had to be above the town of Atrush [located inside the then just-declared Kurdish autonomous zone].The ones who came to expel us were the heads of Shaikhan district, with the police and Ba'thists.The expulsion was peaceful, but we were ordered to leave.\n\nWe were allowed to take only the household goods and furniture, but nothing else.We also took our animals.We were provided with transportation by the government, some trucks.We were settled in a remote area [near MusikaninShaikhandistrict].We arrived at the end of April, in a field of grass.We had to build our own houses from mud.[75]\n\nMost of the Kurdish villagers lived in Musikan village until the 1991 Gulf War, when they were forced to flee the fighting and seek refuge in Turkey.After they returned to Musikan, they found that their homes in the village were destroyed by the Iraqi army.The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) settled the families in an IDP camp near the town of Zakho, near the Turkish border.The families lived in the camp until their return to Kis Qal'afollowing the collapse of the Iraqi government in 2003.\n\nThe Arabs who came to the Kurdish village of Kis Qal'a mostly belonged to the al-Hadidi tribe.The Iraqi government expanded Kis Qal'a into a larger village, ultimately housing some 200 Arab families.\n\nShaikh Mustafa Ahmad al-Warsan, the head of the al-Hadidi tribe, explained to Human Rights Watch that prior to 1975 his tribesmen used to live landless in the al-Jazeera desert or work as sharecroppers. \"The government announced at that time to all the tribes in al-Jazeera that there were irrigated lands available in the north, and most of the people went to the north for these lands,\" he explained.\"The agreement the government gave us was that we had rental contracts with the government.Each farmer had a contract and used to pay rent each year, and the contract was renewed annually.\"[76]'Aziz Hazza' Muhammad al-Hadidi, a fifty-year-old Arab farmer who was part of a group of several hundred families of the al-Hadidi tribe who settled in 1974-75 in Kis Qal'a, explained how they had come there:\n\nWe moved to Kis Qal'a in 1975-76.Before that, some of our tribe was living in al-Jazeera desert, others in Shaikhan district.The government didn't give us much, only 300 Iraqi dinars per family. They told us that some rebels had come from this village, and that they wanted Arabs to go there.\n\nWhen we arrived, the village was completely empty.We don't know what happened to the Kurds; we only heard they were displaced and were given some money. They displaced the Kurds from the village peacefully, and gave them money for their lands.At that time, there were only fifteen houses in the village belonging to the Kurds, it was a very small village, divided into a Kurdish part and an Arab part.So we built new houses near the main road.[77]\n\nA second Arab villager from Kis Qal'a, Ibrahim Mudhar Saleh al-Hadidi, told a similar story:\n\nWe went to Kis Qal'a in 1975.Before 1975, we were [landless] people, living from place to place with our sheep, we were shepherds.We used to live in tents before 1975.\n\nIn 1975, the government gave us land and resettled our tribe.When we arrived in Kis Qal'a, it was totally empty, an abandoned village-the government paid the families some money and they left.There were only ten houses belonging to the Kurds before 1975, it was a very small village.We built our own houses, with our own money.The government only gave us the land to farm and irrigate, each family received twenty-two dunums.[78]\n\nMost of the Arabs interviewed by Human Rights Watch said that the Kurds had been compensated at the time of their forced dislocation, an assertion that is vehemently denied by the displaced Kurds, including the villagers of Kis Qal'a.In all likelihood, Iraqi government propaganda asserted that all displaced families had been compensated, but such compensation did not actually take place.\n\nThe enlargement of the village of Kis Qal'a during the Arabization period meant that the lands of the neighboring villages were confiscated and re-assigned to the Arab farmers of Kis Qal'a.Among those who lost their land were inhabitants of the neighboring village of Shif Shirin, which had been Arab for hundreds of years.The Arabs of Shif Shirin, also members of the al-Hadidi tribe, bitterly complained about the \"new\" Arabs who arrived:\n\nDuring the Arabization, they took all of our land, 800 dunums.They gave us back only seven pieces of land of thirty-two dunums each.They tried to evict and displace us to the north, accusing us of having stronger ties with the Kurds than the Arabs.The Arabs who had come tried to press the government to expel us.[79]\n\nDuring the 2003 conflict, the situation in Kis Qal'a changed quickly.After living there for nearly three decades, the Arabs abandoned the village and the former Kurdish residents returned. 'Aziz Hazza' Muhammad al-Hadidi described their flight:\n\nDuring the war, heavy bombardment started.At the beginning, no one kicked us out [of the village], we only left for our safety.There were heavy bombardments on our village and on other villages.There were twenty villagers [reportedly] killed in a nearby village.So we left.When the war ended, the Kurds took control of the entire village, some were Kurdish civilians and others were Peshmerga.[80]\n\nAfterwards, some of the Arabs tried to return to the village, but the Kurds refused to allow them: \"Some of our people went to negotiate with the Kurds, but the Kurds told us not to come back to the village anymore.We went multiple times. They threatened us and destroyed some houses.\"[81]Ibrahim Mudhar Saleh al-Hadidi also tried to return to his home in Kis Qal'a, but was prevented from doing so by the Kurds who had returned: \"They came out of the houses and told us we were not allowed to enter the village.They threatened us, saying that if we come again, they will use weapons and chop us to pieces.They will kill all of us, so it is better not to go back.\"[82]\n\nNotably, the returning Kurds did not evict the Arabs who had lived in the neighboring village of Shif Shirin for centuries.In fact, at the time of Human Rights Watch's visit, the elderly Arabs of Shif Shirin were hosting a banquet for the Kurdish neighbors they had grown up with, but had not seen since the mid-1970s.\n\nShaikh 'Abd al-Karim 'Abd Zitki, a member of the KDP military bureau and a descendant of the original landowners of Kis Qal'a, had returned home and was in charge of village affairs when Human Rights Watch visited Kis Qal'a.He was adamant that no Arabs would be allowed to come back to Kis Qal'a:\n\nI will not allow them to come back to this village, because they don't belong here.Their lands are south of Mosul, in the al-Jazeera.All of the ones who came to occupy our village were Ba`th Party members.This village will be all Kurdish. The decision that no Arab should be allowed to return was made by the Kurdish authorities.The Arabs don't want to stay here anymore, they know they were brought here by Arabization.[83]\n\nAt the time of Human Rights Watch's second visit to Kis Qal'a in September 2003, about fifty Kurdish families had settled in the village, all of them members of the al-Zitki tribe.According to Shaikh 'Abd al-Karim 'Abd Zitki, not just the original inhabitants of the village but any member of his tribe was welcome to come settle in the village.As head of the tribe and one of the original landowners of the village, he claimed the authority to assign plots of land to returning families.The returning Kurds were in need of a lot of assistance, according to the shaikh: \"We don't have a water treatment plant, we don't have seeds to plant, no fertilizers, and we need irrigators for the summer season.We need cement and reconstruction materials.The road needs to be asphalted.\"[84]\n\nThe Kurds gave the Arabs from Kis Qal'a half of the harvest that the Arabs had planted prior to their displacement, but considered that to be the end of their interaction with the Arabs: \"The Arabs have finished totally from here.\"[85]Many of the Arab families displaced from Kis Qal'a were still living in the Shaikhan district, under dire, crowded conditions in public facilities such as nearby abandoned military barracks and an empty amusement park, called Shallalat (Waterfalls), or in their traditional tents.\n\nAside from the harvest agreement, which was brokered by U.S.-led coalition authorities for the entire north, no Iraqi or international authority had played any role in the return to Kis Qal'a of the original Kurdish owners.The Arab settlers displaced from the village did not have any forum to turn to for the adjudication of the dispute.The returning Kurds did not yet have their land rights re-established, as there was no legislation in place to allow for such a redress at the time of the Human Rights Watch visit in September 2003.In effect, the residency of the Kurds in the village, and the displacement of the Arabs, was based on the change in power balance in northern Iraq rather than on a legal determination of rights.\n\nMost Arab families displaced from Kis Qal'a conceded in interviews with Human Rights Watch that it was unrealistic for them to expect to return to Kis Qal'a, and were willing to consider alternative accommodation.For most families, proper housing was a greater priority than farmlands, and some suggested that they would be satisfied with compensation for their lost homes or a new residence.\n\nForced displacement of Arab Settlers\n\nWhile the majority of Arabs who had come north during the Arabization campaign fled their homes without facing direct threats or violence, a significant number who chose to remain in their homes did face direct threats and intimidation from returning Kurds, although Human Rights Watch is not aware of many cases in which such threats materialized into violence or killings.In almost all cases, returning Kurds left pre-Arabization Arab populations alone and focused their threats and intimidation on the Arabs who had come north during the Arabization campaign.In most cases of intimidation documented by Human Rights Watch, fighters and sometimes civilian politicians of the two main Kurdish political parties-the KDP and the PUK-took a direct role in the intimidation, suggesting that the two political parties either actively supported the forced displacement of Arabs who had come north through Arabization, or at the very least condoned such abuses. As discussed below, even though U.S. forces often reached trouble areas after forced displacement of the Arabs had already occurred, Human Rights Watch found that most U.S. troops took aggressive steps to end such abuses once they reached the scene.\n\nObtaining housing for the families of those killed by the former government and for Peshmerga families who spent decades fighting the government and now expect some rewards for their years of service and the loss of relatives, appears to be a central theme running through many of the cases of abuse documented by Human Rights Watch, including the cases of Khanaqin, Doshivan, Domiz, and Kirkuk documented in this report.Both the KDP and the PUK are under great pressure to provide benefits to these important constituencies, but these constituencies often do not have personal land or property claims.\n\nCase Study: Khanaqin\n\nThe most widespread forced displacement documented by Human Rights Watch was that of hundreds of southern Shi`a families who had been resettled around the border town of Khanaqin in 1974-75.[86]Human Rights Watch spoke to representatives of all four of the Shi`a tribes who claimed they had been forced out of Khanaqin by PUK officials, and found their stories very consistent.According to Shaikh 'Ali 'Aziz, a leader of the al-Shuraifi tribe, PUK leader Jalal Talabani visited Khanaqin and neighboring Jalawla', staying for approximately two hours to meet with local and returning Kurdish officials.According to Shaikh 'Ali 'Aziz al-Shuraifi, PUK representatives came to his home almost immediately after the meeting and told him that all of his tribe's families had to leave the area immediately:\n\nAfter the meeting with [Talabani's] officials, the leaders of his party came to us and said, \"You can't stay here, you must leave immediately.\"I spoke to the leaders of the PUK, wanting to negotiate with them.I explained that we had household goods and needed time.They came to my house, and said they had an order from Jalal Talabani that every Arab who came after 1975 had to leave.\n\nSo they took our agricultural instruments and animals from our families all over the tribe.We were pushed out of Khanaqin and went to nearby al-Sa'diyya.Then the Kurds came to al-Sa'diyya and evicted us from there also.We spent three or four days in al-Sa'diyya-every few hours the Peshmerga would come and tell some families we had to leave.They came in groups.After four days, none of us were left.[87]\n\nMurayyaJaber Faris al-Fahd, a fifty-year-old Arab who owned a home in Khanaqin, had just fled from the town when Human Rights Watch located him near the village of Khan Bani Sa'ad, just north of Baghdad, on May 12, 2003.He described how he had been subjected to a constant campaign of intimidation, threats, and force, until he finally decided to leave his home:\n\nThe Kurds, the Peshmerga, were shouting at me everyday, saying \"Leave the house or we will kill your sons, because the land you are occupying belongs to the Kurds.\"They came to my house everyday.They abused me.One beat me three days ago.He came to my house with many men carrying weapons.He said, \"You must leave your house immediately.\"I told him that I agreed, because I had nothing to defend myself with.He grabbed my head and slammed it against the window of his car, and then threw me into the car.Then they put me in prison for two days.[88]\n\nWhen Human Rights Watch visited Khanaqin on June 1-2, 2003, PUK officials were still threatening Arab families who remained in the town.Ikhlas 'Awad, a thirty-four-year-old Arab woman who claimed she was born in Khanaqin in 1970, before the onset of Arabization, remained in her home in al-Shu'la neighborhood of Khanaqin, living together with two other Arab families who had been evicted from their homes.At the time Human Rights Watch visited their home, it was being guarded by U.S. armored cars to prevent further intimidation.\n\nIkhlas 'Awadand her family had purchased a destroyed Kurdish home probably a home belonging to a Kurdish family evicted under Arabization in 1992, and had reconstructed the home.When Kurdish forces took control of Khanaqin, four armed Kurds who identified themselves as Kurdish security forces and were in camouflage uniforms came to her home, beat her and her husband, and stole most of their household goods.Two days after this first attack, armed Kurdish security forces again came to their home, confiscated their nationality cards (a crucial ID document in Iraq), and evicted three families from their homes, taking them in cars to the neighboring town of al-Sa'diyya, where the family stayed for twenty days in a tent until they were able to obtain permission from U.S. forces to return to their home around May 20, 2003.\n\nThe family of Ikhlas 'Awad continued to face intimidation and threats from Kurdish officials even after they returned with permission from U.S. coalition forces.Two days before the Human Rights Watch visit to the family, a Kurdish official had come to their home with two armed Kurds, asking the family: \"Are you still here?You must leave the house immediately!Where is your husband?Do we need to arrest him again?\"Ikhlas 'Awad's husband fled the town, fearing arrest.The next morning, the same Kurdish official came again to the house, kicking down the door and threatening the remaining women: \"He said he would shoot me and all my children, that he would occupy the house and that it would be better if we leave peacefully.\"Ikhlas 'Awad then went to the local U.S. commanders, who immediately sent troops to guard the home.[89]\n\nMany other families in government-owned housing in Khanaqin faced similar eviction threats from PUK officials-including Kurdish and Turkoman families, in addition to Arab families.[90]It appears that the main motivation behind many of these evictions was to free up housing for PUK Peshmerga families, and the families of PUK members who had been killed (\"martyred\") by the government of Saddam Hussein, rather than to allow those displaced by Arabization to return.In many cases, the PUK families who wanted to lay claim to the housing had already written their names on the homes.\n\nThe Turkoman family of Khalid Rustum Ridha who had lived in Khanaqin for generations, faced such threats to leave their home.Soon after the Kurds took control of Khanaqin, a Kurdish man came to their home and wrote the name of his brother, Muhammad Kaidar, a PUK supporter who had been killed decades before, on the home's exterior wall, and told the family to leave.The family went to the U.S. forces based just a few hundred meters away, who put up a sign at the home saying that no one was allowed to evict the family by force.[91]A few days later, the brother of Muhammad Kaidar came back and tried to rip down the sign.When one of the sons of the family tried to stop him by telling him that U.S. forces had put up the sign, the brother responded, \"What coalition forces?We [Kurds] control Khanaqin,\" and hit the boy with a brick.Despite the protection provided by the U.S. troops, the family continued to be regularly intimidated and was considering leaving Khanaqin.[92]\n\nTwo of their immediate neighbors faced similar problems.Maysun Muhammad Shihab, a Kurd whose husband was a low-ranking Ba`th Party member,[93] explained that one week after the PUK arrived in Khanaqin, she was ordered to go to the PUK office and told that they had to evacuate their home within twenty-four hours, as it now belonged to the family of a slain PUK Peshmerga named Majid Karim Ghaydi: \"I told them that we are very poor and couldn't afford rent, and they said that was our problem.\"The family credited the U.S. forces with preventing their eviction by guarding the home: \"If the Americans were not here, we would have been kicked out on the first day.\"[94]\n\nMuhammad 'Ali Mandan, an Arab, lived in the same housing complex: \"When I came here, there were no Arabs or Kurds in the area, because of the heavy bombardment during the Iran-Iraq war.\"He said that after the 2003 war, his house was claimed by the mother of Hassan Mahmoud Sakha, a Kurd killed in 1963:\n\nAfter the fall of the government, Kurdish Peshmerga came to my house with weapons.They wrote on the main gate of my house that this house belongs to a Kurdish martyr. Then they informed me that the head of the Asayish [Kurdish security forces] wanted to see us, his name is 'Awad 'Abd al-Ghafur.I went to see him and he told me, \"If you don't leave your house, I will hit you and then kick you out-it is better to leave voluntarily.\"[95]\n\nFollowing the threats, Muhammad 'Ali Mandancontacted U.S. forces who came to provide security to the homes in the area.A few days afterwards, Kurdish officials threatened his wife, saying, \"If you go to the coalition forces again, you will see what will happen to you.\"[96]A member of the Kurdish family claiming the home came to rip down the sign U.S. troops had put up.\n\nIn al-'Askariyya neighborhood of Khanaqin, which was built by the Iraqi government on land that previously belonged to expelled Kurdish families, the Arab inhabitants faced similar problems.The family of Samer Nizar Jassem al-Tay, a Turkoman who had changed his ethnic identity to Arab in order to be allowed to stay in Khanaqin, bought their home in the al-'Askariyya neighborhood in 1998 from an Arab.Almost as soon as the PUK took control of Khanaqin, the family faced violent threats:\n\nThe day after, at sunrise, the [Kurdish] family next door came with the Peshmerga, kicked down our door, and came inside.It was 8 a.m.They told us that we had to leave by 11 a.m. or they would kill all of us in the house.They pushed down my mother.They said that if we didn't leave within three hours, they would throw grenades at us and the house would be our grave.They were wearing military uniforms.[97]\n\nThey were threatened multiple times over the next few days, until they approached U.S. troops.After they received U.S. protection, one of the Kurds who had threatened them visited the house again, telling the family that \"the coalition troops cannot protect you forever, because they will leave one day.\"[98]\n\nSome residents from Khanaqin had already been kicked out of their homes by returning Kurds who claimed to be the original owners.Shihab Salim 'Abdullah, the son of a Turkoman father and a Kurdish mother, changed his ethnic identity to Arab in order to remain in Khanaqin and joined the Ba`th Partyin order to keep his job at the post office.He purchased a home in the al-'Askariyya neighborhood in 1997, and later found out he was the third owner of a house originally seized from an expelled Kurd.After the war, a Kurd who had been expelled in the 1970s came to the house with his armed sons, and ordered Shihab to leave immediately.U.S. forces allowed the returning Kurd to stay in the home, telling Shihab that he could refer his dispute to the courts once they started functioning again.A second home that Shihab was building for his sons was also seized by Peshmerga, who used the unfinished building as a local base.[99]\n\nThe Civil Affairs (CA) unit of the U.S. forces in Khanaqin took steps to stop evictions inside the town of Khanaqin, regularly dispatching guards and even armor to homes under threat.Most of the CA team had served before in the Balkans, and realized the importance of responding immediately to revenge attacks and home evictions.However, by the time U.S. troops arrived in the Khanaqin area, the majority of Arabs had already fled the area, either during the war or because of threats from Kurdish forces.The PUK officials in Khanaqin also continued to defy U.S. orders not to engage in house evictions, despite repeated and direct requests.\n\nIn an interview with Human Rights Watch, the PUK representative in Khanaqin, Mala Bakhtiar, denied that his officials had committed forced evictions.Mala Bakhtiar, himself a victim of the Arabization policies, explained that the Iraqi government had evicted more than 90 percent of the area's Kurdish residents since the mid-1970s, a population he estimated at 75,000.Mala Bakhtiar gave a version of events radically different from that of the victims of forced evictions: \"Many Arabs had left before we arrived.We went to the Arabs who stayed, and told them peacefully that these lands didn't belong to them, and that they had to leave the land for the Kurds.They told us they were waiting for us and would leave.We didn't brutalize anybody.\"[100]Mala Bakhtiar also claimed that PUK leader Jalal Talabani had urged the reversal of Arabization, but had cautioned against violence during his visit to Khanaqin: \"[Talabani] said that Arabization was a wrong and brutal operation that had to be eliminated, but that there should be no brutality.\"[101]The walls of the PUK headquarters in Khanaqin were lined with the pictures of hundreds of PUK fighters and local Kurds who had been killed by Saddam Hussein's government.Outside, a large sign read in bad English (spelling corrected): \"We call upon the allies to help us in getting back our humanity and realize real freedom through the removal of Arabization, evacuation, and driving away.\"[102]\n\nCase Study: DoshivanVillage\n\nIn some villages in northern Iraq, the strong balance of power in favor of Kurdish forces-because of their close alliance to U.S. forces-and the absence of legal mechanisms to enforce rights has meant that Arabs with legitimate, pre-Arabization claims to homes were sometimes evicted by force.Sorting out land rights requires detailed searches of historical property records and balancing conflicting claims, but in some of the villages researched by Human Rights Watch, Arabs appeared to have at least prima facie claims on some homes.\n\nThe conflicting claims between Kurds and Arabs over the village of Doshivan, a village of some thirty-five houses with well-irrigated farm lands and orchards located in Shaikhan district, illustrates the need for fair and impartial procedures to sort out land claims.According to the former Arab residents, they were living in Doshivan since the 1940s, at the invitation of the Arab landlord from Mosul who owned all of the land of the village.During the fighting between the Iraqi government and the Kurdish Peshmerga of Mullah Mustafa Barzani in the 1970s, the Arab residents fled from Doshivan for several years, until the Iraqi government defeated Barzani's movement in 1974.\n\nAccording to the Arabs from Doshivan, when they left the village in the 1970s, an influential member of the Barzani clan, Khalid Shire, came to the village and farmed the land with other Peshmerga families.When the Iraqi government re-established control over the village, Shire fled with his fighters.In 2003, the same Shirereturned to the village and refused to allow the Arabs to return.Hussain 'Ali Hassan al-Hadidi, who was born in Doshivan in 1953 according to his identity documents, explained:\n\nAfter this war, the same guy [Khalid Shire] came back to our village.After we built our big houses and lived there all these years, he came back and took everything.We haven't been able to return because of this KDP guy, he is sitting in the village by force.[103]\n\nWhen Human Rights Watch went to visit Doshivan, they found only armed KDP Peshmerga in the village, unlike the mostly civilian Kurdish returnees found in most other villages in the region.The men were headed by Khalid Shire and his brother Hassan Muhammad Ibrahim, who wore the distinctive red head-dress of the Barzani clan, as did several other men in the group.Hassan Muhammad Ibrahim admitted that he and his followers had only lived in the village from 1971 to 1974, but claimed that they had come at the invitation of the landlord of the village.He also claimed that the village had lain in ruins between 1960 and 1971.Thirty-five Kurdish families would be housed in the village, including twenty families headed by widows of Kurdish men killed by the former Iraqi government.\n\nHuman Rights Watch located Haji Ridha 'Abbas Ridha, the Turkoman property agent who had represented Doshivan's landlord for decades, in order to clarify the resident history of the village.Haji Ridha 'Abbas Ridha provided clear support for the Arab position:\n\nThe [Arab] Hadidis were farmers in Doshivan from a very long time ago, from 1945 or so.They were farming the land for [the landowner's] family.They have the papers to show they were farming the land.\n\nThe Kurds came and took control of the land and kicked out the Arabs by force.It was in the time of Mulla Mustafa Barzani.They stayed for two or three years in this village, until the government supported the Arab tribe and kicked out Mulla Mustafa's people and brought back the Arabs.The Kurds came by force and kicked out the Arabs.The landowner didn't invite [the Kurds] onto his land, and they did not pay rent to the landlord. The Hadidi people used to farm for the landlord and give him twenty-five percent of the harvest.The landlord was happy and grateful, their relationship was good. There are villages that belong to the Kurds and where they brought Arabs in 1975 [under Arabization.]This village is an exception, it was an Arab village from the beginning.[104]\n\nProviding a final determination of the ownership rights of Doshivan will require a more detailed analysis of the ownership records of the village and the establishment of fair and equitable procedures.But the current fate of the Arab residents of Doshivan clearly illustrates that in the absence of property dispute mechanisms, the balance of force in favor of the Kurds has meant that even legitimate Arab claims were not being enforced.\n\nThe Situation of the Assyrians\n\nNot all of the victims of Arabization had the force, or the willingness, to expel Arab settlers by force. The small Assyrian Christian community of northern Iraq was also targeted for Arabization, being expelled from their homes in Kirkuk and losing much of their farmlands in Nineveh governorate.Many Assyrians ultimately emigrated out of Iraq, forming substantial communities in the United States and Europe.\n\nAccording to Assyrian officials, most of the Arabs who were brought by the Iraqi government to Arabize their villages remain in their homes, and the Assyrians do not have the force or political power to settle the disputes.Assyrian community leaders are concerned that the Arabs living in their communities continue to construct houses at an accelerated pace in order to strengthen their claims on the land.Only a fair and comprehensive property dispute mechanism can resolve the disputes, according to Assyrian Democratic Movement (ADM) representative William Warda:\n\nThe Assyrians need a property commission to determine the rights of our people.We stopped revenge attacks against the Ba'thists, stating they should be judged by the law.We don't think it is logical to deport the Arabs without finding a solution for them-they need to be taken to their origins, and have houses built, but not expelled through aggression.The best solution is to have a commission to study the Arabization policy of the regime and how to solve this problem.[105]\n\nU.S. and Coalition Efforts to Prevent Abuses\n\nU.S. troops, particularly their civil affairs (CA) components, took aggressive steps to combat forced evictions of Arabs and other vulnerable groups, although many of the forced evictions had already taken place.When U.S. troops established themselves in a particular area, they would normally institute a policy of no tolerance for \"house jackings\" and announce that whomever occupied a certain home at the time of the arrival of U.S. troops could remain in that home until property dispute mechanisms were established.U.S. troops rarely attempted to reverse expulsions of Arab settlers that had taken place prior to their arrival (with the notable exception of the Domiz case, discussed below), telling evicted Arabs as well as Kurds who had returned but not taken possession of their homes that they would have to wait until legal procedures were in place.\n\nCol. J. Bunche, commander of U.S. troops in the region of Rabi'a, very close to the Syrian border, explained that his orders were that \"whoever is on the land can stay for now.We have explained that to the folks around here.They understand that an international organization or an arm of the future government of Iraq will come and look at all the evidence and adjudicate [their claims].\"[106]Col. Arnold, in charge of the neighboring Sinjar area, was enforcing the same rule: \"I have had a few Kurds come and ask us what would happen if they took back their houses [from Arab families].I told them they would be arrested.\"[107]\n\nU.S. forces also played a crucial role in trying to implement and enforce a harvest-sharing agreement between the displaced Arab farmers, who had planted and fertilized the fields, and the returning Kurdish and other non-Arab farmers.U.S. troops drew up a harvest-sharing agreement signed by the major Kurdish and Arab representatives for the entire north, requiring the harvest to be shared 50-50 between the two parties.In Makhmour district, U.S. troops required farmers to seek permission from the local agricultural department and U.S. authorities before proceeding with the harvest.Troops patrolled local farmland to prevent unauthorized harvests, confiscating harvesting equipment until the proper permission was obtained.[108]\n\nIn reality, the simplistic 50-50 arrangement was almost impossible to implement.In many cases, Kurdish returnees harvested the crops and refused to share with the displaced Arabs who had planted the lands. On much of the land previously occupied by Arab settlers, third-party Arab laborers were hired by the Arab settlers to work the land, and the 50-50 arrangements imposed by the U.S. frequently failed to account for the rightful share of the laborers.The complexity of the harvest-sharing formulas, and widespread attempts to violate the agreements, quickly overwhelmed the capacity of the U.S. forces and led to frequent breakdowns of the process.\n\nIn addition, the U.S. military intervention into the harvesting disputes unleashed a flood of complaints of all types and additional work for already over-stretched troops: \"Once people realized that we resolved the harvest disputes, we got everyone showing up with all kinds of complaints.\"[109]In Makhmour district, the coalition troops tried to hand over as many of the complaints as possible to the local mayor's office in order to relieve their work load and increase local capacity.At the time of the Human Rights Watch visit in mid-June 2003, the mayor and almost the entire Kurdish administration of Makhmour were KDP members, a deficiency recognized by the local U.S. troops: \"The mayor's team came in, and they are all KDP, which is OK to begin with.But sooner or later, we will start pushing that he needs to have non-KDP. If he wants to stay around as mayor, he needs to do right for all the people of Makhmour, not just the [KDP] party.\"[110]U.S. coalition troops in Makhmour significantly diminished the power of the Kurdish political parties by demilitarizing their area of control, banning the wearing of uniforms except for U.S.-approved police forces and banning the carrying of weapons outside the home.[111]\n\nDomiz, Duhok Governorate\n\nOn at least one occasion, U.S. coalition troops acted to reverse the expulsion of Arabs by Kurdish forces, expelling the Kurds and returning the expelled Arabs.The Domiz housing complex, located in Duhok governorate, was originally constructed in 1986 by the Iraqi government to house military officials from a nearby base.In 1987, the Iraqi government allowed for some public buildings to be sol"
