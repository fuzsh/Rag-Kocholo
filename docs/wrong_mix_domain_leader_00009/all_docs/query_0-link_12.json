Speaking of the newly-formed newspapermen's association, Sada Al-Ahali remarks that this is not an innovation, because there was such an organization but it was abolished by the Martial Administration in 1949. The new draft press law, which was opposed by the newspapermen, has made them realize the necessity to have an association. A request was made in the early days of the present government. The approval of the Ministry of Interior was given after a long delay. The paper calls on the newspapermen to \"defend the principle of the freedom of press\" despite their own political views. This association should be made to develop into a \"union.\" Commenting on the \"Washington Star's\" suggestion that Americans contribute to the repairs of the Prophet's shrine in Medina, Ismail Ghanem, writing in Al-Yaadha with Palestine in mind, asks in the headline of his article, \"Do Moslems accept that Americans repair their Prophet's shrine?\" The answer is that if they \"accept any contribution from non-Moslem, whether Ameri- can, British or else, they would stain their history in an unprecedented manner.\" The \"washington Star's\" suggestion that contribution would help to gain Arab and Moslem sympathy is branded as an \"overt stratagem which the Americans would do better not to rely on it\", because it is a \"bribe\" for siding with \"American Imperialism\" against \"World Bolshevik tyranny.\" Ismail Ghanem believes that \"the Jewish agency may have inspired the idea.\" In connection with Saleh Jabr's reference to Communism in his statement, Ash-Shaab says that Communist activities are being exaggerated in the country. Indeed, there is a general discontentment because of the need for social justice. Ex-Staff.....

We recall, he says, that when the U.S. entered World War II, the people in Baghdad laughed at the figures of military production given by President Roosevelt, as they could not believe them. Today, the U.S. is determined to check Russian aggression. She is laying down plans to defend herself and to fulfil her international obligations, and they are being carried out. The Korean war proves the necessity of maintaining huge forces for preserving peace anywhere in the world for fear from the unlimited Soviet expansionsim. The Americans must have plans which may be adapted to new weapons and to the requirements of their foreign policy. The U.S.'s foreign policy, as backed by her armed force, aims at present to the following: 1) She wants to preserve her own democratic regime and her way of life against any aggression and at any cost. 2) She has divorced with the policy of appeasement which has proved to be costly in lives and money. 3) She seeks peace for herself and the peace-loving nations. Consequently, she upholds the UN and wants for it a high prestige. This year is to see many changes in the U.S.'s foreign policy. She is planning the defense of Asia against Communism and she is effectively participating in Korea. Experience since 1930 proves that the policy of appeasement leads to war. The U.S. is making tremendous efforts to strengthen Western Europe and the North Atlantic nations. Strong defense is the only guarantee against Russia's greed and against the Communist peril, prior to overcoming them. The U.S. does not like to see Western Europe overrun by Communist forces and to be forced to stage costly landings as in 1944. Truman, in his June 27, 1950 statement, has underscored the defense of the Philippines and of Indo-China. Indeed, the Philippines with Japan and Okinawa constitutes the front line in the Pacific. As for Formosa, the U.S. wants it to be held by a friend of hers. Chiang Kai-Shek is the man. The U.S. is provid- ing the French troops in Indo-China with arms and ammunitions to fight the Communists. The U.S. command sees still some dangerous spots, such as Siam, Burma, Afghanistan, Iran and Turkey. the U.S. is help- ing those countries earnestly fighting Communism. The......

Therefore, the U.S. is reinforcing not only her land forces but also her navy and air force. General Eisenhower left New York on February 16 for Europe to assume the supreme command of the NAT forces. He will organize them so as they fulfil their task in case of aggression. Holland will not be left helpless on the path of a Communist invasion. France has sent large forces to Indo- China; they have to be made up for. But, economic conditions in Western Europe have improved; this will much help General Eisenhower. SHORT NEWS.

Here is the full text of the protest voted by the Chamber' of Deputies on Thursday, March 1, and cabled to various heads of states, governments and parliaments throughout the world: \"The Iraqi Chamber of Deputies considers the tyrannic actions, the imperialistic persecutions and the barbarous pressure on the Moroccans and His Eminence the Sultan to comply with the will of the French authorities as inconsistent with human rights, as an outrage against the rights of the Moroccan people struggl- ing for their freedom and independence, and as a defy to the Arab nation. This has aroused the strong indignation and dis- contentment of its members. Unanimously it decided on March 1, 1951, to authorize me to condemn on behalf of its members the actions of the French Government, and its tyrannic and hostile policy which is contrary to Justice in an era when the continuance of imperialism anywhere is condemned.

(Liwa Al-Istiqlal. 3/2) MARCH 1 MEETING OF THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES. was Thursday's meeting of the Chamber of DeputiesLdevoted to the Moroccan case. However Justice Minister Hassan Sami Tatar was sworn in as Deputy for 1iyala (District of Khanaqin). New questions were put by deputies: Ahmed Al-Naqib is inquiring about a statement made by Dr. Jamali about the defense of the Middle East; Dhiban Al-Ghabban, about Jamali's statement branding China as aggressor, and about siding with one of the two world camps. 64 deputies tabled a resolution asking the Chamber of Deputies to protest against the actions of the French Government in Morocco and the Iraq government to adopt economic and diploma- tic sanctions against France after consulting with the other Arab states. The text of the resolution reads as follows: \"H.E. the President-of the Chamber of Deputies, \"French imperialistic tyranny in Morocco has reached its peak lately as General Juin, the French Resident, is threatening the Sultan with dethronment unless he subdues to him and carries out France's imperialistic wishes. That is why, we ask that this proposal of ours be submitted to the High Assembly for authorizing the Presidency to cable to the UN, the Big Powers, and their parliaments in the name of our High Assembly, in order to put on record the Iraqi people's and the Chamber's condemna- tion, so as to protest against French aggression, to consider Approved For Release 2002/01/18 : CIA-RDP83-00415R00770012e ? ? ? ?

Presidency should cable also to the Arab states, their League, and their parliaments in order to adopt the necessary measures to check French effervescence by all available diplomatic and economic means so as it heads and complies with the Moroccan people's demands for freedom, sovereignty and independence.\" Izziddin Al-Naqib, elaborating on the resolution suggested- that Iraq breaks diplomatic and economic relations with France as a means of pressure. The idea was supported by Mohammed Siddiq Shanshal Ahmed Aj-Jalili, Abdul Karim Kanna, Ismail Ghanem, Dhiban Al-Ghabban, Daud Aj-Jaf, and Faiq As-Samerrai. Abdul Karim Kanna said French actions in Morocco are reminiscent of France's behaviour in Syria in 1945. Ismail Ghanem accused Britain of connivance, saying that without its assent France would have refrained. Dhiban Al-Ghabban pointed that economic sanctions would hit at France's share of the Iraqi oil. To Interior Minister Omar Nadhmi's remark that the govern- ment has received no official information about developments in Morocco, Faiq As-Samerrai retorted that the Arab League discuss- ed the matter at its last meeting. In the end, the Chamber voted unanimously for the protest which Ahmed Al-Amer sent on its behalf. (Az-Zaman. 3/2) INDEPENDENCE PARTY'S MANIFESTO RE MOROCCO. In a manifesto issued by Mohammed Mahdi Kubba, the Independence Party says, \"The ordeal of Morocco is a test for the UN. Once again, the Arab public feels the extent to which the Western camp is attached to the UN charter. In case aggre- ssion has any significance, and the Western camp is aware of its responsibility for checking aggression, here is France, a member of the camp, striving to impose imperialism contrarily to the principles of the UN, to the principle of self-determina- tion, to the rules of international justice and to the human rights.\" The manifesto concludes, \"The Independence Party calls on the Iraqi people to ask the government for the necessary measures to break diplomatic and economic relations with France, for stunmoning the Arab League to have the other Arab governments adopt a similar stand, and for, at the same time, taking the matter to the UN. France's imperialistic policy is overtly inconsistent with the UN and, thus, places it in the position of aggressor ~aggaa~inst the rights of the Arab people of Morocco.\" (Liwa AAppro ea i-or*Release 2002/Q1/i84 CIA-RDP83-00415R007700j2 0 0 Approved For Release 2002/01/18 : CIA-RDP83-00415R007700120003-0 March 2 and 3, 1951. JEWISH EMIGRATION. Following the press report that the period for the dena- tionalization of Jews will not be extended beyond March 9, the number of applicants has considerably increased so that the registration offices at the Meer Tuweig Synagogue is remaining open until after midnight, reports Az-Zaman. The number of application forms has jumped to 37,500 representing about 100,000 names. It is expected to increase still more up to 120,000 names. In February, the Council of Ministers approved the dena- tionalization of 20,964 persons. Quoting Al-Tlidhal newspaper, of Mosul, Az-Zaman says that all the Jews of Mosul have reigster- ed for emigration. (Az-Zaman. 3/2) Quoting Deputy-Premier Towfiq As-Suwaidi, Al-Hawadith (3/2) affirms that the period of denationalization will not be extended beyond March 8. The actual number of emigrants who left Iraq is 32,000. The Council of Ministers has already approved the application of 90 , 000 Jews. The Council of Ministers has decided to consider the Jews stripped of their nationality and still in Iraq after March 8 as foreigners subjected to the Residence Law. However, the transportation of denationalized Jews will be intensified; and all of them will be taken away within two months from the dateline of March $. Nevertheless, the Jews who retain their Iraqi nationality, will be regarded as Iraqi citi- zens with full civic rights. The Chief Rabbi of the Jewish community in Basra explains in an official announcement that the attempt made against his life was instigated by the committeecharged with the transporta- tion of the Jewish emigrants in Basra. According to the announce. ment, on February 22, some persons went into his official residence and starting beatin him to death; but, he was rescued by \"some Jews and Moslems.\" (Al-Akhbar. 3/3) Dr. Dhia.....

After stressing the usefulness of the direct electoral system, Liwa Al-Istiglal says that the proposal submitted by the deputies is a test\" for the government's \"reform program.\" Sada Al-Ahali speaks of the Karachi conference. It underscores that the Islamic states need to establish closer relations and to form a bloc of their own. But, the conference has failed to point out the danger arising from imperialism; it should have, first of all, decided to resist the existing foreign influence on the Islamic states being exercized either directly or indirectly. Moreover, the conference should have studied the internal conditions of the Islamic states. These two points should have been given more attention by the confe- rence, The conference should have examined French tyranny over Morrocco, the presence of British bases in Iraq, Jordan and Egypt, the fact that Britain has placed its air bases in the Arab states at the disposal of the U.S., and the other fact that despite their wealth the Islamic states are living in a state of misery. In the end, the paper asks for other conferences, but which would be more representative of the people and which would thoroughly examine the various problems facing the Islamic states.

The Qudsi plan was put forward to keep the Arabs busy until the League passed its \"historical\" decision of siding with the West. When this phase was over, an American source has begun to talk of the \"Fertile Crescent\". Indeed, all these plans are meant to bind the Arab states to the West and to consolidate its imperialistic influence over them.

DG of Labor and Social Security Abdul Razzak Ibrahim returned in Baghdad after visiting Basra on instruction from the Ministry of Social Affairs to examine the causes of the B.P.C. workers' strike. He stated that the number of the B.P.C. workers on strike from the Zubair area is 300; others of the Maqina area have gone on strike in sympathy with them. The workers' main demands are: 1) a 50% wages increase, 2) payment for two extra hours daily for crossing the distance between their residence and their working place, and 3) payment for the days of the strike. He added that the company is prepared to implement the provisions of the Labor Law. Summing up the case, he said that the company is not prepared to negotiate unless the workers stop their strike and that the workers do not want to return to work unless their main demands are carried out. Moreover, the company suggested to deduce the days of the strike from the workers' leaves, and to shorten the distance between their work- ing place and their residence. (Al-Alam Al-Arabi. 3/4) On the 12th day of the strike, the strike committee says that the meeting with the company's representatives has been inconclusive. Supports......

Supports to the strike has come from the workers of the Iraq Grain Grinding Co., the union of the Printing Press Workers in Baghdad, and the Union of Cigarettes Factories Workers in Baghdad. (Al-Alain Al-Arabi. 3/4) According to reports from Basra, the strike is taking a \"more serious turn.\" None of the arrested workers has been released. According to the Propaganda Department news bulletin, the DG of Labor and Social Security left once again for Basra to settle the strike. (A1-Nabaa. 3/5) The BPC Workers' strike, says Liwa Al-Istiglal (3/5), is not the first of its kind; on several occasions, workers have been forced to defend their rights against foreign companies' unfairness. Moreover, workers employed by foreign companies should get better treatment for: 1) they are exploiting the country's resources and 2) they are foreign companies which know of the labor legislation in the world. The demands of the B.P.C. workers are \"fundamental\" and provided for not only in foreign legislation but also in the Iraqi. The government should not hesitate to submit to parliament labor laws, providing for individual labor contract and social security because the labor problem threatens the country's security and stability as long as foreign companies are persist- ing in their arbitrary treatment of the workers.

According to some rumors, Premier Nuri As-Said will head the delegation unless he is tied down by important affairs. In this case, Deputy-Premier Towfiq As-Suwaidi will lead it. The members of the delegation are to be Musa Ash-Shabandar, Minister in Damascus, Najib Ar-Rawi, Minister in Cairo, and Yussef Gailani, of the Foreign Office.

The paper ironically asks from where the information are to be received. If the press reports are not true, how then the U.S. which is the \"mother of imperialism\" has been forced to condemn French outrages? Moreover, how the Arab League is to hold a meeting for examining the matter? The paper concludes, \"Ye, the men in power, France's barbarous aggression against Morocco has reached the maximum limit, as French troops have outraged worship places, and French artillery is decimating Moroccans, slaughtering aged persons, women and children. If you are prevented from acting, make it known to the people so that they will be aware of your motives, as the people are talking of Morocco day and night.\" Blasting France, Tahsin Ali, writing in Az-Z_aman, says, \"\"The French government which falsely claims to be the alma matter of freedom and the champion of the weak peoples, is the most tyrannic and the cruelest imperialistic government on earth.\" After recalling French bombing of Damascus, Tahsin All points out that France is forgetting that the Arabs of the Maghreb fought and died for France during the two world wars, and they are still fighting in Indochina. Tahsin All would like the Arabs states to do more than sending a protest and he suggests \"boycotting\" France. PROTESTS AGAINST FRENCH ADMINISTRATION OF MOROCCO.

(Al-Ittihad Ad-Dasturi. 2/22) EDITORIAL COMMENTS. Writing in Al-Awoat A1-Baghdadiya (2/23), a paper belong- ing to Zaki Ahmed and now edited by Mohammed Mahdi Aj-Jawahery, ex-Senator Sadeq Al-Bassam hits the Anglo-Arab alliance and the way the Arab countries are governed. He deplores that the Arabs rid themselves of the Ottoman rule to fall under the \"worse subservience to London and to Washington.\" He underscores the nationalist character of the Arab Revolt; but, the subservience to Britain has cropped up after the partition of the Arab world by their so-called allies after World War I. The \"free Arabs\" are resisting foreign influence covered by so-called treaties of alliance and protocols of common defense; but, they have been \"denounced\" and \"accused of promoting some other foreign influence.\" What they want, in fact, is to set \"the governments on sound national bases.\" As for the Arab politicians, it is high time for them, as vuorld War III is seen at the horizon, to be fairer towards the people and to submit to its will after it has submitted to theirs for 30 years. Commenting on Stalin's latest statement, Sada Al-Ahali (2/23) believes that he hit more Britain than the U.S.; maybe he meant to draw the attention of the Labor Party's rank-and- file, and especially the \"progressive\" elements thereof, about the responsibility of Britain for driving the world to war by its compliance to the U.S. Switching to the Istanbul conference of the U.S. diplomats, the paper says, \"It is obvious that the U.S. is meddling with Middle Eastern affairs more and more. It intends to tie the area to its political and military plans in one way or other, in the name of defending it against aggression and in the name of offering it economical and technical aid. All that is to pave the way to bring it into the Western bloc, either through the Mediterranean pact or by means of the Atlantic Pact.\" Referring....

Referring to McGhee's visit to Egypt and to the press report that he is carrying an Anglo-American agreement for the use of the British air bases in Egypt by American planes, the paper adds, \"It seems that the results of the Istanbul conference are seriously affecting the existnce, security and fate of the Arab states. The air network to be set up in the area means harm to it...\" Commenting on the Istanbul conference, Al-Nabaa presumes that the American envoys must have discussed the alternative of binding the area to the North Atlantic Treaty or to set up the Mediterranean bloc. It believes that Turkey prefers to have the leadership of the Mediterranean bloc; but, the main two obstacles to such a pact is the Alexandretta Province problem and the Falestine question. \"How the 1yest may win the confidence of the Arab world?\" asks Al-Ittihad Ad-Dasturi (2/22) in the headline of its editorial. The answer is that it \"should stop defying the Arabs' right and aspirations.\" When thu, Arabs sided with the Democratic powers against the Axis, they were aware that the former were not sinless. However, they hoped a change of attitude towards the Arab world. Even, this hope has been disappointed because of Palestine and of the French rule of North Africa. Speaking of the \"peace crusade\", Salman Shaikh Daud, writing in Al-Hawadith (2/24), remarks that \"Moscow trumpets peace day and night.\" But, the matter is whether it is \"earnest or not.\" Indeed, peace is the desire of all. If Moscow were \"earnest\", everyone would have backed it. It is true that there are some Western statesmen who are promoting war in order to control the world, but they would have been a neglected minority, if the Soviet policy was not resorting to expansionism and conquest by force. After assailing the Jews of Iraq as \"intruders\", blaming their business partners for their patronship, and deploring the slowness of their exodus, Liwa Al-Istialal (2/23) comments on rumors that the period of the denationalization law will be extended.

The people have to be on the watch to foil any such attempt.\" Liwa Al_Istialal (2/23) believes that the law for settling the disputes over the Muntafik Liwa helps to preserve feudalism. Instead of expropriating the lands from the Sanad holders in order to give them to the \"Sirkals\", the government should partition them into small lots and give them to the tribesmen themselves. Instead of compensating the expropriated Sanad Holders in kind, the government should do it in cash if they already/own more than a maximum limit of lands.

During the debate on the income-tax amendment, the Independnece Party deputies assailed Deputy-Prime Minister 2owfiq As-Suwaidi and accused him of having used his influence to have a refund of taxes paid by the Eastern Tobacco Co. and of having transferred Jamil As-Salain,. then DG of Income- Tax, because he was opposed to the refund. The Deputy-Prime Minister was absent. But, the attack was opened by Siddiq Shanshal; he was followed by Ismail Ghanem and Faiq As-Samerrai.

The viest is endeavoring to \"break down the growing popular resistance to it\" in order to get fuller control of the area. Indeed, such conferences \"unveils\" the fact that the \"Western imperialists\" are preparing a new world war. Pointing out that the Arab states have not been consulted in the matters discussed at the conference, although they are related to the area, the paper says, \"The fact, that the Imperialists overlook the will of the Arab peoples because of the present Arab governments, is a strong evidence of these governments' neglect of the matters pertaining to their people.\" Commenting on a France-Presse report that at the Istanbul conference the American Ambassador in Riyadh informed them of King Ibn Saud's opposition to the Fertile Crescent Plan, Al-Yagdha believes that the correspondent must be either \"a Jew or pro-Jew\", because the matter has been put aside follow- ing the proposal of Syrian Premier Qudsi for Arab federation to the Arab League. Indeed, any bilateral uniop is meant to be but a step forward to the overall unity of the Arab world. Speaking of the \"tyrannic French imperialism\" in Morrocco, Al-Ittihad Ad-Dasturi says that France believes its tyrannic rule of Morrocco is \"eternal\" and it can kill the spirit of liberation and independence of the Morroccans. The French have \"invented a new theme to defame the nationalist movement in illorocco; they are accusing the Sultan and his supporters of Communism.\" Voicing support to the recent parliamentary motion for a direct electoral system, Sada Al-Ahali says that the proposal represents \"a sound trend\" for amending the electoral law. The matter has become a \"popular demand\". The paper concludes, \"The direct electoral system, which is the right way to any really fair elections, is one of the main pillars for building democracy in Iraq. To adopt it will be an important factor to enable the electors to exerciZe their right properly and will be a guarantee that their will will be respected.

In pursuit of genuine representation of the people\", 30 deputies are to table a motion in parliament asking for one-stage elections. They believe that the present electoral law, although a \"step forward\" in comparison to the previous one, \"should be abolished and replaced by a new one based on direct elections.\" Ten reasons are put forth; and they are as follows: 1) Such a system simplifies elections, shortens their period, and is easier for the interested parties. 2) It is more in accordance with the Constitution which provides for everyone the right to vote, as the present law compels primary electors to waive their right in favor of secondary electors who may act as it pleases them. 3) Direct elections allow more genuine representation of the people. 4) They establish a closer relationship between the deputy and his electors. 5) They compel deputies to take more care of their electors. 6)...

In the end, they conceded that some obstacles will have to be overcome, but the benefits are \"incommensurate\", foremost promoting a \"genuine parliamentary life\", which is the \"basis of any real reform.\" The deputies to sign the motion are: Edward Georgie, Basra Ismail Ghanem, Baghdad Jaffar Al-Qazwini, Hilla Jaffar Al-I'M:ugotar, Diwaniya Jamal Al-Niufti, Mosul Hanna Khayyat, Mosul Dhiban Al-Ghabban, Baghdad Rafiq As-Sayid Isa, Muntafik Salem Jaffar, Basra Sami Shawkat, Kut Saad Omar, Kerbala Salman Al-Ibrahim, Basra Saleh Bahr El-Oloum, Kerbala Sabih Mumtaz, Baghdad Abdul Razzaq Al-Uzri, Diwaniya Abdul Samad Al-Bechari, Basra Abdul Latif Jaffar, Basra Abdul Karim Al-Uzri, iviuntafik Abdul Hadi Al-Bechari, Basra Obeid Al-Haj Khalaf, Kut Izz,at Murad Al-Shaikh, Baghdad Izzidin Al-Naqib, Diyala All Kadhem Abul Temman, Baghdad Ghazi El-Elli, Baghdad Faiq As-Samerrai, Baghdad Qassim Al-Niufti Mosul Mohammed Jewad Jaffar, Baghdad Mohammed Jewad Haidar, Muntafik $ed Sh sia1 1'e'1os15 Approved Z 0 Od~i RP~I ~o q26 ) ,Oa PUT a ignu Approved For Release 2002/01/18 : CIA-RDP83-00415R007700120003-0 - 3 - February 25 and 26, 1951. anLLH J ER DENOUNCES SECT' RIANISM. Pointing out that the electoral campaign in Lebanon is based on sectarianism, Ash-Shaab (2/26) says that on this occa- sion Saleh Jabr was asked for his opinion about sectarianism. Senator Saleh Jabr stated, \"It is very grave to base politics on sectarianism or to use it as a political means. Sectarianism by itself is reactionary and is exploited by reactionaries, opportunists and the enemies of progress in order to attain their ends in backward societies, where ignorance prevails. It tears the country into helpless pieces... \"Sectarianism is a subversive movement to be fought by all means and to be eliminated. Any sectarianists should be fought without respite...... Reformists of any sect, race, party or group should promote Iraqi unity and fraternity among all Iraqis......\" After quoting the Constitution and the Koran, Senator oaleh Jabr said, \"Iraqis, whether Arab or Kurd, and Moslem or non-Moslem, should behave as one people and one country, united in their same goal of making the country progress and of raising the living standard of all. \"If, nevertheless, groups have to be established, they should be based on social, economic and political principles and by means of political parties comprising the persons who believe in the same principles and in the same political methods for achieving them.\" (Ash-Shaab. 2/26) THE JEWISH EXODUS. Whether the period for the denationalization law of the Jews will be extended or not is not yet known. More than one government official has told Az-Zaman that the matter has not yet been discussed by the Council of Ministers. However, the date limit for accepting applications has been set for February 25 by order of the Police Director of Travels. The applications signed in Baghdad only amount to about 35,000, noting that a whole family has one application form. That is why, no accurate estimates may be given about the number of applicants. But, as the date limit is nearing, their number is increasing; and the officials in charge are forced to work late during the night.

(Az-Zaman. 2/26) According to a Beirut message of the ANA, the Arab Higher Committee for Palestine has appealed to all the Arab states to stop the emigration of Jews to Israel. It expresses the fear that Israel will enlist them in its army and may use their knowledge of the Arabic language and of the Arab customs to harm the Arab states. (Liwa Al-Istiqlal. 2/25) Pointing out that almost 100,000 Jews have applied for emigration and that two thirds of them, although denationalized, are still here, Liwa Al-Istiglal (2/25) urges the government to place them in concentration camps so that they will not commit any act of sabotage. Moreover, it asks that their money be freezed. It believes that the Jews in Iraq are acting on direct- ives from Israel. ISLAMIC CONFERENCE. Believing that the Arabs' glory has dwindled because they were diverted from Islam, Ali Mahmud Shaikh Ali, writing in Az-Zaman about the Moslem conference of Karachi, deplores that the Karachi conference led to \"tragi-comedic\" decisions, foremost to consider any aggression against any Moslem state as being against the whole Islamic world. The conference, says the writer, has missed the point that the Islamic is being the object of continual aggression and outrage and that the authors thereof are their very allies. Indeed, Islam does neither approve of Communism nor of any serfdom. The conference should warn the authors of past and future acts of aggression. Speaking of the Karachi conference, Taha A1-Fayadh, who attended it, blames the Iraqi conference for having failed to send a governmental delegation or to have instructed its Charge d'Affaires to attend the conference as the other Moslem states did. He is gratified that the Moslem delegates concurred in their views. All- he says, complained of the fact that Islamic precepts are not fully followed, It is gratified by the deci- sion of the conference to consider any aggression against any Approved For Release 2002/01/18 : CIA-RDP83-00415R007700129 Oj3,Ai is ......

Pointing to the fact that a committee, with headquarters in Pakistan, has charge of seeing that the conference's deci- sions are carried out, the writer concludes that it is an evidence that the decisions will not be left \"ink on paper's. In the end, he hails the conference as \"an international Islamic organization.\" (As-Sijil. 2/25 and 2/26) MOROCCO. Commenting on an ANA report about the possibility of deporting the Moroccan sultan if he persists in his opposi- tion to France, Al-Alam Al-Arabi says that it is funny that Sharq Al-Adna, which broadcast the news item, tries to describe French Imperialism as a factor of democracy and justice. What is taking place in Morocco is part of the overall plan to build up the so-called free world in subjugated countries. Indeed, the Pleven Government has sold Morocco to the American imperialism against million of dollars. What France is doing in North Africa has been decided in Washington and approved by London. What is still more amazing is the silence kept by the Arab League. It connotes a tacit approval and that the Arabs have no more honor. Liwa Al-Istiglal (2/26) believes that the French move in Morocco is meant to strengthen French control and France has seized the opportunity that the U.S. is asking for air bases there. France is trying to persuade that the defense against Communism will be jeopardized if Uommunism acts through the Moroccan Independence Party. But, the Moroccan Independence Party, as any other Arab nationalist party, cannot be Communist, but fights imperialism, and is, in fact, for liberation. The iirab League has sufficed itself with the memorandum to the U. S. But, this is not enough ; the Arab states ought to act; they should approach the U.S., which is immediately responsi- ble for the situation, and they should adopt the necessary measures to prevent the recurrence of such an aggression.

The Senate convened yesterday morning. It was presided by Second Vice-President Hibatulla Mufti. It passed the follow- ing laws: 1) Ordinance No. 2 of 1950 for Exemption of Income-Tax; 2) Ordinance No. 3 of 1950 amending the Farm Machinery and Implements Law No. 32 of 1949; 3) Ordinance No. 4 for Addition of Funds to the 1950 Budget; 4) Law Establishing a Provident Fund for Municipalities. (Ash-ohaab) GENERAL SUPPORT VOICED FOR DIRECT ELECTORAL SYSTEM. Ash-Shaab hails the 30 deputies' parliamentary motion for direct elections as \"more than a good step\" which will have the support of all those aware of the need for reforms. How- ever, the paper would like the deputies to secure the women's right to vote as a preliminary step towards granting them the right of being elected to parliament. Speaking of the parliamentary motion, Al-Umma clamors, \"During the parliamentary life in Iraq, Iraqis has not received any action or proposal of parliament with so much enthusiasm and support.\" Criticizing...

Cr:ri':,icizing the present electoral system, the paper adds, \"The source of public satisfaction is due to the present parlia- mentary life and to the present electoral system, if ever it deserves to be called so. The present system does not fit with a genuine democratic system and the spirit of the Constitution.\" The paper concludes, \"In the end, we have to point to one fact which may be forgotten by the authorities. It is that the concept of direct elections will inevitably be carried out, despite the obstacles and the handicaps it may encounter. In- deed, this conept will be realized sooner or later.\" Pointing to the \"unanimous support\" to the 30 deputies' motion, Al-Nabaa does \"neither see it strange nor amazing\". The people want the \"distorted democracy imposed upon them\" to be changed. Moreover, this is an opportunity for the party in power to prove its sincere desire for \"drastic reform.\" Indeed, genuine parliamentary life is a sine qua non condition for such a reform. Al..-Yagdha says that the ten reasons set forth by the 30 deputies are unquestionable. Indeed, we cannot convince ourselves that elections allow the people to express their will as we are \"amidst the farce being staged.\" MISCELLANEOUS EDITORIALS. Stressing the popular opposition to the French rule in Morocco under the leadership of the Sultan and the Independence Party, Sada Al-Ahali says that the Moroccans want to live an honorable and free life. They are asking for their natural right to self-determination and for getting rid of the air bases network set up by the U.S. in agreement with France.\" Answering Ali Mahmud Shaikh Ali's criticism that religions are the cause of decadence on the occasion of the Karachi conference, Taha Al-Fayadh, writing in As-Siiil, says that the decadence of the Islamic world is not due to Islam but the politicians who have compromised with the Imperialists. The Arabs' glory is due to Islam. SHORT...... Approved For Release 2002/01/18 : CIA-RDP83-00415R007700120003-0 Approved For Release 2002/01/18 : CIA-RDP83-00415R007700120003-0 February 28, 1951.

The Prime Minister and the Deputy-Prime Minister were absent. The meeting was attended by the Ministers of Interior, of Works and Communications, of Finance, of Social Affairs, of Justice and of Economics. The Royal Iradas appointing Towfiq As-Suwaidi to the Deputy-Premiership and Om-r Nadhmi to the Interior were read out to advise the Chamber o\" the cabinet change. Independence Party Leader Mohammed Mahdi Kubba commented on the appointment of Suwaidi saying, \"I do say that the root of the evil is the political extemporaneousness in forming, reshuffling or patching the cabi- net ...... It is mostly felt, and it is an inevitable consequence, in the manner cabinets are formed out of members who differ in their political principles and line and who have no man-to-man understanding......\" He recalled that Suwaidi resigned from the Premiership because he ditfered with the \"Major Party\" (Constitu- tional Union tarty) in parliament. Then, the Chamber was advised of the receipt of a draft law for setting a skins association, which was forwarded to the Committee of Economic Affairs. Answering Siddiq Shanshal's question about the Tobacco Monopoly, Economics Minister Abdul Magid Mahmud pointed that the present system has benefited both the tobacco growers and the government.

Prompted by Egyptian Premier Nahas Pasha's appeal over the Cairo radio to all Moslems to contribute to the repairs of the mosque where the Prophet's sepulcher lies in Medina as 12 of its 237 columns are threatening to fall, Al-Yaadha (2/11) thanks Egypt for drawing the Islamic people's attention to the fact and urges the formation of committees for raising the needed funds. \"No Moslem, whether Arab or not, and no Arab, whether Moslem or not,\" asserts Liwa Al-Istiolal (2/12) \"have heard of the Saudi government's neglectness of the Prophet's sepulcher without anger and without wishing to have a share in its maintenance .. , ... It seems that the Saudi government prefers to buiic un huge castles for its Emirs, Ministers, and followers rather than to discharge its trusteeship of the sepulcher of the Prophet, the leader of all the Arabs.\" Anyhow, concludes the paper, we have to contribute to the repairs for alTerting the danger threatening the Prophet's sep-,:lcher. EDITORIAL COMMENTS. Ash-Shaab (2/11) sees signs of activities in the Middle East. T_hc ''nglo-Egyptian treaty negotiations are to be resumed. General Robertson is touring Arab capitals. The view to form a military force out of the Arab states for fulfilling some defensive tasks in the area is gaining propo- nents in the U.S. and Britain. Considered in the light of facts, the Arab League communique shows the Arab governments' inclina- tion to accept defensive duties. Speaking of the weakness of the Middle East in reference to an article published in the Daily Telegraph, AI-Akhbar (2/11) holds the U.S. and Britain responsible for it because they have denied the Arab states arms to which they are entitled under the treaty provisions. Writing in Al-Hawadith (2/12), Salman Shaikh Daud is blast- ing the British policy towards the Arabs. He says that \"an important secret has been unveiled\"; weizmann, in his memoirs, has disclosed that the mandate imposed on the Arab states was to enable Zionism t in a foothold in Palestine.

The whole case is one of \"conspiracy between the British and the Zionists since the Balfour Declaration.\" The Independence Party, says Liwa A1-Istialal (2/11), stated its opinion about the recent cabinet reshuffle, its spokesman was its leader, Mohammed Mahdi Kubba, at the Chamber of Deputies last Thursday.. The governme nt did not reply feeling that he is right.. Then the paper compares the cabinet posts to a chess board without telling who is the player, saying, \"There are chess pawns placed now and then on the board, or rather on the political stage; afterwards, they are removed to a store where they are kept available for any role to be played.\" Describing the people's feeling towards this game, it says, \"The people is watching; but he is annoyed by its repeti- tion. It is resenting it and expresses this sentiment whenever the opportunity avails itself.\" As for the \"chess pawns\", the paper says, \"The members of the Ruling Class are content with their lot. They consent to be brought in and removed from the cabinet with no reason they know except that their role is over. They cannot complain, lest they may be excommunicated and lose their influence congenital to ministerial offices and the consequent power to satisfy personal desires......\" This state of affairs, asserts the paper, is \"widening day after day the immense gap\" between the Ruling Class and the People.. Indeed, points out the paper, the Ruling Class' mentali- ty is \"deteriorating\"; under the Mandate, some of them were opposing the Imperialistic Policy while in power; but, nowadays they are paving the way for its achieving its goals. As the popular consciousness has increased in the postwar years, the mentality of the Ruling Class is to be \"blamed\"; it is \"!so magically attracted by cabinet posts that they have become ends by themselves instead of remaining the means for reform and public service.\" As agricultural resourses are considered as an important part of our national wealth, says Al-Ittihad Ad-Dasturi (2/12), the government is giving particular attention to the agricultural renaissance. The first step in this direction is the mechaniza- tion of the production means.

The Vice-President, who was in the chair, announced the receipt of new questions, such as the one of Siddiq Shanshal about the possibility for cabinet members to have as the same time their business, and of new draft laws. The draft laws are: 1) the teachers' service bill, 2) the ratification of the agreement concluded with CARE, and 3) the law for the settlement of the land disputes in the Niuntafik Liwa. However. the Chamber approved the Ordinance amending the Farm Machinery and Implements Law. The vote was 62 for and 15 against, The negative votes were cast by Abdul Samad Bechari, Abdul Kerim Kanna, Abdul Va,id Al-Qassab, Ali Abut Timman, Faiq As-Samerfai, Qassim Al-Mufti, Siddiq Sharshal, Mohammed Mahdi Kubba, Ismail Ghanem, Towfiq Al-Mukhtar. Husamiddin Jum'a, Razzouo Shammas, Salman Al-Ibrahim, Ahmed Al-Naqib, and Mohammed Moshhen Al-Hardan. The next item on the agenda was the Ordinance for the Export Tax on Dates. The opposition set forth three arguments. Siddiq Shanshal branded it as \"unconstitutional\". Ahmed Al- Naqib, Salman Al-Ibrahim and Edward Georgie stressed that in order to encourage exports such a tax should be lifted. Ahmed Al-Nagib and Salman Al-Ibrahim want Andrew Weir to pay the tax. The answer to the three-point criticism came from Dhia Jaffar, the Minister of Works and Communications. He contended the unconstitutionality of the ordinance on the ground that the export tax was already enacted by Parliament when the Customs Tariff was amended. Moreover, Andrew Weir refused to pay the tax and to get delivery of dates with the intention of revoking the contract. Thus, the Ordinance was made necessary. When the Ordinance was put to vote, the quorum was missing. The Chamber adjourned until Thursday, February 15. (Az-Zaman) THE LAW.....

The Chamber of Deputies has just announced to have received a draft law for the settlement of the land disputes in the Muntafik Liwa. This law, says the explanatory memorandum attached thereto, has been necessitated by the long-standing land disputes dating since the Ottoman regime and left outstande ing by the law of 1929. The problem has arisen from the fact that the Tapu Sanads for the grant in Tapu of Miri lands are held by persons other than the occupants who are cultivating them and who have, thus, acquired some rights on the lands in accordance with tribal practice and custom. The solution of the problem, as outlined by the draft law, is co compensate in cash or kind the Sanad holders as to be decided by the C.;uncil of Ministers in every case and to grant the Miri lands in Lazma to the occupants as it is unwise to make tribesmen emigrate from lands where they are settled.

APPEAL TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE REPAIRS OF THE MECCA MOSQUE. The following appeal has been launched by Asem Al-Gailani, Chief Notable of Baghdad: \"Moslems, in their native homelands and in their countries of emigration, have been alarmed by recent reports that the pillars of the Mosque of the Apostle of God (may God bless and preserve him) threaten to fall. \"We exalt H.M. King Faruk for his Royal patronage of the special Egyptian committee which H.E. Mustafa Nahas Pasha has proposed to form to raise funds for consolidating the pillars of the dearest Kiblah in the Islamic world. We extol the great Egyptian Government for opening a credit of 10,000 pounds for covering the expenses of the preliminary repairs. \"We urge all Moslems to raise contributions for this noble enterprise dictated by Islamic dignity in order to preserve the most sacred symbol of Islam throughout the ages. \"We ought to remind Moslems of the holy versus that \"Mosques are for God\" and \"0 sons of Adam, adorn every mosque\". Is it necessary to Elaborai;e on the duty of preserving the preeminent temple of God? (Az-Zaman) WORLD ISLAMIC CONFERENCE. Speaking of Islam on the occasion of the Islamic conference being bend -.t Karachi, Al-Ittihad Ad--Dasturi underscores that Islam is ''a political, social and economic doctrine of the first class\". that it is \"the religion of unity and of complete brother- hood, and is a major force appealing for peace, love, freedom and equality\", that \"for many centuries it was the vanguard of civilization\", and that it \"remained strong despite the Moslems' weakness and preserved their language, traditions and beliefs.\" Switching to the conference itself, the paper says, ~~Intern,~t. tonal conditions are on the side of the blessed move- ment repre3(;nted by the Islamic conference at Karachi. The delegates have to act earnestly and staunchly for inter-Moslem understanding and to lay down adequate plans for their coopera- tion an.r, for coordinating their struggle. They will succeed if they di:~T:1a,r good will.\" The paper, then, quotes one of the delegates saying that Moslems should unite to show the world that the proper remedy for the present ills is Islam, and it is neither Communism nor Capitalism.

EDITORIAL COMMENTS. Rep'ying to Sada Al-Ahali's comments on its article about Vice-President Bar ey's-speech in support of Zionism, Al-Ittihad Ad-Dasturi comments on the Arab League communique, saying: \"It is clear that the Arab League has no other way to choose than the practical one it did. If it sides with either world camp, it loses its political personality and both camps have not been fair to the Arabs in the Palestine ruestion. If it decided neutrality as advocated by the Communists of the world for the benefit of the Soviet camp and as called for by some sentimental nationalists, this neutrality would have been ridiculous in view of their present weakness and their shortage of arms, because neutrality by itself doesnot prevent from its being violated if reouired by ei.;her camp's interest. Taking into consideration the geographical position of the Arab states and the many resources they have, we find more than one important reason for the conflicting camps to violate the Arabs' neutrality, Therefore, we call on whcever is concerned over the national interest to t.akt into considorat:irr. the facts when examining su.-'.T a matte], \",resterdayl.s enei,'_ts\".
