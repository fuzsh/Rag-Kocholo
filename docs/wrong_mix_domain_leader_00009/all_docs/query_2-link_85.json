        "text": "BAGHDAD, Tuesday, March 20 — The former vice president of Iraq, Taha Yassin Ramadan, was hanged shortly before dawn Tuesday, the prime minister’s office said.\n\nHe was the highest-ranking person from Saddam Hussein’s government to be executed after the former president himself.\n\nMr. Ramadan was executed at 3:05 a.m. for his role in the killing of 148 Shiites in 1982. He was upset and fearful as he was led to the gallows, said Bassam Ridha, the adviser to the prime minister, Nuri Kamal al-Maliki.\n\nWitnesses to the execution included representatives of the Justice Ministry, the Interior Ministry and the prime minister’s office. Also in attendance was a judge from the Iraqi High Tribunal, the prosecutor in his case and Mr. Ramadan’s lawyer.\n\n“No, he was not quiet,” said Mr. Ridha. “He was scared, terrified, very terrified. You know how a man feels when he is about to be executed. He was not quiet, and he collapsed.”\n\nHowever, in contrast to other recent executions of members of Mr. Hussein’s government, the final moments were orderly and according to the Iraqi High Tribunal’s procedures, the prime minister’s office said. Mr. Ramadan’s lawyer took Mr. Ramadan’s final instructions for a will, it said.\n\n“The execution went smoothly without any trouble,” Mr. Ridha said. “His lawyer was with him from the beginning and watched the entire execution.”\n\nMr. Ramadan’s body is expected to be delivered later Tuesday to his family, but for the security of the family the government would not tell where it would be taken or to whom the body would be delivered. However, he will be buried where he wished to be buried, Mr. Ridha said.\n\nMr. Ramadan was convicted in November and sentenced to life in prison for his role in killing 148 Shiite residents of Dujail in 1982, but on Feb. 12 an appeals panel ruled that he should be executed.\n\nMr. Ramadan is the fourth member of the former government to be executed for his role in the murders. Mr. Hussein was hanged for the murders on Dec. 30. Also hanged, on Jan. 15, were two of his close associates: his half-brother Barzan Ibrahim al-Tikriti and Awad Hamad al-Bandar, the former chief judge.\n\nThe execution of Mr. Hussein was a debacle for the Iraqi government because it was captured on a cellphone camera. Video images were posted on the Internet showing people jeering and taunting the former president. Sunnis throughout the Middle East were furious at the his treatment. A furor also ensued when the hanging of Mr. Tikriti resulted in his decapitation.\n\nThe government in Salahuddin Province, of which Tikrit is the capital, said Mr. Ramadan had requested that his body be buried next to Mr. Hussein, who is buried in Ouja. That is the village near Tikrit where Mr. Hussein was born and which remains a family stronghold.\n\nMr. Ramadan, who was Kurdish, was born in Mosul in 1938. He rose through Baath Party ranks, coming to prominence in 1968 when the party ousted the president at that time. He became a member of Mr. Hussein’s inner circle and held numerous positions in the former government, including deputy prime minister and vice president. He assumed the vice presidency in 1991 and held the post until the government was overthrown by the American-led coalition on April 9, 2003.\n\nHe was captured by Kurdish forces in Mosul on Aug. 19, 2003.\n\nMeanwhile on Monday, as the fourth anniversary of the start of the war weighed on the minds of Iraqis, there was just one bomb explosion here in the capital, but violence persisted in the northern city of Kirkuk and in Tikrit, Kut and turbulent Diyala Province, north of Baghdad.\n\nThe war began in the early morning of March 20, 2003, in Baghdad, but it was still March 19 in Washington.\n\nWhile no single event stood out Monday, the day was in many ways emblematic of the violence that Iraqis suffer daily — two car bombs, several assassinations, at least one kidnapping and a number of other bombings. Each attack claimed only a few lives, but the pervasiveness of the violence is part of what has eroded Iraqi hopes for the future.\n\nThirty bodies were found in Baghdad, more than in recent days, raising the possibility that there is a renewal of the sectarian killings that people hoped were diminishing.\n\nIn the violence on Monday, a bomb exploded at a Shiite mosque near the Shorja market, one of Baghdad’s busiest. In a measure of how inured residents here have become to mayhem, within two hours the market area was again so crowded that it was difficult to walk around.\n\nThe explosion, which killed four and wounded 25, occurred during midday prayers and happened despite efforts to search everyone who entered the mosque. Yacoub Abu Alay, 26, one of the mosque guards who was searching people and confiscating any packages they carried, said the bomber must have had a collaborator inside who helped get the bomb in through the back door.\n\nOthers who were there blamed the American troops in the country, whom they view as occupiers.\n\n“What is our connection to the occupation?” asked Ahmed Shamkhi, 24. “We are against the occupier. There is nothing we can do but pray and ask God to rescue us from the occupiers and devils.”\n\nIn Kirkuk, an oil center near the semiautonomous region of Iraqi Kurdistan in the north, two car bombs exploded and a mortar round hit a residential area.\n\nThe Kirkuk police commander, Burhan Habib Tayeb, said the first bomb, which exploded near several government buildings and two mosques, took 13 lives, wounded 15 people and burned several cars.\n\nThe second bomb, which exploded near the home of the chief of a large Sunni tribe, did not harm anyone, and may have been detonated as a warning. Kurds and Arabs are in a pitched battle for control of Kirkuk.\n\nIraqis Say They Are Less Hopeful\n\nIraqis are more critical of the American presence and influence in their country, less optimistic about their nation’s future and more apprehensive in their daily lives than they have been since the war began, according to a new poll.\n\nThe poll, conducted for ABC News, USA Today, the BBC and ARD German television, showed increasingly hostile views of American troops and other forces in Iraq. Of the Iraqis surveyed, 51 percent said it was acceptable to attack the American-led forces, up from 17 percent in a similar poll conducted in 2005.\n\nSeventy-eight percent of those polled were opposed to the presence of troops from the United States and its allies, up from 65 percent in 2005.\n\nFewer Iraqis appear to expect a better future. In the latest poll, 40 percent expected things in the country to improve in the next year, compared with 69 percent in 2005..\n\nThe poll was based on in-person interviews with 2,212 adults throughout Iraq conducted from Feb. 25 through March 5. It has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. Complete results of the survey are available at abcnews.com /pollvault.html."
