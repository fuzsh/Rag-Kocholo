Not to be confused with the later comedy-drama series Mulligan's Stew.\n\nAlthough only six episodes were produced, the series remained in syndication until at least 1981.\n\nComments and Reviews\n\nmoax429\n\n2nd Oct 2016\n\nRemembered watching this in 5th grade in elementary school in Lansing, Michigan (I had no idea there were local connections); the class also received copies of the accompanying comic book. Saw Mulligan Stew one last time in 1979 (episode #5 only) when we lived in the Chicago suburb of Glenwood, Illinois; it aired on PBS affiliate WTTW, channel 11 in Chicago.\n\nSure wish this would be released on DVD.\n\nI also understand the young actress who played Micki (or was it Maggie?) is, sadly, no longer with us.\n\nAdd a Comment or Review about this TV show\n\nThis TV Series: Add Image : Add Video : Add Missing Info : Make Correction : Add to List : Add See Also : Add Tag : Edit Images : Show Image Data : Credits : BBCode"
