        "text": "TMR 20.5: “Bubble in My Fizziness” [MULLIGAN STEW]\n\nWacky Aphorisms vs. Cowboy Clichés. A title change that indicates a change in attitude. A bizarre publisher's catalog. The Red Swan. More letters! This section of Mulligan Stew is jam packed with fun riffs, more evidence of the intricate construction underlying this book, paranoia, puzzle pieces, and anger. This week's ...\n\nTMR 20.4: “The Sweat of Love” [MULLIGAN STEW]\n\n\"I SUCK!\" Kicking off with an \"erotic\" \"poem,\" this week's episode is nuts from the very start. There is a very serious explanation for the \"Flawless Play Restored: The Masque of Fungo\" (thanks to Tyrus Miller's piece in the Review of Contemporary Fiction), but this is surrounded by Nobel Prize talk, a breakdown of Lamont's ...\n\nTMR 20.3: “Drunken Condition of Both Teams” [MULLIGAN STEW]\n\nThis section of Mulligan Stew is particularly wild, featuring a western populated by Irishmen speaking in bad accents (and worse accents in The Club Zap), a long rambling set of hypotheticals about why the police haven't arrived to find Ned's body (spoiler: Halpin hasn't called them), a drunken baseball game featuring ...\n\nTMR 20.2: “THE ULTIMATE IN BIZARRE BEAUTY!!” [MULLIGAN STEW]\n\nLoveletters galore! Lists without context! Repurposing life for fiction! More puzzles! Terrible book reviews! An insufferable, pretentious elementary school essay! This episode has it all—and more! (As Lamont would say.) This week's music is \"All Your Fails\" by Kevin Drew. You can find all previous seasons of TMR on ...\n\nTMR 20.1: “Then You Do Not Approve of Nabokov?” [MULLIGAN STEW]\n\nChad and Brian kick off the new season in near hysterics over the first little chunk of Gilbert Sorrentino's Mulligan Stew. From talking about the rejection letters—and near batshit reader's report—prefacing the book, to all the bad writing about the \"flawless blue\" sky, to the ever-changing dialog tags in Anthony ...\n\nSeason Twenty of the Two Month Review: “Mulligan Stew” by Gilbert Sorrentino\n\nAs mentioned in this Reading the Dalkey Archive post, Mulligan Stew by Gilbert Sorrentino is going to be the next book featured on the Two Month Review podcast. For anyone new to this podcast, episodes drop weekly—recorded live on YouTube, then disseminated as a traditional podcast through Apple, Spotify, etc.—and ...\n\nMulligan Stew [Reading the Dalkey Archive]\n\nMulligan Stew Gilbert Sorrentino Original Publication: 1979 Original Publisher: Grove Press First Dalkey Archive Edition: 1996 \"Cheers!\" So this may be the first—but definitely not the last—entry in this series that is kind of weird. First off, unlike the earlier posts, which try to say ..."
