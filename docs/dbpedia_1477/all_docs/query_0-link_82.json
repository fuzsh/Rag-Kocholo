        "text": "New York has always been the lodestone for the artistic youngster from anyplace else. In they come from out of town with visions of stardom dancing in their heads. Some make it as spear carriers. Others are selected in the city's constant cullings of talent and find themselves raised above the crowd, enjoying a gleam of the spotlight.\n\nIt is these who have received the boost toward the top, and it is in New York that they will /earn if they can reach it. For those who go to watch, there is the thrill of seeing a new talent unfold, a new name emblazoned, a new career established. That is New York in the new season, and here are some of the bright new performers contributing to it.\n\nStage\n\nOne of the newest new faces on Broadway is attached to a dancer's body. Roger Minami is the dancer's name, he comes to New York from Honolulu via Hollywood and Las Vegas, and the show he helps to animate is the new Liza Minnelli musical, “The Act,” at the Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street (246‐0730). On second thought, “animate” is rather an anemic word to apply to Mr. Minami, who radiates ‐enough energy to supply the daily power requirements of, say, Staten Island.\n\nAs one of the show's seven talented chorus “gypsies,” Mr. Minami whirls through some fiendishly tricky footwork with beaming ease. The song called “Arthur in the Afternoon” finds him alone on stage with Miss Minnelli in a number dedicated to carefree lust, and he makes the most of it. Snapping outsize suspenders, strutting and sliding to Miss Minnelli's beck and call, he is at once innocent and all‐knowing.\n\nThese days, Ann Sachs spends most of her time on stage getting it in the neck. Miss Sachs is currently winning applause at the Martin Beck Theater, 302 West 45th Street (246‐6363), where, in the successful revival of “Dracula,” she plays the lovely Miss Lucy—unwilling bride‐to‐be of the king of the vampires.\n\nThe attractive young actress, looking sleek but vulnerable in marcelled blond hairdo (she is a natural brunette) and lacy flowing gowns, conveys a fetching mixture of despair and demonic glee as the battle against evil rages around her. Miss Sachs made her Broadway debut In 1970 in a drama called “Wilson in the Promise Land,” in which she played Woodrow Wilson as a boy. “Dracula,” then, is her Broadway debut as a woman—an event worth celebrating, even if it turned out to be a somewhat batty role.\n\nOne of the more affecting love scenes now being played on Broadway is the pne Molière wrote for his “Tartuffe,” which is being given a handsome revival at Circle in the Square, 50th Street, west of Broadway (2546330). The lovers, Mariane and Valère, are portrayed by Swoosie Kurtz and Victor Garber, both of them young actors and both of them old hands in the theater by virtue of their many, appearances Off Broadway and around the country. It is Mr. Garber's Broadway debut, however, and he makes it as stylishly as a young D'Artagnan. Caped and ringleted, and wearing an ambivalent scowl that only a lover could summon up, Mr. Garber makes his big scene with Miss Kurtz—a quarrel cum wooing—seem like the mating dance of some exotic bird.\n\nIn the space of a year, Kristen Vigard went from the cartoony rectitude of “Annie”—she originated the title role when that hit musical was taking shape at Connecticut's Goodspeed Opera House—to the scruffy rebelliousness of “Hair.” Not that Miss Vigard is scruffy in the’ revival of the “tribal love rock musical” at the Biltmore Theater, 47th Street and Broadway (JU 2‐5340). Far from it. In fact, the 14‐year‐old Miss Vigard projects a beacon of shining innocence as Crissy, the barely postpubertal youngster who worships the memory of a motorcyclist she once met at a Greenwich Village movie. Miss Vigard's silvery soprano rendition of “Frank Mills,” her hymn to that meeting, is a memorable resurrection of the 1960's spirit of peace and love.\n\nEmily Yancy isn't exactly a newcomer to Broadway—she had a part In Pearl Bailey's, long‐running “Hello, Dolly!”—but she seems to have come into her own as Aldonza, the slattern with a heart of gold, in the revival of “Man of La Mancha” at the Palace Theater, Broadway and 47th Street (757‐2626). Miss Yancy's previous outing on Broadway was in the briefly visible musical “1600 Pennsylvania Avenue,” in which she barely had time to warm up her vocal cords. These days, as the earthy tavern girl mistaken by the addled Don Quixote for his beloved Dulcinea, Miss Yancy has ample opportunity to raise the roof. She does so, with fire and grace.\n\nOff Broadway has a hit in David Mamet's new play, “A Life in the Theater,” at the Theater De Lys, 121 Christopher Street (WA 4‐8782), and the two‐character play now has two stars. When the play opened, top billing went to Ellis Rabb, befitting Mr. Rabb's stature as an accomplished actor and director. The other member of the cast, a relative beginner, had to settle for billing that read “With Peter Evans.”\n\nNow that the reviews are in, and they are largely favorable, it has been announced that Peter Evans has been raised to co‐star status. His real‐life progress is very much the stuff of which the play is made, for “A Life in the Theater” is about the changing relationship between two actors, one a novice, the other a seasoned (perhaps overseasoned) professional. Mr. Evans first attracted favorable notice in David Rabe's “Streamers.” His feat in the Mamet play is the convincing way he depicts the slow, steady growth cf a young actor from self‐effacing beginner to golf‐assertive professional. He does it so well, it could easily be his own story.\n\nROBERT BERKVIST\n\nScreen\n\nNot every screen newcomer flounces down a stairway as memorably as Katharine Hepburn did in “A Bill of Divorcement,” or Ali MacGraw did in “Goodbye, Columbus”; not every new leading man can make the splash Dustin Hoffman did in “The Graduate.” Not every bit player can land a first leading role like Sylvester Stallone's in “Rocky,” or, Lauren Bacall did in “To Have and Have Not,” teach Humphrey Bogart how to whistle. But everyone hopes for such things, everyone tries. And the current batch of movie neophytes is so large and so promising, that someone is almost certain to get lucky.\n\nThis season's most impressive new screen presence may well William Katt, even though “First Love,” in which he stars, is his second movie. He appeared last year in “Carrie,” playing Sissy Spacek's prom date, and his performance sparked comparisons to Robert Redford. But the role was on the small side, and he seems to have needed a second chance to shine his brightest. Mr. Katt is a tense, compelling actor, and he also has a handsome face framed by curly blond hair. When it comes to first impressions, that kind of thing helps, too. (“First Love” is the Baronet, Third Avenue and 59th Street, EL 5‐1663, and the Little Carnegie, 57th Street, east of Seventh Avenue, 246‐5123.)\n\nMr. Katt has a show business background—his mother, Barbara Hale, appeared on television for years in “Perry Mason”—but many of the electrifying new performers in “Short Eyes” have come to screen acting via more circuitous routes. Tito Goya, who plays the very popular Cupcakes in the film adaptation of Miguel Pinero's prison drama, first met Mr. Pifiero in Sing Sing when both were serving time, and he became interested in acting there; he has had small film roles in “Serpico,” “Marathon Man” and “Andy Warhol's Bad.” Jesé Perez, who plays the conciliatory Juan, was a shoeshine boy in 1950, when he was recruited for a part in the Broadway production of “South Pacific.” He has since accumulated a number of stage and television credits and two smaller film roles.\n\nShawn Elliott, cast as the feisty Paco, was a nightclub singer and stage actor before making his film debut in “Short Eyes,” and Joseph Carberry, who plays the murderous Longshoe, is a Vietnam veteran who is also new to the screen. Both Nathan George, who plays Ice, and Keith Davis, who plays the correction officer Mr. Brown, have had previous film experience, but neither has had a showcase as influential as “Short Eyes” may prove to be. (At the Paramount, 61st Street and Broadway, 247‐5070, and the Sutton, 57th Street at Third Avenue, PL 9‐1411.\n\n“Handle With Care” is another film full of talented performers, some of them reasonably new. Alix Elias, who plays the giggly Hot Coffee, a jovial hooker operating out of a mobile home, made her official screen debut as Min Farrow's roommate in “John and Mary,” a role for which she is not very well remembered, Charles Napier, as the bigamous trucker with the huge jaw, was a regular on television's “Baa Baa Black Sheep” series, and most of his previous film work has been for Russ Meyer.\n\nIf Diane Keaton is the most obvious selling point of “Looking for Mr. Goodbar,” which is now in many theaters, Richard Gere is almost as impressive in a much smaller role. Mr. Gere, who plays Miss Keaton's jittery, knife‐wielding suitor, Tony, has appeared extensively on the stage and twice previously on screen, but his best work is clearly yet to come. He will soon be seen in Terrence Malick's “Days of Heaven” and then in “Blood Brothers,” an adaptation of Richard Price's Bronx novel.\n\nDidi Conn gives a disarming performance in “You Light Up My Life,” and Kathleen Quinlan garnered rave reviews a few months ago in “I Never Promised You a Rose Garden,” but this season's hottest new leading ladies cone from abroad. François Truffaut's “The Man Who Loved Women” (Paris, 5814 Street, west of Fifth Avenue, MU 8‐2013) features an especially bright performance by Nelly Borgeaud, who plays Charles Denner's tempestuous and rather unpredictable married lover. The Swisshorn Miss Borgeaud has made only six films since 1951, the most familiar of them Mr. Truffaut's 1975 “Mississippi Mermaid.” And the British‐born Felicity Kendal, who plays the screenwriter June Mathis in Ken Russell's “Valentino” (at Columbia II, Second Avenue and 64th Street, 832‐2720), made her only other noteworthy screen appearance 13 years ago, James Ivory's “Shakespeare Wallah.” Isabelle Huppert, 22‐year‐old star of Claude Goretta's “The Lacemaker” (at the Fine Arts, 58th Street east of Park Avenue, PL 5‐6030), has been seen here only a couple of times previously—in the 1973 “Going Places,” in “César and Rosalie” and in Otto Preminger's “Rosebud”—but she has made 22 films in the last six years. Right now, she says, she's ready for a rest. Like Peter Firth, who had other, smaller parts before appearing in “Equus,” she has been lucky enough to find very early in her career, a single role so unusual that it will make her instantly familiar.\n\nJANET MASLIN\n\nCabaret\n\nSteve Ross has a commanding view of the main dining room and the bar at Backstage, 318 West 45th Street (581‐8447), as he sits behind a piano and alternately plays songs drawn from an endless bag of familiar tunes and sings others that may or may not have been familiar before, but take on a fresh quality in his treatment.\n\nMr. Ross has a voice that ranges from the casual throwaway of a singing cocktail pianist to a startlingly strong, open delivery. At either level, and on other levels as well, he delivers his songs with an interpretive zest that gives each one the aura of a distinctive miniproduction. Musically, he is a quick‐change artist, a master of the sleight‐of‐voice who, with a lift of an eyebrow and a loosening of the throat, can take his listeners on a kaleidoscopic whirl through one of the most provocative song collections in town. (Showtime, 10 P.M. to 3 A.M., tonight, tomorrow and Sunday; three‐drink minimum.at the piano bar tonight and tomorrow.)\n\nMarcia Lewis is a short, roly‐poly comedian and singer with a glint of madness lurking in her eye. At Barbarann, 349 West 46th Street (541‐6150), with the help of a variety of dresses and wigs hauled from the innards of several grab‐bag metal lockers, she is a bumptious fairy queen, a monstrous little girl in the throes of writing a letter to Santa Claus, an exuberant rhinestone cowgirl and several other objects of satirical delineation.\n\nThese guises exist as much in the fullness of her characterizations as in the skillful writing of Tracy Quinn, who provides Miss Lewis with the foundation on which she works. But Miss Lewis is more than a comedian rampant. She is also an actress and a singer, which not only contributes to her comic performances, but also warms them and deepens them by giving her the opportunity to season comedy with an occasional dash of straightforward singing. (Showtime, 9:30 P.M. tonight, tomorrow and Sunday, 11:30 P.M. tonight and tomorrow and 3 P.M. on Sunday; $6 music charge, $4 minimum, except for matinee, when it is $5 and $3.)\n\nJOHN S. WILSON\n\nMusic\n\nFollowers of avant‐garde music might hoot at the suggestion that Susan Davenny Wyner is not well known. Since her New York debut five years ago, the fetching young soprano has built a considerable reputation as an interpreter of contemporary music, bringing her refreshingly clear lyric voice and scrupulous musicianship to bear on such demanding worxs as Elliott Carter's “A Mirror on Which to Dwell,” whose world premiere she gave last season.\n\nNow, however, Miss Wyner is raising her voice in an older cause, with her recent debut in the title role of Monteverdi's 335‐year‐old masterpiece, “L'Incoronazione di Poppea,” at the New York City Opera (State Theater, Lincoln Center, 877‐4727). Miss Wyner, who will be the Poppea In tomorrow's matinee performance, also has been appearing this season at the City Opera as Pamina in Mozart's “The Magic Flute.” This year she was heard in New York in the American premiere of another 17th‐century opera, Cavaill's “Giasone,” given in a concert version by Clarion Concerts. However, her commitment to living composers no doubt will continue to be more than casual: She is married to one of the better ones, Yehudi Wyner.\n\nJames Conlon told an interviewer three years ago that he wanted “to avoid being a flash in the pan.” That was after he had become, at the age of 24, the youngest conductor ever to lead a full subscription concert of the New York Philharmonic. He has had his wish so far: His career has been exhibiting the steady glow of long‐term success.\n\nLast December, the dark‐haired Jullliard School graduate made his Metropolitan Opera debut, with Mozart's “Die Zauberflöte,” and this season he has been entrusted with 15 performances of Puccini's “La Bohème,” one of them a nonsubscription event tomorrow night (580‐9830). No question about it now: his face is going to become a familiar one to Met audiences.\n\nWhen Mr. Conlon led his first Met “Bohème” last month, Raymond Ericson, reviewing it for The New York Times wrote glowingly: “One is not likely to hear a more beautifully meshed performance ....” Perhaps other young maestros could learn a lesson from this: Avoid the flash and you may avoid the pan.\n\nSteven De Groote has yet to make his New York debut—that will happen Tuesday night at the 92d Street Y.M: Y.W.H.A. at Lexington Avenue (427‐6000, extension 720)—but already his is a name to reckon with. The slim 24‐year‐old pianist, who was born in South Africa of Belgian parents, came out of obscurity with a great rush this year. In May he won the Young Artists International Auditions in New York (his debut recital Tuesday is one of the prizes for that) and then, in September, captured one of the richest prizes in the musical world: the Van Cliburn competition in Fort Worth. The Cliburn prize brings with it, among its many rewards, a recital at Carnegie Hall on Dec. 12.\n\nThere is no fear that the young winner will be underexposed this season. If you miss his two recitals, you might want to look in on him when he plays the Schumann Piano Quintet at the 92d Street “Y” next April 25 with the Chilingirian String Quartet, whose cellist is Steven's brother, Philip.\n\nDONAL HENAHAN\n\njazz\n\nChico Freeman, who is leading a quintet at Sweet Basil, 88 Seventh Avenue South (242‐1785), on Sunday and Monday evenings this month, is a second‐generation tenor saxophonist. His father, Von Freeman, is perhaps the most respected modern jazz tenor saxophonist in Chicago.\n\nThe younger Mr. Freeman is already a formidable musician, and unlike a number of new players he is as concerned with the tradition with the future of jazz. When he plays with the Elvin Jones band, he projects an encyclopedic knowledge of the late John Coltrane's music, along with his own ideas. On his own, he ranges wider, from lyrical mainstream jazz to free‐form interactions.\n\nAnthony Davis, the pianist in Mr. Freeman's band and a group leader in his own right, is perhaps the most impressive young pianist to appear in the last year. Like Mr. Freeman, he is at home in a variety of styles. He has played avant‐garde music with New Datla Ahrki, but he has also devoted entire concerts to his arrangements of music by Duke Ellington, Charles Mingus and Thelonious Monk.\n\n(Showtimes, 10 and 11:30 P.M. and 1 A.M.; $2.50 music charge and two‐drink minimum.)\n\nROBERT PALMER\n\nScott Hamilton seems at first glance to be an anachronism. In his mid‐20s, with his hair parted neatly and slicked back, wearing a pencilline mustache, he looks remarkably like the almost legendary Bix Beiderbecke in the 1920's.\n\nBut Mr. Hamilton does not emulate Beiderbecke musically. At Eddie Condon's, 144 West 54th Street (265‐8277), where he leads his group Sunday nights between 8:30 P.M. and 2 A.M., he plays tenor saxophone (Beiderbecke played trumpet or cornet), drawing inspiration primarily from the style of the late Ben Webster, whose playing colored the jazz sty'les of the 1930's and 40's. Yet he is not imitating Webster either. Rather he uses him as a source (along with such other tenor saxophonists of the period as Coleman Hawkins and Lester Young) to create a style that carries echoes of the past within a very viable up‐to‐date context. (No minimum, no cover.)\n\nJOHN S. WILSON\n\nRock and Pop\n\nSister Sledge is actually four faces—a tour‐sister act from Philadelphia that is playing at the Starship Discovery discothèque, 347 West 41st Street (695‐1114), this weekend. Like many black family acts, Sister Sledge makes a firm point of the equal status of its members, with each sister having at least one chance at the lead‐singer's spot. But anyone who has seen the act live—a much better indication of its talents than its not always successful recordings—knows that there is one star in the group, and that's the youngest sister, Kathie.\n\nKathie Sledge is 18 years old now and in her first year at Temple University (the group tours only intermittently to accommodate academic schedules). The youngest Miss Sledge is one of those performers who seem to have enough personal wattage to light up a stage independently of electric illumination. She's a fine singer, and she moves with a loping adolescent grace. But her real gift is the unforced effervescence of her personality; this is one performer who really seems to love what she's doing. And as ever, a powerful projection of enthusiasm brings an enthusiastic response from an audience. (Showtime, 11 P.M. and 1 A.M., tonight, tomorrow and Sunday; $5 for members and $8 for guests tonight and Sunday, $8 and $10 tomorrow.)\n\nJOHN ROCKWELL\n\nDance\n\nWhere there is a will, there is a way. One of American ballet's most spectacular dancers, Ann Marie De Angelo of the Joffrey Ballet, obviously never tired of repeating such sentiments to herself. Too short to be politely ,termed petite, Miss De Angelo was consistently rejected by several major ballet companies because of her height.\n\nEven Robert Joffrey once turned her down at an audition because of her size. Yet today, Miss De Angelo is one of the company's leading dancers. This weekend alone she can be seen at the City Center, 131 West 55th Street (246‐8989), in principal roles in ballets that range from Arthur St. Léon's 19th‐century “La Vivandière” and Frederick Ashton's “Les Patineurs” to Gerald Arpino's “Viva Vivaldi!”\n\nIt is easy to see why Mr. Joffrey had a change of heart. The California‐raised young dancer has developed into a brilliant technician, nearly Bolshoi‐style in her ability to dazzle an audience. One of her trademarks, in fact, is the flamboyant leap, with the back leg touching the head, which was first seen here with Maya Plisetskaya.\n\nANNA KISSELGOFF\n\nTelevision\n\nWith the new television season already producing more than 20 new weekly series and countless specials, actors tend to be consumed like many potato chips. Most faces fade into one gigantic blur. Distinguishing between the adolescent family members of “The Fitzpatricks” and “Mulligan's Stew” demands an almost fanatical commitment to trivia.\n\nBut, fortunately for us and the acting profession, there are exceptions. By virtue of a clever concept, a good script or simply unadorned acting talent, some faces refuse to go gently into that anonymous blur. Among the season's select few are two—Beverly Archer and Oliver Clark CBS's “We've Got Each Other,” and four—Lance Kerwin, David Hubbard, Susan Myers and Lisa Peliken—on NBC's “James at 15.”\n\nMr. Clark began his television career in earnest as a fat patient “The Bob Newhart Show.” As the show progressed, though, the actor lost 110 pounds (he is now down to around the 200 mark), and the comic focus switched from fat jokes to insecurity jokes. Miss Archer's second acting experience ever was playing the hilariously gloomy daughter on short‐lived “Nancy Walker Show.” The 5 foot 10 inch, 110‐pound Miss Archer would simply have to stand next to Miss Walker, who pushes 5 in high heels, to get instant laughs. But height jokes are limited.\n\nIn “We've Got Each Other,” the two actors are cast as a married couple as passionately in love as Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler but as prone to goofy situations as Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy. Taking a romantic stroll through the park, they are the types whose clothes will get shagged mercilessly on seemingly harmless bushes. Through it all, they retain nice sense of balance between being silly and, with good humor, knowing that they are being silly. As “ordinary” looking as everyone's neighbors, Miss Archer and Mr. Clark have concocted an unusually attractive situation‐comedy mix. “We've Got Each Other” is on Saturdays at 8:30 P.M.\n\nWith the medium promising, under pressure, to change its violent ways this season, the schedule is filled with boys and girls getting into normal scrapes and dealing with the familiar heartbreaks of adolescence, “James at 15” is fairly typical of the genre. James has moved from a small town in the Northwest to the urban sprawl of Boston. As the new boy in school, he faces the formidable tasks of getting into new situations and making new friends.\n\nThe idea is hardly new, but Dan Wakefield, the writer, has managed give it some fresh twists by allowing James an offbeat cluster of friends. The guiding principle was obviously sociological. Played by Mr, Kerwin, James is the son of a schoolteacher. Paisely (Miss Pelikan) comes from wealthy “old Boston” background. Marlene (Miss Myers) is Irish Roman Catholic working class, with a plumber father and a policeman brother. And Sly (Mr. Hubbard) is a street‐smart black trying to downplay the fact that his parents are solidly middle class.\n\nMr. Hubbard, perhaps because he has the best part, turns out to the most vibrant and appealing personality in the series. Sly, whose real name is Ludwig (his parents are heavily into classical music), is a hip connoisseur of racial prejudices. Confronted by white bullies, his hand moves quickly to his empty back pocket because, as he explains later, “pale folks” are convinced that all black people carry knives. With little professional experience (in “Scott Joplin—King of Jazz,” with Billy Dee Williams, he plays Joplin as a boy), Mn Hubbard steps out quickly and smartly from the anonymous herd.\n\n“James at 15” is on Thursdays at 9 P.M.\n\nJoing J.
