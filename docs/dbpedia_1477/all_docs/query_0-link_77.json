        "text": "hello\n\nWe are currently doing interviews in the Vancouver Convention Centre at the 2024 VanWineFest.\n\nNEXT WEEK – We start Part One of this years coverage.\n\nCo-Hosts this year are Kelcie Jones, Leader of This is Wine School. Sommelier of the year, DJ Kearney Wine Director Terminal City Club Vancouver. Wine Educator and Judge. Michaela Morris, international wine writer, judge, speaker. Writes for Decanter. Italian wine specialist and once again Daenna van Mulligen, The Wine Diva. Writer, speaker and outstanding wine reviewer.\n\nIn order to give ourselves time to gather guest comments, edit the 22 interviews and get ready for at least 3 weeks of wine stories and journeys, this week is a repeat of last years Part One kick-off.\n\nTHE SHOW\n\nThis is our 17th year of covering the adventure of The Van Wine Fest!\n\nFor the Executive Director Harry Hertscheg and his top flight team of organizers, it’s their 44th annual.\n\n(Harry and keynote speaker Evan Goldstein will close our series in a couple of weeks)\n\nAlthough it’s still a amazing “blur” I think we did at least 20 interviews in just under four hours.\n\nA mix of winemakers and founders from Chile, Argentina, BC, Lodi, Napa, Sonoma and Washington!\n\nWe could not have made this journey without the help of media/marketing support from Ruby Gillett (Milk Creative Communications) and Danielle Giroux (Director- California Wines Canada)\n\nThank you both.\n\nHere’s Part One of this years Festival\n\nWe begin with the most amazing friend – Wine Director at Terminal City Club and much admired wine educator, speaker and wine judge, DJ Kearney.\n\nDJ and I were judging the Lt Governor awards last month and between flights I whispered “will you join me at VanWineFest for a couple of interviews. I love your questions and observations?”\n\nShe nodded OK! How lucky I was to know her?\n\nAs promised, DJ sat down for the first two interviews and to my complete surprise and delight, she stayed for almost the entire series of chats. A small grouping of chairs – knee to knee – because the crowd noise gets louder as the minutes click by. A lot of collective chatter. In the chairs, we all found ourselves leaning in to listen and comment. Tasted many outstanding wines the guests brought.\n\nLoved it. Best of all, this is just Part One of 3 weeks of interviews.\n\nThis weeks guests are:\n\nDJ Kearney – Wine Director (Terminal City Club) Wine Educator, Judge, Writer, Speaker and great friend.\n\nThe one and only DJ Kearney with her observations about Van Wine Fest history, the line up of this years wineries and general opinions about the state of today’s winemaking. She brings so many memorable stories and details.\n\nhttps://www.tcclub.com/\n\n@djwines\n\nJJ Dowell – Winemaker Lake Sonoma, Plume Wines. (Russian River, Sonoma, Alexander Valley, Napa Valley)\n\nJaime started her career “in the arts” at her family’s art gallery.\n\nThe art of wine came calling. Crooked Vine, Stony Ridge. Then off to New Zealand making high end Pinot Noir at Villa Maria.\n\nBack to California in 2011 to join Bonny Doon, Alpha Omega, Round Pond Estate in Napa and finally joined West Coast Wine Partners – which included the Stewart Family at Quails Gate – to oversee Lake Sonoma and Valley of the Moon Wines. Plume Wines were soon added to the portfolio.\n\nAll that experience shows in her wines. https://lakesonomawinery.com/\n\nChrista-Lee McWatters – McWatters Collection GM/Family (Penticton)\n\nTony Holler – Co-Owner Poplar Grove (Naramata Bench)\n\nDJ and I knew this was going to be fast, informative and lots of fun.\n\nChrista-Lee and Tony LOVE talking about wine. Theirs and many others.\n\nBut they also have new events and growth.\n\nAt Time Family of Wines in Penticton Christa-Lee has opened OROLO Restaurant with Damian Cole as Head Chef. Fine dining friends.\n\nShe was also pouring her Father Harry’s last vintage. A 2017 Brut!\n\nCheers to Harry McWatters.\n\nwww.timewines.ca\n\nTony Holler poured his Pinot Gris “it has to be poured at this event.”\n\nAnd also revealed his new culinary team at Poplar Grove Restaurant.\n\nTiming says Tony “its all about timing” His executive chef moved on to Canoe in Toronto and at the same time Executive Chef Stacey Johnson and Chef de Cuisine Minette Lotz came available at Naramata Inn. Think about it. That team in that room with that view? Wow!\n\nTruly loved DJ’s comments.\n\nwww.poplargrove.ca\n\nOn my way into the Convention Centre I bumped into Chris Turyk and his Father Tim from Unsworth in the Cowichan Valley.\n\nI reminded Chris that last year I stood in front of their Unsworth pouring table but the line-up just kept getting bigger and bigger and we never got an interview done.\n\nSo, this year we put two chairs together and had a conversation until someone asked if they could have their chairs back.\n\nTalking about Unsworth, the Cowichan Valley, the Jackson Family adding Blue Grouse to their Cowichan Portfolio, what he was pouring at the festival (Charme de l’ile NV).\n\nMy thanks to Chris, Tim and Unsworth.\n\nwww.unsworthvineyards.com\n\nSTORIES WE’RE WORKING ON:\n\nPart One of 2024 VanWineFest\n\nHarry Hertscheg – Executive Director VanWineFest\n\nNathalie Bonhomme – Le Vins Bonhomme (Spain)\n\nDonal Black – House of Smith (Charles Smith portfolio – Washington)\n\nRichard Kanazawa – Winemaker Bench 1775 (Naramata Bench)\n\nMichael Kullman – CEO and Winemaker at Osoyoos LaRose\n\nMichael Abbott – GM Blue Grouse (Cowichan Valley)\n\nStephen Neumann – Burrowing Owl Brand Ambassador (Oliver)\n\nhello\n\nThis Years Winner. Last years winner. Plus Whitehorse and Edinburgh\n\nTHE SHOW\n\nMaking great whisky is serious business.\n\nWhisky takes time. You can create it and leave it in barrel “while your kids grow up and head off to college” kind of time.\n\nFor example Paradigm Spirits -The Heritage Collection – Whisky of the Year in Canada spent 19 years in barrel. Then along came friends and partners Michelle deBus and Irma Joeveer who were just beginning their whisky journey. They purchased the filled barrels to start Paradigm.\n\nThen blended in some Oloroso Sherry and found a stunning balance between the corn whisky and sherry.\n\nDavin de Kergommeaux Canada’s Whisky authority and founder of the Canadian Whisky Awards describes The Heritage as having\n\n“sublime complexity and elegance with fresh fruity top notes”\n\nThis is a really nice story of people who dreamt a dream of making whisky and how it all lead to being named Whiskey of the Year in Canada. Besting 200 other whiskeys.\n\nOur guests are Irma Joeveer and Michelle Debus\n\nwww.paradigmspirits.com\n\nBob Baxter – Two Brewers Whisky. Whitehorse, Yukon\n\nAt the Canadian Whisky Awards, Two Brewers put on a show.\n\nWon Single Malt Whisky of the Year – Release 41\n\nWon 3 Gold – Releases 41/36/37\n\nWon 2 Silver Yukon Single Malt Whisky 38 and 39\n\nBob has been on Tasting Room before and I was delighted to catch up with him again.\n\nI like this man and his whisky. They keep winning a number of awards in Canada and the World. His attitude is…. we appreciate it but we have whisky to craft and that’s way more important. They’re brewers first and bring those smarts to their spirits. They also use some of the craft beer grains in their whisky making.\n\nBob is joined by his daughter Corey. She’s with the marketing department.\n\nHis son has joined the whisky makers. It’s truly a family thing.\n\nwww.twobrewerswhisky.com\n\nRob Carpenter – co-founder / Calum Rae – Distillery Manager\n\nHolyrood Distillery Edinburgh (Old Town)\n\nOctober 2023 Holyrood launches their 1st whisky Arrival. It’s one of the first single malt whiskies produced in Edinburgh in over 100 years.\n\nWorking in the cellar with Butts-Hogs Heads-Bourbon Barrels and Rum Barriques.\n\nPlaying with flavours eg: Heritage Barleys-Special Malts-Yeast Strains\n\nHave a listen about their latest release on World Whisky Day 2023. Lovingly called Mezcal Moonshine.\n\nhttps://holyrooddistillery.co.uk/\n\nJames Lester – co-founder of Sons of Vancouver\n\nLast years Canadian Whisky of the Year\n\nPalm Trees and a Tropical Breeze came from Sons of Vancouver Distilling.\n\nThey sent their whisky but stayed home. There was no way they would be named Whisky of the Year.\n\nWell, a year later everything’s changed. For them and I think for Canadian Whisky. How they taste and how they’re marketed.\n\nThis year they won Gold with\n\nSummer Road Trip Across the Midwest\n\nPalm Trees and a Tropical Breeze\n\nDesert Grass and Blue Agave\n\nWon Silver with\n\nRaiding Nona’s Liquor Cabinet\n\nLove this company and their vision. Making whisky and marketing it in a whole new way.\n\nChanging the next generation of spirit makers. Teaching their methods to those who want to sign up for classes.\n\nHeads up – They sell out quickly!! James explains the very best way to get your hands on their “expressions” before they’re gone.\n\nJames leaves us with a couple of teases of what’s coming up this year.\n\nwww.sonsofvancouver.ca\n\nCongratulations also to Stillhead Distilling in Duncan. Winner of multiple Golds and 4 Bronze. We’ll go find them for an interview asap.\n\nwww.stillhead.ca\n\nSTORIES WE’RE WORKING ON\n\nA conversation about Alberta\n\nAnd BC Wines.\n\nTownship 7\n\nhello\n\nVictoria Whisky Fest & Canadian Whisky Awards\n\nTHE SHOW\n\n“Friendship is like Whisky – the older the better”\n\nYes, my friends its our annual trek to Victoria’s inner harbour for the 18th annual Victoria Whisky Festival and the Canadian Whisky Awards.\n\nIt was founder of the awards Davin de Kergomeaux who whispered in my ear wondering why I wasn’t attending or tasting or writing about his Whisky Awards. On second thought I think the voice in my ear was me saying\n\n“how could you possibly miss this?” just after I had missed the events about 6-7 years ago.\n\nI knew almost nothing about Whisky but my thinking was the same as wine – 17 years ago – every interview is going to be a master class. Pay attention and you could learn all about wine and pass it on to the listeners.\n\nI’m pleased to welcome to Tasting Room Radio –\n\nDavin de Kergommeaux – founder of the Canadian Whisky Awards.\n\nThe Canadian Whisky Awards, held annually with the Victoria Whisky Festival, is the first and only competition dedicated solely to Canadian Whisky.\n\nThe Awards have become the first stop for whisky producers, distributors, retailers and fans looking for the very best Canadian whiskies.\n\nDavin is the world’s leading authority on Canadian Whisky. He also has three books available on Canadian Whisky with a fourth coming in March!\n\nDavin assembled 10 judges and sent them nearly 200 competing whiskies to blind taste. Davin announces the winner in his interview. We talk to the winners next week.\n\nwww.canadianwhiskyawards.com\n\nwww.canadianwhisky.org\n\nDr. Graeme Macaloney PEng, PhD. – Macaloney’s Island Distillery (Saanich)\n\nProud owner of 5 world whisky awards including Worlds best Potstill – Kildara. They are a non-chilled, filtered, no colour added distillery.\n\nIn our 8-10 minute interview I think I asked 3 perhaps 4 questions – Dr Graeme handled the rest.\n\nIt was like a masterclass. A charming man in a Cameron Kilt.\n\nHe won Gold for his 54ppm Peat Project.\n\nwww.macaloneydistillers.com\n\nTish Harcus – Manager Canadian Club Whisky since 1988. Canadian Club itself since 1858.\n\nwww.canadianclub.com\n\nJames Neil – Bowmore Distillery. The oldest distillery in Islay. On the shores of Lochindaal since 1779. Also home to one of the world’s oldest Scotch maturation warehouses – The No 1 Vault.\n\nJames poured Bowmore 22 Aston Martin\n\nwww.bowmore.com\n\nThey took part in the Great Whisky Debate with\n\nMicah Dew from Maker’s Mark.\n\nWords flew, one liners were exchanged and they still remain long time friends. Micah was busy with a masterclass but we thank Tish and James for coming by.\n\nwww.makersmark.com\n\nChris Read –Shelter Point Distillery. Campbell River.\n\nDistinctly Vancouver Island. Uniquely Shelter Point.\n\nBy the time Chris sat down we knew Shelter Point had won 2 Bronze medals for their Oak Cask Single Malt (smoke, spices, honey, leather and a wiff of ocean)\n\nand their flagship Evans Family Reserve.\n\n(vanilla, tannins, dark chocolate, coconut, citrus, berries, cloves.)\n\nChris explained the unique influences in their island location. It was like poetry.\n\nwww.shelterpoint.ca\n\nNEXT WEEK –\n\nRob Carpenter. Holyrood(Edinburgh)\n\nCalum Rae – Holyrood Distillery Manager\n\nBob Baxter – Two Brewers Whitehorse.\n\nIrma Joeveer and Michelle Debus –\n\nCo-founders of Paradigm Spirits\n\nLondon Ontario –\n\n2022 Heritage Collection Canadian Whisky of the Year\n\nA 19 year old cask strength single grain Whisky.\n\nFrom already filled casks they bought to start their distillery. Their oloroso sherry blending was brilliant. “sublime complexity and elegance” (davin)\n\nMade in the former Kellogg’s factory using some of the same grains for their future Whiskies.\n\nWhat a story.\n\nwww.paradigmspirits.com\n\nSTORIES WERE WORKING ON\n\nVan Wine Fest\n\nTownship 7\n\nFort Berens\n\nThe provincial politics of BC Wine\n\nhello\n\nJohn Skinner on his Painted Rock Wines /VJ Gandhi: making our wines available in USA.\n\nTHE SHOW\n\n“If Painted Rock is going to compete with the best in the world we must have confidence in our terroir and allow it to express its uniqueness. That’s why we are 100% Estate.” John Skinner\n\nJohn Skinner and Valeria Tait planted Painted Rock in 2006, a year before we moved to the Naramata Bench.

He was 100 years old.\n\nThis is his story, as told to yours truly into a nasty microphone in the lobby of the Hotel Vancouver 2016.\n\nHe had just released his memoir A Glass Full of Miracles.\n\n(Note – on his way from Croatia to Napa he travelled across the Atlantic and by train across Canada to Vancouver for a lumberjack job he had applied for. The job was gone by the time he reached the west coast. So, Mike washed dishes until he heard of a winemaking job in Napa and straight south he went)\n\nSteven Spurrier, a wine expert from England who ran a fine wine shop in Paris, decided it would be fun to organize a blind tasting to coincide with America’s Bicentennial celebrations in 1976. For the tasting, he gathered together the best French judges, the finest French wines, and to salute America on its 200th anniversary he added in a few wines from some upstart winemakers in California. Steven hoped the tasting would bring favorable attention to his wine shop. But he didn’t have any idea of the impact that his Bicentennial tasting would have on the world of wine.\n\nAndré Tchelistcheff, along with Jim Barrett, had hand-carried an armload of California wines to Paris for the competition. The blind tasting was held at the InterContinental Hotel in the center of Paris. The morning competition was devoted to white wines and the afternoon was devoted to the reds. And Steven Spurrier brought together the very best white wines of Burgundy: a 1973 Meursault-Charmes, a 1973 Beaune Clos des Mouches, a 1973 Bâtard-Montrachet, and a 1972 Puligny-Montrachet Les Pucelles.\n\nAlongside these French legends there was the 1973 Chateau Montelena Chardonnay crafted by Mike Grgich, and other Chardonnays from California that the French judges had never heard of either. The judges expected to sniff and gag when they tasted the California wines.\n\nBut it didn’t happen that way. The nine French judges blind tasted the white wines and graded each of them. The winner was the Chateau Montelena Chardonnay that Mike Grgich had made, with 132 points, the highest total scored of any of the wines, red or white, in the tasting. It was the champion! Then, to add insult to injury, the third and fourth places went to Chalone Vineyard and Spring Mountain Vineyard.\n\nTRR Jan 6 Mike Grgich Part Two 1011\n\nIn the afternoon tasting of the red wines, the French judges gave their top ranking to Warren Winiarski for his 1973 Stag’s Leap Cabernet Sauvignon, beating the best wines of Bordeaux, among them a 1970 Château Mouton-Rothschild, a 1970 Château Haut Brion, a 1970 Château Montrose from Saint-Estèphe, and a 1971 Château Léoville-Las-Cases from Saint-Julien.\n\nThe judges were shocked as was Steven Spurrier.\n\nUpstarts from the Napa Valley had won both categories, against the very best wines of France. The French judges were speechless and a few tried to suppress the results, but without success. The following week, George Tabor’s story in Time magazine announced the American triumph, and it sent shock waves throughout the world of wine. Mike received the news that they had won by a congratulatory telegram from Jim Barrett in Paris. That was the first he learned that his wine was even in the competition.\n\nSoon, though, the importance of what had happened began to sink in..\n\nOn July 4, 1977, Mike Grgich and Austin Hills, of the Hills Bros. Coffee Company, broke ground to start Grgich Hills Cellar, which from the start sold wines that were in high demand, based on Mike Grgich’s reputation as the winemaker who won the Paris Tasting. Gradually, the winery purchased 366 acres, spread over five vineyards within the Napa Valley, allowing all Grgich Hills wines to be produced solely from estate grown grapes. In recognition of that significant achievement, the winery changed its name to Grgich Hills Estate.\n\nThe Paris Tasting revolutionized the wine world, establishing Napa Valley’s reputation as a world-class wine region! First, it shattered the myth that only French soil can produce world-class wines. For decades New World winemakers had all been stuck in that mindset and this finally broke through it. Second, the victory pumped new energy into the California wine industry, particularly in the Napa Valley. Vintners were proud to be part of what was a revolution in American wine but they still had a long way to go. So they redoubled their efforts to make better wines each year.\n\nCalifornia’s victory also inspired other winemakers in different parts of the world. Breaking the myth of French superiority gave new hope and energy to winemakers in South Africa, Italy, Chile, Australia, New Zealand, and even in Mike’s native Croatia. Now they joined the race to make world-class wines, and as the years unfolded California winemakers also shared with them their technology and know-how. As part of that effort, Mike returned to Croatia in 1996 and started a new winery in order to share what he had learned with young winemakers in his homeland.\n\nGeorge Taber, the Time magazine journalist who first reported the tasting, in 2005 wrote a detailed account of the event and its impact in his book, “Judgment of Paris: California vs. France and the Historic 1976 Paris Tasting That Revolutionized Wine.”\n\nAs a result of his historic contributions to making world-class wine in California, Miljenko “Mike” Grgich was inducted into the Vintner Hall of Fame in 2008.\n\nA Hollywood version of this story was actually true but not much. It was called Bottleshock.\n\nWe salute the great Mike Grgich.\n\nSTORIES WE’RE WORKING ON\n\nFort Berens\n\nSons of Vancouver\n\nHarry Hertscheg – Tales of the 2024 Van Wine Fest\n\nWhisky specials coming\n\nhello\n\nWinter Wine Getaways in The Okanagan!\n\nThe SHOW\n\nA December in BC wine country is like no other month.\n\nHarvest is done .

A 54% reduction in crop and long term damage to vineyards.\n\nStrangely, while the crop was reduced, the colder weather led to fewer clusters on the vines which in turn led to rapid ripening when Summer and Fall returned. Great flavours in the whites and complex concentrated reds followed.\n\nMary and I tasted:\n\nBenchmark Series 2021 Viogner.\n\nFrom one of the best vineyards in Canada – Fools Gold Vineyard in North Oliver. Owner is vineyard manager Mark Antonello. Planted over two decades ago by his Father-law the legendary Richard Cleave.
