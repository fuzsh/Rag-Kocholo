        "text": "Boneless Country Style Pork Ribs are smothered in a smoky sweet marinade and cooked low and slow in the slow cooker until they’re perfectly fork tender.\n\nCountry Style Ribs\n\nThese country style ribs are so tender that they just melt in your mouth. The sauce has a little bit of sweetness, a little bit of heat, and the smoky flavor just pops and rounds out the flavor of the marinade.\n\nHeating the remaining BBQ sauce before you coat the ribs in it makes it a sticky mess that you’ll want in your life. On top of that, cooking it low and slow in the slow cooker really works magic on this cut of meat.\n\nIt’s so easy to throw together in the morning, and it’s awesome knowing you have all that deliciousness waiting for you later. Try serving it with your favorite pasta salad (like this chicken macaroni salad) or potato salad (like this loaded baked potato salad). Save the leftovers to use anywhere you would normally use pulled pork!\n\nIngredients\n\nFor the spice blend you’ll need brown sugar, chili powder, onion powder, smoked paprika, ground cumin, garlic powder, salt, pepper, and crushed red pepper flakes. You’ll also need smoky BBQ sauce, country style ribs, and onions.\n\nHow To Make Boneless Country Style Ribs In Crock Pot\n\nWe’re going to start out by making our own spice blend for these boneless ribs. Mix that with half of the BBQ sauce to make a marinade to rub all over the ribs.\n\nGrease the inside of the crock pot with spray oil, then layer the onions and the coated ribs. Cover and cook the ribs until they’re fork tender. See the recipe card below for the full written instructions, including ingredient amounts, cooking times, and helpful tips, etc.\n\nWhat Cut Of Meat Is Country Style Ribs?\n\nCountry-style ribs aren’t actually ribs! This cut of pork actually comes from the shoulder area of the pig. It’s a muscular part at the end of the loin that is fatty, which is what makes it a perfect candidate for cooking low and slow.\n\nThey’re thick and are normally about half a pound each. Another difference is that you wouldn’t normally eat them with your hands (like you would with other ribs).\n\nWhy Are They Called Country Style Ribs?\n\nThe name can be a little confusing, but they got their name because the flavor and consistency of this cut of meat is similar to standard ribs once it’s finished cooking. Depending on where you are, these can also be called Western ribs.\n\nAre Country Style Ribs Tough?\n\nThis is a cut of meat that really needs to be cooked low and slow. As long as you cook them that way, they’ll turn out tender. If you cook them quickly at a high heat, this cut of meat will be tough.\n\nDoes Cooking Ribs Longer Make Them More Tender?\n\nAssuming you’re cooking them at a low temperature, yes, the longer you cook the ribs the more tender they will be.\n\nCan You Slow Cook Ribs Too Long?\n\nIt’s technically possible, but you run very little risk of that. That’s what is so amazing about cooking these on low in the slow cooker – you can cook them for a very long time without them drying out or overcooking.\n\nOptional Adaptations\n\nI like to use a smoky barbecue sauce in this recipe because it adds a little bit of the grilled flavor, but Sweet Baby Ray’s is another popular choice. Feel free to use your favorite BBQ sauce here.\n\nSome people even like to make their own apple cider vinegar BBQ sauce for these ribs! You could also add some liquid smoke to really increase the smoky flavor, just keep in mind that it’s a potent ingredient and that it’s easy to overdo it.\n\nYou could also try cooking it with potatoes or sauerkraut, or you could go for a totally different flavor and use teriyaki sauce instead of BBQ sauce.\n\nKeep In Touch\n\nI’d love to hear what you thought of this recipe in the comments or on Instagram! @KeyToMyLime #KeyToMyLime\n\nClick here to pin this recipe for later!\n\nEasy Dinner Recipes\n\nIf you like this recipe, be sure to check out our entire dinner recipe section!
