For the dish, see Mulligan stew (food).\n\nQuick facts for kids\n\nMulligan Stew Created by Ira A. Klugerman and Joseph Pascal Starring Steven Einbender\n\nLarry Friedman\n\nMion Hahm\n\nBarry Michlin\n\nBenjamin Sands\n\nSherry Louise Wright Country of origin United States No. of seasons 1 No. of episodes 6 Production Production location(s) Michigan State University in East Lansing, Michigan; also Washington, DC Running time 30 minutes Release Original network Syndicated Original release 1972 ( ) – 1981 (1981)\n\nMulligan Stew was an American children's educational television series, produced and sponsored by the USDA Extension Service and its youth outreach program, 4-H.\n\nTaking its name from the hobo dish, Mulligan Stew aired in syndication beginning in the fall of 1972 and continued in reruns on public television into the early 80s.\n\nThe six-episode series follows the adventures of a group of five school-age musicians and their mentor, all dedicated to teaching others about good nutrition and developing healthier eating habits. The series, along with various educational materials including a companion comic book with additional adventures of the characters, was developed by the Michigan State University Cooperative Extension Service.\n\nOverview\n\nThe series centers on the humorous adventures of a group of five school-aged kids who are all members of a rock band called \"Mulligan Stew\" (also referred to as the \"Stews\" or the \"Mulligan Stew Force\").\n\nThe band members are:\n\nMulligan (Larry Friedman), the leader; occasionally plays guitar\n\nMaggie (Sherry Wright), identified by her long blond pigtailed hair; keyboards\n\nMike (Steven Einbender), an Italian; drums\n\nManny (Benjamin Sands), a Black preteen; bass\n\nMicki (Mi-On Hahm), a young Asian girl; guitar\n\n(Mulligan, Maggie and Micki all sing lead vocals on most of the band's songs while Mike and Manny usually handle backing vocals.) The group's clubhouse is a basement in a brownstone apartment, fully furnished with a kitchen, shortwave radio, home gym, laboratory, and even a small stage where they rehearse their music.\n\nTheir grownup advisor and mentor is Wilbur Dooright (Barry Michlin), a bespectacled, bumbling accountant who, in some episodes, gives the kids their assignments \"from upstairs\", assumed to be a secret governmental organization (paying homage to the spy films and TV shows of the day). Wilbur provides much of the comic relief throughout the series.\n\n\"4-4-3-2\" balanced diet message\n\nAn integral and ubiquitous part of the program's message was the \"4-4-3-2\" balanced diet program, part of the standard USDA nutrition guidelines/recommendations promoted during the 1960s and 1970s. The use of dietary supplements was strongly discouraged; it was taught that all nutritional needs, including the proper intake of vitamins, minerals, fats and carbohydrates, could be adequately obtained solely by adhering to a balanced diet, with appropriate servings from the \"basic four\" food groups. This message was enthusiastically repeated by the children several times per episode. (The \"basic four\" food groups were updated by USDA in subsequent decades by the 1990s-era \"Food Guide Pyramid\" and the current \"MyPlate\" nutritional guidelines program.)\n\nEpisode list\n\n№ Title 1 \"The Great Nutrition Turn On\" Wilbur and the Stews are given a secret assignment to travel to the town of Lazy Susan and rescue the lethargic locals, whose energy is being sapped from poor eating habits. On the way, the gang stops by a 4-H Fair and sample the exhibits. 2 \"Look Inside Yourself\" The Stews explain the basics of nutrition and digestion, as well as the importance of eating breakfast; they explain this to two lethargic and grouchy teenagers (played by two uncredited young actors) they have been assigned to help. Then-Washington Senators manager and baseball legend Ted Williams makes a cameo appearance in the pre-opening teaser; Senators star player Frank Howard makes a cameo later in the episode. 3 \"The Flim Flam Man\" The Stews shun Mulligan when he refuses to follow the direction of a macrobiotics-like fad diet promoter, who tricks the rest of the kids into trying his fad diets. A concerned Mulligan frantically seeks assistance from Wilbur, who engages the con man in a nutritional duel. Mulligan is ultimately proven correct, but not without some anguish on everyone's part. 4 \"Getting It All Together\" The Stews enlist suggestions from friends and family as they help prepare a buffet for an international 4-H conference, to spotlight the nutritional value of international foods. 5 \"Countdown 4-4-3-2\" With a rescue bag of food in tow, the Stews come to Wilbur's aid when he chooses a dark and stormy night for a camp-out. In some segments, the kids visit Johnson Space Center in Houston and interview Dr. Malcom Smith (chief nutritionist for NASA) and astronauts Jack Swigert and Joseph Kerwin. The overall theme is how innovations in food science, such as freeze-drying and aquaculture, have the possibility to meet the nutritional needs of a growing population. 6 \"The Racer That Lost His Edge\" With the help of a balanced diet, a sidelined race car driver regains his proper racing weight and returns to action — and his gout is alleviated to boot.\n\nGuest appearances\n\nSeveral celebrities or future celebrities made uncredited appearances, either as part of the main storyline or in brief segments; among these were Richard Sanders who later gained fame playing Les Nessman on WKRP in Cincinnati. Ordinary citizens were interviewed by the kids in selected segments of some episodes in a \"man on the street\" format."
