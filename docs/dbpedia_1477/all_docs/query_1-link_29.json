        "text": "1976: Just one stinking issue: Feb 8-14.\n\n1977: I have eighteen issues: Jan 30-Feb 5; Feb 13-19; Mar 6-12; Mar 27-Apr 2; May 22-28; Jun 12-18; Jul 12-18; Jul 31-Aug 6; Aug 28-Sep 3; Sep 25-Oct 1; Oct 16-22➡Oct 23-29; Nov 13-19; and then a spectacular five-issue run from post-Thanksgiving (Nov 27) to New Year's Eve. Here's a look at part of the Christmas issue.\n\n1978: Nineteen issues: Feb 5-11; Feb 19-25; Mar 12-18; Apr 9-15; May 14-20➡May 21-27➡May 28-Jun 3; Jun 11-17; Jun 18-24; Jun 25-Jul 1; Jul 30-Aug 5;➡Aug 6-12; Sep 10-16;➡Sep 17-23; Nov 5-11; Nov 19-25;➡Nov 26-Dec 2 (d);➡Dec 3-9; Dec 17-23.\n\n1979: Jan 14-20; Jan 28-Feb 3; Feb 11-17;➡Feb 18-24; Mar 18-24;➡Mar 25-31; Apr 29-May 5;➡May 6-12; May 27-Jun 2;➡Jun 3-19; Jun 10-16;➡Jun 17-23;➡Jun 24-30 (d);➡Jul 1-7; Oct 7-13; Dec 30-Jan 5, 1980.\n\n1980: Feb 24-Mar 1; Jul 13-19; Aug 10-16;➡Aug 17-23;➡Aug 24-30; Dec 21-27 (d).\n\n1981: May 24-30;➡May 31-Jun 6; Jul 26-Aug 1; Aug 23-29; Sep 13-19; Dec 20-26.\n\n1982: Jun 27-Jul 3; Dec 12-18.\n\n1983: A whopping seventeen issues: Jan 23-29;➡Jan 30-Feb 5;➡Feb 6-12, Feb 27-Mar 5;➡Mar 6-12,➡Mar 13-19, Apr 10-16; Apr 24-30; May 15-21;➡May 22-28; Jul 24-30;➡Jul 31-Aug 6; Oct 30-Nov 5;➡Nov 6-12;➡Nov 13-19; Nov 27-Dec 3; Dec 24-30.\n\n1984: Mar 25-31; May 6-12;➡May 13-19; Dec 23-29.\n\n1985: Only the Christmas issue, Dec 22-28.\n\n--TV Guides, 427 issues--a few 60's and early 70's, but mostly 1974-1983. With a handful of exceptions (mainly among the older ones), all are New York Metropolitan Editions (NYME), as noted. WANTED: More 1974-1983 NYME issues (see below).\n\n1963: I have one issue from this year, bought at a cool junk store called Palookaville (long gone) in downtown Portland OR. I bought it despite the fact that it doesn't fall into my nostalgia sweet spot of 1974-83. After buying it for a couple of bucks, I realized it was from the week of November 23-29, which was the weekend of the John F. Kennedy assassination. This means that much of the programming listed within may not have actually aired. [Portland edition; \"Burke's Law\" cover]\n\n1964: Jan. 25-31 [NYME, \"America's Long Vigil\"] This is the earliest Metro edition in my collection (although it doesn't say that in the channel listings as it does in later guides). It has a 25 page section about television's role in the drama of the JFK murder, how it was covered and what was on TV throughout the ordeal, hour-by-hour. Fascinating stuff.\n\n1967: Christmas issue, Dec 23-29, NYME. This has become the first issue in my collection to include an ad for the WPIX Yule Log, which is now a part of a post featuring anything I've got that's YL-related!\n\n1969: Feb. 8-14 [Portland OR; \"Mission: Impossible,\" Jack Davis art] / July 12-18 [Eastern New York State; \"Mod Squad\"] / July 19-25 [ENYS; Moon landing] / Aug 30-Sep 5 [ENYS; Johnny Cash]\n\nChristmas issue, Dec 20-26, NYME\n\n1970: Christmas issue, Dec 19-25, NYME\n\n1971: May 22-28 [Northern New England; David Cassidy] / Sep 4-10 [Northern New England; Jack Lord, Bob Peak art]\n\nThe rest are all New York City Metro editions, unless noted.\n\n1972: Dec 23-29 [Christmas]\n\n1973: Jul 28-Aug 3, Dec 22-28, Dec 29-Jan 4\n\n1974: Mar 9-15, Mar 23-29, Nov 23-29 [Thx], Dec 14-20, D 21-27, D 28-Jan 3\n\n[From '75 on, it's mostly easier to tell you what I don't have. If writing this all out seems obsessive, I swear it's only because I use this as my reference when checking out eBay auctions for new acquisitions. I can't remember them all!]\n\n1975: NEED Jul 19-25, Aug 2-8\n\n1976: NEED Mar 20-26, Jun 12-18, Aug 14-20, Sep 11-17\n\n1977: NEED Oct 15-21, Nov 12-18, Dec 31-Jan 6\n\n1978: NEED all of June (except 17-30), July (except 1-14 and 29-Aug 4), and August (except 5-18).

The latter issue features a short article by future director Cpl.
