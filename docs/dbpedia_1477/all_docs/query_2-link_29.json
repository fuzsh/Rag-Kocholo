        "text": "One of BC's biggest wine boosters recognized for broadcast excellence\n\nI've personally known TDM for about 20 years, but his career spans much further back than that. Terry has kindly invited BC Wine Lover on his Tasting Room Radio broadcast on a couple of occasions, and he is a consistent force behind promoting Canada's wine industry. Congratulations, TDM, on receiving the \"Broadcaster of the Year\" award. It is much deserved.\n\nHere's the release from CKUA, the station where Terry has broadcasted out for many years…\n\nCKUA's Terry David Mulligan has received the honour of Broadcaster of the Year from the British Columbia Association of Broadcasters at their annual convention held recently in Vancouver.\n\nTerry comments \"The fact that my fellow broadcasters named me Broadcaster of the Year is flat out wonderful. For 15 years I have felt that I was working in a vacuum, one guy, one mic, a vinyl guy working in a digital world. I told the audience at the event that I had no idea anyone in broadcasting was paying attention to what I was doing in radio, so I was gobsmacked that I was awarded Broadcaster of the Year by my peers. I've always been a radio guy, even when I was better known for TV and acting, and have continued to keep my hand in the radio business.\"\n\nCurrently Terry is the Creator and Host of the wine and food radio show Tasting Room Radio that in BC airs in Vancouver, the Okanagan, Salt Spring Island, and Vancouver Island; and in Alberta airs on CKUA. Terry is also the Host of Mulligan Stew which has been on the air for 15 years in Alberta; and is the Co-host and Co-producer of the television wine series, Hollywood and Vines, with Jason Priestley, currently seen on SuperChannel in Canada and in over 180 countries worldwide via Travel Channel UK. His autobiography, Mulligan's Stew, My Life…So Far was released late last year.\n\nBefore Terry's current radio and TV shows in wine and food, he had a long history in the broadcast business, working in radio, film and TV for over 40 years. It was while he was a member of the RCMP that TDM discovered rock 'n roll at local radio station CKRD in Red Deer, Alberta, in the mid 60's and then spent the next two decades as a radio DJ at such stations as CFUN (Vancouver) and CHUM (Toronto). He programmed Canada's first underground FM Station, CKLG/FM, now CFOX. Terry hosted CBC Radio's rock magazine show Great Canadian Goldrush for 8 years; a syndicated national radio show Discumentary; and CBC's first network video show Good Rockin' Tonight. He joined the MuchMusic team from 1985 to 1998 and was the segment producer/host of Citytv's MT MovieTelevision. Terry also has numerous film and television acting credits. He currently lives in Vancouver.\n\nTerry closes, \"Many thanks to Don Shafer, the BC Association of Broadcasters and my friends at CKUA, Team1410, Team1040, Astral Radio, the folks at Salt Spring Radio and of course, the guy who set the whole thing in motion, Red Robinson.\"\n\n– post by Mike"
