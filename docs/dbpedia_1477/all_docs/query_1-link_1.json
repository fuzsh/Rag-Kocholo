        "text": "Date Event January 3 Holly Hallstrom becomes the third model on the CBS game show The Price Is Right along with Janice Pennington and Dian Parkinson. This lineup would remain unchanged for the next thirteen years until Kathleen Bradley joined in 1990. January 15 Bill Murray joins the cast of NBC's Saturday Night Live, replacing Chevy Chase who left the previous year. January 30 The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries, based on The Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew book series, premieres on ABC; Parker Stevenson and Shaun Cassidy star as Frank and Joe Hardy, and Pamela Sue Martin stars as Nancy Drew. The series at first alternated between the two characters, with The Brady Bunch Hour airing sporadically. February 4 American Bandstand celebrates its 25th anniversary on television with a special hosted by Dick Clark and telecast by ABC. An \"all-star band\" made up of Chuck Berry, Seals & Crofts, Gregg Allman, Junior Walker, Johnny Rivers, the Pointer Sisters, Charlie Daniels, Doc Severinsen, Les McCann, Donald Byrd, Chuck Mangione and three members of Booker T and the MGs perform \"Roll Over Beethoven.\" February 27 Fed up with excessive violence and distorted images of sex on TV, the Reverend Donald Wildmon declares \"Turn the Television Off Week.\" He is largely ignored. March 1 The CBS game show Match Game is named the #1 rated game show on television for the fifth year in a row. March 4 Freddie Prinze makes his final appearance on the NBC sitcom Chico and the Man. Prinze had actually taped the episode in question a mere hours before he fatally shot himself on January 28, 1977. March 7 Second Chance, the forerunner to Press Your Luck, premieres on ABC. March 11 Sesame Street broadcasts its 1,000th episode. March 15 Renata Scotto and Luciano Pavarotti are seen in \"La boh√®me\" on PBS and heard in stereo on local (mostly NPR) stations in the first live \"simulcast\" from the Met. March 19 The series finale of The Mary Tyler Moore Show is broadcast on CBS. March 27 In Milwaukee, Wisconsin, ABC affiliate WITI and CBS affiliate WISN-TV swap affiliations, reversing a swap that took place in 1961.[1][2] March 30 Esther Rolle departs the CBS sitcom Good Times shortly after the conclusion of the two-part fourth-season finale, \"Love Has a Spot On Its Lung.\" due to the dismissal of John Amos (who portrayed her on-screen husband James Evans) and the stereotypical behavior of its de facto star Jimmie Walker (who portrayed her son J.J. Evans). Rolle does not return until the sixth and final season in September 1978. April 22 Cleveland's CBS station WJW-TV changes its name to WJKW-TV. June 6 Lisa Peluso makes her first appearance on the CBS soap opera Search for Tomorrow as Wendy Wilkins, a role she would play until December 1985. June 27 In San Diego, California, ABC, angered over the forced loss of their affiliation from XETV in nearby Tijuana, Mexico in 1973, moves from the station which forced the change, KCST-TV, to NBC affiliate KGTV. KCST-TV assumes KGTV's former NBC affiliation and is now KNSD, an NBC O&O. August 14 NBC affiliate WRDU-TV changes its call sign to WPTF-TV, following Durham Life's purchase of the station. August 16 Television stations nationwide interrupt regular programming following news of the death of Elvis Presley. As a result, Elvis in Concert airs on CBS on October 3 that year to bad reviews. September 5 In Baton Rouge, Louisiana, ABC affiliate WRBT (now WVLA-TV) and NBC affiliate WBRZ-TV swap affiliations. WBRZ-TV makes its move in search for stronger programming (ABC is, at the time, the nation's #1 rated television network, while NBC is in last place). The move is a precursor to similar events that will take place in the course of the next few years. September 14 A tube top-clad woman named Yolanda Bowsley is called into Contestants' Row on the CBS game show The Price Is Right, and while running down her breasts pop out of her shirt. The incident was censored with a large blue bar but it is still remembered today. Cheryl Ladd is introduced as Kris Munroe, the younger sister of former Angel Jill Munroe (Farrah Fawcett-Majors) in the second season premiere of Charlie's Angels. September 20 The third part of the three-part fifth season premiere of Happy Days airs on ABC. The episode is highlighted by a scene in which Fonzie literally jumps over a shark while on water-skis. September 21 Eleven-year old Janet Jackson joins the cast of the CBS sitcom Good Times for its final two seasons as Penny Gordon, an upstairs neighbor who is abused by her biological mother (Chip Fields), later adopted by Willona (Ja'Net DuBois), in the four-part season opener \"The Evans Get Involved\". Comedian Johnny Brown, who recurred as the building superintendent Bookman from Seasons 2 to 4, also joins the main cast. September 24 Marla Gibbs joins the cast of the CBS sitcom The Jeffersons as a series regular in the fourth season as fan-favorite Florence Johnston. Zara Cully, who portrayed Mother Jefferson, appears in only three episodes that season, prior to her death at age 86 in February 1978. October 23 CBS affiliates WTEN in Albany, New York and WCDC in Adams, Massachusetts swap affiliations with ABC affiliate WAST after WTEN/WCDC's incoming owners Knight-Ridder sign an affiliation deal for the station with ABC. October 24 A new Peanuts special, It's Your First Kiss, Charlie Brown, airs on CBS. It shows and names \"Heather\", the Little Red-Haired Girl, thereupon ending the 'mystery'. November 6 KTVZ in Bend, Oregon signs-on as an NBC affiliate. Bend is technically still part of the Portland DMA at the time, but in 1981, it becomes its own television market. November 30 CBS commentator Eric Sevareid bade farewell in his final two-minute segment on The CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite, after 48 years at CBS News. December 2 Billy Crystal sets a winner's circle record by getting the contestant to the top of the pyramid in 26 seconds on ABC's The $20,000 Pyramid. The record still stands today. December 11 In Huntsville, Alabama, NBC affiliate WAAY-TV swaps affiliations with ABC affiliate WYUR in search for stronger programming (at the time, NBC is in last place among the three major networks, and ABC is in first place)."
