        "text": "Moussaka is to the Greek what Lasagna is to Italians. A rich tomato meat sauce layered with eggplant instead of pasta sheets, and topped with a thick layer of béchamel sauce, this traditional Greek recipe takes time to assemble – but it’s well worth the effort!\n\nThis is serious comfort food – a low carb one at that!\n\nMoussaka\n\nAs with all iconic dishes of the world, I imagine that every Greek family surely has their own version of Moussaka.\n\nWell, I like to think they do. I have visions of Greek Mamas having heated debates about what makes a great moussaka, arguing over earth shattering things like:\n\nbeef or lamb?? (Traditionally lamb, equally delicious with beef!)\n\npotatoes in place of eggplant? (Totally fine, eggplant is just more traditional)\n\nblasphemy to bake rather than fry the eggplant? (Once layered up, you can’t tell if it’s baked rather than fried but your skinny jeans will thank you for it. Eggplant is a sponge for oil, my friends!)\n\nWell, Greek Mamas might not have such a pragmatic view as the answers I’ve provided, but hopefully this recipe gets their nod of approval! It’s a traditional recipe sourced from a Greek cookbook called The Food And Cooking Of Greece which I found at my local library back in 2015.\n\nSince this time, it has evolved a wee bit pursuant to other Greek cookbooks that have crossed my path, but the core of the recipe is still very much the original recipe.\n\nHow to make Moussaka\n\nThere’s 4 components to Moussaka:\n\ncooking the eggplant;\n\nthe meat sauce, a rich Bolognese type sauce made with lamb or beef but with traditional Greek flavours of oregano and cinnamon;\n\nthick béchamel sauce – thicker than used in Lasagna and things like Broccoli Gratin, it’s semi-set using eggs;\n\nlayering it all up, lasagna style.\n\nHere’s a quick look at each of these components – or if you prefer, watch the recipe video below or skip straight to the recipe!\n\nEggplant for Moussaka\n\nTraditionally, the eggplant slices are fried but there’s plenty of recipes (even from Greek cookbooks) that grill/broil, bake or BBQ the eggplant.\n\nI’ve opted to bake here (like I do with Eggplant Parmigiana), but actually, the fastest and easiest way to cook the eggplant is on the BBQ. There’s a vast volume of eggplant here and it takes 3 trays. If you’ve got a 4 burner BBQ, you’ll get these thin slices of eggplant cooked within 5 minutes (and no salting required).\n\nWhy salt the eggplant? Two reasons: to extract excess liquid (otherwise you end up with watery moussaka), and historically also to remove any potential for bitterness (high heat of BBQ will avoid the need for this). These days however the latter is not really necessary, as any bitterness has been bred out of modern eggplants.\n\nMeat Sauce for Moussaka\n\nThe meat sauce for Moussaka is traditionally made with lamb but it’s equally delicious with beef. I love the subtle hint of cinnamon and oregano in this – a nice reminder that it’s not to be confused with everybody’s favourite Bolognese!\n\nBut other than that, the cook method and ingredients in the Moussaka meat sauce is very much the same as Bolognese!\n\nOh wait – one big difference between Moussaka meat sauce and Bolognese – this is much thicker. Like with Cottage Pie and Shepherd’s Pie. It needs to be, because otherwise it just runs everywhere when you cut into it. 🙂\n\nBéchamel Sauce\n\nThis is not your everyday Béchamel sauce! Not like what we see in Lasagna and gratin dishes like this seafood pasta Gratin.\n\nIt’s made with eggs (which is not in usual Béchamel sauces) so it sets when it bakes. A necessity because Moussaka has a nice big thick layer of Béchamel Sauce, far thicker than I use in Lasagna. If it wasn’t set, it would just run everywhere!\n\nLayering Up\n\nThe step photos below are pretty self explanatory I think! It’s no different to layering up a lasagna except we use eggplant in place of pasta sheets.\n\nIt’s topped with breadcrumbs for a great crunchy topping – because everybody loves a good crunchy topping!\n\nPop it into the oven to bake away, and THIS is what comes out…\n\nI hate / love that part when you crack through the crunchy golden topping.\n\nHate it, because I just want to admire how great it looks (ok, I’m lying, I want *people* to admire it so I can bask in the glory, yes it’s totally childish but let me have that moment because do you KNOW how many pots and pans I dirtied MAKING THIS??!!!)\n\nLove it, because when you crack through that golden top and the white bechamel sauce bursts out, you scoop up a big piece and you see all the amazing layers….. the soft eggplant melding together with that rich meat sauce….\n\nIt’s a little bit of food heaven, right there.\n\nTotally worth every single pot and pan. – Nagi x\n\nPS If you’re thinking about all the washing up, double it and that’s about how much mess I created when I made this for the recipe video!!!\n\nMore tasty Greek flavours\n\nMoussaka recipe\n\nWatch how to make it\n\nOriginally published October 2015, completely overhauled in March 2019 with new photos, step photos, recipe video and most important (of course), addition of a Life of Dozer section!\n\nLife of Dozer\n\nIn recent weeks, Dozer’s been slinking back inside mere minutes after getting his daily big juicy bone. Initially, I scolded him, thinking he had buried it and that I’d have to deal with muddy paw prints through the house when he decided to dig it up for snack time.\n\nBut his furry paws were completely clean.\n\nPuzzled, I wondered what was going on.\n\nThen I saw THIS: Dozer looking anxiously up into the pine tree at a MAGPIE that had stolen his bone.\n\nThey must’ve been swooping down and stealing it from right between his paws. I think they’re working in teams and sharing the prize."
