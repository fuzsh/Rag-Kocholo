        "text": "1. FALLEN LUCIFERS\n\nIf it were not essentially so terrifying, it would be amusing to sit here, alone with the body of Ned Beaumont, in this dark house by the black, cold lake, the wind howling outside with the voice of a damned soul. I feel as if I am at rest in the hand of God, a fragment of the incomplete jigsaw puzzle that is my life.\n\nYou must believe me when I tell you that I honestly don’t know if I killed Ned Beaumont or not. I know that he lies on the floor in the den, his face contorted in rage, that rage that had become so much a part of his life when he was among the quick. I know that he has been shot. I know that I still feel deeply for him, for the remarkable partnership that he and I had for so many years. But I don’t know whether or not I shot him. But was he shot?\n\nImagining myself looking at myself, I seem to be relaxed. What exactly is it that I see? A man, large-boned, dressed casually in a seersucker suit (a bit too light for the sudden autumn weather that has startlingly blown in from Canada), a Scotch and soda in my right hand, in my left a cigarette. My glance is, I suppose, cool and almost distant. I am waiting to make up my mind to call the police. Ned Beaumont is dead. I must face up to that fact. I must face up to the possibility that it is I who killed him.\n\nIf I could remember the events of the evening! If I could logically, chronologically present them to myself, follow them up to that moment when the pistol harshly barked! And spat sullen flame! Perhaps it was suicide? Perhaps. But why would Ned Beaumont wish to end his own life, with so much to live for? Daisy loved him—no, let me correct myself—Daisy adored him. And Ned Beaumont, in his careless, flamboyant way, adored her. Now he lies, dead, in the den, his poor aching head toward the fireplace, his feet in a sickeningly tangled pile of old magazines, his face crestfallen and distorted. His shoes are cheerfully glistening in the starlight that comes in the window, reflected off the waters of the lake. Odd and ironic epiphany! If I could remember … but it is all a welter of unconnected things, little things.\n\nEarlier (it must have been earlier), we stood together, looking out the same picture window through which the reflected luminous light of dim and distant stars now eases eerily.\n\nA drink, Ned Beaumont? I said.\n\nThat would hit the old spot, he barked.\n\nWhat would you like, I mumbled. I have everything here … vodka, bourbon, gin.…\n\nScotch would be fine, he sighed. With a splash of branch.\n\nWhat is ‘branch,’ Ned Beaumont? I inquired pleasantly.\n\nBranch? Branch is a kind of swell, pure water, Ned Beaumont whined. He sat heavily in a chair, distracted.\n\nWill plain ‘tap’ water do? I asked, moving swiftly toward the little bar of which I felt strangely and inordinately proud.\n\nOf course, Ned Beaumont replied wearily. The word ‘branch’ is a sort of affectation usually used in the affected term, ‘bourbon and branch.’\n\nI don’t follow you. I was doing my very best to be genial, but cold fury was sweeping through me. Bourbon?\n\n\"That is the drink I mentioned in order to give you an example of how the word ‘branch’ is most often used. ‘Branch’ is a kind of terrific spring water, or well water, or stupendous crystalline-stream water. It actually means ‘something’ and water … I mean that I want Scotch and water, that’s all.\"\n\nI follow you now, Ned Beaumont, I chortled. What you need is a tall Scotch and water. Rocks?\n\nWhat? Come again?\n\nI say: Rocks?\n\nWhat in God’s name are you talking about? Ned Beaumont sputtered.\n\nI could feel the cold fury, that had not ceased to sweep through me, turning, to glacial ice! He was looking at me as if seeing me for the first time, always a bad sign with the great hulk I called friend.\n\nI merely wanted to know if you prefer your drink on the ‘rocks’ or not, Ned Beaumont. My eyes were filled with the unwanted—yet oddly pleasant—pain of my incredible, my overweening anger, and I felt as if I could crush his hat, then and there.\n\nWhat is ‘on the rocks,’ man? For God’s sake! He was trembling visibly, with anger, fear, or was it overweening frustration?\n\nThe rocks? The rocks? Surely, Ned Beaumont, you are joking with me. Why treat Halpin this way? The rocks, Ned Beaumont, the rocks! Think, man! Think!\n\nHe stood up and very slowly turned toward me. I noticed, with a sudden loathing, his heavy jowl, his blue-shadowed face, his rumpled shirt, sweat stains peering out from beneath his armpits like a brace of obscene jokes.\n\nMarty, he whispered. \"Am I losing my mind? Did I or did I not hear you ask me if I wanted my simple drink, my teeny Scotch and water, on the rocks?\"\n\nI laughed brusquely, a chill traveling the length of my spine. You did, Ned Beaumont, you most certainly did. That’s what I asked and that is what I still want to know! I realized that I had been standing in the exact position for what seemed minutes, hours, days perhaps. I could have sworn the clock had stopped. I had no idea how long we had been discoursing. I was sweating visibly, in one hand a tumbler, in the other a quart of Scotch whisky. Yes, Ned Beaumont. That’s my question. I await your reply. Is it … so difficult?\"\n\nNed Beaumont strode to the window with that long, masculine lope of a stride that had first brought him to the attention of Daisy Buchanan. It had been at a publication party for Cecil Tyrell’s Broken Bottles, and Daisy had watched him all evening long, her eyes riveted on his striding legs as he loped his way from group to group. Her husband, Tom, was off at the bar somewhere, as usual, neglecting her in the cavalier way that was his wont. I have lain awake for nights, for centuries, it sometimes seems, wishing that Daisy might have bent that admiring glance on my legs. Now, the possessor of those legs was at the window, looking at the wind-whipped lake stretched out before him like a dark and mysterious hand, oddly crusted with whitecaps like a kind of loathsome eczema.\n\n\"One could probably call that water ‘branch,’ Martin,\" he rasped. The words seemed to catch in the air, and hang suspended. I could almost descry them laboring toward my ear, lurching through the silence that had suddenly fallen.\n\nSo it’ll be rocks then, I laughed, gripping the quart bottle in a kind of maniacal fury, or, a wintry hatred.\n\nRocks will do, he said, his voice exhausted. He turned toward me and I saw that his face was the face of a tired old man. Martin … he began.\n\nNed Beaumont, I stated. Ned Beaumont, ‘rocks’ is an expression somewhat akin to ‘branch.’ It means ‘ice cubes.’ That’s all. It is a kind of slang term—or perhaps a jargon. I did not mean to bait you. I didn’t know.… I felt myself softening toward him, the great polar cap of my anger melting and flowing like … branch water. I crashed into plangent laughter.\n\nThat is extremely interesting. That is interesting in the highest degree. Rocks, he grinned. I can see now how that term might come to be used. It is superbly inventive, Chuck, superbly inventive! He threw his head back and laughed his Great Laugh, the Laugh that Daisy, I knew, adored. His Laugh was like Art. I could not bear to tell him that I had not invented the term. I felt that it was better, somehow, to allow him to go on believing exactly as he wished to believe. God knows, he had little enough. He seemed grateful, and almost helpless. His eyes were upon me, doglike in their gratitude. Ned Beaumont flung himself again into laughter.\n\nYou have a remarkable laugh, Ned Beaumont, I laughed. A laugh that can only be termed infectious. How come?\n\nLaughter is the gift of God, Ned Beaumont smiled. In risu veritas. He Laughed again!\n\nHow true, I remarked softly.\n\nWhat?\n\nHow true, I cried. So they say.\n\nYes. Of course. There’s no need to shout, old man, Ned Beaumont allowed.\n\nSomehow, I made his drink, and one for myself. Our talk had exhausted us and we sat before a strangely blazing fire, drinks in hand, thoughtfully smoking. I knew that the reason for our meeting was hovering in the air, like a great sinister plastic animal that was waiting its opportunity to come between us and give us cancer. Ned Beaumont’s lack of self-control, his failing memory, his unearthly Laughter—it if indeed was Laughter—all brought again to my mind the reason for this meeting. I searched my fevered brain to find a way to bring the two—she-demons—into the conversation. I knew Ned Beaumont’s feeling for them, I knew the power that they wielded over his life, I knew his absolute inability to tolerate criticism of them.\n\nSipping my drink, I suggested, offhand: Have you seen Corrie and Berthe lately, Ned Beaumont? My, what a cheery fire! I believe I can see shapes therein!\n\nA kind of sick and sullen semblance of silence descended on the room, a silence from which Ned Beaumont’s voice issued like a rogue’s curse, like the paranoiac soughing of the wind outside. But … was it really outside?\n\nI’ll not speak of them with you or with anyone else, he bit right off. Sweat stood out on his bulging forehead in great beady pearls. His hands began to shake so much that he spilled some of his drink.\n\nYou’re spilling some of your drink, Ned Beaumont, I opined. The merest mention of those two young women seems to inflict an unusual nervousness upon your person. At the moment these names are causing a small accident. I chose my words with the most delicate precision.\n\nYou’ve no right to speak of them—here! He flung his arm out to underline his last word and his drink now cascaded out of the glass, most of it landing on the wild flames in the fireplace. They spat and danced like trapped things, the shadows in the room leaping wildly. For the first time, I was afraid. Afraid of what I might have to do!\n\n\"Ned Beaumont, just why do you think I asked to meet with you tonight? We never talk together anymore, our confidence in each other is well-nigh obsolete. Face it, man. Face it!\" I was almost shrieking above his sudden Laughter, trying to ignore the fleeting images of various Old Masters it crafted.\n\n\"They are marvelous girls, marvelous!\" He loped, to the bar, to make himself another drink! \"I don’t expect you to understand,\" he mumbled.\n\nWhat, Ned?\n\nHe turned to me, his face a rigid mask of livid yet fervid rage. He despised me.\n\n\"I say, old chum, that you can’t, or won’t, understand—it’s the same thing.\" He busied himself unnecessarily with his drink.\n\nOh, I intoned. \"But you’re wrong, Ned Beaumont. You’re wrong. I’ve waited for weeks, for months, for you to tell me about them. Granted, I have not, up to this point, understood. I see—I see something in them. Their charm, their grace, their ‘powers,’ supposing that they are powers. They even have a sort of wondrously achieved elegance and style.\"\n\n\"I’m glad that you can see that,\" Ned Beaumont spat.\n\nBut why, I queried, why have those puerile ladies those large, flexible, ears?\n\nIt was as if I had struck him full force in the faded face. He blanched, he blenched, his hand shook, he came at me with a hoarse cry, like the cry of an animal in pain, his visage that of a plastic animal trapped in a lair.\n\nI cannot remember what happened after that! I cannot remember whether we fought, or argued, I cannot remember whether or not I—killed him!\n\nI sit here now, in the silence over which keens the sound of the damned wind. The stars are luminous, their light a million pure points of hope, of beauty, of promise—for someone. But not for me! Soon I shall call the police, and face their crude questions, their ceaseless and unimaginative probings for, the facts. As if the facts could possibly explain what has happened here tonight! As if the facts could possibly reveal the sinister hold that Corrie Corriendo and Berthe Delamode had on Ned Beaumont! And Daisy? How will Daisy ever believe that I honestly do not know if I murdered, here, in this desolate summer house, her adored Ned Beaumont? Beaumont the laugher, Beaumont the loper….\n\nBut there is time. Time to call the police, time to call Daisy Buchanan, time for everything. Let me take an hour or two of your time and trace the obsidian pathways of this tragedy. Let me take you back, then, to a brilliant winter afternoon no more than a year ago. A year? It seems an eternity, as remote as the impassive and extravagant stars whose light shyly shivers upon us, here, in this twisted world, of error, and heartbreak. Let me tell you the story, then, as if you were sitting here with me, comfortable in this silent house, the black wind hurling itself against the windows, the taste of good whisky in our mouths. It will be easier if you let me ramble on, and not interrupt me. The whole story will be told, I promise you. It isn’t pretty.\n\nSo. Picture then, a brilliant afternoon in January. The sky is a faultless blue.\n\n2. BEST INTENTIONS\n\nA brilliant day in January, the sort of day that I have always liked, a day when one can forget one’s minor and ephemeral troubles in the sure knowledge that Nature does not care, that Nature, in the old surge and flow of itself, moves inexorably onward. The sky was a flawless blue, a faultless blue, that blue that has about it somewhere a touch of yellow, or perhaps pristine white, a subtlety that seems mixed with the pale azure that makes it, perhaps, even paler.\n\nI was walking across town to meet Ned Beaumont for lunch in order to discuss a new manuscript that had come in the week before from B.B. Brophy, the young Anglican radical. But, of course, my mind was on the new and rather disturbing relationship that Ned Beaumont seemed to have almost, one might say, created for himself with the two young clairvoyants, Miss Corrie Corriendo and Mme Berthe Delamode. It was too early for me to place my ideas on clairvoyance, in general, as a wedge, or wedges, between Ned Beaumont and the two young women, seeing, as I surely did, that nothing that I could say, or even hope to say, on the subject, at least at the present time, could be of the least value, seeing as how my conception of such a discipline, or gift, was that of the amateur, or even the dilettante, but I thought that I might allow my vague uneasiness on the relationship, to rise to the surface, of the chummy rapport, that we had, so that my colleague and dear friend, might glimpse it, and perhaps look at the liaison he was involved in, with a more objective, and, perhaps, even a suspicious, eye. At the time I didn’t know how far the little drama had gone! The blue sky, flawless as it was, seemed uppermost in my mind—its almost virginal clarity banished the dark thoughts from my wearily weighted head!\n\nHow curious that I should have thought of the blue sky as virginal in its clarity! It almost seemed, so I flattered myself, a brilliant idea. How I hummed! In tradition and, of course, in Art, blue is the color of the mantle worn by the Virgin Mary, in which case it symbolizes modesty. Modesty, of course, is not necessarily virginal, but the two have much in common, I mused! How then, can blue also be the color of heartbreak, of sadness, of the blues, of a sort of grinding despair? Curiously, I recalled that Eusebius, Plato, Mnemosyne, and Maximus the Younger, as well as lesser thinkers of the Athenian Middle Period have told us that blue is the color of the clothing of the gods, especially of Juno (Queen of the Heavens), sometimes called Hera, or Here. The blue worn by these pagan gods was, however, not of the same saturation as that of the Virgin’s mantle, the latter’s cloak being more what we might now term a royal blue; whereas the former wore garments that were not far removed from ultramarine. Of necessity, no doubt! For those ancient Hellenic deities to term their clothing a royal blue would have smacked of hubris, that mortal sin of the ancient, dark religions. How dark, indeed? I laughed, bitterly.\n\nYet certainly, since light blue—sky-blue—in Christian art, was a symbol of divine eternity and human mortality, so was it paralleled in Hellenic religions in like terms; and thus, came to be a mortuary color. How could I have forgotten that the coffins of the young were once covered with blue cloth, and the mortuary cloth was also of this color? Yet I had forgotten! Was, then, the very sky itself a kind of covering over all of us children of the gods? And what of the fact that brides in Eastern Rumania wore blue garters on their wedding day? Certainly the commentary of Sir Vyvyan Brier on such folk practices seems to indicate that the blue at once symbolized the sexual life and the orgastic death consummated by the youthful couple. In a paper published as an addendum to this work, which latter, I recalled, was always known as Brier’s Folk-Wedding Studies, but which has the formal title: Magic and Ritual in Folk-Weddings in the Jijia River Valley, Sir Vyvyan notes that the practice has been discontinued because of what he delicately notes are political considerations, as well as the introduction of garter belts. Indeed, I snorted.\n\nGlancing again at the canopy of heaven, I remembered that the ancient emblem of heaven, a canopy, was termed the baldachin, and it was blue beneath; and church ceilings—from the Latin caelum or heaven—were generally painted blue (except in the churches of the heresiarch, Fr. Gonsalvo Poniatowski—the Orange Priest) and powdered with gold stars just cute as pie. With a sudden slashing nostalgia I recalled the church of my youth, Our Lady of the Bleeding Eyes, and its blue ceiling, bespattered with those same gold stars. It was meet that it was so, meet also that one received gold stars on blue cards for excellence in primary religious studies.\n\nOf course, blue likewise signifies piety, sincerity, and contemplation! It seemed sad to me that church vestments are no longer of this redoubtable color, almost as if something has gone out of the Holy Church, as indeed, something has. What could it be? I wondered aloud. Scallope-Seviche, in a book that we ourselves published some years ago, Midnight Sunburst, tells the story of coming across, in the remoter reaches of Ireland, an ancient priest about to celebrate mass in an electric-blue chasuble. When Scallope-Seviche asked the old man the nature of the mass which he was about to celebrate, the latter replied, with not a little dignity, Electric blue is your only man! Ah, the Irish have grand hearts, I muttered as I sauntered, a speck in the sunny world covered with the blue baldachin of God.\n\nIs it for nothing that high priests (or rabbis) of the Jewish faith wore blue about their garments as significant of divine contemplation? You’ve got to hand it to them! They know how to worship God, I thought. It takes years to realize that one never finds a Jewish person in a poolroom! What would the high priests, their magical blue all about them, say about such a thing? Terrible even to contemplate. Jewish angels’ garments are always blue, symbolic of faith and fidelity, the very flag of Israel is blue and white, Christ knows why.\n\nMy spirits were lifting, the flawless blueness of the sky had borne me across town effortlessly, and I felt that my meeting with Ned Beaumont would be productive, more than productive, perhaps. The very color of the sky had infused into my soul and made it shimmer with fidelity to my own ideas on my partner’s trouble as well as with faith in his ability to make the right decision as soon as I had pointed out to him his waywardness. I was delighted to discover that I had worn a blue tie to this luncheon meeting. It seemed to me to be a sign from Juno herself, and I suddenly thought that blue, worn at the celebration of certain things, is significant of humanity and expiation, as well as of unbridled lust. Fitting, I thought, fitting to be sure. The young women in question were—redolent—of that latter state. There, I knew, was the problem with Ned Beaumont and his uncritical adoration of their magic. But I felt that my cravat, or tie, a heraldic blue, if it was anything, and thereby a kind of blazon of chastity, loyalty, fidelity, and good reputation, would enable me to carry the day against these two with my dear and old friend.\n\nI spied Ned Beaumont at the corner, waiting impatiently for me. As I came up to him and shouted a greeting, he turned, looking at me as if seeing me for the first time. Martin? I extended my hand, and saw that his bewildered gaze had wandered away from my face and that his eyes were carefully picking their way down my person, cutting back and forth in the vicinity of my shirtfront. Of course it’s Martin. You were expecting maybe a miracle? I laughed gruffly, reaching back for an old joke we both were inordinately fond of.\n\nOf course, it was my tie that he was examining ever so minutely. How fantastic that you’re wearing a blue tie! he cried. It’s a dead giveaway! A dead giveaway! He was slapping his thighs convulsively. What is it, Ned Beaumont? I queried, smiling in a kind of oneiric bewilderment, a habit that I have acquired when I wish to disguise the fact that I am nonplused. For a moment I hated him. Baby, I was just reading Brophy’s manuscript and he says that blue—and he pointed at my tie—is the Mongolian color of authority and power. Authority and power! He suddenly looked soberly at me, his arms and hands ceased their spastically facetious movements. Are you going to pull some ‘rank’ on me? About, maybe, Corrie and Berthe?\n\nI looked at him, amazed, trying to disguise my perplexed frown with a smile. The sky had somehow ironically tricked me that morning. The luncheon meeting was disastrous. It was soon after that our friendship began to crack apart. I’ll try and tell you about it as calmly and coolly as I can. The wind is getting stronger now. My eyes are riveted on the lake, all a-spume … with chancre-like stuff!\n\nLet me place you in the restaurant with us, at the same table. Let me try and show you the beginning ugliness that would end with ugly death. How curious that it should begin on a day of dazzlingly flawless blue.\n\nLamont’s Scrapbook\n\nARE YOU EMBARRASSED AND SILENT when others speak of books, politics, theatre, the cinema, philosophy, and all the other subjects that cultivated men and women delight in discussing?

When old Dixie shakes, when those good ol’ boys stop walking down those hot red clay roads, or when lovers make no rendezvous ’neath the magnolias. Certainly, it is false to speak of honeysuckle, tobacco, grits, slaves, Confederates of stone far gazing, deserted rocking chairs on shady verandas in the heavy heat of August afternoons, and whatever other items from Dear Old Southland that come to mind. The argument seems to be that nothing whatever known to Yankee man is true of Dixie.

(Connie) Ryan, late of Morristown, New Jersey, who dreamt drunkenly away the long and placid summer afternoons over many a tall and frosty Tom Collins in the cool, dim taproom of the Hi-Top. Blest be his lost and gentle youth.\n\nMy dear Roche:\n\nThanks for your long and careful letter on Rayon Violet. You raise a number of interesting points, which I’ll try to answer and/or comment on as best I can. It’s been a long time since I’ve read the book, so I’ll do my best to check the passages you mention. Sometimes it seems to me as if someone else wrote the book. I suppose that is an occupational hazard!\n\n1. Elena Esposito actually does disappear in the middle of the narrative. The girl who narrates the last half of the book seems to be Elena, but she is not. There are many clues scattered about in order that the reader may discover this fact—color of hair, penchant for low-heeled shoes, dislike of mussels, etc.—but they are subtle, and, I suppose, many people missed them. The subliminal horror of the second half of the book lies in the fact that its Elena thinks she is the true Elena. That we never know just who she really is deepens, or so I hoped, the sexual mystery with which the book grapples.\n\n2. Paul Shanahan is a cardboard figure, I agree. But his formal place in the narrative, given its loose and interwoven structure, is to act as a foil: am I being overly defensive when I say that I meant him to be one-dimensional?\n\n3. The overriding symbol of Violet is plastic. God knows, I am not a didactic writer, and have no ax to grind in this novel, nor in any of my other novels. I am interested in what I shall, perhaps arrogantly, call aesthetic joy. Topical rubbish, or what some call a Novel of Idea, leaves me cold. Yet plastic, in this novel, seemed the perfect control for such a sterile and lost group of people. But it is a literary concept, not a social or political one.\n\n4. You are right that Indianapolis and New York are interchangeable in this novel, and that the names of streets, parks, restaurants, etc., are identical: I thought to use this technique to get across my feeling that our world has become featureless. It works, if you want it to work. I agree that it is, perhaps, cute.\n\n5. I think you have missed the point of Shanahan’s long soliloquy in Chapter 12. When he ends it by quoting the famous lines from Trumbull Stickney, he is suggesting a beginning, not an end, to his campaign to seduce Blanche Schwarzmann. The soliloquy is a verbalization of his rampaging desires, although I grant you that he is doing his best in it to convince himself that he has mastered his lust.\n\n6. You remark that it would be \"interesting to know where you got the title of the novel, Rayon Violet, since it seems to have little or nothing to do with anything at all … It is from a poem of Pierre Dusort’s, L’Orgie du Coeur. The line in question runs, Rayon Violet, rayon violet! Armee étrange!\" I admit that a reader should know Dusort’s poem in order to discover the aptness of the title. But I think that a writer can occasionally be obscure.\n\n7. Shamefully, shamefully, I agree that Levenspiel is a wholly unrealized character, and that the Yiddish patois that I have put into his mouth is inexact burlesque. I must also confess that the only reason that I put this character into the novel was because of a mad desire I had to cash in (God, what a vulgar phrase!) on the Jewish novel that, at the time, was all the rage. It stands as the only time in my career that I succumbed to the urge for quick money. Shalom! my dear Roche, shalom!\n\n8. Finally, let me defend myself against your charge that the formal structure of the novel is overly complex and self-defeating. The concept of the flashback within the flashback, this entity presented as something occurring in the future, is, I maintain, the only way in which I could disorient the time factor in the book, so as to match the progressive disorientation of the characters. I admit that the use of the future and past tense, occurring in some sections on the same page, often within the same paragraph or even sentence, is difficult to follow, but I accepted this dilemma and did my best with it. The work that was put into this little novel was tremendous, and I feel that its treatment at the hands of critics was ill-deserved. I grant you that it is a difficult book, one that demands the closest attention. I also think of it as a comic novel. But let that be. Nobody has seen the humor in the book, and I certainly do not want to bore you by pointing out what to me are hilarious passages. But then, how many people can discover the endless slapstick in The Possessed? It is all a way of looking at things.\n\nAll right. Enough. As I come to the end of this too-long letter, outside my studio window I see the moon, a white clipper, plunging through seas of streaming cloud. How I wish I could be aboard!\n\nMy new book is proving difficult, if not quite intractable.\n\nWith my best wishes,\n\nAntony Lamont\n\nFrom Rayon Violet; pp. 44-45.\n\nThe rain pelted down on Levenspiel, running down the inside of his collar, chilling him to the bone. Have mercy, have mercy, God, he thought. I have my life to realize already. I shouldn’t have a little pleasure out of this rotten world? My mother with the paranoia, knocking her head against the wall—I should pay the doctors for another twenty years for her? God forbid that she should pass away, but am I made of money? My wife with the fur coats, the new dresses, the tight pants so you should see her whole body, I need this? My little girl who is not so little she hasn’t got the baby pills and the lousy boy friend from Coney Island Avenue who has no respect for his own father, he should have respect for me? Better I should have stayed a presser than have these heartaches already. So who needs them, God? I sit with my wife at night, she looks at me, I look at her, this is living? Once in a while, you shouldn’t think I’m a sex maniac or something, but once in a while I think maybe we might have a little fun. Am I in my grave yet? I can’t do anything with her, not to mention a shtup. Am I asking to be the President? Once a month is all I ask, she looks at me like I’m crazy. Have I got a cancer she looks at me like this? My father, the bastard, God forgive me, but I’m glad he’s dead, he put a complex on me when I was a kid. Is money everything? Better I should be happy than live like a sick prince. You I offer prayers. You don’t seem to hear me. You I offer money through the temple, with the smart rabbi. No results. What kind of a rabbi is this anyway, smart guy he is, reading the Communist magazines, his name I see against the war whenever I pick up a paper. This is a rabbi? God forgive me but he can’t speak Hebrew. He sounds like a goyische, if you aren’t afraid of facing the truth. Nu? I ask him about my daughter, maybe he could break his heart and have a word with her about her carrying on—she needs a social disease at seventeen? Children expect a great deal of freedom nowadays, the great rabbi says. It’s the atom bomb, he says. It’s the war, he says. I should believe that the Communists and the Congos or whatever are forcing my daughter to let this rat bastard she sees, with no respect for his father, take her underpants that I pay for off? Please don’t make me laugh. I’m dying from the laughing already. The schwartze maid who comes in I ask maybe she could clean the den a little more, like maybe she could empty an ashtray? Would it break her arm? Would it kill her? Who is paying her forty dollars a week for nothing? The NACP maybe? Maybe it’s Malcolm X or Luther Martin who picks her up at the bus stop twice a week, no questions asked? I ask her to maybe wipe a little dust off an end table, she looks at me like I’m Hitler. Am I made of stone? Give me credit for a little sensitive feeling. My wife says I should have more feeling for the Porto Rickans who push the dress racks, do you hear me? More respect already! Is a dollar ten cents an hour nothing for this work? Forgive me that I call it work please. One rack of dresses to go three blocks, the deadbeats are gone two hours. Am I a moron or an idiot that I don’t know they’re drinking wine and talking over how maybe they can stick a knife in me one day? Do I need this misery? Do you think I’m surprised my partner dropped dead two years ago? Believe me, he’s a lucky man. With the worries over how you can show a profit and still be a human being it’s a wonder all of us don’t drop dead. With my wife playing mah-jongg and rummy which she loses all my money at every January in Miami, I should give the help maybe five dollars an hour? Also a bonus for not getting drunk before lunch? It’s enough for me my daughter calls me a fascist reactionary, now my wife tells me I’m an exploiter. It was maybe the schwartzes and the spicks that Hitler put in the ovens? When they were turning us all into soap where were the schwartzes and spicks then? Pardon me, I couldn’t hear a word from them.\n\nHalpin’s Journal\n\nHow to get away? That must stand as the overwhelmingly important question in my life as of this moment. It is quite impossible for me to go through this charade for too much longer. Were there a God I would beg Him to tell me why he allowed this scribbler, this unbearably pretentious hack, Antony Lamont, to place me in this ridiculous position. The things that I have been forced to say! The utter silliness of the story so far. What have I done to be plucked out of the wry, the amused footnote in which I have resided, faceless, for all these years in the work of that gentlemanly Irishman, Mr. Joyce? An old gardener, so I have been for these thirty-odd years, an old gardener who has never gardened, never even seen, so far as I can remember, a garden—and happy not to have seen one, by God! What a delight to reside in that quietly monumental world all this time, a small part of it, content behind the letters that form my name. In a way, I was the letters, no more. Now I find myself in a cold vacation cabin of some sort, perhaps I am even a murderer, if this hack chooses to make me one. There has to be a way to free myself, and if not that, at least to discover what sort of landscape this Lamont has made for himself in other books, if he’s written any.\n\nThe crowning humiliation was that absurd dialogue Beaumont and I were forced to carry on about branch water and rocks. Afterward, Beaumont sat at the table and hid his face in his hands, ashamed to look at me! I tried to tell him that it might possibly get better, after all, we didn’t really know anything about this Lamont, it could have been worse, etc., etc. Hollow optimism, I admit, but it was difficult to watch him in his pain. He mentioned something about better days that he had had years ago, when he lived in a more reasonable world. I took a lot of punishment there, he said, \"but it all came out beautifully. Here, good Jesus! Here, I’m dead before I start!\" I looked out the window at the lake, cold and forbidding. It hadn’t changed a bit.\n\nI can hide this journal under the rug. It wouldn’t do to have Lamont suspect it, and I’d prefer it if Beaumont didn’t see it. I have the nagging suspicion that Beaumont, being dead, will slip away from here one night, or one weekend when Lamont is out of his study, and never be heard from again. He hints that he has a place to go, if he can get there. I don’t believe him. It’s I who will have the trouble, of course, telling the story as I am constrained to do. And Lamont may well be one of those writers who is always looking over what he has written, in which case, it will be impossible to find a moment in which to leave. That thought fills me with nausea.\n\nI can’t understand how Mr. Joyce allowed him to take me away! Surely, it can’t have been for money! Or does Mr. Joyce even know that I have gone? Maybe he’s dead. I have no idea of what arrangements have been made, I certainly ought to be given a decent salary, telling, as I am, the whole story. But what possessed this man to make me out such a fool? I would have been delighted to play a small role, even an anonymous role, somewhere in this vulgar work. Some superintendent who lives in a basement apartment, or even the caretaker of this lodge. The smiling roomer down the hall. He could have put me in a rowboat far out on the lake, a man seen from the window. I could troll. If I must be the star why can’t I speak intelligent lines? I’m not a robot, I’m not immune to ill treatment. Mr. Joyce, knowing that I could do nothing at all, merely stated, stated, mind you, that I performed odd jobs. That is what one may term nicety of expression. Nowhere was I made to perform, actually perform these odd jobs for Brophy—who, of course, this shameless man has also taken over and made into some sort of radical author. Perhaps Lamont somehow purchased the entire footnote, or even whole sections of that quiet world in which nothing ever happened—at least in my small area of it. I don’t know, I just don’t know.\n\n(I am writing this following part of my journal late at night. I want to record a brief conversation with Beaumont that I had just after finishing the sentence preceding this parenthesis.)\n\nBeaumont entered. He saw that I was writing in this notebook and was curious.\n\nWhat are you writing?\n\nA letter to—my sister.\n\nOh. I’ve never had a sister. Do you think Lamont will give me one? I’m afraid I wouldn’t know how to act.\n\nGod knows. I casually closed the notebook.\n\nLook, Halpin. Did you ever hear of Dashiell Hammett? I mean, over in that ‘dream world’ you said you come from? (His voice was weighted with irony.)\n\nI’m afraid not, Ned. A character?\n\nNo, not a character, an author, like Lamont, only.… He shrugged.\n\nI’ve led a quiet life, Ned.\n\n\"So you have, so you have. Well, I worked for Hammett. I was a very big star for him. An actor—a Hollywood actor—even impersonated me in a movie they made from a book I worked in.\"\n\n\"This junk must really be hard for you, Ned. I’m sorry.\"\n\nIt’s all right. What I mean is, I’m not used to this ‘absurd’ dialogue, what do they call this crap, experimental? And I’m not used to being dead and alive only in flashbacks. I don’t know if I can do it for too much longer. I dread to think what that man will put me through when we get into that restaurant he left us at.\n\nSo do I. I’ve never even eaten anything, I don’t know if I’ll even like eating.\n\nIt’s fine. I’ve eaten, myself. God only knows, of course, what he’ll make us order.\n\nDo you think it will be tomorrow?\n\nI don’t know his work habits. But I tell you, if it’s not, let’s go down to the lake and take a swim, O.K.?\n\nIt’s too cold for swimming, Ned. And it’s pitch dark—except for those damn stars. (We did not yet know that it was only from inside the house that the lake was dark.)\n\nOf course it is. He groaned. Of course it is.\n\nThere was a silence. I knew that Beaumont was trying to say that it was easier for me to be here than it was for him—after all, I had never been a major character. I suspected that he wanted to suggest that I might try embarking on a digression long enough to allow him to escape. I suppose I would do it if I could, but if there is one thing I learned while working for Mr. Joyce, it is that one cannot escape for long from a writer, unless he decides to completely rewrite a whole section. When that occurs, there is a moment, just a moment, when one may assert oneself. Occasionally, the writer will allow this assertion to stand, and one’s character is thereby subtly changed. In fact, sometimes the whole world in which one is employed is changed. But Lamont struck me as being ruthless, as well as stupid.\n\nNed, I know how hard it is for you, I really do. But let’s get some sleep now. I have a feeling we’ll need it for that restaurant tomorrow. And, Ned, if it turns out I’ve really murdered you—no hard feelings?\n\n\"Of course not, Martin. Do you think I’ll hold it against you? Hammett had me beaten to a pulp but I knew he had to do it.\" That was the gist of the conversation. I’m going to hide this notebook now and get some sleep. Ned is snoring on the couch in the study. God, I can’t bear this place! Why couldn’t he have given us a bright, sunny day to work in?\n\nMy dear Sheila,\n\nHow delighted I am that you and Dermot have decided to get married! And to live in San Francisco! That has always been one of my very favorite cities, somehow a really cosmopolitan metropolis that has escaped the dehumanizing process that most other cities seem to become involved in. It has always reminded me of a collection of the most elegant cupcakes. I heard from someone the other day that Dermot is hard at work on a new book, some sort of Western that takes place in, of all places, Ireland! Can this be the fact? I don’t know how he’s going to swing it, because Westerns have become almost passé, and he’ll have to spice it up with plenty of smut in order for a publisher to even consider doing it. Shouldn’t be too hard for him.\n\nThe one thing that troubles me about your coming marriage is what I take to be the great gulf between Dermot’s literary tastes and your own … not that I am criticizing your choice. Please don’t think that for an instant. There have been many artistic marriages that, on the face of them, looked utterly hopeless, and yet which worked out beautifully for both parties. (My own disastrous marriage is not to be viewed as a paradigm.) But Dermot, as you well know, has for years set his sights on commercial success and his writing has suffered terribly because of it. I sometimes wonder if he will ever again achieve the startling freshness he showed in those early stories of his, Moonface the Murderer and I Divorce Thee Husband. I know that you know that a writer must keep his pen, as it were, well honed. On top of this is your own penchant for critical writing, which becomes more and more trenchant and cogent as time goes on. It would seem to me that there might well be some sort of friction between you because of his ideas and yours. Let us hope not, and, in the meantime, let us keep hoping for Dermot’s return to letters.\n\nHow wonderful that you are doing a book on Nabokov! There has been so little written of this wonderful writer that a really first-rate job on his work is sorely needed. It is one thing for an Antony Lamont to be neglected—granted, my work is not for everyone—but it is incomprehensible to me how an author as good as N goes virtually unnoticed. I have spoken to Chattaway about your project and he appears interested, whatever that means. In any event, I’ll keep mentioning you to him and when you have a decent chunk of the book written I’ll be pleased to show it to him for you. He’s not a bad sort, although in recent months he has shown a disturbing proclivity for publishing what he calls meaningful books. I would guess that he means things like Right On … Rip Off! by Ishmael Melanzana and Nazism and The Nuclear Family by Henri Kink. These are all right as far as they go, but it would seem to me that there will always be room for fiction and the study of fiction.\n\nSpeaking of fiction, my own new book, Guinea Red, is giving me more trouble than I bargained for. I am trying to write an absurdist mystery story—if you can conceive of such a thing. My narrator is a man who has lost touch with his life; so much so that he doesn’t know whether or not he is a murderer. The trouble lies in giving him a true fictional shape through his voice—and his voice, of course, must give the reader hints of madness and alienation. There are scenes written and projected in which the dialogue is nightmarish and totally ludicrous. If you know the nouvelle roman you will get an idea of what I am trying to do … only I have my figures in an American setting. The strange thing is that Halpin (my narrator) seems to be bursting with the desire to say and do things that I don’t want him to say and do. This has always been, of course, a novelist’s problem, but in this book it seems more of a problem than ever. The feeling is extraordinary—almost as if Halpin has a life of his own, one that he lives when I am not looking, as it were. He strains against me. I’ve got two chapters done so far, and am preparing to write a third. I don’t know whether I like them or not, but there’s no turning back now. The book will be written. In that room, facing that blank sheet of paper—well, it’s the loneliest place in the world. As if you didn’t know!\n\nAsk Dermot to write me. We used to be good friends back in the days when, to take small liberties with Milton, Fame was the spur that the clear spirit did raise. Ah God, we had good times. What Great Artists we were going to be! Well, we do what we can, as we can.\n\nTake care of yourself, and I’ll see you in the funny papers.\n\nLove, from your brother,\n\nTony\n\nHalpin’s Journal\n\nThere’s a great deal to set down today! Many things have happened since I last wrote, and I’ll try to record them all, carefully and in, I hope, order.\n\nThe first thing to note is that Lamont has not employed us in some time, I would say at least ten days, perhaps even more. This is a great pleasure, in one sense, because Ned and I have dreaded the restaurant scene, dreaded the ridiculous dialogue that Lamont will surely put in our mouths. He’s probably working up his fiendish notes. (By the way, it is an enormous pleasure to me to be able to say, simply, Ned, instead of Ned Beaumont, as I am constrained to say when we are working. Where Lamont ever got the idea for that particular affectation is a puzzle, but it seems to be a part of the fabric of his book, and I certainly can’t protest.) On the other hand, it’s much more comforting to be working for a writer who employs one every day, with, say, Sundays off. One knows where one stands. In any event, this long layoff has allowed me and Ned much time to find out about our predicament.\n\nThe most amazing discovery is that it is always nighttime only inside the house; that is, when one ventures outside, it is day. It is only in here that Lamont has managed to arrest time. Ned says however, that that is only because Lamont is not looking right now. He can do what he wants outside when he wants. We are slaves! The night is, somehow, artificial. And so is the day. Ned says that he once spoke to a man, an Irish news-paperman, one whose name he somehow didn’t manage to find out, who told him that a neglected genius, one DaSalvi, maintained that night is simply an insanitary condition of the atmosphere due to accretions of black air. If this is so (and it certainly seems reasonable), it would seem that Lamont can manage to set these accretions—but only in one place, that is, directly before the windows of the house. When he wants. It is an odd thing to come in from a rosy-pink morning, go directly to the window, and gaze out at a chilly, choppy, pitch-black lake! We were both quite taken aback at first, but have now reconciled ourselves to the fact that we are, while in the house at least, virtual prisoners. But as soon as we can we’ll do a little exploring down the road.\n\nNed and I have been speculating as to the owner of this house. It is a rather odd house, to say the least. There is the living room and the den, but we have not been able to find any other rooms. It seems as if there are other rooms, but when we approach them, they are—I don’t quite know how to put this—they are simply not there! There is no kitchen, no porch, no bedrooms, no bath. At the side of the living room, a staircase leads nowhere. Oh, I don’t mean to say that it disappears into empty space, it simply leads to a kind of … haziness, in which one knows there is supposed to be a hallway and bedroom doors: but there is absolutely nothing. Neither Ned nor I dare to say what is uppermost in our minds, that is, that if we walked into this haziness, we would walk somehow into another dimension. (Ned thinks—wishful thinking!—that we might walk into another book!) For us, this house is the living room and the den. It certainly seems to belong to someone, but it certainly isn’t mine, and Ned laughed when I tentatively suggested that it might be his. The only clue to who might own it lies in the old periodicals, papers, and books that are in the den. But they are so diverse that one cannot imagine them being the property of any one person, unless he is a renaissance man. Ned and I spent the better part of a morning (or part of a night, considering that we were inside the house) going through this stuff, and, after weeding out different issues of the same periodical, etc., we came up with an inventory, of sorts, that I think it valuable to set down here. I make no claim to completeness, since there may well be other materials in those rooms that do not exist. The list is as follows:\n\nBOOKS: The Orange Dress by Sheila Henry; Daredevil by John Charleville; Stolen Fruit by Jymes"
