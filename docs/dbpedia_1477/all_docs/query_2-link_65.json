        "text": "According to Wikipedia, Mulligan Stew was\n\n. . .an American children’s educational television series, produced and sponsored by the USDA Extension Service and its youth outreach program, 4-H. . . . The six-episode series follows the adventures of a group of five school-age musicians and their mentor, all dedicated to teaching others about good nutrition and developing healthier eating habits. “\n\nEpisode 3, “The Film Flam Man,” follows the children as they encounter someone selling a fad diet.\n\nThe Stews shun Mulligan when he refuses to follow the direction of a macrobiotics-like fad diet promoter, who tricks the rest of the kids into trying his fad diets. A concerned Mulligan frantically seeks assistance from Wilbur, who engages the con man in a nutritional duel. Mulligan is ultimately proven correct, but not without some anguish on everyone’s part.\n\nThe US National Archives YouTube channel recently uploaded the full episode in all its glory."
