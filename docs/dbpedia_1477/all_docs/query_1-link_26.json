        "text": "Introduction\n\nMost of the history sections appearing on the National 4-H History Preservation website as researched and written by the National 4-H History Preservation team, tell a narrative story. The 4-H Promotion history is different. This is a compendium of selected short stories which stand alone. Many are stories of significant 4-H promotion or visibility programs. Others are examples that relay an impactful or heart-warming story covered in the media and a part of 4-H promotion simply because they should not be \"lost to history.\"\n\nAs Franklin Reck infers in \"The 4-H Story,\" a characteristic of almost any history is that the informative years are more exciting than later years as the early years produce the experimenters, the valiant pioneers with the new concepts. A story on the first tomato canning bee makes a better story than 100 canning competitions taking place in later years.\n\nReviewing 4-H promotion at the national level over the past century, there are two major statements that can be made; almost contradicting one another. First, traditionally promotion dollars never seemed to be a high priority item... \"you did what you could\" with the money that was allocated. However, having said this, through staff creativity, prioritizing, partnering, and doing some major projects \"on the cheap,\" some tremendously effective promotional programs were planned and successfully carried out.\n\nThis history highlights 4-H promotion at the national level, particularly by National 4-H Council and its two predecessor organizations – National 4-H Service Committee (formerly National Committee on Boys and Girls Club Work) and National 4-H Club Foundation, and by the 4-H and Information offices of Extension/USDA. Some specific examples of efforts at the state and local levels are included, particularly when they resulted in national impact or national visibility.\n\nIt is interesting to note that prior to the National 4-H Service Committee's and National 4-H Foundation's merger in 1976 creating National 4-H Council, promotion and visibility was one of the few areas of commonality in which both predecessor organizations had a strong commitment. Information staffs of both organizations often planned, coordinated and carried out promotional projects together.\n\nFrom an historic perspective, one clarification needs to be made here. Over the first nearly seven decades, starting around 1920 or slightly before, and running up into the 1980s, most efforts in this whole general area were considered 4-H promotion, visibility, or public relations. It really wasn't seen in terms of \"marketing\" until the 1980s, and in some cases, perhaps even later. And, terms like branding, licensing, tutorials, webinars, powerpoints, Twitter, Facebook, and a whole communication's technological vocabulary that has entered the scene since the mid-90s is totally recognized, but whose history is still taking shape. Interestingly, the Institute of Scientific and Technical Communications defines technical communication as \"factual communication, usually about products and services... The overarching goal is to create easily accessible, clearly communicated information for a specific audience.\" This has probably always been the goal of 4-H communicators from the very beginning, so in reality, the goals, the messages or stories have not changed... only the tools, and perhaps the vocabulary.\n\nExtension 4-H staffs at the state and county levels... and state Extension information staffs, considered 4-H visibility and public relations as part of their job and responsibility. Many had regular radio and television programs, newspaper columns, newsletters, and promoted 4-H in a variety of creative ways. While this history on the National 4-H History Preservation website primarily covers 4-H promotion at the national level, these state and local efforts were equally important. The staffs at all three levels readily assisting each other with new promotion projects or ideas.\n\nAnd, one final introductory comment – these success stories show a broad array of ideas relating to promotion and visibility over the many decades. But with its size, with its tremendous structure from national to state to local... and back up again, undoubtedly much more could have been done... should have been done, to make 4-H even more visible to all of the audiences 4-H desires to reach. Historically, at times, 4-H probably hampered creativity by its own system... publicity, promotion and visibility may not have always been within it's comfort zone.\n\nNational 4-H Week\n\nWhat is now known as National 4-H Week began as an outgrowth of World War II. Following Pearl Harbor, it was decided to postpone holding the National 4-H Camp in Washington, D.C., until the cessation of hostilities. During the war years, the Federal Extension Service initiated National 4-H Mobilization Week which was observed annually in the spring during 1942, 1943, and 1944 as a means of focusing the attention of 4-H members on what they might do for national defense.\n\nThe following year, 1945, and each year since, the special week has been observed as National 4-H Week. After the war, when National 4-H Mobilization Week became National 4-H Week, the purpose of the special week centered on (1) acquainting the public with the new, enlarged 4-H program, and the many ways young people may take part, (2) encourage more youth to join 4-H, (3) urge more men and women to volunteer as 4-H leaders, (4) recognize parents' contribution to 4-H and strengthen their cooperation, and (5) report the year's 4-H accomplishments and plan for the year ahead.\n\nResults of this first National 4-H Week in 1945 indicated it had been a very effective means on the part of leaders and members alike, of reviewing the year's work, setting goals for the ensuing year, and focusing the attention of the public on 4-H and its values in the development of young people and to the general community and national welfare.\n\nIn the early years, like National 4-H Mobilization Week, National 4-H Week was held in the spring. Beginning in 1968, National 4-H Week was moved to the first full week of October, beginning with the first Sunday of October.\n\nWhile plans for celebrating the annual National 4-H Week went into place at every level – national, state, county and local – the staffs at the national level put a great deal of time and thought into the observance. Information staffs of the National 4-H Service Committee, National 4-H Foundation and Extension Service, USDA traditionally joined forced in carrying out these plans. There was an annual National 4-H Week theme, National 4-H posters, radio and television public service announcements, 4-H Report to the Nation team visits and an annual National 4-H Week promotion kit. These kits were distributed to state 4-H staffs, extension editors and to every county extension office nationwide. The kits usually contained a wide assortment of promotional items including media related materials, a letter from the President of the United States, national 4-H statistics, clip art, exhibit plans and usually an \"idea exchange\" of how to gain more publicity for your local 4-H program.\n\nIn recent years, National 4-H Council has offered an electronic Promotional Toolkit relating to promotion for National 4-H Week.\n\nWhile National 4-H Week served many purposes, promotion and visibility was easily at the top of the list. National 4-H Week was a time to let people know about 4-H and a time for recruitment of new members and leaders.\n\nFor a history on National 4-H Week visit the National 4-H History website section on National 4-H History. Go to:\n\nNational 4-H Theme\n\nThe history of 4-H themes is rather spotty and is still being researched. A listing of the themes through the years is located on the 4-H History website In the National 4-H History section under the title National 4-H Poster Themes.\n\nIt is believed that the use of themes at the national level began in 1924 with the theme \"Enroll in 4-H Now\" used for a poster suggested by Gertrude Warren; produced and distributed by the National Committee on Boys and Girls Club Work (a year before they even had a Supply Service).\n\nIt is indicated in the National Committee on Boys and Girls Club Work's annual report for 1932 that due to finances (the Depression) they did not distribute a poster that year... and, apparently there was no theme, as well. Research has not found any mention of 4-H themes throughout the rest of the decade of the '30s nor during the early '40s. The theme for 1944 was: \"Enlist Now – 4-H Clubs Need You to Carry Out their Victory Program in 1944.\" A similar theme was used in 1945 but using the '45 date rather than 1944. There were also colorful 4-H posters issued during the war years.\n\nFollowing World War II is when the National 4-H Poster Program, sponsored by Coats & Clark, Inc., was born and with it, annual national 4-H themes were again initiated. This program lasted until the early 1990s.\n\nIn 1975, delegates to National 4-H Congress were asked to suggest theme areas for 1976 and three were selected: \"4-H – Room to Grow,\" \"We Are Involved,\" and \"You've Got a Friend in 4-H.\" \"4-H Room to Grow\" was the designated winner.\n\nWhile the National 4-H Theme is often associated with the National 4-H Poster Program, the annual themes were much broader than just being displayed on the posters. They often became the themes and speaking points for national events including National 4-H Conference and National 4-H Congress. The National 4-H Supply Service often put out a complete line of merchandise carrying the 4-H theme – buttons, stickers, place mats, T-shirts and more.\n\nAlso, state and county 4-H programs often picked up the national theme and used it in a variety of creative ways. Themes often showed up in exhibits and on floats and at the county fair. If a particular theme was popular, it could often be seen being used locally for a year or two or more after the theme had changed to a new theme at the national level.\n\nThere is no record in the files for a national theme being designated after 1990... and even then, the same theme, \"4-H for Youth for America,\" had been used for six years straight.\n\nHistorically, 4-H themes served a very useful purpose from the standpoint of promotion and visibility and usually involved a particular direction or message that 4-H at the national level wanted to convey. Themes were very carefully selected and just by hearing the theme, one can usually visualize the message they presented. Examples: 4-H We Can Make It Happen, 4-H Room to Grow, 4-H Expanding Horizons, 4-H Pathways to the Future, Improving Family and Community Living, and Learning to Serve – Join 4-H. Some themes had an historical significance. \"Working Together for World Understanding,\" used in 1953 and 1954 was during the time when the United Nations was in its infancy and when 4-H was expanding internationally. \"4-H '76... Spirit of Tomorrow,\" was used in 1975, preparing for the nation's bicentennial.\n\nFor a complete list of themes, please visit http://4-HHistoryPreservation.com/Posters/\n\n4-H Radio Promotion\n\nWhen the National Committee on Boys and Girls Club Work (later National 4-H Council) was started in late 1921, it basically consisted of a staff of one person – Guy Noble – working at a \"desk on loan\" in the Chicago headquarters offices of the American Farm Bureau, with the assistance of a part-time secretary – also on loan. With some help, contributions were secured in 1922 from Meredith Publishing Company, Wilson and Company, International Harvester Company, Montgomery Ward and the Chicago Board of Trade.\n\nIn addition to the overwhelming burden of raising funds in unchartered waters... and, planning and managing the major national 4-H annual event, the National 4-H Congress, Guy Noble also knew that it was critical to promote the concept of 4-H to broader audiences if it was to grow. During the World War I years, 4-H enrollment dropped by over 50 percent. Noble was intrigued by this new media called \"radio.\" So as early as 1922... before it was even a year old, the National Committee on Boys and Girls Club Work became a radio pioneer.\n\nNoble made arrangements with the Westinghouse Radio Service of Chicago for news of boys and girls club work to be presented each Monday, Wednesday and Friday at 6 p.m. In 1922 there were only 30 radio stations in the country and a quarter million receiving sets scattered across the nation.\n\nMeredith publishing gave the radio broadcasts prominent play in its special publication, Boys and Girls Club Leader. \"Club members having wireless receiving sets and others who can arrange to listen in on a neighbor's set... will hear something interesting and spicy about club work,\" the magazine promised in the May 1922 issue. Within a couple of years the National Committee on Boys and Girls Club Work, partnering with Extension, USDA, were providing boys and girls club work programming on a regular basis on all three major networks. Every evening program at National 4-H Congress was broadcast across the country \"so that delegates' parents, neighbors and friends could listen in.\"\n\nIn 1929 a National 4-H Radio Party was held during National 4-H Camp, including a welcome by Dr. C. W. Warburton, director of Extension, and music by the United States Marine Band orchestra. The hour long program was broadcast over the National Broadcasting Company. Additional National 4-H Radio Parties were held for several years.\n\n1926 seemed to be the start of many state college radio stations, particularly land-grant institutions, offering their 4-H staffs air time to promote boys and girls club work and 4-H events around the state. Throughout most of the 1920s, National 4-H News was carrying the schedules of radio broadcasts, and now also included the state programs. For decades, county Extension staffs and state information staffs embraced radio, providing regular programs or information to nearly every rural radio station in America. Stations which had farm broadcasters on staff, also became \"best friends\" with 4-H. 4-H and radio, in some aspects, grew up together. Radio is one of the integral parts of 4-H history.\n\nStarting in 1965, the National 4-H Service Committee started distributing 4-H celebrity spots for radio... a popular service that lasted for a number of years. In 1978, the full year after merger, the National 4-H Council Communications Division subscribed to a national radio network service. The resulting feature placement was nearly $100,000 worth of additional national coverage, reaching a potential audience of 79,800,000 people in the United States and overseas. 1978 also saw the quarterly mailings of live radio public service copy to every station in the country being instituted.\n\nFor the complete history of 4-H and Radio, visit the section on the 4-H history website:\n\nNewspaper And Magazine Promotion\n\nTraditionally, 4-H history has not given nearly enough credit to the roles played by editors of newspapers and magazines in supporting and promoting rural boys and girls and the beginning of club work.\n\nThe first recorded prizes given for a corn contest back in the 1850s were given by a newspaper editor – Horace Greeley of the New York Tribune. The first national farm youth magazine – Junior Soldiers of the Soil – was published in January, 1919 by E. T. Meredith and Meredith Publishing Company. In 1921, Mr. Meredith became the chairman of the National Committee on Boys and Girls Club Work, later to become National 4-H Council.\n\nBoth farm editors of daily newspapers and farm magazine publishers of state and national publications were some of 4-H's strongest supporters starting back in the 1920s and even during the previous decade. Both the Newspaper Farm Editors Association and the American Agricultural Editors' Association had their annual meetings in Chicago at the same time as National 4-H Congress up at least into the 1970s. Most of them did features on the 4-H Congress winners throughout the week for their respective publications.\n\nOver the years 4-H Extension, USDA gave a number of national 4-H citations to these publications including: Farm Journal, Hoard's Dairyman, Progressive Farmer, Successful Farming, Prairie Farmer, Agricultural Leaders Digest, Southern Planter, Weekly Star Farmer, Chicago Tribune, Meredith Publishing, Newspaper Farm Editors' Association, and National Association of Farm Magazine Editors.\n\nSome of the editors and staff members of these publications were continuously promoting 4-H, like Romaine Smith, Young Folks Editor of The Progressive Farmer and Dick Orr, Rural Affairs Editor, Chicago Tribune.\n\nOthers grew up with 4-H and were honored and recognized as National 4-H Alumni winners: William D. Knox, editor, Hoard's Dairyman; Alexander Nunn, executive editor, The Progressive Farmer; C. L. \"Cap\" Mast, editor, Agricultural Leaders Digest; Harold Joiner, farm editor, The Atlanta Journal; Sallie Hill, editor of home department, The Progressive Farmer; and John Vogel, editor, Pennsylvania Farmer.\n\nWhile the agricultural press was always in close partnership with 4-H and gave much coverage to 4-H winners and 4-H events, other publications often provided 4-H features on a variety of subjects. A few of these include: Readers Digest, Seventeen, National Geographic, Family Circle, Jet, U.S. News and World Report, Time, Woman's Day, Co-Ed, TV Guide, Sunset Magazine, Scholastic, USA Today, Better Homes and Gardens, PTA Today, People Magazine, Changing Times, McCall's, Parade, Redbook, The Wall Street Journal, Money, Christian Science Monitor, and Ford Almanac.\n\nOne continual factor that perhaps the Communications staffs at National 4-H Council and both of its predecessor organizations can be faulted for is the way they did \"reporting of success\" prior to the 1980's. Annual reports and other publications would list the compiled stats – the number of releases distributed, the number of interviews, the number of media outlets reached, the number of column inches published... What impact did this visibility have? What change did it bring about? These questions never seemed to be asked... or, answered. To be fair, this was the way that the 4-H programs were also be measured – number of youth enrolled, number of trips, number of medals or scholarships, volume of Supply Service sales, circulation of 4-H News... on and on. When the simple question, \"What difference are we making?\" was asked, most of Extension had to change... including Council. Statistics just weren't enough.\n\n<\n\nNational 4-H Congress In Chicago\n\nAs 4-H history goes, there has never been another event like it. And, there never will be &emdash; National 4-H Congress in Chicago &emdash; the annual event that captivated so many for over 70 years.\n\nIt is what literally kept tens of thousands of teens in 4-H &emdash; a goal to win a trip to National 4-H Congress.\n\nGuy Noble, director of the National Committee on Boys and Girls Club Work (now National 4-H Council), who conducted the first Armour Tours of boys and girls in Chicago in 1919, and continued on with National 4-H Club Congresses for over 30 years, explained that 4-H Club Congress cannot be described on paper. One has to be a part of it and \"feel\" it to fully comprehend it. Perhaps Noble was correct. For the thousands who were fortunate enough to attend one or more of the Congresses held in Chicago it was, indeed, an experience of a lifetime. For the delegates it was awe-inspiring &emdash; new friends, new experiences, perhaps a time to think in ways they had never thought before. For the adults &emdash; the Extension leaders, representatives of donor companies, speakers and entertainers, even the media, it was inspiring &emdash; a week that often regenerated you to do your job better, lead your life more fully.\n\nWalter John, director of information services, Extension, USDA, wrote these words in the December 10, 1970 newsletter, upon returning from Chicago. In referring to 4-H Congress, John said, \"4-H Congress is the Greatest Youth Happening in Today's World. It had just about everything that appeals to youth... serious discussion, entertainment, awards, good food, music, dancing and lots of public attention.\" He went on to express his admiration for the tremendous interest and participation shown by the individual national and regional donors. \"The National 4-H Congress is the epitome of success in joint action of government, education and industry in helping youth find its role in this world.\"\n\nFor many delegates, the week in Chicago might be considered over-whelming. Being in a large city &emdash; some of the delegates coming from rural counties not having a single building with an elevator. They were now staying at the largest hotel in the world... being served meals by waiters with white gloves and perhaps eight pieces of silverware at their place setting. For that one week each year, 4-H ruled the second largest city in the nation. 4-H flags flew from every street light up and down Michigan Avenue. 4-H'ers marched down the center of State Street. They took over Marshall Fields department store, the Chicago Board of Trade and the Art Institute. Chicago media filled the airwaves and gave the young people hundreds of column inches of news copy. Corporate executives from the Fortune 500 companies not only shook their hands and honored the delegates with formal banquets and press conferences, but actually sat down and talked with them and asked about their plans for the future or about issues of the day. They heard guest speakers &emdash; everyone from Olympic stars Jesse Owens and Rafer Johnson and advise columnist Ann Landers, to aviatrix Amelia Earhart, actors Dennis Day and James Cagney, and Sgt. Alvin York. There were also sports stars such as Ted Williams and Babe Didrickson Zaharias, and politicians like John Foster Dulles and Hubert Humphrey. The delegates enjoyed the entertainment including the Brothers and Sisters, Serendipity Singers, Up With People, The Ides of March, Chandler Conspiracy, Alabama, Chicago Ballet, and Arthur Fiedler, conductor of the Boston 'Pops', leading the Chicago Symphony Orchestra for 20 years straight.\n\nDonor companies sponsoring the awards programs often brought their own media crews and blanketed the trade publications in their particular industries. Many also contracted with the Service Committee to have television interviews done with each of their 50 winners and in some cases, three interviews, one for each of the back home network affiliates. They would often bring in their own interviewers &emdash; sometimes celebrities. In the Press Headquarters, which took up an entire exhibition hall, you could possibly see Jim Nabors or Andy Griffith, top TV stars of the day, interviewing food-nutrition delegates in one booth for General Foods while the Kentucky Fried Chicken staff had Col. Harlan Sanders in the next booth with their poultry winners. And, maybe a young Dave Letterman would be in another booth interviewing Indiana delegates for his back home Indianapolis 4-H TV show called \"Clover Power.\"\n\nColonel Harlan Sanders, founder of Kentucky Fried Chicken, greets one of the poultry winners to National 4-H Congress during a television production. KFC, sponsor of the National 4-H Poultry Awards Program, televised all their sectional and national winners for back home news coverage during the Congress week.\n\nAfter 4-H Congress was over, the work was far from done. All interviews were carefully documented. Many of the broadcasters from the media regularly turned in sheets of interviews they had done during the week with the delegates from their coverage areas. The Service Committee contracted with three major clipping services and hired three part-time helpers for two months to go through clippings, separating them out by program and donor. The resulting donor reports on media coverage of the donor-sponsored programs were not only impressive; they were overwhelming. This is one of the reasons the Service Committee was able to retain these large awards donors for an average of 20 years tenure. None of them ever received that kind of factual reporting for other contributions they were making.\n\nWhile Chicagoans certainly knew that the 4-H'ers \"were in town,\" people across America, particularly in the '30s-'70s, also knew that 4-H Congress was once again going on in Chicago. News reels being shown in the movie houses across America reported from 4-H Congress, as well as all the radio networks; and, later nightly network TV news covered the event.\n\nOne example of this: Coverage of National 4-H Congress just by Chicago newspapers alone, in 1953 totaled 4,711 column inches of stories &emdash; nearly 27 full newspaper pages eight columns wide! With Chicago then the center of the infant television industry in the '50s, the National Committee was able to attract nationwide audiences for 4-H with 65 network and 150 Chicago radio-TV broadcasts at the '54 National 4-H Congress.\n\nFrom the standpoint of promotion and visibility and bringing the achievements of 4-H &emdash; and 4-H'ers &emdash; to the general public, there is little doubt that National 4-H Congress in Chicago is at the top of the list.\n\nThe National 4-H History Preservation team has researched and written a history of National 4-H Congress which is completed in draft form (some 200 pages) but not yet up on the history website.\n\nCanning Clubs Get Underway\n\nWith boys' corn clubs successfully under way, it was inevitable that the Washington office should sponsor a program for girls.\n\nBy 1910 O. B. Martin was hearing from all over the South – demands that girls' work be federally sponsored as the corn clubs were. Programs for girls were not new. A number of states had successfully started girls' club work. The question was, how much of this should Farmers' Cooperative Demonstration Work at USDA put into its program for the South?\n\nSeaman Knapp was never in favor of scattering one's effort over so wide a program that none of it made an impression. His idea was to begin by doing one thing, and doing it so well that the program would sell itself. In the boys' program he had started with one crop – corn. The same method should be adopted for girls. Ideas were discussed with various states during the fall of 1909 and out of these discussions came the idea of having girls grow and can one vegetable – the tomato.\n\nThe tomato was selected because it was universally grown and appreciated. It wasn't too difficult to get a good crop. It was acid and therefore easy to can without danger of excessive spoilage. Each girl should be asked to plant a plot large enough to provide tomatoes not only for family use, but for sale. The plot agreed upon was a tenth of an acre.\n\nDuring the Christmas holidays of 1909, Martin outlines these ideas tentatively to the school teachers assembled at the annual state educational association meeting in Columbia, South Carolina. The teachers listened with interest, but only one of them caught the vision and put the plan into practice. Miss Marie S. Cromer, a country school teacher from Aiken county, went home and spent her Saturdays writing letters to girls, enlisting them in the project. When spring came, 46 volunteers were setting out their tenth-acre plots in accordance with instructions from the Department of Agriculture.\n\nMeanwhile another state, knowing that a domestic science program was in the wind, was making preparations for 1910. In Richmond, Virginia, the alert Dr. J. D. Eggleston, state superintendent of public instruction, asked the state demonstration agent, T. O. Sandy, where he could find a capable woman to develop such a program for rural schools. Sandy recommended Ella G. Agnew, a remarkable young Virginia woman currently working for the YWCA in Toledo. Eggleston wrote her that if she would like to do something for rural girls there was a place for her in her home state. Miss Agnew arrived in Richmond on February 1, 1910. Although she was put to work organizing cooking classes, they told her they had \"something else\" for her to do later. That \"something else\" became apparent on May 31, when Miss Agnew was called to the state capitol to meet with Dr. Knapp, Governor William H. Mann, and various other officials and legislators. There, Miss Agnew learned that she was to teach country girls to grow and can tomatoes. Knapp crisply outlined her duties: She was to begin with only two counties, organize small manageable groups, and concentrate on tomatoes. Her title was to be \"State Agent of Girls' Tomato Clubs.\" In Washington, Knapp had trouble persuading the Secretary of Agriculture, James Wilson, to appoint a woman as field representative of the department. There was no precedent for it. Field representatives were men. All the agents for Farmers' Cooperative Demonstration Work were men. Knapp's ideas prevailed, however, and on June 3, 1910, Ella Agnew received her appointment as the Department's \"State Agent of Girls' Tomato Clubs – the first home demonstration agent ever appointed by the Department of Agriculture.\n\nWhile Virginia was laying the groundwork for home demonstration, the tomatoes in the plots of Miss Cromer's school girls were getting ripe down in Aiken county, South Carolina, and it was up to Knapp's office to do something about it. The Department mailed each of Miss Cromer's girls letters, instructional leaflets, and farmers' bulletins. By July, the tomatoes were becoming full and red, and it was time to go ahead with the next step in the program – canning. The task fell to O. B. Martin, since the experiment was taking place in his home state. The task was complicated by the fact that a public-spirited woman had financed Miss Cromer to a summer of domestic science study in New England and the young teacher had departed for the North. Thus, the first experiments in canning had to be conducted without the services of the woman who led the club. A meeting of the tomato club was called at Aiken on July 16. A big canning outfit, shipped from Illinois, was set up on the courthouse lawn. Since Martin knew next to nothing about canning, he had Miss Carrie Hyde, home economics teacher of Winthrop College, take charge of actual operations. Miss Hyde, however, knew little about canning in tin. The powers-that-be had decided to teach canning in tin because girls were going to sell their surplus, and housewives were used to buying tins rather than glass jars. To help Miss Hyde with this phase of the work, Martin rounded up a tinner, and for good measure had a plumber and carpenter standing by. The scene on the Aiken courthouse lawn was an historic one, forerunner of many more such scenes to take place in the next few years. There were long tables at which women worked blanching and peeling tomatoes. Clustered about their baskets filled with red fruit, were some 25 girls. Off to one side was the canner, \"as large as a two-horse wagon body,\" with smoke pouring from the stack. There were eager parents watching and helping, and idle onlookers wondering what crazy idea the government was up to now. The canning bee ran three days and the crowds got larger each day. Enthusiasm for the canning demonstration was running high. Other communities in the county wanted to have sessions, so it was planned to move the canning outfit around the county, giving every girl a chance to put up her produce. That first session at Aiken in July, 1910, produced a champion. One 14-year old girl named Katie Gunter came in every day, driving the two miles in a buggy, bringing in basket after basket of ripe tomatoes, all the products of her tenth-acre plot. When her pack was finished and counted, it was found that she had 512 No. 3 cans of tomatoes. She was declared county champion and later the state legislature recognized her achievement by passing an act giving her a scholarship at Winthrop College. [Later that same year, Jerry Moore, the corn champion, was to be similarly honored with a college scholarship.]\n\nThe Aiken county canners had provided themselves with artistic labels bearing a picture of a tomato and the words: \"South Carolina Tomatoes.\" On the other side were the words: \"Grown and Packed by the Aiken County Girls' Tomato Club.\"\n\nWhen Marie Cromer returned to Aiken county from New England, she received an appointment as an agent of the Department of Agriculture on August 16, 1910, 10 weeks after the appointment of Miss Agnew in Virginia. There is a historical marker in Abbeville, South Carolina in honor of Marie (Cromer) Seigler as \"founder of a girls' tomato club, the first of many such clubs nationwide.\"\n\nMarie Cromer, who started the first girls' tomato club, and Ella Agnew, the first home demonstration agent ever appointed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, are truly two remarkable pioneers. (taken from The 4-H Story by Franklin Reck)\n\nThe Frankie Welch 4-H Scarf\n\nFrankie Welch was born Mary Frances Barnett in Rome, Georgia and graduated from Furman University in South Carolina where she met her husband, William Welch. She also studied at the University of Georgia and the University of Wisconsin. While at Wisconsin, she was influenced by Frank Lloyd Wright's lifestyle and architectural discipline.\n\nMrs. Welch operated a fashionable ladies boutique in Alexandria, Virginia and became a favorite designer for Washingtonians of influence, particularly with her political and institutional designs. She became a protégé of Lady Bird Johnson and designed her \"Discover America\" scarf and staged the first fashion show in the White House for Lady Bird. During the 1968 political campaigns, Frankie was the favored choice of both the Democrats and Republicans, designing their \"official\" attire. The following year she was appointed by the White House to design the \"Forward Together\" scarf which was given as a souvenir at President Richard Nixon's Inaugural Ball. She designed the gown which First Lady Betty Ford designated for the official portrait as well as the wax figure in the Smithsonian in the Hall of First Ladies; and, Mrs. Welch was commissioned to design political attire for the Jimmy Carter campaign and for Ronald Reagan. In 1976 she originated the American Revolution Bicentennial Administration scarf.\n\nFrankie Welch was particularly known for her scarf designs and counts well over 1,000 major corporations, national associations, museums and universities as her \"scarf customers\" for which she has designed scarves.\n\nA frequent visitor to the Alexandria boutique, who became a friend of Frankie Welch, was Eleanor L. Wilson, 4-H Extension USDA staff member (currently a member of the National 4-H History Preservation leadership team). One day, Eleanor mentioned that it would be nice if Frankie could design a scarf for 4-H. Frankie thought this was a tremendous idea and asked Eleanor to bring some 4-H emblems and other items over to her apartment so they could start designing a scarf. The Frankie Welch 4-H scarf is the result. The 8\" x 33\" scarf was sold during the late 1980's through the National 4-H Supply Service (now 4-H Mall) and was often used as prized gifts in honoring people at the national level. Through Frankie's dimensional standardization, this versatile method for example, allows one square to become a pocket kerchief or cocktail napkin, and the entire three or four squares make a lady's scarf.\n\n4-H Celebrity Promotional Spots\n\nBeginning in 1965... and, extending into the 1970s, the National 4-H Service Committee, in cooperation with the Cooperative Extension Service, provided an annual \"package\" of radio public service announcements promoting 4-H just prior to National 4-H Week. Voiced by \"celebrities,\" the spots were popular with the stations and many used them year round. The state Extension radio editors and state 4-H offices also used the recordings to the fullest.\n\nThe spots were produced on 2-sided 33-1/3 RPM vinyl records and distributed to nearly every radio station in the country – big or small. Larry Krug, the Service Committee's radio-TV specialist, was responsible for writing the scripts, contacting the celebrities (or their managers) and having the records produced and shipped.\n\nKrug says, \"We had very little budget for this annual project and spent most of it on mailing the records to the radio stations.\" He says, \"I remember fondly the hot summer afternoon, leaving the 4-H office in Chicago's Loop and taking the elevated train north to Wrigley Field lugging my old, heavy Wollensak reel-to-reel tape recorder. I did the radio spots with Ernie Banks in the Chicago Cubs dugout before the game.\" Another time, Krug says, I went down to Rensselaer, Indiana with Jerry Deuel, editor, National 4-H News, to the Chicago Bears training camp to interview and record Gale Sayers, who had recently been named Rookie of the Year. After the 4-H interviews the PR staff invited us to stay for lunch with the team in the big building just off the training field. The food providers placed a plate including two large baked potatoes and a 24-oz. steak in front of each of us. As the big football players were scarfing down their lunch – obviously all members of the \"clean plate club\" – Jerry and I felt we had no choice but to eat everything on our plates, too. We were in misery our entire drive back to Chicago.\n\nSome of the celebrities voicing the 4-H spots on the records include: entertainers Arthur Godfrey, Bob Hope, Eddie Albert, Ernie Ford and Diahann Carroll. Also, television personalities Mike Douglas and Johnny Carson.\n\nSports stars represented included Quarterback Bart Starr of the Green Bay Packers, Chicago Cubs first baseman Ernie Banks, Baltimore Colts quarterback Johnny Unitas, Chicago Bears running back Gale Sayers, race car drivers Richard Petty and Parnelli Jones, Ted Williams of the Boston Red Sox, and Dallas Cowboys quarterback Don Meredith.\n\nAdditional celebrities voicing spots: actors Bill Cosby and Jimmy Stewart; astronaut James Lovell; Miss America Marilyn Van Derbur; Vice President Hubert Humphrey, and columnist Ann Landers.\n\nWhile many of these names may not be familiar today, 45+ years ago most of them were certainly \"star power.\"\n\nIn later years – probably the early '80s – two additional celebrity packages were distributed which included VIPs Telly Savalas, Pat Boone, Glenn Campbell, Tanya Tucker, Roy Rogers, The Captain and Tenille, Archie Griffin, The Fifth Dimension, Eric Estrada, Sugar Ray Leonard, Rita Moreno and Charlie Pride.\n\nThere was certainly nothing unique about the 4-H celebrity records. Some other organizations were doing the same thing. But responses the National 4-H Service Committee got back from the stations on the return postcards that accompanied the records were sometimes unbelievable. It was not unusual for a station to reply that they had aired the spots 100 times, or 150 times!... with the added notation, \"Please send us more.\"\n\nHere are samples of the spots:\n\nErnie Ford\n\n\"This is Ernie Ford saluting 4-H members and leaders everywhere for their fine accomplishments. As a father of 4-H members, I certainly want to commend these two and three-quarter million young people who live up to the 4-H motto, \"Learning by Doing.\" Nowadays, boys and girls wherever they live can enjoy belonging to 4-H. They learn new skills and experiences, and leadership responsibilities. So, if you're between the ages of nine and 19 – or are a parent of a boy or girl between nine and 19 – take it from Ernie Ford – enroll them in 4-H, an opportunity well worthwhile.\"\n\nBob Hope\n\n\"Hi, this is Bob Hope saluting America's three million 4-H boys and girls who are setting examples for 4-H organizations in 80 other countries around the world. There's even an active 4-H program in war-torn Vietnam, where the government has issued a postage stamp in honor of 4-H as being one of the few hopes of the future that lives and grows each day in their country. 4-H has something to offer every boy or girl between the ages of nine through 19, or if you're over 19, become a 4-H leader, an opportunity to help today's youth.\" [It was during this period that Bob Hope was doing his annual Christmas tours to the war zones, including Vietnam.]\n\nJim Nabors\n\n\"This is Jim Nabors saluting 4-H members everywhere for the fine job they are doing in helping to build a stronger America. Through their modern educational programs, 4-H has something to offer all youth wherever you may live. Such a strong program has kindled the way to 4-H-like organizations around the world. I had the opportunity to meet sixteen hundred of these young people at National 4-H Congress in Chicago and felt comforted to see these young Americans gathered and to know that our nation will continue to thrive in capable leadership for many, many more years. If you're between nine and 19 and would like to join 4-H – take it from Jim Nabors – join today – you'll be glad you did.\"\n\nErnie Banks\n\n\"This is Ernie Banks with the Chicago Cubs, saluting a real fine youth organization – 4-H. There are three million boys and girls in this country learning how to do things and having fun through 4-H. And now days they come from the cities and suburbs as well as the country – in fact, we have 150 4-H Clubs right here in the city of Chicago! If you're between the ages of nine through nineteen, take it from Ernie Banks – hit a home run with 4-H by contacting your county extension office today.\"\n\nThe 'Campaign for 4-H' Celebration\n\nThe climax of National 4-H Council's $50 million \"Campaign for 4-H\" was celebrated on December 6, 1988 during the 67th National 4-H Congress in Chicago.\n\nThe 1,600 teen delegates to 4-H Congress were joined at the Tuesday night gala by nearly 1,000 guests representing leadership of the public-private partnership of 4-H support. Many corporate executives, university officials, government representatives, leaders from cooperating organizations and associations attended.\n\nFrom the opening ceremonies with the U.S. Navy Color Guard and the National 4-H Congress Chorus singing \"America the Beautiful,\" to the closing with the music group Three Dog Night playing their hit song, \"Celebrate,\" the recognition event, \"America's Youth: The Challenge and The Opportunity,\" was something special.\n\nMajor Campaign donors were honored and revered with standing ovations as young delegate advisors boomed out their names to come on stage. Videos shown on large screens reflected the dramatic impact the 5-year funding effort would have on youth education. As special effects video were used to visually build to the final Campaign total and the emcee announced $58 million – $8 million over the Campaign goal – celebrating was in order!\n\nCampaign Chairman Robert B. Gill, vice chairman, J.C. Penney Company, Inc. and vice chairman of Council's board of trustees, stated, \"the fact that 4-H was successful in meeting, and surpassing, the Campaign goal clearly signals that this youth development program has a constituency and a support base that is strong and deep across America.\"\n\nBoard Chairman Lawrie Thomas, president, Amoco Oil Company, in publically thanking Bob Gill for the leadership he had provided over the five years of the Campaign emphasized, \"this has been a volunteer driven campaign and we are proud of the corps of volunteers from both the public and private sectors that have made this campaign a success.\"\n\n\"Success of this largest fund-raising effort in 4-H history,\" Thomas said, \"has greatly enhanced the ability of the Cooperative Extension System to play a key role in addressing societal problems that threaten our youth and indeed the very fabric of America.\"\n\nAll 37 major donors giving one-half million dollars or more to the Campaign were present and individually recognized on stage.\n\nA highlight of the program was the premiere of three video programs designed to strengthen and broaden the land-grant universities' Cooperative Extension System youth outreach mission. This major project, \"America's Youth: The Challenge and The Opportunity,\" was produced by J.C. Penney Company, Inc. in cooperation with the Cooperative Extension System and National 4-H Council.\n\nSeveral major corporations made special gifts to support the Campaign success celebration: Amoco Corporation, Inc.; Coats & Clark; Deere & Company, Eastman Kodak Company; Ford Motor Company Fund; The General Foods Fund, Inc.; International Paper Company Foundation; Nabisco Brands; J.C. Penney Company, Inc.; Ralston Purina Company, Purina Dog Foods Group; and Unocal Corporation.\n\nNational Conversation On Youth Development In The 21st Century\n\nThe most succinct explanation of this program appears in the 2001 Annual Report of National 4-H Council. It states:\n\n\"No program or project that Council has undertaken in 2001 better illustrates how Council is living its mission than its work on the \"National Conversation on Youth Development in the 21st Century – 4-H's gift to the nation to commemorate its Centennial. This initiative consists of Conversations, hosted by 4-H, with youth and adults in every county in the nation, followed by State Conversations in each state, the District of Columbia, Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and five territories, and culminating with a National Conversation in Washington, D.C. Through these Conversations, 4-H will build an action plan for positive youth development at the national and community levels and present it to President Bush, his Cabinet, and Congress. Building upon these Conversations, 4-H intends to engage the nation in positive youth development programs, continuing to address youth challenges, build youth skills, generate civic involvement, and create better communities. A schedule of all Conversations, Power of YOUth Pledge campaign statistics, and all 4-H Centennial information are available at 4hcentennial.org\n\n\"As a trusted representative of the 4-H movement on the national level, Council has been a key force in efforts to secure Public Law 107-19, which authorizes $5 million dollars in Federal funding to support the 4-H Centennial Initiative. Council has taken the lead in raising funds to match those monies provided by the government. This effort has been well received by those on Capitol Hill.\n\n\"When it launched its work on this project, Council used its role of generating big 'out of the box' ideas to help create a unique model of working with a former congressman and a well-respected Agriculture lobbying firm to open many doors on Capitol Hill. This team was able to tap into an overwhelming groundswell of support for 4-H and its Centennial Initiative. As a result, Public Law 107-19 passed unanimously in both the House and the Senate and was signed by President George W. Bush. Acting as a facilitator for the 4-H System, National 4-H Council was also pivotal in securing support from former Senator Bob Dole, and former Speaker of the House and Ambassador to Japan, Tom Foley. Dole and Foley have agreed to Co-chair the 4-H Centennial Initiative.\"\n\nProgrammatically, no project National 4-H Council took on in 2001 in preparation for the 4-H centennial illustrated how Council was living its mission than its work on the \"National Conversation on Youth Development in the 21st Century.\"\n\nThe National 4-H History Preservation team is attempting to document the history of the 4-H Centennial year, but undoubtedly, this part of the celebration – the \"National Conversation\" – generated much exposure and visibility and certainly belongs in the history of 4-H promotion.\n\n[4hcentennial.org no longer exists; the URL automatically transfers visitors to the 4-H history preservation website.]\n\nNational 4-H Alumni Surveys - 1985\n\nThe year 1985 was a significant year for National 4-H Council regarding how former participants of the 4-H program felt about the program... the impact. At that time 4-H had 40 million living alumni. This is an overwhelming figure, but yet remained basically meaningless... valueless... without some further explanation or documentation. Who are these alumni? What do they think about their 4-H experience? Was it of any sustaining value to them?\n\nSeveral projects were done during the first seven or eight months of the year. Over 50,000 alumni were identified through these projects. Most of these projects were done by National 4-H Council's Communications Division in partnership with Council's Resource Development Office.\n\nDonors assisted with some surveys, carrying an alumni query response card as an insert in their house organ. Others placed an alumni identification \"stuffer\" in with their monthly customer credit card mailings. Direct mail appeals... one over Roy Rogers' signature, were done.\n\nIn some cases, responses were tremendously high. For example, a survey done by 4-H Council of 4,300 state and national awards winners from 1965-75 – 10 to 20 years ago – using 10 to 20 year old addresses and a 7-page narrative paper survey, resulted in over 2,000 respondents, a 50% return!\n\nAdditionally, responses from the alumni were traditionally very positive relating to their 4-H experiences. Many 4-H alumni credit 4-H with selection of their career. The skills taught in 4-H relating to public speaking and record-keeping also were mentioned over and over again. And, third, many respondents continued to be involved, either as local leaders or 4-H parents.\n\nResults of all of these surveys became a strong part of a promotion program, keeping alumni informed and engaged and ultimately as resources for knowledge, as well as dollars!\n\nAlthough the actual results of the surveys completed in 1985 have not yet been located, the best record of this effort is a copy of a speech given by Council's Communication Division Director Larry Krug at the 1985 National 4-H Donors' Conference in Chicago entitled \"An Investment Report: Allegiance of Former Participants.\" This will soon be digitized and placed in the Books and Printed Materials Archive on the 4-H History website.\n\nThe National 4-H Alumni Program history is on the 4-H history website at:\n\nPublic Relations Ploy Sways American Banking Executives\n\nIn the spring of 1923, the tiny National Committee on Boys and Girls Club Work, still only in its second year of existence, was busy bringing club work to the attention of business groups as one of the year's main objectives. According to Reck's \"The 4-H Story,\" Guy Noble, as director, pulled off one of the most dramatic bits of public relations work with the American Bankers' Association. Already Noble had interested J. H. Puelicher, Milwaukee banker and then president of the ABA, a self-made man who had made his first money getting up at five o'clock in the morning to clerk in a store, and had a soft spot in his heart for the farm boy who understood early rising and manual labor.\n\nNoble arranged with two state leaders to have 4-H members give club demonstrations before the executive council of the ABA in order to let the bankers see with their own eyes what club work was all about. The event took place at the swank Rye-Biltmore Country Club in the metropolitan suburb of Rye, New York. About 300 banking executives were present. To this august meeting Miss. Elsie Trabue, assistant state club leader in Connecticut, brought a team of two girls – Marion Eggleston and Elizabeth Perkins. As they rode into the grounds, their taxi driver asked them dubiously, \"Front or rear door?\"\n\nThe girls went in the front door, and in the large lounge with its velour drapes and paneled walls, the young ladies went to work cutting up chicken and canning it over an oil stove.\n\nNobody left the hall. This was a floor show with a different touch. The bankers looked on, fascinated. One of them was over-heard murmuring, \"My daughter is getting a fancy education at Vassar but, you know, I'd like to think that somewhere along the line she would get some of this kind of education.\"\n\nTwo young Pennsylvania club boys, selected by A. L. Barker, state club leader, introduced the bankers to the masculine side of club work. On the immaculately tailored and landscaped grounds of the Rye-Biltmore, they stood beside a purebred Ayrshire calf. After the manner of demonstrations, one club member introduced himself and his partner, then told in confident tones how he had bought the calf at what seemed to his neighbors an extravagant price, but how the calf's mother had set a milk record, with the result that the young owner had already been offered three times the purchase price of the calf.\n\nAfter giving his simple tale of the profitableness of good stock, he yielded the floor to his partner, who proceeded to tell his audience what points of conformation and temperament to look for in a milk cow.\n\nTo dramatize club work further, Noble had worked up beautifully done charts – one of them patterned after a bank statement – showing the activities and profits of club work.\n\nFollowing the Rye-Biltmore demonstrations, the ABA endorsed club work as its top agricultural project and later, when the Capper-Ketcham bill was before Congress, gave its unqualified support to the legislation.\n\nHow the Popular Character 'Chris Clover' Evolved\n\nAs relayed by Kathryn (Cox) Pepple, Ohio State University Extension 4-H Specialist Emeritus, the idea for Chris Clover originated in a series of seven cartoon strips titled \"Cliff Clover and the Seven Fashkins\" developed in the early 1970's by Ohio State 4-H Fashion Board and their advisors Norma Deyo Pitts and Orena Haynes. Those original cartoon strips were offered free to local newspapers throughout Ohio, and were printed by several as a weekly feature. Their purpose was to promote 4-H clothing project opportunities and to increase awareness of the seven clothing program objectives (aka \"seven clues to a total look\" - fashion, design, fit, construction, grooming, posture and poise, and personable qualities). Cliff Clover was the large clover-shaped narrator character in each strip, and the seven clues were depicted as smaller clover \"faskins\".\n\nThe Cliff Clover series proved to be pretty popular and well-received, and it occurred to Fred Bruny (Assistant State 4-H Leader in Ohio's State 4-H Office), Chuck Lifer (Ohio's State 4-H Leader), and Paul zumFelde (4-H Agent in Fulton County, Ohio) in late 1976 that the idea could be expanded and developed to promote the overall 4-H program. Kathy relates that she was beginning her Msc. Studies at OSU after returning from being an IFYE, so Dr. Bruny invited me to be involved and take leadership for part of the expansion effort as an independent study project within my master's program - an opportunity which I gratefully accepted.\n\nKathy says, also by that time I had become the 4-H agent in Monroe County, Ohio and worked with the county's 4-H Junior Leaders and my father (Forrest Cox) to develop the first \"Chris Clover Walking-Talking Mascot Figure\". The Chris Clover figure was introduced by The OSU Marching Band at the 1978 State 4-H Advisors Recognition Banquet during 4-H Week. The first costume figure was made available for loan to counties after that, and was used to promote 4-H in parades, at numerous county fairs and 4-H banquets, and at many other events over the next few years.\n\nAlthough the first Chris Clover mascot figure was very sturdy, over time it became apparent that its plywood construction was a bit heavy for younger 4-H'ers to manage. So 4-H advisors with sewing skills in a few counties adapted the original pattern and made lighter-weight fabric-over-foam versions that were also used in local 4-H promotional activities in the early 1980's.\n\nKathy says, we also introduced and offered Chris Clover for use nationwide at the National Association of Extension 4-H Agents conferences in 1979 and 1980. 4-H professionals who wished to use Chris Clover in promoting their programs received camera-ready copies of the cartoons strips and directions for constructing a Chris Clover walking-talking mascot figure during the NAE4-HA workshops, and were able to order bumber stickers, one-inch stickers, and other items at cost.\n\nThen in the mid-1980's Coca-Cola featured a talking robot promoting the 4-H areas they sponsored at another national 4-H event (probably National 4-H Congress). That sparked the idea in Dennis Elliott (OSU State Extension 4-H Specialist) for a new generation \"Chris the Clover Rover\" robot to promote 4-H. He obtained funding through the Ohio 4-H Foundation and worked through staff at Coca-Cola to contact the manufacturers of the robot, and worked with them to develop a remote-controlled green and white R2D2 type of robot with interchangeable magnetic 4-H photo signage and a remote microphone. He developed scripts and provided training for 4-H student assistants and Collegiate 4-H members to travel and appear with the robot to promote and increase awareness of 4-H at numerous county, state, and national events through the late 1980's and early 1990's.\n\nEarly Childrens Educational Television And 4-H\n\nMr. I. Magination in New York City, Engineer Bill in Los Angeles, and the Land of Ziggy Zoggo in Chicago were all programs created to entertain children across the country in the early days of television with humor and a few tidbits of education. There were a number of local programs produced for children – usually airing early in the morning before school, late afternoon after school, and on Saturday mornings. Most of the early shows had a colorful host who often came close to being considered \"goofy.\" Many assumed roles of clowns, magicians or sea captains. Cartoons were used heavily, along with studio \"chatter,\" almost as if they were making the program up as they went along, i.e. no script. Indeed, a number of these shows absolutely did function totally with no script. One of the most popular of these, which started in 1947, was \"Kukla, Fran and Ollie,\" starring Fran Allison, a radio comedienne, and a group of puppets. The program was totally ad-libbed. And, coming a little later was one of the most popular children's shows – Bozo's Circus – produced both nationally and with local franchises.\n\nAlthough most of the children's programs were for the young audience of 6-10 years old, historically there was one tremendously successful exception – the long-playing series, \"Romper Room,\" targeting preschoolers, which began in 1953.\n\nSo, where does 4-H fit into all of this? You guessed it... at the beginning. Back in the early and mid-50s, it seemed to work this way: whenever a city starting broadcasting from their very first TV station, Extension was there. County and state Extension staff provided educational information to the station relating to agriculture, home economics, family living, gardening... and, of course, 4-H. Local Extension produced and hosted programs didn't appear until the mid-1950s to late 50s. 4-H television series started in the late 1950s, the first programs produced by Michigan State, but used not only throughout Michigan, but in a number of other states. The 4-H TV Electrical Series and 4-H TV Science Series were the first of these projects.\n\nBy the mid-1960s Extension indicated that they wanted more. Informal research conducted by the Extension Service and National 4-H Service Committee indicated the validity of the concept that 4-H produced television series could reach more young people, especially those not enrolled in the program, and that if planned and produced correctly, learning would take place. Extension Service, USDA supported the production of additional series and named Eleanor L. Wilson as the national 4-H TV coordinator. The National 4-H Service Committee also was committed to educational television for children and partnered with the national Extension office. Larry Krug, radio-television editor, National 4-H Service Committee, says that during this period 4-H met with many people who were getting involved in children's educational television programming to discuss 4-H's plans and to seek out their advise and to exchange ideas and concepts. He recalls while attending the first national conference on children's educational television, having a breakfast session with Bob Keeshan (Captain Kangaroo) and Fred Rogers (Mr. Rogers Neighborhood). The following month Krug journeyed from Chicago to Boston to have a more in depth session with Joan Ganz Cooney and Peggy Charrin of Children's Television Workshop who were working on Sesame Street.\n\nDuring the decade of the 70s, and into the early 80s, a number of 4-H television series were produced nationally, and by states for multi-state use. These included Mulligan Stew, Blue Sky Below My Feet, Dog Sense, TV Action Club, Teen Mobile Club, 4-H TV Fun on Wheels Club, 4-H Photo Fun Club, Living in a Nuclear Age, and perhaps more.\n\nMillions of new 4-H members were enrolled... most from urban areas. The era of 4-H educational television series was an exciting one, and the visibility the different series produced for 4-H was impressive on a number of fronts.\n\nDetroit Free Press's Noteworthy Special\n\nIt is not uncommon for daily or weekly newspapers to do special features during National 4-H Week or during the 4-H fair, however this story certainly exemplifies \"how to do it right.\"\n\nOn February 19, 1987, the \"Detroit Free Press\" – the nation's eighth largest daily newspaper – ran a special eight page section. It was particularly \"special\" to those associated with 4-H because the entire section was about Michigan 4-H Youth Programs.\n\nA total of 19 feature articles extolled the virtues of 4-H and the benefits of 4-H programs to kids. They were written by Michigan's Governor James Blanchard; Michigan State University President John DiBiaggio; Ford Motor Company President and Chairman of National 4-H Council Harold Poling; and by Orville Redenbacher and Bob Evans. In addition to other features by key leaders in the state of Michigan, features were included by two other National 4-H Council trustees, Philip Smith, president, General Foods Corporation, and Donald Keough, president, The Coca-Cola Company.\n\nHow did it happen that a major daily newspaper with circulation of more than 645,000 devoted eight pages to Michigan 4-H programs? Two important factors were involved.\n\nFirst, luck. Michigan 4-H was fortunate to have Brenda Schneider on their side. Schneider is vice president and director of community relations for Manufacturers National Bank in Detroit. As a community service, the bank frees her to edit special sections for Detroit Free Press on a regular basis. This was the first time a non-profit youth organization was spotlighted in a section of this kind in the Free Press. Here's where the luck comes in.\n\nSchneider is a big supporter and a great advocate of 4-H. (She also happens to be married to 14-year veteran 4-H agent, Tom Schneider!) Once she got one 4-H foot in the door, Mike Tate, Director of 4-H in Michigan, and others made a presentation to about 125 Detroit Free Press staff members using a six-projector multi-image slide presentation called \"Take a look at us now!\" The goal of the presentation was to help the Free Press folks see that the Michigan State University's Extension 4-H program is for kids in all areas of Michigan – helping them explore careers, learn to understand and accept themselves and have some fun along the way.\n\nOnce the support of the newspaper staff members was garnered, Schneider contacted all the writers featured in the section and asked them to write an article about how they felt about 4-H.\n\nA second factor in the Detroit Free Press success story is the continued excellence of 4-H programs in Michigan and across the nation. It's that fine reputation, the testimonials of successful former 4-H'ers and the continued impact 4-H programs make on kids and communities that helps glean the enthusiasm of the right people at the right time. This time the result was a fantastic and invaluable way to increase public awareness of 4-H programs."
