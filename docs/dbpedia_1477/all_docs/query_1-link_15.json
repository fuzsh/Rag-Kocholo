Through the years, the Service's mission has encompassed agricultural education, agricultural extension work, home demonstration work, and rural extension. In 1909, the Service played a vital role in establishing boys' clubs, which later became 4-H clubs. Through the Home Demonstration Department (later Department of Family and Consumer Sciences), girls' clubs were soon added to the programs available for young people. The records represent both single and serialized items. Materials range in date from 1916 to 2022, and include archived web cotent.\n\nAlthough extension and demonstration work in North Carolina had been active since the early years of the twentieth century, the North Carolina Agricultural Extension Service was only officially created in 1914 as a result of the Smith-Lever Act. In 1991 the name was changed to the current one, the Cooperative Extension Service.\n\nBiographical/historical note\n\nFrom its inception as the North Carolina College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts, North Carolina State University has been deeply involved in outreach and extension work. In the 1890s and early 1900s, college personnel took part in numerous Farmers' Institutes statewide, where they and State Agricultural Department personnel met with local farmers to discuss farm improvement techniques. In 1907 James A. Butler became North Carolina's first county agent, hired to conduct demonstration work in boll weevil eradication.\n\nIn 1909, State College (later North Carolina State University) expanded its extension efforts when it signed a memorandum of agreement with the United States Department of Agriculture to cooperatively develop Farmers' Boys' Clubs, or Corn Clubs. Ira O. Schaub became the first director of this program, which eventually became the 4-H program. The first Girls' Clubs, focusing primarily on tomato canning and gardening, were established after Jane McKimmon was hired in 1911 to lead a statewide Home Demonstration program.\n\nGreatly boosting extension work, the 1914 Smith-Lever Act provided for federal, state, and county cooperation in creating a system to expand demonstration and extension work for men and women. The law authorized land-grant colleges to sign memoranda of understanding with the United States Department of Agriculture to begin such work. With this, State College created a new Department of Extension.\n\nIn 1924, Schaub returned as the new Extension director, a position he held until 1950. Administratively, Extension changed as more and more of its functions were transferred to State College. The 1920s and 1930s saw widespread change in the extension youth programs as well. Schaub appointed Lera R. Harrill as State 4-H Club Leader in 1926.\n\nDuring World War II, extension programs played a vital role in the local war effort. The postwar years saw the Extension Division move closer administratively to the College's School of Agriculture. In 1950 a reorganization of the School of Agriculture brought the three fields of work - teaching, research, and extension - into the direct orbit of the School.\n\nEconomic difficulties in the 1970s saw the Extension Service increase its activities in rural food production and nutrition, including the Expanded Food and Nutrition Education Program (EFNEP). Extension also worked with farmers facing serious economic troubles to improve their situations. In 1991, the North Carolina Agricultural Extension Service changed its name to the North Carolina Cooperative Extension Service to better reflect a shift in activities beyond the development of state and local agriculture.\n\nScope/content\n\nThe North Carolina Cooperative Extension Service Publications records contain a wide variety of published material relating to the activities, aims, functions, and programs of the Service. Through the years, the Service's mission has encompassed agricultural education, agricultural extension work, home demonstration work, and rural extension. In 1909, the Service played a vital role in establishing boys' clubs, which later became 4-H clubs. Through the Home Demonstration Department (later Department of Family and Consumer Sciences), girls' clubs were soon added to the programs available for young people.\n\nThe materials range in date from 1916 to 2019. The publications represent both single and serialized items, as well as web content, although it should be noted that the records are far from complete. In addition, for some older serialized and numbered publications, bound and/or microfilmed copies also exist in the Libraries' general stacks. These copies are also likely to be more complete than many of the same publications in this collection. More detailed information can be found in the scope and content notes for each series.\n\nArrangement\n\nThe Cooperative Extension Service Publications records are divided into five series: 4-H Publications, Family and Consumer Science Publications, Numbered Publications, Non-Numbered Publications, and Web Content.\n\nUse of these materials\n\nThe nature of the NC State University Libraries' Special Collections means that copyright or other information about restrictions may be difficult or even impossible to determine despite reasonable efforts.
