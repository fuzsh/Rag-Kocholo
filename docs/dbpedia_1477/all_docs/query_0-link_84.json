        "text": "Page last updated on: 2023y_08m_14d_0052t\n\nBelow is an incomplete list of Atari 2600 video game release dates by month in the USA for the year 1977 along with lists of top 100 music (selected hits in the order they charted), new movies at the theater, and new TV shows to help summon your treasured memories of the Atari 2600 years with the bonus of recreating the magical feelings of that special time.\n\nIf you were too young or not even born yet, play the songs in the order they are listed and watch short video clips or commercials for the movies and TV shows (in order) and you might start to feel what it was like back then in 1977. There were no smartphones or an Internet full of knowledge and entertainment at your fingertips. If you wanted to know something, you had to go to the library and try to find the information in a book. If you were lucky, you had an encyclopedia set at home, but it would probably be many decades out of date.\n\nLink Colors\n\nLinks that jump to other places on this page are blue. Links that lead to other pages online are red.\n\nPage Table of Contents\n\nFor those who only want release dates and nothing else, the game entries are listed in the Page Table of Contents. This page also has an Index to help you find a specific game. There's also an Atari 2600 NTSC Game Index for 1977 to 1991.\n\nNot Set in Stone\n\nMost of the release dates below are not set in stone. Games will be moved as better information is found, so be sure to check back once in a while.\n\nBest Guess\n\nMany games are marked as a best guess. Some guesses are worse than others. Below is a list of the types of guesses that might be on this page.\n\nBest Guess (BG): At least one magazine or newsletter mentioned the month a game was released or supposed to be released or newspaper ads have been found.\n\nExtreme Best Guess (EBG): A vague mention of the release month in a magazine, newsletter, or newspaper.\n\nSuper Extreme Best Guess (SEBG): The Video Game Update newsletter only had a review for the game (no release month mentioned), so it's a semi-educated wild guess. The review could have happened the same month the game was released or the review could have been published a month or more later.\n\nDesperate Super Extreme Best Guess (DSEBG): There might be an ad in a magazine or newspaper to go on if we're lucky. It's a desperate semi-educated wild guess.\n\nGreen Check Mark ✔\n\nI signed up for the most expensive subscription option at Newspapers.com in November of 2020 so I could finally look up games for myself. As I find the earliest newspaper ads for a game, I'll add a green check mark for that entry to indicate that the definitive release date has probably been found for that game.\n\n≈ ✔ An almost equal symbol with a green check mark means that the game might have been available in some areas in the previous month. The entry is close enough.\n\n☹ ✔ A sad face with a green check mark means that I couldn't find any useful newspaper ads, but there is enough evidence showing that the entry probably belongs in that month.\n\n✳ A green eight spoked asterisk means that the entry might need to be moved if more information is found, but ads or news items suggest that the entry might be close enough to the correct month.\n\n??? Three orange question marks indicate that I searched the newspapers and couldn't find anything helpful, so a more accurate release date for that game still needs to be found.\n\nCopyright Date\n\nRemember, the date on the box, cartridge, manual, and copyright screen can be different from the actual release date. For example, Atari 2600 Pac-Man was released in March/April of 1982, but the box, cart, manual, and copyright screen have 1981 as the copyright date. It usually took around 6 months for a programmer to make an Atari VCS game back then and that’s not counting the time it took to make the manuals, boxes, and cartridges.\n\nYouTube and Beyond\n\nTo help make your experience more enjoyable, most items listed on this page have a link to related search results at YouTube (YT) where you can watch music videos, scenes from movies, or clips from TV shows. The movies and TV shows listed on this page also have links to web sites such as the Internet Movie Database (IMDb) and Wikipedia (WP).\n\nYou Can Help\n\nIf you find a mistake, or have more information to add, such as month/year release dates for games, please contact me. Every little bit of credible information helps, no matter how insignificant you think it might be.
