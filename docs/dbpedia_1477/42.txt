Educational series produced by Michigan State University in conjunction with 4-H. Not to be confused with the later comedy-drama series Mulligan's Stew.

Although only six episodes were produced, the series remained in syndication until at least 1981.

Remembered watching this in 5th grade in elementary school in Lansing, Michigan (I had no idea there were local connections); the class also received copies of the accompanying comic book. Saw Mulligan Stew one last time in 1979 (episode #5 only) when we lived in the Chicago suburb of Glenwood, Illinois; it aired on PBS affiliate WTTW, channel 11 in Chicago.

Sure wish this would be released on DVD.

I also understand the young actress who played Micki (or was it Maggie?) is, sadly, no longer with us.
