Lynn was born on January 19, 1941, in New Haven, CT to parents Gerald and Margaret (Bellemore) Keeley. She attended Hillhouse High School and graduated in 1958. After graduating high school, Lynn worked at Southern New England Telephone Company for many years. She married her husband Arnold Agnoli in 1965 and moved to Orange, CT to raise their children Mark, Danielle, and Jennifer. As her children grew older, Lynn joined Arnold in running their business, Tiles of Distinction (formerly Sullivan Tile). Lynn was a devoted wife and mother. She created a home that was always open and welcoming to family, friends, and neighbors. Everyone who knew Lynn loved her, and she was known for being kind, thoughtful, selfless, and an eternal optimist. Her love of nature inspired an interest in both birds and flowers, and she particularly enjoyed drives in the fall to see the leaves changing colors. Some of Lynn’s other interests included reading, visiting lighthouses, watching UCONN Huskies basketball games, and participating in football pools.\n\nWhen her children were young, she dedicated her time to volunteering in the schools, scouts, little league, and other family activities. Together with her husband Arnie, Lynn loved traveling to Cancun for annual beach vacations with close friends. She traveled several times to the Netherlands to visit Jen, and together they hold special memories of tulip fields and flower markets. She enjoyed music, often attending rock concerts with Mark. When Danielle’s children were little, Lynn had the pleasure of babysitting often and joining her and the kids on summer beach vacations. In her later years, nothing brought more joy to Lynn than spending time with her children and grandchildren. Lynn and Arnie were soulmates for over 60 years in a loving relationship that should inspire us all.\n\nLynn is preceded in death by her parents Gerald and Margaret and her brother Robert Keeley. She is survived by her husband Arnold Agnoli, children Mark Agnoli (Kay Mooney), Danielle Destival and Jennifer McMahon (Jerry), grandchildren Mia, Jack, Jude, Audrey, and Ella, and grandpuppies Ozzy and Mickey.

He established a host of unique programs and services that addressed the holistic needs of its patients. Under John’s leadership patients, medical staff, employees and importantly the community were imbued with a newfound pride in its hospital. As his greatest achievement, Griffin Hospital became an exemplar of a fully empowered and quality community hospital with a nationwide reputation for excellence.

He enjoyed boating, reading, cooking, working on home projects, loving his Retrievers, and spending holidays with dear extended family. He and his wife enjoyed entertaining family and friends at their lakeside home in Maine. Retirement allowed him and his wife to make numerous trips exploring Italy with dear friends from Milan acting as guides. Enjoyment also came from trips to France and exploring his roots in Spain. His loss is immeasurable but his compassion, zest for life, and the love, laughter, and beautiful memories he leaves behind will be missed by many whose lives he touched.\n\nVisitation will take place on Monday, October 16, 2023, from 10 – 11 a.m. at Our Lady of Assumption Church 81 Center Road Woodbridge, followed by a Mass of Christian Burial at 11 a.m. Interment will be in Mt.

He was born on May 2, 1946, in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, to the late Karl and Mary (Welteroth) Gramling.\n\nLawrence, known by those close to him as Larry or “Larf” (a nickname his grandmother MeeMo gave him), spent his childhood in the birthplace of Little League Baseball. He loved the sport from an early age and demonstrated a steel-trap memory for numbers and statistics. He started rooting for the Baltimore Orioles in the franchise’s inaugural season of 1954—Brooks Robinson became his favorite player shortly after the legendary third baseman made his big-league debut the following June. Larry and his brother Dave loved collecting baseball cards and attending 15-cent cowboy double features. Larry was a top scholar and extremely proud of his five-time inclusion on the annual list of top-10 newspaper boys in Williamsport, where he earned two cents per paper delivered. Always hard at work, Larry’s summer jobs as a teenager included driving a Mr. Softee ice cream truck and earning $1.50 per hour for his grandfather John’s roofing and sheet-metal company. Larry’s favorite holiday was Thanksgiving, especially the years it was spent with the Welteroth cousins Jim, Linda, Gary and Tommy.\n\nLarry served in the Army during the Vietnam War—the conflict ended before he was called to battle. After attending the University of Scranton, he received his MBA at Northeastern University (where he met his future wife Cathy) and earned his doctorate from the University of Maryland. He and his family moved in 1980 to the Connecticut town of Tolland; he cherished his job as an accounting professor at the University of Connecticut as much as he enjoyed coaching youth sports for dozens of his children’s teams. At UConn, he taught tens of thousands of students, who chose Dr. Gramling as the winner of eight annual Outstanding Accounting Professor Awards. He served as Associate Dean of Undergraduate Studies at the School of Business for six years before retiring in 2018. A Huskies basketball season ticket holder, the highlights of his in-person sports fandom included 1) seeing UConn win its first national championship in 1999 with his two oldest sons; 2) attending the Pittsburgh Steelers’ Super Bowl XL win with his two youngest sons and 3) cheering as his daughter competed at the NCAA level as Wheelock College’s starting point guard.\n\nArmed with an infectious personality, Larry was the life of most parties he attended. His loyal, honest, generous and caring nature led to him developing deep and meaningful relationships with so many of the people he adored—the most profound of those relationships was with his beloved Cathy from the time they met in 1968. He was strong, organized and determined while also knowing how to make people smile with his quick wit. He was also extremely charitable: In addition to donating his blood regularly and supporting his alma mater Scranton, Larry created a\n\nbaseball reminiscence program in Norwich for people with early-stage dementia. He and Cathy ran the volunteer Bingo games at Woodlake at Tolland Nursing and Rehabilitation Center for nearly two decades. Larry loved to golf, was an avid bowler (once bowled a 279) and visited his children and grandchildren every chance he got. Most of all, he cherished spending time with Cathy—on cruises to faraway places, on the back porch of their beachside home and everywhere in between.\n\nIn addition to his beloved wife Cathy, to whom he was married for 53 years, Larry is survived by five children Scott (Lisa), Brian (Anna), Gary (Elizabeth), Tim (Sara) and Amy (Laura) and his nine precious grandchildren Madelaine, Devin, Max, Jake, Caitlin, Jack, Vena, Colin and Theo; his love for them was boundless, and the memories they made with Grandpa will be forever treasured. Larry leaves behind his brother David (Jean) and was predeceased by his sister Kathleen.\n\nFriends and family may call from 1:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. on Saturday October 21, 2023, at the CODY-WHITE FUNERAL HOME, 107 BROAD STREET, MILFORD, CT. Interment will be private.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, memorial contributions may be made to the following charities:\n\n• The University of Connecticut’s Larry Gramling Accounting Scholarship Fund: https://www.foundation.uconn.edu/fund/larry-gramling-accounting-scholarship/\n\n• Camp Casco (free camp for children with cancer): https://www.campcasco.org/support\n\n• Smilow Cancer Hospital at Yale New Haven: http://www.yalecancercenter.org/gifts/\n\nTo leave online condolences, please visit our website at www.codywhitefuneralservice.com.\n\nCarol Ann Greco\n\nCarol Ann Greco, 83, of Milford, passed away on October 21, 2023. Born on April 12, 1940 in Coney Island, NY, she was the daughter of the late William and Hazel Moran.\n\nCarol leaves behind her daughter, Hazel (Daniel) Prestin; grandchildren, Michael and Amanda Ordazzo; and great grandchildren, Hazel and Kayleigh. She was predeceased by her husband, Michael Greco.\n\nCarol retired from Patchogue-Medford Schools where she worked for many years as a secretary. She made many wonderful friends there. Carol was at her happiest spending time with her family. Whether it was playing cards or scrabble, or going out for dinner, she so enjoyed every moment.\n\nA Graveside Service will be held on Saturday, November 11, 2023 at 11:00 a.m. at Saint Mary Cemetery, Buckingham Ave., Milford.
