        "text": "Crowl History, Family Crest & Coats of Arms\n\nOrigins Available:\n\nEngland\n\nIreland\n\nIrish names tend to vary widely in their spelling and overall form. The original Gaelic form of the name Crowl is \"O Cruadhlaoich.\" This is derived from the words \"cruadh,\" which means \"hard,\" and \"laoch,\" which means \"hero.\" 1\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Origins of the Crowl family\n\nThe surname Crowl was first found in Moylurg, in the County Roscommon, where they started as a branch of the MacDermots. It is from Teige, a Prince of Moylurg, down to Cruadhlaoch that the line of descent for the Crowleys begins. A junior branch of the Crowley family also emerged and moved to the area of Dunmanway, in the west of County Cork. They eventually became a distinct sept with their chief at Kilshallow, thriving while their parent family gradually withered. The majority of the Crowley family came to be found in the county of Cork, with three-quarters of the family being born there in modern times. 2\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly History of the Crowl family\n\nThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Crowl research. Another 119 words (8 lines of text) covering the years 1172, 1658, 1713, 1819 and 1857 are included under the topic Early Crowl History in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nLoading...\n\nCrowl Spelling Variations\n\nPeople who were accounted for by scribes and church officials often had their name recorded many different ways because pronunciation was the only guide those scribes and church officials had to go by. This resulted in the problem of one person's name being recorded under several different variations, creating the illusion of more than one person. Among the many spelling variations of the surname Crowl that are preserved in archival documents are Crowley, Crowly, O'Crowley, Croaley, Croawley, O'Crowly and many more.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Notables of the Crowl family\n\nNotable amongst the family name at this time was\n\nAmbrose Crowley II, a Quaker Blacksmith in Stourbridge but rose to become Sheriff of London\n\nCrowl Ranking\n\nIn the United States, the name Crowl is the 9,584th most popular surname with an estimated 2,487 people with that name. 3\n\nLoading...\n\nCrowl migration to the United States +\n\nIrish families left their homeland in astonishing numbers during the 19th century in search of a better life. Although individual reasons vary, most of these Irish families suffered from extreme poverty, lack of work opportunities, and exorbitant rents in their homeland. Many decided to travel to Australia or North America in the hopes of finding greater opportunities and land. The Irish immigrants that came to North America initially settled on the East Coast, often in major centers such as Boston or New York. But like the many other cultures to settle in North America, the Irish traveled to almost any region they felt held greater promise; as a result, many Irish with gold fever moved all the way out to the Pacific coast. Others before that time left for land along the St. Lawrence River and the Niagara Peninsula, or the Maritimes as United Empire Loyalists, for many Irish did choose to side with the English during the American War of Independence. The earliest wave of Irish migration, however, occurred during the Great Potato Famine of the 1840s.
