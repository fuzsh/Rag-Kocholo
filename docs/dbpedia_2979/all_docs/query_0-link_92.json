MAHALA LETT 23 April 1840 Jennings co, IN, Thought to be the daughter of Daniel Lett and Mariah Osborn, but who her mother is has not been proven yet. she was born 2o June 1821 KY died 25 November 1895 Winlock, Lewis County, Washington, and is buried in Winlock Cemetery Plot 37, 3 stone says: MAHAL LEWIS June 20 1821 Nov. 25 1895\n\nNote:\n\nTimothy B. Lewis was born in Steuben County, New York in 1819, he was brought by his parents to Indiana, where they located on State Creek in the southern part of Jennings County. Here Timothy was raised to manhood, assisting his father in farming. Being raised by pious parents and being a remarkably moral and steady young man, he early gave his heart to the Saviour. He united with the Coffee Creek Church where a few years later he was ordained to preach...in 1865 he sold his land and moved to Riley County, Kansas where he diligently pursued his ministerial calling, continuing in the work until a few weeks before his death which occurred in 1877.\n\nThis info on Timothy B Lewis is from Genforum.com from Sherri Abromavage in a reply: 2-12-2005\n\nCoffee Creek Baptist Church was organized at the home of Thomas Hill, on Coffee Creek, the first Saturday in May 1822, with the following as charter memers: Thomas Hill sr., Mary Hill, William Whitsitt, Nancy Blankenship, John Hopkins, Zilpha Hopkins, Nathan Robertson, Ann Robertson, Patsey Peoples, Nancy Johnson, Betsey Bennett, Betsey Burnett, Polly Roberts, Sally Scott, Ann McCroara, Ann Pritchard, Ann Wilkerson, Polly Hudson, Hannah, Earl and Susan Hill.\n\nThe council was composed of messengers from Union, Vernon, Harbert's Creek, White River, Scaffold, Lick and Graham Churches. Isaiah Blankenship was moderator and William C. Cranwell was Clerk. Immediately after the council adjourned, the church organized for business with Elder Thomas Hill, Sr. for moderator. At this first business meeting, Thomas Hill, Jr., united with the church and ws baptized the next day retaining his membership until his death in 1875.\n\nThomas Hill was the first pastor and served until 1838 when old age compelled him to resign. Thomas Hill Jr. was then called and served for nearly twenty eight years, his being the longest pastorate the church has ever had. Since that time, the church has had as pastors WILLIAM B LEWIS, T.B. LEWIS,, George, W.E. Speak, William Gillaspy, Alex Connerly, WILLIAM B LEWIS, again, Aleen Hill, J. M. McGuire, Lott Randolph, W.C. Golden, J.O Burroughs, B.T. Purviance, S.E. Hamilton, C. D. Stevens, Charles H. Overman, William H. Carson, A. J. Croy, C. T. Mitchell and the present pastor C. C. Thomas.\n\nThe church has ordained eight Ministers, Thomas Hill Jr., Zachariah Bush, J. W. Robinson, John Hill, Charles Snowden, WILLIAM B LEWIS, U. M. McGuire and B. P. Purviance.\n\nThe first building was a hewn log house built in 1822. In the fall of 1834 a brick church 30X34 feet was erected near the site of the old one. In July 1886, this bulding was torn down and removed to Paris Crossing and the present building was dedicated in July 1887. The church was repaired and rededicated in November 22nd 1908, during the pasturate of S. E. Hamiton.\n\nCoffee Creek Church was a member of the Silver Creek Association until 1827 when messengers from several of the churchs met and formed a new association called Coffee Creek, of which this church is known as the mother church. At this time the country was but sparsley settled and churches were widely separated. A mission was established on Neil's Creek and also at Six Mile, now Hayden. the Neil's Creek branch was discontinued after Lancaster Church was organized in 1859. First Marion was organized in 1849.\n\nMARION CHURCH:\n\nFROM THE HOOSIER JOURNAL OF ANCESTRY [a genealogical magazine]SPECIAL ISSUE ON JENNINGS CO IN THAT HAS [P 140] [EXTRACTING]:\n\nFirst Marion Church-organized at Marion schoolhouse, Marion Township, 26 April 1849.

Keith, and Eliza Keith [sister to Timothy B Lewis and William B Lewis]\n\nFirst Pastor-TIMOTHY B LEWIS who with his brother WILLIAM B LEWIS led the church for many years. Timothy was a typical exhorter and was quite popular with the young people. William was more solemn.\n\nFIRST MARION Constituted in April, 1849 A branch meeting, established first at Barnes' school house, afterward at Marion, was regularly attended by Elder Thomas Hill Jr., and later by WILLIAM B AND TIMOTHY B LEWIS. This branch was on the 26th of April, 1849, by delegates from the various churches of the vicinity, Elder John Chambers being presiding officer of the council, Elder J. B. Swincher Clerk.

LEWIS again, five years, and W.B. Lewis something more than two years. This was during the first years of the war, and the church, being in a low state and disheartened, had no pastor for about four years, when she rallied and had the services of George King, licentiate, one year, and Elder John Chambers one year, after which there was again a destitution of three years. During the latter part of this period, Elder Wm. Gillaspy preached for them a few times, and the church was so much revived that Elder Gillaspy was secured as pastor, continuing about five years, with grand success, the membership being raised from twenty-three to ninety-eight during his first year. It was during his pastorate that he present house was erected. Since then the church has had as pastors Elders W. B. LEWIS, one year; Allen Hill, three years; G. W. Thompson, two years and J.N. Spillman now about three years. DEACONS AND CLERKS: Woodford Barnes, R.H. Keith, David Smith, Enos tobias and e.J. Hughes have been the deacons.

Nellie Capitola lewis b. 21 Dec 1871 Stockdale, Riley Co, KS d. 15 Jan 1914 Stockdale, Riley Co, KS, after her mother died Nellie is found living with her grandmother Mahala Lett Lewis, Nellie was deaf anda relative Dr. Isaac Mayfield cared for her and she went to a school for the deaf,\n\nHer family lived on a farm near Stockdale, KS about 14 miles north of Manhattan on the Blue River. Her application for admittance to the Kansas School for the Deaf [Kansas Institution for the Education of the Deaf and Dumb] at Olathe was filled out on January 7, 1880. Nellie's first term at school was from September 14, 1881 to May 23, 1882, but no other terms were noted on the Pupil Record. The KSD representative found no record of her having graduated from the school. The Pupil's Record described her as a very bright and active above average, and perfectly healthy. It stated that no known relatives were deaf and that her deafness was probably congenital and definitely total and incurable. Nellie had been examined by a member of the Indianapolis Institute. The school records said she had had measles and whooping cough [after she was known to be deaf]. Other comments on the admission form were she had not been vaccinaged before going to school; she was rather bashful in the presence of strangers; her parents were \"not related in the least,\" her father was very poor; and she had never attended any institution. The Pupils' Record, page 219, further remarks that she was vaccinated for measles and whooping cough at the institution in Dec. 1881 and also on Feb. 23, 1889, she had no infirmities or peculiar habits, there was no \"consanguinity of parents\" [common ancestry]: her \"prcuniary circumstances\" were poor, and her only sibling was Charles Walter Lewis, born Sept. 12, 1873. Unfortunately, the personal description of her was not filled out. After her father [and brother?] left, her aunt, Mrs. Jennie [Virginia Mayfield, sister to her mother]Warner of Stockdale, KS replaced her father on the record. She was related to Dr. Mayfield, who may have kept her while she attended school for the deaf. Lewis County, Washington may be where her family settled. While ill with cancer, she was cared for by a \"Grandma\" Warner, who was probably her Aunt Jennie. She was buried in Grandview Cem. east of Riley, Kansas. When tuttle Creek Reservoir was built, the graves of Nellie Capitola [Cappie\" and her daughter Inez, were moved to Mill Creek Cem. on Fairview Cemetery Rd. This is north of Manhattan and a few miles south and west of present-day Randolph.\n\nNellie married Allen Delbert Nelson, son of John Nelson & Emile, he was b. 1878 IS died abt 1935 Calif., after Nellie died he went to Washington, he kicked the boys out after she died, he was a stone mason, he remarried and had another son named George.\n\nChildren are:\n\n1.

Kenneth D. Doyle\n\nObit: Kenneth D. Doyle, Editor, is Dead\n\nKansas City, Kans-Kenneth D. Doyle 74? Publisher of the Wamego Reporter, died Tuesday at University of Kansas Medical Center. He entered the hospital May 6. Doyle spent his entire career on the Wamego Weekly Newspaper. A printer since he was 12, he became Publisher in 1927. He was a Shriner, A Mason, A member of the Odd Fellows and the Woodsman of the World, and a charter member of the Wamego Fire Department. His survivors include five children, Gene ? Doyle & Esther Ann Doyle, Wamego; Maryella Doyle, Kansas City; Kimber K Doyle, Topeka; and Robert Doyle, White Bear Lake, Minnisota.\n\nChildren are:\n\n1. Gene Doyle\n\n2. Esther Ann Doyle\n\n3. Maryella Doyle\n\n4. Kimber K. Doyle\n\n5. Robert Doyle\n\nMy Cousin LoAnn Bonstein sent me a copy of this Paper Article in her possession: 5-21-2006:\n\nFROM THE POTTAWATOMIE GAZETTE, FEBRUARY 1868\n\nIn 1889 several papers consolidated into one. The were The Kansas Reporter, established in Louisville in 1867, The Kansas Agriculturist, established 1879, The Weekly Wamegan, established 1889, and the Daily Wamegan, established 1887. They became The Wamego Reporter, and a paper under this banner continued until August 1, 1958 when members of the K. D. Doyle family sold to H. O. Dendurent and it was consolidated with The Wamego Times.\n\nK. D. Doyle had joined veteran printer K. C. Smick in the 1890's as a printer's devil, and then co-owner until the death of Mr. Smick, when he became sole owner. Mr. Doyle was a talented newspaper man and involved most of his family and even other relatives in the business. The death of Mr. Doyle was a loss to the entire community.\n\nTHE WAMEGO REPORTER THURSDAY, JULY 31, 1958\n\n\"30\"\n\nWe wish to announce that the Wamego Reporter has been sold to Mr. and Mrs. H. O. Dendurent effective August 1, 1958. This is the last issue of The Reporter that will be published by the Doyle family. This. of course, was a difficult decision to make and was reached only after considerable deliberation. This newspaper has been in the Doyle family for 30 years. Also, since the 1890's when Dad started as a printer's \"devil,\" one or more Doyles have worked on this newspaper. It is not easy to give up an enterprise in which all of us have literally grown up. Some of us have given a large part of our lives to this paper. This is especially true of Esther and Gene in recent years. We sincerely hope that we have performed a service to this community during these years by reporting the news and calling attention to various civic matters. Where deemed necessary we have taken a stand and commented editorially on issues of importance. We feel sure that \"Hod\" will serve this community to the best of his ability. We want to take this opportunity to thank our customers for their loyal support and patronage over the years. This includes our many subscribers--for without them there would have been no need to publish a paper. As usual, this issue will be read in most of the 49 states and in several other countries, also. Of course we are grateful to our advertisers. Without them, no paper can long stay in business. Thanks, also, to you other customers--whether you bought a 10 cent piece of cardboard or thousands of sale bills or any other item. You all made it possible for us to stay in business these many years.\n\nNo matter where we wander, Wamego will always be \"home.\" As Dad used to say, \"Wamego may not be a City of the First Class, but it certainly is a first class city.\" And we agree. Thanks again to all of you, our friends and neighbors. May God bless each one of you. Esther Ann, MaryElla, Kimber, Gene, Robert.\n\n26\n\n7.

I think she was born in Brevard, North Carolina. When I was very young in the 1930's, I can remember visiting her in Portland, Oregon. Her son Garfield Orr Lewis, was my cousin, but near the same age as my father, they attended college together in Oregon. He was married and had one son Jack Lewis. 1939 my family went to the World's Fair Treasure Island San Francisco, we stayed at Garfield's house in Oakland, California. He was a Teacher at Castlemont High School in Oakland, California. His family visited my family in Oregon several times in the 1930s. When I was young. On the way home to Oregon from the Worlds Fair We visited Addie Orr Lewis in Oreleans, California which is on the Klamath River, where her husband , at that time, had a ranch. I think his name was Davis. Then later on during WWII, I was in the Navy in San Francisco, I visited and saw Garfield Lewis a couple of times. At that time, he had seperated from his wife, after WWII he visited my family a couple of times in Oregon. When my father died in 1949, my brother and mother and I visited Garfield Lewis in Berkley, Cal., at that time Addie was living with him. She was a very intelligent and noble woman. I did not ever know much about her husband, Lincoln Lewis, I don't know if he died or if they were divorced.\n\nI heard that Jack Lewis, Garfield's son, was a pilot during WWII then after the war, he and a friend had a sail boat and set out from San Francisco and never was heard from after that. Garfield I heard, remarried and died some place in Washington State. I heard that Addie Orr Lewis is buried in San Jose, California.\n\nBut as far as knowing anybody that could help you out more. You see, I am the youngest of that generation and I am 80 years old. I think most all of my cousins are dead that might have been able to help you. I think that Addie was married to a judge when she lived in Portland, then the husband in California was a railroad engineer. What I new of Addie is that she was a very smart and intelligent.\n\nDavid Orr\n\n24 Dec 2005\n\nThank you so much David for this insight on Addie Orr.\n\nFollowing Orr Family Info is from Family Treemaker Online, by Bert J Sitton\n\nhttp://familytreemaker.genealogy.com/users/s/i/t/Bert-J-Sitton/GENE7-0001.html\n\nJohn J Orr & Rachel Banks had:\n\n1.

C.....it is beautifully written on Confederate States of America stationary, with a picture of Jefferson Davis, \"Our First President\"... the following poem is printed at the top: Hark! how, on Northern blasts elate, The threats of Northmen come.... That Southern fields they'll devastate, And through the South make desolate, Each happy, cheerful home! A call is heard throughout the South.... Arm! Arm! for freedom and for truth! Manhood, arise! arise, ye youth! And for the aged leave room! Drive the invaders from our land. From out this glorious Southern land. Our fertile, genial Dixie! For freedom's cause take each his stand. For freedom and for Dixie! October 10, 1861. Camp Davis, Mitchell Sound, New Hanover County, N. C. Miss Julia A.

The land is poore and sandy it is bad drilling in the sand an dust Sweate potatoes is the cheafe produse hear. The long leafe pine is the principle timber Ther sediar is plenty too and some to spear I enjoyed my trip from Ashevill hear veary well, I roade on the carse about foure hundred miles and at the rate of twenty five miles an hour you know that this doin veary well.

Thease few lines which loks so solumn Was put hear to fill out the column. MARTIN J. ORR On the back of the foregoing letter he penned the following poem TO THE GIRLS I LEFT BEHIND ME I'm lonesom since I cross'd the hills, And oer the moor doth tire me; With heavy thoughts my mind doth filly Since first I pated Betsey. In search of some one fine and gay, Several doth remind me Of the Bless'd hours I passed away, With the girls I left behind me. The hours I do rember well, When reflection takes me, A pain within my brest I feel. Since first she ownd she lov'd me, But now I'm going to cross the sea, The heavens above may guide me, And send me safe home back againe, To the girls I left behind me. Her golden hair in ringlets fair, Her eyes like diamonds shining; Her slender waist her carriage chasten, Left me, poor swain, a paining, But let the night, be e'er so darke, Or e'er so wet and rainey, I will return safe back again, To the girls I left behind me. So when I'm standing on parade, Either asleep or wakeing, I long to see my love again, For her my heart is breaking, When I think of the vow of love, the tears do fall and blind me, When I think of the virtuous grace, Of the Girl I left behind me. Stand firmly by your cannon. Let your ? and grapeshot fly. Trust in God and Davis, But \"keep your powder dry.\" NOTE: This letter of MARTIN JASPER ORR was written when he was age 20 to MISS JULIA MACKEY (1835-1908) - who was age 25 at the time. Six years later MARTIN JASPER ORR married MARY JANE LYON, the daughter of James Clifford Lyon, and Matilda W. Glazener. And, after the death of of Matilda, James Clifford Lyon married as his 2nd wife, the recipient of this letter, JULIA MACKEY....she then became the step-mother-in-law of MARTIN JASPER ORR. Remembrances of Jasper Orr by Charles R. Allison (1911-1999) I remember a lot about growinï¿½ up in Brevard back then. Remember it all clear as a bell. I was born at the neighborï¿½s house on Groundhogï¿½s Day, at least thatï¿½s what they call it nowadays, in 1911. It was a lot livelier then than it is now. You see, all these people all shut up in their cars flyinï¿½ by used to be out walking in the streets or riding in their carriages. You hardly ever saw a car, and when you did, it was an open T Model and drivinï¿½ along slow enough to wave and holler at everybody walkinï¿½ or sittinï¿½ on the porch. Everbody knew everbody else back then. That was good as long as you didnï¿½t have no private business you wanted to keep private. I grew up on what was the edge of town back then, what we called the ï¿½Oak Groveï¿½ part of Brevard because Oak Grove Church was just down the road where just about everybody around us went to church. All the Allisons and Siniards went there to church, plus a lot of Orrs. Grandpa Allisonï¿½s oldest brother, Alexander, gave the people the land to build that little church out of his farm. Fore that, they say they had a camp meetinï¿½ ground with tents on my great-granddaddy Wilsonï¿½s land up the hill. Grandaddy said the Union troops burned the meetinï¿½ tents all up when they came through town. I wish Mama and Daddyï¿½s house was still there so I could see it again one more time. You drive by that Imperial Motor Lodge motel today and youï¿½d never know that was my home. Wish we hadn't a sold that property. Thatï¿½s where I grew up, where Daddy died when I was only 4 and where Moma finally died so long after. Only sign is them big fir trees out front. I planted them for Mama when I was a little boy. We hiked up in the mountains to what folks called Frying Pan Gap, then on up around Mt, Pisgah. I brought them saplinï¿½ trees down in a tow sack. Hope the motel never cuts my trees down. Planted the maple tress behind the motel on Chestnut Street for Mama, too. She loved them maples come October. They was all colored out so pretty the day Mama died. It was October 24, 1945. There wasnï¿½t hardly anybody within several miles who wasnï¿½t my kin somehow. The Siniards all lived across the road from us ï¿½cause Great-Grandpa Samuel Wilsonï¿½s property got divided up between his two daughters. One got one side of the road, the other got the other side. My Grandma was his daughter Elizabeth. She married Grandpa Elijah Allison. ï¿½Preacher Allisonï¿½ is what a lot of people called him. Grandma Allisonï¿½s sister, Margaret, married old L.G. Siniard. Thatï¿½s why all of them Siniardï¿½s was my cousins. The road by our house used to be called the Boylston Road, but now they all call it the Asheville Highway. Guess the Yankee imports werenï¿½t happy with that either, but it still runs through Boylston just like it always did. The Boylston Road was just about the busiest road around those parts when I was coming up. It ran past the house and then on right up Jailhouse Hill to the courthouse and uptown. Everbody was a cominï¿½ and a goinï¿½ on the Boylston road. The one thing Iï¿½ll never forget about growinï¿½ up there was Old Man Jasper Orr. Nobody who ever heard him on Sunday mornings will ever forget him. But I guess there ainï¿½t many of us left anymore who remember that far back. Soon Iï¿½m gonna be gone and then ainï¿½t gonna be nobody left to remember any of it. Jasper was a character ï¿½ a good one though! Everbody loved Jasper Orr. He loved ever kid in Brevard and we all worshipped the ground he walked on. I guess because he knew my daddy had died and left Mama with a house full of us children and no way to earn a living at first, he was extra nice to us. When heï¿½d come walking by with his long snow-white beard blowinï¿½ in the breeze and heï¿½d shout up the hill to Mama ï¿½Miss Julia, you send them younguns down here to give me some sweet sugar!ï¿½. Weï¿½d run down the hill and give him a hug cause we knew what he had in his pocket ï¿½ peppermint candy sticks! His white beard tickled my face and made me giggle. For a new widow with four children under 10, Mama didnï¿½t have much money for things like candy. We were poor for a while and Mama cried a lot until she got her business going and could earn a living. Mama told me that all the family helped out. She also told me that one day she heard the dog barking and by the time she got to the door, there wasnï¿½t nobody there, but there was a big basket with a ham and a mess of greens and lots and lots of other stuff ï¿½ enough to fed a family for a week! And there was a folded up piece of paper Moma opened and inside was ten dollars. That was a lot more money back then. She looked and saw Jasper Orr rushing off, walkinï¿½ quick like. She knew it was him that did it. But he never would ï¿½fess up to it. Mama told me later that Jasper just told her ï¿½Miss Julia, you done run into your own angel! Everythingï¿½s gonna be O.K.ï¿½ She used to find such presents on the door from time to time, including money folded up in paper. I think Jasper was her angel. Jasper Orr was the life of Oak Grove Church. Jasper was an old, old man when I was a little boy cominï¿½ up, but he led the singinï¿½ -- taught singinï¿½ even. He sang something just about ever Sunday. He used to throw his head back with that white beard a-flying and look up at heaven and sing his old heart out. Mama used to laugh and joke that Jasper had too much fun in church for a good Methodist. They thought he was gonna start ï¿½shoutinï¿½ in the spiritï¿½ any minute sometimes when he was a singinï¿½ and gettinï¿½ happy. The thing about Jasper that always jumps out in my mind is his ever Sunday ritual. He was our alarm clock on Sunday morning. Fact is, he woke everbody in Brevard up! But of course nobody minded it ï¿½cept the drunks that was sleepinï¿½ off Saturday night. Jasper was in the Civil War when he was not much more than a boy. He learned to play the drum in the Confederate Arny. And he played it almost till the day he died. Old Jasper was a ratta-tat-tattinï¿½ goinï¿½ through the gates! Jasper believed that ever child had to go to church and he made sure they did! As well as a few grownups. On Sunday mornings, Jasper would get his drum and start over near Jack Tranthamï¿½s place. Heï¿½d start out early in the morninï¿½ headinï¿½ for town and then work his way back in time for church at Oak Grove. Iï¿½ll never forget the sounds of Jasper cominï¿½ up the road! Heï¿½d ratta-tat-tat for a while and then he start singinï¿½ his heart out. ï¿½All aboard for Sunday school children, all aboard! The good ship of Zion is gettingï¿½ ready to sail! All aboard for Sunday School!ï¿½ And theyï¿½d follow him! By the time he went up town and was headinï¿½ back, heï¿½d have children following him down the Boylston Road like the Pied Piper. And Iï¿½d be dressed and ready for Jasper when he came back. Mama would send us all down the hill, ready and waitinï¿½. Peopleï¿½d swear you was crazy if that happened in Brevard today, but we thought that was the grandest thing. Long before I decided I wanted your Mama, she was this skinny little thing playinï¿½ the piano at church ever Sunday. She musta started playing the piano at Oak Grove Church before she was even 12. She used to play for Jasper to sing his solos on Sunday. It did his heart good to sing to the heavens. The Boilston Road got quiet and sad when Jasper got too old and sick to make his rounds. But he died old and happy, so I guess it was all O.K. for him. I remember us all going to his funeral. People came from ever where. Half the people couldnï¿½t even get in the church. That hilltop was covered in folks when they laid him down to rest. He had a lot of kin and a lot of friends. I wonï¿½t ever forget Jasper Orr. Mama didnï¿½t forget him either. Ever time the lilac bush bloomed, sheï¿½d pick an armful of blossoms and weï¿½d walk up the road to the church to put on Daddyï¿½s and Granddaddyï¿½s graves. She always saved some of the lilacs for Jasper. Said she had to remember her angel, too. Go and get me Mary Janeï¿½s book she wrote. Thereï¿½s a picture of Jasper in it. I like to see that picture ï¿½ makes me remember things. From the French Broad Hustler, April 26, 1899 BREVARD MAN IN DANGER While upon attendance at the presbytery at Mills River last week, Mr. Martin Jasper Orr of North Brevard, narrowly escaped a very serious accident. His team became frightened on King's Bridge and were for a short while uncontrolable. The vehicle was almost capsized and its occupants thrown overboard into the stream below. But with the exercise of cool judgement and judicious management all escaped with only some painful bruises, but frightened almost out of their wits. The Misses Summey, of rugby, were among the number. More serious results might have followed by for the timely assistance of some farmers who happened to be near. Another result was an exchange of horses between Mr. Orr and one of the rescuing farmers and the former can now drive with more satisfaction. The skittish animal is gone. The Times-News, Hendersonville, N. C., March 31, 1931 M. J. ORR, 90, LAID TO REST Brevard Man Had Never Lived Outside Transylvania County BREVARD, Mar. 31, - (Special) Funeral services for M.

He was born March 1, 1875 at Mills River in Henderson County, NC. His marriage of December 6, 1899 to Hattie Lee Gillespie was one of many marriages between the families of the Sitton iron makers and the Gillespie rifle makers. They were third cousins. They were both active members of the Mills River Baptist Church of which their ancestors were charter members when it was organized in 1835. This church has been the site of many Sitton-Gillespie baptisms, weddings and funerals. As a boy, Willie liked playing with tools and used a hatchet belonging to his father to hack theleg of a table which Silas Craton had made. This brought Willia thrashing by his father. The table is in the home of Howard Sitton. Before her marriage, Hattie Gillespie was employed by a family of Lockwood's in Baltimore. She accompanied this family on a summer trip tot he Hudson River area and Fondly spoke of going on a boat trip down the Hudson. Willie followed the trade of his father, the operator of saw mills. He was also a very competent carpenter and at one time served at the George Vamderblt estate as a watchman. Willie and Hattie Lee had nine children, one died as an infant and one died at the age of 14. In the 1920's the Sitton family had one of the few tennis courts that could be found in the county. It was here that their children and their friends played the game of tennis. One of their sons, Willie Michael Jr, still played a good game of tennis when in his 70's. Willie died Mar 21, 1951 and Hattie Lee died April 1, 1965. Both are buried in the Sitton-Gillespie Cemetery at Mills River.\n\nEXCERPTS FROM AN ARTICLE IN THE \"HENDERSON COUNTY HERITAGE BOOK\" Vol I, by Lucy Gilliam Sitton.

C., FRIDAY NOVEMBER 19, 1948 Gillespie Shooting Is Ruled Suicide South Mills River Resident Found Dead Near Home HENDERSONVILLE - The death of Henry Gillespie, 66, a resident and farmer of the South Mills River section who was found dead from a shotgun wound about 8:10 a.m. Thursday on a bridge about one-half mile from his home, was declared a suicide by Coroner Bruce A. Cox, who said no inquest would be had. Coroner Cox made suicide the official verdict after investigation and the finding of a note in the kitchen of the deceased. The note, written in ink on a small tablet, said: \"Good by Myrtle, Ed and family. Please forgive me.\" The handwriting of the note was identified as that of the deceased by Ed Gillespie, a nephew, Mack Gillespie, a great nephew, and Deputy S. S. Whitaker, a resident of the neighborhood. The finding of the body on the bridge over the South Fork of Mills River on |South Mills River Road between the home of the deceased and the nephew, Ed, had started a wide investigation due to the fact that the elder Gillespie had had trouble with hunters on his property about two weeks ago. At that time, according to Deputy Whitaker, Gillespie ordered night hunters off his property and shots were exchanged. Later a rifle shot was fired into the Gillespie home. It was because of the hunting incident that members of the family had been staying with Mr. Gillespie, a bachelor, overnight. The great-nephew, Mack, said he stayed with Mr. Gillespie last night. During the night, he said, they thought they heard someone on the porch of the home but found no one on investigation. Mack said he left shortly after daylight this morning. The body was found by Miss Cora Bells Gillespie, a great-niece of the deceased, as she started to Hendersonville on South Mills River Road. Her father, Ed, said he crossed the bridge about 8 a.m. and the body was not there at that time. A school bus had also crossed the bridge about 8 a.m. Apparently the last person to see Mr. Gillespie alive was Mrs. Charles Sitton, whose home is between that of the deceased and the river. She said that he stopped there and gave her $10 which he had promised as a Thanksgiving orphanage contribution. She said she watched him as he walked toward the river and about 8:15 a. m. heard what she thought was a single shot. Mr. Gillespie was shot in the head and both barrels of the shotgun found nearby had been discharged. He was identified as the owner of the weapon. The suicide note was found by Corporal E. B. Quinn and James Kuykendall of the state highway patrol, Deputy Whitaker and the relatives, Ed and Mack. Funeral services will be conducted Friday at 3 p.m. at Sycamore Baptist Church by the Rev. W. E. Rufty and burial will be in Gillespie Cemetery with nephews as pallbearers. Surviving are three sisters, Mrs. W. M. Sitton and Mrs. W. E. Field of Mills River and Mrs. C. N. Allen of Dana; a brother, George Gillespie of Mills River; and a number of nieces and nephews.\n\n6. Perry Patterson Orr b. 30 Sept 1849 Transylvania Co, N.C. d. 8 Oct 1928 Transylvania Co, N.C. m.

For some time she had been in ill health, her condition becoming serious a few weeks ago. Born and reared in Transylvania County, N.C., she was a daughter of the late Archibald and Eliza Orr Aiken, both natives of North Carolina. Her husband, who died some years ago, was a physician and at one time was engaged in the practive of his profession in Greenville where the family lived for a period of 20 years. In recent years, Mrs. Case had been living with her children. She was a member of Beulah Baptist Church.\n\nDOCTOR CASE\n\nMany years ago, so long ago that few remember except what they have been told by the old ones, there lived in the Horse Shoe area of Henderson County the only doctor in the entire section. JOHN KNOX STIMPSON CASE was his name, but no one remembers his full name now. By some, he was addressed by his proper title, Dr. Case; but to most of the young and the old he was Doc. Case and as the years went by he was referred to by nearly everybody as \"Old Doc.\" Highly respected and deeply beloved by the entire country side, Dr. Case administered to the sick and injured; people and animals alike. There were no drug stores or pharmacies in his day as there are now. Here and there was an occasional store that was referred to as an apothecary shop, dispensing the few drugs and medicines that were available. Doctor Case brewed and concocted his own medicines and remedies from the native herbs found in our mountains. Many of the barks, roots and leaves he gathered himself or he bought them from his neighbors. Regardless of the weather, whatever the time of day or night; whether his patient was man, woman, child or animal, Dr. Case when he was called always answered that appeal. Sometimes in a buggy but generally traveling on horseback, he carried his instruments and medicines in his saddle bags. No distance was too far for him to travel to help the sick and injured. No ridge was too steep and rocky and no cove was too isolated; if that was where the doctor was needed, that was where he went. All of this was that period of years between 1850 and 1880. It was late one evening of an early autumn day. There had already been a touch of frost in the air for several days and the deep fall coloring was beginning to paint the foliage on the hillsides. The doctor in his stocking feet was relaxed before the brightly burning hearth fire in the \"lean to\" of his log house, the lean to that he used as his office and drug store. He reached over the table and took a long swig from the small earthen jug that always rested within reach of his rocking chair. The day had been a long, hard one, more so than usual, and he smacked his lips in appreciation then he put the corn cob stopper back in the jug. It was the end of another exhausting day in the saddle calling on his many widely scattered patients. \"I'm not as young as I use to be,\" was the thought in his mind as he again leaned back in his chair and stretched his feet to the fire. Just then the door was unceremoniously flung open and a hatless, barefoot, teenage boy burst into the old doctor's office. \"Dr. Case! Dr. Case!\" the breathless boy managed to utter, \"Pa's in a bad way, awful bad! He wants you to come at once! I set out at daybreak before sun-up and I've run all the way, all the way from CRAB CREEK to fetch ye!\" \"Now you just go out to the barn and feed my horse while I russle up a bite to eat,\" the old doctor replied. Tired and worn out as he was, he had never refused when summoned and now was no time to start. It was quite a distance from HORSE SHOE across the mountain to CRAB CREEK. By the time he had eaten a bite and was in the saddle the shadows had begun to lengthen. When Doctor Case reached the small stream that ran across the rough and lonely road that we know today as the BIG WILLOW ROAD, his horse stopped and the doctor loosened the rope reins to give it a chance to drink. The animal lowered its head and took several swallows of the clear, cool water. Then without warning and for no visible reason, as far as the old Doctor could see, the horse suddenly jerked its head high and with its ears pointed forward, gave a loud snort which was followed by a shrill neigh as the horse leaped across the branch. It happened so unexpectedly that the rider was nearly thrown. Telling about it later, the old doctor swore that at the same time the horse jumped he felt the arms of a woman go around his waist as he caught the illusive fragrance of perfume. The horse broke into a headlong gallop and Dr. Case was struggling with all his strength to get the animal under control. Out of the corner of his eyes, he told later, that he could see the creature was dressed in a flimsy white gown and her long stringy hair was streaming behind as the horse plunged ahead. The old man was not superstitious and he had seen many strange things over the years as he traveled the lonely mountain roads visiting his patients. Woman or Devil! He could feel her arms tighten around him but when he tried to pull her hands apart there was nothing to pull. \"Why, it was just like a body trying to take holt of a moon beam or a streak of light!\" he said when telling about it. \"I was beginning to get a mite scared too, what with that wild hag of a witch breathing down my neck and that fool horse in a dead gallop!\" When he finally managed to bring his horse to a stop, the animal stood in the middle of the road, legs wide apart, breathing heavily, sweat dripping from his body. The apparition in the filmy while gown quickly seemed to slip to the ground and vanished without a sound. The horse had galloped from the nameless stream to the foot of the mountain at the JESSE SENTELLE place. The old doctor, when telling of his experience afterwards, said that he had never in all of his life had such a thing happen to him although his practice of medicine had taken him to strange places where he had seen unusual things. Muttering and mumbling to himself and his horse, he continued his journey, treated his patient and started back to HORSE SHOE. Just as he reached the same stream of water where the apparition had suddenly mounted his horse, the same white clothed figure stepped out of the bushes and took his horse by the bridle. The doctor, now bone weary and sleepy, was in no mood for tricks. He quickly dismounted to see what was going on and that figure simply vanished again. Afterwards, when he told about the night's experience at the unnamed branch that flowed across the BIG WILLOW ROAD, people "
