Missing.-Officers, 15;\n\nothers, 55. Wounded.-Officers, 235; others,\n\n4,021. From these figures, however, the\n\nnew list subtracts one officer who is slightly\n\nwounded, not missing. The list gives\n\ntotal of 340 of all ranks, \"65 killed in action,\n\n7 died of wounds, 260 wounded, 4 danger-\n\nously ill, 1 Bligh Hy woundeel, 2 died of\n\ngneumonin, and 1 from accident.

C. M. MATHISON.\n\nCaptain G. C. M, Mathison, who died of\n\nwounds on May 21, was the most promis-\n\ning and most valuable of our younger medi-\n\ncal men. He was educated at his late\n\nfather's school, and at the University was\n\na student of Queen's College, where he\n\ncompleted his medical course with high dis-\n\ntinction. He then filled the positions of\n\nresident medical officer at the Melbourne\n\nHospital, demonstrator in physiology at the\n\nMelbourne University, and medical tutor\n\nat Ormond College. He went to London\n\ntwo years after graduating, and, by the\n\nexcellence of his research work, soon\n\ngained a prominent place among physi-\n\nologists. He was Sharpey scholar at Uni-\n\nversity College, London, and was awarded\n\nthe degree of doctor of science in the Lon-\n\ndon University. Two years ago Dr. Mathi-\n\nson was offered a professorship at Singa-\n\npore, but he preferred to return to his\n\nown city to the position of sub-director of\n\npathology at the Melbourne Hospital. Dur-\n\ning his absence at the war he was appointed\n\ndirector of the Hall Institute for Medical\n\nResearch, a position in which it was justly\n\nanticipated he would be of the greatest\n\nvalue in linking the clinical and scientific\n\nspheres of medicine. In London he was\n\nregarded as one of the most brilliant of\n\nthe younger scientists. Captain Mathison\n\nwas a man of singular personal charm and\n\nremarkable vivacity of mind and spirit.\n\nHe was one of the most widely-interested\n\nand widely-interesting of men, and his\n\nbrightness of wit and temperament made\n\nhis company a never-failing joy. The loss\n\nof such a man is, to the medical world, al-\n\nmost, and to his friends quite, irreparable.\n\nCaptain Mathison was the son of Mrs. Mary\n\nMathison, of Aroona, Ebden street, Elstern-\n\nwick.\n\nLIEUTENANT G.
