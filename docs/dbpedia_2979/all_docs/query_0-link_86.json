Unfortunately, the church is closed: the vicar has forgotten about the party, no one has bothered to turn up and, in a sublime rendition of bardic demythologising, Shakespeare is reduced to kicking at the doors and battering at a window in an attempt to gain entrance. The dramatist’s inability to make a connection with his renowned place of nativity is part of a comic collision between what Shakespeare has come to signify (the commodified rhetoric of the industry) and the ‘reality’ of an early modern writer revealed as an embarrassing and confused unsophisticate. Certainly, many at the turn of the twentieth century would lend their voices to this debunking assessment. Writing in 1999, Gary Taylor contended that ‘Shakespeare’s reputation . . . has passed its peak of expansion, and begun to decline’, resulting in a diminution of the Bard’s ‘cultural authority’.2 Richard Burt, surveying the field in 2000, goes one step further, arguing for ‘the end of the Shakespearean’ or what he terms ‘the Shakespeare apocalypse’.3 Lending some support to these views is the smaller number of major Shakespeare films produced in the immediate post-2000 period. If the 1990s represented the heyday of the Bard’s screen revival, the ‘noughties’ have thus far been marked by a less voluminous, or at least less obvious, corpus of screen ‘Shakespeares’. Yet, as Shakespeare’s Happy Endings also attests, the Bard’s name is still one to conjure with; his works continue to reverberate; and the plays persist as repositories of lore and tradition even as they are reworked as salient signifiers of meaning and knowledge.\n\n2 Mark Thornton Burnett and Ramona Wray A brief look at the International Movie Data Base confirms this, with some seventy-six ‘Shakespearean’ titles being listed between 2000 and 2005 as either in production or having already been released.4 Some of these retain the familiar contours of the multiplex-oriented, star-encrusted feature; others take the form of the so-called ‘spin-off’ or appropriation, and it is in part towards an appraisal of such varieties and versions of Shakespeare that the current collection is directed. Shakespeare, in the post-2000 period, moves among and between a range of screen incarnations, which encompass adaptations, documentaries, cinema advertisements, post-colonial reinventions and mass media citations, and which test the boundaries of conventional idioms and mediums. Typical of that twenty-first-century realisation of a screen Shakespeare is an advertising campaign launched by the H&M fashion empire in late 2005. ‘Romeo and Juliet’ by David Lachapelle, a six-minute film, constitutes a loose rehearsal of Shakespeare’s play and is aired both in cinemas and as a playable clip on the H&M website.5 Unfolding in an urban, US environment, the film privileges the fetching attire and appearance of the two leads, Juliet (Tamyra Gray) and Romeo (Gus Carr), mediating its vision of a millennial romance via encrypted reference to a Shakespearean textual authority. Crucial here are the glimpse of the graffiti-sprayed name of ‘Paris’, which indexes the ‘original’, the image of Juliet on a fire-escape substituting for the balcony, and the reflection in a window of a billboard announcing a film entitled The Lady Doth Protest.6 These invocations of a not simply circumscribed ‘Shakespearean’ represent the authenticating rationale for the film, the culture of conjuration and pastiche within which ‘Romeo and Juliet’ by David Lachapelle affirms its particular logic. And, as the urban environment reveals itself as New York, a further summoning of the Shakespearean comes into view, with West Side Story (dir. Robert Wise and Jerome Robbins, 1961), itself a revisiting of Romeo and Juliet, being instanced as another inner-city parable that takes the play into modernity. This Romeo and Juliet is acutely responsive to, and self-conscious about, the ‘sources’ of its own existence and the histories of revision that intercede in, and give shape to, its imaginative possibility. Both the ghostly background of West Side Story and the titular presence of the fictional Shakespeare film The Lady Doth Protest suggest that in ‘Romeo and Juliet’ by David Lachapelle the screen pasts of Shakespeare are a function of his current comprehensibility; that is, the ways in which the Bard has been packaged and transmuted through film are the precondition for the work’s accessibility and applications, however displaced they might be from their early modern contexts and associations. What\n\nIntroduction 3 transpires in the wake of the authorial, material Shakespeare becomes the conceptual template whereby the play is made familiar. Hence, it is peculiarly apposite that the film should make a point of consistently invoking other Shakespeare and Shakespeare-related screen outings. The emphasis on fashion – in this case, jeans – is of a piece with the film’s reminder of the lineage of Shakespeare’s popular culture visibility. The opening menu, for instance, discovers Romeo and Juliet standing against a graffiti-sprayed image of a flaming rose: at once, the composition harks back to the panoply of interrelated flaming hearts and logos deployed in Baz Luhrmann’s William Shakespeare’s ‘Romeo Juliet’ (1996), thereby elaborating a context in which it is the icon rather than the word that is prioritised. The Luhrmann film is instanced again in the sequence showing the heroine as a descending angel (an allusion to the appearance of Claire Danes as a Botticelli-inspired angel during the party-masque), while Michael Almereyda’s Hamlet (2000) lurks behind the fleeting capture of a photo montage adorning the walls of Juliet’s bedroom. Films already inscribed with the market stamp of youth culture and urban angst lend their reputations to Lachapelle’s advertising utterance, pointing up a modality of articulation and reception in which Shakespeare is ‘hip’ and in which an affiliation with the Bard is as cool and current as the acquisition of the latest designer label. Interestingly, where West Side Story and William Shakespeare’s ‘Romeo Juliet’ privilege urban life as an ethnic war zone involving, respectively, Puerto Rican and Polish American youth, and Anglo and Latino rival groupings, ‘Romeo and Juliet’ by David Lachapelle subscribes to a vaguely and ambiguously racialised constituency that belies any straightforward identification. Described on the H&M website as a ‘true icon’ who ‘appeals to a wide range of ages and ethnicities’, Gus Carr (Romeo) might be characterised as Asian or Latino or a combination of the two; similarly, although black, Tamyra Gray (Juliet) inhabits the aesthetically whitened extreme of the Afro-American experience. Ethnic specificity is not the point; instead, it is the notion of a free-floating and cross-cultural ethnicity defined by transatlantic parameters that ‘Romeo and Juliet’ by David Lachapelle asks its audience to countenance. In this connection, the film brings to mind what Mary C. Beltrán has described as the ‘new Hollywood racelessness’: in action movies such as Romeo Must Die (dir. Andrzej Bartkowiak, 2000) and The Fast and the Furious (dir. Rob Cohen, 2001), she argues, ‘mixedrace individuals’ who nevertheless subscribe to a ‘white ethos’ embrace ‘identities that are achieved through the . . . sharing of music, fashion and cultural forms . . . rather than by [an acceptance of] former\n\n4 Mark Thornton Burnett and Ramona Wray ethnic . . . allegiances and in-group prejudices’.7 Such a vision of ‘cultural métissage’, to adopt a formulation of Ronald Niezen, is, as Beltrán goes on to suggest, a reflection of ‘contemporary shifts in US demographics’ as well as ‘concerns regarding . . . the nation’s burgeoning . . . creolization’.8 ‘Romeo and Juliet’ by David Lachapelle models itself along the lines of these ‘raceless’ narratives: devotion to a product, if only briefly, is seen to be preferable to absorption in a community, and expectations about conflict are resolved in the spectacle of an ethnically diluted, and accessory-driven, homogeneity. On the one hand, a ‘raceless’ Romeo and Juliet would seem to lend credence to notions about Shakespearean universality as it is mediated through the mechanisms and accompaniments that characterise film in its post-millennial manifestations. Thus, the Lachapelle film features a soundtrack of two songs, one of which, ‘When I First Saw You’, is performed by Mary J. Blige. This ‘confessional singer’, the website informs us, is possessed of ‘an inner strength’ and ‘raw honesty [that are] used to tackle . . . personal pain, [so that her] uncompromising recordings reveal the universality of [her] heartaches and demonstrate the healing power of music’. Arresting here is the implied juxtaposition of the singer and the heroine, to the extent that this Romeo and Juliet becomes, in some senses, Juliet’s story or, at least, her attempt at the articulation of suffering and psychological reparation. But more striking is the idea that the confessional form, because it rests upon a Shakespearean ‘original’, is listened to over and above the confines of the film’s New York locations. Emerging from the construction of a narrative free of clearly demarcated ethnic markings is the representation of a personal journey that achieves a transcendently communicative efficacity. The song relies for its presumed effect upon Shakespeare, and Shakespeare is the guarantor of its ‘soulful’ appeal. On the other hand, to argue for a ‘universal’ Romeo and Juliet is to ignore the details of any film’s political and ideological underpinnings.‘Romeo and Juliet’ by David Lachapelle is no exception to this rule for, as much as the film gestures towards a whitened value system that traverses the restrictions of place and history, so does it betray both the structures of thought that lend its conceptions shape and the larger contemporary contexts that inform its mindset. Originally a clothing outlet founded in Stockholm in 1947, H&M has subsequently grown into a worldwide consortium, with stores in over twenty countries across the US, Canada and Europe. New York’s flagship H&M store opened in 2005 with a timeliness that, given the Lachapelle film, cannot have been unintended. For all of its Swedish antecedents, then, H&M is a fashion\n\nIntroduction 5 empire distinguished by a global frame of reference and, as we will see, by particularly American representational methods and interpretive tendencies. For example, Tamyra Gray, who both plays Juliet and performs the other song on the soundtrack, ‘And I Am Telling You I’m Not Going’, is a former near-miss winner of American Idol, the syndicated pop contestant show that has recently entered its fifth season on the Fox television channel. Part of a global export network, American Idol testifies to the competitive cult of manufactured celebrity that characterises the US in the twenty-first century even as it expresses an illusion of traditions of meritocracy that contributed to the nation’s ideological complexion. Perhaps the most revealing moment of ‘And I Am Telling You I’m Not Going’ comes when, in a seemingly innocuous diegetic detail, the song lyrics interact with the filmic image. Previously, Romeo’s killer is identified as a gunman who, from a passing car, unaccountably aims a fatal shot at the hapless lover. Because the killer is hooded, and the audience is granted only a brief glimpse of his eyes, a parallel is afforded with the infamous Carl Juste photograph ‘Mask’ (1994), which shows an anonymous hooded Haitian migrant detained at the US military base at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba.9 The reminder of ‘Mask’ encourages further identifications, not least with constructions of Muslim and/or Islamic extremists: the stereotype of the lone, crazed assassin has in the US, in particular, acquired a fearful currency. The point is that this does not connote the ethnic gang disputes of the ghetto or, indeed, of previous film versions of Romeo and Juliet; rather, the hero’s death is symptomatic of the attitudes informing American foreign policy, and participates in what Ken Booth and Tim Dunne have termed elsewhere ‘a global war against terrorism’.10 Crucially, the gunman appears as a black ‘other’: his is the film’s most conventionally ethnicised appearance. Yet, towards the end, another view of the – now police-escorted – killer is granted. The hood is pulled back and the countenance is repentant as the lines from the Tamyra Gray song sound: ‘We’re part of the same place, / We’re part of the same time, / We will share the same love, / We both share the same mind’. Ostensibly, the ‘we’ are the star-crossed lovers themselves; however, judged alongside such fundamentalist rhetoric of identicalness, ‘we’ simultaneously signals the bornagain spirit of US patriotism. The moral conversion of Romeo’s murderer makes sense inside this framework, the assumption being that the American people, regardless of ethnic affiliation, share a common goal and must band together against the outsider. At a deeper remove, the assassin’s repentance, and the suggestion that he has already been punished, justifies the aggressive military tactics of the Bush administration. In the post 9/11 moment, there can be no differences, only unity: racial alterity is absorbed\n\n6 Mark Thornton Burnett and Ramona Wray or incorporated, and ‘racelessness’ comes to serve a politically expedient purpose. The quotation from The Merchant of Venice – ‘I will buy with you, sell with you, talk with you’ – that adorns a shop awning is in keeping with this orientation, suggesting, as it does, fraternisation rather than rejection, intercourse rather than ostracisation.11 But, in a rare instance of ironic counterpoint, the Shylock citation also works against itself, alluding to earlier US relations with Iraq, a history of trade in armaments, and a complicity in the engendering and perpetuation of authoritarian regimes. ‘Romeo and Juliet’ by David Lachapelle styles itself to rehearse the concerns of a world in which US attitudes and actions are often dominant, at the same time as it dispassionately withdraws from the informing determinants that are among the conditions of its own production. Ultimately, of course, both the evident presence of Shakespeare, and the more muted reminder of US foreign policy, must give way in the film to its primary directive, which is to sell the product. Here, Shakespeare comes into his post-millennial own, being mortgaged to, and deployed in promoting, the narrative’s commercial requirements. The Merchant of Venice quotation is a subliminal part of this imperative: so, too, is the shop awning reference to The Two Gentlemen of Verona – ‘Win her with gifts’ – and the general equation of romance, youth and the designer lifestyle.12 Contrary to the hood, which obscures the identity of the gunman, the jeans worn by Romeo and Juliet have an individuating effect. That, at least, is the claim of the film’s website, which states: ‘Each &denim pair are different . . . created . . . for the fashion of today and the one we will honour tomorrow’. As this parodic recasting of the language of the marriage service suggests, the ‘&denim’ range of jeans is conceived of internally rather than externally, as the carrier of a sublime virtue rather than the demonstration of a must-have materiality. Jeans with the H&M label, therefore, are ‘true . . . companions in long and honest relationships’: they are purveyors not so much of momentary needs as timeless realities. There is a purposeful blurring here with one cultural construction of Shakespeare: like the Bard, whose works live on in the popular imaginary, ‘&denim’ jeans will survive vicissitude. Or, to put it another way, the wearer/consumer enjoys a personal and permanent connection with his/her clothes, filling out the vacant space preceding the ‘&’ and responding affirmatively to the invitation to buy the item and complete the romantic circuit.13 Canonically entrenched ideas about the ageless applications of Shakespeare recur in the part of the menu devoted to the jeans themselves. Different styles are represented, variously, as ‘loyal’, ‘classic’ and ‘original’: the descriptors deployed suggest that, by acquiring a particular garment, the consumer\n\nIntroduction 7 partakes of, and comes to inhabit, precisely that Shakespearean attribute. To enjoy ‘&denim’, it is implied, is to become acculturated, to claim a past that has a present purchase and an assured future. Inside this semiotic structure, all is geared towards facilitating the interested party and bolstering an impression of his/her buying power. Such a process is hinted at in the on-screen message at the close, ‘With Love From H&M’, which equates the experience of watching the film with the receipt of a gift. Yet, within this economy, to be so honoured is simultaneously to enter a system of debt and exchange whereby the primary act of giving must be responded to and repaid. ‘Romeo and Juliet’ by David Lachapelle endows consumers with ‘values’ that span more than one cultural category, that privilege and implicate in the interests of broadcasting the ‘& denim’ range’s multivalent irresistibility. Given the interplay between recollection and fantasy that makes up ‘Romeo and Juliet’ by David Lachapelle, it is unclear which of the film’s endings is granted priority. The penultimate sequence discovers Juliet seizing Romeo’s mobile phone in order to shoot his assassin, yet the final composition displays the lovers reclining on a bed, barely moving as they gaze at each other adoringly. Vengeance is entertained, but so, too, are ideas about resurrection, survival, a shared approach to death and the embrace of an alternative reality. The confusion is, in fact, integral to the broader workings of the film: via the selection of jeans the consumer is encouraged to make particular narrative choices. Viewers are placed in the position of mixing and matching various readings of Shakespeare’s play as part of the process whereby the desirability of the product is reified. Thus, it is not so much the case that, as the website informs us, ‘the importance of fashion yields to the forces of true love’; rather, the ending(s) of the film reveal how a conservative construction of Shakespearean ‘love’ is the instrument through which ‘fashion’ is affirmed: the consumer is empowered at the level of narrative in order to be targeted in the extra-filmic economy. Because of these narrative layerings, ‘Romeo and Juliet’ by David Lachapelle emerges as no straightforward filmic statement. It represents a collocation of texts to be decoded as much as it appears as a cross-media tie-in for the latest initiative of the global garment industry. A work in which Shakespeare is himself a brand or an implied icon, this Romeo and Juliet is part homage, part imitation, part trailer, part promotion, part PC experience. As such, Lachapelle’s ‘film’ illustrates in abundance the signature features of Shakespearean filmmaking in the new millennium. The essays assembled in the present volume confirm that Shakespeare is a magnet for negotiations about style, value and cultural identity. At the\n\n8 Mark Thornton Burnett and Ramona Wray same time, the reverberations set up by his name facilitate screen reflections upon the operations of history and the nature of representation – the legacies of the past as they play themselves out in present circumstances. Shakespeare, the chapters argue, is frequently made understandable via an intertextual apparatus; that is, an always-already mediatised Bard is put into the service of discussions about, variously, place, locale and class in a range of contexts. The lineages through which Shakespeare is constituted in the post-millennial moment facilitate explorations into race, ethnicity and multiculturalism, across nations and formats, even as they shore up the romantic charge of his works’ deployments. Indeed, it is precisely because of Shakespeare’s prior and continuing absorption in popular culture that, in filmic guise, his plays are enabled to broach a spectrum of local and global twenty-first-century concerns, from the dangers of terrorism to the workings of a ‘McDonaldised’ world. And, as Shakespeare’s association with authority and authenticity are the cues for film production, so, too, is his cultural leverage reinforced by his being marketed as a mystery that is still to be deciphered, despite the knowable qualities that his plays appear to epitomise. As Shakespeare’s Happy Endings suggests, culture after the millennium is still drawn to, if not haunted by, popular constructions promising to illuminate Shakespeare as author. Richard Dutton’s provocative opening essay in this collection addresses In Search of Shakespeare, arguing that the persistent privileging of the presenter, Michael Wood, is key to the 2003 series’ initiative – to ‘discover’ the Bard through subjecting him to a rigorous ‘searching’ process. Moving nimbly between scholarly accretions and media interpretations, Dutton analyses the ways in which Shakespeare’s life is transformed into a ‘whodunit’ through the documentary’s zealous use of unscripted conversation, insets of performance and stylised images. The result, it is argued, is the production of ‘a Shakespeare for the twenty-first century’, one who was always ‘unseen’, self-effacing and purposefully elusive both in his writing and in his material relations with authority. The thesis that this is a politicised Shakespeare, whose need for dark secrecy captures the mood of the present moment, chimes unerringly with Mark Thornton Burnett’s contention that Shakespeare and surveillance are familiar post-millennial bedfellows. For him, Shakespeare on screen is penetrated by the broader strategies and methods that define and control the subject in modernity; hence, in post-2000 film versions of Hamlet, Burnett argues, surveillance is everywhere apparent as a practice that bespeaks cinema’s sensitivity to the relations between incarcerating visual regimes and a terror-haunted world. Concentrating on three very differently produced Hamlets which,\n\nIntroduction 9 nevertheless, share surprisingly similar thematic connections, Burnett shows how new modes of seeing are integral to the endeavour to establish both forms of political understanding and possibilities for social and cultural emancipation. In this way, through representation of the organisational bases of surveillance, these Hamlet films draw a heightened attention to the ways in which Shakespeare and optical systems of power form part of a symbiotic and mutually reinforcing dialectic. Just as Burnett detects a marked change of emphasis in post-2000 versions of Hamlet, so does Richard Burt find Stage Beauty (dir. Richard Eyre, 2004) to be a twenty-first-century transfiguration of its twentiethcentury precursor, Shakespeare in Love (dir. John Madden, 1998). He suggests that the film’s interest in the fortunes of Othello in an imaginary Restoration theatre argues both for a break in an earlier filmic tradition interested in stagings of Shakespeare and for a ‘post-post-colonial Shakespeare’, a Bard enmeshed in a still unfolding trajectory of racial impersonation and parody. Consistently, racial marking has a subversive edge, avers Burt, who positions the film’s challenge to prevailing cinematic codes governing race as part of a responsiveness to a newly transnational Shakespeare. Close analysis of ‘fakery’ and performance aesthetics inside a global film industry allows Burt to claim convincingly and controversially that Stage Beauty’s final effect is unwittingly to point up the inherent provinciality of the forms through which a raced Shakespeare might adequately be transmitted. Courtney Lehmann’s understanding of provinciality occupies a contrasting register, moving as it does from the workings of race to a grammar of place. Her contribution, alive to the interplay between time and history that identifies the post-millennial Shakespeare, argues that, in My Kingdom (dir. Don Boyd, 2001), a ‘postnostalgic’ yearning for a Liverpool that was is held in ideological equipoise with the shaping realities of late capitalism and post-9/11 paranoia. The city, Lehmann suggests, is a place poised at a crossroads made up of regret for an earlier glory, and aspiration for rehabilitation and improvement. It is such a doubled perspective that permits the film to read King Lear according to a twenty-first-century paradigm that involves fascinating reflections upon the formation of global polity and anticipations of a reinvigorated species of postmodernity. In their chapter, Susanne Greenhalgh and Robert Shaughnessy address intersections between the local and the global, the urban and the rural, and the ‘native’ and the ‘migrant’ in order to pinpoint the multicultural status of the contemporary Shakespeare. Focusing on British television’s evolving prioritisation of ethnicity and multiculturalism as essential modalities for Shakespearean interpretation and dissemination, their\n\n10 Mark Thornton Burnett and Ramona Wray discussion ranges impressively across documentaries, dramas, adaptations, educational programmes and musical scores. In a Britain where colour-blind casting and the multicultural performance of Shakespeare have become increasingly normative, Greenhalgh and Shaughnessy make a case for the operation of a genuinely new dynamic of cultural ‘fusion’ in a growing body of post-2000 Asian work. Small-scale productions of Shakespeare, such as Twelfth Night (dir. Tim Supple, 2003) and Indian Dream (dir. Roger Goldby, 2003), give way in the next chapter to globally marketed and multiplex-targeted screen realisations. The subject of Samuel Crowl’s chapter is The Merchant of Venice (dir. Michael Radford, 2004), a film which secured international distribution via MGM and Sony Classics and which, it is suggested, displays in its ideological orientation an intriguing essentialist alliance with some recent literary criticism, including Stephen Greenblatt’s best-selling Will in the World. Crowl posits the importance of a relation that both demonstrates the symbiotic relationship enjoyed by film and literary analysis and marks a significant turning-point in attitudes towards, and constructions of, Shakespeare’s play. The twenty-first-century The Merchant of Venice, the essay concludes, is striking for playing up the perils of a global system in which religious revivals, and sectarian intolerances, are everywhere apparent. Complementing and complicating the perspective of Radford’s film is the first full-length Shakespeare film to be made in New Zealand and the first full-length Ma¯ori Shakespeare film. Catherine Silverstone’s discussion of The Maori Merchant of Venice (dir. Don Selwyn, 2001) demonstrates some of the tensions that inhere in ‘intercultural’ performances of Shakespeare, where Shakespeare’s texts are produced in the context of local knowledges and traditions. While The Maori Merchant of Venice takes pains to showcase Ma¯ori language (te reo) and heritage, it does so unevenly and uncertainly: traumas of past tensions and inequities are conjured in the effort to bypass memory and imagine a better, ‘intercultural’ future. Indeed, it is as an articulation of the ‘future-past’ that the film functions most cogently, with histories of land dispossession and violence being revived in the same moment as a postmillennial impulse towards mutually satisfactory integrationist policies is formulated. An essay that deals with the legacies of colonisation is followed by one devoted to exploring a filmic reworking of what has come to be regarded as a salient colonial statement – Shakespeare’s Henry V. Almost twenty years ago, Kenneth Branagh’s Henry V (1989) kicked off the Shakespeare film boom of the 1990s, but, as Sarah Hatchuel writes in her contribution, Peter Babakitis’ Henry V (2004), in conception, method and\n\nIntroduction 11 execution, is intriguingly nuanced by comparison. Available only inside the conference and convention circuit, the film draws upon the popular genre of docu-drama and mobilises pre-existing media representations of the invasion of Iraq in order to promote a sense of historical realism. At the same time, Hatchuel argues, the use of digital stylisation in the realisation of Henry counters moves towards verisimilitude and creates a distancing effect: the two forms co-exist in a tense rapport that underscores an ultimately mythologised reading of the protagonist at the new millennium. If Babakitis is one of the many directors defining himself in complex opposition to the Shakespeare films of the 1980s and 1990s, then this is a procedure also common to the numerous ‘spin-off’ Shakespeare films that have proliferated since 2000. As Carolyn Jess-Cooke argues in her chapter, screen ‘Shakespeares’ after the millennium, despite internal differences and international market distribution, are marked by a curious homogeneity and indebtedness in the extent to which they cannibalise, sequelise and entertain a ‘repetition compulsion’. This, following recent developments in cultural theory, Jess-Cooke labels ‘McDonaldisation’, which she defines as a commercialising rehash of the work of a Hollywood film industry marked by a general poverty of imaginative energy. Yet her essay argues against a summary dismissal of the films discussed in that they make available routes though cultural diversity, throw light on the imperial legacies of the present era, draw a necessary attention to the politics of reterritorialisation, and establish discursive fields within which Shakespeare might be newly negotiated. In this way, JessCooke’s argument imaginatively appreciates the significance of ‘spin-offs’ for an understanding of what Shakespeare ‘means’ in, and to, popular culture in the twenty-first century. It is precisely such an absorption in popular culture that Ramona Wray elaborates in her discussion of the 2005 ‘Shakespeare (Re)-Told’ season. Addressing the latest Shakespearean incarnations, Wray argues for a contemporary purchase on Shakespearean comedy, one capable of accommodating the genre’s characteristic intransigence in exciting and original ways. Jointly foregrounding identical popular television genres, character types and contemporary media debate, Much Ado About Nothing and The Taming of the Shrew, Wray argues, demonstrate an assured sense of modern equivalents for Shakespearean comedy and a considered awareness of the ways in which post-feminist understandings operate. Particularly distinctive, in a transformed sexual economy, are the means whereby modern-language adaptation is capable of pushing into productive proximity early modern constructions of gender and twenty-first-century reflections upon life-work balance and male-female\n\n12 Mark Thornton Burnett and Ramona Wray relations. Both adaptations suggest the ongoing vibrancy of the Shakespearean word, the utility of his applications and the complexion of his current manifestations. They point, too, to constructions of Shakespeare that are more thematically demanding, and less ironically strident, than the conclusion to Shakespeare’s Happy Endings would appear to offer. Despite views to the contrary, Shakespeare has been drained neither of ‘re-telling’ potential nor of the energy of his imprimatur. His ‘endings’ are not so much the stuff of millennial unhappiness as they are the material for an unfolding series of interrogations and interpretations, a sequence of screen Shakespeares that promises a new chapter, another beginning.\n\nNotes 1.

One, we infer from the book that accompanies the TV series In Search of Shakespeare spends many hours in libraries and consulting leading scholars.1 Although his book is not disfigured with conventional academic annotation (it is aimed at a middlebrow, not a highbrow readership), it records its extensive debts to scholarship and to solitary reflection. And it is scholarship that is commendably up to the minute. If there is nothing strictly new here, there are many details – for example, John Shakespeare’s prosecution for illegal wool-dealing, the latest twists in his possible association with Hoghton Tower in Lancashire, the possible association of Cymbeline with the investiture of Prince Henry as Prince of Wales – that are not yet established in conventional biographies. And the whole emphasis on the first Elizabethan age less as a world of letters celebrating its Virgin Queen than as a religious police state, riddled with spying and insecurity, is very much in tune with the politicised literary studies of recent decades. This is the Michael Wood with two Oxford degrees, one a research degree in Anglo-Saxon history: a learned, bookish man, accustomed to the solitude of writing – so, in that respect, not all that unlike his subject here. William Shakespeare must have spent a high proportion of his life writing, poring over his Ovid, his Holinshed, his Plutarch, then writing again. It is a challenge to any biographer to instill drama and excitement into the life of – of all things – a writer. Yet this Wood – let us call him the scholar Wood – does so admirably in his book. But the challenge is all the greater when the biographer is working in the medium of film, where the target audience is much larger than that envisaged by the book. This audience will probably be characterised as predominantly lower-middlebrow, worldwide (at least, throughout the\n\n14 Richard Dutton English-speaking world, and especially North America), with a short attention-span, and needing to be fed visuals as much as words – though happily it can be distracted for quite long periods with vistas of ‘Olde England’. It is in the context of the film series (and previous series he has made) that we find the other Michael Wood, an extrovert presenter Mr Hyde to the desk-bound scholar Dr Jekyll. Like most scholars, the first Wood is largely absent from the pages of his book, even as he quietly imposes his personality upon them. But the presenter Wood is omnipresent, both verbally and visually. The formula ‘In Search of . . .’ is not merely a metaphor. On screen, this really is the tale of a physical search – for documents, for places, for associations – and this Wood is with us every step of the way: earnest, enthusiastic, photogenic. It is not that he avoids libraries and archives – these, after all, are where the key documents live. But where scholar Wood must read, absorb, ruminate, presenter Wood promptly talks us (and their curators) through their significance, a source of instant illumination. He invokes academics and other experts continually in the course of his search, but their expertise is never allowed seriously to disrupt what is essentially his narrative flow (even when it sometimes masquerades as dialogue). There is still, to be sure, something of the scholar in the presenter Wood: this is a man who can decipher Elizabethan secretary hand at sight and offer impromptu translations of Latin. But it is never a scholarship that is worn heavily or allowed to seem hard work, nor to offer much in the way of doubt or debate – distractions anathema to the gods of popular film. So, although the book and the TV series were clearly written and devised by one and the same man – they cover much (not all) of the same material, with similar emphases – they are actually very different beasts. The scholarly underpinnings of the series, which are rarely allowed to register there, are clearly visible in the book, which also has the space to allow more material than can go on air, despite the very generous four hours allowed – an epic in TV documentary terms. This is, as I shall discuss, partly the result of the decision to include in the series elements for which there could be no print equivalent – notably snippets of performance and passages of conversation – which absorbed time entertainingly but perhaps not all that instructively. What follows is largely an account of the TV series and presenter Wood. If I am sometimes less than reverent about his screen mannerisms, please do not misinterpret this as disrespect for the project as a whole, which at its heart offers us a serious and considered Shakespeare for the beginning of the twenty-first century.\n\n‘If I’m right’ 15\n\nStyle The series defines itself, both thematically and stylistically, in the sequences immediately before and after the opening credits of Episode One. The former gives us skyscapes of modern London at night and then of the starkly lit, reconstructed Globe on the Bankside, before which Wood (handsomely sinister in a black leather bomber-jacket) announces that: ‘This is a historical detective story, an Elizabethan whodunit’, promising us an investigation into the life of Shakespeare ‘set against the turbulent times in which he lived’. The credits roll. We are in sunny deciduous woodland, on an unmetalled road, where Wood (now wearing a more casual light-brown jacket and knapsack, which will figure repeatedly hereafter) has an apparently unscripted encounter with a young boy: BOY: Where are you going? WOOD: We’re walking up the ancient road. It’s one of the old roads of England. BOY: Are you walking all the way there? WOOD: Yes.\n\nThese sequences set the filmic parameters of what follows. We are always unmistakably in the here-and-now, at the beginning of the twenty-first century. We are on a historical quest, but it is one that will be conducted in the present, often with the aid of material artefacts – notably documents and buildings – which may derive from the past but which clearly have an identity in contemporary culture. The woody lane may evoke ‘Merrie England’ or the Forest of Arden but it does not pretend to be, or even to represent, them: a caravan from which the boy has evidently emerged holds us in the present, as does the earnestly enthusiastic figure of Wood himself, a historian far too hip to be mistaken for a figure from the past towards which he walks. The series will end with Shakespeare being described as ‘a man whose works are a bridge between the world we have lost and the world we have become’, a formulation that neatly encapsulates the series’ own handling of history as a process of finding bridging moments between past and present – a formula made for the medium of TV, where it is possible to talk about the past and simultaneously look at the present. We see a fair amount of Wood walking as if in Tudor England, but we also often see him taking the train or the Underground (less often in a car) in our second Elizabethan age. When we hear the story of Marlowe (described at one point as ‘gay, hip, iconoclastic’) being arrested in Flushing, the pictures\n\n16 Richard Dutton dwell on an anonymous figure on a Harley Davidson. When we hear of James VI & I setting off south to claim the throne of England, the pictures we see are of a train, on a bridge on the East Coast line. This is a stylisation that has little place for historical reconstruction or pastiche. There are no actors here pretending to be Shakespeare, or mouthing words ascribed to him: we are denied an actorly presence, such as that of Joseph Fiennes in Shakespeare in Love (2000) or of Tim Curry in the John Mortimer-scripted Life of Shakespeare (1978).2 Anything in that mode would inevitably announce itself as fiction, with a freight of its own, at odds with the Wood search. By the same token, we have become accustomed in recent years to a form of TV history in which action is provided by grainy or soft-focus footage of costumed actors, perhaps riding or fighting (but not speaking from a prohibitively time-consuming and expensive script). There is almost none of that here, though there is an intriguing exception when we hear of Edmund Campion and his fellow Jesuits being smuggled into England in 1580 and see an appropriate ship at sea with huddled figures in the dead of night. (We immediately cut back to a much more typical Wood in a car at the floodlit port of Dover.) Similarly, TV history commonly resorts these days to computer simulations as a cheap substitute for grandeur or action. Again, these are largely conspicuous by their absence here. There is a small exception in the final episode where, to evoke James I’s 1604 ceremonial entry into London, we see computer graphics of the triumphal arches under which he rode, and superimposed on them indistinct footage of a twentieth-century coronation. But again, these are exceptions that prove the rule. No, this is not history by fictional or technological reconstruction. Nor does it have any truck with postmodern musings about the medium and the message, or the complicities of representation. It stands by the idea of actuality, of empirically knowable truth. Or, to put it another way, it stands by Michael Wood. As I have suggested, Wood is on-screen for a large part of the time, and is the focus of attention throughout. Even when, for example, actors appear to perform sequences from plays, we see cut-away shots of the audiences’ response – and Wood is invariably in the audience. This is no surprise to anyone familiar with Wood’s earlier work, much of which follows a similar formula: In Search of the Dark Ages, In Search of England, In the Footsteps of Alexander the Great – the common denominator is always Wood himself, comfortably at home with the camera, articulate, casually, but probably expensively, dressed. Like Knowledge in the morality play of Everyman, he willingly undertakes to act as the common man’s guide through a difficult world: ‘Everyman, I will go with thee and be thy guide, / In thy most need to go\n\n‘If I’m right’ 17 by thy side’.3 He never trails his qualifications, but he exudes authority and conviction. He knows how to read evidence. This is a particularly daring tactic to adopt in respect of Shakespeare, so much of whose life remains inscrutable, unknowable and overladen with myth. Wood knows as much, and occasionally admits it. But his characteristic reaction is to make light of it. So, for example, when faced with the actuality of the entry in the Bishop of Worcester’s Register (27 November 1582) of the grant of a marriage licence to William Shakespeare and Anne Whateley (not Hathaway), he does not – like Anthony Burgess in his Shakespeare (1970) – leap to the conclusion that Anne Whateley was Shakespeare’s true love, whom he was only prevented from marrying by friends of the pregnant Anne Hathaway’s family (who then made sure he did the honourable thing). Rather, he suggests an overworked and confused clerk, who had been dealing with Whateleys in another connection and here made a simple mistake. It is a common-sense solution, frequently followed by other biographers. But when a similar matter-of-factness is applied to other matters – sometimes without even revealing that a judgement of this sort has been made – the effect can be more worrying. So in the first episode, about Shakespeare’s early years, Wood is pictured in the King Edward VI School at Stratford, saying: ‘William was taught in this school-room’. This is very likely, but it is more than we actually know. As an alderman of the town, and sometime bailiff (Wood says ‘mayor’, a more familiar term though not strictly accurate), John Shakespeare was entitled to have his sons educated free in the town’s grammar school. But the records of the school for the period are missing, so we have no concrete proof. Again, that Shakespeare attended that school is common-sense likelihood, but there is room here for ‘probably’. The issue becomes more critical slightly later when (after tracing the likely source of John Shakespeare’s notable early wealth and standing as ‘a brogger – an illegal wool-dealer’) Wood links the end of that illicit trading with the end of William’s education: ‘his father took him out of school early. At the age of fourteen he found himself cut off from the chance of higher education and the chances of going to university’. This is in fact considerably more than we know or might guess. Yes, John Shakespeare fell on hard times, and William certainly did not go to university. But to state categorically that he did not complete the humanist curriculum of a grammar school is to make a serious claim for which there is no evidence. Baconians, Marlovians and Oxfordians have traded on the supposed implausibility of Shakespeare becoming the writer he did without a university education: to have him leaving school this early is to play into their hands.\n\n18 Richard Dutton To be fair, such lapses are rare.4 But another instance gives more indication of how potentially misleading such apparent certainties can be. In the third episode, we are told that ‘only days after The Dream was played before the Queen, Southwell was hanged, drawn and quartered at Tyburn’.5 This claim is made in order to accentuate the distance between Shakespeare as a writer of popular and courtly theatre and the Jesuit Robert Southwell, author of religious poetry: it also tacitly draws a picture of Queen Elizabeth as a pleasure-loving monarch, at a time when many people were being put viciously to death in her name. But we have no evidence that A Midsummer Night’s Dream was ever played before her: that it may have been is tied in with extensive suppositions (which Wood does not pursue) about it having been written for some aristocratic wedding which Elizabeth might have attended. But this itself is contentious, and besides we have no absolute certainty that the play was written before 1598. Wood, in fact, has been economical with the truth because it conveniently underscores what we may describe as the principal thesis underlying the series. He may want to give the impression that he is walking up ‘the ancient road’ to encounter what he finds in the historical record with an open mind, in a spirit of impartial factuality: he sees the document, and it reveals its truth to/through him. But it is not, and cannot be, as simple as that. The historical record (as Shakespeare’s own history plays demonstrate only too well) can be – quite legitimately – read many ways. In this instance, as in many others, Wood is predisposed to read the record firstly and most insistently in the light of the religious conflicts of the early modern era (the driving force behind ‘the turbulent times in which he lived’), and to search for Shakespeare within these.\n\nSubstance This is all rather more elegantly outlined in the book, which opens with a prologue in which John Shakespeare, as bailiff of Stratford, is called upon to obliterate the medieval (and so Catholic-tainted) wall paintings in the town’s Guild Chapel. The work is done but only amounts to a thin whitewashing, which might conceivably have been reversed had English history performed yet another religious U-turn in the tortuous sequence that ran from Henry VIII through Edward VI and Mary to Elizabeth. (On screen, Wood knowingly sums up the Tudors as ‘a dysfunctional family if there ever was one’ – and, unlike many earlier historians, he does not exclude Elizabeth from that judgement; in the book she is characterised as ‘brilliant, vulnerable, psychologically damaged’ (p. 69).) This is posited as a central metaphor: William Shakespeare born into a deeply\n\n‘If I’m right’ 19 Roman Catholic world, the world of English myth and memory to which his mother’s Arden family was certainly attached and to which John Shakespeare also (apparently) subscribed in setting his hand to a Jesuitborne Spiritual Testament. This world was constantly in friction with Elizabeth’s police state of a Protestant regime, though the intensity might vary depending on circumstances. But it proved to be fighting a lost cause, so that (whatever William’s personal convictions) the whitewash had effectively triumphed by the end of his life, a bridge had been irrevocably crossed and there could be no going back. All of this is certainly in the TV series, but it is not established with quite the same polish or centrality in the first episode, doubtless because in televisual mode other themes and issues were vying for early positioning. I mentioned earlier the actors: they have to be introduced. Also, in a work trailed as a ‘whodunit’, it is important to come quickly to the plot, to the evidence which will be encountered and how it will be investigated. So we move quickly to the record of William Shakespeare’s baptism, which of course gives us dates, places and persons – the building blocks of the plot. Significantly, in line with the stylisation I described earlier, we do not see a re-enactment of the events behind that register entry. Instead, we see shots of a modern baptism (one of the first ‘bridging moments’) intercut with woodcuts of Elizabethan ones. This is a world we have lost; but it is also where our own world begins. In the TV series, therefore, religion at first seems only one of a number of preoccupations, but it quickly becomes apparent how central it is in the amount of air-time it consumes. ‘Elizabeth’s England must have been a schizophrenic place, the old religion still in so many hearts, and the new secular age waiting to be born. And young Will right at the heart of it’. This is very much in tune with Shakespeare studies in the wake of New Historicism and Cultural Materialism: we are less inclined to idealise, more to see in the great plays and poems violence, power struggles, tensions. This emphasis is, for example, largely responsible for the fact that fully half of the series (the first two episodes) are devoted to Shakespeare before he emerges in the written records as a playwright – that is, before he is identified as a member of the Lord Chamberlain’s Men.6 So, in the account of Shakespeare’s family, significant emphasis is placed on the will of mother Mary’s father, Robert Arden (‘This is it, the document itself’, Wood enthuses, holding the parchment like a holy relic). The point is that the will is unmistakably couched in the language of the Old Faith, a marker of how closely it can be tied to Shakespeare’s immediate family on his mother’s side. Similarly, the business of the entry of the wedding licence quickly passes over the Whateley/Hathaway confusion to focus\n\n20 Richard Dutton on the fact that the bride is associated there, not with Stratford, but with Temple Grafton. Wood quickly identifies a reason (the reason?) for this: whereas the Stratford parson in 1583 was Puritan-leaning, John Frith in Temple Grafton was a hold-over from Queen Mary’s reign, inclining to the Old Faith even if he maintained a façade of Anglican orthodoxy. He collected simples and medicinal herbs, like Friar Lawrence in Romeo and Juliet. Here was a priest who might conduct a marriage more in tune with the old ways. The brief (and stylistically anomalous) reconstructed scene of the Jesuits at sea is, in this connection, obviously meant to mark a dramatic development: ‘The time for compromise was over’. Catholics like the Shakespeares increasingly had to commit themselves to one camp or the other. This ushers in the tale of John Shakespeare’s Spiritual Testament, discovered by workmen in the eighteenth century, transcribed by Edmund Malone, but then lost – and only verified when other versions of such documents came to light in the twentieth century. Wood is thus deprived of the truly talismanic bridging document – material evidence in the present of a significance in the past – but makes do with showing us a place (the place?) in the thatched rafters of the Shakespeare house in Henley Street where it might have been found. The narrative here is building to William’s leaving home, at some point in the 1580s. The most popular anecdote about his doing so supposes that he left because he was caught poaching deer in the Charlcotte deer-park of the Warwickshire magnate, Sir Thomas Lucy. Pedantic history objects that Lucy had no deer-park at Charlcotte in Shakespeare’s time, only an enclosure for rabbits. But more important for Wood is the fact that Lucy was one of the most important Protestant enforcers in Warwickshire, unswervingly loyal to Elizabeth’s favourite, the Earl of Leicester, and to the Protestant ascendancy. Is it possible, Wood asks, that the deer-poaching legend remembers some friction between Shakespeare and the man who represented everything that threatened his family’s culture? Episode One ends with an account of the arrest and barbarous execution of Edward Arden, the head of the old Warwickshire Ardens (an important relative, if not a close one, of Shakespeare’s mother). He was done to judicial death by the Protestant authorities on no real grounds other than the fact of his faith. Of the effect of that execution, Wood claims special insight: ‘As we shall see, Shakespeare never forgot’. Episode Two opens 100 miles north of Stratford, at Hoghton Tower near Preston in Lancashire. Wood is in pursuit of the theory that Shakespeare may have been the William Shakeshafte mentioned, in connection with household theatricals, in the 1581 will of Alexander\n\n‘If I’m right’ 21 Hoghton. This was first floated in the 1930s, relaunched with compelling new evidence by Ernst Honigmann in 1987, and has since been vigorously championed by Richard Wilson.7 In a quintessential bridging moment, Wood greets the current family owner of Hoghton Tower, Sir Bernard de Hoghton (and cannot resist reminding him that he first visited ‘in pursuit of Shakespeare’ twenty years earlier – that is, before the current vogue for the theory): together they peruse the will.8 We have been told that several of Shakespeare’s presumed Stratford schoolmasters were Lancastrian Catholics (Lancashire being an even stauncher hotbed of Catholicism than Warwickshire); now we learn that ‘William’s Stratford teacher was a Hoghton man’. The beauty of the Hoghton theory is that it ties together so many features of the Shakespeare story: it fits one of the best attested of the early anecdotes, about him being ‘a schoolmaster in the country’ (which derives from William Beeston, son of the fellow actor, Christopher); it introduces him to key figures – not only the Hoghtons, but the Heskeths (Thomas Savage who helped finance the Globe was married to a Hesketh); and it provides him with an entrée to the world of theatre, firstly in noble households, but potentially also encountering professional troupes patronised by the great magnates of the north-west, the Stanley Earls of Derby. These key figures were all (and this is the glue that holds this all together) cryptoCatholics – as we may suppose the poet to be. Shakespeare certainly wrote for the players of the heir to the title, Ferdinando, Lord Strange, in the early 1590s, and many of these were later to join with him in the Lord Chamberlain’s Men. As a theory, it has most things going for it – except proof.9 Wood is surely right, however, in pointing out that it demonstrates how patronage networks worked at the time, especially in the Catholic underground, and how professional playing was still closely linked with entertainments in great households. ‘So whether William was Shakeshafte or not, Lancashire is an important part of the story.’ Episode Two moves into the question of how Shakespeare became fully involved in the professional theatre, opting for the much favoured current theory that he might have joined the Queen’s Men when they visited Stratford (to which he must have returned for his marriage and the begetting of his children) in 1587, having lost one of their principal players in a duel. His entry into London theatre is thus set against the backdrop of the defeat of the Spanish Armada, the military highpoint of the Elizabethan regime, which must have been an ambivalent moment for many Catholics. The propaganda war surrounding this is knowingly evoked with clips from Fire Over England (1937), a pro-rearmament vehicle in its day which now just looks naively patriotic. The ‘imaginal’\n\n22 Richard Dutton Shakespeare at the heart of this dangerous world is characterised as ‘funny, streetwise, sexy’, but his Catholic upbringing is still not an exhausted topic.10 Episode Three opens at Baddesley Clinton near Stratford, home of the Ferrars family, and relates the tale of pursuivant searches for Robert Southwell: Wood himself characteristically descends into the sewers where the Jesuit and his fellows (for the time being) escaped detection. This focus on Southwell is a telling mark of Wood’s predisposition. Southwell is not even mentioned in Samuel Schoenbaum’s William Shakespeare: A Compact Documentary Life (1977), which for an earlier generation was the most robust and reliable biography of Shakespeare. Wood, however, attaches a good deal of significance to a preface that Southwell wrote around 1592 and circulated in manuscript with his poems; it is addressed ‘To My Worthy Good Cosen, Maister W. S.’, whom Wood takes (he is not original in this, though the theory has not recently been fashionable) to be Shakespeare, who was indeed a very distant relative. The preface praises W. S. as a superior poet, but condemns him for ‘playing with pagan toys’ – that is, writing secular verse rather than spiritual poetry like his own. As Wood puts it, he ‘took him to task on the role of the poet’. If Shakespeare really was W. S., Southwell’s subsequent barbarous execution by hanging, drawing and quartering cannot but have challenged the very basis of the lifestyle he had chosen in writing for the stage and for money. In 1593, however, that career choice was challenged in other ways. Severe plague closed the theatres and eventually led to the break-up of many of the established acting companies. Wood follows most authorities in assuming that Shakespeare’s turn to writing narrative verse, in Venus and Adonis, was prompted by these circumstances. His choice of the third Earl of Southampton as dedicatee was, however, apparently dictated by a familiar agenda: ‘the Southamptons leaned to the Old Faith’, and there is discussion of the earl’s mother harbouring Catholic priests at their various houses. This takes us to the fate of Southwell and, against footage of Beefeaters and the Tower of London, Wood observes: ‘Easy to forget, isn’t it, the dark side of Shakespeare’s world? Southwell was one of 36,000 people who died on the scaffold or in prison in Elizabeth’s reign, among them members of Shakespeare’s own family’. It is here, however, that the strain of Wood’s attempt to tell the full tale of Shakespeare, while giving the religious theme such prominence, really begins to tell, since his interest in Southampton quickly wanes – so quickly in fact that there is no mention of the Rape of Lucrece, the dedication of which most scholars agree is more warmly personal than that of Venus and Adonis.\n\n‘If I’m right’ 23 This must be because another agenda now intervenes, all but derailing the religious one. The Stratford burial register in 1596 records the death of Shakespeare’s son, Hamnet. This must, of course, have been a terrible blow: the death of his only son and male heir, all but mocking the family’s efforts to establish its gentry, which came to fruition shortly afterwards with the grant of a coat of arms. (More primary documents are in the College of Heralds, a ‘bridging’ institution if ever there was one: in the book, Wood speaks of it having ‘more than a faint whiff of Hogwarts, Griffender and Ravenclaw’ (p. 167).)11 But Wood sees in Hamnet’s death one of the mainsprings behind the writing of the sonnets. This flows against the modern tide, which has increasingly seen Southampton c. 1593/4 as the likeliest of the sonnets’ primary subjects. Jonathan Bate even invokes Occam’s razor to stress, with italic emphasis, the strength of the case for Southampton: ‘All candidatures for the fair youth with the exception of Southampton’s depend on things not known to exist; it is not necessary to postulate any of these things as existing, since the origin of the sonnets can be explained with things we do know to exist.’12 Wood, however, eagerly follows the contra-flow created by Katherine Duncan-Jones in her Arden edition of the sonnets and biographical Ungentle Shakespeare, which resurrect the other principal candidate, William Herbert, from 1601 the third Earl of Pembroke.13 Wood marks his radicalism here with ‘If I’m right’ – a repeated formula of his, meaning ‘there is an even bigger element of speculation about what follows than usual’: ‘the next spring Shakespeare got a commission from one of the great literary patrons, Lady Mary Herbert of Wilton. He was to write sonnets for the seventeenth birthday of one of her children’. The idea that Pembroke might have been the recipient of the sonnets (that is, Mr W. H., their ‘only begetter’, as the dedication perhaps has it) is hardly new. But Wood invokes it in a particular cause, which is not that of Duncan-Jones herself.14 He does not exactly duck the issue that most of them were written to a man; indeed, he invokes the eminent Shakespearean, Stanley Wells, to delicately make the point that the Renaissance did not draw the same lines between hetero- and homosexual love that we do today. But Wood makes this secondary to the idea that Shakespeare was, in these poems, finding an outlet for bottled-up grief over his son: commissioned to write to urge young Herbert to marry and have children, he must have been reminded of the loss of his own male issue. And once he was over the rather mechanical commission which many identify in the first seventeen sonnets, his intense feelings for the ‘fair youth’ might well have been fuelled by complex feelings about the son who doubtless meant much to him, but\n\n24 Richard Dutton whom (given his lifestyle, away from Stratford so much of the time) he had perhaps seen little of. Wood reads aptly and movingly from the sonnets in this vein as he wanders in the gorgeous, sun-drenched grounds of the Wilton estate. In fact, he is so dedicated to this thesis that he never specifically identifies William Herbert at all – only vaguely mentioning Mary Herbert’s son; nor does he make the point, so often advanced by others who see Pembroke as the ‘fair youth’, that in 1623 Heminge and Condell were to dedicate the Shakespeare First Folio to him and his brother, claiming that they had ‘prosecuted both [the plays], and their author living, with so much favour’. This version of the passion behind the sonnets is the clearest – and most questionable – instance of Wood (‘If I’m right’) claiming to be able to read through the works themselves to the heart of the man. He carries this into the so-called ‘dating sonnets’, claiming 107 (with its ‘The mortal moon hath her eclipse endured’) as an unequivocal reflection on the death of Elizabeth, and claiming the disenchanted boast in 125 that ‘I bore the canopy’ as a reference to his role in the ceremonial entry of James I into London.15 Both of these are perhaps more plausible if we accept Herbert as the ‘fair youth’, though such late dating would not square as well with the Southampton thesis, focused around 1593/4: the determination to read the sonnets in the wake of Hamnet’s death thus has consequences within consequences. Plausible coherence diminishes even further when we consider Wood’s candidate for the ‘Dark Lady’: Emilia Bassano/Lanier, first advanced with self-defeating arrogance by A. L. Rowse. Lanier is a fascinating candidate – apparently the former mistress of Shakespeare’s theatrical patron, the first Lord Hunsdon, and a member of the Venetian Jewish Bassano family of musicians (and so plausibly both musical and dark-skinned, as the scenario of the sonnets seems to require). Wood also wants to make the point that Lanier is one of the earliest published women poets in England, whose Salve Deus Rex Judaeorum came out very shortly after Shakespeare’s sonnets.16 She is thus a particularly intriguing rival (alongside the male ‘rival poet’) in poetic matters as well as sexual ones. The real problem here is timing and circumstance: by 1597 the elder Hunsdon was dead, and there is nothing to associate Lanier with Pembroke or his circle. The ‘Dark Lady’s’ belated narrative appearance in the sonnets would make much more sense, with Lanier in the role, around 1594, when Shakespeare retreated from Southampton and returned to the theatrical scene, for the first time associated with Hunsdon. Much of a Shakespeare biography is inevitably speculation, but it should be consistent speculation: you cannot simply pick and mix. In that sense, Wood’s choices for the ‘fair youth’ and the\n\n‘If I’m right’ 25 ‘Dark Lady’ in the sonnets are not really compatible: each is plausible and intriguing in itself, but they do not add up. At the same time, the rather sketchy attention that Southampton and Pembroke actually receive here suggests the pressure Wood is now under to fit everything in. We have not yet quite lost the religious theme, though it takes something of a back seat in the second half of Episode Three and much of Episode Four – until we reach the Gunpowder Plot, which is another major bridging moment. Most of the plotters are associated with Catholic Warwickshire and include men (like the leader, Robert Catesby) who came from families that Shakespeare must have known. To convey the import of the plot, we have pictures of a modern opening of Parliament and are told, in a particularly telling analogy, that it was ‘nothing less than a Jacobean 9/11’ (in intention: of course, it failed miserably). In another soundbite from contemporary affairs, Wood suggests that ‘for Catholic England it was the end of history’. Yet for Wood’s Shakespeare it hardly seems to have such resonance. He detects in the major tragedies a growing skepticism in matters of faith. In the book we read: ‘By the time he wrote [Hamlet] around 1600, Shakespeare was . . . probably no longer a Catholic. But he never sounds like a Protestant’ (p. 78). Although Wood acknowledges that some contemporaries (at least) felt that King Lear spoke to the cause of the Old Faith, he does not see in this Shakespeare’s personal convictions. He makes the usual connections between Macbeth and the Gunpowder Plot, but more in the spirit of Shakespeare being playwright-in-residence for a King James obsessed with witchcraft and plots against his own life than in terms of making a personal statement. We do hear that his elder daughter, Susannah, was indicted for recusancy in the crackdown that followed the plot. But there is an odd sense that this theme, which has so dominated the series, has rather run into the sand. This must in part be because Wood only argues for indirect connections between Shakespeare’s writing and his Catholic upbringing, not for a sustained (albeit covert) commitment to its doctrines. He does make the point that many of his plays focus on an English history that was perforce a Catholic history, and that he often seems to evoke ‘the holy women and good friars of Old England’. But he is not inclined to investigate closer connections: he tells us that John Speed in his History of Great Britain (1611) linked Shakespeare with the Jesuit propagandist Robert Persons in his depiction of Falstaff (‘this papist and his poet’), but he does not want to pursue how such a claim might inform our reading of the character – who has been shown simply as a gloriously universal comic character. Wood justifies his emphasis on religious matters not\n\n26 Richard Dutton because they open up a specific agenda in the writing, but because they offer a major insight into Shakespeare’s psychology, or at least his psychic world. He is a notoriously anonymous and self-effacing author: we actually know a surprising amount about his business dealings, his London residences, his non-payment of taxes, but about the man and his personality we have little to go on beyond uncorroborated anecdotes, most recorded many years after his death. These are mysteries we cannot unlock with an open-minded journey to the Public Record Office. The whole religious context, however, offers us the tantalising possibility of a way into the man’s soul. If he was indeed brought up in a strongly committed Catholic household, he would have had to learn to keep his private convictions intensely private – like John Shakespeare’s Spiritual Testament, secreted away in the rafters of the house. Wood comments on the preponderance of historical subjects in the plays: ‘Writing critically about contemporary politics was impossible, so history was a way of articulating the pressure of the times’. That is, he characteristically expressed himself by indirections. At the same time, if he belonged to a Catholic circle that had to operate within the framework of a Protestant orthodoxy, he might have cultivated a particular sensitivity to the situation of strangers or outsiders: Wood focuses upon Jews and blacks, but the analysis might also stand, say, for bastards, or indeed for women who are not comfortable with the roles their culture imposed on them. More generally, such an upbringing might have inculcated a capacity for understanding more than one point of view at once, which is certainly a skill he brought to writing plays.\n\nDistractions These are interesting propositions, which deserve more attention than they actually receive here. This must in part be because they have to share screen time with other matters. It may be perverse to say so, of a series about the greatest playwright in the language, but the most distracting of these is the recurrent presence of actors. With no disrespect to the skills of those involved (mostly members of the Royal Shakespeare Company), their precise function in the wider narrative seems not to have been thought through. It is linked to Wood’s determination to identify actual sites in which Shakespeare and his fellows acted. These include the location of James Burbage’s original theatre in ‘the wild and lawless suburbs of Shoreditch’, tracked down (on camera: it is not in the book) behind what is now Crispins’ veneer shop. There is, sadly, absolutely nothing theatrical now identifiable, but the actors are brought on to ooh and ah\n\n‘If I’m right’ 27 about this sacred site. They have more to do in other sites. The most constructive instance is in the Guild Hall at Stratford, where they stand in for the Queen’s Men to offer us a flavour of the Troublesome Raigne of King John, emphasising the patriotic Protestant message it contained, which Shakespeare was to transmute when he later revisited the material. But in other sites, such as the New Inn in Gloucester, the last surviving galleried inn of the kind that Elizabethan actors regularly used, the modern actors are really only there to give us snippets of Shakespeare’s greatest hits – the ass-turned Bottom, Falstaff and Hal in the Eastcheap tavern, Juliet lamenting that Romeo was Romeo, and so on. The same is true at the Globe – a simulation, of course, not the real thing – and in The Swan at Stratford, which doubles for an indoor Blackfriars. Each of these sites offers a bridging opportunity to investigate what it might have been like playing in the round, or to use the kind of stage machinery we know to have been available to the Elizabethans, or even to have customers sitting on stage, as they did at the Blackfriars. But that was not the spirit of the exercise: these are always modern actors, not theatrical archaeologists making bridging leaps. In this respect, they serve a less focused purpose than the historical documents with which they vie for prominence. The clearest marker of this is that actresses play the female roles, as of course they did not in Shakespeare’s day. The business of boy actors and their female impersonations is siphoned off into scenes of Stratford schoolboys performing Ralph Roister-Doister in the old schoolroom above the Guild Hall. This suggests how the Elizabethan humanist school curriculum drew on drama, but in the context of demonstrating that performances like this (cross-dressing and all) are still very much part of single-sex education in Britain – and so, implicitly, not all that remarkable. Apart from one lingering shot of a lipsticked boy in a blonde wig, the series makes no effort to plumb the depths of Elizabethan gender-construction or the intense homosociality of its theatre. So the actors are, in many ways, a distraction from the more serious historical questions being asked by the series. There are further distractions in many of those whom Wood engages in conversation in the course of his ‘search’. Some of these are notable Shakespeareans and have (as in the sequence with Stanley Wells and the sonnets) been drafted in to offer – even if it is disguised as conversation – what is effectively a structured ‘piece to camera’, aptly summarising a key point. Some, like Richard Wilson on matters at Hoghton and the property in the Blackfriars gatehouse which Shakespeare acquired late in life, manage to engineer their own pieces to camera out of not very helpful cues. Others seem really rather wasted: Peter Blayney, for example, was apparently\n\n28 Richard Dutton brought over from Toronto to demonstrate his immense knowledge of the Elizabethan book trade by indicating a space outside St Paul’s Cathedral where the stall of a bookseller who sold copies of Henry IV once stood. How much else finished up on the cutting-room floor? More generally, however, what we see is in the mode of Wood’s encounter with the little boy at the very beginning of the series – apparently spontaneous and off the cuff, supplying atmosphere more than information. So we have former mayors of Stratford, engaged in conversation about John Shakespeare’s activities in that role 400 years previously: if there was supposed to be a script here, they were not very good at sticking to it. Similarly, Lord Montagu of Beaulieu turns up as a descendant (or something) of Shakespeare’s Southampton, to offer not very authoritative answers on such questions as whether the story that the Earl gave Shakespeare £1,000 might have been true. And various record keepers, from Stratford archives to the College of Heralds to the Public Record Office, are led in rather casual conversations that might, or might not, elucidate the documents in their keeping. There is a classic instance of this in the final episode where, in pursuit of the scarlet cloth issued for the entry of James I, Wood visits Ede and Ravenscroft, robe-makers to the Queen. He enters the shop, marvelling to camera that such places still exist, and asks an assistant – who almost certainly did not expect him, or his camera crew – where to find the man he had come to interview. That man doubtless knew in advance what was to happen, but there is little evidence of rehearsal: conversation circles amiably around red cloth, and makes its points in passing. It is as if the key issue is to keep the whole event spontaneous and unscripted. This is presumably meant to keep everything lively and informal, but it also has the effect of keeping authority quite firmly in Wood’s hands: he is not about to allow hardened professionals to pontificate on their own terms, or even to suggest alternative lines of thought. They can help him on his way, but will not be allowed to upstage him. This, then, is a Shakespeare for the twenty-first century. In 1978, John Mortimer produced a fictionalised TV Shakespeare who spoke to the era’s hedonism and sexually liberated ways: the casting of Tim Curry, fresh from his triumph as the rampantly bisexual Frankenfurter in Richard O’Brien’s Rocky Horror Show, was not accidental. Wood’s unseen Shakespeare is the product of a religious Cold War which ended in a (failed) 9/11 explosion – a set of circumstances which made of him ‘writer, actor, director . . . the artist-in-chief of the Elizabethan state. In the Elizabethan police state, theatre . . . had a thrilling and dangerous power’. He is unseen because (‘If I’m right’) he was as self-effacing in his\n\n‘If I’m right’ 29 writing as he was in dealing with authority, constantly shifting digs in London, or retreating to Stratford, as occasion demanded. Though we cannot actually see him, he is visible to us all (not just specialist scholars) through the good offices of Michael Wood, to the very end Knowledge to our Everyman, and the only knowledge we really need.\n\nNotes 1. In Search of Shakespeare is the title both of the four-part TV series, presented by Michael Wood, produced by Maya Vision and first broadcast on BBC2 in 2003 (and issued on video by BBC Worldwide Ltd the same year: BBCV7485); and of the book to accompany the series, written by Michael Wood and published by BBC Worldwide Ltd in 2003. My comments relate to the video, except where I explicitly refer to the book. 2. Also circulated on video as William Shakespeare, His Life and Times (1978). 3. Everyman, in A. C. Cawley (ed.) (1956), Everyman and Medieval Mystery Plays, London: Dent, ll. 523–4. 4. Wood is normally quite factually scrupulous. The gaps in his knowledge tend to show most around theatrical history. For example, when in the final episode he discusses the acquisition of the Blackfriars theatre by the King’s Men, he seems not to know that James Burbage had converted the playing space there as early as 1596, and that the Children of the Revels had been playing there since 1599/1600. He also gives the date of the burning of the first Globe as 1614 when it was actually 1613. The book is more secure on both these points, but becomes oddly confused whenever it deals with Ben Jonson. For example, it is under the impression that he was working exclusively for Shakespeare’s company around 1599/1600 (p. 227), which is just not true; and it bizarrely suggests that he ‘perhaps lampoons Lovewhit [sic] in Volpone’ (p. 315). Lovewit actually appears in The Alchemist, and it is very doubtful that he lampoons anyone. In the book Wood is also confused (p. 266) about the distribution of roles in masques between courtiers (who were almost invariably non-speakers) and professional actors. Other notable slips include having Shakespeare ‘influenced by the debate over “humours” in Burton’s Anatomy of Melancholy’ (p. 240), which was not published until 1621, and describing Samuel Harsnett – then a lowly chaplain to the Bishop of London, even if he did eventually become Archbishop of York – as ‘a Privy Councillor’ (p. 276). But these are rare blemishes amid much solid historical research. 5. Again, the book is more circumspect: ‘in 1595 or 1596, A Midsummer Night’s Dream was played, perhaps before the queen at court in Greenwich’ (p. 161). He is apparently thinking about the wedding of William Stanley, sixth Earl of Derby, though there is nothing actually to associate Shakespeare with the Stanleys after the death of William’s brother, Ferdinando, in 1594. 6. As I shall suggest later, this leads to a palpable imbalance of material, especially in Episode Three. 7. Most notably in his Secret Shakespeare (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2004). 8. If it was the real document, it was presumably brought over from Preston Record Office for the occasion. But it looks so much more authentic in the Great Hall of Hoghton Tower. I should acknowledge that Richard Wilson and I were colleagues for many years at Lancaster University, and that I was one of those who organised a Lancastrian Shakespeare conference in 1999, partly held at Hoghton Tower.\n\n30 Richard Dutton 9. The Hoghton theory receives far less prominence in the book than in the series, because of a recent article by Robert Bearman (‘ “Was William Shakespeare William Shakeshafte” Revisited’, Shakespeare Quarterly, 53 (2002), pp. 83– 94), which demonstrates the prevalence of Shakeshafte as a name in the Preston region. Citing this, Wood claims in his ‘Further Reading’ that ‘the “Shakeshafte” theory has not survived closer scrutiny’ (p. 346). Of course, that very prevalence might explain why Alexander Hoghton would think of Shakespeare as Shakeshafte – just as, in an instance Wood shows, the clerk of the Revels Accounts thought of him as ‘Shaxberd’ – and Bearman is by no means the last word that Wood takes him to be. 10. A word rather favoured in the book, but eschewed on screen. 11. In Episode Four, the response of writers to the accession of James I as a philosopher/poet prince, who had use for their services, is compared to ‘Cool Britannia’. The shelf life of such comparisons is very short. 12. Jonathan Bate (1997), The Genius of Shakespeare, London: Picador, p. 47. 13. Katherine Duncan-Jones (ed.) (1997), Shakespeare’s Sonnets, London: Arden Shakespeare; (2001) Ungentle Shakespeare: Scenes from His Life, London: Arden Shakespeare. 14. Pembroke was a man of Protestant, even Puritan, leanings, which of course does not help the Catholic case. But Wood obviously thinks that a secondary issue in this context. 15. The ‘mortal moon’ has been interpreted in many other ways, including as a reference to the formation of the Spanish Armada, Elizabeth’s survival of the supposed Dr Lopez plot (1594) and her outliving of her ‘climacteric’ year (1596); and while we know that Shakespeare and his fellows were awarded scarlet cloth for James’ entry, there is no concrete evidence that they took part in it. 16. In the book, Wood explicitly describes Lanier as ‘the first woman in England to publish a volume of poetry’ (p. 201). Scholarship now accords Isabella Whitney that honour.\n\nChapter 2\n\n‘I see my father’ in ‘my mind’s eye’: Surveillance and the Filmic Hamlet\n\nMark Thornton Burnett\n\nA recent editorial in The Guardian claims that governments are building ‘a global registration and surveillance infrastructure’ in the ‘US war on terror’. The aim, it is argued, is ‘to monitor the movements and activities of entire populations’ in what has been termed ‘ “an unprecedented project of social control” ’.1 In keeping with the associations of the term ‘warning’ that appears in the header, the report is concerned less with the details of the scheme than with the seeming threat that an increased deployment of surveillance poses to civil liberties. Such a viewpoint makes a logistical sense in the light of the proliferation of surveillance practices that characterises postmodernity. Generally understood as the process of ‘watching over’, surveillance is now routinely evident in almost all aspects of everyday life, making itself felt in the use of credit cards, mobile phones and the internet, in the activities of voting, shopping and working, and in the operations of a range of public and private institutions and organisations, to the extent that the Western world has been dubbed both a ‘maximum security society’ and a ‘superpanopticon’.2 It was not always thus. The late eighteenth-century panopticon, as conceived and designed by English reformist Jeremy Bentham, imagined surveillance embodying itself primarily and ideally in the prison, in which a central tower surrounded by a circular perimeter of cells ensured at all times the visibility of the observed and the invisibility of the observer. This hierarchical discipline, which was modelled on contemporary beliefs in divine omniscience, depended, as Michel Foucault writes, on equations between ‘security and knowledge, individualization and totalization, [and] isolation and transparency’, thereby facilitating the smooth running of an optics of power.3 By contrast, particularly in the wake of 9/11, twenty-first-century forms of surveillance are at once more diffuse and less localised, centred, as they are, not so much upon a single institution as upon plural information flows, multiple social systems and transnational\n\n32 Mark Thornton Burnett information networks. Computers and cameras, rather than specific carceral domains, constitute the new surveillance landscape. In this chapter, I discuss three film versions of Hamlet – Campbell Scott and Eric Simonson’s 2000 release, Michael Almereyda’s cinematic undertaking of the same year, and Stephen Cavanagh’s 2005 Derry Film Initiative screen reading of Shakespeare’s play. First shown on the Odyssey cable channel, Scott and Simonson’s Hamlet is a made-fortelevision production set in the late nineteenth century and inspired by the heritage industry; in contrast, Almereyda’s work represents a millennial, modern New York scene and is defined by its appeal to the arthouse market. The Derry Film Initiative is a grassroots, collaborative organisation directed towards the development of a film industry in the north-west of Ireland, and its Hamlet appears as a raw, visceral feature urgently attuned to, and making extensive use of, politicised, present-day Londonderry locations. Differences notwithstanding, these films come together in being absorbed by, and endeavouring to tease out the implications of, postmodern surveillance practices. The play’s concern with spying cedes place to a filmic grammar of looking and looks, to a visual regime in which surveillance is everywhere apparent. Such a filmic translation is sufficiently flexible, moreover, to allow for cross-reference and reflection: each Hamlet, for instance, invokes the prison and gestures towards the trajectory that has shaped surveillance in its various historical incarnations. Traversing the institutional and technological means whereby surveillance is organised, the filmic Hamlets of the twenty-first century are acutely self-conscious in contemplating how, where and with what ideological effects the gaze originates. In this sense, they begin the process of mediating the connections binding surveillance and cinema, and implicitly conclude by suggesting that, in a terror-haunted world, film itself might constitute an optical disciplinary mechanism.\n\nI Because Campbell Scott and Eric Simonson’s Hamlet (2000) uses Hempstead House, a magisterial Long Island residence constructed in 1912 by the Gould family, for its exteriors and interiors, the film immediately presents itself as surveillantly preoccupied. Designed in the style of a Tudor manor house, the property is dominated by two towers, which, within and without, allow for a range of observational opportunity. Maximum advantage is taken of a series of linked central halls which give onto each other, of banisters that permit wide-angle glimpses of the main staircase, and of eyelets in the Gothic stonework of\n\n‘I see my father’ in ‘my mind’s eye’ 33 the reception rooms; as a result, occasions both public and private become subject to scrutiny, and points of view assume an inquisitorial, inquisitive uniformity. Interior panopticism is matched by exterior surveillance suggestions: throughout, the film privileges shots of gargoyles that adorn the house’s façade. Samuel Crowl writes that this ornamental stonework ‘suggests the pressure of the ancient past’, yet alternative interpretations come into play if we note the ways in which particular gargoyles are punctuationally deployed.4 Thus, the countenance of a grave knight acts as a prelude to the appearance of the ghost; the figure of a jester marks the transition to Polonius; and the form of a fanged demon announces Ophelia’s descent into madness. The effect, bolstered in part by upward shots that prioritise downward-looking gargoyles, is to suggest that all of the players are moulded according to surveillance modes: figuratively, each cast member is possessed of a deity – or nemesis – who watches over individualised segments of the proceedings. These surveillant forces are equally connotative of eventual extinction and subsequent memorialisation; in their stony and eroded passivity, the gargoyles bring skulls to mind and thus serve as predictive observers of mortality, of an action that has been foreseen before it has taken place. Camera work functions finally to construct an illusion of the gargoyles ringing the house, and this is taken up in a more general enlistment of 360° pans, which, particularly in the opening scene, sweep around the guards, reinforcing an impression both of constriction and an encircling eye. To be looked at in Scott and Simonson’s Hamlet is, it seems, synonymous with being incarcerated. But surveillance is not identically applied; it is also gendered and hierarchised. A pronounced sense of a controlling, entrenched and authorised vision is embodied in Claudius’ (Jamey Sheridan) line that Hamlet should remain in ‘the cheer and comfort of our eye’; because the sentiment is preceded by a scene in which Polonius (Roscoe Lee Browne) inspects and then burns legal papers, the implication is that the King’s public role depends upon private servants who function both as his eyes and executioners.5 In this construction of Elsinore, then, although surveillance is a common denominator, carefully gradated levels of power define its ownership and extent. Crucially, Hamlet (Campbell Scott) himself is invariably excluded from surveillance’s operations, as when he is filmed against portraits of his father, uncle and mother: he is discovered as metaphorically overseen by this trinity of the ruling elite, which suggests that, even at the level of inanimate representation, the protagonist is a target of enquiry. The symbolic import of the images is crystallised when Hamlet takes down from the wall the\n\n34 Mark Thornton Burnett portrait of Claudius, only to find that he has accidentally pinioned himself beneath it: despite the comic hubris of the episode, vividly realised here is the notion that the prince is in thrall to, and dominated by, the King’s gaze, and in such a way that he is rendered immobile. A parallel scene of the visual enforcement of inaction occurs when Polonius announces, ‘Perpend, I have a daughter’ (II.ii.105–6), and opens a door to reveal Ophelia (Lisa Gay Hamilton) standing in the neighbouring hall. The interpolated sequence discovers a silent Ophelia spectated upon by her father, Claudius and Gertrude (Blair Brown): she is depicted as aware of being looked at but unable to rebuff the examination, with her physical impassivity reinforcing a sense of her objectified utility. Indeed, in the spatial economy of the film, Hamlet and Ophelia are frequently dovetailed. Both are glimpsed looking through the latticed windows of their rooms as if yearning for something beyond their perimeters: the parallel montage is vital in constructing a kinship between the characters at the same time as it suggests the existence of a defended state composed of separate gaol-like units. The difference between Hamlet and Ophelia in Scott and Simonson’s film, however, is that the latter remains within the purview of the court while the former attempts to break out. Incorporating a number of Hamlet’s visual motifs, including windows, the representation of the protagonist’s ‘To be or not to be’ soliloquy is both thematically resonant and dramatically energetic. Unsuccessful in finding solace in the book he is reading, Hamlet smashes his spectacles on a table and proceeds to cut himself with a sliver of glass as he intones the famous words. At once the episode harks back to the second appearance of the Ghost and its bloody seizure of the sword from Hamlet’s hands: the recapitulation of the image of a mutilated body emphasises a recurring bond between father and son that expresses itself in injured corporeal extremity. But, in the same moment, the scene of Hamlet’s self-laceration signifies a paradoxical attempt to achieve clarity of insight by breaking the forms of visual technology. Physically, within the film’s fiction, Hamlet will move beyond a political apparatus of seeing and illusions through suicide; symbolically, he will counter the practice of Claudius’ regime by smashing its optical manifestations and instruments. That Hamlet’s ‘To be or not to be’ soliloquy leads to no obvious change in his circumstances is testimony to the inflexibility of the state’s investment in surveillance. For, throughout the film, surveillance methods and measures are abundantly in evidence, as when the camera lingers over the magnifying glass displayed on Polonius’ desk or when the cupboard that is deployed to eavesdrop upon Hamlet becomes the\n\n‘I see my father’ in ‘my mind’s eye’ 35 coffin in which the counsellor is temporarily ‘stowed’ (IV.ii.1). Even the Ghost (Byron Jennings) appears complicit, all too often entering the narrative accompanied by gusts and whispers that represent uncannily aural and acoustic surveillance signatures. In the light of the film’s surveillant emphasis, and its intermittent reorganisation of the narrative structure, linguistic features that in the play are specific in their range of meaning take on an added depth of reference. The ‘To be or not to be’ soliloquy, for instance, is repositioned so that it comes before the ironic exchange between Hamlet and Polonius, with the effect that the protagonist’s designation of the counsellor as ‘honest’ (II.ii.176) appears a barbed and accusatory charge. The suggestion, reinforced by the film’s staging, is that Hamlet knowingly performs his reflections upon suicide for an unseen audience even as he is simultaneously engaged in addressing an interiorised agenda. ‘Honest’, in this context, is translatable as ‘practising surveillance’, the term illuminating not so much an (early modern) sense of sexual morality as a (postmodern) idea of visual machination and political intrigue. ‘To speak to you like an honest man’, Hamlet announces to Rosencrantz (Michael Imperioli) and Guildenstern (Marcus Giamatti) soon afterwards, ‘I am most dreadfully attended’ (I.ii.268–9). The recapitulation of the term at this point functions to consolidate the surveillant associations of an exchange in which Hamlet berates his ‘good friends’ (II.ii.240) for their part in a system that encloses in order to view and views in order to enclose. Hence, although Hamlet is represented throwing leaves out of an upper conservatory window, he is still, in his own words, in ‘prison’ (II.ii.241) and unable to leave his domestic ‘confines’ (II.ii.245). The point is underscored by the film’s intercutting between Hamlet’s reflections and Hempstead House’s architectural interior features. As Hamlet pauses to extol the ‘brave o’erhanging firmament’ (II.ii.300), for instance, the camera pans to reveal a ceiling criss-crossed with Gothic tracery. This is less an open ‘canopy’ (II.ii.299) than the closed bars of Hamlet’s gilded cage. Or, to put it another way, the pattern on the roof is the psychological analogue to Hamlet’s condition, ‘bounded in a nutshell’ (II.ii.254). Yet "
