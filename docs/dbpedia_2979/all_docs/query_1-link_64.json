Not yet, at least.\n\nWhile the 2023-24 men's college basketball season officially ended on April 8 in Glendale, Arizona, the offseason roster machinations have been busier than the actual season of games. Between the coaching carousel, NBA draft decisions, high school recruitments, the transfer portal -- especially the transfer portal -- and the extra year of eligibility for seniors, the personnel movement around the country has been endless.\n\nKeeping track of the comings and goings has become borderline impossible, but that's where we come in. As we've done the past couple of years, we're sharing all of our roster changes research.\n\nSome of the classifications are self-explanatory, but here's a quick refresher on others.\n\nDeparted or expected to depart: Includes players who declared for the NBA draft, seniors who are not returning and players who have entered the transfer portal.\n\nIn limbo: Includes players whose status is up in the air -- such as those waiting on waiver decisions from the NCAA, or high schoolers who could reclassify into the class of 2024.\n\nExpected to return: Includes players who have confirmed they're returning to school, or haven't yet made other plans.\n\nNewcomer rankings are according to ESPN's recruiting database.\n\nThis page will be constantly updated throughout the offseason. I'm bound to make mistakes or miss some decisions -- particularly when it comes to seniors returning to school -- so point out any errors to me on X (formerly known as Twitter) at @jeffborzello.\n\nLast updated: July 23, 2024\n\nJump to:\n\nACC | Big East | Big Ten | Big 12 | SEC | Other notables\n\nACC\n\nBoston College Eagles\n\nDeparted or expected to depart: Quinten Post (17.0 PPG), Claudell Harris Jr. (13.7 PPG), Jaeden Zackery (11.3 PPG), Devin McGlockton (10.2 PPG), Mason Madsen (8.1 PPG), Prince Aligbe (4.7 PPG), Armani Mighty (0.8 PPG)\n\nIn limbo: None\n\nExpected to return: Donald Hand Jr. (5.0 PPG), Chas Kelley III (3.7 PPG), Elijah Strong (2.7 PPG), Fred Payne (1.6 PPG), Jayden Hastings (redshirt)\n\nIncoming transfers: Dion Brown (19.0 PPG at UMBC), Roger McFarlane (14.8 PPG at SE Louisiana), Chad Venning (13.4 PPG at St. Bonaventure), Josh Beadle (3.0 PPG at Clemson)\n\nIncoming freshmen: Luke Toews (NR), Nick Petronio (NR), Kany Tchanda (four-star)\n\nHead coach: Earl Grant\n\nCalifornia Golden Bears\n\nDeparted or expected to depart: Jaylon Tyson (19.6 PPG), Fardaws Aimaq (14.5 PPG), Jalen Cone (13.4 PPG), Keonte Kennedy (9.3 PPG), Jalen Celestine (8.7 PPG), Devin Askew (6.2 PPG), Grant Newell (5.5 PPG), Rodney Brown Jr. (3.5 PPG), ND Okafor (1.9 PPG), Gus Larson (1.4 PPG), Monty Bowser (0.3 PPG)\n\nIn limbo: None\n\nExpected to return: Vladimir Pavlovic (0.9 PPG), Devin Curtis (0.4 PPG)\n\nIncoming transfers: B.J.
