ANZAC Medal - Crowl-McDonald Medal

St Kilda and Carlton will acknowledge two of their former players with a special Anzac Day medal to be awarded to the best player in the ANZAC day clash. This inaugural match coincided with the 100th anniversary of the Gallipoli landing, will honour all soldiers involved in World War I but with a special emphasis on Claude Crowl (three games with St Kilda) and Fen McDonald (10 games with Carlton and one with Melbourne).

The two men will be honoured with the creation of the Crowl-McDonald medal which will be awarded to the best player in the match. Both men are believed to have died on April 25, 1915 when the Anzacs first stormed the beach at Gallipoli. Their bodies were never found. Incredibly, the two men not only lost their lives on the same day in Gallipoli, they also made their VFL debut against each other at Princes Park on Saturday 29 July, 1911. Six VFL players are believed to have died on April 25 and a further 11 lost their lives in the Gallipoli campaign.

The Crowl-McDonald medal will be voted on by members of the football media who will be attending the match.
