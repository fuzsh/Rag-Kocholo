Metta World Peace has reached agreement on a deal to re-sign with the Los Angeles Lakers, league sources told The Vertical.

World Peace, 36, has been working out daily with the Lakers, and the two sides finalized a contract for training camp on Wednesday.

World Peace, a 16-year NBA veteran, made the Lakersâ€™ roster out of camp last season on a non-guaranteed deal and had an impact on the young roster with his mentorship and practice habits. World Peace averaged five points and 2.5 rebounds in 35 games in 2015-16.

He is expected to compete in camp along with undrafted signings Julian Jacobs and Zach Auguste and forward Travis Wear.

World Peace played for the Lakers from 2009-2013 and helped the franchise win an NBA championship in 2010. World Peace, formerly known as Ron Artest, was the Defensive Player of the Year and made the Eastern Conference All-Star team in 2004 while playing for the Indiana Pacers.
