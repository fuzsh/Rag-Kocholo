        "text": "The Lakers had long since qualified as one of the most interesting teams of this 2015-16 campaign, what with Kobe Bryant coming back from his latest devastating injury, Julius Randle having a do-over of his rookie season after breaking his leg and Nick Young’s alter ego from the Eastern Conference, Lou Williams, getting added to this purple and gold concoction.\n\nBut now Metta World Peace is back in Laker Land, and this much is official about coach Byron Scott’s crew: you’ll want to watch, even if it’s not solely because of the basketball. Talk about a personality party.\n\nTime will tell if World Peace can still play, as his last NBA action came on Feb. 21, 2014 (while with the New York Knicks) and his time since then has been spent playing in China and Italy. Lakers general manager Mitch Kupchak clearly liked what he’d seen over the summer, when World Peace worked out in his team’s facility and spent extensive time with Randle in the process.\n\nBut the potential impact in the locker room here could be huge for the Lakers, who have made it clear they’re trying to pull off the trickiest of magic acts this season: develop the many young talents that will be part of their post-Bryant future, while competing at a high enough level to – as Kupchak told USA TODAY Sports recently – push for a playoff spot in what is likely Kobe’s last season. Say what you will about whether or not that should be the goal, but World Peace makes all kinds of sense once you accept the fact that it is.\n\nWorld Peace, who now becomes the only other current member of the Lakers’ last championship team (2009-10), has always had a good relationship with Bryant. And with Scott needing to convince his future Hall of Famer to not overshadow the younger generation as he tries to go out on a strong note, the Lakers will need another respected, older-head voice in the room to help with that cause. World Peace, whose maturation from his infamous days in Indiana has been an impressive sight to see, can be that guy.\n\nThe part about World Peace’s role and where he fits in isn’t quite so easy to predict. But as I discussed recently with Lakers beat writers Bill Oram and Mark Medina, the early handicap on the lineup looked like this: rookie D’Angelo Russell at the point guard spot, with second-year talent Jordan Clarkson at shooting guard, Bryant at small forward, Brandon Bass at power forward (Randle behind him) and newly-added center Roy Hibbert in the middle.\n\nConsidering the complicated dynamic between Scott and Young, it’s plausible that World Peace could earn his new coach’s confidence and find himself taking reserve minutes from the 30-year-old whose future with the Lakers has been murky for quite some time now. Williams, after all, is a reigning Sixth Man of the Year who didn’t sign a three-year, $21 million deal with the Lakers during the summer with the hopes of sharing that role as the primary bench scorer.\n\nThe Laker Nation may not be what it used to be, in other words, but there’s plenty to watch here indeed."
