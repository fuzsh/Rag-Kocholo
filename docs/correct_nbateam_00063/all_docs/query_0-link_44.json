        "text": "LOS ANGELES – Shortly after Metta World Peace entered the locker room, his Lakers teammates swarmed him.\n\nAfter serving as a mentor for much of the past two seasons, the 37-year-old forward flashed some of the skills he once demonstrated in his prime, when he was known as Ron Artest. So with the Lakers’ 108-96 victory over the New Orleans Pelicans on Tuesday possibly marking World Peace’s last game at Staples Center, his teammates appeared eager to highlight the historical significance.\n\nNick Young asked World Peace to sign his boxscore after he posted a team-high 18 points with four rebounds and four steals. Other teammates asked for autographs, too, before they doused him with ice water.\n\n“It was freezing. I was in shock. I could’ve died,” said World Peace, who was 7 for 17 from the field, including 4 for 10 from 3-point range. “It was a great feeling, though. I’m not going to lie.”\n\nAfter all, the Lakers held a similar ritual for Kobe Bryant after he posted 60 points on 50 field-goal attempts in his career finale nearly a year ago. There was one significant difference in the aftermath, though, when it came to how they celebrated.\n\n“Kobe got Dom Pérignon,” World Peace said, grinning. “I got ice water.”\n\nLast year, the Lakers celebrated the retiring Bryant, who had won five NBA titles and climbed to third place on the league’s all-time scoring list. This year, the Lakers commemorated World Peace, at one time one of the league’s most accomplished defenders who had to undergo a career makeover after receiving the longest suspension in NBA history for brawling in the stands at a Pacers-Pistons game in November 2004.\n\nWorld Peace became a fan favorite with the Lakers following his Game 7 performance in the 2010 NBA Finals against the Boston Celtics. He stayed with the Lakers until 2013, then spent the next two years in New York, China and Italy before spending the last two seasons as a mentor to the Lakers’ young roster.\n\nBrandon Ingram (15), Jordan Clarkson (15), David Nwaba (14), Julius Randle (11) and Thomas Robinson (10) also scored in double figures as the Lakers established their longest winning streak since 2013. The victory assured the Lakers of finishing ahead of Phoenix with the league’s third-worst record, giving them less than a 50 percent chance of keeping their top three-protected first-round draft pick. But the spotlight was on World Peace as the crowd celebrated the final on-court link to the Lakers’ 16th championship team.\n\n“There was a lot of joy in my heart watching Metta have that much fun playing,” said Coach Luke Walton, who played with him from 2009 to 2012. “For what he’s done for us this year, the personal relationship we have as well, and the fans were incredible, absolutely incredible.”\n\nThose fans cheered World Peace at nearly every opportunity. They cheered him when public address announcer Lawrence Tanter announced him as a starter, replacing D’Angelo Russell (grieving his late grandmother in Louisville, Ky.). They cheered anytime World Peace touched the ball, and when he checked out with 6:28 left, Walton said he “had goosebumps” as he listened to fans chant World Peace’s first name and give him a standing ovation.\n\n“I’m sure the Monks would’ve been proud,” joked World Peace, whose 1,716th and 1,717th career steals moved him past Ron Harper for 22nd place in NBA history.\n\nThe Lakers were also proud of what happened at the end of the game.\n\nWith the chance to cap his night with the last shot of the game, World Peace held the ball while standing at the top of the key. Instead of shooting, World Peace committed a 24-second shot clock violation.\n\n“That’s tricky,” Walton said. “You don’t want to disrespect the other team at all. That’s why Metta did it.”\n\nAfter saying he “didn’t have a reason to” shoot with the Lakers (26-55) only seconds away from their fifth consecutive win, World Peace said he had another reason to hold the ball.\n\n“Honestly, I got tired,” he said. “I didn’t play in a long time.”\n\nThe veteran entered Wednesday’s game averaging only 1.6 points and shooting 24.4 percent from the field 5.4 minutes per game (23 appearances). Walton played him significantly more minutes over the past week.\n\nHe had more motivation to play well against the Pelicans. After listening to Young and former Laker Lou Williams talk trash about his age during training camp last fall, World Peace remained determined this season to climb the Lakers’ leaderboard that calculates drills won in practice. On the final practice, however, World Peace lost to teammate Tarik Black by one point after picking the wrong team for an impromptu dodgeball competition organized by Walton.\n\nSaid World Peace: “I’m so mad about that. No way I should’ve lost. I’m so sick.”\n\nSaid Black: “He accepted his loss very well. I respect him.”\n\nSo, World Peace unleashed his frustration on the Pelicans. After going scoreless in the first half, World Peace had seven points on 3-of-5 shooting in the third quarter. In a one-minute sequence, World Peace sank a 3-pointer, converted a left-handed layup and forced a turnover.\n\n“My game had never been all points even when I was averaging 20-plus a night,” World Peace said. “I was locking up. That’s what I try to do. That’s how I think.”\n\nAfterward, Walton pointed to World Peace’s focus on taking care of his body through diet and abstaining from alcohol. The coach called him a “perfect example of how to be a professional in this league.”\n\n“He loves the game of basketball that much,” Walton said. “He wants to play the game as long as he possibly can because the game is that great.”\n\nSo great that World Peace still wants to play at least two more seasons so he can reach 20 years playing basketball professionally, including one year overseas in China and Italy.\n\n“Obviously I’ll keep working out. My goals haven’t changed,” World Peace said. “But I’m absolutely grateful.”\n\nThe Lakers will not commit to bringing him back until they focus on more significant offseason decisions with their roster. World Peace understands that pecking order.\n\n“I won’t be able to make any decision until everybody else in the NBA makes their decisions,” World Peace said. “I’m the last on the list.”\n\nBut instead of making contingency plans to play overseas or become involved in coaching after helping the Palisades High boys and girls teams in recent years, World Peace said he will wait.\n\n“It’s a little bit too early. I don’t want to put anybody on the spot,” World Peace said. “I really don’t. It’s not my time anymore. Can I contribute? Absolutely. It’s another era. It’s other people’s time. Whether I’m good enough or better than whoever isn’t really important. It’s hard to speak about that. Then maybe I say something I shouldn’t be saying at this point in time.”\n\nWhen the Lakers signed World Peace to a one-year deal in 2015-16, former general manager Mitch Kupchak told him he had a 50 percent chance of making the roster. When the Lakers signed him last summer, Kupchak predicted he had a 10 percent chance of making it. World Peace survived the cuts both times.\n\n“You give me a 1 percent, you may as well give me the spot,” World Peace said.\n\nHe produced effectively enough when granted additional playing time. While Walton chalked that up to World Peace “getting more of an opportunity,” the veteran also kept himself sharp partly by outworking everyone in practice.\n\n“That’s why I’m able to run every sprint, every suicide and finish among the top of the leaderboard in practice and (sub in) in the fourth quarter without playing and still play decent,” World Peace said. “I don’t play all season, but I get in the game and still do okay.”\n\nWorld Peace missed his last four shots, something Walton blamed on teammates “throwing him the ball and iso-ing.” But that did not sour the collective mood.\n\n“Part of it was definitely Metta, but it’s fun to coach these guys when they’re playing the way they played the last few weeks,” Walton said. “They’re playing with passion and playing to compete. When that is happening, you can sit back and enjoy that.”\n\nOnce it ended, World Peace sat back and enjoyed his teammates soaking him with water. He kept the game ball by his locker to remind himself of a special moment.\n\n“I’m going to get everybody to sign it. I’m going to frame it,” World Peace said. “I had a great time winning the championship. There’s no feeling like that, but to be at the foundation at the start of something and you know it’s on the way up, I feel good about that. It’s one of the highlights of my career.”"
