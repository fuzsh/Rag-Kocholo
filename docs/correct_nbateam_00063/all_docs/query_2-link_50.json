        "text": "Metta Sandiford-Artest (né World Peace), formerly known as Ronald William Artest Jr.[2], was a houseguest on Celebrity Big Brother 1 (US).\n\nBiography[]\n\nRetrieved from CBS\n\nAge: 38\n\nHometown: Queens, New York\n\nCurrent city: Los Angeles, California\n\nOccupation: Basketball coach and philanthropist\n\nThree adjectives that describe you: Ambitious, driven, and competitive.\n\nFavorite activities: Being with my kids, being around my kids, and watching boxing.\n\nWhat do you think will be the most difficult part of living inside the Big Brother house?\n\nTrying to find a place to work out!\n\nWhat moment in your career do you think prepared you to live in the Big Brother house?\n\nWhen Kobe passed me the ball during Game 5 of the Western Conference Finals against the Phoenix Suns in 2010!\n\nWhich past Big Brother cast member did you like most?\n\nCan't pick one.\n\nDo you have a strategy for winning the game?\n\nFocusing on and implementing Phil Jackson's teaching methods.\n\nMy life's motto is…\n\nHave fun no matter what you do.\n\nWhat would you take into the house and why?\n\n- My workout equipment so I can stay fit.\n\n- Toothbrush.\n\n- Toothpaste.\n\nFun facts about yourself:\n\n- I love painting on canvases.\n\n- I love looking at art galleries.\n\n- I love going to the beach and sitting in the sand.\n\n- I love telling my kids what to do to get them upset! [3]\n\nPlayer History - Celebrity Big Brother 1 (US)[]\n\nCompetition History[]\n\nWeek 1 HOH Loss HOH Recast Sat Out POV Not Picked Week 2 HOH Loss POV Not Picked HOH Loss POV Not Picked Week 3 HOH Loss VIP POV Loss\n\nFood History[]\n\nCycle 1 Phase Not Active Cycle 2 Cycle 3 Cycle 4 Slop\n\nVoting History[]\n\nDay Position Voted for With Majority? 10 – Chuck Liddell\n\n(accidentally) Yes 13 – Keshia Knight Pulliam Yes 17 – Shannon Elizabeth Yes 20 Post-VIP POV Nominee – – Finale Jury Member Ross Mathews No\n\nPost-Big Brother[]\n\nMetta and fellow CBB1 houseguest Ross Mathews appeared in a What Did They Just Do? segment during the Celebrity Big Brother 2 (US) Double Eviction for the Power of Veto competition.\n\nIn May 2020, Metta got married to Maya Sandiford, and changed his last name from \"World Peace\" to \"Sandiford-Artest,\" hyphenating his wife's last name with his original last name.\n\nIn February 2022, Metta was revealed to be competing on CBS's new show, Beyond The Edge.[4]\n\nMetta appeared in a video home message to his friend and CBB3 houseguest Lamar Odom.\n\nMetta competed in CBS' new series Beyond the Edge, a new reality show similar to Survivor, where celebrities live in the jungle as they try to earn money for their charities, with the option to ring a bell and leave the game at any point in time. Metta chose to ring the bell in Episode 2, being the first person to leave the game in 9th place.\n\nMetta competed on season 10 of The Masked Singer as the Cuddle Monster, a wildcard mask. He was eliminated in episode 7, finishing in 10th place.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nMetta is the first houseguest in Big Brother US history to push the emergency button. The reason being that he wanted to leave the game and had already tried to prior to that incident. The rest of the houseguests ended up on HoH lockdown until the situation was sorted out.\n\nSimilar to Canadian houseguest Topaz Brady, Metta made a mistake with voting. During the first eviction, he thought that he was supposed to say the name of who he wanted to save, so he said \"I vote Chuck,\" and later discovered that it was counted as a vote to evict against Chuck Liddell instead of James Maslow. He is the first US houseguest to make this mistake.\n\nThe difference is that while Topaz's vote was the deciding vote and changed the entire outcome, Chuck would have still been evicted no matter who Metta voted, and that Topaz's mistake was made during finale, while Metta's was during a regular eviction.\n\nSimilarly to how Arisa Cox makes it clear at every Canadian finale after the first season that the Jury is voting for who they want to win, Julie Chen made it clear for Metta as how to vote during the American Celebrity finale.\n\nMetta is the seventh houseguest to ask to be evicted following Karen Fowler, Shannon Dragoo, Mike Malin[5] Lawon Exum, Clay Honeycutt, and fellow CBB houseguest Keshia Knight Pulliam.\n\nReferences[]"
