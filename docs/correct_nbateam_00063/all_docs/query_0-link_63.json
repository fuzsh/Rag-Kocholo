        "text": "In a time of uncertainty surrounding the length of their rebuilding efforts, the Lakers have leaned on a familiar and comforting name.\n\nThey plan to bring back Metta World Peace, who plans to sign with the Lakers on Thursday to a one-year deal for the 2015-16 season, according to a league source familiar with the situation. World Peace plans to take a physical on Friday to finalize the deal. Assuming no complications, World Peace will join the Lakers for their training camp in Hawaii.\n\nWorld Peace helped the Lakers win the 2010 NBA championship during his four seasons here (2009-13) and adds depth to the team’s small forward position.\n\nThe Lakers would not comment on World Peace’s arrival. At a press conference at the Lakers’ practice facility in El Segundo, general manager Mitch Kupchak only said it is a “possibility” World Peace would join the team.\n\nBut World Peace has worked out regularly at the Lakers’ practice facility since July, which have included physical one-on-one matches with Julius Randle.\n\n“It’s great to have him go against Julius,” Kupchak said of World Peace. “Watching those two guys practice, it’s almost comical what they do to each other. I’m not sure who gets the better of it. I would be surprised if either player admitted to any player they hurt more after practice and they did before practice. I could see Julius going home and getting in the tub. But I could see Metta going home and getting in the tub too. But you wouldn’t know because they wouldn’t tell you. They’re both mega competitors.”\n\nBut it remains to be seen how the 17-year-old veteran will thrive in his latest venture. The Lakers waived World Peace in the 2013 offseason through the so-called amnesty provision. Although he soon signed with the New York Knicks, they eventually negotiated a buyout during the 2013-14 season amid a left knee injury and a diminished role. World Peace has since played overseas in the last two years both in China and Italy.\n\n“Clearly, Metta is much closer to the end than he is in the beginning,” Kupchak said. “I know in the half court game and I’ve seen him play in the last six weeks, he can be very effective on the court. But these are scrimmages that last 15-20 minutes. It’s not an 82 game schedule. It’s not a full court NBA game. If we go down that road, training camp would be very important.”\n\nThe 35-year-old World Peace will likely be asked to share his championship experience and defensive expertise toward a crop of the team’s power forwards, including Julius Randle, Brandon Bass Larry Nance Jr. and Ryan Kelly. World Peace’s presence, along with former two-time NBA All-Star Roy Hibbert, could bolster a Lakers defense that finished 29th out of 30 NBA teams last season in that category.\n\nThe Lakers now have 19 players on their roster and can add one more before training camp starts. But the Lakers would need to trim their roster down at least to 15 before the regular season starts. Kupchak said he would not necessarily favor players who have non-guaranteed contracts over guaranteed players. Tarik Black, Jabari Brown, Michael Frazier, Jonathan Holmes and Robert Upshaw have non-guaranteed deals.\n\n“He’d be great in the locker room with young players,” Kupchak said of World Peace. “But we have to be careful not to use a roster spot too early. We have a lot of young kids and we don’t want to put ourselves in a bind by getting 15 roster spots taken and not giving the young kids, who are very talented, a chance to make the team.”\n\nRELATED:\n\nLakers, Metta World Peace have couple conversations about possible return\n\nLakers’ Jordan Clarkson to miss FIBA Asia Championship\n\nMetta World Peace impressed with Julius Randle’s strength"
