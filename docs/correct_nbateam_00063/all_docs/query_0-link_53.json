        "text": "World Peace, who played with the Lakers previously from 2009-2013, spent all of last season out of the NBA playing in both China and Italy, and was largely considered an afterthought to make a return to the NBA after last playing for the New York Knicks in 2013.\n\nFor World Peace, who will turn 36 in November, making the Lakers final roster also likely represents a massive shift in his attitude, as he is thought of as one of the most volatile NBA players in recent memory. Just to refresh your memory, World Peace was the player who incited the \"Malace at the Palace\" incident back in 2004, which resulted in the longest suspension in NBA history.\n\nStill, for MWP it's an impressive feat that he has been able to make it back to the NBA after a year overseas."
