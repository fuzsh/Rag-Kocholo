        "text": "Few basketball players in NBA history have been quite as polarizing as Metta World Peace.\n\nDuring his 17 year career, he played the roles of both hero and villain, from his dagger three-pointer in the closing minutes of Game 7 of the 2010 NBA Finals that helped vault the Lakers to a championship, to serving one of the longest suspensions the NBA has ever handed out after his role in the now infamous “Malice at the Palace” brawl in Detroit. He also cemented himself as one of the league’s best defensive players, earning NBA Defensive Player of the Year honors in 2004, when he also was selected as an All-Star as well as to the All-NBA team.\n\nOff the court, Artest has been an advocate for mental health awareness and has dabbled in reality television and music (he released a rap album in 2006). Now retired as a player and coaching in the NBA’s developmental G-League, World Peace has a new book out in which he opens up about his turbulent upbringing in New York City’s Queensbridge project, his rollercoaster NBA career, his struggles with mental health, and overcoming it all to realize his lifelong dream of being an NBA champion.\n\nGuest:"
