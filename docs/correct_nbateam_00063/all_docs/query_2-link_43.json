        "text": "World Peace isn't expected to be back with the Lakers next season, Mark Medina of the Los Angeles Daily News reports.\n\nAs was the plan since he was signed, World Peace spent the majority of his time with the Lakers as a veteran mentor, seeing action in only 25 games, while averaging just 2.3 points across 6.4 minutes. There's been plenty of talks regarding the fact that World Peace will go into coaching following his playing career, although a final decision on retirement has yet to be made at this point. World Peace remains one of the longest-tenured players in the NBA, with 17 years of experience and would likely find a very small market in a similar role as a veteran mentor if he opted to try and come back for another season with a different team.\n\nWorld Peace started at small forward and scored a team-leading 18 points (7-17 FG, 4-10 3Pt) to go with four rebounds, four steals and one assist across 25 minutes in a 108-96 win over the Pelicans on Tuesday.\n\nWith D'Angelo Russell (personal) away from the team, coach Luke Walton opted to roll with World Peace in a starting role rather than one of the team's younger options. It was likely just a measure to give the 37-year-old a final sendoff in what was perhaps his final career game at Staples Center, and World Peace certainly delivered. After failing to score in the first half, World Peace poured in all 18 of his points after the break to give the Lakers their fifth straight win. World Peace figures to play in Wednesday's season finale against the Warriors, but probably will see his minutes fall back into the teens in the road matchup.\n\nWorld Peace is expected to start at small forward in Tuesday's game against the Pelicans, Mike Trudell of Lakers.com reports.\n\nD'Angelo Russell is away from the team for a personal matter, and it appears coach Luke Walton plans to replace him in the lineup with World Peace, who could be playing the final game of his career at Staples Center. In his only other start this season, World Peace logged just 12 minutes, so despite working with the top unit, he may not be the most intriguing DFS play. In addition to World Peace, Russell's minutes figure to be spread among Tyler Ennis, Jordan Clarkson and David Nwaba."
