        "text": "Metta World Peace, formerly Ron Artest, joined the show to talk about playing in China and the chances hell return to the NBA.\n\nWorld Peace explained why he chose to play there. I always wanted to play in China, World Peace said. The last five years Ive sacrificed my individual skills. I decided I wanted to get my individual game back. Ive always wanted to play in China, but not when Im 40.\n\nWorld Peace said a lot of teams didnt know he could play any more because he was on the bench in New York. But World Peace said hes playing great and he expects to come back to the NBA at some point.\n\nWorld Peace had interesting opinions on LeBron. I wish he had kept the weight on, World Peace said. They look fatigued. …. They look my age."
