        "text": "16-year NBA veteran small forward Metta World Peace has agreed to a new deal to return to the Los Angeles Lakers for the 2016-17 NBA season.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers are coming off their worst season ever, a 17-win 2015-16 campaign that saw Kobe Bryant ride off into the sunset on a 50-point performance against the Utah Jazz on the final day of the season.\n\nLos Angeles has a new head coach in former Laker and Golden State Warriors top assistant Luke Walton. He’ll need some much-needed veteran leadership to help guide possibly the worst team in the NBA’s Western Conference in his first year at the helm of the Lakers.\n\nWalton gets some help by having NBA veteran small forward Metta World Peace come back into the fold in 2016-17. Shams Charania of The Vertical at Yahoo! Sports reports that World Peace will re-sign with the Lakers.\n\nWorld Peace has been with the Lakers five of the last seven seasons. He won his only NBA Championship to date with the 2009-10 Lakers. He has spent a little more than a third of his NBA career with the Los Angeles basketball franchise.\n\nBy re-signing World Peace, Walton has himself essentially a player/coach. World Peace still plays hard at age 36 and was one of the best perimeter defenders in the game in his prime. Defensive prowess will help this young Lakers team accelerate in their rebuilding process.\n\nKeeping a savvy veteran like World Peace around gives the Lakers another elder voice to help guide this young team. World Peace, Luol Deng and Timofey Mozgov will provide leadership for this young corps in 2016-17. Signing World Peace was a wise move for the Lakers front office to make.\n\nMore from FanSided\n\nThis article originally appeared on"
