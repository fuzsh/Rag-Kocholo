        "text": "Metta World Peace is known for many things.\n\nThe former Los Angeles Lakers forward — the man that coaching legend Phil Jackson called the “most valuable player” of the Lakers’ Game 7 victory in the 2010 NBA Finals — was a Defensive Player of the Year, All-Star, All-NBA selection and J. Walter Kennedy Citizenship Award winner during his 17-year playing career.\n\nBut now, he’s adding something else to his long list of accomplishments — entrepreneur of a startup app.\n\nThe long-time NBA veteran formerly known as “Ron Artest” will pitch his hoops-based application platform — titled “XvsX Sports” — at the NextUp StartUp Showcase this Thursday on May 20 at noon EDT.\n\n“XvsX Sports” is described as a “one-stop platform for basketball players to find organized games and leagues, connect with players and gain exposure to turning pro.” The app gives users access to media and stats and makes it easier to become a recognized competitive basketball player and influencer athlete.\n\nThe idea of the application initially came about in 2014.\n\n\"I'm a deep basketball guy,” said the former NBA champion. “No basketball player should go without having a home. And a home is to play competitively. And when you don't have that, you become depressed. That's where this idea came from.\"\n\n“No basketball player should go unnoticed or without opportunity,” World Peace concludes.\n\nFurthermore, the app serves as a connector in the basketball world, building community and social relationships.\n\nEssentially, think of it as an Airbnb for hoops players.\n\n\"I was trying to find ways to stay involved in basketball,” says World Peace. “Coaching, in particular. This gave me a huge opportunity to coach. Building a platform like this.\"\n\n\"Not many players have a home that they can go to as a basketball player — strictly for basketball,” continues World Peace. “Especially for competitive basketball. At the pro level, you have your elite players and your mediocre players. At the recreational level, you have the same exact thing. So how can you give a recreational player who is elite, a different experience than one who is not elite? That's how I'm thinking about this.\"\n\nThe NextUp Startup Showcase can be described as a “shark-tank like” pitching session. World Peace will be one of three startups pitched at the showcase.\n\nThe 41-year-old will try to raise further capital and investments in his innovative app idea — which has raised roughly $1.25 million thus far. But the pandemic stalled things for the startup application.\n\n\"The company launched in January,” says World Peace. “During the pandemic, we were set to go into a bridge round. We had investors from the Los Angeles Times and multiple investors from the tech industry such as Charles Jolley, Mark Tluszcz, Brad O'Neill and others.”\n\n“When the pandemic hit around March 10 of last year, we were set to raise another $3 million to raise the company to the next level,” explains the former NBA champion. “When the pandemic hit, investors were saying 'people can't play outdoors. They can't play anywhere.'”\n\nThe hope is to continue to expand the application’s reach. Since launching beta testing in January of this year, the application has been centered in the Los Angeles area, where it currently has roughly 4,000 users. Other notable regions nearby such as Phoenix, Fresno and San Diego have had access to the application in its early stages.\n\n\"There's many things that we sell. It's a culture that we set. If we can raise a little more capital, get more partners, this is going to be groundbreaking stuff,\" says World Peace.\n\nThe feedback so far from the players involved has been positive.\n\n“The players love it. The app is the platform,” says World Peace. “You have a chance to compete (as a player). We just had two influencers show up. Ryan Garcia played in a game because of the experience. We had Larry 'Bone Collector' Williams, Grayson 'The Professor\" Boucher. We had Chris Staples, dunk contest winner coming through and more. These are just celebrities that love to ball. We give a different experience where we have rules where everybody abides by the rules.”\n\nWorld Peace will also launch a podcast — likely by the end of June — to support the application. The podcast will feature athletes, entertainers and entrepreneurs as guests. At the same time, the podcast will center on topics in sports, business, mental health and community.\n\nThe former basketball star stresses that he’s all in on this business. Even though he’s not a developer, he is taking on many different responsibilities when it comes to building the application.\n\n“I stopped coaching in the NBA. This is it. It has to be,” says World Peace. “I even stopped doing investor relations and started focusing on building the business.”\n\nThe former NBA champion will also launch another project in June — the Gold League. This will support the “XvsX Sports” application and will be the first “league” of the platform.\n\nThe platform will utilize special game rules — which World Peace can’t reveal at this time — while emphasizing strategy by coaches and players. It will also incentivize semi-pro and competitive recreational hoops players with a cash grand prize.\n\nWorld Peace’s love of basketball culminated in a playing career that spanned nearly two decades and even a coaching stint within the Lakers organization.\n\nNow, it may culminate in further success — this time as an entrepreneur and businessman."
