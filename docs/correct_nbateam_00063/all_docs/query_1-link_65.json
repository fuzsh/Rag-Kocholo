        "text": "The Huskies have been on top of the collegiate basketball world over the past two seasons, and Hurley’s stock has skyrocketed accordingly. But beyond his deep knowledge of game planning and designing plays, the Lakers might be looking to bring Hurley in for his ability to develop young talent, which would work well should the team decide to choose Bronny on draft night. “You’re gonna have to grow your young players. The idea of Bronny James in the Lakers; who better, potentially, than Dan Hurley, to be the development coach to lead his growth? [He’s a] coach who’s really dominated the college sport. You talk about Xs and Os acumen, player development… from day one of this Lakers search, it has been Dan Hurley,” Adrian Wojnarowski said via UNSPORTSMANLIKE Radio on ESPN.\n\nMetta World Peace excludes Kobe Bryant from GOAT conversation\n\nAccording to him, Kobe Bryant is disqualified from the GOAT conversation because he wanted to win his 6th championship badly and forced games instead of allowing wins to come naturally. Discussing the ongoing debate, Metta offered insights into LeBron James’s potential to claim the GOAT title once his career concludes, acknowledging James’s exceptional versatility and accomplishments. “I think when LeBron’s career over, I think when you crunch all the numbers, it’s going to read LeBron number one,” he continued. “He did what he had to do and Wilt Chamberlain had numbers, he played 13 seasons. Mike got six [championships]. Mike did what he had to do. Bron did what he had to do.”\n\nMetta World Peace on Victor Wembanyama: He will score 100 points at some point in his career\n\nThere is so much in store for Victor Wembanyama as he develops that it will be exciting to witness but is a 100-plus point game in his future? Former NBA player Metta World Peace believes that will happen for the Spurs rookie. “I do believe he will score 100 points at some point in his career,” Peace said on Los Angeles Spectrum SportsNet Live. “I think he will be the first one. Maybe 101 (points). I think he will get there maybe in about his eighth season.”\n\nPeace added that Wemby will fill out his body, and can see in him facing a lowly NBA team and will just score at will. “He’ll play against one of these old-school Clippers-type teams. Not the 2024 Clippers but you know the 1999 Clippers-type teams. Maybe there’s a team down there and he just goes in the red. 101 points,” he said.\n\nMetta World Peace was revealed on Wednesday as the latest celebrity to participate in Season 10 of “The Masked Singer.” He appeared on the show as the Cuddle Monster, performing “You Got It (The Right Stuff),” by New Kids on the Block."
