        "text": "The Lakers have shouted three memorable words during huddles. They yelled the same thing after an upset win last week against Golden State.\n\n“I love basketball!!!” the Lakers have shouted endlessly.\n\nThe slogan goes beyond a cheesy phrase invoking nostalgia for the Lakers’ profession. Lakers forward Metta World Peace also said those words when he entered last week’s game in Indiana for spot minutes while Timofey Mozgov left with an injury.\n\nSince then, World Peace’s phrase has resonated with his teammates and become a filter on the Lakers’ Snapchat account.\n\n“They enjoy it. But I told them they better watch out,” Lakers coach Luke Walton said before Sunday’s game against the Phoenix Suns at Staples Center. “I hope Metta’s not having a bad day. If they keep messing with him, he might end up hurting one of them.”\n\nIt hardly seems World Peace ever has a bad day. He considered it “cool” the Lakers have repeated his phrase. World Peace found it “funny” that Walton instructed his teammates not to tease him too much. And World Peace praised Lakers second-year guard D’Angelo Russell for leading the movement.\n\n“He’s accepting the veterans teaching him how to lead. He’s not saying, ‘This is my team’ and not taking feedback,” World Peace said. “He’s taken a lot of feedback. It’s really good. That’s something he wanted to do.”\n\nRussell suggested the same thing, saying, “When you say ‘D’Angelo and leadership’ and all that, there’s so many more guys that stepped up to the plate to bring that. It’s not just me.”\n\nRegardless, World Peace found the gesture a positive reflection on how the Lakers have tried to grow by mixing work with playfulness.\n\n“We really believe we can get somewhere special this year,” World Peace said. “We want to have fun and not let it affect our play. We talked about that early. Whoever is on the floor is having fun and playing a great time.”\n\nBecoming mindful\n\nThe explanation usually traces back to some detailed analysis on mastering game film or becoming more familiar with NBA personnel. Instead, Suns coach and former UCLA standout Earl Watson attributed Phoenix ranking fifth out of 30 NBA teams in perimeter defense (31.3 percent) toward holding weekly yoga sessions.\n\n“When we get into late game situations, we don’t panic,” Watson said. “We’ve been connected in all kinds of different ways.”\n\nWatson, a former 12-year NBA player after starring at UCLA from 1997 to 2001, first took yoga and pilates classes around 2006 after learning former NBA guard Jason Kidd credited that regimen toward his longevity.\n\nAfter wishing he focused on improving his breathing, mobility and mindfulness earlier, Watson vowed he would feature that as part of his coaching instruction.\n\n“I slept well at nights, so it became an addiction for me,” Watson said. “It became a spiritual high. It’s an amazing connection.”\n\nGiving back\n\nAfter accomplishing plenty as a former Lakers player and executive, Golden State Warriors advisor Jerry West received the Bill Sharman Humanitarian award on Saturday for his various charitable efforts.\n\nSan Pedro-based Sharefest hosted an auction with proceeds helping local youth with mentors and resources. Sharman’s widow, Joyce, chaired the event and presented the award named after the late Hall of Fame Lakers executive and coach. .\n\n“I don’t like to be honored and thanked for the things that I’ve done,” said West, who also has supported a reading center at his alma mater at West Virginia University. “But it’s amazing to interact with some of these kids who haven’t had a chance in life. Watching these young people get up here is unbelievably impressive. To Sharefest and the people involved, please don’t stop helping disadvantaged children.”"
