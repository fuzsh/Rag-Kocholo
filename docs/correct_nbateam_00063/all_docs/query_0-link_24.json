        "text": "Former NBA player Metta World Peace recently ignited a social media frenzy with his thoughts on the 2024 MVP race. Following the infamous ‘Malice at the Palace’ Ron Artest’s legacy was in danger. The former All-Star and defensive wing found his second wind with the Lakers and even bagged his only championship with the Purple and Gold. Yet, 14 years later, the 2010 NBA champion weighed in on the current MVP race, favoring a star from the other team in Los Angeles.\n\nMetta World Peace, also known as Metta Sandiford-Artest, recently picked Los Angeles Clippers star Kawhi Leonard as a potential pick for the 2024 MVP title. Despite being 32 years old, ‘The Klaw’ has continued to showcase remarkable skills on both ends of the court. While Leonard has proved why he is worth every praise directed toward him, Metta World Peace also commended the entire Clippers team. “Kawhi can potentially get the mvp also . @LAClippersmade history. Wow,” wrote the Los Angeles Lakers legend.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nMetta World Peace was one of the best in the Lakers back in 2010 when he impressed the Lakers fans with his clutch performance. Certainly, the fans might have been upset with his support of the rivals. But can you blame the former Lakers star?\n\nKawhi Leonard bolstered the Clippers to their 4th straight win last night, notching up a 149-144 win over the Atlanta Hawks. On their recent road trip, the Clippers have beaten the Celtics, Pistons, Heat and now, the Hawks.\n\nKawhi Leonard scored 36 points to close out the Atlanta Hawks\n\nWhile James Harden had 30 points and 10 assists, Kawhi Leonard put up an impressive 36-point contribution against the Atlanta Hawks. In the previous game against Miami, the 32-year-old small forward dished out 25 points, 11 rebounds and 4 assists. There’s no doubt about the production of ‘The Klaw’. What worries fans is his health.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nWatch This Story: 7x Champ Drags Damian Lillard After Stan Van Gundy’s ‘Ridiculous’ Comments on Anthony Davis Making NBA Top-75 Over Dwight Howard\n\nIf Leonard can maintain the same synergy with his teammates and the Los Angeles Clippers, Metta World Peace’s prediction might as well come true. What are the MVP chances for Kawhi Leonard? Along with 24.4 points, 3.7 assists, 6.4 rebounds, Leonard has also been averaging 1.7 steals and 0.9 blocks this season.\n\n‘The Klaw’ is showing his brilliance on the court, extending the Clippers’ impressive win streak.
