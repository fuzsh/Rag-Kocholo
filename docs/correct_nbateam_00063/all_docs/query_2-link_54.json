        "text": "With Metta World Peace set to make his debut in the BIG3 league Friday, he will play under his given name, Ron Artest.\n\nBut he told USA TODAY Sports he’s not exactly sure why he’ll be wearing a jersey with “Artest’’ on the back more than seven years after he legally changed his name.\n\nWorld Peace agreed to do it at the request of rapper Ice Cube, co-founder of the 3-on-3 league entering its second season.\n\n“Ice Cube wanted to do it,\" World Peace said. “I don’t know why. He just asked me. I was like, ‘No worries.’\"\n\nMore: 2018 NBA mock draft 4.0: Kings snag Marvin Bagley III, Michael Porter Jr. stays in top 5\n\nDuring an interview with USA TODAY Sports at the BIG3 draft in April, Ice Cube cleared up the mystery of why he preferred World Peace play as Ron Artest. Well, sort of.\n\n“You turn back the clock a little bit, you know?\" Ice Cube said. “Three-on-three is a grown man’s game, you know? Strong ball versus long ball, so, Ron Artest.\"\n\nArtest, a 6-foot-7 forward, legally changed his name to Metta World Peace in September 2011. At the time, he said he did it because he wanted to inspire and bring together youth around the world.\n\nIn Buddhism, Metta means loving-kindness.\n\nArtest, 38, last played in the NBA during the 2016-17 season as a reserve for the Los Angeles Lakers. In the BIG3, he will play for the Killer 3s along with Stephen Jackson, one of Artest’s former teammates on the Indiana Pacers."
