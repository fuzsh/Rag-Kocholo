        "text": "You may not have heard much of Metta World Peace since his departure from the NBA to China during the offseason, but don’t worry—he’s still as eccentric (read: insane) as ever. See, shortly after arriving in China, World Peace discovered his affinity for everything Panda related. We think they’re cute too, but he’s essentially adopted the black and white bear as his personal spirit animal. He even said he’s changing his name (again) to \"The Panda’s Friend.\" Now, the baller formerly known as Ron Artest has announced that during his season with the Sichuan Blue Whales, he will wear shoes with a teddy panda bear fastened to them (he took to Twitter to clarify that the bears are not detachable just to prove how committed he is). Sure, this isn’t the first time we’ve seen such a thing, but we can’t recall a time when someone ever hit the hardwood in some Jeremy Scotts. Oh, and the best part? They’ll be on sale tomorrow at mettaworldpeace.com."
