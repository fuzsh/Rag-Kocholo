Ireland Under-20s head coach Mike Ruddock believes his side are raring to go for Friday’s opening RBS 6 Nations game against Wales in Athlone.

Blaina-born Ruddock, Wales national team coach from 2004-2006, will put allegiances aside for the clash at Dubarry Park as Ireland look to hit the ground running.

The last meeting between the two teams saw David Doyle score a dramatic injury-time try to snatch a 26-26 draw last March.

And Ruddock can’t wait to go in search of claiming the sole spoils this week.

“We are all looking forward to the start of the Six Nations,” said Ruddock. “It is always a tough test against Wales but preparations have been first class.

“We are confident we have prepared as best as we can and are now looking forward to transferring that training onto the pitch itself.”

Doyle will be absent this time but Ulster’s Paddy Jackson, who impressed in the No. 10 jersey at Parc y Scarlets last year, captains his country at fly-half.

Ruddock has named an experienced side for the clash, with seven players from last year’s squad included in the starting XV.

The returnees include Munster’s JJ Hanarahan and Leinster’s Sam Coghlan-Murray who has been named on the wing.

Buccaneers own Daniel Qualter partners Iain Henderson in the second row while fellow Connacht native Aaron Conneely is named in the back row.
