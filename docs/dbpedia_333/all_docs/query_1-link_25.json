The 'A' team play Quins tomorrow at 2.30pm in The Park.\n\nHead coach Girvan Dempsey has made a number of changes to the starting team that accounted for Jersey last weekend in Donnybrook with recent signing Ben Te'o included for the first time in a Leinster jersey. In total there are seven changes with four in the backs and a further three in the pack, plus a number of positional changes.\n\nWIth Billy Dardis starting at full back, Cian Kelleher moves to the left wing and Adam Byrne starting from the bench. Sam Coghlan-Murray retains his place on the right wing. Steve Crosbie captains the side from inside centre with Ben Te'o outside him at 13.\n\nIt's a new half back combination with Nick McCarthy and Cathal Marsh starting at No. 9 and 10 respectively having come off the bench in the win over Jersey.\n\nIn the pack Aaron Dundon is selected from the start at hooker this weekend having recovered fully from his hamstring injury with Peter Dooley and OisÃ­n Heffernan either side of him. Gavin Thornbury starts again at lock with Ben Marshall his second row companion for the trip to Wales.\n\nFinally, there is one change in the back row with Peadar Timmins starting at blindside flanker and Josh van der Flier at openside and the versatile Jordon Coghlan at No. 8.\n\nThere is also a welcome return from injury for Dan Leavy who is named in the replacements. Leavy injured his knee playing for the Senior team in the pre-season friendly against Ulster at the Tallaght Stadium.\n\nFor updates from the game please follow the Leinster Rugby twitter account on www.twitter.com/leinsterrugby and use the hashtag #COTAT (Come on the A Team!)\n\n\"A\" TEAM:\n\n15: Billy Dardis\n\n14: Sam Coghlan-Murray\n\n13: Ben Te'o\n\n12: Steve Crosbie CAPTAIN\n\n11: Cian Kelleher\n\n10: Cathal Marsh\n\n9: Nick Mc Carthy\n\n1: Peter Dooley\n\n2: Aaron Dundon\n\n3: OisÃ­n Heffernan\n\n4: Gavin Thornbury\n\n5: Ben Marshall\n\n6: Peadar Timmins\n\n7: Josh Van Der Flier\n\n8: Jordan Coghlan\n\n16: James Tracy\n\n17: Jeremy Loughman\n\n18: Ross Molony\n\n19: Daniel Leavy\n\n20: Adam Griggs\n\n21: Ross Byrne\n\n22: Adam Byrne\n\nSponsored Links TonduTurk\n\nVeteran\n\n\"Views my own\"\n\nJoined: 15 September 2004\n\nLocation: Wales\n\nStatus: Offline\n\nPoints: 7627 Post Options Thanks(0) Quote Reply Posted: 24 October 2014 at 1:55pm\n\nQUINS V LEINSTER 'A'\n\nBy Colin Clarke | 24/10/2014\n\nThis weekend Carmarthen Quins play the current British and Irish Cup Champions Leinster A.The Irish provincial side are a formidable proposition having won the tournament for the last two seasons.\n\nThe Quins will be bouyed by their win against Plymouth last weekend and will be looking forward to the fixture at 2.30pm on Saturday at the Park.\n\nTeam Details:\n\n15.

He's a big name Australian rugby league player making his debut in Union.\n\nKID A\n\nModerator Group\n\nJoined: 16 August 2004\n\nLocation: Cardiff\n\nStatus: Offline\n\nPoints: 27675 Post Options Thanks(0) Quote Reply Posted: 24 October 2014 at 2:13pm\n\nSteff will 'ave him on toast.\n\n157cb\n\nVeteran\n\nJoined: 29 January 2007\n\nLocation: Wales\n\nStatus: Offline\n\nPoints: 18382 Post Options Thanks(0) Quote Reply Posted: 24 October 2014 at 3:23pm\n\nGoing down for this game really looking forward to it,a super Saturday for sure .\n\nSospanMawr\n\nVeteran\n\nJoined: 03 April 2013\n\nLocation: The North Stand\n\nStatus: Offline\n\nPoints: 10035 Post Options Thanks(0) Quote Reply Posted: 24 October 2014 at 5:19pm\n\nBen Te'o has played union before.\n\nhoppy\n\nVeteran\n\nJoined: 22 May 2009\n\nStatus: Offline\n\nPoints: 2662 Post Options Thanks(1) Quote Reply Posted: 25 October 2014 at 4:29pm\n\nQuins 26 v Leinster 24 Full Time Quins were 21-3 Down Half Time.\n\nscarletnut\n\nVeteran\n\nJoined: 28 April 2009\n\nStatus: Offline\n\nPoints: 14170 Post Options Thanks(0) Quote Reply Posted: 25 October 2014 at 4:34pm\n\nHow did Ben Te'o play?\n\nI still wake up late at night and think of what might have been when tim stimpson hit that jammy penalty1\n\nscarletnut\n\nVeteran\n\nJoined: 28 April 2009\n\nStatus: Offline\n\nPoints: 14170 Post Options Thanks(0) Quote Reply Posted: 25 October 2014 at 4:35pm\n\nSospanMawr wrote:\n\nBen Te'o has played union before.\n\nNo he hasn't.\n\nI still wake up late at night and think of what might have been when tim stimpson hit that jammy penalty1\n\nRedZep\n\nVeteran\n\nJoined: 22 December 2010\n\nLocation: Pembs\n\nStatus: Offline\n\nPoints: 4442 Post Options Thanks(1) Quote Reply Posted: 25 October 2014 at 4:38pm\n\n'' Know your three R's, son.....

Tremendous defence in the latter stages even when Boyde in the bin. Climos kicking all afternoon was astonishing and the scenes when he curled in the winning conversion on the final whistle from the touchline were pretty amazing for such a poor crowd. The quins faithful who all seem to have boycotted the game missed one of the best games played on their pitch. Brilliant !!\n\nEdited by supertaf - 25 October 2014 at 5:15pm\n\nScarlets - Suppliers of fine rugby since 1872\n\nIwlew\n\nVeteran\n\nJoined: 04 April 2013\n\nLocation: Wales\n\nStatus: Offline\n\nPoints: 9582 Post Options Thanks(0) Quote Reply Posted: 25 October 2014 at 5:35pm\n\nBrilliant result for Quins\n\n157cb\n\nVeteran\n\nJoined: 29 January 2007\n\nLocation: Wales\n\nStatus: Offline\n\nPoints: 18382 Post Options Thanks(0) Quote Reply Posted: 26 October 2014 at 11:49am\n\nAmazing win and well deserved a top team effort ,but Scarlets youngsters like Wyn Jone,Shaun Bennett,Will Boyde ,Josh Leis,Steff Hughes and Steff Evans all superb .Shaun Jones,Torin Myhill and Ryan Elias off the bench all impressed and Clinmo,s goalkicking simply amazing\n\nMr Ian\n\nVeteran\n\nJoined: 06 February 2012\n\nLocation: Italy\n\nStatus: Offline\n\nPoints: 7227 Post Options Thanks(0) Quote Reply Posted: 26 October 2014 at 12:29pm"
