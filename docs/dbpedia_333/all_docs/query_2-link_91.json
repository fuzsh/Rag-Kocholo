Bulwer Lytton\n\n15. 12 A friend is someone special, who will share your laughter when you are hap- py, And your tears when you are sad.\n\n16. To the Class of '82 ... Looking back we realize just how Jong it's been, since the first day of the kindergarten class we were in. And through the years of skipping rope and playing hide and seek, we wondered what our lives would be, we longed to take a peek. And when we reached the Middle School it seemed so far away the day that we were dreaming of, Our graduation day. Through all our high school nonsense, the laughter and the cheer I hear myself now say I guess our time is here. Now each of us is on our own and going a separate way. There's so much we are thinking now, but nothing we can say. But we never have to say good-bye, we never have to part If we keep each memory enclosed within our heart. And when you get discouraged, when life has got you down I guarantee that memory will wipe away your frown. -Cindy Bannister . SEl!DltS\n\n17. HOMECOMING • • • 14 1 9 8 1\n\n18.

Law Day at Auburn High School is an outgrowth of the 11th. grade American Studies Classes' involvement in Project Legal. This is a program de- signed to incorporate law-relat- ed education into the curricu- lum. Each of the classes involved spent at least two weeks class time, during which they studied \"due process\" and the rights of the individual. This period em- phasized law related terms, dis- cussion of specific cases, and in- cluded the viewing of films showing individual situations, etc. The Law Day Seminar, itself, was held in the LRC and hosted about 80 students. The program provided general introductory remarks by the speakers, and individual groups for \"one on one\" discussions between the speakers and the students. The general theme of the semi- nar was \"The Law As I Use It\". Speakers making presentations were: Detective Carl Festa, City Youth Officer; Charles Maran- gola, Denfense Attorney; and Ross Tisci, District Attorney. These gentlemen traced the process from arrest to court and discussed the problems perti- nent to Cayuga County, and to the students' age group. LAW DAY NOV. 4, 1981 The participating students reacted posi- tively to the program. They felt more in- formed on both rights and responsibilities of citizens of their age groups. They seemed to appreciate the down-to-earth approach of the speakers, and their will- ingness to talk with students. The speakers expressed an appreciation for the interest shown and for the oppor- tunity to talk with students and caution them about their rights and responsibil- ities.\n\n72.

Auburn High School held a career Awareness Fair for all students in grades 9-12. This was the first event of its kind since the school opened its doors 12 years ago. The fair, which lasted all day, was held in the gym. Students enrolled in Eng- lish and Gym classes were excused from their regular classes during the day to ensure that all students had an oppor- tunity to visit at least four of the career areas. The career areas chosen varied from Accounting to X-Ray Technology, in an attempt to meet the career aware- ness needs of the majority of students.\n\n80. In all, a total of 56 different career areas were represented at the Fair with about 101 representatives present to provide valuable up-to-date information to stu- dents about: beginning salaries ad- vancement, qualifications, retirement benefits, working conditions, and job descriptions for the various fields. The fair served a dual purpose, which was evident in the theme-Sex Equity Career Awareness Day. In addition to helping students become aware of var- ious careers, the fair was designed to show students that all careers are open to both male and female workers. Most of the career areas represented were staffed with both male and female pre- senters who discussed their respective points of view with the student partici- pants.

The Foreign Language Department of Auburn High School held its sec- ond Language Fair in the eleven- year history of the school on Tues- day, February 23, 1982. It was Mardi Gras Day for the French, the Final Day of the Carnaval for the Spanish- speaking people and the Karneval for the Germans. So, of course, the theme of the Fair was Mardi Gras- Carnaval-Karneval; translated: a fes- tival of fun and frolic. The foreign language classes in French, German and Italian, Latin and Spanish host- ed the event and invited all Social Studies classes of grades 9, 10, 11 to attend and enjoy the varied activities of the day. The program was repeated in every forty minute period (except for lunch) so that nearly all students of Grades 9, 10, 11 were able to see the projects and live performances of fel- low students. t,,7;'~ '~ .. - .~J. '-~ LANGUAGE FAIR 1982\n\n116. After eight performances, the mem- bers of the German, Italian and French singing and dancing groups and members of the Jazz Band were justifibly very tired but happy to have presented to their fellow stu- dents some of the music and dance of our neighbors in Europe. All the stu- dents of language who participated in the Fair were satisfied with their efforts to present to students of So- cial Studies a slice of the cultures of the French, German, Italian, Latin American, and ancient Romans. 113\n\n118.

WALSH I want to be like the wind I want to go with the breeze I want to be like something no one can see I want to be like the current and go with the flow I want to be free and easy Yes, free and easy The wind doesn't stop to find faults in the trees! It just blows on, treating them equally. I wonder· why people can't do the same. They go on looking for faults that will never change But, just like in evolution, the weak will die And, the strong will survive. But you can't be like the wind, and you must care! You are the youth of the world The molders of the universe Therefore you will stop judging and comparing. Stop listening to your prejudiced peers and begin to look only for the souls of individuals. And, not the shells that can sometimes be hard to see through But easily shattered by a person with an open mind.\n\n128. ACTIVITIES\n\n129.

This course includes a review of commercial, general and military avi- ation, and how they work together. In the final year, students make a more in- depth study of space operations, including space exploration, international coopera- tion in space, and the human body in flight. The year with a look at the role of the military throughout U.S. history. OFFICERS:J. Welch, C. Douglas, F. Glave, P. Driscoll; Row 2: P. Farrell, C. Morphet, G.T. Cosentino, B. Frost, M.

Moses, president of the Strathmore Paper Co. JA has spread to over 1000 communi- ties in the U.S. and Canada. In the U.S. alone, over 50,000 business people con- tribute their time to JA and over 90,000 firms and individuals provide funds. Each JA is managed by a professional staff and volunteer board of directors. The purpose of JA is to provide high school students with practical business experience and insights into the com- plexities of economics. These objectives are accomplished by offering members of the JA the opportunity to actually organize and operate their own busi- ness. The student companies receive management consulting assistance from volunteer advisers from local busin- esses and organizations. J. A. C L u B 155\n\n159. J. V. CHEER- LEADERS M. CASPER L. CHECHE K.
