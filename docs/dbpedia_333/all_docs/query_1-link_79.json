        "text": "Table topping Ulster welcome Edinburgh to Ravenhill in one of three Pro12 games Friday.\n\nUlster have been victorious in all competitions so far this season, and will no doubt want to maintain that unbeaten record as the Pro12 breaks for the year-end Tests.\n\nIn Scotland third placed Glasgow Warriors face a Newport Gwent Dragons team currently residing at the wrong end of the table, and Warriors will be looking for a win to equal their best ever run in the competition.\n\nElsewhere Munster, who sit just outside the play-off zone, travel to Cardiff to take on a Blues team facing their worst run of defeats since the 2004/5 season.\n\nMunster need a victory if they are to have any chance of re-entering the top four before the year-end break.\n\nThe two Italian teams are both in action on Saturday, both away from home; Benetton Treviso traveling to the Sportsground in Galway whilst Zebre make their first appearance at Parc y Scarlets. Second placed Scarlets have only lost two games in this campaign whereas their opponents have yet to record a victory, whilst Benetton Treviso sit two places and three points ahead of their hosts, Connacht in the Pro12 table.\n\nThe round wraps up on Sunday at the Liberty Stadium when reigning champions Ospreys take on last year’s play-off finalists Leinster. Just three points separate the two teams in the table, and should other results go their way, victory could see the Welsh Region take over Leinster’s play-off spot in the top four.\n\nWe look at all the Round Eight matches!\n\nFriday, November 2:\n\nCARDIFF BLUES v MUNSTER\n\n(Cardiff Arms Park – 19.05)\n\nCardiff Blues have suffered five straight defeats in all competitions – their worst run since season 2004/05.\n\nSince they returned to the Arms Park at the start of the season the Blues have won just once there: 34-18 over Treviso in the Pro12 on 22 September.\n\nMunster have won their last two encounters against Edinburgh in the European Cup and Zebre, however away from home the Munstermen have lost their last four games since their visit to Edinburgh on the opening weekend in the PRO12.\n\nMunster have won their last four fixtures with Cardiff Blues, but have only been victorious at the Arms Park in this tournament once before: 18-16 on 4 November 2005.
