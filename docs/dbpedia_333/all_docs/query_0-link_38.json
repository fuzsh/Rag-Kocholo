Could they have foreseen in all their wildest fantasies The place that bares their names? George Vancouver crossed the bay There met the Spaniards; Galiano & Valdes Names that leap from my atlas pages Were present on that day In tandem up the coast they faired Through Salish, the Nootka Kwakwak’l & Haida Guaii The ancient people saw them pass and they knew Their world would never be the same What if they had seen the years unfolding Would they have believed a world so changed? Could they have foreseen in all their wildest fantasies? The place that bares their names? I walked the sand at Spanish Banks And where the cliffs rise o'er the sandy shoals below I wondered how it felt to be alive Two hundred years ago\n\n3.\n\nVoyageur 04:22\n\nVOYAGEUR They came by here, those voyageurs over water sweet as wine Those bold adventurers of a long forgotten time Long before the riverboats, before the pioneers Their chansons echoed through the wilderness frontier On the 1st of May the spring brigades would depart from old Lachine With sweat and blood they’d muscled through the hellish terrain Over rocks or through white water or the miles of cursed mire To winter in the Chipywan, cold and huddled by a fire Those nights went on forever with the cruel wind howling at the door When each man prayed to hear the bells of sweet Saint Anne’s once more To die in the Harlot’s Tavern! in tassels, sash and plume Fol da, diddle di, re fol dadin-o Rise up you bold Nor’wester, an hour before the dawn The sun will set again before your toil is done If you were here brave Voyageur, what stories you could tell Of Fraser & MacKenzie & Thompson as well Did you pulled upstream ‘till your back was bent? The weight on the tumpline, did it twist your neck? If you don’t lie in an unmarked grave along the killing portages You died in the Harlot’s Tavern, a worn-out twisted wretch Fol da, diddle di, re fol dadin-o Rise up now bold Nor’wester, this hour before the dawn Your song shall rise again before this day is done\n\n4.\n\nGhost of Simon Fraser 04:07\n\nTHE GHOST OF SIMON FRASER He started out, into the wild Nechako River One morning, early, all in the month of May With Jules Quesnel and dauntless John Stuart Nineteen Nor’westers, and two guides to lead the way The work was hard, and the river, unforgiving A desperate undertaking, to test the will of men At times they passed, where no human being should venture O’er precipice and mountain, through a harsh, forbidding land Oh, Mighty Fraser! Oh, you rolling river What bold adventurers have traced your rocky shores And oh, you rambling river, how your restless waters Echo with the voices of all those who’ve been before Their journey lay, through the proud and mighty nations The cradle of the ancients, both bountiful and grand They’d never seen, an equal to this country Where people, kind and gentle, extend an open hand Oh, Mighty Fraser! Oh, you rolling river Pride of all who’ve made their lives, upon your shore Oh, you rambling river, how your restless waters Echo with the voices of all who’ve been before They swore an oath, each, to him and to their maker Sooner perish than forsake, they stood as brothers, side by side They followed him, straight through the gates of Hades And cast their souls upon the mercy of the tide I stare alone, across a span of centuries The Ghost of Simon Fraser, still haunts me in his way In thirty-six days, he changed the face of history Unravelling the mystery of who we are today Oh, Mighty Fraser! Oh, you rolling river The pride of all who’ve made their lives, upon your shores Oh, you rambling river, how your restless waters Echo with the voices of all who’ve been before Still echo with the voices of all those who’ve been befor He started out, into the wild Nechako River\n\n5.\n\nJohn Tod 03:54\n\nJOHN TOD Late last evening I had a dream I met John Tod on the Oak Bay Road The weathered old ghost of a Hudson’s Bay Trader With lop-sided grin and old tattered cloths He’d left his home on the Vale of Leven Left Stornawa’ on the Edward & Ann He crossed the great ocean in 1811 Through Hudson’s Bay and to Rupert’s Land It’s hard imagine the span of a lifetime As ­­­riddled with peril or moulded by change Yet he would recall in fondest reflection The youthful adventures of his former days Where are ye now, my Hudson’s Bay brothers? And where are ye now, my comrades of old? W’ James Murray Yale or Edward Ermatinger We lived with the Cayuse & Carriers bold He told how they fought the valiant Nor’Westers Along the Saskatchewan, long, long ago And came to this place called “New Caledonia” A land of promise and riches untold And as the dream ends, I turned to look back I see the procession advance down the road Twenty-eight carriages draped in black crepe As the world bids adieu to old John Tod It’s hard imagine the span of a lifetime As ­­­riddled with peril or moulded by change Yet he would recall in fondest reflection The youthful adventures of his former days\n\n6.\n\nBallad of John Rae 03:17\n\nTHE BALLAD OF JOHN RAE You may well have heard of Franklin’s fate, of Parry, Ross and McClure Explorers brave who roamed the North, each gallant men of worth Though, of all the bold adventurers to comb the Arctic range The greatest of all was an Orkneyman from the Hall of Clestrain Drawn to the North, was bold John Rae, shining star of the Hudson’s Bay The whaling men were first to mark these Northwest Passage straights A trade route to the Orient that merchants sought for freight Many’s the banker tried his luck, Many’s the ship would go And many’s the lad was led to die on the blinding ice and snow Drawn to the North, was bold John Rae, shining star of the Hudson’s Bay If was ever a man who could find his way The name of that man is John Rae He’d scarcely nigh a dozen men, he put them to the test And learning from the Esquimeaux he sought the noble quest 12 thousand miles he roamed the North, by oar and sail and march He made it look a morning stroll from the Ayre to Highland Park Drawn to the North, was bold John Rae, shining star of the Hudson’s Bay If was ever a man who could find his way The name of that man is John Rae Grave news had reached the Hudson’s Bay that Franklin’s men were lost John Rae was sent to seek them out no matter what the cost In learning from the Inuit, a true and honest source How Franklin’s crew was driven to their desperate last recourse Drawn to the North, was bold John Rae, shining star of the Hudson’s Bay If was ever a man who could find his way The name of that man is John Rae Seething with ambition strove the ruthless Lady Jane With wickedness & cunning, John Rae she would defame She robbed him of the knighthood, so rightfully his due For he’d found the Northwest Passage and the fate of Franklin’s crew Now at St. Magnus’ holy ground, my thoughts to you do stray The greatest man of all the North, the pride of Hudson’s Bay Who solved the Arctic riddle, Let Scotsmen praise his name! That truth and time cannot deny so great a man of fame Raise your glass to bold John Rae, darling pride of the Hudson’s Bay If was ever a man who could find his way The name of that man is John Rae The name of that man is John Rae He made it look a morning stroll from the Ayre to Highland Park Drawn to the North, was bold John Rae, shining star of the Hudson’s Bay If was ever a man who could find his way The name of that man is John Rae Grave news had reached the Hudson’s Bay that Franklin’s men were lost John Rae was sent to seek them out no matter what the cost In learning from the Inuit, a true and honest source How Franklin’s crew was driven to their desperate last recourse Drawn to the North, was bold John Rae, shining star of the Hudson’s Bay If was ever a man who could find his way The name of that man is John Rae Seething with ambition strove the ruthless Lady Jane With wickedness & cunning, John Rae she would defame She robbed him of the knighthood, so rightfully his due For he’d found the Northwest Passage and the fate of Franklin’s crew Now at St. Magnus’ holy ground, my thoughts to you do stray The greatest man of all the North, the pride of Hudson’s Bay Who solved the Arctic riddle, Let Scotsmen praise his name! That truth and time cannot deny so great a man of fame Raise your glass to bold John Rae, darling pride of the Hudson’s Bay If was ever a man who could find his way The name of that man is John Rae The name of that man is John Rae\n\n7.\n\nSteamboatin' Jamiesons 02:16\n\nSTEAMBOATIN' JAMIESONS There were five Brothers Jamiesons, the pride of the great Northwest When it came to steamboat pilots, the Jamiesons were best There's stories told of Captains bold who plied the Northwest chuck The Steamboatin' Jamiesons had the hardest luck! It's said the trouble all began in 1854 The first of the fated Jamiesons was standing on the wharf Canemah town heard a frightening sound with a great horrific roar The \"Gazelle\" was flung to \"Kingdom Come\" and that left only four Four Steamboat Jamiesons, pride of the great Northwest When it came to steamboat pilots, the Jamiesons were best! ‘Twas on the steamer \"Portland\", Willamette River run That poor Mother Jamieson, she lost another son The Portland stalls above the falls and amidst the ship's debris Was the lifeless frame of Robert J. and now there's only three Three Steamboat Jamiesons, pride of the great Northwest When it came to steamboat piloting, the Jamiesons were best! \"The Best Swiftwater Pilot\" Smith Jamieson was hailed As he skippered on the Fraser, New Westminster up to Yale He'd come as far as Union Bar when the boiler up and blew There Smith, he met his maker, with Jamiesons at two And then in 1861, late one August night The folks around Victoria beheld a horrid sight As the \"Cariboo\" was splintered through and scattered o'er the foam The a mighty hand reached down to call the last two brothers home The Steamboatin' Jamiesons, the pride of the great Northwest When it came to steamboat pilots, the Jamiesons were best There's stories told of Captains bold who plied the Northwest chuck The Steamboatin' Jamiesons had the hardest luck! Yes, the Steamboatin' Jamiesons had the hardest luck!\n\n8.\n\nRichard Moody 05:08\n\nRICHARD MOODY In the year of our lord, eighteen-and-fifty-eight Lord Bulwer-Lytton's Royal Engineers arrived at Esquimalt Quay With officers handy these men of esteem Had come here to harness the virgin frontier, for Colony & Queen With tales by the score of your heroes in war Or how daring adventurers have christened new shores Give me Victoria's stouthearted lads for they've served us well and truly Who surveyed the borderline from the Pacific on through? Spanned raging rivers and quarreled through stone Building roads to the Cariboo? Who laid out each highway, townsite and city street? Upheld the Queen's law if necessity called as keepers of the peace Architects, tradesmen these engineers all Gentlemen scholars to answer the call With shovel and pack, by compass and map They tamed the wilds unruly Here is a health to the Royal Engineers and a cheer to Richard Moody On July the eighteenth, eighteen and sixty-three That was the day that old England recalled her Royal Engineers But besides the few officers, most would leave their careers To try out their hand with a parcel of land, our colonial pioneers With tales by the score of your heroes in war Or how daring adventurers have christened new shores Give me Victoria's stouthearted lads for they've served us well and truly Here is a health to the Royal Engineers and a cheer to Richard Moody\n\n9.\n\nNed McGowan's War 03:33\n\nNED MCGOWAN'S WAR Ned McGowan was a crooked judge from San Francisco way As vigilantes purged the town, McGowan slipped away To the goldfields of the Fraser where he quickly drew acclaim With the wave of Forty-niners from Californ-i-ay In the year of '58 As winter came, the gravel froze, so they couldn't pan for gold Bravado mixed with whiskey, as they tried to beat the cold Up pipes Ned McGowan \"boys, are ya feeling very bold? What say we all kick up a fuss and start ourselves a war? If you lived to be a hundred And you roamed the wide world over You'd never live to see the likes of Ned McGowan's war In the town of Yale that Christmas day Two of McGowan's men Pistol-whipped the barber and they snuck right back again To Hill's Bar and Ned McGowan, and he tells them never fear, For there Justice of the Peace has no jurisdiction here And we'll turn him on his ear!\" When word came back to Hill's Bar That their constable was gaoled They deputized McGowan's men to bring him back from Yale They stormed into the courtroom, took the Justice custody Then they fined him fifty dollars and they went out on a spree If you lived to be a hundred And you roamed the wide world over You'd never live to see the likes of Ned McGowan's War The Justice wrote to Douglas, and appealed for relief This shifty Ned McGowan, he's the cause of all our grief He's a threat of annexation and if he is left alone Of Californians he could raise an army of his own With near two dozen Sappers came the Governor's reply Fifty sailors & marines with a field piece close behind And so a strange flotilla made way from Derby side With a steamboat and a whaleboat, and a war canoe besides If you lived to be a hundred And you roamed the wide world over You'd never live to see the likes of Ned McGowan's War When Ned McGowan came to town To the court he was arraigned But they quickly dropped the charges as he craftily explained The boys were sworn & deputize When the Justice they'd detained So court adjourned, and they all shook hands And toasted with champagne If you lived to be a hundred And you roamed the wide world over You'd never live to see the likes of Ned McGowan's war You could sail the salt sea over To the west, south, east and north You'd never live to see the likes of Ned McGowan's war\n\n10.\n\nThe Serpentine 03:43\n\n11.\n\nGhost of Kitty o'Reilly 03:39\n\nTHE GHOST OF KITTY O'REILLY Kitty blushed in the full bloom of spring Carefree and wild as a bird on the wing Unencumbered by love’s tender strings She lived by the Point Ellice shore From far and wide, like moths to a flame Calling and courting the gentlemen came Still she bided her time, content to remain In the house by the Point Ellice shore There was not a one so fare Timeless beauty and devil may care At the height of Victorian flare With paints, easel and garden Oh, the scores of hearts she snared Few resisted and few were spared Though they pined oh, the less she could care No one could kindle her ardour Kitty died, a solit’ry rose She never had wed; she’d seldom left home Having never found love, was her heart turned to stone? All alone by the Point Ellice shore Many years have come and have gone A story’s told so the legend lives on That a maid with a blue dress on Still haunts the house by the harbour And there, I fear the ghost of fare Kitty O’Reilly Will haunt evermore\n\n12.\n\nTwenty-three Camels 03:15\n\nTWENTY-THREE CAMELS Well it came about on a month of May That 23 Camels sailed away 23 Camels for Douglas sailed And the road to the Cariboo Where the Camels came from, no one knew In the Cariboo in the days of old From the U.S. Army or old Manchu? In the Cariboo in the days of gold From Arizona on a railway crew In the Cariboo in the days of old All the way to the Cariboo But 23 Camels that's a twist Oh you've never seen such a sight as this Run like a devil when the camels hiss On the Road to the Cariboo \"Ships of the Desert\" was the camel's fame In the Cariboo in the days of old They could carry a half-of-a-ton was claimed In the Cariboo in the days of gold Till their feet went tender and they all took lam In the Cariboo in the days of old They were auctioned off away But 23 Camels, that's a sight Where the donkey brays and the horse takes flight It's a wonder everybody didn't die of fright On the road to the Cariboo They kicked and bit at everything that moved In the Cariboo in the days of old They smelled so bad that they scared the mules In the Cariboo in the days of gold Causin' so much trouble that the teamsters sued In the Cariboo in the days of old Their disruptions to curtail But 23 Camels, that's a sight Where the donkey brays and the horse takes flight It's a wonder everybody didn't die of fright On the Road to the Cariboo But 23 Camels that's a twist Oh you've never seen such a sight as this Run like a devil when the camels spit On the Road to the Cariboo\n\n13.\n\nFraser & Thompson 03:27\n\n14.\n\nDown at Gassy Jack's 03:58\n\nDOWN AT GASSY JACK'S Captain John Deighton was, as most accounts convey With a bold outgoing nature, well regarded in his day Now history affords us that beside the western sea Jack Deighton built this city by his hospitality Aboard the \"Flying Dutchman\" He’d first gained some renown As a pilot on the Fraser, he supplied the goldrush towns 'Till he saw an opportunity on the shore by Hastings Mill Well he built himself a public house and they talk about it still Now there's good clean fun, Down at Gassy Jack's there's a barrel in the back And the whiskey flows like water, when you feel a little slack When you’re dogged-tired from workin', just sit down and relax Where the customer is always king, down at Gassy Jack's Jack took his wife and her family and put them all in a war canoe With a yellow dog, some broken chairs, a few odd chickens too And with these odd amenities, though the craft was over-flowin' Sat a great big barrel of whiskey, to set the whole thing going Jack broached the keg by a maple tree and he doled the whiskey out To the thirsty sawmill workers who had gathered 'round about In return for all his kindness, what a sight was soon beheld Within a day where Deighton stood, they’d built a small hotel Down at Gassy Jack's there's a barrel in the back And the whiskey flows like water, if you feel a little slack When you’re dogged-tired of working', just sit down and relax Where the customer is always king, down at Gassy Jack's Well it wasn't long 'till Jack's caught on and business starts to boom Sellin' hooch to ship-jumped sailors, serving food & letting rooms He soon had neighbours movin' in, and the place was all ablaze The boozers packed with loggers, dancing girls and poker games What first was known as Gastown became Granville, then Vancouver And for it’s hospitality it’s praised the wide world over From an up-sprung little shanty to a city of acclaim That’s the tale of Gassy Jack who gave the place its fame Now there's good clean fun, Down at Gassy Jack's there's a barrel in the back And the whiskey flows like water, when you feel a little slack When you’re dogged-tired from workin', just sit down and relax Where the customer is always king, down at Gassy Jack's\n\n15.\n\nChatham Reach 03:07\n\nCHATHAM REACH Along Chatham Reach My memory wanders still To gaze upon the splendour From her shoreline to her peaks A painter’s dream of heaven And to my soul she speaks As spring breaks through, down on Chatham Reach Ever since my younger days I have loved your misty shores I’d stare out from the tall grass Smell the sweetness on your breeze And at night around a fire We would gather on the beach Those friends I knew down on Chatham Reach And ever steeped in mystery your legends would unfold Of stalwart men to reach their end in search of Slumach’s Gold* And ever still, I’m haunted by the ghost of Louis Bee Sweet mystery, and it calls to me Now winter brings it’s bitter chill My breath hangs in the air The frost has turned the tall grass To the colour of my hair My life is done, my race is run But with a longing I am filled To linger still, down on Chatham Reach\n\n16.\n\nGhosts of Read Island 03:44\n\nGHOSTS OF READ ISLAND Now here is a story of poor Jack O'Connor And the tale that surrounds his untimely demise Submitted in fact as just one like example Of such gruesome history Read Island's comprised The wind weathered rocks on the coast of Read Island Guard over the mysteries of her own tragic lore For it's said to this day that the ghosts of Read Island Appear in the mist of her desolate shores Jack Myers was a blaggart, a thief and a braggart Who sold stolen whiskey from his sloop in the bay When Tayor camp loggers bought up twenty-six bottles Little they knew such a price would be paid After a weekend of two fisted drinking Jack Myers ran amok with an old forty-four O'er a wager turned sour, on Monday's wee hours Poor Jack O'Connor lay dead on the floor The wind weathered rocks on the coast of Read Island Guard over the mysteries of her own tragic lore For it's said to this day that the ghosts of Read Island Appear in the mist of her desolate shores A magistrate came, Michael Manson by name Who, along with Fred Hussey performed the inques Those who witnessed the act testified to facts And a warrant was issued for Jack Myers arrest A posse was sworn in and with posted reward They sailed from Nanaimo on the \"Joan\" and \"Estelle\" When at last they found Myers hold up in Bute Inlet They brought him for trial, his story to tell The arm of the law is both strong and far-reaching Though he swore self-defence, at the end of the day Jack Myers was sentenced to a long life in prison For killing O'Connor in a blind drunken rage The wind weathered rocks on the coast of Read Island Guard over the mysteries of her own tragic lore For it's said to this day that the ghosts of Read Island Appear in the mist of her desolate shores The wind weathered rocks on the coast of Read Island Guard over the mysteries of her own tragic lore For it's said to this day that the ghosts of Read Island Appear in the mist of her desolate shores\n\n17.\n\nJohn Antle 04:49\n\nJOHN ANTLE The north Pacific coastline in the days of sail & steam Was as inhospitable a place as ever you might dream Through hope or desperation came the dauntless pioneers Seeking \"the good life\" in freedom's last frontier Up the lonely channels to mills and mines they poured To logging camps and shanties, all the hardships to endure In loneliness and injury they suffered so much pain 'Till came a man of mercy, John Antle was his name There's providence that watches over children and fools Faith to seize the fallen, and grace to heal their wounds If ever was a champion so selflessly disposed Remember John Antle for he was one of those Born in far off Newfoundland in the eighteen-sixties Son of a captain, John joined the ministry But his soul burned with a passion no parish could contain \"Reverend John\" could stand his ground, for the sea was in his veins With fierce determination and abiding faith, he chose To spread his social gospell through the many scattered coves He forged a coastal mission, built of hospitals and ships Exemplified the virtues of a Christian fellowship There's providence that watches over children and fools Faith to seize the fallen, and grace to heal their wounds If ever was a champion so selflessly disposed Remember John Antle for he was one of those And providence still watches over children and fools Faith can seize the fallen, and grace can heal their wounds If ever was a hero on which you could depend Remember John Antle, he was such a man\n\n18.\n\nElectric Railway Line 05:23\n\nELECTRIC RAILWAY LINE Climbed aboard the old 1402 On the Electric Railway Line Thirteen cents in cash fare

Or drove Othello Tunnels through Hope’s forbidding gate? Copper, gold, cattle & coal from across the southern vales Avalanches ice & snow, through driving wind and hail Chief Engineer for twenty years, kept watchful eye on the marvel he’d designed It was called McCulloch’s Wonder the Kettle Valley Railway Line Aboard a helper engine, up Carmi’s steeper grades The fireman’s back was breaking, he shovelled eighteen tons a day Now everything is still, no smoke no steam or rumble in the rails Water towers and stations gone and few folks left to tell the tale But buried in these silent hills along the roadside stands a lonely highway sign Recalls McCulloch’s Wonder the Kettle Valley Railway Line McCulloch’s Wonder The old “Tin Whistle” Line\n\n23.\n\nLAST OF THE ROYAL ENGINEERS In 1927 Philip Jackman passed away And with him passed a legacy that can still be felt today When Victoria was sovereign Britannia ruled the waves And the dreams of an empire were borne on the sapper’s spade Here’s to the last of those fine, gallant men And sad, of their likes we shall not see again Raise up your glass for all those we hold deer For we’ve seen the last of the Royal Engineers A boyish man from Devonshire, he came across the brine With the corp. of the Royal Engineers in 1859 True men of sense & purpose, new frontiers to explore They built a British Colony on the North Pacific shore He’d built the roads & highways, and he’d dredged the channels through Been a cop in New Westminster, worked the CP Survey Crew Homesteaded quarter section where he raised a family too He’d marked his place in history when he passed at ninety-two Here’s to the last of those fine, gallant men And sad, of their likes we shall not see again Raise up your glass to all those we hold deer Here’s to the last of the Royal Engineers For years he’d watched the shadows as around, the men he’d known Death touched their lips with silence, he’d draped them one by one He would drink a toast in silence, “to the builders of the west” Long life to the hearts still beating, and peace to the hearts at rest”\n\n24."
