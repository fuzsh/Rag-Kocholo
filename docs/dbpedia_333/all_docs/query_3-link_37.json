        "text": "Leinster A had far too much firepower for Leeds Carnegie, and retained their British & Irish Cup title with a 44-17 win.\n\nAfter two Cathal Marsh penalties, Sam Coghlan-Murray took advantage of a yellow card for Leeds' James Doherty to bag Leinster's first try.\n\nThe impressive Marsh converted that try, and Luke McGrath's second, and though Jonny Bentley got Leeds on the scoresheet, the sides went in at half-time with Leinster 20-3 up.\n\nLeinster kept up the pressure in the second half, Coghlan-Murray bagged a second try, which was again converted by Marsh.\n\nWhen Leeds had Stevie McColl sent to the sin bin, Marsh added three more, and a conversion to Darragh Fanning's subsequent try.\n\nLeeds were trailing 37-3 and reeling, but were not giving up, and managed to pull two tries of their own back through David Doherty and Jonah Holmes, both converted by Bentley.\n\nBut any momentum Leeds had built up was obliterated when Brendan Macken intercepted a pass and ran almost the length of the pitch to touch down. Marsh added the extras to leave them 44-17 ahead.\n\nFrom their, Leeds had no further answer, and Girvan Dempsey's team held on for a comfortable retention of the Cup."
