        "text": "If Moore only ever hits Leinster level (which I'm not sure I agree with, but time shall tell), then given the paucity of good young Irish tightheads, he's going to get international caps. I also think Furlong's being talked up a bit, he was very impressive given his age but not imo as good as some are saying. He too will probably get international caps mind.\n\nFurlong is only about 7 weeks away from being qualified to play U20 for 2 more years. Given his age and position he looks to be a future international. Thats if he continues to develop the wy he is going.\n\nIf Moore only ever hits Leinster level (which I'm not sure I agree with, but time shall tell), then given the paucity of good young Irish tightheads, he's going to get international caps. I also think Furlong's being talked up a bit, he was very impressive given his age but not imo as good as some are saying. He too will probably get international caps mind.\n\nI'd say Martin Moore may be a little unlucky in that he's coming through the Leinster setup rather than one of the other provinces. For example, Munster have nobody backing up BJ Botha- Moore could see a lot of action there over the next two years and be a candidate to start in 2013. At Connacht he'd only have to beat out one of Rodney Ah You and Stewart Maguire to feature in the Heineken Cup next season. He'd be Ulster's 3rd choice tighthead instantly and could push Declan Fitzpatrick out of the way within a couple of seasons. At Leinster though, Mike Ross is 31 and has another 3 years of decent rugby ahead of him. Jamie Hagan is 24 and could be around for a decade. Tadhg Furlong to me shows more potential- he's a very good defender and a decent scrummager already. I'd love to see Moore make it (I went to the same school as him for a couple of years!) but think he'll find it difficult to start regularly at Leinster thus hindering his future international prospects. A move away two years from now could do him a lot of good.\n\nAs for McGrath, I am certainly looking forwards to him and Jackson pairing up for the U20s next season. Saw him on TV once for the U18s, definitley something about him.\n\nMcGrath is ridiculously good. He reminds me of the French style scrumhalves in that he's a little general on the field and takes a ton of pressure off his 10. In him and Conor Murray, Ireland might finally have a pair of quality 9s.\n\nDon't think Tom Sexton will feaure too much. I think he's injured at the moment and is behind Richardt Strauss, Sean Cronin and Jason Harris Wright anyway. I assume he'll move up to 3rd string hooker in 2012/13 since he'll be cheaper than Harris Wright.\n\nIt's very rare for players to jump straight from school to the academy. This year three players did so (Jordan Coghlan, Conor Gilsenan and Luke McGrath), last year only Sam Coghlan Murray did so and the year before Andrew Conway and Brendan Macken were the only two to make the leap. Jerry Sexton will be u19 next season and I suspect will be given a year or two in the sub-academy before he's ready to step up.\n\nDon't think Tom Sexton will feaure too much.

When ever I've seen him he's been very impressive in the lineout.\n\nThe Leinster squad stepped up their preparations this week ahead of the start of the Bank of Ireland series which kicks off this Friday night when the province faces Super 15 side the Melbourne Rebels in Donnybrook (KO: 7pm)...\n\nEoin O'Malley (ankle) is progressing well following surgery earlier this summer but this week's game is likely to come too soon for him and for Shane Horgan (knee) also. Prop Simon Shawe (quad tear) is also a doubt. Academy centre Eamonn Sheridan, who missed a large part of last season after fracturing his ankle, is available for selection. He features in a squad which includes summer signings out-half Mat Berquist and second row Steven Sykes.\n\nFormer Leinster Academy graduates Fionn Carr and Jamie Hagan are also set to make their seasonal debuts following their move home from Connacht. Though the squad will be without those who are involved on Ireland duty, there will be a blend of youth and experience against the touring Australian side.\n\nAndrew Conway and Brendan Macken, who were both involved in the Ireland Under-20 squad at the IRB Junior World Championships in June, are in the frame alongside the likes of hooker Richardt Strauss.\n\nLeinster squad to face Melbourne Rebels:\n\nBACKS (12): Mat Berquist, Andrew Boyle, Fionn Carr, Andrew Conway, John Cooney, Darren Hudson, David Kearney, Brendan Macken, Ian Madigan, Colm O'Shea, Eamonn Sheridan, Cillian Willis\n\nFORWARDS (16): Leo Auva'a, Aaron Dundon, Mark Flanagan, David Gannon, Jamie Hagan, Jason Harris-Wright, Jack McGrath, Ben Marshall, Jack O'Connell, Ciaran Ruddock, Rhys Ruddock, Dominic Ryan, Richardt Strauss, Steven Sykes, Devin Toner, Heinke van der Merwe\n\nREFEREE: David Wilkinson (IRFU), ASSISTANT REFEREES: Michael Black (IRFU), Mark Patton (IRFU), 4th OFFICIAL: Ed Kenny (Leinster Rugby Referees), 5th OFFICIAL: Dan Wallace (Leinster Rugby Referees)\n\nBloody hell, that's a fairly depleted squad. I'd go for something along the lines of:\n\n15) Dave Kearney\n\n14) Andrew Conway\n\n13) Brendan Macken\n\n12) Eamonn Sheridan\n\n11) Fionn Carr\n\n10) Mat Berquist\n\n9) Cillian Willis\n\n8) Rhys Ruddock\n\n7) Dominic Ryan\n\n6) Leo Auv'a\n\n5) Steven Skyes\n\n4) Devin Toner\n\n3) Jamie Hagan\n\n2) Richardt Strauss\n\n1) Heinke Van Der Merwe\n\nSurprised no to see Jordi Murphy or Paul Ryan thrown in there. Seems like the perfect kind of game for them. Nice to see Isa given a bit of a rest, god knows he played enough rugby last season. Even without him we have a pretty sharp looking back three. The tight five looks good too, but I have serious problems with our half backs and centres. Where's Ian McKinley these days I wonder?\n\nUnfortunately it looks like McKinleys career could be over due to the eye injury. I don't know for sure but its not looking good."
