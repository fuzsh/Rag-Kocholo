On the 28-March-1917 he enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force at the recruiting tent, Blackboy Hill Camp, West Australia. In the record of recruitment he is described as 35 years of age, a labourer (elsewhere he describes himself as a yardman), living at 495 Hay St in Perth, WA, 5ft 7 1/2 inches, 126 lbs weight, of dark complexion, blue eyes, dark hair, and Roman Catholic. He describes himself in 1917 as unmarried. The army sent him to the war in Europe where on 8-August-1918 or 9-August-1918 he was killed in the Battle of Amiens (Somme, France). The date is not clear because the records suggest that he was hit and seriously injured in an advance on the 8th but survived until the next day.
