        "text": "14. Craig Gilroy (Dungannon/Ulster)\n\n13. Alex Kelly (UCD/Leinster)\n\n12. Luke Marshall (Ballymena/Ulster)\n\n11. Sam Coghlan Murray (UCD/Leinster)\n\n10. Paddy Jackson (Dungannon/Ulster)\n\n9. Peter du Toit (UCD/Leinster)\n\n4. Ian Henderson (Queen's University/Ulster)\n\n6. Michael Kearney (Clontarf/Leinster)\n\n7. Jordi Murphy (Lansdowne/Leinster) (capt)\n\n8. Eoin McKeon (Galwegians/Connacht)\n\nReplacements:\n\nJJ Hanrahan (UL Bohemians/Munster)\n\nCathal Marsh (Dublin University/Leinster)\n\nDominic Gallagher (Dublin University/Ulster)\n\nVery good prospects from what I've seen. Tiernan O'Halloran, Brendan Macken, Andrew Conway and Andrew Boyle all played for the u20s last season and are still available this year.\n\nGilroy, Marshall, Jackson, Macken and Conway could all feature for their provinces when the 6 Nations is on. I think they'll develop more playing for their provinces than in an age grade tournament so Joe Schmidt and Brian McLoughlin should get first call on these players. Brinf them back for the u20 World Cup if needed.\n\nEngland have a killer squad on paper, but in reality it'll be butchered by the clubs getting first dibs. England will be strong but not overly so, should be nice and open. The Tadpoles suffer from a similar problem from what I've noticed.\n\nThere should be a lot of good young Ulster talent in the mini-micks. I pray we're allowed to keep Gilroy, but don't know where precedent lies here. Niall Annett and James McKinney from last year are both eligble - think McKinney will be behind the Ginger Messiah, Annett's been named captain. Henderson has talent but needs gym-time.\n\nI have to say i'm looking forwards to the Ireland back-line, on paper it looks mildly scary. Thankfully their pack isn't on the same level!\n\nLast season Allen Clarke seemed to have first call on the players ahead of the provincial coaches. I hope Mike Ruddock takes a more enlightened approach and puts the players development ahead of winning trophies. If that means letting them play for their province, that's what should be done.\n\nThere was an interview with Ruddock on the IRFUs website a few days ago. He said he wanted to get the ball into the backs hands as much as possible since that's where the talent in the team is. Contrast this to Clarke's philosophy last year which was to play turgid 10 man rugby, territory based despite having some quality players in the wider channels. A coach should always look to maximise the potential of his team. Unfortunately Clarke didn't do this. Only once did they change this tactic and that was in the demolition job on Scotland.\n\nI'd rather see Ireland lose games yet players further their development by trying to play the game properly than win playing shite rugby which does nothing other than boost the coaching teams ego.\n\nThe IRFU have stuck pics of 22 u20 players on their website:\n\nhttp://www.irishrugby.ie/squads/ireland_u20.php\n\nZero Munster players so far . Love the mullet on Finlay Bealham\n\nThre are however 6... maybe 7... Ulstermen. I think William Henderson is Ian Henderson, but am not sure. Only real surprises (from an Ulster perspective) are McIlroy in (ahead of Conor Spence certainly) although I've seen McIlroy play and rate him and none of the Ulster back-rows... I'd imagine Dom Gallagher and Stephen Leckey are in the training squad at least. And no James McKinney is a mild surprise.\n\nIf you google Finlay Bealham, he's an Aussie. You poaching ********!\n\nAnd aye, that is the Nordie Henderson. Good player, just needs some beef.\n\nI am extremely disappointed that the Ginger Messiah has cut his afro short. One of five Methody boys in the 22."
