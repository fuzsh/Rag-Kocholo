        "text": "Cork Constitution&rsquo;s form in the capital has not been great this season - four losses in six trips - but a repeat of last April&rsquo;s 19-16 semi-final win at Lansdowne would do nicely when they visit Terenure College this afternoon.\n\nTerenure College and Garryowen were the big winners on the final day of Division 1A&rsquo;s regular season, setting up semi-final clashes with defending champions Cork Constitution and table-topping Lansdowne respectively.\n\nCork Constitution 26 Buccaneers 0: Gerry Hurley was thrilled to have participated in one of Cork Constitution&rsquo;s most impressive Ulster Bank League performances of the season at Temple Hill on Saturday.\n\nThe Leinster team took time out from preparing for Friday’s match against Connacht to pay a visit to the children, parents and staff in Temple Street children’s hospital yesterday.\n\nLansdowne exacted revenge for their defeat to Young Munster in December by whipping the Limerick men 37-17 on the Aviva Stadium’s back pitch.\n\nBallynahinch showed no mercy to a demoralised Bruff team as they took another step closer to Division 1B honours with a 52-point victory in Limerick.\n\nBallynahinch’s 10-match unbeaten run in Division 1B was ended by one of their chief rivals, UCD, this afternoon.\n\nBallynahinch remain in control of Division 1B after digging deep to see off a committed Dublin University side 26-22 at Wallace High School.\n\nA 14-point haul from Chris Quinn was crucial at the Belfield Bowl as Ballynahinch continued their excellent start to the Division 1B campaign with a hard-fought 24-13 win over UCD.\n\nMalone have taken over from UCD at the top of the Division 1B following their 60-3 demolition of Ulster rivals Ballymena this afternoon.\n\nBruff scored two superb tries on their way to handing out a notable 25-5 defeat to Ballymena in the opening round of Division 1B this afternoon.\n\nIreland U20s were denied a semi-final berth at the IRB Junior World Championship as hosts South Africa scored a bonus-point win over England to top their pool last night.\n\nIreland U20s coach Mike Ruddock has rung the changes for his side’s must-win IRB Junior World Championship pool finale against Italy today but a win may not be enough to reach the last four in South Africa.\n\nUL Bohemians are celebrating on the double tonight after winning the Division 1B title and securing promotion to the Ulster Bank League's top flight.\n\nBallynahinch are the new leaders of Ulster Bank League Division 1B having come from behind to grab a share of the spoils with UCD this afternoon.\n\nBallymena claimed the scalp of Bruff, who are always a formidable prospect at Kilballyowen Park, as John Andrews’ side moved up to fifth in the Division 1B table.\n\nTwo tries from flanker John Shine helped Bruff come from behind to beat Galwegians 21-12 in Ulster Bank League Division 1B today.\n\nNEW Ireland U20 coach Mike Ruddock got off to a winning start, as his new-look side saw off Italy in a friendly at Donnybrook yesterday."
