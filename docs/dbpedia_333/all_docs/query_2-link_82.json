        "text": "There seem to be a few Leinster fans on the board so I think it's time to set up a thread surrounding the Leinster squad, player interviews, scathing and complimentary match reports, opinion pieces (even Franno's!) and underage news. I doubt too many people would be interested in reading a thread dedicated to an interview with, say, a squad member like Devin Toner so this might be a useful way of archiving all that stuff.\n\nWithout further ado, an interview with Devin Toner from today's Indo!:\n\n<div class='quotetop'>QUOTE </div>\n\nhttp://www.independent.ie/sport/rugby/huge...rs-1895001.html\n\nHE'S heard them all before. From \"what's the weather like up there?\" to \"woah, is the circus in town?\"to the rather rudimentary Irish observation of \"Jeez, you're fierce tall aren't ya?\"\n\nWhat do you say in reply? \"Ah, I'm wearing heels,\" or maybe you just nod and smile.\n\nDevin Toner is well used to pedestrians doing double takes as he strides by and the constant references to his height. None of it bothers him unduly and it cannot be denied that he has put his six feet and 10 inches to good use professionally.\n\nWhen lifting was legalised in rugby in the mid-1990s, leviathan second rows were suddenly obsolete and men such as England's Martin Bayfield and Wales' Derwyn Jones (both 6'10 like Toner) found themselves surplus to requirements as the line-out became a procedural source of possession.\n\nThankfully, though lifting remains, the element of line-out competition is back in force as coaches realise the value of turnover possession out of touch and charge their video analysts to work on the opposition.\n\nCommendable\n\nToner's height makes it inevitable that the line-out is a central facet of the 23-year-old's make-up but, with the encouragement of Leinster head coach Michael Cheika and forwards coach Jono Gibbes, the other aspects of his game have come on hugely -- notably his ball-carrying duties where he has a commendable policy of taking the ball from depth when standing starts seem to be all the rage.\n\n\"It's one of the goals I've set myself, to try to get on the ball more and Jono has been working on it with me a lot. I do try to hit the ball with a bit of pace, you don't want to get the ball when there's a defender right in front of you and end up flopping to the ground.\n\n\"Another big area I'm working on is scrummaging, getting my back straight and getting down low and that comes into play in clearing out rucks as well. When you're that bit taller, you constantly concentrate on getting low.\"\n\nToner's physique has developed along with his game and he now weighs in at 120kilos (around 19 stone). It is a chassis that requires a large amount of fuel which he describes as \"four or five Weetabix. in the morning and a few big feeds throughout the day\".\n\nHe is another member of the Leinster squad who disabuses the tired stereotype of a team of South Dublinites, having been reared in Moynalvey (\"a church, a shop and a pub\"), a tiny village in Meath close to the Kildare border.\n\nLike every hamlet in Ireland, Moynalvey has a GAA team to represent it but, though the football club inevitably came calling, Toner admits it just wasn't his game.\n\n\"I played football in national school alright but went I went to Castleknock, it was rugby all the way. The club tried to put me in midfield once but I was a bit out of shape in my younger years and after one half, I knew I wasn't fit enough to do it.\"\n\nOnce in Castleknock, he came under the stewardship of former Irish international out-half Mick Quinn and his younger brother Charlie who were in charge of the senior team. Charlie's brief was to look after the forwards and the colourful former Lansdowne and Leinster back-row had a big influence on Toner's development.\n\n\"He's an interesting character sure enough,\" laughs Toner, \"but though Charlie talked the talk as coach, he was also very hands on. He'd get stuck in, and show you how to ruck and maul and when you're that age you soak it all up.\n\n\"Castleknock wouldn't be one of the more powerful schools, they haven't won a cup since the 1950s or '60s (1965), but it was a good place to learn the game. You'd like to put something back and they were onto me to bring the Cup down and help out in training. I've never coached before in me life but I'll go in and give a hand out.\"\n\nThough his school team struggled, Toner's potential was obvious and, having featured representatively on underage teams, he was brought into the Leinster Academy while also cutting his teeth in the AIL with Lansdowne.\n\nHe won his first Leinster cap with Jonathan Sexton off the bench against the (now defunct) Borders when he was still 19 but last season was his proper breakthrough.\n\nInjury to captain Leo Cullen granted Toner regular starts next to Malcolm O'Kelly and he put in a series of impressive displays before giving way to Cullen for the final rounds of Leinster's successful Heineken Cup run. Though second row is one of the greatest areas of competition in the Leinster squad, last season gave Toner a taste for more.\n\n\"I have my work cut out for me this year. He (Cheika) told me I'm still going to get my share of games and that it's up to me then, he still has a lot of confidence in me, as he does in all the second-rows. And there's real quality in that area between Leo, Mal (O'Kelly), Nathan (Hines) and Trevor Hogan.\n\n\"You can see the competition in training, we're not beating the heads of each other but there's definitely an edge. You're doing line-outs against these guys and there's no way you're going to let them get your ball.\"\n\nHis former mentor has no doubt that Toner has the potential to make it at the highest level.\n\n\"Devin's a top man,\" says Quinn, who now coaches Lansdowne U-20s. \"He had all the armoury and the right attitude. With his height obviously the line-out was going to be a big part of his game but he was good around the park as well. His work-rate was always excellent during matches and in training.\n\n\"There's a lot of competition at Leinster but he has talent and time on his side. The way it is these days, squads are changed around and Devin will get plenty of game time and I think he'll push through.\"\n\nEngaging\n\nToner makes for easy-going and engaging company but when you follow up on a colleague's suggestion to ask him about his Grade 8 piano-playing (high enough to give lessons), he groans wearily.\n\n\"This came out when I was in Irish Schools and it's hounded me since. Even when we were over in Nice on pre-season, there was a supporters club thing going on and they were all: 'Ah Devin, give us a tune,' like I was Liberace or something.\n\n\"It's nothing, I just played a bit in school and got to a high enough level but I haven't played it in about five years. But it keeps coming up, I mean there was one Irish U-21 game where I gave a flick-up out of the tackle or something and one of the papers was on about 'gold-dust in his fingers'.\"\n\nIvory-tinkling aside, Toner does have the ball skills and all-round game to become a force at the highest level. And, beneath the laid-back exterior, there is drive and determination.\n\n\"I'm not going to look too far ahead but my main goal is to nail down a position with Leinster. I want to be first-choice lock to be honest and if something happens with Ireland, something happens.\"\n\nAs Toner makes his way from the Donnybrook cafe, the daintily-formed waitress throws him a startled look as the light is temporarily blocked out. The door closes behind him and she comes over to clear the table.\n\n\"Wow,\" she says, \"he's fierce tall isn't he?\"\n\n- Hugh Farrelly[/b]\n\nand some underage representative news from the last day or two:\n\n<div class='quotetop'>QUOTE </div>\n\nhttp://www.leinsterrugby.ie/domestic/3830.php\n\nThe Leinster Under-20's and Youths teams are in action in Donnybrook on Friday and Saturday...

The forwards have come from the back pitch to join the backs. Michael Cheika is overseeing a fairly full-on, 15 v 15 session with rolling subs as both coach and referee.\n\nA first year Academy graduate squares up to one of Leinster's established Test players and Heineken Cup winner for his use of the boot on Trevor Hogan for lying on the wrong side of the ball. Cheika steps in, issues a few words and calls a halt to proceedings.\n\nNot the least misplaced perception of the academies is they rarely train with the professionals, and when they do, they become glorified tackle bag holders. As was abundantly evident here, that isn't the case.\n\nLeinster Academy manager Colin McEntee credits this greater interaction to Cheika, who himself reckons this year's crop is the best in his five years at Leinster. This is just as well, as the Irish provinces rely on home-grown talent more than their counterparts, especially in France and England.\n\nTen of Leinster's Heineken Cup winning team, and 14 of the 22 on duty against Leicester at Murrayfield, were products of the National or Leinster academies - the IRFU's National Academy having been de-centralised into four provincial units in 2004.\n\nTwenty of this season's contracted squad came through the Leinster/Irish academy pathway, and that doesn't include their ex-Munster recruits.\n\nThe 10-week pre-season and September, before college starts, are the academies' time of bounty.\n\n\"Pre-season is the time when you can maximise development, and there's no game or external distractions,\" says McEntee, \"so they train full-time for eight to 10 weeks.\"\n\nThe players arrive at about 7am most mornings in the David Lloyd Centre in Riverview. There's also a new, purpose-built gym at the end of the Old Wesley clubhouse in Donnybrook - the walls are decorated with noted Academy graduates - for those in the sub-Academy underage system, and there aspiring Academy players are monitored by Dave Fagan, full-time age grade manager, and Sammy Dowling, age grade fitness coach.\n\nFrom Monday to Friday, the Academy players mix \"prehab\" - functional exercises to work on core fitness, such as back, shoulder or leg stablisation or other functional movements - speed sessions, weights or skills, and \"individual priorities\", where, for example, a player might require work in specific areas to improve functionality, or if they've imbalances in terms of flexibility or range of movement. It could also be rugby priorities such as kicking, tackling or whatever.\n\nOn Thursday afternoon, 10 players were in the gym, while seven others trained with the Leinster first-team. Daniel Tobin, the Academy's full-time fitness and conditioning coach who came from the Dublin GAA team, singles out prop Dominic Ryan's marks but also says that thanks to the improved under-age screening and conditioning from 15 or 16 up, this year's crop are the best conditioned of any in the five years he's been with the academy.\n\nTobin admits things will become \"messy\" when the college timetables kick in, and though McEntee agrees, he believes third-level education is vital.\n\n\"We have to help provide the players with a holistic system, and if they are stimulating their minds it will help them in the process of making decisions on the pitch.\"\n\nLeinster provided 15 of the original 26-man squad for the Junior (Under-20) World Cup in Japan last June, including the newly acquired Ruddock brothers. The Academy operates on a one-year rollover basis, with a maximum of three years.\n\nMany are stand-out performers for their school sides, and come into the Academy having represented Leinster and Ireland at under-age level. Many more are spotted, coached, conditioned and monitored, inching towards the Academy through a Talent Identification Player programme.\n\nTo illustrate the point, McEntee borrows pen and pad to draw a graph of the data-based feeder system used by Leinster, from under-16 through 18s, 19s and 20s, with the schools and youths/club ladder running in tandem.\n\nMcEntee agrees with his trusted right-hand man, Richie Murphy, they have tabs pretty much on everybody within the province at under-age level, and little, if any, real talent will miss the net. The CDOs, coaching development officers, are their eyes and ears on the ground, casting their nets across all the province's 12 counties, and coaching coaches as well as players.\n\n\"But, if you ask me in two years' time, we'll probably have moved on as well. Am I happy? Relatively. Can we improve? Absolutely. And I think that is the key,\" says McEntee.\n\nWhen McEntee first came into the system as a CDO (then known as RDOs, regional development officers) about 10 years ago, each had their areas and pathways, \"but we probably didn't specialise, and we definitely didn't have the added resources,\" he admits.\n\nThe CDOs also have more of a hands-on role within the under-age system and hence the Academy can inter-react with them more meaningfully than would have been the case.\n\n\"I'd also add that I think our relationship with the stakeholders (clubs and schools) is key. The work they do is fundamental. We're only as good as what they do and by having a good relationship with them it takes the strain off the resources.\n\n\"Aside from the seven CDOs, we have a lot of coaches out there whom we speak to regularly; some within the Leinster system and some not.\"\n\nWhen the National Academy was initially established under Stephen Aboud in the early 90s, McEntee himself was a second year product of that.\n\nAboud worked wonders (Anthony Foley and Jeremy Davidson were products of the first year, with Malcolm O'Kelly, Kieron Dawson and Conor McGuinness all in the second year alongside McEntee), considering the dozen to 15 chosen met periodically - a fortnight or so in the summer, mid-term breaks, Christmas and Easter - for intensive testing and training.\n\n\"There was support and resources, but your daily programme was run by yourself,\" recalls McEntee. \"It gives you a great insight. If you look at that programme, it was very successful. Why was it successful? Because if guys didn't do the work they were gone. Simple as.\"\n\nNow, every session, both on the pitch and the gym, is monitored. External professionals come in to give talks, and nutritional advice, physiotherapy and coaching is now all full-time. Regionalising the academies also aligns them directly to each province's professional set-up.\n\nThe elite schools are still the core suppliers, especially Blackrock and their production line of backs, but the clubs play their part too and the net is being cast wider - with gems popping up in previously uncharted territory, Tullow's SeÃ¡n O'Brien being a case in point.\n\nBut McEntee maintains you can never dwell on the successes. \"It's getting more and more competitive, and challenging, and you can't stand still. And that's probably player-driven as well, because if the quality rises and the standards rise at the top of the game, underneath has to rise too to breach the gap. And that's the challenge.\n\n\"I don't dislike my job at all and the nature of the job is such that if I didn't like it I wouldn't do it because of the commitment, time and effort you have to put in.\"\n\nMcEntee acknowledges Leinster are enjoying a very good cycle right now, and while he believes in the programme and the people he has around him, not all Academy members will make the pro ranks.\n\nIt irks McEntee that there's a perception out there that the Academy players are constrained from playing for their clubs. In welcoming the British and Irish Cup, which will give his Leinster A side a competitive and more streamlined structure, he points out that this will only clash with the AIB Cup, and that the players will be available for the AIL.\n\nHe also stresses the Leinster As, who he coaches, will delve into the club game as well which, he argues, should excite leading club players in giving them a clearer avenue toward Leinster.\n\nThe conception that Leinster have a high turnover rate, with casualties galore annoys him even more, to the point he walks out of the Riverview weights room vowing to obtain \"some stats for you\" and returns with his pc.\n\nThere it all is in colour code - every player signed to the Leinster academy since it was formed in 2004. With an average of 18 or 19 per year, only 11 players have been released or completed their three-year cycle without obtaining professional contracts, while another four have opted to move on to other things.\n\nAll told, 33 players who have passed through the academy in the last four years (including Luke Fitzgerald, who pretty much skipped straight into a pro contract on leaving school) went into the professional ranks, and of those 27 are still in contract.\n\nThis includes 10 players based in the other provinces or abroad, but most are in Leinster. Even Toulouse, who have the lowest number of foreign players in the over-loaded French Top 14, would struggle to compete with that.\n\nAnd while the Academy route is not the only way to the professional ranks, it certainly gives them every chance.\n\nLeinster Academy 2009-2010\n\nJack McGrath\n\nFirst year, 20, prop.\n\nHopes are high for the highly-regarded St Mary's tighthead, who was involved in every game in the Under-20 World Cup in Japan on both sides of the scrum. Can help fill a bare looking cupboard.\n\nTom Sexton\n\nFirst year, 20, hooker.\n\nBelvedere College hooker, dogged at close quarters and extremely good line-out thrower.\n\nStuart Maguire\n\nFirst year, 19, prop.\n\nWelsh under-18 tighthead whose dad is Irish and hence arrived from Newport three weeks ago. Not many Irish tightheads weigh in at 128kgs!\n\nMark Flanagan\n\nFirst year, 20, lock.\n\nProduct of St Finian's, Mullingar, and youths/club system, 6ft 7in UCD lock has played nine times for Ireland under-20s.\n\nKieran Ruddock\n\nFirst year, 20, lock.\n\nSon of ex-Leinster coach Mike and elder brother of Rhys; born in Ireland but came through Welsh system before declaring for Ireland prior to Junior World Cup. Has joined UCD.\n\nEoin Sheriff\n\nSecond year, 21, lock/backrow.

Tough blindside flanker and prized acquisition. Like his brother, featured with Wales Under-16s, Ireland Under-20s at World Cup in Japan, where he sat his A levels, and is now studying commerce and playing at UCD.\n\nDominic Ryan\n\nFirst year, 19, backrow.\n\nBig, physical backrow product of Gonzaga, now with Lansdowne, also played in Under-20 World Cup and has already caught eye of Leinster players. Immensely strong, physical player made for the new laws.\n\nDave Moore\n\nSecond year, 21, scrumhalf.\n\nSlick-passing, nippy product of Blackrock with a strong work ethic and good break who has had some Leinster game time this season.\n\nIan McKinley\n\nSecond year, 19, outhalf.\n\nCurrently injured, but an exceptional product of St Columba's now with UCD, with a cultured left boot. Made Magners League debut in the final game of last season.\n\nIan Madigan\n\nFirst year, 20, outhalf/fullback\n\nAnother Blackrock product who underwent shoulder operation post Under-20 World Cup and won't be back for three or four months.\n\nKyle Tonetti\n\nThird year, 22, outhalf/centre\n\nSt Gerard's College product, now with Blackrock, on fringes of Leinster first-team squad last season. Strong, physical with excellent skills set.\n\nEamonn Sheridan\n\nSecond year, 20, centre.\n\nNavan boy who came through the club/youths system and Ireland Under-20s. 6ft 4in inside centre in mould of Jamie Roberts.\n\nCurrently sidelined with groin problem.\n\nBrendan Macken\n\nFirst year, 18, centre\n\nStar of the Blackrock and Ireland schools teams last season and straight into Academy. Quick, strong, good feet and vision.\n\nMichael Keating\n\nFirst year, 20, wing.\n\nBelvedere star who broke into Clontarf's team last season. Strong, quick, good feet, will get bigger, stronger and faster.\n\nShane Monahan\n\nThird year, 22, wing.\n\nProduct of Boyne and the Leinster youths, now with Blackrock; strong, physical, direct, good finisher and offloader in tackler.\n\nAndrew Conway\n\nFirst year, 18, fullback.\n\nStar turn for Blackrock last year, straight into academy; great footwork and out-and-out finisher who scored six tries in two pre-season games for Leinster Under-20s.\n\nDave Kearney\n\nSecond year, 20, wing/fullback Brother of Rob, similarly strong in air, athletic and big boot. After rapid improvement in last six months and storming Under-20 World Cup, he's already being promoted to a development contract this season.[/b]\n\nIt's a very good read if you're a rugby geek like me! Thornley did a similar piece on the Munster academy. It was interesting to note the difference between the two provinces approaches. Leinster aim to get all the best players in regardless of position whereas Munster target problem areas and recruit depending on their needs. I'd like to see a similar study done on Ulster's approach.\n\n<div class='quotetop'>QUOTE (snoopy snoopy dog dog @ Sep 29 2009, 08:38 PM) <{POST_SNAPBACK}></div>\n\nI think this is the article you speak of:\n\n<div class='quotetop'>QUOTE\n\nhttp://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/sport/...4254384688.html\n\nLEINSTER ACADEMY: GERRY THORNLEY looks on as fledgling professionals are put through well-drilled paces in preparation for possible life at the top level with the provinceIT'S TUESDAY, late morning in Donnybrook on one of those pristine, manicured pitches synonymous with September. The forwards have come from the back pitch to join the backs. Michael Cheika is overseeing a fairly full-on, 15 v 15 session with rolling subs as both coach and referee.\n\nA first year Academy graduate squares up to one of Leinster's established Test players and Heineken Cup winner for his use of the boot on Trevor Hogan for lying on the wrong side of the ball. Cheika steps in, issues a few words and calls a halt to proceedings.\n\nNot the least misplaced perception of the academies is they rarely train with the professionals, and when they do, they become glorified tackle bag holders. As was abundantly evident here, that isn't the case.\n\nLeinster Academy manager Colin McEntee credits this greater interaction to Cheika, who himself reckons this year's crop is the best in his five years at Leinster. This is just as well, as the Irish provinces rely on home-grown talent more than their counterparts, especially in France and England.\n\nTen of Leinster's Heineken Cup winning team, and 14 of the 22 on duty against Leicester at Murrayfield, were products of the National or Leinster academies - the IRFU's National Academy having been de-centralised into four provincial units in 2004.\n\nTwenty of this season's contracted squad came through the Leinster/Irish academy pathway, and that doesn't include their ex-Munster recruits.\n\nThe 10-week pre-season and September, before college starts, are the academies' time of bounty.\n\n\"Pre-season is the time when you can maximise development, and there's no game or external distractions,\" says McEntee, \"so they train full-time for eight to 10 weeks.\"\n\nThe players arrive at about 7am most mornings in the David Lloyd Centre in Riverview. There's also a new, purpose-built gym at the end of the Old Wesley clubhouse in Donnybrook - the walls are decorated with noted Academy graduates - for those in the sub-Academy underage system, and there aspiring Academy players are monitored by Dave Fagan, full-time age grade manager, and Sammy Dowling, age grade fitness coach.\n\nFrom Monday to Friday, the Academy players mix \"prehab\" - functional exercises to work on core fitness, such as back, shoulder or leg stablisation or other functional movements - speed sessions, weights or skills, and \"individual priorities\", where, for example, a player might require work in specific areas to improve functionality, or if they've imbalances in terms of flexibility or range of movement. It could also be rugby priorities such as kicking, tackling or whatever.\n\nOn Thursday afternoon, 10 players were in the gym, while seven others trained with the Leinster first-team. Daniel Tobin, the Academy's full-time fitness and conditioning coach who came from the Dublin GAA team, singles out prop Dominic Ryan's marks but also says that thanks to the improved under-age screening and conditioning from 15 or 16 up, this year's crop are the best conditioned of any in the five years he's been with the academy.\n\nTobin admits things will become \"messy\" when the college timetables kick in, and though McEntee agrees, he believes third-level education is vital.\n\n\"We have to help provide the players with a holistic system, and if they are stimulating their minds it will help them in the process of making decisions on the pitch.\"\n\nLeinster provided 15 of the original 26-man squad for the Junior (Under-20) World Cup in Japan last June, including the newly acquired Ruddock brothers. The Academy operates on a one-year rollover basis, with a maximum of three years.\n\nMany are stand-out performers for their school sides, and come into the Academy having represented Leinster and Ireland at under-age level. Many more are spotted, coached, conditioned and monitored, inching towards the Academy through a Talent Identification Player programme.\n\nTo illustrate the point, McEntee borrows pen and pad to draw a graph of the data-based feeder system used by Leinster, from under-16 through 18s, 19s and 20s, with the schools and youths/club ladder running in tandem.\n\nMcEntee agrees with his trusted right-hand man, Richie Murphy, they have tabs pretty much on everybody within the province at under-age level, and little, if any, real talent will miss the net. The CDOs, coaching development officers, are their eyes and ears on the ground, casting their nets across all the province's 12 counties, and coaching coaches as well as players.\n\n\"But, if you ask me in two years' time, we'll probably have moved on as well. Am I happy? Relatively. Can we improve? Absolutely. And I think that is the key,\" says McEntee.\n\nWhen McEntee first came into the system as a CDO (then known as RDOs, regional development officers) about 10 years ago, each had their areas and pathways, \"but we probably didn't specialise, and we definitely didn't have the added resources,\" he admits.\n\nThe CDOs also have more of a hands-on role within the under-age system and hence the Academy can inter-react with them more meaningfully than would have been the case.\n\n\"I'd also add that I think our relationship with the stakeholders (clubs and schools) is key. The work they do is fundamental. We're only as good as what they do and by having a good relationship with them it takes the strain off the resources.\n\n\"Aside from the seven CDOs, we have a lot of coaches out there whom we speak to regularly; some within the Leinster system and some not.\"\n\nWhen the National Academy was initially established under Stephen Aboud in the early 90s, McEntee himself was a second year product of that.\n\nAboud worked wonders (Anthony Foley and Jeremy Davidson were products of the first year, with Malcolm O'Kelly, Kieron Dawson and Conor McGuinness all in the second year alongside McEntee), considering the dozen to 15 chosen met periodically - a fortnight or so in the summer, mid-term breaks, Christmas and Easter - for intensive testing and training.\n\n\"There was support and resources, but your daily programme was run by yourself,\" recalls McEntee. \"It gives you a great insight. If you look at that programme, it was very successful. Why was it successful? Because if guys didn't do the work they were gone. Simple as.\"\n\nNow, every session, both on the pitch and the gym, is monitored. External professionals come in to give talks, and nutritional advice, physiotherapy and coaching is now all full-time. Regionalising the academies also aligns them directly to each province's professional set-up.\n\nThe elite schools are still the core suppliers, especially Blackrock and their production line of backs, but the clubs play their part too and the net is being cast wider - with gems popping up in previously uncharted territory, Tullow's SeÃ¡n O'Brien being a case in point.\n\nBut McEntee maintains you can never dwell on the successes. \"It's getting more and more competitive, and challenging, and you can't stand still. And that's probably player-driven as well, because if the quality rises and the standards rise at the top of the game, underneath has to rise too to breach the gap. And that's the challenge.\n\n\"I don't dislike my job at all and the nature of the job is such that if I didn't like it I wouldn't do it because of the commitment, time and effort you have to put in.\"\n\nMcEntee acknowledges Leinster are enjoying a very good cycle right now, and while he believes in the programme and the people he has around him, not all Academy members will make the pro ranks.\n\nIt irks McEntee that there's a perception out there that the Academy players are constrained from playing for their clubs. In welcoming the British and Irish Cup, which will give his Leinster A side a competitive and more streamlined structure, he points out that this will only clash with the AIB Cup, and that the players will be available for the AIL.\n\nHe also stresses the Leinster As, who he coaches, will delve into the club game as well which, he argues, should excite leading club players in giving them a clearer avenue toward Leinster.\n\nThe conception that Leinster have a high turnover rate, with casualties galore annoys him even more, to the point he walks out of the Riverview weights room vowing to obtain \"some stats for you\" and returns with his pc.\n\nThere it all is in colour code - every player signed to the Leinster academy since it was formed in 2004. With an average of 18 or 19 per year, only 11 players have been released or completed their three-year cycle without obtaining professional contracts, while another four have opted to move on to other things.\n\nAll told, 33 players who have passed through the academy in the last four years (including Luke Fitzgerald, who pretty much skipped straight into a pro contract on leaving school) went into the professional ranks, and of those 27 are still in contract.\n\nThis includes 10 players based in the other provinces or abroad, but most are in Leinster. Even Toulouse, who have the lowest number of foreign players in the over-loaded French Top 14, would struggle to compete with that.\n\nAnd while the Academy route is not the only way to the professional ranks, it certainly gives them every chance.\n\nLeinster Academy 2009-2010\n\nJack McGrath\n\nFirst year, 20, prop.\n\nHopes are high for the highly-regarded St Mary's tighthead, who was involved in every game in the Under-20 World Cup in Japan on both sides of the scrum. Can help fill a bare looking cupboard.\n\nTom Sexton\n\nFirst year, 20, hooker.\n\nBelvedere College hooker, dogged at close quarters and extremely good line-out thrower.\n\nStuart Maguire\n\nFirst year, 19, prop.\n\nWelsh under-18 tighthead whose dad is Irish and hence arrived from Newport three weeks ago. Not many Irish tightheads weigh in at 128kgs!\n\nMark Flanagan\n\nFirst year, 20, lock.\n\nProduct of St Finian's, Mullingar, and youths/club system, 6ft 7in UCD lock has played nine times for Ireland under-20s.\n\nKieran Ruddock\n\nFirst year, 20, lock.\n\nSon of ex-Leinster coach Mike and elder brother of Rhys; born in Ireland but came through Welsh system before declaring for Ireland prior to Junior World Cup. Has joined UCD.\n\nEoin Sheriff\n\nSecond year, 21, lock/backrow. From Gorey and youths scene initially, younger brother of Rory went to Blackrock for last school year on scholarship and now plays with Lansdowne.\n\nPaul Ryan\n\nSecond year, 21, openside.\n\nAnother Blackrock College product, who gives 100 per cent at everything and if he doesn't make the pro ranks it won't be through lack of effort.\n\nRhys Ruddock\n\nFirst year, 19, blindside flanker. Tough blindside flanker and prized acquisition. Like his brother, featured with Wales Under-16s, Ireland Under-20s at World Cup in Japan, where he sat his A levels, and is now studying commerce and playing at UCD.\n\nDominic Ryan\n\nFirst year, 19, backrow.\n\nBig, physical backrow product of Gonzaga, now with Lansdowne, also played in Under-20 World Cup and has already caught eye of Leinster players. Immensely strong, physical player made for the new laws.\n\nDave Moore\n\nSecond year, 21, scrumhalf.\n\nSlick-passing, nippy product of Blackrock with a strong work ethic and good break who has had some Leinster game time this season.\n\nIan McKinley\n\nSecond year, 19, outhalf.\n\nCurrently injured, but an exceptional product of St Columba's now with UCD, with a cultured left boot.

Thornley did a similar piece on the Munster academy. It was interesting to note the difference between the two provinces approaches. Leinster aim to get all the best players in regardless of position whereas Munster target problem areas and recruit depending on their needs. I'd like to see a similar study done on Ulster's approach.\n\n[/b][/quote]\n\nExactly Munster go for Quality over Quantity which isn't great as there is room for more in academy but also as you don't know if a guy who is average coming in might respond brilliantly to better coaching and develope into a world-class player like Leinster in fairness have a development-model to be proud of.\n\nIt's no problem at all, I intend to keep it coming.\n\nLeinster have no match reports for these games on their website but I've managed to pull a couple of reports from the Ulster official website:\n\n<div class='quotetop'>QUOTE </div>\n\nhttp://www.ulsterrugby.com/branch/10734.php\n\nReports from Wednesday's U18 and U19 Northern Bank Ulster Schools' v Leinster Schools' Inter-pro matches The Northern Bank Ulster Schools' U18 and 19 teams were in a positive mood after their good performances against Munster Schools in Cork earlier in the season.\n\nUnder 18 Schools' Report:\n\nThe U18 team played their Leinster rivals in the 1-00pm kick off at Malone RFC. It was the Ulster team that looked the most likely to score in the opening exchanges and, indeed, took the lead with a Patrick Jackson penalty after 4 minutes of play. Ulster held the territorial domination and good Leinster defence, mixed with poor Ulster decision making, stopped them from scoring tries to extend their lead. On a rare excursion into the Ulster half the Leinster full back, Ross ones had an opportunity to level the scores when he missed a penalty attempt after ten minutes play. Ross eventually did even the scores when he converted a penalty following an Ulster infringement after 22 minutes.\n\nUlster responded immediately with good work from their elusive full back Charlie Simpson putting his team into good positions. Following an intensive period of pressure on the Leinster defence, Ulster got the penalty decision from the referee. Patrick Jackson converted to put his team into a 6-3 lead.\n\nUlster had a glorious chance to score a try when the impressive RS Dungannon centre, Peter Nelson, made a telling break from deep inside his own half. Leinster wing, Sam Coughlin-Murray, saved the day for the visitors with a telling cover defence tackle just prior to the half time whistle, leaving Ulster Schools' U18 6-3 ahead at half time.\n\nThe second half belonged to Leinster! Ross Jones levelled the scores just after the restart with a well struck penalty. 2 minutes later Leinster centre, Stephen Mc Cauley, scorched his way through a hesitant home defence to touch down for a try. Ross Jones converted to put his team into a 13-6 lead for the first time in the game. 2 minutes later Leinster struck again, this time through their other centre, James Kearnes, who scored a try. Ross Jones duly added the extras and Leinster were now in a comfortable 20-6 lead.\n\n5 minutes later the visitors extended their lead with a well constructed, poorly defended try when their lively scrum half, Luke Mc Grath touched down Ross Jones converted to give his team a 27-6 lead.\n\nThe Ulster team made liberal use of their substitutes and scrum half, Harry Doyle, added a lively dimension to his team's performance. He coaxed and encouraged his team on and was not afraid to ask questions of the Leinster defence. Eventually, after 20 minutes of the 2nd half, the Northern Bank Ulster Schools U18 team worked their way into the opposition 5 metre area. This provided Ulster winger, Rory Scholes, to work his way over the Leinster line for a try. Patrick Jackson was just short with his conversion attempt, taking the score to 27-11 in favour of Leinster.\n\nThe Ulster team tried hard to reduce the deficit but it was the Leinster team that had the final say. Their eloquent full back, Ross Jones, touched down for a try in the last minute of play. He was just short with his conversion but his team had come through the encounter with a 32-11 victory, one that they fully deserved. This was the first game the Ulster Schools' U18 team had lost in four outings.\n\nUnder 19 Schools' Report:\n\nThe Northern Bank Ulster Schools' U19 team was hopeful of a good performance after their very narrow defeat against Munster in Cork. Their Leinster rivals were playing their first game in the Inter Provincial series with Connacht Schools' U19s having withdrawn from the scheduled fixture in Athlone earlier in September.\n\nThe Ulster team was at a disadvantage before the game even started with the loss of some 7 players to injury and illness in the run up to this game. Irish Schools' International players Conor Carey and Chris Colvin were among the players unavailable. To compound the Ulster problems, centre Stuart Mc Ilwaine, had to leave the field with mild concussion early in the game.\n\nThe Ulster Schools' U19 team started strongly and put the visiting defence under pressure. Full back, Shandon Scott, had two opportunities in the opening 10 minutes to give Ulster a lead but he was wide with 2 penalty attempts.\n\nLeinster started to get some territorial advantage but it was 22 minutes before they were able to open their account. Leinster out half, David Godfrey was successful with a penalty attempt to put his team ahead. After this point of the game Leinster really never looked back.\n\n3 minutes later Leinster ran in their first try when Mark Mc Groarty ran in for the score. David Godfrey missed the conversion but made amends 8 minutes later when he kicked a penalty to give his team an 11-0 lead. The Ulster Schools' U19 team came back strongly to pressurise the Leinster defence. Andrew Magowan was short with a penalty attempt and the Leinster team took their 11-0 lead into half time.\n\nThe Leinster team was dominant in the 2nd half. After 2 minutes of play 2nd Row Robert Hynes went over for an unconverted try. They added to their tally when James Hart touched down for a try which was converted by David Godfrey after 8 minutes.\n\nDavid Godfrey kicked another penalty after 17 minutes to put his team 26-0 ahead. The Leinster team was not finished yet. Adam Howard scored a try after 30 minutes which was converted by James Hart. 2 minutes later Caolann Fitzpatrick sprinted his way over the Ulster Schools' U19's line to score a try which James Hart converted. Leinster now had an unassailable 40-0 lead, a lead which they kept intact until the final whistle.\n\n[/b]"
