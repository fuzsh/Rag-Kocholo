        "text": "Ireland Under-20s head coach Mike Ruddock believes his side are raring to go for Friday’s opening RBS 6 Nations game against Wales in Athlone.\n\nBlaina-born Ruddock, Wales national team coach from 2004-2006, will put allegiances aside for the clash at Dubarry Park as Ireland look to hit the ground running.\n\nThe last meeting between the two teams saw David Doyle score a dramatic injury-time try to snatch a 26-26 draw last March.\n\nAnd Ruddock can’t wait to go in search of claiming the sole spoils this week.\n\n“We are all looking forward to the start of the Six Nations,” said Ruddock. “It is always a tough test against Wales but preparations have been first class.\n\n“We are confident we have prepared as best as we can and are now looking forward to transferring that training onto the pitch itself.”\n\nDoyle will be absent this time but Ulster’s Paddy Jackson, who impressed in the No. 10 jersey at Parc y Scarlets last year, captains his country at fly-half.\n\nRuddock has named an experienced side for the clash, with seven players from last year’s squad included in the starting XV.\n\nThe returnees include Munster’s JJ Hanarahan and Leinster’s Sam Coghlan-Murray who has been named on the wing.\n\nBuccaneers own Daniel Qualter partners Iain Henderson in the second row while fellow Connacht native Aaron Conneely is named in the back row.\n\nIreland team:\n\n15 – Shane Layden 14 – Barry Daly 13 – Foster Horan 12 – JJ Hanrahan 11 – Sam Coghlan-Murray 10 – Patrick Jackson 9 – Kieran Marmion 1 – Kyle McCall 2 – Niall Scannell 3 – Peter Reilly 4 – Iain Henderson 5 – Daniel Qualter 6 – Conor Gilsenan 7 – Aaron Conneely 8 – Jack Conan\n\nReplacements: 16 – Des Merrey 17 – James Rael 18 – Jake Cawley 19 – Tadgh Beirne 20 – Jordan Coghlan 21 – Luke McGrath 22 – Cathal Marsh 23 – Christopher Farrell"
