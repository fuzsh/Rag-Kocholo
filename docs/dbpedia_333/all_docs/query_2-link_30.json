        "text": "Michael Coghlan is a character mentioned in the first season of HBO's The Last of Us. He was the leader of the Kansas City resistance and older brother of Kathleen Coghlan.[1]\n\nBiography[]\n\nBackground[]\n\nMichael grew up with his sister Kathleen in their house in Kansas City under their mother's care. When Kathleen would get scared at night, he told her stories about how their room was really a big box that kept them safe.[1]\n\nEvents of HBO's The Last of Us[]\n\nAfter the Cordyceps brain infection outbreak in 2003, Michael and his family lived under FEDRA and the military's rule when the city was transformed into a quarantine zone. However, Michael despised FEDRA's rule as the group began limiting rations, attacking citizens and turning people in the community against each other. Seeing his community suffer, Michael rallied together a resistance group against FEDRA rule. According to Henry Burrell, Michael was an inspiring leader and an idealist, whose moral values and character led many in the city to look up to him - especially Perry and his own sister, Kathleen.\n\nHowever, his actions did not bring any visible change to life in the zone, with FEDRA's rule remaining unchallenged for many years. FEDRA began limiting supplies further to force people to betray Michael and sell his name and hiding place to them. Henry gave in when his brother, Sam Burrell, fell ill with leukemia, and sold Michael's location to FEDRA for a drug supply to keep Sam alive. FEDRA found Michael and held him in their detention center, where they beat and tortured him for several days. They eventually let Kathleen visit him. Kathleen revealed she knew it was Henry who had betrayed Michael. However, Michael implored Kathleen to forgive Henry, believing Kathleen turning into a murderer for his sake would ruin the entire point of their efforts to make a better life in the zone.\n\nSoon after, Michael was put on trial and executed. His death turned him into a martyr and inspired Kathleen to take over the resistance and lead a violent guerilla war against FEDRA and the military. By 2023, this war ended in the resistance's favor, with Kathleen dedicating their victory in Michael's name.[1]\n\nKathleen then started a witch hunt for Henry and any other FEDRA collaborators in the name of avenging Michael's death.[2] However, her efforts to do so led an infected horde the military had suppressed under the city to escape and flood into the city, killing its residents and ending Michael's resistance movement.[1]\n\nPersonality[]\n\nMichael was a caring and compassionate man. He cared greatly for his sister, looking after her all her life. He was empathetic, emotionally struck by the suffering FEDRA inflicted upon people in Kansas City and desired to change it. Through his charisma, he started his own resistance movement. His passion was powerful, leading many in the city to swear their loyalty to him and commit their lives to promoting his idyllic way of life - a life free from FEDRA's tyranny. Henry would characterize him as a great man who was never afraid or selfish but always forgiving - the type of man people felt compelled to trust and follow.\n\nDespite this dedicated following, Michael remained humble, insisting to his sister that the resistance should strive for a peaceful life in the post-apocalypse and not one committed to avenging those lost to FEDRA's evil actions.[1] Despite his intentions, Michael's charisma left his followers vengeful after his death, especially Kathleen and Perry.[2]\n\nRelationships[]\n\nKathleen Coghlan[]\n\nMichael loved his sister Kathleen since childhood. He went out of his way to keep her safe, from telling her stories as a child to outright protecting her against FEDRA's tyranny in the apocalypse.[1] This dedication and love was reciprocated by Kathleen, who desired outright revenge against FEDRA and Henry after his execution.[2]\n\nQuotes[]\n\nHenry: \"You know, I wasn't exactly telling you the truth before about me not killing someone. There was a man, a great man. He was never afraid, never selfish and he was always forgiving. You ever met someone like that? A man you'd follow anywhere. I wanted to. Yeah, but Sam...he got sick. Leukemia. Yeah. Anyway, there was one drug that worked and, big shock, there wasn't much left of it and it belonged to FEDRA. If I wanted some, it was gonna take something big. So I gave them something big. That one great man. The leader of the resistance movement in Kansas City and Kathleen's brother.\"\n\nKathleen: \"When Michael and I were little, this room seemed so big. I was really scared of thunder so when there was a storm, Michael told me that this wasn't a room at all. This was actually, just a big wooden box. A big wooden box that nothing could get inside of and it didn't matter that there was lightning or tornadoes or gunfire. He said as long as we were together in our perfect box, we would be safe. He did that for me. He did stuff like that all the time\"\n\nPerry: \"Michael was a great leader. We all loved him. But he didn't change a thing.\"\n\nReferences[]"
