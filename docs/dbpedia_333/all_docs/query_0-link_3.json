        "text": "And again with the familiar pink for attention! We are seeking additional CUPRA Specialist Sales Consultants to be a part of our team at our CUPRA Garage based in Artarmon. There's a lot happening with this exciting brand, and we're looking for people who exude passion and have experience in customer service environments, with special focus on crafting relationships both online and offline. Is that you? Or someone you know? I'd appreciate you sharing with anyone you think is a great fit. #Cupra #jointhetribe #sydney #carbusiness #customerservice\n\nHave you heard of Primavera Sound? It's a massive music festival starting this weekend in Barcelona and Madrid, and has a great lineup of artists. I got to experience Primavera Festival in 2022. Not only was the music and atmosphere amazing, it was part of my introduction to CUPRA and it's non-conformist, creative and always ready to challenge values. It's hard to believe that was a year ago. So much has happened in that time. We've built and launched the CUPRA City Garage Sydney / CUPRA Artarmon and seen the Cupra Leon, Formentor, Ateca and the 100% electric Born on Australian soil. In addition, I'm surrounded by a team of driven Cupra Masters who are passionate about the product and our customers, and we've created a multi-space venue that regularly hosts unique, collaborative events. I won't be at this years festival, but I'm sure the next twelve months will see our Cupra tribe challenging the status quo and making our own unconventional rules. ‚û°Ô∏è Check out the video below. This years Primavera and Cupra collaboration presented the line-up announcement in our Metahype, a reflection of the real world in an augmented digital landscape, where two avatars use the CUPRA Tavascan to drive to the virtual Primavera Sound events in Barcelona and Madrid.\n\nIf you're in Sydney, come into our CUPRA City Garage in Pitt St in May/June, because apart from the new cars on display, we've got a lot of events happening. Pop in on your lunch break (or anytime we're open) and test your skills in our Cupra X Forza Competition: throughout May, an exciting racing simulator will be set up and prizes will be awarded for the fastest race time. If you've always wanted to be a DJ, this is your chance! Each Friday night from Friday, 26th May to 17th June we'll be hosting masterclasses from some of the best DJ‚Äôs in Sydney. Come along and learn everything from effects and transition techniques to creating dynamic sets to get a crowd on the floor, all while enjoying food and drinks. On 30th June - 1st July discover the latest trends on sustainable e-commerce brands when we have them all under one roof. The events are all free. If you're not already on the guest list, click on the link below and check out our events page to keep up to date with everything we've got coming up. #Cupra #Events #Cars #Sydney CUPRA City Garage Sydney / CUPRA Artarmon\n\nHi LI community, we're looking for a Volkswagen Fleet Sales Manager to join our team at Chatswood. If you are looking for a change and a great team of people to work with, we'd love to hear from you. I'm happy to have a confidential chat and answer any questions you might have - just send me a message. If you think someone within your connections would be interested, please share. Thanks all.\n\nIt was another fabulous night for all things fashion, sustainability and style with a recent exclusive fashion event in collaboration with Australian designer Sarah Lloyd. Guests enjoyed drinks and canap√©s as models showcased Sarah's latest autumn and winter collection, including pieces in the CUPRA signature 'copper' colour. This was our second fashion event with Sarah Lloyd, sharing joint-brand values around sustainability, quality and design. Sarah's range includes Ready to Wear and Custom Made, and you can find out more at her website: www.sarahlloyd.com.au and feel free to drop into our CUPRA City Garage Sydney / CUPRA Artarmon anytime. Congratulations Johanna Storm, another great event!\n\nFollowing on from the Australian launch, the CUPRA City Garage atmosphere was electric when we held our own night to introduce Sydney to the CUPRA Born. Thanks to everyone for making this night such a memorable event. DJ Stacie fields kept the vibe high, everyone enjoyed the amazing catering by Three Blue Ducks, and the Travla beers! The CUPRA Born is the brand's first all-electric model. If you've had doubts about electric vehicles, come and take this one for a test drive - the Born goes from 0-50km in 2.8 seconds, and offers over 500km of driving range.

It‚Äôs the first launch of an ‚Äúall-new‚Äù Amarok model in the last 12 years, and it didn‚Äôt disappoint. Across all models, VW has really understood what their customers expect. There are big screens, 360 degree camera, ‚ÄòIQ matrix‚Äô lights and a longer body means more leg room for passengers in the rear. Safety is a big feature, with curtain airbags, a centre front airbag, as well as active safety systems such as auto-emergency braking. There is a heap of other features, and it looks great too! Let me know if you‚Äôd like to know more about it and I‚Äôll put you in touch with one of our team. Alto Volkswagen North Shore | Volkswagen Group Australia #vw #vwamarok\n\nThe 100% electric CUPRA Born was launched in Canberra - and the night itself was electric! The launch was everything you‚Äôd expect from CUPRA - DJ‚Äôs, drinks, live music - and Ministry Of Sound taking it to the next level. Of course the star of the night was the Cupra Born - and for so many good reasons. Come and find out why in our CUPRA City Garage Sydney / CUPRA Artarmon.\n\nThere's no shortage of ways that CUPRA demonstrate they are a lifestyle brand, and the commitment to innovation and experiential events play a big part in that. CUPRA powered the National event when the Ministry of Sound toured Australia and recently launched the 'Out of Home' campaign with Rosalia, one of the most significant international artists, where billboards provided a phone number inviting passers-by to chat on WhatsApp and receive audio messages from Rosalia. And now this.... the launch of the first all-electric SUV coupe, CUPRA Tavascan. In addition, a vision of the future was revealed with the CUPRA Dark Rebel, a virtual supercar. These are all examples of how CUPRA thinks outside the box and why it's such an exciting product to work with. We've got exciting things coming up at our Cupra City Garage too. So stay tuned for details, and please come and join in. CUPRA | CUPRA City Garage Sydney / CUPRA Artarmon | #ministryofsound"
