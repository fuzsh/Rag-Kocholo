        "text": "LEINSTER NAMED THEIR team to face Castres earlier today and while Luke Fitzgerald was handed his first start in seven months there was still no place for Antipodean import Ben Te’o as he makes the switch from rugby league.\n\nInstead, Te’o will wear the 13 jersey for Girvan Dempsey’s A team away to Carmarthen Quins tomorrow (kick-off 2.30). Te’o's array of skills has many people excited at what he can bring to the Leinster squad as they search for a long-term replacement for Brian O’Driscoll at outside centre. Te’o is partnered in midfield by Steve Crosbie, who also captains the side.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere is the rest of the team.\n\nLeinster A:\n\n15: Billy Dardis\n\n14: Sam Coghlan-Murray\n\n13: Ben Te’o\n\n12: Steve Crosbie CAPTAIN\n\n11: Cian Kelleher\n\n10: Cathal Marsh\n\n9: Nick Mc Carthy\n\n1: Peter Dooley\n\n2: Aaron Dundon\n\n3: Oisín Heffernan\n\n4: Gavin Thornbury\n\n5: Ben Marshall\n\n6: Peadar Timmins\n\n7: Josh Van Der Flier\n\n8: Jordan Coghlan\n\n16: James Tracy\n\n17: Jeremy Loughman\n\n18: Ross Molony\n\n19: Daniel Leavy\n\n20: Adam Griggs\n\n21: Ross Byrne\n\n22: Adam Byrne\n\nConnacht ring in the changes for tough trip to Exeter\n\nTwo changes as Ulster look to take out European kings Toulon"
