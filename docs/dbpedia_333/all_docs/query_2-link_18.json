        "text": "TERENURE COLLEGE 71 BUCCANEERS 13, Lakelands Park\n\nTerenure College were crowned Energia Bateman Cup champions for the first time, doing it in clinical fashion with a 71-13 final win over an understrength Buccaneers team at Lakelands Park.\n\nFull-back Adam La Grue ran in a hat-trick on a night that 'Nure racked up 11 tries, with Buccaneers' only consolation a 69th-minute converted effort from replacement Robert Teape.\n\nIt took a sterling effort from the host club's players and volunteers to clear snow from the pitch and ensure the game went ahead, and Terenure quickly hit top gear on the all-weather surface to score five tries in 28 minutes.\n\nLa Grue touched down twice and Craig Adams, Alan Bennie and Niall Lalor also chipped in with scores, Buccaneers getting off the mark through Michael Hanley and Stephen Mannion penalties but trailing 31-6 at the break.\n\nMissing their Connacht Academy contingent and some other key players, a battling Buccs deservedly got over the whitewash, but 'Nure secured their first senior national title since 2014's Division 1B win with further scores from Adams, Sam Coghlan Murray, captain Harrison Brewer, Lalor, La Grue and Conor McCormack.\n\nTerenure gave a warning of their power-packed mauling with a monster fifth-minute drive almost seeing Jordan Coghlan score. Bennie's flicked pass opened the way for winger Adams to cross in the left corner.\n\nDooley converted and also added the extras to Bennie's 10th-minute score, the experienced scrum half scampering through a gap off another ground-gaining maul from his forwards.\n\nBuccaneers gained some traction from their tactical kicking, forcing 'Nure offside and Hanley slotted a fine long-range strike to reduce the arrears to 14-3.\n\nThe hosts swiftly snapped back with their third try, Adams cutting past four defenders from halfway before deftly sending a grubber kick through for La Grue to dot down. Dooley added a smashing conversion from out wide.\n\nBuccs began the second quarter with a terrific penalty from distance from Mannion, who rewarded a strong carry by Conor Fitzgibbon. However, they lost possession from the restart and centre Fitzgibbon was sin-binned for a deliberate knock-on.\n\n'Nure made them pay with two quick-fire tries, flanker Lalor crossing from a zippy Bennie pass before a superb break by Campbell Classon ended with La Grue touching down from the prop's offload off the deck.\n\nImportantly for the Pirates, their defence improved closing in on the interval. Frankie Hopkins' rip in a tackle thwarted one 'Nure attack, and Buccs flanker Sean O'Connell increased his influence at the breakdown by winning two penalties.\n\nInto the second half, senior debutant Andrew Evans did really well to cover a kick chase led by Adam Melia, yet Buccs could not clear the danger and Adams countered smartly, dummying and sidestepping through to complete his brace.\n\nDooley was back on target with a sweet strike from the right wing to convert Coghlan Murray's 48th-minute effort, the Buccs defence worn down with crisp passes from Bennie, Dooley and Stephen O'Neill putting the wing over from close range.\n\nThe Midlanders conceded again four minutes later, the ball sitting up from James Thornton's clever chip in behind and Brewer was there to dot down. Dooley swung over another well-struck conversion, making it 52-6.\n\nAfter Lalor had used another well-set maul to bag his brace, Buccs enjoyed a rare purple patch. Replacement Mathias O'Neill made an impact, but out-half Hanley missed touch from a subsequent penalty on the hour mark.\n\nIn response, 'Nure replacement Cathal Marsh's dummy and pass played in La Grue for his hat-trick score. Then it was the turn of the visitors' pack to build through the phases, getting in sight of the try-line from a penalty.\n\nBetter ball retention resulted in Teape going over out wide on the left, Hanley's skip pass did the damage with Ross Murphy Sweeney running an important decoy line. Hanley's conversion took the Pirates onto 13 points.\n\n'Nure, who keep the Bateman Cup in the capital after Lansdowne's triumph last year, had a near miss when a foot in touch saw the rampaging La Grue denied another score. They did close out the scoring right at the death though, McCormack burrowing over for Thornton to convert.\n\nScorers - Terenure College: Tries: Craig Adams 2, Alan Bennie, Adam La Grue 3, Niall Lalor 2, Sam Coghlan Murray, Harrison Brewer, Conor McCormack; Cons: Caolan Dooley 7, James Thornton\n\nBuccaneers: Try: Robert Teape; Con: Michael Hanley; Pens: Michael Hanley, Stephen Mannion\n\nHT: Terenure College 31 Buccaneers 6\n\nTERENURE COLLEGE: Adam La Grue; Sam Coghlan Murray, Stephen O'Neill, Caolan Dooley, Craig Adams; James Thornton, Alan Bennie; Campbell Classon, Levi Vaughan, Adam Tuite, Harrison Brewer (capt), Mick Melia, Adam Melia, Niall Lalor, Jordan Coghlan.\n\nReplacements: Robbie Smyth, Conor McCormack, Andy Keating, Matthew Caffrey, Mike Murphy, Luke Clohessy, Cathal Marsh, Colm de Buitléar.\n\nBUCCANEERS: Andrew Evans; Harry Balsiger, Conor Fitzgibbon, Stephen Mannion, Ross Murphy Sweeney; Michael Hanley, Frankie Hopkins; James Kelly, Steveni Lombard, Martin Staunton (capt), Fionn McDonnell, Ruairi Byrne, Sean O'Connell, Cathal Walsh, Luke Balsiger.\n\nReplacements: Oisin Dolan, Charlie Byrne, Cian Daly, Dylan Bolger, Mathias O’Neill, Jack Scouler, Robert Teape.
