        "text": "Abstract\n\nIn 1896–1897, Louisa Lawson (1848–1920) filed a number of patent applications. This article explains how her inventions were an expression of modern feminist practice and aligned with the progressive suffragette campaign for equal economic rights for women. It plots the unrelenting opposition to Lawson’s entrepreneurship and explains why her successful litigation to enforce her legal rights was a hollow victory. This history raises significant questions of contemporary relevance about law, culture, power and political strategy demonstrating the historical resistance of all major institutions of the modern democratic state – unions, bureaucracy, parliament and the courts – to gender inclusion.\n\nKeywords:\n\nWomen’s suffrage\n\npatents\n\npublic service\n\npolitical corruption\n\nunion movement\n\nIn 1896–1897, journalist and publisher Louisa Lawson (1848–1920) filed a number of patent applications. This article explains how these inventions were an expression of modern feminist practice and aligned with progressive suffragist values. Progressive suffragists engaged with the labour movement and emphasised the importance of equal economic rights for women. Lawson’s technical achievements were recognised by Sir William Charles Windeyer as ‘another substantial proof of the ability of women to add to the world’s wealth by their exercise of their brain power’.Footnote1 Her claiming a productive role in industry and commerce was a public retort to male unionists, bureaucrats and politicians seeking to restrict the employment opportunities of women and confine them within the institution of marriage as dependents of men. Lawson’s entrepreneurial effort to exploit her patent rights was met with strident, somewhat co-ordinated resistance from several senior public servants, politicians and industrialists to ensure her entrepreneurship came to nought. Even though the courts upheld Lawson’s patent rights in 1902, the damages award was woefully inadequate and the outcome financially ruinous. The fight over her patent rights directly contributed to the demise of her successful printing business that employed women, best known for publishing Lawson’s suffragist newspaper, The Dawn (1888–1905). Lawson did not lack friends and influence in Sydney society, but because the subjugation of Lawson was largely waged in private, it was hard for her to anticipate and combat those plotting against her and the progressive labour cause. While women over the age of 21 won the right to vote in Federal and NSW elections in 1902, the aftermath of Lawson’s litigation shows the importance of understanding the cultural hegemony of the modern state. In Lawson’s case, key state institutions were underpinned by a culturally conservative brotherhood set on restricting women’s life opportunities and her notable failure to conform to their expectations of a woman’s role marked her for repression.\n\nLawson’s progressive feminism\n\nBiographies attest to Lawson’s life as a rural working woman with few financial resources and a complicated, unhappy marriage as formative experiences.Footnote2 Struggling to survive on a small, uneconomic selection at Eurunderee near Mudgee, with a difficult husband who was often absent, Louisa ran the farm, supplementing her income by dressmaking and running the local post office.Footnote3 She had a practical approach to creating opportunities for herself, her children and working people in the community. This also led to first-hand experience of the nature of some of the barriers to achieving social change. For example, Susan Margery notes:\n\nWhen her first two sons were of an age to need schooling, she campaigned to persuade others in the district to petition the education authorities for a school, land on which to build it, and financial aid for it. A building committee was set up, at her suggestion, but – because she was a woman – she could not be a member. She could not even attend its meetings. She listened to its deliberations through a crack in the wall of the bar of an old inn in which the committee met.Footnote4\n\nHer feminism was grounded in a belief in women’s equality where women’s inherent capabilities were being stifled owing to unjust and immoral restrictions. After her move to Sydney and separation from her husband in 1883, Lawson was very active in civic circles. She affiliated with various suffragist groups, including founding and hosting The Dawn Club, a meeting place to campaign and discuss the feminist cause, affiliated with her suffragist newspaper, The Dawn. In 1901 she joined the Women’s Progressive Association, a breakaway group of the Womanhood Suffrage League (WSL) with close ties to the labour movement.Footnote5 Journalist George G. Reeve, a long-time friend of Henry Lawson, wrote after Louisa’s death about the depth of her commitment: ‘Mrs Lawson is no armchair propagandist. She knew from personal investigations the conditions under which women worked in factories and had also made a close study of housing and hygiene problems’.Footnote6\n\nHer advocacy targeted all those who would confine women to the domestic sphere with the aim of restoring an evolutionary pathway where a woman could ‘take her rightful place in the world as man’s recognised equal’.Footnote7 All women who, deciding that ‘there is no sex in occupation’, might set about working a farm, managing a mine, successfully conducting the affairs of a counting room or planning a house, if they were permitted the freedom to choose their own path.Footnote8\n\nLawson’s writing, in particular in The Dawn, was designed to appeal to a broad cross section of readers, many of whom identified as wives and mothers. The original subtitle, ‘A Journal for Australian Women’, was replaced by a more inclusive, ‘A Journal for the Household’. The publication presented political opinions about a wide range of public affairs and social ills mixed with household hints, international news about the achievements of suffragists, stories, poems and advertising. Articles prioritised women exercising social, economic and political agency in all endeavours, including in the home.Footnote9 The home was imagined not as sanctuary, but more as a workplace ruled over by a husband or father, where women should be relieved of burdens where possible. Outside the family home, working women lacked the same accommodation privileges as men. There were no residential clubs or chambers for business women and in boarding houses women were subject to unsympathetic surveillance.Footnote10\n\nLawson explained that having a voice within parliament and contributing to lawmaking was crucial because: ‘She bears a full half of the trouble when the affairs of state are depressed, an unjust law or the lack of law brings to her life care or hardship or injury as it does to men, yet none of the deputies ask what she wishes – why should they, she has no vote.’Footnote11 Denial of the right to vote was only one source of injustice identified. Lawson parted from many conservative and middle-class suffragists on the institution of marriage. Editorials and articles penned by Lawson pointed out that married women were akin to unpaid employees of their husbands. Unpaid labour was a key source of dependency and exploitation, and for many, marriage contributed to great unhappiness:\n\n… there are the women, weak, unorganised, and isolated.\n\nDoes a man concede to his employee wife, defined hours of rest, fair pay, just and considerate treatment? … Surely it must be admitted that she needs the protection of a union as much as a working man?Footnote12\n\nLawson pointed out that when working in a family business alongside her husband, a woman may contribute an equal share, but under the Married Women’s Property Act 1879 (NSW), she was only entitled to profits when she earned separate wages and banked them in her own name. Lawson considered the situation one that caused ‘two-thirds of all domestic trouble’.Footnote13 And of course, not all women married. Young women had to earn a living, some women never sought marriage, and others were widowed.\n\nThe Dawn heralded the emergence of women in professional classes across the globe: doctors, lawyers, factory inspectors, police warders, teachers, artists, journalists, photographers, dentists, compositors, bookkeepers, typists. Lawson argued that women with the attributes of common sense, conscientiousness, patience and industry had a particular aptitude for business. Business women, such as herself, were more efficient, economical and persevering, with the strength of being civil, forthright and not wasting time. Working-class women in English speaking countries had managed household finances for generations, she argued. Given the chance to serve in the public service, women ‘always win encomiums’.Footnote14\n\n‘One man’s daughter competing with another girl’s father or brother’Footnote15: the fight with the typographical union\n\nThe international and NSW union movement fractured around suffrage for women, in particular where it entailed a claim of economic equality, understanding that the campaign had implications for political demands for ‘one man, one vote’ and the constitution of the union movement. Some in the union movement wanted to contain membership in line with small traditional closed guilds, others argued the union should be open to all white male workers. More radical unionists argued there should be no race or sex discrimination in the fight against capitalists.Footnote16 Lawson’s position was that: ‘The cause of women’s enfranchisement is a movement closely allied to that of Labour Reform’. She argued that the ‘low wages paid for female labour, which are a disgrace to our civilisation, continually tend to keep down the rate of pay for all classes of workers’.Footnote17\n\nConsistent with her principles, Lawson employed 10 women on a full- and part-time basis in her printing business. This led to a confrontation with a conservative union, the NSW Typographical Association. The union refused to admit women members and accused Lawson of paying below award rates.Footnote18 They called for a boycott, leading to a loss of advertising and newsagents refusing to carry The Dawn. Responding in her publication Lawson chose her words carefully. She did not directly address what her female workers were paid. Rather, she complained the actions were designed to bankrupt her:\n\nAssociated labour seems to be in its own small way as dictatorial as associated capital …\n\nNow we distinctly assert we do not employ women because they work more cheaply; we have no sympathy whatever with those who employ a woman in preference to a man, merely because they think she will do as much work for a lower wage …\n\nTrades’ unions would dispute, or force out of sight if possible, the right of women to enter the labour market at all.Footnote19\n\nIt is likely she did not pay her female employees the same award rate as men. Lawson weathered union opposition to the printing of The Dawn, drawing on support from progressive unionists and the suffragist movement, but the wider assault on women’s employment soon morphed into an attempt to force women’s issues out of sight by causing disruption to her magazine’s distribution.\n\nTensions within the public service\n\nLegislation introduced into the NSW Parliament in 1873 by former journalist and newspaper proprietor, Henry Parkes, entitled registered newspapers to free postage if mailed within seven days of issue, with postage charged the rate of one penny thereafter.Footnote20 A broad range of printed subject matter qualified for free postage.Footnote21 The decision to register a title sat within the discretion of the Postmaster General (PMG).Footnote22 With her experience running a rural post office, and her publication containing what was a familiar mix of news, social commentary, stories, poems, broader items of women’s interests and paid advertising for the times, Lawson assumed The Dawn would qualify for registration when launched in 1888. This was an important factor, as distribution was largely by subscription. It sold for three pence an issue or three shillings for a year’s subscription.\n\nThe Postage Acts Amendment 1893 (NSW) explicitly broadened the discretion of the PMG to accept or deny a publication for registration ‘by reason of the proportion of advertisements to other matter therein or for any other reason is not within the description’.Footnote23 Based upon this amendment Secretary of the Postal Service, James Dalgarno (1841–1915), refused to register The Dawn as a newspaper. It is not clear if he objected to Lawson personally and, if so, whether this was due to her profile, personality or some previous experience with her.Footnote24 However, there was no legal process for appeal: an intervention by Justice William Windeyer (1834–1897), whose wife, Lady Mary Elizabeth (Bolton) Windeyer (1836–1912), was President of the WSL and friend of Lawson, led to a reprieve.Footnote25\n\nDalgarno’s objection to registering The Dawn likely involved more than a legal concern as to the ‘balance’ of political news and supplementary material. His actions need to be understood in light of broader political debates occurring within government and the public service which impacted attitudes and practices in the Post and Telegraph Department.\n\nThe shift to scientific management of the state and the economy that emerged in the UK in the 1880s was adopted in the Australian colonies.Footnote26 In 1894, NSW Government Statistician and architect of that colony’s new Public Service Board, Timothy Coghlan, suggested new gendered statistical indicators of national prosperity:\n\n… the condition of a country can in some measure be gauged by the number of such women as are compelled to seek occupations other than in their domestic sphere. When the proportion of such women is large, it may be assumed that the material condition of the country is worse than that of another country where the proportion is small.Footnote27\n\nA low birth rate was also identified as an indicator of economic weakness, because he identified contraception and the separation of wives and husbands owing to working conditions as causal factors.Footnote28 One of the legacies of Coghlan’s tenure was to remove women’s labour from official statistics unless the woman was a sole breadwinner. This helped pave the way for arbitrations between unions and industrialists about fair pay that excluded consideration of women workers. In 1907, the Harvester decision set a minimum basic ‘family wage’, but women were only accounted for as dependents.Footnote29\n\nAustralian women, and in particular, country women (including Lawson for a short time), were often engaged in postal work and, from the 1880s, women were increasingly employed in telegraphic work. Placement in short-term and insecure employment was not controversial. However, largely through family patronage, some women had obtained well-paid positions in country and suburban postal offices. As populations grew, so did the scale and significance of these offices. There were no roles for women in the head office.Footnote30\n\nIn line with broader reforms to the public service, the Post and Telegraph Department began to centralise operations within a tighter management structure. Women’s employment came under scrutiny as part of this shift. A harbinger of the increasingly popular view on the employment of women was given in 1888 by Edward Cracknell, Superintendent of the Telegraphs Department, to his putative superior, Secretary of the Postmaster General’s Department, Stephen Harbord Lambton (1832–1907):\n\nI have found the ladies who joined the Dep’t in the past have done so not with any fixed idea of remaining, in all cases, but merely as a means of employment until such time as they could change their condition for that of marriage.Footnote31\n\nMarried women became the target of attacks within the public service. Though many women had gained acceptance in managerial level postal roles, in 1892 the NSW Post and Telegraph Department introduced a ban on the appointment of married women to postal offices that had residences attached to them, that is, post offices of a significant size, where the duties of the postmistress would involve supervision of staff.Footnote32 Vines notes that the effect of departmental rules was to undermine the newly created legal rights gained by the passage of Married Women’s Property Acts of 1879 and 1893 (NSW). While the legislation envisaged women as capable of exercising legal and economic autonomy, under the department rule women were treated as dependents subject to their husband’s rule and unable to manage on their own. Regardless of the intention of the law, restrictions placed on women included situations where there was no husband on the scene, such as where there was a judicial separation. In 1895, Coghlan drafted the Public Service Act 1895 (NSW), which introduced a ban on the appointment of married women unless there were special circumstances. Vines’ study of postmistress Annie Ludford traces the outcome. After the passage of the Public Service Act, Ludford ended up with a heavier workload than men in a comparable position, and she was denied a postal assistant. She also received far less pay, and even a modest wage increase promised to her did not eventuate. Policies designed to strengthen and modernise the state led to a real decline in public service working conditions for women employees through dismissal, demotion and salary reduction.Footnote33\n\nDalgarno’s initial attempt to disrupt the distribution of The Dawn could be seen in the context of these initiatives. He failed because Lawson had elite male social contacts who could wield influence and protect her. Her mail bag invention would lead to further conflict with Dalgarno.\n\nLawson’s inventions\n\nLawson had the interest, acumen and insight to invent new mechanical devices in the 1890s, alongside her political, business and family commitments. Staged public celebrations of women’s industrial achievements and contributions to the material wealth of the nation were commonly featured as part of suffragist campaigning. One example is the Exhibition of Women’s Industry and Centenary Fair (1888) organised by Lawson’s friend, Lady Mary Windeyer. The exhibition featured many traditional arts, including needlepoint, knitting and cooking and Fine Arts, as well as developments in education, and ‘in several sections the advantages of technical training are seen’.Footnote34 The Organisers entreated young women to follow the European example ‘where each member of a family feels it a privilege to contribute to the general income, where young people are happy in working with the needle, brush or in some branch of mechanical industry during a portion of every day or evening’. A selection of works from the exhibition was subsequently forwarded to represent NSW in the ‘Women’s Work’ section of the World’s Columban Exhibition Chicago (Chicago World Fair) 1893.Footnote35 The Chicago exhibition prominently displayed women’s inventions.Footnote36\n\nLawson’s practical and direct attitude to politics led to a more hands-on approach to demonstrating women’s technical prowess.Footnote37 Her inventions were a working woman’s form of personal expression, with the potential to generate meaningful income. Drawing upon her experience and background, she filed three patent applications. These inventions were an improved combination buckle and fastener for a mailbag (1896);Footnote38 an improved bottle and means to detect refilling of same (1897);Footnote39 and a self-adjusting curtain holder (1897).Footnote40 Of these, only the first proceeded to examination and grant.\n\nLawson’s patent application\n\nColonial patent statutes were convoluted and sparse in detail.Footnote41 Legislation provided that the author or designer of ‘an improvement to the arts or manufacturers’ petition the Governor and pay five pounds to the Minister of Justice.Footnote42 Details as to the form and content of a patent application were found in Department of Justice instructions issued by the patent examiner and published in The Yearbook of New South Wales.Footnote43 Many applicants either were unaware of these regulations or did not understand them. The patent profession, which developed legal–technical expertise to service inventors seeking to apply for a patent, was only coming into existence. The expertise of this new profession would change the significance of the patent specification. It would transition from being a practical explanation of technical achievement by the inventive worker to become a more abstract legal-technical description that enabled the specification to better function as a financial instrument for the investor.\n\nLawson’s initial draft specification for the mail bag fastener was handwritten by her and very brief in detail. In essence, her technical accomplishment was combining a mail bag buckle with a lock and seal so the lock could not be opened without breaking the wax seal. The invention was designed to prevent mail bag tampering. This application was accepted, and she was formally notified of this on 27 January 1897. The patent was valid for 14 years from the date she filed her provisional specification on 5 February 1896. Corresponding patent applications were filed in Queensland, South Australia and Victoria.Footnote44\n\nLike many other specifications drafted by inventors themselves, Lawson’s had legal deficiencies. The scope of a patent monopoly was supposed to be defined by up to six technical claims that followed the general description of the invention. Establishing patent infringement involved testing the alleged infringing invention against these patent claims. Lawson’s original specification included no claims at all. In 1898, she attended the patent office and was advised that it was worth seeking professional assistance and submitting an amended specification so that she could enforce her rights more easily if they were infringed. This step was initiated in November 1898.Footnote45 Lawson’s patent attorney, Edward Waters, entirely redrafted the specification adding two claims.\n\nThe examiner’s initial reaction was to reject the amended specification under the Patent Law Amendment Act 1895 (NSW) because the changes involved ‘such a sweeping alteration as the substitution of an entirely new description’. Extensive changes to descriptions of the invention were not permitted. However, he decided to allow it, finding that it was merely a revision of the invention of an ‘untutored’ applicant into language describing the invention ‘a clear and skilful manner’.Footnote46 The amended specification, including amended technical drawings (see ), was subsequently accepted.\n\nLouisa Lawson, An improved combination buckle and fastener for a mailbag, Patent No. 6371/96 (NSW).\n\nExploiting her invention\n\nLawson had the buckles manufactured from brass in Birmingham. This entailed a significant upfront cost. She used local workers to assemble it, adding other components such as leather straps. While her patent application was still proceeding through the examination process in NSW, Lawson arranged for the mail bag fastener to be mass produced.\n\nFrom an entrepreneurial perspective, patenting a technology that could be sold to the government was a smart decision. The postal service officially supplied mail bags to ensure the secure conveyance of mail. If her technology was patented, and the department preferred the buckle to the existing supplier, it would generate significant income with little effort. It would be difficult for others to compete without infringing her patent. She would be guaranteed profit from wholesale supply with no middleman taking a cut. There was no need for her to establish an extensive sales or office administration. Though her patent would expire in 1910, she would be well placed for future contracts. Confident in the significance of her technical achievement, Lawson sent samples of her buckles to post offices across the Australian colonies. In August 1896, Sir William Windeyer also made inquiries in London on her behalf, co-ordinated with Lawson’s sending samples to the London General Post Office for consideration.Footnote47\n\nHowever, Lawson’s patent application for a mail bag fastener was provocative. This was due not to the technical features of the invention but to its politics. It was controversial because of who the inventor was and what Lawson’s visibility as a woman inventor, achieving a significant government contract, could signify to the public.\n\nTake up of Lawson’s invention was actively promoted by Lambton and some, but not all, officials in the NSW PMG Head Office.Footnote48 Starting as a clerk in 1852, Lambton had risen through the ranks to the top executive position, Deputy PMG. However, an anticipated establishment of a Federal postal service would lead to the phasing out of state offices in their historic form. Then in his mid-sixties Lambton was expected to retire.Footnote49 Lawson’s account of her dealings with Lambton cast him in a positive light. It is likely that at times he admired her. It could also be that there were office politics in play. However, owing to his reading of other office correspondence that Lawson would have been unaware of, Lawson’s biographer Matthews refers to Lambton as ‘more mercurial than can easily be justified in a high ranking public servant’.Footnote50 Lawson never casts his involvement in what transpired in a negative light, and it was not in her character to hold back to spare the feelings of others. Lambton was renowned for being courteous, but he ‘did not believe in wasting time in idle conversation … [he was] anxious for his many callers to quickly reach the main points of the subjects of the interviews, and for them to depart’.Footnote51 He and Lawson were likely similar in personality.\n\nIn late September 1896, Lambton officially substituted Lawson’s buckle (patent pending), for the original buckle that had been designed by Wyndham Davies, PMG Inspection Branch, 20 years earlier.Footnote52 Lawson was to receive one shilling four pence per buckle, a figure subsequently raised to one shilling, eight pence. This return provided for a very small profit on cost price, and thus the financial strategy required high-volume sales. Davies and Lambton provided ongoing encouragement. Dalgarno, however, discouraged her. He wrote to Lawson, advising that based on his own trial, the fasteners proved deficient because the wax would not adhere to the brass. He would discontinue their use.Footnote53\n\nLambton then conducted another two-year trial, after which he provided her with a testimonial as to the buckle being ‘in all respects superior to any other fastener’:\n\nThis is to certify that the mail bag fastener supplied to this Department by Mrs Louisa Lawson has been tested and been in use for some considerable time, and it is found to give great speed in closing, it being estimated that three bags can now be closed in the same time as it took to enclose one under the old arrangement. No twine whatever is required, and a very considerable saving in wax is effected. In addition to these advantages, it has been found to provide greater security than any fastening that has previously been in use in this Department.Footnote54\n\nIn December 1900, Lawson received an ‘urgent request’ to keep up supply. This led to her cabling England for 6,000 buckles. There was no formal process leading to a new contract with the PMG. Agreements might be enforceable without being reduced to writing, and ad hoc arrangements were not uncommon in business in this period, even in dealings with government departments. But ideally tenders for public contracts should have been advertised and the name of the successful tenderer published. In this case, it is probable that the arrangement was kept informal deliberately. Time was of the essence, but also, with Federation disrupting normal proceedings and internal politics, it may have been difficult to arrange for a tender to be advertised and a reluctance by Lambton to make public his decision to award a contract to Lawson. He was well aware of anticipated personnel changes in the position of Deputy PMG. Lambton’s retirement was announced at the Federal Postal Conference by the new PMG, William Patrick Crick MLA, in late 1900. Dalgarno was named as the new Deputy PMG.Footnote55 Offering a large government contract to a noisy, radical feminist was a provocative outgoing act by Lambton. Still Lawson’s casual attention to business formalities created a legal vulnerability. She relied on her personal relationship with Lambton at a time when his influence and interest in the arrangement were waning, owing to pressure from Crick. Davies, who had the best technical knowledge of the invention in the PMG Office, remained steadfast in his support of her.Footnote56 The following January, Lambton also sought supply of 18 graduated specimen buckles to present to the Head of the Federal Postal Conference, suggesting the probability of their adoption by the newly formed Commonwealth. She anticipated it would earn her £1,200 a year.Footnote57\n\nAt the same time Lambton was suggesting increased sales for Lawson, Crick was advising her to the contrary: ‘her patent was to be thrown out and (from another source) that a pirated adaptation was being foisted into place by a syndicate of influential men’. Lawson was also told by the company she had commissioned to supply leather straps that her urgent order in December could not be fulfilled because they were working on another fastener for the PMG.\n\nLawson was in a quandary about what to do. She had also been negotiating with the governments of Victoria and New Zealand about the take-up of her invention, but this came to a halt when she suffered a terrible tram accident on 31 January 1900, an accident from which she never fully recovered. She said she was not in a fit physical or mental state to respond to Crick and Dalgarno.Footnote58 However, before Lambton finally left office, Lawson wrote to the Deputy PMG, formally advising him that a piracy had occurred. She asked the Department to honour their agreement with her.Footnote59\n\nA syndicate of influential men\n\nThe ‘syndicate’ were members of the NSW Legislative Assembly and a businessman, Edward Nicol Murray. Murray had started out with a hardware store in Sydney’s inner west. His commercial interests grew to include the Parramatta Woollen Mill and Murrays Department Store.Footnote60 The politicians included: Lieutenant-Colonel William John Ferris (1855–1917), Member for Parramatta 1898–1901, an auctioneer and real estate agent; Thomas Whitford Taylor (1844–1938), Member for Canterbury 1900–1901, independently wealthy; Arthur Hill Griffith (1861–1946), Member for Waratah (Newcastle) 1894–1917, patent attorney; Francis Edward McLean (1863–1926), Member for Marrickville 1894–1901, public accountant and insurance and estate agent. Another politician implicated in the scheme is, of course, the PMG, Patrick Crick (1862–1908), Member for West Macquarie 1889–1906, a criminal lawyer and former proprietor of Truth, who struggled with a serious alcohol addiction.Footnote61 Crick maintained his criminal law practice while PMG. His real interest was in the Lands Ministry, but he originally declined a ministerial role claiming it would interfere with his criminal law practice.Footnote62 He only served as PMG for a little over a year (1899–1901). Crick’s actions in the Lands Ministry (1901–1904) would be referred to a Royal Commission. He was suspected of taking bribes and struck off the solicitor’s role in 1907.Footnote63 Matthews names Crick as the main instigator, working with Delgarno, both motivated by anti-suffragist attitudes. He also notes that Davies believed there was a connection between the conspirators and organised crime.Footnote64\n\nIt is difficult to work out from archival records the links amongst this group of men.Footnote65 Affiliations of the parliamentarians crossed policy divides. Ferris and Taylor both had very short and undistinguished political careers. McLean was actively involved on numerous committees, including the Elections and Qualifications Committee. Griffith and Crick were veteran NSW politicians, both Labor members, both Irish and both respected for their independent and unconventional attitudes on all sorts of issues. Ferris and Crick were Protectionist. McClean was Free Trade. Griffith favoured state ownership and open union membership, and was a vocal supporter of industrial arbitration and collective bargaining. Griffith acted as Murray’s patent attorney but was clearly an outlier in terms of his political values and practices.Footnote66 They reported different religious affiliations: Church of England, Methodist, Roman Catholic. With Catholics in the mix, Freemason connections seem unlikely.\n\nPrior to the Murray invention appearing, Lawson noted three separate attempts by others to get the Post Office to accept piracies. Each was rebuffed by the mail inspector, Davies. Lawson said that while she was in hospital, Murray also ‘pestered my daughter … for a supply of the buckles’, claiming he wanted them for a different purpose. She claimed the effort by the syndicate to pressure the GPO to throw out her invention and accept Murray’s substitute was a consequence of her daughter’s statement that Lawson was the exclusive supplier to the Post Department.Footnote67\n\nLawson names Ferris and Taylor as the instigators who introduced Murray to Crick. Murray, Ferris, Taylor and McLean all have connections with inner west and southwest Sydney businesses and finance.Footnote68 They were not actively anti-suffragist, but perhaps were casually so. Though a loose brotherhood, Murray, Ferris, Taylor, McLean and Crick likely shared the values of self-interest and greed, knowing that control of the economic base had far-reaching economic, political and cultural consequences.Footnote69 None had respect for the patent of the woman inventor. They all assumed it could easily be overcome.\n\nThe piracy\n\nThe Department set aside the existing arrangement with Lawson and placed an order with Murray for 5,000 buckles in January 1900 at two shillings and six pence, a significantly higher price than Lawson’s one shilling and eight pence. Again, there appears to be no formal tender process, and there was no attempt to justify paying a higher price for the substitute.Footnote70 Murray then further muddied the waters by filing a patent application for a rival mail bag fastener on 20 August 1900. This ‘invention’ bore many similarities to Lawson’s but had some additional features (see ).Footnote71\n\nE.N. Murray, An improved sealing buckle for use on mailbags and the like, Patent No. 10,388/1900 (NSW).\n\nThere were a number of very serious problems with Murray’s application. Firstly, Murray’s title to the invention was challenged. Ambrose Thompson, an inner west boarding house proprietor, land agent and money lender, claimed he was the true inventor.Footnote72 However, a number of former associates of Thompson rejected this, claiming he had stolen ‘their’ invention. Second, Lawson advised that it was an infringement of her patent and third, Murray had already accepted an offer to sell the buckle to the PMG. Prior use of an invention was not permitted, prior to filing a patent application.Footnote73\n\nAs Murray’s patent application was under a cloud, the PMG took advice from the Attorney General. However, the portfolio of the Department of Justice also included the Patent Office. Unsurprisingly, the Attorney General did not interfere or give advice that could be seen as interfering with the examination of a patent application. However, Mail Inspector Davies filed an affidavit in support of Lawson’s version of events.Footnote74 Murray formally withdrew his application on 20 March 1901 ‘in consideration of the fact disclosed in the declaration filed by Mrs Lawson shewing that a seal buckle with divided seal, lid and spring as described in my specification was shewn and offered for sale to the Postal authorities in this Colony long prior to this application’.Footnote75\n\nFollowing notice of Murray’s withdrawal of his patent application, in April 1901, Dalgarno, now Deputy PMG, sought a bond from Murray to indemnify the Department in light of pending litigation. In line with the usual tender conditions, he sought details of ‘the amount of all patent rights and royalties for the manufacture and use of any portion of the material’.Footnote76 The bond was paid by Murray, and 1,000 buckles were duly delivered.\n\nThe patent litigation\n\nIn June 1901, Lawson commenced action in the Equity Division for patent infringement. She sought an injunction to restrain the manufacture and sale of the infringing buckle and orders to deliver up remaining stock, an account of profits and damages. Murray filed a defence that challenged every aspect of Lawson’s patent grant: it was not a useful invention; it was not validly issued, owing to various inadequacies of the technical description; it did not meet the required standard of novelty and inventiveness because there were similar inventions for sale made by others; and he did not copy her invention. Murray also stretched the truth in saying that he did not withdraw his patent application, owing to Lawson’s opposition. He further disputed that either he or Lawson had obtained significant sales.\n\nBoth parties were well represented by leading members of the Bar. Lawson’s counsel was Dr William Cullen, a barrister whom, at that time, was also a Member of the Legislative Council (1895–1910). His junior was the son of the Chief Inspector for the PMG, inventor of the original fastener who considered the Murray buckle a piracy. He was named after his father, Wyndham Davies.Footnote77 With their personal connections, the pair were well placed to understand the full context of the dispute, and the family connection to Davies Senior would have reassured them of the strength of her claim Murray was represented by Alexander Gordon, also named after his father, a leading English Equity barrister, and Henry P. Owen.Footnote78\n\nFinding infringement\n\nThe matter came before A.H. Simpson the Chief Judge (CJ) in Equity. In total, six witnesses gave evidence for Murray, including a mechanical engineer and his patent attorney. Crick also gave evidence, admitting an error in entering into the agreement with Murray. Lawson tendered five exhibits. Presumably, this included examples of her own and infringing inventions and an advertisement for Thompson’s buckle.Footnote79 Two other persons gave oral evidence in support of her case. Murray’s claim he had evidence of prior inventions that could destroy Lawson’s patent did not survive scrutiny. The evidence he relied upon was from parties responsible for earlier piracies of Lawson’s invention. Another named party was Farmer & Co department store who merely stocked leather bags, likely ones that incorporated pirated fasteners.\n\nSimpson CJ in Equity found Murray had infringed Lawson’s patent and ordered an injunction to restrain further manufactures or sales of the buckles or ones that were only colourably different. In line with normal procedure, there was a need to supervise additional remedies, such as ascertaining how many infringing buckles were in the possession of Murray, his workman and agents, and the damages to which Lawson was entitled. She was also awarded costs, which would have to be assessed and taxed. It was the function of the Master in Equity to determine these matters.\n\nFollowing the ruling on infringement, Dalgarno decided to cease using this style of buckles altogether and pay out existing obligations to Murray ‘at the least possible cost to the department’.Footnote80 The Post Office terminated the arrangement with Murray, paying him £250 and returning the delivery of 1,000 buckles to him.\n\nAssessing Lawson’s loss\n\nOwing to Murray’s dealings with the GPO, Lawson had been left £300 out of pocket for an order of brass buckles with a pending delivery of 6,000 components, leading to an eventual stockpile of 7,000 for which she had no buyer. To satisfy her creditors, Lawson ‘broke up her home, sold her furniture, clothes and part of her printing plant’.Footnote81 She sought recovery of £300 plus the profits that would have been gained had she supplied the order for 5,000. Murray argued that Lawson’s loss was restricted to the 1,000 buckles he had already supplied to the GPO.\n\nThe Master in Equity, Henry Francis Barton, had a great deal of discretion in assessing loss and supervising orders.Footnote82 He took advice from Lawson’s two barristers and Murray’s solicitor. He determined that Lawson was entitled to £300, owing to the supply of 500 pirated buckles. Further, ‘the plaintiff but for the Dft’s action could and would have entered into a similar arrangement or contract and would have obtained orders for and have supplied the whole of such 5,000 fasteners and I estimate the damages on this basis’. The lost profit on this order was calculated at £437 and 10 pence. The total damages award amounted to £737.10. A certificate was issued to this effect on 17 June 1902.\n\nMurray disputed this assessment, arguing Lawson had suffered no damage, or that alternatively loss was limited to the profit on a total of 1,000 buckles that ended up in departmental use. The certificate of the Master listed evidence relied upon during the assessment of damages. It did not refer to Lawson having provided evidence, such as a written contract, in support of her claim of lost profits from a contract with the GPO. The Master did refer to Crick’s oral evidence, but it is unclear what bearing that had on the damages award. Summons were issued to both parties, and there was a hearing before Simpson CJ in Equity in chambers. This time, both parties were represented by Counsel. The appeal of the Master’s decree presented an opportunity to effectively rehear the evidence of loss. This hearing was not transcribed, which was not unusual at this time.\n\nOn 29 July 1902, Simpson CJ in Equity gutted Lawson’s expectations of reasonable damages, owing to a technical legal argument. He determined that damages were only available for direct loss caused by Murray’s delivery of 1,000 buckles, but not for consequential loss, that is, there would be no compensation for the loss of the GPO contract. Damages were reduced to £60 total. This amount was probably based on costings reported by Murray. The payment to Murray of £250 when additional buckles supplied to the PMG were returned to him does not appear to have been accounted for as part of the damages Lawson suffered. It is possible that Lawson’s counsel was unaware of the payment, or it was judged as irrelevant to assessing Lawson’s loss, being an ex gratia payment covering Murray’s expenditure on components and not a contributor to Murray’s profit. Lawson’s legal costs were assessed as £368 and eight pence, taxed at £230, 10 pence and four shillings.\n\nA judicial conspiracy?\n\nThe work of the Master in Equity is effectively performed on behalf of the judge, who retains the power to vary the Master’s decrees. An appeal being heard in chambers was also common practice in the jurisdiction of equity. It did not mean that the proceedings were dealt with in secret, but rather it reduced the costs of the parties.Footnote83\n\nHere, there was no opposition to an order for damages. There was a disagreement about the measure of damages, and the record does not reveal how her loss claim was substantiated. The parties were legally represented. Simpson CJ in Equity agreed with Murray’s counsel, Gordon and Owen, that a conservative approach to calculating loss was preferred in this instance. It is worth noting that Murray’s counsel, Owen, was respected enough to be appointed as Master in Equity following the trial’s conclusion, an appointment Simpson CJ in Equity was no doubt consulted on.Footnote84 Cullen also went on to be appointed Chief Justice of NSW in 1910.\n\nToday, Lawson could have sought recovery bringing an action in promissory estoppel given she had incurred expenses by acting in reliance of Lambton’s instructions. While contract law enforces the bargain as formally agreed to by the parties, promissory estoppel allows the enforcement of non-bargained-for, relied-upon promises, taking into account consideration of the broader context that led to loss. However, at the time, no such remedy had been developed.Footnote85\n\nThere is no evidence to support the view that the judiciary took a political view on Lawson, her invention or the suffragist cause. However, feminist legal theorists argue that private law principles are inherently gendered. The notion that legal subjects are forward-looking, rational, self-seeking actors is masculinist. When the court refrains from interfering with ‘freedom of contract’ they ignore consideration of the way sexual discrimination impacts women’s agency and why, in business, women are not free to act, or do not chose to act, as privileged men do.Footnote86 In Lawson’s case, the court’s narrow formalistic reading of her economic loss was a harsh outcome for her to bear.\n\nThe aftermath\n\nLawson felt that a significant injustice had occurred, of which the litigation was only one aspect. In The Dawn, she mentioned there being ‘a darker side, the details of which, when laid bare, would disgust every clean-living citizen of the commonwealth’. Regardless of the court decision, she thought greater compensation was due and asked for it:\n\nAfter two years of mental and physical pain, the worry of law courts, the sacrifice of home, the insults and brutality of paltry detectives and spies, the slander and misrepresentation of interested persons, together with a total loss of income, Mr Crick, who took the blame of the transaction in court, had minuted a recommendation that should she ask for compensation it should be favourably received.Footnote87\n\nHowever, Crick was no longer PMG, and no compensation was forthcoming. In December 1902, she wrote to Dalgarno advising him that ‘she was broken in health and financially resourceless’, praying he look favourably on her request. He replied briefly that her buckles were unsatisfactory, and the department had discontinued their use.Footnote88 But that was not to be the end of their correspondence.\n\nIn April 1903, Dalgarno exercised his powers under s 29 Post and Telegraph Act 1901, asking Lawson to show cause why The Dawn should not be deregistered as a newspaper because ‘the space devoted to news and current affairs is insufficient’.Footnote89 She replied with reference to a recent edition dated 1 March–1 April 1903, suggesting that 21 of 32 total pages fitted with the regulatory definition and that it was a newspaper in line with the generally accepted sense of the word.Footnote90 Dalgarno rebuffed her, referring to recent controversy about public debt. Free postage had been phased out following Federation with new federal postal rates established, but registered newspapers were afforded a special rate.Footnote91 In June 1903, Dalgarno deregistered The Dawn, instructing her to remove the endorsement of the GPO and the entitlement of transmission by post as a newspaper. There was no formal avenue for appeal. Windeyer was also now deceased.\n\nRallying her supporters\n\nThe patent litigation received press coverage, and there had been much public discussion about how Lawson had been ‘wronged’, but there was scant reference to specifics, such as who did what, and when. In January 1903, only a few months before The Dawn was deregistered, Lawson had published ‘A history of an invention’. It primarily comprises unedited correspondence with GPO personnel over the mail bag incident. With minimal context to help draw connections between events, it is barely comprehensible to readers unaware of the controversy.Footnote92 The reason for the unusual format was likely to limit the risk of her being sued for defamation. It was a copyright infringement, but this was ignored. Further litigation would have only caused greater embarrassment to the PMG. The letters do not cast Dalgarno in a favourable light. Dalgarno’s move to deregister The Dawn was arguably a response to this publication and his fear of more embarrassment to come.\n\nFour of the most powerful and representative of Women’s Leagues combined and lobbied for a Federal Select Committee to inquire into the treatment of Lawson by the Post Office, and for the remaining buckles to be taken by the PMG. A petition was presented to the lawyer and politician, (Arthur) Bruce Smith. Smith was a progressive liberal, against the White Australia Policy and strong supporter of worker’s and women’s rights, including the right to equal pay for equal work.Footnote93 He wrote to the PMG explaining his reluctance to submit the women’s petition to parliament or to press for a Select Committee, politely requesting that the office’s decision not to take her buckles be reconsidered. The petition did not progress, perhaps in part owing to Smith’s own lack of a strong backing within the Federal Parliament.Footnote94 However, Lawson was eventually compensated for the 6,000 buckles, which allowed her to pay off her house in Marrickville.Footnote95\n\nClosure\n\nThe Dawn closed in September 1905. Lawson had been struggling to continue publishing it for some time and remained in poor health. Some of the accounts of the demise of the paper note the mail bag incident that preceded it. The personal cost that accompanied her struggle as a woman inventor tends to be lost amongst other details. After the closure of The Dawn, the biographical gaze has turned to the private sphere, focusing on the turmoil that dominated the last decade of Lawson’s family life, and the declining physical and mental health that led to her admission at Callan Park Hospital.Footnote96 But Lawson was only 48 years old when she invented the fastener, 54 years old when the litigation concluded and 72 when she died. What happened to the woman inventor has been moved over too quickly.\n\nMy grandmother, Lillian, grew up as a near neighbour to Louisa Lawson in this later period. She was only a young girl of primary school age then but remembered Lawson because of her love of Australian poetry. She recalled Lawson as dirt poor, ‘poorer than us’, she said, and ‘an angry woman, tired of life’. The financial consequences of the history of an invention were life-changing.\n\nLawson suggested that the lesson for other women to learn from her experience with the Post Office was: ‘Put no man into power who, for self interest [sic], robs the orphans and condemns a woman to a life of penury.’Footnote97 But it is clear that the problems she faced were not only the result of personal corruption of a small group of men and their naked self-interest. Lawson was a difficult character, and how she performed gender had consequences. She was also not entirely without support from cultural elites. But in the years when she was vibrant and energetic – when she actively tried to claim a space in public life and in business – her entrepreneurialism was blocked by all major institutions of the modern democratic state: unions, bureaucracy, parliament and the courts. They all failed her, but for different reasons. The union movement was divided, with conservative unions working with government to achieve higher wages for men. State bureaucracy was also being modernised to advance the working conditions of the male breadwinner, at the expense of women’s economic equality. Politicians saw the opportunity to leverage private, personal connections to feather their own economic nests, with the added attraction of ensuring that a woman like Lawson would not advance with potentially lucrative government contracts with the PMG. They assumed her patent could be ignored. And the equity court disadvantaged the woman litigant who relied on a good faith undertaking in circumstances where the times and her gender meant a formal contract was practically unachievable. It is not clear that there is a lot she could have done differently that would have led to a different outcome. Her inability to secure male patronage in the right places at the right time cost her dearly. All she could do was document her motivations as a suffragist, her political strategy and the story of her struggle. She believed had she been treated fairly by the PMG, she would have done well, but although women had achieved the right to vote, economic equality was not on offer to the woman inventor.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nWith thanks to Justice Mark Leeming, Professor Michael Bryan (University of Melbourne), and Emeritus Professor Mark Aronson (University of New South Wales) for assistance in understanding the jurisdiction of the Master in Equity.
