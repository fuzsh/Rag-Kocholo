        "text": "A stripped down Leinster team travel to Italy, probably to add to Zebre's woes. With 13 players involved in today's match in Lansdowne Road, coach Matt O'Connor has spliced some academy players with old hands. Sam Coghlan-Murray and Tadhg Furlong get a chance on the left wing and tighthead respectively, while three other academy players are named amongst the replacements.\n\nO'Connor also welcomes back the experienced Mike McCarthy and Jordi Murphy who were released from the Irish set up, while Zane Kirchner switches from the right wing to a more controlling position at fullback. In the pack only Murphy is retained from the side that beat Connacht 8-16 .\n\nLeinster sit second on the table behind Munster and Zebre are 11th, one place above Connacht at the bottom. The sides are just past the half-way point so there is still some wriggle room and Zebre will be pleased as they supply nine players for Italy’s match against France on Sunday.\n\nThe Italians must boost their side with four permit players, who join the roster from the main Italian league, Eccellenza. One of them, Kelly Haimona from Rugby Calvisano, will start at outhalf to shape a new Kiwi half back partnership with former All Black Brendon Leonard.\n\nThe other three permit players will be ready to earn their first Pro12 caps from the bench. Hooker Giovanchelli (28) and flanker Bernini (25) come from I Cavalieri Prato, while utility back Bisegni (22) comes from one of the three Eccellenza clubs based in Rome, Lazio Rugby 1927.\n\nThere you have it. A Leinster win? There will be some shamed faces if they don’t."
