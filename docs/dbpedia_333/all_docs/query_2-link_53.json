        "text": "The game in Athlone will be the teenager’s first start in the Six Nations after making his Under 20 debut in the Junior World Cup last summer. But that wasn’t the first time the Llanelli-born youngster had donned an international shirt.\n\nHis first honours came in the green of Ireland when he represented the Ireland Under 18 side in the Home Nations Under 18 tournament in Llandovery in 2010. His parents moved from Wales to Dublin at the turn of the century and Jones spent 10 years growing up in the Irish capital.\n\nSo when he returns to his former home to play for his real home it will feel very much like home from home with both parents, Alan and Karen, and younger brother and sister supporting him from the sidelines.\n\n“The family still live in Dublin and they are all coming to watch the game along with a number of my Irish-based friends. I spent 10 years living in Ireland and it was a great honour to play for the Under 18 team,” said Jones.\n\n“But I always considered myself to be Welsh and I’ve always dreamed about playing for Wales. That was why I jumped at the chance of coming home to Wales when the Ospreys offered me a three year development contract.\n\n“Even though I was playing in the Leinster area I felt it was an offer that was too good to turn down. I’ve played in the LV= Cup for the Ospreys this season and scored a try against the Dragons in the last round, which was fantastic.\n\n“I wouldn’t have been anywhere near a Leinster jersey at this stage in my development had I stayed in Ireland and now I’m lining-up to play for Wales Under 20 as well.”\n\nThere will be a few familiar faces lining-up against him in the Irish side in Dubarry Park when Wales look to kick-off their latest Under 20 campaign by building on the 38-24 victory they secured over Mike Ruddock’s young Irish team in Italy at last summer’s Junior World Cup.\n\nJones got his first taste of Welsh honours in that competition, playing the final 10 minutes of the 92-0 hammering by the eventual winners New Zealand before scoring a try on his first start in the 56-6 triumph over the host nation. He went on to play against Fiji and then started on the wing against Ireland.\n\n“It was great to finally play for Wales and it was nice to play against so many of my former team mates and friends in the win over Ireland. There are going to be a lot of familiar faces in Athlone and the Irish tight-head prop, Peter Reilly, spent six years at Castleknock College with me,” explained Jones.\n\n“Peter is still one of my closest friends and it is great to see him doing so well in the Leinster set-up. There are also lots of other players I played with in their side.\n\n“But Friday night is all about getting Wales off to a good start in the Six Nations and trying to stake a claim to a permanent place in the side as we build towards the Junior World Cup.”\n\nJones is one of five players returning from Under 20 duty last year in a team that is led by Scarlets hooker Kirby Myhill. The Irish, who will be led by Ulster outside half Paddy Jackson, have four survivors from the last meeting.\n\n“We had a difficult time finding a training venue when we first arrived in Athlone because of the freezing conditions, but other than that things have been progressing well for us. This is the starting point for the year and everything will build from here,” said Wales Under 20 team manager Mark Taylor.\n\n“Winning is important, but developing the players in an international environment is equally critical. We won’t have George North or Harry Robinson available to us for the championship, as they are with the senior Welsh squad, and other eligible players such as Matthew Morgan and Eli Walker will only come into the reckoning for the Junior World Cup.\n\n“All the players know that this is the first step on the ladder that could take them onto the full international stage and allow them to follow in the footsteps of Liam Williams, Harry Robinson and Rhodri Jones who all played at this level last season and have been included in Warren Gatland’s squad for the senior Six Nations.”\n\nIRELAND UNDER 20\n\n15 Shane Layden (Buccaneers/Connacht)\n\n14 Barry Daly (UCD/Leinster)\n\n13 Foster Horan (Lansdowne/Leinster)\n\n12 JJ Hanrahan (UL Bohemians/Munster)\n\n11 Sam Coghlan Murray (UCD/Leinster)\n\n10 Paddy Jackson (Dungannon/Ulster, captain)\n\n9 Kieran Marmion (Corinthians/Connacht)\n\n1 Kyle McCall (Ballynahinch/Ulster)\n\n2 Niall Scannell (Dolphin/Munster)\n\n3 Peter Reilly (Lansdowne/Leinster)\n\n4 Iain Henderson (Queen’s University/Ulster)\n\n5 Daniel Qualter (Buccaneers/Connacht)\n\n6 Conor Gilsenan (UCD/Leinster)\n\n7 Aaron Conneely (Corinthians/Connacht)\n\n8 Jack Conan (Old Belvedere/Leinster)\n\nReplacements\n\n16 Des Merrey (Clontarf/Leinster)\n\n17 James Rael (Garryowen/Munster)\n\n18 Jake Cawley (Old Belvedere/Leinster)\n\n19 Tadgh Beirne (Lansdowne/Leinster)\n\n20 Jordan Coghlan (UCD/Leinster)\n\n21 Luke McGrath (UCD/Leinster)\n\n22 Cathal Marsh (Dublin University/Leinster)\n\n23 Christopher Farrell (Dungannon/Ulster)"
