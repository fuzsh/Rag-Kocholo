        "text": "In fairness Dowling has been injured alot, but on the match well Trimble is with Ireland and what do you know Ulster benefit from it.\n\nI am now stuck in the awkward position of wanting to tell you to leave your Trimble obsession at the door (particularly as you've admitted he's been very good for Ulster) and knowledge of the massive hypocrisy it would be as I made a joke about it not six hours earlier.\n\nBugger.\n\nPeat, while I agree I down Trimble alot for Ireland my point here was if Trimble wasn't with Ireland would Gilroy have got the chance and Ulster benefited. This wasn't a dig at Trimble\n\nTrue, all the provinces have benefitted from using the international window to look at their youngsters in some way.\n\nwill gilroy get a cap?\n\nIf he fulfils his potential, it would be an absolute crime if he doesn't get a few."
