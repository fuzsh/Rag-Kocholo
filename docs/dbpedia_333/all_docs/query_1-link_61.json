His research on grey corruption in Australia has been transformed into a book called Rigged: How networks of powerful mates rip off everyday Australians.\n\nCrikey is an independent Australian source for news, investigations, analysis and opinion focusing on politics, media, economics, health, international affairs, the climate, business, society and culture. We are guided by a deceptively simple, old idea: tell the truth and shame the devil."
