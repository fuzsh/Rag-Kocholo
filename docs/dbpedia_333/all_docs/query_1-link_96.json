        "text": "England Under-20s have made wholesale changes to their line-up for Friday's IRB Junior World Championship clash against Ireland.\n\nUnder-20s name new-look line-up; as you were for Ireland\n\nEngland Under-20s have made wholesale changes to their line-up for Friday's IRB Junior World Championship clash against Ireland, live on Sky Sports 2 HD. Following the 64-5 rout of Italy, England have made 10 changes - including first starts for Ben Spencer and Ben Nutley. Ryan Mills will captain the new-look side, while Tom Heathcote moves from fly-half to inside centre and Charlie Walker switches from full-back to the wing. And although England will be in confident mood following their opening-day win, Ireland produced the shock of the tournament when they beat hosts South Africa 23-19. Assistant coach Nick Walshe said: \"The Italy game was tough but we've had a few days to get ready and the boys are looking fresh. \"Ireland had a fantastic result against South Africa so full credit to them for that, but we weren't surprised by it because we know what a good side they are and they can't be underestimated.\" Ireland, unsurprisingly, will be unchanged for the clash following their historic victory.\n\nRevenge\n\nShane Buckley and Stuart Olding have been added to the bench, though. Ireland will be out for revenge after losing to England 20-9 in the Six Nations, with coach Mike Ruddock saying: \"England are the current Six Nations champions and we will have to reproduce the intensity we showed against South Africa if we are to get a result in this game. \"We have done our homework and we are now looking forward to the game.\" England Under-20s: 15 Tommy Bell (London Wasps), 14 Marland Yarde (London Irish), 13 Will Addison (Sale Sharks), 12 Ryan Mills (Gloucester) (C), 11 Charlie Walker (Harlequins), 10 Tom Heathcote (Bath), 9 Ben Spencer (Saracens), 1 Alec Hepburn (London Wasps), 2 Koree Britton (Gloucester), 3 Kyle Sinckler (Harlequins), 4 Dominic Barrow (Leeds Carnegie), 5 George Merrick (Harlequins), 6 David Sisi (London Irish), 7 Ben Nutley (Northampton Saints), 8 Jack Clifford (Harlequins)\n\nReplacements: 16 Max Crumpton (Saracens), 17 Luke Cowan-Dickie (Exeter Chiefs), 18 Ross Harrison (Sale Sharks), 19 Sam Twomey (Harlequins), 20 Chris Walker (Leeds Carnegie), 21 Dan Robson (Gloucester), 22 Sam Hill (Exeter Chiefs), 23 Ben Ransom (Saracens) Ireland Under-20s: 15 Peter Nelson (Ulster), 14 Barry Daly (Leinster), 13 Chris Farrell (Ulster), 12 Foster Horan (Leinster), 11 Sam Coghlan Murray (Leinster), 10 JJ Hanrahan (Munster), 9 Kieran Marmion (Connacht), 1 Des Merrey (Leinster), 2 Niall Scannell (Munster) (capt), 3 Tadhg Furlong (Leinster), 4 Tadhg Beirne (Leinster), 5 Iain Henderson (Ulster), 6 Jordan Coghlan (Leinster), 7 Conor Gilsenan (Mullingar/Leinster), 8 Jack Conan (Leinster)\n\nReplacements: 16 James Rael (Munster), 17 Peter Reilly (Leinster), 18 Jake Cawley (Leinster), 19 Alan O'Connor (Leinster), 20 Shane Buckley (Munster), 21 Luke McGrath (Leinster), 22 Jack Carty (Connacht), 23 Stuart Olding (Ulster)"
