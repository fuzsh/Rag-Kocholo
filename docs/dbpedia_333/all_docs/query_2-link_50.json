        "text": "Most teams have completed their signings for next season. There could be a change of guard in Wales with Cardiff and Dragons doing better business than Scarlets/Ospreys. The Knoyle/Anscombe partnership will be an interesting one for Cardiff but wouldn't be surprised if they use Anscombe at FB. Dragons have a lot more (aging) bulk up front and we won't be pushing their scrum around Rodney Parade like we did last season. Its a bit surprising that Glasgow haven't recruited better to compensate for losing Cusiter and Jackson. Predicitons are that it will be January before the new Treviso players will get to know eachothers names. They will be definitely be playing second fiddle to Zebre who if anything are a little stronger. Not a lot of change in Leinster or Munster. Ulster seems to have recruited well after their significant departures.\n\nA big shout out for Flanker Jamie Ritchie who signed a SENIOR contract with Edinburgh AGE 17 .\n\nLet the games begin.\n\nAdam jones has joined cardiff blues on a 1 yr deal. Its causing quite a stir in wales with ospreys releasing whats being described in wales as a negative statement. They didnt thank him for his service thats for sure. They didnt treat him very well lately so only have themselves to blame. He has had to train on his own preseason as the ospreys offer was conditional on an agreement being signed with wru. Meanwhile warburton has enjoyed a full preseason with blues even though hes centrally contracted and they wont play him until wru agreement is reached. Lesson in employer-employee relations there.\n\nThanks for the run down Galway_gas, I was looking for just such a list the other day when it was mentioned in another thread that the Dragons looked much improved in their preseason game against Bristol. My suspicion was they were hurt much less than the other Welsh regions by the player exodus since they had few marquee internationals to lose. They certainly have brought in more household names than lost. I guess the question will be how well some of these older players hold up for them over the course of the season.\n\nAs a Connacht fan I don't look at this list and see any teams necessarily widening the talent gap on them, but on the other hand this also concerns me because of what it might say about the Pro 12's prospects in European competitions.\n\nLeigh halfpenny cud be on his way home as his agent has flown to toulon for crunch contract talks with boujedal after the toulon owner accused 1/2p of dishonesty and failure to disclose a groin injury before signing for toulon. He has further threatened to terminate the contract if hes not available to play next weekend. 1/2p isnt impressed by his treatmrnt in general there and this is final straw. Hr allegrdly wants out and his preference is a dual contract with wru and one of regions.\n\nHaving read the full article he is not insisting 1/2p play this weekend as i said above but is saying that his being injured is unnacceptable and threatening to terminate contract on grounds of nondisclosure.\n\nIn addition he is threatening not to pay the wages of his players competing in rugby championship and demanding that they return to toulon immediately to help the team. He also challenges the irb to take him on on this matter. He believes that french employment law will win out in a french court over a sporting organisations rules."
