        "text": "Irish Thoracic Society Annual Scientific Meeting\n\n19 November 2021\n\nOutline Programme\n\nIRISH THORACIC SOCIETY POSTER REVIEW AND DISCUSSION\n\n1. ILD\n\n1.1 An Evaluation of 116 patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) commenced on anti-fibrotic treatment therapies (Pirfenidone and Nintedanib) from Jan 2019 to June 2021\n\nBowen BR and Henry MT\n\nInterstitial Lung Disease Service, Cork University Hospital, Cork\n\nThere are two approved anti- fibrotic treatments for IPF, pirfenidone (P) and nintedanib (N) but some patients need to stop or switch medications due to side effects. In large studies, both treatments slow the progression of IPF by 50 per cent based on lung function measurement.\n\nThe aim of this study was to evaluate the medication treatments and side effects on our cohort of patients with IPF over a two and a half year period. Consecutive patients with mild/moderate IPF (FEV1 > 50% predicted, DLCO > 35% predicted) prescribed pirfenidone or nintedanib at the ILD clinic in Cork University Hospital were analysed.116 patients commenced on either treatment from January 2019 to June 2021 were assessed.\n\nWith education, awareness and a patient centred approach, potential dose adjustment, monitoring and symptom management is crucial to maintain adherence to the therapies.\n\n1.2 RB-ILD: More common than we thought?\n\nConor Cruickshank1, Michaela Donaghy2, Eoin Murtagh3, Paul Minnis3\n\nInterstitial Lung Disease Service, Antrim Area Hospital, Bush Road\n\nRespiratory bronchiolitis-associated interstitial lung disease (RB-ILD) is a rare, inflammatory pulmonary disorder that occurs almost exclusively in current or former heavy smokers. A previous epidemiological study has reported the incidence of 0.04 per 100,000.1 The natural history is unknown, specifically whether interventions result in radiological or clinical improvement and what the long-term sequelae may be of this condition.\n\nWe reviewed all patients attending ILD clinic (712) over the last 18 months and identified 23 (3.2%) with RB-ILD satisfying clinic-radiological descriptors in addition to pathology where available. The crude incidence was estimated at 4.86 per 100,000. The average age at presentation was 56.1 years (35–77) having accrued 40.2 pack years and demonstrated a slight female predominance (12/23). All but one patient reported gradual onset of exertional dyspnoea, symptomatic wheeze and or persistent cough. In all cases high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) described centrilobular micronodules, ground-glass opacities, and peribronchiolar thickening. Additional emphysema was seen in 6/23. 11 patients underwent bronchoscopy for confirmatory pathology.\n\n21 patients had serial data and were followed up for a median of 38.7 months (IQR 14.2–58.3). During this time 7 stop smoking, 6 reduced consumption and the rest continued actively smoking. Radiological improvement was seen in 2 patients both of which had stopped smoking. Adjusted DLCO percentage change was calculated for a 24-month period with patients characterised into “active”, “reduced” and “stopped” tobacco use cohorts (Fig. 1). There was a small signal in terms of the relationship of ESR with DLCO when adjusted for co-existent emphysema.\n\nA higher incidence than expected within the Northern Trust was identified. Active tobacco use was associated, not surprisingly to a greater percentage decline in DLCO over 24 months. Ongoing follow up of this cohort will be useful in identifying possible long-term sequelae particularly in terms of relationship to other interstitial pneumonias.\n\nReference\n\nKarakatsani A, Papakosta D, Rapti A, Antoniou KM, Dimadi M, Markopoulou A, Latsi P, Polychronopoulos V, Birba G, Ch L, Bouros D (2009) Epidemiology of interstitial lung diseases in Greece. Respir Med 103:1122–9\n\n1.3 Type II alveolar epithelial cell dysfunction associates with altered iron levels after bleomycin treatment\n\nZiling Huang2,3, Sarah Kenny1*, Suzanne M. Cloonan1,2\n\n1 School of Medicine, Trinity Biomedical Sciences Institute, Trinity College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland\n\n2Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Joan and Sanford I. Weill Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, New York 10,021, USA\n\n3 Department of Pathology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200,065, China\n\n*presenter\n\nIdiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is a form of interstitial lung disease (ILD), which is characterized by progressive dyspnea and a decline in lung function. The exact cause of IPF is unknown, however, a prevailing theory is that recurrent microinjuries to alveolar type II (AEC2) cells results in an altered dysfunctional phenotype, which drives the pathogenesis of the disease. In conjunction with this, iron has also been suggested to play a role in the development of IPF, with recent studies showing alterations of iron levels in the lungs of individuals with IPF. This study aimed to investigate whether iron is altered in in vivo and in vitro experimental models of IPF. Here, we show that iron levels decline in AEC2 cells isolated from experimental IPF models. These reduced intracellular iron levels were associated with AEC2 cell dysfunction and altered expression levels of cell senescence markers. Furthermore, restoration of iron in AEC2 cells was also shown to prevent bleomycin-induced mortality and injury in vivo. These findings highlight the potential role iron dyshomeostasis plays in driving disease pathogenesis and presents the manipulation of iron levels through iron supplementation as an interesting potential therapeutic target.\n\n1.4 Mode of Presentation, Diagnosis and Prevalence of Lymphangioleiomyomatosis in an Irish population\n\nEvelyn Lynn1, Marissa O’Callaghan1, Lindsay Browne1, Michael P. Keane1,2, Cormac McCarthyy1,2\n\n1 Department of Respiratory Medicine, St. Vincent’s University Hospital, Elm Park, Dublin 4, Ireland\n\n2 School of Medicine, University College Dublin, Dublin 4, Ireland\n\n1.5 Computed Tomography morphometric analysis of patients with Idiopathic Inflammatory Myopathy related Interstitial Lung Disease correlates with Forced Vital Capacity\n\nO’Mahony A1, Henry P3, Coughlan P2, Crowley C1, Ryan D1, Moore N1, O’Connor OJ1, Maher M1, Henry MT2\n\n1 Academic Department of Radiology, Cork University Hospital / University College Cork\n\n2 Department of Respiratory Medicine, Cork University Hospital / University College Cork\n\n3 School of Medicine, University College Cork\n\nSarcopenia is a prognostic indicator in COPD and IPF. Identification of sarcopenic patients may enable intervention to improve prognosis. Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is the most common non-musculoskeletal manifestation of patients with Idiopathic Inflammatory Myopathies (IIMs). This study investigated muscle mass in IIM, and its relationship to ILD disease severity.\n\nIIM patients with ILD attending Cork University Hospital were identified. Morphomic analysis of muscle mass on CT thorax was performed using CoreSlicer, a web-based tool which enables semi-automated segmentation of muscle and fat. Bilateral Erector Spinae Muscle (ESM) and Pectoralis Muscle (PM) cross-sectional areas (CSA) were calculated. All morphomic data were correlated with lung function including forced vital capacity (FVC).\n\nData from 31 patients (16 male, mean age 69.8 years) were analysed. No relationship was established between change in morphomics between diagnostic (first) and second CT scans and change in PFTs over the same interval.\n\nThere were significant correlations between baseline and follow-up PM CSA, ESM CSA and FVC (p = 0.002 r = 0.384, p = 0.013, r = 0.318 respectively) when treated as separate data points. A negative relationship between the patients’ albumin levels and their visceral fat at T12 was also found (p = 0.022, r = 0.0215).\n\nESM CSA and PM CSA may be an important parameter in patients with IIM related ILD due to their significant correlations with FVC.\n\n1.6 Hypercalcaemia in patients with sarcoidosis in the South of Ireland\n\nJL O’Sullivan, HI Ibrahim, LJ Walsh, TM O’Connor\n\nDepartment of Respiratory Medicine, Mercy University Hospital, Cork, Ireland\n\nSarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous disorder whose prevalence is high in the South of Ireland. Hypercalcaemia has been reported in 10–20% of patients with sarcoidosis at presentation. Increased intestinal calcium absorption induced by high serum calcitriol concentrations is the primary cause and heavy exposure to sunlight is a common precipitant. We sought to determine the prevalence of hypercalcemia in our patients with sarcoidosis.\n\nWe reviewed the data of 317 patients with a tissue-proven diagnosis of sarcoidosis who attended Mercy University Hospital, Cork, Ireland from 2005–2021.\n\nMedian age was 53y (20-94y), serum calcium was 2.41 mmol/L (1.92–3.1 mmol/L) and serum ACE was 56 IU/L (5–249 IU/L). Hypercalcaemia was present in 6.8% of patients (18/263) at the time of diagnosis, moderate hypercalcaemia (> 3 mmol/L) was present in 0.8% of patients (2/263). Higher serum calcium was associated with younger age (p = 0.0229), but no correlations with stage of sarcoidosis, serum ACE, lymphocyte count or vitamin D were seen. There were no differences in serum calcium according to month of diagnosis using non-parametric analysis of variance (p = 0.2836).\n\nDespite a high background prevalence of sarcoidosis in the South of Ireland, the prevalence of hypercalcaemia at the time of diagnosis was lower than internationally reported. Moderate or clinically significant hypercalcaemia was rare and seasonal variation had no influence on the level of serum calcium. The temperate climate in our region may explain the lack of seasonal variation in serum calcium in patients with sarcoidosis.\n\n1.7 A single center audit of access to healthcare and disease monitoring in patients diagnosed with Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis\n\nLiam Carey1,2, Siadbh Comerford1, Helen Mulryan1,2, Sinead Walsh1,2, Anthony O Regan1,2,3\n\n1 University Hospital Galway\n\n2 National University of Ireland Galway\n\n3 Royal College of Physicians Ireland\n\nIdiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating condition that carries a prognosis worse than that of many cancers1. The aim of this audit was to quantify reduced access to healthcare in IPF during the COIVD pandemic. This was a single center review of the care patients with IPF received in the year 2020 in comparison to the year prior 2019.\n\nThere was no significant difference in the average planned interval follow up between 2019 and 2020 (P = 0.316). The actual interval follow up was on average 4 months longer in 2020 than in the year preceding (P = 0.007). Patients were on average seen once less per year (P = 0.003). When seen in 2020, they were more likely to be seen virtually (P < 0.001). In 2020, patients were less likely to receive pulmonary function tests (P = 0.001) and 6 min walks tests (P = 0.042) than in 2019. On average, patients received less serum aminotransferase monitoring in 2020 with 2.8 (CI 1.693, 3.886) being performed in comparison to 4.4 (CI 2.5, 6.3) (P = 0.48).\n\nIn conclusion, structured timely follow up is essential for IPF. We have demonstrated the effect of COVID 19 on these pathways. The effect on disease outcome will require monitoring going forward.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

European Resp J 30:835–839\n\n1.8 Survey of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) patients who participated in online group exercise classes to facilitate physical activity during Covid-19 pandemic\n\nGordon Cagney1, Niamh Julian1, Paula Ryan2, Aidan O’Brien2, Brian Casserly2, Gemma O’Dowd3, Nicola Cassidy3, Danny Sheahan4\n\n1 HSE, Department of Physiotherapy, University Hospital Limerick (UHL)\n\n2 HSE, Department of Respiratory Medicine, University Hospital Limerick (UHL)\n\n3 Irish Lung Fibrosis Association (ILFA), Dublin\n\n4 Invisio Ltd, Co Wicklow\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic respiratory patients were cocooning at home with limited access to group exercise classes. In particular, IPF patients are fearful of undertaking exercise independently. To prevent deconditioning of this cohort, virtually run exercise classes were organised as part of a collaboration between UHL and ILFA.\n\nThe physiotherapist-led weekly exercise classes commenced in May 2020. Participants were invited to complete an online survey in May 2021 to assess the impact of the virtual classes and attitudes towards physical activity.\n\n53 participants responded to the survey, 83% were aged 61 + . All respondents were diagnosed with IPF, 6% being post-transplant recipients and 36% using oxygen all the time or most of the time. Only 11% of the respondents were on a public waiting list for either face-to-face or virtual pulmonary rehabilitation. A rating of ‘excellent’ was awarded by 73% of respondents for help in overcoming any anxiety about exercising online. Of the respondents, 64% reported being more active and 68% reported being less fearful about doing exercise since starting the online classes. See Table .\n\nOverall online exercise classes have provided substantial physical and emotional benefits to IPF patients. The survey highlights the lack of pulmonary rehab availability to IPF patients.\n\n1.9 The Irish Lung Fibrosis Association’s Multi-Stakeholder World Café on Pulmonary Fibrosis Services in Ireland During Covid-19 and Beyond\n\n1Nicola Cassidy, 2Eoin Judge, 1Gemma O’Dowd, 3Tony Shone, 4Anne-Marie Russell\n\n1 Irish Lung Fibrosis Association\n\n2 Connolly Hospital, Dublin\n\n3 Invisio Ltd. Wicklow\n\n4 University of Exeter, Exeter, United Kingdom\n\nThe Irish Lung Fibrosis Association (ILFA) hosted a virtual World Café forum to identify key stakeholders’ experiences of healthcare services for pulmonary fibrosis during COVID-19 and priorities for future care. Eight groups of mixed patients, caregivers, healthcare professionals and industry partners discussed (1) Diagnostics, (2) Healthcare Supports, (3) Psychological Support, (4) Integrated Care. Rotating group discussions were facilitated and recorded by the eight leaders. The forum was anonymously evaluated.\n\nSeventy-two people participated. Discussions revealed most patients experience significant delays in diagnosis; paucity of access to dietetic advice, palliative care, social support, and psychological services for patients and caregivers, and lack of integrated care across hospital and community-based services. The lack of education and emotional support at diagnosis causes distress for patients and families. Post COVID-19, a blend of face-to-face and virtual care, considering patient preference, could improve future healthcare access. Fifty-three participants (74%) completed the post-event survey. 96% agreed/strongly agreed that the World Cafe was helpful and 92% agreed/strongly agreed that they were able to get their views across during the event.\n\nThe findings of the World Café indicate that a National Clinical Programme for pulmonary fibrosis is required to improve diagnosis and ensure equity of access for healthcare supports.\n\n1.10 Lung fibrosis patients identify deficiencies in vital healthcare support services\n\nCassidy N1, Fox L1,2, Brown L1,3, Galvin L1, Gemma O’Dowd1, Danny Sheahan4, O’Reilly KMA1,2,5\n\n1 The Irish Lung Fibrosis Association, Dublin, Ireland\n\n2 Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, Dublin, Ireland\n\n3 St Vincent’s University Hospital, Dublin, Ireland\n\n4 Invisio Ltd. Wicklow, Ireland\n\n5 School of Medicine, University College Dublin, Ireland\n\nThe Irish Lung Fibrosis Association (ILFA) conducted an online survey from 19 July-02 August 2021 to determine the healthcare support needs and experiences of lung fibrosis patients.\n\nNinety-nine lung fibrosis and 13 post-transplant patients responded (53% male). 58% had a clinical nurse specialist (92% transplant recipients). 38% had been referred to a physiotherapist-led pulmonary rehabilitation programme, 25% to a dietitian and other services included social worker (9%), occupational therapist (8%), palliative care (6%), clinical psychologist (6%) and speech therapist (3%). Forty-five percent of patients had not been referred to any service. Post-transplant patients were more likely to be referred to a dietitian (69%), social worker (31%) and clinical psychologist (38%). For all services, most referrals happened more than 12-months after diagnosis. Patients’ felt they would have benefitted from referral to the following specialties at the time of diagnosis- physiotherapist-led pulmonary rehabilitation programme (65%), dietitian (51%), clinical psychologist (45%). Specialties of benefit to patients currently are physiotherapy (53%), clinical psychology (48%) and dietetics (47%). The following are seen as future needs -physiotherapy (85%), clinical psychology (67%), dietetics (67%), palliative care (65%) and occupational therapy (56%). This suggests that essential support services are lacking for lung fibrosis patients.\n\n1.11 SCLERODERMA-RELATED ILD REVIEW\n\nDr Dominic Doyle, Dr Michael Henry\n\nCork University Hospital\n\nCUH (Cork University Hospital) is a tertiary referral centre with a joint Respiratory/Rheumatology outpatient service. We have a large cohort of ILD (Interstitial Lung Disease) patients, and wanted to examine treatment outcomes in our scleroderma subset. Scleroderma is a prime cause of CTD-ILD (Connective Tissue Disease-associated ILD). Furthermore, ILD is the main cause of death in scleroderma.\n\nWe used our electronic health record to collect data on 10 randomly selected patients with scleroderma-related ILD. Data collected were: Age, Sex, Pre-treatment PFTs, Medication, Post-treatment PFTs (generally at 1 year), CT changes and Co-morbidities.\n\nThe mean age was 56. 6 out of 10 patients were female. 5 patients had documented Raynaud’s phenomenon, 2 had pulmonary hypertension and 2 had gastro-oesophageal reflux. The mean pre-treatment FVC was 88% and DLCO was 69%. 5 patients were on treatment with CellCept, 2 with Rituximab, 2 with Nintedanib and 1 with Myfortic. 9 patients had stable post-treatment PFTs apart from 1 patient treated with Nintedanib who had a 30% drop in DLCO over 12 months. The mean post-treatment FVC was 90% and DLCO was 62%. 6 patients had stable CT appearances and 1 had minimal progression.\n\nThere are no conflicts of interest.\n\n1.12 A Decade of Sarcoidosis in the Midwest\n\nN. Logan, P. O’Regan, E. McMonagle, L. Casserly, A. O’Brien\n\nUniversity Hospital Limerick, Limerick, Ireland\n\nThe aim of this study was to assess the demographics, initial presentation, clinical course (including extra-pulmonary organ involvement) and outcomes of sarcoid patients in the Midwest over a 10 year period. Retrospective data analysis was performed on patients with either a clinical or histopathological diagnosis of sarcoid from a hospital database in University Hospital Limerick. Data collected on 213 patients revealed; 56% were male with a mean age 52 (range 24–91). On current available data, 165 were born in Ireland, 8 in the United Kingdom, 7 in Poland, 2 in Pakistan and 2 in Africa. Of note, a significant cohort of patients had their initial presentation with a service other than respiratory medicine, with only 30% initially presenting to the Department of Respiratory Medicine and 5% initially presenting to the surgical service with cervical and axillary lymphadenopathy and subsequent biopsy confirming sarcoidosis. Sarcoidosis is a disease with significant geographical and racial heterogeneity. We hope that our data from the Midwest will add to the available literature characterising this complex multi-organ disease.\n\n1.13 Compliance with ATS/ERS guidelines for lung fibrosis reporting in CT thorax in University Hospital Kerry, and demographic distribution of pulmonary fibrosis in Kerry Group\n\nA.Nabri, M.I.Khan, U.Khan, H.Arshad\n\nRespiratory Department, University Hospital Kerry\n\nIntroduction: Audit is aimed to assess reporting practices of CT thorax in lung fibrosis based on ATS/ERS guidelines in University-Hospital-Kerry.\n\nMethod: Retrospective data collected from 01/11/2020 to 28/04/2021.Total 281 CT Thorax reports were surveyed. Total number of CT Thorax which reported fibrosis was 60.CT thorax reporting of lung fibrosis should be done according to one of one the following four categories.\n\nUIP\n\nProbable UIP\n\nIndeterminate for UIP\n\nAlternative diagnosis.\n\nResults: Most of time fibrosis was reported as ‘fibrotic changes’ & ‘fibrotic scarring’ and none were reported as per ATS/ERS guidelines.\n\nDemographic distribution as below:\n\nDiscussion/ Conclusion: Lung fibrosis on CT thorax should be reported as per ATS/ERS guidelines as UIP pattern, probable UIP pattern, indeterminate for UIP pattern, and alternative diagnosis. This would consequently help with further management options.\n\n85% patients with pulmonary fibrosis were above 60 years of age.\n\nRecommendations: Guidelines recommendation sent to local radiology group. Re audit is planned after 6 months with second cycle to look for improvement and presentation of ATS/ERS guidelines regarding reporting pulmonary fibrosis.\n\nReferences\n\nRaghu G, Remy-Jardin M, Myers JL, Richeldi L, Ryerson CJ, Lederer DJ et al (2018) Diagnosis of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis.

We compared explanted histopathology of 14 patients with ILD with their pre-referral diagnosis to determine diagnostic accuracy of our referral pathway.\n\nA list of all patients with an ILD diagnosis referred for lung transplant from SVUH between 2010–2020 was obtained from a clinical database. Pre-transplant referral diagnosis was determined by clinical assessment, radiological imaging, lung biopsy and/or MDT discussion. Histopathological assessment of explanted tissue was performed with pathologist blinded to the pre-referral diagnosis.\n\nIn 71% (n = 10) of cases pre-transplant diagnosis fully correlated with explant histology. 14% (n = 2) of cases partially correlated and 14% (n = 2) did not correlate with any pre-referral findings, with only one of these four discussed at MDT. 86% correlation was seen in cases discussed at MDT, with biopsy facilitating pre-transplant diagnosis in difficult cases.\n\nThe relatively high number of cases (almost 30%) that did not fully correlate with explant histopathology and improved figures seen with MDT discussion supports this pathway to enhance pre-transplant diagnostic accuracy. The possibility of progression of ILD phenotype over time encourages continued MDT discussion of cases awaiting transplant.\n\n1.15 The impact of virtual pulmonary rehabilitation programme on physical activity on people with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: a feasibility study\n\nOrlagh O’Shea1, Grainne Murphy2, Luke Forde3, Grainne Casey2, Lynn Fox4, Katherine M.A. O’Reilly4\n\nSchool of Physiotherapy, Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, Dublin\n\nDepartment of Physiotherapy, Mater Misericordiae Hospital, Dublin\n\nWexford General Hospital, Wexford, Dublin\n\nDepartment of Respiratory Medicine, Mater Misericordiae Hospital, Dublin\n\nLower levels of physical activity (PA) are associated with increased mortality in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) (Nishiyama et al. 2018). The aim of this study was to explore the impact the impact of a virtual pulmonary rehabilitation (VPR) programme on PA levels in people with IPF.\n\nPatients referred to an interstitial lung disease specific PR programme were screened for eligibility. Baseline (BL) and post intervention (PI) outcome measures were collected: PA (Actigraph GT3x +), exercise capacity (either 6 min walk test (6MWT) or 1-min sit to stand (STS)) and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) (Kings Brief Interstitial Lung Disease (K-BILD)). The K-BILD total score ranges from 0–100, with 100 representing the best possible health.\n\nTo date 37 patients were invited to participate and 13 participants were recruited, results are available for 11 participants.

We looked at their baseline demographics, pre admission therapy, as well as the cause of exacerbation and the mortality rate.\n\n10 patients were identified who were admitted during this period. Seven (70%) were male with a mean age of 72. (Standard deviation).Nine patients (90%) were treated with antibiotics during their admission while only two (20%) of these had a confirmed isolated pathogen. There was a 30% all -cause mortality rate in the group study net, with one of these having tested positive for COVID -19 prior to their death.\n\nThe audit demonstrates a similarly high mortality rate for patients requiring admission to hospital with an exacerbation of ILD.\n\n1.17 Investigating mucosal associated invariant T (MAIT) cells in lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM)\n\nSiobhán Boyle1, Andrew Hogan2, Amina Jouida3, Michael P.

Cork University Hospital Cork\n\n2. St Vincent's University Hospital Elm Park Dublin 4\n\nIdiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic fibrosing interstitial lung disease of unknown aetiology that may results from several sources of alveolar injury in genetically predisposed individuals. In the majority of cases, IPF is diagnosed by high resolution computed tomography, where the classic pattern of usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP), and those with probable UIP. Indeterminate cases of UIP may progress to a form sur lung biopsy. The median survival is 3 to 5 years from diagnosis. The hallmark histopathological feature is the fibroblastic foci (FF), which represents active fibroproliferation.\n\nMicro-CT allows non-destructive imaging of tissue 3D microarchitecture, down to spatial resolutions, in the order of 1 to 10 μm. We performed micro-CT analysis of acquired cryoprobe assisted transbronchial biopsies of patients with IPF pre and post treatment with pirfenidone. The interval time between biopsies was 6 months. Initial work correlated micro-CT of whole paraffin-embedded samples of UIP tissue with the histological sections. We aim to quantify the level of fibrosis and morphology of the FF present in the biopsies, pre and post treatment.\n\n1.19 A review of antifibrotic drug therapy in patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) in St James’s Hospital\n\nR. Kennedy1, L Dolan1, C Gray1, K Devenney1, P Nadarajan1\n\n1 Respiratory Assessment Unit, St James’s Hospital, Dublin 8\n\nIdiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, progressive fibrosing lung disease with high mortality1. Two antifibrotic (AF) drugs Pirfenidone and Nintedanib have been licenced in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) for use in Ireland since 2015, with the aim of slowing disease progression. However, they are associated with side-effects which can affect quality of life and result in discontinuation.\n\nWe performed a retrospective analysis of all patients with IPF commenced on antifibrotics our centre between 2017 and 2019, to determine reasons for treatment discontinuation and most common side effects.\n\nTwenty-eight patients (mean age 73 years 39.2% female) were included with 43% (n = 12) commenced on Nintedanib and 57% (n = 16) commenced on Pirfenidone. During this 2-year period, 25% (n = 7) had treatment stopped (2 diarrhoea, 2 nausea & vomiting, 1 skin reaction 1 died), 21.4% (n = 6) had their treatment switched and 53.6% (n = 15) did not require a change to treatment. 66% (n = 4) of those patients that required a switch of their treatment reported nausea and vomiting.\n\nSide effects are common with antifibrotic treatment, further research will ascertain whether nursing interventions may reduce this rate.\n\n1Raghu G, Rochwerg B, Zhang Y, Garcia CA, Azuma A, Behr J, et al.; American Thoracic Society; European Respiratory society; Japanese Respiratory Society; Latin American Thoracic Association.

The most common manifestation is Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). (1) There are no international guidelines guiding PCP prophylaxis in patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD) requiring immunosuppressive therapy. However, prophylaxis is widely recommended in clinical practice.\n\nThe audit was a single-centre study looking at patients attending the specialist ILD clinic who were prescribed immunosuppressive therapy. Anonymous data was collected via the electronic healthcare record. Our data collection tool was pre-defined in conjunction with the rheumatology service.\n\n19 patients were included. 8 patients had connective tissue disease-associated ILD (42%). 11 patients were prescribed dual immunosuppressive agents and five patients were prescribed triple therapy. 84% of patients were prescribed prednisolone (n = 16). 3 of the 19 patients were prescribed PCP prophylaxis (15.7%) and in all cases, co-trimoxazole was the drug of choice. The dose given varied across all three patients.\n\nPCP prophylaxis prescribing was exceptionally low. In the absence of international guidance, we created a simple prescribing flowsheet for PCP prophylaxis. This will help guide physicians which patients should be considered for PCP prophylaxis and the appropriate doses. We will follow up with a re-audit of our practice.\n\n2. Miscellaneous\n\n2.1 Accessory Muscles Support Respiratory System Performance in Young Dystrophin-Deficient mdx Mice\n\nAoife D. Slyne1, Ken D. O’Halloran1 & David P. Burns1\n\n1 Department of Physiology, School of Medicine, College of Medicine and Health, University College Cork, Cork\n\nRespiratory impairment is a feature of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), a genetic neuromuscular disorder. Peak inspiratory pressure-generating capacity is preserved in young dystrophin-deficient mdx mice, despite diaphragm muscle weakness and reduced electromyogram (EMG) activitya. We hypothesise that accessory muscle compensation limits ventilatory deficit in early dystrophic disease.\n\nFour-month-old male wild-type (n = 30) and mdx (n = 29) mice were studied. In urethane (1.7 g/kg i.p.) anaesthetised mice, diaphragm and scalene EMG activities were recorded during baseline and sustained tracheal occlusion producing maximal respiratory muscle activation. Diaphragm and scalene muscle function were examined ex vivo. Data (mean ± SD) were statistically compared using two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-hoc test.\n\nPeak diaphragm EMG activity in mdx mice was reduced compared with wild-type (25.8 ± 13.8 vs. 15.7 ± 7.4 mV.s; P = 0.0009). Moreover, mdx diaphragm force was considerably lower (significant force loss at 25-150 Hz). In comparison, peak scalene EMG activity was equivalent in wild-type and mdx mice (1.74 ± 1.45 vs. 1.48 ± 0.58 mV.s; P = 0.5767). Scalene muscle force-generating capacity was preserved in mdx mice.\n\nThe early decline in diaphragm performance (decreased activation and intrinsic weakness), suggests that compensation provided by accessory muscles is critical to the support of respiratory performance in mdx mice, which may have relevance to DMD.\n\nReferences\n\naBurns DP, Murphy KH, Lucking EF, O'Halloran KD.

The average length of stay of COPD patients was reduced by 2.16 days and discharges were accelerated. A permanent Specialist Physiotherapist was appointed in 2021 to progress the role.\n\nThe physiotherapist screened patients on admission and accelerated discharges. Data was collected for patients reviewed from 2019 to August 2021. Condition, length of stay, and discharge destination were recorded. Data was anonymised, stored on a password protected excel document, and analysed. Referral pathways to Peamount Healthcare Respiratory Unit (PHRU) and outpatient services were improved.\n\n1287 patients were reviewed in 2019 and 2020 (n = 554, n = 733), compared with 398 in 2021. 852 discharges were accelerated in 2019 and 2020 (n = 356, n = 496), with 217 in 2021. Transfers to PHRU increased from 102 in 2019, to 135 in 2020, and 108 up to August 2021. Patients spent 1779 bed days in PHRU in 2020, equating to a cost saving of €907,290 for TUH. In 2021, PHRU transfers have saved 1837 acute bed days; a cost saving of €936,870.\n\nThe Specialist Physiotherapist in Respiratory Pathways is extremely cost effective, with over €2,502,060 saved in acute bed days for TUH since 2019.\n\n2.3 The Quantitative Measurement of Active Neutrophil Elastase in Sputum using a Point of Care Test and Reader Device\n\nDarragh McCafferty1, Sarah Johnston1, Shasidran Raj2, Gennady Lubarsky2 and James McLaughlin2\n\n1 ProAxsis Ltd, Catalyst, Belfast, Northern Ireland\n\n2 Northern Ireland Connected Health Innovation Centre (CHIC), NIBEC building, Ulster University, Newtownabbey, Northern Ireland\n\nSputum neutrophil elastase (NE) is a biomarker of disease severity in respiratory disorders; with point of care measurement being of interest to assist in patient triaging. NEATstik® is a lateral flow test for the qualitative detection of sputum NE; however, the need for a quantitative device has been highlighted. This study aims to improve the quantitative potential of NEATstik® using a CMOS reader.\n\nNE calibrants and sputum samples (n = 19) were prepared in NEATstik dilution buffer. Sputum samples were initially diluted × 10, then serially diluted. NE calibrants and samples were transferred (70 µl) to a NEATstik device; with a CMOS reader used to measure signal intensity. Sputum sol was analysed on ProAxsis’ NE Activity based Immunoassay.\n\nCMOS readings revealed a matrix effect, with statistical analysis (Kruskal–Wallis; Dunn’s Multiple Comparison Test) indicating that a further × 8 dilution is necessary for the quantitative measurement of active NE, in sputum, with NEATstik. Moreover, a significant correlation (spearman r value = 0.86) was observed between NE levels when measured on both platforms.\n\nImproved accuracy in the quantitative determination of sputum NE may assist in the identification of key disease thresholds, enabling pre-emptive medical intervention, thereby improving the standard of care received by patients with respiratory disease.\n\nConflict of Interest: the presenting author is an employee of ProAxsis Ltd.\n\n2.4 Characteristics of Sarcoid Associated Pulmonary Hypertension in Ireland\n\nMargaret Higgins1, Sarah Cullivan1, Brian McCullagh1, Sean Gaine1\n\n1 National Pulmonary Hypertension Unit, Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, Dublin, Ireland\n\nSarcoidosis is a multisystemic disease of uncertain aetiology, that can affect the pulmonary circulation and right heart. Sarcoid associated pulmonary hypertension (SAPH) is an important and under-recognised complication of sarcoidosis, which carries significant morbidity and mortality. This is the first study describing the characteristics of SAPH in the National Pulmonary Hypertension Unit (NPHU) in Ireland.\n\nThis retrospective single centre study identified cases of SAPH, confirmed by right heart catheterisation, diagnosed between 2010 and 2020. Nineteen cases of SAPH were identified in this period and baseline characteristics are highlighted in Table .\n\nThe nature of SAPH was multifactorial and included a sarcoid related pulmonary arterial vasculopathy, left heart disease, hypoxic lung disease due to interstitial lung disease and extrinsic pulmonary artery (PA) compression due to progressive massive fibrosis. At SAPH diagnosis, 13 (68%) patients were prescribed sarcoid directed therapy. Pulmonary hypertension specific therapy was prescribed in 14 cases (74%) and comprised of monotherapy in 10 (53%) and double combination therapy in 2 (21%) cases. One patient required PA stent insertion for extrinsic compression and 1 patient underwent double lung transplantation.\n\nThis study described the phenotypes of SAPH in the NPHU and characterises the clinical and treatment characteristics of this cohort.\n\nTable\n\n2.5 Initial experience of Virtual Pulmonary Rehabilitation in a District General Hospital\n\nR Mc Garrigle1, B Leonard1, D Clifford1, T Mc Kelvey2, S Mc Namee2, A Henderson3, R Griffith3, J O’Callaghan1, T Mc Guigan1, RA Sharkey1\n\n1. Department of Respiratory Medicine, Western Trust, N Ireland\n\n2. IT Department, Western Trust, N Ireland\n\n3. Physiotherapy Department, Western Trust, N Ireland\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted the delivery of the face to face pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) programme in the Western Trust. As a result, a virtual PR programme was introduced in order to meet the needs of the service users\n\nWith the support of the Trust IT department, educational videos featuring the current PR team were recorded and made available to participants on the Trust You-tube site. During the interactive section of the 6 week programme, the participants undertake exercise at home and were monitored virtually by the PR team.\n\nBetween January and July 2021, 24 participants completed the virtual PR programme (14 Female and 10 Male) with age range from 44–80 years. Of the total number of patients (39) pre-assessed, 32 patients opted for the virtual programme with 24 (75%) of these patients completing the programme. Feedback was collected via questionnaires – of the 24 questionnaires sent out, 22 (92%) questionnaires were completed. 16 patients (73%) who completed feedback found the virtual PR programme to be beneficial or very beneficial.\n\nThere is no doubt that the virtual programme has a role to play for a certain cohort of patients who undergo pulmonary rehabilitation.\n\n2.6 Transitioning between oral and parenteral prostacyclin therapy in two patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension\n\nDevlin S1, Cullivan S1, McCullagh B1, Gaine SP1\n\n1 National Pulmonary Hypertension Unit, Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, Dublin, Ireland\n\nCurrent therapies for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) target the nitric oxide, endothelin and prostacyclin pathways to promote pulmonary vasodilation and reduced right ventricular afterload and failure. Agents that utilise the latter pathway include the prostacyclin analogue epoprostenol, treprostinil, iloprost and selexipag, a selective prostacyclin (IP) receptor agonist. As more medications become available, transitioning between agents is increasingly performed. While clear guidelines exist for initiation of individual drugs, equivalent guidelines for transition between medications are often lacking.\n\nWe describe two cases of transition from oral selexipag to subcutaneous treprostinil in patients with idiopathic PAH. Following an average of 34.5 months on selexipag, the decision was made to transition to parenteral prostacyclin due to NYHA functional class III symptoms and intermediate risk features. The patients were admitted for in-hospital transitions, whereby treprostinil uptitrations could be guided by clinical response and prostacyclin-related side effects. Overall, these transitions were well tolerated, taking place over an average of 11 days. Regarding long-term outcomes, Patient 1 experienced a progressive decline in symptoms and was listed for double lung transplantation, but died 2 years following this transition. Patient 2 remains stable with NYHA FC III symptoms, 4 years later.\n\nOur patient-centred approach, guided by prostacyclin side-effects, was both safe and well-tolerated, providing an example of a safe method of transitioning from oral selexipag to subcutaneous treprostini l.\n\n2.7 Smoking cessation in Irish written guidelines Audit\n\nMohammad Abdulsalam1, Eddie Moloney2, Stephen Lane3, Minesh Kooblall4\n\n1,2,3,4 Department of Respiratory medicine, Tallaght University Hospital\n\nSmoking is an important modifiable risk factor for communicable, non communicable disease and cancer. It is still prevalent despite the huge investments in smoking cessation including global campaigns. The prevalence of smoking in Ireland in 2019 is 19.4% for male gender and 14.8% for female gender, with overall prevalence of 17.1% (1). there was a reduction of around 6% in overall prevalence compared to 2012 (1). However, around 2 out of 10 adults are still smoking in Ireland. Smoking cessation has a significant effect in reducing many diseases prevalence as well as improving their prognosis. Therefore, emphasising this effect and mentioning smoking cessation in the guidelines of disease related to smoking is crucial. a recent Audit published on global guidelines in mentioning smoking cessation showed that 49% of the guidelines mentioned smoking cessation (2). This audit looked at the percentage of Irish guidelines, which are written for conditions linked with smoking, mention smoking cessation. 67% of the screened guidelines mentioned smoking cessation. The target is reaching 100% is still not met which we think is crucial and necessary in preventing and managing these smoking related diseases.\n\nReferences\n\nHse IE (2021) [Internet] [cited 14 June 2021].

We analyse the total thoracic activity related to lung cancer resection in level one trauma centre.\n\nThe purpose of study intended to look at over all thoracic activity & resources requirement related to lung cancer resections, chest trauma & benign lung diseases.\n\nOur results clearly demonstrate that lung cancer resection only consists of approximately 46% of total thoracic activity. Hence it does not represent a true thoracic activity & resources requirement in comparison to centres focusing only on lung cancer resection.\n\n264 thoracic cases have been admitted under cardiothoracic care in cuh\n\nIt includes chest trauma (37 cases), Lung Cancer-Primary & Secondary (123), Benign lung disease (decortication, pleurectomy, Talc pleuredesis, pleural biopsies, Lung volume reduction surgery)-65, Diaphragmatic plication (2), Mediastinal mass/cyst excision -13, Pneumothoraxes & empyema not requiring surgery-24.\n\n2.9 An Audit on the Extra-Pulmonary Screening in Biopsy-Proven Sarcoidosis Patients in the Mater Misericordiae University Hospital\n\nA. Asis1, D. Halim1, N. Boyle1, A. Kirk1, T. McEnery1\n\n1 Department of Respiratory Medicine, Mater Misericoardiae University Hospital, Dublin\n\nThe clinical presentation of sarcoidosis can vary from an asymptomatic state to multi-system involvement. Early detection and timely treatment for asymptomatic extra-pulmonary disease can reduce unnecessary consequences. For this reason, the American Thoracic Society (ATS) have guidelines for the screening of extra-pulmonary involvement at the time of diagnosis.\n\nThis audit aimed to assess local practice in the Mater Hospital of screening for extra-pulmonary involvement in the biopsy-proven pulmonary sarcoidosis patients against the ATS guideline1. A total of 69 patients were diagnosed over the course of the audit timeline from January 2015 to January 2020. 38 patients were excluded as they were referred externally for biopsy but followed up outside Mater Hospital. Table summarises the findings from the audit.\n\nTable\n\nThis audit suggested that our adherence to the ATS screening guideline was variable with none of investigations achieved 100% standard. The implementation of ocular and cardiac investigations was poor with either under or over-ordered. ACE levels were still being ordered despite not being in the recommendation.\n\nIn conclusion, an increased awareness of the recommended screening tests is warranted in order to detect occult extra-pulmonary involvement and to ensure hospital resources are utilised efficiently.\n\nConflict of Interest: None.\n\n2.10 Current Physiotherapy knowledge of temporary Tracheostomies in St. Luke’s General Hospital, Kilkenny\n\nKathleen Dowling, Fiona Blackie\n\nHSE, St. Luke’s General Hospital Kilkenny\n\nTo evaluate current on-call Physiotherapists knowledge of patients with temporary tracheostomies and the role as a profession we play in the management of patients with tracheostomies within the MDT in St. Luke’s hospital Kilkenny from ICU to ward level.\n\nThis will include a validated questionnaire for all on-call physiotherapy staff of pre-existing knowledge.\n\nEducational presentations with audio will be completed by senior respiratory physiotherapist at SLHK for intra-internet access for all staff to complete within a 1 month timeframe and will be re-audited with an additional validated and reliable questionnaire. Once all results have been submitted, an appropriate SPSS format will be used.\n\nThese results will be presented to the working Tracheostomy Group of SLHK which includes antitheses, surgeons, clinical facilitators, nurses and AHPs for review and adaptation for current hospital policy and practice.\n\nCurrent physiotherapist knowledge and practice with patients who have tracheostomies in place may vary across professional levels and areas of experience. As a result, standards of care may differ greatly within physiotherapists. This gives reason for development in this area in order to provide best practice, maintain standards of practice and ultimately provide patients with evidence based care (Bonvento et al. 2017).\n\nUsing Physiotherapy as the example, the hope would be to generate change to practice across the MDT for overall improved care and reduced length of stay in an acute setting (Garrubba et al. 2009).\n\nReferences\n\nBonvento B, Wallace S, Lynch J, Coe B, McGrath BA (2017) Role of the multidisciplinary team in the care of the tracheostomy patient.

Royal Victoria Hospital. Belfast Health and Social care Trust\n\nPrevious data has suggested around 7.2% of patients admitted to hospital with community acquired pneumonia develop a complicated parapneumonic effusion or empyema. 1\n\nA retrospective analysis of patients diagnosed with parapneumonic effusion or empyema between 1st February 2020 and 31st January 2021 was performed assessing patient demographics, co-morbidities, microbiology, time-to-drain and outcomes.\n\nSixteen patients were identified (n = 11 males, mean age 57, mean length of stay 25.6 days); 12 were diagnosed as empyema, three as parapneumonic effusion (2 managed conservatively), one chylothorax. Median time to drain was 3 days (range 1–17); 7 patients required more than one drain. Of the 32 total drains, 15 were inserted by Interventional Radiology, 10 by Respiratory and 7 by Thoracics. Nine patients had positive microbiology and antibiotics rationalised accordingly. Nine patients had a pre-existing respiratory co-morbidity. The majority of patients had clinical and radiological resolution; 1 patient was subsequently diagnosed with a mesothelioma.\n\nThere is a variance in time to drain in patients with suspected empyema which may influence identification of pathogen and subsequent ability to rationalise antimicrobials. Reliance on the multidisciplinary team is highlighted as is the complexity and prolonged length of stay of these cases with the need for multiple interventions for some patients.\n\nReferences\n\nChalmers J, Singanayagam A, Murray M, Scally C, Fawzi A, Hill A (2009) Risk factors for complicated parapneumonic effusion and empyema on presentation to hospital with community-acquired pneumonia.

The paucity of clinical information required on the card precludes triaging of requests. We audited a random selection of PFT orders in 2020 to identify areas for quality improvement.\n\n2751 PFT studies were performed during the audit period in 2020, compared to 4658 studies in 2019; a 41% reduction in activity. 281 (10.2%) were reviewed. 55 (19.6%) referrals did not request a specific test or detail a specific indication, leading to suboptimal testing.\n\nThese incomplete requests were more likely to come from non-respiratory referrers than from within the respiratory department (40% vs 11%). We also found that there was significant repetition of PFTs. Of those patients who previously had PFTs, 83.2% were returning within 2 years of their prior study. A significant proportion (49.8%) of tests were normal, comprising 33% of respiratory requests vs 55.4% of non-respiratory requests.\n\nThe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has led to reduced capacity for PFTs, increased demand for testing, and significant growth in waiting times. The implementation of an electronic ordering system will permit triaging of requests, facilitate online access to results, and improve the efficiency of the PFT service.\n\n2.13 A Clinical Audit on the Use of Respiratory Physiotherapy Outcome Measures on Inpatients in St. Luke’s General Hospital\n\nEve Geraghty\n\nSt. Luke’s General Hospital Carlow/Kilkenny\n\nThe aim of this study was to audit on the use of respiratory physiotherapy outcome measures in St. Luke's Hospital against the European Region World Confederation for Physiotherapy (ERWCPT) Standards1.\n\nCharts of inpatients referred for respiratory physiotherapy were identified and audited. The initial audit was carried out in September 2019 (n = 18) and the repeat audit in October 2020 (n = 12).\n\nFollowing the initial audit, an action plan was implemented that included a literature review, an education session for physiotherapists and a redesign of our Respiratory Physiotherapy Assessment Form.\n\nIn the initial audit, 5.5% of charts had respiratory physiotherapy outcome measures, however this improved to 83.3% in the repeat audit. The Modified Medical Research Council Dyspnoea Scale and the Breathlessness Cough and Sputum Scale were the two most common outcome measures used in the repeat audit (both in 75% of charts).\n\nOutcome measures which have psychometric properties, rather than physiological measures like oxygen saturation, are more favourable in determining the effectiveness of physiotherapy treatment as their validity and reliability have been well-researched, they have minimal clinically important differences and can be patient-centred if using a patient-reported outcome measure. This project ensured that ERWCPT Standards were met with an emphasis on patient-centred care.\n\nReferences\n\n1. https://www.erwcpt.eu/file/233\n\n2.14 Improving the assessment, prescription and follow up of inpatients newly commenced on home oxygen therapy in an acute hospital\n\nC. Gleeson1, C. Gray1, P. Nadarajan1\n\n1 Respiratory Assessment Unit, St. James’s Hospital\n\nA local clinical audit demonstrated that the processes surrounding the provision of home oxygen to patients on discharge from hospitalisation was uncoordinated. This prompted a quality improvement (QI) project with the aim being to increase the adherence of staff to oxygen prescribing guidelines for all inpatients prescribed home oxygen from 0 to 100% over a 12-month period.\n\nThe project team used QI methodology which included stakeholder engagement, process mapping and development of a driver diagram to illustrate our ‘theory of change’ and to plan improvement activities. We used a number of Plan Do Study Act cycles to test and implement changes surrounding the assessment, prescription, education and follow up of inpatients commencing home oxygen therapy on discharge.\n\nAll home oxygen referrals were directed through a Respiratory Assessment Unit and a home oxygen care bundle (7 standards) was developed collaboratively with staff. The median number of oxygen standards met for each patient was 7 (range 6–7) by project completion and has been sustained in the months following the project (Fig. 1)\n\nUse of quality improvement methodology led to standardisation of care for patients prescribed home oxygen on discharge from hospitalisation. The principles used will be used to inform similar QI initiatives for patients commencing home non-invasive ventilation.\n\nFig. 1 – Run Chart demonstrating the number of standards relating to home oxygen ordering process being met in consecutive patients over 12 months\n\n2.15 Impact On Hospital Length of Stay of A Respiratory Assessment Unit\n\nC.

O’Brien\n\nDepartment of Respiratory Medicine, Beaumont Hospital, Dublin 9\n\nA dedicated Respiratory Assessment Unit (RAU) was opened in Beaumont Hospital in January 2021. The initial role of the RAU, which is composed of 9 single rooms, was management of COVID-19 inpatients. Its utilisation has evolved with the changing demands of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe RAU provides an opportunity to potentially decrease patient length of stay and facilitate ambulatory care of common respiratory conditions as well as facilitating access to more rapid diagnostic testing. We reviewed the records of 79 patients assessed in the RAU from July to August 2021.\n\n49/79 patients (62%) were under the care of the respiratory team with the remaining 30 patients under another medical or surgical team. 16/79 (20%) patients were admitted directly to RAU from respiratory clinic electively or urgently. Total hospital length of stay was significantly less in this cohort compared to those admitted via ED or transferred from another inpatient ward and there were 2 (12.5%) same day discharges.\n\n42/79 (53.2%) patients were admitted with a non-respiratory diagnosis and 19/79 (24.1%) underwent specialist respiratory intervention. 11/79 patients (13.9%) required use of non-invasive ventilation or high flow nasal cannula.\n\n2.16 Improving Awareness of Monitoring and Education of Patients Prescribed Methotrexate in Respiratory Care\n\nDr Séadna Burke, Dr Arsalan Shahid, Dr Ríana Minogue, Dr Kieran Cooper, Dr Katherine Finan\n\nSligo University Hospital, SAOLTA University Healthcare Group\n\nMethotrexate is a dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor used to treat a variety of autoimmune conditions. It has significant potential for adverse events. In respiratory medicine, BTS guidelines recommend its use to treat steroid dependent sarcoidosis. As use in a general respiratory clinic is rare, there can be a lack of formal monitoring systems in place.\n\nWe reviewed patients receiving methotrexate treatment for sarcoidosis in SUH respiratory clinic between 2018 and 2021 and assessed their adherence to blood monitoring. We subsequently created a questionnaire and assessed their knowledge of important adverse events and precautions. Of the six patients we identified, five did not meet the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) recommended blood monitoring requirements of three-monthly complete blood count and liver function tests. Only four were aware of the requirement for blood monitoring. Four were not aware of issues surrounding fertility or restrictions on vaccinations. Only three patients were aware of the risk of liver damage, and only one was aware of potential myelosuppression. None were aware of significant interactions with other medications.\n\nAdapting pre-existing patient information leaflets and blood monitoring booklets developed by the local rheumatology service, we will now introduce these for use in our patients, aiming to improve patient education and monitoring.\n\n2.17 Is O2 too much of a Go To? An Audit of our Clinical Practice\n\nAoife Sheehan, Caoimhe Murray\n\nPhysiotherapy Department, St. Lukes General Hospital Kilkenny.\n\nOxygen is considered to be a drug, and as such should be prescribed. Across the UK only 57% of patients had a valid oxygen prescription.1 The objective of this study was to audit current practices and evidence based knowledge among NCHDs, nursing staff and physiotherapists in St. Luke’s General Hospital. The overall aim of this project was to prevent incorrect oxygenation and maintain oxygen prescription practice within best practice guidelines.\n\nThis is a mixed method study. 1) A chart audit took place (n = 98) Inclusion criteria: Medical patient receiving oxygen therapy and admitted > 24 h. 2) A survey was undertaken among medical professionals (n = 51)\n\nIt showed 52% of patients were receiving oxygen therapy without any form of written order, parameter or prescription. This percentage is higher than the UK.1 Sixty-five percent of staff stated that all patients should have oxygen parameters charted. 85% of staff understood the necessary documentation that should be prescribed.\n\nOxygen prescription remains complex for a drug that is administered so frequently. It is associated with greater error than that seen with antibiotics. Education should stress more prudent prescription and use of oxygen as is can be detrimental to many of the patients who receive it.\n\n2.18 Establishment of a Tertiary Care Respiratory Assessment Unit\n\nSíle Toland, Lucy Power, Conor Hayes, RK Morgan, ME O’Brien\n\nDepartment of Respiratory Medicine, Beaumont Hospital, Dublin 9\n\nA purpose built Respiratory Assessment Unit (RAU) opened in Beaumont Hospital in January 2021 comprising of 9 single rooms.\n\nThe RAU provides early specialist input for a range of respiratory conditions via a multi-disciplinary team of respiratory doctors, nurses, ANPs, and physiotherapists. The RAU supports both scheduled and unscheduled inpatient and ambulatory care, including COVID-19 assessment and delivery of advanced respiratory supports.\n\nOver 6 months, 280 patients’ RAU admissions were evaluated, including 114 (40.7%) with COVID-19 pneumonia. Initially the RAU treated patients with COVID-19 presenting with acute respiratory failure and provided advanced respiratory supports, such as non-invasive ventilation. Early specialist respiratory input for patients presenting to ED supported inpatient and ambulatory pathways for COVID-19 care.\n\nOf the total 280 patients, there were 232 (82.85%) patients transferred from ED, 25 (8.9%) elective admissions, 8 (2.85%) OPD admission, and 15 (5.35%) direct ED admissions.\n\n2.19 An Integrated Respiratory Service—from paper to patient and beyond\n\nAgnes Barry, Rosaleen Reilly, Stanley DW Miller\n\nMeath Integrated Respiratory Service (MIRS), Our Lady’s Hospital, Navan, Co Meath\n\nSlaintecare funding for the Meath Integrated Respiratory Service (MIRS) commenced in March 2021. MIRS aims to provide both local chronic respiratory care and a reduction in acute hospital admissions for patients in County Meath. We describe development of the service.\n\nInitial weeks were spent identifying service requirements and creating an implementation timeline. Administrative and clinical accommodation, governance structures and equipment were agreed. Primary and secondary care stakeholders collaboratively identified service needs and challenges. Priority areas and benchmarking were identified through audit.\n\nDocuments describing model of care, policies, pathways, patient assessments, evaluation framework and reporting structure were developed. A single referral pathway was established. We promoted our service and delivered education to all healthcare professionals.\n\nService implementation occurred simultaneously in acute, home and outpatient settings. Our expertise allows for supportive discharge and admission avoidance. Pulmonary rehabilitation is delivered in virtual and face to face format. Regular multidisciplinary meetings allow for clinical supervision, shared expertise and learning. Key performance indicators (KPIs) are captured on our activity database.\n\nMIRS now successfully provides Integrated Respiratory Care for Co. Meath. We have learned the benefit of careful planning, patience and persistence. We provide further advice for others initiating similar services highlighting barriers with suggested solutions.\n\n2.20 A Survey On The Use Of Adult High Flow Nasal Oxygen in Cork University Hospital\n\nSiobhán Healy1, Annemarie Fitzgerald1, Avril Hallahan1, Maeve O’Grady1, Desmond Murphy1, Michael T Henry1\n\n1 Cork University Hospital\n\nUsage of high flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) continues to expand. However there is limited information on usage in acute hospitals. This survey reviewed HFNO usage in Cork University Hospital (CUH).\n\nCUH Airvos (HFNO device) were tracked by physiotherapists from March 2020 to March 2021. Information on machine usage, locations and settings was captured. A detailed patient (non-covid) database was completed for fourteen weeks from July to Oct 2020.\n\nAirvos were tracked as being in use 3397 times. Table one shows the settings used. The average daily number of Airvos used was 13 (maximum 43). There were 124 patients on Airvo during the fourteen weeks. The respiratory ward had the highest number of patients; 46% of patients moved ward/room while on Airvo; median Airvo duration was 4 days and median length of hospital stay was 25 days. Physiotherapy was the discipline that most commonly set it up, initiated weaning and discontinued Airvo. Airvo outcome: 74% successfully weaned, < 1% RIP, 14% palliation/comfort care. Hospital outcome: 75% discharged from CUH, 25% RIP in hospital (see Table ).\n\nOur data provides a snapshot of current acute HFNO use and outcomes and identifies some areas for improvement, e.g. implementing a guideline for intra-hospital transfer of patients on HFNO.\n\n2.21 Attitudes and Dimensions Influencing Physical Activity in Pulmonary Hypertension Patients\n\nCiara McCormacka*, Sarah Cullivanb, Brona Kehoec, Noel McCaffreyd, Sean Gaineb, Brian McCullaghb, Niall M.

LUNG CANCER BRONCHOSCOPY\n\n3.1 Real world Experience of Single Use Flexible Bronchoscopy over Six Months in a Tertiary Centre\n\nAnne-Marie Sweeney1*, Grace Kavanagh1*, Patrick Coghlan1, Hammad Danish1, Fernando Gomez1, Barry Plant1, Michael Henry1, Marcus Peter Kennedy1\n\n1 Department of Respiratory Medicine, Cork University Hospital\n\n* = joint first authors\n\nThe development of single use flexible bronchoscopes (SUFBs) has accelerated in recent years, with the reduced risk of infectious transmission and reduced need for endoscopy staffing particularly advantageous in the COVID-19 pandemic era. We trialled the routine use of The Surgical Company Bronchoflex© SUFB in a tertiary bronchoscopy service.\n\n139 procedures were performed by five consultants from January to July 2021. The majority were carried out for infection (45%) and malignancy (32%). Most were performed in the endoscopy suite, however 8 procedures took place in ICU, 6 at ward level and 3 in theatre as an adjunct to a rigid bronchoscope. The SUFBs were used across a range of procedures including bronchoalveolar lavage, brushings, endobronchial biopsy, transbronchial needle aspiration, argon plasma coagulation, cryobiopsy and stent placement.\n\n85% of procedures were reported to have no complications related to the use of a SUFB with a user satisfaction score of above 4/5 in 89% of cases. Issues with image quality (6%) or suction (5%) meant the reversion to reusable bronchoscope in some cases.\n\nOverall, the use of SUFBs has significant benefits in patient care with the ability to use the SUFB across a range of indications and procedures with high user satisfaction.\n\n3.2 Lung Cancer Detection During COVID-19 Pandemic\n\nD Halim1, S Foley1, A Asis1, CR Cayabyab1, C Higgins1, F Colhon1, D Burnei1, RK Morgan1, ME O’Brien1\n\n1 Department of Respiratory Medicine, Beaumont Hospital, Dublin\n\nLung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide and delayed diagnosis is associated with poor outcomes. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a considerable amount of strain on all healthcare services internationally. Our aim is to establish the effects of COVID-19 pandemic to the lung cancer detection in Beaumont Hospital across the 3 waves.\n\nWe compared the number of lung cancer referrals and lung cancer diagnoses made via both the in-patient and out-patient pathways throughout COVID-19 pandemic compared to similar periods in two years preceding; 2019 and 2018. Each wave lasted approximately 3 months each.\n\nThe number of referral to Rapid Access Lung Cancer Clinic (RALCC) saw a significant reduction during the first wave, with significant increase during the second wave and non-significant change in the third wave when compared to previous years. The difference in the number of referral between 3 waves were all significant. Despite the variability in each wave, all referrals were seen in RALCC within the targeted 10 working days. Diagnosis of lung cancer from RALCC trended similarly to the number of the referrals. Total diagnoses remained comparable to previous years but with increased proportion of late stage diagnoses. Interestingly, inpatient diagnoses of lung cancer in 2020 almost doubled compared to previous years (n = 71 vs 44 & 40), of which 90% were in advanced stage.\n\nThese results demonstrated that lung cancer detection was delayed during the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic with compensatory increase in referral and late stage diagnosis in the second wave.\n\nGraph shows the trend of lung cancer referrals during COVID-19 pandemic\n\n3.3 Accuracy of Multidisciplinary Team Consensus for Lung Cancer Resection in the absence of pre-operative histology: A five-year experience\n\nJack Whooley, Rebecca Weedle, Alexandra White, Alan Soo\n\nDepartment of Cardiothoracic Surgery, University Hospital Galway\n\nLung resection remains the cornerstone of treatment for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). British Thoracic Society (BTS) guidelines recommends pursuing pre-operative diagnosis and staging as much as possible. In the absence of pre-operative histological diagnosis, surgical treatment can be offered in conjunction with multidisciplinary team (MDT) and patient consensus. We aimed to assess the accuracy of our thoracic MDT in recommending treatment for those with suspected NSCLC in patients who do not have a confirmed pre-operative histological diagnosis.\n\nA retrospective review was performed of patients undergoing lung resection at the recommendation of the thoracic MDT for suspected NSCLC in our unit between May 2016 and August 2021. Patients with confirmed histological diagnosis were excluded from analysis.\n\n227 patients underwent lung resection without pre-operative histology in the five-year period. 54.6% were female, mean age was 67.4 years. Overall, the positive predictive value of the MDT team consensus for lung malignancy in the absence of pre-operative histology was 89.4% (true positive n = 203/227.)\n\nPerforming lung resection in the absence of pre-operative histology is reasonable if done in conjunction with MDT consensus and appropriate patient counselling, in keeping with the British Thoracic Society Guidelines.\n\n3.4 Vats Vs Thoracotomy for primary lung cancer, single surgeon audit\n\nDaniyal Arshad, Muhammad Nadeem Anjum, Tanya Chandwani, Mr Kishore Doddakula\n\nCork University Hospital\n\nDuring the covid period, we evaluated all cancer resections undergone in a tertiary referral centre.\n\nThe purpose of study was to evaluate the rate preoperative histological diagnosis and its impact on postoperative recovery and resources requirement.\n\nAll patients following discussion in lung cancer Multi-disciplinary meeting subjected to pulmonary resection were included. Approximately 21% patients did not have preoperative histological diagnosis and required frozen section (Histopathology) prior to definite procedure e.g. completion lobectomies. The usual reasons for not having preoperative histological diagnosis are;\n\nEmphysematous lungs (high risk of pneumothorax during CT guided biopsy).\n\nProximity of lesion to major vascular structures.\n\nTechnically difficult areas to biopsy(behind the scapulae, ribs)\n\nSmall nodules/Ground glass lesion.\n\nApproximately 80% of the patients requiring thoracotomy were patients who needed completion lobectomy following VATs wedge resection as a follow up procedure. There is one day less hospital stay for VATs group. Systematic lymphadenectomy was performed in all resections.\n\nOur study reveals lack of histology prior to surgery does impact on length of surgery and hospital stay. Furthermore it does carry a risk of patients requiring second procedure.\n\n3.5 Dedicated Lung Nodule Services Reduces Need for Follow up Imaging\n\nWalsh S, Cogan G, Counihan I, Quinn A, Hassan T\n\nOur Lady of Lourdes Hospital Drogheda\n\nThe management of solitary lung nodules using the BTS guidelines 2015 can increase the detection rate of early-stage lung cancers and reducing unnecessary CT surveillance. To date, there is a lack of dedicated nodule services in Ireland. We audit the impact of a dedicated service in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital.\n\nCT surveillance for solitary lung nodules performed 15 months before and after the introduction of a dedicated nodule service were compared. Retrospective NIMIS review were used to capture nodules detected incidentally. The MDM nodule service was attended 6 weekly by a respiratory physician and radiologist with outcomes sent to the primary physicians including the rapid access clinic if deemed appropriate.\n\n79% of CT surveillance were deemed inappropriate (either unnecessary or outside the interval window as per BTS Guidelines) before the service was introduced (Fig. 1). This reversed to over 80% of appropriate surveillance thereafter. The number of CT surveillance performed after was also reduced by 74% following the service (Fig. 1).\n\nA dedicated nodule service is effective in reducing CT surveillance which might alleviate both unnecessary waste for the hospitals and anxiety to patients.\n\n3.6 An Audit of Endobronchial Ultrasound Services for Detection of Lung Cancer in University Hospital Galway 2020\n\nNeil Hyland1, Dominic Doyle1, David Breen1\n\nUniversity Hospital Galway\n\nEndobronchial Ultrasound (EBUS) is an important method of detecting of lung malignancies. Efficient access to high quality EBUS services is important to reach targets set by the National Health Service (NHS) Lung Cancer Expert Group. This study was carried out as no such audit had previously been undertaken in University Hospital Galway.\n\nA three-month period was examined from June to August 2020 with fifty patients included. Data was extracted from EBUS records and compared with Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) set by the NHS Lung Cancer Clinical Expert Group.\n\nResults recorded were KPIs being met or not. The majority were met (13/17) including: Pathological results received within five days (> 85), total pathology pathway time under ten days (> 85%), pathological confirmation rate in advanced disease (> 90%) and adequate tissue for genetic marker testing (> 90%).\n\nKPIs not met included: Procedure within seven days of referral (> 85%), complication rate (< 5%) and procedures with node stations inadequate (< 10%).\n\nConclusions: The major shortcoming was the timing of procedure from referral indicating limitations in access. The complication rates were slightly above the KPI standards, but just two out of fifty total and no major complications were seen. Repeat audit is crucial to examine changes in the intervening time.\n\n3.7 Proteomic Analysis Of The Nanoparticle Biomolecular Corona Formed In The Plasma Of Lung Cancer Patients And Healthy Controls\n\nIulia Marinescu1, Marco Monopoli2, Cormac McCarthy1,3, Ngoc Duong Trinh 2, Michael P. Keane1,3\n\n1 UCD School of Medicine, University College Dublin, Belfield, Dublin 4, Ireland\n\n2 Department of Chemistry, Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, 123 St Stephen's Green, Dublin 2, Ireland\n\n3 Department of Respiratory Medicine, St. Vincent’s University Hospital, Elm Park, Dublin 4, Ireland\n\nA challenge posed by lung cancer biomarker screening is that target proteins have low molecular weights and are too difficult to isolate by standard mass spectrometry (MS). Using nanoparticles (NPs) and the protein corona formed on their surface to isolate molecules of interest may be a more efficient way to detect low-abundance proteins related to malignancy. In this study, we characterize the corona of silica NPs incubated with human plasma from lung cancer patients and healthy volunteers.\n\nSamples were analysed using dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and MS. The raw data was imported into MaxQuant for label-free quantification and then analysed using the softwares Perseus and Cytoscape.\n\nGel densitometry analysis revealed two significantly different protein bands between lung cancer and controls. MS analysis identified five significantly downregulated proteins in the lung cancer group. The most abundant proteins identified were apolipoprotein A-I, fibrinogen, albumin and proteins of the complement family.\n\nThe results of our analysis provide information on how the surface constitution of NPs may influence their interaction with the internal environment. The downregulation of several proteins in the cancer samples suggests an altered molecular make-up in malignancy and may contribute to the discovery of specific biomarkers for lung cancer screening.\n\n3.8 Bronchoscopy Training using ALFIE™ (Airway Low-Fidelity including Endobronchial Ultrasound Bio-simulator) and Single Use Flexible Bronchoscopy\n\nDeasy KF1, Sweeney AM1, O’Reilly BA1,2,3, Kennedy MP1,2,3\n\n1 Department of Respiratory Medicine, Cork University Hospital\n\n2 ASSERT Centre, University College Cork\n\n3 College of Medicine and Health, University College Cork\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in us having to reconsider our traditional teaching modalities and develop newer, dynamic methods of furthering medics’ education.\n\nBoth high and low fidelity simulators in bronchoscopy including endobronchial guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) are costly. We considered whether a combination of a low-cost bio-simulator made of recyclable (ALFIE™) and single use flexible bronchoscopy (SUFB) have the capability of differentiating novices from experts, and the ability to train novices in bronchoscopy?\n\nSenior house officers (SHO) and Registrars were invited to training on ALFIE™ using a commercially available SUFB. Trainees were evaluated individually before and after training using a modified validated Bronchoscopy Skills and Tasks Assessment Tool (B-STAT) including the scope handling, endobronchial biopsy and brushing.\n\n18 trainees were included (14 SHOs and 4 Registrars). Pre-training assessment of scope handling differentiated novices from experienced bronchoscopists ((p = 0.0025 (95% confidence intervals (CI) 3.12–12.17). Training of novices was associated with an improvement in scope handling and sampling (p = 0.0001 (95% CI 4.73–10.27)).\n\nALFIE™ and SUFB have the potential to create a low-cost platform for remote training in bronchoscopy. Even beyond the COVID-19 pandemic with a combination of virtual teaching software, this potentially provides a convenient training platform to train junior doctors remotely.\n\n3.9 Is high dependancy unit mandatory for all lung resection\n\nDaniyal Arshad, Muhammad Nadeem Anjum, Tanya Chandwani, Mr Kishore Doddakula\n\nCork University Hospital Cork\n\nWe evaluated all pulmonary cancer resection performed by single surgeon in cuh with no HDU (high dependency unit).\n\nThe purpose of study was to evaluate postoperative pain management & safety of patients undergoing lung resections in cardiothoracic ward in absence of high dependency unit & non availability of Intensive care beds\n\nPostoperative pain in VATs group (approximately 81%) was managed with epidural/paravertebral catheter in the ward.\n\nPatients undergoing thoracotomy (approximately 19%) were managed postoperatively in ICU (Intensive Care Unit)\n\nThere is one day less hospital stay for VATs group.\n\nNo significant difference in the lymph node station dissection between the two groups.\n\nNone of the patients in VATs (Video assisted thoracoscopy) group required ICU (Intensive Care Unit) admission.\n\nOur study clearly demonstrates that with adequate postoperative pain management strategy in patients undergoing lung resection can be easily managed in the cardiothoracic ward.\n\nConflict of Interest: None.\n\n3.10 Surgery vs. radiotherapy for the treatment of early-stage non-small cell lung cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis of propensity matched studies\n\nSean Barrett1,2, Darragh Rice1, Patrick P Higgins1, Christina Fleming1,2, Donna Eaton1\n\n1 Mater Misercordiae University Hospital, Dublin, Ireland\n\n2 Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, Dublin, Ireland\n\nLung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. With the increasing popularity of lung cancer screening, the incidence of early-stage non-small cell lung cancers is on the rise. The current gold standard for management of early disease is surgery. Advances in radiotherapy techniques has led to an increase in the effectiveness of this treatment modality.\n\nOur objectives were to extract 5- and 3- year survival and recurrence rates from propensity matched studies and synthesise data as a meta-analysis.\n\nA search of Pubmed, Embase, and Scopus, was performed up to April 2021. We included retrospective propensity score matched studies for quantitative analysis. The study adhered to PRISMA guidelines. Statistical analysis was performed using Revman software.\n\n22 studies were included. There were statistically significant superior outcomes in the surgical group for 5- year [RR 1.47 (95% CI 1.28–1.68) p < 0.001] and 3-year overall survival [RR 1.24 (95% CI 1.10–1.40) p < 0.001]. Findings persisted on subgroup analysis of lobectomy and sublobar resection versus radiotherapy.\n\nBest current evidence in the form of a meta-analysis of retrospective propensity matched studies demonstrates that surgery remains the gold standard of treatment for early-stage NSCLC.\n\nTable . Summary of Outcomes\n\n3.11 Early stage lung cancer presents incidentally. Is it time for a national lung cancer screening program?\n\nRuaidhri J. Keane1, Grainne Cogan1, Ian Counihan1\n\n1 Respiratory Department, Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, Co. Louth, Ireland\n\nLung cancer is the most common cause of death from cancer worldwide. The overall survival rate remains poor as most patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage1. Lung cancer screening (LCS) has been implemented in the USA and China following the National Lung Screening Trial which showed significant reduction in lung cancer mortality with CT screening2. A large European trial, NELSON trial, published similar results3.\n\nThe aim of this retrospective, single centre study was to evaluate the percentage of people with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who underwent radical treatment that were incidentally diagnosed to explore the benefits of a possible screening program.\n\n43 patients diagnosed with stage I/II NSCLC who underwent radical treatment were identified in a Level-4 hospital in Ireland from 2018 to the end of 2020. 56% (n = 24) of these patients had an incidental diagnosis with a mean age of 67.75 years, 95% CI [64.4–71.1]. 92% (n = 22) had a history of smoking and 54% were male. During the same period, 68% (n = 121) of patients diagnosed with stage III/IV NSCLC (n = 178), mean age 68.9 years, received anti-cancer treatment.\n\nThis study supports the urgent exploration of the feasibility of LCS in an Irish population.\n\nReferences\n\nSiegel R, Miller K, Jemal A (2020) Cancer statistics, 2020.

O’Connor\n\nDepartment of Respiratory Medicine, Mercy University Hospital, Cork, Ireland\n\nWe analyzed data over a 10-year period (2010–2020) of patients with lung cancer diagnosed in the Mercy University Hospital (MUH) to determine whether there is improvement in early detection of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).\n\nNSCLC remains the most common type of lung cancer presentation in MUH, accounting for 602 (59%) of 1027 cases. The sex ratio was 1.5 male to female, but mean age at diagnosis was comparable at 66 years. The majority of NSCLC were diagnosed at later stages—272 (45%) at Stage 4 and 144 (24%) at Stage 3. The remaining 55 (9%), 95 (16%) and 36 (6%) were Stage 2, Stage 1 and unknown respectively.\n\nLooking in more depth at those diagnosed in Stage 4, the percentage of patients diagnosed at late stage remained constant throughout the 10-year interval, varying from 40%—60%.\n\nData collected from our institution were consistent with national data from 2012–2014, which showed most lung cancer was diagnosed at Stage 4 (40%) and Stage 3 (25%). These results reflect that the last five years did not show significant improvements in detecting NSCLC at an earlier stage. These data support the case for lung cancer screening in Ireland.\n\n3.14 A review of complications post CT guided lung biopsies in the Mid-Western Lung Cancer Centre\n\nKashif Rana1, Gillian Bennett1, Blessing Okpaje1, Shahram Shahsavari1, Adam Farrell1, Paul Hession2, A O’Brien1\n\n1 Department of Respiratory Medicine, University Hospital Limerick, Limerick\n\n2 Department of Radiology, University Hospital Limerick, Limerick\n\nPercutaneous CT-guided transthoracic needle biopsy is used to classify pulmonary lesions difficult to reach by bronchoscopy. The most common complications are pneumothorax (0–61%), chest drain insertion (3.3–15%), intrapulmonary haemorrhage (5–16.9%) and haemoptysis (1.25–5%). Other adverse events, including systemic air embolism, needle tract seeding, and death have a much lower incidence (< 1% of cases). An erect chest x-ray(cxr) is sufficient to detect the majority of post biopsy pneumothoraces.\n\nWe retrospectively reviewed the incidence of complications post CT guided lung biopsies performed from 2019 until 2020 in the Mid-Western lung cancer centre, University Hospital Limerick(UHL). We investigated patients age, gender, post biopsy incidence of pneumothoraces, pneumothoraces requiring chest drain/admission, haemoptysis and haemorrhage.\n\n34.6%(28/81) of patients had pneumothoraces on cxrs performed two hours post biopsies. Out of those 28.6%(8/28) patients required chest drain insertion and 71.4%(20/28) of patients were managed conservatively. 11.1%(9/81) had a haemorrhage and 4.9%(4/81) reported haemoptysis post procedure. Only 14 patients were admitted due to complications of pneumothoraces and haemorrhage. There were no cases of systemic air embolism, needle tract seeding or death.\n\nThe complication rate post CT guided lung biopsies in UHL is similar to those reported in international published literature.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

As a consequence, and to maintain thoracic surgical oncology, the thoracic surgical service at our institution relocated to the Blackrock Clinic from March 25th to June 30th 2020.\n\nA retrospective satisfaction audit was conducted on ninety three patients who had thoracic surgery during that period. Of the eighty nine patients who received a telephone call, 59 patients agreed to participate in the audit.\n\n88% of participants agreed (A) or strongly agreed (SA) that the communication from the hospital prior to admission was good. 99% of participants (A or SA) that the facilities were excellent. Participants reported a high level of satisfaction with the communication received from the multidisciplinary team (96% A or SA). 98% (A or SA) that all precautions were taken to prevent them from getting Covid-19 infection during their hospital stay and 97% (A or SA) with the statement “I felt safe while in hospital”.\n\nThe theme of “Acceptance” emerged from responses to the no visitor policy.\n\nOur findings reassuringly demonstrate that patients felt safe during an unprecedented time for the Irish health service and that their experience reflected our own.\n\n3.16 Meeting Quality Standards in Endobronchial Ultrasound\n\nDr Naoise Smyth, Dr Martin Kelly, Dr Ciaran King\n\nAltnagelvin Area Hospital, Derry, County Derry\n\nEndobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) plays a key role in the diagnosis and staging of suspected lung cancer. We reviewed EBUS data from April–October 2020, comparing results with the British Thoracic Society’s “Quality Standards for Flexible Bronchoscopy in Adults”.1\n\nUsing the Northern Ireland Electronic Care Record (NIECR) we reviewed the following areas for all procedures carried out during this study: the sedation given during EBUS; the use of staging computed tomography (CT) prior to EBUS; sensitivity of EBUS; and the occurrence of complications.\n\nIn terms of sedation we used on average less than the usual maximum dose of midazolam (3.28 mg versus 3.5-7 mg) but more than the usual maximum dose of fentanyl (64.15mcg versus 50mcg).\n\nAll patients (n = 53) had appropriate CT imaging prior to EBUS (target 100%).\n\n85% of samples were diagnostic (target > 88%).\n\nComplications occurred in 3.7% of cases (target < 1%) and included sedation reversal.\n\nOur results suggest that exceeding the advised maximum dose of sedatives can lead directly to complications such as the need for reversal agents, meaning that missing one target leads to missing others. While we are meeting some of our targets there is still progress to be made in other areas.\n\n1 https://www.brit-thoracic.org.uk/document-library/quality-standards/flexible-bronchoscopy/bts-quality-standards-for-flexible-bronchoscopy-2014/\n\n3.17 Single Use Flexible Bronchoscopy: An ex-vivo comparison of all commercially available scopes\n\nDeasy KF1, Sweeney AM1, O’Reilly EM1, Kennedy MP1\n\n1 Department of Respiratory Medicine, Cork University Hospital\n\nThe development of single use flexible bronchoscopes (SUFB) has proceeded with pace over the last 2 years. Concerns regarding infection related to standard bronchoscopes with subsequent COVID-19 pandemic accelerated global uptake with multiple companies releasing SUFB. There has been no ex-vivo comparison of SUFBs to date.\n\nWe obtained samples of all commercially available SUFBs (TSC Broncoflex©, Boston Scientific©, Ambu©, Vathin© and Pentax© prototype). We compared technical metrics using a custom-built bench toolkit engineered to allow standardised. Angulation was analysed by a force meter to ascertain the effort needed to fully flex the scopes while empty and while accessed by both a forceps and cytology brush.\n\nThe Boston Scientific Exalt© SUFB had the tightest consistent turning envelope at 64-69 mm, this resulted in the highest maximal thumb force required (13-37 N). The Ambu© SUFB had the best performance in terms of force (11.8–13.7 N) to angulation (150—190°). The SUFB from Vathin© and Broncoflex© provided a compromise, with increased angulation (180–209°, 148–215°) but at the cost of higher thumb force compared to Ambu© (15.7 N-29.4 N, 10.24 N-24.23 N).\n\nThis research helps to inform the practical usability of each bronchoscope when deciding which SUFB is best for the physicians intended end use. Further research should look at perceived qualitative assessment of SUFB by clinicians.\n\n3.18 ALFIE: Airway Low Fidelity Including Endobronchial Ultrasound Bio-simulator\n\nAnne-Marie Sweeney1, Kevin Frederick Deasy1, Barry Aidan O’Reilly2,3, Marcus Peter Kennedy1,2,3\n\n1. Dept of Respiratory Medicine, Cork University Hospital, Wilton, Cork, Ireland\n\n2. ASSERT Centre, University College Cork, Cork, Ireland\n\n3. College of Medicine and Health, University College Cork, Cork, Ireland\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has prioritised the role of simulation-based training. Both high and low fidelity simulators in bronchoscopy including endobronchial ultrasound guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) are costly. The purpose of this research was to develop a low fidelity bio-simulator from predominately recyclable household materials and to demonstrate its utility in EBUS-TBNA skills training.\n\nThe ALFIE (Airway Low Fidelity Including EBUS) bio-simulator was developed from household and plumbing materials with organic materials (fruit) used as pseudo-peri-bronchial lymph nodes. Residents (novices) and fellows (advanced trainees) were tested using a modified validated EBUS-TBNA scoring tool before and after training on the bio-simulator. EBUS scope handling score, EBUS-TBNA score and a combined EBUS score were calculated.\n\n19 trainees (11 residents, 8 fellows) were included. Pre-training assessment of EBUS scope handling differentiated novices from experienced bronchoscopists (p = 0.0005 (95% confidence intervals 1.3–2.95)). Novice EBUS scope handling scores improved after training (p = 0.0011 (95% confidence intervals 0.41–1.22)). Significant improvements in EBUS-TBNA score (p = 0.0011 (n = 7, 95% confidence intervals 0.35–5.09)) and total EBUS score (p = 0.0472 (95% confidence intervals 0.03–1.4.65)) were identified in fellows after training.\n\nAssessment of scope handling on ALFIE differentiated novices from more experienced bronchoscopists. Trainees’ bronchoscopy skills improved with training on ALFIE bio-simulator.\n\n3.19 Pre-Clinical Testing of Single Use Flexible Bronchoscopes: Clinician Preference based on Physical Characteristics and Level of Experience\n\nAnne-Marie Sweeney1, Kevin Frederick Deasy1, Emily O’Reilly1, Hisham Ibrahim2, Hammad Danish1, Tara O’Sullivan1, David Landers1, Marcus Peter Kennedy1\n\n1 Dept. of Respiratory Medicine, Cork University Hospital, Wilton, Cork, Ireland\n\n2 Dept. of Respiratory Medicine, Mercy University Hospital, Cork, Ireland\n\n3 ASSERT Centre, University College Cork, Cork, Ireland\n\n4 College of Medicine and Health, University College Cork, Cork, Ireland\n\nSingle use flexible bronchoscopes (SUFBs) have come to the forefront in the COVID-19 pandemic due to the need to minimise risk of infectious transmission as well as carry out bedside procedures for critically unwell patients. Multiple companies have released SUFBs with varying technical metrics.\n\n39 participants including physicians, surgeons and anaesthetists with a range of expertise from first time endoscopists to consultants took part in a trial of all available SUFBs (The Surgical Company (TSC) Broncoflex©, Boston Scientific©, Ambu©, Vathin©, Pentax© prototype scope). Likert scales were used for evaluation of scope parameters including ergonomics, comfort and ease of technical procedures. Participant parameters were collected including height, gender and hand size.\n\nTSC Broncoflex© was the preferred bronchoscope with an average score of 45.4/55 including 82.1% for ergonomics and 83% for usage. Female participants (n = 12) preferred Pentax (48.5/55) while male participants preferred TSC (44.3/55). Participants with small (n = 10) or medium (n = 23) glove size preferred Pentax (48.5/55; 45.3/55); those with large glove size (n = 5) ranked Vathin and TSC highest (44.4/55, 44/55). Doctors with > 10 years experience preferred Pentax (p = 0.04); less experienced groups preferred TSC.\n\nIn conclusion, gender, hand size and previous experience influenced scope preference. These factors should be considered in future scope development.\n\nConflict of Interest: None.\n\n3.20 Assessment of user satisfaction and experience of three commercially available Single Use Bronchoscopes in a clinical setting\n\nEmily O’Reilly1, Anne-Marie Sweeney1, Kevin Deasy1, Marcus Peter Kennedy1\n\n1 Department of Respiratory Medicine, Cork University Hospital, Wilton, Cork\n\nSingle use Flexible bronchoscopes (SUFBs) are an alternative to reusable flexible bronchoscopes with the reduced endoscopy capacity and increased infection control considerations during the covid-19 pandemic. SUFBs minimize infectious transmission and can be used during bedside procedures. Multiple SUFB brands are available.\n\nWith institutional ethical approval, we prospectively gathered data on one new (Boston Scientific©) and two established (AMBU© and Vathin©) SUFBs to assess clinician satisfaction between June–August 2021. Patient gender, procedure performed, indication, location, SUFB used, complications, and overall user satisfaction were assessed.\n\nTwenty-two procedures were examined (12 Boston Scientific©, 5 AMBU©, 5 Vathin©). Eleven patients were male. Twenty-one procedures were performed in endoscopy, and 1 on the ward. All included airway assessment, 68% BAL, and 5% endotracheal biopsy. There were no complications with the Boston Scientific© scope. There was poor image quality in all (n = 5) AMBU© procedures (only scope without High-Definition Camera). There was dissatisfaction with suction in all (n = 5) Vathin© procedures (persistent suction without activation by scope). Using a satisfaction scale (1–5), mean score for Boston Scientific©, AMBU©, and Vathin© were 5, 2.8, and 2.8 respectively.\n\nReal-world data on SUFBs use in a clinical setting should be considered when selecting brands available within a hospital group.\n\n4.
