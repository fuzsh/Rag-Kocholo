        "text": "Shirley Colleen Smith (Social worker)\n\nShirley Colleen Smith, or Mum Shirl, was a Warudjuri woman born in 1921 on Erambie Mission near Cowra in Central West NSW. Her time as an activist and social worker saw countless Indigenous Australians being treated with compassion, and provided with shelter, medical attention, and a platform for their struggles and stories.\n\nSmith was brought up by her grandparents, who taught her to speak 16 Aboriginal languages. She maintained this fierce connection to culture and country even once she moved to Sydney. After her brother was imprisoned, Smith began regularly visiting prisoners, and was even relied upon in court cases involving the Aboriginal community.\n\nIn the 1970s her work became more organised, as she helped found the Aboriginal Legal Service, the Aboriginal Medical Service, the Aboriginal Black Theatre, the Aboriginal Tent Embassy, the Aboriginal Children’s Service, the Aboriginal Housing Company, and the Detoxification Centre. In 1972, Smith spoke alongside PM Gough Whitlam at a Labor Party campaign event. She continued to personally volunteer, offering her home to any Indigenous people needing a place to stay, and someone to talk to.\n\nShe was awarded a Member of the British Empire in 1977, and a Member of the Order of Australia in 1985. However, Smith expressed complicated feelings in accepting these awards, as at the time there were still businesses across the country that would not even serve her, and equality was far from reached.\n\nSmith continued to support her community – in prisons, politically, and on the streets – until her death in 1998.\n\nRachel Perkins (Filmmaker)\n\nRachel Perkins is a distinguished Australian film and television director, producer, and screenwriter, known for her exceptional contributions to Indigenous storytelling in the entertainment industry. Born in Canberra in 1970, she is of Arrernte and Kalkadoon heritage and was raised by her renowned Aboriginal activist father, Charles Perkins, and mother Eileen.\n\nPerkins embarked on her career journey by moving to Alice Springs at the age of 18, where she initiated her career with a traineeship at the Central Australian Aboriginal Media Association. Her commitment to Indigenous representation in media led her to establish Blackfella Films in 1992. Through this production company, she has played a pivotal role in creating compelling Australian content, particularly focusing on Indigenous stories. Some of her notable works include the films Radiance (1998), One Night the Moon (2001), Bran Nue Dae (2010), and Jasper Jones (2017).\n\nAdditionally, Perkins has served as a Commissioner with the Australian Film Commission and has been a board member of Screen Australia since 2009. Her involvement in Indigenous filmmaking and storytelling extends to her role as the president of the AIATSIS Foundation since 2015, which is affiliated with the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies.\n\nIn 2019, Rachel Perkins delivered the ABC’s annual Boyer Lecture titled ‘The End of Silence’, highlighting her ongoing commitment to amplifying Indigenous voices and narratives in Australian media.\n\nTo read more about Rachel Perkins click here.\n\nTo read more about Albert Namatjira click here.\n\nMichelle Hobbs (Scientist)\n\nMichelle Hobbs, an accomplished Indigenous scientist and Associate Lecturer at Griffith University’s Australian Rivers Institute and School of Environment and Science, has been honored with the 2023 Australian Academy of Science Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Scientist Award. Hailing from the Bidjara heritage in Central Queensland, Michelle is also a dedicated PhD candidate.\n\nHer groundbreaking research is focused on the critical freshwater ecosystems and the preservation of freshwater mussels, particularly emphasizing their cultural significance to Indigenous communities. Recognizing the alarming decline of freshwater mussels, Michelle aims to provide valuable insights that address their conservation and management.\n\nFreshwater mussels, a highly imperiled group of animals, play a crucial role in Indigenous cultures. Michelle acknowledges the limited existing knowledge from Indigenous perspectives and cultural values concerning these creatures. Her project seeks to bridge this gap by exploring the cultural values, uses, and significance of mussels to Indigenous peoples.\n\nMoreover, Michelle’s work challenges current risk assessment methods and resource management practices, which often overlook the cultural aspects of biota and landscapes. Through her research, she aims to elevate Indigenous voices and perspectives in natural resource management.\n\nIn addition to her academic pursuits, Michelle brings years of industry experience as an environmental consultant. She has conducted research on population and community ecology, water quality assessments, and the environmental impacts of mining and water resource development. Her extensive fieldwork experience spans various regions in Australia and abroad, including the Murray-Darling Basin, Western Australia, Queensland, Papua New Guinea, and international locations like the Philippines, Laos, Indonesia, and Canada.\n\nMichelle’s dedication to Indigenous knowledge and environmental conservation has made her a prominent figure in the scientific community, and her efforts are poised to contribute significantly to the preservation of Australian freshwater ecosystems and Indigenous cultural values. Later this year, she plans to collaborate with First Nations researchers in Canada to further explore Indigenous uses and management of mussels, strengthening her research’s global perspective.\n\nFor more information on Michelle Hobbs click here.\n\nPeter Kirby (Paralympian)\n\nPeter Kirby, the accomplished Australian Paralympian, was born around 1964 or 1965 in Bega, New South Wales, to a Wiradjuri father and mother. His family experienced the challenges of indigenous segregation, eventually settling in Eden, New South Wales.\n\nAt the age of 13, Peter faced a life-altering incident when he lost his right hand and forearm due to a tragic accident involving fallen high voltage power lines at the Eden sportsground. Despite this setback, Kirby’s indomitable spirit and athletic prowess persisted.\n\nBefore his accident, he was already a standout athlete in high school. With the guidance of teacher Phil Gould, he adapted his running style to accommodate his amputation.\n\nIn a remarkable display of resilience, at the age of 19, Peter Kirby represented Australia at the 1984 New York Paralympics in five athletics events, earning a total of five medals. Among these, he secured a gold medal in the Men’s 4×100m Relay A4–9 event and a silver in the Men’s 4 x 400m Relay A4–9 event. Additionally, he clinched three bronze medals in the Men’s 100m A6, Men’s 400m A6, and Men’s Long jump A6 events.\n\nNotably, Peter Kirby made history as the first indigenous Australian Paralympian to win a gold medal.\n\nFor more information on Peter Kirby click here.\n\nMandawuy Yunupingi (Singer/Educator)\n\nMandawuy Yunupingu, born as Tom Djambayang Bakamana Yunupingu on September 17, 1956, in Yirrkala, Arnhem Land, was an influential musician and educator. He belonged to the Gumatj people and held the skin name Gudjuk, but later adopted the name Mandawuy in accordance with Yolngu custom. Mandawuy was a member of a renowned Indigenous family, with his father, Munggurrawuy Yunupingu, being a prominent Gumatj clan leader and artist.\n\nIn 1989, Mandawuy Yunupingu took on the role of assistant principal at the Yirrkala Community School, the very school he once attended. He later became the school’s principal and played a pivotal role in the establishment of the Yolngu Action Group and the introduction of the Both Ways system, which combined traditional Aboriginal teaching with Western methods.\n\nIn addition to his educational contributions, Mandawuy was the frontman of the renowned Aboriginal rock group, Yothu Yindi, starting from 1986. The band fused traditional Indigenous music and dance with Western popular music and released several albums, including “Homeland Movement,” “Tribal Voice,” and “Freedom.” Their hit song “Treaty” became a significant anthem for Indigenous rights and reached the top of the charts.\n\nMandawuy Yunupingu’s dedication to Indigenous culture and reconciliation was recognised with numerous awards, including being named Australian of the Year in 1992. He also received an honorary doctorate from the Queensland University of Technology and was posthumously awarded the Companion of the Order of Australia (AC) for his outstanding contributions to the performing arts, education, and social justice for Indigenous people.\n\nMandawuy Yunupingu passed away on June 2, 2013, after a prolonged battle with kidney disease. His legacy lives on through his music, advocacy, and the annual Dr Yunupingu Award for Human Rights, which was established in his honor.\n\nFor more information on Mandawuy Yunupingu click here.\n\nDeborah Mailman (Actor)\n\nDeborah Mailman AM, born in 1972 in Mount Isa, Queensland, is an accomplished actress and singer.

In 1964, she became the founding president of the Council of Aboriginal Women of South Australia, a pivotal role she held until 1973. The Council was instrumental in campaigning for the 1967 Referendum and subsequently evolved into the Aboriginal Council of South Australia in 1973, encompassing men in its mission.\n\nElphick’s legacy is marked by numerous honors and acknowledgments.

His talent was discovered at a junior carnival, leading to his first senior game for Hunter Sports High School. He later moved to Brisbane, attending Wavell State High School and playing for the Northern Suburb Devils.\n\nInglis gained notoriety as a try-scoring phenomenon during his time with the Melbourne feeder club at the age of 17. He joined Melbourne’s full-time roster in 2005, making his NRL debut against the Parramatta Eels in round six. During his rookie season, Inglis showcased his versatility, switching from winger to full-back and continuing to impress.\n\nA defining moment of his rookie season occurred during the finals when he scored the match-winning try as an 18-year-old. This demonstrated his big-game mentality, and he was duly awarded the Dally M Rookie of the Year medal for his outstanding 2005 season.\n\nInglis went on to have a stellar career, making a significant impact in various positions such as full-back, centre, and stand-off. His powerful and creative style of play earned him recognition both nationally and internationally. He represented Queensland in State of Origin from 2006, becoming a vital part of their success.

Hailing from the Plangermaireener clan in the Ben Lomond tribal area of north-eastern Tasmania, Mannalargenna stood at 5′ 8″ and was known for wearing grease and red ochre over his entire body. He rose to prominence during the tumultuous period known as the Black War when British settlers arrived in Van Diemen’s Land (now Tasmania).\n\nMannalargenna played a pivotal role in leading guerrilla-style attacks against the British settlers. His notable act of defiance occurred in 1829 when he freed five of his people, including four women and a boy, who were held captive in John Batman’s house for a year.\n\nWhile it appears he briefly joined George Robinson’s mission aimed at convincing Indigenous people to “surrender,” Mannalargenna may have been strategically guiding Robinson away from his people. Despite promises that he would not be sent to Flinders Island, those promises were broken, and he ultimately passed away in captivity at Wybalenna in 1835. Before arriving at Big Green Island, he symbolically cut off his ochred hair and beard.\n\nMannalargenna had two wives and several children. His legacy lives on, with descendants like his five times great-grandson, Uncle Jack Charles. Today, Mannalergenna Day is celebrated in Little Musselroe Bay to honor his memory and Parlevar culture. A monument stands in his memory at the Wybalenna Mission Site Cemetery, and a sketch of Mannalargenna by artist Thomas Bock is preserved in the British Museum in London, England.\n\nTo learn more about Mannalargenna click here.\n\nEleanor Harding (Civil rights activist)\n\nEleanor Harding (1934-1996) was an influential political activist born on Erub Island in the Torres Strait.

Throughout her life, she had seven children with various partners, with each child taking her partner’s surname.\n\nHarding played a pivotal role in advocating for civil rights and equality for Indigenous Australians. She was part of the movement that successfully lobbied for the passage of the historic 1967 Aboriginal Australian Referendum, amending the Australian Constitution and paving the way for significant legislation addressing Indigenous rights.\n\nShe was also actively involved in women’s issues and protested against the hardships faced by women and Indigenous communities due to colonialism. In the 1970s, she supported victims of domestic violence and encouraged her children to pursue higher education.\n\nThroughout her life, Harding served on the boards of the Victorian Aboriginal Legal Service and the Victorian Aboriginal Health Service. She was a driving force behind the Margaret Tucker Hostel, providing safe housing for young, homeless, Aboriginal women.\n\nHarding passed away in Melbourne in 1996 and was laid to rest on Darnley Island.
