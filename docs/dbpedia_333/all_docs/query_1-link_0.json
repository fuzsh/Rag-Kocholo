But we are working on it. Thank you for your understanding.\n\n13/14\n\nOverall\n\nTries in italic are tries without conversion, these tries are usually scored between the posts and do not require conversion to speed up the game. This rule was introduced in MLR in 2022 and these tries are worth 7 points."
