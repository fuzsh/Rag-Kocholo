        "text": "TV presenter Nathan Templeton has tragically been found dead by a river after suffering what's believed to be a \"medical episode\" while out walking his dog.\n\nNathan was known for presenting the Australian morning news show Sunrise on Channel 7, with his body being discovered on a walking track near the Barwon River in Australia on Tuesday (9 April) afternoon.\n\nA statement from his family reads: \"Our hearts are broken for an adoring father and a wonderful friend, who’ll be missed by many.\" Nathan is survived by his wife, Kate Coghlan, and two sons, Jack, five, and James, four.\n\nThe father-of-two shared a number of happy pictures to Instagram with his wife and children just a week before his passing, celebrating Easter as he dubbed it his 'favourite day of the year'. He often gushed over his wife and children on social media.\n\nManaging Director of Seven Melbourne Lewis Martin also paid tribute to the ‘respected journalist' with an email to his former colleagues, sharing his condolences.\n\nWriting on his most recent Instagram post, presenter Candice Wyatt expressed her sadness over the loss. She wrote: \"My Chucky.. we were inseparable for a long period of time and I’m holding tight to those memories today. I hope your beautiful boys grow up knowing how funny, kind, smart and witty their Dad was. You were one in a trillion. Thank you for always making my life crazier. I’ll miss you so much.\"\n\nNathan also became a recognisable face for his coverage at the Olympics in Rio and Tokyo, the 2018 Commonwealth Games, and various other Australian sports events.\n\nMayor of Perth and former colleague Basil Zempilas shared a photo from their coverage of the Gold Coast Commonwealth Games in 2018. \"This is how I'll remember Nathan. Always happy, so reliable, incredibly hard-working and just so good to have on the team,' he wrote.\n\n\"He was team first. Always. That smile made everyone smile, his colleagues, his friends, the athletes, the audience. We'll miss you little mate, my deepest condolences to Kate and the boys - your dad was a champion, we'll never forget him. Former journalist Hamish Jones said he was one 'one of the nicest guys in television news you could hope to meet\".\n\nWhile broadcaster Jim Wilson said he was ‘deeply saddened’ to hear the news, writing to X: \"Deeply saddened at the passing of a man who I admired and respected enormously. Nathan Templeton was truly one of the best people I’ve worked with and thoughts with his family and loved ones.\""
