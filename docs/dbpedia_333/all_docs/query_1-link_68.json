        "text": "Martin Haag's Championship outfit may have been outdone by the pace, power and class of the side who will join the likes of New Zealand and Argentina in Pool C of next month's competition, but they certainly played their part in an entertaining encounter.\n\nIt was a great occasion and a real coup for Nottingham Rugby to face such illustrious opponents, but there was a serious element to the showpiece game.\n\nThe Greens are just over a week away from beginning their Championship campaign away to the Cornish Pirates next Sunday and this will be seen as an ideal final competitive warm-up for that clash.\n\nIt took just two minutes for Tonga to take the lead with the first try. Nottingham's pack had started well, but a quick break from Telusa Veainu saw him evade a couple of challenges before going over for the try.\n\nLatiume Fosita scored the conversion to give his side a seven point lead and showed just what a task was ahead of Haag's men, but it was one they were to embrace and take head on.\n\nDespite their dogged determination, Nottingham couldn't halt the Tongan charge and they scored their second try on the ten minute mark through Opeti Fonua converted by Fosita.\n\nThe healthy Lady Bay crowd were starting to get into the game, trying to encourage their side forward and the Greens almost did when Dan Mugford's kick forward down the left just bounced out of play as the home side looked to press for the first time. Haag's men were showing character and were growing into the occasion as the half wore on.\n\nThey bared their teeth for the first time with a flowing move, but were allowed no further than the 22 line by the visitors, who were posing a formidable threat.\n\nTonga were showing their class with some sheer power, switching the play from left to right with ease and they scored their third try halfway through the first half through William Helu.\n\nThe speed of their ball movement was just too much for the Greens and on the overlap the winger went over for the try in the far corner. Fosita's first blot on the copybook was his conversion that dropped well short of the posts.\n\nHaag's men pressed forward in reply and after two penalties deep into Tongan territory, they were awarded a much deserved penalty try. Tongan prop Soane Tongauhia was given a yellow card for doing his best to prevent the try\n\nDan Mugford's early replacement Lawrence Rayner had the straightforward task of adding the conversion and the home side had their first points of the game.\n\nNottingham's incessant pressure very nearly yielded a second try in a matter of moments, but Mugford's twist and turn onto the line was thwarted by the post and the referee pulled play back for a scrum giving Tonga the chance to clear.\n\nFor all of Nottingham's courage and at times probing and exciting play, the Polynesian outfit hit back right on half-time as Fonua grabbed his second after a period of heavy pressure with Fosita adding the extras.\n\nTonga added their fourth try just minutes into the second half through Siale Piutau, another fine example of their class â€“ with Fosita converting to make it 33-7.\n\nAfter a relative lull in proceedings, replacement Rupert Cooper was sent to the sin bin and the visitors took full advantage with their fifth try as Fonua chalked up his third.\n\nNottingham were starting to look tired and Tonga scored again through the impressive Fonua. Tonga's fitness really was showing and they made added another converted try through Helu after a swift offload by Sonatone Takulua making the score 57-7 in favour of Tonga.\n\nNottingham fought back, showing their character and got themselves a second try of the game through Josh Skelcey. Having offloaded well moving from left to right, Skelcey sidestepped inside his marker to go over. Rayner converted to give the scoreboard a slightly better look at 57-14 before Takulua waltzed through for a converted try.\n\nTonga scored another fine try against what was now a tired Nottingham, and look in fine shape ahead of their opening World Cup Pool C clash against Georgia on September 19.\n\nNottingham Rugby: 15.
