With two LV= Cup games to follow then two more PRO12 matches, it's a crucial time of the season and it's important that the work we've done in preparing for this period bears fruit.\n\n“Last season's title success was driven by the core group of players who were around in the international periods, who got that great six game winning start to the season to put us in a great position, beat a full strength Munster in November and kept things going in February. We need these players to step up to the mark in the same way.\n\n“It's a great opportunity for guys coming in and show that they are good enough to be Ospreys. It's at times like this that players such as Justin Tipuric, Ryan Bevington and Ashley Beck have excelled in recent seasons and they've used it to kick on and establish themselves with both their region and their country. We'll be expecting some of the players involved this month to have a similar impact so it's exciting as coaches and players, and I'd expect our supporters to feel the same.\n\n“We know that Leinster may have an unfamiliar look to their team this weekend but we also know that as European champions they have real strength in depth and whatever players wear their shirt we will be in for a real test.”\n\nMeanwhile, Andrew Goodman will make his debut for Leinster at inside centre in a team which shows wholesale changes from the side which defeated the Cardiff Blues last weekend.\n\nDavid Kearney is one of only two player who remain in the backline and he moves to full-back with Andrew Conway and Fionn Carr named on the wings.\n\nIreland scrum-half Isaac Boss (who makes his 55th appearance) partners Ian Madigan at in the half backs, with the latter shifting from full-back where he has featured in recent weeks.\n\nShane Jennings leads the team and he is named in the back-row alongside number eight Leo Auva'a and Rhys Ruddock who made his first senior appearance this season in last weekend's Round 7 fixture.\n\nDamian Browne partners Devin Toner, who is set to make his 107th appearance for his home province.\n\nThe replacements bench comprises completely of Leinster Academy products.\n\nForm: Last season's RaboDirect PRO12 finalists meet at Liberty Stadium.
