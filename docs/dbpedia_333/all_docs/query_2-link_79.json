        "text": "Richard’s parents have not been identified, but he could have been related to ‘Big Pete’ Dukelow. Legend has it that he was the biggest man in the county at 7’6″. He supposedly had one or two brothers and Richard could be descended from one of these.\n\nLooking at the incidence of certain names in the family tree, it is suspected that Richard’s birthplace was Durrus, which is located about 7 miles from Bantry Bay in County Cork.\n\nIn the Tithe Applotment for the Durrus Tithe for 16th November 1830 two Richard Dukelows are mentioned: one in Droumatinahine and one in Rossmore. In Crotties there was also a Charles, Peter, James and Robert Dukelow and a Thomas in Classadoo.\n\nAs regards the identity of Richard’s wife, three names have cropped up in research. According to the Irish Records Extraction Database at Ancestry.com, a Richard Dukelow married a Catherine King in the Diocese of Cork and Ross, Co Cork in 1814. A Richard Duclow married a Sarah Williamson in 1830 also in the Diocese of Cork & Ross, Co Cork. Another possibility was Avis Shannon who married a Richard Dukelow. The main contender appears to be Catherine King. The marriage to Sarah Williamson is rather late and Avis Shannon was later found in the US in the 1860 census, so they are less likely.\n\nIn terms of occupation, he is named as a labourer on his son’s marriage certificate (1859), but it is not stated whether this was an agricultural or industrial labourer. The strongest evidence is that he was an agricultural labourer, as his son or grandson, John Dukelow, is reported to have scared crows off the crops as a boy for a penny. On his daughter’s marriage certificate (1861) his occupation is a butcher. It is possible he was a tenant farmer to begin with and then left the land during the potato famines in the 1840’s. By this time, Richard and his wife appear to have had at least 3 children: John was born first in around 1828. Peter was born between 1832 and 1834 and Mary followed in around 1834. There may have also been an Anne, born around 1840.\n\nThe Potato Famine\n\nLocal failures of the potato crop had occurred regularly since the 1700s. There had been ‘minor’ famines in 1817 and 1822 and the possibility of another failure in 1845 caused no particular alarm. In fact, at the beginning of July of that year, the crop promised to be a bumper one. However, the first news that the blight which had recently ravaged the North American potato crop had crossed the Atlantic came from the Isle of Wight, where disease had appeared.\n\nSuddenly, every plant died and, soon afterward, all over Ireland people were dying by the thousand. The situation was exacerbated by another failure in 1846. Starvation was soon followed by disease. Some people were said to die by the fences and about 40 dead persons were reputedly eaten by dogs in Durrus. Cart loads of corpses were buried in mass graves.\n\nBefore the potato failure, to leave Ireland had been regarded as the most terrible of fates, but now the people began to flee en masse. It is estimated that a total of a million emigrants went to North America. By the 1840’s as a direct result of the famine half of all immigrants to the United States originated from Ireland. Many of these immigrants went to the largest cities, especially Boston and New York City, as well as Chicago, San Francisco, Hartford, Albany, Philadelphia and Detroit. Even today, many of these cities still retain a substantial Irish-American community while New York City still has more people who claim Irish heritage than Dublin’s whole population. These cities became the conduit through which Irish, both Protestant and Catholic entered American society.\n\nHowever, there was an even larger emigration across the Irish Channel to Great Britain, to Liverpool, Glasgow and the ports of South Wales. There is one story of a ship arriving in Newport, Wales and a great debate raging as to whether the Irish should be allowed ashore as they would spread pestilence throughout Britain.\n\nBy February 1848 there were 191residents from Durrus in the Bantry Workhouse. Pre famine the population was 3731 in 1841. By 1851 it had dropped to 2003. The number of houses went from 595 to 324.\n\nIreland’s Valuation office conducted its first survey of property ownership in Ireland from 1848 to 1864. This survey became known as “Griffiths Valuation” after Richard Griffith who was the director of the office at that time. The survey was used to determine the amount of tax each person should pay towards the support of the poor within their poor law union. This involved determining the value of all privately held lands and buildings in rural as well as urban areas to figure the rate at which each unit of property could be rented year after year. The resulting survey was arranged by barony and civil parish with an index to the townlands appearing in each volume. Griffith’s Valuation can be used as an excellent census substitute for the years after the Great Famine as censuses prior to 1901 were destroyed.\n\nIn the Griffiths Report of 1850-1852, there is only one Richard Dukelow in Carrigboy alongside an Avesia Dukelow who may have been a sister or mother. Incidentally, the name Avesia is repeated amongst the Dukelows of Durrus.\n\nInspection of the Irish Reproductive Loan Fund Records reveals that this Richard had fallen on hard times. The Irish Reproductive Loan Fund was a micro credit scheme set up in 1824 to provide small loans to the ‘industrious poor’. Local associations and committees administered the scheme, most often from a small town in a rural area, and county committees oversaw their work. The records of the local associations and county committees are in the The National Archives and cover the years 1824 to 1846 for county Cork. As well as the notes of security for the loans, there are loan ledgers, repayment books and defaulters’ books. The minimum information supplied is address and occupation, but much additional detail is often given in the local association records, including notes on health, family circumstances and emigration. A Richard Dukelow is mentioned. He borrowed 2 pounds on 23rd March 1846. It was secured by Michael Baker of Cruttees, John Dukelow of Aghagouma and Michael Hurley of Ballycomane. It is interesting to note that the Hurley (or Hurely /Herley) family crop up later alongside the Dukelows in Well Street, Poplar, Middlesex, England in the 1861 census. By 26th November 1849, Richard had paid off 14 shillings of the loan, still owed 1pound and 6 shillings and owed interest of 2d. The Constable in charge of administering the loans was called upon to find out his circumstances and Richard appears not to have been in a position to repay the loan. Records state that “He did reside here (in Cruttees) Being poor man Resides at present in Carrigboy being poorly circumstances”. At the some time, others on the same sheet were heading to America and were poor farmers.\n\nIt is interesting to note that John Dukelow, a shoemaker of Aghagouna also borrowed 2 pounds on 26th October 1846 which was secured by Charles Dukelow and Timothy Daly of Rossmore. By 26th November 1849, he had paid 8s. He lived in Aghagouna on both dates according to the records. Maybe Richard and John were brothers.\n\nOther Dukelows mentioned in the Griffiths Valuation for Cork are:\n\nDukelow Peter Dromreagh Durrus Cork\n\nDukelow Peter Arderrawinny Skull Cork\n\nDukelow Mary Rossmore Durrus Cork\n\nDukelow Thomas Clashadoo Durrus Cork\n\nDukelow Thomas Ballydehob Skull Cork\n\nDukelow William Brahalish Durrus Cork\n\nDukelow John Clashadoo Durrus Cork\n\nDukelow Charles Crottees Durrus Cork\n\nDukelow Charles Coomkeen Durrus Cork\n\nDukelow Charles Dromataniheen Durrus Cork\n\nDukelow Charles Dromataniheen Durrus Cork\n\nDukelow Charles Rusgeenaniska Durrus Cork\n\n2 Jason Dukelows Crottees Durrus Cork\n\nIt is highly likely that some of these are Richard’s relatives.\n\nAfter 5 or 6 generations in Ireland, the potato famines prompted the Dukelows to migrate for a second time. In the 1820/1830/1840 US Federal census there were no Dukelows, but, by the time of the 1850 census, there were two: one in Wisconsin and one in Monroe, New York. From 1860 onwards their numbers in the US swelled.\n\nOf the 22 Dukelows in the 1860 US Federal census, one family of seven lived in New York, one family of three in Middlesex, one lived in Queens (aged 17) and eleven Dukelows lived in Calumet. In the 1870 US census there were 37 Dukelows and in the 1880 census there were over 100. Their birthplaces varied, but were mostly Canada, Ireland and just three from England.\n\nThe details of Richard’s life and his exact fate may never be known, but there may be some clues in the records available. No Richard Dukelows were uncovered in the 1841, 1851, 1861 or 1871 census in England or 1841 and 1851 census for Wales, Scotland and Channel Islands. There are none in the 1840 US Federal Census or in the 1851 census of East and West Canada, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. There is a Richard Dukelow born approximately 1833, living in Wankesha, Wisconsin in the 1850 USA Federal census. He was working as a labourer on a farm, but he is too young to be relevant. All the evidence points to him remaining in Ireland. He may well have died impoverished and be one of the millions buried in mass graves during the height of the famine. No matching gravestone or death record has been uncovered anywhere.\n\nRichard’s Sons\n\nHis children were definitely part of the exodus from Ireland. By the 1850’s they had migrated to the British Isles.\n\nThe trip to the UK was the flight of the very poor that could not raise enough money for a passage to the States or Canada. Crossing to Great Britain was a familiar experience for thousands of Irish, thanks to seasonal harvest work and the demand for labour associated with the Industrial Revolution. Large Irish communities had been established in the cities thanks to the labourers (navvies) who had gone over to dig docks and canals and to work in mills and factories. They provided cheap labour and were often used for strike breaking. In addition, the conclusion of various colonial campaigns meant large numbers of Irish soldiers were discharged onto the frequently unwelcoming streets of London. There were regular services of steamers on a daily basis between Liverpool and Cork.\n\nRichard’s children are thought to have entered Britain through the ports of South Wales, as his grandson, John, is known to have worked there for many years. From Wales, many Irish spread over England and Wales, afraid of returning to starvation. Chepstow and Cheltenham on the English border were invaded by the Irish in particular.\n\nThe brothers may well have arrived in London around 1852 when the Poplar Docks were opened, followed by the Royal Victoria Docks in 1855. As a large part of the workforce simply required brute strength to fetch and carry goods, employment was open to anyone, and the poor immigrants from Ireland provided cheap labour.\n\nTheir living conditions were awful. Because of London’s high cost of living, several Irish families frequently shared a single room, and when this overcrowding was combined with primitive sewage arrangements, poor ventilation, and few opportunities for washing of either bodies or clothes, the mortality rate among London’s Irish population rose to frightening levels.\n\nBy 1859, Richard’s two sons, Peter and John, had found their way to London, and were living amongst these Irish migrants. I am sure they would have already known many from home. Peter married Hannah Collins in 1859 and John was a witness. At the time of the 1861 census, John was lodging with his Poplar-born wife, Mary, next door to his brother at 9 Well Street, Poplar. Their surname appears as Dupelow. They were both working as dock labourers.\n\nIt is evident from Peter’s marriage certificate that neither of them could read nor write. This was the norm at the time. The percentage of males who could read and write in the 1841 Census for Durrus was between 15 and 19%.\n\nHaving survived the famines, it must have come as a shock when John Dukelow died suddenly on 10th August 1866 whilst he was living at 4 Providence Place, Poplar, which was very close to Well Street. He had contracted cholera, which he had had for 23 hours. There was a major cholera epidemic in London July to October 1866. This followed epidemics in 1832, 1848-49, and 1853-4. Thinking that the disease was spread by the inhalation of invisible noxious gases emitted by excrement and rotting waste, sanitary reformers tried to prevent the spread of cholera by flushing sewers and washing down streets to eliminate the disease. Cholera is primarily water-borne, and the first effect of the cleansing was to make the 1848-49 epidemics even worse than that of 1832. The distribution of deaths in successive cholera epidemics reflected the cleanliness of the water supply in different parts of London and, in 1866, only Poplar was affected with a death rate of 81-160 deaths per 10,000 inhabitants.\n\nRepublicanism\n\nIt is possible that the Dukelows were sympathetic to the ideals of Irish Republicanism. This is based on various pieces of evidence. Firstly, they originated from an area which was the heartland of the Fenian movement. The Fenians were members of the so-called Fenian movement in Ireland and elsewhere, though primarily America and England. They wanted one simple desire for Ireland – independence from British rule. The Great Famine had a massive impact on Ireland. Some in Ireland believed that the government in London – to solve the ‘Irish Problem’ – had deliberately done as little as possible to aid the people of Ireland – a form of genocide – and these people concluded that the only hope Ireland had for its future was a complete separation from Great Britain. If London was unwilling to grant this, then the Fenians would fight for it.\n\nAnger against the British government spilled over in 1848. In this year a group of revolutionaries known as Young Ireland launched an uprising against the government. It was a failure. One member of Young Ireland went onto form the secret society that became known as the Irish Republican Brotherhood. Its aim was independence for Ireland. Another went to American and became the leader of a new organisation called the Fenian Brotherhood. It took its name from the Fianna who were a band of Irish warriors of the 2nd and 3rd centuries. The name ‘Fenians’ became an umbrella term to cover all the groups associated with wanting independence for Ireland. By the very nature of what they wanted, those elements within the Fenian movement who were prepared to use violence to advance their cause had to remain secret.\n\nThere was an attempted uprising in 1867, though it was a failure. The ‘uprising’ was led by Thomas Kelly who had fought in the American Civil War. Kelly did not base himself in Ireland but in London. Here he gained support from the large Irish community that had come to the city during the Great Famine. In December 1867, several Londoners were killed when a bomb planted by the Fenians exploded at Clerkenwell Prison. This caused a wave of anti-Irish feeling in London and elsewhere in England.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the Dukelows in England are known to have associated with and married into nationalist families such as the Santrys and Swantons. This repeated intertwining of Cork families naturally assumes a common political standpoint. John Dukelow’s death was notified by a Margaret Sawtry/Santry of 51 Wells Street, Poplar. Michael Collins, who played a pivotal role in Irish affairs, leading to the treaty of 1921 that gave Ireland dominion status within the British Empire, was introduced to these ideals by an Irish village blacksmith by the name of James Santry. His background indicates that he could even be related distantly to family member Hannah Collins, wife of Peter Dukelow (stevedore) mentioned later. Generations of Dukelows and Swantons had intermarried in Ireland and would continue to do so in London. In the 1871 census a Mary Santry was found lodging with the Swantons who were known to have strong associations with the Irish Brigade, a nationalist group that pre-dated the famine and supplied manpower for many conflicts with Britain such as the American civil war.\n\nAcross the Atlantic and in spite of their protestant outlook, Dukelows who immigrated to America are known to have been instrumental in forming an Irish political group in New York called ’99 cousins’. This group was the subject of a newspaper article in Rochester, New York and identified strongly with the historic Catholic experience, the nationalist political agenda, and possibly the more militant republican agenda.\n\nThe most compelling piece of evidence comes directly from Richard Dukelow’s grandson, Peter, who scribed some notes on The Committee of Spanish Bondholders letterhead at the beginning of the 1900s. They talk of the Irish Brigade and a peasant called Thomas Parr. The reason for these historical notes is unclear, but suggest an interest in Irish history and the plight of the poor and oppressed. His reference to the Treaty of Limerick and the end of the Irish resistance to William III displays pro-Irish nationalist sympathies. In this regard, he would not have been alone, Irish poet W B Yeats was protestant and also a member of the Irish Republican Brotherhood, a secret oath-bound military organization devoted to achieving an independent Ireland. Peter can hardly be blamed for any pro-independence leanings as the Great Famine would have left deep scars in his family. No doubt, as a young boy he would have heard about the misery of the famine and been familiar with such songs as ‘Black ’47’, named after the most severe year of the famine.\n\nThe deaths, the misery, rural depopulation, indifference of the British government and the near-extinction of the Irish culture and language, made the Great Famine undisputedly a pivot point in the history of Ireland and the Dukelow family.\n\nIn 1937 the National Schools in Ireland asked the children to collect local folklore rom the older people in the area, the results are in the University College Dublin archives and some are on line, included are the following contributions from Kathleen, Sarah, Winnie and Annie Dukelow from Durrus.\n\nTakes a little while to open.\n\nDukelow School Folklore Collection 1937\n\ndiscussion about George Nicholson under post “Elizabeth Nicholson’s Family.]"
