        "text": "After careful consideration, we are thrilled to reveal all the winners of the 2023 Booooooom Photo Awards, supported by Format. This year’s call for submissions brought in an unprecedented number of entries, making the selection process both rewarding and challenging for our team. We extend our heartfelt gratitude to all participants for sharing their photos with us—it’s evident from the entries how much talent and creativity abounds in our community.\n\nWe are pleased to announce five winners, each representing a distinct category: PORTRAIT, STREET, SHADOWS, COLOUR, NATURE. Each winner is awarded a $1,000 USD cash prize, editorial and social coverage, and will be featured in our print publication. In addition to the five winners, we’ve included 20 shortlisted photographers (four from each category) whose work will be showcased in the publication as well. This year we’re also sharing all the names included on our longlist—a selection representing 250 of our favourite images—an extremely small portion of the work we received this year. If you want to be the first to know about our next photo awards, you can pre-register below:\n\nPre-Register for 2024 Photo Awards\n\nHuge thank you to Format who helped make these awards possible.
