        "text": "http://www.irishrugby.ie/283_20501.php\n\nPBC Cork prop Niall Scannell, who captained the Ireland Schools team to a 60-3 win over Italy in December, will again lead the side as they look to get the tournament off to a winning start.\n\nScannell was a member of the Irish squad that secured wins over Wales (22-15) and Italy (29-3) in last year's U-18 Festival in Parma. Fellow front rower Rory Harrison, winger Sam Coghlan Murray, scrum half Harry Doyle and lock Shane Buckley are also back from twelve months ago.\n\nEncouragingly, out of last year's Irish Schools panel, Andrew Conway, Tiernan O'Halloran, Brendan Macken, Jamies McKinney, Gareth Quinn McDonogh, Niall Annett, David Doyle and Jordi Murphy have all gone on to be part of Ireland's recent Six Nations Championship-winning Under-20 squad.\n\nThe 2010 Schools squad boasts representatives from all four of the recently-crowned provincial Schools Cup champions - Clongowes Wood, Presentation Brothers College, Cork, Ballymena Academy and Colaiste Iognaid.\n\nHead coach Terry McMaster has opted to stick with the same back-line that impressed against Italy in Donnybrook four months ago, with Peter Nelson and JJ Hanrahan combining in the centre and Paddy Jackson and Luke McGrath teamed together at half-back.\n\nThe all-Munster second row partnership of Yasin Browne and Shane Buckley has been retained, as well as the exciting back row trio of Adam Clarkin, Aaron Conneely and Daniel Qualter.\n\nIRELAND UNDER-18 SCHOOLS Team & Replacements (v Wales Under-18s, U-18 Five Nations Festival, Llandovery RFC, Wales, Friday, April 2, kick-off 2pm):\n\n15.

Shane Buckley (Rockwell College)\n\n6. Adam Clarkin (Terenure College)\n\n7. Aaron Conneely (Colaiste Iognaid)\n\n8.

Generally at u18 level Ireland are smaller physically than their opponents and don't tend to catch up until they're 20 or 21 years old. It may be a couple of years before they show their true potential.\n\nFrom the Irish Times\n\nWales 24 Ireland 18 : IT WOULD be so tempting for one filled with patriotic zeal to concentrate on a remarkable Irish fightback in the opening match of the Under-18 Five Nations Festival at Llandovery, in Wales, yesterday.\n\nThat would be to overlook the chasm that existed between these sides for all but the last five minutes. In that narrow window, Ireland managed what they couldn't all game, get workable front foot ball in dangerous areas. Outhalf Patrick Jackson and inside centre JJ Hanrahan showed the benefit of crisp passing to put replacement Conor Gilsenan through for a gallop to the line.\n\nOne minute later, wing Sam Coghlan-Murray and fullback Charlie Simpson fixed subsequent defenders to find replacement wing Mark Corballis in enough space to make it tell. Although Jackson was inches wide with the conversion it was now, incredibly, a three-point match – 21-18 – despite the domination of Wales for the greater part of an hour.\n\nOther than two penalties from Jackson, at the start of each half, Wales held all the aces in the physicality of their pack, the playmaking of outhalf Matthew Morgan and the power running of centre George North, who started the scoreboard rolling with a hard line on to Morgan's flat pass in the 15th minute. It could have been far worse, Tom Prydie dropping the ball with the line beckoning. The Welsh scrum was impregnable, the reward for their work located in a try by loosehead Rob Evans, Morgan's conversion making it 14-3 on the stroke of half-time.\n\nWales owned the ball, if not quite all the territory, as Jackson sent them into retreat whenever the ball came loose, managing to pick off another penalty in the process. Then, North crossed for his second try in the 50th minute, Morgan dissecting the posts for a 21-6 lead. It looked all over bar the shouting before Ireland rallied.\n\nWALES: T Prydie; H Robinson, G North, L Williams, S Campbell; M Morgan, A Davies; R Evans, J Dando, S Lee, C Hill, L Hamilton, O Sheppeard, T Young (capt), D Baker. Replacements: E Jenkins for Sheppeard, C Thomas for Young (both 44 mins); D Harris for Evans, W Jones for Lee (both 53 mins); J Griffen for Morgan (57 mins); L Bellamore for Casmpbell (60 mins); M Screech for Hamilton (63 mins).\n\nIRELAND: C Simpson (Ballymena); S MacAuley (Clongowes Wood), P Nelson (Royal, Dungannon), JJ Hanrahan (Rockwell), S Coghlan-Murray (Newbridge); P Jackson (Methodist), L McGrath (St Michael's); R Harrison (Methodist), J Rael (Castletroy), N Scannell (PBC Cork, capt), Y Browne (CBC Cork), S Buckley (Rockwell), A Clarkin (Terenure), A Conneely (Colaiste Iognaid), D Qualter (Sligo Grammar). Replacements: K McCall (Wallace High) for Rael halftime; C Gilsenan (Clongowes Wood) for Conneely 37 mins; M Corballis (St Michael's) for MacAuley, J Conan (St Gerard's) for Buckley both 46 mins.\n\nReferee: L Pearce (England).\n\nIRELAND UNDER-18 SCHOOLS 17 ENGLAND UNDER-18 41, Llandovery RFC\n\nScorers: Ireland: Try: Niall Scannell; Pens: Paddy Jackson 3; Drop: Cathal Marsh\n\nWales: Tries: Koree Britton, Charlie Walker, Chris Walker, Elliot Daly, George Ford, Ben Ransom; Cons: George Ford 4; Pen: George Ford\n\nIt never pays to play the poor mouth these days. Ireland has learned to thrive in an environment where their resources are a fraction of those enjoyed by the larger nations.\n\nHowever, the sheer physical size and volume of the players on offer to England made this a boys-versus-men encounter.\n\nThe Irish pack was working against a 55 kilos concession in weight - that is 17 stones in old money. This included the presence of 127 kilos, or 20 stones, blindside flanker in Billy Vunipola.\n\nEngland were driven by the internal goal to achieve an Under-18 Grand Slam, having already beaten France (33-16), Italy (28-12), Wales (43-22) and Scotland (29-9) this season, as well as a 30-28 victory over Australian Schools in December.\n\nImmediately, lock Shane Buckley was pinged for going off his feet at the first ruck. England out-half George Ford, the son of former Ireland defence coach Mike Ford, booted it home for a first minute lead.\n\nStraight away, swift lineout ball from Conor Gilsenan at the tail and Paddy Jackson's strong line onto the ball drew a penalty for hands in the ruck by openside flanker Chris Walker. Jackson tied it up from in front of the posts.\n\nThen, Ford's inch perfect diagonal kick forced a lineout from which hooker Koree Britton eventually barrelled to the line for Ford to convert in the sixth minute.\n\nStill, the signals were so much better for Ireland than in the first game against Wales. The Irish scavenged manically at the breakdown.\n\nFull-back Ross Jones countered from a poor clearance at the end of which out-half Cathal Marsh stroked over a drop goal.\n\nThe danger for Ireland came when England were able to get a foothold in their half and go through their well-practiced moves.\n\nFrom one, the back-line opened the door for left winger Charlie Walker to be the extra man out wide for their second try and a 15-6 advantage.\n\nWhen Irish captain Niall Scannell was jerked back after coming through the middle of a ruck to hack the ball on, Jackson nailed his third penalty in the 26th minute.\n\nThe swarming Irish were there to earn a penalty for holding on when England full-back Ben Ransom tried to run from deep. Jackson was on the mark from the right on the half-hour mark.\n\nIf Ireland could hold out until the break they would be in good nick, even into the teeth of the wind. But this was a scenario that unfortunately did not play out.\n\nA wheeled scrum led to lost ball and an England lineout five metres out. They were able to engineer a drive for number 7 Walker to touch down to make it 20-12 at the interval.\n\nOut-half Marsh's perfect pass set Ireland alight, Sam Coghlan Murray beating his man only to go himself instead of making use of the unopposed Mark Corballis. It was so near and yet so far.\n\nThey came again. The handling was a delight. The Irish were oozing football, keeping it simple, moving the ball away from England's heavy hitters and into the open spaces. They just needed a try. It did not come.\n\nFord's precise kick forced Ireland into the concession of a lineout close to their line. When the catch and drive did notwork, the out-half's side door pass was taken home by centre Elliot Daly. Ford's conversion made it 27-12 in the 50th minute.\n\nIt was starting to look one-sided. Ford got the better of his opposite number Marsh for their fifth try which he also converted.\n\nThen, full-back Ben Ransom had the wheels to take advantage of a slip in concentration from the Irish, with Ford again adding the extras.\n\nEncouragingly, the Irish never stopped dipping their shoulders into the tackle and they got a semblance of reward for their application when Coghlan Murray sparked a last-minute attack.\n\nReplacement JJ Hanrahan's accurate diagonal kick was caught and touched down by skipper Scannell to end the match on a positive note.\n\nIreland: R Jones (Castleknock); M Corballis (St Michael's), P Nelson (Royal, Dungannon), P Jackson (Methodist), S Coghlan-Murray (Newbridge); C Marsh (St Michael's), L McGrath (St Michael's); R Harrison (Methodist), N Scannell (PBC Cork, capt), K McCall (Wallace High), J Conan (St Gerard's), S Buckley (Rockwell), A Conneely (Colaiste Iognaid), C Gilsenan (Clongowes Wood), D Qualter (Sligo Grammar).\n\nReplacements: P Reilly (Castleknock) for McCall 22 mins – temp & 50 mins; D Merrey (King's Hospital) for Harrison ht; S MacAuley (Clongowes Wood) for Corballis 55 mins; Harrison for Merrey 55 mins; JJ Hanrahan (Rockwell) for Nelson 60 mins; E Cross (Crescent) for Conneely 66 mins; R McMaster (Coleraine AI) for Marsh, H Doyle (Royal, Armagh) for McGrath both 67 mins.\n\nEngland: B Ransom; M Yarde, E Daly, R Mills, Charlie Walker; G Ford (capt), J Hodgson; N Auterac, K Britton, A Brennan, D Barrow, S Twomey, B Vunipola, Chris Walker, M Kvesic.\n\nReplacements: D Robson for Hodgson 40 mins; W Skuse for Chris Walker, K Sinckler for Brennan both 43 mins; M Jennings for Yarde 55 mins; J Elliot for Daly 59 mins; N Morris for Britton, G Merrick for Twomey both 61 mins.\n\nReferee: C Williams, Wales."
