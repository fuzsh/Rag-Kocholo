Protosevich was born in Chicago, Illinois and studied Film at Columbia College Chicago. After graduating with honors, he spent four years teaching beginning film production courses at Columbia College and then moved to Los Angeles, where he began his motion picture career as a story analyst for producer Scott Rudin.

He worked as a development executive for Orion Pictures, producer Dawn Steel, and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, and then made his first spec screenplay sale (for THE CELL). Protosevich happily left the world of the “suits” behind and has ever since been doing what he always dreamed of doing for a living: writing screenplays.
