        "text": "Biography\n\nMark Protosevich is an American screenwriter. He is best known for his screenplays for the films The Cell, Thor and I Am Legend. He has also written two remakes: Poseidon, an update of The Poseidon Adventure for director Wolfgang Petersen, and Oldboy, an adaptation of the South Korean film of the same name for Spike Lee.\n\nProtosevich wrote the script for the unproduced Batman Unchained, a mooted third film in the superhero franchise to be directed by Joel Schumacher. In 2011, Steven Spielberg met with Protosevich to discuss story ideas for a fourth film in the Jurassic Park franchise.\n\nProtosevich wrote two story treatments for the film, neither of which were produced. He recently created the Apple TV+ series Sugar, his first foray into television. He wrote or co-wrote the majority of the episodes, as well as serving as executive producer."
