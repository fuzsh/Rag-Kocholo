        "text": "starring Josh Lucas, Kurt Russell, Jacinda Barrett, Richard Dreyfuss, Emmy Rossum, Mia\n\nMaestro, Mike Vogel and Kevin Dillon\n\nscreenplay by Mark Protosevich\n\ndirected by Wolfgang Petersen\n\nThe Poseidon Adventure novel, by Paul Gallico, has been made and re-made numerous times now. This is another re-make of the original 1972 Poseidon Adventure, directed by Ronald Neame and starring Gene Hackman, Shelly Winters, Ernest Borgnine, Red Buttons, Roddy McDowal, and Leslie Nielsen. And this is the one I was waiting to see, not that awful made-for-TV movie, The Poseidon Adventure, directed by John Putch and starring Adam Baldwin, Rutger Hauer and Steve Guttenberg, that I was tricked into renting last July. Even so, this is a pretty disappointing film, heavy on action and extremely light on story. Maybe the ability to make fantastic action scenes using modern computer graphics lures directors away from telling the story and relying too much on the action along. Anyway, as long as you have seen the 1972 original, I think you can still give this one a miss."
