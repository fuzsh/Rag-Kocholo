        "text": "boywonder13 said:\n\nIt was reported that he was writing a script for in 2005 and that was the Truth. So whatever happens it will be based on his original story.\n\nGoyer did say later on he wouldn't able to write it. Saying he didn't have time. I wonder if he is going to write with Mark Protosevich, or come up with something new.\n\nblind_fury said:\n\nHooray! up:\n\nThor now has a chance of being good!\n\nI would way prefer Goyer working on this than Protosevich. At least Goyer has worked on two good films (Batman Begins and Dark City) opposed to Protosevich who hasnt worked on any (The Cell and Poseidon)\n\nAlthough to be fair the better films that Goyer has written have always had someone else working on the screenplay with him.\n\nHere' wat Mark Postsevich says about the THor Movie to get an idea of what the story will and style:http://www.comics2film.com/FanFrame.php?f_id=19152\n\n\"In the comics, the stories that appealed to me most were the features called 'Tales of Asgard,' \" CAA-repped Protosevich said. \"They were very much based on the traditional Norse myths and how the relationship between being like Thor and Loki and Thor and Odin, and how these beings manifested themselves. I don't want to give too much away, but I will say the movie will take place in the world of myth and legend but will not betray some of the thematic elements of the comics that made them so appealing, like the idea of a god growing to truly understand man.\"\n\n---\n\nThis movie is also gonna be a Lord of the Rings type movie it has been rumored. So I think it might be a far cry from the comics.....\n\nThanks God, Goyer is not writting Thor.....\n\nGoyer should stop writting comic book adaptations for a few year, say...80??\n\nStill A ThorFan said:\n\nThat sounds very good to me, BUT DAMN IT MAKE IT DARK!\n\nWhat´s with comic book fans wanting every single comic book movie to be \"dark\"?\n\nWhat is to be dark anyway?\n\nTo be set at night?\n\nThe sun has exploded?\n\nWhat???\n\nSee, this is where a movie has all the potential to be a piece of crap and a huge failure, more even than to be great...\n\nIn the comics, the stories that appealed to me most were the features called 'Tales of Asgard'....but will not betray some of the thematic elements of the comics.\n\nFirst, this is not about what stories most appealed to him, is about Thor....either you get it, or you don´t.\n\nSecond, will not betray some of the thematic....SOME??\n\nYou are betraying the comics as you speak, by saying that you will had SOME of the comic book elements.\n\nSo, basicaly, this is not a Thor movie, but rather, what Mr. Postsevich wanted Thor to be."
