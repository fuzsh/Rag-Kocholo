It’s Monday, May 1, 2006 and this is your first early morning Kids! briefing.\n\nThe Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) have stepped-up their efforts to thwart the online theft of music and movies by college students by turning their attention to the issues of theft via campus Local Area Network (LAN), as well as software such as Direct Connections, MYTunes and OurTunes, which allow the sharing of files over local network servers, thus skirting the “broader public Internet.” As part of their new campaign, the RIAA and MPAA has sent letters to 40 university presidents in US 25 states “alerting them of LAN piracy problems on their campuses and encouraging immediate action to stop and prevent theft by such means.” In the letter the MPAA and RIAA asks University administrators to review how their campus computer networks are being used and institute blocking and filtering devices where necessary to prevent such theft. You may recall that back in 2003 the RIAA filed suits against student operators of four campus LAN networks at three schools, as well as previous pushes against peer-to-peer file sharing, which takes place over the public internet.\n\nNEW PRODUCTION & DEVELOPMENT\n\nMarvel Studios‘ Chairman, Avi Arad has confirmed a bevy of directors and writers for many of its upcoming feature film projects.

These projects are expected to be financed with Marvel’s $525 million revolving film financing facility and distributed under Marvel’s overall distribution deal with Paramount, except for The Incredible Hulk which will be distributed under an earlier pact with Universal.\n\nAdding to last weeks news that Jon Favreau (Elf, Zathura) has been signed to direct and develop the movie version of Iron Man, writers for the project are Arthur Marcum and Matt Holloway (Convoy).\n\nThe new Incredible Hulk movie will be written by Zak Penn. Penn previously collaborated with Marvel on X2, Fantastic Four, and the upcoming release X-Men: The Last Stand.\n\nThe movie adaptation of Ant Man will be directed by Edgar Wright (Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz). Wright will co-write the movie with his partner Joe Cornish, and co-produce the movie with his partner Nira Park.\n\nDavid Self (Thirteen Days, Road to Perdition) will serve as writer for Captain America, based on Marvel’s American super soldier. Self has also worked with Marvel on Namor, the Sub-Mariner (Universal) and Deathlok (Paramount).\n\nNick Fury, super hero and spy, will feature a screenplay by Andrew Marlowe (Air Force On, End of Days, Hollow Man)\n\nThe movie based on Thor, the star of Norse mythology, will feature the work of screenwriter Mark Protosevich (Poseidon, The Cell).\n\nAnimation design studio 23D Films and Weller/Grossman Prods is co-producing Paloozaville, a mixed live-action/animated series created by and staring actor/singer John Lithgow that will air on Kids Club, which is part of Mag Rack, Rainbow Media’s video on-demand service.
