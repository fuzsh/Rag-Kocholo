        "text": "BEVERLY HILLS There wasn't a lot of acting required of the \"Poseidon cast, and the actors are the first to admit it.\n\nWhen people are forced to swim blindly through confined spaces, sometimes under a fiery surface, holding their breath for excruciating lengths of time and suffering serious bumps, bruises and abrasions during long hours in over-used water that's undoubtedly breeding all manner of bacteria, little dramatic training is needed. The real risk of pain, permanent injury and death by drowning sparks genuine fear.\n\nAnd that's just what director Wolfgang Petersen was after in his remake of 1972's seagoing disaster epic, \"The Poseidon Adventure, wherein a giant rogue wave turns a cruise ship upside down, leaving only a handful of passengers alive and trapped in an upside down world rapidly filling with water.\n\n\"With all the tools we have we can make it truly frightening and really realistic, really get across the idea of what disaster is, he says during roundtable interviews with the press at the Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel. \"That's what I wanted realistic, very hard-edged. Scary as hell like disaster is, and see how normal people react.\n\n\"You're not really acting much in this movie. You're not, says Josh Lucas, who plays gambler Dylan Johns in the new film. \"Because you're reacting.\n\nThe lean, athletic-looking, blue-eyed star of \"Glory Road and \"Stealth a certified scuba diver himself looks capable of handling anything they can deal out on a mere movie set, but he says the \"Poseidon shoot was no pleasure voyage.\n\n\"I was hospitalized twice on this movie, Lucas says. \"Two major, different injuries.\n\nThe first came when Kurt Russell accidentally opened a deep gash over Lucas' right eye with a heavy flashlight while the two men were swimming underwater through a narrow passage. In another sequence, Lucas fell from the wall of a flooding tank and snapped the tendons in his left thumb, requiring surgery. Then it was back into the gigantic 22-foot deep pool and the inundated sets on Warner Brothers' Stage 16.\n\n\"I was wet for five months, Lucas says. \"Your skin gets so soft you can cut it with your fingernail. It's gross. It's absolutely amazing what happens to your body when you're in the water for that period of time. ... We were hurt. Everyone was sick the whole time. You'll hear from everyone.\n\nRussell is next in the celebrity seat, still looking, at 55, every inch the rugged leading man with his ruddy outdoor complexion and clean shaven chin jutting out like Gibralter. But he, too, succumbed to the grueling conditions on the \"Poseidon set, coming down with pneumonia at one point, and nearly drowning at another, when he was required to hold his breath for an extended time in a completely enclosed chamber.\n\n\"It was the underwater stuff that was psychologically difficult to do because once you went in there was no way out, Russell said. \"You also had no goggles on so it was very difficult to see and you were dependent on someone to swim in and give you air underwater.\n\nAt the end of the second take, Russell says he was becoming disoriented and on the verge of blacking out when the \"safety person reached him with the regulator and revived him while leading him out of the enclosure.\n\n\"I was kind of aware of where we were and I came up and Wolfgang was at the monitor going, Oh, my God,' Russell recalls. \"So I said, Well, I guess we got it.' I was glad to be done with it.\n\nOscar-winner Richard Dreyfuss, who at 58 professes less interest in acting than in his current position as a senior advisory member at St. Anthony's College at Oxford University, says he took his \"Poseidon role for the money.\n\n\"Money. I mean, big surprise, they offered me a whole lot of money, the diminutive, graying actor says during his session. \"I love money. Didn't have a lot however. This is a good way of getting it ... This is the first time I knew I was going to earn my money.\n\nDreyfuss earned his paycheck by wrenching his back in the second week of shooting.\n\n\"But then I was OK, and then everyone else got hurt. Jimmy (Bennett, age 10) got hurt. Josh got hurt. Kurt got hurt. You couldn't avoid it, it came with the territory. And every day I'd go home, I'd crawl. It was hard.\n\n\"Because I'm lazy, Dreyfuss confesses, lowering his voice to a near-whisper. \"And one of the things I don't care what any artist tells you it's easy. And you want to be an actor because it's easy. Acting was like, just talking, you know? I thought I was doing a movie called My Dinner with Andre.'\n\n\"So this is a film that, if I was 30 years old and at the top of my form, I wouldn't have done it. Because I'm too lazy. Not because it was a bad movie or a good movie. I just don't wanna work that hard.\n\nOddly enough, none of the female members of the cast suffered any illness or serious injury, beyond a few bruises.\n\n\"I didn't get sick because I'd just gotten on to Chinese herbs and I think it actually helped, Jacinda Barrett says.\n\n\"I was pretty much purple from the neck down with bruises, because the floors were so slippery and my shoes were so slippery it would be like Man down!' But no, no, no, I'm a healthy girl, says Emmy Rossum, 19.\n\n\"I didn't get hurt, I didn't get sick, echoes Mia Maestro, co-star of TV's \"Alias. \"I think it's the Alias' recruiting camp. It made me very strong.\n\nBut Lucas still insists the environment was dangerous and unhealthy, taking its toll on everyone, and he suspects certain cast and crew members were \"peeing in the pool the whole time, turning the tank into \"a human petri dish.\n\n\"Look, I never compare what I do, we do, to a real job, he says. \"But truthfully this was as close to going to work on an oil rig as you can get.\n\nArchive ID: 3211112"
