        "text": "While most of the people involved in bringing the new Will Smith movie \"I Am Legend\" to the big screen were sitting in their offices in Los Angeles when the opening-weekend grosses came in at $77 million to top the box office, screenwriter Mark Protosevich was at home in Provincetown.\n\n\"I lived in L.A. for 13 years, and I just feel lucky now that I am in a position where I can pretty much live wherever I want,\" the 46-year-old Chicago native, who also has written \"The Cell\" and \"Poseidon,\" said.\n\nProtosevich first visited Provincetown with his girlfriend, artist Robena Malicoat, on New Year's Eve 1999. He fell in love with the Cape, and has lived here ever since.\n\n\"So much work is done through e-mail and the phone, I'm surprised more writers don't live outside L.A. There's something to be said for being within the community, and being part of the exposure, but some of those things can be detrimental, too. People in Hollywood get a little too wrapped up with things that are inconsequential when it comes to your work.\"\n\nBeing closer to L.A. doesn't mean your project will get made any faster, either, as Protosevich knows from experience. It's a big hit now, but it took more than a decade for his script for \"I Am Legend\" to get in front of the cameras.\n\n\"It's one of those projects in Hollywood history which become an epic saga,\" he said. \"I wrote a draft in '96 that caught the attention of Ridley Scott and Arnold Schwarzenegger that almost got made, but fell through. It was almost made a few times over the years with other people. In fact, I've been hired four separate times to work on the project.\"\n\nIn 2003, Protosevich was hired, with Will Smith and his producing partner James Lassiter onboard, to do yet another draft.\n\n\"That script is pretty much the foundation of the movie people see in theaters now,\" he said.\n\nBased on the classic 1954 horror story by Richard Matheson, \"I Am Legend\" stars Smith as Robert Neville, the last human survivor of a deadly virus that turns people into vampires. He spends his days hunting down and killing the undead and his night locked away in his Washington Square apartment hoping they won't finally find a way in and repay the favor. His life takes on new meaning when he discovers he's really not alone after all.\n\n\"Unfortunately, at that time '28 Days Later' came out, and even though our project existed for years, and I think they owe a lot to 'I Am Legend,' there was a hesitancy to movie forward on our script because of similarities between the two stories.\"\n\nAnd so it was back to the drawing board for \"I Am Legend\" until producer-writer Akiva Goldsman put together a deal that would bring it all to fruition.\n\n\"Two years ago the project was pretty much dead in the water; then Akiva, who is now a very well-established writer in his own right ('I, Robot' and 'A Beautiful Mind') signed on as a producer and brought Will back in.\"\n\nProtosevich did some work on the new script, as did Goldsman, and they have a shared credit on the film. As for who wrote what, Protosevich won't say.\n\n\"Having both names up there is a very accurate credit. There is a lot of me in the movie, and there's a lot of him in the movie. I'm not getting into the specifics of who did what, because ultimately it became a collaboration. ... It's very rare that one writer stays with a project through development. That's just the way Hollywood works. I was the only credited writer on 'Poseidon,' but there were at least 12 other writers on that movie. I went to see it and I didn't recognize half of it.\"\n\nWith the huge opening of \"I Am Legend,\" and another high-profile project on his plate (see sidebar), Protosevich is content to sit back and mull over the big question for someone in his position: Which is more important, good box office or a good review?\n\n\"That's the great debate everyone in movies faces in this business,\" he said. \"My feeling is that they're both important. Having a hit is helpful to your career. That's just the way it is. When a movie comes out and I go see it, though, I want to take pride in it, too. Having respect for your work among the critics or your peers or even among the talent is equally important, maybe even a little more important to me.\"\n\nIt's unlikely any of the professional writers in Hollywood are happy with the ongoing strike, but Mark Protosevich has a special reason for taking the labor dispute hard: It's stopping him from working on his dream project. \"The project I was working on before the strike and that I'm really excited about is writing the screenplay for 'Thor' for Marvel Entertainment,\" he said. \"Being on strike, though, means you can't work on any projects for which you've been contracted by a studio. So I can't work on 'Thor' now. If I had a great idea, there is nothing I would do with it, so I'm intentionally not thinking about it.\" Of course, that doesn't mean he won't talk about it. In fact, if you happen to pass him on Main Street in Provincetown, all you need to do is say \"Thor\" and you're liable to spend the next half-hour listening to him talk passionately about the Norse superhero. \"Growing up, Thor was absolutely my favorite superhero and my favorite comic book,\" he said. \"I really aggressively pursued Marvel to do this project, and I think it's really going to take people by surprise. It's very firmly rooted in Norse myth, so it's not going to be your normal superhero movie. The story will have to deal with Thor's relationship with the people of Earth, naturally, but it's very much rooted in mythology.\" It's clear that he has a passion for the subject and is really chomping at the bit to get back to writing the screenplay. But as much as he wants to, he won't do it. \"I'm sticking to my union guns right now,\" he said. \"In terms of any project I'm contracted for, it's pencils down.\" â€” JOHN BLACK"
