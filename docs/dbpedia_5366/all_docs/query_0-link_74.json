        "text": "Passengers Booked For Poseidon\n\nKurt Russell, Richard Dreyfuss and Emmy Rossum have been cast in Wolfgang Petersen's big-budget remake of The Poseidon Adventure. The original 1972 disaster movie follows a group of survivors trying to escape a capsized ocean liner. In this version Russell will play an ex-fireman travelling with his daughter (Rossum) and her boyfriend (played by newcomer Mark Vogel). Dreyfuss has taken the role of a gay man who's just been dumped.\n\nThe Cell scribe Mark Protosevich and the prolific Akiva Goldsman (A Beautiful Mind, I, Robot) have written the screenplay based on the novel by Paul Gallico. Cameras pitch and roll on 18th June. We're feeling queasy already. Ratner Marked For X\n\nMarvel Entertainment and 20th Century Fox have confirmed that Brett Ratner will direct X3 - the third instalment in the X-Men franchise. The director of the Rush Hour movies and recent caper After The Sunset replaces Matthew Vaughn who walked out on the project less than a week ago.\n\nThe Layer Cake helmer gave his official reason as not wanting to uproot his family from Britain, but insiders reckon he had growing apprehensions about taking on such a big assignment in only his second directorial outing. Ratner's appointment keeps the film on track for an August shoot and May 2006 release. Teen Fights Terror\n\nAfter bagging an Oscar nomination for Hotel Rwanda, screenwriter Keir Pearson is taking on Al Qaeda. Paramount have hired him to write the story of teenager Abdurahman Khadr, who was raised in Osama Bin Laden's Afghanistan compound. He would later become an informant for the CIA after growing disillusionment with the terrorist ethos.\n\n\"I was in New York for the first World Trade Center bombing and for 9/11, so this was a story that I could be passionate about,\" Pearson said. \"I see it as a story of a rebellious teenager that transcends all cultures.\" James Dean eat your heart out. The Sith Slides\n\nAcross the pond Star Wars: Revenge Of The Sith has tumbled off the top of the chart. Jungle tooner Madagascar scrabbled to No. 1 in its second week of release taking $28.7m (£15.8m) while sporting comedy The Longest Yard (also in its second week) took runner-up position with $26.1 (£14.4m). George Lucas's space opus has dropped to third place with $26m (£14.3m).\n\nMeanwhile Russell Crowe's boxing drama Cinderella Man opened in fourth position with a rather disappointing tally of $18.6m (£10.2m). The numbers are still being counted at home, but it looks like Sith still reigns with Sin City close behind."
