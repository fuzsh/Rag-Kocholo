        "text": "Poseidon is a 2006 action-adventure disaster film about the luxury ocean liner Poseidon that capsizes on New Year's Eve after being swamped by a rogue wave. The survivors are left to fight for their lives as they attempt to escape the sinking ship. It is a loose remake of the 1972 film The Poseidon Adventure.\n\nDirected by Wolfgang Petersen. Written by Mark Protosevich, based on the novel The Poseidon Adventure by Paul Gallicoand.\n\nMayday.\n\nCaptain Michael Bradford\n\n[edit]\n\nNow we're not sure exactly what happened here, but our best guess is that we were struck by what is known as a rogue wave. They are rare, they are unpredictable, and they are lethal, Now the good news. The instant this ship was struck, emergency GPS locater beacons were launched, so we are at most, several hours from rescue. [People start to panic; a few ask if the ship is sinking] Please, do yourselves a favor. Follow the directions of my officers, and stay calm. This room is a giant air bubble holding up the ship. Once these bulkhead doors are sealed, we will be safe from gas leaks, fire, and flooding. We will be safe.\n\nRobert Ramsey\n\n[edit]\n\n[to Dylan] You know, there's nothing fair about who lives and dies. You gave Elena a chance. You gave everybody a chance.\n\nDylan Johns\n\n[edit]\n\n[To Maggie] You know, normally what you get on these cruise ships is a desperate single woman hoping to meet a guy, and, uh- you sure don't fit the bill.\n\nOther\n\n[edit]\n\nRichard Nelson: I wouldn't put a lot of faith on what the captain says. I'm an architect, and these boats weren't designed to float upside down.\n\nDialogue\n\n[edit]\n\nJennifer Ramsey: [walks to poker table with Christian] We're going downstairs now.\n\nRobert Ramsey: Ok, have fun... Hey Jen...\n\nJennifer Ramsey: [looks down at her cleavage] The twins? Dad...\n\nRobert Ramsey: Just one more button.\n\nJennifer Ramsey: [closes a button of her shirt] Pair of 5's, huh dad?\n\n[Jennifer walks away with Christian]\n\nDylan Johns: All in.\n\nRobert Ramsey: [frowns] I fold.\n\nDylan Johns: Does your husband...\n\nMaggie James: Oh, does that work much?\n\nDylan Johns: What?\n\nMaggie James: The tentative mention of a husband I'm supposed to correct, even though you clocked my wedding finger twice already.\n\nRobert Ramsey: Now I know we're on this ship, but technically you two are still under my roof and it makes me uncomfortable... you two... alone.\n\nJennifer Ramsey: Dad, do you have any idea how big this ship is? Don't you think if we really wanted to we could find somewhere away from you to do that thing you're so afraid of us doing?\n\nElena Morales: I feel like I know your dad.\n\nJennifer Ramsey: He was mayor of New York for a while, back when I was a kid.\n\nElena Morales: Cool.\n\nJennifer Ramsey: It wasn't.\n\nCaptain Bradford: You may not leave this ballroom.\n\nRobert Ramsey: Excuse me?\n\nCaptain Bradford: I am within my authority to compel you to stay, you know that.\n\nRobert Ramsey: Captain, I understand- you have no choice. You have sick and injured people here, you need to stay with them. [Bradford nods] But I am going to find my daughter, and don't think for one second that you're going to stop me.\n\nLucky Larry: You know, I forgot. Big hero. Rescued all those women and children from the fires. Got elected. Man of the people. But you're not the boss anymore. Hm? You quit. Couldn't hack it. If I recall correctly, you couldn't even hang onto your wife. Come on. Come on.\n\n[Robert begins to stand up]\n\nJennifer Ramsey: Dad. Calm down. Let it go. Okay. Please?\n\nLucky Larry: [mocking] \"Daddy, please\". Come on.\n\nRobert Ramsey: Hey, man. Hey, you got it. Knock yourself out.\n\nDylan Johns: It's okay. Go ahead.\n\nLucky Larry: [pointing to Robert and Dylan] Assholes, both of you.\n\nConnor James: What are you doing?\n\nDylan Johns: Thinking, you?\n\nConnor James: Thinking, what are we thinking about exactly?\n\nDylan Johns: Well, I'm thinking of this door, and what's behind it.\n\n[Connor approaches the door]\n\nDylan Johns: Easy there, fireball, we don't know what's behind there. Watch.\n\n[splashes the door handle with water and hot steam bursts]\n\n[A tremendous explosion shakes the ballroom as the leaking gas in the galley explodes]\n\nOfficer: Captain!\n\nCaptain Bradford: That felt like the galley.\n\nOfficer: The gas shut offs must have malfunctioned.\n\nCaptain Bradford: The door seals, will they keep the fire out?\n\nOfficer: Yes, Captain.\n\n[The Captain incorrectly presumes that Dylan and rest of the group who went with him are dead.]\n\nCaptain Bradford: God rest their souls.\n\nDylan Johns: [to Richard, who has Marco Valentin clinging to his leg as they dangle at the entrance to an elevator shaft, with an elevator above them about to fall] Shake him off! Shake him off! Now, or you both die!\n\nMarco Valentin: No!\n\nRichard Nelson: [to Marco] I'm so sorry.\n\n[Marco screams]\n\nDylan Johns: Shake him off! Now!\n\nMarco Valentin: No! No! NOOOOOOOOO!\n\n[Richard kicks off Marco, who falls to the bottom of the elevator shaft and is impaled]\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nKurt Russell - Robert Ramsey\n\nJosh Lucas - Dylan Johns\n\nRichard Dreyfuss - Richard Nelson\n\nJacinda Barrett - Maggie James\n\nEmmy Rossum - Jennifer Ramsey\n\nMike Vogel - Christian Sanders\n\nMia Maestro - Elena Morales\n\nKevin Dillon - Lucky Larry\n\nFreddy Rodriguez - Marco Valentin\n\nJimmy Bennett - Conor James\n\nStacy Ferguson - Gloria\n\nAndre Braugher - Captain Michael Bradford\n\nKirk B.
