        "text": "Legendary Pictures is still planning on bringing the blockbuster Mass Effect video game franchise to the big screen in the near future, and according to Variety, the company has just hired Davis Foehl to write a new script for the adaptation. When the movie was first put into development in 2008, Mark Protosevich (Thor) was brought on to write the script, but it looks like now everything is starting from scratch.\n\nFoehl is a former assistant editor on projects like Rescue Me and I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry. He hasn’t had any of his scripts get adapted for film yet, but he has gained a lot of buzz around some of the unproduced ones he has written. And he’ll need all the talent in the world to successfully adapt the sprawling sci-fi storyline of the Mass Effect series. We’ll have more information on this movie as it becomes available.\n\nRELATED: 10 Mass Effect Voice Actors That Will Turn You Into A Groupie\n\n[via Variety]"
