        "text": "The Poseidon Adventure, one of the most emblematic disaster movies of the 1970s, is heading for a remake. Directed by Troy's Wolfgang Petersen, it will star Kurt Russell and Richard Dreyfuss as the passengers battling to escape a capsized cruise ship. Russell is to play a former fireman travelling with his daughter and potential son-in-law, while Dreyfuss's character is a man whose relationship breaks up just before departure. The screenplay is by The Cell's Mark Protosevich and A Beautiful Mind's Akiva Goldsman. Filming is to start on June 18 at studios in Los Angeles.\n\nFollowing Matthew Vaughn's sudden departure just weeks before filming starts, X-Men 3 has found a new director. Brett Ratner, who shot the Rush Hour action films starring Jackie Chan, will now sit in the hot seat. Finding a director for the comic-book-inspired movie has been troublesome, with original director Bryan Singer dropping out to head production on Superman Returns.\n\nThe Exorcist author, William Blatty, is suing the studio behind the recent sequel to the franchise for $750,000 (Â£412,000). The writer claims Morgan Creek Productions did not pay an agreed fee after it made the recently released Dominion: A Prequel to the Exorcist, according to the trade magazine The Hollywood Reporter. The studio could not be reached for comment.\n\nStockholm University has just created an Ingmar Bergman Professorship in honour of the revered Swedish director. The first holder is German academic Thomas Elsaesser, a professor of film studies at Amsterdam University, whose area of research is art cinema. \"A professorship in Ingmar Bergman's name will help to promote scholarship of the highest international order,\" said Ase Kleveland, director general of the Swedish Film Institute. What next: the inaugural George Lucas chair in Hollywood cinema at the University of Los Angeles?"
