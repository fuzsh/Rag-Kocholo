        "text": "Mark Protosevich is a screenwriter whose credits include The Cell, Poseidon, I Am Legend, Thor and Old Boy.\n\nThe Cell (2000) starred Jennifer Lopez, Vince Vaughn, and Vincent D’Onofrio, and was the feature film debut of director Tarsem Singh (The Fall, Immortals, Mirror Mirror). Roger Ebert listed The Cell as one of the ten best films of 2000 and Protosevich’s screenplay was nominated for a Bram Stoker Award.\n\nPoseidon (2006) starred Kurt Russell, Richard Dreyfuss, and Josh Lucas, and was directed by acclaimed filmmaker Wolfgang Petersen (Das Boot, The Perfect Storm, In the Line of Fire).\n\nI Am Legend (2007) starred Will Smith and was directed by Francis Lawrence (Constantine, Water for Elephants, The Hunger Games:Catching Fire). In terms of box office, I Am Legend has the second best December opening of all time and remains one of Will Smith’s most commercially successful motion pictures.\n\nThor (2011) starred Chris Hemsworth, Natalie Portman, and Anthony Hopkins and was directed by Kenneth Branagh (Henry V, Hamlet, Jack Ryan).\n\nOldboy (2013) starred Josh Brolin, Elizabeth Olsen, and Sharlto Copley, and was directed by legendary filmmaker Spike Lee (Do The Right Thing, Malcolm X, Inside Man).\n\nProtosevich was born in Chicago, Illinois and studied Film at Columbia College Chicago. After graduating with honors, he spent four years teaching beginning film production courses at Columbia College and then moved to Los Angeles, where he began his motion picture career as a story analyst for producer Scott Rudin.\n\nHe worked as a development executive for Orion Pictures, producer Dawn Steel, and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, and then made his first spec screenplay sale (for The Cell). Protosevich happily left the world of the “suits” behind and has ever since been doing what he always dreamed of doing for a living: writing screenplays.\n\nProtosevich lives on Cape Cod with his wife, the painter Robena Malicoat."
