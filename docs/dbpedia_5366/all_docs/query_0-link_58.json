        "text": "He’s a Norse god with a giant hammer. Bring on the bad guys!\n\nAccording to the L.A. Times, the script for \"Thor\" has been written by Mark Protosevich, the writer of \"The Cell,\" \"Poseidon,\" and this winter’s \"I Am Legend.\"\n\nEarly word indicates that Matthew Vaughn is being courted to direct. You’ll remember Vaughn as the guy who was about to direct \"X-Men: The Last Stand,\" but bailed and headed off to do \"Stardust\" instead. (He also directed \"Layer Cake.\")\n\nMore word on this Marvel project when it becomes available. Because if there’s one thing we can’t have enough of, it’s superhero movies."
