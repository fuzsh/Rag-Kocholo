Poseidongenerated US$181,674,817 at the worldwide box office and $19,725,028 in DVD sales, making its total gross $201,399,845\n\nPlot • On New Year's Eve in the north Atlantic Ocean, the ocean liner Poseidon, named after the Greek water god, is on a Transatlantic crossing. On one of its thirteen decks, we see Dylan Johns (Josh Lucas) an ex-Navy sailor turned professional gambler, running for an evening workout. Meanwhile, in one of the 800 cabins, Jen Ramsey (Emmy Rossum) is with her fiancé Christian (Mike Vogel) when they are interrupted by Jen's father, former firefighter and mayor of New York Robert Ramsey (Kurt Russell) who is becoming overprotective of his daughter and indifferent to Christian. Down below in the kitchen, a Spanish woman named Elena (Mia Maestro), is stowing away onboard from Spain to be with her sick brother in New York, with the help of her friend Valentin (Freddy Rodriguez), a waiter. Elsewhere, Richard Nelson (Richard Dreyfuss), a distraught architect, is calling his ex-lover, only to get the answering machine.\n\nThe Morning After(1973 The Poseidon Adventure) • Composers • Joel Hirschhorn • Al Kasha • \"The Morning After\" (aka \"The Song from 'The Poseidon Adventure'\") is an Academy Award-winning song, first released during May 1973. It was the first success for singer Maureen McGovern, and was used as the love theme for the filmThe Poseidon Adventure, which was released late the year before.\n\nThe Morning After(1973) • The song was written during March 1972 by 20th Century Fox songwriters Al Kasha and Joel Hirschhorn, who were told to write the love theme for The Poseidon Adventure in one night. In the end, the finished product was called \"Why Must There Be a Morning After?\" but changes by management resulted in the song's more optimistic tone (as evidenced by the new cry of \"There's got to be a morning after\"). In the end titles of the film, it is officially called \"The Song From 'The Poseidon Adventure'\", not what would be its otherwise best known title, \"The Morning After\".\n\nMaureen McGovern • Maureen Therese McGovern (born July 27, 1949) is an American singer and Broadway actress, well-known for her premier rendition of the song, \"The Morning After\" for the movie The Poseidon Adventure (1972) • After graduating from Boardman High School in 1967, she worked as a secretary and performed part-time as a singer for a local folk band called Sweet Rain. Her singing caught the attention of Russ Regan (then head of 20th Century Records) in 1972 when he heard a demonstration she had recorded. At the time, Regan was searching for a singer to record \"The Morning After\" (the theme from The Poseidon Adventure) for release as a record. He hired McGovern sight unseen to record the song, which resulted in her contracting with 20th Century Records. After it won an Oscar for Best Original Song, \"The Morning After\" scored well on the popular music charts, reaching #1 during 1973\n\nLyrics (MV link) There got to be a morning after If we can hold on through the night We have a chance to find the sunshine Let's keeping on looking for the light Oh, can't you see the morning after? It's waiting right outside the storm Why don't we cross the bridge together And find a place that's safe and warm\n\nIt's not too late,we should be giving Only with love can we climb It's not too late, not while we're living Let's put our hands out in time There's got to be a morning after We're moving closer to the shore I know we'll be there by tomorrow And we'll escape the darkness We won't be searching anymore\n\nFergie • This is a listing of the official solo releases by Fergie, an American pop singer, and also a vocalist of American Hip-Hop group, the Black Eyed Peas .
