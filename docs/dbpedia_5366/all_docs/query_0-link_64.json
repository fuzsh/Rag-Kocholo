        "text": "LATEST NEWS\n\nDavid Goyer Helming New Invisible Man\n\nThey've already adapted H.G. Wells' The Time Machine a few times in Hollywood, and now they're turning their attention back to The Invisible Man (which has already had a few Hollywood films), or at least building off of it. Universal Pictures has set David Goyer, who just directed The Invisible as well as wrote the screenplay for Blade and Batman Begins, as the director on the project. Goyer has been taking on quite a few big projects recently, including directing the X-Men spinoff Magneto and writing a number of other comic book movie scripts.\n\nMatthew Vaughn to Direct Thor Movie\n\nFilmmaker Matthew Vaughn, who started off his career well with Layer Cake and is about to take a step off into the deep end with Stardust, is in talks to direct an adaptation of the Marvel comic character Thor. As with all comic book movies these days, we \"hear\" about them, but it always takes a while for them to truly come together. Last year Avi Arad announced that a Thor movie was in the works, saying \"we're in the scripting stage right now.\" The news today comes via an article in the LA Times, and states that Vaughn is likely to direct a script written by Mark Protosevich (Poseidon, I Am Legend).\n\nDarren Lynn Bousman Hypes Up Saw IV!\n\nIf you hadn't already heard late last year after Saw III came out, Saw IV is definitely on the way. As a matter of fact, it's already done being filmed! Director Darren Lynn Bousman reprised his role as director again (for the third time, also directing Saw II and Saw III) and just finished filming - all to follow the same year-after-year release pattern. Although everything is tight lipped regarding the plot or the story, including even the basic idea, Bousman did speak recently to ShockTillYouDrop.com, hyping up the fourth installment. If you're not yet interested, then you might want to read this and get ready to be grinning with excitement.\n\nNew Sunshine Poster and Featurettes\n\nThe first time we introduced Danny Boyle's sci fi film Sunshine it was way back in January, when the first trailer appeared. Since then we've been following it closely, including watching it open in the UK in April and painstakingly sit here in the US without being able to see it until the summer has passed. And if you didn't already hear, the release date was recently moved up - all the way to July 20th, timed perfectly with Comic-Con the following week (where it will also have an appearance). Today we present the newest poster featuring a couple of great quotes and a few featurettes on the making of Sunshine.\n\nCasino Royale's Martin Campbell Remaking 36\n\nEnjoyed Casino Royale and/or GoldenEye? Then you might be interested in this news. The director who brought us both of those James Bond movies, Martin Campbell, is attached to direct a remake of the 2004 French-language thriller 36 Quai des Orf√®vres. Titled in America as just 36, the story revolves around two detectives who try to solve a series of armored car robberies in the hopes of landing a promotion promised to whoever catches the perpetrators. Robert De Niro is both producing and starring in it as well.\n\nRichard Price will do an overhaul of the original screenplay and reimagine the two detectives in their 30s. The original film is currently sitting with a 7.2/10 on IMDb, which means that it at least wasn't that bad, so we can only hope for the best in this American remake. Campbell's got another thriller called Unstoppable that he's working on next, so it won't be until after that is finished that production will start on 36.\n\nEarly Ratatouille Sneak Previews This Saturday!\n\nPixar's next film hitting this summer, titled Ratatouille, is running sneak previews in 800 screens this upcoming Saturday. These public sneak previews are being run in most big theaters around the US starting at 7:00PM on Saturday, June 16th. Check your local theater's listings at Fandango.com.\n\nI just saw Ratatouille for the first time last night, and I will without a doubt certainly suggest this above almost anything else this summer. With other films you'll take a gamble on whether they'll be good or even whether you'll like them yourself. With Pixar and especially with Ratatouille, you have an original, creative, fun film that I guarantee you'll love. Do yourself a favor this weekend. Forget Nancy Drew or Fantastic Four 2, go see Ratatouille, it's a heartwarming film and will definitely be an enjoyable experience.\n\nPunisher 2's Director Scuffle\n\nThis sequel is really getting butchered. With so much happening to it, and for that matter, so much negative news, I don't know how it'll ever turn out good anymore. The quintessential Frank Castle, known in real life as actor Thomas Jane, who played Punisher in the first film from 2004, already left the sequel a month back, saying \"what I won't do is spend months of my life sweating over a movie that I just don't believe in\". Now without a primary actor to fill the role, the film seems to be running into more troubles. The director that was supposed to be directing Punisher 2 is actually not. Now it's a new girl, known by her first film Green Street Hooligans, who will supposedly be taking on Punisher 2.\n\nConnelly and Bettany Join Born - A Thriller with Claymation\n\nThe way this news starts out sounds all dandy, like another good flick with a good cast. Jennifer Connelly and real-life husband Paul Bettany have both been cast in a film called Born, a psychological thriller that Guillermo del Toro (Pan's Labyrinth), Lawrence Gordon and Lloyd Levin will produce. Now let's get into the story, where this film really starts to get interesting.\n\nBernal, Glover, and Braga Join Meirelles' Blindness\n\nAs promised, we said we'd bring you an update on Fernando Meirelles' Blindness, and here it is. Three great actors, Gael Garcia Bernal, Danny Glover and Alice Braga, are all joining his film in various roles. Bernal will play the King of Ward 3, Glover will narrate the story, and Braga will portray the \"girl with the dark glasses\". They already join recently announced Mark Ruffalo as well as Julianne Moore, with filming set to start in early July in Brazil next year.\n\nGus Van Sant to Direct Adaptation of The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test\n\nLegendary director Gus Van Sant, who directed My Own Private Idaho, Good Will Hunting, Finding Forrester, and Elephant, among many other great films, already had a new film debut at the Cannes Film Fest this year, titled Paranoid Park (which won him an award at the fest). In addition to that film, the 55 year old filmmaker's already got his next project lined up - an adaptation of the 1960's hallucinogenic novel \"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test\" written by Tom Wolfe early in his career. The script will be written by Lance Black (Big Love) and directed by Gus Van Sant, although there is no date set yet for when filming will begin.\n\nStrange Wilderness - A Comedy About Bigfoot - Heads for January\n\nGet this, they're making a comedy about bigfoot! Or for that matter, it's already made (and already got an R rating). Sounds a bit like that trippy scene in Tenacious D: The Pick of Destiny, but full length. The film is titled Strange Wilderness, produced by Adam Sandler's Happy Madison, and stars Steve Zahn, Allen Covert, Jonah Hill, Justin Long, Jeff Garlin and Broken Lizard's Kevin Heffernan. Haven't heard of it before? That's because it just changed hands in Hollywood, from the bad guys at Fox to the good guys at Paramount.\n\nZack Snyder Updates Watchmen Rumors\n\nAlthough Zack Snyder's feature film adaptation of Watchmen wasn't on the Comic-Con list for July (which will be explained in this article later), Snyder did speak recently with MTV and provided an update and somewhat of a confirmation on the casting rumors posted in May. The film is one of the most hyped upcoming comic book adaptations (that has yet to begin filming), both because of Zack Snyder's success with 300 as well as the fact that Watchmen is regarded as one of (if not the) greatest comic book ever published."
