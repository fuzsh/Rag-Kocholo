        "text": "http://www.aintitcool.com/node/33633\n\nAint It Cool News said:\n\nMark Protosevich's brilliant THOR script to be directed by STARDUST's Matthew Vaughn!!!\n\nHey folks, Harry here... The week before I got married, I got a whole host of scripts. About 20 to be exact and in and amongst those was the latest script by Mark Protosevich (I AM LEGEND, JOHN CARTER OF MARS)... THOR.\n\nI'm a huge THOR geek. Even got that Mjolnir replica they issued a few years back - and I constantly hope a burglar breaks into my house so I can smash his face with my uru hammer. (joke... kinda).\n\nSo when this script hit... I'm a huge fan of Protosevich... worked with him for quite some time on John Carter and he's a great guy to work with... intensely passionate about the material he's working on... and I kinda hate that I didn't get the script from Mark, cuz when he turned in his draft on JOHN CARTER - it came accompanied with a soundtrack cd he had made (that looked like Mars) that was made up of the music he was listening to, as he wrote the script. Richard Kelly does this too.\n\nAnyway - I sat down and dove into the script. This isn't a Donald Blake, doctor on vacation story. Instead, this is a genuine TALES OF ASGARD story. In the first few pages the creation of everything takes place... the origin of the gods, their universe and how midgard (that's are place in the universe) came to be.\n\nIt has Thor and Loki as brothers - the best of friends... and it shows how that goes bad. The origin of the uru hammer, Thor being thrown from Asgard to being a mere mortal... it's a HUGE story - easily the most awesome script that a MARVEL project has ever had.\n\nAbout 3 weeks ago, I heard they were talking to Matthew Vaughn... I'm a huge fan of Matthew's STARDUST. However, I'm sure Matthew knows this... but the tone of STARDUST and this THOR script are very very different. There can be no tongue in cheek, no broad comedy... this is an intense story or deception, quests and battles amongst gods. Protosevich channeled all the best from Kirby's universe and I hope to Odin that they take their visual cue from his work.\n\nThis has the chance to literally kick everything we have coming up's ass.\n\nIt's an epic step forward in ambition for Matthew Vaughn - I know MARVEL loves this script - I just hope they allow this project to live up to its potential. Now they have the hardest task of all... finding Thor. Me - there's a half crazed part of me that wants Ernest Borgnine to play ODIN - ala his Ragnar from THE VIKINGS. But that's probably just me.\n\nI like the idea of making it more mythical and Kirby-esque. Hopefully Vaughn will do the script justice.\n\nhttp://www.iesb.net/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=3062&Itemid=99\n\nScript Review: Great Odin's Beard...THOR!\n\nWritten by Robert Sanchez\n\nWednesday, 15 August 2007\n\nNorse God of Thunder! Legendary warrior born! Son of Asgard, the Mighty Thor! Mr. E is back with one of the hottest scripts around, THOR!\n\nMr. E here. Last night, about 6 PM Pacific Time, I was skateboarding home from work when, from out of freaking nowhere, this \"thing\" dropped out of the sky onto and into the sidewalk directly in my path, creating a huge pothole - worthy enough to be ignored by the city's street maintenance forces. I skidded to the rim of the great smoking hole and peered in. Directly in the center of the crater was a hammer - it was a single block of something the size of my thumb-tip with a tiny wooden handle about a half inch tall. It was acting as a weight to a stack of papers about an inch and a half high. Climbing down into the mini-pit, I noticed there was writing on the side of the hammer's little head. It read: Â“Whosoever reads this script, if he be worthy, shall possess the power of Thor.\"\n\n\"That's cool.\"\n\nI tugged and I yanked and I pulled and nothing happened. There was not one iota of movement from the half-a-stapler sized hammer.\n\n\"Who shall ever be able to move this sucker without getting a hernia shall at least wrench his or hers back out!\" I thought to myself.\n\nPulling with more strength than I thought possible, there was a great KRACCKKKAAA -THOOOOOM of an explosion and I found myself teleported onto my living room couch, a warm script in my hands. The front page read: THOR by Mark Protosevich.\n\n\"Awesome!\" I exclaimed, and began to read.\n\nTHE SPOILERS DOTH BEGINETH BELOW\n\nTHOR begins, simply enough, with a black screen and mystical narration, describing THE CREATION OF THE NINE WORLDS. The NINE WORLDS and its inhabitants are then introduced, each paragraph becoming so much more overwhelmingly verbose, that one can nearly hear the film's producers\n\nscratching their collective heads from here.\n\nFrom the inky void, the seers URD, VERDAND and SKULD describe the populating of the worlds, including A HUMONGOUS COW that feeds YMIR, the first FROST GIANT and his family. GNOMES and FAERIES come into the picture, followed by THE GODS OF ASGARD. There's some godly begetting that goes on - ODIN KING OF THE GODS follows and finally he begets our hero THOR. (Oh yeah, ODIN creates Man and Woman to worship him, too - lucky sod.)\n\nThe narration ends, and we are introduced to the adult THOR and LOKI , THOR'S BROTHER, THE WARRIORS THREE (FANDRAL, HOGUN and VOLSTAGG) ASGARD's MOST POPULAR BOY BAND - just kidding here, and BALDER, his advisor as they ride their great horses through SVARTALFHEIM in search of IVALDI, KING OF THE GNOMES.\n\nAt some point in the middle of THOR's thrilling battle with a HELL STAG (page 15, I think) I dropped my Norse Mythology for Dummies book in disgust and chucked my battered Engelsk-Norsk dictionary into the wastebasket.\n\nThey were slowing me down. I had a script to read and a review to write. Meanwhile, during the hell staggy conflict, THOR saves many gnomes, but his great wooden hammer is destroyed. IVALDI promises to make him a new hammer.\n\nTHIS ENDETH THE SPOILERS\n\nTHOR is a meaty script. Without doing any serious research, it certainly appears writer Protosevich has worked to recreate the legend as \"accurately\" as possible.\n\nNevertheless, I wished I had called Judy at Time-Life books and ordered their seventeen volume set of Norse Myths and Legends. I was already lost in the great confusion of so many throwaway names for so many things. Two pages after reading it, I couldn't even remember if LIDSKJALF was ODIN'S THRONE, or the Ligonberry jelly I bought at IKEA.\n\nBut this is not your father's THOR. It's not even Vincent D'Onofrio's THOR from Chris Columbus' ADVENTURES IN BABYSITTING. This is not THOR the superhero as portrayed in the Marvel comics - a god on Earth who performs super-heroic feats, rescues damsels in distresses, fights supervillains and does all of the usual stuff straight out of the Â“How To Be A Superhero Handbook.Â” This is the tale of THOR, son of Odin and Prince of Asgard and his journey from arrogant boob (not the good kind-sorry folks) to the true\n\nheroic ideal.\n\nThis disappointed me. Despite the well-drawn characters and thrilling adventures , as I was reading the script, I kept wanting to see THOR in present day New York.\n\nAnother key element that was missing from the script for me was its portrayal of ASGARD somehow. I was hoping this ASGARD would be some how influenced by the work of THOR co-creator, the late great comic god Jack Kirby. But no, this version will give its Production Designer(s) the chance to create stunning richly detailed Nine Worlds more \"realistically\", and again, as a comic book geek I was disappointed. I really wanted to get my Kirby on here.\n\nTHOU ART MORE SPOILAGE BELOW\n\nTHOR gets his new hammer Mjolnir, goes a little bit nuts with it and is banished from Asgard, allowing LOKI to get all GRIMA WORMTONGUE and make plans to take over as ruler of ASGARD.THOR is humiliated and plot plot plot THOR is joined by THE WARRIORS THREE, plot plot plot and regains\n\nhis hammer. Theres are a lot of special effects as ASGARD goes to war and THOR faces the treacherous LOKI and there is the obligatory \"A New Hero Is Born\" ending.\n\nTHIS ENDETH THE PLOT SPOILAGE\n\nThe hard PG-13 / light R rated telling of THOR's story may be spectacular, but I can't see the movie becoming the next Spider-Man or even the next Ghost Rider for Marvel Films. I simply can't imagine a line of THOR action figures, fast food tie-in toys or any merchandising outside of a soundtrack. Not to mention there's no product placement possible with this script. Well maybe Scandinavian Airlines System or SAS, could get some ancillary action and offer THOR flights to famous fjords (like the one with\n\nSlartibartfast's signature on the glacier)!\n\nNow, I know all of my marketing musings really have nothing to do with the script, but films based on comics have become events, with huge amounts of additional income generated through cross-promotional items, like my still-unopened X-MEN 2 ROGUE can of Dr. Pepper, and despite the film's\n\nmany strengths I can't see THOR hitting the kind of financial figures the bigwigs have come to expect.\n\nDespite my geek misgivings and musings of the lack of happy meal toys, what did I think? THOR is a very good script to be sure, but it's humorless. It has some very good action sequences and Kirbyesque imagery or not, THOR does have the promise of blowing movie goers' eye sockets out with amazing\n\nnever-before-seen worlds of Norse mythology, especially now that STARDUST director Matthew Vaughn is reportedly at the helm. I can't wait to see it on the big screen.\n\nTHOR rates a CONAN THE BARBARIAN out of a possible X-MEN 2, or 7 stars out of 10. Mr. E wonders whatever happened to Maia Brewton of ADVENTURES IN BABYSITTING and \"Parker Lewis Can't Lose.Â” Serious replies can be sent care of IESB.net.\n\nTHOR by Mark Protosevich Â– April 4, 2007."
