        "text": "After the shocking news that Steven Spielberg and Will Smith might be making an American remake to cult Hong Kong classic Oldboy, the Internet was buzzing. But now comes buzz-killing news that I Am Legend and Poseidon writer Mark Protosevich will be writing the script, and people aren’t so thrilled.\n\nThough it is Steven Spielberg and it could still be awesome, we all know what a bad script can do — even with such a legendary directory.\n\nLet’s take a look at Protosevich’s track record. The Cell: eh, trippy and f’d up, but that’s about all. Poseidon: not the worst movie I’ve ever seen, but not good either; oh, and it’s a remake of a classic. I Am Legend: one of the worst movies I saw last year; again, a remake of sorts. Thor: still a while before we’ll see this one, if ever… which means questions begin to arise here as well.\n\nOf course, the writer isn’t the sole reason these movies weren’t that good, but they do pour the foundation for which the director builds on and it has to be taken into consideration. If you asked me what made I Am Legend such a piece of shit, I’d be pointing most movable digits in the direction of the director, honestly. But the truth to the matter is that he did write all these and it’s there to think what you will.\n\nI guess we can only hope that more writers will be helping and something will be turned in that Spielberg can work into a great movie. Unfortunately, I think this sounds more like a cash-making project more than a passion project, so my hopes are not too high at the moment, what about you?"
