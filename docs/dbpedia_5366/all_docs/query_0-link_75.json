Protosevich's history includes the screenplays for I Am Legend and Poseidon, in addition to writer and story credits on The Cell and Thor, respectively. Whether Foehl's job is to rewrite the existing script or begin anew is uncertain.This is a movie adaptation of a gaming franchise, however, so this is not likely to be last round of musical chairs the production staff will play.
