        "text": "One of Marvel's big upcoming feature films is an adaptation of Thor, the giant hammer-wielding Norse warrior. And we mean big - director Matthew Vaughn (Layer Cake, Stardust) wanted a $300 million dollar budget! Although Vaughn is directing Thor, the script is being written by Mark Protosevich (The Cell, Poseidon, I Am Legend) and was recently turned into Marvel. Over at London-born Vaughn's blog on The Guardian, he says that the original draft of the script would cost $300 million to make and Marvel wants them to cut that amount in half.\n\nVaughn and Protosevich worked on the script together, and Vaughn reports on the very latest from the offices of Marvel Entertainment.\n\n\"My phone has just rung. Marvel loves the script. The only problem is that it has been costed at $300m and they ask how I am going to reduce it by $150m. I think I prefer being asked what it's like working with De Niro.\"\n\nVaughn also briefly tapped in on the script, without any details besides how they celebrated its completion - with a nice bottle of wine.\n\n\"In truth, I did not treat [screenwriter Mark Protosevich] very well as I forced him to work for the whole weekend - he is the writer on Thor, my next film, which I am directing with Marvel. The weekend was a success - we finished the script and celebrated with an '88 Palmer, and I was feeling good and ready to tackle the necessary evil of film promotion.\"\n\nThankfully I agree with this budget cut. I didn't overly enjoy Stardust, Vaughn's latest film, and I'm not a fan of Thor, nor are that many comic book readers. It may turn out to be a great movie, but Thor's following is vastly less than Spider-Man, the X-Men, or Batman. An inflated budget of $300 million would result in a mess of a superhero film this time around. Is $150 million even too much for a director who's just moving onto his third film and for a comic book superhero that isn't that big?\n\nThe photo at the top is courtesy of deviantART."
