While The Lost World wasn't as good as its predecessor, it was still better than Jurassic Park III, which was the only movie in the series not helmed by Spielberg. In June it was reported that Spielberg was actively developing an idea for another Jurassic Park movie with screenwriter Mark Protosevich and confirmed at Comic Con that a script is being written. Since then, however, Spielberg has started shooting Lincoln and reported that Robopocalypse would be his next film. So where does that leave Jurassic Park 4?\n\nThe Oscar winning filmmaker spoke with STYD today and confirmed that work is still being done to develop a third sequel to his 1993 blockbuster. Said Spielberg, \"I haven't been active in the last year because I've been so busy obviously on War Horse, Tintin and now I'm currently shooting Lincoln, but right now, it's on the schedule to bring out another Jurassic Park.\" When asked if the movie would continue the storyline from the third movie or be a reboot, the filmmaker dismissed it as \"another boring secret.\""
