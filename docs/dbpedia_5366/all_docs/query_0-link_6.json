It's all right.\n\nAll right, all right.\n\nThere you go.\n\nGive me your water and your hankie,\n\nsweetie.\n\nI think it's just a cut, but I wanna\n\nclean it anyway, okay?\n\nI'm gonna look for a way out of here.\n\n- Chris.\n\n- Yeah?\n\nThank you very much.\n\nSir, I didn't... I mean, she saved me.\n\nAre you okay?\n\nJust a bad headache.\n\nHere, finish this.\n\nOne thing we have a lot of around here\n\nis water.\n\nMy name is Nelson.\n\nElena. How bad is it?\n\nIt's very bad.\n\nWere you with someone?\n\nYeah.\n\nNot really.\n\nMy brother's in the hospital.\n\nI didn't have any money\n\nto get to New York...\n\n...so I meet this guy at a club,\n\nhe works on a ship.\n\nHe says I can bunk with him,\n\nyou know, for passage.\n\nHe was pretty nice.\n\nWhat are you doing?\n\nThinking.\n\n- You?\n\n- Thinking.\n\nWhat are we thinking about, exactly?\n\nWell, I figure this door is the way up.\n\nI'm thinking, \"What's behind it?\"\n\nHey. Easy there, fireball.\n\nWatch.\n\nConor! Hey, Conor, what are you doing?\n\nHey, Mom, this door is the way up.\n\nDon't walk off from me like that, okay?\n\n- Hey, it's the other guy.\n\n- Hey.\n\nYeah, Robert, that door is extremely\n\nhot, but it's our only choice.\n\n- Here. What do you think?\n\n- Let's give it a shot.\n\nI'm hoping it was a flash fire, but this\n\nwhole area could be superheated still, right?\n\n- You tour on a sub?\n\n- I wouldn't call it touring.\n\nGo.\n\n- Flash fire.\n\n- Good call.\n\nIt's all right.\n\n- So how long were you in the Navy?\n\n- Too long.\n\nI feel like I know your dad.\n\nHe was mayor of New York for a while.\n\nWhen I was a kid.\n\nCool.\n\nIt wasn't.\n\nAnother way up, anybody?\n\nI've been sneaking around\n\nthis ship for days. This is it.\n\n- All right, then we climb.\n\n- Is it gonna hold?\n\nIt's possible. It is steel.\n\nLook at the monkey boy.\n\nChris, what are you doing? Come back.\n\nI think it'll hold.\n\nGo easy.\n\nElena.\n\nYou're halfway there, come on.\n\nChris, wait. Come back and get Conor.\n\nConor, put your foot right where my foot is\n\nand go to Robert.\n\nThere you go. Put your hand right there.\n\nOkay, hang on. I'll grab him.\n\nGreat.\n\nYou might wanna take it easy on that.\n\n- You got him, Chris?\n\n- I got him.\n\nExcellent, excellent, excellent, yes.\n\n- You got her?\n\n- Okay. Here you go.\n\n- Okay, baby, it's your turn.\n\n- Hell, no. Lucky Larry's ready to go.\n\nWhat?\n\nOh, yeah. Right, sorry.\n\nYou know, I forgot. Big hero.\n\nRescued all those women and children\n\nfrom the fires.\n\nGot elected. Man of the people.\n\nBut you're not the boss anymore.\n\nYou quit, couldn't hack it.\n\nIf I recall correctly, you couldn't even\n\nhang onto your wife.\n\nCome on. Come on.\n\nDad. Dad, let it go, okay? Please.\n\n\"Daddy, please.\" Come on.\n\nHey, man. Hey, you got it.\n\nKnock yourself out.\n\n- It's okay.\n\n- Go ahead.\n\nA**holes, both of you.\n\nYou're right. It's okay.\n\nI'm not gonna let you bring me down\n\nwith you, not by a short hair.\n\nYou don't just get the nickname\n\nLucky Larry.\n\nYou gotta be lucky.\n\nNo!\n\nDamn it.\n\nHey, who's shooting at us?\n\nJen! Jen!\n\nGet back, get back!\n\nSo we gotta go back down one level\n\nand we find another way up.\n\nGo back down? We just came\n\nthrough there. There is no other way.\n\nYou go that way, you die.\n\nWe didn't look through every corridor.\n\nYou do what you want.\n\nI'm getting across.\n\nIf you got a better idea,\n\nI'm all ears...\n\nNo, Robert, I don't got another way,\n\nbut I'm getting across!\n\nYou get stuck here, you'll die!\n\nWe're going. Let's go.\n\n- Daddy, I can't. I'm sorry.\n\n- What?\n\n- Dylan, can you get me across?\n\n- Jen, baby girl, listen...\n\nNo! I haven't been in\n\na long time, Dad.\n\nChris asked me to marry him.\n\nI love him. I need to find a way\n\nto go with him.\n\n- No, you need to listen to me for a second.\n\n- I'm not going back, Dad.\n\nI hate to break up the family therapy,\n\nbut you still looking for a way across?\n\nYes.\n\nDo you see him? Where is he?\n\nHey, did you miss me?\n\nSon of a b*tch.\n\n- What do you need?\n\n- All right. Take the slack.\n\nGot it?\n\nHey, Ramsey! Ramsey!\n\nCome on.\n\nI did the hard part.\n\nYou couldn't even find your way home\n\nfrom school. We lived two blocks away.\n\n- I remember, Dad.\n\n- Hey, Ramsey, come on!\n\nDaddy?\n\nCome on, Jen, you'll be fine. Come on!\n\nJenny!\n\nNow, what kind of kid\n\ncan't find her way home?\n\nI was 7, by the way.\n\nSo, what do you think?\n\nYou too big for a piggyback ride?\n\n- Not today.\n\n- All right.\n\nAll right, baby. Hold on.\n\nHere we go. Hang on, baby!\n\nI gotcha.\n\nThey're okay.\n\n- You wanna hit me?\n\n- Actually...\n\n...you're doing pretty good. So far.\n\nCan we keep going here?\n\nYeah, let's go.\n\nThis way's the best way up.\n\nHurry.\n\nYou're okay.\n\nLet's go.\n\nCome on!\n\nCome on, let's go.\n\nLook for a way up, everybody.\n\n- I got an access hatch here!\n\n- Over here!\n\nDylan, we got water coming in\n\nover here!\n\nBack up!\n\n- Get back!\n\n- Wait a minute. I got something here!\n\nAll right, get that corner.\n\nWe can't all fit in there.\n\nWe don't even know where it goes.\n\nIf we stay here, we drown. Let's go!\n\nWe gotta keep moving up.\n\nOh, my God!\n\nAll right. I got a vertical shaft\n\nup ahead about 10 yards.\n\nLooks like it leads to the upper levels.\n\n- Chris?\n\n- Might as well give him a chance...\n\n...to kick me in the head.\n\n- Come on, Chris!\n\nWe're good. The shaft leads up.\n\n- Are you okay, sweetheart?\n\n- I think so.\n\nJust keep on moving.\n\nGod. How the hell\n\ndid you fit through here?\n\nMom, don't look down, okay?\n\n- Okay, Nelson, you're next.\n\n- Okay.\n\n- I'll be the last one. You go.\n\n- Elena, just get in the vent.\n\n- I'll wait here a little longer.\n\n- You're fine.\n\n- I can't go in there. I'm sorry, I can't!\n\n- Elena, get in the vent.\n\nThe water's rising.\n\nElena, get in the vent!\n\n- Elena, if you don't go, we don't go.\n\n- What? What?\n\nNo! No!\n\nGo on, go! Grab her, grab her!\n\nYou got her?\n\nIt seems congratulations are in order,\n\nChris.\n\nThank you, sir.\n\nI'm glad she finally told you.\n\nWell, tradition might have had you\n\ncoming to me first.\n\nYeah, I realize that.\n\nAnd I wanted to, I really did, but she\n\nmade me promise not to say anything.\n\nShe's really careful\n\nwhen it comes to you, sir.\n\n- Let me out! Let me out!\n\n- Come on, Elena.\n\n- You're doing great. Come on.\n\n- Elena, take my foot!\n\nGrab my ankle.\n\nThat's it. That's it. That's it.\n\n- You can do it. That's it, just hold on.\n\n- I can't breathe.\n\nNo.\n\nElena?\n\nWe're gonna go up now.\n\nOh, my God. Oh, my God.\n\nI'm stuck!\n\nOh, my God. He's stuck.\n\nPlease, get me out! Get me out!\n\n- Get me out, out, out!\n\n- Hey, calm down, calm down.\n\nGet me out of here.\n\nElena, you need to reach up\n\nand help him.\n\nI need you to reach up and help him.\n\nReach up.\n\n- Conor.
