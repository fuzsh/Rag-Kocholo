        "text": "Director Wolfgang Petersen has conjured up the kind of bad-vibrations wall of water in \"Poseidon\" that you'd expect from a man who made \"Das Boot\" and \"The Perfect Storm.\" But to hear Petersen tell it, his \"Poseidon\" remake, which opens today, isn't about the rogue wave as much as the decisions it forces the movie's characters to make. After the water hits and the boat rolls over, some 500 people are trapped inside the cruise ship's ballroom.\n\nThe captain says help is on the way. Most of the passengers believe him.\n\nObviously they didn't see 1972's \"Poseidon Adventure.\"\n\nPetersen, a self-described coward, admits he'd stay inside the ballroom and wait for rescue. (\"I'd be dead right now,\" he says.) We spoke to the movie's primary cast members, asking, in the immortal words of the Clash, would you stay or would you go, as well as delving into their fears, underwater experiences and thoughts on the original movie.\n\nHere's what they had to say:\n\nKURT RUSSELL\n\nCharacter: Robert Ramsey, firefighter hero, onetime mayor of New York, overly protective father of teenage daughter Jennifer Ramsey\n\nCorresponding \"Poseidon Adventure\" actor: Gene Hackman\n\nBiggest fear -- fire, drowning, electrocution or falling:\n\n\"Electrocution is the least. That hits you so hard, you don't know nothing. Falling could actually be a spectacular last thing to experience. Fire would be really painful, and drowning is excruciating to a certain point. Fire.\" Waterlogged moment: \"There's a scene where I'm underwater a long time, which means I had to entrust myself to someone to come in and give me air at exactly the right moment. That's spooky stuff. I wanted to see what the experience was like, but, psychologically, that's hard to do . . . letting go and trusting that you won't drown.\n\nThe third time, when the guy swam out and put the regulator in my mouth, I don't remember it. I was that close to the edge.\"\n\nWould you stay or would you go? \"If there had been some kind of safety meeting beforehand, and someone said, `In case of rogue wave, remain in ballroom, everything will be fine,' I'd wait in the room.\n\nBut they didn't, and when I hear an architect say, `This room isn't going to stay airtight,' I'd be out of there. I'd follow my instincts: `Let's go for a swim.' \"\n\n\"Poseidon Adventure\" -- camp or classic? \"I was 21, so what I remember is Pamela Sue Martin in that little short dress. She looked pretty good. But the movie . . . it ain't `Casablanca,' put it that way.\"\n\nJOSH LUCAS\n\nCharacter: Dylan Johns, professional gambler\n\nCorresponding \"Poseidon Adventure\" actor: Ernest Borgnine, but a little better looking. (OK, a lot.)\n\nBiggest fear -- fire, drowning, electrocution or falling: \"When I was 9 years old, I caught a pot of hot, boiling water and had third-degree burns over 30 percent of my body. I begged them to let me die, and I was not even close. But the pain was so insane.\n\nSo there's no doubt it would be fire.\"\n\nWaterlogged moment: \"One day, I'm swimming underwater -- the cameras couldn't see me because I was coming around the corner -- and got caught on a wire that was holding one of the dead bodies. I could not get out and I panicked, thinking, `I'm gonna die on this film.' So I ripped my costume violently, came up, got my breath and started screaming at Wolfgang, `You only get one take! That's all you get now! It's too dangerous!' And of course, Wolfgang with his charm and passion, had me in the water again in 10 minutes.\"\n\nWould you stay or would you go? \"I would never trust my personal safety in a disaster situation based on what someone else is saying.\n\nLook at Katrina. No way. I'd be out of there.\"\n\n\"Poseidon Adventure\" -- camp or classic? \"It's a cheesefest with a fantastic performance in the middle of it with Gene Hackman. I wonder if he rewrote all his dialogue because no one else seems to be on the same page. There's nothing violent or scary about any moment in the movie at all.\"\n\nRICHARD DREYFUSS\n\nCharacter: Richard Nelson, a gay man suicidal after a painful breakup.\n\nCorresponding \"Poseidon Adventure\" actor: \"I think I'm the Shelley Winters/Red Buttons combo. I wasn't going to wear Shelley Winters' dress, but I think I stand in pretty well.\"\n\nBiggest fear -- fire, drowning, electrocution or falling: \"Oy gevalt!\n\nUm . . . all of them are pretty much worse than sleep. Sleeping yourself to death, that's what I want to do.\"\n\nWaterlogged moment: \"I'm not a physical guy. I'm pretty lazy, and I like to sit around and watch television most of the time. But I knew I could swim until the cows came home. I couldn't climb up stairs as much, but I'm a good swimmer. I enjoyed that.\"\n\nWould you stay or would you go? \"That's really the question.\n\nThat's a tough one. I think there are two kinds of patients: When the doctor says something, you nod, or you ask, `What do you mean?' That's what those characters are in the movie. I used to be a nodder. Now I'm different. But I don't think you know what you'd do until you're there.\"\n\n\"Poseidon Adventure\" -- camp or classic? \"It's one of those movies you think you've seen more than once because you remember it all. I worked with Gene Hackman many years later, and I said to him, 'You had the privilege of saying probably the toughest line in the history of movies.' And he said, 'What line was that?' And I said, `I'm the new kind of minister. Angry. Rebellious. Questioning.' That's the toughest line I've ever heard. Gene laughed.\"\n\nJACINDA BARRETT\n\nCharacter: Maggie James, young mother protecting precocious son\n\nCorresponding \"Poseidon Adventure\" actor: Pamela Sue Martin\n\nBiggest fear -- fire, drowning, electrocution or falling: \"Falling . . . there's some sense of freedom in that. But drowning is being trapped, and that would be horrible. Making this movie keyed into my fears.\"\n\nWaterlogged moment: \"There was one scene that lasts about a minute in the film but took 10 days to shoot. And we were in a really confined space, and everybody got sick because the water is warm and started getting really dirty. 'The Poseidon Grunge,' everybody called it.\"\n\nWould you stay or would you go? \"Of course, in retrospect, you say, `I'd go up.' But the captain is telling you to stay, it's safe, and you'd think the captain knows something about the ship. Of course, they initially told the people in the towers to stay on 9/11.\"\n\n\"Poseidon Adventure\" -camp or classic? \"It's so different. (The original is) definitely not as gruesome. There's so many corpses in this one.\n\nIt's so hard-core. Outside of Gene Hackman's death, you didn't really have that in the first one.\"\n\nEMMY ROSSUM\n\nCharacter: Jennifer Ramsey, headstrong daughter of Kurt Russell's Robert Ramsey\n\nCorresponding \"Poseidon Adventure\" actor: No close match. Certainly not Shelley Winters.\n\nBiggest fear -- fire, drowning, electrocution or falling: \"Do I have to choose? Probably drowning because I know so much about it now. But I discovered that I have pretty strong lung capacity because of my vocal training. So hopefully it will never come to that.\"\n\nWaterlogged moment: \"My top was floating up, floating down. At some point, they asked, 'Do you want to lose your jeans, because it's tough to swim in jeans, and I was like, 'Ummmm . . . I'm fine keeping the jeans on.' When the movie came out, I didn't want people to be focused on lots of leg and . . . you know.\"\n\nWould you stay or would you go? \"If my loved ones were staying, I'd stay. If they were going, I'd go. Group decision. You have to stay with the people you love, one way or another.\"\n\n\"Poseidon Adventure\" -- camp or classic? \"I still haven't seen it. I never saw 'Phantom of the Opera' either, and that was a straight adaptation. This was its own thing, but I don't like even the thought of being influenced.\""
