        "text": "Michael B. Jordan recently told People that the script for “I Am Legend 2” is still being written and he’s currently not privy to any filming start date at this time. A sequel to Will Smith’s 2007 blockbuster was first announced in March 2022, with Smith set to return opposite new cast member Jordan. Akiva Goldsman, who co-wrote “I Am Legend” with Mark Protosevich, was back to pen the sequel’s script.\n\n“We’re still working on the script and getting that up to par,” Jordan told People. “It doesn’t have a release date or anything like that. I’m not sure exactly where we’re going to be filming that one, but I’m really excited to get in front of the camera with him. Being somebody that I’ve looked up to for a really long time, to be able to work with Will is something I’m really looking forward to. I’m really excited.”\n\nMore from Variety\n\nNew Movies Out Now in Theaters: What to See This Week\n\n'Bad Boys: Ride or Die' Review: Will Smith and Martin Lawrence Make the Franchise's Fourth Entry Tastier Than It Has Any Right to Be\n\nAs 'Bad Boys 4' Hits Box Office, Are Moviegoers Ready to Embrace Will Smith After Oscars Slap?\n\nSmith himself told Entertainment Tonight last month that the sequel is “looking good,” adding: “[We have some] really solid ideas… I think [Michael and I are] going to make it on screen together. That dude is the truth, so I would love to do that.”\n\nDirected by Francis Lawrence, “I Am Legend” starred Smith as virologist Robert Neville, the sole survivor in New York City of a man-made plague that transforms humans into bloodthirsty mutants. His mission to find a cure brings him into contact with other survivors. The movie opened at the top of the domestic box office with a then-December record of $77 million and went on to earn more than $585 million worldwide.\n\nAt the Red Sea International Film Festival earlier this year, Smith confirmed that “I Am Legend 2” would utilize the 2007 movie’s alternate ending in which his character lived. The movie’s theatrical release ended with the character’s death.\n\n“I have a call with Michael B. Jordan tomorrow. We’re really close, script just came in,” Smith said at the time of the “I Am Legend” sequel. “You have to be a real ‘I Am Legend’ buff to know this, but in the first, theatrical version, my character dies, but on the DVD there was an alternate version of the ending where my character lived. We are going with the mythology of the DVD version. I can’t tell you anything more, but Michael B. Jordan is in.”\n\nIt appears the “I Am Legend 2” script needs a bit more work.\n\nBest of Variety\n\nNew Movies Out Now in Theaters: What to See This Week\n\nWhat's Coming to Disney+ in June 2024\n\nWhat's Coming to Netflix in June 2024"
