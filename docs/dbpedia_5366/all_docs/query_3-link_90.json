        "text": "Paramount's new sci-fi film, Collider, will bring together several of the genre's biggest names. According to Deadline, Edgar Wright (Shaun of the Dead, Hott Fuzz and Scott Pilgrim vs the World) will direct the film, as well as co-write the script with Mark Protosevich (I Am Legend, Thor and the upcoming Jurassic Park IV). The film will be produced by Wright, Nira Park and J.J. Abrams.\n\nNo synopsis for the title is available, and it's safe to assume we won't be seeing it for a while given how busy all those guys' schedules are.\n\nProtosevich has just finished scripting Oldboy, Spike Lee's upcoming project, while Wright is finally about to rejoin Nick Frost and Simon Pegg to film the final part of the Blood and Ice Cream Trilogy, The World's End.\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nLuke Karmali is IGN's UK Editorial Assistant. You too can revel in mediocrity by following him on IGN and on Twitter."
