        "text": "Wolfgang Petersen, the director of “Das Boot” and “The Perfect Storm,” is back in the water. In “Poseidon,” a remake of “The Poseidon Adventure,” the German-born Petersen swamps a ship, sends rivets popping, and washes away furniture, crockery, and corpses in a foamy digital flood. What is it with this guy and the sea? Something prenatal, perhaps. I don’t know that anyone was longing for a new version of the campy disaster “classic” from 1972. Real disasters have recently taken hold of our imagination—and of our movies, too. After you’ve seen “United 93,” it’s hard to regard “Poseidon” as anything more than an extremely well-crafted exercise in physical invention and fear. Yet within those limits—the limits of a pop-digital survival drama—“Poseidon” is an exciting show. Petersen appears both to love water and to be intensely afraid of it; he may not have anything fresh to say, but he’s wrung an infinite variety of physical sensations out of his obsession.\n\nThree decades ago, the producer Irwin Allen, an indefatigable marketer of cinematic destruction, entertained an innocent public with such spectacles as “The Towering Inferno” and “The Swarm.” In “The Poseidon Adventure,” his most famous extravaganza, a giant wave hits a luxury passenger vessel, which turns turtle and slowly begins to sink. Gene Hackman, as a priest who doesn’t believe in waiting for God’s help, takes charge of the worst group of neurotics ever gathered together in an upside-down ocean liner, and leads them upward to the hull. Most of the performances, as orchestrated by Ronald Neame, the director, border on the excruciating. Stella Stevens, paired up with the noisy Ernest Borgnine, plays a snarly ex-hooker stripped down to her panties; the late Shelley Winters squeezes her complaining flesh through narrow corridors, sighing and moaning right up to the moment where she dives in and swims underwater for what seems an eternity, and saves the day. Like many cult favorites, “The Poseidon Adventure” is mad and silly and Hollywoodish—an escape drama that pauses frequently for sermons, quarrels, and bouts of bizarre overacting. The movie is truly effective only when it sticks to the sinister oddity of a topsy-turvy world—such as when a little boy wanders into an inverted men’s room and sees gaping urinals hanging high up on the walls.\n\nOne of the disappointing things about the original “Poseidon” was that the wave hitting the ship wasn’t much—children splashing a boat in the tub could do as well. But this time the water really comes thundering down, and, throughout the movie, Petersen has a dynamic feel for the rush and heave of the deluge, the pent-up energy, the sheer heft and momentum. Even more than James Cameron in “Titanic,” the man is a master of the studio water tank: the monster that pushes and threatens and finally comes bursting through the wall to get you is more dangerous than any creature. And, when the ship keels over, the inexorable sliding of people and tables—at first slow, and then faster and faster—produces a form of vertigo that alternates between hilarity and terror.\n\nUnwilling to waste time, Petersen, working with Mark Protosevich’s terse screenplay, rushes through the opening expository stuff. He moves ahead so rapidly that he momentarily forgoes garden-variety plausibility: after the ship overturns, the principal characters quickly and inexplicably gather at one side of a crowded ballroom. They act as if they had seen the original movie, and, on the spot, they decide to trust Josh Lucas, who plays the inspirational Hackman role—that’s Josh Lucas, whose rakish smile and quicksilver temper make him perhaps the least trustworthy-looking actor in movies today. Lucas plays a poker-table hustler who mysteriously possesses the precise skills required to lead people through passageways littered with burned bodies and broken electric lines hissing and snapping like cobras. His followers include Kurt Russell, in a poorly written part, as an authoritarian former mayor of New York; Emmy Rossum as his rebellious daughter; and Richard Dreyfuss as an aging gay man jilted by his longtime lover. In the course of their adventures, the usual character conflicts—Will Russell respect his daughter’s young fiancé? Will Dreyfuss find a reason to go on living?—get resolved. But, thank God, the characters don’t stop to “develop.” Saying as little as possible, they define themselves in action. Into the air ducts they go.\n\nIn the first movie, Allen and Neame kept us inside the maze. But Petersen repeatedly goes back outside and looks at the huge craft, shifting and groaning, hull up, as water rushes into ballast chambers and brings the beast ever deeper. We need these outside views, if only to better appreciate the progress of the survivors within. Mashed, whomped in the face with exploding hatches, bloodied, gargled again and again, the actors give a good impression of going through hell, and they look genuinely the worse for wear. Their eyes bulge, they go hoarse, they are badly mussed. The cinematographer, John Seale, has illuminated the movie from where the light source should be, on the floor (which was the ceiling), so that some of the faces and bodies have a supernal glow, like the figures in an old religious painting. Wolfgang Petersen may have water on the brain, but he gets the audience to feel whatever it is that’s roiling his unconscious.\n\nWhen a man falls in love with a woman he’s watching in a movie, and the hero of that movie doesn’t respond to the woman the way he should, the man feels that he himself has been romantically betrayed, thinking, What’s wrong with this idiot? Is he blind? That was my response to Romain Duris’s long spell of indifference to the wonderful Kelly Reilly in the new French comedy “Russian Dolls,” and it took me a while to realize that the director, Cédric Klapisch, expects the audience to respond exactly the way that I did. Duris plays Xavier, a thirtyish cipher, who, along with Reilly’s character, Wendy, was one of the roommates in Klapisch’s 2002 movie, “L’Auberge Espagnole.” In that friendly, lightweight fable of the European Union, seven young people from all over the Continent spend a year together in a Barcelona flat. At the end of “L’Auberge,” Xavier returns home to Paris. In the new movie, set five years later, his life has become a pointless mess. A hack journalist and screenwriter, he doesn’t seem to know what he wants to write (he has taste but no apparent interests), or who he is, or which woman he wants to make love to. He drifts from bed to bed without much pleasure. Sent to London to write a pedestrian TV movie, he teams up with Wendy, who is now a screenwriter herself. Wendy has love troubles of her own; she can’t seem to rid herself of her addiction to a shaggy lout. Lots of actresses don’t seem to respond personally to the actors they work with, but the long-limbed, red-headed Reilly, who was born in Surrey in 1977, and has been active on the London stage as well as in movies, engages each man she meets onscreen with her face, her body, her breathing. Around Duris, she has a way of lowering her eyes in shame which grabs at your heart. Eventually, Wendy hooks up with Xavier, but he runs back to a narcissistic model with pouty lips whom he’s been seeing, the cad.\n\n“Russian Dolls” is framed as a backward-looking narrative. On the highspeed Paris-London train, Xavier, writing on a laptop (he has to power up in the restroom), composes a story of his recent love affairs and friendships, including his betrayal of Wendy. His relationships blow up in an instant: in one, he holds a girl’s hand until they wind up in bed, and, after a quarrel, she runs stark naked out onto the Paris streets, and he, also naked, runs after her. The moment is frivolous in a lyrical way that’s irresistible. “Russian Dolls” offers touristic views of London, Paris, and St. Petersburg, where Wendy and Xavier both go for the wedding of another former roommate, and many pretty faces and bodies; it’s froth with a sprinkling of earnest reflection. Duris, who was mesmerizing last year as the jittery dynamo split between classical music and crime in “The Beat That My Heart Skipped,” is sheepish here. His big head and thick thatch of hair, combined with his trim body, make him look like an overgrown boy who’s puzzled about everything. Xavier’s producers tell him that his scripts need romantic fantasy, but his own experience tells him that romance, in real life, is a mess, a comedy, even a disaster. Klapisch fashions the dénouement as an ironic joke: love, he suggests, has to embrace fantasy and even cliché at a certain point or it’s not quite love. People must declare themselves, just as lovers in a lousy movie do: the man and the woman must kiss at the back of a boat with all of St. Petersburg arrayed around them. The only way Xavier can find himself is to realize that the woman he has treated so badly is the only woman for him. It’s not as if we couldn’t have told him so. ♦"
