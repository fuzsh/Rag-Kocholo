        "text": "A new Flash Gordon film has been in and out of development for several years. It's a movie I'd love to see happen, as I think it could be a huge sweeping sci-fi epic. The last thing we heard about the movie is that Kingsman: The Secret Service director Matthew Vaughn was in talks to direct, and it sounds like he's attached to the project.\n\nAccording to AICN, 20th Century Fox has hired Thor screenwriter Mark Protosevich to write the script for Vaughn. They go on to say that \"this will not be like any version of Flash Gordon we've seen on film before.\"\n\nI'm a huge fan of Flash Gordon, and I'm completely excited for the prospect of what this movie could be. I would absolutely love it if captured the amazing tone and style of artist Alex Raymond, who is the creator of Flash Gordon.\n\nIt was previously rumored that this new movie could serve as a sequel to the classic 1980 film. That information originated from original Flash Gordon movie star Sam J. Jones, and you can read all about it here.\n\nProtosevich isn't the only writer who has been attached to this project. Star Trek 3 writers JD Payne and Patrick McKay came on board last year, but I guess that didn't quite work out. Protosevich has also worked on films such as The Cell, Poseidon, I Am Legend, and the Oldboy remake.\n\nHopefully, Fox is finally able to push Flash Gordon into production. With Vaughn on board, I know fans will get something awesome."
