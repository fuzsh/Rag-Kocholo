        "text": "Mark Protosevich is an American screenwriter. Protosevich wrote Batman Unchained under the direction of Joel Schumacher. The script was completed before Batman & Robin was released, but due to the critical reaction to the fourth movie it was cancelled.\n\nProtosevich is known for exploring characters who are alone and psychologically tortured with movies like The Cell, I Am Legend and the Oldboy remake.[1] To date the screenplay has never appeared online, Protosevich has only described elements of the script in a handful of interviews.\n\nThe Batman: DarKnight script by by Lee Shapiro and Stephen Wise explored similar themes also using Scarecrow as the main villain. Unlike Unchained the published screenplay is widely available as an Amazon book.\n\nReferences"
