        "text": "Back in 1972, Gene Hackman led his fellow oceanfaring travelers through a struggle of life and death on a capsized passenger liner. A remake of that successful movie was announced about two months ago, and now Mark Protosevich has been chosen to write the new adventure.\n\nProtosevich first met Hollywood success with The Cell, which he both wrote and co-produced. He also wrote the much-talked-about script for I Am Legend, a vampire film that Steven Spielberg and Arnold Schwarzenegger were interested in making at one time. Unfortunately, I Am Legend was sidelined, but Warner Brothers is giving the promising writer another go with The Poseidon Adventure.\n\nThe modern-day remake will feature a new cast of characters, again fighting to survive after their ship, the Poseidon, is struck and capsized by a tidal wave.\n\nNo release date for The Poseidon Adventure has been set yet, and no director is attached at this time. Wolfgang Peterson (Das Boot, Troy) and Mike Fleiss (TV's The Bachelor, Texas Chainsaw Massacre) are producing the picture."
