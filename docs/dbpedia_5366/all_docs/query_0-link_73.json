Well, maybe ''Mission: Impossible III.'' And, for that matter, ''RV,'' ''Failure to Launch,'' ''Rumor Has it,'' ''The Pink Panther,'' ''Bewitched,'' ''The Dukes of Hazzard,'' and  you know what? Just forget I said anything.     Anyway, Mr. Petersen's ''Poseidon'' is unlikely to replace the original in the hearts of action-hungry moviegoers, though it will probably expunge the memory of the earlier, made-for-TV remake (and also, perhaps, of the 1979 sequel, ''Beyond the Poseidon Adventure''). The hard-working cast does a lot of screaming, climbing and death-defying in soaking-wet evening wear, but they can hardly hope to match the ripe absurdity of Shelley Winters, Red Buttons and -- in one of the great plug-ugly he-man overacting contests ever committed to celluloid -- Gene Hackman and Ernest Borgnine.",

        "text": "IT'S hard to think of a big-budget Hollywood picture with less reason for existing than \"Poseidon,\" Wolfgang Petersen's remake of \"The Poseidon Adventure,\" Ronald Neame's much-derided, much-beloved 1972 disaster-kitsch classic based on a Paul Gallico novel. Well, maybe \"Mission: Impossible III.\" And, for that matter, \"RV,\" \"Failure to Launch,\" \"Rumor Has it,\" \"The Pink Panther,\" \"Bewitched,\" \"The Dukes of Hazzard,\" and you know what? Just forget I said anything.\n\nAnyway, Mr. Petersen's \"Poseidon\" is unlikely to replace the original in the hearts of action-hungry moviegoers, though it will probably expunge the memory of the earlier, made-for-TV remake (and also, perhaps, of the 1979 sequel, \"Beyond the Poseidon Adventure\"). The hard-working cast does a lot of screaming, climbing and death-defying in soaking-wet evening wear, but they can hardly hope to match the ripe absurdity of Shelley Winters, Red Buttons and -- in one of the great plug-ugly he-man overacting contests ever committed to celluloid -- Gene Hackman and Ernest Borgnine.\n\nOh, well. The original, like other specimens of its period and genre, mixed dinner-theater histrionics with stunts and explosions, rising to a campy, earnest grandeur that today's technology-driven, committee-made products rarely attempt, let alone achieve.\n\nThat said, Mr. Petersen is pretty good at digital and mechanical showmanship, as well as something of a specialist in maritime distress, having made his name with \"Das Boot\" 25 years ago and returned to the sea in 2000 with \"The Perfect Storm.\" Accordingly, he approaches \"Poseidon\" as a series of problems in applied physics, subjecting various liquids and solids to a series of extreme thermodynamic and gravitational tests.\n\nA good deal of seat-of-the-pants engineering savvy is also required of the characters in the film, who must respond to a disaster that strikes their cruise ship in the early hours of the new year, right after toasts have been made, songs sung (by Fergie of the Black Eyed Peas) and expository dialogue delivered.\n\nIn due course we meet the designated survivors (though in some cases the designation will of course be temporary). Kurt Russell plays Robert Ramsey, a protective dad whose daughter, Jennifer (Emmy Rossum), is on board with her boyfriend, Christian (Mike Vogel). Robert's foil -- the Borgnine to his Hackman, or the reverse -- is Dylan Johns (Josh Lucas), a professional gambler who was once in the Navy.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
