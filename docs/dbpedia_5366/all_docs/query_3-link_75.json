        "text": "Here's a geek-friendly combination that's sure to get fanboys' and fangirls' attention: Deadline is reporting that Paramount Pictures has hired I Am Legend writer Mark Protosevich to pen the screenplay for a movie called Collider, which originated in the mind of Shaun of the Dead helmer Edgar Wright. And if that weren't enough, Star Trek director J.J. Abrams is collaborating on this, too, producing the film under his Bad Robot banner. As with most Abrams projects, though, details are hard to come by. All we know so far is that the movie is going to be some kind of science fiction film, but what could it be about? Read on!\n\nScience fiction fits in well with the filmographies of Protosevich and Abrams, and it's a cool change of pace for Wright, who hasn't delved into that genre quite yet. Of course, his upcoming The World's End sounds like it has a bit of a hidden sci-fi twist to it anyway. But even though Wright is a busy guy right now with The World's End in pre-production and his upcoming Ant-Man movie seemingly officially announced by Marvel at Comic-Con, Wright is still taking this project on as director. It's interesting that Abrams by way of Bad Robot is involved, considering he beat Wright for the directing gig on Mission: Impossible 3, but there's obviously no bad blood between the two since they're now working together on this.\n\nBad Robot has more sci-fi on the brain with God Particle and Micronauts in various stages of development, but the Wright-Protosevich-Abrams combo sounds almost too good to be true. If they can find a director who's equally talented, then this has the potential to be something really special for sci-fi fans.\n\nUpdate: The story has been updated on Deadline with quite a major revision: \"Edgar Wright will direct the film, and he is co-writing the script with I Am Legend's Mark Protosevich.\" But, when? Between The World's End and Ant-Man, who knows when he'll get to this, but it's another project on Wright's slate following The World's End, which starts shooting this fall. Stay tuned for any more updates."
