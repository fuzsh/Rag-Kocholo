        "text": "Legendary Entertainment is continuing work on the Mass Effect film, but Thor and I Am Legend screenplay writer Mark Protosevich is no longer attached. Variety reports that Protosevich has been replaced by newcomer Morgan Davis Foehl.\n\nFoehl has never had a script produced, but did serve as assistant editor on FX television show Rescue Me, as well as Adam Sandler comedies I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry and Click.\n\nAccording to the report, producers at Legendary Entertainment were drawn to Foehl because he is a self-admitted Mass Effect fan and has experience writing scripts similar to the general Mass Effect plot."
