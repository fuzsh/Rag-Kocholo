        "meta_description": "The high-octane thriller that inspired the Academy Award&#8211;winning film: On a sinking cruise ship, passengers fight rising water&#8212;and each other&#8212;to survive.     On its maiden voyage, luxury ocean liner SS  Poseidon  is capsized by a massive undersea earthquake. A handful of survivors must fight for their lives&#8212;struggling to make it from the upper deck of the ship to the hull, the only part above water, before the ship sinks. Faced with rising water and the violence of desperate passengers and crewmembers, the group must do everything it can to survive&#8212;before time runs out. Adapted into an award-winning film by Irwin Allen,  The Poseidon Adventure  is a thrilling tale with timeless suspense and excitement.",
