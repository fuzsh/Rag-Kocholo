        "text": "You know, when it comes to upside-down-sinking-ship films, it's all about The Poseidon Adventure. The 1972 original saw a cruise ship capsized by a tidal wave, forcing a plucky band of survivors to make their way up / down through the ship to find a way out through the hull. As with all good things, it's now being remade, as we reported here, with Wolfgang Petersen now in the director's chair as well as producing. Now the cast has started to board the film, and a rather tasty line-up it is too. The legend that is Kurt Russell has signed on to play an ex-fireman turned mayor, who's traveling with his teenage daughter and her boyfriend. Clearly Russell fans are in for a treat over the next few months, with upcoming appearances for the erstwhile Snake Plisken in Sky High and Dreamer: Inspired By A True Story coming soon. Emmy Rossum is following her role in disaster movie The Day After Tomorrow and sort-of disaster movie The Phantom of the Opera by getting all wet all over again as the teenage daughter, and playing her boyfriend is Mike Vogel, who you may or may not remember from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake. He's also got a role in the upcoming Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants, the best-titled film of the year, so expect to see him on a thousand teenagers' bedroom walls very soon. Joining them is Richard Dreyfuss, who's been spending most of his time on the stage recently, apart from small roles in the likes of Silver City, but will be playing a gay man whose relationship has broken up just before the ship sailed. Homicide: Life on the Street's Andre Braugher is in talks to play the ship's captain. The screenplay is by Mark Protosevich and Akiva Goldsman and is based on Paul Gallico's novel. Filming is due to start in less than two weeks on the Warners lot, with a release date pencilled in for May 5 next year. However, the film will have some competition, as Steve Guttenberg, Adam Baldwin and Rutger Hauer are starring in a TV movie based on the original novel. Tough choice"
