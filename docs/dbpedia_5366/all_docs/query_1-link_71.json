        "text": "\"Nothing happened the way it was supposed to happen. We are seeing mutations. Cannibalistic hunger. Typical human behavior is now entirely absent.\"\n\nMost audiences will predict a few elements of this tense and emotional experience, but Will Smith’s tour de force performance (similar to Tom Hanks' in Cast Away) and high level of audience involvement still produce a great film. The strong themes include family, hope, perseverance and, most importantly, survival.\n\nWill Smith again shows this considerable talent holding the screen all by himself for the majority of the picture as Army officer Robert Neville. He thrives on the theatrical set-up of each scene on all levels. He encounters situations reeking of fate and purpose, which yield strong reactions from the characters and audience.\n\nA charismatic actor who can switch from hunter to scientist to resourceful survivor in a heartbeat while echoing his previous performances – his necessary physical training (I, Robot), steadfastness against overwhelming odds (Ali) and realistic sentiments (Pursuit of Happyness) provide his obvious motivations. These roots produce great results while sustaining the plot right until the very end. Smith certainly won’t get an Oscar nomination for his performance because action thrillers are rarely recognized (definitely if there was a category for best athletic performance), but continues to prove his worth as one of Hollywood's most talented actors.\n\nRobert’s canine companion, Sam, also takes top dog in one of the most emotional connections with audiences since Old Yeller. Other actors, especially Alice Braga, do a great job filling in the holes of Richard’s past, present, and future, but it’s the startling scenery that wins the bronze medal in this film. You can’t determine if backgrounds have been matted in while filmmakers create several authentic action sequences where Smith looks like he’s taking the fall and the ending hit… literally. The seamless special effects create a bleak, realistic canvas that makes Neville’s quest even more emotional.\n\nScreenwriters Akiva Goldsman (Cinderella Man, Practical Magic) and Mark Protosevich (Poseidon, The Cell) adapt this 1954 Richard Matheson novel well while stripping down several scenes to the basic human functions. This surprisingly basic format lets the audience enjoy a largely non-manipulative ride where they can inject their own thoughts into the visuals. Screenwriters put great continuity into the script as every presented element ties together well. The film may warrant repeat viewings for some interesting billboards and other environmental elements viewers might not pick up the first time through. Not a good enough reason? Reliving the passionate experience is also recommended because you get a better perspective of Neville’s motivations after the first viewing, which emotionally depleted most viewers in my sold out theater.\n\nThe antagonist mutations, seeking human elimination for their own survival, might come off as remediated zombie/vampire hybrids, but consider the original 1954 source material. Filmmakers do not show two of the most graphic scenes, which are also the most emotional — and they don't have to. Less visual is more, especially when lives are at stake. The plot manipulates emotions at times as filmmakers know when to hold the brakes and add a little humor to the plot during the tense moments. It's also nice to see a film that presents the “end of the world” danger without a bunch of government officials pacing around as they ponder their dramatic decisions."
