Of the nearly 290,000 votes by the inhabitants on the Internet, 75% (215,530 votes) went to \"Grand Est\", ahead of \"Nouvelle Austrasie\" (10.4%, or 29906 votes), 9.8% for Rhin-Champagne (9.8%, or 28080 votes) and 4.8% for Acalie (4.8%, or 13,904 votes).

The logo appeared on comumnication items: kakemonos, streamers...

Gules a bend sinister cotised fleury argent (Lower Alsace), 2. Gules a bend between six crowns bendwise or (Upper Alsace)\".\n\nThese arms are based on the Alsatian arms, already documented in the 16th century but hardly used since then.\n\nInstead of the two confronted bends of the traditional arms, the new arms have kept only the white bend representing Lower-Alsace. The crowns representing Upper-Alsace are now placed on both sides of the white coticed bend.\n\nThese arms have been designed and used by the Regional Council since the 1990s.\n\nThe new flag is hoisted over the building of the Regional Council of Alsace in Strasbourg. Beforehand, the Regional Council used the flag of the traditional province of Alsace.\n\nPascal Vagnat, 21 February 2004\n\nFlag of the former Region Alsace; left, after 2007; right, before 2007 - Images by Olivier Touzeau, 5 September 2017\n\nWhite flags with the Regional Council's logo (photo) were sometimes used in the 1990s and onwards.\n\nOlivier Touzeau, 5 September 2017\n\nFormer Region Champagne-Ardenne\n\nAdministrative data\n\nDepartments: Ardennes, Aube, Marne, Haute-Marne\n\nBordering Regions: Bourgogne, Franche-Comté, Île-de-France, Lorraine, Picardie\n\nBordering country: Belgium\n\nTraditional provinces: Bourgogne, Champagne, Franche-Comté, Lorraine\n\nArea: 25,606 km2\n\nPopulation (1995): 1,352,500 inhabitants\n\nRegional prefecture: Châlons-en-Champagne\n\nFlag of the Region\n\nFlag of the former Region Champagne-Ardenne, three versions - Images by Philippe-Pierre Darras, 18 January 1999\n\nCreated in 1987, the logo of the Region shows two yellow and green hearts entwined. In a Region without much of a strong common identity between its constituent departments, they symbolize the union through which a feeling of regional identity should develop. Yellow and green stand for the Region's ressources: yellow for vineyards, champagne and the cornfields as well as for the Region prestigious past; green conveys the idea that Champagne-Ardenne nature is rich in forests and rivers.\n\nPhilippe-Pierre Darras, 18 January 1999\n\nFlag of the former Region Champagne-Ardenne; left, 2011-2016; right, before 2011 - Images by Olivier Touzeau, 6 September 2017\n\nThe flag was also used with the full version of the logotype of the Regional Council (photo, Regional Council).\n\nEarlier flag of the former Region Champagne-Ardenne - Image by Olivier Touzeau, 6 September 2017\n\nBefore 1987, the flag was white with a totally different logo (Luc Doublet.

The reason for the substitution of is the misuse of the former logo, not connected enough to the regional institution in several cases.\n\nThe logo was designed by CharlÉlie Couture, a French artist (singer, painter, photogaph, writer) born in Nancy.\n\nFormer flag of Region Lorraine with horizontal logo - Image by Olivier Touzeau, 9 February 2021\n\nA flag with horizontal logo (photo, photo, photo) was used in Vauquois.\n\nEarlier flag of Region Lorraine - Image by Olivier Touzeau, 7 September 2017\n\nBeforehand, the flag was white with a totally different logo (Luc Doublet.
