        "text": "The Rich History of Alsace\n\nMost of Alsace, including the major city of Strasbourg, had become recognised as being part of France by the end of the 17th century.\n\nHowever, the area retained a strong Germanic-Alsatian culture including its own language. It was also able to retain much of its own legal status that differed from that of France proper.\n\nDuring the 19th century parts of the region became economically prosperous due to industrialisation, but it became increasingly subject to tensions between the rising power of Prussia and that of France. In the Franco-Prussian war of 1870, France was totally defeated and Alsace passed into the newly-formed Germany, where it remained until 1919 and the end of the First World War.\n\nAfter 1919 and its return, successive French governments made concerted efforts to enforce the French language and culture onto the local population, though the area did become administered again by Germany after its occupation under the Nazis 1940-45."
