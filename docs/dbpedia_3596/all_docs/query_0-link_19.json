        "text": "Name\n\nField Name Usage Type Values Description conventional_long_name required free label (free text) Full name in English, displayed as the title at the top of the infobox native_name optional free label (free text) Name in native language(s), displayed underneath the English name. If there are multiple native languages, separate different names with line breaks. If the native language is English, leave this section blank and give only the \"conventional_long_name\" common_name required variable \"country name\" This variable is not actually displayed in the box, but is a supporting variable for a number of technical uses:\n\nThe value here determines how the entry is indexed within the categories that the infobox generates.\n\nExample: The \"Kingdom of England\" should be indexed under E (England) instead of K (Kingdom). Therefore, \"common_name=England\"\n\nVarious links within the infobox are automatically generated if a certain page exists. If the article does not exist, a more generic link is produced. If the entity discussed is normally preceded by \"the\" (e.g. the United Kingdom), do not enter \"the\" in common_name: the template will also search for such links.\n\nExample: The flag and heraldry information for Croatia over its history are in the two articles \"Flag of Croatia\" and \"Coat of arms of Croatia\". By saying \"common_name=Croatia\", the text underneath the flag and coat of arms images automatically links to these entries. For the Axis-controlled Independent State of Croatia, saying \"common_name=Independent State of Croatia\", while historically accurate, does not generate these links because there are no \"Flag/Coat of arms of (the) Independent State of Croatia\" articles.\n\nLocation\n\nThese variables are only used for generating categories for this article Field Name Usage Type Values Description continent required variable Boroso, Miraria, Shekku, etc. If the discussed entity spanned more than one continent, list only one continent here and manually add the second category \"Former countries in xxxx\" as normal. region required where implemented variable Balkans, Italy Give the sub-continental region that the historical entity belongs to. From here, new categories will be created if they are of a reasonable size. country required variable \"country name\" A category-generating field, similar to \"region\", only now give the modern country that the historical entity belongs to. If there is more than one modern country, give the one that covers the majority of the historical territory (or the most relevant)\n\nStatus\n\nThe entries here again determine category placement. For some values, related text will be displayed in a bar underneath the name. Field Name Usage Type Values Description status optional variable\n\nEmpire\n\nFederation\n\nConfederation\n\nState union\n\nClient state\n\nVassal\n\nColony\n\nProtectorate\n\nUnited Nations Trust Territory\n\nLeague of Nations Mandate\n\nSee also the variable government_type and the categorization scheme.\n\nStatus describes the relationship between the political entity and other entities, whether colonies to an empire, the (colonial) empire itself, countries with special status by the League of Nations or the UN, etc. empire optional variable \"country name\" Give the \"common name\" for the imperial country to which the entity was in a state of dependency.\n\nExample: British Empire colony: \"status=Colony\", \"empire=United Kingdom\"\n\nstatus_text optional free label (free text with wikilinks) If values are given for status and empire, it will be displayed by default as \"status (empire)\". The status_text variable allows you to display more specific or accurate text alternatives without compromising category assignment (e.g. \"State of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]\", \"Client state of [[First French Empire|France]]\")\n\nPolitics\n\nField Name Usage Type Values Description government_type required variable\n\nMonarchy\n\nConstitutional monarchy\n\nPrincipality\n\nRepublic\n\nSocialist republic\n\nSee also the variable status and the categorization scheme.\n\nThis entry generates more categories and sets some defaults for other political titles (see below). If the value given here does not match any in the following list, the article will be placed in the maintenance category for further examination.\n\nIf a change in government takes place without the country itself changing, place the earlier government type in this field, and give the change in government as an intermediate event (e.g. event1). Head of state title_leader optional free label (free text with wikilinks) the head of state's title. If \"government_type\" is \"Monarchy\" or \"Constitutional monarchy\" monarchy, the default \"King\" will be displayed, which will link to \"King of {common_name}\" if that article exists. If \"Republic\" of \"Federal republic\" is given, \"President\" will be used instead. If a different title is used, enter it here (but keep the length to a minimum) and wikilink it to the relevant article (if any)\n\nExample: For the Kingdom of Prussia, \"government_type=Monarchy\" but \"title_leader\" has not been given. This is because the article \"King of Prussia\" exists, and is automatically linked to from the default word \"King\" in the infobox.\n\nExample: For the German Empire, the Emperor was also the King of Prussia. But instead of giving a title of \"Emperor of Germany, King of Prussia\", [[List of German monarchs|Emperor]] is used instead, which includes a link to all German monarchs\n\nleader1, leader2, ... optional free label (free text with wikilinks) Leader name. Wikilinks are generated automatically, but you should create wikilinked entries for people whose entry title is long (this applies to almost all royalty).\n\nExample: [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] instead of \"George III\" or \"George III of the United Kingdom\". If it is not obvious that British monarchs are involved in this case, give the full \"George III of the United Kingdom\" (e.g. Congo Free State).\n\nyear_leader1, year_leader2, ... optional free label (free text with wikilinks) Dates spanning rule of leader (e.g. 1801–1843).\n\nNote: If there was only one head of state, just fill in \"leader1\" but not \"year_leader1\". It is also not intended here to list every head of state that ever was: if there were a lot of them, just list the first and the last. To assist this, each name could be followed by (first) and (last)—but then you will need to wikilink the name.\n\nColonial governor, representative of head of state, etc. title_representative optional free label (free text with wikilinks) same as for the head of state. These fields are to be used for colonial governors, representatives of the head of state, etc. For heads of government (e.g. Prime Minister), use the \"deputy\" field below representative1, representative2, ... optional free label (free text with wikilinks) Representative name. Wikilinks are generated automatically, but you should create wikilinked entries for people whose entry title is long year_representative1, year_representative2, ... optional free label (free text with wikilinks) Dates spanning rule of the representative (e.g. 1801–1843). Deputy, head of government, etc. title_deputy optional free label (free text with wikilinks) same as for the head of state. The only difference here is the default labels given: instead of \"King\" the default here is \"Prime Minister\" deputy1, deputy2, ... optional free label (free text with wikilinks) Deputy name. Wikilinks are generated automatically, but you should create wikilinked entries for people whose entry title is long year_deputy1, year_deputy2, ... optional free label (free text with wikilinks) Dates spanning rule of the deputy (e.g. 1801–1843). Legislatures and constitutions legislature optional free label (free text with wikilinks) The name of the legislature (required to display upper and lower hoses) house1, house2 optional free label (free text with wikilinks) The names of upper and lower houses of the legislature type_house1, type_house2 optional free label (free text with wikilinks) Ability to enter different labels than upper and lower houses\n\nGeneral information\n\nField Name Usage Type Values Description capital required free entry (free text with wikilinks) Capital city. No wikilinking necessary. If the name of the city has changed since this period, display the contemporary name, but wikilink to the modern name (e.g. [[Istanbul|Constantinople]]) latd, latm, latNS, longd, longm, longEW optional variable co-ordinates Geographical co-ordinates of capital city national_motto optional free entry (free text with wikilinks) National motto. If not in English, place the English translation last (after a line break). Add wikilinks if articles exist. national_anthem optional free entry (free text with wikilinks) National anthem. If not in English, place the English translation last (after a line break). Add wikilinks if articles exist. common_languages optional free entry (free text with wikilinks) Major language(s). Add wikilinks where possible. If only one language is involved, you may enter simply the name of the language if the corresponding language entry exists.\n\ne.g. If you enter only \"English\" for this field, the template will display [[English language|English]].\n\nIf more than one language is involved, you must enter full wikicoding.\n\ne.g. If the languages are English and Spanish, you must enter [[English language|English]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] religion optional free entry (free text with wikilinks) Major religion(s). Add wikilinks where possible. currency optional free entry (free text with wikilinks) Currency used. If multiple currencies over time, give time periods and separate different currencies with line breaks. Add wikilinks if articles exist.\n\nHistory\n\nField Name Usage Type Values Description Start and end year_start, year_end required variable year Years of establishment and disestablishment. These years will be placed in the date bar at the top. If the values given are the same year, only one year will be displayed, but you must still enter both. Do not wikilink these years. The years given here are automatically used to assign this entity to establishment/disestablishment categories. date_start, date_end optional variable date Give the day and month (if known) to match year_start and year_end. Do not wikilink these dates. The year_start and year_end fields must be filled in.) event_start, event_end optional free label (free text with wikilinks) Entering the information for the above 4 variables (or just the year variables) will create entries in the \"History\" section of the infobox. If nothing is given for event_start or event_end, the events will have the corresponding default text of \"Established\" and \"Disestablished\", respectively. The variables event_start and event_end allow you to give more detail. If the value you enter is the name of an article, the wikilink is automatically generated. You are encouraged to link to the article that describes the actual event which caused the formation/dissolution of the entity, if such articles exist. To keep the infobox tidy, create a wikilink to the event article if the title of the linked article is long (e.g. [[Berlin conference|Established]]). You are discouraged from simply entering something like \"Declaration\" or \"Proclamation\" in these fields, because there are general articles with this title. life_span optional free label (free text with wikilinks) Some entities temporarily ceased to exist before re-establishing. Use this variable only for these entities to replace the displayed dates in the date bar. Give unlinked dates with line breaks. (e.g. 1841–1899<br/>1910–1967). You still need to fill in the year_start and year_end fields (in this example, \"year_start=1841\" and \"year_end=1967\") for the above-described functions to work. |- | colspan=5 style=\"background-color: whitesmoke;\" | '''Events''' |- style=\"vertical-align:top;\" | '''era''' || optional || variable || *Napoleonic Wars *World War I *World War II *Cold War | A category-assigning variable. If the value given here does not match any on the list in [[Template:Infobox former country/Categories|this table]], this article will be automatically assigned to a maintenance-category. Do not panic. If a certain \"era\" value is used often enough, a new category will be created by the infobox developers. |- style=\"vertical-align:top;\" | '''event1/date_event1, event2/date_event2, ...''' || optional || free || label (free text with wikilinks) || Intermediate events. These will be listed in the History section between the start and end events. The event variables here function the same way as the event_start/event_end variables. Enter date as unlinked text (e.g. <nowiki>\"3 August 1789\" or \"3 August 1789\"). event_pre/date_pre, event_post/date_post testing free label (free text with wikilinks) Sometimes, events that take place outside the life-span of the entity are important, these two variables will place an event before event_start (pre) or after event_end (post) in the History box.\n\nImages\n\nAll of these variables are optional (but some are more optional than others). If there is no available image, place the WPFC banner on the article's talk page (if it isn't there already), with the parameters {{WPFC|class=?|flagneeded=yes|coatneeded=yes|mapneeded=yes}} (including only the relevant parameters) Field Name Usage Type Values Description Flag image_flag optional wikilink file name The name of the flag image (no Image: coding needed) flag_alt optional free free text Alt text for the flag image; see Wikipedia:Alternative text for images image_flag2 optional wikilink file name The name of the second flag image flag_alt2 optional free free text Alt text for the second flag image; see Wikipedia:Alternative text for images flag_border optional yes/no yes or no or blank Set to no to turn off border around the flag image, for example for Nepal. flag_type optional free flag name Displayed text under flag image. Useful if more than one flag was used (e.g. \"3rd Flag of the Confederacy\") or if the flag wasn't actually called a flag (e.g. \"Banner\"). Default: \"Flag\" flag2_type optional free flag name Displayed text under flag image. Useful if more than one flag was used (e.g. \"3rd Flag of the Confederacy\") or if the flag wasn't actually called a flag (e.g. \"Banner\"). Default: \"Flag\" flag optional wikilink link target for text under the flag image. By default, it will link to \"Flag of (the) {common_name}\" if such an article exists—if not, it will link to \"Flag\" flag2 optional wikilink link target for text under the flag2 image. By default, it will link to \"Flag of (the) {common_name}\" if such an article exists—if not, it will link to \"Flag\" Heraldry image_coat optional wikilink file name The name of the coat of arms image (no Image: coding needed) coa_size optional free free text The size of the coat of arms coat_alt optional free free text Alt text for the coat of arms symbol_type optional free \"symbol name\" Displayed text under coat of arms image. Useful if more than one coat of arms was used or if it wasn't actually called a coat of arms (e.g. \"Emblem\"). Default: \"Coat of arms\" symbol optional wikilink link target for text under the coat of arms image. By default, it will link to \"Coat of arms of (the) {common_name}\" if such an article exists—if not, it will link to \"Coat of arms\" Map image_map optional wikilink file name The name of the map image (no Image: coding needed) image_map_alt optional free free text Alt text for map image_map_caption optional free sentence (free text with wikilinks) Map caption\n\nPreceding and succeeding entities\n\nThese fields are optional, but very important. Entries here affect the flag-navigation feature of the date bar at the top of the infobox. Field Name Usage Type Values Description p1–p5 optional wikilink \"country name\" Names of preceding entities (up to 5) s1–s5 optional wikilink \"country name\" Names of succeeding entities (up to 5) flag_p1, flag_p2, ... optional wikilink file name Name of image of flag for the state corresponding to p1, p2,... (just the name, no Image: coding). If the preceding state had multiple flags during its existence, use the last flag that it used. The template is instructed to search for possible flag images given the name of the state, so it might not be necessary to fill in this field. If a flag is not found or defined, the default \"flag unknown\" image will be shown. border_p1, border_p2, ... optional yes/no yes or no or blank Set to no to turn off border around the flag, for example for Nepal. flag_s1, flag_s2, ... optional wikilink file name Name of image of flag for the state corresponding to s1, s2,... (just the name, no Image: coding), same as the flags for previous states. If the succeeding state had multiple flags during its existence, use the first flag that it used. border_s1, border_s2, ... optional yes/no yes or no or blank Set to no to turn off border around the flag, for example for Nepal. image_p1,image_s1,... optional wikilink file name Going further back in history, flags were less common and coats of arms were used instead. Coat of arms images are generally narrower than flag images, so if coat of arms images are displayed at the defined image size used here for flags (i.e. width=30px), they appear too big. Therefore, if you have anything other than a flag/banner image to use for a previous/following entity, fill in this field. Here you must enter all wikilinking as normally done when entering an image, but set the image width to 20px (or higher, depending on the individual image).\n\nTo which entries should I link?\n\nIt is not the intention here to list every single previous/following entity—that would make the infobox look very silly in many cases. Here are some guidelines for what to do (and what not to do). There are no strict rules so please exercise caution and common sense when using this feature.\n\nFor most cases, the main and/or official predecessor/successor (under international law) is sufficient, since that is what most readers would expect to see. In the case of any potential confusion, list only this.\n\nExample: not every single state formed after the breakup of the Ottoman Empire should be listed in the infobox for the Ottoman Empire. Such a list is better described in the article text. Instead, only the official successor state would be given (Turkey)\n\nIn some cases, most readers would expect to see every state that was formed, not just the official predecessor/successor. If so, list all states. If only parts of other countries were taken to form the new entity (or if an already existing entity received some of the land from a dissolved entity), list these states only when there are not so many other states to list.\n\nExample: the official successors of Austria-Hungary would be only Austria and Hungary. But from the breakup of Austria-Hungary, two other new states were completely formed (Czechoslovakia and the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs), one state was formed from part of Austria-Hungary (Poland, including territory ceded from Germany and relinquished from Russian rule), and two already-existing states gained territory from Austria-Hungary (Italy and Romania). This gives a total of 7 successor states, which is rather high. In order of priority, the states listed should be: [Austria and Hungary], [Czechoslovakia and the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs], [Poland], and finally [Italy and Romania].\n\nDo not list entities that were formed/dissolved outside the life-span of the discussed state.\n\nExample: the breakup of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia does require the listing of all countries involved, since that is what people would expect. But only the states formed at the time when the SFYR broke up should be given. Therefore, \"Serbia and Montenegro\" is a successor entity, not \"Serbia\" and \"Montenegro\" separately since that breakup occurred later.\n\nIf an entity simply became a subdivision of another country (state, province, etc.), then link to that subdivision. Only do this if it the transition is very clear.\n\nExample: the Republic of Texas was annexed by the USA and reconstituted as the US state of Texas. The successor here is not the USA, but the modern state of Texas.\n\nIf the entity did not exist for a period before reforming (specified when you use the life_span parameter above), do not list the intermediate states.\n\nIf the predecessor and successor are the same, and this predecessor/successor continued to exist during this period, do not list either. Instead, make it clear what this state was somewhere in the events section (if necessary).\n\nExample: the Confederate States of America broke away from the United States of America before becoming again part of the USA after the American Civil War. Detailing predecessor and successor states here as the USA is redundant, since the USA still existed in some form during this period, so say nothing.\n\nArea and population\n\nField Name Usage Type Values Description stat_year1, stat_year2 ... optional (required if area or population is given) variable numerical It is possible to add multiple values for area and population over time.\n\nArea must be given in km² without commas or any other spacing. The area in sq.mi. will be automatically calculated\n\nPopulation must be given without commas or any other spacing. If area is also known for this time, population density will be automatically calculated.\n\nEven if the area does not change over time, it should always be added along with any new population values in order to calculate density.\n\nExample: You have population values for 1800 and 1900. You also have an area value and you know that it is the same for both years. You enter \"stat_year1=1800\" and \"stat_year2=1900\" and the two population values (without commas or spacing) under \"stat_pop1\" and \"stat_pop2\". You then enter your area value (in km², without commas or spacing) in both \"stat_area1\" and \"stat_area2\". The area will not be displayed twice, but the population density will be calculated for both years.\n\nstat_area1, stat_area2 ... optional variable numerical stat_pop1, stat_pop2 ... optional variable numerical Field Name Usage Type Values Description footnotes optional free sentence (free text with wikilinks) A standard field for footnotes. Use footnotes if there is anything in the infobox that requires further explanation. Supports wikilinks. footnotes2 optional free sentence (free text with wikilinks) A second field for footnotes, separated from the first. Supports wikilinks"
