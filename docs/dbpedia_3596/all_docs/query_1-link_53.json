        "text": "Paris Peace Conf. 180.03401/111\n\nIC–175B\n\nNotes of a Meeting Held at President Wilson’s House in the Place des Etats-Unis, Paris, on Tuesday, April 22, 1919, at 11 a.m.\n\nPresent\n\nUnited States of America\n\nPresident Wilson\n\nBritish Empire\n\nMr. Lloyd George\n\nFrance\n\nM. Clemenceau\n\nSecretary—Sir Maurice Hankey, K. C. B.\n\nInterpreter—Prof. P. J. Mantoux.\n\n1. It was agreed that:—\n\nAlsace-Lorraine Draft Articles prepared by the French Government in regard to Alsace-Alsace-Lorraine should be examined in the firs instance by a Committee composed as follows:—\n\nDr. Haskins, for the United States of America.\n\nMr. Headlam-Morley, for the British Empire.\n\nM. Tardieu, for France.\n\n2. Italian Representation President Wilson informed his colleagues that M. Orlando had sent word that he was unable to be present.\n\n3. Commission to Syrica, Palestine, etc. Emir Feisal M. Clemenceau handed Mr. Lloyd George a copy of a letter he had written to the Emir Feisal. (Appendix I.) The Emir Feisal commission had replied that he was satisfied and that he expected soon to be back in paris. M. Clemenceau undertook to give Mr. Lloyd George a copy of the Emir Feisal’s letter. He asked what was to be done about the Commission.\n\nMr. Lloyd George said that he thought the Commission should soon start. It was settled so far as he was concerned.\n\n4. Arrangements for Meeting the Germans M. Clemenceau handed round copies of the German official reply to the last communication in regard to their coming to Versailles. (Appendix II.) He said that he could not the Germans undertake to guarantee to the Germans entire free intercourse.\n\nMr. Lloyd George suggested that they must have communication with their Government at Weimar.\n\n[Page 113]\n\nM. Clemenceau agreed.\n\nPresident Wilson said that was all they asked for.\n\nM. Clemenceau said that he would have to take precautions that they should not have free movement at Versailles as there would be a serious danger of their being mobbed. He was responsible for their safety. At M. Clemenceau’s request President Wilson drafted the following note on which the reply should be based:—\n\n(This was agreed to.)\n\n5. Demilitarization of the west Bank of the Rhine M. Clemenceau handed round the attached draft representing the agreement reached as regards the demilitarization of the west bank of the Rhine. (Appendix III.)\n\nPresident Wilson said he had already communicated it to Sir Maurice Hankey.\n\nMr. Lloyd George agreed that it was comprehensive enough.\n\nAppendix III was approved and Sir Maurice Hankey was instructed to send it to the Secretary-General for the Drafting Committee.\n\n6. Guarantees of Execution of the Treaty M. Clemenceau handed round the attached document headed Guarantees of “Articles concerning Guarantees of Execution of the Treaty of Treaty”, which had already been agreed to by President Wilson on April 20th. (Appendix IV.)\n\nMr. Lloyd George commented on the length of the period contemplated for occupation, namely, 15 years, which seemed considerable. He supposed that the British Government was not asked to keep troops there so long.\n\nM. Clemenceau said all he asked was a battalion with the flag.\n\nMr. Lloyd George said he must insist on the difficulty which the British Government would have in maintaining any larger number of troops. The people of England insisted on the disappearance of compulsory service immediately the war was over. He had had considerable difficulties at home since the election owing to the extension of compulsory service for 12 months.\n\nM. Clemenceau drew attention to the words “by International forces” in Article I, which apparently had not been included in the copy he had left with President Wilson. He said he could not go to his people and say that there were no forces of the Allied and Associated Powers. He only asked for a flag to be shown.\n\nMr. Lloyd George asked if 15 years was the maximum. He hoped it was not conditioned by the extension of the Treaty. Indemnities, [Page 114] for example, could not be paid within 15 years. He hoped he understood correctly that there would not be any question of retaining forces after that,\n\nM. Clemenceau said that was not the intention.\n\nAppendix IV was agreed to and Sir Maurice Hankey was instructed to forward it to the Secretary-General for the Drafting Committee.\n\n7. Treaty Between France and the United States of America M. Clemenceau handed round a document entitled “Treaty between France and the United States”, which had been approved by him and President Wilson on April 20th. (Appendix V.)\n\nPresident Wilson explained to Mr. Lloyd George that he had made a point that it was not wise in this matter to have a tripartite agreement but a Treaty between the United States of America and France and another Treaty between Great Britain and France.\n\nMr. Lloyd George said he thought that would do for Great Britain and instructed Sir Maurice Hankey to show it to Mr. Balfour.\n\nSubject to Mr. Balfour’s agreement, this was accepted.\n\n(Note by the Secretary.)\n\n(Mr. Balfour agreed to it after the Meeting.)\n\n8. German-Austria M. Clemenceau handed round an Article concerning the independence of German-Austria. (Appendix VI.)\n\nThis was accepted and Sir Maurice Hankey was instructed to forward it to the Secretary-General for the Drafting Committee.\n\n9. Dantzing M. Clemenceau reminded President Wilson that he had under-taken to complete the Articles in regard to Dantzig in accordance with certain alterations that had been agreed.\n\nPresident Wilson then produced the document in Appendix VII and proposed that it should be sent direct to the Drafting Committee.\n\nMr. Lloyd George agreed and Sir Maurice Hankey was instructed to forward Appendix VII to the Secretary-General for the Drafting Committee.\n\n10. Archangel President Wilson asked Mr. Lloyd George if the British Government were sending additional troops to Archangel. He had had a communication from General Bliss which seemed to indicate that the local British Command instead of contemplating withdrawal intended to take steps to link up the Russian forces in the north with those in Siberia, which would involve an advance to Kotlas and Viatka. General Bliss’s communication had also suggested that 12,000 British reinforcements were being sent.\n\nMr. Lloyd George said he thought there must be some misunderstanding. Great importance was attached to secrecy in regard to the [Page 115] withdrawal from north Russia and possibly this was some local bluff to convey the impression that no withdrawal was intended. He did not think that the reinforcements contemplated were nearly so large. He undertook to enquire into the matter.\n\nVilla Majestic, Paris, 22 April, 1919.\n\nAppendix I to IC–175B\n\n[Translation]1\n\nCopy of Letter From M. Clemenceau to the Emir Feisal\n\nYour Highness: I am happy, on the occasion of your return to the East, to confirm what I said to you in our conversation of Sunday, April 13.\n\nThe French Government, desirous of assuring to Syria, as well as to Armenia, Mesopotamia and the other countries of the Orient which have been liberated by the victory of the Entente, a regime of liberty and progress in conformity with the principles by which it has always been inspired and which are the basis of the deliberations of the Peace Conference, declares that it recognizes the right of Syria to independence in the form of a federation of autonomous local communities corresponding to the traditions and wishes of their populations.\n\nFrance is prepared to give material and moral assistance to this emancipation of Syria.\n\nIn referring to the needs of the country and the interests of its people as well as to the historic role which France has played Your Highness recognized that France is the Power qualified to give Syria the assistance of the various advisers necessary to establish order and bring about the progress which the peoples of Syria desire.\n\nWhen the time comes to work out more detailed plans to assure the collaboration of France with Syria, they should be in conformity with the spirit of our arrangements.

This personnel is actually at Spa and ready to leave at first notice.\n\nAppendix III\n\nInstructions to Drafting Committee for the [De]militarization of German Territory West of the Rhine\n\nThe maintenance or building of fortifications west of a line drawn fifty kilometers east of the Rhine forbidden to Germany.\n\n[Page 117]\n\nThe maintenance of armed forces, either permanently or temporarily, forbidden within the area defined above, as well as all military manoeuvers of every kind and the maintenance of physical facilities for mobilization.\n\nAny violation of these conditions to be regarded as an hostile act against the signatories to the treaty and as calculated to disturb the peace of the world.\n\nAs long as the present treaty remains in force a pledge by Germany to respond to any enquiry that the Council of the League of Nations may deem necessary.\n\nAppendix IV\n\nArticles Concerning the Guarantees of Execution of the Treaty\n\n(As Approved by President Wilson and M.

Map attached.)3\n\n[Page 119]\n\nN. B. If this draft is approved, the treaty articles submitted by the Committee on Polish Affairs, and concurred in by the Central Committee, will have to be revised accordingly.\n\nArticle 1. The German Government renounces all rights and title over the following territory in favor of the Five Allied and Associated Great Powers:\n\nTake a line from—\n\n(a)\n\nposition latitude 54° 22′ 25″ N; longitude 19° 22′ 05″ E:\n\n(b)\n\nin a direction 159° for a distance of one sea mile;\n\n(c)\n\nthence to the Light Beacon at the bend of the Elbinger Channel approximately in latitude 54° 19½′ N. longitude 19° 26′ E.\n\n(d)\n\nfrom this Light Beacon to the easternmost mouth of the Nogat River bearing approximately 209°.\n\nKeep to the thalweg of this river up to its junction with the main stream of the Vistula north of Pieckel, and thence follow the thalweg of the main stream northward to a point 5 miles below the railway bridge at Dirschau. Thence continue in a general westerly direction leaving the village of Mühlbanz on the south, and Rambeltsch on the north, and touching at Klein Golmkau the tip of the salient formed by the boundary of Kreis Dirschau. Thence westwards along that boundary to the salient formed west of Boschpohl.\n\nFrom the tip of the salient west of Boschpohl continue westward, leaving the villages of Neu Fietz and Schatarpi on the south. At a point north of Schatarpi turn north-west to the mid-point of the lake west of Lonken leaving the village of Lonken to the north. Thence continue north and northwest to the northern end of the lake. From there continue almost due north to the southern end of the lake. From there continue almost due north to the southern end of the lake immediately north-east of Pollenschin. Thence pass northeast along the median line of the lake to the northern end of it. From this point continue north to the Stangenwalder forest leaving the village of Kamehlen on the west and Neuendorf on the east. Where the line reaches a point due north-west of the village of Neuendorf turn north-eastward to the Lappinet lake north of Gross Cza-pielken leaving Krissau on the northwest and Marschau on the southeast.

The Five Allied and Associated Great Powers undertake to establish the town of Danzig, together with the rest of the territory described in Article 1 as an (independent) Free City (under the title of Freihansestadt Dansig).\n\nArticle 3. A Constitution for the Free City of Dansig shall be drawn up by the duly appointed representatives of the Free City in agreement with a High Commissioner to be appointed by the League of Nations, and shall be placed under the guarantee of the said League. The High Commissioner will also be charged with the duty of dealing, in the first instance, with all differences arising between Poland and the Free City of Danzig of this Treaty, or any arrangements or agreements made thereunder. The High Commissioner shall reside at Danzig.\n\nArticle 4: The Five Allied and Associated Great Powers undertake to negotiate (a treaty)* between the Polish Government and the Free City of Danzig which shall come into force at the same time as the establishment of said Free City.\n\nThis agreement will include provisions with the following objects:\n\n(a)\n\nTo effect the inclusion of the Free City of Danzig within the Polish customs frontiers† always provided that there may be clauses in the agreement establishing a free port area therein.\n\n(b)\n\nTo ensure to Poland the full and unhampered use and service of all waterways, docks, basins, wharves, and other instrumentalities within the territory of the Free City necessary for Polish import and export.\n\n(c)\n\nTo ensure to Poland the control and administration of the Vistula and of the whole railway system within said Free City except such street and other railways as serve primarily the needs of the Free City; and of postal, telegraphic and telephonic communication between the port of Danzig and Poland.\n\nThe rights conferred in Article 4 (c) shall extend also to the development and improvement of the existing railways and other means of communication therein mentioned, and to the lease or purchase through appropriate processes of such land and other property as may be necessary for these purposes.\n\n(d)\n\nTo provide against any discrimination within the Free City of Danzig to the detriment of citizens of Poland and other persons of Polish origin or speech.\n\n(e)\n\nSuch foreign relations as may be necessary for the Free City of Danzig will be conducted by the Polish Government; and citizens [Page 121] of the Free City of Danzig when abroad will be entitled to the diplomatic protection of Poland.\n\nArticle 5: On the coming into force of the present Treaty German nationals ordinarily resident in the territory described in Article 1 will ipso facto lose their German nationality and become citizens of the Free City of Danzig.\n\nArticle 6: Within a period of two years from the coming into force of the present Treaty German nationals, more than eighteen years old, ordinarily resident in the territory described in Article 1, will have the right to opt for German nationality. They must during the ensuing two years transfer their place of residence into Germany.\n\nOption by a husband will cover his wife and option by parents will cover their children less than eighteen years old.\n\nAll persons who exercise the right of option referred to above will be entitled to preserve the immovable property which they possess in the territory described in Article 1.\n\nThey may carry with them their movable property of every description.\n\nNo export or import duties may be imposed upon them in connection with the removal of such property.\n\nArticle 7: All property situated within the territory described in Article 1 belonging to the German Government or to the Government of any German State will pass to the Five Allied and Associated Great Powers for transfer to the Free City of Danzig or to the Polish State, as may be equitably determined by the said Five Allied and Associated Great Powers.\n\nArticle 8: In a zone including Kreise Stuhm and Rosenberg, and those parts of Kreise Marienburg and Marienwerder which lie to the East of the Vistula, the inhabitants will be called upon to indicate by a vote by commune (Gemeinde) whether they wish the several communes (Gemeinden) within the territory to belong to Poland or East Prussia.\n\nFrom the time when the present Treaty takes effect, and within a period which shall not exceed a fortnight, the zone delimited above shall be placed under the authority of an International Commission composed of five members, appointed by the Five Allied and Associated Great Powers, and shall be evacuated by German troops.\n\nThis Commission, accompanied by the necessary forces should occasion arise, shall have general powers of administration and shall take whatever measures it may deem proper for holding the plebiscite and assuring the liberty, fairness and secrecy of the vote, following the provisions of this treaty regulating the plebiscite to be held in Allenstein as nearly as may be. All decision[s] of the Commission shall be taken by a majority vote.\n\n[Page 122]\n\nAll of the expense incurred by the Commission, whether in the exercise of its own functions or in the administration of the zone subjected to the plebiscite, shall be levied upon the local revenues.\n\nAt the conclusion of the vote, the Commission shall communicate to the Five Allied and Associated Great Powers a detailed report of the manner in which the vote was conducted, and a proposal for the line which should be adopted as the frontier of East Prussia in this region, taking account of the desires of the inhabitants as expressed by the vote as well as of the geographic and economic situation of the locality. The Five Allied and Associated Great Powers shall then determine the frontier between East Prussia and Poland in this region, leaving to Poland as a minimum for any section of this river the full and complete control of the Vistula, its east bank included, as far east of the river as may be necessary for its regulation and improvement. The said Great Powers shall at the same time formulate regulations securing to the population of East Prussia equitable access to and use of the Vistula for themselves and their goods and for craft controlled by them or owned by them as may best serve their interests. These determinations of frontier, as well as the regulations just mentioned, are accepted in advance as binding by all parties hereto.\n\nAs soon as the administration of the portion of the zone assigned to it shall have been assumed by the authorities of East Prussia and of Poland respectively, the powers of the International Commission shall be terminated.\n\nArticle 9. A Commission composed of three members, including the High Commissioner, who shall be Chairman, one member named by Germany, and one member named by Poland, shall be constituted with[in] six months after the time when the present Treaty takes effect, to delimit in the field the lines provided for in the foregoing articles.\n\nThe decisions taken by a majority vote of the said commission shall be binding on both parties concerned.\n\nArticle 10. The Five Allied and Associated Great Powers agree to negotiate agreements between Poland and Germany by which, whether under the form of a general railroad convention to which both States are partners, or in the form of a special agreement between the two States, there shall be secured, on the one hand to Germany, full and adequate railroad facilities for communication between the rest of Germany and East Prussia over the intervening Polish territory, on the other hand there shall be secured to Poland, in the same way, full and adequate railroad facilities for communication between Poland and the City of Danzig over any German territory that may, on the right bank of the Vistula, intervene between Poland and the City of Danzig."
