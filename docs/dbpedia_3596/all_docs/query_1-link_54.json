The Ambiguous End of the Great War in Alsace-Lorraine, 1918–1919 sebastian döderlein When in November and December 1918, victorious French troops entered Alsace-Lorraine, the “lost provinces” were restored to France. Official French propaganda immediately pointed to the joy among the population that had remained faithful to the motherland during forty-seven years of German occupation. The reason for this was obvious : any possible French scepticism about the Alsatian-Lorrainers and the “bochisme” (a derogatory term for German culture) that had supposedly been injected into them had to be eliminated. Propaganda showed French troops being greeted enthusiastically by the local population and peddled the slogan “unforgettable moments for Alsace-Lorraine,” focusing on the terms “return,” “deliverance,” and “liberation.”1 Seven months later, at the signing of the Treaty of Versailles, the Allies confirmed the return of the lost provinces to the motherland and therefore the definitive end to the war in Alsace-Lorraine. Since then, this image has remained both in historiography and in collective French memory and has virtually never been challenged. The end of the war in Alsace-Lorraine is, in this sense, clearly the story of a liberation and therefore purely and uniquely a French story. At first glance, this idea seems problematic. The differing interests, the differing approaches, and the lack of communication between schools of historiography – particularly German and French – are what has led to this distorted perspective. In studying public opinion in Alsace-Lorraine both before and after the armistice, I will argue that we need to rethink the end-of-war experience, lending nuance to its unanimous, unequivocal character. Contrary to the enduring view, in terms of the local population, widespread hatred of German immigrants and general euphoria about the liberation hardly existed. The Ambiguous End of the Great War in Alsace-Lorraine 109 Separate Histories of Alsace-Lorraine Although libraries are filled with literature about the history of AlsaceLorraine since 1870/1871, in France, in Germany, and elsewhere, approaches and interests fundamentally differ. In German historiography, Alsace-Lorraine disappeared completely from the scientific lens after 1945. With a few exceptions, such as a 1961 article by Hans-Ulrich Wehler,2 research on the history of the Reichsland (1871–1918) developed essentially beginning in the 1980s, in particular with the work of Hermann Hiery and Michael Essig. Against the backdrop of German reunification in 1990 and until the present day, German scholars have mainly been concerned with the constitutional status of Alsace-Lorraine and the debate around its incorporation in the Reich.3 And only recently did cultural history discover Alsace-Lorraine and its traditions as a field of study, emphasizing the regional identity of the Reichsland – both unique and torn between France and Germany.4 In almost all of this work, 11 November 1918 represents a veritable break. German historiography of Alsace-Lorraine does not consider the interwar period, nor the civilian experience of the end of the war.5 It is different in France because French historiography looks only at the post-war period. Particularly since the fiftieth anniversary of the armistice, new studies, such as by Robert Heitz, Job de Roince, and Jacques Granier, reinforce the image of the jubilant welcome reserved for French troops by the population of Alsace-Lorraine in November and December 1918.6 In 1969, Christian Baechler was the first to argue that, while the joy of liberation was real and universal, that changed quickly when Paris imposed a centralized French administration on the former Reichsland, increasing the impetus for an Alsatian independence movement.7 Since then, Alsace-Lorraine’s difficult transition to France in the 1920s has been at the centre of French historiography,8 with many local and hyperlocal studies conducted to date. With the 100th anniversary of the armistice, it has been almost exclusively Alsatian and Lorrainer historians who have shown an interest in the provinces, resulting in broader and multidisciplinary approaches, such as Les Alsaciens-Lorrains dans la Grande Guerre by JeanNo ël and Francis Grandhomme.9 But despite certain multidisciplinary approaches and recent cross-border projects, both sides of the Rhine continue to work pretty much in a vacuum. The new Historial at Hartmannswillerkopf , which opened in 2017, appears to be more of a Franco-Alsatian institution than a Franco-German one.10 And in 2018, a conference in Strasbourg entitled “From awe for the French flag to Alsatian discomfort – the reversion of Alsace to France (1918–24)” (“De l’éblouissement tricolore..."
