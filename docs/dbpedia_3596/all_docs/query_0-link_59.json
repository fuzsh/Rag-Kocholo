The Kingdom was formed as a rump of the Kingdom of Prussia, who acquired a considerable amount of land in west Germany following the Napoleonic War (as OTL). However, in this ATL, liberal revolutionaries succeeded in overthrowing the King of Prussia in his own lands, forcing the Kingdom to move.\n\n1875 Map\n\nThis map shows the Kingdom of the Rhineland in 1875, alongside the Austrian Empire (which absorbed Bavaria as a title in the 1840s), the Republic of Germany, the Second French Empire, and the Kingdom of the Netherlands. In this ATL, the Second French Empire was established directly via revolution and Napoleonic sentiment rather than conversion of the Republic. Pro-German revolutionaries in France's easternmost lands, particularly Alsace-Lorraine, joined the Kingdom of the Rhineland. By the time the government of the Second French Empire under Napoleon III had recovered and restored order, it was too late - the territories had been occupied and militarized by the Rhineland.\n\nThat Seal looks rather like a moon. I think I now see where that moonworshipper propaganda came from with the predominance of the seal and crescents.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, my first flag on this site... a Romanov-Ruled New Kingdom of Granada (or as we know it OTL since 1863, Colombia) made crudely on MS Paint\n\nAlso fits a Romanov Romania. Romanovia?\n\nHere's a quickly and roughly put together flag I did out of boredom for the werewolf 'Lupan Empire of Rome' from my Halloween inspired map I'm still working on, as seen on the Map Thread. And yes, that is the witcher medallion. Honestly it was the most badass wolf head logo I could think of.\n\nCool\n\nFlag for the Kingdom of the Rhineland.
