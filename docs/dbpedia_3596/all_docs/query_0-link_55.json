They were these French fascists who supported the restoration of a (constitutional) monarchy under the House of Orléans. Let's say that in a span between 1931 and 1935 they take power in France and achieve their goal.\n\nSo you know Action Française?

I see it.\n\nHey guys, need a flag for a monarchic Orleanist restoration flag dated to the mid-30's. Any help?\n\nI tried two similar approaches. Not entirely sure of either. I wanted to maintain the 3 colors, yet show the return to House Orleans. I know that some of the older French flags are crazy-go-nuts with intricate detail, but I personally don't like that aesthetic in a flag. I think that defeats the purpose of a flag. Save all the crazy-go-nuts for special coats of arms or what-not. Anyway, as they say, voila!\n\nHey guys, need a flag for a monarchic Orleanist restoration flag dated to the mid-30's.
