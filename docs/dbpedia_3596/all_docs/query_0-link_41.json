        "text": "Whether you’re living in France or just visiting, it’s a good idea to check when the local holidays fall. This is because many businesses in the country close for national days off. However, some shopping centers and shops may stay open on these days, sometimes for a half-day.\n\nTo ensure you don’t miss out on anything important, find out when the next public holiday is below:\n\nAllyz\n\nPlan and protect your next trip with Allyz.

The right to additional paid holidays and the conditions for working on French national holidays (such as higher pay) are left to the discretion of the employer-employee contract or union.\n\nMost national days off apply across the country, although two regions (Alsace and Lorraine) have two extra public holidays: Good Friday and Saint Stephen’s Day. The former German territory retained these two extra public holidays when it rejoined France after World War I.\n\nIf a national holiday in France falls on a Sunday, the following Monday is usually given as a day off. On the other hand, if it falls on a Saturday, however, no extra day is given during the week. Employees typically take a bridge holiday (faire le pont) if the day off lands on a Tuesday or Thursday, thus creating a long weekend. What’s more, some businesses may opt to close completely during a bridge holiday.\n\nYou can also see which vacation days coincide with the best French festivals; it’s also a great reason to travel the country and experience local food and culture.\n\nThe biggest holidays in France\n\nThe two most widely celebrated holidays in France are Bastille Day (14 July) and All Saints Day (1 November). The former commemorates the storming of the Bastille in 1789 and is a celebration of nationhood with communal fireworks, tricolor flags flying, and moules frites at the mairie.\n\nThe latter, which is the Catholic holy day of La Toussaint or All Saints, is a more private affair. Families place flowers – most commonly chrysanthemums – on graves in honor of their dead relatives, and then go home for a huge lunch. All Saints Day falls on the day after Halloween, which is somewhat of a controversial celebration in the country. However, it is growing in popularity, especially in the larger cities.\n\nAdditionally, Christmas Eve and Christmas Day are widely celebrated French holidays. However, in parts of northern and eastern France, some children also receive presents on the morning of St Nicholas’ Day on 6 December."
