        "text": "Alsace–Lorraine (German: Elsaß–Lothringen), officially the Imperial Territory of Alsace–Lorraine (German: Reichsland Elsaß–Lothringen), is an imperial territory of Germany. It was created in 1871 after seizing the region from the Second French Empire in the First Franco-Prussian War and Treaty of Frankfurt.\n\nAlsatian, a recognised regional language, is an Alemannic dialect closely related to Swabian, although since the 1870s most Alsatians primarily speak German. Internal and international migration since 1945 has also changed the ethnolinguistic composition of Alsace. For more than 300 years, from the Thirty Years' War to the Second Franco-Prussian War, the political status of Alsace was heavily contested between France and various German states in wars and diplomatic conferences. The economic and cultural capital of Alsace, as well as its largest city, is Straßburg, and is the seat of several international organisations and bodies.\n\nGeography[]\n\nAlsace–Lorraine's capital is Straßburg. It is divided in three districts (Bezirke in German):\n\nOberelsaß (Upper Alsace), whose capital is Kolmar.\n\nUnterelsaß, (Lower Alsace), whose capital is Straßburg.\n\nBezirk Lothringen, (Lorraine), whose capital is Metz.\n\nTowns and cities[]\n\nThe largest urban areas in Alsace–Lorraine at the 2022 census are:\n\nStraßburg: 284,677 inhabitants\n\nMülhausen: 141,209 inhabitants\n\nMetz: 116,581 inhabitants\n\nDiedenhofen: 71,662 inhabitants\n\nKolmar: 68,703 inhabitants\n\nHistory[]\n\nBackground[]\n\nThe modern history of Alsace–Lorraine was largely influenced by the rivalry between French and German nationalism.\n\nFrance long sought to attain and then preserve what it considered to be its \"natural boundaries\", which it considered the Pyrenees to the southwest, the Alps to the southeast, and the Rhine River to the northeast. These strategic claims led to the annexation of territories located west of the Rhine river in the Holy Roman Empire. What is now known as Alsace was progressively conquered by France under Louis XIII and Louis XIV in the 17th century, while Lorraine was incorporated from the 16th century under Henry II to the 18th century under Louis XV (in the case of the Three Bishoprics, as early as 1552). These border-changes, at the time, meant more or less that one ruler (the local princes and city-governments, with some remaining power of the Holy Roman Emperor) was exchanged for another (the King of France); it was the French revolution that turned what might have been called \"the King of France's German territories\" into parts of France proper.\n\nGerman nationalism on the other hand, which in its 19th century form originated as a reaction against the French occupation of large areas of Germany under Napoleon, sought to unify all the German-speaking populations of the former Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation into a single nation-state. As various German dialects were spoken by most of the population of Alsace and Moselle (northern Lorraine), these regions were viewed by German nationalists to be rightfully part of hoped-for united Germany in the future.
