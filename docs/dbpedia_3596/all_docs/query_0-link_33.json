Around 1m people near the Italian border, roughly 1.7% of the population, speaks Italian. Basque is spoken by 0.1% and mainly along the French-Spanish border.\n\nCatalan dialects are spoken in the French Pyrenees by around 260,000 people or 0.4% of the French population.\n\nThe Celtic language, Breton, is spoken by 1.2% and mainly in the north west of France. These three languages have no official status within France.\n\nIn the South of France, over 7m speak Occitan dialects, representing 12% of the population of France, but these dialects have no official status. Nor too does Corsu, the dialect of the island of Corsica that is closely related to Tuscan and is spoken by 0.3%.\n\nArabic, the third largest minority language, is spoken by around 1.7% of the population throughout the country. Other immigrant languages from the former French colonies include Kabyle and Antillean Creole.\n\nFrench Society & Culture\n\nCuisine\n\nFood is one of the great passions of the French people.\n\nFrench cooking is highly refined and involves careful preparation, attention to detail, and the use of fresh ingredients.\n\nIt varies by region and is heavily influenced by what is grown locally.\n\nFrench Family Values\n\nThe family is the social adhesive of the country and each member has certain duties and responsibilities.\n\nThe extended family provides both emotional and financial support.\n\nDespite their reputation as romantics, the French have a practical approach towards marriage.\n\nFamilies have few children, but parents take their role as guardians and providers very seriously.\n\nRelationships - Public vs. Private\n\nThe French are private people and have different rules of behaviour for people within their social circle and those who are not.\n\nAlthough the French are generally polite in all dealings, it is only with their close friends and family that they are free to be themselves.\n\nFriendship brings with it a set of roles and responsibilities, including being available should you be needed. Friendship involves frequent, if not daily, contact.\n\nCafes are a central part of daily life for many French people.

Wait until invited before using someone's first name.\n\nYou are expected to say 'bonjour' or 'bonsoir' (good morning and good evening) with the honorific title Monsieur or Madame when entering a shop and 'au revoir' (good-bye) when leaving.\n\nIf you live in an apartment building, it is polite to greet your neighbours with the same appellation.\n\nGift Giving Etiquette\n\nFlowers should be given in odd numbers but not 13, which is considered unlucky.\n\nSome older French retain old-style prohibitions against receiving certain flowers: White lilies or chrysanthemums as they are used at funerals; red carnations as they symbolize bad will; any white flowers as they are used at weddings.\n\nProhibitions about flowers are not generally followed by the young. When in doubt, it is always best to err on the side of conservatism.\n\nIf you give wine, make sure it is of the highest quality you can afford. The French appreciate their wines.\n\nGifts are usually opened when received.\n\nDining Etiquette\n\nIf you are invited to a French house for dinner:\n\nArrive on time. Under no circumstances should you arrive more than 10 minutes later than invited without telephoning to explain you have been detained.\n\nThe further south you go in the country, the more flexible time is.\n\nIf invited to a large dinner party, especially in Paris, send flowers the morning of the occasion so that they may be displayed that evening.\n\nDress well. The French are fashion conscious and their version of casual is not as relaxed as in many western countries.\n\nTable manners\n\nTable manners are Continental -- the fork is held in the left hand and the knife in the right while eating.\n\nIf there is a seating plan, you may be directed to a particular seat.\n\nDo not begin eating until the hostess says 'bon appetit'.\n\nIf you have not finished eating, cross your knife and fork on your plate with the fork over the knife.\n\nDo not rest your elbows on the table, although your hands should be visible and not in your lap.\n\nFinish everything on your plate.\n\nDo not cut salad with a knife and fork. Fold the lettuce on to your fork.\n\nPeel and slice fruit before eating it.\n\nLeave your wine glass nearly full if you do not want more.\n\nAvoid doing business with or in France during August. The whole country pretty much shuts down to focus on fun and family.\n\nPhoto taken in Quend by Kevin Delvecchio on Unsplash\n\nBusiness Culture and Etiquette in France\n\nRelationships & Communication\n\nFrench business behaviour emphasizes courtesy and a degree of formality.\n\nMutual trust and respect is required to get things done.\n\nTrust is earned through proper behaviour.\n\nCreating a wide network of close personal business alliances is very important.\n\nIf you do not speak French, an apology for not knowing their language may aid in developing a relationship.\n\nIt is always a good idea to learn a few key phrases, since it demonstrates an interest in a long-term relationship.\n\nThe way a French person communicates is often predicated by their social status, education level, and which part of the country they were raised.\n\nIn business, the French often appear extremely direct because they are not afraid of asking probing questions.\n\nWritten communication is formal. Secretaries often schedule meetings and may be used to relay information from your French business colleagues.\n\nBusiness Meeting Etiquette\n\nAppointments are necessary and should be made at least 2 weeks in advance.\n\nAppointments may be made in writing or by telephone and, depending upon the level of the person you are meeting, are often handled by the secretary.\n\nDo not try to schedule meetings during July or August, as this is a common vacation period.\n\nIf you expect to be delayed, telephone immediately and offer an explanation.\n\nMeetings are to discuss issues, not to make decisions.\n\nAvoid exaggerated claims, as the French do not appreciate hyperbole.\n\nRead more about business meetings in France here.\n\nBusiness Negotiation\n\nFrench business emphasizes courtesy and a fair degree of formality.\n\nWait to be told where to sit.\n\nMaintain direct eye contact while speaking.\n\nBusiness is conducted slowly. You will have to be patient and not appear ruffled by the strict adherence to protocol.\n\nAvoid confrontational behaviour or high-pressure tactics. It can be counterproductive.\n\nThe French will carefully analyze every detail of a proposal, regardless of how minute.\n\nBusiness is hierarchical. Decisions are generally made at the top of the company.\n\nThe French are often impressed with good debating skills that demonstrate an intellectual grasp of the situation and all the ramifications.\n\nNever attempt to be overly friendly. The French generally compartmentalize their business and personal lives.\n\nDiscussions may be heated and intense.\n\nHigh-pressure sales tactics should be avoided. The French are more receptive to a low-key, logical presentation that explains the advantages of a proposal in full.\n\nWhen an agreement is reached, the French may insist it be formalized in an extremely comprehensive, precisely worded contract.\n\nDress Etiquette\n\nBusiness dress is understated and stylish.\n\nMen should wear dark-coloured, conservative business suits for the initial meeting. How you dress later is largely dependent upon the personality of the company with which you are conducting business.\n\nWomen should wear either business suits or elegant dresses in soft colours.\n\nThe French like the finer things in life, so wear good quality accessories.\n\nBusiness Cards\n\nBusiness cards are exchanged after the initial introductions without formal ritual.\n\nHave the other side of your business card translated into French. Although not a business necessity, it demonstrates an attention to detail that will be appreciated.\n\nInclude any advanced academic degrees on your business card.\n\nFrench business cards are often a bit larger than in many other countries.\n\nManagement"
