Set an example for the environment and social standards! The 3D label shows: Our flags are produced in Germany under optimal working and environmental conditions. These are products of very high quality in terms of workmanship and colour, which have - due to the printing procedure and the chosen materials - an above-average lifespan and, initially, also their price. Under normal application in outdoor use, however, you will enjoy it for approx. 5 years, and you will not need to buy another one so quickly! Save money and resources!
