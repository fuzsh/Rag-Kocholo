Held at the Church campus grounds since its start as an Easter picnic – this event has been a staple of Mediterranean culture in the County. We welcome all to attend and learn about our folk culture, the thousands of years of Orthodox history, our idyllic homeland and of course enjoy our freshly prepared food!"
