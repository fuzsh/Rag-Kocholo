        "text": "The Hellenic culture is exceptional in that Greece is one of the only countries where folk dance remains an active part of social life. Folk dances are passed down from generation to generation, and serve as a form of living history for the country's national identity. The Hellenic culture is also unique in its regionality, as each region of Greece has a distinct and rich identity. All regions differ in costume, dance, and instrumentation, largely due to their morphology and climate. There are still other regions, no longer a part of Greece, that have developed their own unique cultural identity and dances. Despite this, their origins are undoubtedly Hellenic (e.g. Pontos, Cappadocia, Asia Minor, Cyprus.)\n\nSee below for a sample of costumes from different regions including a list of typical dances and a brief explanation of the region."
