        "text": "Last week we covered the Hasapiko and Hassaposervico or Fast Hasapiko as it is commonly referred to in non Greek venues. Let's take a quick review of the Hasapiko dance its origin and steps. The information comes to us from Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasapiko and\n\nDick Oakes: http://www.phantomranch.net/folkdanc/dances/hasapiko.htm\n\n\"The hasapiko (Greek: χασάπικο, pronounced [xaˈsapiko], meaning “the butcher's [dance]” from Turkmen: kasap “butcher”) is a Greek folk dance from Constantinople. The dance originated in the Middle Ages as a battle mime with swords performed by the Greek butchers guild, which adopted it from the military of Byzantine era.[1] In Constantinople during the Byzantine times, it was called in Greek μακελλάρικος χορός (makellárikos horós from μακελλάρioς “butcher”). Some Greeks, however, reserve the latter term only for the fast version of the dance.\n\nThe slow version of the dance is called χασάπικο βαρύ (hasapiko vary) or χασάπικος βαρύς (hasapikos varys — βαρύς meaning “heavy”) and generally employs a 4/4 meter. The fast version of the dance uses a 2/4 meter. It is variously called γρήγορο χασάπικο, μακελλάριος χορός, χασαποσέρβικο (grigoro hasapiko, makellarios horos, hasaposerviko — the latter a reference to Serbian and other Balkan influences on this version of the dance).\n\nHasapiko served as one of the bases for the Sirtaki.\"\n\nHASAPIKOSGreek\n\nPRONUNCIATION:hah-SAH-pee-kohs TRANSLATION:Butchers' dance SOURCE:Dick Oakes learned this dance in the Greek community of Los Angeles. Athan Karras, a prominent Greek dance researcher, also has taught Hasapikos to folk dancers in the United States, as have many other teachers of Greek dance, including Dave Rosenberg at the 1960 Santa Barbara Folk Dance Conference, Oliver \"Sonny\" Newman at the 1963 Stockton Folk Dance Camp, Vilma Matchette at the 1967 Santa Barbara Folk Dance Conference, and John Filcich at the 1970 Stockton Folk Dance Camp. BACKGROUND:The Hasapikos was called Makellarion Horon (makellarios is the Greek word for \"butcher\") during Byzantine days because it was adopted by the butchers' guild in Constantinople (now İstanbul, Turkey). The dance is also spelled Hassapikos (Hassip is Turkish for \"butcher\"). It is also known as Grigoro (fast) Hasapikos, or simply Zoero (lively). The dance is mostly known outside of Greece because of its being danced during the Syrtaki in the film Alexis Zorbas (titled Zorba the Greek in America). The Hasapikos is sometimes referred to as Hasaposervikos, whose basic step is based on that of the fast Hasapikos. Other dances that have a similar dance motif are the Arkan of the Ukraine, Hora of Israel, the Debki of the Arab countries, the Kasapsko Horo of Bulgaria, the Kasapsko Kolo of Serbia, the Lesnoto of Macedonia, and the Soorch Bar of Armenia. MUSIC:Festival (45rpm) 3513-B Folkraft (LP) 8 or any fast hasapikos music. FORMATION:Lines of mixed M and W with hands holding neighbors' shldrs in \"T\" pos. The dance also may be seen being danced with hands joined with elbows bent and held at shldr height in \"W\" pos (although this is not as stable).\n\nMETER/RHYTHM:2/4 STEPS/STYLE:\n\nThe dance has a happy, joyful, high-spirited, and carefree nature.\n\nMEASURE MOVEMENT DESCRIPTION INTRODUCTION\n\nNone or at the discretion of the leader.

Here is the Ballos steps and Tsamiko steps. Please bear in mind that the steps here are the generally accepted steps but may vary in style and sequence depending on the region. What we hope to accomplish is the ability to do the dances in step and in time with the music so that the natural feel and character of the dance becomes one with you and you with it.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballos\n\n\"The Ballos Sirtos (Greek: Μπάλος) (from the Italian ballo[1] via Latin \"ballo\"[2][3] which derives from the Greek verb \"βαλλίζω\" ballizo, \"to dance, to jump\"),[4][5][6] is one of the best known Greek folk island dances in Greece. There are also different versions in other Balkan countries. The Ballos is of Greek origin, with ancient Greek elements.[7]\n\nThe melody of a ballos is generally joyous and lyrical which is typical of the music of the Aegean Islands. This couples' dance incorporates all the elements of courtship: attraction, flirtation, display of masculine prowess and feminine virtue, pursuit,and rejection followed by eventual capture and surrender.\n\nIts origin is in the island culture of Greece. Men could not approach women easily, so they created this dance in order to \"flirt\" with them. There are various forms of the ballos around the islands. The simplest is one in which a single couple goes through a series of spontaneous figures. In another version many couples dance simultaneously as if alone on the dance floor. Yet another version is introduced by a Sirtos. In its most complicated form, a number of couples go through various figures, somewhat reminiscent of the European minuet. Ballos songs are popular and there are many of them. One of the most popular Ballos Asia minor song is: Τι σε μέλλει εσένανε; Ti se mellei esenane (\"What do you mind?\") etc.\"\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsamiko\n\n\"The Tsamiko (Greek: Τσάμικος, Tsamikos) is a popular traditional folk dance of Greece, done to music of 3/4 meter. The name literally means dance of the Chams. It is also known asKleftikos (Greek: Κλέφτικος), literally meaning dance of the Klephts. Danced almost exclusively by men, this dance is strongly reminiscent of the 1821 era in Greek history. Today Tsamiko is a popular dance in festivals and weddings, especially in the rural areas of Central Greece and Peloponnese, as well as Epirus periphery where a slower version is performed.[1] Sometimes the dancers dress in the traditional Greek fustanella. This dance is usually performed to celebrate national events (i.e. anniversary of the declaration of the start of Greek War of Independence in 1821). The dance follows a strict and slow tempo not emphasising on the steps, but more on the \"attitude, style and grace\" of the dancer. The dancers hold each other from each other's hands, bent 90 degrees upwards at the elbows. It takes a sturdy hand, especially if you are supporting the first or last person of the line (or circle) who will lean on you to perform high acrobatic leaps (usually kicking his right leg up as he takes off followed by the left (in a scissor-like motion), hitting the latter with the back of his hand before landing). The steps are relatively easy but have to be precise and strictly onbeat. The dancer might even stomp his foot in response to a strong beat. There is some improvisation involved and many variations of the steps, depending on which area the dancers come from. Over time the dance has taken on many variations. In the past, it was danced exclusively by men, but in modern times both men and women take part.\"\n\nBallos\n\nStepTempo\n\n2/4 or 8/8Traveling Step, used to to move about in all directions including around partner.

Whether in Greece or he Diaspora these dances are the bedrock on which the fundamentals of the Greek dance were built. The S yrto σύρω, syro, \"drag [the dance]\"), along with its cousin the Kalamatianos, are the most popular dances throughout Greece and the Greek diaspora. They are frequently danced at popular social gatherings, weddings and religious festivals. The Syrtos and Kalamatianos use identical dance steps, but syrtos is in 4/4 time, quick quick slow and the kalamatianos is in 7/8 time, slow quick quick rhythmic dance beat and a pas deux pas cross step rather than the three step reverse commonly performed in the Syrto dance.\n\nThe Syrtos and Kalamatianos are circle dances. The dancers move in the right line of direction as is the case with most Greek dances. The dancer at the right end of the line is the leader who commonly will improvise, demonstrating the mastery of the dance and his ability to manipulate steps in impromptu moves while the rest of the line does the basic step. A handkerchief is the prevalence of choice especially when dancing the Kalamatiano.\n\nThe Syrtos dance is theorized to have originated all the way back to antiquity, to a relevant ancient Greek dance known as the \"Ormos\", literally \"a string\". Rennell Rodd (1892) suggests that the dance is an imitation of the action of drawing in the seine net. C. T. Dimaras describes an inscription from the times of Caligula, which implied that the Syrtos was considered an ancient Greek dance of local tradition.\n\nEach region, particularly the islands, have their own version of the dance. But the common character of the dance remains the same. It is a line dance with the dancers facing the right line of direction and holding hands, moving to the right.\n\nSyrto-kalamatianos\n\nKalamatianos syrtos and syrto-kalamatianos are the most popular Greek folkdance syrtoi in Greece, Cyprus and internationally. The steps of the Kalamatianos are the same as those of the Syrtos, but the latter is slower and more stately, its beat being an even 4/4. Traditionally, it was danced by segregated lines of men and women. The lead dancer usually holds the second dancer by a handkerchief.\n\nNisiotikoi syrtoi\n\nSyrtoi from the Greek islands Syrtoi from the islands orelse nisiotikoi, with the relative local Greek culture of the islands.\n\nKalamatianos, Sousta, Syrtos from Ikaria, Pentozali, Pidikhtos, Rhoditikos, Syrtos from Symi, Skyrianos syrtos, Maleviziotikos, Samiotikos syrtos, Syrtos from Andros, Syrtos Chiotikos, Skopelitikos syrtos, Syrtos from Paros, Syrtos Kithnou, Syrtos Naxou, Zakynthinos syrtos, Syrto Rodou, a dance very widespread in Greek islands and other.\n\nSyrtos Koftos\n\nIs a Greek dance that is danced in the regions of Thessaly, Epirus and central Greece. The name of the dance comes from the cut in tune/music. It is a faster syrto sta dyo style fun dance. When the music stops the dancers yell \"Hey\". When the music stops you also can put your arms up, down, or clap. It can also be danced going backwards and forwards or with partners. \"Koftos\" in Greek means to cut and the music cuts periodically. This is how the name came about.\n\nHerein below is a list of some of the main versions of the Syrto catagorized by the Greek City and Prefecture (County or Region) it comes from according to Wikipedia.\n\nCretan Syrtos\n\nKritikos syrtos means \"syrtos from Crete.\" There are many variations to the dance; every village does it slightly differently. The choreography we use for performances has been developed for a specific piece of Cretan music. The movements of the Cretan Syrtos are calm, sober, and gentle. They constitute the respite before the battle, the resting of the soul, and calming of thoughts. The Syrtos is danced in a manner reminiscent of a religious ceremony that expresses the mystical aspects of life and death, passion and grief of the Cretan spirit.\n\nSyrtos Chaniotikos\n\nThe popular Syrtos Chaniotikos dance is danced to this song from the island of Crete. \"The black clothes (of mourning) are as heavy as iron...\"A religious dance where the dancer expresses himself with figures mostly on the ground rather than on the air. The region of Kissamos in Chania is considered by musicians and dancers as the source of the dance. We observe at the field researches that syrtos (as well as all Cretan dances) presents many variations from province to province and of course from prefecture to prefecture in Crete, a fact that brings out the richness of the music and dance tradition of Crete, but also the intense local expression of Cretans in all the aspects of their lives. We have recorded this dance at Kastelli of Kissamos in Chania.\n\nChortarakia (Syrtos Botaitikos)\n\nA syrtos from Arcadia, it has become a pan-Hellenic dance. The older, two-part syrtos botaitikos from Palaiopyrgos (formerly Bodias) can also be done to this music. This older form of the dance features men and women in two separate lines, the men behind the women. They merge into one line of mixed men and women and then back to the two lines, using the ancient chain hold that can be seen on ancient Greek vase paintings. The song tells of a young man meeting an old man and asking, \"Where are the greens of the meadow, the water from the well?\"\n\nPolitiko Syrto\n\nPolitiko syrto is from the area of Constantinople (now Istanbul) in Asia Minor. Constantinople was referred as \"the city\" (or \"poli\") because of its importance as a seat of culture and trade in the civilized world. Syrto (from the Greek word \"syro\" meaning to pull or, more accurately, to lead) is characterized by its slow-quick-quick rhythm within its 4/4 meter. There is also a similar dance, the Silivrianos Syrtos.\n\nSyrto Kefallonias\n\nThis dance is from the island of Kefallonia in the Ionian Sea. Although most of the Greek islands originally were under the control of the Ottoman Turks, Kefallonia was ruled by the Venetians for several centuries. Thus this dance has a springy, almost Italian quality.\n\nSyrtos Dance From Bornova (Bournovalios Syrtos)\n\nThis is danced to a song entitled Ti Tha Yino, Ego Me Sena (\"What Shall I Become, I with You?\"), the story of an erstwhile courtship:\n\nWhat am I to do with you Panayiotis? You’ve stolen my heart and youth. For three years now you’ve enslaved me and you’vetormented me, but I’ve got your game now, you liar, and know that you’ve no feelings for me. You come to my neighborhood to chat with me, and you come and go in my house and laugh behind everyone’s back. But you must know that my mother will not be ashamed to tell you that you’re a liar and a scoundrel. You better leave before she sees you, and face it, she’ll kick you out, Panayiotis. Then she’ll marry me off to someone else, and I’ll be freed from you, Panayiotis.\n\nSyrtos Sinkathistos\n\nCircle pidikhtos dance, with the steps of simple \"syrtos\" and the squat-steps of \"sygkathistos\", a syrtos dance widespread in Thessaly and Thrace.\n\nSyrtos Makedonias[edit]Syrtos of Makedonia, is another one form of syrtos, danced in the region of Makedonia.\n\nSyrtos Pyleas\n\nThis dance is from a village in Macedonia called Pyleas. We call one of the variations \"arm aloft,\" as dancers raise their arms rhythmically over their heads and back down again. The Dance is mainly done by women.\n\nSyrto Bafra\n\nAlso known as Omali, in the Kerasounta/Giresun region, this dance is called syrto, karshilidiko omal, lakhana (after the name of the song, which means cabbage),kerasountaiko or kotsikton kmal, widespread in Asia minor. It is a 9/8 rhythm and bears no resemblance to what we usually call syrto, which is usually either a 7/8 kalamatianos or 8/8 rhythm. In this case, the name most likely refers to the style, what we call dragging dances.\n\nPomasko Syrtos/Kalamatianos\n\nThis is a dance of the Muslim Pomaks of the Balkans. The first part is identical to the Greek Kalamatianos. Time 7/8, slow quick quick (SQQ), 3 + 2 + 2.\n\nSyrtos Tsirighetikos\n\nThis dance originated in the city of Chania in western Crete and is thus known on Crete as Chaniotikos.\n\nOther Cretan Syrtoi\n\nKolympari, Selino, Mesogea, Pervolia, Rethymniotikos, Anogeia.\n\nOther Syrtoi\n\nSyrto Rodinou, Sytros Thrakis, Prevezianikos Syrtos and Syrtos Mesogitikos."
