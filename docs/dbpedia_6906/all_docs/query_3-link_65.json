        "text": "He is originated from Chordaki Akrotiriou in the province of Kydonia of Chania. The great dancer and dance teacher Myronas Sapountzis firstly taught him the cretan dances during his childhood.\n\nThroughout the first year of his studies in the National Metsovio Institute of Technology (department of topographer, mechanic) he started teaching cretan dances in several Cretan Unions in Attica and Evoia. A few years later, he began writing articles in the cretan press. He is one of the charter members of the \"Pancretan Press Media Union\" and the \"Cretan Folk University\". He has been the special adviser and editor of the annual calendars of the \"Panhellenic Confederation of Cretan Unions\" since 2002.\n\nHe was a dancer in the Greek Dances Theatre of Dora Stratou in the late 80s.\n\nHe was taught the secrets of the cretan dance by great old dancers and musicians of Crete (Konstantinos Papadakis - Naftis, Myronas Sapounzis, Antonis Stefanakis, Antonis Pontikos, Giorgos Mouzourakis). He has been the owner of the website www.cretandance.gr. since 2006.\n\nHe has spent many years studying and searching (interviews, recordings etc.) the history and civilisation of Crete. He has been lecturing about the cretan dances, music, musical instruments, traditional garments and customs.\n\nHe was honoured with the First Praise of Academia Athinon for his study titled: \"The Dances of Crete - legend, history, tradition\" in 2000.\n\nSince 1990 he leads in studying, searching and presenting the folk musical instruments and the traditional dances of Crete, which have been unknown for many years. It is regarded that he is the first one who started doing that. The methodical exposure of all the dances, the kinds of singing, the musical instruments and especially the violin tradition of Crete began on his own initiative in 2001, when he started taking up the musical and artistic provision of numerous (about 50 until now) cultural events. We could also include in this effort his study The folk musical instruments in Crete, part of which was published in 2004 as well as the provision of the cd The dances of Crete (2005, 2006, 2009), which is the only one which contains the music of 20 cretan dances.\n\nHe has taken part as a canvasser in numerous galas and conferences about the culture of Crete, while he has been teaching in seminars in Greece and abroad the steps, the musical canons, the customs and the traditional improvisation of the lead dancer as well as the history of all the dances of Crete, pointing, in addition, the alterations of these things in the last decades. For example, the \"Pancretan Union of America\" invited him to the U.S.A. in 2004, in order to teach in a five week seminar tour in many cities.\n\nHe is also the first one who began talking about the white shirts, the mandila (big head handkerchief) and the red soft fez with the long bobble (which is the original traditional cretan \"hat\"), in his book The history and storiology of the cretan garments (1997,1999), in all the dance shows that he has redacted since 2001 and in the 2009 calendar, which was published by the Panhellenic Federation of Cretan Unions.\n\nSince 2005 he has been making comparative studies among the music and dance traditions of Crete and other regions of Greece, in order to show the numerous things that they have in common and he has presented these studies through shows (Music and dance bridges of Crete and Pontos, Music and dance bridges of Crete and the other Greek islands).\n\nIn 2009 he cooperated with Panagiotis Mylonas in the TV show \"Music Tradition\" (ΕΤ 1), as he took up the responsibility to choose and organize the musical and dance groups and design the programme of two episodes about the music, poetic and dance heritage of Crete.\n\nHe owns a wide collection of engravings from European newspapers and magazines, photographs and postal cards of the 19th and early 20th century, many of which have been published in his books and short - term exhibitions.\n\nHis studies that have been published:\n\nHistory and storiology of the cretan garments, Klassikes Ekdosseis, Athens 1997,1999 (2nd revised publication),\n\nThe Dances of Crete - legend, history, tradition, Kentro Spoudis Kritikou Politismou, Athens 2000 (First Praise of Academia Athinon)\n\nThe folk musical instruments in Crete, Enossi Kriton Metamorphosis, Athens 2004.\n\n90 years since the Union of Crete and Greece, Calendar 2004, Panhellenic Confederation of Cretan Unions.\n\nWorks of Cretan Hagiographers 15th - 17th century, Calendar 2006, Panhellenic Confederation of Cretan Unions.\n\nWorks of Cretan primitives, Calendar 2007, Panhellenic Confederation of Cretan Unions.\n\nCrete and Olympia - Games and Champions, Calendar 2008, Panhellenic Confederation of Cretan Unions.\n\nWars and warriors of the Cretan Freedom, through the Greek and European Folk Iconography, Calendar 2009, Panhellenic Confederation of Cretan Unions.\n\nActors from Crete (born 1866-1925), Calendar 2006, Panhellenic Confederation of Cretan Unions.\n\n- The following books are soon going to be published:\n\nErotokritos of history and traditions\n\nPentozali, a dance, a story\n\nViolin, Lute, Lyra, the great \"leaders\" of cretan music.\n\nMusic and dance bridges of Crete and Pontos\n\nMusic and dance bridges of Crete and the other greek islands\n\nMatching of Cretan History and Tradition.\n\nHe took over:\n\n The editorship (texts and photos) of the 2003 calendar of the Panhellenic Confederation of Cretan Unions, titled The participation of Cretans in the Balkan Wars 1912-13, and he contributed greatly to the creation of the 2005 calendar, titled The protagonists and real masters of the cretan music.\n\n The musical and artistic provision of the cd «THE DANCES OF CRETE» (which was sponsored by the Pancretan Union of America and released by the Greek Music Archives) in 2005 (after two years of systematic recordings in all the districts of Crete) and in which there are included (for the first time) the authentic music of 20 cretan dances. We should point out that in this cd 16 great traditional Cretan musicians take part (Stelios Lainakis, Petros Karpathakis, Baggelis Vardakis, Alexandros Papadakis, Thodoris Polichronakis, Stelios Manousakis and others), playing, almost all, the traditional musical instruments of Crete (lyra, violin, lute, mandolin, lyraki with gerakokoudouna, askobadoura, badura, daoulaki). The cd is accompanied with a 40 page leaflet, in two languages (Greek, English) whose text and photos were also provided by him. It is regarded as the most proper supplement for dancers and dance teachers and this is also shown by the fact that it has already been republished three times.\n\n The configuration of the programme, the music and folklore provision and the responsibility of the choice and organization of the music and dance groups, in two episodes of the weekly TV show \"Music tradition\" on ET1 (provision - presentation: Panagiotis Mylonas), which were shown on May 17th and November 15th 2009, titled: \"Songs and dances from Crete\". We should point out that in these two episodes about 50 traditional musicians and dancers presented 14 different dances, five kinds of songs and eight cretan musical instruments. In this way, the TV viewers had the chance to get to know a really big part of the authentic music and dance tradition of various parts of Crete (Chania, Kissamos, highland Kydonia, Rethimno, Amari, Malevizi, Ierapetra, Sitia), something which was done for the first time. It is highly important that in these shows there were folk violinists, if you take into consideration that this was the first time that violinists appeared officially on the state channel, something which, in fact, countermands the ban of playing cretan music with the violin, which had been asserted during the 50's in the state television and radio.\n\nHis articles have been published:\n\nIn the newspapers: KritikaNea, Horatis Kritis, O Agonastis Kritis, Kritikoi Palmoi and Kritiki Enimerossi, and\n\nIn the magazines: KritologikaGrammata, Kriti, Chorostassi and Kondilies.\n\nHe taught in the Cretan dance seminars which have been held by:\n\n The Pancretan Union of America in partnership with cretan cultural clubs of the U.S.A.\n\nin New Jersey, (10th - 12th January 2003)\n\nin Chicago, (2nd July - 4th June 2003)\n\nin Cleveland, (30th April - 2nd May 2004)\n\nin San Francisco, (6th - 9th May 2004)\n\nin New York, (14th - 16th May 2004)\n\nin Salt Lake City, (21st - 23rd May 2004)\n\nin Denver, (28th - 30th May 2004)\n\n The Cretan Union and the Cultural Centre of the municipality of Nea Philadelphia (Winter of 2003).\n\n The MusicologicalConstitution \"ZISSI\" (10th and 17th December 2004).\n\n The Folklore Club \"PERPEROUNA\" (January 25th and February 1st 2005).\n\n The Dance Groupof the Municipality of Paros (March 6th 2005).\n\n The Cretan Club of Munich and the Confederation of Cretans in Europe (November 26th 2005).\n\n The Centre of Traditional Dance and Percussion instruments \"Vakhes\", (January 29th, February 5th, 12th and 19th 2006).\n\n The Theatre of Traditional Dances \"Dora Stratou\" (Athens, 16th and 23rd March, 2008).\n\n The club \"Idaia Gis\" (Thessaloniki, 28th - 29th March, 2009)\n\n The School of Traditional Dance and Music \"Chorodion\" (Heraklion Crete, 11th-12th July and 12th - 13th December 2009)\n\n The Folklore Association of the Sports Company of Agrinio (Agrinio, 13th-14th March 2010)\n\nHe has taken part as a canvasser in the following events:\n\n- In the 1st Symposium of Cretan Dances, that was held by the Pancretan Union Of America at the Marriot Hotel in New Jersey, U.S.A. 10th - 12th January 2003.\n\n- In the Galaof Cretes Periphery and the Panhellenic Federation Of Cretan Unions in Μ.
