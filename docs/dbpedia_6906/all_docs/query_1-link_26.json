This document provides information about the Greek folk dance Pentozali from Crete. It consists of a line dance performed at a fast pace where the leader performs variations while other dancers maintain basic steps. The dance involves stepping swings where dancers swing their front foot in front and across the back foot. It is considered a proud dance performed with upright posture and light, springy steps that increase in speed as the music builds.",
