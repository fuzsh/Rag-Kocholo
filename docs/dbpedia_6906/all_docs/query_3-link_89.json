        "text": "This paper considers perspectives from dancers within a particular genre of recreational dance known as \"Balkan folk dance\" in the UK. Through asking participants about their understanding of dancing I consider, firstly their preference to Bulgarian dances over Romanian dances, secondly their lack of relationship to Bulgarian dance groups in the UK, and thirdly their ideas and concepts for dancing touching on issues in sensing of movement and connection to music. Dancing communities create their own traditions and values, dances that align to these are adopted and popular, however transporting a dance into a new context does not bring previous traditions, leaving parallel dancing communities separated in participation, but dancing the same dance.___REFERENCE: Green, Nick (2017). “Social dancers in Balkan folk dance performance: communities, traditions and sensory concepts?” Kendra Stepputat (editor), Dance, Senses, Urban Contexts : 29th Symposium of the ICTM Study Group on Ethnochoreology July 9-16, 2016 Retzhof Castle, Styria, Austria:238-247.

ISBN 978-3-8440-5337-7\n\nThe county of Cumbria (former counties of Cumberland, Westmorland and ‘Lancashire-over-the-Sands’ ) is rarely, if ever, considered as a place with a history of morris dancing. However the late Victorian/Edwardian upsurge of interest in patriotic celebrations, incorporating Romantic ideas of ‘Merrie England’, complete with maypoles and morris dancing, saw many Cumbrian towns and villages develop celebrations which included ‘morris dancing’, usually performed by school children. This paper considers the styles and sources of the dances performed at Keswick, Ulverston, Wigton, Blennerhasset, Cockermouth, Workington and Temple Sowerby as revealed through research into newspaper reports, memoirs, photographs and interviews with former performers and teachers.\n\nIn the Banat region of Romania the 'traditional' dance forms of the Banat mountain region are currently practiced in the social dancing within the urban context of Timisoara. Currently, in the city of Timisoara, there is a regenerated interest in dance practices in the ensemble context and for participation at public events. This paper considers an ethnochoreological example of the ‘contra-timp’ way of dancing which was popular in some villages of the Banat mountain zone, and the adoption of this into the ensemble repertoire during the early 1970s. This 'contra-timp' way of dancing has expanded in popularity in the city whilst declining in the villages. I have examined dancing in ‘contra-timp’ from the historical context using prior publications and research archives, and by analysing the repertoire and choreology using participant observation, and interviews with choreographers and dancers to examine their dance understanding in the ensemble and social contexts. REFERENCE: Green, Nick (2012). “Dance practices in Banat: 'contra-timp' from the Banat mountain villages in the urban context.” Elsie Ivancich Dunin; Daniela Stavělová; Dorota Gremlicová (editors), Dance, gender and meanings: contemporizing traditional dance: Proceedings of the 26th Symposium of the ICTM Study Group on Ethnochoreology 2010, Třešť, Czech Republic. 117–123, Prague: Academy of Performing Arts in Prague, Institute of Ethnology of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic. ISBN 978–80–7331–236–7.\n\nCulture has a dynamic structure, and constantly changes. Cultural change takes place when one society is influenced by another. Changing cultures still retain some elements from their past forms. Turkish people arrived in Anatolia about 1000 years ago. Although the life styles in Middle Asia prior to the migration were different, if we look at the current Turkish traditions we can detect many cultural elements that were originally present in that period. Those elements flourished in their natural environment, absorbed aspects of the new cultures they met, and have functioned well until today [Güvenç 1993a]. The cultural values of a society make it a nation. Culture develops in historical context. As long as a nation exists, its cultural values develop or change through the feelings, thoughts and living standards of the citizens. Each nation has its own cultural values, though neighboring nations influence one another and share certain commonalities [Güvenç 1993b]. In this article, we will examine the influences of the various societies that lived in Anatolia on the Turkish folk dances practiced within the borders of the Turkish Republic [And 1990; Eroğlu 1994; Demirsipahi 1975]. Because of the great complexity and variety of dances, we'll limit our study to the music and step structure of the West Anatolian dances.\n\nThe narrative content in Italian dance is revealed at different levels of metaphoric language and it is occasionally reflected in some literary documents. I introduce arguments that arose in the study of common idioms and literary traces with dance. The focus is on the kinetic content of \"Ruggero,\" a couple's dance of Bologna, as found in literature (poetry of Giulio Cesare Croce) from the seventeenth century, crossed with the narrative content and/or structure in the dance and in the music."
