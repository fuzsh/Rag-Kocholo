        "text": "Dances traditionally performed in Greece\n\nGreek dance (choros; Greek: χορός, romanized: chorós) is an old tradition, being referred to by authors such as Plato, Aristotle, Plutarch and Lucian.[1] There are different styles and interpretations from all of the islands and surrounding mainland areas. Each region formed its own choreography and style to fit in with their own ways. For example, island dances have more of a different smooth flow to them, while Pontic dancing closer to the Black Sea, is very sharp. There are over 10,000 traditional dances that come from all regions of Greece. There are also pan-Hellenic dances, which have been adopted throughout the Greek world. These include specifically the Syrtos, Kalamatianos, Pyrrhichios, Ballos, Zeibekiko, and hasapiko.\n\nTraditional Greek dancing has a primarily social function. It brings the community together at key points of the year, such as Easter, the grape harvest or patronal festivals; and at key points in the lives of individuals and families, such as weddings. For this reason, tradition frequently dictates a strict order in the arrangement of the dancers, for example, by age.[2]\n\nGreek dances are performed also in diaspora Greek communities among international folk dance groups.\n\nAntistrophe\n\nCarpaea\n\nChoreia (dance)\n\nCordax\n\nDionysiakos\n\nHyporchema\n\nKorybantes\n\nPyrrhichios (dance)\n\nSyrtos\n\nIn Ancient Greece, dance was a form of ritual, as well as a pastime.[3] Dance could be included in hunting communities, initiation ceremony rituals of age, marriage, and death, entertainment, dance festivals, and religious activity.[4] It was also viewed as a way to educate children about social norms and morals, and was viewed as being essential for physical and emotional development.[5] Dance was used in regard to war as a form of military training, as well as a ritual that served as a mediator between the gods and humans.[6][7] What modern times may consider a parade, military drill, funeral, children’s game, these were seen as forms of dance as long as they were meant to be an exhibition of a rhythmic performance.[8] Suda mention an ancient Greek dance which was called Dipodia (Διποδία), meaning two-step/two-footer.[9]\n\nThe Aegean islands have dances which are fast in pace and light and jumpy. Many of these dances, however, are couples dances, and not so much in lines. See Nisiotika for more information.\n\nThese dances are light and jumpy, and extremely cardiovascular.\n\nEpirote dances are the most slow and heavy in all of Greece. Great balance is required in order to perform these dances.\n\nThe dances of the Peloponnese are very simple and heavy, with the leader of the line improvising.\n\nDances in Macedonia vary. Most are solid and are performed using heavy steps, whilst others are fast and agile. Most dances begin slow and increase in speed.\n\nDances in Thessaly are similar in style to the dances of Epirus. Mostly with slow, heavy movements. However, there are some dances that are also faster paced. The leader can improvise in these dances similarly to those dances from the Epirus, Central Greece and Peloponnese.\n\nNtarsa\n\nPlektos\n\nTsamikos\n\nThracian dance is generally skippy and light. In most Thracian dances, the men are only permitted to dance at the front of the line. Musicians and singers such as Chronis Aidonidis and Kariofilis Doitsidis have brought to life the music of Thrace.\n\nThe dances of (Northern Thrace) are fast, upbeat and similar to the Thracian style of dance. Dances from the town of Kavakli and Neo Monastiri are the most popular.\n\nMain article: Pontic Greek folk dance\n\nThe dances of the Pontic Greeks from the Black Sea were mostly performed by the Pontic soldiers in order to motivate themselves before going into a battle. The dances are accompanied by the Pontian lyra, also called kemenche by Turkish people. Also included are dances traditionally performed by Caucasus Greeks and Greeks in Ukraine. See Horon for more information on the history of these dances.\n\nByzantine dance\n\nHasapiko\n\nTesera Matia\n\nPatinada Nyfis\n\nRododachtilos\n\nPizzica\n\nTarantella\n\nAntipera\n\nHatzistergiou\n\nKalamatianos\n\nKato Stin Aspri Petra\n\nLa Valia di Giannena\n\nSta Tria\n\nSyrtos\n\nApano Stin Triantafilia\n\nChoros Katsa\n\nDespo\n\nDiplos Choros\n\nSta Tria\n\nTsamikos\n\nWithin the United States, Greek Americans participate in Greek dancing in order to preserve their heritage and culture. Greeks of all ages can be seen showcasing their skills at Greek Festivals which take place year round, often hosted by Greek Orthodox churches, or at various competitions in which groups practice dances from specific parts of Greece in order to perform in front of judges.\n\nSince 1976, the Greek Orthodox Metropolis of San Francisco has held a convention that allows Greek Dance groups from various churches in the Pacific Region of the United States to compete. Up to 3,000 people participate annually and it is described as the largest youth ministry program in the Metropolis of San Francisco.[10] Within the competition, there are four divisions, two of which are judged and two of which are exhibition suites. Division I and Division II are judged by a table of judges who have done years of research in Greece and instructed others on the styling and other important elements of Greek dancing. Each competing team will be placed into a division and group based on the average age of the team.[11] Each team performs two times and perfected suites that can be from many places in Greece (islands, mainland, villages) and feature many different dances. The judges will score the teams based on their costumes, singing, stage presence, styling, and how closely it resembles the region that their suite is from.\n\nGreek folk music\n\nDora Stratou\n\nGreek musical instruments\n\nByzantine music\n\nAssyrian folk dance\n\nArmenian dance\n\nKurdish dance\n\nTurkish dance\n\nVideo Medley of dances from northern Greek as danced in Turkey (including Gaida, Sirto, Karaguna, Tsamiko, Vlaha, Zeibek).
