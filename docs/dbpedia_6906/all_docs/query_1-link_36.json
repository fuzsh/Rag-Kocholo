In each movement, traditional thematic material is at first presented in recognizable form before undergoing stresses and procedures that gradually cause it to be subsumed into - and eventually obscured by - concert music idiom.\n\nDrawing on the source material’s historical origins, the work traces an abstracted narrative of the life of a Cretan Resistance fighter during WWII:\n\nI. Maleviziotikos, a sprightly courtship dance for village youths;\n\nII. Erotokritos – \"the judge of love\" – a song type with mature overtones that logically follows from the more innocent dance preceding it;\n\nIII. Pentozali, a fast war dance used to keep soldiers fit for battle;\n\nIV. Syrtos represents the warrior’s philosophical contemplation before engaging in war, and;\n\nV. Tsakonikos, a labyrinthine war dance that depicts the myth of Theseus slaying the Minotaur."
