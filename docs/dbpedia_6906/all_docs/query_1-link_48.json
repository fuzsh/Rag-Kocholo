I am not sure what they mean by the worlds largest mandolin - perhaps they meant the worlds largest assemblage of mandolins - but the Cretan pentozali (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentozali) they mention is the typical dance from Crete, usually to music played on a bowed Cretan lyra (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cretan_lyra)accompanied by a percussively played lute. I guess for this event the dancers will be accompanied by 400 mandolins. Should be quite the sight! Even though the Guinness Book of World Records has largely devolved into a tabulation of contrived carnival freak show stunts (here in America anyway), this is, um, noteworthy. :mandosmiley:"
