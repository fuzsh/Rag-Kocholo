When they dance pentozali, they stomp their feet and move their arms around a lot. It's almost like they're pretending to be lions and tigers, because they look very fierce and strong when they dance. Sometimes, they even wear special clothes to show how important the dance is to them. Overall, pentozali is a fun and exciting way for people in Greece to celebrate and have a good time."
