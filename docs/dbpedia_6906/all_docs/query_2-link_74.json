        "text": "ATHENS—It was called the Pentozali. There I was flinging myself about on the dance floor with 50 other men—all Greeks. It seemed al most an athletic event, but soon we took a break and had a drink called Fix. It happened in one of the tavernas of Mnisikleos Street. I had gone there be cause my New York friends had told me I must.\n\n“Don't miss Mnisikleos,” one said “That's where all the tavernas are. If you want to have a good time and really watch the Greeks live it up after dark, you've simply got to go there.”\n\nScouting Mission\n\nBut before following this advice (and surviving a night out that proved wilder than I had imagined), I had decided to scout the area first in daylight. At first the street proved not so much a problem of pronounciation (me‐nee‐see‐klay‐ohs) as of location. No map of Athens showed the supposedly famous thor oughfare in its labyrinth of streets. And as I stood at the exit of the Monastiraki subway stop, blinking in the afternoon sunshine, I began to wonder if my knowledgeable friends had given me the correct information.\n\n“Stay in Omonia Square, where it's less touristy and more Greek,” one three‐time visitor to Greece had told me. “Take the subway in the direction of Piraeus, and get off at the next stop, Monastiraki. You'll be right by Ifestou Street, where they hold the Sunday Flea Market. Then walk south about six blocks on Areos Street, and you can't miss Mnisikleos, because you'll spot the Acropolis right at the end of the street.”\n\nHowever, as I wandered around the square and checked some street signs, I realized that my friends had neglected to mention one problem—how to read Greek letters. There were a batch of souvenir shops around the square, and persistent questioning—some personnel spoke English—got me headed in the right direction. As one fellow pointed out, Mnisikleos Street was situated in area Number 109 on my map—the Plaka, the oldest residential section of Athens—and the reference key indi cated was a Byzantine church called Metamorphossis.\n\nMore Souvenir Shops\n\nAreos Street, too, was loaded with more souvenir shops, and was a dusty alleyway barely wide enough to allow a car to pass. At every intersection I checked the street sign until, seven blocks later, there it was.\n\nMnisikleos Street is about eight blocks long, terminated by a series of steps that lead to a terraced area. Cobble stoned and no wider than a Volkswagen, lined by squarish two or‐three‐story buildings painted in soft yellows or pinks—or unpainted gray the color of concrete—the street was deserted. It was as quiet as a Mexican village dur ing Sunday mass.\n\nI decided to look over the tavernas that interested me, and check out the food, drinks, entertainment—and prices. The proprietors, I discovered, were in terested in attracting western visitors, because the menus in their windows were printed in English as well as Greek (French and German, too), as were the notices of the entertainers. However, I would have to wait until evening to find out whether they were authentic Greek hangouts or tourist traps.\n\nThere were more than a dozen tav ernes on the street, but most of them were so small that I thought they must be little more than snack bars. So, I concentrated on the “Big Six,” the larger establishments, whose prices varied no more than a few drachmas; say, 100 drachmas for a full meal at Dionysios to 90 for approximately the same food at Sackie. At 30 drachmas to the dollar, it seemed hardly worth the argument.\n\nTwo Top Attractions\n\nDionysios and Mostros seemed to be the top two, as far as variety of menu and entertainment was concerned. The former offered moussaka as its spe cialty and a list of wines from almost all of the Greek islands, plus a group of male dancers, a female singer and the typical bouzouki band. At the Mos tros one could order dolmathakia (rice and meat in vine leaves) and a dessert called galactoboureko (honey pudding), while listening to a singer and the house band.\n\nThe other four tavernas also had bouzouki bands, with Sackie featuring a male solo dancer, and a singer featured dish was called pastitsio (baked macaroni with meat). At Yeros one was urged to sample the avgolemono soup (egg, lemon and rice), while the Calypso recommended an appetizer of taramo salata (red caviar and cheese). Kritch kou had a doubleheader—a special meal with two meat entrées, shishkebab and stuffed grape leaves, and a singing duet. It looked like a busy evening coming up.\n\nShortly after 9:30 P.M., I was again staring at Mnisikleos Street, and dark ness had made a difference. Above the street, the bleached white bones of the Parthenon gleamed mistily under the illumination of several spotlights. The street itself was as brightly neon‐lighted as Broadway, and for a Monday night the crowds were tourist‐thick. I remem bered some more suggestions from my friends:\n\n“A taverna is a restaurant with en tertainment, not a ‘tavern,’ so go there to eat rather than drink. And don't forget, the Greeks eat as late as the Spanish—nine or ten.”\n\n“If you see men dancing with men, don't think they're homosexuals. Greek dancing is done mostly by males, and it's part of their style for men to dance with each other.”\n\n“Sometimes you might be asked to join in the fun. The Greeks won't be insulted if you refuse, but if you don't mind trying a few steps yourself, go ahead. There's no Killer Joe Piro around to rate you on your discotheque techniques.”\n\nRooftop Garden\n\nI jostled my way to the end of the street and up the steps to start my taverna‐hopping at Dionysios. I entered the first floor, which was deserted ex cept for a few waiters who beckoned for me to come upstairs. The second floor, too, was empty, but again a waiter pointed upward, and when I got to the third floor. I discovered that it was an open‐air rooftop garden, and so jammed with clientele that the headwaiter stuffed me in a banquette with two Greek men who apparently didn't mind.\n\nThe area seemed large enough to accommodate about 200 people, with an enclosed bandstand and concrete dance floor at one end, while the guard rails were strung like Christmas trees with colored lights that illuminated windowboxes of flowers. Though most of the patrons were male and looked distinctly Greek—angular features and straight‐sculpted nose—there was a def inite American look, say Copacabana, in the sight of a cigarette girl, a stroll ing photographer and a flower girl looking for customers. The music, though, was Greek to its last quarter tone, with the bouzouki wailing like high‐pitched harp over the rhythm sec tion of guitar, drums and accordion.\n\nI looked over the railing at Mnisikleos Street: still crowded, with people scurry ing in and out of doorways as if on shopping sprees.\n\n“Are you American?”\n\nI turned to my table companions. The shorter of the two, a fellow with thick brush moustache, had spoken in accents so soft he sounded more Span ish than Greek. His cohort, a muscular man with straight hair as black as shoe polish, laughed as I acknowledged the question. The first man continued, “I thought I would remind you, when you order your wine, to say aretsinoto. Un less, of course, you like our retsina wine. But, most Americans do not, so...”\n\nExcellent Muscatel\n\nThis American didn't like resinated wine either. When the waiter arrived, I made certain that I said the magic word, and the man who had spoken—he later told me he had studied archi tecture in Los Angeles and learned his English there—suggested a Samos wine with my moussaka and eggplant salad. When the wine arrived, he told me it was made from the muscat grape, but it certainly tasted like no Bowery brand of muscatel I'd ever tried; it was more like a tawny port, though semi rather than sickeningly sweet. It blended well with the moussaka, filled with piquant Greek spices and topped by grated cheese.\n\nI asked Dimitrios, my new Greek friend, about the preponderance of his countrymen at Dionysios, since I had expected to see at least half the tables occupied by tourists, on the basis of what my New York friends had told me. As Dimitrios explained, “We did not invent the tavernas for the tourists, my friend. They are for our entertain ment more than yours. But do not worry, if you were here in summer you would not even be able to enter Mnisi kleos Street for the size of the crowds. Even we Greeks have trouble going to our favorite tavernas then, and you would probably think they were noth ing but what you would call ‘tourist traps.’”\n\nThe other man, Vassily, agreed, and added, “Yes, in the height of the tourist season we Greeks must play Zorba and dance our way into our tavernas—feet first.”\n\nDancers Appeared\n\nAs if that was their cue, the dancers appeared, wearing their traditional leg gings, boots, skirts and caps.\n\n“That is a Cretan dance,” Dimitrios said. “It is called tsamikos. When you watch a Hawaiian hula, you observe the hands for the message. In Greece, you observe the feet.”\n\nThe dancers, six men, joined hands and began to troop around the dance floor in a closed circle, their legs criss crossing each other in intricate rhythmic patterns. I wondered why they didn't trip each other up. I noticed that they delivered a rousing chorus‐girl kick about every fourth beat, as the drum mer delivered a screaming cymbal clash.\n\n“I must admit I've never seen any thing like this on ‘The Ed Sullivan Show,’” I said. “I assume it's authen tic?”\n\n“Oh, yes,” Vassily said, “but I have seen better.” He turned to me again, saying, “One taverna is not enough for you to get a good impression of authen tic Greek entertainment. Would you like us to show you a few more places that we know?”\n\nWe moved on to Mostros, at the other end of the street. This taverna had its entertainment inside a cavernous wood paneled wine cellar of a room where about 150 of us were crowded around long Bavarian beer hall tables while a buxom Greek miss, whose flowing satin robes revealed just enough to attract our attention but not enough for the police to complain about, gave out with tremolos concerning unrequited love (since she sang in Greek, I could not really he certain). Her eyes, as I'd no ticed with many Greek girls, were huge, and their burnished brown seemed to gleam with a barely‐suppressed fire as she caught, and held, the interest of there.\n\n“Very nice,” I commented, munching my baklava and sipping my ouzo.\n\n“There is more to come,” Dimitrios said. “When she is finished, the dancing will start.”\n\n“Yes,” added Vassily, clapping me on the shoulder. “And then, we will show you some Greek dances. You must dance with us, we will teach you, and you will have some wonderful memories to take back to America with you.”\n\nA few minutes later I found myself on the dance floor with 50 other men, doing not the Bunny Hop or the Snake Dance but the Pentozali, which seemed to be a version of the old “One, Two, Three—Kick!” crossed with the Mashed Potatoes and the Hully Gully. All remember is that my right leg went left, my left leg right, and my body almost went down and over and across one of the tables.\n\nAfterward, they congratulated me on my enthusiasm, if not my dancing. By this time, I had switched to a brand of beer called Fix. Weary, perspiring, my bones creaking and my head aching, I felt that I needed a Fix more than anything else.\n\n“Come, come, wake up!” Dimitrios urged. “We are just beginning to have fun. There is still the Yeros and the Sackie.” Said Vassily, “And the Kritch kou and the Calypso.”\n\nI hardly needed any Calypso choruses at the moment, let alone any more Zorbaesque terpsichorean antics on my part, so I thankfully excused myself and walked into the cool morning air. The subway was closed down, and I needed a cab. Mnisikleos Street was still com paratively crowded — and it was 3:40 A.M. This street, I thought, should have another sign: “We Never Close.”\n\nAs I stopped to catch my breath, I heard a strange sound. Loud, raucous, and electrified, it seemed like rock music, and yet it did not; there was some subtle difference. The music was coming from a place called the Black Cat, a few doors away. I walked there, stuck my head inside the door, looked at the dancers, observed the musicians —and then I knew.\n\nI was listening, for the first time, to an electric bouzouki."
