        "text": "Editor's Notes\n\nAt this point my presentation about the Traditional folk dances of Greece (especialy for Peloponnese &amp; Crete Island) came to it&amp;apos;s end. Thank you for your attention\n\nGreek dance (horos) is a very old tradition, being referred to by authors such as Plato, Aristotle, Plutarch and Lucian. There are different styles and interpretations from all of the islands and surrounding mainland areas. Each region formed its own choreography and style to fit in with their own ways. For example, island dances have more of a &amp;quot;watery&amp;quot; flow to them, while Pontic dancing closer to Black Sea, is very sharp. There are over 10000 traditional dances that come from all regions of Greece. There are also pan-Hellenic dances, which have been adopted throughout the Greek world. These include the syrtos, kalamatianos, pyrrhichios, hasapiko and sirtaki. Traditional Greek dancing has a primarily social function. It brings the community together at key points of the year, such as Easter, the grape harvest or patronal festivals; and at key points in the lives of individuals and families, such as weddings. For this reason, tradition frequently dictates a strict order in the arrangement of the dancers, for example, by age. Visitors tempted to join in a celebration should be careful not to violate these arrangements, in which the prestige of the individual villagers may be embodied\n\nTradition The name Tsamiko literrary means dance of the Chams, however it&amp;apos;s not danced by the specific group.[1] It&amp;apos;s alternative name Kleftikos literally means dance of the Klephts. Tsamiko is danced almost exclusively by men, this dance is strongly reminiscent of the 1821 era in Greek history. Today Tsamiko is a popular dance in festivals and weddings, especially in the rural areas of Central Greece, Peloponnese, Thessaly as well as Epirus periphery, where a slower version is performed.[2] Sometimes the dancers dress in the traditional Greek fustanella. This dance is usually performed to celebrate national events like in the anniversary of the declaration of the start of Greek War of Independence in 1821. The Dance The dance follows a strict and slow tempo not emphasising on the steps, but more on the &amp;quot;attitude, style and grace&amp;quot; of the dancer. The dancers hold each other from each other&amp;apos;s hands, bent 90 degrees upwards at the elbows. It takes a sturdy hand, especially if you are supporting the first or last person of the line (or circle) who will lean on you to perform high acrobatic leaps (usually kicking his right leg up as he takes off followed by the left (in a scissor-like motion), hitting the latter with the back of his hand before landing). The steps are relatively easy but have to be precise and strictly on beat. The dancer might even stomp his foot in response to a strong beat. There is some improvisation involved and many variations of the steps, depending on which area the dancers come from. Over time the dance has taken on many variations. In the past, it was danced exclusively by men, but in modern times both men and women take part\n\nThe roots of Kalamatianos can be found in antiquity. Homer, in the Iliad, describes three performances made around the spear of Achilles that depict a dance in an open circle.[citation needed] The ancient Spartans had a dance called ὅρμος hormos, which was a syrto style dance described in detail by Xenophon where a woman led a male into dance using a handkerchief. Lucian states that the ormos dance was performed in an open circle and was done by young men and women. The men would dance vigorously while the women danced with modest movements. The Kalamatianós is one of the best known dances of Greece. It is a popular Greek folkdance throughout Greece, Cyprus and internationally and is often performed at many social gatherings worldwide. The lead dancer usually holds the second dancer by a handkerchief, this allowing him or her to perform more elaborate steps and acrobatics. As is the case with most Greek folk dances, it is danced in circle with a counterclockwise rotation, the dancers holding hands.\n\nThe roots of Kalamatianos can be found in antiquity.

As is the case with most Greek folk dances, it is danced in circle with a counterclockwise rotation, the dancers holding hands.\n\nThe Pentozali or Pentozalis is the trademark folk dance of the island of Crete. It takes its name from its five basic steps and its sprightly and ultimately very fast pace. The name can thus be translated as &amp;quot;five-steps&amp;quot;, its typically Greek wordplay implying that dancing it can make one step five times over. Also in the spirit of wordplay, ζάλη zali means dizziness, and the name of the dance can also be understood as one that can make the dancers dizzy five times over. The Pentozali is a war dance, vigorous, with high jumping movements. The dancers hold each other by the shoulders and form an incomplete circle, which rotates counterclockwise very slowly, or sometimes not at all, because most of the lively steps are semistationary. The first dancer is expected to improvise engaging in acrobatics; in this case he and the second dancer hold handsand the second dancer stands still so that the first dancer has a stable base on which to perform. Once the first dancer has finished his part, he is expected to break ranks and slowly dance his way to the back of the line, yielding his place to the second, and so on. Women also perform the dance, but their steps are more restrained because their dress does not allow for high jumps\n\nThe Pyrrhichios dance was the best known war dance of the Greeks. It was probably of Doric origin and practiced at first solely as a training for war. Plato describes it as imitating by quick movements the ways in which blows and darts are to be avoided and also the modes in which an enemy is to be attacked. it&amp;apos;s time was quick and light, as is also shewn by the metric foot called pyrrhic. It was described by Xenophon in his work the Anabasis. In that work he writes that at a festival was held in Trapezus to celebrate the arrival of his troops in the city. Also Homer refers to Pyrrihios and describes how Achilles danced it around the burning funeral of Patroclos. The dance was loved in all of Greece and especially the Spartans considered it a kind of light war training and so they taught the dance to their children while still young.s."
