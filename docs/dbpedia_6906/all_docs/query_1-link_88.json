        "text": "From the early- to the mid-1980s, I recorded performances and interviews of immigrant musicians throughout the United States, from Honolulu to New York City.1 With a few exceptions, all musicians were born outside the U.S. Some lived in tight-knit ethnic enclaves, speaking little or no English, others slipped in and out of the mainstream as easily as changing clothes.\n\nEach musician of the twenty-six ethnic groups I visited had a story to tell about preserving a world of the past and adapting to a new world of the present. These micromusics (Slobin 1993) faced in to the ethnic community and out to the majority society.\n\nFrom these interviews and performances, I produced twenty-six half-hour audio documentaries which were broadcast on public radio in the U.S. (Signell 1983, 1985a) and later published on audio cassette (Signell 1989, 1990). A print article describes experiences of Asian musicians documented in the audio series and elaborates on the relationship between scholar and informant (Signell 1985b).\n\nFour of the audio documentaries feature Mediterranean musicians: Turkish, Greek, South Slav (Bosnian, Macedonian, and Serbian), and Albanian. Each half-hour documentary has extensive performance examples interspersed with interviews and commentary. Interviews often reveal a musician's problems, hopes, and strategies for playing traditional music in new surroundings. The interviews and music below are excerpted from those documentaries. Disclosure links to the relevant paragraph in my Tales article in this issue of EOL follow each of the ethnic subheadings below.\n\nThe small size of the Turkish population in America makes it nearly impossible to sustain local music groups and makes them dependent on recordings and visiting artists. Since 1973, Turkish soloists and troupes such as the Mevlevi (Whirling Dervishes) have given brief tours of the United States and have gradually built an audience among Turks and Americans.\n\nIn 1982, touring classical Turkish virtuosos Necdet Yaşar (tanbur lute) and Niyazi Sayın (ney flute) performed to a full house at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York City. Yaşar and Sayın could be considered a special case of \"immigrant\" in the sense that both taught Turkish music at the University of Washington in Seattle, and both have toured extensively in America.\n\nAlthough musicians of the pre-World War Two generation learned and performed the repertoire in the oral tradition, educated, urban Turkish musicians such Yaşar and Sayın usually read from notation (Cf. Shiloah). But the great singers and the great vocal repertoire of Turkish music reign supreme in Turkey (ibid.)\n\nTurkish orthography corrected June 8, 2011\n\nBut a Cretan musician in America cannot play only pentozali:\n\nPeople are expecting me here [America] to play [mainland] Greek music. They don't know Cretan music, they know Greek music. Even the Greeks, because they are mixed, they are not just Cretans ... The only change that happened to me is that I had to play some other stuff besides the Cretan stuff--from mainland also. So that other people could dance also, not just Cretans. [Cf. \"performer-audience contract\" in Slobin 1993].\n\nSo Daskalakis played for panegyri (feast days) and weddings. \"I sang rebetika, and Greek songs with another orchestra with violin, mandolin, klarino. We play for a few festivals around and celebrations.\"\n\nHe said most Greek music he encounters is pan-Hellenic. Lots of groups go far away from traditional Greek music--modern songs made in Greece. \"It's a kind of bridge between Greece and United States, for Greeks. [They] play modern Greek songs. [They sing] 'Never on Sunday' in Greek.\"\n\nDaskalakis was surprised that he could learn new Greek dances in America:\n\nI've learned some dances here myself that I didn't even know existed. I learned from Greek-Americans and Americans--they did some research. There are lots of Greeks; they didn't dance in Greece. They came over and wanted some kind of identity. One way of expressing that--the Greek identity is dancing, right?--so they learned some Greek dances.\n\nHalkias\n\nAnother Greek musician, the celebrated Perikles Halkias, told of no struggle to maintain his identity. A professional musician from an early age in the mountains of Epirus in northwestern Greece, Halkias performed the same music for a half century after coming to America. In 1985, the US government named Halkias a National Heritage Fellow (akin to Japanese \"Living National Treasure\" or English Knighthood). I recorded Halkis, the last living great artist of this Epirus folk instrumental tradition, at his apartment in New York City in 1982. In an interview, he reminisced about his early days as a musician in Epirus.\n\nSouth Slav\n\nI recorded South Slavs3 (Serbs, Bosnians, and Macedonians) at the 1981 Festival of American Folklife from the public sound system mix board. Americans identifying themselves as Serbs numbered about eight million in the 1971 census.The 1990 census shows 544,270 Croats (0.2%), 257,994 \"Jugoslavs\" (0.1%), and 116,755 Serbs [the Census only reports self-identification; it does not attempt to explain the results]. A large concentration of Serbs resides in the greater Chicago area, the home of \"Beogradski Suveniri (Belgrade Souvenirs)\" ensemble.Folklorist Richard Marsh, of Croatian ancestry, described a typical South Slav picnic.\n\nPeople are buying chunks of lamb. Usually it's wrapped up in this paper. You gotta have green onions with your lamb. Maybe they'll pour a little section of salt over in the corner of your piece of paper. [Then you'll be] tearing off a piece of meat with your fingers, dipping it into the salt, taking the green onions, taking a swig on your beer ... Then there'll be a band.\n\nRedjovic did not live in a hermetically sealed musical world. He said he enjoyed rock, country, Elvis Presley, and Engelbert Humperdink. Folklorist Marsh observed a pattern to Americanization of South Slav music.\n\nIt's important to know that the Americanization is not a willy-nilly acceptance of all American music. Musicians and the people who listen to music have esthetics, and they select those aspects of American music that are appealing to their esthetic in their own tradition. Generally, they tend to go for the more melodious things, tunes like the theme from Dr Zhivago, faintly Eastern European flavor helps. \"Fiddler on the Roof\" tunes, those are very widely accepted. They like country music. The little kids may like hard rock. But that's put in a whole other category. There are tamburica (Croatian ensemble) boogie-woogie numbers, tamburica versions of Ray Charles' \"What I'd Say.\" And these numbers have a specific place in the repertoire. In no sense is the music becoming totally assimilated to the point where it won't be distinguishable from other American musics.\n\n\"Makedonski Trubaduri (Macedonian Troubadors)\" called Lorraine, Ohio in the Midwest their home. Where their Serbian and Bosnian colleagues performed harmonized melodies, the Macedonian Troubadors stuck with traditional single-line melodies and drum. A good clarinetist must be agile, creative, and inspired, said their soloist, Bob Yankelovic.\n\nAlbanian\n\nAn estimated 70,000 Albanians, Geg and Tosk, immigrants and descendants, lived in America at the time of my recordings. In a suburb of Detroit, Michigan, America's heartland, I found an Albanian dervish monastery. Baba Rexhep, the venerable head (sheikh) of this Bektashi sect of Islamic devishes, explained to me his mystical concept of sound and music. The elevation of all sounds to a religious experience extends (or is perhaps the converse) of \"music as an elevating factor of the religious experience\" (Cf. Shiloah).\n\nAn Albanian wedding\n\nSome of the most popular records from the \"Golden Age\" of ethnic records in the U.S. were skits which re-created a traditional wedding. My visit to Detroit to record Baba Rexep coincided with a full-scale wedding of a South Albanian couple. The power of sounds to enhance a simple story is as effective for us today as the ethnic records were for the immigrant.\n\n1. Father of the bride, on the day before the wedding, in suburban Detroit:\n\nMy name is Zihni Man�e. I am the father of the bride. Today is the happiest day of my life, because my daughter is going to get married. I'm really am a little bit excited, but on the other hand I'm happy, I'm really happy. This is the first time in my house--\"eating\" we say--to celebrate my daughter's wedding.\n\nSummary\n\nMusicians adjust or change styles to earn a living. Some survive by merging into a larger musical culture, as did Emin Gündüz from Turkey, playing in a pan-Middle Eastern ensemble in Washington; and Perikles Halkias from Greece, who undoubtedly also played in such ensembles in New York. Erg�n Tamer from Turkey merged into a Turkish-Arabic musical alliance. For personal, not survival reasons, Pavlos Dhaskolakis merged his Cretan identity into a larger Greek identity as he distanced himself from his homeland.\n\nOther authors in this issue of EOL continue the theme of Mediterranean musicians who adapt. Magrini follows a single Greek musician's stylistic odyssey in Musical identities of Kostas Papadakis. Pettan finds Croats taking on new musical lives in Janjevo and Australia in The Croats and the question of their Mediterranean musical identity. Gronow and Spottswood take up the immigrant adaptation theme in print in American Folklife Center 1982 as does Slobin 1993 and many others.\n\nBruno Nettl's online article, \"Relating the present to the past,\" puts musical change in an anthropological perspective."
