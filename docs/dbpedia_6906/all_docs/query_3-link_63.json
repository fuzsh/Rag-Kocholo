        "text": "In Greece, traditional or municipal dances are characterised by the dances of mainly rural areas, a product of oral tradition. Unlike other types of dances that are characterised by the “surname and staff”, the traditional dances are characterised by the “anonymous and collective” and are a bridge to the past. Traditional dances are meant to bring the community closer to important events throughout the year, such as Easter, Clean Monday, grape picking and the wine-making ritual, various regional and local festivals, special events such as weddings, etc.\n\nThere are 3 types of Greek traditional dances:\n\nCollective dance, where everybody is dancing.\n\nGroup dance, only for groups of men or women (“Pentozali”, “Serra”, „Trata”).\n\nPair dance.\n\nTraditional dance may have different characters and styles, with different tempo and rhythm. Still, it is a dance full of vitality expressing feelings, history and soul. It is always joyful because it follows us every step of human life. The movement richness of traditional dance brings the joy, the temperament and the energy that exist in every region of the country. We have simple and slow dances, but also fast, energetic, bold dances. For example, the number of dance steps is the same all along the dance, but different in every region: in Roumelia dance has 8 steps, in Epir and Thessalia there are 10, in Konitsa there are 14 steps. ”Tsamiko” dance from Epir has a slow, temperate motion, but in Peloponnese we have the beauty of jumping, joyful, easy movements, expressing the happiness of living and dancing with others. Dance was first of all a social event. We should look at it like a treasure that belongs to every generation.\n\nDance is composed of movement, expression, but the most important is gesture. Gestures can be mild, energetic, emphasized, delicate, slow or fast.\n\nEach Greek dance has its history and tradition, different reasons that led to its creation, and of course it is danced in various areas of Greece. Going deeper on the specificity of each area of Greece, we will find exciting rhythms and dances, ranging from love, romance, to passion, to the painful memory of the wars that took place in the Greek realm.\n\nGreek folklore has a strong diversity of traditions and customs regarding traditional attire, dances, and music. Certain Greek regions can be easily recognised due to some specifc musical instruments. All these “clues” make us easily differentiate an exact area of origin that concerns a Greek dance even from the first notes. Their diversity can be observed by following an ethnic-geographical route starting from the northernmost region inhabited by the Greeks, the Pontus region (now in Türkiye), to the southernmost point, as well as the island of Crete."
