        "text": "By Mary Tzagournis\n\n(OSU Student, Spring 2019)\n\nGrowing up in a Greek Orthodox Church, I was always surrounded by dancing. Whether this be at the Greek Festival, GOYA basketball tournaments, Folk dance festivals or Greek weddings. I was intrigued by the colorful costumes, the coin skirts and pom-pom shoes worn by the evzones and wanted to learn why. Greek dancing has been a big part of my life but not till I got older and really learned to appreciate the art of it. Being able to walk into a room of other fellow Greeks that one may not even know and start holding hands to perform a dance is something that is so special. I always loved dancing because everyone is joined together to unite as one and dance to the traditional music. The Greek Americans I have encountered at camp, Goya and Church, love Greek dancing. They all know a Greek song as soon as it comes on, jumping out of their seats at dinner to do a simple Kalamatianos or an upbeat techno pentozali, always energizes the crowd and gets everyone at an event involved.\n\n…\n\nThe tradition of Greek dancing and incorporating this culture with family, connects family and makes them grow stronger together. As stated from an article by Sofia Kalogeropoulou, “Characterized by circular formations and simplicity in their steps (often at a walking pace), folk dances allow for the participation of every generation, young and old.” By children dancing together with their parents, they are able to keep a tradition going through generations and teach their culture to next generations. I think that by family participating in dance together joining as one, makes a big impact on the relationships as well as between the children, grandparents and parents. As they are learning these dances and performing them together, they are able to share a common activity that can be cherished for years in the future generations. “The fact that children participate in the same dances as their parents and their parents’ parents illustrates that they belong to the same cultural family and share a common heritage and dance tradition.” This has the ability to unite a family and lets them share commonalities that most other cultures might not have.\n\nIn my own experience when attending Greek weddings, all my relatives all know how to Greek dance and will dance when Greek music is played. I always love seeing my aunts, uncles, sibling and cousins be brought together by Greek dancing. It is truly something special about our Greek culture that we can hold hands and do simple steps that everyone knows to a song. When my friends that are not Greek see Greek dancing, they are intrigued and most people that don’t know how try to learn. As Sofia Kalogeropoulou notes in her ethnography, “folk dance generates a sense of pride that is consciously associated with the nation and the nation’s ancestry, but, as Christos, another of my interviewees, pointed out, dance can also physically manifest the feeling of pride.” I feel very proud to know the Greek dances through dancing for the Columbus Greek festival. I have met my other Greek friends through Greek dancing and we have such a fun time together learning the dances. I think that being able to go to any Greek event and know how to dance is gives me a sense of belonging and pride."
