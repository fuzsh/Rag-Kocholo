        "text": "There's actually a lot more to Greek music than first meets the ear.\n\nThe most common line dance is the kalamatiano syrto, most commonly referred to by either name. It comes in varying tempos, a lot of the more pop-styled tunes are faster and more of the traditional tunes are slower. Based upon where the footsteps are in the picture that Steve Cie posted, it appears that this is what they are doing.\n\nOther common Greek party dances include the tsamiko (very slow tune, often has nifty clarinet ad-libbing), the zembekiko (slow partner dance), and the tsiftetele (fast partner dance or commonly danced in partners with belly dance-like moves, depends upon speed and crowd)\n\nCertain crowds may request a hassapiko, sometimes referred to as the sailor's dance. There's also the epirotiko, for which there are common steps, but some families have their own steps, so again, I would only play this by request. (If it's a festival for a Greek church, these would all likely get played anyway.)\n\nThere's also a hassoposerviko, which is a line dance typically danced with arms locked (hands on shoulders), rather than holding hands. Another good one for a Greek crowd that is dancing a lot. Don't play two in a row though, because they take up a lot of energy.\n\nAnd then there are the common dances from Crete. These are typically only played if requested, because there has to be a good-sized group of dancers who know these. The ones that I have found to be most common are the pentozali, the malevisiotiko, and the haniotiko syrto. The first two are very fast, danced lightly on the balls of the feet (they put Riverdance to shame, in my opinion), and involves ad-lib steps, usually from the men. The latter is slower. There is also a sousta, which is a partner dance from Crete.\n\nWell, I've just written a really long post about the different common Greek dances. There are some common/traditional songs, but I don't know the names of them. I have also learned other dances, but those were for dance troupes and not for common dance. There are also different traditions and unwritten rules to Greek dancing that are not necessarily followed anymore, but I think that the different dance types are most important for a DJ to know.\n\nBy the way, I don't know this just because I'm of Greek descent. Greek weddings were my dad's bread-and-butter in DJing when I was growing up. I also learned a lot about using Greek tunes with \"American\" tunes in different sets. I attended and partied at a lot of Greek festivals. Also, I was a member of a couple of Greek dance troupes when I was in high school.\n\nOkay, before this post gets any longer....\n\nDucky, with all that aside...What would be the Top 10 tunes to play at a wedding where Greek music has been requested. I have one coming up, the bride is Italian and the groom is Greek. Thanks in advance!\n\nA major traditional Greek wedding dance song is \"Orea Pou Ine I Nifi Mas\" which if I'm not mistaken is roughly translated to \"How Beautiful the Bride Is.\"\n\nThe only copy I can find on Amazon is track 3 of the soundtrack to My Big Fat Greek Wedding, shown here: Amazon.com: My Big Fat Greek Wedding: Various Artists: Music@@AMEPARAM@@http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51D1AuX2n2L.@@AMEPARAM@@51D1AuX2n2L\n\nIt's a good copy of it.\n\nOther than that, there's no real Top 10 list that I can give you.\n\nGlykeria is a great singer to get. Here's a link to a hits collection of hers: Amazon.com: Best of Glykeria: Glykeria: Music@@AMEPARAM@@http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GAmGvUdDL.@@AMEPARAM@@51GAmGvUdDL\n\nMost of it is stuff that would be good for dinner, but there are a couple of peppier dance tunes in there.\n\nMy best advice is to ask the bride and groom what they're looking for, if they want Greek music. Is it for dinner or dancing and how much Greek music do they want? Ask them for direction...what artists do they like? Are they looking for traditional songs or new pop?\n\nI've done some looking around and you might find this site helpful for ordering music (on top of Amazon): http://www.greekmusic.com/\n\nI hope this post helps you some."
