        "text": "Today the weather ist not very good …. is cold and wet!! So its a good opportunity to write about something else.\n\nThe Pentozali is one of the most popular cretan dances and has his roots in the Sfakia, more exactly in Anopolis…..\n\nThe history of the Pentozalis starts in 1769…. Ioannis Vlachos, better known as Daskalogiannis was born in Anopolis, Sfakia. Daskalogiannis saw in the Orlow revolt , the so-called Orlofika, the chance of a renewed uprising of the Cretans against the turks…. in autumn, 1769 he called together all his partisan leaders and persuaded them that it is the right moment for a revolution…. so it should become the big uprising against the turks and the well known Daskalogiannis Revolution….. On the 10th of October, 1769 this revolution was finally decided by these 12 partisan leaders, with head of the Daskalogiannis, … in addition to that Daskalogiannis wante a certain dance…. Daskalogiannis called the lyre player Stefanos Triandafillakis “Kioro” to Anopolis to prepare this dance…. Kioro remained 6 months in Anopolis up to the beginning of the Revolutioin.\n\nDaskalogiannis wanted a war dance, this dance should contain 12 changes and 10 steps. 12 changes for the 12 partisan leaders and 10 steps for the day in the Revolutiuon finally was decided, 10th of October…..\n\nThe 12 partisan leaders were…Protopapas, Giorgos Daskalakis (Sapolis Daskalogiorgakis), Antroulis Morakis (Koutroumpas), Manousakas, Androulios Vouloudakis (Vardakas), Stratis Vordoumpas (Bourbachis), Manousos Koutsoumpas, Giorgos Skordilis, Giorgos Pateros (Paterogiorgis), Manousos Bonatos, Hourdos and of course Daskalogiannis hisself.\n\nDaskalogiannis called this dance Pentozali “pempto Zali” for the fifth “Step” against the turks, the fifth attempt for the liberty from the turks …\n\nThe revolution ended in a bloodbath, because the Russians did not come as expected to the support. Daskalogiannis and many others were murdered, but the Pentozalis the dance of the Daskalogiannis revolution survived till this days and is one of the most popular and best known cretan dances!!!\n\nHere is video of the annual commemoration ceremony of Daskalogiannis in Anopolis…\n\nThe following film is a documentation of the Pentozali, shooted in Anopolis with different people from Sfakia which describe the history of the Pentozalis and talk about what they feel if they dance the Pentozali…unfortunately this film is only in greek language, but neverless I think its worth to see it… just the music and the pictures are really quite special!!"
