        "text": "Those days of pre-election optimism and pompous statements to voters in Crete are long gone, it seems. The then runner-up and today's PM addressed the crowds telling them that the entire of Europe will dance to the steps of the famous Cretan folklore dance called \"Pentozali\" and we would be the ones setting the tone. The masses bursted out in hysteria, excited about this new form of relationship with our European suppressors, where roles were portrayed in complete contrast to reality, as we knew it and lived it on own our skin for the last five years. The masses were literally hypnotised by this hypothetical image with which they were fed, and I am sure everyone was day-dreaming about it, as if it were in fact happening. The impact of this communication trick was so effective, that it was adopted subsequently in every speech that was given by the PM in every part of the country, only changing the reference from Cretan \"Pentozali\" to each local dance every time. And then came reality, as it stands today. The numbers don't add up, cash is running out far too quickly to even be able to subsidise and prolong the pre-election illusion in the minds of people. The uplift of our national pride for political split-seconds is followed by the national humiliation we will have to undergo and endure in the next few months to years. And while everyone has come to terms with the fact that it is rather unlikely to witness anyone in Brussels, Berlin, Paris or elsewhere in Europe dancing \"Pentozali\", the boldest and more perceptive ones among them are already taking-up \"Shuhplattler\" lessons. We know that we are not fond of the German tune that goes with this dance, we find the steps probably ridiculous and the posture of the body not \"proud\" enough to adopt. There is nothing \"warlike\" in this dance, therefore we reject the entertaining aspect of it \"a priori\". There is nothing pompous in the rhythm, no bold statement that can be extracted from its steps, it is just on the verge of absurdity for the average Greek. But it is what it was meant to be. A simple, practical way of pure entertainment. When Germans dance, they dance. When they do politics, they do politics. It is very simple. They don't mix apples with oranges, they don't dilute the nature of things, they are basically straightforward, simple and effective. When we dance, it is a form of politics, when we do politics it has a heavy underlying entertainment tone to it. In other words, to the average eye, we would probably make the impression that we are confused, puzzled, not focused enough and therefore ineffective. Does that remind you of anyone these past few weeks?"
