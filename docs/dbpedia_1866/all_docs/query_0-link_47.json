        "text": "A former indie rock & metal-core frontman, Clever Girl is certainly no stranger to the music world, just a slightly different one. From a long history of being in national touring acts like the Human Flight Committee and To Speak of Wolves, the decision was made to embrace his passion for electronic dance music and start a new project. Thus, Clever Girl was born. In just a few short months, Clever Girl has recorded material for a full length album with co-producer Brooks Paschal (Versa Emerge, There Fore Tomorrow), released official remixes for The Voice's star Casey Desmond and Boston favorite Ingrid Gerdes, as well as popular online bootleg remixes of Britney Spears, Rihanna, Skrillex and more. With obvious love for all forms of EDM, Clever Girl produces a vast array of tracks from electro to house to electronic pop to even a little taste of dubstep. Since the initial release of the first bit of music and upon bringing the act live out, Clever Girl has already played some of the biggest dance parties in the Boston area, including earning a residency at one. Lacing every performance with the raw energy of his days of a rock frontman, you can expect nothing but the best live shows, fully equipped with glowing DJ table and a glowing \"Clever Girl\" sign that literally lights up the dance floor. In less than a year's time, having already opened for the likes of Zedd, Porter Robinson, Mustard Pimp, Dieselboy, The M Machine, Kids At The Bar, Drop Goblin, DJ Bl3nd and many more, he is quickly gaining steam. Now that his take over of the New England area has begun, rest assured, the country and then the world are next. soundcloud.com/iamclevergirl /// Instagram: @aaronflight /// Twitter: @imCleverGirl /// iamclevergirl.tumblr.com /// facebook.com/WeAreSymbiote\n\nShow More"
