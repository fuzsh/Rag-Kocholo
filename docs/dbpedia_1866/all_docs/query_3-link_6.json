        "text": "Photo by Tiny Studio\n\nWhen a band calls themselves Grrrl Gang, you can basically guess what they sound like, and you would not be wrong. The Jakarta based band might add a little more pop into their blend of riot grrrl based punk, but I can't imagine anyone who loves punk isn't going to like \"Spunky!\" It's a fast paced punk rocker that still has a melodic edge to it that keeps the song surprisingly fun. It sounds more like if The Beths decided to go more punk, and if that doesn't appeal to you, I have no idea what you're even doing here.\n\nThe song describes singer Angeeta Sentana's experiences during a manic episode. She explains:\n\n“I feel like I’m on top of the world, untouchable. I do things without thinking, always chasing after that feeling of instant gratification. I feel extra confident in myself—to a point of grandiose thinking—and that I could do anything.\"\n\nYou can watch the video for \"Spunky!\" below. The album Spunky! is due out September 22 on Kill Rock Stars (US), Trapped Animal Records (Europe), and Big Romantic Records (Japan and Taiwan). It's available for pre-order here.

Considering Berman now lives in New Jersey, it's very easy to compare any roots based singer/songwriter to Bruce Springsteen, but in the case of this song it's also very apt. \"Lucifer's Glory\" isn't quite as anthemic as Springsteen's arena rock hits, but it's also not quite as stripped down as Nebraska. This one is more like early Springsteen when he was still working it out at The Stone Pony and before he was a national sensation. The star quality is still there, but in a bit of a more scrappy, indie rock kind of way.\n\nKip Berman says of his new single:\n\n\"Don’t let the title fool you— It’s not a full throated 'Hail Satan,' but it is full throated. I suppose I could’ve called it 'Paradise Lust.'\n\n\"When you hit rock bottom, but wish you could fall deeper - when you’re proud to lose, ‘cuz you know the kind of people who win- when only what’s missing remains…\n\n\"Sure, It’s perverse, crushing, and wrong. But it’s also alright. There were other options, but only one choice. That’s Lucifer’s Glory.\"\n\nYou can listen to \"Lucifer's Glory\" below. Summer of No Light is due out September 1 on Dirty Bingo Records, and is available for pre-order through Bandcamp.

The Denver based band have created a song that almost sounds like something that could easily be played on an Adult Contemporary radio station if it wasn't so odd. It's just soaking in too much reverb to ever to considered mainstream, even though Chris Bowers Castillo just has a voice your mom would adore.\n\nYou can listen to \"Softy\" below.

His 2021 album Two Saviors was a favorite of mine, and now he's back with new music. \"Haunted Mountain,\" co-written with Jolie Holland, is a ramblin' style country song. It has just the slightest hints of indie rock, but other than that this is just a straight up country/Americana track. It's an upbeat song that just has a timeless quality. It feels like it could have been released any time in the last fifty to sixty years. In fact, the occasional indie rock guitar has some roots in Neil Young, which adds more to the timeless quality.\n\nBuck Meek says of his new song:\n\n“It’s about being humbled by the thing you’re drawing power from only at which point an actual, fair relationship begins.\"\n\nYou can watch the video for \"Haunted Mountain\" below. The album Haunted Mountain is due out August 25 on 4AD, and is available for pre-order here. For more on Buck Meek, check out the artist's website. Upcoming tour dates are below the video.\n\nFri.

Previously only available on the vinyl compilation Punk Rock Saves Lives... The Album! Vol. II, \"This Song is Sponsored by Absolut Vodka\" takes on the commercialization of Pride by corporations. It's a smart, loud, and fast punk rock song that ends with the repeated mantra of \"We're the product.\" This is just pure classic punk rock. It's buzzsaw guitars and growled vocals with just enough melody and pop hooks to make it appealing to semi-mainstream audiences.\n\nYou can listen to \"This Song is Sponsored by Absolut Vodka\" below. The song is currently available via Bandcamp. For more on Middle-Aged Queers, check out the band on Facebook and Instagram.\n\nThis Song Is Sponsored By Absolut Vodka by Middle-Aged Queers\n\nPhoto by Mathieu Bitton\n\nReleased just before the one hundred and second anniversary of the Tulsa Race Massacre which saw the affluent black neighborhoods of Tulsa bombed and burned by the white population, Chris Pierce has released a new song about the dark historical event. \"Tulsa Town\" is a haunting waltz that is mostly folk, but also combines elements of jazz. It's an important song that reminds us of one of the darkest and forgotten elements of American history. Pierce hits the perfect tone for a song of this nature. It's respectful and reverent while still being a gorgeous song that can suck you in even if you're not paying attention to the lyrics. Backing vocals and strings are used expertly, giving the song a truly haunting feeling.\n\nYou can watch the lyric video for \"Tulsa Town\" below. Let All Who Will is due out September 1 via Friends at Work/Downtown Distribution. For more on Chris Pierce, check out the artist's website.\n\nPhiladelphia's Achings started in one of the most organic ways possible. Singer/songwriter Rebecca Joy had just started maternity leave and overheard one of Justin Myer's guitar tracks. She immediately wrote the accompanying melody and lyrics on the spot, and Achings was formed.\n\nThe duo's latest single, \"Need for Love,\" starts off as this gorgeous and lush alt-rock/pop song that is instantly going to appeal to fans of Phoebe Bridgers, Julia Jacklin, and Lucy Dacus. But halfway through, the song gains an unexpected intensity, particularly in the guitar. As intense as the guitar gets, it somehow adds to the beauty of the song. It's an indie rock explosion that increases the depth of the song. \"Need for Love\" is the kind of song you're going to want to immediately start again once it's over, and it only gets better with repeated listens.\n\nYou can watch the video for \"Need for Love\" below. All These Shapes, All These Days is due out July 14 on LandLand Colportage, and is available for pre-order here. For more on Achings, check out the band's Bandcamp and Instagram.\n\nPhoto by Gina Brown\n\nKurt Baker's latest single puts the power in power pop. \"Anchors Up\" isn't quite punk, but there is too much of an edge to the song to be purely pop. This is sugary sweet power pop that can still be sung by a guy wearing a leather jacket. It has elements of artists like the Ramones, The Kinks, Green Day, and The Beach Boys. As you can probably guess, this is the kind of song that is perfect for the start of the summer, complete with lyrics about sailing and driving with the top down. Sometimes rock can just be fun, and Kurt Baker has that concept down.\n\nKurt Baker says of his new song:\n\n\"‘Anchors Up’ started around an idea I had while living in Spain during the lockdown confinement. Being confined to your house was not a great experience, but I remember I used to take my guitar and play it next to my window, to get some sunlight. I guess the rays of sunshine brought a happy upbeat melody to my mind, definitely with the flavor of something Green Day might have recorded on their ‘Warning’ album, or maybe even the Kinks, which coincidently, I think Green Day was listening to a lot when they recorded ‘Warning’. Anyway, I had this demo, and the lyrics were just kinda silly. When I sent it to Little Steven to listen to he told me straight up that the song was way too 'happy' sounding! I’m very fortunate to have the ability to work with somebody like Steven, who knows his music, and his feedback and critique of my ideas are so extremely valuable. The song took another direction, once I sat down with my best buddy Geoff Palmer to work on the lyrics. Now the track has this sort of ‘Sloop John B’ vibe to it. Almost a bit of a maritime thing going.. Anchors, drunk captains… You know, I’m from Maine so I’ve been on a boat, and I’ve been around a lot of drunk captains and captainesses, or so they say they are! I’m very very excited for ‘Anchors Up’ to be the lead kick-off single for my new album ‘Rock N Roll Club’. Dig it!\"\n\nYou can watch the video for \"Anchors Up\" below. A limited edition 7\" blue vinyl will be released on June 30 via Wicked Cool Records, and is available for pre-order here. The song will also be available on Rock 'n' Roll Club, which is due out on September 29.

The neo-soul band's latest single, \"Without You,\" has this perfect quality that makes it sound like it's a lost track recorded back in the 60's or 70's. Part of it is the production style that puts that vintage sheen over the song, but The Sextones are clearly going for a classic sound. Everything about \"Without You\" just sounds classic. (Except for their name, which I can't imagine would have flown with record executives sixty years ago...) This is the kind of feel good song that most people would say they don't make anymore, unless you know where to look.\n\nYou can listen to \"Without You\" below. Love Can't Be Borrowed is due out September 29 on Record Kicks, and is available for pre-order here. For more on The Sextones, check out the artist's website.\n\nPhoto by Donald Milne\n\nScotland's Teenage Fanclub have been indie darlings since forming in 1989, so they have a ton of credibility, and have had it for decades. Their latest single, \"Foreign Land,\" sees the band mellowing out a bit and going slightly into a more Americana laced territory. The song gives off some serious Wilco vibes, with harmonies more along the lines of The Band. The whole thing is more psychedelic than indie rock, but it keeps the band's power pop roots intact. It's a fun and rambling song that may surprise fans of their 90's albums, but if you're ready to embrace Teenage Fanclub as dad rock (with some killer organ work!), \"Foreign Land\" will be perfect for you.\n\nRaymond McGinkley says of their upcoming album and new song:\n\n“When we got offered ten days in Rockfield, we weren’t ready in our minds but then we just thought, ‘Fuck it’ and went for it. If you’re sitting around waiting for the stars to align, you can end up never doing anything. We turned up and worked our way through ideas, and came up with some while we were there. The song 'Foreign Land' was born in the studio. If we hadn’t gone there at that point through happenstance, that song wouldn’t exist. We like to let things happen. As people, we find a deadline inspiring. We like to put ourselves on the spot and see what happens. We usually get away with it. This record is the cliche of the blank canvas, which thankfully we managed to fill.”\n\nYou can watch the video for \"Foreign Land\" below. Nothing Lasts Forever is due out September 22 on Merge Records, and is available for pre-order here.

(I mean, we love covers and we love Juliana Hatfield, so win-win...) Now, she's adding a third to her repertoire and Juliana Hatfield Sings ELO is due out in November. ELO would be my least favorite of the three artists Hatfield has selected to cover, but even I can't resist the first single, \"Don't Bring Me Down.\" Hatfield's version stays surprisingly close to the original, without even the slightest hint of 90's irony. It may be a little more pop than the classic rock original, but this might be one of the most fun cover songs of 2024.\n\nJuliana Hatfield explains her decision to take on an album's worth of ELO classics:\n\n“ELO songs were always coming on the radio when I was growing up. They were a reliable source of pleasure and fascination. With this album of covers I wanted to get my hands deep into some of the massive ‘70’s hits but I am also shining a light on some of the later work… My task was to try and break all the things down and reconstruct them subtly until they felt like mine.”\n\nYou can listen to Juliana Hatfield's take on \"Don't Bring Me Down\" below. Juliana Hatfield Sings ELO is due out November 17 on American Laundromat Records, and is available for pre-order here. For more on Juliana Hatfield, check out the artist's website. Upcoming tour dates are below the song.\n\nJUN 17 / NORTHAMPTON, MA @ One Roof Concert for the Homeless\n\nJUL 28 & 29 / NEW YORK CITY @ City Winery (Nuggets 50th Anniversary)"
