        "text": "Slim Jim and the Redeemers – Ain’t There Yet\n\nSlim Jim and the Redeemers have a new album Ain’t There Yet, which was produced by Kevin Krell and Aaron Feder. It was recorded, mixed and mastered by Aaron Feder at Slow Sound Studio, Barcelona with additional recording by Julian Jahanpour and field recording of one song by Alan Mekel.\n\nThe title track steps out of the gate with a lazy slow bluesy intro and then it picks up into a Western country gait with pedal steel solos in the mix. It’s a tale of someone in the midst of figuring things out from a barstool: “Fix me another, bartender, and help me to forget / I’m getting closer but I ain’t got there yet.” “There’s a moral to this story but I don’t know what it is….”\n\n“Fugitive Blues” features the idea of being “always on the outside looking in… I’m so alone, on my own” is set for reflection and here we can see the depth and strength of Kevin Krell’s songwriting, which is provocative and mines some intensity. The electric guitar melody parts have both the tone and the dreamy quality from the Jerry Garcia playbook.\n\n“St. Stephen’s Blues” starts with a walking blues set up into an electric bluesy arrangement, and amidst the groove we discover that this gal is the type with some seriously bad habits: “she takes whiskey in her coffee, cocaine in her tea.” “I’m Trouble” continues the badassery: “I was trouble since the day I was born / been raising hell before I could crawl.”\n\nThis album introduces folks who are base-level fighting their way through, slinging on both sides and daring anyone to stop them, amidst serious grooves and with sweet harmonies peppered in. Slim Jim shows plenty of talent in both his lyrics and the music, crafting songs with a depth that calls for repeated listens.\n\nCheck them out on Bandcamp, and more information can be found here on the band website: https://www.slimjimandtheredeemers.com/\n\nMusicians on the album are Slim Jim on lead vocals and guitar, with The Redeemers: Mary Mahaffey on backing vocals and fiddle; Adeline on backing vocals; Frisco Pérez on lead guitar; Ian Savage on bass; and Marc Torné on drums. Special guests on the album are Aaron Feder on pedal steel (tracks 1,3), guitar (track 4); Carrie Lewis on vocals (track 5); Donna Lee on vocals (Track 2); J.J. Oliva on organ (tracks 2,5); and Julian Jahanpour on piano and organ (tracks 4,6,7)."
