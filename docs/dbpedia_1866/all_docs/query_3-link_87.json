        "text": "RECKLESS RECORDS 6/30/23 NEW RELEASES\n\n>> ALEX G – Live From Union Transfer LP (Domino) *Indie Exclusive Tangerine Vinyl – Ltd. 3500, Hand #’d\n\nSuper duper limited live record from ALEX G off of his great album God Save The Animals. This one ain’t on streaming (or even on CD). Hand-numbered and limited to 3,500 copies worldwide. GET IT WHILE YOU CAN.\n\n>> BLACK DUCK – Black Duck LP (Thrill Jockey) *Black or Ltd. Orange Vinyl ✶ ✶ ✶ ✶\n\nThis self-titled release marks the debut for this Chicago supergroup trio, consisting of Doug McCombs (TORTOISE, ELEVENTH DREAM DAY, BROKEBACK, PULLMAN), Bill MacKay (collabs with RYLEY WALKER and NATHAN BOWLES among others) and Charles Rumback (also another WALKER collaborator as well as with a number of jazz groups). BLACK DUCK touches on jazz, country, blues and post-rock, emphasizing the trio’s tactile playing and intuitive sense of atmosphere. Like Bob Welch-era FLEETWOOD MAC channeled through the sonics of BARK PSYCHOSIS. On Thrill Jockey and RECOMMENDED!\n\n>> SAM PREKOP & JOHN McENTIRE – Sons of 2LP (Thrill Jockey) *Black or Ltd. Seaglass Vinyl – Limited 2022 CD/CS release now available on LP! ✶ ✶ ✶ ✶\n\nFirst duo record between THE SEA & CAKE bandmates SAM PREKOP and JOHN McENTIRE presents four sprawling songs centered on modular synth experimentation. This is PREKOP’s most rhythmic solo release to date, but this is certainly not “dance music” per se – moreso a lush atmospheric collage. RECOMMENDED!\n\n>> ARTHUR RUSSELL – Picture of Bunny Rabbit LP/CD (Audika)\n\nIt’s hard to believe that there’s still more Arthur Russell material out there to discover but this 2023 collection features 9 previously unreleased tracks. These songs were recorded around the same time as the now classic World of Echo & there are definitely some similarities. Delay & echo experiments with cello, voice, guitar & more that will definitely please fans of Russell’s work. RECOMMENDED.\n\n>> HIROSHI YOSHIMURA – Green LP (Light In The Attic) *Reissue – Green Vinyl\n\nBack in early 2017, we received a reissue of a wonderful early 80’s album by the Japanese musician HIROSHI YOSHIMURA called Music for Nine Postcards & we were entranced. Since then Yoshimura’s music has become more widely known outside of Japan & now the highly anticipated reissue of this excellent 1986 album Green is here. Made on classic Yahama synths of the era, this is a beautiful album of soothing instrumentals that owe as much to 80s new age as they do to TANGERINE DREAM film scores & 20th century minimalism like STEVE REICH.

Pink Vinyl\n\nThis debut album from New York’s JONNY BENAVIDEZ makes good use of Timmion’s house backing band COLD DIAMOND & MINK, with hazy, nostalgic production on songs that recall classic doo-wop and early soul in the FLAMINGOS vein. RECOMMENDED!\n\n>> GEESE – 3D Country LP (Partisan) *Black or Ltd. Clear Vinyl\n\nThis sophomore record from Brooklyn’s GEESE takes a more laid-back approach from their debut, toning down their angular post-punk hooks with jammy, summertime songs that seem to chase the sound of mid/late-70s ROLLING STONES. On Partisan & RECOMMENDED!\n\n>> TIM HECKER – No Highs 2LP (Kranky)\n\nTim Hecker returns after a 4 year absence with No Highs for Kranky. Hecker is a master of deep frequencies & tones & on this one he uses acoustic instruments like Colin Stetson’s cyclical sax patterns, steel guitar, french horn & bass clarinet along with his laptop manipulations to create a rich realm. Ambient music is in a weird spot in 2023 & Hecker still comes out on top. RECOMMENDED!\n\n>> JOHANNA SAMUELS – Bystander LP (Jealous Butcher) *Orange Vinyl\n\nTactile indie-folk from LA’s JOHANNA SAMUELS, who here partners with producer Josh Kaufman (who’s worked with CASSANDRA JENKINS and THE HOLD STEADY, as well as being in BONNY LIGHT HORSEMAN) for a similar sound that is both textured and free-wheeling, with SAMUELS’ simple, evocative songwriting front and center. RECOMMENDED!\n\n>> WYE OAK – Every Day Like The Last: Collected Singles 2019-2023 LP/CD (Merge) *”Peak Vinyl Edition” Ltd. Swirl Vinyl\n\nThe latest collection from long-running indie band WYE OAK compiles digital singles from the past four years as well as a trio of new songs, all showcasing a more folk-driven approach to the gauzy, thorny rock the duo has perfected over the last 15 years. Good stuff!

Some third streamish spaciousness that reminds us of the FLOATING POINTS / PHAROAH SANDERS record from a few years ago, along with the rhythmic thrust of the self-titled RESAVOIR record. RECOMMENDED!\n\n>> FRED AGAIN… & BRIAN ENO – Secret Life LP/CD (Text) *Early 2023 album now available\n\n2023 collab (and hopefully the first of many) between red hot producer FRED AGAIN… and his mentor, the icon BRIAN ENO. Secret Life tends to lean more towards Eno’s classic ambient sound than the preferred rave/house sound of Fred again…’s solo LPs, with varied samples & ethereal vox that fans of BURIAL, JAMES BLAKE, and THE XX oughta vibe with heavy.

Purple Vinyl\n\nBELL WITCH returns with Future’s Shadow: Part 1 Clandestine Gate the first part of a proposed three album trilogy. The album starts off with a mellow organ passage that sounds like a funeral dirge.Guitars slowly fade in & the piece finally fully arrives at the 9 minute mark. If you thought Mirror Reaper was a slow burn wait until you throw this one on. All of the elements that we know & love about BELL WITCH are here, slow as molasses doom, epic patience & willingness to let the chords breathe & REVERENCE FOR THE DOOM. RECOMMENDED.\n\n>> DECISIVE PINK – Ticket to Fame LP (Fire) *Ltd. Pink Vinyl\n\nAn exciting collaborative project between KATE NV and ANGEL DERADOORIAN, channeling the former’s forays into experimental pop and the latter’s penchant for ambient atmospherics. Angular, disarming, playfully abstract, and RECOMMENDED.\n\n>> FEEBLE LITTLE HORSE – Girl With Fish LP/CD/CS (Saddle Creek) *Pink Vinyl or Indie Exclusive Grey Galaxy Vinyl\n\nFollowing hot off the heels of Saddle Creek’s Hayday vinyl reissue, FEEBLE LITTLE HORSE’s sophomore record keeps up the gauzy, off-kilter approach found in self recording. Girl with Fish is filled with confident, dynamic songwriting that draws from shoegaze and noise pop, all with a playful attitude that pops up in turns of phrase and home studio tricks. For fans of: ALEX G, LIZ PHAIR, HORSEGIRL. RECOMMENDED!\n\n>> JAYDA G – Guy LP (Ninja Tune) *Ltd. Eco-Mix Vinyl – Signed Edition available while supplies last\n\nThe latest record from London-based JAYDA G is a rich mixture of house, R&B and disco, with her own voice brought more to the forefront. A tribute to her father and his experiences as a black man in 20th century America, this should appeal to fans of YAYA BEY, PEGGY GOU and AVALON EMERSON. RECOMMENDED.\n\n>> KING KRULE – Space Heavy LP/CD (Matador) *Black or Indie Exclusive Clear Vinyl\n\nThis fourth album for Archy Marshall as KING KRULE seems to catch him drifting over his signature hazy, swamped-up sound, breaking up the guitar distortion and general reverb with more, well, space. Marshall utilizes space perfectly here, creating uncluttered, rich atmospheres with synth pads and minimal band arrangements, bringing both his bittersweet melodies and wry lyricism to the forefront. The most mature release of his to date. Excellent stuff! RECOMMENDED!\n\n>> JENNY LEWIS – Joy’All LP/CD/CS (Blue Note) *Black or Indie Exclusive Green Vinyl\n\nJENNY LEWIS returns with her first album since 2019’s great On The Line. Recorded with producer DAVE COBB and a crack team of Nashville session musicians (plus special guest JON BRION), Joy’All is full of quirky, soulful country pop. that’ll hit the same pleasure center in your brain as classic FLEETWOOD MAC, DIANA ROSS, and even – stick with us here – JIMMY BUFFETT. On Blue Note and, as always with anything Jenny touches, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!\n\n>> MAG-AMPLITUDE – Wizards of Tomorrow LP (Zaius Tapes)\n\nZaius Tapes has dug up a really interesting nugget, this time a 1983 LP that was released in a pressing of just 100. Led by the blind guitarist Matt Muncil, MAG-AMPLITUDE’s sound sits somewhere between post-STOOGES proto-punk, outsider early noise like THE GODZ, lo-fi basement jams like WICKED LADY & some guitar playing that remind us of THE WIPERS’ Greg Sage. RECOMMENDED.\n\n>> RUPA – Disco Jazz LP (Numero Group) *Reissue – Ltd. “Disco Rainbow” Color Vinyl\n\nIs this disco? Well, maybe. Is this jazz? Dear god no. Numero graces us with a much needed reissue of this rare pop fusion record, one that evades categorization. The closest genres would be funk or boogie. Either way this record makes you move. K I L L E R grooves with traditional Indian instrumentation, and sultry Bengali vocals. What more do I need to say? C’mon, it’s disco-jazz. It’s DISCO JAZZ. VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!\n\n>> SQUID – O Monolith LP/CD (Warp) *Black or Ltd. Blue Vinyl\n\nNo sophomore slump for Bristol’s SQUID, who build upon their motorik anglo-kraut-pop debut with more daring approaches to studio production that embrace electro- acoustic fusion in the BECK vein as well as robust prog passages that remind us of contemporaries BLACK COUNTRY, NEW ROAD. This outward expansion of sound is tied together on O Monolith with a stronger focus on melody, providing structure to the rhythmic exercises and production forays found all over. On Warp and VERY RECOMMENDED.\n\n>> TEARS FOR FEARS – The Hurting LP (Mercury) *2023 Reissue – Half-Speed Master\n\nTEARS FOR FEARS’ incredible debut album from 1983 has long been overshadowed by its follow-up Songs from the Big Chair. Back in 2002 a cover of “Mad World” from The Hurting was featured on the Donnie Darko soundtrack & it became a bit of a hit. Slowly people began to realize it was a cover & The Hurting started to come back to life. This album is incredibly mature for a debut, and though some of the songs might seem a bit dramatic & even ’emo’ today, their blend of electronics & traditional rock instrumentation still sounds incredibly fresh in 2023. This album is much darker than Songs From the Big Chair and it kind of sounds like a mix of early CURE, DEPECHE MODE, OMD & ULTRAVOX. Do yourself a favor & check out this album if you don’t know it already – it’s a true classic. 2023 half-speed remaster made at Abbey Road!

This time around the production is more polished and the genre more varied than strictly “grunge pop,” but the massive hooks, buzzsaw guitar, and Alicia’s raspy howl (one of the best voices in indie rock today) are still razor-sharp and raw as all hell. It hurts so good and it does Sub Pop proud. Highly RECOMMENDED!\n\n>> KAREN DALTON – In My Own Time LP (Light In The Attic) *50th Anniversary – Ltd. Silver Vinyl\n\nKAREN DALTON’s second album didn’t get the attention that it deserved when it was released in 1971 but over time it has come to be considered as a classic. You’d think her connections to others in the scene like BOB DYLAN, TIM HARDIN, and FRED NEIL would have cleared a path for Dalton’s success but a variety of obstacles including music biz politics & Dalton’s drug/alcohol abuse stalled any momentum she might have had. The album was reissued in 2010 and artists like NICK CAVE & JOANNA NEWSOM cite Dalton as an influence, and that & other excellent reissues helped her legend grow. In 2021 a documentary was released & now this beautiful deluxe 50th anniversary edition is here with remastered audio on silver vinyl with booklet & beautiful foil-stamped art. RECOMMENDED!\n\n>> BOB DYLAN – Shadow Kingdom 2LP/CD (Columbia)\n\nOriginally released as a limited paid streaming performance during lockdown in 2021, Shadow Kingdom is now available in album form. The songs have a really loose feel, with acoustic guitars, accordion & zero percussion. The line-up features T BONE BURNETT, BIG THIEF’s Buck Meek, Don Was & Greg Leisz & the set list mostly features 60s songs with sometimes drastic reinterpretations, especially on “Tombstone Blues.” Dylan has been playing relentlessly the last few years & you can hear the almost effortless familiarity the group has with the songs & it makes for a very rewarding listen. RECOMMENDED.\n\n>> FOO FIGHTERS – But Here We Are LP/CD/CS (RCA) *Black or Ltd. White Vinyl\n\nOne word that has long defined FOO FIGHTERS as a band is “resiliency.” Dave Grohl’s best songs are about sticking around, finding resolve, and learning to walk again when the will to fly just isn’t there. It’s an M.O. that’s left them perfectly equipped to face the tragic passing of their beloved drummer Taylor Hawkins head on. Sonically this record has a lot in common with 1999’s There is Nothing Left to Lose (their first LP with Taylor on drums) – surging power pop, shoegaze, extended instrumental passages, and lo-fi punk, with nods throughout to JAWBREAKER, SUGAR, HUM, and old FM radio faves of Taylor like QUEEN and RUSH. Essentially it’s a concept album about loss: Each song works through grief in ways that are raw, unflinching and devoid of cliche. It’s a special gift for us fans, the band’s legacy, and Taylor’s memory. RIP Hawk. RECOMMENDED.\n\n>> POLIBIO MAYORGA & VARIOUS – Ecuatoriana: El Universo Paralelo de… LP/CD (Analog Africa) *w/ book\n\nThe latest entry in Analog Africa’s exploration into Latin American esoterica lands in Ecuador and on the figure of POLIBIO MAYORGA. Gravitating towards Quito’s radio station as a musician and utilizing space-age synth technology that had grown in popularity over the years prior, MAYORGA channeled Andean melodies and realist stories into a fusion that can be described as “tropical psychedelia”. This album collects his work as a performer, musician and songwriter, showcasing a central part of Ecuadorian popular music. RECOMMENDED!\n\n>> PROTOMARTYR – Formal Growth in the Desert LP/CD (Domino) *Black or Indie Exclusive Blue Vinyl\n\nOver five records and a decade-plus, Detroit’s own PROTOMARTYR has been a model for consistency. Album six is no exception, expanding their sonic palette to include icy gothic synth textures and guitar sheet noise to abstract (but not obscure) the band’s classic rhythmic jitters and earworm lead-lines. All these are tied together by Joe Casey’s apocalyptic sermon vocals which continue to deliver without landing on cliche sloganeering. One of the best bands working today. On Domino and HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!\n\n>> WICCA PHASE SPRINGS ETERNAL – Wicca Phase Springs Eternal LP (Run For Cover) *Ltd. “Stormcloud Splatter” Vinyl w/ Comic\n\nAdam McIlwee’s WICCA PHASE SPRINGS ETERNAL project has gained notoriety over the past few years for over 20 albums, mixtapes, and Soundcloud drops in the past decade (plus wrestler Darby Allin’s kickass entrance theme in AEW). This S/T record blends dusty house and trap beats with icy post-punk instrumentation and a big dose of pop-punk melodicism. There’s also a great leftfield goth-country duet with Reckless fave ZOLA JESUS. Cool stuff. RECOMMENDED!\n\n>> VARIOUS – Yo! Boombox: Early Independent Hip-Hop 3LP/2CD (Soul Jazz) *Indie Exclusive LP w/ bonus 7″\n\nFollowing a book by the same name, Soul Jazz releases a comp focusing on the advent of hip-hop and electro, tracing its origins through disco’s denouement and DJ culture as it emerged in the Bronx in the late 70s. Featuring classic cuts from GRANDMASTER FLASH and THE FUNKY FOUR PLUS ONE as well as a smattering of obscure singles from across the country. Essential stuff for any historian of American popular music. RECOMMENDED!\n\nOTHER IMPORTANT NEW RELEASES, REISSUES & RESTOCKS\n\nAVENGED SEVENFOLD – Life Is But A Dream 2LP/CD (Warner) *Ltd.

Like hearing THE STONE ROSES in the murky shadows of SLOWDIVE. Superb stuff that comes RECOMMENDED.\n\nBLACK COUNTRY, NEW ROAD – Live at Bush Hall LP (Ninja Tune)\n\nRecording over three nights in London in December of 2022, “Live at Bush Hall” presents as a soundtrack to a YouTube concert documentary but really functions as another entry into the (un)official BC,NR catalog. In the wake of Isaac Wood’s voluntary departure, singing has been taken up by committee, giving the experiments an invitingly twee atmosphere. Yet though this band is constantly shifting, BC,NR still retains the intrepid spirit of their previous albums, at once playful and imposing. On Ninja Tune and RECOMMENDED.\n\nTHE CHASM – Scars of a Lost Reflective Shadow LP (Dark Descent)\n\n2023 album by THE CHASM, a death metal duo from Mexico that started way back in 1992! One thing we can promise you is that this record has ALL THE RIFFS. Seriously there are so many great ideas & riffs on here, they just never let up. Top-notch classic sounding death metal with really crisp production. Should make many best of 23 lists for sure. RECOMMENDED.\n\nCHRIS CONNELLY – Phenobarb Bambalam LP/CD (Wax Trax!) black, limited silver or 2LP deluxe vinyl\n\nChris Connelly’s sophomore album from 1992 has been remastered & reissued courtesy of Wax Trax! A powerful collection of songs that straddle death rock, Bowie’s darker side, post-industrial nastiness & angular KILLING JOKE style rockers. The 2LP edition features b-sides & live recordings from the era. YEAH!\n\nEXPLODING HEARTS – Guitar Romantic: Expanded & Remastered LP (Third Man) limited color of VERY limited “exploded heart” color vinyl which is limited to 1 per customer, no phone orders or holds.\n\nThe legendary 2003 album by Portland’s THE EXPLODING HEARTS has been expanded & remastered by Third Man for its 20 year anniversary. There are so many great songs on this with nods to 70s power pop, 80s punk ala BUZZCOCKS, UNDERTONES & THE CLASH while simultaneously sounding like nothing else in 2003. RECOMMENDED.\n\nTHE FUCKING CHAMPS – III (reissue) LP (Drag City)\n\nOriginally released in 1997 under the name C4AM95 aka CHAMPS. They changed their name to FUCKING CHAMPS in 2000 for their Drag City debut so it’s no surprise that this reissue is now available via Drag City now under the FUCKING CHAMPS name. This record blew a lot of people’s minds back then with its combination of DON CAB esque math rock mixed with power metal “guitarmamonies” & playful arrangements. We’re very happy to be able to carry this one again & we hope D.C. plans reissues of their other great albums. RECOMMENDED.\n\nHANNAH JADAGU – Aperture LP/CD/TAPE (Sub Pop) First pressing Loser Edition color vinyl\n\n“Aperture” is the debut album by the young songwriter Hannah Jadagu currently based in NYC. Jadagu’s songs have a sort of effortless quality to them with bedroom pop style songs with bright & crisp recordings. Think Hazel English, Chicago’s LALA LALA, early Captured Tracks bands etc…Great stuff.\n\nGIA MARGARET – Romantic Piano LP/TAPE (Jagjaguwar)\n\nAfter releasing her debut album Chicago’s Gia Margaret lost her voice due to illness. While she recovered she turned to making instrumental music & released the stunning ambient album “Mia Gargaret.” Now she’s back with her 2nd (mostly) instrumental album & her first for Jagjaguwar. This is a lovely mix of minimalist chamber style piano pieces overlayed with field recordings & wonderful synth parts. There’s also a brief but fantastic guitar piece. The one vocal song “City Song” reminds us of BON IVER or MICROPHONES & It’s quite cinematic & beautiful. We’re all in. RECOMMENDED.\n\nMIDWIFE & VYVA MELINKOLYA – Orbweaving LP/TAPE (The Flenser)\n\nReckless fave Madeline Johnston (MIDWIFE) & Angel Diaz (Vyva Melinkolya) have teamed up for this fantastic 2023 album. If you’re familiar with MIDWIFE then you’ll have a good idea what this sounds like, minimal slowcore/shoegaze with bits of half-speed drone & sludge. Think JESU, NADJA, JESUS & MARY CHAIN 45s on 33 etc…RECOMMENDED.\n\nWATER FROM YOUR EYES – Everyone’s Crushed LP/CD (Matador)\n\nIn spite of the HEAVEN 17 invocation on the cover, the electro-pop on “Everyone’s Crushed” is anything but docile. Jagged guitar and electronic drum lines crash and clang, fitting together like shards of glass being reconstructed, all tied together by Rachel Brown’s dry disassociated vocal delivery. Fans of DRY CLEANING and PALM will find lots to love here. On Matador and VERY RECOMMENDED!\n\nOTHER IMPORTANT RELEASES\n\nAJJ – Disposable Everything LP/CD (Hopeless) indie only color or black\n\nRAY BARRETTO – Que Viva La Musica LP (Craft)\n\nBEACH HOUSE – Become LP/CD/TAPE (Sub Pop) RSD EP available on black vinyl\n\nBIG STAR – #1 Record LP (Ardent) metallic gold/purple vinyl\n\nTHE BLACKWOOD APOLOGY – House of Leather LP (Sundazed) red vinyl, remastered\n\nCALIFONE – Villagers LP (Jealous Butcher) reissued\n\nCHARLIE XCX – True Romance LP (Asylum) reissued on silver vinyl\n\nCINDY – Why Not Now?

If you don’t see something on here we don’t have it. Some things can still be ordered so if you don’t see something on here you were hoping to get, let us know.

After a few albums with a lot of studio trickery & manipulation, this one is mostly pretty straight forward recording-wise. The result is probably the most accurate documentation of what a force they are as a live band. Driving & repetitive THIS HEAT-esque rhythms with sparse & brittle guitar from Brian. His voice is also way on top here which also gives this record a different feel. Another great onefrom these local heroes. RECOMMENDED.\n\nWEDNESDAY – Rat Saw God LP/CD/TAPE (Dead Oceans) limited color or black w/ limited bonus CD while supplies last\n\nThe Asheville band WEDNESDAY has moved over to DEAD OCEANS for their 2023 album. The recording on this one is pretty hi-fi & it makes their 90s alt rock/grunge inspired tunes sound even heavier. Fans of PIXIES, NIRVANA, WEEZER etc… will eat this up.\n\nYAEJI – With a Hammer LP/CD (XL) limited pink or black vinyl\n\nFollowing a run of singles and mixtapes, this debut LP from YAEJI throws in the entire kitchen sink, with flickering collages of vocal samples, impressionistic synths, frenetic beats and hooks that range from sugar sweet pop to jagged, dissonant experimentation. The result lands somewhere in an area between hip-house, 90s-esque IDM and hyperpop, but to limit this record to those conventions might be a disservice. Absolutely worth a listen for fans of leftfield experimental pop.\n\nOTHER IMPORTANT NEW RELEASES & RESTOCKS\n\nAFFLECKS PALACE – The Only Light in This Tunnel is the Oncoming Train LP (SOSI)\n\nVIJAYA ANAND – Dance Raja Dance: The South Indian Film Music of Vijaya Anand LP (Luaka Bop) first time on vinyl!\n\nBLONDSHELL – Blondshell LP/CD (Partisan) limited clear or black vinyl\n\nBRAID – Frame & Canvas LP (Polyvinyl) 25th anniversary silver vinyl\n\nCLUSTER – Cluster II LP (Superior Viaduct)\n\nCLUSTER – Zuckerzeit LP (Superior Viaduct)\n\nDE LA SOUL – De La Soul Is Dead LP/TAPE (Tommy Boy)\n\nFIRE-TOOLZ – I am Upset Because I See Something That is Not There CD/TAPE (Hausu Mountain) vinyl arriving later this year\n\nROBBIE FULKS – Bluegrass Vacation LP/CD (Compass)\n\nHMLTD – The Worm LP (Lucky Number) limited pink or black vinyl\n\nJOEY BADA$$ – 2000 LP (Columbia)\n\nSHOUKICHI KINA – Peppermint Tea House: The Best of Shoukichi Kina LP (Luaka Bop) first time on vinyl!\n\nMAGNOLIA ELECTRIC COMPANY – Sojourner 4LP box set (Secretly Canadian)\n\nMODEL CITIZENS – NYC 1978-1979 LP (Modern Harmonic) red vinyl\n\nMUDHONEY – Plastic Eternity LP/CD/TAPE (Sub Pop)\n\nMARY MUNDY – Mother Nature LP (Real Gone) remastered, pink vinyl\n\nRACHIKA NAYAR – Our Hands Against the Dusk LP (NNA Tapes) reissue, red vinyl\n\nNF – Hope LP/CD (Republic)\n\nANDERSON PAAK – Malibu LP (OBE) reissued on white/orange splatter vinyl\n\nNAI PALM – Needle Paw LP (Brainfeeder) reissue, limited pink vinyl\n\nORVILLE PECK – Pony LP (Sub Pop) back in stock\n\nRADIOHEAD – Kid A LP (XL) back in stock\n\nROSLYN & CHARLES – Everything Must Change LP (Real Gone) reissue\n\nNANCY SINATRA & LEE HAZLEWOOD – Nancy & Lee Again LP (Light in the Attic)\n\nTHE TOMS – The Toms LP (Feel It)"
