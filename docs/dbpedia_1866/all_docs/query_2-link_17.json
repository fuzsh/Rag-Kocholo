        "text": "T ake one Psychedelic Fur, add a Boston art-rock drummer, season with fresh ideas, a bit of career frustration and a lot of style. What you’ve got is Satellite Paradiso, which makes its local debut at Brighton Music Hall tomorrow.\n\nLed by longtime Furs guitarist John Ashton, the band includes drummer Frank Coleman, from Boston’s anarchic theatrical band the Bentmen, singer Fred Schreck and bassist Robert Burke Warren (late of garage-rock kings the Fleshtones). Opening tomorrow’s show is Casey Desmond, who’s beloved in local pop circles and is the daughter of Bentmen frontman William Desmond.\n\nSatellite Paradiso’s debut should excite Furs fans — especially fans of the early Furs, when their punk and glam roots were more prevalent. You could even say that it’s better than anything that the Furs have released in decades — except that they haven’t released anything at all in decades, and that’s precisely why Ashton left.\n\n“It was pretty obvious that I wasn’t happy in the band anymore,” Ashton said. “Richard (singer Richard Butler) and I weren’t communicating anymore, even though we lived less than an hour from each other.”\n\nThough UK-born, both now live in upstate New York.\n\n“I had all this material sitting there waiting to do something with it. It became evident that there was no possibility of doing anything new as the Furs. We’d just be going on tour, playing the same songs with no possibility. That frustrated me to no end. I became depressed and basically drank myself out of the band because of it.”\n\nAshton began working up a solo project, but was hungering for a real band. Enter Coleman, who’d met him on Facebook.\n\n“I believe very strongly in the power of asking for things,” Coleman said. “So I friended him and said to myself, ‘Self, I’m gonna send him a little note.’ ”\n\nAshton agreed to play guitar on a project of Coleman’s, based on spy-movie-style music, then asked if Coleman would be interested in drumming on his tracks.\n\nColeman’s response? “I said, ‘Look, I’m not a fanboy, but you’ve been the soundtrack of my life for the past 30 years. Anything you need in the drum department I’d be happy to do.’ ”\n\nAlong with the new material, tomorrow’s set will include a couple of Furs songs — Ashton says fan favorite “Alice’s House” is a possibility. And the guitarist is getting a kick from playing music on his own terms.\n\n“My intention wasn’t to find the next bandwagon to jump on or to follow up any hits. This is a fresh sheet of paper, but it’s always been my sound — a little bit aggressive, to say the least, but melodic as well. I like that juxtaposition. We’re just doing what comes naturally.”"
