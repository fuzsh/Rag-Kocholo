In recent years he and his wife Joyce lived in Panama City, Florida. DeFranco was the principal influence onvirtually every major clarinetist who played the instrument in modern jazz. Born in Camden, New Jersey, he attended music school in Philadelphia, was a professional at 16 and before he was 20 had worked with the big bands of Gene Krupa, Ted Fio Rito and Charlie Barnet, then with Tommy Dorsey and Boyd Raeburn. His quartet with pianist Sonny Clark, bassist Eugene Wright and drummer Bobby White was an acclaimed group in the mid-1950s. He worked steadily until illness slowed him in his eighties. For more about DeFranco, see the obituary by Don Heckman in The Los Angeles Times.\n\nDrummer Ronnie Bedford died Saturday December 20 in Powell, Wyoming, where he had lived since 1986. He and his wife were attracted to the relaxed pace of life in the west after years in New York City. Before and after the move, he worked and recorded with a range of jazz artists including Benny Carter, Red Norvo, Teddy Wilson, Toshiko Akiyoshi , Benny Goodman, Rod Levitt, Buddy DeFranco and Harry Edison. Bedford was 83. For an obituary, go here.\n\nDeFranco and Bedford, colleagues in their New York days, had a reunion at a 1990 Wyoming jazz festival that Bedford organized. Reed Gratz is the pianist, Peter Huffaker the bassist.\n\nAl Belletto was so attached to New Orleans that he returned to his hometown in midcareer and spent almost all of the rest of his life there. The saxophonist and bandleader died Friday night at home in the Crescent City suburb of Metairie after a long struggle with Huntingtonâ€™s disease. He would have been 87 on January 3. No public obituary has yet appeared, but his family prepared one and has permitted us to share it with Rifftides readers. We have added photographs, and a bit of music by the Belletto big band.\n\nAl was born in his beloved New Orleans on January 3, 1928. He died at home on December 26, 2014, following a prolonged encounter with Huntingtonâ€™s disease. His long career in jazz made him one of the cityâ€™s best known and most treasured musicians.\n\nThe young clarinetist switched to alto saxophone at Warren Easton high school and began working as a professional musician while a teenager. His early experience came with a variety traditional New Orleans bands including those of Sharkey Bonano, Wingy Manone, Leon Prima and the Dukes of Dixieland. Following his graduation from Loyola University as a music major, Al earned a masterâ€™s degree in music at Louisiana State University and was an expert clarinetist and player of alto and baritone saxes.\n\nAlthough he loved the traditional jazz that he played in the late 1940s and early 1950s, the bebop> pioneered by Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie captured Alâ€™s attention. Many older New Orleans players and fans were cold to modern jazz, but Al got encouragement from a few, among them Monk Hazel, the drummer of the legendary New Orleans Rhythm Kings. He often recalled with a big smile, that Hazel told him, â€œJust play your horn, baby.â€ In 1952 he founded the Al Belletto Sextet. Encouragedâ€”sponsored, reallyâ€”by big band leader Stan Kenton, he recorded for the Capitol, Bethlehem and King labels.\n\nThe records showcased his sextetâ€™s ability to sing as well as they played and brought Al national attention. No small part of the recognition came because the Belletto sextetâ€™s recording of â€œRelaxinâ€™â€ was the theme of Dick Martinâ€™s â€œMoonglow With Martinâ€ program on WWL Radio. The stationâ€™s powerful signal sent the program across half the United States. Martin kept his listeners informed about where the band was playing. Hereâ€™s a 1997 remake of â€œRelaxinâ€™â€ by the Belletto big band from the Jazznocracy CD. Al has the alto sax solo.\n\nIn several cities, fans filled clubs when the sextet appeared. The group became a part of Woody Hermanâ€™s big band for State Department tours of South America in 1958 and 1959. Despite those successes, Al couldnâ€™t get New Orleans out of his system.\n\nHe came home in the sixties determined to spend as much time as possible in his native city. Orleaniansâ€™ tastes had changed to encompass modern sounds, and through the years as he worked with his quartet, sextet and big band, Al became a major figure in the cityâ€™s cultural community. As music director of the Playboy Clubs, he still traveled, but the New Orleans club became his base and he brought major jazz artists and entertainers to appear there.\n\nIn the late sixties, Al was a member of the board of directors of the original New Orleans jazz festival known as JazzFest. He successfully pressed for a policy guaranteeing not only that many of the cityâ€™s prominent black musicians would be presented at the festival but also that they would be paid on a scale commensurate with that of white musicians. In the midst of the civil rights era, it was one of his proudest achievements.\n\nFlooded out in 2005 by Hurricane Katrina, Al and Linda moved for a time to Dallas to be near Alâ€™s son Bradley and his family. They returned to their new home in Metairie a few years ago.\n\nAmong the members of Alâ€™s bands over the years were such prominent musicians as Johnny Vidacovich, Ellis Marsalis, Carl Fontana, Willie Thomas, Michael Pellera, Don Menza, Richard Payne, John Mahoney and Rick Trolsen. Players who worked for Al had a title for him that reflected their admiration for his musicianship, his leadership and the warmth of their feelings for him. They called him Coach. Along with Linda, Bradley and Alâ€™s countless friends around the world, former sidemen are among the survivors remembering him with love. Plans for a memorial service are to be announced.\n\nWe thank Linda Belletto for allowing us to publish her husband’s obituary, and we send deep condolences.\n\nYouTube’s Al Belletto pages have dozens of tracks from his albums.\n\nNat Cole (1919-1965) was one of the most admired young jazz pianists of the late 1930s and early â€˜40s. In nightclubs, he occasionally included vocals in numbers with his trio, and patrons began requesting more of them. The King Cole Trioâ€™s 1943 recording of his composition â€œStraight Up and Fly Rightâ€ became a significant hit because of his vocal. It wasnâ€™t long before Coleâ€™s singing dominated his career. His 1946 records of â€œThe Christmas Songâ€ and â€œ(Get Your Kicks on) Route 66â€ made him one of the biggest popular music stars of his era. Nearly 50 years after his death, his albums are lively sellers.\n\nCole was a powerful stylistic influence on major pianists including Bud Powell, Bill Evans and Tommy Flanagan, but he was so famous as a singer that listeners today are often surprised to learn that he played the piano. A new Cole album presents many of his biggest hits using a revolutionary 21st century sound process. The collectionâ€™s quality captures the admiration of Rifftides contributor Jeff Sultanof.\n\nMr. Sultanof is admired by professional musicians for his analysis and editing of scores and for his writing and teaching about composers and composing, fields in which he is also a respected practitioner. He has written previously for Rifftides about Benny Carter, Pete Rugolo, Gerry Mulligan, Russell Garcia and Robert Farnon. He lives and teaches in New York City.\n\nKing Cole Gets The Royal Treatment\n\nBy Jeff Sultanof\n\nIt seems that even the most minor event gets publicized today. Yet, something has happened that too few people seem to know about. It started with a CD called The Extraordinary Nat King Cole, a compilation of well-known and newly released Cole recordings, issued in June of 2014. A 2-CD deluxe version came out at the same time. The collection was prepared in cooperation with the Cole estate. In some cases, the estate owns the tracks; Capitol had to get a special license to use them. The same album was released in November of 2014, in the High Fidelity-Pure Audio format playable on Blu-ray players. It is not as easy to find on Amazonâ€™s website, but if you poke around, it is there. CD Universe also carries it.\n\nBlu-ray is an audio/video format that delivers high definition picture and sound. What may seem hype is actually correct in this caseâ€” Blu-ray is amazing! With an HD television set, the picture and sound quality of this medium must be experienced to be believed. High Definition in the home has actually encouraged expensive restoration and availability of movies both classic and minor. It is possible to see films like Lawrence of Arabia from 70MM sources, even to see vintage Cinerama and 3D films in amazing quality. But how does this new technology interact with older recordings?\n\nFor those too young to remember, Sony unveiled the first CD player in 1982. It cost about $1000. It was originally marketed to listeners of classical music and jazz. By 1984, excellent players could be bought for about $225.00. They were still high in price, but much better than that first Sony player. The sound was a revelation, and the discs had no ticks and pops. The medium caught on quickly in the pop, rock and country genres. The LP seemed doomed.\n\nAnd yet there were naysayers: they claimed that the sound was too clinical, not â€˜warmâ€™ like vinyl LPs. Part of the problem was the sampling rate of CDs. Without getting too technical about it, the bit rate, or amount of information, was just good enough so that the players and discs could be marketed, and both Sony and Philips could recoup their research and development costs. In our modern world of downloading, most people canâ€™t tell the difference between MP3 downloads and CD tracks, and many donâ€™t care. CD sales are way down. Ironically, vinyl has made something of a comeback, but thatâ€™s another story.\n\nWith its higher bit rate, Blu-ray has the capacity to deliver high quality audio. True, you really donâ€™t hear the difference unless you have a good quality home system, but since home theatre sales are continuing to climb, itâ€™s safe to say that quite a few people do care about quality, and you can get a Blu-ray player for about $50.00. They are also available on the PlayStation 3, providing further availability of the medium. In the concert music field, Naxos has issued several Blu-ray Audio discs, but in 2013, Universal released about 30 titles which ran the gamut from concert music, pop, rock and Jazz. Among the titles were A Love Supreme, Big Band Bossa Nova (Quincy Jones), and the complete Ella and Louis.\n\nThe Extraordinary Nat King Cole has upped the stakes. Featuring 36 tracks from the period 1951 through 1964, it is both a greatest hits album and a treasure trove of other tracks, including duet recordings with Dean Martin, two pieces with Cole and his daughters, a group of unissued tracks and alternate performances of hits he re-recorded in 1961 for The Nat King Cole Story.\n\nCole holds a unique place in American music. He is considered one of the great jazz pianists in the music’s history, cited as an influence by instrumentalists worldwide. He is also one of the great singers of the twentieth century. Primarily known for his ballads, he could sing other styles with great success. This album shows off many aspects of his craft: “Straighten Up and Fly Right” was an early hit for Cole’s trio, “Send For Me” qualifies as R&B, “Orange Colored Sky” is a collaboration with the Stan Kenton Orchestra in an arrangement by Pete Rugolo (pictured with Cole). In this album the accompanists include the swinging Billy May studio orchestra and the string-laden orchestra of Nelson Riddle. Ralph Carmichael conducts the 1961 re-do’s. However, the credits for these tracks are incorrect; Carmichael is listed as arranger on many of them, but the scores are the original ones by Nelson Riddle).\n\nIf you close your eyes, you can swear that you are in the studio. Such is the warmth and clarity of the recordings, whose sources were the original tapes. Too often, reissues have to make do with copies several generations away from the originals. Indeed, the original LPs were two or three generations removed from the tape running through the machines at the time of recording. One reason was that it was necessary to prepare recordings so that they could be played back on even the cheapest record players. The bass was usually diminished or, in engineer parlance, “rolled off.” Because Blu-ray allows us to hear what is on the tapes without any alteration, we can more clearly detect subtleties in the sound, as well as differences between the recording studios Capitol used.\n\nIn 1951, Capitolâ€™s main west coast studio was in the former KHJ radio station on Melrose Avenue in Hollywood. The capability was single-channel monaural, and while the studio often had glorious sound, some of the recordings from that era sound slightly compressed. A great example is Coleâ€™s â€œAlmost Like Being in Love.â€ Previous issues of the song had frequencies so pinched that it sounded as if the master tape had been damaged. On Blu-ray, the track still sounds somewhat compressed, but since the bass is reproduced exactly as recorded, with no rolloff, the result is fullerâ€”more satisfying.\n\nBy 1956, Capitol had built its famous Tower. The ground floor had three studios for recording, with an echo chamber below the floor. When I produced two sessions there some years ago, I saw and heard first hand how great that complex is and what it is possible to do there. Studios A and B can be combined into one large room, with engineers able to use either set of recording equipment. Studio C is a smaller room that can be used for smaller ensembles, overdubbing and surround mix-downs. In 1956, the engineers were figuring out how best to record in the rooms. The recordings in those early years ran the gamut from beautifully balanced to distorted, sometimes with microphones placed so high that the sound is indistinct and nebulous (Capitol recorded a Nelson Riddle album in stereo that was never released due to poor microphone placement). Cole was fortunate; his stereo tracks from 1957-58 are beautifully recorded. Theyâ€™ve never sounded so clear and natural as in this Blu-ray album.\n\nCapitol also had an excellent studio on 46th Street in New York City. Many of the 1961 re-makes were done there. It had a totally different studio sound from the L.A. studios. Veteran studio musicians told me several times that they loved recording there. 46th Street had a beautiful 3-track tape machine. Coleâ€™s vocals are on one of those tracks, with a touch more echo (as far as I know, 46th Street did not have an echo chamber, so this is pure ambience). You can hear the difference from previous issues of this material. The unissued tracks are a mixed bag. Back then, recordings may have been withheld from release for a variety of reasons. Take your pick:\n\nThe artist may have turned in a less-than-good performance (not the case with Cole; he agreed to record some poor songs, and he gives 100% on each one).\n\nThe arrangement was rejected (not the case here; most of the unissued tracks were arranged by Nelson Riddle).\n\nThe executives didnâ€™t like the song (the producer and the top execs at a label frequently disagreed).\n\nThe writers of the song didnâ€™t like the performance and refused to grant a license.\n\nAre these tracks essential? I say yes for the arrangements alone. If you ask me, any new Nelson Riddle music is most welcome. What Riddle (pictured here with Cole in the studio) does with some of these songs is a lesson in professional arranging; he often turns straw into solid gold. In a word, they are gorgeous! Of the two tracks with daughters Natalie and Carole, one was originally issued and one was held back. These recordings are charming. Itâ€™s easy to hear that Natalie already had a sure ear and had listened to her dad. Her phrasing and intonation tend to be spot-on. Carole is clearly scared. She can sometimes barely be heard.\n\nThe alternates of previously issued tracks include some studio chatter. When working on a recording project, choosing which â€˜takeâ€™ to issue is an art and a challenge. In some cases, alternate vocal or instrumental performances are better than the tracks that came out, but they often have musical mistakes or poor balance. The Cole estate clearly wants his fans to have more of Natâ€™s life work, and we are in their debt. We are also indebted to Universal for making this Blu-ray available. I really appreciate the care that went into this release. Iâ€™ve already played the album several times. I am still knocked out by the sound. So letâ€™s think of other albums that should be available in this format. The Concert Sinatra is first on my list.\n\nWhat would be first on yours?\n\nThanks to Jeff Sultanof for his illuminating Blu-ray and Nat Cole insights. It’s always pleasure to have him aboard.\n\nFor a Rifftides post on the question of vinyl vs. digital and for reviews of a few recent LPs, go here.\n\n[contextly_auto_sidebar id=”YSgOUejoUSrxyclfDlxHra23Kqs4TDny”]\n\nFrank Zappa (1940-1993), a gifted musician who dipped his toe into jazz, never demonstrated more than a smidgeon of what he knew about the genre. But he left us with the memorable observation, â€œJazz isnâ€™t dead. It just smells funny.â€ A web search shows that lesser wits have adapted Zappaâ€™s line to all kinds of topics from politics to marketing management and, of all things, science journalism. None of those endeavors seems to be dying, either. For years, people have been predicting the end of jazz. Perhaps to them the sustained explosion of recordings seems an enormous death rattle.\n\nAll right, jazz is not dying. So, once again we leap into the breach in a heroic doomed attempt to keep up with the never-ending stream of new albums and reissues. We will bypass those that smell funny.\n\nKerri Politzer, Below The Surface (PJCE)\n\nKerry Politzer is a pianist married to a pianist, George Colligan. In 2011, they moved from New York City to Portland, Oregon, where both have day gigs on the music faculty at Portland State University. In New York, Ms. Politzer recorded a few albums, but her professional life as a pianist there was mainly below the surface. In Portland, it is not. She is emerging. Her resourcefulness and vigor at the keyboard and her depth as a composer reach fullness in this recording. The 10 compositions are hers.\n\nMs. Politzerâ€™s quintet includes some of the brightest musicians in Portlandâ€™s bustling jazz community. One of them is her husband, but this is not a two-piano album. Colligan has high visibility as a pianist and occasional trumpeter with his own groups as well as with Buster Williams, Lee Konitz and other major figures. Here, though, he is the drummer, playing his original instrument as if he hasnâ€™t missed a day of practice. His solos joyously behind a repeated rhythm section figure on the Latinate â€œEmpty House.â€\n\nTrumpeter Thomas Barber, is known for his own band Spiral Road and work with Dick Titterington and Darrell Grant. Barber capitalizes on the intervals in the astringent harmonies of Ms. Politzerâ€™s title tune to fashion a solo whose opening downward chromatic figures have a yearning quality evident in much of his work here. Alto saxophonist David Valdez melds with Barber in the front line and solos throughout with a cool tone and a warm flow of ideas. Bassist Andrea Niemiec, a native Oregonian who has been on the Portland scene for more than a decade, has a big sound that could have benefited from being higher in the audio mix. She is important to the trio track â€œEcho Says,â€ in which Ms. Politzer manages the neat trick of being contemplative while generating hard Â¾ swing. The final piece, â€œIn Spring,â€ is unaccompanied piano, lasts slightly less than two minutes and left this listener wanting more.\n\nMiguel ZenÃ³n, Identities are Changeable (Miel Music)\n\nThis audacious venture by the lavishly talented alto saxophonist is two projects in one. It is a dramatization using the recorded voices of several people talking about their Puerto Rican origins, their lives in New York and their senses of national identity. It is also ZenÃ³nâ€™s debut as a composer and arranger for a large ensemble made up of his quartet and 12 horns. ZenÃ³n, pianist Luis Perdomo, bassist Hans Glawischnig and drummer Henry Cole solidify their reputation as one of the most important small groups of this century.\n\nThe music follows seven previous ZenÃ³n albums based in his close identification with the culture and traditions of his native island. His alto solos are brilliant. Expanding on concepts he developed in earlier albums, ZenÃ³nâ€™s writing incorporates the complex rhythms of which he is a master and does it with skill that melds jazz, Latin and Caribbean folk strains into music so individual that it defies classification. Repeated hearings disclose new harmonic depths, rhythmic wizardry and surprises like the unison bebop saxophone section passages in the track called â€œThrough Culture and Traditionâ€ and the forthright counterpoint in â€œMy Home.â€\n\nHowever, repeated hearings can require listener commitment and a fair amount of patience. The voices often do not augment the music but collide with it. In some instances they are simply distracting, in some poorly recorded. Behind the voices, sounds of the city no doubt intended to add local color can sometimes override concentration on the music. Those flaws do not negate ZenÃ³nâ€™s accomplishment, but they detract from it.\n\nAnd Brieferâ€¦\n\nDelfeayo Marsalis, The Last Southern Gentlemen (Troubadour Jass)\n\nThe Marsalis brother who plays trombone teams up with his pianist father Ellis, bassist John Clayton and drummer Marvin â€œSmittyâ€ Smith for 11 standards and two originals. The music reflects Delfeayoâ€™s (and Ellisâ€™s) penchant for class in repertoire and performance. Their ballads, particularly â€œNancy,â€ are exquisite. In a brisk version of â€œSpeak Low,â€ the CDâ€™s longest track, fatherâ€™s and sonâ€™s solos and their exchanges with Smith demonstrate that that a fast tempo need not limit elegance. It is an indicator of the equanimity suffusing the production that in his literate liner note essay Delfeayo quotes Miss Manners (Judith Martin) about the influence of African slaves on development of the storied Southern graciousness of the pre-Civil War era. Delfeayoâ€™s use of a wa-wa mute and a New Orleans street-beat treatment of the Sesame Street theme make it one of the albumâ€™s many delights.\n\nGeorge Van Eps, Once In A While (Jump/Delmark)\n\nVan Eps (1913-1998) is a hero to guitarists for his development of a seven-string instrument that, combined with his chording technique, made it possible for him and succeeding generations of guitarists to accompany their own solos. He does that in this reissue of recordings he made in 1946 and 1949 for the Jump label. He also interacts with pianist Stan Wrightsman and saxophonist Eddie Miller, whom Cannonball Adderley once called, â€œthe first of the cool tenors.â€ Supremely relaxed and irresistibly rhythmic, Van Eps shines on 25 tracks. None is much longer than three minutes. None needs to be.\n\nMore reviews of recent releases to come on Rifftides\n\n[contextly_auto_sidebar id=”ROYWqvJQiOpHdWzJ4ffCpdzOkv72hIvn”]\n\nOnce during a listening session, I apologized to Paul Desmond for the pops and scratches on a worn LP. â€œI donâ€™t care if itâ€™s on a cellophane strip,â€ he said, â€œ as long as I can hear what everybody is doing.â€ When it comes to sound quality, high-end audio perfectionists tend to be more demanding than Desmond was that evening, and there are getting to be more of them. In an artistâ€™s note on the inside jacket of his new album, Just One Of Those Things, pianist Alan Broadbent writes,\n\nâ€œWith so many people dissatisfied with compressed digital sound, here is the sound of the future. Vinyl!â€\n\nHowever tongue-in-cheek his prediction, he is far from the first to make it. Since compact discs and CD players first appeared, audiophiles have insisted that digital sound is inferior to the warmth and depth of music delivered on quality equipment via properly made long playing vinyl discs. CDs wouldnâ€™t be around long, some of them said. That was in 1982.\n\nAccording to The Wall Street Journalâ€™s December 11 issue, â€œNearly eight million old-fashioned vinyl records have been sold this year, up 49% from the same period last yearâ€¦â€ The increase may be impressive, but the big percentage jump is in a tiny segment of the industry; LPs represent about two percent of total record sales. It is unlikely that significant numbers of people who do their listening on iPods, cell phones and Spotify will abandon their ear buds and start carting around amplifiers, speakers and 33 &1/3 rpm turntables. Still, enthusiasts are listening to all kinds of music on vinyl, from heavy metal to ukulele bands, symphonies, string quartetsand solo pianists. Along with the usual flood of CDs, a few new LPs are showing up in reviewersâ€™ mailboxes these days.\n\nAlan Broadbent, Just One Of Those Things (Edition Longplay)\n\nBroadbent recorded this LP in the summer of 2013 before an audience in Portland, Oregon. The piano is not identified in the albumâ€™s credits, but Rick Zackery of Classic Pianos, where the concert took place, reports that it was a Steinway Model D concert grand. That is the instrument preferred by classical pianists from Sergei Rachmaninoff to Lang Lang, and by countless jazz artists. Its brilliance and fullness from top to bottom are impressively captured in the LP, as is Broadbentâ€™s command of the keyboard.\n\nAmong the impressive moments: his lightning right hand forays in the title tune; the beautifully recorded walking bass notes and upper octave trills in â€œDjango;â€ in â€œSerenata,â€ Tatum downward runs and a sly allusion to â€œLove Is Here To Stay;â€ references to Lennie Tristano in â€œAll The Things You Are;â€ Broadbentâ€™s rhapsodic treatment of the Elvis Costello art song â€œThe Birds Will Still Be Singing;â€ and the delicate glissandos with which he ends Brubeckâ€™s â€œStrange Meadowlark.â€ Those are parts of the whole. The big picture is of a complete pianist correctly described by liner notes essayist Tobias Richsteig as a storyteller. The limited edition LP follows a solo CD that Broadbent recorded at Classic Pianos a year earlier. The CD was a Rifftides Monday recommendation. Consider this LP another.\n\nTucked inside a pocket of the gatefold jacket is a voucher good for an MP3 download of the album from the Edition Longplay website. Apparently in the digital age, even dedicated audiophiles must be willing to make digital compromises. As with the companyâ€™s other LPs, the jacket artwork is by a distinguished German graphic artist, in this case Martina Geist. Other vinyl discs in their catalog feature as leaders pianists Hank Jones and Don Friedman and bassist Martin Wind.\n\nFrank Lowe Quartet, Out Loud (Triple Point Records)\n\nThis previously unissued double LP comes roaring out of the righteousness and raucousness of the 1970s New York loft scene. Talented, largely self-taught and full of fierce energy, saxophonist Lowe developed in the free jazz movement that followed Ornette Coleman and John Coltrane. His major transition from the R&B orientation of his Stax Records days in his hometown, Memphis, came after he was encouraged by Coleman to move from San Francisco to New York. There, Lowe spent time in the Sun Ra Orchestra and absorbed energy and inspiration from the intrepid saxophonists Marshall Allen and John Gilmore. He also recorded with Alice Coltrane. Sometime in 1974 he formed a quartet with trombonist Joseph Bowie, drummer Steve Reid and bassist William Parker.\n\nOut Loud preserves an hour and a half of the groupâ€™s uncompromising intensity and headlong risk-taking sparked by Loweâ€™s audacity as a tenor saxophonist. Bowie and Reid match their leaderâ€™s eagerness to go on expeditions into uncharted territory. To no small extent, bassist Parkerâ€™s maintenance of reliable time and a semblance of harmonic order stabilize an enterprise that often has the potential of flying apart. On one track, trumpeter Ahmed Abdullah joins the band for a few chorusesif that term can be applied to unstructured blowingthat have intimations of bebop.\n\nLoweâ€™s integration of throat sounds into his saxophone tone enforces the thought that his playing is an extension of speech. He enhances the effect with phrasing that has the force of shouted oratory. Loweâ€™s quartet leaves the impression of profoundly human expression by a man forging his artistry when American jazz musicians, like their nation, were negotiating the political and social turmoil of the 1970s. Out Loud is handsomely produced on heavy vinyl discs in a double gatefold cover. Its 36-page booklet has extensive notes and analysis by Ed Hazell, J.D. Parran and Ben Young, and previously unpublished photos by Valerie Wilmer and Omar Kharem. Like the Broadbent LP, the Lowe comes with an extraa link and password to internet video and sound of the quartet from tape shot at one of the sessions at Sam Riversâ€™ celebrated Studio Rivbea.\n\nAfter his quartet dissolved, Lowe worked with Don Cherry, John Zorn and other figures in the avant-garde. He died of lung cancer in 2003 at the age of 60.\n\n55: Wayne Horvitz, Music In Dance And Concrete (Songlines)\n\nHorvitzâ€™s conception of composing is rooted in jazz, classical, folk, country, rock, gospel andone supposesall other music he has ever heard. The critic Paul de Barros once wrote of him as a “defiant cross-breeder of genres.” Horvitz melds, blends and contrasts styles by imposing sonic order that invites the open-minded listener inside. In the case of this LPâ€™s 39 minutes (additional music is available only as a digital download), â€œinsideâ€ means the passages, bunkers and an enormous empty cistern in a state park on Fort Worden, a decommissioned military base in Port Townsend, Washington. Thatâ€™s where he recorded 55 with his ten-piece Royal Room Collective Music Ensemble, named for the Seattle music club he co-owns.\n\nSince he left New York 25 years ago, Horvitz has continued the work that made him an admired figure for his ability to bring coherency and lyricism to a 1980s avant-garde that often resorted to shock for its own sake, not necessarily for the musicâ€™s. He writes scores that are on his musiciansâ€™ stands, but his conducting and composition are often simultaneous. In the manner of his friend the late Butch Morris, he often uses hand signals, nods and body language to tell the players to depart from what is on the written page. In other words, he improvises as he conducts, and the band interprets. Many of the changes in direction, dynamics and mood in this recording must result from that collective spontaneity and flexibility. The musicâ€™s drama is enhanced by the resonance of the concrete space and at times, it seems, by subtle electronic manipulation. The cave effect is evident in most of the tracks, notably so in the contrasts between strings and horns in the final cut, titled â€œ55(20).â€ All of the pieces are named â€œ55.â€ Another number in parentheses follows each title. The subsidiary numbers are not sequential. â€œ55(21),â€ for instance, follows â€œ55(5).â€ Horvitzâ€™s otherwise illuminating liner note essay does not explain whether the discontinuity has meaning related to the music.\n\nIn addition to the essay, the LP booklet has photographs of some of the musicians and dancers in action in Fort Wordenâ€™s underground concrete spaces and on what appears to be the top of the cistern. The dance aspect of the production, choreographed by Yukio Suzuki, took place as the music was played for audiences. Because the confined spaces held few people, Horvitz and Suzuki gave four performances.\n\nThe ensemble playing Horvitzâ€™s challenging music is Steve Oâ€™Brien: trumpet; Naomi Siegel: trombone; Kate Olson: soprano saxophone; Beth Fleenor: clarinet and bass clarinet; Briggan Krauss: alto saxophone; Maria Mannisto: voice; Eyvind Kang: viola; Heather Bentley: viola; Roweena Hammil: cello; Victoria Parker: violin.\n\nChemical Clock, Bad Habitat (Tables & Chairs)\n\nHorvitzâ€™s quarter of a century of eclectic brilliance in Seattle may have influenced some of the cityâ€™s younger fusion adventurers. Carefully scored, demanding the playersâ€™ close attention to intricate notation, Chemical Clock banks, loops, swirls, shouts, growls and turns on a dime. Its music coalesces in a thicket of styles derived from jazz, among them hip-hop, progressive rock, disco and swing era riffs. It is an operation more tightly wound than Horvitzâ€™s. I donâ€™t detect his kind of group reorchestration done on the fly. What I detect is meticulous musicianship and ferocious energy that often breaks out into rhythmic hilarity, as in â€œSpider.â€ The pieceâ€™s nursery rhyme simplicity merges into a march whose pomposity fades away on the soft wings of a trumpet melody.\n\nThe band is only four people; keyboardist Cameron Sharif, trumpeter Ray Larsen, bassist Mark Hunter and drummer Evan Woodle. Nowhere in the publicity information sheet (the LP sleeve has no notes) does the word synthesizer appear, but I donâ€™t know what else can account for passages that have the volume and harmonic complexity of an orchestra. â€œApothecaryâ€ is a good example. â€œAortaâ€ proceeds from organized chaos to resolution and a quiet ending perhaps symbolizing recovery from a heart attack. Larsenâ€™s range, flexibility, tone and control of his trumpet have showcases in the kaleidoscopic â€œSquidâ€ and the album closer, â€œRoy.â€ His performance throughout made me wonder if heâ€™d consider an album of ballads. Something so conventional may be far from his thoughts.\n\nBad Habitat showed up here as a 12-inch LP, but it was released simultaneously as a CD. Either way, Tables & Chairs (another Seattle label) makes an MP3 or FLAC download part of the deal, in case you feel that you need to have the album with you wherever you go.\n\nHiromi Kanda, Days Of Yesterday (Music Gate)\n\nFor four or five years, Hiromi Kanda has been looking out from the cover portrait of an LP leaning against a music room wall. â€œOne of these days,â€ I kept telling myself. â€œI must listen to that.â€ â€œWell,â€ I kept replying, â€œI will, the next time I do an LP roundup.â€ You know how easy it is to get behind.\n\nA singer well known in her native Japan, Ms. Kanda has lived for several years in Hawaii with her husband, the composer and producer Yusuke Hoguchi. In 2010, they went to Los Angeles, hired an orchestra with a full complement of strings and some of the best studio and jazz players in town, and made this record. Ms. Kandaâ€™s singing is idiosyncratic, with a slight accent. She occasionally succumbs to a tendency to kittenishness in delivery of lyrics but compensates with good timing, phrasing and intonation, and a genuine understanding of the classic American songs that make up most of the album. Three originals that she wrote with Hoguchi may not be quite in the league with those by Victor Young, Cole Porter, the Gershwins, Eubie Blake and Charlie Chaplin, but their â€œDreamerâ€ comes close, swings hard and incorporates effective backup trio vocals.\n\nThe album works, in great part, because of the arrangements by Matt Catingub, who also has a few fine alto saxophone choruses. Other impressive soloists are pianists Joe Sample and Quinn Johnson, trumpeter Bob Summers, tenor saxophonist Pete Christlieb and trombonist Andy Martin. Itâ€™s an enjoyable collection. I shouldnâ€™t have waited so long.\n\n[contextly_auto_sidebar id=”xanFlgjw7HSoTPVozCDubGHxw1mWLgn4″]\n\nThe new video recording of an acclaimed theatre piece recounts the surreal workings of pianist Fred Herschâ€™s mind during a long medically induced coma. Documentaries about trumpeter Clifford Brown and the composer, arranger and vibraharpist Gary McFarland recall major artists who died as their brilliant careers were flowering.\n\nIn 2008 Hersch had been feeling unwell and one day found himself unable to get out of his bathtub. His partner Scott Morgan rushed him to New Yorkâ€™s St. Vincentâ€˜s Hospital, where doctors discovered that he had pneumonia. They eventually determined that the condition was unrelated to the AIDS/HIV that Hersch has kept at bay for more than two decades. (The DVD was released on World Aids Day, December 1.) Still, the pneumonia was so severe that the doctors made the unusual decision to put him into a deep sleep that would help protect him from tissue infection until it was possible to treat the disorder.\n\nThe coma lasted six weeks, during which Hersch had dreams, some beautiful, some bizarre, some funny, all dramatic. He remembered many of them when he returned to consciousness. He told his friend the theatrical producer Herschel Garfein about the dreams. In 2005 the two had created an admired musical setting of Walt Whitmanâ€™s Leaves Of Grass. Now, they set about using Herschâ€™s coma dreams as the basis of a jazz theatre production.\n\nThe presentation was recorded in performance before an audience at Columbia Universityâ€™s Miller Theatre in the spring of 2013. It is a wondrous blending of Garfeinâ€™s story telling, new music by Hersch and virtuoso acting by Michael Winther, who also sings beautifully. Winther plays both Hersch and Morgan, often subtly melding the characters, delivering their lines conversationally without sacrificing anything of timing or the individuality Garfein wrote into the parts. He ranges around the stage, fading into the wings when the focus goes to Hersch and the 11-piece ensemble conducted by Greg Kallor. Judicious lighting shifts are part of the success of such moments. The stagecraft is simple and canny. Eerie rear screen projections are important to the atmosphere. Front screen transparencies now and then aid the narrative.\n\nHersch (pictured) performs with bassist John HÃ©bert and drummer John Hollenbeck in his rhythm section. The horns include trumpeter Ralph Alessi, saxophonist and flutist Adam Kolker. Among the strings are violinist Laura Seaton and cellist Dave Eggar. Hersch has moving solo moments. The full chamber orchestra plays compositions that enhance Wintherâ€™s descriptions of the dreams. In one sequence, Hersch and Thelonious Monk are confined in cages and ordered to write new pieces. Whoever finishes first will be freed. Hersch is in a panic. Monk is relaxed and smiling. In another, Hersch dreams that he and Morgan are in a huge airplane outfitted like a luxury hotel or spa. Served by exotic flight attendants, Hersch orders â€œa Bombay, a Tanqueray, give me that old Jim Beam. Iâ€™ll have a Manhattan and an Old Fashioned. Where is my daquiri?â€ He gets drunk. Morgan gets worried. In a dream sequence called â€œThe Knitters,â€ Hersch tells of finding himself looking down at a group of women, perhaps in a courtyard. They are knitting, and whispering, â€œWe end as we begin.â€ He puzzles over what they symbolizethe hope of life, the inevitability of death, the Fates? Kolkerâ€™s churning tenor saxophone solo reflects on the answer.\n\nIn â€œThe Jazz Diner in the Woods,â€ Hersch is consigned to play a dreadful gig backing an incompetent singer. We catch glimpses of a menu featuring dishes like Don Cherry Pie, Jimmy Cobb Salad, Mysterioso Meatlof, Bright Mississippi Mud Pie. Here, the alto sax solo is a slice of bebop served by Bruce Williamson. Hersch has a sense of humor in his coma dreams.\n\nToward the end, Herschâ€™s brain summons up â€œThe Orb,â€ a green glow that seems to contain Scottâ€™s face. He senses Scott saying, â€œCome to me. I love you.â€ For a month and a half, Scott has been by Fredâ€™s side in the hospital, massaging his arms, speaking to him, hoping but never certain that Fred will return to consciousness. In a final sequence, the real Fred Hersch improvises a beautiful soliloquy, then gets up from the piano, looks over at Winther playing Fred Hersch on parallel exercise bars and becomes his own mirror image matching Wintherâ€™s movements. He is learning to walk. He is on his slow way back to the recovery that has allowed him to resume his career in full.\n\nThis summary doesnâ€™t begin to suggest the intricacy of the Garfein script or the subtlety and beauty of Herschâ€™s music. As often with superior works of the imagination, it may not be possible to absorb the productionâ€™s complexities in one viewing.\n\nClifford Brown: Brownie Speaks (Glanden Productions)\n\nWithin its first two minutes, this skillful documentary tells of Clifford Brownâ€™s death. The trumpeterâ€™s presence and example remain so pervasive in jazz that the mere statement of the fact can still administer a shock. Brownâ€™s life ended in a crash in the rain as he slept in the back seat of a car on a Pennsylvania highway just after midnight on June 27, 1956. He was not yet 26. By the age of 18 his mastery of the instrument was so complete that after Dizzy Gillespie first heard him, he said, â€œHow in the hell can somebody who plays the trumpet like that not be known by me?â€\n\nSoon enough, everyone who seriously followed modern jazz knew. This film produced by veteran music educator Don Glanden tells Brownâ€™s short story through the recollections of members of his family, teachers, colleagues, and friends with whom he grew up in Wilmington, Delaware. The soundtrack, with rare exceptions, is from Brownâ€™s recordings. Interviews, dovetailed to create a narrative flow, include insights from Robert â€œBoysieâ€ Lowery, Brownâ€™s first trumpet teacher when Clifford was 12.\n\nRunning commentary comes from trumpeters Gillespie, Donald Byrd, Arturo Sandoval and Clora Bryant; collaborators including Max Roach, Harold Land, Sonny Rollins, Herb Geller, Jimmy Heath and Quincy Jones; andmost movinglythe late LaRue Brown Watson, the trumpeterâ€™s widow. Rollins tells of calling on Brown, years after his death, for inspiration when his own flagged. LaRue speaks of quickly progressing from skepticism about the value of Cliffordâ€™s music to being swept off her feet when he asked her to â€œmarry my music and me.â€ The clip is perfectly placed in the production.\n\nGlenden uses the classic documentary approach of letting the film tell the story without a narrator. He creates an understanding of Brownâ€™s congenial but firm personality, his clean life in a hard living milieu and the dedication behind what more than one observer identifies as the trumpeterâ€™s genius.\n\nGary McFarland thrived for a decade as one of the most admired young artists in modern jazz. In 1971 he may have been on his way to wide popular success when he was either murdered or died of a foolish mistake. He swallowed a dose of the artificial heroin called methadone and suffered a fatal heart attack. He was 38. No investigation has determined whether McFarland and a friend knowingly drank the methadone or someone slipped it into their drinks at a lower Manhattan bar. Both died, McFarland almost instantly of a heart attack, his friend the writer David Burnett in a coma a few days later.\n\nNow, despite the self-renewing freshness of his work, McFarland is largely overlooked outside of a core of admirers whose memories circumvent the quick-replacement mentality of the modern music business. This film by Kristian St. Clair could help lift the veil around the work of a musician whose quick rise from a small Oregon town to the top of the New York jazz milieu led the critic Gene Lees to identify him as an adult prodigy. In his scores for Gerry Mulligan, Anita Oâ€™Day, John Lewis, Stan Getz, Bob Brookmeyer, Bill Evans and others, McFarland managed to make his harmonies rich while also open and sunny. Unrestricted by conventional scoring practice, he created unique relationships among sections of the orchestra and produced an identifiable musical personality. His later work embraces a lighthearted pop-rock-samba sensibility but also, in the album America The Beautiful: An Account of Its Disappearance, a clear-eyed evaluation of the countryâ€™s 1960s foreign policy, political and environmental quagmire.\n\nThe new DVD, re-edited from an earlier version, is expanded with more and better images of McFarland in action, including the making of his famous Fresca commercial in a television studio snowstorm. The film places McFarland in a community that in the 1960s was still enjoying what a number of critics and historians of the music, including this one, have identified as the final period of a golden age of jazz in New York. The closeness of that community and the fellowship of its members are highlighted in a section of the film devoted to the midtown Manhattan bar Jim And Andyâ€™s, off-duty headquarters for dozens of the musicâ€™s leading figures.\n\nSt. Clairâ€™s film reports everything known about the circumstances of McFarlandâ€™s death, including the sparse recollection of drummer Gene Gammage, who survived drinking some of the methadone that killed McFarland and Burnett. It has interviews with McFarlandâ€™s widow. Musicians who express unreserved admiration for McFarland and his work include Grady Tate, Clark Terry, Bob Brookmeyer, Steve Kuhn, Bill Kirchner, Richard Davis, Gerry Mulligan, Sy Johnson and Antonio Carlos Jobim.\n\nForty-three years on, it grows less likely that the mystery of McFarlandâ€™s death will be solved. The importance of this film is its documentation of his intelligence, his joy in making music, the enduring quality of much of his work and the standing he enjoyed among an impressive cross section of his contemporaries.\n\n#\n\nFootnote\n\nIt is likely that to most of the listening public, McFarland was a major star compared with Warne Marsh (1927-1987). A tenor saxophonist, Marsh was one of the musicians who studied and performed with pianist Lennie Tristano. With and without Tristano, he often teamed in influential recordings with alto saxophonist Lee Konitz. Marsh inspired contemporary saxophonists who have gained far more renown than he did, among them Mark Turner and Anthony Braxton. His son, K.C. Marsh, intends to call attention to his father’s importance by making a documentary film. As most such projects must in the climate of today’s cultural economy, Marsh is asking for help in producing Warne Marsh: An Improvised Life. For details about what he needs, and to see him make his case, go here.\n\n[contextly_auto_sidebar id=”bLXjQhCHqLSvwiD0ns2KNtC7foLJY6By”]\n\nAlexander Eydelman, who founded the Moscow Jazz Art Club in 1993 and has been its only president, writes stories under the nameÂ Aleksander Antoshin. ThroughÂ the help of Rifftides Moscow correspondent Svetlana Ilicheva, Mr. Eydelman has agreed to our publishing one of his stories. Â TheÂ tale set in the 1960sÂ helps put in perspective some of the ways inÂ which Russian jazz fansÂ bucked the Soviet system’sÂ suppression of their efforts to hear American music.\n\nGETTING TO KNOW BRUBECK\n\nByÂ Aleksander Antoshin\n\nThe alarm clock rang at eight sharp. I cursed this damned punctual tin can and then, forcing my eyes open, stared lifelessly into the empty whiteness of the ceiling. I knew I had to make myself get up, I definitely had toâ€”since I had promised Valery, Val, my best friend, to help him with the repairs on his can, an ancient “Moskvitch.” I raised my hands, palms gripping an imaginary gymnastic bar, a habitual exercise, and thenâ€”writhing and groaningâ€”struggled to pull myself up, but every time, after each painful effort, my handsâ€”with this imaginary barâ€”ended by falling back heavily on my chest. To anyone watching, it would all have looked funny and even idiotic. But there was no one to disturb my romping around as I fought against this stubborn ghostly bar. Another series of jerksâ€”hands, legs, body almost in a knotâ€”and a mighty spring inside me threw my body and soul out of the bed.\n\nThe outside door shut, leaving behind me the wet darkness of the entrance hall, and I was immediately immersed in the warmth and bright light of the summer morning that had enveloped the city. Val lived in an apartment block not far away, on the bank of the Yauza river, a tributary of the Moskva. I set off beside the cast-iron parapet of the embankment. The river ran by, its murky waters patterned with oily stains rushing towards its estuary.Â In the courtyard, by his fatherâ€™s old crate, a Moskvitch, stood young Val. His early bald patch made him look much older than I, though we were the same age.\n\nâ€˜Well, Val, letâ€™s get started, we havenâ€™t much time. Got a date at four,â€™ I said.\n\nI lifted the car with a jack, spread a mat under it and crawled on my back to take off the gear-box. Everything in this jalopy was greasy, dirty, everything leaked and dripped. Moreover, it appeared that the clutch was broken, too. Curses and groans accompanied my superhuman efforts to undo the rusted bolts and nuts as I gradually managed to make some progress. Then, at last, the gear-box was free.\n\nIt was at this moment, that I suddenly heard the music â€“ mysterious and unfamiliar. It was jazz, I knew, jazz I loved so much, as I used to spend nights listening to it on my short-wave radio (1). The music I was hearing now sounded, however, absolutely new to me.\n\n(1)In the early Sixties, when these events took place, as well as in the earlier period, the Soviet regime did not favour this kind of music, so young jazz lovers usually listened to the nightly jazz programmes on the BBC or the Voice of America.\n\nThe pianist played an ornate, lacy melody evoking associations with Bachâ€™s themes. Absolutely precise phrases, each in its proper place, lined up in a polyphonic series, mutually complementing and merging into one intriguing and enchanting tune. A saxophone entered with a beautiful mellow shave joining the current of piano tones, and followed them with improvisation full of trilling drive and then, solo, building up an airy crystal-clear edifice of sounds.\n\nI crept out from under the car. Val gazed at me inquiringly.\n\nâ€˜What â€˜s the matter? Need something?â€™\n\nâ€˜No. Yes. I need to know, where that musicâ€™s coming from.â€™\n\nâ€˜From Zhorkaâ€™s flat. See that window on the second floor? He must be drinking now, I reckon, is Zhorka. When heâ€™s had a couple he usually puts his tape-recorder on to max.â€™\n\nDirty and messy as I was I set off in the direction which Val had shown me and, stopping under the window, looked up. The alto sax went on weaving its intricate and, at the same time, simple and melodious pattern. It seemed as though this music was spiralling high up, I could visualise it clearly – winding higher and higher, into the skies. Heavenly music. But who was playing it?\n\nMy legs carried me to the front door drawn by the sound, which was getting stronger as I approached. Poor neighbours, they must hate this Zhorka, and his jazz. Second floor. Volume at full. White button of the doorbell. I looked at my hands, covered in grease, then at the shining whiteness of the button, and cautiously pressed it with my nail. The recorder, at top volume, seemed about to explode, and hardly anybody could hear my short, shy ringing over the music. Then I resolutely pressed my dirty finger on this virgin white button again. At last, the door opened. On the threshold, in the twilight of the hallway, stood a lad in a white T-shirt. His round face gleamed red â€“ with booze and with the joy of life reigning over these premises. His small round eyes beamed tipsy good humour and his lips sported an amicable smile.\n\nâ€˜Whoâ€™s this, Snow-white?!â€˜ he said. â€˜Snouu-wahy-tie, Snouu-wahy-tie!â€™ he kept repeating, choking with laughter and rejoicing at his own joke. Exhausted with laughing, he stared at me again, and asked:\n\nâ€˜Who are you? And why are you so dirty? What do you want?â€™\n\nâ€˜I want to know what music that is, and whoâ€™s playing?â€™\n\nâ€˜Ah, thatâ€™s it. Câ€™min then, Snow-whitie,â€™ he said again collapsing with laughter.\n\nI stepped forward into the room with the roaring recorder, I saw sheets of music paper and copies of American magazines scattered over the piano, an exquisite candlestick , a big decanter and glasses on a coffee table, and a Himalayan mass of empty bottles in the corner.\n\nâ€˜My nameâ€™s Zhorka. Want a drink?â€™\n\nI introduced myself and agreed to the treat. Zhorka took two tumblers and poured some liquor from a decanter.\n\nâ€˜Straight?â€™ he asked.\n\nâ€˜Straight,â€™ I said promptly â€“ not thinking about the consequences. I took the glass and tossed down its contents. Fiery fluid â€“ it was pure alcohol â€“ caught my throat, my mouth was burning, tears spurted from my eyes. I groped for water – and at once found a glass in my hand: Zhora who had been observing me in silence, and with interest, had thoughtfully prepared it beforehand. Then he drank his own glass and we began a dialogue which has continued for many years now.\n\nâ€˜Stunning music! This concert was recorded in 1957, itâ€™s called â€œJazz Impressions of Eurasiaâ€. Know whoâ€™s playing?â€™ he asked. â€˜Itâ€™s the Dave Brubeck Quartet. Know Brubeck? No? Fantastic pianist, yes, he is. Top-level! There is also Paul Desmond with alto, then, too, Joe Morello on drums, Jo Benjamin on bass. All the compositions are Brubeckâ€™s. Now theyâ€™re playing his dedication to Chopin, named â€œDziÄ™kujÄ™!â€ â€“ meaning â€œThank you!â€ in Polish. Now, listen, listen!â€™\n\nA drunken tear appeared in his eye.\n\nI listened to Brubeckâ€™s solo, enjoying every sound, every harmony, every passage of this miraculously subtle, delicate melody bridging times â€“ bringing together the 19th and the 20th centuries.\n\nThen the composition ended. Zhora switched the tape-recorder off and with undisguised curiosity launched into questioning me on my modest person, my background, then asking where I got my infatuation with jazz, what I had read on the subject and what I read in general, and what I usually did in my leisure time. I answered all his questions in detail appreciating the fact that he was listening attentively to my spontaneous revelations, not once interrupting me.\n\nâ€˜And what was the first tune, the one I heard in the courtyard?â€™ I asked switching from answers to questions.\n\nZhora said nothing but went to the recorder and put it on â€œRewindâ€, then started the tape from the beginning, and, as the first sounds filled the room, he asked :\n\nâ€˜This one, you mean? Oh, thatâ€™s a real masterpiece! Itâ€™s called Brandenburg Gate, but itâ€™s not by Bach, itâ€™s Brubeckâ€™s own piece!â€™\n\nWe gave in to the music, for a long while uttering not a single word and wholly absorbed by the fascinating tunes. I saw, however, that now and then Zhora glanced at me â€“ to see how attentive I was and how receptive to the music. I could understand his curiosity, I realised that this exquisite concert was a kind of litmus paper to test me.\n\nKeeping silent and once in a while draining our glasses we went on listening up to the end of the tape. From the start, Zhora had been sitting at the piano and, as the music progressed and the liquor in the decanter accordingly regressed, a sentimental mood more and more crept over him, leaving wet traces on his red cheeks. Suddenly he started playing a tune in the same mood as the dedication to Chopin which we had just heard, it was also beautiful and unknown to me. Zhora finished the core theme and, driving it with his right hand into series of variations, while his left hand added even more ornate chords.\n\nâ€˜And whatâ€™s this? What terrific music!â€™\n\nâ€˜Like it? Very good, matey. This, my dear, is Mazurka in A minor by Chopin. Good music, as youâ€™ll agree. And it may not be quite jazz, at least, not the kind we are used toâ€¦ But only fatheads, narrow-minded fatheads, and there are plenty of those, stick to one single thing and refuse everything else. Savvy? And, now, look at Brubeck, a born American, a jazzman to the bone, he wrote marvellous music, but dedicated it to the great Europeansâ€¦â€™\n\nSuddenly there was a whistle outside the window. And at last remembering Valery, I looked over the balcony.\n\nThere was my poor abandoned friend, helplessly waving his arms and appealing to my conscience. At this moment Zhora came to my rescue:\n\nâ€˜Val, stop being silly! Your mate wonâ€™t do anything useful for you, anyway, not after all heâ€™s drunk. You guys better call it a day. Come on up now. There is some booze left for you!â€™\n\nVal thought for a bit, shrugged his shoulders and ran for the entrance door.\n\nWe revelled late into the night. Zhoraâ€™s old Soviet-made recorder worked non-stop, the American jazzmen, one after another, testing its stamina. Never before had I heard so much wonderful jazz, I was brimming over with happiness, realising that something very important had happened in my lifeâ€¦\n\n* * *\n\nYears passed. In 1996, I found myself in Copenhagen at a concert of the great pianist Michel Petrucciani, an unhappy dwarf in life and a happy giant in music. The concert was in a circus building packed to the brim. Petrucciani played solo; there was absolute silence in the huge auditorium, but at the end of each piece the audience exploded with thunderous applause.\n\nThe programme came to an end, the audience stood applauding and shouting encores. The little man walked on his crutches back to the piano, sat down and thought. The audience froze. It was as though you could hear the musicianâ€™s heartbeat. And then he touched the keys. With the first chord I felt a lump in my throat and stinging in my eyes. And to prevent myself from crying, I took deep breaths. Michel was playing Chopin’s Mazurka in A minor.\n\nDuring Brubeckâ€™s last visit to Moscow, there was a reception in the Spaso-House, the residence of the US Ambassador, and the Maestro played there with Russian musicians. As the time for the last piece came, Dave said he was going to play his favourite piece. And sitting down at the piano, he played his magical dedication to Chopin â€“ â€˜DzÄ™kujÄ™!â€™.\n\n#\n\nÂ©Alexander Eydelman\n\nThe author is the Founder (1993) and President of the Jazz Art Club in Moscow.\n\nThe story was translated by Rostislav V.
