        "text": "Gorguts is a Canadian technical death metal band from Sherbrooke, Quebec, formed in 1989. The band has been through many personnel changes since its inception, and its only constant member has been guitarist and vocalist Luc Lemay, who remains the primary creative force in the band. To date they have released five full-length albums and one EP. Their most recent release is the EP Pleiades' Dust, released on May 13, 2016, which consists of a single 33-minute song about the House of Wisdom that once stood in Baghdad. Their latest full-length album Colored Sands was released in 2013 and was nominated for a Juno Award. Musically the band is known for its complex, musically dense form of technical death metal, and has become \"one of the most advanced, experimental, and challenging groups in the entire genre.\" These dudes are an unstoppable force that you truly must see live. They'll be here June 5th at The Loving Touch!\n\nBlack Metal is something that some hold as a very sacred thing. When this music started it was only the most sincere and unholy that carried the torches through the darkest pits of human nature. While bands such as Venom,Bathory,Merciful Fate, Celtic Frost and Hellhammer were among the pioneers, there was a second wave of an often more extreme nature that were birthed out of Norway,Swedin,Germany and beyond. Bands such as Mayhem,Burzum,Satyricon,Darkthrone, Dissection,Marduck and Gorgoroth. Among these legendary bands was Taake. Originally formed and known as Thule in 1993 the lead songwriter and frontman carried on as the unholy Taake. All the way from Norway Taake will crush you with their blistering show. If you're into Jesus Christ you may want to stay home for this one...or not.\n\nIf you could have FELT readers check out one song of yours, what would it be?: My new song \"New Sound\"\n\nTough question - what is your ultimate favorite album of all time?: Refused: Shape of Punk to Come\n\nWhat is the best show you've ever played, and why?: 72,000+ people at the Vive Latino festival in Mexico city, 2001. Playing for that many people as they were not just crowd surfing but literally walking across people's heads, bonfires, and people being tossed up into the air 4 stories from a trampoline style blanket controlled by 50 people. I got just as much entertainment as they did. It was a really neat spectacle.\n\nIs there a song that will make you cry, 9 times out of 10, if you let it? : \"I will always love you\" but ONLY the Dolly Parton version. It was the song my dad and I danced to at my wedding.\n\nIf you had a song that just didn't want to be finished, which group would you call in to wrap that sucker up - The Bee Gees or The Eagles? : The Eagles\n\nwhy?: there are a lot of terrible bands out there....\"any band ever\" is just like....setting me up for potential disaster of epic proportions\n\nIf you could see one person in the audience when you perform, who would that be? What would they be wearing?: Not sure of the question so I'll do my best. If the question is, in general who do i see in the audience? Usually the tallest person that isn't moving. If i could see anyone in my audience if i could choose it would be my dad. He just passed away. He'd be wearing an XL Save Ferris shirt :)\n\nAny bands you think people should seek out and pay attention to?: Not sure of anything current, but if I were telling young people how to fill their vinyl collection, I'd insist on a bunch of Clash.\n\nWhat is your comic relief on the road? A band member, Netflix, prank phone call podcasts, etc?: Alex Mathias. Our Irish Sax player. He's a good sport, god bless him."
