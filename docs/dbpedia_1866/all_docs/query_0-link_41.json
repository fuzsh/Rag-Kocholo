It can be a challenge: A climate-controlled comfy couch and inertia can conquer the desire to venture out at 11 p.m. on a Tuesday and fork over $10 for a band you’ve never heard of.\n\nThankfully, the Outside the Box festival is cham­pioning my cause.\n\nOutside the Box is a fun, free, fabulous gift from arts patron Ted Cutler to the city of Boston. It has 200 musical acts and theater troupes performing on a half-dozen stages on Boston Common and City Hall Plaza from tomorrow through July 21. (See outsidetheboxboston.org for complete details.)\n\nUnlike typical free summer music fare (a solo folkie­ with an acoustic guitar, a conservative jazz combo), Outside the Box features some of my favorite locals: ascendant acts aiming to become national names.\n\n“It’s pretty overwhelming in a great way,” Bearstronaut frontman David Martineau said. “You see summer festivals that are half craft fair, half a food festival, with a band tossed in. That’s not what this is. The organizers had a good grasp on what putting on live music at this level means.”\n\nThe festival will bring in some choice out-of-town guests (Taj Mahal, Los Lobos, Blind Boys of Alabama) and local legends (Mighty Mighty Bosstones, Lemonheads, Buffalo Tom). But it’s the wide, careful curation of young Boston artists that I dig deeply.\n\n“The acts selected aren’t those that play every week at a random bar,” singer/songwriter Sarah Blacker said. “They’re artists working to make a full-time career of playing. For me and others at my level, this platform is great.”\n\nFor Air Traffic Controller frontman Dave Munro, it’s a chance to play to a new demographic and a big audience — the band plays the Boston Common main stage.\n\n“We’ve played a lot of similar festivals, shows that are fun and family friendly, but never in Boston, and never on a stage this huge,” Munro said. “This is such an artistic city, it’s really unique to have a festival that celebrates all our arts at once right in the center of the city.”\n\nBut don’t take his word for it. Take mine. Here are my must-sees for rock fans of all genres."
