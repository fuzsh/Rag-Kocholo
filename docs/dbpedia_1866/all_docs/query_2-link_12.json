        "text": "\"Sex Soul Rock n' Roll - Blog Archive - Leslie Dysinger (special pick)\"\n\nLose your girlfriend. Get fired. Take a handful of downers and drive 70 miles on the highway at night with no destination in mind. And do it listening to Leslie Dysinger’s music. You’ll be better off for it.\n\nYou’ll hold your melancholy outlook over the heads of all your other depressed friends because Leslie’s songs will make you believe that your heartbreak is beautiful. When she sings, it’s just for you, damn it.\n\nEven if you’ve repeatedly shrugged off country inspired “sad bastard” music, or if singer-songwriter is a genre that you stereotype and ignore, I encourage you to give her a listen. It probably wont make you flock to Nashville to become a country music roadie. It probably wont even make you consider listening to similar artists. But Leslie seems to step outside genre-appeal, and her storytelling can be appreciated by anyone. Except maybe metalheads. But fuck metalheads.\n\n-John Drake\n\nhttp://www.sexsoulrocknroll.com/blog/?p=57\n\n- www.sexsoulrocknroll.com\n\n\"WOS-Best of Triple A (AAA)\"\n\n\"WOS-Best of Triple A (AAA)\" features all Indie Artists from our playlist. \"Your Regrets\" continues to be played in our regular rotation.\n\nhttp://www.live365.com/stations/breenoble\n\nTRIPLE A PLAYLIST #2\n\nEmma Dean, \"Cocaine”\n\nHalcyon, \"Margaret Says\"\n\nLindsay Drummond, \"Get Me Thru”\n\nJaeger, \"Black Black”\n\nJulie Marinelli, \"Water Off a Duck s Back”\n\nJen Porter and The Most Fabulous Band, \"My Own Hand\"\n\nNicola, \"Anybody Out There”\n\nMaryJet, \"Fade Out”\n\nSharon Paquette, \"Good Things Are Gonna Happen”\n\nMia Adams & The Scenic Roots, \"Million To One”\n\nGoodbye Gadget, \"Bitter Freedom”\n\nLeslie Dysinger, \"Your Regrets\"\n\nLauren DeRose, \"Me & My Earthquake\"\n\nDanan Healy, \"I am”\n\nCasey Desmond, \"Julia Butterfly Hill”\n\n- Women of Substance\n\n\"Places to Go, People To See\"\n\nLeslie Dysinger — 12 South Taproom and Grill.

(That's actually kind of intriguing, so kudos to her PR flacks for coming up with that nugget.) In truth, Dysinger is a veteran rocker who has been playing in bands off and on since the early 1990s. Along the way, she migrated to Memphis and back, and in recent years has focused on honing her chops. The result is her debut solo record Cause & Effect, which offers up poignant and straightforward storytelling. Her tour in support of said album brings her to The Rud this Saturday, along with Louisville singer-songwriters Brandon Britton and Lauren Conkin. Showtime is 7p.m., door is $5.\n\nKevin Gibson\n\nLEO - www.leoweekly.com - LEO December 17, 2008"
