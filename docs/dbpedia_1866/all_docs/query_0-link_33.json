        "text": "Celebrates 15 Year Anniversary\n\n“Some of you already know I’ve signed several bad records deals in my career. That prompted me early on to create my own independent label, FiXT. We wondered through the years if we could survive as a label, and here we are 15 years later, with the biggest and best roster, staff and resources we’ve ever had, and there’s a lot more to come.”\n\n– Klayton (President & Founder, FiXT)\n\nLos Angeles, California – FiXT, the independent, artist-owned record label from artist/producer Klayton (best known for his projects Celldweller, Scandroid, and Circle of Dust), has announced a full company rebrand today. In addition to visual branding changes, FiXT announced major updates to its 2 existing label divisions, FiXT and FiXT Neon, along with launching a 3rd, all-new EDM division, FiXT Noir.\n\nFiXT’s rock/metal division, which has been operating since 2006, has been re-branded as FiXT Radium. The label has announced 4 new exclusive artist signings – the division’s first female fronted electronic-rock project, Daedric, UK electro-nu-core 6-piece Seething Akira, Eastern Europe electro-metal duo Nitroverts, and Canada-based artist Richy Nix with his metal meets hip-hop fusion.

For those who have been following, you know that I’ve collaborated with some big names in EDM, and FiXT operated the world’s largest EDM merch store for many years. So here it is, 2021, and I’m really excited to announce the launch of FiXT’s brand new EDM label division, FiXT Noir.”\n\n– Klayton (President & Founder, FiXT)\n\nFiXT Noir, the company’s all new EDM label division announced the debut exclusive roster signing of UK metal/drum & bass producer Toronto Is Broken, along with upcoming releases from a wide ranging list of artists, including: Celldweller, Biometrix, Teddy Killerz, KJ Sawka, Becko, Aktive, Tenebrax, Glacier, Elliot Berger, Social Kid, BVLVNCE, Zardonic, Blosso, Everen Maxwell, Similar Outskirts, Tadeusz, Everything Must Go, A_Rival, Too Kind, Ian Snow, Totto, Deuce & Charger, Punker, Gazz, Foxhunt, Matt Neux, Natty Campbell, Killin Void, Asteroid Afterparty, KYB, Timian, Neddie, Mattsh, NVFNAL, Shaded Grains, Only Kidding, and more.\n\nFiXT Noir launches with its debut release “Traction” by Neddie, out everywhere July 14th, with Toronto Is Broken’s full-length album Clare featuring an all new remix from Zardonic dropping July 16th. The label’s release schedule will consist of dual releases each week moving forward.\n\nWatch The Full Announcement Event:\n\nCelebrating the company’s 15 year anniversary milestone, FiXT revealed it reaches millions of listeners each month and has accrued billions of streams and thousands of Film/TV/Video Game placements across its catalog. The company highlighted industry membership associations with A2iM (American Association of Independent Music), Merlin, and FUGA, providing its artists with industry leading distribution, premium DSP deals, and relationships.\n\nFor more information, visit www.fixtmusic.com.\n\nFollow FiXT Radium:\n\nhttps://fanlink.to/followfixt\n\nFollow FiXT Neon:\n\nhttps://fanlink.to/followfixtneon\n\nFollow FiXT Noir:\n\nhttps://fanlink.to/followfixtnoir\n\n2020 goes out with a bang for the FiXT Neon Team.

Since then we’ve continued to expand our interest in partnering with the streaming community, with various sponsorships as well as making our catalog available on stream-safe streaming platform Pretzel. Now, with the FiXT Music Stream Team, we’re incredibly proud to be working with a core group of passionate streamers, helping us spread the music and our message even further.”\n\n– James Rhodes (FIXT VP & Co-Founder)\n\nFiXT Neon Q&A Zoom Events\n\nLaunched Three Anthologies\n\nArtist Achievements\n\nFiXT VP, James Rhodes Has Been Busy!\n\nIn February, James Rhodes, FiXT VP hung out with No Ordinary Nerd Podcast to discuss the future of the label, expanding and adding to our label roster, music in video games, Altered Carbon and Lost in Space.
