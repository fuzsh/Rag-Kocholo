Ndoumbé received their bachelors in African & African American Studies, and Feminist, Gender & Sexuality, at Stanford University. Ndoumbé has worked for organizations such as Warner Bros., artists such as Lena Waithe, and developed content for private clients, the Sex Workers’ Education and Advocacy Taskforce (SWEAT), Color of Change, IDA, as well as other independent organizations. They are currently based out of Woodstock where they work closely with SWEAT to produce visual content around the decriminalization of sex work, with an emphasis on supporting Queer and Trans communities of color.\n\nNdoumbé’s scattered Diasporic background – which saw them grappling with Blackness across geo-political boundaries early in life (born in France, moved to Los Angeles at the age of 9) – as well as their continued building of relationships with Black Queers around the world, allows them to be in conversation across Diaspora. The key with their work isn’t just in the content but also in the process, and the histories of what such processes have meant for many key populations captured and shared outside of their own context. Ndoumbe’s position as a Black, Trans, and gender- nonconforming individual – even within the complex racial-read of their current surroundings in South Africa – allows them access to communities that one doesn’t always get to see. Ndoumbé is focused on creating work asserting itself within the conversation around a decolonial aesthetic, and a radical archiving.\n\nThe push is to create artistic content which engages in the active processes of unlearning, re-shifting, and the questioning of hegemonic power structures – in the proximity of content to audiences, the process through which the work is captured, and also in its choice of materials and curation. Trust is a vital ingredient to their process.\n\nWhat began with Undone (2015 – 2016) – an intimate portraiture series on Black and Queer individuals shot in London, New Orleans, and NYC – quickly saw Ndoumbé turning to visual art to portray and amplify the voices, spirits, and bodies of Black and Queer people. Undone came out of a need to see themselves – as well as a turning of the camera onto friends and chosen family, while finding the beauty so inherently present in their existence.\n\nThe Coffee Shop as Queer Salon, Parts I & II, and Portraits (2017-present) is a photographic and visual exploration that seeks to honor both a historical legacy and current moment of queer bodies within the context of the politics of space.\n\nThe project is also in conversation with how visual art can be a mechanism to establish agency for queer bodies. In this continued series, Ndoumbé focuses on the spatial dynamics and the occupation of queer bodies in the coffee shop space. The current archive of the series finds its roots in the Bay Area, California, USA.\n\nIn the spirit of embodied artistic work and collective re-imagining, Ndoumbé used an exhibit opening for Portraits from the Salon on display at the Field Office in February of 2018, in Woodstock, to collaborate with other local and queer artists of color to facilitate The Queer Salon. During the evening, members of Queer and Trans Communities of Color were invited in to share space, connect, create, and express themselves in community with one another."
