        "text": "If you have been following the Best Songs of 2011 series, you know that we are in the midst of creating a total of 12 volumes of the best songs of 2011 – one for each month of the year. Unlike most ‘best songs’ lists, we are creating each volume chronologically by the month in which the songs were first featured on IRC.\n\nSo far, January, February and March have been completed (click the month to access each mixtape), and the number of visits to those mixes has been impressive – over 115,000 so far. The best songs are based on which tracks all of you listened to and downloaded the most for the month in question. Therefore, this is truly a Listeners’ Choice music series.\n\nNow it’s time to highlight the month of April, which saw fantastic releases from artists and bands like The Kills, The Raveonettes, Panda Bear, Foo Fighters, Crystal Stilts, Wild Nothing, Arctic Monkeys, Beach Fossils, to name a few.\n\nThis first batch of tracks represents the four No. 1 weekly songs for April 2011. Not surprisingly, many of the albums from which the Best Songs of 2011 originate from will also appear in IRC’s Best Albums of 2011 series starting next month. The spectacular garage rock duo, The Kills, captured the first No. 1 song spot for April with the track, “Satellite.”\n\nThe No. 1 song for the second week of April easily went to “Surfer’s Hymn” off the long-awaited sophomore solo album from Panda Bear, Tomboy. For the third week of April, the lesser known band Tuneyards took the top slot with their single, “Bizness,” and the French Horn Rebellion prevailed in the last week of the month with their new track, “This Moment.”\n\n“Satellite” – The Kills from Blood Pressures\n\n“Surfer’s Hymn” – Panda Bear from Tomboy\n\n“Bizness” – Tuneyards from Whokill\n\n“This Moment” – The French Horn Rebellion from The Infinite Music of the French Horn Rebellion\n\nEarly April – The Kills, The Raveonettes, Scattered Trees, Maritime, Panda Bear, Foo Fighters, Crystal Stilts\n\nThe Kills are one of our favorite female/male garage rock duos. In fact, we can only hope they keep going well beyond the 10-year mark they achieved last year. While The White Stripes are officially disbanded, it’s easy for us to say that The Kills’ are our favorite still-active girl/guy rock duo. The Kills’ latest album, Blood Pressures, released last April, was one of our favorite albums of 2011 from the start, and eight months later (wow, Old Man Time, you move pretty fast for an old guy). It was no surprise that two of the songs from the LP were two of the top three songs for the first week of April.\n\nAnd if that wasn’t enough for lovers of garage rock duos, the Danish duo The Raveonettes also dropped their latest album, Raven In The Grave, roughly the same time as The Kills. The fact that all the Top Ten Songs are picked by the number of plays and downloads makes the 10 list even more special. Other new singles from Scattered Trees, Maritime, Cold Cave, Glasvegas, Code Pie, and Wolf Ram Heart also made it into the Top Ten Songs, and thus the top songs for April 2011.\n\n“Satellite” – The Kills from Blood Pressures\n\n“Recharge and Revolt” – The Raveonettes from Raven In The Grave\n\n“DNA” – The Kills from Blood Pressures\n\nScattered Trees are a band that crossed our radar early in 2011 with the lead track, “A Conversation About Death on New Years Eve,” not really because of the catchy title (we try to avoid falling for gimmicks), but the fact that it’s a great song by a band not many music lovers have heard of. Also, The Raveonettes second chart-ranking single, “Forget That You’re Young,” rounded out the Top 5 of the first full week of April’s Top Ten Songs mix. Click here to hear the other five tracks.\n\n“A Conversation About Death on New Year’s Eve” – Scattered Trees from Sympathy\n\n“Forget That You’re Young” – The Raveonettes from Raven In The Grave\n\nListen to more songs from Maritime, Cold Cave, Glasvegas, Code Pie and Wolf Ram Heart.\n\nApril, Week Two: Panda Bear Release; Coachella and Record Store Day\n\nApril 10th – April 16th\n\nThis was a big week in music, in addition to Best New Releases from artists like Panda Bear, Foo Fighters and Crystal Stilts, there was the massive preparation that went into preparing and posting IRC’s guide to the 4th annual Record Store Day.\n\nWe literally reviewed many dozens, perhaps over one hundred, special RSD-only limited edition vinyls released by bands ranging from Radiohead and Foo Fighters to Foster The People and The Rolling Stones. And if all of that wasn’t exciting enough for music lovers, the second week of April was also all about Coachella, so it was another excuse to create a mixtape of some of our favorite artists at Coachella 2011. Read our mini-rant about the commercialization of music festivals at the end of this post. Notwithstanding, it was yet another outstanding year for Coachella; and each year, they’re getting better at every aspect of the festival, from the line-up to the sanitation – both are key to a festival’s success.\n\nListen to/download IRC’s Coachella Mix).\n\nAfter a long, long wait for fans, Animal Collective founding member Noah Lennox (aka, Panda Bear), released his latest solo album, Tomboy, an LP that we’ve been enjoying considerably, and so have many of you. Therefore, it shouldn’t be too much of a surprise that two tracks we featured from Tomboy took the top spots, followed by Foo Fighters, Crystal Stilts, Ghost Heart, Holy Ghost, Agnes Obel, Mazes, The White Stripes and The Beastie Boys. All based on which songs you guys play and download the most for the week.\n\n“Surfer’s Hymn” – Panda Bear from Tomboy\n\n“Last Night At The Jetty” – Panda Bear from Tomboy\n\n“Back and Forth” – Foo Fighters from Wasting Light\n\n“Through The Floor” – Crystal Stilts from In Love With Oblivion\n\n“Wilderness” – Ghost Heart from The Tunnel\n\nListen to more Top Ten tracks for the week of April 10-16.\n\nOn the same Saturday that Coachella (get the Coachella mix) was in full swing, bands, labels and music lovers – especially vinyl collectors – were partaking in the fourth annual Record Store Day. Not only was it the largest RSD in as far as the number of participating record stores across the U.S. and around the world, RSD 2011 also saw more limited edition vinyls and other limited releases, from reissues to special imports and compilations to cover songs.\n\nOn Record Store Day, the iconic Beastie Boys, who helped bring hip-hop to a larger worldwide audience 20 years ago, released a new track, “Make Some Noise” from their latest album, Hot Sauce Committee, Pt. 2 (listen/download the full mix here). The track just barely missed the Top 10 list for that week. Another RSD single was the cheerily, upbeat indie pop of “Plastic Flowers” (from The Wake) by Beach Fossils limited edition vinyl that the band split with Wild Nothing.\n\n“Make Some Noise” – The Beastie Boys from Hot Sauce Committee Pt 2\n\n“Plastic Flowers” (The Wake) – Beach Fossils from split vinyl Beach Fossils/Wild Nothing\n\n“Gruesome Castle” (The Wake) – Wild Nothing from split vinyl Beach Fossils/Wild Nothing\n\n“Don’t Sit Down Because I Moved Your Chair” – Arctic Monkeys from RSD single\n\nGet more singles from limited edition vinyls released on Record Store Day in RSD Songs, Vol. One and Vol. Two (Cover Songs).\n\nApril 17th – April 23rd\n\nThe Top Ten for the third week of April highlighted some talented new bands who elevated their profile, and expanded their fan base, with some note-worthy new albums from which originated standout singles, including the No. 1 track “Bizness” from Tuneyards, followed by The Head and the Heart‘s first significant single from the Subpop Records‘ re-released, self-titled debut, “Lost in My Mind.” They also took the No. 4 slot with another track from the album, “Chasing A Ghost.” In 2009, the Seattle band self-released their debut, and it caught on, selling some 10,000 copies in just a few months. It’s fair to say that The Head and the Heart, thanks in part to being scooped up by Subpop, really broke out as a serious indie folk-pop band in 2011.\n\nNot far behind at No. 3 for the third week of April was the incredibly catchy, melodic indie pop-rock of I’m From Barcelona, a Swedish band which we have been enjoying since the 29 member band released their first EP and LP in 2006. Ever since then, the IFB collective has continued to turn out material which has evolved, and shown just how wonderfully eclectic the band’s music offerings are.\n\n“Lost in My Mind” – The Head and the Heart from The Head and the Heart\n\n“Get In Line” – I’m From Barcelona from Forever Today\n\n“Chasing A Ghost” (Chapel Session) – The Head and the Heart from The Head and the Heart\n\n“Dirty D” – Futurebirds from Futurebirds EP\n\n“Model Son” – Heavenly States from Oui Camera Oui\n\n“Fly Baby, Fly” – The High Llamas from Talahomi Way\n\nFor the final week of April, The French Horn Rebellion, a breakout band in 2011, grab the No. 1 spot, as featured with the other number one’s at the beginning of the post. Following closely behind at No. 2 was the newest irresistible single from Times New Viking, a band that is really one of our favorites to emerge over the past few years. Their track “Ever Falling In Love” from their album, Dancer Equired, was neck-and-neck with the FHR for the No. 1 spot, easily making it one of the best songs of the month. The band’s 2008 album, Rip It Off, one of our favorites of that year, received a 8 out of 10 from NME and even reached No. 17 on Billboard’s Heatseekers chart. New York via Philadelphia indie rock band Matt Pond PA returns with somewhat of a new sound on their lead single, “Love To Get Used,” from the EP, Spring Fools, followed by another emerging 2011 band, Painted Palms and the ever-reliable The Globes.\n\n“Ever Falling In Love” – Times New Viking from Dancer Equired\n\n“Love To Get Used” – Matt Pond PA from Spring Fools EP\n\n“All of Us” – Painted Palms from Canopy EP\n\n“Stay Awake” – The Globes from Future Songs\n\n“Sex Karma” – Of Montreal from thecontrollersphere\n\nMore Singles from April – Cold Cave, Scattered Trees, Maritime, Cursed Arrows, Glasvegas\n\nThe Top Ten Songs lists are awesome – and visitor determined based on streams and downloads – but there are plenty of other great songs from April playlist mixes that don’t make the Top 10, but do make the Top 20 and Top 30 – if we were to expand the Top Ten. Of course, the first recommendation we’d make is to listen to more mixtapes from April if you enjoy the tracks featured so far in this special Best Songs of 2011, Vol. IV mixtape. In fact, you can access all April mixes below. But first, let’s check out more highlighted tracks from mixes for the first half of April. Some of these will surely include tracks that many of you have never heard before.\n\n“Great Pan Is Dead” – Cold Cave from Cherish the Light Years (Bonus Track)\n\n“A Conversation About Death on New Year’s Eve” – Scattered Trees from Sympathy\n\n“Paraphernalia” – Maritime from Human Hearts\n\n“Death Rattle Blues” – Cursed Arrows from The Madness of Crowds\n\n“The World Is Yours” – Glasvegas from Euphoric/Heartbreak\n\n…Many others coming up…still have May through December. Listen to and download Best Songs of 2011 – January through March.\n\nIt’s hard to believe that 2011 is almost over. It seemed like not really that long ago that we were putting together our Best Songs of 2010 mixtapes (now working on Vol. IV for 2011) – which by the way, are still up and running (a few missing mp3 links, but 90% operational), and well worth listening to if you missed them originally. Plus, with Christmas in the air, don’t miss out on the largest online collection of indie and alternative rock Christmas songs.\n\nAnyways, this week marks the third to last Best New Releases mix for 2011. Problem is, there is not that much to talk about this week, and we suspect it will be like this for the rest of the year. Nevertheless, you can access mixes featuring hundreds and hundreds of great songs from 2011. Browse, stream and download the archives of mixes like Best New Releases, Recent Releases We Almost Missed, In Dee Mail, Bands to Watch, Summer Songs and more. That should be plenty to keep you busy for a while, and don’t miss the on-going new series, Best Songs of 2011 (Vol. IV will be published Sunday; all 12 volumes will be published by the end of January 2012).\n\nFirst up, the prolific musician, instrumentalist and composer Jonsi (Sigur Ros) has a lot going on recently. In October, Sigur Ros‘ released a new double live album and film, Inni. Last month, the band confirmed they were also working on a new “ambient” album slated for release in the spring of 2012 (another reason to look forward to spring).\n\nHopefully, we won’t have to wait that long to hear the first couple of tracks from the yet-to-be-named LP. And this week, Jonsi is garnering tons of mainstream media and blog coverage due to the release of the new movie, and accompanying soundtrack, We Bought A Zoo. Last year, Jonsi was asked to compose a number of tracks for the film by director Cameron Crowe.\n\nFollowing Jonsi, listen to new music from indie folk pop band The Lower 48; a live cut from Josh Ritter‘s first live album; the newest from another singer-songwriter, Kurt Von Stetten; a double-shot of lo-fi indie psych pop from Graham Repulski; a cover song of The Smiths from Telekinesis; punk rock from the band The 65’s; and a new track by Dolfish that sounds like the band Apples in Stereo.\n\n“Gathering Stories” – Jónsi from We Bought a Zoo\n\nThe End – The Lower 48 from Where All Maps End (self-released)\n\n“Latern” (Live) – Josh Ritter from Live at the Iveagh Gardens (self-released)\n\n“Codify” – Kurt Von Stetten from Cyclops\n\n“Mommy’s Dreaming” – Graham Repulski from My Color is Red\n\nDouble-shot: “Everyone Likes My Three Dollar Shirt” – Graham Repulski from My Color is Red\n\n“Sheila Take A Bow” (The Smiths) – Telekinesis from Please, Please, Please: A Tribute to The Smiths\n\n“Walk On Selfishly” – The 65′s from Strike Hard!\n\n“Your Love Is Bummin’ Me Out” – Dolfish from the 7″\n\nIn Dee Mail Releases – The Coast of Nebraska, Trip Effect\n\nThe In Dee Mail mixtape series is different from the regular Best New Releases because each of the bands featured via In Dee Mail sent their music to us ‘in dee mail’ using the proper submission process. Because we get so many submissions – more than we can ever get to – the submission form is necessary to filter out submissions that do not include at least one MP3 link. That’s because we rarely ever use links to Soundcloud, file downloads, Bandcamp, etc. Since we use the Yahoo! media player to stream music on every mixtape, we can only profile an artist that supplies a MP3 link of a current song.\n\nAs one way to put a dent in the piles of music submissions we receive, we search our database for new releases that have release dates for the week in question, and if we like what we hear, we include it in this section of the weekly Best New Releases. We’ve been doing this for a while now, and the response from IRC’s regular and new visitors has been impressive.\n\nFirst up is the ironically named duo, The Coast of Nebraska, who also ironically are not even from Nebraska, but much further south – Austin, Texas. It’s no surprise to us that we receive a lot of noteworthy submissions from Austin. The Coast of Nebraska is yet another. On Saturday, the band released their new album, Hope Swallows. Their well-honed sound is a mix of indie rock, psychedelic and glam rock.\n\n“Hope Swallows” – The Coast of Nebraska from Hope Swallows\n\n“This Old Home” – The Coast of Nebraska from Hope Swallow\n\nThe Coast of Nebraska has opened for bands like The Magnificent Snails, Jay Satellite, Paperthreat, Bridge Farmers, School of Liars and include among their top influences The Beatles, Sweet, Pavement, Boz Scaggs, Super Furry Animals.\n\nTrip Effect is an unsigned band from Rockford, Illinois who deliver a mixture of raw acoustic rock and technical theory based playing. The band says their music “proves an unplugged sound can still rock out as hard as anything.\n\n“Past The Edge” – Trip Effect from Second Life\n\n“The Rain” – Trip Effect from Second Life\n\nRecent Releases We Almost Missed – Loves It!, Seventeen Evergreen\n\nThose of you who are most familiar with IRC probably know about another mega-MP3 mixtape series we run called Recent Releases We Almost Missed. The entire premise of the series is to highlight noteworthy singles (not necessarily the albums they originate on) that, for one reason or another, we did not publish in the Best New Releases mixtape for the week of their official release. It’s a way of playing catch-up.\n\nSo, we decided to start incorporating it into the Best New Releases mixtapes as long as the songs were released within the past month – everything earlier than that will be saved and profiled in the next edition of Recent Releases We Almost Missed. In fact, we’re working on a huge RRWAM right now, the last to be published in 2011. But for now, here are some tracks from recent releases that we thought we’d share with you to see what your response is.\n\n“Bobby Kennedy” – Loves It! from Yay – Dec. 6th\n\nDouble-shot: Two Sides” – Loves It! from Yay – Dec. 6th\n\n“Angels” – Seventeen Evergreen from Psyentist – Dec. 6th\n\nWe initially thought that last week’s Best New Releases was thin on new albums. But now we’re going to have to eat our words. This week is thin on new releases, really thin. This is probably the shortest BNR posting this year, and for those of you who check out the BNR posts each week, you’re sure to notice.\n\nIn a way it’s good for us that this is a slow week for releases because we’re working on a new edition of Fresh Tracks, but more importantly, on volumes IV and V of Best Songs of 2011 mixtape series – which so far has been crazy popular.\n\nAs for new releases, our top pick of the week goes to the self-released EP, Paint The Town, from the band David Newton & Thee Mighty Angels. The quartet consists of The Mighty Lemon Drops‘ band member David Newton, plus musicians Daniel Harshman and Joel Wall of Kissing Tigers, and Brian Reyes of The Little Ones. The southern California band musical project has been building a quiet following in the LA-Long Beach area for a couple of years now. We haven’t heard the EP yet, but plan to soon. Based on the title track, it wouldn’t be a big surprise if the EP ended up on our Best Debut EPs of 2011 list.\n\n“Paint the Town” – David Newton & Thee Mighty Angels from Paint The Town EP\n\nAdditionally, there are a number of reissues and compilations out this week, including reissues of Smashing Pumpkins‘ first two albums – Gish and Siamese Dream, featuring bonus material that includes rare and previously unreleased recordings, plus each re-issue contains a DVD featuring never-before-released live shows recorded at the Metro in Chicago.\n\n“Cherub Rock” – Smashing Pumpkins from Siamese Dream\n\nAdditionally, Gorillaz‘ singles collection (stream it on Spinner) was released this week featuring a decade of the band’s top tracks. Check out the trailer promo for the singles collection above.\n\n“Feel Good Inc.” – Gorillaz from The Singles Collection: 2001-2011\n\nThey Might Be Giants released a new video this week featuring the fresh electronic version of their most well-known hit single, “Istanbul (Constantinoble).” The video is trippy and reminds us a bit of Animal Collective‘s “My Girls,” but, in the end, we prefer the original version of the song a hundred times more. Still, the video is a must-see for die-hard fans of the band’s 30-year career.\n\nThe next batch of songs from albums released this week are likely to only be found on IRC, including relatively unknown and DIY artists like My Empire of Sound, Jaybee, Moe’s Implosion, Desmond Grundy, San Serif, and Cuban Cigar Crisis.\n\nFrom Sweden and Denmark, the electronica pop band My Empire Of Sound released their self-titled debut album earlier this week. The band is John Alexander Ericson´s (The Northern Territories, Stjarna, Alberta Cross) latest music project, with Sidsel Marie on vocals. The album was released by the indie label, Warsaw Recordings. My Empire of Sound’s most influential artists include Portishead, Fever Ray, PJ Harvey, and The Knife.\n\n“Early Morning (A New Beginning)” – The Empire Of Sound from The Empire Of Sound\n\nJaybeemusic, the musical moniker of Brighton, UK musician James Bennett writes and produces quirky, original songs, covering themes such as angels, vampires, cowboys and pussy cats in what he refers to as a “vaguely pop idiom, all brewed in a studio-formerly-known-as-garage, from equal parts technology and inspiration.”\n\n“Found on Putney Bridge” – Jaybee from Found on Putney Bridge\n\n“Jump You Bastard” – Jaybee from Found on Putney Bridge\n\nMoe’s Implosion, a five-piece rock band from Portugal, released their debut album this week, Light Pollution. The band got a lot of love in 2009 and on in Spain and Portugal thanks to their acclaimed debut. The band toured extensively throughout the region, including slots at the Avante Music Festival and Musa Festival, and opened for artists like Asian Dub Foundation, The Get Up Kids, and Linda Martini.\n\n“FM” – Moe’s Implosion from Light Pollution\n\n“Doctor” – Moe’s Implosion from Light Pollution\n\nIt’s been a while since there’s been a band from the northeastern city of Halifax, Nova Scotia in Canada, that has appeared on our pages, but the folk pop of Sans Serif has earned the band some accolades, mostly on Canadian blogs, plus gigs opening for artists like Rich Aucoin and Cousins. On Saturday, they released their new album, I’m Not in Love (I’m in Dartmouth). We think the band has promise, if you like folk pop, but we’d suggest they work with a really good producer and engineer who can hone the band’s sound. The tracks the band sent us are worth the listen, but whether or not they end up in your MP3 player is a different matter.\n\n“Smoke Detectors” – Sans Serif from I’m Not in Love (I’m in Dartmouth)\n\n“Let’s All Redistribute Wealth” – Sans Serif from I’m Not in Love (I’m in Dartmouth)\n\nThe San Francisco DIY band Cuban Cigar Crisis also released a new album this week, titled Sourpuss. We don’t know much about the band at all, but we thought the two tracks they sent in are worth including in this post. We do know that they once opened for Xiu Xiu. It’s tough for bands to get attention in a city like San Francisco, but these are not amateurs.\n\n“Love Between The Sheets” – Cuban Cigar Crisis from Sourpuss\n\n“Wuthering Heights” – Cuban Cigar Crisis from Sourpuss\n\nCanadian DIY indie singer/songwriter Desmond Grundy sent in a couple of songs from his new album. Songs like “Took A Bus” make it easy to see why he considers among his top influences Iggy Pop, Lou Reed, Brian Eno and one of rock’s most iconic brother bands – Ray and Dave Davies of The Kinks. Grundy has performing shows in Toronto and the outlying areas of the city for more than a decade, and describes it as such: “My show is a combination of gritty, toe-tapping favorites and melodic, fearless originals delivered with spirit and taste.”\n\n“Took A Bus” – Desmond Grundy from Tiles from the Amber Room\n\n“Black Fly” – Desmond Grundy from Tiles from the Amber Room\n\nNot surprisingly, it is a thin week for new releases. Many record companies hold off on releasing albums during the week of Thanksgiving because it’s so much more difficult to get the attention of media and music consumers due to the holidays. That said, there are a few albums out this week that we highly recommend, including the new debut LPs from Sunbears and Sea Lions.\n\nSince 2008, Jacksonville, Florida musicians Jonathan Berlin (vocals, bass, guitar, keys, synth) and Jared Bowser (drums, percussion) of Sunbears have been wooing and wowing audiences with their own brand of psychedelic indie rock. To date, the band has released a handful of EPs and singles, including a song for the hit kids’ TV show, Yo Gabba Gabba, followed by a short stint on their Super Music Friends Show tour in the fall of 2010. In addition, Sunbears have also toured with Mates of State, Black Kids and Dredg, among others.\n\nRecorded at New York City’s Singing Serpent Studios with producer Jeremy S.H. Griffith, You Will Live Forever channels the ghost of The Dakota, conjuring equal parts Plastic Ono Band, Dark Side Of The Moon and Quadrophenia. On “Dying Alone, Without Yourself,” electronic creations are intricately layered upon a gorgeously strummed acoustic guitar, accompanied by haunting choral back-ups. “Give Love A Try” is the album’s infectious “feel good” first single, and in our opinion, one of the best indie songs of the second half of 2011.\n\n“Give Love a Try” – Sunbears from You Will Live Forever\n\nThe album is full of songs that explore all kinds of musical styles and themes, and at times you swear you were hearing different artists you already know being channeled through the incredibly talented duo. Sunbears is a band we will be watching in 2012. There are many fantastic songs this year that we’ve heard from relatively unknown artists and band. Sunbears now occupies two or three, maybe more, of those slots, thanks to what is also one of the best debut albums of 2011, You Will Live Forever.\n\nStream the album via Spinner\n\nWe’re not going to list all of the songs from the album, but a couple more to add include The Flaming Lips-sounding, “They Think They Are Sooo Philosophical,” and the sorta John Lennon like, “Together Forever.”\n\n“They Think They Are Sooo Philosophical” – Sunbears from You Will Live Forever\n\nYou Will Live Forever is a colorful, psychedelic sonic journey through various musical landscapes, marked by introspective, superbly written, amazingly arranged, and wonderfully produced songs that leave the listener with the sense that they just experienced something special. If you dig these three tracks – and it was a challenge to pick only three – then you’re probably going to really enjoy the album.\n\nHaving somehow just made it through the appalling 2011 American Music Awards when we first listened to You Will Live Forever, it was so refreshing to hear original, dynamic music created by talented musicians almost no one has ever heard of. If all the right pieces fall into place in the next few months, Sunbears could be one of the biggest indie bands of 2012.\n\nThe long-awaited debut album from the post punk/60’s pop Oxnard, California indie quartet, Sea Lions, officially dropped this week, and is being welcomed with a decent number of encouraging reviews. AbsolutePunk gave the album a 7-star rating, stating, “Despite the occasional flat execution, Sea Lions’ knack for constructing timeless melodies is undeniable, and the golden oldies era is obviously a pervading influence on the album.” There is no doubt about that, from the vintage pop of “I Don’t Wanna Go Out” to the C-86 guitar jangling of the album opener, “I Should Be Sleeping,” this debut album is a formidable release, and definitely among the top indie pop – if we were to pick one genre to describe it – debut albums of 2011.\n\n“I Should Be Sleeping” – Sea Lions from Everything You Always Wanted To Know About Sea Lions But Were Afraid To Ask\n\nIf you’re a sucker for golden oldies, the C-86 post punk movement of the 1980’s, and jangly guitar pop, you will probably enjoy Everything You Always Wanted To Know About Sea Lions But Were Afraid To Ask from start to finish (with a couple of small exceptions). We certainly have.\n\nThat said, none of the 15 tracks are over three minutes long, and the problem with that is that it makes it harder for the songs to stick in your head afterwards; in fact, there are many terrific songs, unfortunately, on this album that, just as you’re getting into them, end too soon.\n\n“Grown Up” – Sea Lions from Everything You Always Wanted To Know About Sea Lions But Were Afraid To Ask\n\n“As Times Change” – Sea Lions from Everything You Always Wanted To Know About Sea Lions But Were Afraid To Ask\n\nThis next cluster of great tracks from new albums out this week is really an excellent collection of songs that really exemplifies the talent of all of these artists who have very different musical styles, from country rock to punk rock, and electro-pop to hard rock.\n\nEddy Current Suppression Ring belts out some raw garage punk rock – somewhat reminiscent of early Arctic Monkeys meets Beastie Boys – on the single “You Don’t Care”; Trentemøller delivers a slow, haunting, semi-industrial track with “Neverglade”; Wooden Wand and the Briarwood Virgins slug through a 70’s style country rock song, “Big Mouth U.S.A.,” that would be perfect on the soundtrack of a road trip movie or an Almost Famous 2; Fonda‘s “Better Days” is a charged, guitar buzzing track from the just-released EP, Better Days; and Toronto house mavens Azari & III‘s new dance single, “Into the Night,” was officially released this week.\n\n“I Don’t Wanna Go to the Party” – Marvelous Darlings from Single Life\n\n“You Don’t Care” – Eddy Current Suppression Ring from So Many Things\n\n“Better Days” – Fonda from Better Days EP\n\n“Neverglade” – Trentemøller from Reworked/Remixed\n\n“Big Mouth U.S.A.” – Wooden Wand and the Briarwood Virgins from Briarwood\n\n“Into The Night” – Azari & III from single\n\nCalexico’s Road Atlas, The Antlers Cover The xx, Orange Juice in a Box, Giant Sand Reissue\n\nOther releases this week include some singles, box-sets and re-issues. First, The Antlers released their (together) EP, featuring a cover of The xx‘s track “VCR”; one of our favorite alt. country rock bands, Calexico, released their compilation, Selections from Road Atlas, 1998-2011; the band Giant Sand reissued an expanded version of its 2000 alternative country rock album, Chore of Enchantment; the indie pop rock pioneers Orange Juice officially released their Coals to Newcastle box set this week.\n\n“VCR” (The xx) – The Antlers from (together) EP\n\n“Glowing Heart of the World” – Calexico from Selections from Road Atlas, 1998-2011 (stream album)\n\n“Music Arcade” – Giant Sand from Chore Of Enchantment (expanded reissue)\n\n“Rip It Up” – Orange Juice from Coals to Newcastle\n\nWay Back Now: Magazine Releases First LP in 30 Years, No Thyself\n\nThe Way Back Now segment is a new addition to the Best New Releases series that highlights bands who have released their first album in more than a decade. In the case of the Manchester, England post-punk gods Magazine, the release this week of their fifth album, No Thyself, might not be as big of a deal if it wasn’t for the fact that it marks the band’s first album in 30 years – since 1981’s fairly disappointing, Magic, Murder and The Weather, which lacked the departed John McGeoch.\n\n“Holy Dotage” – Magazine from No Thyself\n\nLast year, Howard Devoto, who started out with Buzzcocks before he founded Magazine in 1977, dialed up guitarist Noko and bassist John “Stan” White (who replaced the unavailable Barry Adamson) to make another Magazine. What No Thyself proves is that the band have not lost their edge after such a long hiatus, that they are more talented than ever before, and Devoto still has great vocals that sound as good or better than they did three decades ago. A few of the standout tracks include the dark rock grind of “The Burden of a Song,” the urgent, synth rocking post punk of “Holy Dotage” and the unusually uptempo and catchy, “Physics.”\n\n“Physics” – Magazine from No Thyself\n\nNew Releases from In Dee Mail: Wait For Green, Fires in France,\n\nWe receive literally hundreds of music submissions a month, and it’s near impossible to keep up with them all. One way to make it easier to manage is that we started highlighting new releases we receive via our submission form for the week in which the album, EP or singles are officially released.\n\nWe don’t receive much indie music from Boise, Idaho, but this week the unsigned indie band from Boise, Fires In France, released their self-titled, debut album and sent along these two tracks to post. Their sound is big, shimmering, more pop than rock, and we think, promising. Perhaps Fires in France’s overall sound is a bit more leaning to the side of polished Hollywood rock radio, but we’re confident some of you will find it worthy of downloading to your MP3 player.\n\nAmong the bands they list as their biggest influences include Jimmy Eat World, The Beatles, The Smiths, Awolnation, Neon Trees, The Format, Coldplay, Nirvana, and Edward Sharp.\n\n“Love Is Strong” – Fires In France from Fires in France\n\n“Sing” – Fires In France from Fires in France\n\nAlso, in the past week, on Nov. 16th, the unsigned Austin indie pop/alternative rock band Empire Machines released their self-titled EP, which arrives two year after the band first formed. Now, we say it all of the time, but to be an unsigned indie band in places like Austin, or Brooklyn, or San Francisco, or Portland, is quite the challenge these days.\n\nIn order to stand out among the thousands of DIY artists and bands in cities where the competition among bands is fierce, bands need to come up with one or two hot singles that get people’s attention, not just with deejays and music consumers, but also with their peers – who are often times simultaneously rooting for, and against them – artists need to make a splash.\n\nWe are a little surprised that Empire Machines have not played live in Austin. In fact, they consider themselves a studio band, but we think it would be a good idea if they got some gigs.\n\n“Never Enough” – Empire Machines from Empire Machines EP\n\n“Sweet Teeth” – Empire Machines from Empire Machines EP\n\nWait For Green is a Go For Broke Records’ indie band out of Venice, California that sent in some tracks from their self-titled debut release, but failed to provide us any details about who they are other than to describe their music style as alternative, funk, pop, reggae, and hiphop.\n\n“Let The Record Play” – Wait For Green from Wait For Green\n\n“Slow Riding” – Wait For Green from Wait For Green\n\nThis week’s Best New Releases includes a bounty of new singles from bands we never heard of before, but are so glad we have. First, we start off with the most obvious lead singles from new albums by Crystal Stilts and Los Campesinos. Although Crystal Stilts released their CD and MP3 version of their new EP, Radiant Door, last week, this week marks the release of their vinyl EP release. Plus, we have an additional track – the title track – from the EP that we didn’t feature last week.\n\n“Radiant Door” – Crystal Stilts from Radiant Door EP\n\n“Dark Eyes” – Crystal Stilts from Radiant Door EP\n\nOther top tracks from new albums include the incredibly enthusiastic popper, “School Glue,” from Pterodactyl, the equally upbeat bliss of Carter Tanton‘s “Horrorscope,” and the riveting Races‘ track, “Big Broom.” While those five tracks make a sah-weet mini-mix of this week’s best new releases all by themselves, there are other releases highlighted in today’s mix that we think you’ll enjoy as much as we have.\n\n“By Your Hand” – Los Campesinos! from Hello Sadness\n\n“Horrorscope” – Carter Tanton from Freeclouds\n\n“School Glue” – Pterodactyl from Spills Out\n\n“Big Broom” – Races from Big Broom EP\n\nNew Albums from Sigur Ros, The Do, Ex-Norweigan, Blackout Beach and Ice Choir\n\nThis week Sigur Ros‘ new live album, Inni, was released. The live album is more than just a collection of great Sigur Ros songs from live shows, it’s also a movie (see trailer below). The 105-minute double live album is also a 75-minute film that captures the band’s tour from three years ago, in November 2008. Fans can get a special deal on purchasing the album and the film via iTunes (buy now).\n\n“Ný Batterí “ – Sigur Ros from Inni\n\nThe new live album and film are a follow-up to the band’s 2007 live film, Heima (watch the film in HD here), which was filmed in the band’s home country of Iceland.The film was directed over two nights at the Alexandra Palace director Vincent Morisset, best known for directing Arcade Fire‘s Miroir Noir. The double LP features 15 tracks, with songs taken from all five of Sigur Rós’ studio albums, plus there is also a bonus of an unreleased studio track of “Lúppulagið’.” Also, check out fresh tracks from new releases by The Do, Ex-Norweigan, Blackout Beach, and Ice Choir.\n\n“Slippery Slope” – The Dø from Both Ways Open Jaws\n\n“Be Forewarned, The Night has Come “ – Blackout Beach from Fuck Death\n\n“Upper Hand” – Ex Norwegian from Sketch (self-released)\n\n“Two Rings” – Ice Choir from Two Rings\n\nBoston’s DIY Artist Matty Sorono and Austin Band Whalers\n\nNow, let’s turn to DIY and unsigned bands we like a lot who released new albums in the past week. Of all the unsigned, DIY artists that we never heard of before with new releases out this week, perhaps our favorite is Boston musician Matty Sorono. While he did not provide us very much information at all, what we do know is that Sorono started recording his own material about three years ago. By that time, he already had more than a decade of piano playing to draw from.\n\n“All my songs start out on an acoustic piano,” Sorono told IRC. “I begin by brainstorming melodic, harmonic or rhythmic ideas around until I find something substantial. Then i start coming up with vocal ideas to fit over the top. Usually I have a rough idea of at least some part of the melody before I step back from the keyboard and really work out some lyrics. I like lyrics that are fun to say and pleasing to listen to. When it comes time to produce the song, I strive to create a unified track with musical direction by layering sounds that add depth to the sound.”\n\nNo doubt when you listen to the two singles released on Saturday, November 12, that Sorono’s music is influenced by his mentors The Beatles, The Beach Boys and Animal Collective. If you’re still loving the hazy, lo-fi, “chillwave” sound, than Sorono may be one of the latest artists to earn a place on that list, perhaps even more. We shall see.\n\n“Sunside Trails” – Matty Sorono from single release\n\n“Skydream” – Matty Sorono from single release\n\nSorono is also a member of the Boston band Fork, which will release their debut EP, Fenway Winds, on December 8th. Here’s an advanced track:\n\n“I See You” – Fork from Fenway Winds\n\nBefore we get back to the other previously unknown In Dee Mail releases, we first want to present Austin’s under-rated indie band Whalers, who dropped their second EP, Paddle Easy. Among the best songs on the album are “Cheat On Each Other,” an infectious ode to surf rock from the landlocked Texans, and “Pixel Your Picture,” a perfectly poplicious track that should be an ‘indie hit’ song, and reminds us of The Walkmen. While it was difficult to pick which songs to present from the newest EP – because there are so many great tracks – we’re also including the melodic, dreamy duet, “Lighthouse,” featuring Whaler’s lead singer, Kyle Rother, together with White Dress vocalist Arum Rae Valkonen.\n\nOf all the artists in this In Dee Mail feature, the Whalers are the best known. In fact, even though they’ve only been together for two years, they have a loyal and growing fan base in Austin, and increasingly, around the nation, with profile spots on Daytrotter and Rollo Grady “Artist to Watch.” The band’s debut EP, How The Ship Goes Down, was mixed by My Morning Jacket’s sound engineer, Kevin Ratterman, and mastered at Jim Eno’s (Spoon) Austin studio, Public Hi-Fi.\n\n“Pixel Your Picture” – Whalers from Paddle Easy\n\nDouble-shot: “Cheat On Each Other” – Whalers from Paddle Easy\n\nBonus Track: “Lighthouse” – Whalers from Paddle Easy\n\nAnother artist that dropped a new release on 11-11-11 is the unsigned electro-pop/new wave band, The New Division, from Riverside, California. Their new album, The Rookie, demonstrates the band’s admiration for groups like New Order and Depeche Mode, and more recently, Cut Copy. The New Division have received some note-worthy press, but they still have yet to get the recognition we think they deserve. See what you think of these two synth-laden tracks from The Rookie, “Starfield” and “Festival.”\n\n“Starfield” – The New Division from The Rookie\n\n“Festival” – The New Division from The Rookie\n\nNarrow Sparrow, Caveman, Churches, Korallreven and Others\n\nWe have even more impressive lead tracks from other artists with new albums and EPs out this week, including Caveman, Annie Williams, Churches, Korallreven, as well as lesser tracks by Rah Rah and Poor Boy’s Soul. The track “Shenandoah,” is a very tranquil, but not new age, instrumental that simply paints a picture of a serene and beautiful place within the natural world. A perfect close to this week’s top releases. But first up, is the catchy, acoustic-electro pop track “Joe Meek’s Dream” from Narrow Sparrow‘s DIY album, Synthworks.\n\n“Joe Meek’s Dream” – Narrow Sparrow from Synthworks (self-released)\n\n“Thankful” – Caveman from CoCo Beware\n\n“Roll on Hills” – Annie Williams from This Mountain EP (self-released)\n\n“Save Me” – Churches from “Save Me” single (self-released)\n\n“Sa Sa Samoa (ft Julianna Barwick)” – Korallreven from An Album By Korallreven\n\n“Parkade” – Rah Rah from Breaking Hearts\n\n“Burn Down” – Poor Boy’s Soul from Poor Boy’s Soul\n\n“Shenandoah” – Goldmund from All Will Prosper\n\nIn Dee Mail Releases This Week: Big Lake, Sissy Menai, Gene Wildest and Noel Carlon\n\nOne of the longest running playlist series on IRC, In Dee Mail, highlights only artists and bands that send us their new releases directly. Thankfully, it has also been one of the most popular playlist series, probably because the songs we choose for the In Dee Mail mixes are from DIY and unsigned artists. Lately, we’ve been calling out new releases that In Dee Mail by creating a separate section in the weekly Best New Releases.\n\nIt’s a great feeling to know that over the years, we’ve helped to launch relatively unknown artists into the spotlight, with some even telling us that IRC was their first big break. But the credit there really goes to our readers/listeners, because it is all of you who ultimately drive what music makes it onto the site, and more importantly, what music becomes the most popular. This is evident by the weekly Top Ten Songs mixtapes (based on number of listens/downloads a song gets), and more recently, the Best Songs of 2011 mixtape series.\n\nBig Lake is an indie/shoegaze band from Jersey City, New Jersey, led by New York City musician Lysa Opfer. The band’s debut EP, Do You Love Me? Yes/No?, officially dropped this week via Evil Island Fortress Records. Opfer sent us a couple of tracks from the EP to share with IRC. Just some of the many bands that Big Lake are influenced by include Broken Social Scene, Local Natives, Album Leaf, Maps, Arcade Fire, Battles, Beach House, My Bloody Valentine, The Ramones, Joy Division and The Walkmen.\n\n“Homecoming Game” – Big Lake from Do You Love Me? Yes/No\n\n“The Longest Day” – Big Lake from Do You Love Me? Yes/No\n\nSissy Menai is a three-piece DIY Chicago-based indie rock/shoegaze band who, like many of the In Dee Mail artists, have never opened for another band (yet), but we think show some promise thanks to their engaging and explosively driven songs, like “Soon Speeding Gear,” and the more pop-oriented title track from their new debut LP, Record Machine. Their 2009 EP, Young Girl, received some positive press from Chicago bloggers and sites like Timeout Chicago, as well as outside of Chicago, including a thumbs up in the popular blog, The Onion.\n\n“Soon Speeding Gear” – Sissy Menai from Record Machine\n\n“Record Machine” – Sissy Menai from Record Machine\n\nGene Wildest is an unsigned Philadelphia band headed by songwriter and musician Brian Corbett, who were recently profiled in The Signal and Philadelphia Weekly, among other write ups. In fact, the band has previously opened for Titus Andronicus, Guerilla Funk, Human Sounds, and Axis. Gene Wildest recorded all the tracks from the new album, self-titled debut LP in Corbett’s apartment.\n\nThe first track we received is the Ben Folds-sounding piano-dominant track, “George Carillo,” followed by the quirky track, “Weird Guy at a Bar in Bethlehem, PA.” The band’s biggest influences include Red Hot Chili Peppers, Parliament Funkadelic, Electric Six, Pearl Jam, and The Smiths.\n\n“George Carillo” – Gene Wildest from Gene Wildest\n\n“Weird Guy at a Bar in Bethlehem, PA” – Gene Wildest from Gene Wildest\n\nAfter a year and a half in the making, Los Angeles singer/songwriter Noel Carlon completed and released his debut album, Lonely Stranger. Carlon’s songs weave tales of despair, broken dreams, longing, love, and loneliness. It is a heartfelt debut told through the words of a working man in a city where hopes and dreams rarely come to fruition.\n\n“Insecure” – Noel Carlon from Lonely Stranger\n\n“Dreams are Cruel” – Noel Carlon from Lonely Stranger\n\nNoel Carlon is the former lead singer of Delarosa and Noel Carlon and the Dead Poets. New band mates include fellow friends Joel Herr (guitars, backup vox), Joseph Yabao (Drums), Nikko Menichini (guitars), and Rosco Bustillo (Keys, Backup Vox).\n\nThis playlist mix features 50 singles from Recent Releases We Almost Missed. We think you’ll really enjoy this mix, especially if you stream it once all the way through from start to finish – there are some fantastic songs in this mix that are barely known at all.\n\nThere’s no shortage of wonderful music that we want to share with you that otherwise would have slipped through the cracks created by the constant movement of mountains of music that build up throughout the year.\n\nIf you’re not familiar with this particular series, we definitely encourage you to browse the playlist series, Recent Releases We Almost Missed – a lot of people say they discover some great music that they otherwise would have never heard through this series, and we’re totally down with that because that’s why we carefully pick, and post, the songs we do.\n\nIn the end, it’s usually a win-win-win, and those are rare in this life; so, we’ll take one of those combos wherever we can get ’em.\n\nThis RRWAM mixtape series was born out of necessity. Last year, we needed a functional way to present standout lead tracks from albums that we did not know about until after they were released, or in some cases, that we just missed posting during the week of their official release.\n\nFurthermore, we’re sometimes using the world “recent” pretty loosely – but the one constant is that the songs chosen are good enough to post to 20,000 visitors a day. This is one of our favorite playlist mixes because we get to listen more closely to the tracks featured in each RRWAM special mixtape.\n\nThe popular Recent Releases We Almost Missed, or RRWAM (Rah-Wam), series has been chugging along since its debut in 2010, and was one of the most listened to, and downloaded, series of all, along with Top Ten Songs, Best New Releases, Fresh Tracks, In Dee Mail and others.\n\nThe fact that we initially missed Holiday Shores‘ newest album when it was released on September 13th is just inexusable, but that’s what this mixtape series is for – to make amends for notable singles and albums that we missed when they were originally released. It’s interesting to us that Holiday Shores did not hit it as big in 2010 as so many other new indie bands did, even though HS was getting plenty of blogger buzz, and even mainstream music press.\n\nSomehow, there were just too many other great, emerging bands to compete with in 2010. Oddly, the band have not achieved much more recognition in 2011, especially with the fresh release of New Masses for Squaw Peak. But then again, we didn’t help by missing the original release date. Nonetheless, the two singles featured below are perfect tracks to represent the band’s sophomore album release.\n\n“Spells” – Holiday Shores from New Masses For Squaw Peak – Sept. 13th\n\n“Threepeat Got Old” – Holiday Shores from New Masses For Squaw – Sept. 13th\n\nBoats – Cannonballs, Cannonballs\n\nIndie quirk pop band, Boats, released their latest album, Cannonballs, Cannonballs, in August, and we definitely missed it for that week’s (August 16th) Best New Releases mix.\n\nThe track “TV Scientist” is one of the best song of the second half of 2011. If you dig the track, then you’ll probably want to get your hands on the album too. Friska Viljor’s rarely heard track, “What You Gonna Do?” is incredibly catchy and upbeat. Plus, check out new singles from recent releases by Chris Letcher, The Asteroid Shop, Alpine White, and the brilliant acoustic guitar instrumental from Glenn Jones.\n\n“T.V. Scientist” – Boats from Cannonballs, Cannonballs – Aug. 16th\n\n“What You Gonna Do?” – Friska Viljor from The Beginning of the Beginning of the End – March 21st\n\n“People Beat” – Dead Western Plains from Compilation for Victims of the Tuscon Tragedy – Oct. 18th\n\n“Dandelion” – The Asteroid Shop from The Asteroid Shop – Oct. 4th\n\n“When She Gets Home” – Alpine White from The Hale EP – Nov. 1st\n\n“Of It’s Own Kind” – Glenn Jones from The Wanting – Sept. 13th\n\nBluejuice is an interesting collaboration among producers, engineers and mix specialists who have worked with bands like Weezer, New Order, The Kooks and Muse. The collaboration, which is officially named The Bluejuice Consortium, asked music lovers want they wanted most from an album. The answers ranged from ‘angst’ to ‘melody’ and ‘dance.’\n\nThat was enough for the five R&D guys of Bluejuice to bring together producer Eric J. Dubrowsky (Weezer) and London mixologist, Adrian Bushby (Muse, Kooks, New Order), among others. All of this led to the October 28th release, Company – their third album. Here’s the first single from the album, “Cheap Trix.” Another track that we don’t want you to miss is the new single from Caged Animals, “Teflon Heart.”\n\nWe really like it because it’s a bit different, with its kind of Cars mixed with the Killers [or insert your own ‘sounds like’ description here] sound and style. Plus, take a trip back in time with the raw, doo-wop styling of Shimmering Stars’ “I’m Gonna Try” from their recent album Violent Hearts. You can bet that we have put The Daredevil Christopher Wright band on our radar thanks to the brilliant track included below, “The Animal of Choice” from their self-released EP, The Longsuffering Song.\n\n“Cheap Trix” – Bluejuice Consortium from Company – Oct. 28th\n\n“Teflon Heart” – Caged Animals from Eat Their Own\n\n“I’m Gonna Try” – Shimmering Stars from Violent Hearts\n\nThis next band, Bear Lake, we didn’t really miss. In fact, we featured them in this week’s Best New Releases. But since we love their DIY, self-released album, If You Were Me, so much, and just got our hands on a third single, we had to include it. If you like the two tracks published earlier this week, plus the third track below, than you’ll want to get what is becoming one of our favorite DIY albums of 2011. Oh yeah, as if we needed another band with an animal in their name – what is this fascination musicians have with naming themselves as animals? Taking theories, if you have one.\n\n“Breaking Me Down” – Bear Lake from If You Were Me\n\nOne of the top breakout indie bands of 2010, Best Coast, released a not-so-widely heard single, “Gone Again,” in June. The track was the band’s contributions to this summer’s Adult Swim Singles Series. Also, while we’re on the subject, of Adult Swim, download its free electronica sampler, Unclassified. A perfect follow-up to “Gone Again,” is the latest single from The Morning Clouds, the dreamy “A Walk Home” from their new EP, Wasted Youth Blues.\n\n“Gone Again” – Best Coast, single from Adult Swim Singles Program 2011 – June 14th\n\n“A Walk Home” – The Morning Clouds from Wasted Youth Blues EP – Oct. 11th\n\n“Gravity Will Break Our Bones” – Gentlemen Hall from When We All Disappear – Aug. 23rd\n\nLightouts has really been gaining a following in the past year and for good reason. We originally featured Lightouts on IRC earlier this year following the release of the band’s latest album, which we like very much, and will definitely be on our Best Debuts of 2011 list. Anyways, the band recently released a new single – a double cover mix of LCD Soundsystem and David Bowie.\n\nThe rarely heard Way Yes track, “Automail,” is ridiculously upbeat and infectious – is it possible not to want to get up and shake it up listening to this world beat classic (at least as far as the world music we’ve heard in 2011)? Don’t think so. Plus, equally terrific tracks from Best Coast, The Ettes, and Little Gold.\n\n“All I Want/Heroes” (LCD Soundsystem/David Bowie) – Lightouts from The Eloise Suite Aug. 23rd\n\n“Automail” – Way Yes from Oranjudio – Aug. 9th\n\n“Bodies Coasting” – Chappo from Plastique Universe II: Pisces Princess – Aug. 15th\n\n“Sisters and Friends” – Little Gold from Weird Freedom – Aug. 23rd\n\nIt’s always cool to hear something totally different, daring and just plain ole whacky. Our award for the coolest cinematic music we’ve heard in a while goes to Elephant Goes West, a Woodridge, New Jersey indie rock band that obviously doesn’t take itself too seriously.\n\nPlus, Sleeping in the Aviary, Tennis System, The Handcuffs. Also, Ki:Theory (a.k.a. Joel Burleson), recording artist and producer, walks the tightrope between electronic and indie/alternative rock, and is best known for his remixes for Daft Punk, Queens of the Stone Age, Ladytron, and Brazilian Girls.\n\n“Holiday Heart” – Ki:Theory\n\n“Talking Out of Turn” – Sleeping in the Aviary from You and Me – Sept. 6th\n\n“Baby, I Love You” – The Handcuffs from Waiting for the Robot – Sept. 8th\n\nThe following is another release that we didn’t necessarily miss when it came out, but which we have had more time now to listen to. The band Priory released their debut, self-titled album on June 21st, pretty much under the radar, in comparison to their talent. Still, the band has received a healthy dose of blogger buzz in recent months that any aspiring artist would be slap-happy to get in today’s saturated world of music.\n\n“Kings of Troy” – Priory from Priory – June 21st\n\nWhile all of the singles – and usually the albums they came off of as well – featured in RRWAM mixtapes are carefully picked because they should not be missed, sometimes there are others that should have never been absent from the Best New Releases for the week they were released. Such is the case with the latest release from the band Pomegranates, In Your Face Thieves/Chestnut Attic.\n\nThe first track, “Softness,” is somewhat name appropriate – because it’s a soft, sort of dreamy, song with a bit of a tempo, somewhat nasally vocals, and definitely one of the few stand out tracks on the album. The melancholy, “Morrocco Girl,” is a stripped down, no frills folk song with just an acoustic guitar and mellow lead vocals. The song’s central contrast – the semi-50’s style choruses – is what also helps the song sound more full.\n\n“Softness” – Pomegranates from In Your Face Thieves/Chestnut Attic\n\n“Morroco Girl” – Pomegranates from In Your Face Thieves/Chestnut Attic\n\nSteel Phantoms infectiously upbeat “Bedouin” was the obvious lead track from their July EP release, Forer, and Hussy delivers the raw, imperfect contrast to Steel Phantoms with the gritty garage rocker “Sexi Ladi.”\n\n“Bedouin” – Steel Phantoms from Forer EP – July 29th\n\n“Sexi Ladi” – Hussy from Sexi Ladi – May 3rd\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dRB9ycB63w\n\nShifting gears once again, listen to The Duke and The King‘s interesting mix of R&B, soul and even alternative country sensibilities on “Shine On You,” from the August release of the band’s self-titled debut LP. Next, Detroit garage rock band Almost Free add even more eclectic flavor to this mix with their alternative, semi-goth rock of “Don’t Bother Me Now,” followed by the thumping bass line and layered harmonies of Hooray For Earth‘s “No Love,” the band’s first single off their newest LP, True Loves. HFE has been on our radar since breaking out with their wonderful 2006 debut; it’s almost hard to believe it took that long to get an LP out.\n\n“Shine on You” – The Duke & The King from The Duke & The King – August 16th\n\n“Don’t Bother Me Now (Adultescent)” – Almost Free from In/Out – June 7th\n\n“Big” – Parentz from BigSept. 6th\n\n“No Love” – Hooray For Earth from True Loves – June 17th\n\n“Drip From The Sea” – High Pop from Drip From The Sea – Sept. 20th\n\n“Parking Lot” – Jonny Lives from Revolution For Free – Sept. 27th\n\nOther tracks include the haunting alternative-goes-jazzy-goes-psychedelic from Firs of Prey, followed by the wandering ruminations of “No Worries” by Family Lumber; the semi-road tripping track, “Waiting for Saints to Arrive” by Company; the Prince-sounding, “Swear” by Inc., and other fantastic tracks by Soley, The Trews, Locksley, Metronomy, Mr. Gnome, The Reveling, and The Unsacred Hearts. And, so many other songs that speak for themselves.\n\n“What You Say” – Firs of Prey from Well, I Don’t See Why Not Vol. 3 – May 26th\n\n“No Worries” – Family Lumber from Look to the Sidelines EP – Aug. 9th\n\n“Waiting for Saints to Arrive” – Company from Holy City – May 26th\n\n“Left at Forkright” – The Reveling from Black Numbers – June 21st\n\n“Ideas to Use” – Gardens from Gardens – Aug. 15th\n\n“Swear” – Inc. from 3 EP – July 26th\n\n“I’ll Drown” – Soley from We Sink – Sept. 2nd\n\n“Bit the Tongue” – Mr. Gnome from Madness in Miniature – Oct. 25th\n\n“Flesh and Bone” – The Unsacred Hearts from The Honor Bar – July 8th\n\nDeerhunter’s prolific musical genius, Bradford Cox, has been one of our favorite ‘indie’ musicians for years. In addition to his work on his mothership, that is Deerhunter, Cox has lots of other music projects and collaborations, including the most popular of them all – his solo work under the moniker Atlas Sound, a project that has turned out dozens of spectacular singles, EPs and LPs.\n\nThis week, Atlas Sound officially released Parallax, an album we are keen to hear right away. What we have heard so far sounds like another fine release from Cox. It is much more stripped down Cox, with a handful of meandering, somber tracks dominated by guitar, vocals and synths. The official lead single from the LP, “Terra Incognita” is a mellow – some might say melancholy – acoustic guitar and vocals dominated composition, and much the same with the more drifty “Te Amo.”\n\n“Terra Incognita” – Atlas Sound from Parallax\n\nDouble-shot: “Te Amo” – Atlas Sound from Parallax (via Rawkblog.net)\n\nOne for the Road: “Flagstaff” – Atlas Sound from Parallax (via Minneapolis Fuc*ing Rocks)\n\nJuno’s New Group of the Year Said The Whale\n\n2011 has been a good year for Vancouver indie folk pop band Said The Whale. In March, the band won the honorary Juno Award for New Group of the Year, and four months later Canada’s CBC premiered a tour documentary about the band’s rise to ‘indie’ fame . Today the band officially released their four-track New Brighton EP, the first offering from the band since their widely-acclaimed 2009 album, Islands Disappear. Here is the title track via the blog Consequence of Sound. Also, listen to a couple of tracks from the March 2012 LP, Little Mountain.\n\n“New Brighton” – Said The Whale from New Brighton EP\n\nBuilt Like Alaska: Band to Watch in 2012\n\nIn kind of keeping with the northern wilderness theme for a bit here, the Oakdale, California band Built Like Alaska‘s new single, “Antique Love,” from their new, and third, album, In Troubled Times, is a perfectly simple folk pop track that really exemplifies not just the musical talent of the band, but also the vocals of lead singer Neil Jackson. We have yet to hear the entire album, but what is clear to us is that 2012 could be the best year yet for Built Like Alaska, just based on the double-shot of “Antique Love” and “John Henry.” BLA are an IRC Band to Watch in 2012.\n\n“Antique Love” – Built Like Alaska from In Troubled Times\n\n“John Henry” – Built Like Alaska from In Troubled Times\n\nCrystal Stilts Drop new EP; Kurt Vile Releases Deluxe of ‘Smoke Ring’ and Summer Camp’s Latest Album\n\nWe’ve been fans of Crystal Stilts from the first couple of singles we heard a few years ago, and so we’re always happy when the band releases new material, even if it is only a EP – we’ll take it. Here’s the lead track, “Dark Eyes” from Crystal Stilts Radiant Door EP, out now on Sacred Bones. Plus, a new deluxe edition of Kurt Vile‘s recent Smoke Ring For My Halo is out this week with the lead single, “The Creature,” plus the latest song from Summer Camp‘s new LP, Welcome to Condale.\n\n“Dark Eyes” – Crystal Stilts from Radiant Door EP\n\n“The Creature” – Kurt Vile from Smoke Ring For My Halo (deluxe edition)\n\n“Better Off Without You” – Summer Camp from Welcome to Condale\n\nNew Singles from Bear & Moose, A Band of Bees, Shy Mirrors, 13Ghosts, ARMS and Dad Rocks!\n\nWell, here we go with another band name that connotes images of the life in the northwestern U.S. and Canada – Bear & Moose; plus, the title of their new single, “Wear the Wolf,” is just more wild imagery. Plus, a new single, “I Really Need You,” from A Band of Bees new album reminds us so much of Van Morrison‘s Astral Weeks period – songs that are a cross between R&B, folk and rock, and yet manage to sound so organic and free-spirited at the same time. Also, new singles from Shy Mirrors, 13Ghosts, ARMS and Dad Rocks!\n\n“Wear the Wolf” – Bear & Moose from Bear & Moose\n\nDouble-shot: “I’m Back” – Bear & Moose from Bear & Moose\n\n“I Really Need Love” – A Band of Bees from Every Step’s A Yes\n\n“Breakout” – Shy Mirrors from Sailed Blanks\n\nDouble-shot: “Track Changes” – Shy Mirrors from Sailed Blanks\n\n“Dr. Bill” – 13Ghosts from Garland of Bottle Flies\n\n“Fleeced” – ARMS from Summer Skills (self-released)\n\n“Weapons” – Dad Rocks! from Mount Modern\n\n“Sucker Punch” – Jonathan Coulton from Artificial Heart\n\n“Hexagons II (The Flight)” – Esben and the Witch from Hexagons EP\n\n“The Same Thing” – Cass McCombs from Humor Risk\n\n“No Place Like Home” – Owen from Ghost Town\n\n“Movimento Perpetuo” – Carlos Paredes from Movimento Perpetuo\n\n“Stitches”– Polinski from Labyrinths\n\n“Endless Summer” – The Jezabels from Prisoner\n\n“The Vision (Let Me Breathe)” – Joker with Jessie Ware & Freddie Gibbs from The Vision\n\n“Facing the Sun” – Treefight For Sunlight from A Collection of Vibrations For Your Skull\n\n“On Call” – Zambri from Glossolalia EP\n\n“Crazy Clown Time (download) – David Lynch from Crazy Clown Time\n\nIn Dee Mail Releases of the Week: Vanasprasta & Adam Hoffman Revival\n\nIf you listened to last week’s Best New Releases, then you know we had a lot of releases sent to us directly by artists and bands themselves. In fact, we covered more new releases from DIY bands than any other major ‘indie’ site on the web, highlighting not only the bands that get profiled on nearly every blog and music site, but many artists that get zero, or near zero, coverage by music bloggers and especially not mainstream sites like SPIN, Rolling Stone, Spinner and others.\n\nThe first band is Vanasprasta is an unsigned Silver Lake-L.A. experimental rock band released the long awaited debut album, Healthy Geometry, on Nov. 1st to much less fanfare then we think it deserves. Just for perspective, however, Vanasprasta are not exactly unknown. The band has been featured blogs such as Consequence of Sound, L.A. Weekly, and Purevolume.\n\nThey have shared the stage with artists like Free Energy, Young The Giant, Yuck, Unknown Mortal Orchestra, and Linda Perry’s Deep Dark Robot. Vanasprasta have been compared to Mars Volta, Kings of Leon, the Killers and Jeff Buckley. On Healthy Geometry, Vanaprasta have culled all of their influences, ranging from Modest Mouse to Pink Floyd, into a sound that can only be described as their own.\n\n“Nine Equals Nine” – Vanaprasta from Healthy Geometry\n\nUp next is piano-led from Sandwich, Massachusetts band, Adam Hoffman Revival, who released their new album, You’ll Get There, on Nov. 10th, featuring the lead single, “You & I.” It’s not hard to see why they include Ben Folds and The Beatles among their biggest influences. You can check out more songs and other band information at the band’s Facebook page.\n\n“You & I” – Adam Hoffman Revival from You’ll Get There – Nov. 10th\n\nAlbum Releases for the Week of Nov. 8, 2011\n\nAtlas Sound – Parallax\n\nBirdy – Birdy (U.K.)\n\nBrian Eno – Panic of Looking\n\nBrooke Fraser – Flags (Deluxe Edition CD/DVD)\n\nBuilt Like Alaska – In Troubled Times\n\nCaithlin De Marrais – Red Coats\n\nCamille Bloom – Never Out of Time\n\nCass McCombs – Humor Risk\n\nDavid Lynch – Crazy Clown Time\n\nEdward Rogers – Porcelain\n\nFay Wolf – Spiders\n\nGarrett Anderson – Within and Around (11/11)\n\nHigh Highs – Ivy (11/11)\n\nHussey-Regan – Curios (Covers) (UK)\n\nJonathan Coulton – Artificial Heart\n\nLaura Veirs – Tumble Bee/Folk Song For Children\n\nLissie – Covered Up With Flowers (Covers EP)\n\nMedeski, Scofield, Martin & Wood – In Case the World (Live)\n\nMeshell Ndegeocello – Weather\n\nNils Lofgren – Old School\n\nNoel Gallagher’s High Flying Birds – S/T (U.S.)\n\nÓlöf Arnalds – Ólöf Sings (Covers EP)\n\nOwen – Ghost Town\n\nPink Floyd – Wish You Were Here (Deluxe)\n\nRascal Flatts – Live\n\nRush – Time Machine 2011: Live in Cleveland\n\nSaid The Whale – New Brighton EP DC\n\nSigur Ros – Inni (Live CD/DVD)\n\nSummer Camp – Welcome to Condale\n\nThe Bees – Every Step’s A Yes (US)\n\nThea Gilmore – Don’t Stop Singing (Lyrics: Sandy Denny)\n\nYoung Statues – S/T\n\nIt’s so cool that volumes one and two of the Best Songs of 2011 mixtape series have been such a huge hit – literally tens of thousands of page views in just a few weeks. Today’s mixtape marks the third volume of the top 2011 songs series. If you didn’t have a chance yet, it’s definitely worth checking out Volume One (for songs released in January) and Volume Two (February).\n\nThere have already been about 70 of the best MP3 songs of 2011 posted in the first two volumes, but we think this one, Vol. III, is particularly fantastic. We urge you to listen to it all the way through, from the first song to the last. By the time you’re finished, you may agree with us that IRC regular listeners and visitors from around the world – literally millions of people – have stellar taste in music. It’s so much more special because the songs are Listener Choice; we’ve already played this entire mixtape, focusing on the top songs on IRC for the month of March 2011, three or four times in just the past week. (Read more about the process for this series at the end of this post)\n\nSo, here it is, volume three of the Best Songs of 2011, highlighting the month of March.\n\nBeady Eye Premieres; Takes No. 1 Spot\n\nIn March, the much anticipated debut album from Beady Eye was released. In case you don’t know, Beady Eye is the new band featuring former members of one of the most popular bands of the 1990′s – the Brit pop sensation Oasis. Beady Eye is comprised of former Oasis band members, Liam Gallahger, guitarist Gem Archer, and drummer, Chris Sharrock, plus Ride frontman Andy Bell. The band released their debut, Different Gear, Still Speeding on March 3rd to fairly good reviews. It’s definitely in our Top 50 albums of 2011. And, for the first week of March, the band’s lead single, “The Roller,” easily made the No. 1 spot on IRC’s weekly Top Ten Songs mixtape. The second single, “Four Letter Word,” took the No. 3 spot on the Top Ten, only outdone by the fantastic single from Papercuts, “.\n\n“The Roller” – Beady Eye from Different Gear, Still Speeding\n\n“Four Letter Word” – Beady Eye from Different Gear, Still Speeding\n\nWe’re just getting warmed up. March 2011 was a particularly good month for new music. We love the echoy vocals and pop perfection of the Papercuts‘ “Do What You Will.” We also included song No. 4 (DeVotchKa), 5 (Raised By Tigers), and 6 (Easter Island) because this set of songs flow so well together as a sah-weet mini-mix.\n\n“Do What You Will” – Papercuts from Fading Parade\n\n“100 Other Lovers” – DeVotchKa from 100 Other Lovers\n\n“Song for Bob” – Raised By Tigers from Reunion Parts\n\n“Proud” – Easter Island from Better Things\n\nAfter we were the first music site to debut the music of Los Angeles songwriter and producer Paul Bessenbacher, aka, Opus Orange, IRC readers ate up his songs, and his success started to creep its way into other crannies of the vast independent music world.\n\nSince his fantastic response from listeners on IRC in 2010, Bessenbacher continued to send us new tracks in 2011, and the listeners continued to give his songs big thumbs up.\n\n“Crystal Clear” – Opus Orange, single 2011\n\nThe next trio of tracks were the top three songs for the second week of March, according to the number of plays and downloads. Not a bad line-up of songs from Beach Fossils, Starfu*ker and Jamaica.\n\nDo you agree the order of the songs, with the Beach Fossils‘ “Calyer” coming out on top?\n\n“Calyer” – Beach Fossils from What A Pleasure\n\n“Death As A Fetish” – Starfu*ker from Reptilians\n\n“Jericho” – Jamaica from No Problem\n\nThe Dodos and The Strokes Battle For Top of Top Ten Lists\n\nFor the third week of March, it was a virtual toe-to-toe battle for the top four spots on that week’s Top Ten Songs mixtape playlist between alternative rock heavy-hitters The Strokes, and the indie rock sensation, The Dodos. And, The Dodos just eeked past the world-famous The Strokes to take the No. 1 and No. 2 spots, pushing the latter back to the No. 3 and No. 4 positions. It was our own little mini epic for the weekly Top Ten Songs list, but clearly, in the end, there were just a few more listeners who played and downloaded the new Dodos’ singles than there were for The Strokes. We only wish The Dodos’ terrific album, No Color, had a more attractive cover.\n\nSidebar – Album Cover Art in the Digital Age: Why artists, bands, and even labels, don’t put a little more imagination and consideration into so many album covers is puzzling, and even annoying, especially if you’re throwing down the $16 for the CD. Afterall, the album cover art is still an important factor, even in a time when millions of music listeners may never even see the album cover art. Still, it’s part of the gig, and why we make sure to always include album cover art in our posts, with a preference for album covers that have had some real thought put into them.\n\n“Black Night” – The Dodos from No Color (Bonus Version)\n\n“Don’t Stop” (with Neko Case) – The Dodos from No Color\n\n“Taken For A Fool” – The Strokes from Angles\n\n“Machu Picchu” – The Strokes from Angles\n\nNoah and the Whale rounded out the top 5 songs of the third week of March’s Top Ten Songs playlist with the semi-annoyingly titled “L.I.F.E.G.O.E.S.O.N.” Thankfully, the song is killer enough to forgive the band for making us type that out twice. (CAPS remain annoying.) “Life Goes On” is definitely deserving of the No. 5 spot, especially since it held its own in the mix with The Strokes and The Dodos, and other outstanding tracks from Idle Hands (“Socialite Death Square”), Generationals (“Greenleaf”), and Yuck (“Get Away”), among others.\n\n“L.I.F.E.G.O.E.S.O.N.” – Noah and the Whale from The Last Night on Earth\n\nWith the amount of terrific albums, and singles, that were advanced or released during the month of March, looking back, it’s clear that March was one of the best months for music in 2011. There were The Strokes, Beady Eye, The Dodos, Beach Fossils, and many others, and then along came new material from Thom Yorke. In fact, the second we posted Yorke’s single, “Ego,” in collaboration with Four Tet and Burial, it started getting a crazy number of plays. That made the song almost a shoe-in for the No.1 spot of the week, which is in fact what happened.\n\n“Ego” – Thom Yorke + Burial + Four Tet\n\n“Ego” beat out The Strokes for the No. 1 spot, even though it was the week of the official release of The Strokes’ much anticipated album, Angles. Yet, the most popular first advanced single from Angles, “Under Cover of Darkness,” outdid the newer, Strokes’ advanced singles (see them here) to take the No. 2 top song spot.\n\n“Under Cover of Darkness” – The Strokes from Angles\n\nAn advanced single from the anticipated May release of Cults‘ debut album featured in the Fresh Tracks mix landed the No. 3 spot, followed at No. 4 with “Mirror,” from the two-song project by Yorke, Four Tet and Burial. The Swedish indie pop band, Acid House Kings, rounded out the Top 5 with “Are We Lovers Or Are We Friends?” – one of the poppiest tracks of 2011.\n\n“You Know What I Mean” – Cults\n\n“Mirror” – Thom Yorke + Burial + Four Tet\n\n“Are We Lovers Or Are We Friends?” – Acid House Kings from Music Sounds Better with You\n\nSince March and April share one of the release weeks right down the middle, we’re actually including the top tracks for what we refer to as Week 4.5 of March 2011. It’s also very convenient because it gives us another excuse to feature Broken Bells‘ single, “Windows,” from the band’s follow-up to the splendid 2010 self-titled debut. By a huge margin, the song captured the No. 1 spot, betting No. 2 clinchers Generationals‘ “Greenleaf.” Both Broken Bells and Generationals were up against some stiff competition coming from Foster The People, who managed to score the No. 3 and No. 5 positions of the week, with two advanced singles, and Peter Bjorn and John‘s “Second Chance,” which split the difference with FTP for the No. 4 spot of the week. See the section below for the No. 6 to No. 10 tracks.\n\n“Windows” – Broken Bells from Meyrin Fields EP\n\n“Pumped Up Kicks” – Foster The People from Foster The People EP\n\n“Second Chance” – Peter Bjorn And John from Gimme Some\n\n“Helena Beat” – Foster The People from Torches – out May 24th\n\nThe Lower Half of the Top Ten – March 2011\n\nThis next batch of songs is a faster way of presenting a bunch of other top tracks from last March, mainly consisting of tracks that ranked in the lower half of each of the weekly Top Ten Songs mixes for the month. But don’t let that throw you off – there are all kinds of spectacular songs below that are easily among the Best Songs of 2011. What will be interesting is to see which of all of the songs in this post IRC listeners and visitors play and download the most in the next couple of weeks. Stay tuned; we will be posting all the results in follow-up posts around the holidays.\n\n“100 Other Lovers” – DeVotchKa from 100 Other Lovers\n\n“Song for Bob” – Raised By Tigers from Reunion Parts\n\n“Proud” – Easter Island from Better Things\n\n“Look Back, Look Up” – Codes in the Clouds from As The Spirit Wanes\n\n“Esa Nena Nunca Regreso” – Davila 666 from Tan Bajo\n\n“Breadcrumb Trail” – Buried Beds from Tremble The Sails\n\n“He Gets Me High” – Dum Dum Girls from He Gets Me High EP\n\n“Rattle Your Bones” – Black Whales from Rattle Your Bones 7″\n\n“Discoverer” – R.E.M. from Collapse Into Now\n\n“The Kite” – The Sound Of Growing Up from Drifting EP\n\n“Civilian” – Wye Oak from Civilian\n\n“Silbury Sand” – Wolf People from Silbury Sand B/W Dry\n\n“Lilly” – One In A Googolplex from Lilly/My Sister’s Poem\n\n“Bells Ring” – Empress Hotel from Empress Hotel EP\n\n“In My Time” – Kurt Vile from Smoke Ring for My Halo\n\nSongs 6-10 for Week 3, March 2011\n\n“Socialite Death Squad” – The Idle Hands from Life Is Beautiful\n\n“Greenleaf” – Generationals from Actor-Caster\n\n“Get Away” – Yuck from Yuck\n\n“Stuck on Puzzle” – Alex Turner (Arctic Monkeys) from Submarine EP\n\n“Bite of My Soul” – The Fleshtones from Brooklyn Sound Solution\n\nSongs 6-10 for Week 4, March 2011\n\nThere are so many tracks that we love from the March Top 10 mixes, but this next little set is one of the best, with Fleet Foxes’ awesome change up on “Grown Ocean” and the can’t-get-it-out-of-your-head, incredibly catchy song, “Forever in Armitron” by Boat, followed by the melancholy, “Albatross” from the Wild Beasts and A Lull’s magnificent, semi-masterpiece, “Weapons of War,” plus, the closer from Surfer Blood, “I’m Not Ready.” This right here, again, is just an amazing mini-mix all by itself.\n\n“Grown Ocean” – Fleet Foxes from Helplessness Blues – out May 3rd\n\n“Forever in Armitron” – Boat from Dress Like Your Idols\n\n“Albatross” – Wild Beasts from Smother – out May 10th\n\n“Weapons of War” – A Lull from Weapons for War single (with remixes) – out April 19th\n\n“I’m Not Ready” – Surfer Blood\n\nSongs 6-10 for Week 4.5, March 2011\n\n“Running With Insanity” – Alcoholic Faith Mission from And The Running With Insanity\n\n“Belong” – The Pains of Being Pure at Heart from Belong\n\n“Dancing Fools” – Alcoholic Faith Mission from And The Running With Insanity\n\n“Surfer’s Hymn” – Panda Bear from Surfer’s Hymn single\n\n“Birth of Serpents” – The Mountain Goats from All Eternals Deck\n\nMarch Songs We Like That Didn’t Make Top Ten\n\nThe Process of Organizing the Best Songs of 2011 Mixtape Series (continued from introduction)\n\nFor all eventual 12 parts of this playlist series, there will be one huge mixtape featuring the top songs for that month. Please keep in mind that some songs included were advanced singles from albums that came out later, just in case you find yourself thinking, “wait a second, I’m sure the album that track is from didn’t come out in March.” All of the songs included are based on the month in which we first premiered them on the site. The rest was up to everyone else since each of the 12 volumes of the Best Songs of 2011 series are representative of the weekly Top Ten Songs playlists posted throughout the year. The songs that made the weekly Top 10 mixes were based on the number of times each one was played and downloaded during the week in question.\n\nWhether you’re just hanging out at home, driving around, on a bike ride, or kicking it with friends, this mixtape, together with the other two volumes, will definitely be enough awesome tracks to keep you busy listening and downloading tracks to your iTunes or desktop.\n\nWhy is this mixtape series easily one of the finest of all the ‘best’ of 2011 mixtapes on the web? Well, besides the fact that the featured songs are all stellar, standout tracks of the year, it’s actually because you, and literally millions of other music lovers from across the country and around the world, picked the best songs over the past 10 months based on which tracks you listened to, and downloaded, the most. We don’t know of any other ‘indie’ and alternative rock blog or site online in which the listeners rank the top songs of the year – in addition to the weekly Top Ten Songs series. For us, it makes it that much more special.\n\nHalloween is over (if you missed the Halloween mixes go here) , and the holiday season (is it too early for Christmas mixes?) is revving up. Isn’t it crazy that 2011 is almost over? In addition to the holiday season, this is the time of year when ‘best of’ lists; see IRC’s Best Songs of 2011 series. In fact, right now, volume three will be posted on Monday.\n\nWe are really excited by this new-to-us band, Jupe Jupe, and have listened to the following two tracks about eight times apiece. If you’re old enough to remember bands like Depeche Mode and OMD, then you might just feel like you’re going back in time to the alternative goth rock sound of the late 1980’s and early 90’s, right before grunge busted out of Seattle with Nirvana in the forefront. We expect to hear more from Jupe Jupe in 2012; maybe they’ll even be one of our Bands to Watch in 2012.\n\nBut first, we have to kick off this week’s Best New Releases with the cool new track by Rich Aucoin, “It,” from the just-dropped album, We’re All Dying to Live. Aucoin is a rising Canadian musician and songwriter who has criss-crossed The Great White North a number of times on tour, including one time by bicycle. Aucoin has performed on stage with artists like Dan Deacon, Girl Talk, Deerhoof, The Weakerthans, The Golden Dogs, Holy Fuck, The Constantines, Dirty Projector’s and others. We don’t think it was an accident, however, that Aucoin’s album cover art is strangely similar to Sufjan Stevens‘ brilliant, and classic ‘indie,’ LP, Illinoise (shown below for comparison). From the font choice to the inclusion of Superman. Hmmmm.\n\n“It” – Rich Aucoin from We’re All Dying To Live\n\n“Once Around the Sun” – Jupe Jupe from Reduction in Drag\n\nDouble-shot: “Suspicion” – Jupe Jupe from Reduction in Drag\n\nFor More: JupeJupeMusic.com\n\nAlso, this week Fallon Cush released their self-titled, debut album, AM & Shawn Lee continue their collaboration with the release of Celestial Eclectic, plus listen to The Beach Boys’ The Smile Sessions via Spinner.\n\n“Disintegrate” – Fallon Cush from Fallon Cush\n\n“Dark into Light” – AM & Shawn Lee from Celestial Eclectic\n\nStream The Beach Boys’ The SMiLE Sessions via Spinner\n\nIf you’re a fan of Jesus and the Mary Chain, and The Beach Boys, you’ll probably want to hear the Mary Chain’s cover of the Boys’ “Surfin USA.” The track is from an site we like a lot called Cover Me Songs, where there are also other J&TMC covers of Pink Floyd, The Temptations and Jerry Reed. While we are featuring Beach Boys’ cover songs, might as well throw in a great new one – My Cousin, The Emperor covering The Beach Boys’ “Girl Don’t Tell Me.”\n\n“Surfin USA” (The Beach Boys) – Jesus and the Mary Chain\n\n“Girl Don’t Tell Me” (The Beach Boys) – My Cousin, The Emperor\n\nEarlier this year, we featured an advance single from the Dallas band Air Review, and the track received a good response. The band’s music is masterfully composed, performed and produced indie folk pop, as clearly demonstrated on the splendid track, “America’s Son.” In fact, it’s one of our favorite Rarely Heard Songs of 2011 (that series will also be coming out soon; browse past posts). We included both tracks the band sent us from their LP, America’s Son, which was officially released on Nov. 1st.\n\nWithout hesitation, Air Review are a band to watch in 2012. Having previously opened for bands like Bowling for Soup, Blue October, Boxer Rebellion and One Eskimo, and after making a name for themselves in the Dallas-Forth Worth area, it’s beyond us to explain why they haven’t received a record deal yet. Perhaps they have, and they turned it down, but when we listened to these tracks for the first time, and the whole album afterwards, it simply did not make sense that a label wouldn’t have signed Air Review by now.\n\nAir Review is just another example of what we always say – there are ten times as many fantastically talented and incredibly promising bands, that are DIY and flying under the radar, than there are popular ‘indie’ and alternative rock bands that are drooled over in some mainstream ‘indie’ blogs and music sites. The second single, “Low Wishes” is unmistakably upbeat, uplifting indie pop song, complete with magnificent choruses – the kind of song that you might want to play if you need a quick shot of inspiration. If we were a label, we’d probably sign this band. In 2009, the band released their debut album, Landmarks.\n\n“America’s Son” – Air Review from America’s Son\n\n“Low Wishes” – Air Review from America’s Son\n\nPlus, we would be remiss not to include the latest new tracks from new albums by rising band, Girl in a Coma, and the now globally-known band, Florence and the Machine. Also, don’t miss standout singles from new releases by Low Roar, The Soft Moon, The Loom and Carter Tanton.\n\nOut of only respect, we are including the new single, “The View,” from Lou Reed and Metallica. Now, don’t get us wrong, we are HUGE fans of Lou Reed, (especially his Velvet Underground days a million years ago), and as far as Metallica, well, not so much. But this single is absolutely dreadful; shockingly so. But we still wanted to include it so that everyone can make up their own minds, but “yikes.” As soon as we heard that Lou was making a single with Metallica, we didn’t understand, and now we can see much more clearly just why that announcement made us skeptical.\n\n“Smart” – Girl in a Coma from Exists & All the Rest\n\n“Shake It Out” – Florence + the Machine from Ceremonials on Island Universal\n\n“Tonight, Tonight, Tonight” – Low Roar from Low Roar\n\n“Under Evergreen” – Shelby Earl from Burn the Boats\n\n“Total Decay” – The Soft Moon (courtesy of Pitchfork) from Total Decay EP\n\n“For the Hooves That Gallop, and the Heels That March” – The Loom from Teeth\n\n“Murderous Joy” – Carter Tanton from Freeclouds\n\n“The View” – Lou Reed & Metallica from Lulu\n\n(click the track to hear the Soundcloud cut)\n\nIn Dee Mail Releases for the Week of Nov. 1: Sun Sweet Sun, Hundred Days, The Cocks, The Scales\n\nThis section of Best New Releases keeps with our tradition of presenting good and interesting music from relatively unknown to completely unknown signed, but mostly DIY, unsigned artists who sent their music directly to us. Greenville, South Carolina indie space pop/noise-rock band Sun Sweet Sun, lead by James Noyes, and his brother, Julian, is probably our favorite DIY artist with a new album out this week, Goodbye, Strange World. Julian is the band’s composer and lead vocalist, and James assumes guitar and synth.\n\nThe first track, “Planet Earth,” is edgier, fuzzier and noisy than the more spacey, reverb-heavy, predominantly vocal-lead sound of “Even Spacemen Need A Little Love” is charming enough on its own. They describe their music as “Lewis Carrol by way of James Dickey…a broad-ranging home-recording project and also a raggedly enthusiastic live band with a bit of Warholian mythologizing.” Aside from the over-stuffing of adjectives, we like their style – definitely can see why they count The Flaming Lips among their biggest influences.\n\n“Planet Earth” – Sun Sweet Sun from Goodbye, Strange World\n\n“Even Spacemen Need a Little Love” – Sun Sweet Sun from Goodbye, Strange World\n\nSun Sweet Sun on Facebook\n\nThe following handful of tracks are from new releases out this week that are more on the metal to punk spectrum of the musical scale, including London DIY hard rockers, Hundred Days’; another UK band, The Cocks‘ “Turns Around The Corner”; a new single from NYC punk band, The Scales, plus a track from a Russian band, Cape Fligely.\n\n“Suicide Joe” – Hundred Days from Mission Exodus\n\n“Burn In Hell” – Hundred Days from Mission Exodus\n\n“Turns Around The Corner” – The Cocks from Tuesday Morning Hangover\n\n“Day to Day” – The Scales from Brain Food\n\n“Private Life” – Cape Fligely from The Key\n\nAgain, these are not songs (and especially not albums) that we are expecting to make a big splash, but since the artists went through the trouble of submitting their music, and because each has a new album out this week, we just felt it is worth including them in the mix. We’re especially interested to know which of this week’s In Dee Mail (for artists that send their music in the mail) artists you guys like the most, so please use the Comments section to do your own critique or review; sometimes we even update the post to include listeners’ comments.\n\nAnother week, another set of new albums. But firstly, this week saw the official release of a new live album from a musical genius that some people consider one of the forerunners of indie rock – the prolific Peter Gabriel. This week, Gabriel released New Blood, an album recorded live in London with an orchestra, no guitars and no drums – playing alternative versions of many of his best-known songs, and of course Gabriel on piano.\n\n“Red Rain” (Instrumental) – Peter Gabriel from New Blood\n\nThis week’s Best New Releases offers a diversity of music styles, artists and subjects.There is a good number of truly ‘indie’ and DIY bands – such as Color Radio, Casiokids, High Places, Future Islands – and more well-known artists, like Andrew Bird, Ben Lee and John Wesley Harding.\n\nBut first, we want to introduce you to a band that you may have not heard of before, but it would not be for a lack of press and accolades. Enation is an anthemic indie rock band from Washington state fronted by Jonathan Jackson. Their music has appeared on film and television soundtracks, including One Tree Hill and Stephen King‘s Riding the Bullet. Enation broke into the Top 10 on iTunes‘ Rock Charts. CDBaby picked the band as a Notable Artist and The New Music Seminar nominated Enation to the prestigious “Top 100 Artists on the Verge” for 2011In fact, CDBaby praised the band enthusiastically, stating that “Enation is fast becoming recognized as one of the best epic rock bands around.” Judge for yourself. Here are two tracks the band set to us to share with you from their new album out this week,\n\n“Prodigal” – Enation from My Ancient Rebellion\n\n“The Rushing Wind” – Enation from My Ancient Rebellion\n\nEnation have previously opened for artists like Angels & Airwaves, Kate Voegele, Everly, Dustin Ruth, and House of Heroes, and list among their influences Coldplay, U2, Bob Dylan, Radiohead, Snow Patrol, and Switchfoot.\n\nAnother band that sent us tracks directly is the newly formed eclectic Baltimore band, Drunk Monk. Infusing a combination of rock, “surf doom” (their words), psychedelic and jazz, Drunk Monk describe themselves like so: “Guitar, bass, drums. Very few words. We like to record live. We don’t know how to surf…overwhelmingly positive response at every show.”\n\n“Woefully Intentional” – Drunk Monk from Drunk Monk\n\n“Dorothy vs. The Shadow People” – Drunk Monk from Drunk Monk\n\nWe’ve also included nearly two dozen MP3s of new singles from new releases by bands and artists like High Places, Sun Hotel, T.W. Walsh, Yukon Blonde, Extra Arms, Casey Shea, Rocket from the Tombs, Crooked Fingers, Savaging Spires, The Morning Clouds, Rachael Yamagata, Gill Landry, Library Voices, and Hess Is More.\n\n“Balance” – Future Islands from On the Water\n\n“Golden Years” – Casiokids from Aabenbaringen Over Aaskammen\n\n“Quiet House” – Color Radio from Architects\n\n“Year Off” – High Places from Original Colors\n\n“Fire” – Yukon Blonde from Fire/Water EP\n\n“Creation Keeps the Devil Away” – Hess is More from Creation Keeps the Devil Away\n\n“Sing Your Own Song” – John Wesley Harding from The Sound of His Own Voice\n\n“Typhoon” – Crooked Fingers from Breaks in the Armor\n\n“Annie” – Gill Landry from Piety & Desire\n\n“Traveller’s Digest” – Library Voices from Summer of Lust\n\n“The Wrong Things” – The Morning Clouds from Wasted Youth Blues EP\n\n“Little Eyes” – Radio Moscow from The Great Escape of Leslie Magnafuzz\n\n“Bending the Rules of Time” – Savaging Spires from Savaging Spires\n\n“Starlight” – Rachael Yamagata from Chesapeake\n\n“Alchemy” – Sun Hotel from Gifts (self-released)\n\n“Make It Rhyme” – T.W. Walsh from Songs of Pain and Leisure\n\n“Race to Sleep” – Extra Arms from In Parallel\n\n“Best Disguise Is No Disguise” – Extra Arms from In Parallel\n\n“Jennifer” – Casey Shea from In Your Head\n\n“Sundowner (featuring Jason Collett)” – Danielle Duval from Of the Valley\n\n“I Sell Soul” – Rocket from the Tombs from Barfly"
