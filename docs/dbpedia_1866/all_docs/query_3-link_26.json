Bull of the Woods is their third and final studio album, released in 1969, and has long been out of print and unavailable on vinyl.

Not surprising as the Brooklyn natives, a lot of them friends since childhood, have never shied away from the lyrics-centered tradition of New York hip-hop.\n\nTheir distinctive voices and skills on the mic, as well as NY-centric storytelling drive the album, and the chemistry is undeniable. The production is tight, but this is also where the supergroup shifts away from musically, perhaps what the title of the project is alluding to. Erick Arc Elliott, Power Pleasant, Sam Wish, and Tyler Dopps lay down slick, bouncy instrumentals as opposed to boom bap, and it's refreshing and fun to hear the group expand its sound. Check out \"Distance,\" \"Left Hand,\" \"Snow In The Stadium,\" \"Far Away,\" and \"Coast/Clear.\"\n\nThe RSD Black Friday edition features 2LPs on translucent orange color and a Beast Coast Sticker.\n\n$38.98\n\nQuick View\n\nThe Beatnuts\n\nIntoxicated Demons [RSD Black Friday 2023]\n\nVinyl: $26.98 Buy\n\nIntoxicated Demons: The EP is the debut extended play by American hip-hop trio The Beatnuts.

The project consisted of two singles, \"Reign of the Tec\" and \"No Equal,\" in addition to eleven cuts and five skits, spanning a total length of twenty-five minutes. Upon release, reviewers praised the album for its blend of jazzy boom bap, syncopated lean drum machines and a myriad of jazz, funk and soul samples. For the 30th anniversary, Intoxicated Demons: The EP will be released on Red vinyl exclusively for RSD Black Friday.\n\n$26.98\n\nQuick View\n\nJeff Beck\n\nTribute [RSD Black Friday 2023]\n\nVinyl: $19.98 Buy\n\nATCO/Rhino honors the two-time Rock and Roll Hall of Famers immeasurable legacy with an EP of three songs making their debut on vinyl.

Gram put together a pretty great band, including the then-unknown Emmylou Harris as his singing partner. The shows were somewhat uneven at first, but by midtour the band started to find its groove.\n\nOne show stood out to pedal steel player Neil Flanz: the third night at the Bijou Cafe in Philadelphia. Neil felt that this was the best show of the tour and requested a copy of the soundboard recording. He saved it for almost forty years, and then it was acquired by Amoeba Music for a future Gram release. It then disappeared in the Amoeba vault for another ten years before it was rediscovered when Amoeba moved to a new location in LA.\n\nIt turns out Neil was right. This is Gram and Emmylou at their finest. And its the next to last club date ever for Gram and the Fallen Angels. A 50-year-old soundboard cassette offers some unique challenges, but thanks to the efforts of some of the worlds best archival sound restoration engineers, the beauty and energy of Gram, Emmy and the band shine through.\n\nFor all of those who never got to experience Gram live, this is the closest well ever get to being there.\n\n*First new Gram solo material release in 40 years\n\n*First live Gram solo club appearance ever released\n\n*Recorded 3/16/73 Bijou Cafe Philadelphia\n\n*Definitive 2LP performance in its original sequence\n\n*19 Songs, Including Sin City, Love Hurts and Drug Store Truck Drivin Man\n\n*Band includes Emmylou Harris on Vocals\n\n*11x17 Gram poster included\n\n*Cover features long lost Gram and Emmylou motorcycle photo\n\n1-01 Introduction/ Flint Hill Special/ 1-02_We'll Sweep Out The Ashes / 1-03_My Uncle/1-04_Drug Store Truck Drivin Man/1-05_Streets Of Baltimore/1-06_Baptizing Down By The Creek/1-07_California Cotton Fields/1-08_Love Hurts/1-09_Cry One More Time/2-01 Sin City/ 2-02 Big Mouth Blues/2-03 Jambalaya/2-04 Six Days On The Road/2-05 Introductions/2-06 The New Soft Shoe/2-07 Rock & Roll Medleytotal / Hang On Sloopy/Baby What You Want Me To Do/Boney Maroney/Forty Days/Almost Grown\n\n$39.99\n\nQuick View\n\nOscar Peterson\n\nCon Alma: The Oscar Peterson Trio -- Live in Lugano, 1964 [RSD Black Friday 2023]\n\nVinyl: $24.98 Buy\n\nOscar Petersons trio with Ray Brown and Ed Thigpen is widely regarded as Petersons classic trio, considered by fans the most popular and in-demand of his long, storied career and featured on releases such as 1963s Night Train and 1964s We Get Requests.\n\nRecorded during their creative peak in 1964 (five years into their collaboration), this previously unheard and unreleased live performance is destined to become a fan favorite from the Oscar Peterson vaults. In his memoir Peterson reflects on the dedication that Ray and Ed brought to the group: \"In addition to our trio rehearsals, therefore, Ray would call his own rehearsals in his or Eds room and they would simply practice time. They created a flexible and multi-faceted rhythmical language that they could apply to any musical statement I might make and enhance any direction I might choose. In short, they practiced all the possibles.\n\nFor RSD Black Friday on limited edition translucent light blue vinyl.\n\nSIDE 1\n\n1. Waltz for Debby\n\n2. My One and Only Love\n\n3.

The record changed rap music with its dark undercurrent, Latin inflection, no-holds-barred storytelling, and the inimitable interplay between B-Real and Sen Dog cast over psychedelically spun rap soundscapes courtesy of DJ Muggs.\n\nNow to mark the 30th anniversary, two new remixes are available for fans on 12 black vinyl; Insane in the Brain from the esteemed DJ/Producer Statik Selektah, and Hits From The Bong crafted by the albums original producer himself, DJ Muggs.\n\n$22.98\n\nQuick View\n\nDe La Soul\n\n3 Feet High and Rising [RSD Black Friday 2023]\n\nVinyl: $100.98 Buy\n\n3 Feet High and Rising is the debut studio album by hip-hop trio De La Soul, and was released on March 3, 1989. It marked the first of three full-length collaborations with producer Prince Paul, which would become the critical and commercial peak of both parties. It contains the singles, Me Myself and I, The Magic Number, Buddy, and Eye Know. The album title came from the Johnny Cash song Five Feet High and Rising. It is listed on both Rolling Stones 200 Essential Rock Records and The Sources 100 Best Rap Albums. When Village Voice held its annual Pazz & Jop Critics Poll for 1989, 3 Feet High and Rising was ranked #1. It was also listed on Rolling Stones The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.\n\nReleased amid the 1989 boom in gangsta rap, which gravitated towards hardcore, confrontational, violent lyrics, De La Soul's uniquely positive style made them an oddity beginning with the first single, Me, Myself and I. Their positivity meant many observers labeled them a hippie group, based on their declaration of the D.A.I.S.Y. Age (Da. Inner. Soul. Yall). Sampling artists as diverse as Hall & Oates, Steely Dan and The Turtles, 3 Feet High and Rising is often viewed as the stylistic beginning of 1990s alternative hip hop (and especially jazz rap). 3 Feet High & Rising was chosen by the Library of Congress to be added to the National Recording Registry for its cultural significance and general excellence.\n\nThis special boxset release of De La Souls 3 Feet High and Rising includes twelve 7 custom singles pressed on splatter vinyl and housed in custom sleeves, housed in a box that includes a 7 pinup and a double-sided 7 slipmat, and is available first at record stores as part of RSD Black Friday. \"\n\n1A.

The cover and label proclaimed, Nothing can stop Prince and the New Power Generation and the release contains the damn near 10 min mix of the song on one side with a blank flip side. The original version was provided to radio and club DJs as a promo on Princes 33rd birthday (June 7, 1991) and only 1,500 copies were created.
