Trying to get voters to desperately nominate them for every award, while name-dropping the who’s-who of bait-worthy talent — all while every self-important and self-proclaimed “cinephile” pretends to preach about the difference between true “art” and “garbage” as if they invented the concept of “film” and are the authorities between what “real filmmaking” is and isn’t.\n\nContinue reading “NOC Review: ‘The Fabelmans’ is Fine”\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nEverything We Know About Steven Spielberg’s ‘The Fabelmans’\n\nThe subtle change in temperature and the color of the leaves means that the seasons are changing — Summer Movie season to Oscar Season, that is! And leading the change among the numerous contenders bound for Oscar gold and glory is the latest from the greatest director of our time, Steven Spielberg: The Fabelmans. Here’s everything we know about the upcoming awards hopeful, hitting theaters November 11.\n\nContinue reading “Everything We Know About Steven Spielberg’s ‘The Fabelmans’”\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nJanina Gavankar Talks About Her New Film, ‘Encounter’\n\nAfter four years since the last time she stopped by, Janina Gavankar returns to the NOC to catch up on the last few years. She and I discuss the projects she’s completed in that time, including the new film starring Riz Ahmed, Encounter, now available to stream on Prime Video.\n\nContinue reading “Janina Gavankar Talks About Her New Film, ‘Encounter’”\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n‘Snakehead’ to Finally Hit Theaters and Digital in October\n\nAfter more than a decade in development, director Evan Jackson Leong is now ready to unveil his magnum opus, Snakehead, to the world. Starring Shuya Chang, Sung Kang, and Jade Wu, Snakehead tells the story of Sister Tse, a woman who rises through the ranks of a Chinatown crime family before having to reconcile between personal success and her family. Check out the trailer below:\n\nContinue reading “‘Snakehead’ to Finally Hit Theaters and Digital in October”\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n‘Unapologetic’ is an Unflinching Exploration of Activism\n\n“What is this helping?” is one of the first sentences uttered by a white restaurant patron unsettled in Unapologetic’s first scene, where protestors express the reality of the recent deaths of Black residents in their community to unsuspecting people eating brunch at restaurants. The scene perfectly encompasses the themes and motives of this documentary: a large and triumphant call to arms to make a more honest and equal world while people sit quietly trying to ignore not only the performance, but the actual knowledge of those who are destroyed and subjugated by these injustices.\n\nContinue reading “‘Unapologetic’ is an Unflinching Exploration of Activism”\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nThe Fate of Black Women in ‘Joker’\n\nBe warned, this is a spoiler-heavy article.\n\nWhen I saw Joker at the Toronto International Film Festival, the main question I wanted answered was: Do the Black people die in this movie? Spoiler alert: they don’t. At least not on screen. Clearly, the director, Todd Phillips, knew what it would look like if they were to die by the Joker’s hand (even if he doesn’t seem to quite know how to do a press tour). But that doesn’t mean all is well for positive representation in the widely divisive movie.\n\nContinue reading “The Fate of Black Women in ‘Joker’”\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nNOC Review: ‘Hustlers’ is No Scam\n\nTo put it in TV terms, director Lorene Scafaria’s Hustlers is perfect for viewers who liked the crafty chaos of Walter White and the motherly desperation of Good Girls. The sexy crime dramedy stars Constance Wu (Dorothy/Destiny) and Jennifer Lopez (Ramona) as New York strippers who, in the wake of the 2008 recession, must find a new way to make ends meet when dancing isn’t enough.\n\nContinue reading “NOC Review: ‘Hustlers’ is No Scam”\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nNOC Review: Rian Johnson Slays with ‘Knives Out’\n\nOn the morning after his 85th birthday party, acclaimed mystery writer Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer) is found dead in his study, a cut carotid and blood splashed everywhere. His family, a classic Christiean cast of characters, are all waiting to find out the contents of his will. It’s with this well-known whodunit premise that Rian Johnson’s uproariously hilarious Knives Out begins.\n\nContinue reading “NOC Review: Rian Johnson Slays with ‘Knives Out’”\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nThe Happy Hour Review: Colossal is Basically White Feminism\n\nI watch, I drink, I spit hot fire. Yup, you guessed it, spoilers ahead.\n\nColossal checked off a lot of boxes for what I would theoretically enjoy in a movie. Directed by Nacho Vigalondo, it is often funny, surprisingly dark, and an inventive new take on kaiju movies. I like all those things. The lead, Gloria, is easy to root for as played by star Anne Hathaway. And Jason Sudeikis impresses as Gloria’s friend and eventual foil, Oscar. For about half of the movie, I found this all very enjoyable.\n\nContinue reading “The Happy Hour Review: Colossal is Basically White Feminism”\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nBruce Lee Movie Stars a White Guy Because Of Course it Does\n\nThis morning, Deadline unveiled the first trailer for Birth of the Dragon, which recently made its debut at the Toronto International Film Festival. Ostensibly, the film depicts the legendary fight between Bruce Lee (played by Philip Ng) and Wong Jack Man (Yu Xia). But because this is Hollywood, the movie is going to be told from the perspective of a white dude.\n\nContinue reading “Bruce Lee Movie Stars a White Guy Because Of Course it Does”\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nTIFF Review: The Birth of a Nation\n\nby Joelle Monique\n\nIn watching The Birth of a Nation I was a little destroyed. There’s so much to unpack. Nat Turner is a legendary figure in the Black community — a former slave who removed his own shackles. It’s a story I’ve wanted to see on screen for a long time. The reviews out of Sundance were huge. Then, news of Nate Parker rape charges and acquittal broke. I debated a long time about whether or not to cover the story when I came to TIFF. Eventually, I decided that a film this prominent and this culturally invested couldn’t be ignored. I have mixed feelings about what I saw. I’m going to take it slow.\n\nContinue reading “TIFF Review: The Birth of a Nation“\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading..."
