        "text": "Bernie Tiede Film Analysis\n\n744 Words | 3 Pages\n\nThe story of Bernhardt “Bernie” Tiede is well known for its realistic and entertaining motion picture. This adaptation depicts the impression of a warm, caring man who the community wouldn’t believe partook in the murder of an elderly woman. It is not the question if Bernie committed the act, rather than “did he plan it?” I believe this crime was not premeditated, but was done in the “heat of the moment”.\n\nLaylee's Kin Film Analysis\n\n1426 Words | 6 Pages\n\nLaylee’s Kin was a very moving documentary on how the oppression of the African American culture has been generationally effected by the cotton industry. It was apparent in Layee’s family how illiteracy, incarceration, and discrimination caused a cycle of poverty in the families of Tallahatchie County. The film introduced a few individuals that really stood out in their film for their resiliency. Granny, Laylee’s Granddaughter, really stood out to me in the film dealing with the incarceration of her father Reggie. Reggie Barns, the superintendent of the school who was battling a probation due to poor testing scores.\n\nMovie Analysis Of Gook\n\n1272 Words | 6 Pages\n\nGook does not simply show the Korean side of the struggle or the African American side of the struggle, but it displays both of their struggles and how they converge. Eli and Daniel attempt to maintain their father’s shoe business, but they fall behind in rent and must buy illegally in order to maintain their store, while many Kamilla and her family deals with abusive households and poverty. Both ethnic groups share the same struggle, but the mainstream media pushes the Model Minority myth to create the imaginary that all Asians Americans always do well. This misrepresentation of Asian Americans creates a division between the Korean and African American communities by taking the story out of context. Gook challenges this racial division and describes the interdependency among the Asian, Latino, and African American community.\n\nReview Of Eric Lius The Accidental Asian\n\n1720 Words | 7 Pages\n\nA review of Eric Lius', The Accidental Asian, and his search for self-discovery.

Through Liu’s experiences, we can understand the struggle of identity and help students find their own. Finding that we do not have to have a strong connection to our heritage to have a strong identity and looking for our roots does not make us any less of the person we are now. Breaking stereotypes and understanding others is how we can help students in the future.\n\nCedric Jennings Character Analysis\n\n727 Words | 3 Pages\n\nBut Cedric Jennings, son of a jailed drug dealer, will not swallow his pride, though each day he struggles to decide who he wants to be.

The thought of a group of college hockey players beating the “lab-made” Russians was almost inconceivable at the time. Although this sporting achievement was immense, the political significance of the Americans beating the Russians was far more significant. Following World War II, Eastern and Western nations faced geopolitical tensions, and eventually, entered into the Cold War. While the U.S and Russia never fired a shot during the Cold War, the tension between the two nations was ever-present.\n\nFrank Serpico Film Analysis\n\n710 Words | 3 Pages\n\nThe third issue we found out from “Serpico” is corruption.

But in reality, Gladwell proved that Asian countries actually have a cultural advantage in the subject due to their number system. Most numbers in Chinese “can be uttered in less than a quarter of a second” while English numbers take a third. This difference allows Chinese children to memorize and count at an earlier age, leaving Western children a year behind at age five. Similarly, Gladwell cited Chinese culture of hardwork growing rice paddies as a reason for mathematic success.\n\nStereotypes Of Asian-Americans\n\n271 Words | 2 Pages\n\nNowadays, Asian-Americans are still the target of stereotypes against them, but those stereotypes have evolved with the time. Among those stereotypes, a stereotype pretends that Asians are so called bad drivers, and another pretends that they are all smart and good in math. The first is often due to the image medias and experience give us to Asian traffic, overall China, Thailand, Vietnam, Myanmar and India because of the growing population and accidents. Furthermore, in Asia, traffic rules are hardly ever respected. The origin of the fact that Asians are smart and good in math can be explained by the Asian educational system which promotes sciences, math and technologies in school’s programs to create new searchers who could be useful to economic growth and scientific progress in development countries.\n\nI Became Her Target Analysis\n\n171 Words | 1 Pages\n\nSo he always wanted and expected his kids to do well in math.

Until the twenty-first century, although people tried to make the country becomes the freedom and equality nation, these issues are still happening everywhere. According to \"In Living Color: Race and American Culture,\" Stuart Hall argues that racism is still widespread in the society and \"it is widely invisible even to those who formulate the world in its terms\" (qtd. in Omi 683). Indeed, situations about race quietly exist in the movie industry, which \"has led to the perpetuation of racial caricatures\" to the majority audiences and even minority audiences (Omi 629).\n\nMean Girls: Post-Feminist Analysis\n\n1687 Words | 7 Pages\n\nKobe couldn’t do that.

In this way, this quote reveals how the protagonist conveys the message of Asian people never being able to break from the stereotypes associated with their nationality; highlighting how the author’s ideologies are conveyed through first person narration. Additionally, Wilkinson utilises intertextual references to characterise ‘the nerds of the story’, with\n\nThe Asian American Dream\n\n649 Words | 3 Pages\n\nAsian Americans include persons that come to the United States from a variety of countries in Asia and the Indian subcontinent (McNamara & Burns, 2009). Although the do share similar physical features, each subgroup has its own history, customs, and culture (McNamara & Burns, 2009). There are many different perceptions of Asian Americans in general. One is that they have overcome barriers and discrimination to be successful and achieve the ‘American Dream’ (McNamara & Burns, 2009). One reason for this I believe is that the majority of Asian Americans come to the United States with a dream and a goal to be successful.\n\nFresh Off The Boat Diversity\n\n1446 Words | 6 Pages\n\nBy portraying a Chinese immigrant family that addresses specific immigrant issues while still connecting with mass America, Fresh Off the\n\nBaz Luhrmann Film Analysis\n\n706 Words | 3 Pages\n\nBaz Luhrmann’s films are known their ability to make a watcher feel as if they are part of the show. Between his use of camera angles, shots and the use of a narrator, it’s no wonder he is able to keep viewers on the edge of their seat. But how does Baz Luhrmann pull off this spectacular feat of his? This is probably explained best by referring to Baz Luhrmann’s films and how he himself has evolved as a director."
