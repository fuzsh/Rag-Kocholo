He began his Christian allegory while in prison, accused of conducting religious services without permission. The book has been translated into more than 200 languages and many theologians consider it the second most-read book of faith after the Bible.\n\nThe film, dubbed Heavenquest: A Pilgrim's Progress, is the third movie from King Street Pictures, which makes faith-inspired films for a global audience.

The film, inspired by John Bunyan’s iconic 1678 novel The Pilgrim’s Progress, which is second only to the Bible itself in global Christianity, brings together a powerful cast of well-known U.S. faith-based actors, and international film and television stars, including South Korean megastar Cha In Pyo.

The international market for faith based films is relatively untapped and full of potential. As we have traveled the world, especially Asia, we have seen the strong demand for such content amongst Christians abroad, and we believe the next generation faith films should be designed to engage all of those audiences worldwide,” said Dan Mark, Producer and Principal of King Street Pictures. “We believe our modern, edgy retelling of this classic story with a diverse international cast is going to pioneer new markets for faith based content abroad and will capture the imagination of audiences worldwide, especially in Asia. So we are incredibly honored and blessed to have the esteemed In Pyo Cha in our cast and as our Executive Producer. We couldn’t have asked for a better creative partner to see this vision come to life on screen.”\n\nPilgrim’s Progress has been translated in 200 languages in last 3 centuries, making it the second most read faith book after the Bible.\n\nFilm Synopsis: King Street Pictures proudly presents an epic new fantasy adventure film inspired by the world of John Bunyan’s classic tale “The Pilgrim’s Progress.” In a war between the Northern and Southern Kingdoms of Eos, a regal man named Vangel is thrust on a journey against his will when he is suddenly and mysteriously arrested. Brought before the Southern King and sentenced to death, Vangel escapes a chain gang and flees for the North. Armed with a book called the Record of the Ancients that he receives from a wise sage, Vangel embarks on an adventure that takes him through haunted forests, dark swamps, and enchanted mountains while being hunted all the while by the Southern King’s men in hot pursuit. Along the way, mysterious travel companions with special giftings arise and assist him on the journey, sharing about a fabled good king and pushing him onwards towards the Wicket Gate, the gateway to the North, while enemies lurk at every corner trying to derail him from his path."
