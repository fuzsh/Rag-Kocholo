        "text": "Everything is film…\n\nTan Chui Mui’s latest film is a shapeshifting child of fiction and reality, which makes it one of the barbarians in the history of cinema, because it opposes any strict labels and categorization. Without any background information, Barbarian Invasion is an innovative take on the action genre and its canon. After delving deeper into the production story, it is clear that at some point everything becomes film and Barbarian Invasion is an extremely personal project. The dense contextuality does not block the openness to various readings of the film which makes it also an honest highly relatable account of introspection and self-discovery.\n\nBarbarian Invasion revolves around Moon Lee, an award-winning actress who has retired since becoming a full-time mom. Now divorced, she decides to return to acting and reunites with her long-time collaborator, director Roger Woo. She arrives with her young son to Phuket in Thailand to start production of a martial arts film while its script is still in the making. Moon undertakes a rigorous training to do all the fighting and stunts herself while taking care of her kid at the same time. The clash between professional and private life is inevitable, the situation getting even more complicated after Moon finds out that the investors press on casting her ex-husband opposite her in the romantic role.\n\nIn the opening sequence, the camera follows Moon closely as she carries the luggage and patiently endures her son’s hyperactivity. At first, the title of Tan Chui Mui’s film is puzzling, but it refers to Hannah Arendt’s quote “Every generation, civilization is invaded by barbarians – we call them ‘children’”. Child turned Moon’s world upside down, but it does not mean that she ceased to be herself after becoming a mother. There are a lot of taboos and social expectations around motherhood. It is expected to have a certain mindset and formulas that can be uttered in conversations with other people whenever the topic of parenthood comes up. One’s individual identity is threatened by this new situation and there is a confusing blur between the self and the different social roles. Tan Chui Mui already played the mother in recent debut Sometime Sometime (2020). Maybe it’s a coincidence, but in both films she wears a wig at some point and it does seem like a perfect manifestation of such an inner conflict. In Barbarian Invasion during one of the straining martial arts classes, Moon asks “What is ‘myself’?”. In the film the answer turns out to be painfully and brilliantly simple, but it does not mean it’s easy to grasp.\n\nTan Chui Mui’s latest film is a shapeshifter, and the filmmaker dresses the story in genre conventions of action films as well as many references to their history. Moon binds her hair in a single French braid which makes her look like Lara Croft, the encounters with monks also slightly remind of Tomb Raider (2001, dir. Simon West). There is even an echo of The Matrix in the scene where Moon is asked to choose between the red pill and blue pill, but finally tasting sour green-coloured. The film within the film seems to be a mixture between The Bourne Identity and 2019 Vietnamese film Furie (dir. Lê Văn Kiệt). Among all these transnational influences, there is a strong reference to Malaya when in the must-have club scene, the band plays Terang Bulan – a song with an impossibly complex history, its melody being adapted into the national anthem.\n\nIn Barbarian Invasion Tan Chui Mui also reflects on being a filmmaker and realities of the industry. In the making-of footage in which Tan introduces how the idea for the film came about and the character of Roger Woo seems to be a synthesis of many talks, situations and personalities from the film business as well as another Tan’s alter ego. The crew behind Barbarian Invasion features the key figures of Malaysian independent cinema – James Lee, Pete Teo and Bront Palarae acting, Woo Ming Jin co-producing, Jacky Yeap assisting on set – which makes the production seem like a reunion of friends. Writer-director-producer James Lee created an amazing tongue-in-cheek portrayal of a martial arts teacher, serious edging whimsical. Indie musician and filmmaker Pete Teo brilliantly uses facial expressions and body posture while playing Roger Woo, a film director struggling with pain and aches of creative work and business talks. Bront Palarae is just himself, using the unique quality of a film star.\n\nBarbarian Invasion is an extremely honest portrayal of a personal journey to self and all of its various aspects. It also offers a unique insight into how the indie scene works in Southeast Asia while also being a touching account of lifelong cinephilia. In addition, the soundtrack composed by Kamal Sabran is truly electrifying and when the end credits start to roll the tingling sensation along my spine was activated instantly. Such a perfect match between the ending scene and music brings catharsis, an occurrence quite rare these times."
