        "text": "SABU\n\nOn the 4th of July I tweeted that I was sick and tired of people prattling on about Tarantino, Scorsese, Lynch, Spielberg and all of the other big name directors that people are constantly going back to. I did this because if you listen to Film Twitter there are only five or six directors worth speaking of and all the good films have been made until these filmmakers make their next film. Of course they are saying this at the same time as they are professing a deep love of cinema… the vast majority of which they are completely ignoring.\n\nIn all seriousness these so called film fans, who claim to live and die cinema, seem not to be watching anything new. They are not wading into the trenches and watching anything from the up and coming filmmakers. Worse they are not attempting to find new voices that need to be amplified. They are not out there trying to find the next great director by watching the small films and going to the small fests. If you ask me ,they should be, since its been my experience the best filmmakers are outside the studio system; or if they are in the system they are down in the food chain.\n\nI’m sick and tired of Film Twitter and many of the big name writers droning on and on about filmmakers and films that have been talked up to death. Frankly most of the “great filmmakers” are not in touch with the world today and their films show it. They live isolated lives and aren't making films that connect to life being lived.\n\nIn the tweet I suggested that people need to track down people like Marq Evans, Justin McConnell, Jason Karatilianm, Shaun Clarke and Bao Tran because they are making films that will open you mind and your idea of what film could be (even if it’s in the form of a well-worn genre). And having said it I instantly freaked out because there are more than just those guys who are doing great things. Those were just the guys I had been talking to and about right before the Tweet. I knew I needed to highlight all the other filmmakers, especially the women since the last five years have been full of the most amazing films from women (Madison Campion and Elena Beuca being just the tip of the iceberg). I needed to put all their names out there…..so I came up with the idea of putting a list together.\n\nFoolishly I tweeted that I would run a list in August…and went off to make it. I figured I could bang it out and put it up one day and be done with it. I mean how hard could it be? Well it was hard enough that the list is going to appear over several weeks (months?) time and end eventually.\n\nLet's face it there are a lot of great filmmakers out there that most people are not talking about.\n\nYou should know that it is a list of filmmakers with a few brief words about them and some of their films you should see see. I know I should have given you links to the films but this has turned into a long list and for now the best I can do is point you to their work. Its so big that I have broken the list into random bite sized pieces. I have done this so that you will not get overwhelmed by a huge list. I want you to look at the names and try the films. Doing in bite size pieces will allow that\n\nThe list is going to run Sunday nights for the next couple of months, so its going to be a while before I get to everyone I want to highlight... and I know the finished list maybe incomplete because there are simply too many filmmakers I have run across and I may not have written down every name. I may miss someone it will be accidently. I'm going to do my best not to have that happen, but then again the list won't be done until I say its done so hopefully I will get everyone I need to.\n\nA quick note to the various filmmakers- there is no order to how anyone appears or in what part. The order is random, selected by my trips backward and forward through my notes and the posts at Unseen. They appear as I ran across a name, not because I like some one better.\n\nAnd now the first part of the list. I made the this part by going through the early days of Unseen Films, before I truly fell in love with inde films, before I started to make a lot of friends who shared films and filmmakers with me. As a result it is a list made up of some better known filmmakers, because that's what I was watching. The part of the list that follow will be less mainstream (assuming you can call even these filmmakers mainstream.)"
