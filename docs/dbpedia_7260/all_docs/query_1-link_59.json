The documentary was also produced by Brian Yang as well as Christopher Chen, Allen Lu, Patricia Sun, James D.

When the film screened at Sundance, it received positive reviews from the Los Angeles Times, The Hollywood Reporter, Variety, and many more publications.\n\nLeong has also directed the feature-length documentary 1040: Christianity in the New Asia (2010), a documentary that chronicles the rapid changes in Asia and the significant shift in the spiritual landscape in the area known as the “10/40 Window”- the region between 10 and 40 degrees north latitude on the eastern hemisphere.\n\nLeong has also directed, from a script he has written, the drama Snakehead which was initially slated to star Lucy Liu in a story about the underworld of human smuggling that takes place on the streets of New York City's Chinatown. Later Kickstarter campaigns of the film reveal that the lead actress has been switched from Lucy Liu to Shuya Chang (playing the main character of Sister Tse), and actors such as Sung Kang (playing a character named Rambo) and Jade Wu (playing a character named Dai Mah) have been added to the cast. The film was also produced by Linsanity producer Brian Yang.\n\nShort films and music videos\n\nAmong the other films Leong has directed include the short film, Manivore (2009) (starring Grace Su and C.S.

Leong also directed the \"Fists of Fuhrer\" segment in Justin Lin's Finishing the Game starring Roger Fan as Breeze Loo, Nathan Jung as \"Bob,\" Aiko Tanaka, and Nikita Esco (credited as Natalie Susko), with choreography from Don Thai.\n\nLeong's banner is known as Arowana Films. He has also directed a number of music videos that have screened on MTV and other outlets for groups such as Far East Movement (music videos for the tracks \"Round Round\" and \"Satisfaction\" on The Fast & The Furious: Tokyo Drift soundtrack; \"Western\", \"Work Bounce\" and \"Far East Futura\"), MC Jin (the tracks \"Yum Dom Cha\" and \"Li Li Luan\"/\"Li Li Chaos\"), Lyrics Born (the tracks \"Last Trumpet\" and \"Bad Dreams\"), and Estairy (\"Hands Up\" also feat. Equipto).\n\nHe also co-Directed, with Michelle Phan, the Paris-shot Rouge in Love, which has accumulated close to 3 million views on YouTube and was scored by George Shaw.\n\nLeong also used to be a segment producer for MTV News starting from 2010.\n\nProducing and other work\n\nLeong was a field producer on the political documentary, ...So Goes the Nation (2006) and has also assisted with or worked in the production department of films directed by Justin Lin including Finishing the Game (2007) (Co-Producer, Post Production Coordinator, 2nd Unit Director), The Fast and The Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006) (where he was also Justin Lin's assistant), and Better Luck Tomorrow (2002) (where he was an Assistant Editor and also played the role of the \"Slapper's Boyfriend\"; he also directed a \"behind-the-scenes\" short documentary about the film entitled BLT:Genesis). Leong is also a cinematographer and Steadicam operator, having done additional camera work on the documentary short Spotlighting (2005) directed by Justin Lin.\n\nBackground\n\nLeong is a graduate of UCLA (majoring in Asian American Studies) and is also a sixth-generation Chinese American native of San Francisco, California, specifically the Richmond District."
