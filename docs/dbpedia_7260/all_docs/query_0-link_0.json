Leong is known for his documentary Linsanity about Jeremy Lin, which made its world premiere at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival.[1][2] He has also directed the documentary 1040: Christianity in the New Asia (2010), and the documentary short BLT Genesis (2002), which tracks the behind-the-scenes making of and trajectory of Justin Lin's film, Better Luck Tomorrow.\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nLeong is a sixth-generation Chinese American.[3] Leong grew up in the Richmond District, San Francisco, California.[4]\n\nEducation\n\n[edit]\n\nLeong earned a bachelor's degree in Asian American Studies from UCLA.[4] He transferred to UCLA from the University of California, Riverside, where he was a member of the Pi Alpha Phi fraternity.[5]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nFilms and documentaries\n\n[edit]\n\nLeong directed the documentary Linsanity about Jeremy Lin, which screened at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival.[6][7][8][2][9] The documentary was also produced by Brian Yang as well as Christopher Chen, Allen Lu, Patricia Sun, James D.

Leong also directed the short film Suckerball 73 as a Visual Communications \"Armed with a Camera\" fellowship film, which screened at the 2003 Los Angeles Asian Pacific Film Festival (or VC Film Fest as it was known back then).[23] Leong also directed a short documentary entitled Him Mark Lai: The People's Historian (2005) and a short PSA on the Asian Law Caucus entitled Empowering Communities: Asian Law Caucus in Action (2010).[24] Leong also directed the \"Fists of Fuhrer\" segment in Justin Lin's Finishing the Game starring Roger Fan as Breeze Loo, Nathan Jung as \"Bob,\" Aiko Tanaka, and Nikita Esco (credited as Natalie Susko), with choreography from Don Thai.[25]\n\nLeong's banner is known as Arowana Films.
