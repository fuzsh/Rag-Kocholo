        "text": "FIRST IMPRESSION OF JEREMY LIN:\n\nThere’ve been a few Asian American players that have come up [in the Bay Area], but none were as good as Jeremy Lin. And he’s not this 7-foot-6 center; he’s a point guard and a leader controlling the game, and you don’t see that all that often. And I remember watching him dunk – he’d do these amazing dunks! So even when we started filming his senior year at Harvard, I already knew it was a great story.\n\nAPPROACHING JEREMY ABOUT THE DOCUMENTARY:\n\nHe was very quiet and professional at first. We talked about God. What’s funny is – I have a mohawk, but I was wearing a cap to hide it, and at the end, he saw the mohawk peeking out from the back, and he was like “Whoa, you have a mohawk?” And I was like, “Yea, my girl told me to hide it just in case you were really conservative,” and he was like, “No man, that’s cool!” And then he sported a fauxhawk for a little bit after that.\n\n[wp_ad_camp_3]\n\nJEREMY’S PERSONAL HOME VIDEOS:\n\nJeremy’s dad was like that guy from American Beauty, always recording everything. At first he gave us three hours of footage, and that was a lot, but then he gave us 30 hours of footage. [Laughs] We wanted to show a personal side of Jeremy that you don’t usually get to see in the media.\n\nCURRENT PROJECT:\n\nI’m working on a documentary on [YouTube makeup guru] Michelle Phan. They’re both underdogs, both Asian American, and both had strong obstacles to face. Asian Americans in general are often the underdog in the media, and it’s important to get [these stories] out there to inspire a new generation of Asian American kids."
