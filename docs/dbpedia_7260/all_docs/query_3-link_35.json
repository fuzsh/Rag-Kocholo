        "text": "In the Department of Film, Television, and Media, we create and study the moving image as seen on multiple screens—on the big screens of movie palaces, the cineplex, the art house and the film festival; on small screens ensconced in mammoth fifties consoles and those of giant flat-screened visual glory. With a strong undergraduate curriculum of production and studies, a burgeoning doctoral program in film, television, and media and a faculty of award-winning scholars and media makers, the Department of Film, Television, and Media offers a vibrant intellectual and artistic community here in the Midwest/Great Lakes region.\n\nThe Department of Film, Television, and Media prepares students to create and study film, media, and digital worlds in which stories represent multiple life experiences and points of view. Our classes are designed to engage students intellectually and creatively as they develop projects wherein diversity -- informed by race, ethnicity, gender, religious beliefs, class, sexuality, ability, and nationality—is nurtured and welcomed. We celebrate having a diverse group of students who enrich classroom interactions, learning experiences, and creative endeavors. Our faculty and staff are committed to developing and sustaining a working environment in which diversity, equity, and inclusion are the norm."
