        "text": "February 2012 was an extraordinary month for Jeremy Lin. The first Chinese-American to play in the NBA, Harvard University graduate Lin went undrafted in 2010, but signed with the Golden State Warriors, where he saw little playing time in his rookie season and was thrice demoted to the NBA's D-League.\n\nThe following December, Lin played two preseason games for the Houston Rockets, but was waived before the start of the lockout-shortened season. Right before the end of 2011, Lin landed a spot on the injury-riddled New York Knicks, who assigned him to their D-League affiliate a few weeks later.\n\nThen, with persistent injuries keeping more seasoned guards sidelined, Lin was called back up and earned some playing time on the Knicks. After a particularly impressive showing against cross-town rivals the New Jersey Nets, Lin was thrust into the Knicks' starting lineup. He used that opportunity to dazzle. With star players unable to suit up, the 6-foot-3 point guard turned around a team that had lost 11 of their last 13 games and led them to a seven game winning streak. That stretch saw Lin score over 20 points and dish out close to 10 assists on a nightly basis as he outplayed the likes of Kobe Bryant. Playing in one of the country's two major markets where courtside seats are lined with celebrities, a star was immediately born and one unlike any before him.\n\nThe phrase \"Linsanity\" quickly entered the vernacular and Lin would remain the Knicks' starting point guard until suffering a knee injury in late March. By then, both Lin and the Knicks had come down from the clouds. Still, those two weeks in the middle of winter stood as an incredible Cinderella story, the kind that comprise montages in scripted zero-to-hero sports movies.\n\nFittingly enough, Hollywood has come around to tell Lin's story, in documentary form. Linsanity, the second feature directed by Evan Jackson Leong, celebrates Lin's uphill struggle and unlikely breakthrough.\n\nNo hasty cash-in, Leong's documentary was several years in the making, conceived long before anyone could have known it was a rags-to-riches tale. Leong devotes roughly the first third of the film to Lin's upbringing in the San Francisco suburb of Palo Alto. The middle of three sons to Taiwanese immigrants, Lin grew up playing piano, not very passionately or well. At a young age, his parents recognized his heart belonged to basketball and they cheered him on from AAU competition to high school. In his junior year, a sprained ankle suffered in a pickup game the night before deprived Lin of a chance to play in the state championship game. The following year, Lin led his team of Davids over their Goliaths, the tall, dominant, nationally ranked Mater Dei squad.\n\nDespite his high school success, Lin found colleges weren't interested in extending an athletic scholarship to him, even the ones he showed great interest in. Lin makes the slightly controversial but probably fair claim that if he was black, he'd have gotten a Division I scholarship. Instead, he had to settle for attending one of the world's most respected institutions. Leong doesn't dwell on Lin's Harvard achievements as much as seize an opportunity to address the racial taunts he endured while playing there.\n\nNext, we relive Lin's disappointment at not getting chosen in either round of the NBA Draft and see his efforts to break into the league through free agency, from holding his own against #1 overall draft pick John Wall on the Dallas Mavericks' summer league team to getting signed by his hometown team, the Warriors, only to speculate he was there as a gimmick to excite the area's populous Asian-American community.\n\nIn the summer of 2011, Lin visits his parents' homeland of Taiwan and his grandparents' China. He uses the time afforded during the NBA lockout to improve his game,\n\nonly to be waived during the abbreviated training camp and get signed by the Houston Rockets, where he was the 6th point guard in the rotation and let go of on Christmas Day. Two days later, Leong was there to capture Lin's reaction to his signing by the desperate, undermanned Knicks. Even then, he is always in danger of being cut and giving up on basketball altogether.\n\nRoughly the film's final third documents those exciting weeks that gave birth to the titular phrase and similar variations (e.g. \"Lincredible\", \"Jeremy Win\"). It places a lot of importance on just a handful of regular season games, but Lin's sudden rise to stardom was truly unprecedented, as cited statistics show. The fervor, during which Lin crashed on the couches of a teammate and his brother, catches hold not just of New York, but the entire world, with even Dwayne Johnson, Conan O'Brien, and President Obama seen commenting on this phenomenon.\n\nLeong balances the on-court heroics with looks at Lin the person. The cross T of the title logo is a slightly tacky acknowledgment of Lin's Christian faith. We hear from Lin's pastor and Lin himself in post-game interviews that he credits God for all his opportunities. Lin's piety does not seem to be for the cameras and he remains as likable and humble as any professional athlete. Candid moments of him eating with his brothers, showing off his beloved Lion King blanket, and buying home decor from Target's clearance rack humanize this man and endear him to us. His success is the result of many strokes of luck, from Knick injuries to the timing of his release from the Rockets. If even just one event had not lined up, Lin might very well be employed in altogether different arena.\n\nWhile Lin has yet to recreate the heroics of his breakout month, he's no Tim Tebow. Whether starting or being one of the first players off the bunch, Lin remains an integral part of the Rockets. He also continues to be one of the most globally popular players in the league, currently ranking fourth among Western Conference guards in fan voting for this season's NBA All-Star Game."
