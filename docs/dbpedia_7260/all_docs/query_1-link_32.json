        "text": "Note: Snakehead will not be screened as previously listed; Leong’s Linsanity is the full-length screening this evening.\n\nOn February 2012, an entire nation of basketball fans unexpectedly went ‘Linsane.’ Stuck in the mire of a disappointing season, the New York Knicks did what no other NBA team had thought about doing. They gave backup point guard Jeremy Lin an opportunity to prove himself. He took full advantage, scoring more points in his first five NBA starts than any other player in the modern era, and created a legitimate public frenzy in the process. Prior to this now-legendary run, Lin had faced adversity in his career at every turn. He wasn’t offered a scholarship by any major university, nor was he drafted by any NBA team after a standout collegiate career at Harvard.\n\nEvan Jackson Leong is a sixth-generation Chinese American director and documentary filmmaker. Leong is known for his documentary Linsanity (2013) about Jeremy Lin, which chronicled the rise of NBA player Jeremy Lin and premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in 2013. He has directed the documentaries 1040: Christianity in the New Asia (2010) and short BLT Genesis (2002) He got his start on the set of director Justin Lin’s Better Luck Tomorrow.\n\nThe Film and Media Screening Series is supported by the Diversity Council, the Student-Faculty Corporation, the School of Liberal Arts, and the departments of Film, Media and Performing Arts, English and Communication Studies, and Modern Languages and Cultures."
