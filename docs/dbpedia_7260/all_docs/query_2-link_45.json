He took full advantage, scoring more points in his first five NBA starts than any other player in the modern era, and created a legitimate public frenzy in the process. Prior to this now-legendary run, Lin had faced adversity in his career at every turn.

Then despite a standout collegiate career at Harvard, he was not drafted by any NBA team.\n\nSelected Festivals:\n\nSundance FF\n\nHong Kong IFF\n\nSXSW FF"
