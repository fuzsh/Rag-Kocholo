        "text": "How did you first hear about AWC? What made you decide to apply?\n\nI heard about AWC in the early years of the program. Justin Lin or Ernesto Foronda told me to apply and I'm glad I listened. Back then, there weren't a lot of opportunities to experience a program like this one.\n\nTell us, how has the program experience challenged your filmmaking process?\n\nThe fact that you have to share you work with other filmmakers in the editorial stage challenges your growth and you are faced with other peer's opinions. Since I didn't go to film school, being around other artists that were on the same level as me was awesome.\n\nHow did it feel to be a part of the AWC Fellowship - working amongst AAPI filmmakers?\n\nI appreciate working with filmmakers from my own community because our narratives are aligned and there is a common thread in all the stories we tell. This creates a safe place for creativity and we are innately sensitive to the cultural references.\n\nWho do you think would benefit most of the AWC Fellowship?\n\nI think all young AAPI filmmakers benefit the most from the fellowship. When you work with AWC you are exposed to seasoned filmmakers and the process on a level that is always beneficial for a budding filmmaker. We can always learn."
