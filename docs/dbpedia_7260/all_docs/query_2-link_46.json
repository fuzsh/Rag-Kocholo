        "text": "The New York Asian Film Foundation and Film at Lincoln Center are delighted to unveil further highlights of the 2021 New York Asian Film Festival (NYAFF), including the Opening Night film, the Variety Star Asia Lifetime Achievement Award honoree, the competition lineup, the inaugural Asian American Focus selection, and additional titles. The Festival will screen over 60 films, both virtually and in person, to audiences in New York and across the country from August 6 – 22, 2021.\n\nNYAFF’s 20th edition will kick off at Film at Lincoln Center on August 6 with the in-person international premiere of Ryoo Seung-wan’s tense action thriller Escape from Mogadishu, starring Kim Yoon-seok (NYAFF Star Asia winner 2018) and Zo In-sung. The dramatic film is based on real events that took place in 1991 at the onset of the Somali Civil War, and depicts the perilous escape attempted by North and South Korean embassy workers who were stranded in the title city during the conflict. (Well Go USA is releasing the film in the United States and Canada.)\n\nLegendary filmmaker Ann Hui will be the recipient of the Variety Star Asia Lifetime Achievement Award. One of the most critically acclaimed Hong Kong New Wave filmmakers for four decades, Hui has created work of great sensitivity, focusing on themes of cultural displacement, family conflict, and female perspectives. In her honor, NYAFF will be showcasing her early masterwork, The Story of Woo Viet, starring Chow Yun-fat and now celebrating its 40th anniversary, as well as Man Lim Chung’s insightful, delightful portrait of the inimitable Hui, Keep Rolling.\n\nNYAFF also unveiled the six wildly diverse and singular titles nominated for this year’s Uncaged Award for Best Feature Film Competition, which shines a spotlight on first- or second-time directors, celebrating their passion, their vision, and their willingness to take risks. The films are: Anima (Cao Jinling, China), City Of Lost Things (Yee Chih-yen, Taiwan), Hand Rolled Cigarette (Chan Kin Long, Hong Kong), Joint (Oudai Kojima, Japan), Ten Months (Namkoong Sun, South Korea) and Tiong Bahru Social Club (Tan Bee Thiam, Singapore).\n\nThe winner of the Uncaged Award will be selected by a competition jury comprised of prominent personalities from the film business bridging Asia and America: Michael Rosenberg (president, Film Movement), Evan Jackson Leong (director, Linsanity, Snakehead), and Janice Chua (VP, International Development and Production at Imagine Entertainment & Television).\n\nFollowing an unprecedented year in which COVID-19 and increased violence against the Asian community in the United States presented enormous challenges, NYAFF is more committed than ever to increasing exposure of Asian representation on screen. The festival is proud to launch a brand-new Asian American Focus, a selection of superlative films made in the U.S. that will kick off in person with Aimee Long’s torn-from-the-headlines thriller A Shot Through the Wall. Members of the filmmaking team will be present.\n\nThe Asian American Focus will also feature Iman K. Zawahry’s Americanish and Evan Jackson Leong’s Snakehead, with appearances by members of the cast and crew of each film. The selection further includes two new short-film showcases of five films each, which will be screened in person and virtually on Eventive.\n\nOther festival highlights include the world premiere of the manga-inflected marital comedy Sensei, Would You Sit Beside Me?, starring Tasuku Emoto (a guest at NYAFF 2018 for Opening Night film Dynamite Graffiti) and Haru Kuroki; and the international premieres of Stanley Tong’s celebration of classic kung -fu, Rising Shaolin: The Protector, with megastar Wang Baoqiang; Lee Woo-jung’s powerful coming-of-age feature debut, Snowball, starring Bang Min-a from K-Pop girl group Girl’s Day; and Min Kyu-dong’s haunting exploration of AI sentience, The Prayer. And finally, receiving its North American premiere, Fruit Chan’s Coffin Homes tickles the funny bone and tingles the spine, as soaring real estate prices force people in Hong Kong to share their homes with the dead.\n\nFor NYAFF’s 20th edition poster, we have drawn from Ko Chen-nien’s The Silent Forest, an image almost tailor-made to represent how we’re feeling as we cautiously emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic: slightly dazed, but laser-focused and ecstatic to be back in person at FLC and SVA with this year’s most unforgettable Asian films.\n\nNYAFF’s 2021 lineup will include two Japanese world premieres, six international premieres, 29 North American premieres, eight U.S. premieres, and nine New York premieres, showcasing the most exciting action, comedy, drama, thriller, romance, horror, and art-house films from Japan, Hong Kong, China, South Korea, Philippines, Malaysia, Taiwan, Thailand, Kazakhstan, Singapore, and for the first time, Myanmar and the U.S.\n\nLATEST LINEUP (with more to come)\n\n(Please note that the program is still subject to change.)\n\nTitles in bold are newly announced entries in the lineup.\n\nOPENING FILM\n\nEscape from Mogadishu | dir.
