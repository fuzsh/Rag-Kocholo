        "text": "Qualified Joint Venture\n\nYou and your spouse can elect to treat an unincorporated business as a qualified joint venture instead of a partnership if you:\n\nEach materially participate in the business (see Material participation, later, in the instructions for line G);\n\nAre the only owners of the business; and\n\nFile a joint return for the tax year.\n\nMaking the election will allow you to avoid the complexity of Form 1065, but still give each of you credit for social security earnings on which retirement benefits, disability benefits, survivor benefits, and insurance (Medicare) benefits are based. In most cases, this election will not increase the total tax owed on the joint return.\n\nJointly owned property.\n\nYou and your spouse must operate a business to make this election. Do not make the election for jointly owned property that is not a trade or business.\n\nOnly businesses that are owned and operated by spouses as co-owners (and not in the name of a state law entity) qualify for the election. Thus, a business owned and operated by spouses through an LLC does not qualify for the election of a qualified joint venture.\n\nMaking the election.\n\nTo make this election, divide all items of income, gain, loss, deduction, and credit attributable to the business between you and your spouse based on your respective interests in the business. Each of you must file a separate Schedule C or F. Enter your share of the applicable income, deduction, or (loss) on the appropriate lines of your separate Schedule C or F. Each of you may also need to file a separate Schedule SE to pay self-employment tax. If the business was taxed as a partnership before you made the election, the partnership will be treated as terminating at the end of the preceding tax year. For information on how to report the termination of the partnership, see Pub. 541.\n\nRevoking the election.\n\nThe election can be revoked only with the permission of the IRS. However, the election remains in effect only for as long as you and your spouse continue to meet the requirements to make the election. If you and your spouse fail to meet the requirements for any year, you will need to make a new election to be treated as a qualified joint venture in any future year.\n\nEmployer identification number (EIN).\n\nYou and your spouse do not need to obtain an EIN to make the election. But you may need an EIN to file other returns, such as employment or excise tax returns. To apply for an EIN, see the Instructions for Form SS-4 or go to IRS.gov/EIN.\n\nRental real estate business.\n\nIf you and your spouse make the election for your rental real estate business, you must each report your share of income and deductions on Schedule E. Rental real estate income is not generally included in net earnings from self-employment subject to self-employment tax and is generally subject to the passive loss limitation rules. Electing qualified joint venture status does not alter the application of the self-employment tax or the passive loss limitation rules.\n\nMore information.\n\nFor more information on qualified joint ventures, go to IRS.gov/QJV.\n\nMaterial participation.\n\nFor purposes of the seven material participation tests listed later, participation generally includes any work you did in connection with an activity, if you owned an interest in the activity at the time you did the work. The capacity in which you did the work does not matter. However, work is not treated as participation if it is work that an owner would not customarily do in the same type of activity and one of your main reasons for doing the work was to avoid the disallowance of losses or credits from the activity under the passive activity rules.\n\nWork you did as an investor in an activity is not treated as participation unless you were directly involved in the day-to-day management or operations of the activity. Work performed as an investor includes:\n\nStudying and reviewing financial statements or reports on the activity,\n\nPreparing or compiling summaries or analyses of the finances or operations of the activity for your own use, and\n\nMonitoring the finances or operations of the activity in a nonmanagerial capacity.\n\nParticipation by your spouse during the tax year in an activity in which you own an interest can be counted as your participation in the activity. This rule applies even if your spouse did not own an interest in the activity and whether or not you and your spouse file a joint return. However, this rule does not apply for purposes of determining whether you and your spouse can elect to have your business treated as a qualified joint venture instead of a partnership (see Qualified Joint Venture, earlier).\n\nFor purposes of the passive activity rules, you materially participated in the operation of a trade or business activity during 2023 if you met any of the following seven tests.\n\nYou participated in the activity for more than 500 hours during the tax year.\n\nYour participation in the activity for the tax year was substantially all of the participation in the activity of all individuals (including individuals who did not own any interest in the activity) for the tax year.\n\nYou participated in the activity for more than 100 hours during the tax year, and you participated at least as much as any other person for the tax year. This includes individuals who did not own any interest in the activity.\n\nThe activity is a significant participation activity for the tax year, and you participated in all significant participation activities for more than 500 hours during the year. An activity is a “significant participation activity” if it involves the conduct of a trade or business, you participated in the activity for more than 100 hours during the tax year, and you did not materially participate under any of the material participation tests (other than this test 4).\n\nYou materially participated in the activity for any 5 of the prior 10 tax years.\n\nThe activity is a personal service activity in which you materially participated for any 3 prior tax years. A personal service activity is an activity that involves performing personal services in the field of health, law, engineering, architecture, accounting, actuarial science, performing arts, or consulting, or any other trade or business in which capital is not a material income-producing factor.\n\nBased on all the facts and circumstances, you participated in the activity on a regular, continuous, and substantial basis for more than 100 hours during the tax year. Your participation in managing the activity does not count in determining if you meet this test if any person (except you) (a) received compensation for performing management services in connection with the activity, or (b) spent more hours during the tax year than you spent performing management services in connection with the activity (regardless of whether the person was compensated for the services).\n\nLine 24a\n\nEnter your expenses for lodging and transportation connected with overnight travel for business while away from your tax home. In most cases, your tax home is your main place of business, regardless of where you maintain your family home. You can’t deduct expenses paid or incurred in connection with employment away from home if that period of employment exceeds 1 year. Also, you cannot deduct travel expenses for your spouse, your dependent, or any other individual unless that person is your employee, the travel is for a bona fide business purpose, and the expenses would otherwise be deductible by that person.\n\nDo not include expenses for meals on this line. Instead, see Line 24b, later. Do not include entertainment expenses on this line.\n\nInstead of keeping records of your actual incidental expenses, you can use an optional method for deducting incidental expenses only if you did not pay or incur meal expenses on a day you were traveling away from your tax home. The amount of the deduction is $5 a day. Incidental expenses include fees and tips given to porters, baggage carriers, bellhops, hotel maids, stewards or stewardesses and others on ships, and hotel servants in foreign countries. They do not include expenses for laundry, cleaning and pressing of clothing, lodging taxes, or the costs of telegrams or telephone calls. You cannot use this method on any day that you use the standard meal allowance (as explained underLine 24b, later).\n\nYou can’t deduct expenses for attending a convention, seminar, or similar meeting held outside the North American area unless the meeting is directly related to your trade or business and it is as reasonable for the meeting to be held outside the North American area as within it. These rules apply to both employers and employees. Other rules apply to luxury water travel.\n\nFor details on travel expenses, see chapter 1 of Pub. 463.\n\nLine 30\n\nBusiness use of your home.\n\nYou may be able to deduct certain expenses for business use of your home, subject to limitations. To claim a deduction for business use of your home, use Form 8829, or you can elect to determine the amount of the deduction using a simplified method.\n\nIf you have a business use of another home, you can’t use the simplified method for that home. You can use the Form 8829 to claim expenses for business use of the other home.\n\nFor additional information about claiming this deduction, see Pub. 587.\n\nNote.\n\nLine 30 doesn't apply to filers of Form 1040-SS.\n\nIf you are not using the simplified method to determine the amount of expenses you may deduct for business use of a home, do not complete the additional entry spaces on line 30 for total square footage of your home and of the part of the home used for business. Instead, include the amount from line 36 of your Form 8829 on line 30.\n\nSimplified method.\n\nThe simplified method is an alternative to the calculation, allocation, and substantiation of actual expenses. In most cases, you will figure your deduction by multiplying the area (measured in square feet) used regularly and exclusively for business, regularly for daycare, or regularly for storage of inventory or product samples, by $5. The area you use to figure your deduction cannot exceed 300 square feet. You cannot use the simplified method to figure a deduction for rental use of your home.\n\nElecting to use the simplified method.\n\nYou choose whether or not to use the simplified method each tax year. Make the election by using the simplified method to figure the deduction for the qualified business use of a home on a timely filed, original federal income tax return for that year. An election for a year, once made, is irrevocable. A change from using the simplified method in one year to actual expenses in a succeeding year, or vice versa, is not a change in method of accounting and does not require the consent of the Commissioner.\n\nIf you share your home with someone else who uses the home for a separate business that qualifies for this deduction, each of you may make your own election, but not for the same portion of the home.\n\nIf you conduct more than one business that qualifies for this deduction in your home, your election to use the simplified method applies to all your qualified business uses of your home. You are limited to a maximum of 300 square feet for all of the businesses you conduct in your home that qualify for this deduction. Allocate the actual square footage used (up to the maximum 300 square feet) among your qualified business uses in any reasonable manner you choose, but you may not allocate more square feet to a qualified business use than you actually use in that business.\n\nSimplified Method Worksheet\n\n1. Enter the amount of the gross income limitation. See the Instructions for the Simplified Method Worksheet (below) 1. _____ 2. Allowable square footage for the qualified business use. Do not enter more than 300 square feet. See the Instructions for the Simplified Method Worksheet 2. _____ 3. Simplified method amount a. Maximum allowable amount 3a. $5 b. For daycare facilities not used exclusively for business, see the instructions for line 3b of this worksheet and enter the decimal amount from the Daycare Facility Worksheet; otherwise, enter 1.0 3b. _____ c. Multiply line 3a by line 3b and enter the result to 2 decimal places 3c. _____ 4. Multiply line 2 by line 3c 4. _____ 5. Allowable expenses using the simplified method. Enter the smaller of line 1 or line 4 here and include that amount on Schedule C, line 30. If zero or less, enter -0- 5. _____ 6. Carryover of unallowed expenses from a prior year that are not allowed in 2023. a. Operating expenses. Enter the amount from your last Form 8829, line 43 (line 42 if before 2018). See the Instructions for the Simplified Method Worksheet 6a. _____ b. Excess casualty losses and depreciation. Enter the amount from your last Form 8829, line 44 (line 43 if before 2018). See the Instructions for the Simplified Method Worksheet 6b. _____\n\nInstructions for the Simplified Method Worksheet Use this worksheet to figure the amount of expenses you may deduct for a qualified business use of a home if you are electing to use the simplified method for that home. If you are not electing to use the simplified method, use Form 8829. Line 1. If all gross income from your trade or business is from this qualified business use of your home, figure your gross income limitation as follows. A. Enter the amount from Schedule C, line 29 _____ B. Enter any gain derived from the business use of your home and shown on Form 8949 (and included on Schedule D) or Form 4797 _____ C. Add lines A and B _____ D. Enter the total amount of any losses (as a positive number) shown on Form 8949 (and included on Schedule D) or Form 4797 that are allocable to the business, but not allocable to the business use of the home _____ E. Gross income limitation. Subtract line D from line C. Enter the result here and on line 1 of the simplified method worksheet _____ If some of the income is from a place of business other than your home, you must first determine the part of your gross income (Schedule C, line 7, and gains from Form 8949, Schedule D, and Form 4797) from the business use of your home. In making this determination, consider the amount of time you spent at each location as well as other facts. After determining the part of your gross income from the business use of your home, subtract from that amount the total expenses shown on Schedule C, line 28, plus any losses shown on Form 8949 (and included on Schedule D) or Form 4797 that are allocable to the business in which you use your home but that are not allocable to the business use of the home. Enter the result on line 1 of the simplified method worksheet. Note: If you had more than one home in which you conducted this business during the year, include only the income earned and the deductions attributable to that income during the period you owned the home for which you elected to use the simplified method. Line 2. If you used the same area for the entire year, enter the smaller of the square feet you actually used or 300. If you and your spouse conducted the business as a qualified joint venture, split the square feet between you and your spouse in the same manner you split your other tax attributes. If you shared space with someone else, used the home for business for only part of the year, or the area you used changed during the year, see Figuring your allowable expenses for business use of the home, before entering an amount on this line. Do not enter more than 300 square feet or, if applicable, the average monthly allowable square footage on this line. See Part-year use or area changes (for simplified method only), later, for more information on how to figure your average monthly allowable square footage. Line 3b. If your qualified business use is providing daycare, you may need to account for the time that you used the same part of your home for other purposes. If you used the part of your home exclusively and regularly for providing daycare, enter 1.0 on line 3b. If you did not use the part of your home exclusively for providing daycare, complete the Daycare Facility Worksheet to figure what number to enter on line 3b. Line 6. Because you are using the simplified method this year, you cannot deduct the amounts you entered on lines 6a and 6b this year. If you file Form 8829 in a later year for your qualified business use of this home, you will be able to include these expenses when you figure your deduction. 6a. If you did not file a 2022 Form 8829, then your carryover of prior year operating expenses is the amount of operating expenses shown in Part IV of the last Form 8829, if any, that you filed to claim a deduction for business use of the home. 6b. If you did not file a 2022 Form 8829, then your carryover of prior year excess casualty losses and depreciation is the amount of excess casualty losses and depreciation shown in Part IV of the last Form 8829, if any, that you filed to claim a deduction for business use of the home.\n\nDaycare Facility Worksheet (for simplified method)\n\n1. Multiply days used for daycare during the year by hours used per day 1. _____ 2. Total hours available for use during the year. See the Instructions for the Daycare Facility Worksheet 2. _____ 3. Divide line 1 by line 2. Enter the result as a decimal amount here and on line 3b of the Simplified Method Worksheet 3. _____\n\nInstructions for the Daycare Facility Worksheet Use this worksheet to figure the percentage to use on line 3b of the Simplified Method Worksheet. If you do not use the area of your home exclusively for daycare, you must reduce the prescribed rate before figuring your deduction using the simplified method. If you used at least 300 square feet for daycare regularly and exclusively during the year, then you do not need to complete this worksheet. This worksheet is only needed if you did not use the allowable area exclusively for daycare. Line 1. Enter the total number of hours the facility was used for daycare during the year. Example. Your home is used Monday through Friday for 12 hours per day for 250 days during the year. It is also used on 50 Saturdays for 8 hours a day. Enter 3,400 hours on line 4 (3,000 hours for weekdays plus 400 hours for Saturdays). Line 2. If you used your home for daycare during the entire year, multiply 365 days (366 for a leap year) by 24 hours, and enter the result. If you started or stopped using your home for daycare during the year, you must prorate the number of hours based on the number of days the home was available for daycare. Multiply 24 hours by the number of days available and enter that result.\n\nIf you used your home for more than one business, you will need to file a separate Schedule C for each business. Do not combine your deductions for each business use on a single Schedule C.\n\nBusiness use of more than one home.\n\nYou may have used more than one home in your business. If you used more than one home for the same business during 2023, you may elect to use the simplified method for only one home; you must file a Form 8829 to claim a business use of the home deduction for any additional home. If one or more of the homes were not used for the entire year (for example, you moved during the year), see Part-year use or area changes (for simplified method only), later, and Columns (a) and (b) in the Instructions for Form 8829.\n\nOther requirements must still be met.\n\nYou must still meet all the use requirements to claim a deduction for business use of the home. The simplified method is only an alternative to the calculation, allocation, and substantiation of actual expenses. The simplified method is not an alternative to the exclusivity and other tests that must be met in order to qualify for this deduction. For more information about qualifying business uses, see Qualifying for a Deduction in Pub. 587.\n\nGross income limitation.\n\nThe amount of your deduction is still limited to the gross income derived from qualified business use of the home reduced by the business deductions that are not related to your use of the home. If this limitation reduces the amount of your deduction, you cannot carry over the difference to another tax year.\n\nCarryover of actual expenses from Form 8829.\n\nIf you used Form 8829 in a prior year, and you had actual expenses that you could carry over to the next year, you cannot claim those expenses if you are using the simplified method. Instead, the actual expenses from Form 8829 that were not allowed will be carried over to the next year that you use actual expenses to figure your deduction.\n\nDepreciation of home.\n\nYou cannot deduct any depreciation (including any additional first-year depreciation) or section 179 expense for the portion of your home that is used in a qualified business use if you figure the deduction for the business use of your home using the simplified method. The depreciation deduction allowable for that portion of the home for that year is deemed to be zero.\n\nAlthough you cannot deduct any depreciation or section 179 expense for the portion of your home that is a qualified business use because you elect to use the simplified method, you may still claim depreciation or the section 179 expense deduction on other assets (for example, furniture and equipment) used in the qualified business use of your home.\n\nFiguring your allowable expenses for business use of the home.\n\nYou will figure the deduction using Form 8829 or the Simplified Method Worksheet, or both.\n\nYou may not use the simplified method and also file Form 8829 for the same qualified business use of the same home.\n\nUsing Form 8829.\n\nUse Form 8829 to figure and claim this deduction for a home if you are not or cannot use the simplified method for that home. For information about claiming this deduction using Form 8829, see the Instructions for Form 8829 and Pub. 587.\n\nUsing the simplified method.\n\nUse the Simplified Method Worksheet in these instructions to figure your deduction for a qualified business use of your home if you are electing to use the simplified method for that home.\n\nShared use (for simplified method only).\n\nIf you share your home with someone else who uses the home for a separate business that also qualifies for this deduction, you may not include the same square feet to figure your deduction as the other person. You must allocate the shared space between you and the other person in a reasonable manner.\n\nExample.\n\nTaylor and Logan are roommates. Taylor uses 300 square feet of their home for a qualified business use. Logan uses 200 square feet of their home for a separate qualified business use. The qualified business uses share 100 square feet. In addition to the portion that they do not share, Taylor and Logan can both claim 50 of the 100 square feet or divide the 100 square feet between them in any reasonable manner. If divided evenly, Taylor could claim 250 square feet using the simplified method and Logan could claim 150 square feet.\n\nPart-year use or area changes (for simplified method only).\n\nIf your qualified business use was for a portion of the tax year (for example, a seasonal business, a business that begins during the year, or you moved during the year) or you changed the square footage of your qualified business use, your deduction is limited to the average monthly allowable square footage. You figure the average monthly allowable square footage by adding the amount of allowable square feet you used in each month and dividing the sum by 12.\n\nWhen determining the average monthly allowable square footage, you cannot take more than 300 square feet into account for any one month. Additionally, if your qualified business use was less than 15 days in a month, use -0- for that month.\n\nExample 1.\n\nFinley files a federal income tax return on a calendar year basis. On July 20, Finley began using 400 square feet of the home for a qualified business use. Finley continued to use the 400 square feet until the end of the year. Finley's average monthly allowable square footage is 125 square feet (300 square feet for August through December divided by the number of months in the year ((300 + 300 + 300 + 300 + 300)/12)).\n\nExample 2.\n\nRiley files a federal income tax return on a calendar year basis. On April 20, Riley began using 100 square feet of the home for a qualified business use. On August 5, Riley expanded the area of qualified business use to 350 square feet. Riley continued to use the 350 square feet until the end of the year. Riley's average monthly allowable square footage is 150 square feet (100 square feet for May through July and 300 square feet for August through December divided by the number of months in the year ((100 + 100 +100 + 300 + 300 + 300 + 300 + 300)/12)).\n\nExample 3.\n\nCarter files a federal income tax return on a calendar year basis. From January 1 through July 16, Carter used 300 square feet of the home for a qualified business use. On July 17, Carter moved to a new home and immediately began using 200 square feet of the new home for the same qualified business use. Using the simplified method to deduct expenses for the qualified business use for the previous home, Carter’s average monthly allowable square footage is 175 square feet (300 square feet for January through July divided by the number of months in the year ((300 + 300 + 300 + 300 + 300 + 300 + 300)/12)). Carter also prepared Form 8829 to deduct the actual expenses associated with the qualified business use of the new home.\n\nOnce you have determined your allowable square footage, enter the result on line 2 of the Simplified Method Worksheet.\n\nIf you moved during the year, your average allowable square footage will generally be less than 300.\n\nYou can use the Area Adjustment Worksheet in Pub. 587 to help you determine the allowable square footage to enter on line 2 of the Simplified Method Worksheet.\n\nReporting your expenses for business use of the home.\n\nIf you did not use the simplified method, include the amount from line 36 of Form 8829 on line 30 of the Schedule C you are filing for that business.\n\nIf you used the simplified method.\n\nIf you elect to use the simplified method for the business use of a home, complete the additional entry spaces on line 30 for that home only. Include the amount from line 5 of the Simplified Method Worksheet on line 30.\n\nIf you itemize your deductions on Schedule A, you may deduct your mortgage interest, real estate taxes, and casualty losses on Schedule A as if you did not use your home for business. You cannot deduct any excess mortgage interest, excess real estate taxes, or excess casualty losses on Schedule C for this home.\n\nUse Part II of Schedule C to deduct business expenses that are unrelated to the qualified business use of the home (for example, expenses for advertising, wages, or supplies, or depreciation of equipment or furniture).\n\nDeduction figured on multiple forms.\n\nIf you used more than one home for a business during the year, use a Form 8829 for each home or use the simplified method for one home and Form 8829 for any other home. Combine the amount you figured using the simplified method and the amounts you figured on your Forms 8829, and then enter the total on line 30 of the Schedule C for that business.\n\nLine 31\n\nFiguring your net profit or loss.\n\nIf your expenses (including the expenses you report on line 30) are more than your gross income, don’t enter your loss on line 31 until you have applied the at-risk rules and the passive activity loss rules. To apply these rules, follow the instructions under Line 32, later, and the Instructions for Form 8582. After applying those rules, the amount on line 31 will be your loss, and it may be smaller than the amount you figured by subtracting line 30 from line 29.\n\nIf your gross income is more than your expenses (including the expenses you report on line 30), and you don’t have prior year unallowed passive activity losses, subtract line 30 from line 29. The result is your net profit.\n\nIf your gross income is more than your expenses (including the expenses you report on line 30), and you have prior year unallowed passive activity losses, don’t enter your net profit on line 31 until you have figured the amount of prior year unallowed passive activity losses you may claim this year for this activity. Use Form 8582 to figure the amount of prior year unallowed passive activity losses you may include on line 31. Be sure to indicate that you are including prior year passive activity losses by entering \"PAL\" to the left of the entry space.\n\nIf you checked the \"No\" box on line G, see the Instructions for Form 8582; you may need to include information from this schedule on Form 8582, even if you have a net profit.\n\nRental real estate activity.\n\nUnless you are a qualifying real estate professional, a rental real estate activity is a passive activity, even if you materially participated in the activity. If you have a loss, you may need to file Form 8582 to apply a limitation that may reduce your loss. See the Instructions for Form 8582.\n\nReporting your net profit or loss.\n\nOnce you have figured your net profit or loss, report it as follows.\n\nIf you enter a loss on line 31, you may have an excess business loss. Use Form 461 to figure your excess business loss.\n\nIndividuals.\n\nEnter your net profit or loss on line 31 and include it on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 3. Also, include your net profit or loss on Schedule SE, line 2. However, if you are a statutory employee or notary public, see Statutory employees or Notary public, later.\n\nNonresident aliens.\n\nEnter your net profit or loss on line 31 and include it on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 3. You should also include this amount on Schedule SE, line 2, if you are covered under the U.S. social security system due to an international social security agreement currently in effect. See the Instructions for Schedule SE for information on international social security agreements. However, if you are a statutory employee or notary public, see Statutory employees or Notary public, later.\n\nTrusts and estates.\n\nEnter the net profit or loss on line 31 and include it on Form 1041, line 3.\n\nStatutory employees.\n\nEnter your net profit or loss on line 31 and include it on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 3.

If you were a statutory employee and you are required to file Schedule SE because of other self-employment income, see the Instructions for Schedule SE.\n\nNotary public.\n\nDo not enter your net profit from line 31 on Schedule SE, line 2, unless you are required to file Schedule SE because you have other self-employment income. See the Instructions for Schedule SE.\n\nYou can deduct one-half of your self-employment tax on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 15. See the Instructions for Schedule SE for details.\n\nCommunity income.\n\nIf you and your spouse had community income and are filing separate returns, see the Instructions for Schedule SE before figuring self-employment tax.\n\nEarned income credit (EIC).\n\nIf you have a net profit on line 31, this amount is earned income and may qualify you for the EIC.\n\nTo figure your EIC, use the instructions for Form 1040, line 27. Complete all applicable steps plus Worksheet B. If you are required to file Schedule SE, remember to enter one-half of your self-employment tax in Part 1, line 1d, of Worksheet B.\n\nException for small business taxpayers.\n\nIf you are a small business taxpayer, you can choose not to keep an inventory, but you must still use a method of accounting for inventory that clearly reflects income. If you choose not to keep an inventory, you won't be treated as failing to clearly reflect income if your method of accounting for inventory treats inventory as non-incidental material or supplies, or conforms to your financial accounting treatment of inventories. If, however, you choose to keep an inventory, you must generally value the inventory each year to determine your cost of goods sold in Part III of Schedule C.\n\nSmall business taxpayer.\n\nYou qualify as a small business taxpayer if you (a) have average annual gross receipts of $29 million or less for the 3 prior tax years, and (b) are not a tax shelter (as defined in section 448(d)(3)).\n\nIf your business has not been in existence for all of the 3-tax-year period used in figuring average gross receipts, base your average on the period it has existed, and if your business has a predecessor entity, include the gross receipts of the predecessor entity from the 3-tax-year period when figuring average gross receipts. If your business (or predecessor entity) had short tax years for any of the 3-tax-year period, annualize your business' gross receipts for the short tax years that are part of the 3-tax-year period.\n\nSee Pub. 538 for more information.\n\nTreating inventory as non-incidental material or supplies.\n\nIf you account for inventories as materials and supplies that are not incidental, you deduct the amounts paid to acquire or produce the inventoriable items (treated as materials and supplies) in the year in which they are first used or consumed in your operations.\n\nFinancial accounting treatment of inventories.\n\nYour financial accounting treatment of inventories is determined with regard to the method of accounting you use in your applicable financial statement (as defined in section 451(b)(3)) or, if you do not have an applicable financial statement, with regard to the method of accounting you use in your books and records that have been prepared in accordance with your accounting procedures.\n\nMore information.\n\nFor more information about this exception for small businesses using this method of accounting for inventoriable items, see Pub. 538.\n\nChanging your method of accounting for inventory.\n\nIf you want to change your method of accounting for inventory, file Form 3115. For details, see Line F, earlier.\n\nCertain direct and indirect expenses may have to be capitalized or included in inventory. See Part II, earlier. See Pub. 538 for additional information.\n\nPaperwork Reduction Act Notice.\n\nWe ask for the information on Schedule C (Form 1040) to carry out the Internal Revenue laws of the United States.
