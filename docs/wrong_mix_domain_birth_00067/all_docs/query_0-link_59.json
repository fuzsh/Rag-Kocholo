The intensely hot climate, lack of vegetation, and scarcity of building materials have caused the opal miners to make their homes in caves or in abandoned diggings.\n\nMost of the buildings above the surface are on the Wilson block, where 54-year-old Mrs. Ethel Wilson presides. An opal buyer and ex-miner, she also runs the general store and post office, and has taken over the job of cutting opals done by her husband before he became ill.\n\nWhen an opal-miner comes into her store and puts a handful of sandstone-encrusted stones on her counter she wets her finger and rubs it expertly over the glistening seams of color in the stones.\n\nHer greying, brown hair shows no signs of a salon set, and the sun of 54 eventful years has tanned her skin.\n\nBut in those pale blue eyes there is wisdom and character.\n\nThe buyer never quotes first. She knows that.\n\n\"How much?\" she asks.\n\nIt has taken her a long time to be in the position to utter those two words of inquiry. It took her longer to acquire the steely, fixed, almost frightening gaze that goes with them.\n\nIt's not so long ago since she was on the other side of the counter. She then wore a miner's shoes, wielded a pick. She too, smashed her fingernails as she clawed at the sandstone trying to wrench the opals out.\n\nHer dealings in opals now take her interstate every month at a pace which puts the high pressure businessman of the eastern States in the scooter class.\n\nShe travels usually to Sydney, leaving Coober Pedy on Sunday nights and driving 20 hours straight to Adelaide.\n\nThere she takes a plane early Tuesday morning for Sydney, where she completes her business \"over morning tea\" and catches the afternoon plane back to Adelaide. A day's rest there and the dawn sees her on the track back to Coober Pedy.\n\nShe once missed a Melbourne plane connection. Undaunted, she borrowed a fast car and drove to Melbourne and back to Adelaide in 36 hours.\n\n\"I've got to be back in time to meet the weekly mail on Saturday nights,\" she explained earnestly.\n\nEthel Wilson hasn't always owned the petrol pump, a fine private collection of opal, a powerful six-cylinder car, the store and post office agency at Coober Pedy.\n\nWith her husband and their 10 children, she travelled many miles and did a lot of things before settling at this South Australian desert bonanza.\n\nIt was in the cheapest tourers that she learnt about the by-ways of the Northern Territory - \"There were no highways\" ? the Kimberlys, the Tanami gold fields, Mt. Isa, Arnhem Land, wartime Northern Queensland, Sydney Melbourne, Adelaide.\n\n\"My husband Bert and I and six of the children tackled a 500-mile overland trip from Mataranka to Wave Hill - tough Northern Territory - in 1931 just after 'the wet,' she said.\n\n\"We crossed several flooded rivers and patches on the tubes lifted. To get through, we had to shoot unbranded bullocks and wrap their hides around the wheels in place of the tyres.\n\n\"There were so many of us in the car that trip that the spare tyres on the back touched the ground when we went up a hill. We tied logs on the front of the car to keep the wheels on the road.\"\n\nBorn in Mareeba, Queensland, the daughter of Harry Chatfield - \"the best coach whip of his day\" - Mrs. Wilson married her childhood sweet heart, Herbert Wilson, in 1918.\n\nThey didn't stay in one place long and 1929 found them well established as a \"contracting team\" in the Cape York peninsula country.\n\n\"Bert did the building and maintenance work on stations and I helped in the homestead,\" Mrs. Wilson explained..\n\n\"We did a lot of contract work for the London Mining Trust and late in 1929 moved into the Northern Territory for the first time.\"\n\nIn 1931 they were at Victoria River Downs, then on the Western Australian border.\n\nWith \"nothing to lose and plenty to gain\" they left the border in June that year for William Creek, on the railway line to Alice Springs. They were bound for the flourishing opal fields of Coober Pedy.\n\nThe journey took them through the Tanami goldfields in the tracks of explorer Michael Terry.\n\n\"We were the first family to make it overland after Terry,\n\nGrandmother reigns at desert bonanza\n\nWho travelled with big six wheeled vehicles. The policeman at William Creek nearly died when we drove in and told him where we'd come from.\n\nFreight costs kept travelling expenses high for the family in those days. Petrol cost 50/- for two four-gallon drums; sugar was 1/6 per lb.; flour 1/-; butter 3/6; and tea 5/6.\n\nThe family steered their tourer into Coober Pedy from William Creek on September 13, 1931 - and created another record. It was the first time a car had reached the opal field. All previous traffic had been by camel.\n\nThe couple, with their children, lived, as many still do at Coober Pedy, in a dugout. They gouged in searing heat for six months before striking opal. Their first \"parcel\" brought Â£4 an ounce.\n\n\"We also sold another 220oz. lot for 25/- an ounce. I'd pay Â£12 an oz. for a similar parcel today,\" she said.\n\nWith \"opal in the blood\" the Wilson's spent 1934 at the other South Australian field of Andamooka. They then moved to Melbourne.\n\nBut 1939 saw them homeless at Claremont (Clermont) goldfields in Queensland after their house in the outskirts of the town was burnt out.\n\nWar broke out and the family moved to Charters Towers. There they bought two trucks and worked on aerodromes along the North Queensland coast. Six months later, and with nine children, their transport fleet had grown to six vehicles all working 22 hours a day.\n\n\"We gave up the trucking and bought a cafe in wartime Bowen,\" said Mrs. Wilson.\n\nShe claimed an Australian record for one day's meals there, when 800 R.A.A.F. personnel ate 25 hams, 3cwt. of fish, 1cwt. of steak, and 25 chickens.\n\n\"It nearly surpasses the double sitting here on Saturday nights before the mail arrives,\" she said jokingly.\n\nThe end of the war found her in Sydney with a sick husband. She decided to return to \"the best climate in the world - Coober Pedy.\"\n\nTheir need for transport started her on the first of many visits by plane throughout Australia, which increased soon after she was registered as an opal buyer.\n\n1300-mile trip. \"I DECIDED the bargains in transport were to be had at the military disposals sales in Darwin,\" she said.\n\n\"I flew there and outbid some so-called 'big shots' from the south for a nice three-ton truck.\n\n\"The problem was to get it back to Coober Pedy - 1300 miles away. I decided to drive it myself.\n\n\"Building material was short at the opal fields, so before I left I loaded it with petrol and corrugated iron.\"\n\nThe trip took Mrs. Wilson seven days and, from Alice Springs to Coober Pedy, she crossed dozens of creeks and used every short-cut in the book.\"\n\n\"Everyone seemed amazed to think I was making the trip alone. But I made only one mistake. I followed a dam-sinker from Erldunda station, thinking he was going my way. I ended up at Finke - 100 miles along the wrong track.\"\n\nShe thinks the often heavily sanded track south from Coober Pedy \"a good one.\" Tourists who first see it think of turning back.\n\n\"I've had only one mishap on it,\" she said. \"Early this year my son Ray and I were returning from Port Augusta in a well-loaded 30cwt. truck when a rim flew off a rear wheel in the gibber country.\n\n\"We rolled over and landed back on our wheels, loaded the scattered goods back aboard, and drove home. There's not the comradeship farther south that there is in the Territory, though five cars passed us that day. None stopped.\n\n\"Bogging in wet weather is not as bad down here, either.\n\n\"In 1929 we were trying to reach a waterhole at night in the 'Punjab' district of the Territory and were bogged. In the mud and dark I lost my shoes while trying to push the car. We finally slept in the car all night, tired, hungry, and thirsty. Dawn broke? and the waterhole was only yards away!\n\n\"Tracks were ill-defined, too. A year later we missed a turn on one such track and finished hanging half way over a creek bank with our head lights in the mud. We had to dig the bank away, taking care the car did not slip, and then pull it on to the road.\"\n\nAt Coober Pedy Mrs. Wilson has an almost constant supply of water from a 500,000-gallon Government tank. Food sup plies arrive regularly once a week.\n\nHer prosperous store is the only one for 200 miles south and 500 miles north. She has built one of the two homes on the surface there. She is a member of the Flying Doctor radio network.\n\nHer home is on the main Darwin - Adelaide overland route.\n\n\"I like outback life,\" she said. \"No strikes, gas or electricity worries, and plenty of fresh air and space. You can reconcile yourself to anything and forget loneliness. I've never regretted moving here.\n\n\"More people are needed in this country, and anyone who has the stomach to come out here will make a go of it.\"\n\nThe birthplaces of the Wilson children reflect the travels of the family. Arthur was born at Babinda; Ernest at Tully; Alma and Florrie at Cairns; Phyllis at Mareeba; Rose at Herberton; Joan at Townsville; George at Claremont; Herbert was the first white child born at Coober Pedy, and Ray was born at Port Augusta. Mrs. Wilson smiled happily and added, \"Of course, I'm grandma to another 22.\"\n\nPhoto: SAND is the main feature of the landscape at the opal-mining settlement of Coober Pedy, Central Australia.

Coober Pedy, I was given to understand, was a sad place now. 'Mum' is the only woman on the field, and the little Wilsons long for a greener and more profitable district..\n\nThe Advertiser (Adelaide, SA : Saturday 16 October 1954)\n\nWe made purchases at Mrs. Wilson's store.\n\nParents: Henry CHATFIELD and Ada Eleanor RUSSELL.\n\nSpouse: Herbert \"Bert\" RICHARDS / WILSON.

He died Colon cancer on 26 November 2015 at the age of 39 in Jenison, Ottawa Co., Michigan, USA. After a courageous battle with cancer, Ottawa County Deputy Matthew Alan Chatfield passed away in the arms of his wife on November 26, 2015 at his home in Jenison, MI, at the age of 39. He leaves behind his wife and true love, Heather Chatfield; their sons, Greyson and Gage; their daughter, Karis; and Mattâs beloved spaniel, Bentley.\n\nMatt was born on April 18, 1976 in Onsted, MI, to father Marion Chatfield and mother Linda Chatfield. He grew up in a loving family with his older sister, Marsha, and his younger brother, Michael. Matt was an exceptional athlete who excelled in football, basketball, and track in high school. He brought his considerable athletic talent with him to Grand Valley State University, where he played on the football teamâs offensive line and served as the long snapper. He graduated from GVSU with a degree in Physical Education Pedagogy in 1999.\n\nMatt married classmate Heather Chatfield on May 30, 1998. After graduation, they remained in Georgetown Township, where Matt began his career as a deputy for the Ottawa County Sheriffâs Department. There the couple has lived and raised their three children.\n\nMatt was a dedicated officer with a true passion for serving his community. He poured all of himself into everything he did, including coaching countless youth athletic teams. When diagnosed with colon cancer last year, he remained dedicated to his work in his will to fight his illness. He was still serving as the School Resource Officer for Jenison Public Schools only weeks before he went to meet his savior. He coached his sonâs football team to a championship just a month earlier. He remained a faithful, brave, iron-willed man throughout his life, right up to his final breath.\n\nIt is fitting that Deputy Chatfield passed away on Thanksgiving Day. We are thankful to have had Matt in our lives, even if his stay was not long enough. We are grateful for the legacy he leaves behind, which will be seen daily through his beautiful children and through our wonderful community that he so greatly impacted. He has taught us all so much.\n\nA celebration of Mattâs life will be held at 5 PM Sunday, December 6 at Resurrection Life Church in Grandville, 5100 Ivanrest Ave; all are welcome. Visitation will be held from 12 to 2 PM and 5 to 8 PM Friday, December 4 and 10 AM to 2 PM Saturday, December 5 at Resurrection Life Church. The family would like to thank the community for their unwavering support and continuous prayer. Matt knew how much he was loved; your prayers held him up. Now the Lord lifts him up to heaven. Memories and messages are welcome in the familyâs guestbook online at www.cookcares.com. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be made to a fund for Mattâs childrenâs education at any Lake Michigan Credit Union location for Heather Chatfield and will be administrated by Ottawa County Deputies Association.\n\n=====\n\nUSA Public Records\n\nName Matthew Alan Chatfield\n\nAlso Known As Matth Chatfield\n\nResidence Date 25 Feb 2005-15 Nov 2007\n\nResidence Place Jenison, Michigan\n\nBirth Date 23 Oct 1965\n\nPhone Number 347-8617\n\nPhone Number Recorded Date 20 Aug 2008\n\nAddress 911 Fairwood Ct., Jenison, Michigan 49428\n\nAddress Date 25 Feb 2005-15 Nov 2007\n\n2nd Address 403 N Washington St., Raymore, Missouri 64083\n\n2nd Address Date 30 May 2000-01 Jul 2008\n\n3rd Address 419248 PO Box, Kansas City, Missouri 64141\n\n3rd Address Date 01 Feb 1993-18 Jul 2001\n\nPossible Relatives Heather Lynne Chatfield, Kelly S Chatfield, Marcia Sue Chatfield, Mark D Chatfield, Mark Kelly Dchatfield, Matthewa Chatfield, Norman A Chatfield, Sophia I Chatfield, Susan G Chatfield, Tammy S Chatfield\n\nRecord Number 248998392\n\n-----\n\nUSA Public Records\n\nName Matt Chatfield\n\nAlso Known As Matthew Alan Chatfield\n\nResidence Date 15 Oct 2005\n\nResidence Place Hudsonville, Michigan\n\nBirth Date 15 Jun 1976\n\nPhone Number (616) 669-4968\n\nPhone Number Recorded Date 01 Jan 2009\n\nAddress 6580 Balsam Dr Apt 202, Hudsonville, Michigan 49426\n\nAddress Date 15 Oct 2005\n\n2nd Address 6580 Balsam Dr Apt 201, Hudsonville, Michigan 49426\n\n2nd Address Date 18 Jul 2001\n\n3rd Address 4602 Shepherd Rd., Tipton, Michigan 49287\n\n3rd Address Date 01 Jun 1994-13 Nov 2000\n\nPossible Relatives Heather Lynne Chatfield, Linda Gayle Chatfield, Marion V Chatfield, Marsha L Chatfield, Michael Aaron Chatfield, Richard Lee Chatfield, Viola I Chatfield\n\nRecord Number 296297193\n\nParents: Marion V CHATFIELD and Living.\n\nSpouse: Living.
