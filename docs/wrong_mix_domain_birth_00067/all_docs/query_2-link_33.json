        "text": "World War I\n\nWilson’s second term was dominated by World War I. On April 2, 1917, he reluctantly asked Congress to declare war on Germany in order to make “the world safe for democracy.” To support the war effort, Wilson signed the Selective Service Act, which reestablished a national draft.\n\nThe United States’ involvement in World War I sparked protests. In response, Wilson proposed the Espionage Act of 1917 and the Sedition Act of 1918, which were intended to suppress criticism of the war effort. At the same time, Wilson supported the women’s suffrage movement and endorsed the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment, which gave women the right to vote.\n\nIn January 1918, Wilson went before Congress to outline the country’s goals for peace. Known as the Fourteen Points, one of Wilson’s aims was to create “a general association of nations…affording mutual guarantees of political independence and territorial integrity to great and small states alike.” The proposal formed the foundation for the League of Nations.\n\nAfter the Germans surrendered in November 1918, Wilson traveled to Europe to help secure a lasting peace. One year later, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts. Nonetheless, the Treaty of Versailles, which included the Covenant of the League of Nations, was not universally accepted, particularly at home, where Republicans were staunchly opposed.\n\nIn 1919, Wilson collapsed under the strain of a U.S. public speaking tour to rally support for ratification of the treaty, suffered a series of strokes, and never fully recovered. While those close to Wilson shielded the extent of his incapacity from the public, questions about his fitness to lead the country later prompted the adoption of the 25th Amendment.\n\nDeath\n\nWilson died at his home on February 3, 1924 of a stroke and additional heart-related problems."
