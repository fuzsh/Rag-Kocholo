        "meta_description": "George Thomas Wilson George Thomas Wilson was born in Snodland, Kent County, England on January 24, 1827; the son of William Patten Wilson and Sophia Somerton. The family lived on a fruit ranch that was about thirty-five miles from London. It was there, that he learned to graft trees and shrubs, which gave him the knowledge to be a horticulturist. He grew up sturdy of body and thick of chest with broad but not fat build. It is said, by those who knew him, that he was almost square. He was five feet seven inches tall and his average weight was 196 lbs. He had gray eyes and brown hair. By 1841, he was living away from home, so he probably was away to school. When he was nineteen years old, about 1846, he ran the ten mile marathon in which he set a high track record for England. About a year later, he married Nancy Hackney, her parents were John and Ann Hackney, farmers. George and Nancy's first baby arrived in 1848 and they named her Fannie. Now the family of William Patten Wilson hadn't accepted Nancy as a suitable wife for their son. They felt that she was beneath their class; and this fact, coupled with the prospects of a new frontier in Australia appealed to George's adventurous nature, so they set sail for that far away land in 1850. Fannie was about two years old, and early in the voyage she became ill. A doctor was consulted, and he said that the bacon she constantly requested, would only hasten her death. Fannie still begged for bacon and her parents thought that as long as she was going to die, she may as well die happy, and gave her some. She began to show signs of improvement, so they gave her some more. Surprisingly, the more bacon she ate, the better she became. They docked at Adelaide, which at that time was part of Victoria, in South Australia. On 21 June, 1850 another daughter was born to them. They named her Alice. In 1851, gold was discovered in Bathhurst, which was over 600 miles to the east (near Sydney). George thought it would be a good idea if he were to join in the search for gold, so he traveled the last 500 miles with a pack on his back and a gun on his arm. His success or failure with gold is not known to me; however, while he was there, a bad famine existed, and he walked all of twelve miles to get a beef head to cook with his potatoes. Most of the recent immigrants had come for gold. Before this time, most of the other white people that had inhabited Australia were convicted prisoners that had overcrowded England and who were sent over there to get them out of the way. This prison immigration continued from 1788 to 1853, thus, much of the population was rough, lusty and ready. One always had to keep a constant guard of himself and his possessions. Gradually Australia grew to be a land of milk and honey. In 1852, gold was discovered in Bendigo and Ballarat, which was much closer to Adelaide. However, by 1852, the family had moved to Warnambool, to be closer to the above Gold town. Warnambool was a seaport and it was about 100 wiles to Ballarat and another 100 miles farther inland to Bendigo. This same year a baby boy was born to them. His name was Gersum. He died in infancy and this was their first real taste of personal tragedy. On 18 April, 1854, they had another son whom they named Shem. While George was working at Bendigo, he read a newspaper article which started a chain of events that changed his whole life (The following account is taken from his own writing). About the year 1855, I first heard of Mormonism. Its doctrine being much abused by the editor of a newspaper near Geelong, Australia and answered by the Elder in charge of the Geelong Branch of the Church. I was so impressed with the Elder's arguments, that I could not rest until I went to investigate Mormonism. Though it was the rainy season, I traveled on horseback a little over 200 miles, with nothing of importance happening until I got to the river Bet Bet. The weather was wet and the small river was too high to cross that evening to get to the city of Geelong that was about eight miles away. I concluded to camp for night where I was, and laid me down in my wet clothes hoping to be able to cross in the morning. I had not lain long when a power came upon me as though I were held by some immense weight and a feeling too horrible to describe. It seemed for a time I was doomed to destruction and I began calling upon the Lord to deliver me from the evil power. I had no sooner begun to call upon the Lord than I felt free, and I thanked God for my deliverance. It ceased raining and the little river had fallen by morning, and I was able to pursue my journey. I was in the town before there were many on the street, and the first man I met was able to direct me to where I could find Elder Morris the Elder in charge. I remained with him one week, read books and conversed with him until I was convinced that the doctrines taught were true and I was baptized, I think, in the month of August 1855, by the above named Elder, and I returned home rejoicing. I had experienced the power of evil and also the goodness of God in my deliverance that I could easily believe the truths of the Gospel when I heard it. The rainy season of which he spoke, really is a rainy season, with twenty to fifty inches of rain. Long distance travel is always slow, and sometimes stopped altogether. His wife Nancy, did not share his new ideas on religion, and though interested, was not convinced. A year later she gave birth to their last child and died in doing so. On her death bed she asked that after she died she wanted him to take care of the ordinance work for her that would insure their marriage in the hereafter. The baby died, too. Nancy had a midwife for each child except the last one for which she had a male doctor in attendance. George could not help but think that part of the reason for her death was the doctor's fault. He carried that thought for many years. George must have quit the mines to care for his children. Fannie was seven, Alice was five and Shem was two. In 1856, he was a practicing veterinarian in Warnambool and was called to the John Nye residence to treat a horse that had been gored in the shoulder by a bull. Unfortunately, the horse died, but from this came a close friendship, and the family was eager to learn of the new religion he had just joined. The Nye family, John and Charlotte had four older boys, John, James, Ephriam and Charles; and a girl Emma (born 28 September, 1837) about twenty years old and her two younger brothers Steven and Osborn, the youngest being about four years old. George told them much of this new religion, and they called in an Elder named James Wall who completed their conversion and all the Nye family were baptized by him. He told them that there was a branch of the church in Sydney. The more they talked about it, the more they all wanted to go there. It would be an 800 mile trip overland, and the rains were bad in the months ahead. George had been over most of this route before, and consented to be a guide for the Nye family. They had gone 400 miles when they were bogged down with rains and had to wait until spring to continue on to Sydney. George had been attracted to Emma Nye and she may have been a substantial reason for his traveling with them. He married her, probably in 1857. At any rate, he was a good guide. There was not as much harmony between the Nye parents as could have been desired. Friction was great enough at this point to have Charlotte desirous of leaving John. A divorce was out of the question because of cost as well as inconvenience. Her plan was to take sons John, Ephriam and Osborn with Emma to New South Wales and await the arrival of James and George Wilson who were to follow in a few days. Steven was with his father, John Nye. The plan worked out successfully. When they reached the coast, (son) John Nye and George Wilson formed a partnership and fished commercially for eight months. By all of the boys working another six months, the Nye family was able to collect enough money to book passage on board the 'Milwaukee' bound for San Francisco. George's wife Emma, took their new baby with her. It was a girl whom they named Emma Louisa Wilson, born 15 August, 1858. Leaving George behind was not easy as he longed to join them, but circumstances were not right for him to go at this time. Sometime in the next few years, these things happened, which is first or in what order they came, this historian does not know: 1. He went to New Zealand for a while and returned to Australia. 2. His Grandfather in England was ill and sent for him. Sometime during his life he worked as a sea cook, it may have been at this time, to earn passage to and from England. He had high regard for his Grandfather, Robert Wilson, and was glad to see them and tell them of his new found religion. It was met with general disapproval and, his father, especially was quite unsympathetic. The sick grandfather came to George's aid and told his son that 'George some day would be the salvation of the Wilson family'. They undoubtedly forgot such a statement promptly, but George remembered it because he understood how that prophecy was to be fulfilled. 3. He married Elizabeth Nichols who was born on November 8, 1826 in Temporly, Cheshire, England. On 22 April, 1863, Elizabeth Nichols was baptized and confirmed a member of the L.D.S. Church by George Thomas Wilson. From this fact, it may be that he was instrumental in her joining the church. It seems that some time before this, he also had to have had at least a priest rank or level in the priesthood. It may have been also about this time, that they were married, but this is only supposition. Before April 1867, he had earned enough money to bring his family to the U.S. By this time, his daughter was nineteen and chose to remain in Australia. With Shem, Alice, and wife Elizabeth, he arrived in April 1867. Now that he was in America, he could not reach his goal yet. He wanted to go to Salt Lake City, in Utah Territory, but that was 800 miles away. With his family, he needed provisions and capital that he had not taken on his Australian hikes alone, so they remained in the Sacramento area and he worked cutting redwood trees for a year. By that time he had a wagon and team as well as provisions for his families journey. They started traveling about 1 July, 1868, from Sacramento with two returning missionaries Elders Ephriam Green and Charles Boyden, who had purchased their wagons and teams for the journey home. They traveled in a group for safety. Good fortune was not always with them, however, and nearly all were ill along the way. George was still ill upon his arrival in Salt Lake City on 18 August, 1868. After two weeks in Salt Lake City, he took his family to Ogden (sixty miles north) to live. On 11 June, 1869 he was given a Patriarchal Blessing which promised him many beautiful rewards if he remained faithful to the religion he had embraced. Two months later he was ordained a Seventy of the Melchizedek Priesthood by F. D. Richards and Joseph Young and Brother Musser. On 23 May, 1870, George took his wife Elizabeth to the Endowment House in Salt Lake City and they were married for time and eternity by D. H. Wells. It was a wonderful experience, and the joy they felt in the security of being husband and wife after this life was heartwarming. It was about this time that George had a dream that disturbed him. His first wife Nancy came to him in a dream and just looked at him. Not one word was spoken between them, but she made him understand that the promise he had made to her on her deathbed had not yet been kept. In October 1870 she was sealed to him in the Endowment House with their daughter standing in as proxy for Nancy. He also did ordinance work for his grandparents. In the fall of 1871, they moved to Richfield, Sevier County, and a year later, in November, 1872, George was called by Stake President Joseph A. Young to preside over Home Missionaries Quorum of Sevier County. Richfield was just a new settlement. There was much to do, the organization of civic, church, and family affairs: the building of churches, homes and gardens. Here he used his skill as a horticulturist to propagate trees and shrubs for the residents. Now about this time, there came a situation which, this historian hopes, is understood to the reader as it was understandable to George at this time. There had been a commandment given by God (to the president of the L.D.S. Church) concerning the practice of plural marriage. This commandment was for a select few who would be called to this, much in the same way as they would be called to any other position of the church, by Divine inspiration to those in authority. The plan of plural marriage was of the highest and most perfect form; based on love not lust nor jealousy. This unselfish co operation and love and pooling of efforts and talents was an advantage to many and peace reigned in the homes that lived under this Commandment. There was only about two percent of the church members ever called to live this higher requirement. George was one of those few whose character and faith was worthy of this calling. This was probably hard for him to accept as it was for many others. He was full of faith and by making it a matter of prayer he undoubtedly found the answer and comfort he needed. He had accepted the Gospel as, being the true Gospel of Jesus Christ. He accepted it all to be true, not to take that part which was convenient to him and reject the rest. That is the way he would live it all of it. He and Elizabeth talked it over and with her consent (as was always done throughout the church), he was married to Maren Christina Olson 1 March, 1875 in the Salt Lake Endowment House by W. Woodruff. Christina always went by 'Stena', and only a few knew her full name. She was a rather short woman, with brown hair. She had a pretty face and a kind, lovable disposition; who was always willing to help anyone she could. She was twenty years old when they were married. It is not known to this historian how they met or anything concerning how they chose each other. On January 6, 1874, George received his Naturalization Papers at Provo, Utah. Stena used to sing in the Danish choir at Provo and it may have been there that they met. On 10 October, 1876, George took another wife whose name was Ann Eliza Swenigan, born in Davis County, Indiana. This historian has been unable to find anything as to how they met or any more of her background, it is possible that her family came to Utah because of their religion, as had Stena's family when they immigrated from Denmark in 1869. This marriage took place in the Endowment House by D. H. Wells. Ann Eliza Davis, the widow of Simon Cook Drollinger, who was left with six children and had lost one more child as an infant, became the next wife of George on 8 March, 1877. She was born in Canada and was thirty-four years old at the time. On 1 May, 1877, a son was born to Stena and George in Richfield, Utah; they named him Daniel after her Grandfather, Daniel Nielson. When he was a few months old, he contracted typhoid pneumonia. Stena had watched over him for weeks with little rest. When he seemed to do better she thought she could rest at his side. She slept a little and awakened to find him dead at her side. She felt very bad about this and blamed herself for his death, it was a hard blow to her, and it was years before she could feel right about it. To 'Lizzie' (Drollinger widow), was born, on 12 December, 1877, a daughter they named Miriam Wilson. On 24 March, 1879, Ann Eliza (Swenigan) gave birth to their only child whom they named George Samuel Wilson. In the early part of 1879 (exact date unknown), in Richfield, there was born to wife Lizzie, triplets, one boy and two girls. They were stillborn, but they gave them names of Joseph, Amalita and Lillian. This was quite a setback for all concerned. Even though George had quite a number of children born to his several wives, the death toll was great too; twelve children, six were dead. Per¬haps God had evened the score by giving him the six Drollinger children to rear. He certainly raised them as if they were his own, and was a good father to them, but they always bore the Drollinger name. In the spring of 1879 they moved to Spring Lake in Utah County (Then it was part of salt Lake County). Shortly after that, a baby boy was born to Stena on 12 April, 1879. They named him George Thomas Wilson Jr.. While they lived there George presided over the Sunday School. He was very interested in the ward and took pride in doing a good job. Sometime in 1881, there was born to Lizzie another boy that was stillborn. However, they named him George Earnest Wilson. On 15 July, 1883, there arrived for Stena a baby girl they named Annie Sophia Wilson. Later in that year, the settlement broke up and George was asked by the president of the church, to go to help settle the St. David area in Arizona. The president of the church felt that its people needed to make settlements in outlying districts of Utah, Arizona and Idaho territories to establish strength and greater coverage for this wonderful gospel they practiced and preached. So in October they left Spring Lake by wagon to make this long trip. The following account of the trip is not taken from experience known to be his, but from another writing of that time that undoubtedly was much like his. I add it (including my own comments now and then) as its detail is good and it shows what a great undertaking it was to make such a trip at that time. It is taken from a school study course of Mesa, Arizona called 'Our Town' and deals with its history as well as other developments of that area. Trips were never made alone; there were undoubtedly several others who also had orders to go to St. David who traveled with them. In determining a way to go, they had the advantage of the experience of others who, during the past several years, had gone to Arizona. With the choice of two main routes of travel, George may have decided wisely in the eastern route as it was better established by this time, and the Grand Canyon of the Colorado which could be crossed at Lee's ferry. All using the other route used the 'Vado de Los Padres' or Ute Ford some thirty-five miles above Lee's Ferry. This crossing was almost impossible for wagon and even difficult for saddle horses and pack mules, since the steep rocky incline with steps cut out in the sandstone must be descended before the river could be crossed. Another disadvantage was that the fording of the river could only be done at low water, and often a delay of weeks might occur, before a crossing could be attempted. If the choice was made for the more easterly route they would journey along the Sevier River to Panguitch (the turn off to go to Bryce Canyon is there now) then directly south to Kanab where the Hamblin road between St. George and Lee's Ferry was reached. The route lay then in a westerly direction until the Buckskin Mountains lay across their path (Buckskin Mountains are part of the Kaibab Plateau). By following the dim outline of tracks made by wagons of former immigrants, and sometimes departing from them as better ways of crossing creeks and avoiding extremely rough country were found, the party reached the top of the Plateau. Here they entered a heavily forested area, and although the road was over rather rough ground, it was generally level, and passage could be made without mishap. The problem of supplying the large amount of water needed by the animals was continual, and constant effort made to follow a route where there were springs and water holes. The original road had been made with this thought in mind but even then long stretches were met where water was not available. There was such a distance as it wound through the Buckskin Mountains. As night came on they would decide to make a dry camp so the stock could rest. Each wagon would carry at least one and sometimes two or three barrels of water for cooking and drinking so there was no suffering among the people. Such a small supply was not enough for stock and the following day when House Rock springs were reached the oxen's tongues were lolling out and the rest of the animals showed effects of thirst, too. The flow of the springs were slow and watering of stock went on far into the night. Word of the wonder of the Grand Canyon had long before been brought back to Utah by early travelers of this region, so all members of these traveling parties looked forward to viewing this great Valley, passed quickly and soon they found themselves on the edge of the mighty Colorado River. Despite the fact that the river had been crossed many times, at this point the undertaking was a dangerous one and often a team and wagon were lost, and sometimes men were drowned in its fast muddy waters. It was possible, for this reason that the travelers felt some apprehension. It might have been, too, that the river seemed a dividing line between their homeland and this faraway country. Once on the south side of this there could be no turning back. Nevertheless, they prepared to get the company across. Sometime before their arrival, the operator of the ferry had finished building a large float boat of heavy logs covered with rough planks. Two teams and wagons could be carried at a time. Stretched across the stream which was about 300 feet at this point, was a cable, and by attaching both ends of the flat boat to it by pulleys, the boat could be slowly worked across to the opposite bank. Fortunately for the travelers, this new system replaced a more dangerous method (towing the boat upstream then poling or rowing it across) worked very well, and the entire company, wagons and teams, were transported without mishap. To save ferrying costs, sometimes loose stock swam across. It was often quite a problem to get them all in motion. They would drive stock upstream, borrow a small boat from the ferryman, and tie one of the old horses to it and start towing, coaxing the horse, as he goes the others would follow more readily. Some would panic amid stream and head for the north shore and it would take the efforts of everyone to get the stock across. However thankful the people were at arriving safely on the opposite shore, they were immediately faced with the difficulty which to their minds equaled or outdid the dangers of the Colorado. Running up directly from the bottom of the canyon was a steep dugway out into the face of the sandstone cliff called 'Lee's Backbone' by all who traveled it; The dugway was about a foot wider than the wagon wheels with a sheer wall extending up on one side and a drop with as many as several hundreds of feet below on the other, it is no wonder that the company felt some fear at the task. The women and children walked the entire distance staying close to the inner wall trying to forget the drop just a few feet away. With good luck and care the entire assent could be made without mishap. As if to plague the travelers further, another problem faced the company. At the top of Lee's Backbone, there ran a very steep downward slope of about 600 feet which gradually lessened until almost level ground was reached. Great care must be taken to get the wagons down for if these heavily loaded vehicles ever got out of control they would be broken and the teams injured. After a brief discussion among the leaders the decision was made to begin the short but dangerous trip downward. As the first wagon pulled onto the slope with brakes set and several long ropes extending out behind, every member of the company grew silent with expectation, The children became wide eyed with wonder at this further exciting episode in their long journey. The oxen of the lead team turned slowly toward the slope as if they too, realized the danger. Then as if they felt the push of the wagon behind, braced themselves, half walking, half sliding down the incline. Behind the wagon nearly lost in the cloud of dust, the men of the company threw the weight of their bodies against the pull of the wagon. Sweating and straining, their feet searching for a rock or clump of brush that would give them momentary traction, they worked the heavy vehicle down yard by yard. As they approached the bottom of the incline and the wagon began to run out on the flat the men let go the ropes, with a shout, slapped each other on the back and waved to the others on the hill. The slight slope remaining forced the wagon faster and the oxen broke into a trot. After a short distance the driver brought them to a halt and they stopped with a deep satisfying groan of thankfulness to be through with the task. While the men made their way back up the hill, the children war whooped and wrestled with one another in celebration of the successful event. During the long afternoon wagon after wagon made the descent. In some of the trips, the wagons drug heavy trees that had been cut and tied on the rear axle to cut down speed. A well defined road to Navajo Springs was followed and on to the West side of Echo Cliffs to Willow Springs and turned Westward to the little Colorado. When this tributary was reached it was followed on up past Black Falls and Grand Falls. Here a ford had been in use some time and although some trouble with quicksand the crossing could be made safely. The route then led up the West bank of the 'Little Colorado' to the little settlement of Brigham City. The company pressed on to a point opposite Sunset, near the town of Winslow, then turned West through Sunset pass and across the Mogollon Mountains. Then on they went to Pine Springs near Mormon Lake and on to the head of Beaver Creek, about fifteen miles above Camp Verde. After a short stay here they went across westward to the head of Black Canyon and following the already established road made good time to Phoenix. The George Wilson company arrived on the Salt River December 10, 1883. The trip had been a hard one for everyone. They rather liked the looks of this area, and felt that there were prospects of a good settlement here. George wrote to Salt Lake to the church president to ask permission to stay there instead of continuing on to St. David. It took weeks to get a reply but they waited and rested and helped other settlers when possible. Mesa had just been organized since July 5th of 1883 and had about 300 population and had already had a serious epidemic of smallpox. George probably helped repair the canal as it needed some repair almost every day someplace along the route. For the next seven years when they changed its route and thus lessened the repairing. Permission was granted and they went to work building homes, planting spring gardens and taking up life on a more permanent basis. George built at least one home in Mesa and that stood where the Southern Pacific Railroad Station now stands on third street between McDonald street and Dobson street. He probably built another house next to the first, as 'Stena' and her children lived by themselves there, there may have been more homes for the other wives too. The first homes in Mesa were built of adobe as clay was plentiful -- sawed lumber was 120 miles north at Prescott. Later on brick houses were built. George's last child was born to 'Lizzi' 18 March, 1884. It was a boy, they named Byron. They were very happy that this one lived. Nine children were alive, one died at a few months, six were stillborn and six adopted. His father died in 1884 in England and they contacted him and offered part or all of the family estate of $125,000.00 the terms were under English law for inheritance. He would have to return to England and the family further required that he give up this religion of his. Neither of them interested him and his reply was thusly. 'As far as money is concerned, I don't need it. As far as my religion is concerned, I wouldn't give it up for all the money in England'. Most of the people in Mesa were L.D.S. Church members but there were those others who couldn't understand the plural marriage laws and they ridiculed any that practiced it. In 1885 he was arrested with other men who were living the same law. He was imprisoned for six months and wrote the following letter that was found in the Church Historians Office in Salt Lake City: Desert News 28 September, 1885, Correspondence Prisoners for Conscience sake: Early release of elders, how they feel. Yuma Penitentiary September 29, 1885 Editor of Deseret News, As our time of incarceration is drawing to a close we feel it our duty to return to you our grateful thanks to you for forwarding to us the semi weekly news, which has been a great comfort to us in our isolated condition. We will be at liberty again on the 11th of October 1885. We have I believe born our afflictions patiently, acknowledging the hand of God in bondage as well as in freedom. We have had no one of our faith visit us since we have been here, but we had many sympathetic and encouraging letters from friends in Utah as well as from home. One of our exiled brothers now in Utah sent us a box of apples which was a great treat to us, and many blessings were invoked for him while we were eating them. He shall not lose his reward. Our imprisonment has not lessened our faith in the principles of our holy religion, but we feel like sustaining our families and every true principle of liberty and right, the Lord being our helper. Truth is mighty and will prevail. We feel to pray for our brethren in bonds, together with their families and all the faithful in Israel. Your brothern in the gospel George T. Wilson (signed) A. P. Spillsbury (signed) Wile he was there in prison, he did inlay work on boxes he gave to his families. They were often used for sewing boxes, and this writer has been told that at least three of them are still in his descendants possession. He was released under the condition that he would divorce all but one wife. The one he kept was last wife Lizzie. This writer does not know why she was the one he kept or how that decision was reached, but it may have been that she was favored because of her large family, as by now she had six and the other wives had none, one and two respectively. Therefore, it would have worked more of a hardship on her to try to support her family than it would any of the others. It must have been hard for him to have to part with them and to have them take his children with them. In 1886, Stena and Ann Eliza (Swenigan) took their children and went back to Utah. Stena went with her children to Scipio to be near her brother, John Peter Olson, Ann Eliza went to the Mapleton area east of Provo, and they never saw George Wilson again. Elizabeth (Nichols) had been with him a long time, ever since Australia, and she went to Salt Lake City to live. She had no children. He loved children and especially his own. To have them leave, must have been very hard indeed, his wife Lizzie was good to him and that helped ease his loss. Later that same year on November 18, 1886 his son Shem married Hettie May Allred of Safford, Graham County, Arizona. She was the daughter of early converts to the L.D.S. Church, Reddin Allred and Julia Ann Bates. It is not known just when George went into the butcher shop business, but he had one in Mesa for quite a number of years before he died. There are people alive at this writing who verify this fact that he could dress a pig, and by himself, could take it down from the hooks it hung on, and balance it on his shoulders and carry the 350 lb. carcass and carry it to the meat house. It seems that he kept physically fit until late in life. He was a man of many accomplishments. He was ambidextrous to the point of writing with either hand and used to autograph the books he gave with his signature made with two colors ink at the same time with both hands. Whichever hand he picked up a tool in, that was the hand he used; be it pen, hammer, saw, knife or whatever. He was a carpenter and made a chest of drawers that is now in the possession of Stanley Fuller of Pine, Arizona (son of Miriam Wilson and Alfred Fuller). Stanley also has a painting that George Wilson made. It is a rather large one and shows a black swan on a pool of water, a tree, a monkey and flowers. While it would never win fame, it shows that he not only tried, but did a fairly good job of it. And so it was with most anything he wanted to do. He had the desire to do it well and somewhere along the way he found the ability. Stanley had a very sturdy old rocker that belonged to George. It is a low rocker of high back and lots of fancy spool work on the hardwood pieces, the seat is laced buckskin thong. Quite an interesting piece indeed. Life in Mesa wasn't all work. For recreation they had hay rides, parties to the river for picnics or a dance at neighboring Lehi or perhaps a swim at Davidson's Gates reservoir. Deloys Park just north of town was a good picnic spot. It was a wonderful place for watermelon feeds. Dancing was a form of recreation highly recommended by the L.D.S. Church and that was frequently varied with masquerades and guess who I am? theme. They weren't lavish affairs but they were fun. Such dances as the waltz, Scottish, two step, polka and some square dances, too. The Wilson family were active participants to nearly all dance affairs and even some honors for the best dancing were brought home by them. He loved fine horses like people nowadays take pride in oars, it was his joy to have a fine horse and buggy. He had an accident happen to his most beloved horse when a thin pole or something had pierced its ribs at the side and protruded at the chest. Byron had gone to get the gun to shoot it when George stopped him. 'No, we won't kill him, he's going to get well'. And he did, he lived to be a fine horse again. This was one example of God's granting Georges request for healing. He was often called on to administer to the sick, and great was the faith which helped to give him power to perform this wonderful service for so many. He took his religion very seriously. He had a strong testimony as to the truthfulness of this wonderful gospel. Given a job to do, he was not one to say 'Get somebody else', but would carry out every requirement necessary. This shows in his perfect record of attendance to each and every meeting his position required for a total of seven years without being absent or late. He was Superintendent of the Mesa First Ward Sunday school for a total of seventeen years, and in Stake and Ward callings for the Sunday School alone, he had served over thirty years. On 27 March 1887 he became Superintendent of Sunday School for the Stake. On Jan 22, 1868 he became 4th Superintendent of Mesa Ward. On February 14, 1898 he was called to be Patriarch of that Stake. In 1890, to Church President Willford Woodruff, came a divine revelation called the 'Manifesto', concerning plural marriage; in which it was made known to him that it was no longer required of them to have more than one wife and that they should divorce all but one and comply with the laws of the land. This must have made George feel better to know the action he had taken was in accordance with God's wishes. After this law was put into effect, there was a man who came to George who wanted to have more than one wife and asked what he should do. He could go to Mexico if Arizona would not allow it. George had this to say to him. 'It is no longer advisable for man to have more than one wife. Don't go against the Manifesto, if you do, you will regret it.' The man obeyed George's advice and it was only a short time that he had to wait to see how he really would have regretted the step had he taken it. He could not utter any words when he tried to give a woman a Patriarchal blessing whose morals (unknown to him) made her unworthy of receiving one. He prophesied first Stake headquarters would be St. David instead of Tucson as many believed. He also prophesied that it would be Mesa where the temple was to be built. That prophecy came to pass when the temple site was dedicated 28 November, 1921 later built and final dedication on 23 October, 1927 by President Heber J. Grant. Most people were of the opinion that it would be built in St. David. Lizzie died on 8 April 1896. Since Miriam had married Alfred Fuller 1 April, 1904 there was probably Byron (then only twelve years old) at home. How lonely he was and how much he missed her can only be known to God, but this great truth he knew, that she would be waiting for him as his wife when he was called to the Great Beyond. Sometime after this, he wrote to Elizabeth (Nichols) his former wife, who was in Salt Lake City. She came to him and lived there for the last months or years of her life (it is said that she did not live there very long before she died). Byron saw to it that he got along pretty well and Shem came up from St. David now and then to see him. He became ill in the spring of 1906 and by mutual agreement he went to St. David to live with Shem and Hettie and family. In spite of his illness he was easy to get along with and was loveable. One day Hettie had been to town and someone had made the half joking remark about her family of all girls, 'if all I could have is girls i'd stop having them'. That had been a cutting remark to her. She was proud of her girls and glad she had every one of them. She told this to George. 'Hettie, you are not going to have any more girls. The rest of your family will be boys'. They were too, four of them in the next nine years. George had a funny little superstition of wearing a beard to cure quinsy, besides that he liked it. As the months went on he was a little more unable to get around and was more confined to his bed. He died November 17, 1906 and was buried in St. David, the town he had been asked many years before, to settle. -------------------- The information given here was obtained from the encyclopedia, a trip I took to Arizona to see Stanley Fuller, interviews with Hettie Wilson (Shem's widow), May McCall, Glen T. Wilson and correspondence with June Baraz and Sarah Wilson (Byron Wilson' widow), the Church Historians Office in Salt Lake City, Utah, also records of Temple work done by George T. Wilson, Sr. As writer of this history I must say that it has been an inspiring adventure. Information has come to me from sources I never knew existed before. One thing led to another and even though the dates and figures may be lacking in places I've done the best I could under the circumstances. I hope the reader will understand and appreciate this work as I knew virtually nothing about him. My mother was Annie Sophia Wilson who died twenty years ago and had left Arizona for Utah at the age of three and never saw her father after that, so I had practically no knowledge of him. I hope I have done justice to such a fine ancestor of mine. He is no longer a name on my pedigree chart but my grandfather that both my mother and I missed knowing, and because of it much richness and spirituality was left out of our lives. I pray that this will help get you acquainted with him as I have. May 1, 1956 Ruth Smith -- Addendum by Russell Scott Ogden (great grandson) 1992 -- Reading the above history made me wonder what happened to Emma Nye Wilson, Georges second wife. The above story said she left him in Australia and inferred that they would meet in America at a later date. From family group sheets researched by James Arden Ogden, we find that Emma Nye married and was sealed to someone else after arriving in Utah (she was sealed to Erastus Sanford Bingham 13 Dec, 1862). This was about four years after George and Emma's daughter was born in Australia. George arrived in Utah 18 August, 1868 with his third wife Elizabeth Nichols who he married in England sometime between 1858 and 1867 (he baptized her April, 1863). We do not have a group sheet on Elizabeth. I wonder what constituted divorce in those days? Travel to another country without your mate? Another note of interest is that George was 48 years old when he married Maren Chritana Olson. She was 18. | BillionGraves",
