        "text": "Enslaved people are chiefly represented in this series by lists of names, bills of sale, deeds, and receipts for medical care and for jailing people who had been caught after self-emancipation from slavery, a status then described as fugitive or runaway. There are also letters in 1832 concerning the manumission of six people enslaved by Hairston who were sent to Liberia through the work of the American Colonization Society.\n\nMost of the papers from the period 1751 to 1788 are those of Peter Hairston (1752-1832) and consist mainly of legal papers relating to his role as a deputy sheriff of Henry County, Va. These papers include letters to Hairston from other county officials; warrants from justices of the peace to him; memoranda and receipts of several Henry County sheriffs, including himself and his father, Robert Hairston (d. 1783), listing monies collected for taxes and carried to Richmond, Va.; and bonds between various people. His own legal papers also include receipts, bonds, warranty deeds, and bills of sale, all for the purchases of enslaved people and land.\n\nMost of the papers from 1789 to 1813 are business correspondence of Peter Hairston (1752-1832) and Peter Wilson (1770-1813), the latter being the son-in-law of the former. There are letters to both of them from numerous Petersburg, Va., merchants about the arrival of new merchandise in their stores, the condition of the Petersburg market, Hairston and Wilson's accounts with these merchants, and the latest political news. There are also many financial papers for this period consisting of accounts for goods bought by Peter Wilson and Peter Hairston, some for large quantities of merchandise for their stores and others for smaller quantities of merchandise bought for plantation or personal use. Together they show patterns of buying and selling between both Wilson and Hairston and various general and commission merchants in Lynchburg, Richmond, and Petersburg, Va. Included among the financial papers are bills of sale for people enslaved by Peter Wilson and Peter Hairston.\n\nThe papers from 1814 to 1832 are principally those of Peter Hairston (1752-1832) and his nephews, Robert Hairston (1783-1852) and Samuel Hairston (1788-1875), the sons of George and Elizabeth (Perkins) Letcher Hairston. The papers are almost entirely business correspondence and financial and legal papers of the three men. Among the business correspondence are letters to Peter Hairston from his daughter Ruth Stoval (Hairston) Wilson about the management of her plantation following Peter Wilson's death in 1813 until her marriage to Robert Hairston around 1816. There are also letters to Samuel, Robert, and Peter Hairston from Lynchburg, Petersburg, and Richmond, Va., and Fayetteville, N.C., merchants. All three men produced large quantities of tobacco and sold it through commission merchants in Lynchburg while Peter Hairston sold his flour and cotton in the Fayetteville market. Also included are five letters in 1832 from R. H. Toler, William M. Rives, R. R. Gurley, and John McPhail to Robert Hairston about the American Colonization Society and the manumission of six people enslaved by Hairston who were sent to Liberia. The majority of the legal papers are related to the case of Robert Hairston v. Joel, Elisha, and William Estes, a suit concerning the sale of Robert Hairston's tobacco through the Estes commission business, which appears to have lasted from 1818 to 1829. Additional legal papers consist of bills of sale for enslaved people, deeds for land purchases, property tax payments, and jailers' bills for keeping enslaved people who had self-emancipated (and who at that time would have been called fugitives or runaways). The financial papers for this period are chiefly Samuel, Robert, and Peter Hairston's accounts with Lynchburg, Petersburg, Richmond, and Fayetteville merchants for their crop sales and for general merchandise. There are also receipts for tobacco hauled to these markets, doctors' bills for attending to enslaved people, and bills for construction in 1823 of the Oak Hill home of Samuel Hairston. Miscellaneous material includes minutes of the Sandy Creek Baptist Association, 1825-1829.\n\nThe papers from 1833 to 1880 are principally those of Samuel Hairston (1788-1875), Robert Hairston (1783-1852), Ruth Stoval (Hairston) Wilson Hairston (1783-1869), and Peter Wilson Hairston (1819-1886). Most of the papers from 1833 to 1860 are business correspondence and financial papers. These papers include letters, bills, and receipts from numerous Danville, Lynchburg, Petersburg, and Richmond, Va., merchants about the sale of tobacco, cotton, wheat, and flour crops; merchandise the Hairstons ordered; and occasional political news. Much of the personal correspondence from 1833 to 1860 is that of Peter Wilson Hairston, with earlier correspondence pertaining to student life at the University of North Carolina and the University of Virginia and later correspondence concerning plantation management. From 1860 to 1865, there are few items, mostly letters from Peter Wilson Hairston to Samuel Hairston concerning the management of Cooleemee Plantation and scattered letters to Samuel Hairston from Confederate soldiers and officers concerning, respectively, gifts of money for their families and the purchasing of crops for the troops. From 1866 to 1880, there are primarily financial papers consisting of bills and receipts for general merchandise bought by Samuel Hairston and Ruth Stoval (Hairston) Wilson Hairston from Danville, Va., merchants and from Herbert Hairston, Peter Wilson Hairston's business partner in Baltimore, Md., and accounts of tenants at Royal Oak and Brierfield farms. Miscellaneous material includes minutes, 1833-1868, of the Mayo Baptist Association, the County Line Baptist Association, and the Staunton River Baptist Association.\n\nThe papers from 1881 to 1928, comprising about one-fourth of the Wilson and Hairston Papers, consist primarily of the professional and personal correspondence of Alfred Varley Sims (1864-1944), husband of Ruth (Hairston) Sims (1863-1936). During Sims's early life, 1881-1894, the papers are mainly the professional correspondence between himself and the employees of the following railroads: the Atlantic and Danville Railway Company; the Virginia and Kentucky Railroad Company; the Utah, Nevada and California Company; and the Utah and Los Angeles Air Line Railway Company. Related to this business correspondence are estimates and accounts for work and materials used in railroad construction.\n\nFrom 1895 to 1904, Alfred Varley Sims taught engineering at the State University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa, only occasionally returning to Virginia during the summers to manage Berry Hill. Approximately three-fourths of the correspondence for this period is letters from his overseers about management of Berry Hill. Personal correspondence from 1895 to 1904 includes letters, telegrams, and eulogies written by and to numerous people about the death of Charles Schaeffer, president of the University. Schaeffer was a close associate of Alfred Varley Sims, who may have headed a memorial committee for Schaeffer.\n\nIn 1904, after Sims's resignation from the State University of Iowa, there are letters between William Sowden Sims (1858-1936), brother of Alfred Varley Sims; Charles Page Perin, a New York consulting engineer; and Alfred Varley Sims about his chances for an engineering position with the Knickerbocker Trust Company of New York. William Sims served as a naval aide to President Theodore Roosevelt (1908-1909), served on the staff and was president of the Naval War College in Newport, R.I. (1911-1913, 1916, 1919-1922), and commanded the United States Fleet in European waters (1917-1918).\n\nFrom 1905 to 1908, Alfred Varley Sims lived in Guantanamo, Cuba, while serving as chief engineer and general manager of the Cuba Eastern Railroad Company. While working for the Cuba Eastern Railroad Company, Sims also assisted the other numerous subsidiary companies of the Knickerbocker Trust Company: the Cuba Hardwood Company, the Cuba Exploration Company, the Northeastern Cuba Railroad Company, the Guantanamo City Land and Development Company, the La Maya Valley Land and Improvement Company, the Confluente Sugar Company, and the Havana Post Publishing Company. There is detailed correspondence between Alfred Varley Sims and officers of these companies. In 1907, several of the subsidiary companies were consolidated under the Fidelity Commercial and Trading Company, and there is much correspondence between Sims and officers of this holding company. Some of the Cuba correspondence is in Spanish, but most of the items have accompanying translations. In the fall of 1908, Sims left the Cuba Eastern Railroad Company because he was angered over mismanagement charges against him. At the end of 1908, there is an important cover letter referring to Sims's defense of himself. Personal correspondence, from 1905 to 1908, includes letters between J. D. Sutliffe and Sims detailing farm management; letters to Sims and his wife from Danville, Va., real estate agents about maintenance of her property; and numerous letters from Sims to American automobile, furniture, and bobbin companies. In 1908, Sims was looking for additional income and wrote these companies to interest them in purchasing Cuban wood.\n\nFrom 1909 to 1916, Alfred Varley Sims lived in Virginia and personally managed Berry Hill farm. Most of the correspondence is from Sims to numerous manufacturers about new farm products he ordered; from Sims to J. D. Setliffe and later R. H. Ross, another manager of Berry Hill, about farm management; from Sims to prospective tenants; to Sims from wheat and corn mills in Danville, Va.; and from Sims to the Superintendent of the Danville and Western Railroad about the building of a depot near Berry Hill. Although Sims was not employed with the Cuba Eastern Railroad Company after 1908, he continued to be embroiled in its sister companies' problems. F. C. Walcott and R. D. Evans wrote Sims about the legal cases concerning the Cuban companies and his testimony. Writing to a New York tailor on 12 December 1909, Sims told the tailor he was unable to pay his bill and was considering declaring bankruptcy. From 1908 Sims had been receiving warning notices about the thousands of dollars he and his wife owed on stocks. There is also correspondence between Sims and Henry J. Boekelman of the Concrete Construction and Realty Company of New York, later called the Boekelman Construction Company. This correspondence begins in 1910 and continues until 1914. Boekelman possibly served as a broker for some of the Cuban companies Sims worked with from 1905 to 1908. Boekelman solicited Sims's help in the selling of the Cuba Eastern Railroad Company and possibly other sister companies. For much of 1914, Sims lived in London, England, attempting to interest English concerns with the purchase. Sims also maintained correspondence with his brother, William Sims, about topics such as United States naval power, William Sims's command of the U.S.S. Minnesota, and his year as a naval aide to President Roosevelt.\n\nFrom 1917 to 1928, there are scattered correspondence and receipts. Sims, in 1917, moved to New York City, N.Y., to work as an independent civil engineer, and his correspondence primarily consists of letters between himself and C. L. Finney about Berry Hill farm management; between himself and various Virginia merchants about his tenants' accounts and crops; and letters from his brother, William Sims, particularly about his service as special naval representative and observer to Great Britain and his travels in Ireland, England, and France.\n\nUndated papers are arranged roughly by type in the following order: correspondence, lists of enslaved people, financial papers, legal papers, genealogical papers, writings, and miscellaneous papers. Under correspondence,letters written by individual Wilsons and Hairstons are filed first, then there is undated correspondence according to century, including the papers of Alfred Varley Sims.\n\nEnslaved people are represented chiefly in lists of names found in the store books, sometimes with information about clothes and other provisions given to each person; also of note are an enslaved girl who is documented in a receipt that marked her purchase, and the mention of three men who had self-emancipated from slavery (and who at that time would have been called fugitives or runaways).\n\nVolumes 1-26, covering the years 1780-1828, are accounts of general merchandise such as groceries, rum, hardware, dry goods, writing supplies, and china mainly purchased on credit. The name of Peter Hairston appears in most of the volumes. Joseph Winston was a business partner of Peter Hairston, February 1785-December 1785, and Winston's name appears in the volumes for 1785. Hairston operated a general merchandise store and a blacksmithing ship at Sauratown, his plantation in Surry County, later Stokes County, N.C. The store books list enslaved people, livestock, crops, and land, all bought and sold by Peter Hairston, as well as general merchandise accounts. The volumes are of three principal types: the daybook, an informal chronological record of transactions that later may have been transferred to journals and ledgers, listing articles purchased, person making purchases, and amount owed; the ledger, a formal record of transactions arranged by name of purchaser, listing purchases or only amount charged for a day or month; and the shop book, a daybook listing blacksmithing work performed, person requesting the service, and amount owed. Enclosures for the store books include lists of livestock or crop sales, lists of names, and correspondence about the plantation, accounts, and crops.\n\nVolumes 27-53, covering the years 1790-1817, are accounts of general merchandise such as groceries, rum, hardware, dry goods, writing supplies, and china. Peter Wilson's name and Rockingham County appears on most of these volumes. Wilson, in partnership with his father John of Pittsylvania County, Va., ran a general merchandise store in Rockingham County, N.C. Enclosures for these volumes include a tobacco account, a clothing account for Mead and William Wilson, orphans of Peter Wilson, deceased (not the Peter Wilson of Volumes 27-53), list of money owed and paid to persons listed, and correspondence requesting merchandise or authorizing transfer of merchandise.\n\nVolumes 54-112, covering the years 1773-1857, are memo books. The format of these books is informal, most entries are not dated, or, if dated, are not in chronological order, and most of the books belonged to Peter Hairston or Peter Wilson. In his memo book, Peter Hairston made brief notes of Sauratown store accounts that he later transferred to ordered account books. His memo books also list crops, livestock, travel expenses, money borrowed and lent by him, and tax payments. Hairston owned several plantations in Stokes and Pittsylvania counties, such as Royal Oak, Bostick Lower Place, Upper Place, Muddy Creek, Terrell's Place, Bradley's Place, Town Place, and Smith's Place, and the memo books contain information about them. In his memo book, Peter Wilson noted some store accounts from his general merchandise business that he later transferred to ordered account books. He listed general merchandise to purchase in Petersburg, Va., for his stock and for specific people, travel expenses, cash payments for his store goods, cash lent by and paid to Wilson, and legal settlements of store accounts. In addition, Wilson listed various persons' tobacco crops possibly transported to market and marketed by him or received as payment for store accounts. Peter Wilson also owned several plantations such as Berry Hill, Brierfield, and Goose Pond. Certain memo books list crops, livestock, and tools from his plantations. Enclosures for the memo books include correspondence about plantation matters, lists of livestock and tools on various plantations, tobacco accounts, lists of tobacco crops, and a copy of a receipt for purchase of an enslaved girl (Volume 98).\n\nVolumes 113-134, covering the years 1780-1891, are of various types as indicated.\n\nVolumes 135-156, covering the years 1884-1919, are correspondence and memo books of Alfred Varley Sims, professor, civil engineer, and husband of Ruth Hairston Sims. Also included are farm accounts and labor records for Berry Hill, Brierfield, and Royal Oak farms; such volumes were kept by or for Alfred Varley Sims by farm managers or tenants. Harden Hairston's name appears in some of these volumes. He was the agent for the estate of Agnes J. P. Hairston and probably assisted his sister, Mrs. Alfred Varley Sims, in managing her portion of the inheritance. Enclosures include bills for general merchandise, lists of crops, and agreements, and correspondence about farm matters from the engineering career of Alfred Varley Sims.\n\nVolumes 157-163, covering the years 1859-1909, are of various types as indicated. These volumes were an addition to the Wilson and Hairston Papers as of 17 April 1978.\n\nRailroad Engineering Volumes 1-44, covering the years 1889-1903, consist of level books, field books, transit books, and notebooks from Alfred Varley Sims's civil engineering work for railroad companies."
