Jean and David had six children, probably in Mecklenburg Co, and with Sallie he had six more. Jean’s children moved to Sumner Co TN where David died in 1803. They mostly married and settled in Sumner Co, then many moved to TX. Sallie’s children probably mostly remained in NC. David was a Major and was an officer of the War of Independence. For his service received from the State of North Carolina, a track of land in Sumner Co TN, where he settled. He was a member of the Territorial Assembly in 1794, and was the Speaker of the House of Representatives. He was a magistrate of Sumner County as early as 1787. His residence was about two miles east from Gallatin. He was a valuable member of the new settlement, and took an active part in all public affairs and in the Indian wars. Wilson County was so named in his honor, although Major Wilson never lived in Wilson Co. David C Wilson’s and Jean Rowan’s children are shown under Jean’s biography.\n\nf. John Wilson was born in 1745 in Anson Co NC, lived in Rowan Co, and died in 1804 in Carter Co TN. He perhaps married twice. The second wife was Elizabeth Harris, married in 1876 in Mecklenburg Co. She was born there in 1742 and died in Sumner Co TN in 1804. They had twelve children, born in both Mecklenburg Co NC, VA, and in Sumner Co TN-\n\n1. James S Wilson, b 1765 in Mecklenburg Co.\n\n2.

Mary Wilson was born in 1752 in Anson Co NC, in the part which became Mecklenburg Co in 1762. She married Robert Harris about 1769 in Mecklenburg Co. He was born in 1737 in Cabarrus Co NC, and died there in 1803. They had three children born in Mecklenburg Co. (W)\n\nh. Martha Wilson was born in 1754 in Anson Co NC, in the part which became Mecklenburg Co in 1762. She died in Mecklenburg Co in 1843. Martha married Stephen Alexander in 1771 in Mecklenburg Co. He was born in 1749 in Mecklenburg Co and died there in 1831. They had seven children born in Mecklenburg Co and in Somerset Co MD. (W)\n\ni. Margaret Wilson was born in 1758 in Anson Co NC, in the part which became Mecklenburg Co in 1762. Nothing else is known of her. (W)\n\nZacheus Wilson, born in the 1750s, lived in Marshall Co TN in 1820, and soon after moved to Henderson Co in West TN. Some of his sons (and daughters?) also moved there. There is a marriage in Sumner Co dated 24 November 1790 to Elizabeth Wilson [R2c4]. The Zacheus of this marriage was born in the 1760s, and Elizabeth Wilson was a daughter of David Carroll Wilson (Sr) and Jean Rowan. This Zacheus died in 1814 in Sumner Co. In 1820 the Zacheus Wilson in Sumner Co, husband of Sarah _____, was age 45 or older (born in 1775 or before), as was his wife, and in their home there was just one young woman, age between 16 and 26. Zacheus’ birth date is extimated to be in the 1750s since his son Samuel’s gravestone and the History of Henderson Co TN state that Zacheus was a Revolutionary soldier, and son Samuel was born in 1776. Hence, Zacheus was at least age 16 in 1776 to have fought in the Revolution, and was probably born in the 1750s to be the father of Samuel who was born in 1776. When Henderson Co in western TN was opened to settlers in the late 1810s, and became a county in 1821, there were three or more brothers who moved to the Henderson Co area in the late 1810s and early 1820s. The proof that Sarah Brevard and William Wilson [R2c3] who married in Sumner Co was the same Wilson family in Henderson Co does not agree with cemetery records. The husband of the Sarah in Henderson Co in 1830 had died soon before 1830, probably in Henderson Co since Sarah was living there in 1830, and because the history of Henderson Co states that Zacheus and his son David moved to Henderson Co in the 1820s after son Samuel had already moved there by about 1818.\n\nSarah’s next door neighbors in 1830 were John A Wilson and Samuel Wilson, both born in the 1790s and known to be sons of Zacheus Wilson. The Sarah in the 1830 census was born in the 1760s, and was the widow of Revolutionary soldier Zacheus. Since she had a son Zacheus born in the late 1770s, then Sarah must have been born about 1760.\n\nIn Sarah’s home in 1830 in Henderson Co were one male born in the 1800s and one female born in the 1810s (a granddaughter? or a daughter-in-law?). Son Archibald was already married and was living in his own home in Henderson Co. Arch’s next door neighbor in 1840 was Zacheus Wilson, born in the 1770s; he was probably Sarah’s son. This Zacheus Wilson was born in the 1780s, per the 1830 census, or born in the 1770s, per the 1840 census, so his birth date must have been close to 1779.\n\nFrom cemetery records of Henderson Co, in the Zacheus Wilson family cemetery (there is a second, smaller, Wilson family cemetery in Henderson Co), is the grave of Samuel Wilson, Sarah’s next door neighbor in 1830. Samuel’s gravestone says “Consort of Fanny Gist / Son of Zacheus, Revolutionary Soldier / 1776 - 1843.” It would appear that Sarah was the mother of Samuel since she was old enough to be his mother, and they lived next door in 1830. From Goodspeed’s 1888 History of Tennessee, it tells of both Samuel Wilson and Dr John A Wilson who were early pioneers of Henderson Co; it did not mention Sarah’s husband by name. Samuel Wilson settled on 726 acres in what was to become Lexington, TN, with his cabin located where the United Methodist Church of the 1880s was. David Wilson and (father) Zacheus Wilson soon after 1820 joined Samuel in Henderson County and settled north of what became Wildersville. There they shared their previous experiences in local government. Another Wilson brother originally settled near what is now Sand Ridge, not finding sufficient water, then moved further west to a branch of Forked Deer River. He became the ancestor of many Wilsons in that part of the county. Samuel came to Henderson County from Wilson County, where he and his brother David, together with their father Zacheus, had helped found that county. He also obtained other land grants in 16 counties.\n\nIn 1819-1820, as soon as it became known that the Chickasaw Indians had ceded all West Tennessee lands to the United States, settlers entered newly created Henderson Co regularly. Shortly after Samuel Wilson settled at what is now Lexington, Dr. John A Wilson settled near there, becoming the first doctor and first professional man to settle in the county. He also became the first merchant, fur buyer, and county court clerk, and he operated a farm with the help of slaves. Dr Wilson trained two female slaves to serve as mid-wives. His fee for a house call was 50 cents regardless of the distance and time of day. Payments were made in anything salable, such as beaver or fox skins, beeswax, tallow, or produce.\n\nSo from the Goodspeed History of Tennessee, and from the larger of the two Wilson family cemeteries in Henderson Co, we can piece together the probable family of this Zacheus Wilson and his wife Sarah-\n\na. Samuel Wilson, born 1776 died in 1843 in Henderson Co TN. He had married Fanny Gist. They probably had a son David H Wilson-\n\n1. David H Wilson, b 8 Sep 1804 in TN, and died 22 December 1884 in Henderson Co TN. His wives and descendants are buried in the Zacheus Wilson family cemetery in Henderson Co. In 1830 David lived two doors from his uncle Zacheus Wilson in Henderson Co. David married three times: Matilda _____, who was born 30 April 1809 and died 1 September 1840. She was buried next to David H; her gravestone says “Wife of David.” David then married Elizabeth Ann _____. She was born 12 November 1806 in VA and died 10 May 1853 in Henderson Co. Her gravestone says “Wife of David” and she was the wife with David in the 1850 census. David then married a third time, to Frances E _____. Her gravestone says “Feb 22, 1820 - Apr 1, 1876.\" David’s children, from the 1840 and 1850 census, were all born in TN; the first six were children of Matilda and the next three were children of Elizabeth-\n\na. Louisa Wilson, b 1828 (338jkn)\n\nb. Asa M Wilson, b 1831 (338kn)\n\nc. son Wilson, b 1831-1835 (338k)\n\nd. dau Wilson, b 1831-1835 (338k)\n\ne. William Wilson, b 1835 (338kn)\n\nf. Margaret L Wilson, b 1837 (338kn)\n\ng. Permelia Wilson, b 1844 (338n)\n\nh. Sophia F Wilson, b 1846 (338n)\n\nj. Susan E Wilson, b 1848 (338n)\n\nCyrus Wilson, born in 1815, was shown last in the 1850 census in David’s household. Because of his birth date, he probably was not a son, but was instead a younger brother of David, or a nephew. In David’s home in 1830 there were two male teens, born between 1811 and 1815. Six doors away in 1830 was Joseph Wilson, born between 1811 and 1815, and a wife(?) born in the 1800s.\n\nArchibald Wilson, son of Sarah, lived six doors away in 1840. Arch’s uncle Zacheus Wilson lived two doors away in 1830. (55, 338jknc)\n\nb. Zacheus Wilson, b abt 1779 and lived in Henderson Co in the 1830s and 1840s. The ages of their children indicate that they married in the late 1800s. In 1820 he was in Sumner Co, age between 1776 and 1794. His wife was of the same age. There are three Zacheus Wilson marriages in early Sumner Co. The first one was in 1790, so was probably not the son of Revolutionary war Zacheus, unless that son was born around ten years earlier than the 1779 estimate. But the other two may be Zacheus Jr’s: one was on 6 November 1824 to Keziah Stone, and the next one was with Mary Clark on 15 January 1829. There was obviously a fourth marriage of about 1805, not yet found, to account for the children shown below. In their home in 1820 were seven children-*\n\n1. son Wilson, b 1805-1810 (337i)\n\n2. son Wilson, b 1811-1820 (337i)\n\n3. dau Wilson, b 1811-1820 (337i)\n\n4. son Wilson, b 1811-1820 (337i)\n\n5. dau Wilson, b 1811-1820 (337i)\n\n6. son Wilson, b 1811-1820 (337i)\n\n7. son Wilson, b 1811-1820 (337i) (337i,338jk)\n\nc. David Wilson, married Jinny Carothers in Sumner Co on 9 May 1804 and moved to Henderson Co in the 1820s. (55,337m)\n\nd. John A Wilson, b 1790s, was a pioneer doctor of Henderson Co TN. He married a woman born in the early 1800s; they had children and lived in Henderson Co in 1840-\n\n1. son Wilson, b 1821-1825 (338k)\n\n2. son Wilson, b 1821-1825 (338k)\n\n3. dau Wilson, b 1826-1830 (338k)\n\n4. son Wilson, b 1826-1830 (338k)\n\n5. son Wilson, b 1831-1835 (338k)\n\n6. son Wilson, b 1831-1835 (338k)\n\n7. son Wilson, b 1836-1840 (338k) (55,338k)\n\ne. Archibald Wilson, b 12 Jun 1797 in Sumner Co, died 31 July 1852 in Henderson Co. He married twice. His first wife was Elizabeth Cannon or Carron, married in Wilson Co on 6 April 1818. She must have died soon after because Arch then married Cynthia L Johnson in Wilson Co on 13 September 1821. She was born in Nash Co NC on 3 January 1802, and died 23 December 1872 in Henderson Co. In 1840 in Henderson Co, living next door was Zacheus Wilson, born in the 1770s. Arch and Cynthia had ten children, all born in Henderson Co TN-*\n\n1. Nathan Cecil Wilson, b 10 January 1824 in TN, died 3 August 1877 in Dunklin Co MO. He married Clarissa Harriet Derryberry from Henderson Co TN. She was born 1 November 1828, and died 9 September 1902 in Dunklin Co MO. Living next door in 1850 was Abraham Derryberry and his wife Mary, from NC and GA. Both were age 56, so were of age to be Clarissa’s parents. Nathan and Clarissa had two sons by 1850. (338n)\n\n2. son Wilson, b 1826-1830 (338jk)\n\n3. son Wilson, b 1826-1830 (338jk)\n\n4. son Wilson, b 1826-1830, was shown as a daughter under age 5 in 1830. (338jk)\n\n5. son Wilson, b 1831-1835 (338k)\n\n6. Abijah Wilson, b 1834 (338kn)\n\n7. Palma Wilson (dau), b 1836 (338kn)\n\n8. Matthew Wilson, b 1840 in Henderson Co TN. (338n)\n\n9. Elias Wilson, b 1843 (338n)\n\n10. Archibald Wilson, b 1846 (338n)\n\nf. son Wilson, b 1800s, was still in Sarah’s home in 1830. (338j)\n\ng. dau Wilson, b 1811-1815, was still in Sarah’s home in 1830, or else she may have been a daughter-in-law. (337i,338j)\n\nWilson Co is the county just south of Sumner Co."
