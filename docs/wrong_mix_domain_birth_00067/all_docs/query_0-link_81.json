        "text": "If you like a little history with your day trips, the boyhood home of John Wilkes Booth is less than an hour from Wilmington.\n\nTucked away down a country winding lane 13 miles from I-95’s Havre de Grace exit, the Gothic Revival cottage looks like it’s straight out of a storybook. Visitors walk right by the tiny second-story balcony with a jigsaw balustrade without realizing young Booth used it as a stage to practice Shakespeare.\n\nIn the 20th Century, Woodrow Wilson and H.L. Mencken drove up the lane to visit. Already this year, close to 600 tourists have followed in their footsteps.\n\nThe grounds are so lush that Booth’s grandfather dubbed the place Robinson Crusoe’s island, but, today, a string of closely spaced large new homes sits yards away.\n\nThe 1 ½-story home with its gabled roof and diamond-patterned window panes is on the National Register of Historic Places, but not because of its most infamous resident.\n\nThe designation honors the assassin’s father Junius Brutus Booth and older brother Edwin Booth, two of the top Shakespearean actors on the 19th Century stage.\n\nThe Bel Air farm was a star’s country home circa 1840. Junius and Mary Ann Booth and their 10 children first lived in a log home on the 177-acre farm. Junius designed a meandering pond for his children to swim in. Visitors today drive past it on their approach to the house.\n\nJunius was at his happiest when theaters closed for the summer and he could spend long days on the farm with his children and Mary Ann.\n\nMary Ann was his second wife — and he was still married to his first. Today, talk show hosts would refer to the Booths as a dysfunctional family. At 25, Junius Booth was a popular young actor on the London stage when he met a beautiful 18-year-old selling flowers outside the Royal Opera House. He already had a wife and toddler son in London, so he convinced his pregnant new love to elope to America and he convinced his legal wife he was going on an extended tour in America.\n\nWith Junius faithfully sending money home, the ruse worked until 1842, when his son in London was old enough to travel to the U.S. When the young man learned he had 10 American half-siblings, the jig was up.\n\nAdelaide Dellanoy Booth won a divorce from Junius on the grounds of adultery in 1851. John Wilkes’ 13th birthday on May 10, 1851, was a double celebration of sorts. It was also his parents’ wedding day.\n\nThe Booth children roamed the forests and farm fields near their log cabin outside Bel Air. Edwin was a slight, studious boy, but the more athletic John Wilkes became an avid horseman, an agile boxer, a clever practical joker, handy at billiards, an exceptionally skilled swordsman and a crack shot with both hands.\n\nIn 1850, Junius and Mary Ann hired workers to erect a larger house in a locust grove just uphill from the log home where most of their children were born. They hired James Gifford, who drew the plans for Ford’s Theatre in Washington. One of his carpenters was Edman Spangler, later convicted in the conspiracy to kill President Lincoln.\n\nJunius found the plans for the home in an 1847 book. He chose the one titled “The Parsonage.” He never got to live in it, though.\n\nHe died on tour in 1852, shortly before the house was finished.\n\nIt was hard times on the farm after Junius’ death because Mary Ann Booth didn’t lose just her husband – she also lost his nearly $5,000-a-year paycheck.\n\nWhen Gifford was not paid on time, he temporarily tore the tin roof off the new house.\n\nWithin a few years, though, Edwin’s fame surpassed his father’s, and the Booths were back in the money. Mary Ann sold the house in 1878.\n\nThe home’s later owners all became accustomed to the occasional visitor wandering down their lane and asking to see the house where the Booths lived. In 2006, Harford County purchased the property after it failed to garner the minimum bid at auction.\n\nThe Junius B. Booth Society, an all-volunteer organization, turned the first floor into a museum. The society runs the tours and lectures there.

Became a successful theater manager. Died 1883.\n\nRosalie Booth (called Rose) – Born 1823 at the farm. Suffered from spinal sclerosis. Died 1889.\n\nHenry Bryon Booth – Born 1825 at the farm. Died 1836 of smallpox.\n\nMary Ann Booth – Born 1827. Died 1833 of cholera.\n\nFrederick Booth – Born 1829 at the farm. Died 1833 of cholera.\n\nElizabeth Booth – Born 1831 at the farm. Died 1833 of cholera.\n\nEdwin Thomas Booth (called Ned) – Born 1833 at the farm. Became the most renowned 19th Century Shakepearean actor on the American stage. Owned the Walnut Street Theatre in Philadelphia and the Booth Theatre in New York City. Died 1893. Ironically, his coffin was carried to the hearse in New York City at the precise moment that Ford’s Theatre in Washington, D.C., collapsed, killing 22 workers.\n\nAsia Frigga Booth Clarke – Born 1835 at the farm. Married her brother Edwin’s friend and later business partner John Sleeper Clarke. The Clarkes moved to England after the assassination. At the time of the move, Asia was pregnant with twins. She had promised her brother John Wilkes she would name a son after him. She did not. She died in Bournemouth, England, in 1888.\n\nJohn Wilkes Booth– Born 1838 at the farm. Became a national stage star earning $20,000 a year when the president of the United States was paid $25,000 a year. America’s first presidential assassin. Shot to death in a Virginia tobacco barn in 1865.\n\nJoseph Adrian Booth – Born in Baltimore in 1840. Became a physician. Died 1902.\n\nFundraisers and spring tours\n\nWilmington’s Kathryn Canavan will be a headliner at the May 13 fundraiser for the Junius B. Booth Society and the Historical Society of Harford County. It will focus on “Lincoln’s Final Hours,” which is the title of Canavan’s book, and “The Hunt for John Wilkes Booth,” featuring Lincoln assassination historian John Howard. Proceeds will benefit the historical society and Tudor Hall, the family home of the Booths.\n\nThe fundraiser will last from 1 p.m to 3 p.m. Tickets are $25. Seating is limited to 100 people. Drinks and snacks will be provided. After the talks, the first floor of Tudor Hall, will be open to attendees until 5:30 p.m. The cost is $25. To purchase tickets go to www.harfordhistory.org/events.php or call (410) 838-7691.\n\nCanavan’s book looks at what happened in the first few hours after Booth shot Lincoln and the unintended consequence of the assassination, a topic she started researching in 2009.\n\nHoward will follow the 12-day escape route of Booth to his demise at Garrett Farm through a photographic presentation of the existing sites of the escape route and relics of the assassination. Attendees will receive a map of the escape route. Howard will talk about the motives, role and fate of the key players who participated, why the route was chosen and how side players were affected for the rest of their lives.\n\nHoward is currently one of the staff historians who leads the popular 12-hour John Wilkes Booth Escape tour for the Surratt Society and has been involved with the Society from its inception.\n\nTours of the house\n\nThe first floor and property of Tudor Hall is open to visitors for 45-minute tours on designated weekends. Most weekends, tours are at 1 and 2 p.m., although some days, the 2 p.m. tour is replaced by a historical talk.
