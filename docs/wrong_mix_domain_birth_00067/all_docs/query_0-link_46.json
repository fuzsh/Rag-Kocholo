        "text": "By Cameron Walker\n\nPhoto credit: Kori Hyer\n\n“Wherever you go becomes a part of you somehow.”\n\n-Anita Desai\n\nFernweh is one of those incredibly specific German words that give a name to an almost indescribable feeling: wanderlust, an insistent longing to travel the globe and visit distant lands. If you’ve started to feel the pull of far-off places and a desire to see the world, consider joining the 20% of NC State students who choose to study abroad.\n\n“I always tell students that I don’t have many regrets, but if there was one thing I could go back to college and do, it would be to study abroad,” said Bri Hart, study abroad coordinator and academic advisor for the Wilson College of Textiles. “NC State is a diverse institution and students have many opportunities to engage in global experiences on campus. However, there is something to be said about traveling to a country across the globe to expand your worldview. When I speak with students after they’ve returned from abroad, most of them say that their experience gave them a heightened sense of confidence and independence. This obviously translates well into other areas of their lives, such as transitioning into the workforce.”\n\nAccording to the NC State Study Abroad office, when students who have studied abroad join the workforce, they earn a 25% higher starting salary than those who have not. But students find study abroad valuable in so many other ways: building confidence, forming lifelong friendships, sharpening language skills and broadening their perspective. We asked some of our recently returned students to share their experience, from the sights they saw and classes they took to the challenges they faced and the lessons they learned.\n\nName: Anne Graf\n\nDegree: Fashion and Textile Design (Fashion Design concentration)\n\nHometown: Cedar Grove, NC\n\nDestination: Oxford, England\n\nSemester Abroad: Summer 2019\n\nWhy did you choose to study where you did?\n\nIt’s always been a dream of mine to go to the University of Oxford, but it wasn’t really practical for my entire undergraduate degree. A study abroad program there seemed like the perfect option. Besides, with the program I took, I could get GEP credit, as well as fulfill some requirements for the University Honors Program.\n\nWhat was your impression of your destination?\n\nThe people were all really welcoming! I kind of thought that, because we were Americans, people wouldn’t like us, but they were all very nice, at least to our faces. Other tourists were clueless though — I spent some time in London alone and had so many people come up to me because they were lost and wanted directions. I, of course, was also lost and couldn’t help. It was kind of odd that they thought I knew what I was doing, since I usually didn’t know how to get somewhere, or even where I was currently. But the locals were very nice, and the food was absolutely superb. Everything was much richer, tastier and cheaper than in the United States. You could get a whole meal for three pounds (about $4)! Things just tasted fresher overall. The sights and culture were pretty much what you would expect — absolutely stunning.\n\nDescribe your study abroad experience.\n\nI took a class on Shakespeare and one on European diseases. We took classes every day, and usually had an excursion, or else would explore independently. We went all over the place, from Eyam to London. We went punting on the Thames, visited tons of museums and the Harry Potter Studios, saw Shakespeare plays and churches and Blenheim Palace. We were inducted into the Bodleian Library and climbed to the top of St. Paul’s Cathedral. My favorite place was actually a local swimming hole (part of the Thames river in the middle of a cow pasture). Because it was really hot for part of the time I was there (actually, one day was the hottest day on record over there), people were swimming in the river. This was pretty unusual, but I was game. The first day I discovered this, I jumped off the bridge (relax, a little wooden bridge that people were using like a diving board) fully clothed, because we were on a group excursion and I had not known there was a swimming opportunity. After that though, I went back with friends — and a swimsuit.\n\nIn your opinion, what has study abroad added to your college (and life) experience?\n\nIt’s definitely broadened my worldview. There’s a lot more out there that I haven’t seen or experienced, which has honestly just made me more determined to take opportunities to go on adventures and explore more of the globe. It’s also given me inspiration, which is very important for my major. Nearly everyone who studies abroad says this, but I’ll just go ahead and be stereotypical: it’s made me more independent. After going through the airport alone and spending time in London on my own, staying in hostels and having to figure out how to get where I needed to go without being mugged, I’m definitely more confident in my abilities to handle daily tasks.\n\nIf you went back to your destination, what would you do differently (if anything)?\n\nI would stay longer. A month was not enough. There’s so much more I want to see! I would also like to talk to more locals. I think because I was with a fairly large group (there were about 30 of us), we didn’t meet as many people who lived there as I would have liked. So, I think I would go back either on my own, or with a friend, so that I could meet more locals and do things that would be inconvenient with a large group.\n\nDid you bring back any souvenirs?\n\nI did! I brought back some Oxford swag, some absolutely gorgeous fabric, and some “magic” water from the Roman baths. Ok, not totally magic, but the Romans believed water from this certain spring would heal ailments, so I filled up a water bottle and shipped it home in my suitcase!\n\nWhat did I not ask about your travels that you want to share?\n\nIt was absolutely incredible. Although a month didn’t feel nearly long enough (I wrote a paper comparing England to the U.S. after getting back here, and my conclusion was basically I should move to England), I did so much and had so many cool experiences that I can’t remember them all as I sit here staring at my computer screen. This has only whet my appetite for study abroad though. I’m currently on the prowl for another opportunity — a semester-long one this time — to experience the world!\n\nOh, also, I saw the Queen! I saw her and Prince Charles as they were going about their royal duties. Obviously I didn’t talk to them or anything like that, but I’m still counting it as one of my Top 10 Life Experiences.\n\nName: Talya Suber\n\nDegree: Fashion and Textile Management (Minor in International Studies)\n\nHometown: Chesapeake, VA\n\nDestination: Prague\n\nSemester Abroad: Summer 2018\n\nWhy did you choose to study where you did?\n\nI chose Prague because I was able to get the first class out of the way for my minor. Prague was a beautiful place to learn more about International Studies.\n\nWhat was your impression of your destination?\n\nThe city of Prague is so historically rich. The architecture was breathtaking since I had never seen anything like it in the U.S. It was such a new perspective seeing buildings that were actually old compared to “old” buildings here. The food was also an amazing experience, not to mention we could find nice lunch and dinner spots where entrees were three or four dollars cheaper than they would be in the U.S. My favorite dessert was a traditional cinnamon-like bread cone with ice cream on top called trdelník.\n\nTell us more about your experience.\n\nI took IS200 to knock out the first class to the International Studies minor. We stayed in Belgicka Apartments where we lived — similar to suite-style dorms, but nicer. It was only two or three metro stops from the NC State European Center in Prague and the ride was always an adventure. I loved taking the metro and traveling in small groups to blend in with other local students. Campus was a thirty second walk from the Old Town Square where tons of vendors and performers gathered.\n\nIn your opinion, what has study abroad added to your college (and life) experience?\n\nStudying abroad taught me about perspective. I learned perspectives from cultures we were interacting with not only in Prague, but also within our travel group. We all carried identities that impacted us differently abroad. While we smiled at Czech people in public, they often didn’t smile back as the culture there is very wary of foreigners since communism in the area ended not too long ago. However, the other two black girls and I not only didn’t get smiles, but odd stares as they judged things like our hair.\n\nIf you went back to your destination, what would you do differently (if anything)?\n\nI would go back with the courage to explore the surrounding countries. We were once about a twenty minute train ride from Austria at one point but never went. We were wrapped up in the sights of Prague and didn’t feel like we had enough time to do it all.\n\nDid you bring back any souvenirs and if so, what?\n\nI bought a really cool pair of shoes for half the price of what they would be sold for in the States. I paired it with a plain black Czech Republic hat that I bought from a gift store with the nicest workers that loved meeting tourists. They let us take shelter in their shop when unexpected rain hit and even started cracking jokes with us as they casually drank margaritas from the fridge.\n\nWhat do you want to share about your travels?\n\nI learned how studying abroad as a person of color is a whole different experience. I never knew how well I’d be received or if I should ever go somewhere alone while traveling. Although some of the other students I traveled with had this mindset, they never had to think about it every single day and receive the same kind of stares that my friends and I experienced. There were only three black girls coming to a country where we could count how many black people we saw a day on one hand. As a cultural enthusiast, it hurts to know that some of the places that I’m most excited to visit may not be as excited to have me.\n\nName: Nidhi Godthi\n\nDegree: Textile Engineering\n\nHometown: Cary, NC\n\nDestination: Adelaide, Australia\n\nSemester Abroad: Spring 2019\n\nWhy did you choose to study where you did?\n\nI chose to study at the University of Adelaide because the university has an established program with NC State and because I knew several older textile engineering students who had done the same program. The University of Adelaide had a lot of course options, so I was able to take most of the classes that I would have taken at NC State. Of course, it definitely helped that Australians speak English.\n\nWhat was your impression of your destination?\n\nBecause Australians speak English, the cultural and linguistic differences surprised me. Australians abbreviate words like “university” and “service station/gas station” to “uni” and “servo” respectively. Adelaide specifically had a big focus on work-life balance; all stores closed after 5 o’clock. The food was different because Adelaide had more East Asian cuisine restaurants. I spent the semester trying new cuisines and restaurants. Lastly, I loved the Adelaide Hills. I have never been to a wine growing region before, so seeing the Barossa Valley and surrounding area was a breathtaking experience.\n\nTell us more about your experience.\n\nThe classes I took were statics, circuits, materials science and engineering, and art history. I lived in the Urbanest apartment across the street from the university. On most days, I would go to class and then find a coffee shop to spend my afternoon studying in. My favorite place was a coffee shop called “Journey Beyond Cafe.” It was right next to my apartment and I loved spending the afternoons there, especially on Mondays and Fridays when they had student discounts on the coffee and food.\n\nIn your opinion, what has study abroad added to your college (and life) experience?\n\nStudying abroad has made me a more culturally adept person and I have learned how to adjust to new places easily. I have also learned to function more independently away from home.\n\nIf you went back to your destination, what would you do differently?\n\nIf I went back to Adelaide, I would probably spend more time exploring different places in Australia. I did not have the chance to visit cities like Darwin, Alice Springs, and Perth.\n\nDid you bring back any souvenirs and if so, what?\n\nI brought back a few obligatory boomerangs, but my suitcase was too full to bring back anything else.\n\nWhat did I not ask about your travels that you want to share?\n\nI made a blog during my time in Australia: https://ngodthi.wixsite.com/studyabroadadelaide\n\nName: Livi Prestifilippo\n\nDegree: Fashion and Textile Design\n\nHometown: Wake Forest, North Carolina\n\nDestination: Hong Kong— Hong Kong Polytechnic University\n\nSemester Abroad: Spring 2019\n\nWhy did you choose to study where you did?\n\nI chose to study in Hong Kong because I wanted to go somewhere new and exciting. I wanted to study somewhere that had a textiles program and PolyU has a great one.\n\nWhat was your impression of your destination?\n\nI absolutely loved HK from the moment I got there. There are lots of people, lots of food, and so much to do. You must try the Dim Sum and eat lots of pork buns! There is lots of rice, noodles, pork and seafood.\n\nTell us more about your experience.\n\nI took Coloration and Finishings for Knitwear, which is like a PCC class; 3D Sew-Free Technology, which focuses on different lamination, adhesive and molding techniques for intimate apparel and sportswear; Fashion Shoe Design and Mandarin. I was the only exchange student in my textile classes, which was interesting. I was a little nervous at first, but my classmates and professors were pretty welcoming. I really enjoyed my coloration and finishings lab and experimenting with different dyeing processes.\n\nI lived in student housing, Hung Hom Halls. It was a mix between exchange students and locals. My roommate was French and she was the best! I became such good friends with students from all over the world.\n\nHong Kong has lots of fun sites to visit, like Victoria Peak and Big Buddha. But some of my favorite days were when we would go hiking or to the beach after class. We frequently visited Repulse Bay and hiked Dragon’s Back and Suicide Cliff. I also really enjoyed exploring the Ladies Market and the Temple Night Market.\n\nIn your opinion, what has study abroad added to your college (and life) experience?\n\nStudy abroad was such a great experience. I loved meeting new people and exploring new places. I think learning to live in a new place with new people is a really important life skill that you can take with you after your semester. I also think you gain a new global perspective that shapes how you may live your life.\n\nDo you want to share a travel story?\n\nWhile abroad, I took trips to Chiang Mai, Thailand; Seoul, Korea; Borneo, Malaysia; Ho Chi Min, Vietnam; Beijing, China; Xi’an, China and Macau. I really enjoyed being able to explore Southeast Asia and all that it has to offer. I always loved going to the local markets and trying all of the local food. While in Seoul, the craziest thing we did was try live octopus at the food market! It was still squirming on the plate when it was served to us. You have to make sure you chew it well or else it will suction to your tongue.\n\nOverall, I think my favourite place was Malaysia. I spent a few days near Kota Kinabalu on the beautiful beaches and then spent some time in Sandakan in the jungle on the Kinabatangan River. I saw lots of different monkeys and native species there.\n\nMy last two weeks in Asia, I spent traveling Beijing and Xi’an, China by myself. I thought these were some of the most rewarding days of my semester. It takes a lot to explore a new country where they don’t speak your native language all by yourself. It was one of the most challenging feats I have ever taken on and I am really proud of myself for doing so. I stayed in hostels and loved meeting more people from different backgrounds. There are so many beautiful sights to see in China, such as the Great Wall and many, many temples like the Temple Of Heaven.\n\nI would definitely recommend traveling while abroad. I thoroughly enjoyed seeing so many new places and how life is similar and different around the world.\n\nSide note: all of these trips were booked just with friends or even some by myself. They were not offered through the program.\n\nName: Meilin Walker\n\nDegree: Fashion and Textile Management- Brand Management and Marketing\n\nHometown: Holly Springs, NC\n\nDestination: Adelaide, Australia\n\nSemester Abroad: Summer 2019\n\nWhy did you choose to study where you did?\n\nI chose to study in Australia because it was the best program for me to receive credit for my double minors in Business Administration and Business Entrepreneurship. Also, I’ve always wanted to travel to Australia, so it seemed like the perfect opportunity to earn credit while living in the beautiful country.\n\nWhat was your impression of your destination?\n\nMy impression of Adelaide and Australia in general was that it’s beautiful. The sunsets, crystal blue water, waterfalls, kangaroos and koalas always put me in awe. Australians are such genuine and friendly people. I never had a bad interaction with an Aussie. Once they knew I was from America, they had so many questions and wanted to know about my life beyond the surface — questions such as why I was in Australia. One thing I noticed quickly about the people is they are so much more globally and culturally aware. With Australia having people from all over the world, it’s almost like it’s ingrained for them to know what’s going on around the world. Since there are so many global influences in Australia there isn’t really “Australian cuisine.” The largest influence in the country’s food is Asian, which I absolutely loved. All of the food is authentic and little things such as fruits and vegetables taste fresher there. Adelaide is a foodie city which was great, because there were so many good places to try.\n\nTell us more about your experience.\n\nI took three classes while I was in Australia. MIE 310 Introduction to Entrepreneurship, MIE 410 Opportunity Analysis, and M 380 Doing Business Globally in Australia. I lived in Urbanest student accommodation, which was right across from the University of Adelaide Business School. Every day, I would walk over to the Business School, have class for about 5 hours, then have the rest of the day to work on assignments, explore Adelaide and get food. My program took several excursions. Excursions ranged from traveling to Kangaroo Island, Barossa Valley, Phillips Island, Melbourne and Sydney to visiting local breweries and wineries.\n\nIn your opinion, what has study abroad added to your college (and life) experience?\n\nI grew in a lot of personal and professional ways during my time in Australia. Study abroad has expanded my worldview and let me recognize I’m not as globally aware as I should be and want to be. This experience has taught me how to throw myself into a whole new environment and how to still be successful in it. My confidence in my ability to thrive in areas outside my expertise and clearly communicate what I’ve learned to others, whether that’s a presentation or a paper, has grown exponentially. I love study abroad, because you become part of something that’s bigger than yourself. You’re no longer the expert on the country and it’s a time to immerse yourself and let someone else teach you about their culture.\n\nIf you went back to your destination, what would you do differently (if anything)?\n\nIf I went back to Adelaide specifically, the only thing I would do differently is to go grocery shopping at the Central Market more than the grocery store.\n\nDid you bring back any souvenirs and if so, what?\n\nYes! I brought back Tim Tams which are chocolate biscuit cookies. Tim Tams are a staple for Aussies! There are a ton of different flavors, so I brought back six flavors for my family to try.\n\nDo you want to share a travel story?\n\nMy favorite place I traveled to was Sydney for a long weekend! I went skydiving, which was one of the most memorable experiences during my time, took a ferry boat ride on the Sydney Harbour, and just explored the massive city!\n\nName: Khoa Lam\n\nDegree: Fashion and Textile Management\n\nHometown: Durham, NC\n\nDestination: Florence, Italy\n\nSemester Abroad: Summer I & II\n\nWhy did you choose to study where you did? I chose to study in Italy, because I originally wanted to study in Paris, France, but it wasn’t offered in my program under Textiles. You needed to know French in order to study there, which makes total sense now, because most people in France spoke French and not much English. The second option for me was Florence, Italy, and that was offered in my program. I wanted to study in Europe, because Europe is where all the fashion capitals are located.\n\nWhat was your impression of your destination?\n\nFlorence was nice, it had a lot of Renaissance art. The people were not that friendly compared to other places I’ve been. However, the food was so delicious and the culture is very different compared to America. They are so in tune with nature. Most buildings did not have air conditioning, which sucks over the summer because it was so hot. I had to open the windows for most of the time.\n\nTell us more about your experience.\n\nI took a Fashion Buying Concept class, Luxury Brand Management, and Visual Merchandising course. I lived in an apartment near the center of the Duomo. I went to classes for the most part on weekdays, and on weekends I traveled around Europe with my friends. I went to Milan, Venice (which was my favorite city in Italy), Rome, Amalfi Coast, Capri, Paris and London.\n\nIn your opinion, what has study abroad added to your college (and life) experience?\n\nIt opened me up to a lot of experiences. I met so many people from all over the world in my study abroad program. I learned so much in the courses I was taking in Italy, especially for fashion. Fashion is a major thing in Europe, [since] that is where most of the fashion houses are located, such as Gucci, Ferragamo and the Pitti Palace, where they hosted the first fashion show in Florence. I learned how to adapt to a new environment and how to be flexible with my time.\n\nIf you went back to your destination, what would you do differently (if anything)?\n\nI would have managed my money more, because Europe was so expensive. And bought more clothes in Europe. But the experiences from traveling were worth so much more.\n\nDid you bring back any souvenirs and if so, what?\n\nYes, I brought a nice leather coin purse and wallet from the famous Leather School in Florence, Italy, where most of their clientele were high-end consumers. I also brought back delicious candies from Italy and regular souvenirs for my friends and family, such as postcards, snow globes and key chains.\n\nDo you want to share a travel story?\n\nI traveled to Venice with one of my roommates and a classmate. We got scammed at a restaurant. The server was trying to charge us an additional service fee, which he said “was the tax to the city of Venice.” And there was no such thing, because we ate at another restaurant prior to that one and they did not do that. When you dine out in Italy, there is a cover charge and that covers the service and bread that you get. The guy tried to play us because we were tourists, and he wrote it on the menu in pen. So don’t be afraid to speak up if you think someone is trying to scam you.\n\nName: Jakub Sciora\n\nDegree: Textile Engineering, Minor in Materials Science\n\nHometown: Mebane, NC\n\nDestination: Adelaide, Australia\n\nSemester Abroad: Spring 2019\n\nWhy did you choose to study where you did?\n\nWhen most people travel abroad, they go to Europe; exploring the ‘Land Down Under’ is far from their minds. I thought studying in Australia would be an incredibly unique opportunity. The University of Adelaide, Australia has a strong partnership with NC State for exchange students, and this school was one of the few options for STEM majors to study while fulfilling the degree requirements of an engineer.\n\nWhat was your impression of your destination?\n\nWhat they say is true; Australians really are easygoing and super kind to everyone. One of my expectations going there was [that] I really wanted to make friends with some Australians, and with their warm and sociable nature, it wasn’t hard.\n\nThere are so many things to do in Australia, and all major cities are found along the coast. When you think about how desolate the Outback can be, it made sense that some 85% of their population lives within 3-4 hours of the ocean.\n\nTell us more about your experience.\n\nI lived in student accommodation about 10 minutes from the Uni (university) called Urbanest. Most Australians will attend a uni in their hometown and live with their parents, so there were mostly international students in my apartment complex within the city. I took one elective, a statistics, engineering statics, and electronic circuits course. My favorite things to do during the week were attending salsa dancing club classes, making and sharing meals with my roommate and his five friends from Singapore, and hanging out at the outdoor mall only a block from the uni where street performers would gather. On the weekends we would go surfing, hiking in the hills above the city, and relax on the beach watching the west-coast sunset. I joined a group of Australian Scouts and we went waterskiing and sailing, and I even threw a Fourth of July cookout for them to give a taste of America! Larger excursions included snorkeling with the cuttlefish during their mating season, and road-trip camping along the southern coast of Australia and across New Zealand.\n\nIn your opinion, what has study abroad added to your college (and life) experience?\n\nI learned how to travel on my own, cook meals on my own and become more independent. I also expanded my network of friends to be more diverse, and quickly grew to appreciate the gift of travel and exploration of different geographic regions, people and culture.\n\nIf you went back to your destination, what would you do differently (if anything)?\n\nHands down, the best time to travel is during college. A university setting is ideal for meeting new people and exploring new places, because everyone is just like you, eager to learn and explore. If I went back, it would be a similar story; I would make sure to retain membership at the university because it’s so easy to make friends and find fun things to do in that country.\n\nDid you bring back any souvenirs and if so, what?\n\nI cooked and ate kangaroo meat when I was in Australia, and it was so good I brought back some kangaroo jerky for my friends to try. My friends enjoyed their very own hand-painted boomerangs and my 12” boomerang sits on my mantlepiece at home, showcasing the awesome opportunity I had to travel to Aussieland.\n\nDo you want to share a travel story?\n\nFour friends from NC State and I went car camping along the South Island of New Zealand over winter break. The setup was unique because we had a tent strapped to the top of our car, where all five of us would sleep each night. Road-tripping is incredibly popular among both the Aussies and Kiwis, and over the course of 10 days, we drove along the coast, between mountains and up glaciers. The land was gorgeous, as was the night sky filled with Milky Way stars, and we saw many of the spots where “The Lord of the Rings” movies were filmed.\n\nWhat else do you want to share about your travels?\n\nI arrived before and left after my apartment lease opened and closed, but I was able to find a couple who agreed to be a host family for me for a few weeks. This couple took me in as one of their own children, and we became the best of friends. We enjoyed cooking together, taking wine tours and traveling, but most of all it was such a blessing to live a day in the life of a typical Australian family. We keep in touch to this day.\n\nName: Kori Hyer\n\nDegree: Fashion and Textile Design\n\nHometown: Fayetteville, NC\n\nDestination: Florence, Italy\n\nSemester Abroad: Spring 2019\n\nWhy did you choose to study where you did?\n\nI chose Accademia Italiana in Florence for the unique class offerings. I wanted to take classes that were not available to me at NC State.\n\nWhat was your impression of your destination?\n\nI immediately fell in love with the city of Florence. I loved walking around the city, window shopping the high-end stores and admiring the gorgeous historic buildings. The food was beyond comparison to anything I’ve ever tasted. I loved the culture of food in Italy as well — spending hours at a restaurant for dinner and enjoying every course slowly.\n\nTell us more about your experience.\n\nI took Italian, Italian Culture, Collection Theory, Accessory Design and Fashion Photography. I lived in an apartment with three other NC State students. It took about ten minutes to walk to most classes from my apartment.\n\nIn your opinion, what has study abroad added to your college (and life) experience?\n\nI returned from my semester abroad with a strengthened sense of independence, which gives me the courage to try more new experiences. I also learned a great deal about lifestyles in different countries across Europe. I found it very interesting to learn about the many different cultures of the world, and I hope to continue to add to this perspective.\n\nIf you went back to your destination, what would you do differently (if anything)?\n\nI would plan more trips in advance. Traveling spontaneously is fun, but booking flights earlier would have saved me some money.\n\nDid you bring back any souvenirs and if so, what?\n\nMy favorite souvenir is a waxed cotton Belstaff jacket I found in a thrift shop in Florence.\n\nDo you want to share a travel story?\n\nOne amazing experience I had was when I spent a day exploring Paris by myself. I wandered through a huge flea market in the pouring rain and stumbled upon a tiny shop where a woman was selling vintage scarves, bags and other odds and ends. I started making conversation with her and she told me that at one time, she worked for Karl Lagerfeld! She was so kind and gave me a discount on one of her scarves when I told her I was a Fashion Design student.\n\nWhat did I not ask about your travels that you want to share?\n\nPeople have asked me what surprised me about my travels. I think one thing I realized while traveling was how little I have seen of my own country. Now that I’ve returned, I want to visit the beautiful places that the United States is famous for. I have a new appreciation for the place where I grew up and for my own culture. I’m looking forward to exploring my home and what makes my community so valuable to me.\n\nName: Bri Hart\n\nOccupation: Wilson College of Textiles academic advisor and study abroad coordinator\n\nDestination: Australia\n\nWhat was the journey to Australia like? That’s a long time in the air.\n\nI practice mindfulness and meditation, so I spent about a week or two before my trip mentally preparing for the flight. In total, I was in the air for over 20 hours. The longest leg of the flight was from LAX to Sydney (13+hours!); by the time I was in the air headed to Sydney, I convinced myself that I was at home catching up on sleep and Netflix…which is essentially what I did the entire flight. I’m grateful for the amazing service and food that the airline provided. Those small details (along with a window seat) made the long flight bearable.\n\nWhat was your first impression of your destination?\n\nAustralia has some of the best food I’ve ever experienced. I consider myself a foodie and I never had a bad meal there. The people are also very nice! Australians truly have a “no worries” mentality and interacting with them gave me a new perspective on my approach to life.\n\nTell us more about your experience.\n\nI spent 10 days in Adelaide, South Australia and four days in Melbourne, Victoria. I did…a lot! The primary purpose of my trip was to serve as a site director for NC State’s Study Abroad Program at the University of Adelaide. While in Adelaide, I helped facilitate orientation programming for nine NC State students who are studying at the University of Adelaide this fall. This included tours of Adelaide and the surrounding area, along with a trip to a conservatory where we hung out with kangaroos and saw some of Australia’s native wildlife! I also met with campus partners at the University of Adelaide, Monash University, and RMIT University to continue strengthening our partnerships with those institutions.\n\nIf you went back to Australia, what would you do differently (if anything)?\n\nIf given the opportunity, I would visit Australia when it’s warmer so that I can visit the beach! Melbourne is now officially my favorite city in the world. The only thing I would do differently there is stay longer so that I can try more restaurants!\n\nDid you bring back any souvenirs and if so, what?\n\nI brought back several souvenirs! I’m probably the only person that still sends notes in the mail, so I brought back several postcards to send to friends and family. I also brought back items native to Australia, such as Manuka honey, aboriginal artwork and a boomerang!\n\nDo you want to share a travel story?\n\nAs a Georgia native, I am an avid “Real Housewives of Atlanta” fan. One night while I was in the lobby of my hotel, I was talking to the clerk and I told her that I’m from Georgia. She immediately said that the Real Housewives of Atlanta is her favorite TV show! Naturally, we talked for a while about the show and some of our favorite episodes. That moment of serendipity reminded me that even on this large globe, we are all more connected than we think!\n\nWhat did I not ask about your travels that you want to share?\n\nLike several Wilson College students, I grew up in a small rural town where international travel isn’t the norm. I never would’ve imagined that I would have the chance to go to Australia and I didn’t think twice when given the opportunity to go. I am grateful that NC State’s Study Abroad office asked me to lead this trip and I am appreciative that [the Wilson College of Textiles Center for Academic, Career and Student Services (ACSS)] enthusiastically supported me. I hope to use my experience abroad to inspire our rural and underrepresented students to dare to see the world!\n\nWhere do you want to travel next and why?\n\nDomestically, I really want to get to New Orleans. NOLA has been on my list for a while now and I look forward to experiencing (and tasting) the lively spirit of the city. Internationally, I hope to travel to Ghana soon. My family’s origins trace back to West Africa and I hope to experience what my true “home” feels like.\n\nAdvice and opportunities for Study Abroad\n\nWe asked Wilson College of Textiles study abroad coordinator Bri Hart to share some advice for those considering study abroad.\n\nHow can interested students find out more about studying abroad?\n\nThe NC State Study Abroad website is a wonderful resource for all students at every stage of their study abroad journey. On their site, students can research study abroad programs, apply for study abroad programs and scholarships, and access other resources related to traveling abroad, such as visa information. The Wilson College of Textiles’ International Engagement page also has a wealth of information related to textile-specific programs. This fall, we will also be hosting a mini study abroad fair in Wilson College and we host Study Abroad information sessions each semester in conjunction with NC State’s study abroad office.\n\nHow can students finance their experience?\n\nMany students don’t consider studying abroad because of perceived financial barriers. However, there are so many financial resources available to students both through NC State’s Study Abroad office and through Wilson College. Students can also use their financial aid towards study abroad. I would encourage students to not let finances be a barrier to even considering studying abroad. NC State’s study abroad office hosts several information sessions solely devoted to funding and I highly encourage students to attend to learn more about how to fund their study abroad program.\n\nWhat are your tips for foreign travel?\n\nOne tip that I have is to begin thinking about how the time difference may affect how you communicate with family and friends in the States. I’ve heard a lot of students say that communication with family and friends was a big adjustment for them while they were abroad. I would recommend scheduling a day/time each week to Facetime/Skype/call loved ones.\n\nI would also recommend finding travel blogs to read about the experiences of others who have visited where you’re going.\n\nAlso, make sure to call all of your banks to let them know you are traveling and to be aware of any international transaction fees that you may occur.\n\nFinally, chronicle your journey! For some, that means taking lots of photographs. For others, that may involve journaling or keeping a personal vlog. You want to make sure that you document your time abroad so that you can keep your memories tangible.\n\nWhat can students do early in their college careers to set themselves up for study abroad?\n\nIt’s never too early to research! We begin promoting study abroad to students during Orientation so that they can begin considering programs. We also always encourage students to consult with their academic advisor as they begin thinking about programs. Their advisor can help them narrow down programs that are a good fit for their major and that can help them fulfill degree requirements.\n\nSpring 2020 Study Abroad Application Deadline September 15!"
