        "text": "Antonino “Tony” Esposito of Norwich, passed away peacefully at the age of 79 in his home on Thursday, April 16, 2020 with his loving family by his side.\n\nBorn on September 13, 1940 in Lipari, Italy, Tony was the son of Salvatore and Francesca (Spano) Esposito. At a young age, Tony began his apprenticeship as a master cabinet maker which he completed before embarking on his two-year service with the Italian navy. He was stationed in Rome and fell in love with the city. After completing his naval service, Tony returned to Lipari and started a business specializing in joinery, cabinet and furniture making, but was talented in all facets of interior carpentry.\n\nHe met his wife-to-be, Concetta “Tina” Esposito in Italy and both would eventually immigrate to the United States. They wed at St. Bartholomew’s Church in Norwich on February 24, 1968 and raised two loving children. Tony worked in carpentry and tiling until his retirement. The beautiful woodwork throughout his Norwich residence is an artful example of his skilled hands.\n\nTony was a devoted member of St. Bartholomew’s Church. He was also a passionate winemaker and gardener. He enjoyed growing tomatoes, peppers, eggplants, zucchini, garlic and basil, just to name a few. Whatever he grew, grew in abundance, and the tomatoes he harvested were legendary. He loved talking with people and was an amazing storyteller, weaving a simple story into a whimsical adventure for all those listening. Tony enjoyed visiting his birthplace in Italy with his family. He also took the opportunity to visit childhood friends and family in Australia.\n\nTony was committed to his craft and enjoyed living life. But his driving force was his family, whom he loved dearly. Devoted husband, loving father, grandfather and loyal friend, Tony will be dearly missed by all.\n\nTony is survived by his devoted wife of 52 years, Tina, his children, Francesca, of Norwich, and Salvatore, of Syracuse. He is also survived by his grandchildren, Maria, Concetta, and Virginia Maiurano; brother, Giuseppe “Pino” Esposito and his wife Caterina “Rina”, of Italy; nieces, Cathy (Gordon) Soroka, of Oneonta, Linda (Mark) Natoli, of Manlius, nephew Joe (Heather) Esposito, of Norwich; and several grandnieces and grandnephews.\n\nA private visitation was held at the Wilson Funeral Home on Saturday, April 18, 2020. A private burial will take place on Tuesday, April 21, at St. Paul’s Cemetery, where the Rev. Ralph Bove, pastor, Church of St. Bartholomew, will offer committal prayers. A memorial Mass for Tony will be celebrated at a later date.\n\nContributions in Tony’s memory may be made to: Hospice of Chenango County or St. Bart’s Capital Campaign Fund. Funeral arrangements have been trusted to the Wilson Funeral Home. To leave the family a message of condolence, please visit: www.wilsonfh.com."
