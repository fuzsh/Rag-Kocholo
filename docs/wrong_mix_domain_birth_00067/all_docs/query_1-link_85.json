        "text": "President Woodrow Wilson\n\nSource: Library of Congress, Woodrow Wilson Papers\n\nIn 1924 Woodrow Wilson was buried in the crypt of Washington National Cathedral, in Bethlehem Chapel. He is the only president with a grave there. At the time only a portion of the cathedral had ben completed, and Wilson's burial site was intended to be just a temporary resting place.\n\nA new building program in the 1950's included moving Wilson's tomb to the new nave with three stained glass windows highlighting . In 1953, the United Daughters of the Confederacy donated stained glass windows honoring Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson. Those windows were installed next to the bay in which President Wilson was buried.\n\nAfter a white supremacist murdered 12 people during a Bible study in Charleston, South Carolina, the Confederate battle flag was removed from the windows. The entire Lee and Jackson windows were replaced in 2023 with new stained glass windows based on a racial justice theme. 1\n\nSource: Washington National Cathedral, National Cathedral Tour: Woodrow Wilson Bay\n\nLinks\n\nGoogle StreetView\n\nWoodrow Wilson Birthplace - Staunton\n\nInternet Public Library Biography\n\nLibrary of Congress\n\nWoodrow Wilson Papers\n\nNational Portrait Gallery\n\nWilson Biography from Outline of American History\n\nThe White House Biography\n\nEllen Louise Axson Wilson\n\nEdith Bolling Galt Wilson\n\nWoodrow Wilson as Commander-in-Chief: The Formative Period of US Military Planning for the AEF in World War I, April-November 1917\n\nReferences\n\n1. \"Wilson to lie in crypt of cathedral, services to be private,\" UPI, February 4, 1924, https://www.upi.com/Archives/1924/02/04/Wilson-to-lie-in-crypt-of-cathedral-services-to-be-private/7421777382101/; \"National Cathedral continues to debate the Lee, Jackson windows,\" Episcopal News Service, February 20, 2017, https://www.episcopalnewsservice.org/2017/02/20/national-cathedral-continues-to-debate-the-lee-jackson-windows/comment-page-2/; \"National Cathedral replaces windows honoring Confederacy with stained-glass homage to racial justice,\" Politico, September 24, 2023, https://www.politico.com/news/2023/09/24/national-cathedral-replaces-windows-honoring-confederacy-with-stained-glass-homage-to-racial-justice-00117808; \"How we learn to see history: A case study at the National Cathedral,\" Washington Post, January 14, 2024, https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/01/14/martin-luther-king-national-cathedral-seeing-race-history/ (last checked January 16, 2024)\n\nPlaces Associated With Famous Virginians\n\nVirginia Places"
