        "text": "Red, also known as Adelaide Wilson, is the main protagonist, minor antagonist, the wife of Gabe, and mother of Jason and Zora in the 2019 film 'Us'.\n\nUs (2019)[]\n\nIn 1986, Adelaide Thomas and her parents arrive at Santa Cruz, California, to attend the festivities. After separating from her father who was drunkenly playing Whack-A-Mole, Adelaide discovers an attraction housing a hall of mirrors. When the power is knocked out by a storm, Adelaide starts whistling to Incey Wincey Spider to calm her nerves only to then hear someone else whistling in unison to her.\n\nWalking aimlessly through the hall of mirrors, Adelaide discovers her Tethered and is immediately choked to unconsciousness. Upon coming to, Adelaide finds herself chained to a bed and her doppelganger taking her Thriller shirt and abandoning her to the hands of the Tethered. Fearful for their daughter's condition, the parents decide to teach her to speak through dance and performance. Eventually, the doppelganger would meet her future husband Gabe Wilson and marries him resulting in her children Zora and Jason. However, it would appear that the doppelganger had forgotten about her actions, believing that the traumatizing experience happened to her instead of the other way around.\n\nYears later, the doppelganger goes on a vacation to Santa Cruz with her family. Even though she is hesitant to go due to her trauma, she is convinced to travel to the beach with them. When she believed that her double was going to get her, she starts boarding up the house to no avail. The Tethered versions of the Wilsons invade the house, and the doppelganger is made to confront her double who had become the de facto leader of the Tethered. When Red initiates the \"untethering\", the doppelganger and her family manage to kill their Tethered as well as the Tethered of their friends. With Pluto's (Jason's Tethered) death as a result of Jason forcing him to walk into the fires of the flaming car, Red kidnaps the real Jason and takes him to one of the facilities. Arriving in an abandoned classroom, the doppelganger has a brawl with Red climaxing in her choking her to death, laughing maniacally as she did and Became unthread from her original now that Red is dead"
