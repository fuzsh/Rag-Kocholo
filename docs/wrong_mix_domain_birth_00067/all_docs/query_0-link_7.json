        "text": "Above: Alice Paul, 1918\n\nImage Source = Library of Congress\n\nReproduction Number = LC-USZ62-37937\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nALICE STOKES PAUL (JANUARY 11, 1885-JULY 9, 1977)\n\nU.S. Quaker Women’s Rights Activist\n\nAlice Paul‘s Quaker faith, with its egalitarian elements, informed and compelled her feminist activism.\n\nOur saint came from a devout Quaker family that valued education and social progressivism. She, born in Mount Laurel, New Jersey, on January 11, 1885, was a daughter of William Mickle Paul, I (1850-1902), and Tacie Parry Paul (1859-1930). Alice’s siblings were William Mickle Paul, II (1886-1958), Helen Paul Shearer (1889-1971), and Parry Haines Paul (1895-1956). Tacie, a suffragette, took young Alice to suffragette meetings. The influence lasted.\n\nPaul, well-educated, changed her academic course mid-stream. She, a graduate of Moorestown Friends School, Moorestown, New Jersey, matriculated at Swarthmore College, Swarthmore, Pennsylvania, as a biology major (B.A., 1905). A year-long fellowship (1905-1906) at a settlement house on the Lower East Side of Manhattan led to graduate studies in economics, sociology, and political science at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (M.A., 1907). During the next three years, Paul lived in England. She studied at the Woodbrooke Quaker Centre, Birmingham; the University of Birmingham; and the London School of Economics. Our saint also became a militant suffragette. She endured three prison sentences. Paul, on hunger strikes, also endured forced feedings. Our saint, back in the United States of America in 1910, earned her Ph.D. in sociology from the University of Pennsylvania. Her dissertation was “The Legal Standing of Women in Pennsylvania.”\n\nPaul’s militant feminism, costly to her, benefited many women and the United States of America. She, one of the founders of the National Woman’s Party (1916), protested, marched, and went to prison. She and her sister activists, incarcerated unjustly in the “land of the free” that fought World War I allegedly to “make the world safe for democracy,” sought to allow women in all states to vote. Women could vote in some states and territories yet not others prior to the ratification (1920) of the Nineteenth Amendment. In prison, Paul and her sister activists, on hunger strikes, endured forced feedings.\n\n(Thomas) Woodrow Wilson, President of the United States of America (1913-1921), was a difficult historical figure. He was an unapologetic White Supremacist who segregated the District of Columbia. (His father, the Reverend Joseph Ruggles Wilson, pastor of First Presbyterian Church, Augusta, Georgia, in 1861, had preached in favor of race-based chattel slavery. Then Joseph had become a founding father of the Presbyterian Church in the Confederate States of America, committed to defending slavery as part of theological orthodoxy. The apple did not fall far from the tree; Thomas was similar to Joseph.) In the presidential election of 1912, Wilson, the nominee of the Democratic Party, was not the most progressive candidate. That mantle fell to the Socialist Party’s Eugene V. Debs. Progressive Party nominee and former Republican President Theodore Roosevelt, whose platform included universal health care, was more progressive than Wilson. Wilson, as President, usually governed as a conservative. He governed as a progressive when he perceived that doing so was to his political advantage, such as shortly prior to the election of 1916, so he could attract the votes of many progressives during the Progressive Era. Wilson, long an opponent of women’s suffrage, was a target for Paul’s activism. Her militant tactics paid off; Wilson became a champion of women’s suffrage as the political winds changed course.\n\n(Aside: In case I have not been sufficiently clear, O reader, I do not like Woodrow Wilson. I would not name an outhouse after him. To do so would insult the outhouse.)\n\nPaul studied law after the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment. She earned her law degrees (through Doctor of Civil Laws) from the Washington College of Law, American University, Washington, D.C., in 1922, 1927, and 1928.\n\nPaul spent most of the rest of her life working for the legal equality of men and women under the law. She co-wrote successive versions of the Equal Rights Amendment, starting in 1923, and lobbied for all of them. Critics came from both the Right and on the Left. On the Right, support for patriarchy prevailed. On the Left, fears of losing gender-based protections for women prompted opposition. In Paul’s mind, anything other than legal egalitarianism for men and women constituted “legalized inequality.” Our saint also helped to add gender as one of the categories in the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n\nPaul, who kept her personal life private and never married, died in Moorestown, New Jersey, on July 9, 1977. She was 92 years old.\n\nKENNETH RANDOLPH TAYLOR\n\nJULY 3, 2020 COMMON ERA\n\nTHE FEAST OF SAINTS FLAVIAN AND ANATOLIUS OF CONSTANTINOPLE, PATRIARCHS; AND SAINTS AGATHO, LEO II, AND BENEDICT II, BISHOPS OF ROME; DEFENDERS OF CHRISTOLOGICAL ORTHODOXY\n\nTHE FEAST OF SAINT DIONYSIUS OF ALEXANDRIA, PATRIARCH OF ALEXANDRIA, AND CHURCH FATHER; SAINT EUSEBIUS OF LAODICEA, BISHOP OF LAODICEA; AND SAINT ANATOLIUS OF ALEXANDRIA, BISHOP OF LAODICEA\n\nTHE FEAST OF SAINT HELIODORUS OF ALTINUM, ASSOCIATE OF SAINT JEROME, AND BISHOP OF ALTINUM\n\nTHE FEAST OF IMMANUEL NITSCHMANN, GERMAN-AMERICAN MORAVIAN MINISTER AND MUSICIAN; HIS BROTHER-IN-LAW, JACOB VAN VLECK, U.S. MORAVIAN BISHOP, MUSICIAN, COMPOSER, AND EDUCATOR; HIS SON, WILLIAM HENRY VAN VLECK, U.S. MORAVIAN BISHOP; HIS BROTHER, CARL ANTON VAN VLECK, U.S. MORAVIAN MINISTER, MUSICIAN, COMPOSER, AND EDUCATOR; HIS DAUGHTER, LISETTE (LIZETTA) MARIA VAN VLECK MEINUNG; AND HER SISTER, AMELIA ADELAIDE VAN VLECK, U.S. MORAVIAN COMPOSER AND EDUCATOR\n\nTHE FEAST OF JOHN CENNICK, BRITISH MORAVIAN EVANGELIST AND HYMN WRITER\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nHoly and righteous God, you created us in your image.\n\nGrant us grace to contend fearlessly against evil and to make no peace with oppression.\n\nHelp us [like your servant Alice Paul] to use our freedom\n\nto bring justice among people and nations, to the glory of your name;\n\nthrough your Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.

For this post I draw from Clayton H. Ramsey’s article about Bethany Presbyterian Church, Greene County, Georgia, in the Autumn 2018 issue of Georgia Backroads magazine. I also derive information from the first two volumes of Ernest Trice Thompson‘s magisterial three-volume work, Presbyterians in the South (1963-1973). I also derive information from Journals of Southern Presbyterian General Assemblies.\n\nJames Woodrow, a native of England, spent most of his life in the United States. He, born in Carlisle on May 30, 1828, emigrated with his family as a youth. He graduated from Jefferson College, Washington, Pennsylvania, in 1849. Then he studied under naturalist Louis Agassiz at the Lawrence Scientific School, Harvard. After teaching in Alabama, Woodrow was a professor at Oglethorpe University, Midway, Georgia, from 1853 to 1861. He taught geology, botany, chemistry, and natural philosophy. Our saint also took a few years off to earn graduate degrees at the University of Heidelberg. When he graduated in 1856, he could have become the Chair of Natural Sciences at Heidelberg, had he accepted the offer. Woodrow studied theology after returning to Oglethorpe University. He became a minister in the Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A. (Old School) on October 15, 1859; the ordination occurred at Bethany Presbyterian Church, Greene County, Georgia.\n\nColumbia Theological Seminary, Columbia, South Carolina, created an endowed professorship, Woodrow’s next job, in 1861. Judge John Perkins, of Mississippi, provided the funding for the position, with the intention that the Perkins Professor of Natural Science refute Evolution and prepare seminarians to do the same. Woodrow, who started the job in late 1861, insisted on academic freedom, though. He also carried into the professorship his conviction that God could not contradict himself in the Bible and in science, and that any seeming contradiction between the Bible and science must result from the misinterpretation of scripture. This position left Woodrow, who refused to dismiss rock layers and fossil records, open to accepting Evolution, which he did by 1884.\n\nThe Presbyterian Church in the Confederate States of America (PCCSA) formed at First Presbyterian Church, Augusta, Georgia, on December 4, 1861. Wilson became a charter member of the new denomination.\n\nThe Civil War disrupted elements of church life in the South. Columbia Theological Seminary closed for most of the conflict. Furthermore, The Southern Presbyterian did not always go to the presses. Woodrow remained busy, though.\n\nHe edited The Southern Presbyterian.\n\nHe became the Treasurer of the PCCSA’s Foreign Mission Committee in 1861.\n\nHe became the Treasurer of the PCCSA’s Home Mission Committee in 1863.\n\nHe taught chemistry at the College of South Carolina.\n\nHe managed the Medical and Chemical Confederate Laboratory, which made silver nitrate for wound care.\n\nIn December 1865, after Confederate defeat, the PCCSA renamed itself the Presbyterian Church in the United States (PCUS).\n\nWhen Columbia Theological Seminary reopened and The Southern Presbyterian resumed publication, Woodrow’s roles at them resumed, also. He was one of the more progressive members of his denomination; he favored friendly relations with the “Northern” (actually national) Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A. As Woodrow became more accepting of Evolution, he moved in a direction opposite of that of the PCUS. By 1884 his alleged heresy had become so controversial that the seminary closed for two years, reopening in 1886. The seminary board requested in 1884 that Woodrow resign; he refused. The heresy trial, held at Bethany Presbyterian Church, Greene County, Georgia, in 1886, ended in an acquittal. Nevertheless, the seminary board fired our saint on December 8, 1886.\n\nThe PCUS General Assemblies of 1886, 1888, 1889, and 1924 passed resolutions taking the position opposite of Professor Woodrow.\n\nLife went on for James Woodrow, who remained prominent in the PCUS. He, the editor of The Southern Presbyterian consistently since 1866, continued in that role until 1893. On the side, he continued to teach at the University of South Carolina, where he had been on faculty since 1869. The seminary board forbade Columbia students to attend his lectures, though. Woodrow went on to serve as the President of the University of South Carolina from 1891 to 1897. Furthermore, he was, for a time, the President of the Central National Bank, Columbia. In 1896, when the Presbytery of Charleston sought to prevent African-American men from becoming ordained ministers, Woodrow sided against the presbytery and with the Synod of South Carolina. The General Assembly supported the position of the synod.\n\nWoodrow retained the ability to create controversy at the end of his life. The General Assembly of 1901 elected him the Moderator for a year. The following year, at the General Assembly, our saint offended many in his sermon; he recognized the Roman Catholic Church as a Christian organization. The General Assembly of 1902 passed a resolution NOT to print his sermon.\n\nWoodrow, ailing in 1906, had surrendered his leadership roles in the church. That year, as he neared death, the Board of Directors of Columbia Theological Seminary passed resolutions praising him for his piety and orthodoxy.\n\nWoodrow, aged 78 years, died in Columbia, South Carolina, on January 17, 1907.\n\nThe General Assembly of 1969 affirmed:\n\nNeither Scripture, nor our Confession of Faith, nor our catechisms, teach the creation of man by direct and immediate acts of God as to exclude the possibility of evolution as a scientific theory.\n\nWoodrow would have approved.\n\nGood science should always overrule bad theology.\n\nThe Christian Church has a mixed record regarding science, faith, and reason. On the positive side are giants such as James Woodrow, Nicolaus Copernicus, and Galileo Galilei. The Society of Jesus has a venerable tradition of astronomy. One may reach back as far as St. Clement of Alexandria (d. 210/2015), the “Father of Christian Scholarship,” who affirmed the value of truth, whether or not of Christian origin. One may also continue that line through his pupil, Origen. When one skips a few centuries, one arrives at St. Albert the Great (d. 1280) and his student, St. Thomas Aquinas, who affirmed the compatibility of faith and reason. On the negative side are figures such as St. Robert Bellarmine (who confronted Galileo and whom I will never add to my Ecumenical Calendar) and William Jennings Bryan (who, likewise, has less probability than a snowball in Hell of joining the ranks at my Ecumenical Calendar).\n\nAll this is easy for me to write, for I am unapologetic product of the Northern Renaissance, the Scientific Revolution, the Enlightenment, and the best of Roman Catholic tradition. My intellectualism and my acceptance of science inform my Christian faith. God is not the author of confusion. Furthermore, God does not deceive us with manufactured fossils and rock layers meant to test our faith. God cannot lie, but human beings are capable of misunderstanding.\n\nKENNETH RANDOLPH TAYLOR\n\nAUGUST 6, 2019 COMMON ERA\n\nTHE FEAST OF THE TRANSFIGURATION\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nGod of grace and glory, you create and sustain the universe in majesty and beauty:\n\nWe thank you for James Woodrow and all in whom you have planted\n\nthe desire to know your creation and to explore your work and wisdom.\n\nLead us, like them, to understand better the wonder and mystery of creation;\n\nthrough Jesus Christ your eternal Word, through whom all things were made.

He grew up in a desert and working-class Roman Catholic family. Our saint became involved in leftist social justice movements, in particular, with labor unionism. According to some, he was even an agitator. Salmon, who attended Mass frequently, married his longtime sweetheart in 1917. Shortly thereafter, due to U.S. involvement in World War I and official intolerance of antiwar activism, his life changed for the worse.\n\nPresident Woodrow Wilson, about whom I harbor mixed and mostly negative opinions, had predicted prior to April 1917 that, if the U.S.A. were to enter World War I, many Americans would forget that there was no such thing as tolerance. He was correct. He also led the charge of intolerance. In 1917 and 1918 state and federal laws incarcerated peaceful opponents of that war. The U.S. Government even treated Amish (yes, Amish!) conscientious objectors harshly. Authorities, suspecting Amish and Mennonites of being pro-German, kept them under surveillance. (For details, O reader, consult Steven M. Nolt, A History of the Amish, Revised and Updated Edition, 2003, pages 266-273.) Laws in some states targeted those who worshiped in a language other than English, so populations ranging from Dutch-psalm-singing members of the Christian Reformed Church to Lutherans who worshiped in Danish or German felt pressure (sometimes in the form of vandalism) to assimilate.\n\nThe Amish had been pacifists since their founding, centuries prior to World War I, yet they were not safe from the assaults of the U.S. military over their refusal to fight in a war. Neither was Salmon, whose pacifism, rooted in Roman Catholicism, put him at odds with the American bishops of his own church. He responded to the draft by applying for conscientious objector status. The Army refused to grant him that status, but offered non combatant status instead. Even that constituted a violation of Salmon’s conscience. In 1918 the military police arrested our saint. In short order he had gone through a court-martial and received a guilty verdict and a death sentence, reduced to a term of 25 years. For more than two years Salmon suffered as he refused to cooperate with his persecutors and oppressors, who retaliated by treating him inhumanely–including with much solitary confinement, sometimes in a vermin-infested cell above the prison sewer. When, in 1920, our saint started a hunger strike, guards force-fed him. Then the Army, arguing that he was not only a criminal but an insane person, had him committed to St. Elizabeth’s Hospital, Washington, D.C. The new American Civil Liberties Union (A.C.L.U.) defended Salmon and other war resisters, sent to prison.\n\nIn prison Salmon, consulting only the Catholic Encyclopedia and the Bible, composed a 200-page refutation of just war theory. No modern war, he argued, can fit that theory. Furthermore, our saint insisted, militarism had become the new idolatry. Such arguments did not convert many enemies into allies at a time when the “rally around the flag” mentality turned into jingoism, vigilantism, and religious intolerance–all in the name of national security.\n\nPresident Warren G. Harding, of whom I also harbor mostly negative opinions, at least pardoned Salmon and other war resisters in late 1920. The Army issued our saint a Dishonorable Discharge, however. Salmon returned to his wife, with whom he had three children. His prison experiences had broken his health. He died, aged 42 years, at Chicago, Illinois, on February 15, 1932.\n\nI have attempted and failed to be a pacifist. Nevertheless, I have concluded that most violence is both avoidable and wrong. I have also concluded that the mistreatment of pacifists is always wrong. I have decided to place the persecutors and oppressors of Salmon in the same category as the Puritans who hanged Quakers in New England in the late 1600s: evildoers who reacted out of fear.\n\nNational security is an invalid excuse for trampling the rights of people, in this case, a man who simply refused to commit violence or to be complicit in it. As Dr. Samuel Johnson (1709-1784) stated,\n\nPatriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel.\n\nOr at least a jingoist.\n\nKENNETH RANDOLPH TAYLOR\n\nDECEMBER 4, 2016 COMMON ERA\n\nTHE SECOND SUNDAY OF ADVENT, YEAR A\n\nTHE FEAST OF SAINTS JOHN OF DAMASCUS AND COSMAS OF MAIUMA, THEOLOGIANS AND HYMNODISTS\n\nTHE FEAST OF SAINT JOHN CALABRIA, FOUNDER OF THE CONGREGATION OF THE POOR SERVANTS AND THE POOR WOMEN SERVANTS OF DIVINE PROVIDENCE\n\nTHE FEAST OF JOSEPH MOHR, AUSTRIAN ROMAN CATHOLIC PRIEST AND HYMN WRITER\n\nTHE FEAST OF THOMAS COTTERILL, ENGLISH PRIEST, HYMN WRITER, AND LITURGIST\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nAlmighty God, whose prophets taught us righteousness in the care of your poor:\n\nBy the guidance of your Holy Spirit, grant that we may\n\ndo justice, love mercy, and walk humbly in your sight;\n\nthrough Jesus Christ our Judge and Redeemer, who lives and reigns\n\nwith you and the same Spirit, one God, now and for ever.

On this, my Ecumenical Calendar of Saints’ Days and Holy Days, I do the same and add to the feast his colleague and fellow Episcopalian, John Nevin Sayre.\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nPAUL JONES (I)\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nJones, born on November 25, 1880, at Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, was a cradle Episcopalian and a son of a priest. After graduating from Yale University he attended the Episcopal Theological School, Cambridge, Massachusetts. There, in 1906, Jones heard the Bishop Franklin S. Spalding, of the Missionary District of Utah, speak of the challenges of evangelizing in the Mormon-dominated state. Our saint volunteered to serve in Utah. And he did, at St. John’s, Logan. In 1914 Jones became the archdeacon in the missionary district. Later that year he succeeded Spalding as bishop. Our saint built up the diocese well during his tenure (1914-1918).\n\nJones got into deep trouble for speaking out based on his conscience. He was a pacifist, for he was convinced that Jesus disapproved of settling conflicts violently. Jones also argued for recognizing the moral validity of conscientious objection to war. Both church and society, he insisted, should respect the choice not to engage in violence. All of this was politically dangerous to advocate for in the United States in 1917 and 1918, a time when much of the population contracted war fever. In the realm of the ridiculous, Dachshunds became Liberty Hounds, German Shepherds became Alsacian Shepherds, and frankfurters became hot dogs, among other examples of renaming dog breeds and food products. The city of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, banned the performance of the music of Ludwig von Beethoven, who had been dead for 90 years. Besides, given the composer’s political position regarding Emperor Napoleon I (he considered Bonaparte’s self-promotion a betrayal of principles), would Beethoven have supported German imperialism in 1914-1918, had he been alive? Reason be damned, this was wartime panic and intolerance. States and the federal government passed laws suspending the freedom of speech and redress of the government. Certain opponents of U.S. involvement in World War I went to prison for their nonviolent activities, such as giving speeches and distributing leaflets. (The First Amendment to the United States Constitution be damned also, apparently.) Jones had to contend with false allegations of being pro-German and anti-American. He got off relatively lightly, though; the Episcopal House of Bishops forced him to resign from both the Missionary District of Utah and the House of Bishops. Years later he got to rejoin the House of Bishops yet without a vote therein.\n\nJones served as the executive secretary of the Fellowship of Reconciliation, devoted to the nonviolent resolution of conflicts, from 1919 to 1929. A colleague there was John Nevin Sayre.\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nJOHN NEVIN SAYRE (I)\n\nWith Paul Jones\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nSayre came from a distinguished family. He, born on February 4, 1884, at South Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, was a grandson of John Williamson Nevin (1803-1886), the great German Reformed minister and Mercersburg theologian. Our saint’s aunt was Alice Nevin (1837-1925), who contributed much to the life of the Reformed Church in the United States and to the civil life of Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Sayre’s mother was Martha Finley Nevin (1824-1917), daughter of John Williamson Nevin and sister of Alice. Our saint’s father was Robert Heysham Sayre (1844-1917), the manager of the Bethlehem Iron Works and the founder of the Sayre Mining and Manufacturing Company. Sayre’s brother was Francis Bowes Sayre, Sr. (1885-1972), an attorney and diplomat. Francis Sr. was a professor at Harvard Law School (1917-1923), the Advisor in Foreign Affairs to the King of Siam (1923-1925), the U.S. Ambassador to Siam (1925-1932), the Director of the Harvard Institute of Criminal Law (1932-1933), the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State (1933-1939), the High Commissioner of the Philippines (1939-1942), and the U.S. Representative to the United Nations Leadership Council (1947-1952). In 1913 he married Jessie Woodrow Wilson (died in 1933), daughter of President (Thomas) Woodrow Wilson (in office 1913-1921). Through Francis Sr. our saint was able to gain access to prominent people, such as President Wilson, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt (in office 1933-1945), General Douglas MacArthur (1880-1964), and Emperor Hirohito (reigned 1926-1989).\n\nOur saint was a well-educated man. He graduated from Princeton University (B.A., 1907) and the Episcopal Theological School, Cambridge, Massachusetts (B.D., 1911). He also studied at the Union Theological Seminary, New York, New York (1908-1910) and the University of Marburg, Germany (1913-1914). Sayre also taught at Princeton University (1911-1912) and at Boone University, Wuchang, China (1913).\n\nSayre became a pacifist in 1914. He agreed with Jones that warfare was incompatible with the life and teachings of Jesus of Nazareth. Sayre, Assistant Rector (1915-1916) then Rector (1916-1919) of Christ Church, Suffern, New York, found his congregation to be less than fully supportive of his pacifism. He resigned and helped to found Brookwood School (1919-1921), where he taught nonviolence for two years. In 1921, when Brookwood School became Brookwood Labor College, an experimental residential two-year institution for workers, he transferred to the U.S. branch of the Fellowship of Reconciliation. (He had helped to found that branch six years earlier.) Sayre edited The World Tomorrow from 1922 to 1924 and served as the organization’s associate secretary from 1924 to 1935, serving under Jones during part of that time. Sayre traveled the world as he sought to resolve conflicts nonviolently. In 1927, for example, he, via Francis Sr., gained access to U.S. senators and State Department officials and thereby succeeded in halting the planned U.S. bombing of innocent civilians during a conflict in Nicaragua.\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nPAUL JONES (II)\n\nWith John Nevin Sayre\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nJones spent his final years as the chaplain of Antioch College, Yellow Springs, Ohio. He also functioned as a spiritual advisor to students and a member of the faculty, as a well as a traveling speaker. Other causes for which our saint advocated were economic justice (from a Christian Socialist perspective) and civil rights for African Americans. In 1939 he and Sayre helped to found the Episcopal Pacifist Fellowship (now the Episcopal Peace Fellowship). Toward the end of his life Jones helped to resettle European Jews fleeing the Nazis. He died of multiple myeloma at Yellow Springs on September 4, 1941. He was 60 years old.\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nJOHN NEVIN SAYRE (II)\n\nWith Francis Bowes Sayre, Jr.\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nSayre, active in pacifist activism for most of his life, spent most of that life with Kathleen Whitaker, also his partner in activism. She and her mother, pacifists, had emigrated from England in 1916. Kathleen became the second Mrs. Sayre in 1922; the marriage ended when Sayre died in 1977. (Sayre had married his first wife, Helen Augusta Bangs, on June 28, 1910. She died two years and two days later.) Other organizations through which the Sayres worked for peace and reconciliation included, of course, the Episcopal Pacifist/Peace Fellowship, the National Peace Conference and the International Fellowship of Witness. Their pacifism translated, not surprisingly, into opposition to the Vietnam War.\n\nOther favored causes included helping conscientious objectors in Europe and the United States during World War II, sparing the lives and facilitating the release and repatriation of Japanese prisoners of war after that conflict, advocating for civil liberties, and working for civil rights for African Americans. Sayre died at South Hyack, New York, on September 13, 1977. He was 93 years old.\n\nA nephew, Francis Bowes Sayre, Jr. (1915-2008), a grandson of Woodrow Wilson, became an Episcopal priest, and from 1951 to 1978, the Dean of Washington National Cathedral. True to his family heritage, he opposed Jim Crow, McCarthyism, and the Vietnam War.\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nAs time moved on, so did ecclesiastical institutions. The Lambeth Conference of 1958 approved the following resolutions:\n\nResolution 101 The Reconciling of Conflicts Between and Within Nations\n\nThe Church’s Work of Reconciliation The Conference urges all members of the Anglican Communion to further the ministry of reconciliation by: (a) developing deeper understanding and fellowship with churchmen of every land; (b) extending the use of clergy and lay workers in lands other than their own, the exchange of teachers and seminarians, and the participation by lay visitors in the Church life of the countries they visit; (c) the general use of the Anglican Cycle of Prayer to undergird this wider sense of community; (d) participation everywhere in the wider community of all Christian people in the ecumenical opportunities open to them.\n\nResolution 102 The Reconciling of Conflicts Between and Within Nations – Christian Citizenship\n\nThe Conference calls upon all Christian people to recognise their duty of exercising to the full their responsibility as citizens in the national and international policies of their governments.\n\nResolution 103 The Reconciling of Conflicts Between and Within Nations – Christian Citizenship\n\nThe Conference calls upon all Christian people to strive by the exercise of mutual understanding, calm reason, and constant prayer, to reconcile all those who are involved in racial, political, economic, or other conflicts.\n\nResolution 104 The Reconciling of Conflicts Between and Within Nations – The Rights of Men and Nations\n\nThe Conference declares that the Church is not to be identified with any particular political or social system, and calls upon all Christians to encourage their governments to respect the dignity and freedom of people within their own nations and the right of people of other nations to govern themselves.\n\nResolution 105 The Reconciling of Conflicts Between and Within Nations – Sharing Material Resources\n\nThe Conference draws attention to the widespread poverty in many parts of the world; it notes with thankfulness the measures taken to help under-developed countries to become self-supporting, and calls upon Christians in more favoured lands to use their influence to encourage their governments in the task of relieving poverty by a generous sharing of their material and technical resources with those in need.\n\nResolution 106 The Reconciling of Conflicts Between and Within Nations – Modern Warfare and Christian Responsibility\n\nThe Conference reaffirms that war as a method of settling international disputes is incompatible with the teaching and example of our Lord Jesus Christ, and declares that nothing less than the abolition of war itself should be the goal of the nations, their leaders, and all citizens. As an essential step towards achieving this goal the Conference calls upon Christians to press through their governments, as a matter of the utmost urgency, for the abolition by international agreement of nuclear bombs and other weapons of similar indiscriminate destructive power, the use of which is repugnant to the Christian conscience. To this end governments should accept such limitations of their own sovereignty as effective control demands. The Conference further urges the governments of the leading nations of the world to devote their utmost efforts at once to framing a comprehensive international disarmament treaty, which shall also provide for the progressive reduction of armed forces and conventional armaments to the minimum necessary for the maintenance of internal security and the fulfilment of the obligations of states to maintain peace and security in accordance with the United Nations Charter.\n\nResolution 107 The Reconciling of Conflicts Between and Within Nations – Modern Warfare and Christian Responsibility\n\nThe Conference calls Christians to subject to intense prayer and study their attitudes to the issues involved in modern warfare, and urges the Church to continue to consult regularly with scientists and political leaders about the many problems of ethics and conscience which arise from advances in nuclear research.\n\nResolution 108 The Reconciling of Conflicts Between and Within Nations – The United Nations\n\nThe Conference affirms the need for strengthening the United Nations and to this end: (a) urges that serious consideration be given to the revision of its Charter, the more effective use of, and respect for, the existing processes of international justice, and to the creation of adequate means for enforcing its decisions; (b) commends wholeheartedly the work done under the aegis of the United Nations, whereby the skills and resources of member nations are made available for the benefit of the whole of humanity; (c) recommends that all Church people be asked to pray for God’s blessing upon the officers and declared purposes of the United Nations; (d) urges that all Church people be asked to encourage community study regarding the constitution, the plans, and the needs of the United Nations.\n\nResolution 109 The Reconciling of Conflicts Between and Within Nations – The United Nations\n\nThe Conference draws attention to the work of the Committee of the Churches on International Affairs (within the World Council of Churches) and urges Anglicans to support its efforts to bring an informed Christian opinion to bear on international issues.\n\nResolution 110 The Reconciling of Conflicts Between and Within Nations – Condemnation of Racial Discrimination\n\nThe Conference affirms its belief in the natural dignity and value of every man, of whatever colour or race, as created in the image of God. In the light of this belief the Conference affirms that neither race nor colour is in itself a barrier to any aspect of that life in family and community for which God created all men. It therefore condemns discrimination of any kind on the grounds of race or colour alone. The Conference would urge that in multi-racial societies members of all races shall be allowed: (a) a fair and just share in the government of their country; (b) a fair and just share in the control, development, and rewards of the natural resources of their country, including advancement to the highest level of attainment; (c) the right to associate freely in worship, in education, in industry, in recreation, and in all other departments of the common life.\n\nResolution 111 The Reconciling of Conflicts Between and Within Nations – The Church in an Industrial Age\n\nThe Conference urges the provinces of the Anglican Communion to give special study to the task, strategy, and ministry of the Church within industrial society, and by the use of bold and imaginative experiments to strengthen the impact of the Christian faith upon the whole life and pattern of industry.\n\nSource = link\n\nI am not a pacifist. I have tried to become one, but I have not been able to, pardon the term, reconcile certain uncomfortable realities with idealism. Sometimes the best choice is a bad one, albeit the least or lesser bad choice. I write this post on the anniversary of the dropping of the first atomic bomb in 1945. As much as I deplore the human costs (including to innocent civilians) inherent in that act, I also know that the human costs (including to innocent civilians) would have been far worse had an invasion of the Japanese home islands occurred. Forcing Japanese surrender also kept Soviet troops out of Japan. President Harry Truman made the decision he had to make; he chose the lesser of two evils when no good option was available. I also recognize the fact that reconciling with, not antagonizing, Japan after World War II made the world a better place for Allies and Japanese alike. I wonder world history would have been different had the victorious Allies been kind to Germany and nicer to Japan at Versailles Palace in 1919.\n\nAlthough I am not a pacifist, I refuse to condemn those who are. They remind the rest of us of the importance of seeking peace–not just the absence of conflict, but the reality of reconciliation. “An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth” may have been originally a moral step forward, insofar as its purpose was to curtail violence, but reconciliation is superior. As Delenn, the Minbari Ambassador to Babylon 5, said in Passing Through Gethsemane (1995), one of my favorite episodes of Babylon 5 (1994-1998), “An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth” leaves many people blind and toothless. Is it not better for all of us to retain our eyes and teeth and to strive for peace, or at least the absence of conflict? Some violence is necessary, sadly, but most of it is morally unjustifiable. Frequently the motivation for violence is revenge or pride, not self-defense. Even when violence is in self-defense, it might damage the one who commits it. Wildred Owen (who died a week before the armistice in 1918, wrote a poem in the voice of two soldiers. One soldiers tells the other:\n\nI am the enemy you killed, my friend.\n\nI knew you in the dark; for so you frowned\n\nYesterday through me as you jabbed and killed.\n\nLet us sleep now….\n\nAlso, given the long tradition of people from various religions (including, unfortunately, Christianity, named after the executed Prince of Peace) engaging in violence at the proverbial drop of a hat, from antiquity to the present day, I derive comfort from the fact many faithful people seek to incite nonviolence in the name of God.\n\nKENNETH RANDOLPH TAYLOR\n\nAUGUST 6, 2016 COMMON ERA\n\nTHE FEAST OF THE TRANSFIGURATION\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nMerciful God, you sent your beloved Son to preach peace to those who are far off and to those who are near:\n\nRaise up in this and every land witnesses who, after the examples of your servants\n\nPaul Jones and John Nevin Sayre,\n\nwill stand firm in proclaiming the Gospel of the Prince of Peace,\n\nour Savior Jesus Christ, who lives and reigns with you\n\nand the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever. Amen.\n\nMalachi 2:17-3:5\n\nPsalm 76\n\n1 Peter 3:8-14a\n\nJohn 8:31-32\n\n–Adapted from Holy Women, Holy Men: Celebrating the Saints (2010), page 561\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++"
