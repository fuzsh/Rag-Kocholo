Biography

Rupert Eva Wilson was born at Williamstown, South Australia,⁠[1] on 31 May 1887.⁠[2] He was the fourth child and second son of George Wilson and Eva Jane Amelia Worden.

On 29 May 1897, two days before his tenth birthday, Rupert Wilson was admitted to Royal Adelaide Hospital.⁠[3] The nature of his illness is not recorded.

Rupert married Helen McClintock in Goodwood⁠[4] on 7 June 1905.⁠[5]

Rupert and Helen had the following children:⁠[6]

George William Wilson (born 3 February 1907),

Jean Eva Wilson (born 27 August 1908),

Norma Rae Wilson (born 15 August 1910),

Hector Rupert Wilson (born 23 April 1912),

Joan Ailsa Wilson (born 7 January 1914),

Kenneth John Wilson (born 8 September 1919).

All the children were born in Williamstown.

In a notice in The South Australian Government Gazette on 20 November 1919 the District Council of Mount Crawford announced that John William Antwiss, Rupert Eva Wilson and Percival Kohler had been appointed and sworn in as constables.⁠[7] Rupert was following in the footsteps of his father George, who had been a Mount Crawford district constable some 37 years previously.

In June 1923 Rupert Eva Wilson nominated for the position of Auditor for Mount Crawford District Council,⁠[8] but G. A. Leditschke was elected.⁠[9]

In December 1924 a newspaper article on the annual sports meeting of the Williamstown R.A.O.B. Lodge⁠[10] tells us that R. E. Wilson was one of the committee members.⁠[11]

In The News on 23 October 1926 an advertisement from the Neptune Oil Company proclaimed that Waratah Motor Spirit ("the spirit that moves") was obtainable at the Blue Pumps in thirty eight (listed) places in South Australia, and could also be obtained from Blue Pumps at all Important Country Towns. One of the listed places was "Williamstown—R. E. Wilson".⁠[12]

On page 126 of "The Barossa Council Heritage Review Volume III" (2001)⁠[13] there is a photograph of the old house on Queen Street Williamstown at the corner with Yettie Road. This is on land that Rupert's mother inherited from her great uncle, and was formerly the butcher's shop operated by Rupert's father. The blurb below the photograph tells us that "there was also a motor car repair shop in the adjacent corrugated iron shed"; no doubt it was here that Rupert sold Waratah Motor Spirit, though the blue pump has long since disappeared.⁠[14]

The Queen Street and Yettie Road corner block comprised most of Allotment 38 of the original survey of Williamstown, which Josiah Eva had purchased from George Warren in 1862 for £13 15s.,⁠[15]⁠[16] and a small piece of Section 28, Hundred of Barossa. Josiah Eva had purchased Section 28 for £88 at a government land sale in 1857,⁠[17] and still owned forty of these eighty-eight acres at the time of his death.⁠[18] Josiah's land passed to the executors of his will and then to Rupert's mother, apart from two acres to Rupert's aunt Alice Anna Johnson. Rupert's mother sold a small part of Allotment 38 to a neighbour in 1928⁠[19] and 34½ acres of Section 28 to the wife of a nephew in 1830.⁠[20] At her death her remaining land, including the Queen Street and Yettie Road corner block, passed to Leila, Rupert's eldest sibling.

Although the Barossa Council Heritage Review document mentioned above⁠[13] says that the block remained in the Wilson family until 1970, in fact Leila sold it in 1951 to Allen Thomas Argent of Williamstown (a butcher).⁠[21]

An advertisement in the Angaston paper The Leader on 23 December 1926 announced that the Stringybank Draught Horse Racing Club (Unlimited and unbiassed) would hold their initial Race Meeting and Sports, under the auspices of the R.A.O.B. Lodge, on January 1st, 1927, on Lyndoch Oval and Racecourse. The nominations received for principal event, the Lyndoch Derby, included R. E. Wilson's "The Crank".

Aspects of the advertisement suggest that the Draught Horse Race Meeting was not intended to be an entirely serious event. For example, the list of officials included J. Twoup (Judge), Wally Dazzler (Stipendiary Steward) and W. Millinghundredweight (committee member). The rules and regulations specified that jockeys were not permitted to use whips, spurs, sticks or curbed bits, though doping and batteries were not objected to. Anyone found trying to square a jockey would be courtmartialled, tarred and feathered.⁠[22]

On 7 June 1927 Hector Wilson, son of Mr R. E. Wilson of Williamstown fell from a tree and fractured his arm below the elbow, and sustained severe bruises on his legs and back. He managed to reach his bicycle and rode home. He was motored to the Gawler Hospital.⁠[23]

An obituary in The Advertiser tells us that Miss Jean Wilson, eldest daughter of Mr and Mrs R. E. Wilson of Williamstown died on 18 August 1927 after a long and serious illness. Prior to her sickness Miss Wilson was employed as an assistant in the Williamstown post-office and telephone exchange. She was of a bright disposition, a good tennis player, and always a moving spirit in all social activities. At the time of her death she was 19 years of age.⁠[24]

In The Mail on 17 September 1927 an advertisement from the Neptune Oil Company informed motorists that using Neptune Motor Oils gives you more power, less carbon, greater mileage and absence of engine trouble. The advertisement lists 58 places at which Neptune Motor Oils could be obtained, including "Williamstown—R. E. Wilson". The advertisement adds "also from all Leading Service Stations and Garages", which was presumably not meant to suggest that the 58 listed places were not Leading Service Stations or Garages.⁠[25]

On 28 December 1927 the A.O. Foresters and R.A.O. Buffalo held very successful combined Lodge sports on the picturesque Victoria Recreation Park at Williamstown. R. E. Wilson was a member of the committee.⁠[26]

Sands and McDougall's South Australian directory for 1928 includes an entry for Wilson R. E., "mtr grge, Williamstown".⁠[27] Similar entries occur for all subsequent years up to 1942,⁠[28] after which they cease.

The following two notices were published in The Commonwealth of Australia Gazette, on 20 November 1930 and 13 August 1931 respectively.⁠[29]⁠[30]

In the Court of Bankruptcy, District of South Australia.

No. 129 of 1930.—Re RUPERT EVA WILSON, of Williamstown, and lately residing at Williamstown.

Date of petition—13th October, 1930.

Date of sequestration order—7th November, 1930.

NOTICE OF INTENDED FIRST AND FINAL DIVIDENDS

In the Court of Bankruptcy, District of South Australia.

No. 129 of 1930.—Re RUPERT EVA WILSON, of Williamstown, and lately residing at Williamstown, garage proprietor.

In July 1939 Rupert Eva Wilson appeared in the bankruptcy court, with liabilities of £862 12/1 and assets of £92 13/9.⁠[31] The Advertiser reported as follows.⁠[32]

Hopes From Mica Mine.

That he was putting down a developmental shaft in a mica field near Williamstown, and that he would, if the venture turned out profitable, make some payment for the benefit of his creditors, was stated by Rupert Eva Wilson, motor garage proprietor of Williamstown, whose estate was sequestrated on the petition of the Vacuum Oil Co., Ltd., city, on November 7 1930. He ascribed his failure to sickness and to losses in his business His liabilities were £862 12/1, and his assets £92 13/9. His examination was declared closed.

A bankruptcy court notice published in February 1844 announced that there would be a supplementary dividend in the estate no. S. 129 of 1930, Re Rupert Eva Wilson.⁠[33] However, there is nothing to suggest that the mica mine venture had turned out profitable.

On 30 October 1931 the Cycling column of the newspaper The Sport reported that the Williamstown Sports committee had advised the League that it would hold its annual Christmas sports meeting on December 28. Messrs D. R. Elliott and R. E. Wilson, of the Williamstown committee, stated during the week that the track was in excellent condition and that the Angaston Club would probably hold its Christmas fixture on December 26.⁠[34]

The list of officers elected at the annual meeting of the Williamstown (Australian Rules) Football Club held in April 1932 includes two "delegates", one of whom was R. E. Wilson.⁠[35]

Norma R. Wilson, daughter of Mr and Mrs R. E. Wilson of Williamstown, married Gordon G. Phillips, son of Mr and Mrs S. Phillips of Berri, at the Mitchell Memorial Church, Goodwood, at 7 p.m. on 8 September 1934.⁠[36]

In The Advertiser of 29 May 1935, the Social Notes (conducted by Idra) says that the engagement was announced of Jean, youngest daughter of Mr and Mrs R. E. Wilson of Williamstown, to Alva, elder son of Mrs E. J. Parham, of Gawler.⁠[37] (There was a misprint: her name was actually Joan, not Jean.)

Land title certificates CT/119/24 and CT/763/140 bear identical endorsements reading as follows:⁠[38]

Memorandum of Appointment No. 1163545

whereby the within land is now vested in John Stuart Hammat of Williamstown Orchardist Arthur William Holmes of 3 Moorhouse Avenue Glen Osmond Saw-mill owner Archibald Bain the younger Builder Rupert Eva Wilson Motor Mechanic and Josiah Smith Holmes Orchardist all of Willliamstown for an estate in fee simple by virtue of a memorial filed with the Registrar of Companies under the provisions of the Public Library Museum and Art Gallery and Institutes Act 1909 and Act 1632 of 1924.

Produced for registration the 2 day of February 1934 at 2 30 pm

Mount Crawford District Council was the proprietor of both pieces of land, and diagrams in the certificates show that the pieces were contiguous and together form the block on which the District Soldiers Memorial Institute is situated. Clearly we can conclude that Rupert was one of the institute trustees, presumably appointed shortly before 2 February 1934.

The same title certificates have similar endorsements showing that Rupert's father George Wilson had been one of the institute trustees from 16 April 1923, which is about the time that the decision was taken to convert the Mount Crawford District Council Hall into the District Soldiers Memorial Institute.⁠[39] ("The Barossa Council Heritage Review Volume III" says, on page 116,⁠[40] that the conversion took place in 1910, but this is clearly wrong.) Apparently George was was a trustee until his death in September 1933, after which Rupert was appointed in his place.

The precise provisions of the two acts of parliament mentioned are not particularly relevant for our present purposes, but are available.⁠[41]⁠[42]

At the annual meeting of the institute, held in the Memorial Hall, Williamstown, in February 1938, R. E. Wilson was elected one of two auditors.⁠[43]

Rupert E. Wilson, beloved husband of Helen, died on 11 September 1955, aged 68, and his wife Helen died on 25 September 1971, aged 87. A photograph of their gravestone⁠[44] (giving the above information) is available from the Willaston Cemetery page⁠[45] on the Australian Cemeteries website.

It is recorded that Rupert's final place of residence was at Blanchetown.⁠[46] This information comes from cemetery records,⁠[47] presumably held by the Gawler Town Council, although that council does not provide a facility for accessing the information.
