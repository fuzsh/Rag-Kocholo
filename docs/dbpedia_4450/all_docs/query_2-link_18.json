        "text": "1963\n\nIn October Loganair’s first scheduled flight took off between Dundee and Turnhouse Airport, Edinburgh, to coincide with the requirements of contractors who were working on the Tay Road Bridge. Another service was also set up for the business personnel travelling between the two cities, on an on-demand basis.\n\n1967\n\nLoganair commenced the Orkney Inter Isles service which connected mainland Kirkwall to the smaller islands. In the same year, a supplementary air ambulance contract was also won.\n\nThe Britten Norman Islander aircraft, the latest version of which still operates the Inter-Isles service, was to be key in the Loganair ambulance operation, however the first ambulance flight was operated by Piper Aztec.\n\n2008\n\nThe British Airways franchise agreement came to an end and Loganair took this opportunity to enter into a new franchise agreement with Flybe. The long association with British Airways continued though via a codeshare arrangement, with Loganair’s flights marketed as connecting BA flights to London and beyond.\n\n2017\n\nTime for Loganair to fly once again under its own name as the franchise agreement with Flybe ended. The airline started flew “solo” from 1st September 2017. This was the first time in 25 years that Loganair had flown under its own brand, requiring a brand re-launch, new website and reservations systems.\n\nA new identity was inspired by the Scottish tartan pattern that flew with British Airways 20 years ago and the Loganair Tartan is registered as number 11744 in the Scottish Register of Tartans.\n\n2019\n\nThe route network has grown with now over 70 routes to and from; Scotland, England, the Channel Islands, Belgium, Isle of Man, Norway, Ireland, Denmark and Germany. New interline arrangements have been agreed with some of the world’s leading airlines to further enhance connectivity for our customers.\n\nLoganair has also introduced Embraer jets to the fleet to enhance the destination offering and improve customer experience.\n\nIn 2019 Loganair took the title of SPAA Domestic Airline of the year, voted for by the Scottish Travel Industry.\n\n2020 onwards...\n\nAfter the demise of Flybe in March 2020, Loganair took the opportunity to start operating some of Flybe's former routes expanding the route network and working with new airports such as Newquay, Southampton, Birmingham, Exeter and Belfast City.\n\nThis increase in destinations and routes means that Loganair is now the largest operator of domestic routes in the Uk and also the largest operator at Aberdeen Airport.\n\nA fleet renewal program was put in place replacing Loganair's Dornier 328's with ATR 42's and 72's increasing the capacity on many of Loganair's core routes."
