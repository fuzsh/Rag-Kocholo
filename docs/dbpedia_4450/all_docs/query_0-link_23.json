        "text": "Queues at Stansted Airport after IT outage\n\nCustomers faced long queues at London Stansted Airport due to a worldwide IT outage.\n\nDisruptions have been reported across the globe, affecting airlines, media, and banks.\n\nA London Stansted spokesperson said some check-ins and boarding processes were being carried out manually but \"flights are operating as normal\".\n\nThe airport said its main operational systems were unaffected but some retail payment machine services had been impacted.\n\nA London Stansted spokesperson said some check-in and boarding processes were taking \"longer than usual\" for affected airlines who needed to process passengers manually.\n\nThey added: \"The majority of flights operating from the airport are unaffected, but the terminal is slightly busier than usual as a result of the situation.\"\n\nThe airport advised passengers to check with their airline before leaving home.\n\nRyanair, which operates flights from the airport, advised passengers to arrive three hours before their scheduled departure time.\n\nSome rail services were also affected.\n\nGreater Anglia said some of its stations had been impacted.\n\nThe operator said some tickets are not working at electronic gates and it advised customers to factor in additional time.\n\nc2c reported that servicers were running as normal, however there had been issues accessing its app.\n\nIt has not been confirmed if the problem was linked to the global outage.\n\nDrivers using the Dartford Crossing are currently unable to make payments for crossings or top-up accounts.\n\nA National Highways spokesperson said: \"Please be assured we are monitoring the issue closely and considering the impacts on customers. We apologise for any inconvenience caused.\"\n\nHealthcare\n\nSome GP surgeries, were also affected, with the outage affecting EMIS Web, a system which allows GPs to manage appointments, conduct consultations and update, store and share patient records.\n\nGreat Bentley Surgery in Tendring posted on Facebook and said it had been impacted.\n\nIt was unable to access patient records, medications, test results and prescriptions which it said \"makes consultations very limited\".\n\nIt added: \"If you still have an appointment at the surgery, you can still attend, but please be aware of the very limited service and it may be difficult to consult properly.\"\n\nDr Katharine Patel, a GP at Mersea Island Medical Practice, told BBC Essex that the outage was affecting its appointments system.\n\n\"But within that it has individual patient consultation notes, details, blood results, communications from hospitals and other healthcare providers.\"\n\nShe said there were a lot of issues at other practices around the Colchester and Tendring area.\n\nDr Patel said her surgery said some practices had access to a \"very limited\" back-up system, but many did not even have that.\n\nShe said the practice was doing what they could for patients and issuing paper prescriptions - but operating at about only 5% capacity.\n\n\"There's a lot of work that we can't do,\" she added.\n\nNHS Herts and West Essex Integrated Care Board (ICB) said a \"handful\" of GP practices in west Essex had been affected.\n\nThe ICB said measures, such as paper records and handwritten prescriptions, had been put in place.\n\nSome pharmacies have also been unable to access digital prescriptions.\n\nAn NHS spokesperson said it was aware of an issue with EMIS that had caused \"disruption in the majority of GP practices\".\n\n“The NHS has long standing measures in place to manage the disruption, including using paper patient records and handwritten prescriptions, and the usual phone systems to contact your GP,\" they said.\n\n“There is currently no known impact on 999 or emergency services, so people should use these services as they usually would.\n\n“Patients should attend appointments unless told otherwise. Only contact your GP if it’s urgent, and otherwise please use 111 online or call 111.\"\n\nFollow Essex news on Facebook, Instagram and X. Got a story?
