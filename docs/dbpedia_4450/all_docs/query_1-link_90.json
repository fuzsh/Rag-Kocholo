        "text": "Aer Lingus now has a direct flight JFK to Manchester (1900 ex JFK arrive 0700, return at 1430 arrive 1715) . Or from Newark to EDI or GLA, changing at Dublin.\n\nJFK to MAN RT next May starts at $500 hand baggage only or $670 checked baggage.\n\nTrain MAN to EDI is about Â£30 each way booked in advance- 3 1/2 hour journey.\n\nBut might be better than hanging around in Dublin for a connecting flight, if you left from Newark.\n\nOr from Philadelphia Aer Lingus have 2 flights daily, connecting at Dublin-\n\nPHL depart 1800, EDI arrive 0905 (2 1/4 hr DUB connection) or 2040 arrive 1125 (90 minute DUB connection).\n\nHi Carole\n\nI am a fairly frequent traveller from Scotland to the US and Edinburgh is well served by direct daily flights next July (frequency may be less in May). The options at present are:\n\nUnited Airlines Newark (normally twice daily), Washington and Chicago\n\nDelta JFK, Boston and Atlanta\n\nJetBlue JFK ( a new route announced this week)\n\nAmerican Airlines used to serve Philadelphia and it is rumoured to return but not until 2025\n\nGlasgow has no direct flights (if you ignore Florida holiday flights) but sometimes its indirect flights are cheaper than Edinburgh although it is less convenient if your destination is Edinburgh).\n\nIf you go indirect, the main options are London Heathrow, Amsterdam, Paris and Dublin although you can always look also at Frankfurt and Brussels (my personal preference would be Amsterdam). Glasgow also has the option of flying via Iceland on Icelandair.\n\nManchester may be an option if your destination is Glasgow or Southwest Scotland but I wouldn't recommend it if your destination is Edinburgh or the Highlands; you will spend a large part of your first day travelling from the airport and you will need to stay overnight in Manchester before your return flight and it also has fewer flights than the other indirect options (and Edinburgh during the summer).\n\nOne additional point for Carole. She asked whether, when arriving at Heathrow, you should get a train from London to Glasgow or Edinburgh. My advice is not to do so unless you are intending to do so after spending some time in London. If you plan to travel onwards to Scotland on arrival, you should book a through ticket to Glasgow or Edinburgh as the long land transfer from London is not something that I would relish after a long flight. Also I would not advise that you book the Glasgow or Edinburgh flight separately; if you do so, then if your transatlantic flight is delayed you will not be rebooked on a later connecting flight and will have to buy a new ticket. You will also, in any event, have to collect your luggage at Heathrow and check it in again rather than just collect it at Glasgow or Edinburgh.\n\nOn a similar vein on long land transfers, thanks for the clarification which was helpful; I am surprised that the journey time from Glasgow is so long. I appreciate that from the English region that you live in, Manchester is a good option but as there are so many good direct and one stop options (including Dublin which you suggest) to Scotland which deliver you to airports 30 minutes from Glasgow and Edinburgh city centres, Manchester is just not an airport that, in my experience, most frequent travellers (in Edinburgh at least) would consider using nowadays (my wife has firmly ruled it out this morning for any family holidays!). However, I appreciate that some travellers don't mind long land transfers after transatlantic flights and that due to lower demand from the US, there may be bargains flying to Manchester. The potential fly in the ointment are a repeat of this year's rail strikes on which you have made many helpful posts. A rail strike either has no (or minimal) impact on flights out of Glasgow or Edinburgh but for Manchester from Edinburgh would entail a 6 to 8 hour coach journey or hiring a car (which would be expensive and difficult on short notice and is never to be recommended on an arrival from the US).\n\nWhatever route you choose Carole, I hope that you have a great trip to Scotland.\n\nIf you can't get on a direct flight, and take a connection, stick with flying.\n\nMake sure you buy your entire journey as one ticket. So PHL to GLA/EDI as one even if you connect. This way, if there is a problem, the airline is responsible to get you to your final destination. If delayed, they must put you on the next available flight. They may also have to offer food/accomodations/floor show. Okay, maybe not a floor show.\n\nIf you decide to take the train part of the way, and there is a problem with your original flight, or a problem with the trains, the airline is not responsible for the rest of your journey.\n\nI travel a great deal by air. If I can't get a direct flight and need to get a connection, I try to connect at an airport that gives me multiple options. If there is only one flight a day, and you miss it, you have to wait until the next day and hope there is room for you.\n\nSo, for Glasgow or Edinburgh, if I have to connect outside the US, I would first look at London Heathrow/Gatwick or Dublin due to the many flight from those airports to Scotland. I also try not to change airports within in a city if I can.\n\nAs a side note, my last three direct trains from Manchester to Scotland on TransPenine Express were cancelled last minute. I had to make numerous connections. Do you really need that hassle after a long transatlantic flight?"
