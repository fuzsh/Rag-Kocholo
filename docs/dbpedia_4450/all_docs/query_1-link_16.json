        "text": "Travelling by air with firearms within the UK is generally not difficult providing you follow the airlines’ conditions of carriage.\n\nTravelling from overseas to the UK with firearms is also relatively trouble-free provided you have the necessary permits, advise the airline you are travelling with and follow their conditions of carriage. For information on visitor permits and other advice follow this link.\n\nNote: It has been brought to our attention that Lufthansa is refusing to carry firearms and shotguns on flights into Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Inverness and Heathrow airports, regardless of whether passengers hold the necessary visitor permits; this would appear to be a commercial decision for Lufthansa and does not result from Scottish Government or UK Government policy.\n\nBASC Scotland and SCSTG are working to resolve this issue but in the meantime anyone wishing to travel to Scotland for country sports should be aware, double check with their airline and if necessary make alternative arrangements.\n\nIn all instances of travelling by air with firearms we would advise contacting the airline at the time of booking to ensure you comply with their conditions of carriage.\n\nGlasgow International Airport\n\nGlasgow is Scotland’s principal long-haul gateway, with some 30 airlines serving around 90 destinations worldwide.
