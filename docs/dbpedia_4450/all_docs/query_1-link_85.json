        "text": "This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy partner and I spent an unforgettable weekend on Barra, a beautiful island in Scotland.\n\nBarra is a western island in Scotland's Outer Hebrides which is known for its natural beauty.\n\nI was intrigued to visit this past weekend after reading that Barra's white sandy beaches have been compared to the Caribbean. The island has been nicknamed \"Barrabados\" and \"Barradise\" by locals, according to the Daily Mail.\n\nAfter spending two days on the island, I concur that its beaches are gorgeous and unlike anything I'd ever seen in Scotland. I also overheard fellow tourists referring to the island as \"Barrabados,\" which gave me a chuckle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the most fascinating things about the island is its airport.\n\nFrom our home in Glasgow, Barra is accessible via ferry from Oban, which takes just under five hours, or by plane which takes just over one hour from Glasgow Airport.\n\nWe initially planned to take the ferry, but a couple of days before our visit we noticed there had been some last-minute cancellations due to poor weather conditions. We swiftly changed our plans and purchased a round-trip flight with the Scottish airline Loganair.\n\nI was excited because of what I'd read about Barra Airport: It's the only airport in the world where scheduled commercial flights use a tidal beach as the runway, according to the Highlands and Islands Airport.\n\nThe airport is a tourist attraction and the beach is accessible to the public when flights aren't operating.\n\nThe round-trip cost Â£164, or around $199, per person.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe began our journey at Glasgow Airport.\n\nOur flight departed from Glasgow Airport, where I have journeyed many times over the years. However, this adventure was different from the outset.\n\nWhen booking our tickets a couple of days in advance, I was shown an online seating chart which revealed that the plane we were due to board had only 19 seats.\n\nWhen our gate was called, my partner and I made our way to a small waiting area. There were a total of 13 passengers waiting to board the plane, including us.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoarding the plane was a smooth and easy process.\n\nThe flight was delayed by around 40 minutes, but we didn't mind the wait. Unlike what I usually experience, there was a lack of noise and commotion at our gate, which made the waiting peaceful and stress-free.\n\nWhen it was time to board, we formed a small line and made it onto the plane in a matter of minutes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere were 13 passengers and no flight attendants on board.\n\nA man who I initially thought was a flight attendant stood outside the plane and welcomed every passenger on board. It wasn't until we took our seats that the man introduced himself as the pilot.\n\nThere were no flight attendants on board â only the pilot and the captain â and the pilot was the one to go through the flight safety instructions before taking off.\n\nHe asked that we keep our seat belts on for the entire duration of the journey and that all electronic devices be switched off or on airplane mode.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe were seated near the front of the aircraft.\n\nMy partner had a window seat and I had an aisle seat; we were just a couple of rows from the cockpit at the front of the plane.\n\nOne thing I immediately noticed was the lack of amenities that you would find on most planes. For example, there was no toilet on the plane, no overhead lockers to store our belongings, and no tray tables.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI was thankful that the seat across the aisle was empty â I used it to store my belongings.\n\nMy partner had a small suitcase that was put in the hold before we boarded the plane. However, because I only had a backpack, I decided to take it on board with me, assuming that I would be able to place it in an overhead compartment â but there were none.\n\nMost people on board placed belongings at their feet. But luckily for me, the seat across the aisle was vacant, so I ended up using it as storage space for my bag and jacket.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere wasn't a lot of leg room.\n\nThere wasn't a lot of legroom, so I was thankful that I was able to use the seat across from me to store my luggage.\n\nThe lack of a tray table was also difficult to get used to, especially as I had brought a hot chocolate that I had purchased from the airport onto the plane. Thankfully, there were pockets on the seats in front of us which we used to store my water bottle and snacks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy favourite thing about the flight was the incredible views of Scotland below.\n\nThe plane's engine was rather loud, so my partner and I didn't talk much during the flight. But we didn't mind â the scenery from the window kept us entertained.\n\nI loved watching the city fold into the countryside from above.\n\nThe scenery got better as the flight continued.\n\nAs we got closer to Barra, we passed a couple of popular landmarks, including Loch Lomond, as well as islands on the west coast.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI captured this photo of a rainbow from our window.\n\nThe weather in Glasgow had been gloomy before our departure, but when we arrived in Barra the sun was shining and the sky was mostly clear and bright. I saw a rainbow from the plane window for the first time ever, which was one of the highlights of the journey.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust over an hour after departing, we landed on the beach.\n\nThe flight took one hour and 15 minutes, and it was undoubtedly the most incredible flying experience of my life. When we landed on the beach at Barra Airport, I could see everything clearly since the window of the cockpit was visible from where I sat on the plane.\n\nWe even heard the splash of the water against the wheels of the plane as we touched down on the runway.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe beautiful scenery made up for the lack of luxury on board.\n\nOverall, the small and cramped space and lack of amenities made for an un-glamorous flight, but this didn't feel like a big deal seeing as the journey was so short.\n\nDespite the lack of luxury, the scenery from the plane and the incredible beach landing made it the most incredible flight I've been on. It felt like a once-in-a-lifetime experience, and I'm so thankful that my travel plans changed last minute.\n\nRead next\n\nTravel\n\nAdvertisement"
