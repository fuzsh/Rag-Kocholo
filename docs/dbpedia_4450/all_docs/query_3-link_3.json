        "text": "If you are looking to drop someone off, and you only need 30 minutes or less, you can do so for free at the Short Stay Car Park. This is situated slightly further away from the terminal building, but there is a shuttle service to transport passengers. Also, as there is no cost, it is a service many travellers are happy to use. If you are not in a rush, and you would rather save money, the Short Stay Car Park at Stansted Airport is an excellent option.\n\nIf you need a slightly longer period of time, or you are looking to drop people off closer to the terminal building, you will have to pay for this privilege. The initial cost is £5 for ten minutes, which then rises the longer the car is in the area, with stays over 15 minutes being charged at £25.\n\nWhether you need parking for a few hours or a couple of weeks, you will find plenty of options at Stansted. As with most airports, there are short-stay, medium-stay and long-stay parking options. If you are able to book your stay in advance, you should be able to enjoy a discount on the cost of parking if you arrived with no warning!\n\nAs you would expect, there is an official car parking service at Stansted, and there are other companies offering discount parking, which is further away from the airport. All of these operators provide a shuttle service to the airport, but if you are pushed for time, these might not be the best option for your needs.\n\nYou should be able to plan ahead and find the balance between cost and convenience which is best for your needs."
