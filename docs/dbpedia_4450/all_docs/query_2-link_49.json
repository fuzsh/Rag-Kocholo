With its schedule governed by the ebb and flow of the tide, Barra is a breath of fresh air compared to other more conventional airports – and its spectacular scenery is second to none.\n\nWhen the airport is closed and the windsocks are down, members of the public are free to walk on the runways which revert to a public beach enjoyed by surfers, dog walkers and families.\n\nAn airport since 1974, passenger numbers at Barra are now over 14,000 per year with around 1,400 aircraft movements. Barra operates twice daily flights to and from Glasgow – providing a vital link for residents and visitors alike. It also welcomes around 60 private light aircraft flights a year.\n\nMore Tourist Information\n\nThe waters around the island provide the perfect playground for boat trips or sea kayaking. If history or heritage is your thing, then Kisimul Castle - Gaelic for ‘Castle Island’ - can be accessed by a five minute boat trip from Castle Bay."
