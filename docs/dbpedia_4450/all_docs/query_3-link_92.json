        "text": "The Stansted Express’ terminus is at Liverpool Street, which is located in the heart of the City of London, making it easy to change to a tube to get to your final location. However, due to the fact that there are not many hotels located near Liverpool Street, most passengers will have to get on the London Underground or take a bus to get to their final destination, which may take as long as the train ride from the airport itself. However, Liverpool Street has a ton of different connections via rail services or tube, and is accessible via the Central, Circle, Metropolitan and Hammersmith & City lines.\n\nWhen traveling from London to Stansted Airport, passengers can depart from Tottenham Hale, Liverpool Street, or Stratford. Trains run at 10 to 15-minute intervals. The first train from Liverpool Street to Stansted Airport departs at 3:40 a.m. Monday to Saturday and at 4:10 a.m. on Sunday.

Services normally run every 15 to 30 minutes, depending on which route you’re taking, and each coach boasts free WiFi, power sockets, toilets, air conditioning, and much more. Passengers are allowed two cases each weighing no more than 44 lbs, and each person is allowed to carry a small item of luggage on board with them as well.\n\nTo board the coach, all you need to do is show the driver your ticket (either electronic or printed versions), and all the buses at the airport line up in their own bays at the bus station outside the airport’s passenger terminal (when landing in Stansted, just follow the signs to the bus station after you come out of the customs area). The bus station also has its own waiting room so you can grab a seat, a snack, or a coffee as well.\n\nNational Express also offers a Flexible Fare add-on ticket option for £5 each way, which allows you to board any National Express coach up to 12 hours before or after your original departure time (which is ideal in case your flight is delayed).\n\nEasyBus also offers coach services between Victoria station and Stansted Airport, with services running every 15 minutes from 12:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. (from the Victoria Coach Station) and 12:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. (from Stansted Airport). Please note that the pick-up and drop-off locations are only at Victoria coach station, which is about a five-minute walk away from the Victoria train station on Buckingham Palace Road.\n\nThere is also a service between Baker Street and Stansted (which runs every 40 minutes), and between Stratford and Stansted (running every 30 minutes). There’s also a route which connects Liverpool Street to Stansted Airport running every 30 minutes, and the pick-up and drop-off location is located at 155 Bishopsgate, a short walk away from the Liverpool Street train station.\n\nTerravision provides several shuttle bus routes from Stansted Airport to London, including Victoria Coach Station, King's Cross (every 20 minutes), Liverpool Street Station (via Stratford, every 30 minutes), and Baker Street (every 30 minutes). They also offer direct services to Stratford City Bus Station, Marble Arch, and Paddington.\n\nHow to get to and from Stansted Airport by taxi\n\nHow long does it take?\n\nAround one hour (between Waterloo and Stansted Airport)\n\nHow much does it cost?\n\nAnywhere from £69 to over £100\n\nWhere are the pick-up points?\n\nWherever you want!\n\nThe Pros:\n\nMost convenient\n\nGet dropped off right at your hotel doorstep\n\nAssistance with luggage\n\nThe Cons\n\nThe most expensive option\n\nDelays due to traffic\n\nTakes longer than a train, and sometimes longer than a coach\n\nAnd last but certainly not least, if you’re looking for the most hassle-free method of transportation to get to and from Stansted Airport, then hiring a taxi is the way to go.\n\nThere are usually queues of London’s iconic black cabs outside Stansted Airport, so you can easily catch a taxi into London after you land in Stansted.\n\nYou can book a taxi beforehand, either by phone or online, and there is also a 24/7 reservation desk in the international arrivals area, as well as a courtesy phone in the UK and Ireland baggage reclaim hall. However, fares tend to be much cheaper if you book your taxi well in advance. If you do decide to book your taxi in advance, you can ask your driver to meet you in the airport by giving them your flight details and estimated time of arrival.\n\nIf you’re travelling in a larger group or with children, you can also ask for a minibus or coach taxi, and then split the cost with other members of your group to save some money. Also be aware that if you are travelling during peak hours (between 7:30 a.m. and 10:00 a.m., or between 5:00 p.m. and 7:00 p.m. on weekdays) your journey time may take quite a bit longer due to rush hour traffic.\n\nUber connects Standsted Airport and central London with an average price of approximately £78 for a standard UberX ride, though this can vary based on factors such as the time of day, traffic, and demand. Services like UberXL or Uber Black tend to be more expensive.\n\nIf you are coming to Stansted Airport, you might also want to join any of the free tours in London that are available on offer."
