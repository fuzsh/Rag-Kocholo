        "text": "Stansted Airport in Essex has announced three new flight routes to European holiday destinations with British Airways. The airline began its first flights to new areas of France, Italy and Spain over the weekend.\n\nThe routes now fly to Nice, Florence, and Ibiza, being operated by BA CityFlyer on Saturdays and Sundays using Embraer 190 aircraft with Club Europe and Euro Traveller cabins.\n\nThe airline also recently announced that it will launch a new route to Split in Croatia from September and continue its weekly Sunday charter between Stansted and Calvi this summer with Corsican Places. This will be the first time that British Airways has offered scheduled flights from Stansted since before the Covid pandemic, and it’s the fourth London airport to be served by the flag carrier.\n\nRead more: Essex library may give bodycams to staff after librarian assualted\n\nRead more: Essex council wants to crack down on people having sex, flashing and defecating in public\n\nThe first flight took to the skies on Sunday (May 19) to Florence at 7.40am, followed by the Nice departure at 8.35am and the lunchtime service to Ibiza at 3pm. Ciaran Brannigan, Stansted Airport's Commercial Director, said: \"London Stansted serves more European destinations than any other UK airport and these new services to Ibiza, Florence and Nice are strong additions.\n\n\"Our route network now covers over 200 destinations across Europe, North Africa and the Middle East. I’m sure these routes will be very popular with passengers from across London, Cambridge and the growing East of England region. We look forward to working closely with British Airways to build a strong working relationship and ensure these new flights are a success.\""
