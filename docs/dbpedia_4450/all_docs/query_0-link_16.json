        "text": "Storm Aviation has gone forward with plans to move its base maintenance operations in the UK from London Stansted Airport to Glasgow Prestwick Airport.\n\nIn a statement, the UK-based maintenance provider says the move to relocate its base maintenance to Scotland was driven by “resource allocation and operational efficiency.” Previously, it conducted its base maintenance operations at Stansted, where it continues to undertake other services including line maintenance and training functions.\n\nThe FL Technics subsidiary operates a widebody hangar at Prestwick, located around 30 mi. southwest of Glasgow. Storm Aviation obtained the hangar following the acquisition of Chevron Technical Services and its subsidiary Chevron Aircraft Maintenance in summer 2021, which previously occupied the Scotland facility. Chevron Aircraft Maintenance was rebranded and started operating under the Storm Aviation name earlier this year.\n\nStorm Aviation says it has invested in several areas of the Prestwick facility including new capabilities, the management structure of the facility and investments in staff and infrastructure. Aviation Week has asked Storm Aviation about the nature of these investments.\n\n“Focusing our base efforts at our Prestwick hangar is a strategic move to streamline our operations and improve efficiency,” says Kenny Chan, director of maintenance at Storm Aviation. Chan adds that by centralizing its base maintenance at Glasgow Prestwick, the MRO provider is aiming for better services while \"ensuring a sustainable business model.\"\n\nAt present, the Prestwick facility’s capabilities include engine changes on General Electric GEnx and Rolls-Royce Trent 1000s to C2 six-year base maintenance checks of Airbus A320, A321, Boeing 737 and 787 family aircraft. The facility operates on a 24-hr. schedule as a result of no flight curfew.\n\nThe airport's passenger traffic is comprised of Ryanair-operated flights, with the low-cost carrier also having a maintenance presence at the site."
