        "meta_description": "Scotland's airports are set to see a 3% decline in seat numbers in 2019, following a 0.7% drop in 2018, according to data from OAG Schedules Analyser. The decline follows a period of growth between 2014 and 2017, driven by low-cost carriers (LCCs). The reversal in growth is partly attributed to the Scottish government's decision to abandon a planned cut in air passenger duty. Loganair is the only airline among the leading carriers serving Scotland that is still growing this year.",

        "text": "According to data from OAG Schedules Analyser, total seat numbers from Scotland's airports will fall by 3.0% in 2019. This will be the second successive year of capacity decline, after a 0.7% drop in 2018.\n\nThis reversal in growth contrasts with an increase of 20.3% between 2014 and 2017. At least to some extent, airlines (especially LCCs) were tempted into growth in Scotland by the promise of a cut in air passenger duty by the Scottish government in 2015. The SNP-led government's recent change of mind would seem to be a contributory factor in the capacity reduction.\n\nAmong the leading airlines serving Scotland that are still growing this year, the one that is growing fastest is Loganair.\n\nStyling itself as Scotland's airline, it emerged from its previous life as a Flybe franchise operator to flying under its own brand in Sep-2017. Loganair took on a fleet of Embraer regional jets from its bankrupt former sister company flybmi in Feb-2019 to add to its turboprops."
