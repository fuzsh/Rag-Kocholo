        "text": "WestJet’s plans to add Toronto and Halifax to its existing Calgary route have been labelled “incredibly exciting” by bosses at Edinburgh airport.\n\nIt will be the first time Edinburgh and Halifax, in Nova Scotia, have been directly linked.\n\nThe flights are scheduled to take off from Canada every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday between June 20 and September 3.\n\nThe Edinburgh to Halifax flights will go on Wednesday, Friday, and Sunday between the same dates.\n\nFlights to Toronto, Ontario, will be more regular, running in both directions every day from May 14 to October 13.\n\nWestJet currently operates flights to Calgary from Edinburgh on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday from between May 13 to October 26.\n\nGordon Dewar (above), the chief executive of Edinburgh Airport said: “WestJet’s decision to make Edinburgh Airport its home in Scotland is incredibly exciting, especially as they grow their presence in Scotland’s capital, and we look forward to working with them to make these routes a success.\n\n“The three cities offer vastly different things and it’s that rich history, the mix of cultures and stunning scenery that makes Canada one of the most exciting destinations anywhere in the world.\n\n“By offering three Canadian destinations from Edinburgh, we will now be able to offer passengers our biggest ever North American programme for summer 2024 and we are confident people will grasp that opportunity to experience Canada and the USA.\n\n“The growth in transatlantic travel from Edinburgh shows the clear appetite there is for people from Scotland to travel there as well as that ongoing desire for people in North America to come to Scotland. We have a fantastic offering and should continue to do all we can to make it a success.”\n\nDaniel Fajardo, the vice-president of network and schedule planning with WestJet, said: “WestJet is proud to grow upon our valued partnership with Edinburgh International Airport.\n\n“This summer, WestJet will offer non-stop service to Edinburgh from Calgary, Toronto and Halifax and we are confident this enhanced connectivity between Edinburgh and three major Canadian hubs will further strengthen the two-way business and tourism pipeline between Canada and Scotland.”"
