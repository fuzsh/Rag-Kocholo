Maybe you’ll enjoy some traditional bagpipe music while eating?\n\nGet a feeling for the Scottish history at Stirling bridge in the Scottish Highlands. Sterling bridge is the place where William Wallace, Braveheart, lead the Scotts to defeat the English army in the first war for Scottish Independence in 1297.\n\nTake the train across the UNESCO World Heritage site Forth bridge from Edinburgh to Fife. It stretches over 2,5 kilometers and the towers are over 100 meters high."
