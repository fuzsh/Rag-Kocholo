        "text": "Loganair (LM, Glasgow International) has detailed its plans for its recently secured London Heathrow slots and will relocate its current flights to London Stansted and London City (except for the Isle of Man route) to the main gateway airport.\n\nThe Scottish regional carrier said its current E145 services from Londonderry City of Derry to London Stansted and ATR42-500 flights from Dundee to London City will move to Heathrow's Terminal 2 starting on May 6, 2023.\n\n\"The move to Heathrow truly is a game changer for UK regional air services. Alongside excellent ground transport links into central London, the new range of global flight connections will bring new inward investment opportunities and tourism into the UK's regions, together with enabling travellers to use their local airport to fly worldwide for the first time,\" Chief Executive Jonathan Hinkles said.\n\nBoth routes will continue to be operated with the same aircraft types as present and by crews based out of the City of Derry and Dundee. They will be the first Heathrow routes from either city.\n\nThe relocation of the Dundee route will also affect same-aircraft connecting services from Kirkwall and Sumburgh. Currently, the only route operated by Loganair from Heathrow is to Isle of Man (which is and will remain also served from London City)."
