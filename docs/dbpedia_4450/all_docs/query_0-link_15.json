        "text": "London Stansted Airport (STN IATA) is London's third airport. Despite bearing London's name, it is actually in Essex, about 30 mi (48 km) north of the capital. There are coaches and direct express trains into The City and Victoria Coach Station in London all day and overnight. The airport is also close to Cambridge, which is about 25 mi (40 km) away, and Colchester, which lies around 30 mi (48 km) to the east.\n\nStansted is the fourth-busiest airport in the country, after London Heathrow, London Gatwick and Manchester. It is a Ryanair hub.\n\nMost Stansted flights are from European destinations, including 25 or more destinations in France, 20 or more destinations in Spain, 10 or more in Greece and 10 or more in Germany, depending on the time of year. There are also flights from North Africa and the Middle East, and within the United Kingdom from Newquay in Cornwall, Belfast in Northern Ireland, and Edinburgh in Scotland. A full list of destinations is on the Stansted Airport website.\n\nThe airport is owned by MAG, Manchester Airport Group, who also own East Midlands and Manchester airports.\n\nUnderstand\n\n[edit]\n\nStansted is excellent for direct low-cost flights across Europe, especially away from the capitals. For example, from Rome to London, there's plenty of choice, but from Bari, Palermo or Turin it would otherwise be difficult to get here without paying three times as much and taking three times longer.\n\nStansted is okay for travel to central London. It's further out and pricier to reach than Heathrow or Gatwick, see transport options below. Nevertheless, there are frequent buses and trains south to London, and north to Cambridge, Norwich and the Midlands.\n\nStansted is poor for:\n\nflights beyond Europe – though Morocco and Dubai are served.\n\ntransfers to other airports – allow at least two hours to reach Heathrow or Gatwick, on top of the normal two-hour check-in & security time.\n\ncurrency exchange (bureau de change) – as there are few options in the terminal and these are often very expensive.\n\nFlights\n\n[edit]\n\nStansted is dominated by the low-cost airline Ryanair which has a large base at the airport while EasyJet has significantly diminished its Stansted operations in favour of Luton and Gatwick. Holiday charter airlines TUI and Jet2.com also operate at the airport on a large scale. A few other scheduled carriers fly to European destinations from Stansted and there are a small number of intercontinental flights, notably Emirates to Dubai.\n\nFlights are normally from 6AM to 11PM; the airport terminal remains open 24/7 but most facilities close overnight. Delayed passengers arriving during the small hours had better assume everything landside will be closed, so use the toilets in the baggage reclaim hall before emerging onto a draughty sidewalk. See the transport section below for the first & last buses and trains.\n\nGround transportation\n\n[edit]\n\nStansted Airport is a fair way from London and other nearby cities, so travel times may vary, particularly at peak times. You don't necessarily need to pre-book your transport, with plenty of turn-up-and-go travel options, but \"advance\" tickets can come with a discount. It is always worth checking journey planners a few hours before your flight.\n\nBy train\n\n[edit]\n\nBy train is usually the quickest way to travel to Stansted, particularly from London. Stansted Airport railway station is (almost) beneath the terminal building. The walk between trains and the terminal building usually takes less than 5 minutes.\n\nThe station has step-free access. London Oyster cards and contactless bank cards cannot be used to travel between London and Stansted. You can buy tickets and e-tickets at stations or online.

For Ryanair this is a hub and they can stand-up aircraft and crews if they see that a delay is going to embroil them in grief and compensation. Your departure posted as 3 hours late may suddenly go to a boarding call. You can probably only risk leaving the airport for a general shut-down, or an incoming turnaround by some other airline that hasn't even left Malta yet.
