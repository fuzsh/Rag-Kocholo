        "text": "Armed police have surrounded a Kenyan Airways flight at London Stansted airport after a security alert.\n\nThe Boeing 787 from Nairobi was due to arrive at Heathrow this afternoon but was diverted to Stansted in Essex 45 minutes before its expected arrival.\n\nArmed police and fire crews were seen around the plane but the airport continued to otherwise operate as normal.\n\nA London Stansted spokesperson said the Boeing 787 “landed safely with Essex police in attendance”. The flight was diverted at 3.45pm.\n\n“The aircraft was escorted to a remote parking stand with normal flight operations now continuing,” the spokesperson said.\n\nOne woman posted on Facebook: “On flight this morning from Nairobi to London Heathrow. Forty-five minutes before we were due to land, we were told that we’d been diverted to Stansted. When we arrived in Stansted, loads of police cars.\n\n“We’ve been surrounded by all the police. They’ve all got guns all dressed in black and are ID-ing us. Captain hasn’t even said anything.”\n\nThe flight was intercepted by RAF fighter jets from its quick response alert force. It is believed an alert was raised while flying over French airspace.\n\nAn Essex police spokesperson said: “We are currently attending an incident at Stansted airport. A flight travelling from Nairobi to Heathrow was diverted to Stansted this afternoon. The airport remains open.”\n\nAn Essex county fire and rescue spokesperson said: “Eight crews are in attendance at Stansted airport. We are working with Essex police and the airport to bring the incident to a successful conclusion.”\n\nA Ministry of Defence spokesperson said: “RAF Typhoon fighter aircraft from RAF Coningsby were launched as a precaution this afternoon to investigate a civilian aircraft which was approaching the UK.\n\n“The civilian aircraft remained in contact with air traffic controllers throughout, and was escorted to Stansted airport where it landed safely. This incident is now under the control of the civilian authorities.”\n\nIn a statement, Kenya Airways said: “Headquarters received an alert of a potential security threat on board KQ100 operating from Nairobi to London Heathrow.\n\n“KQ management in conjunction with the security authorities of the government of Kenya and the United Kingdom carried out a thorough risk assessment of the threat.\n\n“The crew onboard were briefed, and all safety and security precautions were taken to ensure the safety and security of our crew and passengers on board.\n\n“The aircraft landed safely at Stansted airport, London, for security clearance by UK government security personnel.”"
