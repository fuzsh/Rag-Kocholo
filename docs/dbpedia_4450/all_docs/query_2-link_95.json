        "text": "Thousands of Scots are seeing their travel plans disrupted as air traffic control chaos continues for another day.\n\nMany flights have been delayed or cancelled due to the air traffic control failure. Despite the issue now being resolved, National Air Traffic Services (Nats), which controls UK airspace, has applied “traffic flow restrictions\", meaning that airlines have been forced to cancel flights, with others facing major delays.\n\nThe restrictions mean that fewer flights are allowed in the skies, impacting people jetting off or due to fly back to Scotland - as well as other airports across the UK- today. To keep you in the know about the situation, the Daily Record has explained some of the main concerns you may face if due to head on holiday today.\n\nWhat is the issue with air traffic control?\n\nOn Monday, August 28, a technical fault impacted air traffic control's flight planning system which is used to manage UK airspace. The issue resulted in travel restrictions.\n\nWhile the UK airspace was not completely shut down, there were huge limits placed on flights for safety reasons. This affected flights both travelling to and from the UK, as well as those travelling to other destinations over the UK airspace.\n\nThe issue has now been resolved, however, the backlog of flights has resulted in long delays and even cancellations into today - Tuesday, August 29.\n\nA statement from Nats said: “We have identified and remedied the technical issue affecting our flight planning system this morning. We are now working closely with airlines and airports to manage the flights affected as efficiently as possible. Our engineers will be carefully monitoring the system’s performance as we return to normal operations.”\n\nIt added: “The flight planning issue affected the system’s ability to automatically process flight plans, meaning that flight plans had to be processed manually which cannot be done at the same volume, hence the requirement for traffic flow restrictions. Our priority is always to ensure that every flight in the UK remains safe and we are sincerely sorry for the disruption this is causing. Please contact your airline for information on how this may affect your flight.”\n\nWhich flights are being impacted today?\n\nThe disruption is UK wide, with flights to and from the four nations experiencing signification delays as well as some cancellations.\n\nMajor airlines have issued statements to warn customers due to travel, with British Airways explaining passengers should expect “significant changes”, urging everyone to check the status of their flight before heading to the airport.\n\nThe airline said: “Like all airlines using UK airspace, our flights have been severely disrupted as a result of a major issue experienced by Nats Air Traffic Control earlier today. While Nats has now resolved the issue, it has created significant and unavoidable delays and cancellations. We’re working as hard as possible to get customers whose flights have been affected on their way again and have apologised for the huge inconvenience caused.”\n\nEasyjet also issued advice to customers on board delayed aircrafts, at the airports, as well as those set to travel later today. The airline explained that those who are currently on a flight will be updated by crew, with those at the airport urged to check flight information screens around the terminal as well as keeping up to day via the easyJet app.\n\nThose due to travel later today should continue their plans as normal with updates being issued via email on text message if any changes should be made to bookings.\n\nRyanair said: “Due to another UK ATC failure, Ryanair will be forced to delay/cancel a number of flights to/from the UK today, Monday, 28 August. All affected passengers will be notified of their options to change flights (free of charge) to another Ryanair flight or receive a full refund.”\n\nTui also warned customers that significant delays are likely.\n\nSome regional flights are still operating however. Loganair said: “Although we are hopeful of being able to operate most intra-Scotland flights on the basis of local co-ordination and with a minimum of disruption, north-south and international flights may be subject to delays. If you are flying with us today, please check our website for the latest information about your flight before setting off for the airport.”\n\nWhat should I do if I’m travelling today?\n\nIf you are due to fly today, it is important to make sure your airline has your correct contact details in order to receive updates on your flight status before heading to the airport.\n\nThe airline should provide updates whether there is a delay or cancellation. You should download the your airline's app as there will likely be updates issued through this too.\n\nIn some cases, you may be asked to hold back and wait before heading to the airport. If you are already at the airport, updates on your flight status should be given at the terminal.\n\nWhat are my rights if my flight is delayed or cancelled?\n\nCustomers are granted compensation by airlines if a flight is delayed or cancelled at its fault. However, this may not apply disruption has been caused by the airport or factors such as air traffic control issues.\n\nThe UK Civil Authority Agency states that airlines are required by UK law to provide compensation if a flight arrives to its destination more than three hours late - but only in certain situations.\n\nThe air traffic control issues are classed as \"extraordinary circumstances\", meaning you may not be eligible for compensation. However, you should contact your airline for more information as some passengers alternative flights options or even a full refund to passengers impacted.\n\nAside from compensation, airlines are required under UK law to offer care and assistance for passengers with significantly delayed, regardless of what has caused it.\n\nYou can get more information on your rights in our article here."
