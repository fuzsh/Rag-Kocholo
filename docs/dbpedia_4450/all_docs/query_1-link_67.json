        "text": "Best Time to Fly to Scotland\n\nPeak season:\n\nThe best time to see Scotland is during the summer months. The country is crowded and Scotland flights and accommodations should be booked in advance, but the festivals and the celebrations are worth attending.\n\nSpring can be a beautiful time of year to visit. The weather can be mild and the countryside is starting to turn green again. City breaks in Edinburgh and Glasgow are very popular and in more remote parts of Scotland the golden and red leaves can set the countryside ablaze.\n\nOff season:\n\nThe winter months can be wet, cold and dark and they get most of the snow that falls on the UK too. However, this is when legendary and world-famous Hogmanay takes place. If you can manage the cold, find a cheap flight to Scotland and take part in the New Year’s celebration.\n\nOverview\n\nScotland is a land of legends. From mountain-top castles to kings in kilts, the picturesque country never fails to romance visitors. Rolling hills, fields of wildflowers, bagpipes and festivals are year-round fixtures, and stories of the Loch Ness Monster and Braveheart are recounted on Scotland flights and immortalized in the country’s history. Along with England, Northern Ireland and Wales, Scotland makes up the United Kingdom but its people remain independent. The Scottish parliament was formed in 1999, creating a new set of laws specific to Scotland and free from London’s reign.\n\nThe Scots are passionate people who remain steadfast to their country’s culture and steep traditions. The whiskey flows fast during the popular summer festivals, when many travelers book flights to Scotland to take part in the highland games or head to Edinburgh for cultural celebrations.\n\nScotland climate\n\nScotland is surrounded by water on three sides and is often buffeted about by stormy weather. As a general rule, the east coast is cool and dry and the west coast milder and wetter. The weather varies, even in a day, but in general July and August are the warmest months (up to 70 degrees Fahrenheit) and therefore peak season. May and June are nice too; weather is dry.\n\nGetting around Scotland\n\nPublic transportation in the central belt (Glasgow across to Edinburgh) is reliable and efficient, but getting around the more remote areas of the Highlands and Islands, it can take a lot of forward planning. Most train services are operated by FirstScotRail. Coach services are popular and reasonably priced. Rental car is an option. All the major car rental companies have branches here.\n\nBy boat: about 50 islands have ferry links. You can take a car on some of them. Book in advance however and be prepared for the weather to interrupt your journey.\n\nScotland has four main airports – Edinburgh, Aberdeen, Glasgow and Glasgow Prestwick – and other smaller airfields around the country which are linked up by carriers such as British Airways, Loganair, Highland Airways and Eastern Airways."
