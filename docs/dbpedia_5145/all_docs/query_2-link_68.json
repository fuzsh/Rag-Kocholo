        "text": "Adviser: Susan L. Woodward This project seeks to answer the following questions: Why did the 2011 Syrian Revolution transition into a civil war? What contributed to the popularity of rebel efforts in the countryside? This case study on the Syrian Civil War begins by characterizing key events in the current civil war setting in order to characterize the nature of participation on the insurgent side of the conflict. Further, this project sets out to identify key events and actors in their respective geographic and demographic frameworks in order to identify the nature of participants and their respective characteristics. I will ultimately draw a connecting line between the nature and degree of insurgent participation by speculating on grievances. The latter process is identified as originating in the re-arrangement of the domestic economy. In other words, I argue that the local origins of the insurgency are a product of the breakdown in the dynamics between group actors and their respective economic institutions. The last discussion will allow the author to offer insight into the relationship between macro-level determinants of civil war and the micro-foundations of identification with and/or participation among insurgent efforts. The nature and origins of political grievances will be discussed at the end of this project.\n\nIdentified as a world threat, ISIS has managed to unite most international warring parties in Syria against it. An anti-ISIS international coalition continues to launch airstrikes in Syria and Iraq. Ironically, this coalition includes nations that have contributed to the expansion of ISIS. These served to either facilitate the travel of Jihadists to Syria, to train, arm and/or fund them. Nonetheless, beyond international forces, ISIS also owes its expansion to local circumstances and dynamics. Yet again, focus on this local aspect to deal with ISIS seems to remain limited. This article highlights the governance mechanisms of ISIS at the local level in Syria. Particular attention is paid to the dynamics between ISIS and local civil society in Al-Raqqa and Dair Ezzor. Al-Raqqa is the base of ISIS in Syria while Dair Ezzor is one of its most contested areas. It is noted that while the Syrian regime and international interests have prompted its support system there, ISIS seems to have furthered its governance through three major factors: effectiveness, security and legitimacy. These have helped it govern beyond what its coercion, ideology and unsustainable resources would have permitted. Meanwhile, local civil society governance systems remain weak, fragmented and much challenged in Syria. As a result, it is foreseen that unless another alternative is created, there will remain low incentives for the locals to risk non-compliance or resistance to ISIS. Thus, the success of any anti-ISIS plan is doomed to fail should it not tackle local governance dynamics.\n\nIn November 2015, the United States and the Russian Federation convened the main international stakeholders engaged in the Syrian conflict to broker the Vienna Accords. The unfolding political process culminated in the issuing of UN Security Council Resolution 2254. Since then the situation has evolved rapidly, ushering in a new outlook for the resolution of the six-year-old civil war. The conflicting parties in Syria have not yet fathomed the momentum of this deal. Some progress has been made as part of successive attempts to establish a “cessation of hostilities,” but there have not yet been any major breakthroughs because the negotiating parties, supported by regional allies, are resisting the process every step of the way. The war has created new geographic realities: governance structures, political economies, and cultural paradigms. These geographies will not be easily bypassed. Dealing with the fragmented situation will hinder the prospects of a top-down solution, particularly because none of the negotiating parties has full control over its constituency. This article focuses on understanding this new geography. Arguing that the emergence of radicalized actors on the scene is not an accidental feature of the conflict dynamics, it shows how, instead, the territorial patterns of control by the different actors have used and exploited the territory to advance their positioning. Subsequently the article argues that these patterns, intended or not, have fostered the radicalization of the armed actors on all sides, imposing in the meantime asymmetrical patterns of territoriality that will seriously undermine the top-down approach of the Geneva process.\n\nIn 2011, hundreds of thousands of Syrians marched peacefully to demand democratic reforms. Within months, repression forced them to take arms and set up their own institutions. Two years later, the inclusive nature of the opposition had collapsed, and the PKK and radical jihadist groups rose to prominence. In just a few years, Syria turned into a full-scale civil war involving major regional and world powers. How has the war affected Syrian society? How does the frag- mentation of Syria transform social and sectarian hierarchies? How does the war economy work in a country divided between the regime, the insurgency, the PKK, and the Islamic State? Written by authors who have previously worked on the Iraqi, Afghan, Kurd, Libyan, and Congolese armed conflicts, this book includes extensive interviews and direct observations. This is a unique book, which combines rare field experience of the Syrian conflict with new theoretical insights on the dynamics of civil wars.\n\nIn November 2015, the United States and the Russian Federation convened the main international stakeholders engaged in the Syrian conflict to broker the Vienna Accords.

Amid the chaos, the radical Sunni Islamist groups Ahrar al-Sham, Jabhat al-Nusra, and the Islamic State became the most prominent in the conflict. This thesis explores why and how the groups emerged in Syria, rose to power, and proliferated to unprecedented levels by tracing the progression of the Syrian conflict through three cycles of contestation: protest, insurgency, and civil war. Combining elements from social movement, insurgency, and radicalization theories as well as civil war literature, this thesis dissects the radical Islamist ideology, the institutional legacies from prior struggles, and the role of external sponsors and places each in the context of the Syrian conflict. History has proven that the radical Islamists fighting in Syria today are the next generation of leaders in the global jihad movement. Understanding their rise to power provides crucial insight to our future enemies. This thesis seeks to go beyond a recitation of facts and links multiple frameworks with the rise of the most powerful radical Islamist groups in the Syrian conflict.\n\nThe Syrian Revolution hasn’t achieved its goals of democratization. Why is that? Based on a three-forged theoretical framework (Ibn Khaldun’s Asabiyya, Stathis Kalyvas’ master vs. local cleavages, and Paul Stanialand's prewar social networks), the thesis argues this resulted from rebel fragmentation, which in turn was a mere reflection of the fragmented social structure of the Syrian local communities. Due to geopolitical, historical, and socioeconomic factors, there existed “a plethora of communities” rather than a Syrian society. When the Revolution erupted, this social structure led to the “most fragmented conflict in history”. This led to “two revolutions”, on two levels of fragmentation: macro, between politicized and socialized revolutions, and micro in which the local community structures manifested in the VNSAs. Studying al-Hajar al-Aswad district on the micro-level supported this view and showed that the local community structure, rather than ideology or foreign support, is the main dynamic of the Revolution."
