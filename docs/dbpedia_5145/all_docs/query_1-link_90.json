This extraordinary data set derives from 680 Syria-related entities or domain names, including those of the Ministries of Presidential Affairs, Foreign Affairs, Finance, Information, Transport and Culture. At this time Syria is undergoing a violent internal conflict that has killed between 6,000 and 15,000 people in the last 18 months.

I started\n\ntalking about [visa-free travel] between Turkey and Syria three years\n\nago,â€ Syrian President Bashar al-Assad said Sunday in an interview\n\nwith daily HÃ¼rriyet and the German paper Bild that touched on regional\n\ninfluence, Middle East peace and his countryâ€™s reputation.\n\nâ€œWhen Erdo?an said, â€˜We are readyâ€™ [for a visa agreement] during\n\nmy visit to Turkey last year, I was very surprised,â€ al-Assad said.\n\nAsked about claims in U.S. diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks that\n\nhe said Iran holds a more crucial position than Turkey, al-Assad denied\n\nthe allegations and asked whether anyone would believe he said Syria\n\nranks last among the three countries. â€œI allegedly said Iran ranks\n\nfirst, Turkey ranks second and Syria ranks third,â€ the president said\n\nwith a smile. â€œCould you believe that I would make such a ranking?\n\nUnless I say Syria is the most crucial country in the region, such a\n\nclaim is not correct.â€\n\nPressed further on the topic, al-Assad said he thinks Syria, Iran and\n\nTurkey all hold significant positions, even though other perspectives\n\nare sometimes stated or written by U.S. people.\n\nâ€œIf you have a good image, yet live in a bad reality, this is, in\n\nfact, a bad situation. If you have a bad image, yet live in a good\n\nreality, this is positive,â€ he said. â€œThe most ideal is to have an\n\nimage based on reality. The West will learn the realities in the region\n\nin time.â€\n\nThe leader of Syria for 10 years, al-Assad said the countryâ€™s image\n\nhad already been changed somewhat since the presidency of his father,\n\nHafez al-Assad, but added that it would be even better if it were\n\nchanged further. Agreeing with a statement by one interviewer that\n\nduring his fatherâ€™s time, soldiers, police and intelligence operatives\n\ncreated an image of dictatorship, but that Syria took on a more liberal\n\nimage under his own presidency, al-Assad said he does not care whether\n\nother people like him or not.\n\nRegarding the concept of an â€œOttoman Nations Gatheringâ€ proposed by\n\nTurkish Foreign Affairs Minister Ahmet Davuto?lu, the Syrian leader said\n\nhe could not evaluate what is meant by this phrase. He added that the\n\nquestion of how Turkish people define the difference between\n\nâ€œOttomanâ€ and â€œTurkeyâ€ should be considered, and that it does\n\nnot sound good if someone tells him that he comes from the Turkish\n\nnation. â€œIs this related to boundaries? I guess he [Davuto?lu] is not\n\ntalking about the spread of Turkey,â€ al-Assad said.\n\nThe Syrian president said peace had not yet been able to come to the\n\nregion because of conquerors and that even though local people live\n\nunder very bad conditions, they managed to live in peace for many years\n\nwithin a social structure. â€œThe civil war was not experienced here,\n\nbut in Lebanon. The reason for all wars is conquerors. First the\n\nBritish, then the French and now Israel,â€ Al-Assad said, when asked\n\nfor his comments on Middle East peace.\n\nAccording to the Syrian president, peace will only come to the region if\n\nIsrael applies all United Nations Security Council decisions and returns\n\nthe land it conquered. When asked to compare Syriaâ€™s position with\n\nthat of Iran, which does not accept the existence of Israel, al-Assad\n\nsaid Iran and Syria do not have different attitudes about peace in the\n\nregion.\n\nâ€œMaybe we might have different perspectives on details, but if we\n\nthink about the news headlines that will be utilized, there is no\n\ndisagreement between Iran and Syria on this issue,â€ he said.\n\nHYPERLINK \\l \"_top\" HOME PAGE\n\nObama has created more 'despair' in the Middle-East, says Syrian\n\nPresident\n\nBarack Obama's lack of progress in delivering on his historic 2009 Cairo\n\naddress has led to more despair in the Middle East, according to Bashar\n\nal-Assad, the Syrian president.\n\nDaily Telegraph,\n\n20 Dec. 2010,\n\n\"In his speech in Cairo, he sparked great hopes of peace in this\n\nregion,\" Assad told the mass circulation Bild daily in an interview\n\nconducted in Damascus. \"But when you raise hopes without producing\n\nresults, the opposite is the effect â€“ it just leads to more despair.\"\n\nIn a landmark June, 2009, speech at Cairo University, aimed at the\n\nworld's 1.5 billion Muslims, Mr Obama had vowed to forge a \"new\n\nbeginning\" for Islam and America and promised to purge years of\n\n\"suspicion and discord.\"\n\nHe also laid out a new blueprint for US Middle East policy, pledging to\n\nend mistrust, create a state for Palestinians and defuse a nuclear\n\nshowdown with Iran.\n\nMr Assad said the US President seemed \"honest in his intentions so far,\n\nbut we are looking for results, not for intentions.\"\n\nEarlier this month, the Obama administration admitted defeat in its\n\nefforts to secure an Israeli freeze on settlement building, effectively\n\nsignalling the end of direct peace negotiations between Israel and the\n\nPalestinians.\n\nThe 27-nation European Union is part of the Quartet of international\n\nmediators in the Middle East â€“ with the United States, the United\n\nNations and Russia â€“ but Assad said the bloc carried little weight.\n\n\"So far only French President (Nicolas) Sarkozy has made any effort in\n\nthe peace process,\" he said.\n\nHYPERLINK \\l \"_top\" HOME PAGE\n\nWikiLeaks cables: Syria believed Israel was behind sniper killing\n\nAssassination of Syrian president's top security aide caused anxiety\n\namong the political elite, US embassy cables reve\n\nIan Black, Middle East editor,\n\nGuardian,\n\n20 Dec. 2010,\n\nIt was late in the evening of 1 August 2008 in the Syrian coastal city\n\nof Tartous when the sniper fired the fatal shot. The target was General\n\nMuhammad Suleiman, President Bashar al-Assad's top security aide.\n\nIsraelis, the US embassy in Damascus reported, were \"the most obvious\n\nsuspects\" in the assassination.\n\nUS state department cables released by WikiLeaks trace the panicked\n\nresponse of the authorities. \"Syrian security services quickly cordoned\n\nand searched the entire beach neighbourhood where the shooting had\n\noccurred,\" the embassy was informed. Syrian-based journalists were\n\ninstructed not to report the story. It was a sensational event, akin to\n\nanother mysterious assassination in Damascus earlier that year, when a\n\ncar bomb killed Imad Mughniyeh, military chief of Hezbollah.\n\nInitial reports were vague about Suleiman's identity and position, and\n\nthe news blackout lasted for four days. But the US government knew\n\nexactly who he was. A secret document several months earlier gave his\n\nprecise job description: \"Syrian special presidential adviser for arms\n\nprocurement and strategic weapons.\"\n\nEleven months earlier, Israeli planes had attacked and destroyed a\n\nsuspected nuclear site at al-Kibar on the Euphrates river, apparently\n\none of the special projects Suleiman managed \"which may have have been\n\nunknown to the broader Syrian military leadership\", as the embassy put\n\nit. Israeli media reported that he had also served as Assad's liaison to\n\nHezbollah.\n\nIsrael was the obvious suspect in Suleiman's murder, US officials\n\nreported. \"Syrian security services are well aware that the coastal city\n\nof Tartous would offer easier access to Israeli operatives than would\n\nmore inland locations such as Damascus. Suleiman was not a highly\n\nvisible government official, and the use of a sniper suggests the\n\nassassin could visually identify Suleiman from a distance.\"\n\nIn the capital, the government remained silent, probably, the embassy\n\nspeculated, because \"(1) they may not know who did it; (2) such\n\naccusations could impair or end Syria's nascent peace negotiations with\n\nIsrael; and (3) publicising the event would reveal yet another lapse in\n\nSyria's vaunted security apparatus.\"\n\nReports about internal discussions suggest that the Tartous killing\n\nstrengthened the hands of Syrian security officials who were opposed to\n\npeace talks with Israel.\n\nTen days later a US embassy contact reported that the assassination had\n\nbecome \"a frequent source of controversy\" in internal Syrian government\n\ndeliberations. \"Tempers flared during an August 12 higher policy council\n\nmeeting when high-level security service officials openly questioned the\n\ngovernment's continuation of indirect negotiations with Israel and its\n\n'generosity' with Lebanon.\" Security chiefs claimed that Syria would\n\nmake concessions and not receive any tangible gains from engaging\n\nLebanon or talking indirectly to Israel.\n\n\"Underlying this tense exchange was frustration within the security\n\nservices that the [Syrian government] was all but ignoring the\n\nassassination of Suleiman. Security service officials were suggesting\n\nthat 'if the Israelis did it' [killed Suleiman], why was the Syrian\n\ngovernment continuing the dialogue?\" the embassy source added. \"'And if\n\nit was an inside job, people are wondering about their future.'\"\n\nAssad was thus under increasing pressure to provide assurances to his\n\nsecurity chiefs about their positions and about the government's\n\nintention not to make premature concessions.\n\nEmbassy cables also show that the US had previously wanted to apply\n\nfinancial sanctions to Suleiman as part of an effort to weaken the Assad\n\nregime, but found it difficult to do so because the information about\n\nhim was so highly classified it could not be made public.\n\n\"Muhammad Suleiman is a relatively low-payoff target,\" diplomats\n\nreported back to Washington. \"His activities are not widely known, which\n\nwill make it difficult to obtain unclassified information for a public\n\nstatement and, likewise, make it unlikely that his designation would\n\nresonate inside Syria.\"\n\nHYPERLINK \\l \"_top\" HOME PAGE\n\nUS embassy cables: Lebanese leader heals rift in Damascus visit\n\nGuardian,\n\n20 Dec. 2010,\n\nThursday, 14 August 2008, 16:06\n\nS E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 DAMASCUS 000579\n\nSIPDIS\n\nDEPARTMENT FOR NEA/ELA\n\nNSC FOR ABRAMS/SINGH\n\nEO 12958 DECL: 08/13/2028\n\nTAGS PGOV, PREL, SY, LE\n\nSUBJECT: SLEIMAN VISIT TO DAMASCUS: AGREEMENT ON\n\nDIPLOMATIC RELATIONS, LOTS OF WORK AHEAD\n\nREF: A.

At an August 14 mid-day\n\npress conference, FM Salloukh and FM Muallim explained that they and\n\ntheir ministerial counterparts would meet soon to implement this\n\ndecision through a long list of bilateral committees. Beneath the calm\n\nsurface, internal debate reportedly intensified among Syrian\n\npolicymakers over the SARG's foreign policy course and the future of key\n\nsecurity service officials. End Summary\n\nWarm Atmospherics, Visit Goes as Planned\n\n2. (SBU) Pre-visit Syrian editorials and statements waxed eloquently\n\nabout the special nature of Lebanese-Syrian relations and predicted\n\nsuccess in the opening a new chapter between the two countries. A\n\nPresidential Palace source spun the visit as a victory in preventing\n\nefforts to drive a wedge between Lebanon and Syria. Damascenes awoke to\n\nfind a two-mile stretch of the Beirut-Damascus highway decorated with\n\nSyrian and Lebanese flags, placed side-by-side atop median street\n\nlights. FM Muallim told the press that Bashar had instructed all Syrian\n\nofficials to make the visit \"successful and fruitful,\" adding \"it is up\n\nto both parties to decide whether they want to reopen wounds or heal\n\nthem.\" VP Sharaa, adding his deft touch to the pre-visit build-up, said\n\nSyria was interested in good relations with Lebanon and welcomed \"any\n\nLebanese official,\" including PM Siniora. On the issue of prisoners\n\n(\"the issue of the missing\"), Sharaa called for a \"solution that\n\nreassures both parties; hence, the Lebanese do not complain about having\n\nany detainees in Syrian prisons, and vice versa.\" The closure of this\n\nfile, Sharaa added, would mark the \"real entry\" into new bilateral\n\nrelations.\n\n3. (C) D/FM Miqdad's Chief of Staff told us during a August 13 courtesy\n\ncall with incoming and outgoing Charge that there had been concern\n\nregarding the possibility of a postponement in the wake of the early\n\nmorning bus bombing in Tripoli that killed Lebanese civilians and\n\nsoldiers. The SARG quickly issued a condemnation of the attack, and the\n\njoint presidential statement reiterated this sentiment. FM Muallim and\n\nSalloukh issued new condemnations in their joint press conference today.\n\n4. (SBU) In their August 13 joint statement, Sleiman and Asad agreed on\n\n\"establishing diplomatic relations between the Syrian Arab Republic and\n\nthe Lebanese Republic at the ambassadorial level,\" in accordance with\n\nthe UN Charter and international law. It added, \"The foreign ministers\n\nof the two countries have been tasked, beginning this day, to take the\n\nnecessary measures in accordance with legislative and legal regulations\n\nin the two countries.\" The text states that border issues and \"missing\n\npeople from both countries\" were also discussed.\n\n5. (C) According to XXXXXXXXXXXX the two Presidents discussed a wide\n\nrange of issues for further action, including prisoner releases, border\n\ndemarcation, and the broad array of economic, political, cultural and\n\nother agreements implemented by the Syrian-Lebanese Higher Council (Ref\n\nA). Asad and Sleiman reportedly agreed in principle that Asad would\n\nvisit Beirut at some date in the future. The two leaders are trying to\n\nbuild confidence on a basic level by exchanging embassies and\n\nambassadors, but both sides realize the need for political consensus\n\nwithin each country to move forward, XXXXXXXXXXXX reported. Having only\n\nrecently arrived at a Council of Ministers declaration and a vote of\n\nconfidence by the Parliament, the Lebanese government needed more time\n\nto discuss how to approach the relationship. Having the foreign\n\nministers continue discussions was the logical step, he suggested.\n\nDAMASCUS 00000579 002 OF 002\n\n6. (SBU) In addition to the joint Presidential statement, FM Salloukh\n\nand Muallim spoke at a joint press conference about the creation of\n\nseveral working committees to implement the establishment of diplomatic\n\nrelations. Asked about Secretary Rice's positive characterization of the\n\nresumption of diplomatic relations between Syria and Lebanon, Muallim\n\nreplied, \"This issue was merely a result of bilateral will. If others\n\nfind it positive, we welcome this.\" Follow up actions announced by the\n\nFMs include:\n\n-- a commitment by both sides to reactivate joint committees on border\n\ndemarcation \"according to the priorities agreed by both sides.\" (Note:\n\nMuallim stressed, and Salloukh supported, the necessity of ending\n\nIsrael's occupation of the Golan, Shebaa farms, Gajar, and Kfar Shuba.)\n\n-- a commitment to control borders, combat smuggling, and coordinate\n\nmore closely on border administration.\n\n-- agreement to reactivate joint committees on \"missing citizens\" in\n\nboth countries.\n\n-- agreement to reactivate commercial relations and to create a \"common\n\nmarket.\"\n\n-- agreement to review bilateral agreements \"objectively.\"\n\n---------------------------------------\n\nReport of Mounting Tensions Inside SARG\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n7. (S) According to XXXXXXXXXXXX, General Mohamad Sulayman's\n\nassassination remains a frequent source of controversy in internal SARG\n\ndeliberations. XXXXXXXXXXXX confided that tempers flared during an\n\nAugust 12 Higher Policy Council meeting when high level security service\n\nofficials openly questioned the government's continuation of indirect\n\nnegotiations with Israel and its \"generosity\" with Lebanon. The spark\n\nthat reportedly set off this discussion was FM Muallim's presentation on\n\npotential deliverables that would strengthen President Sleiman's hand,\n\nto include release of Lebanese prisoners. The security service chiefs\n\nclaimed that Syria would make concessions and not receive any tangible\n\ngains from engaging Lebanon or talking indirectly to Israel.\n\n8. (S) Underlying this tense exchange was frustration within the\n\nsecurity services that the SARG was all but ignoring the assassination\n\nof Sulayman (ref B), XXXXXXXXXXXX noted. Security service officials were\n\nsuggesting that \"if the Israelis did it\" (i.e., killed Sulayman, why was\n\nthe SARG continuing the dialogue? XXXXXXXXXXXX added, \"And if it was an\n\ninside job, people are wondering about their future.\" Bashar was thus\n\nunder increasing pressure to provide assurances to his security chiefs\n\nabout their positions and about the SARG's intention not to make\n\npremature concessions, such as public deliverables that would strengthen\n\nSleiman's position within the GOL. Bashar's brother Maher was \"somewhere\n\nin the middle\" of this debate and was seeking to play consensus maker\n\nand would likely make efforts to satisfy security service chiefs that\n\nSleiman visit had strengthened the regime's prestige, XXXXXXXXXXXX said.\n\n9. (S) Comment: As expected, the Sleiman visit was long on symbolism and\n\nshort on commitment to take immediate concrete actions. While this\n\nmeeting marked a historic precedent, the absence of any public mention\n\nof agreed timelines suggests the exchange of ambassadors could be a\n\nprolonged process. Unless Asad and Sleiman agreed privately to expedite\n\nministry-to-ministry talks, progress on other issues (prisoners,\n\nborders, bilateral agreements) is unlikely to move rapidly. Nonetheless,\n\nthe SARG will play up Sleiman's visit to demonstrate that Syria has met\n\na key French demand for further engagement. Internal SARG ripples from\n\nthe Sulayman assassination could lead to a confrontation, but thus far\n\nthe regime has contained these tensions from spilling over into the\n\npublic sphere. The Palace's spin of the visit as a success in blocking\n\nefforts to drive a wedge between Lebanon and Syria suggests an attempt\n\nto satisfy hard-liners that the regime's image has been bolstered.\n\nHYPERLINK \\l \"_top\" HOME PAGE\n\nUS embassy cables: US sought financial pressure on top Syrian officials\n\nGuardian,\n\n20 Dec. 2010,\n\nThursday, 15 March 2007, 15:41\n\nS E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 DAMASCUS 000269\n\nSIPDIS\n\nSIPDIS\n\nNEA/ELA;TREASURY FOR LEBENSON/GLASER/SZUBIN; NSC FOR\n\nMARCHESE\n\nEO 12958 DECL: 03/06/2017\n\nTAGS EFIN, ECON, ETTC, SY, SANC\n\nSUBJECT: TREASURY TEAM'S DAMASCUS CONSULTATIONS ON\n\nFINANCIAL SANCTIONS\n\nREF: A.

(S/NF) Summary: Treasury representatives recently visited Post to\n\ndiscuss options for using financial sanctions to apply pressure to the\n\nSyrian regime. We discussed:\n\n-- Treasury's requirements for finalizing the pending designations of\n\nMohammad Sulayman and Ali Mamluk, and Treasury's information\n\nrequirements for a public statement;\n\n-- Treasury's need to maintain the legal thread between the classified\n\ndesignation packet and the public statement announcing the designation;\n\n-- Post's support for designating Mohammad Nassif Kheirbek, SARG\n\npointman for its relationship with Iran;\n\n-- How designating regime financiers like Rami and Mohammad Mahlouf\n\ncould be problematic without a new Executive Order on corruption. End\n\nSummary.\n\n2. (S/NF) PENDING DESIGNATIONS: Post understands the designations for\n\nMohammad Sulieman, Syrian Special Presidential Advisor for Arms\n\nProcurement and Strategic Weapons and Ali Mamluk, Chief of the Syrian\n\nGeneral Intelligence Directorate, are pending due to a lack of\n\nunclassified material necessary for Treasury's public\n\nSIPDIS designation statement. In post's estimate, Mohammad Sulayman is a\n\nrelatively low-payoff target. His activities are not widely known, which\n\nwill make it difficult to obtain unclassified information for a public\n\nstatement and,\n\nSIPDIS likewise, make it unlikely that his designation would resonate\n\ninside Syria. Ali Mamluk, on the other hand, is more well-known within\n\nSyria, especially for involvement in his objectionable activities\n\nregarding Lebanon, and his suppressing Syrian civil society and the\n\ninternal opposition. Therefore, Mamluk's designation will likely have a\n\nlarger impact with local and regional audiences if the public statement\n\nannouncing his designation also discusses his oppression of Syrian\n\nsociety.\n\n3. (S/NF) We understood from our visit with Treasury representatives\n\nthat although we are limited to designating regime members under the\n\nexisting Executive Orders, there is some flexibility in Treasury,s\n\npublic statement announcing the designation.

Keirbek's designation could play to a\n\nSARG vulnerability, in this case, the SARG's relationship with Iran,\n\nwhich worries the Sunni majority. Designation of regime pillars involved\n\nwith the SARG's partnership with Iran could heighten Syrian and regional\n\nconcerns about the SARG's willingness to accomodate an expansionary\n\nIranian agenda.\n\n5.

Based on our\n\nconsultation with the Treasury representatives, it seemed apparent that\n\nwithout an Executive Order on corruption it would be difficult to\n\ncompile enough information to designate this group under the current\n\nexecutive orders. The other option for pursuing this group would be to\n\nshow how these individuals provided financial support to previously\n\ndesignated individuals such as Asif Shawkat.

Systematic\n\nviolations of international human rights law have created abject poverty\n\nand reduced approximately 1.7 million people to \"beneficiaries\" of\n\ninternational aid, forced into dependency as the result of a human-made,\n\nand completely preventable, humanitarian crisis.\n\nInternational human rights law and international humanitarian law offer\n\nnecessary protections to every individual on the basis of their shared\n\nhumanity. However, if they are to have meaning, these laws must be\n\nenforced. This is a core component: in the event of a violation,\n\naccountability and judicial remedy are the essential consequences.\n\nCustomary international law, binding on all states, recognises that this\n\naccountability should take the form of criminal accountability, through\n\ninvestigations and prosecutions, and civil accountability, through the\n\npayment of compensation.\n\nIt is this right to compensation that the Palestinian Centre for Human\n\nRights (PCHR) is fighting for today. In the current climate, given the\n\nbias inherent in the Israeli judicial system, compensation is one of the\n\nonly hopes for achieving some form of justice. Importantly, this\n\ncompensation â€“ although insignificant in comparison to the loss\n\nsuffered â€“ is essential for victims as they attempt to rebuild their\n\nlives and their homes.\n\nThis right is being comprehensively denied by the Israeli authorities.\n\nIsrael imposes a two-year statute of limitation on the submission of\n\ncivil complaints. Given the scale of violations committed in the context\n\nof the 2008-2009 offensive (Operation Cast Lead) on the Gaza Strip\n\nalone, this places an often insurmountable burden on the legal\n\nrepresentatives of the victims. Until the second intifada, the statue of\n\nlimitations was seven years.\n\nSecond, and in a requirement that places the final nail in the coffin\n\nwith respect to the right to a remedy, the court imposes an insurance\n\n(or guarantee) fee on each claimant, before a case can proceed. There is\n\nno fixed amount for this insurance fee, it is set at the discretion of\n\nthe court. However, it represents a significant financial hurdle,\n\ntypically in excess of 10,000 shekels ($2,787), and often much more. In\n\none case brought by PCHR, the claimants were asked to pay 20,000 shekels\n\nfor each of the five deaths reported.\n\nThis raises a bizarre but all-too-real scenario whereby the greater the\n\nviolation, the greater the financial hurdle. Palestinian victims are\n\nsimply unable to raise this money, and the case is closed firmly in\n\ntheir faces. This insurance fee is completely discretionary. It is not\n\nmandatory. In practice, it is always applied to Palestinian claimants.\n\nOn top of this is the reality of the closure. PCHR's lawyers cannot\n\ntravel to Israel to represent our clients, and we are forced to hire\n\nlawyers in Israel. However, these lawyers cannot come to Gaza to meet\n\nthe clients, and the clients cannot go to Israel to meet them. In\n\naddition, since June 2007, the Israeli military has refused permission\n\nto Palestinians involved in civil cases to appear in court, despite the\n\nissuance of a court order. This results in the effective dismissal of\n\nthe cases, and the absolute denial of justice.\n\nPCHR represents more than 1,000 victims of Operation Cast Lead. The\n\napproximately 500 cases prepared on their behalf constitute the\n\noverwhelming majority of cases prepared following Operation Cast Lead.\n\nThese individuals, who have suffered virtually the entire spectrum of\n\nrights violations â€“ from illegal killing and injury, to the illegal\n\ndestruction of their homes and workplaces â€“ have the right to justice.\n\nThey deserve to be heard by a court.\n\nSince March 2009, when the last notice to the ministry of defence was\n\nsubmitted, we have been systematically ignored. Despite repeated\n\nrequests, PCHR has only received interlocutory responses â€“ with no\n\ninformation â€“ with respect to 23 cases.\n\nToday, PCHR and attorney Michael Sfard are filing a petition before the\n\nIsraeli high court of justice, demanding that these victims' rights to a\n\njudicial remedy be upheld. Our request is simple, that the statute of\n\nlimitations be delayed, that the victims of Operation Cast Lead are at\n\nleast afforded the opportunity to take their case to court. If the court\n\nrejects this position, it will be closing the door to justice on all the\n\nvictims of Operation Cast Lead.\n\nThe rule of law is something we respect and hold dear. But it is\n\nself-evident that in order to be relevant, the law must be enforced. The\n\nabsence of justice has resulted in the dire situation we face today, in\n\nthe systematic violation of fundamental human rights, and the closure of\n\nthe Gaza Strip. Without justice, what is there to prevent what happened\n\nin Gaza from happening again?\n\nBehind the closed doors of the Gaza Strip, it is our shared humanity\n\nthat continues to link us to the outside world. We demand that our human\n\nrights be respected and protected. We demand that the international\n\ncommunity stay silent no longer, that it exerts its influence in the\n\nname of fundamental freedoms and justice.\n\nHYPERLINK \\l \"_top\" HOME PAGE\n\nPalestinians 'sided against Hamas'\n\nIndependent (original story is by the Associated Press)\n\n21 Dec. 2010,\n\nA cable released by WikiLeaks yesterday suggested close cooperation\n\nbetween Israel and forces loyal to the Palestinian President Mahmoud\n\nAbbas when militants from the rival Hamas group overran the Gaza Strip\n\nthree years ago.\n\nThe disclosure could embarrass Mr Abbas and his Fatah movement, which\n\nHamas has accused of working with the Israelis.

By 2012, Iran would be able to build one\n\nweapon within weeks and an arsenal within six months.\n\nThe cable, which was approved by Vershbow, included a comment next to\n\nBaidatzâ€™s remarks: â€œIt is unclear if the Israelis firmly believe\n\nthis or are using worst-case estimates to raise greater urgency from the\n\nUnited States.â€\n\nTurning to Hizbullah, the Israeli officials warned Vershbow that the\n\nShiâ€™ite guerrilla group was working hand-in-hand with the Lebanese\n\nArmed Forces.\n\nâ€œThe level of cooperation far exceeds what many assume is simply the\n\nday-to-day problem of corruption within the ranks,â€ the cable\n\nsummarized the Israeli side as saying.\n\nâ€œOn the contrary, Israel believes that LAF/Hizbullah cooperation is a\n\nmatter of national policy â€“ any information shared with the United\n\nNations Interim Force-Lebanon (UNIFIL) goes directly to Hizbullah by way\n\nof the Lebanese Armed Forces.â€\n\nThe meeting took place in the days before Syria transferred a cache of\n\nM600 long-range and accurate surface- to-surface missiles to Hizbullah.\n\nBaidatz told Vershbow that Israel knew about the missile cache in Syria\n\nand believed that it was destined for Hizbullah.\n\nâ€œUnder such a scenario, the looming question for Israeli policy-makers\n\nthen becomes: â€˜To strike or not to strike?â€™â€ Baidatz was\n\nparaphrased as saying.\n\nIn the end, Israel did not attack the arms convoys to Lebanon, and\n\nHizbullah is believed today to have hundreds of M600s, which have a\n\nrange of 250 km. and can carry a half-ton warhead.\n\nMeanwhile, Assad was quoted on Monday as saying that Syria did not have\n\na partner for peace in Israelâ€™s â€œextremistâ€ current government.\n\nâ€œWe are prepared for peace and we have a clear plan that can lead us\n\nthere,â€ Assad was quoted as saying in an interview with the German\n\ndaily Bild. â€œBut we need a partner and we donâ€™t have one so far.\n\nâ€œThe Israeli people elected an extremist government that will not\n\nbring about peace,â€ he said, according to the report. â€œWill the\n\nIsraeli people change this situation?

To the\n\ncontrary, we face one rogue state with nuclear capabilities, and, unless\n\nwe can devise a more effective approach than the one of the past decade,\n\nwe are likely to face another soon.\n\nWe are in a worse position with Iran than with North Korea. As the New\n\nYork Post editorial board noted: \"In the Far East, North Korea has the\n\nbacking of the ascendant power, China. In the Mideast, Iran aspires to\n\nbe the ascendant power.\" And that is because leaders in the region\n\nperceive that the United States abandons friends, shrinks from even the\n\nthreat of military force to defend its fundamental interests, and does\n\nlittle to assist democracy advocates who might destabilize despotic\n\nregimes. Iran is rising because America is retreating. Until we, through\n\nword and deed, reverse that, Iran will move ever closer to attainment of\n\nnuclear weapons and hegemonic influence in the region.\n\nHYPERLINK \\l \"_top\" HOME PAGE\n\nThe Captive Arab Mind\n\nBy ROGER COHEN\n\nNew York Times,\n\n20 Dec. 2010,\n\nLONDON â€” At this point it is clear enough who invaded Iraq. Contrary\n\nto general opinion, it was Iran. After all, applying the Roman principle\n\nof cui bono â€” â€œto whose benefit?â€ â€” there can be no question\n\nthat Iran, the greatest beneficiary of the ousting of its enemy Saddam\n\nHussein and the rise to power of Shiites in Baghdad, must have done it.\n\nI know it appears that the United States was behind the invasion. What\n\nabout â€œshock and aweâ€ and all that? Hah! It is true that the\n\ndeception was elaborate. But consider the facts: The invasion of Iraq\n\nhas weakened the United States, Iranâ€™s old enemy, and so it can only\n\nbe â€” quod erat demonstrandum â€” that Tehran was the devious\n\nmastermind.\n\nThis mocking â€œanalysisâ€ is often deployed deadpan by my colleague,\n\nRobert Worth, the New York Times correspondent in Beirut. After three\n\nyears living in Lebanon and crisscrossing the Arab world, he uses this\n\nâ€œtheoryâ€ to express his frustration with the epidemic of cui bono\n\nthinking in the region.\n\nI say â€œthinking,â€ but thatâ€™s generous. What we are dealing with\n\nhere is the paltry harvest of captive minds. Such minds resort to\n\nconspiracy theory because it is the ultimate refuge of the powerless. If\n\nyou cannot change your own life, it must be that some greater force\n\ncontrols the world.\n\nWhile I was in Beirut this month, the conspiratorial world view was in\n\noverdrive, driven by WikiLeaks and by the imminence of an indictment\n\nfrom an international tribunal investigating the 2005 assassination of\n\nthe former prime minister Rafik Hariri: more on that later.\n\nThe notion was actually doing the rounds that recent shark attacks at\n\nthe Egyptian resort of Sharm el Sheik were the work of Mossad, the\n\nIsraeli secret service. Hadnâ€™t someone seen an electronic device\n\nattached to a shark being directed from Tel Aviv, video-game style, to\n\ndevour a Russian touristâ€™s leg?\n\nOne Egyptian government official suggested the theory was plausible\n\nenough. After all, damage to the Egyptian tourist industry could only\n\nplease Israel. Cui bono ?\n\nIn his seminal collection of essays, â€œThe Captive Mind,â€ Czeslaw\n\nMilosz described the intellectualâ€™s relationship to Stalinist\n\ntotalitarianism: â€œHis chief characteristic is his fear of thinking for\n\nhimself.â€\n\nLebanon is a freewheeling delight on the surface â€” as far from Soviet\n\ngloom as can be imagined â€” but it betrays the servile mind-set of\n\npowerless people convinced that they are ultimately but puppets. This\n\nplayground of sectarian interests, where each community has its external\n\nbacker, may be the perfect incubator of conspiracy theories.\n\nBut Lebanon is only an extreme case in an Arab world, where the Internet\n\nand new media outlets have not prised open minds conditioned by decades\n\nof repression and weakness.\n\nHariri, who was pro-Western and anti-Syrian, was assassinated in\n\ndowntown Beirut. Suspicion fell on Syrian agents. A United Nations\n\ntribunal was set up to investigate â€” itself a reflection of\n\nLebanonâ€™s weakness in that the countryâ€™s own institutions were\n\ndeemed inadequate.\n\nFive years later, I found the investigation irrevocably infected by cui\n\nbono fever. â€œWho took advantage of the killing?â€ Talal Atrissi, a\n\npolitical analyst, asked me. â€œNot the Syrians, they left Lebanon\n\nafterward. It was the United States that benefited.â€ Hah!\n\nAli Fayyad, a Hezbollah member of Parliament, told me: â€œThe tribunal\n\nis entirely politicized, an illegal entity used by the United States as\n\none of the tools of regional conflict against Syria and the\n\nresistance.â€\n\nTheories abound that Israel penetrated the Lebanese cellphone system to\n\ncoordinate an assassination portrayed as providing the pretext for a\n\nfailed anti-Syrian putsch by the West (much as 9/11 is grotesquely\n\nperceived in the Arab world as a self-inflicted pretext for the United\n\nStates to wage war against Muslims).\n\nWhy, it is asked, was an international tribunal set up for Hariri but\n\nnot for Benazir Bhuttoâ€™s killing? Why has the C.I.A. not been\n\ninterrogated? Such questions now have such a hold on Lebanon that I have\n\nreluctantly concluded that justice and truth in the Hariri case are\n\nimpossible, victims of the captive Arab mind.\n\nIn the cui bono universe there can be no closure because events stream\n\non endlessly, opening up boundless possibilities for ex post facto\n\ntheorizing.\n\nOf course, the saga of WikiLeaksâ€™ Julian Assange and the leak of a\n\nquarter million secret U.S. diplomatic cables are also viewed as part of\n\nsome grand conspiracy. They reflect the decline of America and the\n\nrevolt of its vast federal bureaucracy! No, they demonstrate Americaâ€™s\n\nenduring power, recruiting female Swedish agents to accuse Assange of\n\nsex crimes!\n\nThe truth is more banal. The WikiLeaks cables reveal autocratic but\n\npowerless Sunni Arab governments calling on the United States to do\n\neverything they are unable to do themselves â€” from decapitating Iran\n\nto coordinating a Sunni attack on an ascendant Hezbollah in Lebanon.\n\nSuch fecklessness, and the endless conspiracy theories that go with it,\n\nsuggest an Arab world still gripped by illusion.\n\nMilosz wrote powerfully of the â€œsolace of reverieâ€ in worlds of\n\noppression. I found much solace in Lebanon but little evidence that the\n\nMiddle East is ready to exchange conspiratorial victimhood for\n\nself-empowerment â€” and so move forward.\n\nHYPERLINK \\l \"_top\" HOME PAGE\n\nSpecial Report: Why Egypt's Power Has Dimmed\n\nNew York Times (original opinion is By Reuters)\n\n20 Dec. 2010,\n\nCAIRO (Reuters) - At Bayoumy's, a dingy, smoke-filled tea shop in\n\ndowntown Cairo, Egyptian football fans groaned at the \"biased\" referee\n\nas they watched their national team lose 2-1 to the Gulf state of Qatar\n\nin a friendly last week. Once the television commentary had died away\n\nand people turned back to their backgammon games, some pondered an\n\nawkward question for Egypt, which prides itself on being the pre-eminent\n\nregional power. Why is it that gas-rich Qatar, a football minnow ranked\n\n113 in the world, will host the 2022 World Cup -- the first in the\n\nMiddle East -- while Egypt did not win a single vote when it bid for the\n\nCup six years ago?\n\n\"Qatar does not have the history that Egypt has, but it has vision,\n\nmoney and the goal to be a leader among nations in the region,\" sighed\n\nthe tea-shop proprietor Mr Bayoumy, reflecting on the past under former\n\npresident Gamal Abdel Nasser. \"Egypt had vision and resolve in Abdel\n\nNasser's time and was even more independent than Qatar now, which has\n\nthe largest U.S. military base in the Middle East. But this country has\n\nno vision any more, only officials who look after themselves.\"\n\nSipping his tea, Haj Masoud, 67, also lamented Egypt's lack of vitality.\n\n\"Qatar is new at everything: diplomacy, history, wealth,\" he said.\n\n\"Egypt has a long history in all of these areas but its people are too\n\nbusy making ends meet.\"\n\nEgypt may still be a football powerhouse -- it captured the Cup of\n\nAfrican Nations for the seventh time this year to bring its FIFA world\n\nranking to 10 -- but it can no longer claim automatic primacy as the\n\nforemost political, economic and cultural country in the Middle East.\n\nNon-Arab Turkey, Iran and Israel all arguably pack a bigger punch than\n\nEgypt these days, while oil giants Saudi Arabia and the United Arab\n\nEmirates outmuscle it financially. Even an agile lightweight like Qatar\n\ncan dodge into a diplomatic -- and sporting -- ring that Cairo once\n\ndominated.\n\n\"Egypt has virtually no influence as far as I can tell,\" says\n\nBeirut-based commentator Rami Khouri, who dates the decline in Cairo's\n\nclout to then-leader Anwar Sadat's 1977 peace-making trip to Jerusalem,\n\nwhen the Arab world pointedly declined to follow his lead. \"Egypt used\n\nto be a creative, dynamic place, culturally and politically. Now it's\n\nvery static and others have become more dynamic -- the Syrians,\n\nHezbollah, the Iranians, the Qataris. None of them has become the\n\ndominant actor, but they all play a role that used to be more\n\nmonopolized by Egypt.\"\n\nFADING INFLUENCE\n\nEgypt used to be the undisputed Arab power. In the 1950s and 60s, Nasser\n\nelectrified Arabs with his defiance of colonial powers, enmity for\n\nIsrael and heady brand of Arab nationalism and socialism. Western powers\n\nloathed him, just as today they revile Iranian leader Mahmoud\n\nAhmadinejad and his \"resistance\" rhetoric.\n\nNasser projected Egyptian influence far and wide, even if he met\n\nultimate disaster with defeat in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. His\n\nsuccessor, Sadat, offered a bold alternative when he made Egypt the\n\nfirst Arab country to sign a peace treaty with Israel. Initially, the\n\npeace deal consolidated Egypt's role as the Middle East's most important\n\ninterlocutor.\n\nIn the 21st century, though, Egypt's voice has faded. Today it is Iran,\n\nSaudi Arabia, and Syria which consult on how to keep Lebanon from\n\nslipping back into chaos. Iran is the outsider that carries most weight\n\nin Iraq's political struggles. Turkey has hosted indirect peace talks\n\nbetween Israel and Syria, linked up with Brazil to tackle Iran's nuclear\n\nrow with the West and tried to reconcile rival Palestinian factions.\n\nEven Qatar, home of al-Jazeera, the satellite television news station\n\nwhich helped destroy the grip of state media around the Arab world, has\n\nsought to mediate in conflicts in Yemen, Lebanon and Sudan's Darfur\n\nregion -- Egypt's own backyard.\n\nThen there's the appeal of militant movements such as Lebanon's\n\nHezbollah and the Palestinian Islamist Hamas, which can often resonate\n\nmore than the policies of Egyptian and other Arab leaders who shelter\n\nunder an unpopular U.S. military umbrella.\n\nPresident Hosni Mubarak, 82, who has ruled Egypt for almost 30 years and\n\nmay well stand for a sixth term next year, has preserved the peace\n\ntreaty with Israel and stuck solidly in the U.S. camp. What he lacks,\n\nsays Amr Hamzawy, an analyst at the Carnegie Endowment's Middle East\n\nCenter, is \"the vision component. Mubarak is not a visionary leader and\n\nis too old to become one.\"\n\nTURKEY'S RISING STAR\n\nTo get an idea of how far Egypt has slipped, it's instructive to look at\n\nTurkey, which in the past decade has transformed itself from a financial\n\nbasket-case sitting on the periphery of Europe into a star emerging\n\nmarket and a rising regional power.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund expects Turkey's economy, buoyed by\n\npolitical stability and market-friendly reforms, to grow 7.8 percent in\n\n2010, making it one of the world's best performers. That outshines\n\nEgypt, which is expected to grow by a still-sprightly 6 percent this\n\nfiscal year, after 5.1 percent last.\n\nAnd it's not just the economy. A Brookings Institution poll this year\n\nfound that Arabs admired Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan more than\n\nany other world leader. Under Erdogan's Islamist-rooted AK Party, in\n\npower since 2002, Turkey has fostered stronger trade and business links\n\nwith Muslim countries. Its political and cultural profile has also risen\n\nin the Arab world, which it ruled for centuries as part of the Ottoman\n\nempire, sharing social and religious affinities.\n\nIn the past, Turkey -- NATO's only Muslim member -- avoided getting\n\nembroiled in the Middle Eastern quagmire. But in recent years it has\n\nused its growing influence and prestige to mediate in difficult\n\nconflicts. In a nod to growing Turkish clout, Barack Obama chose Turkey\n\nas the first Muslim country he visited as U.S. president -- a trip seen\n\nas a diplomatic coup in Ankara, even though he later reached out to the\n\nIslamic world in a speech from Cairo.\n\nErdogan's condemnation of Israel after a deadly Israeli raid on a\n\nTurkish-led aid convoy bound for the Gaza Strip last May turned him into\n\na hero in the Arab street -- people in the Cairo slum of Manshiet Nasr\n\nhung Turkish flags from their windows.\n\nArab interest in Turkish culture -- from TV soap operas, pop music and\n\nfood to Turkey's rehabilitation of its Ottoman history -- has also\n\nsurged, fuelling an influx of Arab tourists. Istanbul, the old imperial\n\ncapital, has become a popular wedding destination for Arabs.\n\n\"There are a number of areas in which you can say that Turkey has\n\novertaken Egypt's place as a regional power,\" says Hugh Pope, an author\n\nof books on Turkey and a senior analyst at the International Crisis\n\nGroup, a Brussels-based conflict resolution group. \"In the 1950s and\n\n1960s, Egypt was the voice that moved the Arab masses. Now the voice of\n\nErdogan is the voice that moves the masses despite Turkey not being an\n\nArab country.\"\n\nPope points out that Turkey has used its access to EU and U.S. markets\n\nand investments to liberalize and modernize, while many Arab economies,\n\nsuch as Egypt's, still wrestle with the legacy of state control.\n\n\"Turkey has a democratically elected government that is liberal,\n\nopen-minded and Western-oriented, so its rise has not been threatening\n\nto the West ... It's a model of benign Islam,\" says Hilal Khashan, a\n\npolitical science professor at the American University of Beirut. \"The\n\ndecline of Egypt's role is largely self-inflicted, as Mubarak's\n\nauthority is not democratic.\"\n\nOIL-POWERED VISION\n\nBut democracy is not the only way to gain power. Qatar and the United\n\nArab Emirates, sleepy desert backwaters in the 1960s, have built shiny\n\ncity-states in the Gulf, spending oil and gas revenue freely on\n\ninfrastructure installed almost from scratch.\n\n\"The success of the UAE is less a success due to oil than a success of\n\nvision,\" said Jean-Francois Seznec, a Georgetown University professor.\n\n\"Much of the credit ... is down to two very dynamic ruling sheikhs,\n\nZayed in Abu Dhabi and Rashid in Dubai. Under these rulers, the UAE\n\nroared into the modern world. They dragged their backward populations\n\nalong for the ride.\"\n\nWith only six million people, most of them foreign workers, the UAE can\n\nreact rapidly to changes and opportunities, he said. To achieve\n\nexplosive economic growth, its leaders flattened bureaucracy, \"did not\n\nimpose taxes and in general provided an atmosphere of free trade\".\n\nSeznec said Gulf Arabs seem to pity Egypt. \"Certainly its political\n\ninfluence has waned completely in any of the issues around, in favor of\n\nSaudi Arabia. From an economic standpoint, Egypt has even less\n\ninfluence.\"\n\nEgyptians may have a solid national identity, compared to the Gulf\n\nstatelets, but can only gasp at their spending power. Two-fifths of\n\nEgypt's people live in poverty, 30 percent are illiterate and food price\n\ninflation is 22 percent. \"Qatar has money and knows how to spend it\n\nwell, while our country also has money, but does not spend it right,\"\n\nsaid Farouk Magdy, a student at Cairo's Future University, paying rueful\n\ntribute to the \"amazing\" World Cup stadiums the Qataris are planning.\n\n\"We could never have competed against their stuff.\"\n\nTHE U.S. CONNECTION\n\nIt hasn't helped that Egypt has bet everything on U.S.-led Middle East\n\npeace efforts, whose protracted failure may have proved a liability.\n\n\"Sadat, Mubarak and others promised that peace will not be a separate\n\npeace with Israel, but an Arab-Israeli peace, and also that peace will\n\nbring prosperity,\" says Gamal Soltan, of Cairo's Al-Ahram Center for\n\nPolitical and Strategic Studies. Many Arabs now \"perceive Egypt as a\n\ncountry just allying with the U.S. to protect the regime or implement\n\nU.S. policies or plots in the region.\"\n\nEgypt receives about $1.3 billion a year in U.S. military aid, hosts one\n\nof the world's biggest American embassies and, along with Saudi Arabia,\n\nis Washington's most important Arab ally. In the Mubarak era, Cairo's\n\nmain diplomatic role has been to facilitate Israeli-Palestinian peace\n\ntalks and, in recent years, to try to reconcile feuding Palestinian\n\ngroups Fatah and Hamas. Neither effort has borne fruit so far.\n\nAnd while Washington and its Western allies appreciate Egypt's mediation\n\nefforts, some Arab leaders are privately scathing. Qatari Prime Minister\n\nHamad bin Jassim Al Thani, quoted in a leaked U.S. cable made public by\n\nWikiLeaks, said Egypt had \"no end-game\", only a vested interest in\n\ndragging out Palestinian reconciliation talks as long as possible.\n\n\"Serving as broker of the talks is Egypt's only business interest with\n\nthe U.S.,\" the Qatari leader said.\n\nSMOTHERING OPPOSITION\n\nEgypt's weaker role abroad may also be a result of its obsession with\n\nproblems at home. Eliminating political challenges sucks up much energy,\n\nwhile corruption and an inert bureaucracy have hollowed out institutions\n\nand undercut economic reform efforts.\n\nMubarak, a former airforce commander, took over after Islamist militants\n\nassassinated Sadat in 1981 and has kept Egypt under emergency law ever\n\nsince, stifling political freedom behind a facade of elections and\n\nmulti-party democracy. On his watch, Egypt rebuilt ties with the Arab\n\nworld in the 1980s, crushed an Islamist insurgency at home in the 1990s\n\nand accelerated liberal economic reforms from 2004, fuelling three years\n\nof 7 percent growth until a surge in global food prices and then a world\n\neconomic slump braked the momentum.\n\nYet Egypt is burdened by the explosive expansion of its 79\n\nmillion-strong population -- set to double by 2043 if today's 2 percent\n\nannual growth rate persists. That population boom means that on a\n\nper-capita basis, Egypt's economy has also lagged behind peers such as\n\nBrazil and South Africa.\n\nUgly bouts of sectarian friction between majority Muslims and the Coptic\n\nOrthodox Christians who form at least a tenth of the population have\n\neroded a long tradition of coexistence.\n\nA more vibrant media scene now enlivens debate, but no major rival to\n\nMubarak's National Democratic Party (NDP) has emerged, and the\n\ndemocratic deficit in a security-obsessed state risks tipping into\n\nbankruptcy.\n\nThe November 28 election produced a lopsided parliament almost devoid of\n\nopposition. Mubarak endorsed the vote, but even the United States said\n\nit was \"dismayed\" by reports of election-day interference and\n\nintimidation by security forces. Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood, a\n\npan-Islamic movement and the main opposition group, has scant appetite\n\nfor organizing protests likely to invite a strong government crackdown,\n\nknowing it cannot count on support from Western countries wary of\n\npolitical Islam, according to Shahid Hamid, an analyst at the Brookings\n\nDoha Center. \"It is interested above all in survival and has little\n\ninterest in provoking an all-out confrontation with the regime. They\n\nbelieve history is on their side and are willing to wait.\"\n\nMost Egyptians did not bother to vote in last month's poll and many\n\ngreeted the results with apathy and ingrained cynicism, not street\n\nprotests. Stop people in the streets of Alexandria, Egypt's second city,\n\nand they readily share their frustrations.\n\n\"Elections mean nothing in Alexandria or in Egypt,\" complained Mohamed\n\nAbdel Fattah, a 68-year-old carpenter. \"People are sick of politics.\n\nEach candidate is dirtier than the last, they buy votes with money --\n\nit's one big mafia.\"\n\nZinhar Rushdi, 52, an insurance employee in a suit, said MPs routinely\n\nignore their constituents once they have secured the \"personal gains and\n\nperks\" that accrue from an assembly seat. \"It's a patronage system,\" he\n\nexplained, his soft voice almost drowned by the din of traffic.\n\n\"Businessmen get immunity so they have cover to pursue everything they\n\nwant.\"\n\nCRISIS OF LEGITIMACY\n\nIs there any hope of change? Mubarak's plans are uncertain. He has had\n\nhealth scares and is the second-oldest Arab leader after Saudi Arabia's\n\nailing King Abdullah. If he runs in next year's presidential election,\n\nhe will win. If he steps aside or fails to last his term, no one can be\n\nsure who will take over.\n\nDespite official denials, many Egyptians believe Mubarak has groomed his\n\nbusinessman-politician son Gamal for the job, but few relish the notion\n\nof a dynastic handover in a republic.\n\n\"Mubarak's ideal of a strong but fair leader would seem to discount\n\nGamal Mubarak to some degree, given Gamal's lack of military experience,\n\nand may explain Mubarak's hands-off approach to the succession\n\nquestion,\" mused U.S. ambassador Margaret Scobey in another leaked\n\ndiplomatic cable. \"Indeed, he seems to be trusting to God and the\n\nubiquitous military and civilian security services to ensure an orderly\n\ntransition,\" she wrote.\n\nUNEVEN DIVIDENDS\n\nLobna Mahmoud's grey Mercedes purrs past a security gate into the sudden\n\ncalm of Palm Hills, where gardeners tend grassy terraces, sprinklers\n\nhiss over flower beds and birds sing. The villa she bought five years\n\nago -- prices have tripled since -- is nearly complete, with its marble\n\nfloors and pitched tile roof. It looks over a sprawling club with\n\nfloodlit football pitch, tennis courts, Olympic-sized pool, cafes and\n\nrestaurants.\n\n\"When I saw this place, it was like a dream,\" says Mahmoud, 45, a\n\nbusinesswoman who imports chemicals for paint factories. It may be only\n\n30 km (19 miles) from downtown Cairo, but Palm Hills and many similar\n\nprojects now ringing the city are a world away from the capital's\n\nrelentless smog, grime and noise.\n\nFor most Egyptians, they might as well be on another planet.\n\nIn the gritty railway town of Dalgamoun, in the Nile Delta north of\n\nCairo, black motor rickshaws jostle past plodding buffaloes in the\n\nmostly unpaved streets -- a place where small factories and workshops\n\ncoexist with slower rural rhythms. \"Prices are rising like fire and I\n\ncan't keep up, with the money I make and the big family I have,\" says\n\n67-year-old Ali Abu Issa, serving tea in a truck-stop cafe on the\n\noutskirts of town. A grizzled ex-soldier who fought in Yemen and in the\n\n1967 and 1973 wars against Israel, he has eight children.\n\n\"I call out to Mubarak to help us,\" he says, asserting that the\n\npresident has a self-interested entourage which keeps him in the dark\n\nabout the plight of the people. \"Officials are corrupt and greedy. They\n\ntake everything and leave us only scraps.\"\n\nRich-poor contrasts in Egypt seem starker than ever, but the government\n\ndenies that only a privileged few have benefited from economic reform.\n\nWealth is trickling down, insists Finance Minister Youssef\n\nBoutros-Ghali. \"The quality of life of the average Egyptian has improved\n\nsignificantly, despite what you hear in the street.\"\n\nEgypt could have done even better, he told Reuters, if reforms were not\n\nobstructed by bureaucracy and \"people who don't believe foreigners\n\nshould invest or buy land here -- as if they were going to put it on\n\ntheir backs and walk off with it\".\n\nMagdy Rady, the cabinet spokesman, acknowledged that Egypt has lagged\n\nTurkey in attracting foreign direct investment in the past six years.\n\nGovernment figures show Egypt lured a total of $45 billion against\n\nTurkey's $81 billion in that period.\n\n\"The best we achieved was $13 billion,\" Rady says, adding that Turkey,\n\nwhich hit a high of $22 billion in 2007, had been spurred on by its\n\nambitions to join the European Union.\n\nEgypt can hardly aspire to EU membership, but, with no transition to\n\nmore dynamic leadership in sight, hosting the Arab world's first World\n\nCup might have been just the kind of project to galvanize the nation.\n\nWith Qatar having grabbed those bragging rights, the football-crazy\n\ncustomers in Mr Bayoumy's tea-shop have a despondent analysis.\n\n\"Egypt's role is retreating in the region,\" said Magdy Saroh, a\n\n43-year-old engineer, \"because Egypt has stood still for 30 years while\n\nyounger, energetic countries like Qatar that were not on the map have\n\nsprung up and are speeding ahead.\" (Additional reporting by Marwa Awad,\n\nEdmund Blair, Yasmine Saleh, Patrick Werr and Dina Zayed in Cairo, Ibon\n\nVillelabeitia in Ankara and Martina Fuchs in Dubai; Editing by Simon\n\nRobinson and Sara Ledwith)\n\nHYPERLINK \\l \"_top\" HOME PAGE\n\nJerusalem Post: HYPERLINK\n\n\"http://www.jpost.com/Headlines/Article.aspx?id=200219\" 'Report: Assad\n\nsees no partner for peace in Israel' ..(Jerusalem Post depends on Bild\n\nnewspaper in this news)..\n\nExpectia: ' HYPERLINK\n\n\"http://www.expatica.com/de/news/german-news/obama-has-created-more-desp\n\nair--in-mideast-assad_118552.html\" Obama has created more 'despair' in\n\nMideast: Assad '..\n\nJerusalem Post: HYPERLINK\n\n\"http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Article.aspx?id=200265\" 'Amos Gilad: Abbas\n\n'won't survive politically' past 2011 '..\n\nThe Peninsula: HYPERLINK\n\n\"http://www.thepeninsulaqatar.com/middle-east/136328-iraqi-refugees-in-s\n\nyria-complain-of-un-indifference.html\" 'Iraqi refugees in Syria\n\ncomplain of UN indifference '..\n\nProjo Journal: HYPERLINK\n\n\"http://www.projo.com/opinion/contributors/content/CT_mattsyria_12-20-10\n\n_VTJDIO3_v5.21e420e.html\" Bring back the Hejaz Railway\n\nArutz Sheva: HYPERLINK\n\n\"http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/news.aspx/141253\" Singer Ariel\n\nZilber Boycotted by Israeli Band ..\n\nFinancial Times: HYPERLINK\n\n\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/c599fab0-0b99-11e0-a313-00144feabdc0.html\"\n\nAn Arab dream betrayed at birth â€¦\n\nHYPERLINK \\l \"_top\" HOME PAGE\n\nPAGE\n\nPAGE \\* MERGEFORMAT 1\n\nPAGE \\* MERGEFORMAT 1\n\nAttached Files\n\n#FilenameSize 324896324896_WorldWideEng.Report 21-Dec.doc167KiB"
