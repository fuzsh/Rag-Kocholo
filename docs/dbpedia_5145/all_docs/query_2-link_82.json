        "text": "Concrete is indeed one of the most consumed construction materials all over the world. In spite of that, its behavior towards absolute volume change is still faced with uncertainties in terms of chemical and physical reactions at different stages of its life span, starting from the early time of hydration process, which depends on various factors including water/cement ratio, concrete proportioning and surrounding environmental conditions. This interest in understanding and defining the different types of shrinkage and the factors impacting each one is driven by the importance of these volumetric variations in determining the concrete permeability, which ultimately controls its durability. Many studies have shown that the total prevention of concrete from undergoing shrinkage is impractical. However, different practices have been used to control various types of shrinkage in concrete and limit its magnitude. This paper provides a detailed review of the major and latest findings rega...\n\nRecent trends in concrete technology have been towards high-strength concrete and ultra-high strength concrete with a low water-cement ratio. However, these high and ultra-high strength concretes have some problems. One of the problems is early-age cracking due to autogenous shrinkage. This study presents the results of an experimental investigation carried out to evaluate the autogenous shrinkage of high and ultra-high strength concrete. Main ideas on autogenous shrinkage are based on the use of ordinary Portland cement, but it has already become apparent that mineral admixtures and fibers change the behavior significantly. Variables were taken to study its effect on shrinkage like (effects of water/cement ratio, cement content, coarse aggregate content, silica fume percentage and steel fiber). From the test results, it is concluded that the autogenous shrinkage strain of mixes increases with decrease w/c ratio and decrease with increasing w/c ratio and concrete with the higher value of cement content, shows greater amounts of shrinkage. The autogenous shrinkage strain increases with decreasing of the coarse aggregate content. The additions of 10-20 % of silica fume to the mix increase the autogenous shrinkage strains of concrete specimens. The autogenous shrinkage decreased gradually with the increase of steel fiber content.\n\nUltra-High Performance Concretes (UHPC) are cement-based materials with a very low water-to-binder ratio that present a very-high compressive strength, high tensile strength and ductility as well as excellent durability, making them very interesting for various civil engineering applications. However, one drawback of UHPC is their pretty high autogenous shrinkage stemming from their very low water-to-binder ratio. There are several options to reduce UHPC shrinkage, such as the use of fibers (steel fibers, polypropylene fibers, wollastonite microfibers), shrinkage-reducing admixtures (SRA), expansive admixtures (EA), saturated lightweight aggregates (SLWA) and superabsorbent polymers (SAP). Other factors related to curing conditions, such as humidity and temperature, also affect the shrinkage of UHPC. The aim of this paper is to investigate the impact of various SRA, different mixing and curing conditions (low to moderate mixing temperatures, moderate to high relative humidity and wa...\n\nThrough its lifespan, concrete undergoes several physical and chemical changes, which normally led to shrinkage of concrete, especially at an early age, when the initial hydration processes take place. The shrinkage of concrete at an early stage of hardening may lead to the initial formation of cracks that vary in shape and size and depends on the concrete constituents and surrounding conditions, including temperature and/or the moisture state that may lead to volumetric deformation Many studies have shown that the total prevention of concrete from undergoing shrinkage is impractical. However, different practices have been used to control various types of shrinkage in concrete and limit its magnitude. This paper provides the shrinkage behavior of cement concrete incorporated with different mineral admixtures and fibers."
