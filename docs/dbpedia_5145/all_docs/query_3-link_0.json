His officers became increasingly active in both Lebanon and northern Israel.[6]\n\n1958–1963\n\n[edit]\n\nIn February 1958, the Syrian government merged with Egypt to form the United Arab Republic (UAR).[6] The union lasted until September 1961. During that union, Syrian intelligence services came under the overall authority of the Egyptian Directorate of General Intelligence with Salah Nasr as director.[7] After its secession from the UAR in 1961, the new Syrian government under President Nazim al-Qudsi reformed security sector. The Deuxième Bureau and a reformed civilian intelligence, renamed as the Internal Security Forces Command (ISFC), started their activities in Lebanon. On 15 December 1961, Col. Muhammad Hisham al-Samman was appointed as Commander of Internal Security Forces, assisted by a Committee under his presidency.[8] Along with the Kuzbari government, he pledged to establish political liberties and to disestablish emergency laws, which never came into existence. With the 1963 Syrian coup d'état, the security services adapted to the new political system of the Ba'ath Party.\n\n1963–1971\n\n[edit]\n\nThe renewed service was used in April 1964 to crackdown uprisings in Hama led by the Syrian Muslim Brotherhood and backed by Egypt.[9] On 24 March 1965, Decree No. 67 put the ISFC into a military framework with link to the Interior Ministry, thus ending the civilian control.[10] After the February 1966 coup within the Ba'th Party, Salah Jadid emerged as the leader of Syria's most radical regime to date.[11] Jadid centralized control of all intelligence and security services under Col. Abd al-Karim al-Jundi, the head of the National Security Bureau of the Ba'ath Party.[12] From 1966 to 1969, Jundi further expanded the role and power of the Syrian agencies, both at home and abroad. It was during this period that their reputation for brutal ruthlessness was firmly established. The use of Palestinian guerrillas against Israel was core of its foreign intelligence.[5]\n\n1971–present\n\n[edit]\n\nIn November 1970, Hafez al-Assad ousted Jadid in what he labelled a Corrective Movement. The new system has proved to be Syria's most stable and durable since independence and has toned down the previous radicalism. Under Assad there has been a remarkable continuity among the senior personnel in the intelligence community.[5] The General Security Directorate was established in 1971. The service was in competition with Political Security Directorate in the late 20th century.[13] Maj. Gen. Ghazi Kanaan possibly headed international security of the General Security Directorate in the late 20th century.[14] In the late 20th century, between 1998 and 2001, Maj. Gen Ali Houri was director of General Security Directorate.[14]\n\nAfter Bashar al-Assad's takeover in 2000, Maj. Gen. Ali Hammoud was named as head of GID. In 2001, Hisham Ikhtiyar became the head of the General Security Directorate, replacing Ali Hammoud, who became the Minister of Interior.[15] General Ikhtiyar was close to Bashar al-Assad's deceased brother-in-law Assef Shawkat.[13] President Bashar Assad in June 2005 appointed General Ali Mamlouk as commander of the General Security Directorate.[16]\n\nSix years later in April 2011, the US government imposed sanctions on Ali Mamlouk, saying he had been responsible for human rights abuses, including the use of violence against civilians. Agency had repressed internal dissent, monitored individual citizens, and had been involved in the Syrian government's actions in Daraa, where protesters were killed by Syrian security services. The next month, the EU also imposed sanctions on Ali Mamlouk, saying he had been involved in efforts to suppress anti-government protesters. A Sunni, he is said to be on good terms with all of Syria's intelligence agencies – the heads of Air Force Intelligence and the Political Security Directorate were once his assistants. He is a part of Bashar al-Assad's inner circle.[2]\n\nAfter the 18 July 2012 bombing of the Central Crisis Management Cell (Syria) and the death of its four key members of team, Mohammed Dib Zaitoun was named as head of the General Security Directorate.[17]\n\nOrganization\n\n[edit]\n\nThe General Intelligence Directorate is under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Interior.[18] The GID is also controlled by the President Bashar al-Assad through the National Security Bureau of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party Central Command.[19] It is divided into three branches:\n\nInternal Security Division (Branch 251)\n\nExternal Security Division\n\nPalestinian Affairs Division[3]\n\nResponsibility\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Internal Security Division is responsible for the surveillance of the population, counterintelligence, counter-terrorism, security of Damascus as well as protection of the Government of Syria. The External Security Division is tasked with foreign intelligence work and national security protection. And the Palestinian Affairs Division is responsible for monitoring the activities of Palestinian groups in Syria and Lebanon.[14]\n\nDirectors\n\n[edit]\n\nSalah Nasr (1958–1961)\n\nMuhammad Hisham al-Samman (1961–1963)\n\nAbd al-Karim al-Jundi (1966–1969)\n\nAdnan Babagh (1971–?)[5]\n\nAli Madani (1970s)[5]\n\nNazih Zirayr (?–1983)[20]\n\nFu'ad Absi (1983–1987)[20]\n\nMajid Sa'id (1987–1994)[20][21]\n\nInternal branch: Mohammed Nasif Kheirbek (?–1999)[21][22]\n\nBashir an-Najjar (1994–1998)[21]\n\nAli Houri (1998–2001)[14][15]\n\nDeputy Director: Mohammed Nasif Kheirbek (1999–June 2005)[2][14]\n\nInternal branch (251): Bahjat Suleiman (1999–June 2005)[23]\n\nExternal branch: Ayyad Mahmud (1999–?)[24]\n\nAli Hammoud (October–December 2001)[15]\n\nHisham Ikhtiyar (December 2001–June 2005)[25]\n\nAli Mamlouk (June 2005 – 2010), the European Union sanctioned him for \"violence against demonstrators during the Syrian uprising\".[25][26][27]\n\nDeputy Director: Hassan Khallouf (?–June 2004)[16][23]\n\nDeputy Director: Mohammed Dib Zaitoun (June 2004–2009)\n\nInternal branch (251): Fouad Nasif Kheir Bek (June 2005–2011)[16][23]\n\nInvestigations team: Anwar Raslan (2008–?)[28]\n\nDeputy Director: Jamil Hassan (2004–1 July 2009)[26][29]\n\nInformation branch: Zouheir Hamad (?–July 2010)[29]\n\nZouheir Hamad (July 2010–July 2012), the European Union sanctioned him for \"the use of violence across Syria and for intimidation and torture of protesters during the Syrian Civil War\".[26][27]\n\nDeputy Director: General Nazih (July 2010–July 2012), the European Union sanctioned him for \"being responsible for the use of violence across Syria and intimidation and torture of protestors during the Syrian uprising\".[2][27]\n\nInformation branch: Ghassan Khalil (July 2010–?), the European Union sanctioned him for \"being involved in repression and violence against the civilian population in Syria during the Syrian uprising\".[26][27][29]\n\nMohammed Dib Zaitoun (25 July 2012 – 7 July 2019)[2][30]\n\nDeputy Director: Zouheir Hamad (25 July 2012 – 7 July 2019)[2]\n\nInternal branch (251): Tawfiq Younes (2011-2016),[31] the European Union sanctioned him for \"being involved in violence against demonstrators during the Syrian uprisings\".[27]\n\nHossam Louka (7 July 2019 – present)[1]\n\nDeputy Director: Akram Ali Muhammad (7 July 2019 – 2021)\n\nInternal branch (251): Ahmed Al-Dib (2016 – present)[32]\n\nRegional Directors\n\n[edit]\n\nDamascus branch: Col.
