One of the prominent SSRs the GATA tetranucleotide repeat has preferentially accumulated in complex organisms. GATA repeats are particularly enriched on the human Y chromosome, and their non-random distribution and exclusive association with genes expressed during early development indicate their role in coordinated gene regulation. Here we show that GATA repeats have enhancer blocker activity in Drosophila and human cells. This enhancer blocker activity is seen in transgenic as well as native context of the enhancers at various developmental stages. These findings ascribe functional significance to SSRs and offer an explanation as to why SSRs, especially GATA, may have accumulated in complex organisms.\n\nPhotoexcited Graphene Metasurfaces: Significantly Enhanced and Tunable Magnetic Resonances\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nFan, Yuancheng; Shen, Nian -Hai; Zhang, Fuli\n\nArtificially constructed metamaterials or metasurfaces with tailored resonant elements provide a revolutionary platform for controlling light at the subwavelength scale.

The concentration of caproate increased to 21.1Â g/L upon the addition of biochar, which is the highest level of caproate reported for such a system to date when ethanol was used as electron donor. The addition of biochar created a tougher system with more stable microorganism community structure for chain elongation, in which no obvious inhibition by products or substrates was observed, moreover, the lag phase was reduced 2.3-fold compared to the system without biochar. These reinforcement effect of biochar are attributed to the enhanced conductivity due to the significant enrichment of functional microorganisms via the microbial network surrounding smaller biochar particles, and via the adsorption on the rough surfaces or pores of larger particles, which facilitated electron transfer. Higher amounts of extracellular polymer substances and higher conductivity induced by biochar could contribute to the reinforcement effect in chain elongation. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Anatomical evidence suggests that individual striatal neurons are unlikely to share their inputs from the cortex. Using a biologically realistic large-scale network model of striatum and cortico-striatal projections, we provide a functional interpretation of the special anatomical structure of these projections. Specifically, we show that weak pairwise correlation within the pool of inputs to individual striatal neurons enhances the saliency of signal representation in the striatum. By contrast, correlations among the input pools of different striatal neurons render the signal representation less distinct from background activity. We suggest that for the network architecture of the striatum, there is a preferred cortico-striatal input configuration for optimal signal representation. It is further enhanced by the low-rate asynchronous background activity in striatum, supported by the balance between feedforward and feedback inhibitions in the striatal network. Thus, an appropriate combination of rates and correlations in the striatal input sets the stage for action selection presumably implemented in the basal ganglia.

Although fatherhood-associated changes in such hormones and neuropeptides as prolactin, testosterone, glucocorticoids, vasopressin, and oxytocin have been characterised in only a small number of biparental rodents and primates, they appear to be more variable than corresponding changes in mothers, and experimental studies typically have not provided strong or consistent evidence that these endocrine shifts play causal roles in the activation of paternal care. Consequently, their functional significance remains unclear. We propose that endocrine changes in mammalian fathers may enable males to meet the species-specific demands of fatherhood by influencing diverse aspects of their behaviour and physiology, similar to many effects of hormones and neuropeptides in mothers. We review the evidence for such effects, focusing on recent studies investigating whether mammalian fathers in biparental species undergo systematic changes in 1) energetics and body composition, 2) neural plasticity, cognition, and sensory physiology, and 3) stress responsiveness and emotionality, all of which may be mediated by endocrine changes. The few published studies, based on a small number of rodent and primate species, suggest that hormonal and neuropeptide alterations in mammalian fathers might mediate shifts in paternal energy balance, body composition, and neural plasticity, but do not appear to have major effects on stress responsiveness or emotionality. Further research is needed on a wider variety of biparental mammals, under more naturalistic conditions, to more fully elucidate the functional significance of hormone and neuropeptide profiles of mammalian fatherhood and to clarify how fatherhood may trade off with, or perhaps enhance, aspects of organismal function in biparental mammals.

Recent studies identified a correlation between the orientation of CTCF-binding sites (CBSs) and chromatin loops. To test the functional significance of this observation, we combined CRISPR/Cas9-based genomic-DNA-fragment editing with chromosome-conformation-capture experiments to show that the location and relative orientations of CBSs determine the specificity of long-range chromatin looping in mammalian genomes, using protocadherin (Pcdh) and Î²-globin as model genes. Inversion of CBS elements within the Pcdh enhancer reconfigures the topology of chromatin loops between the distal enhancer and target promoters, and alters gene-expression patterns. Thus, although enhancers can function in an orientation-independent manner in reporter assays, in the native chromosome context the orientation of at least some enhancers carrying CBSs can determine both the architecture of topological chromatin domains and enhancer/promoter specificity. The findings reveal how 3D chromosome architecture can be encoded by genome sequence.

Microbial structure was significantly influenced by the treatment processes, shifting from Gammaproteobacteria and Betaproteobacteria in RW to Alphaproteobacteria in TW. Further functional analysis indicated the basic metabolic functions of microorganisms in TW did not vary considerably. However, protective functions, i.e. glutathione synthesis genes in 'oxidative stress' and 'detoxification' subsystems, significantly increased, revealing the surviving bacteria may have higher chlorine resistance. Similar results were also found in glutathione metabolism pathway, which identified the major reaction for glutathione synthesis and supported more genes for glutathione metabolism existed in TW. This metagenomic study largely enhanced our knowledge about the influences of treatment processes, especially chlorination, on bacterial community structure and protective functions (e.g. glutathione metabolism) in ecosystems of DWTPs.\n\nRadiofrequency treatment enhances the catalytic function of an immobilized nanobiohybrid catalyst\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSan, Boi Hoa; Ha, Eun-Ju; Paik, Hyun-Jong; Kim, Kyeong Kyu\n\n2014-05-01\n\nBiocatalysis, the use of enzymes in chemical transformation, has undergone intensive development for a wide range of applications. As such, maximizing the functionality of enzymes for biocatalysis is a major priority to enable industrial use. To date, many innovative technologies have been developed to address the future demand of enzymes for these purposes, but maximizing the catalytic activity of enzymes remains a challenge. In this study, we demonstrated that the functionality of a nanobiocatalyst could be enhanced by combining immobilization and radiofrequency (RF) treatment. Aminopeptidase PepA-encapsulating 2 nm platinum nanoparticles (PepA-PtNPs) with the catalytic activities of hydrolysis and hydrogenation were employed as multifunctional nanobiocatalysts. Immobilizing the nanobiocatalysts in a hydrogel using metal chelation significantly enhanced their functionalities, including catalytic power, thermal-stability, pH tolerance, organic solvent tolerance, and reusability. Most importantly, RF treatment of the hydrogel-immobilized PepA-PtNPs increased their catalytic power by 2.5 fold greater than the immobilized PepA. Our findings indicate that the catalytic activities and functionalities of PepA-PtNPs are greatly enhanced by the combination of hydrogel-immobilization and RF treatment. Based on our findings, we propose that RF treatment of nanobiohybrid catalysts immobilized on the bulk hydrogel represents a new strategy for achieving efficient biocatalysis.Biocatalysis, the use of enzymes in chemical transformation, has undergone intensive development for a wide range of applications.

The results show that L-acetylcarnitine markedly enhances functional muscle re-innervation, which on the contrary is unaffected by L-carnitine. The medial gastrocnemius muscle was denervated by cutting the nerve at the muscle entry point. After 20 days the sectioned nerve was resutured into the medial gastrocnemius muscle, and the extent of re-innervation was monitored 45 days later. L-acetylcarnitine-treated animals show significantly higher twitch and tetanic tensions of re-innervated muscle. Furthermore the results, obtained by analysing the twitch time to peak and tetanic contraction-relaxation times, suggest that L-acetylcarnitine mostly affects the functional re-innervation of slow motor units. The possible mechanisms by which L-acetylcarnitine facilitates such motor and nerve recovery are discussed.\n\nLongstanding Hyperthyroidism Is Associated with Normal or Enhanced Intrinsic Cardiomyocyte Function despite Decline in Global Cardiac Function\n\nPubMed Central\n\nRedetzke, Rebecca A.; Gerdes, A. Martin\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThyroid hormones (THs) play a pivotal role in cardiac homeostasis. TH imbalances alter cardiac performance and ultimately cause cardiac dysfunction. Although short-term hyperthyroidism typically leads to heightened left ventricular (LV) contractility and improved hemodynamic parameters, chronic hyperthyroidism is associated with deleterious cardiac consequences including increased risk of arrhythmia, impaired cardiac reserve and exercise capacity, myocardial remodeling, and occasionally heart failure. To evaluate the long-term consequences of chronic hyperthyroidism on LV remodeling and function, we examined LV isolated myocyte function, chamber function, and whole tissue remodeling in a hamster model. Three-month-old F1b hamsters were randomized to control or 10 months TH treatment (0.1% grade I desiccated TH). LV chamber remodeling and function was assessed by echocardiography at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 months of treatment. After 10 months, terminal cardiac function was assessed by echocardiography and LV hemodynamics. Hyperthyroid hamsters exhibited significant cardiac hypertrophy and deleterious cardiac remodeling characterized by myocyte lengthening, chamber dilatation, decreased relative wall thickness, increased wall stress, and increased LV interstitial fibrotic deposition. Importantly, hyperthyroid hamsters demonstrated significant LV systolic and diastolic dysfunction. Despite the aforementioned remodeling and global cardiac decline, individual isolated cardiac myocytes from chronically hyperthyroid hamsters had enhanced function when compared with myocytes from untreated age-matched controls. Thus, it appears that long-term hyperthyroidism may impair global LV function, at least in part by increasing interstitial ventricular fibrosis, in spite of normal or enhanced intrinsic cardiomyocyte function.

Functional diversity measures the range, abundance, and distribution of trait values in a community, and links changes in species composition with the consequences for ecosystem function. Improved understanding of the relationship between time since fire (TSF) and functional diversity is critical given that the frequency of both prescribed fire and wildfire is expected to increase. To address this knowledge gap, we examined responses of avian functional diversity to TSF and two direct measures of environmental heterogeneity, plant diversity, and structural heterogeneity. We surveyed birds across a 70-year chronosequence spanning four vegetation types in southeast Australia. Six bird functional traits were used to derive four functional diversity indices (richness, evenness, divergence, and dispersion) and the effects of TSF, plant diversity and structural heterogeneity on species richness and the functional diversity indices were examined using mixed models. We used a regression tree method to identify traits associated with species more common in young vegetation. Functional richness and dispersion were negatively associated with TSF in all vegetation types, suggesting that recent prescribed fire generates heterogeneous vegetation and provides greater opportunities for resource partitioning. Species richness was not significantly associated with TSF, and is probably an unreliable surrogate for functional diversity in fire-prone systems. A positive, relationship between functional evenness and structural heterogeneity was comnon to all vegetation types, suggesting that fine-scale (tens of meters) structural variation can enhance ecosystem function. Species more common in young vegetation were primarily linked by their specialist diets, indicating that ecosystem services such as seed dispersal and insect control\n\nFunctional and mechanistic diversity of distal transcription enhancers\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBulger, Michael; Groudine, Mark\n\n2013-01-01\n\nBiological differences among metazoans, and between cell types in a given organism, arise in large part due to differences in gene expression patterns. The sequencing of multiple metazoan genomes, coupled with recent advances in genome-wide analysis of histone modifications and transcription factor binding, has revealed that among regulatory DNA sequences, gene-distal enhancers appear to exhibit the greatest diversity and cell-type specificity. Moreover, such elements are emerging as important targets for mutations that can give rise to disease and to genetic variability that underlies evolutionary change. Studies of long-range interactions between distal genomic sequences in the nucleus indicate that enhancers are often important determinants of nuclear organization, contributing to a general model for enhancer function that involves direct enhancer-promoter contact. In a number of systems, however, mechanisms for enhancer function are emerging that do not fit solely within such a model, suggesting that enhancers as a class of DNA regulatory element may be functionally and mechanistically diverse.

The objective of these studies was to use an IL-15 super-agonist complex, ALT-803 (Altor BioScience Corporation), to enhance the function of both normal and ovarian cancer patient derived NK cells by increasing cytotoxicity and cytokine production. Methods NK cell function from normal donor peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and ovarian cancer patient ascites was assessed using flow cytometry and chromium release assays +/â ALT-803 stimulation. To evaluate the ability of ALT-803 to enhance NK cell function in vivo against ovarian cancer, we used a MA148-luc ovarian cancer NOD scid gamma (NSG) xenogeneic mouse model with transferred human NK cells. Results ALT-803 potently enhanced functionality of NK cells against all ovarian cancer cell lines with significant increases seen in CD107a, IFNÎ³ and TNFÎ± expression depending on target cell line. Function was also rescued in NK cells derived from ovarian cancer patient ascites. Finally, only animals treated with intraperitoneal ALT-803 displayed an NK dependent significant decrease in tumor. Conclusions ALT-803 enhances NK cell cytotoxicity against ovarian cancer in vitro and in vivo and is able to rescue functionality of NK cells derived from ovarian cancer patient ascites. These findings suggest that ALT-803 has the potential to enhance NK-cell-based immunotherapeutic approaches for the treatment of ovarian cancer.

One hundred thirty nine consecutive patients with suspected liver disease or liver tumor underwent gadoxetic-acid-enhanced MR imaging. MR imaging measurements during the hepatobiliary phase included biliary tract structure-to-muscle signal intensity ratio (SIR). These measurements were compared with Child-Pugh classification, end-stage liver disease (MELD) score, and aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index (APRI). The SIRs of cystic duct and common bile duct were significantly correlated with Child-Pugh classification (P=0.012 for cystic duct and P<0.0001 for common bile duct), MELD score (P=0.0016 and P=0.0033), and APRI (P=0.0022 and P=0.0015). The sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve were: (74%, 88%, 0.86) with the SIR of common bile duct for the detection of patients with Child-Pugh class B or C; (100%, 87%, 0.94) with the SIR of cystic duct for MELD score (>10); (65%, 76%, 0.70) with the SIR of common bile duct for APRI (>1.5). Gadoxetic-acid contrast enhancement of cystic duct and common bile duct could be used as biomarkers to assess liver function. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

This study seeks to examine the effects of cognitive enhancement therapy (CET) on fronto-temporal brain connectivity in a randomized controlled trial with individuals in the early course of schizophrenia. Method Stabilized, early course outpatients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (N = 41) were randomly assigned to CET (n = 25) or an active enriched supportive therapy (EST) control (n = 16) and treated for 2 years. Functional MRI data were collected annually, and pseudo resting-state functional connectivity analysis was used to examine differential changes in fronto-temporal connectivity between those treated with CET compared with EST. Results Individuals receiving CET evidenced significantly less functional connectivity loss between the resting-state network and the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex as well as significantly increased connectivity with the right insular cortex compared to EST (all corrected p < .01). These neural networks are involved in emotion processing and problem-solving. Increased connectivity with the right insula significantly mediated CET effects on improved emotion perception (zâ² = â1.96, p = .021), and increased connectivity with the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex mediated CET-related improvements in emotion regulation (zâ² = â1.71, p = .052). Conclusions These findings provide preliminary evidence that CET, a psychosocial cognitive remediation intervention, may enhance connectivity between frontal and temporal brain regions implicated in problem-solving and emotion processing in service of cognitive enhancement in schizophrenia.

Late enhancement, which was present in up to 50% of patients, was associated with increased left ventricular mass, the failure of a significant regression of hypertrophy during enzyme replacement therapy, and worse segmental myocardial function. Late enhancement may predict the effect of enzyme replacement therapy on left ventricular mass and cardiac function.\n\nSurface-Enhanced Raman and Surface-Enhanced Hyper-Raman Scattering of Thiol-Functionalized Carotene\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2016-01-01\n\nA thiol-modified carotene, 7â²-apo-7â²-(4-mercaptomethylphenyl)-Î²-carotene, was used to obtain nonresonant surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectra of carotene at an excitation wavelength of 1064 nm, which were compared with resonant SERS spectra at an excitation wavelength of 532 nm. These spectra and surface-enhanced hyper-Raman scattering (SEHRS) spectra of the functionalized carotene were compared with the spectra of nonmodified Î²-carotene. Using SERS, normal Raman, and SEHRS spectra, all obtained for the resonant case, the interaction of the carotene molecules with silver nanoparticles, as well as the influence of the resonance enhancement and the SERS enhancement on the spectra, were investigated. The interaction with the silver surface occurs for both functionalized and nonfunctionalized Î²-carotene, but only the stronger functionalization-induced interaction enables the acquisition of nonresonant SERS spectra of Î²-carotene at low concentrations. The resonant SEHRS and SERS spectra are very similar. Nevertheless, the SEHRS spectra contain additional bands of infrared-active modes of carotene. Increased contributions from bands that experience low resonance enhancement point to a strong interaction between silver nanoparticles and electronic levels of the molecules, thereby giving rise to a decrease in the resonance enhancement in SERS and SEHRS.

Studies in invertebrate model systems have suggested that these elements function as discrete and independent regulatory units, but the in vivo combinatorial properties of vertebrate enhancers remain poorly understood. To explore the modularity and regulatory autonomy of human developmental enhancers, we experimentally concatenated up to four enhancers from different genes and used a transgenic mouse assay to compare the in vivo activity of these compound elements with that of the single modules. In all of the six different combinations of elementsmoreÂ Â» tested, the reporter gene activity patterns were additive without signs of interference between the individual modules, indicating that regulatory specificity was maintained despite the presence of closely-positioned heterologous enhancers. Even in cases where two elements drove expression in close anatomical proximity, such as within neighboring subregions of the developing limb bud, the compound patterns did not show signs of cross-inhibition between individual elements or novel expression sites. These data indicate that human developmental enhancers are highly modular and functionally autonomous and suggest that genomic enhancer shuffling may have contributed to the evolution of complex gene expression patterns in vertebratesÂ«Â less\n\nFunctional gadoxetate disodium-enhanced MRI in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC).\n\nPubMed\n\nHinrichs, Heiko; Hinrichs, Jan B; Gutberlet, Marcel; Lenzen, Henrike; Raatschen, Hans-Juergen; Wacker, Frank; Ringe, Kristina I\n\n2016-04-01\n\nTo assess the value of variable flip angle-based T1 liver mapping on gadoxetate disodium-enhanced MRI in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) for evaluation of global and segmental liver function, and determine a possible correlation with disease severity. Sixty-one patients (19 female, 42 male; mean age 41 years) with PSC were included in this prospective study. T1 mapping was performed using a 3D-spoiled GRE sequence (flip angles 5Â°, 15Â°, 20Â°, 30Â°) before, 16 (HP1) and 132 min (HP2) after contrast injection. T1 values were measured and compared (Wilcoxon-Test) by placing ROIs in each liver segment. The mean reduction of T1 relaxation time at HP1 and HP2 was calculated and correlated with liver function tests (LFTs), MELD, Mayo Risk and Amsterdam Scores (Spearman correlation). Significant changes of T1 relaxation times between non-enhanced and gadoxetate disodium-enhanced MRI at HP1 and HP2 could be observed in all liver segments (pâ<â0.0001). A significant correlation of T1 reduction could be observed with LFTs, MELD and Mayo Risk Score (pâ<â0.05). T1 mapping of the liver using a variable flip angle-based sequence is a feasible technique to evaluate liver function on a global level, and may be extrapolated on a segmental level in patients with PSC. â¢ T1 mapping enables evaluation of global liver function in PSC. â¢ T1 relaxation time reduction correlates with the MELD and MayoRisk Score. â¢ Extrapolated, T1 mapping may allow for segmental evaluation of liver function.\n\nGap-mode enhancement on MoS2 probed by functionalized tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAlajlan, Abdulrahman M.; Voronine, Dmitri V.; Sinyukov, Alexander M.; Zhang, Zhenrong; Sokolov, Alexei V.; Scully, Marlan O.\n\n2016-09-01\n\nSurface enhancement of molecular spectroscopic signals has been widely used for sensing and nanoscale imaging. Because of the weak electromagnetic enhancement of Raman signals on semiconductors, it is motivating but challenging to study the electromagnetic effect separately from the chemical effects. We report tip-enhanced Raman scattering measurements on Au and bulk MoS2 substrates using a metallic tip functionalized with copper phthalocyanine molecules and demonstrate similar gap-mode enhancement on both substrates. We compare the experimental results with theoretical calculations to confirm the gap-mode enhancement on MoS2 using a well-established electrostatic model. The functionalized tip approach allows for suppressing the background and is ideal for separating electromagnetic and chemical enhancement mechanisms on various substrates. Our results may find a wide range of applications in MoS2-based devices, sensors, and metal-free nanoscale bio-imaging.\n\nEstradiol selectively enhances auditory function in avian forebrain neurons\n\nPubMed Central\n\nCaras, Melissa L.; OâBrien, Matthew; Brenowitz, Eliot A.; Rubel, Edwin W\n\n2012-01-01\n\nSex steroids modulate vertebrate sensory processing, but the impact of circulating hormone levels on forebrain function remains unclear. We tested the hypothesis that circulating sex steroids modulate single-unit responses in the avian telencephalic auditory nucleus, field L. We mimicked breeding or non-breeding conditions by manipulating plasma 17Î²-estradiol levels in wild-caught female Gambelâs white-crowned sparrows (Zonotrichia leucophrys gambelii). Extracellular responses of single neurons to tones and conspecific songs presented over a range of intensities revealed that estradiol selectively enhanced auditory function in cells that exhibited monotonic rate-level functions to pure tones. In these cells, estradiol treatment increased spontaneous and maximum evoked firing rates, increased pure tone response strengths and sensitivity, and expanded the range of intensities over which conspecific song stimuli elicited significant responses. Estradiol did not significantly alter the sensitivity or dynamic ranges of cells that exhibited non-monotonic rate-level functions. Notably, there was a robust correlation between plasma estradiol concentrations in individual birds and physiological response properties in monotonic, but not non-monotonic neurons. These findings demonstrate that functionally distinct classes of anatomically overlapping forebrain neurons are differentially regulated by sex steroid hormones in a dose-dependent manner.

In this study, we tackled whether derivatization of EGCG could result in enhancement of its effects on mitochondrial biogenesis. EGCG, EGCG peracetate (AcEGCG), and its 4â³- O-alkyl substituted congeners prepared by previously reported procedures were biologically evaluated. Interestingly, EGCG and AcEGCG were only marginally effective in inducing mitochondrial biogenesis, while AcEGCG congeners with an alkyl group at the 4â³- O position showed significantly increased biological activity compared to their parent compound. Among these series, 3f with a methyl-branched carbonate chain at the 4â³- O position of the AcEGCG scaffold showed the most enhancement in inducing mitochondrial biogenesis. Hepa1-6 cells treated with 3f exhibited increases in both mitochondrial mass (1.5 times) and relative mtDNA content to nDNA (1.5 times). As a mitochondrial biogenesis enhancer, 3f also increased expression levels of regulators for mitochondrial function, including PGC-1Î± (4.0 fold), p-AMPK (2.5 fold), SIRT1 (4.2 fold), ERRÎ± (1.8 fold), NRF-1 (1.6 fold), NRF-2 (1.7 fold), and mtTFA (1.6 folds). Investigation of oxidative phosphorylation by mitochondria in the presence of 3f revealed that 3f increased the NAD + /NADH ratio, the amount of cytochrome c, ATP synthesis, and oxygen consumption in Hepa1-6 cells by 2.2, 1.4, 1.5, and 2.1 fold, respectively. Taken together, these results warrant an extensive structure-activity relationship study for EGCG derivatives to develop novel mitochondrial biogenesis enhancers.\n\nEnhancing vestibular function in the elderly with imperceptible electrical stimulation.\n\nPubMed\n\nSerrador, Jorge M; Deegan, Brian M; Geraghty, Maria C; Wood, Scott J\n\n2018-01-10\n\nAge-related loss of vestibular function can result in decrements in gaze stabilization and increased fall risk in the elderly. This study was designed to see if low levels of electrical stochastic noise applied transcutaneously to the vestibular system can improve a gaze stabilization reflex in young and elderly subject groups. Ocular counter-rolling (OCR) using a video-based technique was obtained in 16 subjects during low frequency passive roll tilts. Consistent with previous studies, there was a significant reduction in OCR gains in the elderly compared to the young group. Imperceptible stochastic noise significantly increased OCR in the elderly (Mean 23%, CI: 17-35%). Increases in OCR gain were greatest for those with lowest baseline gain and were negligible in those with normal gain. Since stimulation was effective at low levels undetectable to subjects, stochastic noise may provide a new treatment alternative to enhance vestibular function, specifically otolith-ocular reflexes, in the elderly or patient populations with reduced otolith-ocular function.\n\nSignificantly enhanced thermal conductivity of indium arsenide nanowires via sulfur passivation.\n\nPubMed\n\nXiong, Yucheng; Tang, Hao; Wang, Xiaomeng; Zhao, Yang; Fu, Qiang; Yang, Juekuan; Xu, Dongyan\n\n2017-10-16\n\nIn this work, we experimentally investigated the effect of sulfur passivation on thermal transport in indium arsenide (InAs) nanowires. Our measurement results show that thermal conductivity can be enhanced by a ratio up to 159% by sulfur passivation. Current-voltage (I-V) measurements were performed on both unpassivated and S-passivated InAs nanowires to understand the mechanism of thermal conductivity enhancement. We observed a remarkable improvement in electrical conductivity upon sulfur passivation and a significant contribution of electrons to thermal conductivity, which account for the enhanced thermal conductivity of the S-passivated InAs nanowires.\n\nLearning a Foreign Language: A New Path to Enhancement of Cognitive Functions.\n\nPubMed\n\nShoghi Javan, Sara; Ghonsooly, Behzad\n\n2018-02-01\n\nThe complicated cognitive processes involved in natural (primary) bilingualism lead to significant cognitive development. Executive functions as a fundamental component of human cognition are deemed to be affected by language learning. To date, a large number of studies have investigated how natural (primary) bilingualism influences executive functions; however, the way acquired (secondary) bilingualism manipulates executive functions is poorly understood. To fill this gap, controlling for age, gender, IQ, and socio-economic status, the researchers compared 60 advanced learners of English as a foreign language (EFL) to 60 beginners on measures of executive functions involving Stroop, Wisconsin Card Sorting Task (WCST) and Wechsler's digit span tasks. The results suggested that mastering English as a foreign language causes considerable enhancement in two components of executive functions, namely cognitive flexibility and working memory. However, no significant difference was observed in inhibitory control between the advanced EFL learners and beginners.\n\nDeficiency of bone marrow beta3-integrin enhances non-functional neovascularization.\n\nPubMed\n\nWatson, Alan R; Pitchford, Simon C; Reynolds, Louise E; Direkze, Natalie; Brittan, Mairi; Alison, Malcolm R; Rankin, Sara; Wright, Nicholas A; Hodivala-Dilke, Kairbaan M\n\n2010-03-01\n\nbeta3-Integrin is a cell surface adhesion and signalling molecule important in the regulation of tumour angiogenesis. Mice with a global deficiency in beta3-integrin show increased pathological angiogenesis, most likely due to increased vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 expression on beta3-null endothelial cells. Here we transplanted beta3-null bone marrow (BM) into wild-type (WT) mice to dissect the role of BM beta3-integrin deficiency in pathological angiogenesis. Mice transplanted with beta3-null bone marrow show significantly enhanced angiogenesis in subcutaneous B16F0 melanoma and Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cell models and in B16F0 melanoma lung metastasis when compared with tumours grown in mice transplanted with WT bone marrow. The effect of bone marrow beta3-integrin deficiency was also assessed in the RIPTAg mouse model of pancreatic tumour growth. Again, angiogenesis in mice lacking BM beta3-integrin was enhanced. However, tumour weight between the groups was not significantly altered, suggesting that the enhanced blood vessel density in the mice transplanted with beta3-null bone marrow was not functional. Indeed, we demonstrate that in mice transplanted with beta3-null bone marrow a significant proportion of tumour blood vessels are non-functional when compared with tumour blood vessels in WT-transplanted controls. Furthermore, beta3-null-transplanted mice showed an increased angiogenic response to VEGF in vivo when compared with WT-transplanted animals. BM beta3-integrin deficiency affects the mobilization of progenitor cells to the peripheral circulation. We show that VEGF-induced mobilization of endothelial progenitor cells is enhanced in mice transplanted with beta3-null bone marrow when compared with WT-transplanted controls, suggesting a possible mechanism underlying the increased blood vessel density seen in beta3-null-transplanted mice. In conclusion, although BM beta3-integrin is not required for pathological angiogenesis, our\n\nEnhanced spectral domain optical coherence tomography for pathological and functional studies\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nYuan, Zhijia\n\nOptical coherence tomography (OCT) is a novel technique that enables noninvasive or minimally invasive, cross-sectional imaging of biological tissue at sub-10mum spatial resolution and up to 2-3mm imaging depth. Numerous technological advances have emerged in recent years that have shown great potential to develop OCT into a powerful imaging and diagnostic tools. In particular, the implementation of Fourier-domain OCT (FDOCT) is a major step forward that leads to greatly improved imaging rate and image fidelity of OCT. This dissertation summarizes the work that focuses on enhancing the performances and functionalities of spectral radar based FDOCT (SDOCT) for pathological and functional applications. More specifically, chapters 1-4 emphasize on the development of SDOCT and its utility in pathological studies, including cancer diagnosis. The principle of SDOCT is first briefly outlined, followed by the design of our bench-top SDOCT systems with emphasis on spectral linear interpolation, calibration and system dispersion compensation. For ultrahigh-resolution SDOCT, time-lapse image registration and frame averaging is introduced to effectively reduce speckle noise and uncover subcellular details, showing great promise for enhancing the diagnosis of carcinoma in situ. To overcome the image depth limitation of OCT, a dual-modal imaging method combing SDOCT with high-frequency ultrasound is proposed and examined in animal cancer models to enhance the sensitivity and staging capabilities for bladder cancer diagnosis. Chapters 5-7 summarize the work on developing Doppler SDOCT for functional studies. Digital-frequency-ramping OCT (DFR-OCT) is developed in the study, which has demonstrated the ability to significantly improve the signal-to-noise ratio and thus sensitivity for retrieving subsurface blood flow imaging. New DFR algorithms and imaging processing methods are discussed to further enhance cortical CBF imaging. Applications of DFR-OCT for brain functional studies\n\nClinical significance of quantitative analysis of facial nerve enhancement on MRI in Bell's palsy.\n\nPubMed\n\nSong, Mee Hyun; Kim, Jinna; Jeon, Ju Hyun; Cho, Chang Il; Yoo, Eun Hye; Lee, Won-Sang; Lee, Ho-Ki\n\n2008-11-01\n\nQuantitative analysis of the facial nerve on the lesion side as well as the normal side, which allowed for more accurate measurement of facial nerve enhancement in patients with facial palsy, showed statistically significant correlation with the initial severity of facial nerve inflammation, although little prognostic significance was shown. This study investigated the clinical significance of quantitative measurement of facial nerve enhancement in patients with Bell's palsy by analyzing the enhancement pattern and correlating MRI findings with initial severity of facial palsy and clinical outcome. Facial nerve enhancement was measured quantitatively by using the region of interest on pre- and postcontrast T1-weighted images in 44 patients diagnosed with Bell's palsy. The signal intensity increase on the lesion side was first compared with that of the contralateral side and then correlated with the initial degree of facial palsy and prognosis. The lesion side showed significantly higher signal intensity increase compared with the normal side in all of the segments except for the mastoid segment. Signal intensity increase at the internal auditory canal and labyrinthine segments showed correlation with the initial degree of facial palsy but no significant difference was found between different prognostic groups.\n\nPyruvate incubation enhances glycogen stores and sustains neuronal function during subsequent glucose deprivation.\n\nPubMed\n\nShetty, Pavan K; Sadgrove, Matthew P; Galeffi, Francesca; Turner, Dennis A\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThe use of energy substrates, such as lactate and pyruvate, has been shown to improve synaptic function when administered during glucose deprivation. In the present study, we investigated whether prolonged incubation with monocarboxylate (pyruvate or lactate) prior rather than during glucose deprivation can also sustain synaptic and metabolic function. Pyruvate pre-incubation(3-4h) significantly prolonged (>25 min) the tolerance of rat hippocampal slices to delayed glucose deprivation compared to control and lactate pre-incubated slices, as revealed by field excitatory post synaptic potentials (fEPSPs); pre-incubation with pyruvate also reduced the marked decrease in NAD(P)H fluorescence resulting from glucose deprivation. Moreover, pyruvate exposure led to the enhancement of glycogen stores with time, compared to glucose alone (12 Î¼mol/g tissue at 4h vs. 3.5 Î¼mol/g tissue). Prolonged resistance to glucose deprivation following exogenous pyruvate incubation was prevented by glycogenolysis inhibitors, suggesting that enhanced glycogen mediates the delay in synaptic activity failure. The application of an adenosine A1 receptor antagonist enhanced glycogen utilization and prolonged the time to synaptic failure, further confirming this hypothesis of the importance of glycogen. Moreover, tissue levels of ATP were also significantly maintained during glucose deprivation in pyruvate pretreated slices compared to control and lactate. In summary, these experiments indicate that pyruvate exposure prior to glucose deprivation significantly increased the energy buffering capacity of hippocampal slices, particularly by enhancing internal glycogen stores, delaying synaptic failure during glucose deprivation by maintaining ATP levels, and minimizing the decrease in the levels of NAD(P)H.

Kendall; Dall'Acqua, William F.; Xiao, Xiaodong\n\n2017-01-01\n\nABSTRACT Antibodies carry out a plethora of functions through their crystallizable fragment (Fc) regions, which can be naturally tuned by the adoption of several isotypes and post-translational modifications. Protein engineering enables further Fc function modulations through modifications of the interactions between the Fc and its functional partners, including FcÎ³R, FcRn, complement complex, and additions of auxiliary functional units. Due to the many functions embedded within the confinement of an Fc, a suitable balance must be maintained for a therapeutic antibody to be effective and safe. The outcome of any Fc engineering depends on the interplay among all the effector molecules involved. In this report, we assessed the effects of Fc multiplication (or tandem Fc) on antibody functions. Using IgG1 as a test case, we found that, depending on the specifically designed linker, Fc multiplication led to differentially folded, stable molecules with unique pharmacokinetic profiles. Interestingly, the variants with 3 copies of Fc improved in vitro opsonophagocytic killing activity and displayed significantly improved protective efficacies in a Klebsiella pneumoniae mouse therapeutic model despite faster clearance compared with its IgG1 counterpart. There was no adverse effect observed or pro-inflammatory cytokine release when the Fc variants were administered to animals. We further elucidated that enhanced binding to various effector molecules by IgG-3Fc created a âsinkâ leading to the rapid clearance of the 3Fc variants, and identified the increased FcRn binding as one strategy to facilitate âsinkâ escape. These findings reveal new opportunities for novel Fc engineering to further expand our abilities to manipulate and improve antibody therapeutics.

Homogeneous distributions of boron nitride nanoflakes in a polymer matrix, preserving intrinsic material properties of boron nitride nanoflakes, is the key to successful composite applications. Here, a method is suggested to obtain noncovalently functionalized BNNFs with 1-pyrenebutyric acid (PBA) molecules and to synthesize epoxy-BNNF nanocomposites with enhanced mechanical properties. The incorporation of noncovalently functionalized BNNFs into epoxy resin yields an elastic modulus of 3.34 GPa, and 71.9 MPa ultimate tensile strength at 0.3 wt%. The toughening enhancement is as high as 107% compared to the value of neat epoxy. The creep strain and the creep compliance of the noncovalently functionalized BNNF nanocomposite is significantly less than the neat epoxy and the nonfunctionalized BNNF nanocomposite. Noncovalent functionalization of BNNFs is effective to increase mechanical properties by strong affinity between the fillers and the matrix. Copyright Â© 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

B.\n\n1992-01-01\n\nAs people age, so do their photoreceptors; many photoreceptors in central vision stop functioning when a person reaches their late sixties or early seventies. Low vision observers with losses in central vision, those with age-related maculopathies, were studied. Low vision observers no longer see high spatial frequencies, being unable to resolve fine edge detail. We developed image enhancement filters to compensate for the low vision observer's losses in contrast sensitivity to intermediate and high spatial frequencies. The filters work by boosting the amplitude of the less visible intermediate spatial frequencies. The lower spatial frequencies. These image enhancement filters not only reduce the magnification needed for reading by up to 70 percent, but they also increase the observer's reading speed by 2-4 times. A summary of this research is presented.\n\nDecoding transcriptional enhancers: Evolving from annotation to functional interpretation\n\nPubMed Central\n\nEngel, Krysta L.; Mackiewicz, Mark; Hardigan, Andrew A.; Myers, Richard M.; Savic, Daniel\n\n2016-01-01\n\nDeciphering the intricate molecular processes that orchestrate the spatial and temporal regulation of genes has become an increasingly major focus of biological research. The differential expression of genes by diverse cell types with a common genome is a hallmark of complex cellular functions, as well as the basis for multicellular life. Importantly, a more coherent understanding of gene regulation is critical for defining developmental processes, evolutionary principles and disease etiologies. Here we present our current understanding of gene regulation by focusing on the role of enhancer elements in these complex processes. Although functional genomic methods have provided considerable advances to our understanding of gene regulation, these assays, which are usually performed on a genome-wide scale, typically provide correlative observations that lack functional interpretation. Recent innovations in genome editing technologies have placed gene regulatory studies at an exciting crossroads, as systematic, functional evaluation of enhancers and other transcriptional regulatory elements can now be performed in a coordinated, high-throughput manner across the entire genome. This review provides insights on transcriptional enhancer function, their role in development and disease, and catalogues experimental tools commonly used to study these elements. Additionally, we discuss the crucial role of novel techniques in deciphering the complex gene regulatory landscape and how these studies will shape future research.

Various chemical and mechanical stimuli have been used to enhance the functional properties of engineered musculoskeletal tissues. Recently, Ca2+-modulating agents have been used to enhance matrix synthesis and biomechanical properties of engineered cartilage. The objective of this study was to determine whether other known Ca2+ modulators, digoxin and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), can be employed as novel stimuli to increase collagen synthesis and functional properties of engineered cartilage. Neocartilage constructs were formed by scaffold-free self-assembling of primary bovine articular chondrocytes. Digoxin, ATP, or both agents were added to the culture medium for 1âh/day on days 10â14. After 4 weeks of culture, neocartilage properties were assessed for gross morphology, biochemical composition, and biomechanical properties. Digoxin and ATP were found to increase neocartilage collagen content by 52â110% over untreated controls, while maintaining proteoglycan content near native tissue values. Furthermore, digoxin and ATP increased the tensile modulus by 280% and 180%, respectively, while the application of both agents increased the modulus by 380%. The trends in tensile properties were found to correlate with the amount of collagen cross-linking. Live Ca2+ imaging experiments revealed that both digoxin and ATP were able to increase Ca2+ oscillations in monolayer-cultured chondrocytes. This study provides a novel approach toward directing neocartilage maturation and enhancing its functional properties using novel Ca2+ modulators.

J.; Nasif, Sofia; Yamashita, Miho; LÃ³pez-Leal, Rodrigo; Meece, Kana; Sampath, Harini; Mercer, Aaron J.; Wardlaw, Sharon L.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nCell-specific expression of many genes is conveyed by multiple enhancers, with each individual enhancer controlling a particular expression domain. In contrast, multiple enhancers drive similar expression patterns of some genes involved in embryonic development, suggesting regulatory redundancy. Work in Drosophila has indicated that functionally overlapping enhancers canalize development by buffering gene expression against environmental and genetic disturbances. However, little is known about regulatory redundancy in vertebrates and in genes mainly expressed during adulthood. Here we study nPE1 and nPE2, two phylogenetically conserved mammalian enhancers that drive expression of the proopiomelanocortin gene (Pomc) to the same set of hypothalamic neurons. The simultaneous deletion of both enhancers abolished Pomc expression at all ages and induced a profound metabolic dysfunction including early-onset extreme obesity. Targeted inactivation of either nPE1 or nPE2 led to very low levels of Pomc expression during early embryonic development indicating that both enhancers function synergistically. In adult mice, however, Pomc expression is controlled additively by both enhancers, with nPE1 being responsible for â¼80% and nPE2 for â¼20% of Pomc transcription. Consequently, nPE1 knockout mice exhibit mild obesity whereas nPE2-deficient mice maintain a normal body weight. These results suggest that nPE2-driven Pomc expression is compensated by nPE1 at later stages of development, essentially rescuing the earlier phenotype of nPE2 deficiency. Together, these results reveal that cooperative interactions between the enhancers confer robustness of Pomc expression against gene regulatory disturbances and preclude deleterious metabolic phenotypes caused by Pomc deficiency in adulthood. Thus, our study demonstrates that enhancer redundancy can be used by genes that control adult physiology in mammals and underlines the potential significance of regulatory sequence mutations in\n\nVirtual reality training to enhance behavior and cognitive function among children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: brief report.\n\nPubMed\n\nShema-Shiratzky, Shirley; Brozgol, Marina; Cornejo-Thumm, Pablo; Geva-Dayan, Karen; Rotstein, Michael; Leitner, Yael; Hausdorff, Jeffrey M; Mirelman, Anat\n\n2018-05-17\n\nTo examine the feasibility and efficacy of a combined motor-cognitive training using virtual reality to enhance behavior, cognitive function and dual-tasking in children with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Fourteen non-medicated school-aged children with ADHD, received 18 training sessions during 6Â weeks. Training included walking on a treadmill while negotiating virtual obstacles. Behavioral symptoms, cognition and gait were tested before and after the training and at 6-weeks follow-up. Based on parental report, there was a significant improvement in children's social problems and psychosomatic behavior after the training. Executive function and memory were improved post-training while attention was unchanged. Gait regularity significantly increased during dual-task walking. Long-term training effects were maintained in memory and executive function. Treadmill-training augmented with virtual-reality is feasible and may be an effective treatment to enhance behavior, cognitive function and dual-tasking in children with ADHD.\n\nPreserving and enhancing the functionality of highways in Texas : workshop.\n\nDOT National Transportation Integrated Search\n\n2010-01-01\n\nWorkshop Objectives: To promote the importance of Highway Functionality To review functionality in highway lifecycle To provide how to materials to preserve, maintain, and enhance functionality To promote coordination between Tx...\n\nPharmacological Enhancement of Memory and Executive Functioning in Laboratory Animals\n\nPubMed Central\n\nFloresco, Stan B; Jentsch, James D\n\n2011-01-01\n\nInvestigating how different pharmacological compounds may enhance learning, memory, and higher-order cognitive functions in laboratory animals is the first critical step toward the development of cognitive enhancers that may be used to ameliorate impairments in these functions in patients suffering from neuropsychiatric disorders. Rather than focus on one aspect of cognition, or class of drug, in this review we provide a broad overview of how distinct classes of pharmacological compounds may enhance different types of memory and executive functioning, particularly those mediated by the prefrontal cortex. These include recognition memory, attention, working memory, and different components of behavioral flexibility. A key emphasis is placed on comparing and contrasting the effects of certain drugs on different cognitive and mnemonic functions, highlighting methodological issues associated with this type of research, tasks used to investigate these functions, and avenues for future research. Viewed collectively, studies of the neuropharmacological basis of cognition in rodents and non-human primates have identified targets that will hopefully open new avenues for the treatment of cognitive disabilities in persons affected by mental disorders.

It was recently reported that phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) is expressed in human adipose tissue. In addition, PDE5 inhibitors have been shown to improve insulin sensitivity in humans. However, the mechanism underlying the role of PDE5 inhibitors as an insulin sensitizer remains largely unknown. The present study was undertaken to investigate the role of the PDE5 inhibitor udenafil in insulin signaling in adipocytes and whether this is mediated through the regulation of mitochondrial function. To study the mechanism underlying the insulin sensitizing action of PDE5 inhibitors, we evaluated quantitative changes in protein or mRNA levels of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) complex, oxygen consumption rate (OCR), and fatty acid oxidation with varying udenafil concentrations in 3T3-L1 cells. Our cell study suggested that udenafil enhanced the insulin signaling pathway in 3T3-L1 cells. Following udenafil treatment, basal mitochondrial OCR, maximal OxPhos capacity, and OxPhos gene expression significantly increased. Finally, we examined whether udenafil can affect the fatty acid oxidation process. Treatment of 3T3-L1 cells with udenafil (10 and 20Â Î¼M) significantly increased fatty acid oxidation rate in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1Î±) significantly increased. We demonstrated that the PDE5 inhibitor udenafil enhances insulin sensitivity by improving mitochondrial function in 3T3-L1 cells. This might be the mechanism underlying the PDE5 inhibitor-enhanced insulin signaling in adipocytes. This also suggests that udenafil may provide benefit in the treatment of type 2 diabetes and other related cardiovascular diseases. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Inc.

What is their functional significance?\n\nPubMed\n\nDiBona, G F\n\n1990-06-01\n\nBiochemical and morphological studies indicate that there are nerves within the kidney that contain dopamine and that various structures within the kidney contain dopamine receptors. However, the functional significance of these renal dopamine containing nerves in relation to renal dopamine receptors is unknown. The functional significance could be defined by demonstrating that an alteration in one or more renal functions occurring in response to reflex or electrical activation of efferent renal nerves is dependent on release of dopamine as the neurotransmitter from the renal nerve terminals acting on renal dopamine receptors. Thus, the hypothesis becomes: reflex or electrical activation of efferent renal nerves causes alterations in renal function (eg, renal blood flow, water and solute handling) that are inhibited by specific and selective dopamine receptor antagonists. As reviewed herein, the published experimental data do not support the hypothesis. Therefore, the view that alterations in one or more renal functions occurring in response to reflex or electrical activation of efferent renal nerves are dependent on release of dopamine as the neurotransmitter from the renal nerve terminals acting on renal dopamine receptors remains unproven.\n\nIntake of red wine increases the number and functional capacity of circulating endothelial progenitor cells by enhancing nitric oxide bioavailability.\n\nPubMed\n\nHuang, Po-Hsun; Chen, Yung-Hsiang; Tsai, Hsiao-Ya; Chen, Jia-Shiong; Wu, Tao-Cheng; Lin, Feng-Yen; Sata, Masataka; Chen, Jaw-Wen; Lin, Shing-Jong\n\n2010-04-01\n\nRed wine (RW) consumption has been associated with a reduction of cardiovascular events, but limited data are available on potential mediating mechanisms. This study tested the hypothesis that intake of RW may promote the circulating endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) level and function through enhancement of nitric oxide bioavailability. Eighty healthy, young subjects were randomized and assigned to consume water (100 mL), RW (100 mL), beer (250 mL), or vodka (30 mL) daily for 3 weeks. Flow cytometry was used to quantify circulating EPC numbers, and in vitro assays were used to evaluate EPC functions. After RW ingestion, endothelial function determined by flow-mediated vasodilation was significantly enhanced; however, it remained unchanged after water, beer, or vodka intake. There were significantly increased numbers of circulating EPC (defined as KDR(+)CD133(+), CD34(+)CD133(+), CD34(+)KDR(+)) and EPC colony-forming units only in the RW group (all P<0.05). Only RW ingestion significantly enhanced plasma levels of nitric oxide and decreased asymmetrical dimethylarginine (both P<0.01). Incubation of EPC with RW (but not beer or ethanol) and resveratrol in vitro attenuated tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced EPC senescence and improved tumor necrosis factor-alpha-suppressed EPC functions and tube formation. Incubation with nitric oxide donor sodium nitroprusside significantly ameliorated the inhibition of tumor necrosis factor-alpha on EPC proliferation, but incubation with endothelial nitric oxide synthase inhibitor l-NAME and PI3K inhibitor markedly attenuated the effect of RW on EPC proliferation. The intake of RW significantly enhanced circulating EPC levels and improved EPC functions by modifying nitric oxide bioavailability. These findings may help explain the beneficial effects of RW on the cardiovascular system. This study demonstrated that a moderate intake of RW can enhance circulating levels of EPC in healthy subjects by increasing nitric oxide\n\nDecoding transcriptional enhancers: Evolving from annotation to functional interpretation.\n\nPubMed\n\nEngel, Krysta L; Mackiewicz, Mark; Hardigan, Andrew A; Myers, Richard M; Savic, Daniel\n\n2016-09-01\n\nDeciphering the intricate molecular processes that orchestrate the spatial and temporal regulation of genes has become an increasingly major focus of biological research.

Several studies have suggested that some promoters might have enhancer functions. However, the extent of this type of promoters and whether they actually function to regulate the expression of distal genes have remained elusive. Here, by exploiting a high-throughput enhancer reporter assay, we unravel a set of mammalian promoters displaying enhancer activity. These promoters have distinct genomic and epigenomic features and frequently interact with other gene promoters. Extensive CRISPR-Cas9 genomic manipulation demonstrated the involvement of these promoters in the cis regulation of expression of distal genes in their natural loci. Our results have important implications for the understanding of complex gene regulation in normal development and disease.\n\nFunctional significance of cardiac reinnervation in heart transplant recipients.\n\nPubMed\n\nSchwaiblmair, M; von Scheidt, W; Uberfuhr, P; Ziegler, S; Schwaiger, M; Reichart, B; Vogelmeier, C\n\n1999-09-01\n\nThere is accumulating evidence of structural sympathetic reinnervation after human cardiac transplantation. However, the functional significance of reinnervation in terms of exercise capacity has not been established as yet; we therefore investigated the influence of reinnervation on cardiopulmonary exercise testing. After orthotopic heart transplantation 35 patients (mean age, 49.1 +/- 8.4 years) underwent positron emission tomography with scintigraphically measured uptake of C11-hydroxyephedrine (HED), lung function testing, and cardiopulmonary exercise testing. Two groups were defined based on scintigraphic findings, indicating a denervated group (n = 15) with a HED uptake of 5.45%/min and a reinnervated group (n = 20) with a HED uptake of 10.59%/min. The two study groups did not show significant differences with regard to anthropometric data, number of rejection episodes, preoperative hemodynamics, and postoperative lung function data. The reinnervated group had a significant longer time interval from transplantation (1625 +/- 1069 versus 800 +/- 1316 days, p < .05). In transplant recipients with reinnervation, heart rate at maximum exercise (137 +/- 15 versus 120 +/- 20 beats/min, p = .012), peak oxygen uptake (21.0 +/- 4 versus 16.1 +/- 5 mL/min/kg, p = .006), peak oxygen pulse (12.4 +/- 2.9 versus 10.2 +/- 2.7 mL/min/beat, p = .031), and anaerobic threshold (11.2 +/- 1.8 versus 9.5 +/- 2.1 mL/min, p = .046) were significantly increased in comparison to denervated transplant recipients. Additionally, a decreased functional dead space ventilation (0.24 +/- 0.05 versus 0.30 +/- 0.05, p = .004) was observed in the reinnervated group. Our study results support the hypothesis that partial sympathetic reinnervation after cardiac transplantation is of functional significance. Sympathetic reinnervation enables an increased peak oxygen uptake. This is most probably due to partial restoration of the chronotropic and inotropic competence of the heart as well as an\n\nCholinergic enhancement reduces functional connectivity and BOLD variability in visual extrastriate cortex during selective attention\n\nPubMed Central\n\nRicciardi, Emiliano; Handjaras, Giacomo; Bernardi, Giulio; Pietrini, Pietro; Furey, Maura L.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nEnhancing cholinergic function improves performance on various cognitive tasks and alters neural responses in task specific brain regions. Previous findings by our group strongly suggested that the changes in neural activity observed during increased cholinergic function may reflect an increase in neural efficiency that leads to improved task performance. The current study was designed to assess the effects of cholinergic enhancement on regional brain connectivity and BOLD signal variability. Nine subjects participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study. Following an infusion of physostigmine (1mg/hr) or placebo, echo-planar imaging (EPI) was conducted as participants performed a selective attention task. During the task, two images comprised of superimposed pictures of faces and houses were presented. Subjects were instructed periodically to shift their attention from one stimulus component to the other and to perform a matching task using hand held response buttons. A control condition included phase-scrambled images of superimposed faces and houses that were presented in the same temporal and spatial manner as the attention task; participants were instructed to perform a matching task. Cholinergic enhancement improved performance during the selective attention task, with no change during the control task. Functional connectivity analyses showed that the strength of connectivity between ventral visual processing areas and task-related occipital, parietal and prefrontal regions was reduced significantly during cholinergic enhancement, exclusively during the selective attention task. Cholinergic enhancement also reduced BOLD signal temporal variability relative to placebo throughout temporal and occipital visual processing areas, again during the selective attention task only. Together with the observed behavioral improvement, the decreases in connectivity strength throughout task-relevant regions and\n\nArchitectural and functional commonalities between enhancers and promoters\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKim, Tae-Kyung; Shiekhattar, Ramin\n\n2015-01-01\n\nSummary With the explosion of genome-wide studies of regulated transcription, it has become clear that traditional definitions of enhancers and promoters need to be revisited. These control elements can now be characterized in terms of their local and regional architecture, their regulatory components including histone modifications and associated binding factors and their functional contribution to transcription. This review discusses unifying themes between promoters and enhancers in transcriptional regulatory mechanisms.

Despite the emphasis of the enhanced therapy approach on continued use of the arm in everyday life, the advantage seen for some patients with enhanced therapy at six months after stroke had diminished to a non-significant trend by one year. This was due to some late improvement in the conventional therapy group whereas the enhanced therapy group remained static or fell back slightly. It is recommended that trials should be conducted comparing very intensive therapy for the arm with controls without treatment. This would provide a model of the effects of therapy on intrinsic neural recovery that would be relevant to all areas of neurological rehabilitation.

We investigated the physiological substrates of this experience-enabled form of adult cortical plasticity by measuring visual behavior and visually evoked potentials (VEPs) in binocular visual cortex of the same mice before, during, and after MD. MD on its own potentiated VEPs contralateral to the NDE during MD and shifted ocular dominance (OD) in favor of the NDE in both hemispheres. Whereas we expected visuomotor experience during MD to augment these effects, instead enhanced responses contralateral to the NDE, and the OD shift ipsilateral to the NDE were attenuated. However, in the same animals, we measured NMDA receptor-dependent VEP potentiation ipsilateral to the NDE during MD, which persisted after MD. The results indicate that visuomotor experience during adult MD leads to enduring enhancement of behavioral function, not simply by amplifying MD-induced changes in cortical OD, but through an independent process of increasing NDE drive in ipsilateral visual cortex. Because the plasticity is resident in the mature visual cortex and selectively effects gain of visual behavior through experiential means, it may have the therapeutic potential to target and non-invasively treat eye- or visual-field-specific cortical impairment.\n\nEffects of functional remediation on neurocognitively impaired bipolar patients: enhancement of verbal memory.\n\nPubMed\n\nBonnin, C M; Reinares, M; MartÃ­nez-ArÃ¡n, A; BalanzÃ¡-MartÃ­nez, V; Sole, B; Torrent, C; TabarÃ©s-Seisdedos, R; GarcÃ­a-Portilla, M P; IbÃ¡Ã±ez, A; Amann, B L; Arango, C; Ayuso-Mateos, J L; Crespo, J M; GonzÃ¡lez-Pinto, A; Colom, F; Vieta, E\n\n2016-01-01\n\nFunctional remediation is a novel intervention with demonstrated efficacy at improving functional outcome in euthymic bipolar patients. However, in a previous trial no significant changes in neurocognitive measures were detected. The objective of the present analysis was to test the efficacy of this therapy in the enhancement of neuropsychological functions in a subgroup of neurocognitively impaired bipolar patients. A total of 188 out of 239 DSM-IV euthymic bipolar patients performing below two standard deviations from the mean of normative data in any neurocognitive test were included in this subanalysis. Repeated-measures analyses of variance were conducted to assess the impact of the treatment arms [functional remediation, psychoeducation, or treatment as usual (TAU)] on participants' neurocognitive and functional outcomes in the subgroup of neurocognitively impaired patients. Patients receiving functional remediation (n = 56) showed an improvement on delayed free recall when compared with the TAU (n = 63) and psychoeducation (n = 69) groups as shown by the group Ã time interaction at 6-month follow-up [F 2,158 = 3.37, degrees of freedom (df) = 2, p = 0.037]. However, Tukey post-hoc analyses revealed that functional remediation was only superior when compared with TAU (p = 0.04), but not with psychoeducation (p = 0.10). Finally, the patients in the functional remediation group also benefited from the treatment in terms of functional outcome (F 2,158 = 4.26, df = 2, p = 0.016). Functional remediation is effective at improving verbal memory and psychosocial functioning in a sample of neurocognitively impaired bipolar patients at 6-month follow-up. Neurocognitive enhancement may be one of the active ingredients of this novel intervention, and, specifically, verbal memory appears to be the most sensitive function that improves with functional remediation.\n\nGenome-wide compendium and functional assessment of in vivo heart enhancers\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nDickel, Diane E.; Barozzi, Iros; Zhu, Yiwen\n\nWhole-genome sequencing is identifying growing numbers of non-coding variants in human disease studies, but the lack of accurate functional annotations prevents their interpretation.

Besides ideal diode behaviors and the gate-tunable current rectification, the thermoelectric power is significantly enhanced in these junctions by more than three orders of magnitude compared with single-phase multilayer In 2 Se 3 , with the thermoelectric figure-of-merit approaching â¼1 at room temperature. Our results suggest that these significantly improved thermoelectric properties are not due to the 2D quantum confinement effects but instead are a consequence of the Schottky barrier at the junction interface, which leads to hot carrier transport and shifts the balance between thermally and field-driven currents. This \"bulk\" effect extends the advantages of van der Waals materials beyond the few-layer limit. Adopting such an approach of using energy barriers between van der Waals materials, where the interface states are minimal, is expected to enhance the thermoelectric performance in other 2D materials as well.\n\nVision-Enhancing Interventions in Nursing Home Residents and Their Short-Term Impact on Physical and Cognitive Function\n\nPubMed Central\n\nElliott, Amanda F.; McGwin, Gerald; Owsley, Cynthia\n\n2009-01-01\n\nOBJECTIVE To evaluate the effect of vision-enhancing interventions (i.e., cataract surgery or refractive error correction) on physical function and cognitive status in nursing home residents. DESIGN Longitudinal cohort study. SETTING Seventeen nursing homes in Birmingham, AL. PARTICIPANTS A total of 187 English-speaking older adults (>55 years of age). INTERVENTION Participants took part in one of two vision-enhancing interventions: cataract surgery or refractive error correction. Each group was compared against a control group (persons eligible for but who declined cataract surgery, or who received delayed correction of refractive error). MEASUREMENTS Physical function (i.e., ability to perform activities of daily living and mobility) was assessed with a series of self-report and certified nursing assistant ratings at baseline and at 2 months for the refractive error correction group, and at 4 months for the cataract surgery group. The Mini Mental State Exam was also administered. RESULTS No significant differences existed within or between groups from baseline to follow-up on any of the measures of physical function. Mental status scores significantly declined from baseline to follow-up for both the immediate (p= 0.05) and delayed (p< 0.02) refractive error correction groups and for the cataract surgery control group (p= 0.05). CONCLUSION Vision-enhancing interventions did not lead to short-term improvements in physical functioning or cognitive status in this sample of elderly nursing home residents.

The design attempted to tease apart 2 important aspects of children's exercise by examining the separate and combined effects of acute physical activity and cognitive engagement on an aspect of children's executive functioning. In a 2 Ã 2 within-subject experimental design, children (N = 33, 6 to 10 years old) completed activities that varied systematically in both physical activity (physically active video games versus sedentary video activities) and cognitive engagement (challenging and interactive video games versus repetitive video activities). Cognitive functioning, including executive function, was assessed after each activity by a modified flanker task (Rueda et al., 2004). Whereas cognitive engagement had no effect on any aspect of task performance, physical activity (i.e., exergaming) enhanced children's speed to resolve interference from conflicting visuospatial stimuli. Age comparisons indicated improvements with age in the accuracy of resolving interference and in overall response time. The results extend past research by showing more precisely how physical activity influences executive function and how this effect differs from the improvements that occur with development.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the relation between liver and biliary enhancement in patients with or without liver dysfunction, and to compare the tumor-to-liver contrast in these patients. Forty patients [group 1: normal liver and Child-Pugh class A in 20 patients, group 2: Child-Pugh class B in 18 patients and Child-Pugh C in 2] were evaluated. All patients underwent MR imaging of the liver using a 1.5-Tesla system. T1-weighted 3D images were obtained at 5, 10, 15 and 20 minutes after Gd-EOB-DTPA injection. The relation between group 3 (total bilirubin <1.8 mg/dL) and group 4 (total bilirubin â¥1.8 mg/dL) was investigated at 20 minutes. Liver and biliary signals were measured, and compared between groups 1 and 2 or groups 3 and 4. Tumor-to-liver ratio was also evaluated between groups 1 and 2. Scheffe's post-hoc test after two-way repeated-measures ANOVA and Pearson's correlation test were used for statistical analysis. Liver enhancement showed significant difference at all time points between groups 1 and 2. Biliary enhancement did not show a significant difference between groups 1 and 2 at 5 minutes, but did at 10, 15 and 20 minutes. At 20 minutes, significant differences between groups 3 and 4 were seen for liver and biliary enhancement. At all time points, liver enhancement correlated with biliary enhancement in both groups. At 5 minutes and 20 minutes, statistical differences between groups 1 and 2 were seen for tumor-to-liver ratio. The degree of biliary enhancement has a close correlation to that of liver enhancement. It is especially important that insufficient liver enhancement causes lower tumor-to-liver contrast in the hepatobiliary phase of Gd-EOB-DTPA.\n\nContinuous background light significantly increases flashing-light enhancement of photosynthesis and growth of microalgae.\n\nPubMed\n\nAbu-Ghosh, Said; Fixler, Dror; Dubinsky, Zvy; Iluz, David\n\n2015-01-01\n\nUnder specific conditions, flashing light enhances the photosynthesis rate in comparison to continuous illumination. Here we show that a combination of flashing light and continuous background light with the same integrated photon dose as continuous or flashing light alone can be used to significantly enhance photosynthesis and increase microalgae growth. To test this hypothesis, the green microalga Dunaliella salina was exposed to three different light regimes: continuous light, flashing light, and concomitant application of both. Algal growth was compared under three different integrated light quantities; low, intermediate, and moderately high. Under the combined light regime, there was a substantial increase in all algal growth parameters, with an enhanced photosynthesis rate, within 3days. Our strategy demonstrates a hitherto undescribed significant increase in photosynthesis and algal growth rates, which is beyond the increase by flashing light alone. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Additionally, consumption of flavanol-rich cocoa has been reported to acutely improve cognitive function. The aim of this study was to determine whether high cocoa flavanol (CF; HCF) consumption would enhance exercise-induced improvement in cognitive function. To test this hypothesis, we examined the combined effects of HCF consumption and moderate-intensity exercise on EF and MF during postexercise recovery. Ten healthy young men received either an HCF (563Â mg of CF) or energy-matched low CF (LCF; 38Â mg of CF) beverage 70Â min before exercise in a single-blind counterbalanced manner. The men then performed moderate-intensity cycling exercise at 60% of peak oxygen uptake for 30Â min. The participants performed a color-word Stroop task and face-name matching task to evaluate EF and MF, respectively, during six time periods throughout the experimental session. EF significantly improved immediately after exercise compared with before exercise in both conditions. However, EF was higher after HCF consumption than after LCF consumption during all time periods because HCF consumption improved EF before exercise. In contrast, HCF consumption and moderate-intensity exercise did not improve MF throughout the experiment. The present findings demonstrated that HCF consumption before moderate-intensity exercise could enhance exercise-induced improvement in EF, but not in MF. Therefore, we suggest that the combination of HCF consumption and aerobic exercise may be beneficial for improving EF. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Telmisartan is a unique angiotensin II type I receptor blocker that has been shown to prevent cardiovascular events in high risk patients. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) plays a critical role in mitochondrial biogenesis and endothelial function. This study assessed whether telmisartan enhances mitochondrial function and alters cellular functions via AMPK in human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAECs). In cultured HCAECs, telmisartan significantly enhanced mitochondrial activity assessed by mitochondrial reductase activity and intracellular ATP production and increased the expression of mitochondria related genes. Telmisartan prevented cellular senescence and exhibited the anti-apoptotic and pro-angiogenic properties. The expression of genes related anti-oxidant and pro-angiogenic properties were increased by telmisartan. Telmisartan increased endothelial NO synthase and AMPK phosphorylation. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma signaling was not involved in telmisartan-induced improvement of mitochondrial function. All of these effects were abolished by inhibition of AMPK. Telmisartan enhanced mitochondrial activity and exhibited anti-senescence effects and improving endothelial function through AMPK in HCAECs. Telmisartan could provide beneficial effects on vascular diseases via enhancement of mitochondrial activity and modulating endothelial function through AMPK activation.
