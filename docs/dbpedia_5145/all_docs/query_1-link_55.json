        "text": "The U.S. Department of the Treasury today designated four individuals affiliated with the Syrian regime’s efforts to reassert Syrian control over the Lebanese political system.\n\n“Syria has used all means at its disposal – from bribery to intimidation to violence – to undermine the legitimate political process in Lebanon,” said Stuart Levey, Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence. “Today’s action exposes four individuals involved in such activities and serves as a warning to others who would do likewise.”\n\nSyrian troops formally withdrew from Lebanon in April 2005 after a 29-year military presence. The Syrian regime is working through Lebanese proxies to exert control over the Lebanese political system; to weaken the majority pro-government March 14 Coalition; and to undermine Lebanese sovereignty and security. The regime has used a range of tools to further these objectives, including bribing politicians, intimidation, interference in the selection of a new president, support for violence, and providing arms to militias and terrorist groups. The four individuals designated today have worked to undermine Lebanese sovereignty and support the Syrian regime’s efforts to interfere in Lebanon’s internal affairs.\n\nSyrian intelligence has assisted Hizballah and other oppositionists in Lebanon to orchestrate protests and demonstrations demanding the resignation of Lebanese Prime Minister Fouad Siniora’s cabinet, which it deems illegitimate. The protests began in December 2006 in Beirut and continue today. Additionally, the Syrian regime has provided arms to illicit Lebanese militias and Palestinian terrorist groups. In addition, the Syrian regime is believed to be intimidating Lebanese who call for the establishment of an international tribunal to try the killers of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri.\n\nAssaad Halim Hardan, Wi’am Wahhab and Hafiz Makhluf were designated pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13441, signed by President George W. Bush on August 1, 2007. E.O. 13441 blocks the property of persons undermining the sovereignty of Lebanon or its democratic processes and institutions.\n\nMuhammad Nasif Khayrbik was designated pursuant to E.O. 13338, which is aimed at individuals and entities contributing to the Government of Syria’s problematic behavior. President Bush signed E.O. 13338 on May 11, 2004 in response to the Syrian government’s continued support of international terrorism, sustained occupation of Lebanon, pursuit of weapons of mass destruction and missile programs, and undermining of U.S. and international efforts in Iraq.\n\nToday’s designations freeze any assets the designees may have located in the United States, and prohibit U.S. persons from engaging in transactions with these individuals.\n\nIdentifying Information\n\nAssaad Halim Hardan\n\nAKAs: Assad Hardan\n\nAs’ad Hardan\n\nDOB: July 31, 1951\n\nPOB: Rashayya al-Fakhar, Lebanon\n\nProfession: Member of Parliament, Lebanon\n\nPolitical Affiliation: Chief of the Syrian Socialist Nationalist Party (SSNP) Central\n\nPolitical Bureau\n\nAssaad Hardan is a senior official in the SSNP.

He is also the brother of Rami Makhluf, Syria’s leading businessman, who has been the subject of persistent allegations of corruption and cronyism.\n\nMuhammad Nasif Khayrbik\n\nAKAs: Muhammad Nasif Khayr-Bayk\n\nMohammed Nassif Khairbek\n\nMohammad Nasif Kheirbek\n\nAddress: Damascus, Syria\n\nPosition: Deputy Vice President for Security Affairs\n\nMilitary Rank: Major General\n\nDOB: April 5, 1937\n\nAs of early 2007, Khayrbik was one of several key advisors to Syrian President Bashar al-Asad. In early 2006, Khayrbik was named Deputy Vice President for Security Affairs. In this position, Khayrbik has played a central role in Syria’s continuing policy of destabilizing Lebanon and Syria’s relationship with known designated terrorist organizations, including Hizballah. In early 2006, Khayrbik coordinated Syrian and Hizballah positions during regular meetings with Hassan Nasrallah, the Secretary General of the Lebanese Hizballah.\n\nKhayrbik has long served the Syrian regime, having served as a close advisor to former President Hafiz al-Asad.
