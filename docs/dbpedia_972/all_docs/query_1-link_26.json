        "text": "France's foremost 19th century figure was born 250 years ago today. His story lingers in the pretty seaside city of Ajaccio, a place worthy of a visit\n\nThe house at the top end of Rue Letizia does not look like a building where an event that would tear Europe asunder took place. It is not that the property is unattractive. Its exterior walls are daubed a pale yellow, while the shutters that frame its first-floor windows are a soft turquoise-green - and this combination of colours is enough to give the structure a gentle elegance.\n\nBut it also has a simplicity that leaves it overshadowed by the arboreal prettiness of the garden which faces it on Place Letizia - the unexpected sound of trees rustling in this distinctly urban setting of narrow streets and busy shop-fronts drawing the visitor's attention away from what is in front of them.\n\nIt is only when you turn around to look at the slab of marble that is fixed in position above the unassuming front door, with its drab coat of brown paint, that the truth hits you. There are the words, chiselled in capitals, which confirm that you have found the right place. \"NAPOLEON EST NE DANS CETTE MAISON,\" it reads - giving the message extra authority by supplying the date in Roman numerals. \"Napoleon was born in this house.\"\n\nAnd indeed he was - a precise 250 years ago today, on August 15, 1769.\n\nBut if the baby who emerged on that summer's day on the edge of the Mediterranean would go on to make the surname \"Bonaparte\" known across the globe - to pull Europe into two decades of war; reshape the continent; push his armies as far afield as the gates of Moscow; rise to become \"Emperor of the French\" - then his early years were largely unremarkable.\n\nHe came to life as the fourth child of Carlo Maria di Buonaparte and Maria Letizia Ramolino, a married couple of minor Italian nobility, whose house - near the port in the Corsican west-coast city of Ajaccio - was more a noisy bubble of the everyday than a stately residence. The family was certainly not poor - Carlo was a lawyer and a diplomat; Maria was the daughter of a Corsican infantry captain - but their son was definitely not considered born to rule.\n\nInstead, the infant Napoleon trundled through his first decade on an island that was regularly buffeted by political and military turbulence. In 1768, Genoa (at that time an independent power) had sold Corsica to France - and, just three months before his birth, French troops had made good this transfer of possession, crushing Corsica's own army at the Battle of Ponte Novu (May 8-9 1769).\n\nThe Napoleon who took his first breaths just weeks later was a long way from being a French governor in waiting. Carlo had even fought with the local resistance against the invading army - and would bring up his new son to believe devotedly in the idea of the Corsican Republic (which had declared its own existence in 1755, in bristling defiance of Genoan wishes). The little boy who grew taller in Ajaccio during the 1770s - and who would commission the Arc de Triomphe only three decades later - cared nothing for the \"Glory of France\".\n\nTwo-and-a-half centuries on, the Maison Bonaparte - which has been protected as a French national museum since 1967 - looks a little more gilded and rather less mundane than it would have in 1769. Fine antique furniture - delightful embroidered chairs in red material; desks and tables of burnished wood - fills its salons, where large mirrors hang on the walls, their reflections amplifying the size of each room. Your shoes click on hard tiles as you walk through, every footstep echoing to the sound of the money that has been invested in restoration.\n\nThe house was in the hands of the Bonapartes, give or take a few interruptions, between 1682 and 1923 - a 241-year span that saw several refurbishments. One of these came in the wake of Napoleon's bitter falling out with the Corsican nationalist leader Pasquale Paoli - an altercation which forced the family to flee to the French mainland in June 1793.\n\nIn their absence, their home was turned into billetted accommodation for soldiers - including the British troops who attacked the island in 1794. The property needed considerable repair when the family to it returned in 1797 - while it would be renovated and expanded again, in decidedly different circumstances, in 1869, to salute the centenary of Napoleon's birth.\n\nBut for all this, the room where he was supposedly born retains an intangible ordinariness - a couchette along one wall, a polished chest of draws against another. Perhaps it is the presence, in an adjacent chamber, of a bust of Maria, which gives the space its vague air of austerity.\n\nNapoleon's mother was a woman of few smiles and many rules, who instilled in her son the steely discipline that would help to propel his ascent. If, maybe, you cannot feel the shadow of one of European history's most significant figures as you stand in his first bedroom, you can perhaps sense his maternal parent's knitted brow and unamused expression elsewhere in the property.\n\nThe Maison Bonaparte pulls in a significant number of visitors - on most mornings, you will find a lengthy queue of tourists on Rue Saint-Charles and Rue Letizia. But it can scarcely be considered the most attractive site in Ajaccio. That title might fall to the city's cathedral - a lovely slab of 16th century Baroque architecture painted a buttery shade of gold. It might equally belong to the Fesch Museum, with its remarkable collection of works by European masters (including Botticelli, Titian, Veronese and Michelangelo) - or, simply, to the gorgeous arcs of Boulevards Lantivy and Pascal Rossini as they sweep along the waterfront, past casinos and restaurants.\n\nNone of this, ultimately, detained Napoleon. He left Ajaccio for France in 1778, aged nine, bound initially for a religious school in the Loire - and, shortly afterwards, for a military academy in Brienne-le-Château (in the Aube department). By the time the French Revolution sent its shockwaves rippling across Europe in 1789, he was an esteemed graduate of the École Militaire in Paris. And although he spent the first four years of the new post-Bastille era back on the island, fighting for the Corsican independence he had dreamed of since childhood, the emnity with Paoli, and the fresh opportunities suddenly available to a military man in a country that had killed its monarchy, would draw him towards the centre of European affairs.\n\nHe de-Italianised his surname - swapping \"Buonaparte\" for the more Gallic \"Bonaparte\" - in 1796, and followed his destiny to the vacuum at the very summit of French life; to Austerlitz and Russia, to exile on Elba, to defeat at Waterloo, and to death in the South Atlantic solitude of Saint Helena.\n\nBut it is still easy to see how Corsica shaped him. The outsider island in the Tyrrhenian Sea - a flinty prize that was coveted, captured and quelled by bigger fish - created its own outsider of raw ambition and ruthless determination, who would cut a swathe through the established French order, and the battlefields beyond. That Corsican was Napoleon's first language (and Italian his second) marked him as different; that he did not learn to speak French until he was 10, always conversed with a strong Corsican accent, and could never spell it without errors, only increased this sense of separation.\n\nCorsica, in turn has never entirely put away its otherness, its desire to be the master of its own matters, or its fantasy of regaining the independence it held briefly in the mid-18th century. And whether you enjoy it on the beach at little Saint-Florent in the craggy north, amid the yachts wedged into the marina at Porto-Vecchio in the south-east, or from the ramparts of Bonifacio in the far south (from which you can gaze across to Sardinia), it has the feel of a destination beyond the mainstream of European travel. Famously, it took the Tour de France more than a century to find it - the planet's greatest cycle race finally coming ashore as part of its 100th edition, in 2013.\n\nInterested travellers are well advised not to be so tardy in making themselves better acquainted.\n\nEssentials\n\nStaying there\n\nA four-night stay at the four-star Mercure Ajaccio Centre, flying from Heathrow on September 18, costs from £628 a head via Expedia (020 3684 2907; expedia.co.uk).\n\nVisiting there\n\nMaison Bonaparte: musees-nationaux-malmaison.fr/musee-maisonbonaparte; €7\n\nMusee Fesch: musee-fesch.com; €8\n\nFurther information"
