        "text": "From this wikipedia page:\n\nNobile Maria Letizia Bonaparte née Ramolino (Marie-Lætitia Ramolino, Madame Mère de l'Empereur) (24 August 1750 – 2 February 1836) was the mother of Napoleon I of France.\n\nShe was born in Ajaccio, Corsica, to Nobile Giovanni Geronimo Ramolino (13 April 1723 – 1755), Captain of Corse Regiments of Chivalry and Infantry in the Army of the Republic of Genoa, and wife Nobile Angela Maria Pietrasanta (circa 1725 – 1790). The distant cousins of the Ramolinos were a low rank of nobility in the Republic of Genoa. Letizia was not formally educated.\n\nOn 2/7 June 1764, when she was 14, she married at Ajaccio Attorney Carlo Buonaparte. She bore 13 children, eight of whom survived infancy, and most of which survivors were made monarchs by Napoleon:\n\nNapoleone Buonaparte (1764/1765 – 17 August 1765)\n\nMaria Anna Buonaparte (3 January 1767 – 1 January 1768)\n\nJoseph Bonaparte (7 January 1768 – 28 July 1844)\n\nNapoleon I of France (15 August 1769 – 5 May 1821), Emperor of the French and namesake of his deceased older brother\n\nMaria Anna Buonaparte (1770), namesake of her deceased older sister\n\nMaria Anna Buonaparte (14 July – 23 November 1771), namesake of her deceased older sisters\n\nA stillborn son\n\nLucien Bonaparte (21 May 1775 – 29 June 1840), Prince of Canino\n\nElisa Bonaparte (13 January 1777 – 7 August 1820), Grand Duchess of Tuscany\n\nLouis Bonaparte (2 September 1778 – 25 July 1846), King of Holland\n\nPauline Bonaparte (20 October 1780 – 9 June 1825), Sovereign Princess and Duchess of Guastalla\n\nCaroline Bonaparte (24 March 1782 – 18 May 1839), Grand Duchess of Berg and Cleves, wife of Joachim Murat, later queen consort of Naples\n\nJérôme Bonaparte (15 November 1784 - 24 June 1860), King of Westphalia.\n\nShe was a harsh mother, and had a very down-to-earth view of most things. When most European mothers, even those in the upper class, bathed perhaps once a month, she had her children bathed every other day.\n\nWhen France under the Ancien Régime took control of Corsica, in 1769, French became the national language, but Letizia never learned the tongue. When she was 35, her husband died of cancer. She was decreed \"Madam, the Mother of His Majesty the Emperor\" (Madame Mère de l'Empereur), Imperial Highness, on 18 May 1804 or 23 March 1805. She died of old age in Rome, in 1836, aged 85. By then she was nearly blind and had outlived her most famous son Napoleon by 15 years.\n\nBTW, I didn't know she was so tough lady. I also wonder how she felt when she outlived her son. Are any known diaries by her?\n\nHer letters and the responses she got are published in several editions. As she was descended of the Italian nobility and her brother was a cardinal, she lived in comfort in Rome till her death, exchanging letters with her family but also with Queen Desideria of Sweden, sister of her daughter-in-law Julie through the ambassadours at the Vatican. So quite a lot of material is still available.\n\nIn May 1805, Madame Mere (Letizia Bonaparte) received a letter from the Emperor Napoleon I informing her:\n\nMadame, I have purchased the Chateau du Pont for you. Send your Steward to see it and take possession of it. I am going to spend 60,000 francs on furnishing it. It is one of the finest country houses in France, much more beautiful than Brienne. I hope you will see this as fresh proof of my desire to please you. Your loving son, NapoleonLetizia let it be known that she did not intend to be present at Napoleon's coronation as Emperor.\n\nShe was determined not to be a witness of a crown being placed upon the head of \"la putana\".\n\n​"
