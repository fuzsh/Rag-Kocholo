        "text": "Princess Napoléon\n\nTheir marriage was unhappy, particularly as Maria Clotilde preferred the quieter, more duty-filled life that she felt they should maintain, while Napoléon-Jérôme preferred the faster, more entertainment-filled lifestyle of the French Court. Another factor in their unhappy marriage were the circumstances leading up to their espousal. Maria Clotilde had been only fifteen years old when they were married, while he over thirty-seven.[3] In the events leading up to their marriage, she had been vehemently against it, and had unhappily agreed to it. The marriage had also been negotiated out of political reasons during the conference of Plombières (July 1858).[3] As Maria Clotilde was too young at the time for marriage, Napoléon-Jérôme had had to wait until the following year; many had disapproved of the speed he undertook collecting his young bride in Turin.[3] Their marriage was often compared to that of an elephant and a gazelle; the bridegroom had strong Napoleonic features (broad, bulky, and ponderous) while the bride appeared frail, short, fair-haired, and with the characteristic nose of the House of Savoy.[3]\n\nHer husband was unfaithful, while she was active in charities. Maria Clotilde was described as proud, bigoted, and dutiful, yet \"pious and modest.\"[4] During a discussion of the proper way of dressing, Maria Clotide pointed out to Empress Eugénie de Montijo that she should not forget that she was born and raised in a royal court. When Eugénie complained of the fatigue of the French Court on one occasion, Maria Clotilde replied, \"We do not mind; you see, we are born to it\".[5]\n\nThe marriage was unpopular with both the French and the Italians; the latter in particular felt that the daughter of their king had been sacrificed to an unpopular member of the House of Bonaparte and consequently regarded it as a mésalliance.[6] For France's part, Napoléon-Jérôme was ill regarded and had been known to carry on a number of affairs both before and during his marriage. Their official reception into Paris on 4 February was greeted very coldly by Parisians, not out of disrespect for a daughter of the king of Sardinia, but out of dislike for her new husband.[3] Indeed, all her life, public sympathy tended to lean in her favor; she was fondly regarded as retiring, charitable, pious, and trapped in an unhappy marriage.[7]"
