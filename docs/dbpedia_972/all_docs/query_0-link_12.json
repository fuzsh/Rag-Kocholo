The House of Bonaparte was a French imperial and royal dynasty founded in 1804 by Napoleon I. Napoleon rose to power during the French Revolution and transformed France into the First French Empire. The House of Bonaparte held power over much of Europe during the Napoleonic Wars but eventually collapsed after Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo in 1815. The dynasty attempted to regain power during the Second French Empire under Napoleon III but was again overthrown after the Franco-Prussian War in 1871.",
