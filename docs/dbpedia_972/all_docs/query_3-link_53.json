        "text": "A few years before Napoléon Bonaparte became emperor of France, his first wife, Josephine de Beauharnais, bought an estate while he was away in Egypt. Château de Malmaison—which is located nine miles west of central Paris—was a grand but derelict old property, and when the future ruler returned, the couple decided it needed extensive renovations. They hired Charles Percier and Pierre François Léonard Fontaine, young architects and decorators who would famously go on to help create the design style called Empire.\n\nJosephine grew up on the Caribbean island of Martinique. Her first husband was beheaded during the French Revolution, and she was imprisoned herself during the Reign of Terror. She was an independent woman, knowledgeable about design, as well as plants and gardens, and Malmaison became a lifelong passion. The Bonapartes were unable to have children, and Napoléon, desperate for an heir, divorced Josephine in 1809. But he insisted she keep her title and he gave her Malmaison. She lived at the château until her death five years later.\n\nFrance offers so many important historical sites, and Malmaison often gets overlooked. It became a museum in 1906, and the interiors (full of tented rooms, custom cabinetry, rich tapestry, and monumental furniture) and gardens (designed in the English style by, among others, Louis-Martin Berthault) are a wonder to behold.\n\nJoin me on a tour of Josephine and Napoléon’s château.\n\n1 / 15\n\nArchitecture + Design\n\nInside Jeanne Damas’s Transportive Paris Aerie\n\nThe fashion maven and actor and her art-dealer partner made their first home together feel like a country oasis overlooking the City of Light\n\nClever\n\nThis 517-Square-Foot Apartment in Paris Features a Hidden Room\n\nThe small space makes use of every inch thanks to a bedroom that only comes out at night\n\nClever\n\nThis 430-Square-Foot Paris Apartment Is Transformed Into a Bohemian Loft\n\nThe architect owner redesigned the tiny space with lots of natural light in mind\n\nShopping\n\nThe Best Amazon Prime Day Deals 2022 for the Home, According to AD Editors\n\nIt’s a marathon, not a sprint—stick with us as we navigate the Prime Day deals"
