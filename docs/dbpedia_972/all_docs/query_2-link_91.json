        "text": "Palazzo Bonaparte\n\nAlthough the French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte (1769-1821) never visited Rome, his family's name is emblazoned for all to see on the altana of a palazzo in the heart of the city.\n\nOn the north side of Piazza Venezia, at the start of Via del Corso, stands the Palazzo Bonaparte, an imposing building, which was once the residence of Napoleon’s mother, Maria Letizia Ramolino (1750-1836).\n\nThe 17th century palazzo was originally built for Giuseppe e Benedetto d'Aste (whose family's name also appears on the altana). In 1770 it passed to Folco Rinuccini and fifty years later it was bought by Maria Letizia Ramolino, Napoloen's mother, who lived there from 1818 until her death in 1836.\n\nIt was at the behest of Madame Bonaparte that the palazzo's only balcony be enclosed behind wooden slatted shutters, so that she could sit there, hidden from the prying eyes of curious passers-by, and watch the world go by.\n\nAfter losing her sight the old lady would be accompanied on her balcony by a female companion, who would relate the events taking place in the busy Via del Corso and Piazza Venezia, then known as Piazza San Marco.\n\nPalazzo Bonaparte: Balcony"
