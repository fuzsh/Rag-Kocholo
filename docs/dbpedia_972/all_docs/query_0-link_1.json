It was founded in 1804 by Napoleon I, the son of Corsican nobleman Carlo Buonaparte and Letizia Buonaparte (née Ramolino). Napoleon was a French military leader who rose to power during the French Revolution and who, in 1804, transformed the French First Republic into the First French Empire, five years after his coup d'état of November 1799 (18 Brumaire). Napoleon and the Grande Armée had to fight against every major European power (except for the ones he was allied with, including Denmark-Norway) and dominated continental Europe through a series of military victories during the Napoleonic Wars. He installed members of his family on the thrones of client states, expanding the power of the dynasty.\n\nThe House of Bonaparte formed the Imperial House of France during the French Empire, together with some non-Bonaparte family members. In addition to holding the title of Emperor of the French, the Bonaparte dynasty held various other titles and territories during the Napoleonic Wars, including the Kingdom of Italy, the Kingdom of Spain, the Kingdom of Westphalia, the Kingdom of Holland, and the Kingdom of Naples. The dynasty held power for around a decade until the Napoleonic Wars began to take their toll. Making very powerful enemies, such as Austria, Britain, Russia, and Prussia, as well as royalist (particularly Bourbon) restorational movements in France, Spain, the Two Sicilies, and Sardinia, the dynasty eventually collapsed due to the final defeat of Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo and the restoration of former dynasties by the Congress of Vienna.\n\nDuring the reign of Napoleon I, the Imperial Family consisted of the Emperor's immediate relations – his wife, son, siblings, and some other close relatives, namely his brother-in-law Joachim Murat, his uncle Joseph Fesch, and his stepson Eugène de Beauharnais.\n\nBetween 1852 and 1870, there was a Second French Empire, when a member of the Bonaparte dynasty again ruled France: Napoleon III, the youngest son of Louis Bonaparte. However, during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–1871, the dynasty was again ousted from the Imperial Throne. Since that time, there has been a series of pretenders. Supporters of the Bonaparte family's claim to the throne of France are known as Bonapartists. Current head Jean-Christophe, Prince Napoléon has a Bourbon mother.\n\nItalian origins\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Bonaparte (originally Italian: Buonaparte) family were patricians in the Italian towns of Sarzana, San Miniato, and Florence. The name derives from Italian: buona (\"good\") and parte (\"part\" or \"side\"). In Italian, the phrase \"buona parte\" is used to identify a fraction of considerable, but undefined, size in a totum.\n\nGianfaldo Buonaparte was the first known Buonaparte at Sarzana around 1200. His descendant Giovanni Buonaparte in 1397 married Isabella Calandrini, a cousin of later cardinal Filippo Calandrini. Giovanni became mayor of Sarzana and was named commissioner of the Lunigiana by Giovanni Maria Visconti in 1408. His daughter, Agnella Berni, was the great-grandmother of Italian poet Francesco Berni and their great-grandson Francesco Buonaparte was an equestrian mercenary at the service of the Genoese Bank of Saint George. In 1490, Francesco Buonaparte went to the island of Corsica, which was controlled by the bank. In 1493, he married the daughter of Guido da Castelletto, representative of the Bank of Saint George in Ajaccio, Corsica. Most of their descendants during subsequent generations were members of the Ajaccio town council. Napoleon's father, Carlo Buonaparte, received a patent of nobility from the King of France in 1771.[1]\n\nThere also existed a Buonaparte family in Florence; however, its eventual relation with the Sarzana and San Miniato families is unknown. Jacopo Buonaparte of San Miniato was a friend and advisor to Medici Pope Clement VII. Jacopo was also a witness to and wrote an account of the sack of Rome, which is one of the most important historical documents recounting that event.[3] Two of Jacopo's nephews, Pier Antonio Buonaparte and Giovanni Buonaparte, however, took part in the 1527 Medici rebellion, after which they were banished from Florence and later were restored by Alessandro de' Medici, Duke of Florence. Jacopo's brother Benedetto Buonaparte maintained political neutrality.[4] The San Miniato branch extinguished with Jacopo in 1550. The last member of the Florence family was a canon named Gregorio Bonaparte, who died in 1803, leaving Napoleon as heir.[5]\n\nA Buonaparte tomb lies in the Church of San Francesco in San Miniato. A second tomb, the Chapelle Impériale, was built by Napoleon III in Ajaccio 1857.\n\nCoat of arms of the Buonaparte of Sarzana\n\nCoat of arms of the Buonaparte of San Miniato\n\nCoat of arms of the Buonaparte of Florence\n\nImperial House of France\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1793 Corsica formally seceded from France and sought protection from the British government, prompting Pasquale Paoli to compel the Bonapartes to relocate to the mainland. Napoleon I is the most prominent name associated with the Bonaparte family because he conquered much of Europe during the early 19th century. Due to his indisputable popularity in France both among the people and in the army, he staged the Coup of 18 Brumaire and overthrew the Directory with the help of his brother Lucien Bonaparte, president of the Council of Five Hundred. Napoleon then oversaw the creation of a new Constitution that made him the First Consul of France on 10 November 1799. On 2 December 1804, he crowned himself Emperor of the French and ruled from 1804 to 1814, and again in 1815 during the Hundred Days after his return from Elba.\n\nFollowing his conquest of most of Western Europe, Napoleon I made his elder brother Joseph first King of Naples and then of Spain, his younger brother Louis King of Holland (subsequently forcing his abdication in 1810 after his failure to subordinate Dutch interests to those of France), and his youngest brother Jérôme as King of Westphalia, a short-lived realm created from several states of northwestern Germany.\n\nNapoleon's son Napoléon François Charles Joseph was made King of Rome and was later styled as Napoleon II by loyalists of the dynasty, though he only ruled for two weeks after his father's abdication.\n\nLouis-Napoléon, son of Louis, was President of France and then Emperor of the French from 1852 to 1870, reigning as Napoleon III. His son, Napoléon, Prince Imperial, died fighting the Zulus in Natal, today the South African province of KwaZulu-Natal. With his death, the family lost much of its remaining political appeal, though claimants continue to assert their right to the imperial title. A political movement for Corsican independence surfaced in the 1990s which included a Bonapartist restoration in its programme.[citation needed]\n\nCrowns held by the family\n\n[edit]\n\nEmperors of the French\n\n[edit]\n\nNapoleon I (1804–1814, 1815), also King of Italy (1805–1814) and Emperor in Elba (1814–1815) and Co-Prince of Andorra (1804–1814, 1815)\n\nNapoleon II (1815), styled as King of Rome from birth, but never reigned and also Duke of Reichstadt 1818–1832, but never visited the town\n\nNapoleon III (1852–1870), also Co-Prince of Andorra (1852–1870)\n\nKings of Holland\n\n[edit]\n\nLouis I (1806–1810)\n\nLouis II (1810), also Grand Duke of Berg (1809–1813)\n\nKing of Naples\n\n[edit]\n\nJoseph I (1806–1808)\n\nKing of Westphalia\n\n[edit]\n\nJérôme I (1807–1813)\n\nKing of Spain\n\n[edit]\n\nJoseph I (1808–1813)\n\nGrand Duchess of Tuscany\n\n[edit]\n\nElisa Bonaparte (1809–1814), also Princess of Lucca and Piombino (1805–1814)\n\nHeads of the House of Bonaparte (since 1852)\n\n[edit]\n\nNapoléon III (1852–1873)\n\nNapoléon IV Eugène (1873–1879), son of Napoléon III\n\nNapoléon V Victor (1879–1926), grandson of Napoléon I's youngest brother, Jérôme\n\nNapoléon VI Louis (1926–1997), son of Napoléon V Victor\n\nDisputed since 1997:\n\nNapoléon VII Charles (1997–present), son of Napoléon VI Louis\n\nNapoléon VII Jean-Christophe (1997–present), grandson of Napoléon VI Louis\n\nFamily tree\n\n[edit]\n\nFrench monarchyBonaparte dynasty Napoleon I\n\nChildren\n\nNapoleon II\n\nSiblings\n\nJoseph, King of Spain\n\nLucien, Prince of Canino\n\nElisa, Grand Duchess of Tuscany\n\nLouis, King of Holland\n\nPauline, Princess of Guastalla\n\nCaroline, Queen of Naples\n\nJérôme, King of Westphalia\n\nNephews and nieces\n\nPrincess Zénaïde\n\nPrincess Charlotte\n\nCharlotte, Princess Gabrielli\n\nPrince Charles Lucien\n\nPrince Louis Lucien\n\nPrince Pierre Napoléon\n\nPrince Napoléon Charles\n\nPrince Napoléon Louis\n\nNapoleon III\n\nPrince Jérôme Napoléon\n\nPrince Jérôme Napoléon Charles\n\nPrince Napoléon\n\nPrincess Mathilde\n\nGrandnephews and -nieces\n\nPrince Joseph\n\nPrince Lucien Cardinal Bonaparte\n\nAugusta, Princess Gabrielli\n\nPrince Roland\n\nPrincess Jeanne\n\nPrince Jerome\n\nPrince Charles\n\nNapoléon (V) Victor\n\nMaria Letizia, Duchess of Aosta\n\nGreat grandnephews and -nieces\n\nPrincess Marie\n\nPrincess Marie Clotilde\n\nNapoléon (VI) Louis\n\nGreat great grandnephews and -nieces\n\nNapoléon (VII) Charles\n\nPrincess Catherine\n\nPrincess Laure\n\nPrince Jérôme\n\nGreat great great grandnephews and -nieces\n\nPrincess Caroline\n\nJean Christophe, Prince Napoléon\n\nNapoleon II Napoleon III\n\nChildren\n\nNapoléon (IV), Prince Imperial\n\nFamily tree list\n\n[edit]\n\nNote: Bold for common names\n\nCarlo-Maria (Ajaccio, 1746–Montpellier, 1785) married Maria Letizia Ramolino (Ajaccio, 1750–Rome, 1836) in 1764.

In 1804, Napoleon I changed the arms to Azure an imperial eagle or. The change applied to all members of his family except for his brother Lucien and his nephew, the son from Jérôme's first marriage.\n\nArms of Charles-Maria Buonaparte\n\nArms of Napoleon I and Napoleon II, as Kings of Italy\n\nArms of Joseph Bonaparte, as King of Naples\n\nArms of Joseph Bonaparte, as King of Spain\n\nArms of Jérôme Bonaparte, King of Westphalia\n\nDNA research\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to studies by G. Lucotte and his coauthors based on DNA research since 2011, Napoleon Bonaparte belonged to Y-DNA (direct male ancestry) haplogroup E1b1b1c1* (E-M34*). This 15000-year-old haplogroup has its highest concentration in Ethiopia and in the Near East (Jordan, Yemen). According to the authors of the study, \"Probably Napoléon also knew his remote oriental patrilineal origins, because Francesco Buonaparte (the Giovanni son), who was a mercenary under the orders of the Genoa Republic in Ajaccio in 1490, was nicknamed The Maure of Sarzane.\" The latest study identifies the common Bonaparte DNA markers from Carlo (Charles) Bonaparte to 3 living descendants.[6][7]\n\nLucotte et al. published in October 2013 the extended Y-STR of Napoleon I based on descendant testing, and the descendants were E-M34, just like the emperor's beard hair tested a year before. The persons tested were the patrilineal descendants of Jérome Bonaparte, one of Napoleon's brothers, and of Alexandre Colonna-Walewski, Napoleon's illegitimate son with Marie Walewska. These three tests all yielded the same Y-STR haplotype (109 markers) confirming with 100% certainty that the first Emperor of the French belonged to the M34 branch of haplogroup E1b1b.\n\nSTR strongly suggests that the Bonaparte belong to the Y58897 branch, which means that the ancestor 3000 years ago or a bit more lived in Anatolia, but all relatives in the database with a common ancestor with over a 1000 years are found in their own the Massa - La Spezia small area in Italy.[8][9][10] There are at the moment no relatives in the database older than that, which means they are very rare in Europe.\n\nLiving members\n\n[edit]\n\nCharles, Prince Napoléon (born 1950, great-great-grandson of Jérôme Bonaparte by his second marriage), and his son Jean-Christophe, Prince Napoléon (born 1986 and appointed heir in the will of his grandfather Louis, Prince Napoléon) currently dispute the headship of the Bonaparte family.[11] The only other male members of the family are Charles's recently married (2013) brother, Prince Jérôme Napoléon (born 1957) and Jean-Christophe's son, Prince Louis Napoléon (born 2022). There are no other legitimate descendants in the male line from Napoleon I or from his brothers.\n\nThere are, however, numerous descendants of Napoleon's illegitimate, unacknowledged son, Count Alexandre Colonna-Walewski (1810–1868), born from Napoleon I's union with Marie, Countess Walewski. A descendant of Napoleon's sister Caroline Bonaparte was actor René Auberjonois. Recent DNA-matches with living descendants of Jérôme and Count Walewski have confirmed the existence of descendants of Lucien Bonaparte, Napoleon's brother, namely the Clovis family.[7]\n\nNapoleon II - Napoleon I's only legitimate child\n\nCharles, Count Léon (1806–1881), son of Napoleon I\n\nCount Alexandre Colonna-Walewski, Napoleon I's unacknowledged son\n\nJérôme Bonaparte, founder of the surviving legitimate Bonapartist line of succession\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nBonapartism\n\nBonapartists (political party)\n\nSuccession to the former French throne (Bonapartist)\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nMedia related to House of Bonaparte at Wikimedia Commons\n\n(in Italian) The coat of arms of the Tuscan branch of Bonaparte family in State Archives of Florence\n\nRose, John Holland (1911). \"Bonaparte\" .
