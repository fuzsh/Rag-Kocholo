        "text": "BORDENTOWN - History buffs looking for some indoor fun as the weather gets colder should check out this exhibit that gets an international nod of approval.\n\nEach year, the Bordentown Historical Society hosts several exhibits at The Bordentown Friends Meetinghouse, located in the historic district, to educate visitors and residents on the town's history. Its newest exhibition consists of artifacts collected from King Joseph Bonaparte's self-imposed exile in South Jersey. Despite Bordentown's notoriety for its rich history, Doug Kiovsky, vice president of the BHS, says that Bonaparte's ties to the small town is less known.\n\n\"The primary question when people see the exhibit is that they don't know anything about Joseph Bonaparte or rather than even that he was even Bordentown resident,\" Kiovsky said. \"In the 1820s, he was there full time, then in the 1830s he was here off and on until 1839 when he finally left.\"\n\nPeter Tucci, a board member for the BHS, has been studying Bonaparte for more than 20 years. Through his studies, Tucci connected with Philippe Ã‰tienne, the ambassador of France to the United States who visited the exhibit earlier this month.\n\n\"He actually knew the name and the contact for the French ambassador to the U.S. and after two years of asking him, he was able to come. His entourage was, there just a few of them. They took a look at our exhibits and were totally fascinated with the whole thing,\" Kiovsky said.\n\nBonaparte was the eldest brother of French military leader Napoleon Bonaparte. By the appointment of his brother, he ruled as the King of Naples from 1806 to 1808 and King of Spain from 1808 to 1813.\n\nAfter learning of the capture of his brother by British forces following his final defeat in 1815 during the Napoleonic Wars, The Battle of the Waterloo, Bonaparte knew was facing a grim fate.\n\n\"Joseph knew that the jig was up, like him and other family members might meet the same fate with exiles. They didn't want to execute the Bonapartes because they were afraid if they did that, it would be like martyr syndrome. So they figured, well, we'll just get rid of them until they die. So Joseph knew what was next and he escaped, boarded one of the ship and came to New York incognito, in disguise,\" Kiovsky said.\n\nHowever, Bonaparte's ability to go unnoticed didn't last long forcing him to flee to Philadelphia where there was a French enclave. That's where he met Stephen Girard, banker and philanthropist of French origin and founder of Philadelphia's Girard College.\n\nMore: Camden's Rosa Ramirez remembered as a 'social justice warrior'\n\nAlso: This South Jersey abolitionist, Civil War soldier is finally getting national recognition\n\n\"He offered Joseph a home in Philadelphia. But he's used to palaces so he asked him can you find out where I can find some land and he tells him to get on your ship and go up to Delaware and see what you can find. And that's exactly what he did,\" Kiovsky said.\n\nTraveling up the Delaware River, Bonaparte eventually settled on the bluffs in Bordentown where he lived a wealthy lifestyle in the Point Breeze estate. Built in 1816, it was the largest residence in the United States at the time.\n\n\"It was a 200-acre, formal estate right in Bordentown and then there was about 12 farms across the street which border right near the Delaware,\" Kiovsky said. \"So he had 800 acres, but his state was fabulous. The estate was the second most beautiful next to the White House they said and he also had the first picturesque landscaping theme in the United States.\"\n\nBonaparte was also known for his collection of books, larger than the Library of Congress, and art, some of which can be found at the Bordentown Historical Society's exhibit.\n\n\"He also had the largest private art collection in the United States and the largest private rental library in the United States,\" Kiovsky said. \"There is at least two or three paintings that were in his home that we do have. There was a famous painting of Napoleon crossing the Alps on a big white horse that was in his Point Breeze home.\"\n\nAt the Bordentown Friends Meetinghouse exhibit, the interior is staged to resemble Bonaparte's South Jersey estate.\n\n\"We have furniture, paintings, documents on display, framed letters, and even books that was owned by Joseph Bonaparte at one time or another. So it's a really cool display. We even have a huge display of Joseph Bonaparte himself,\" Kiovsky said.\n\nTo maintain the artifacts on display, the BHS ensures paintings are stored away from sunlight to prevent damage and are cleaned by only using cloth.\n\n\"We are all stewards of history, and we care about the future as much as our past. In my mind, every artifact has a story, and therefore every story has a meaning,\" he said.\n\nJoseph Bonaparte exhibit\n\nThe Joseph Bonaparte exhibit is located at 302 Farnsworth Avenue in Bordentown and is open for visitors through the spring of 2023 on selected Saturdays from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. A series of lectures and performances about Bonaparte's life in South Jersey will also be hosted throughout the duration of the exhibit. The Bordentown Historical Society also welcome residents in the area to donate Bonaparte artifacts in their possession to their exhibit.\n\nTo learn more about the Bordentown Historical Society or make a monetary contribution, visit https://bordentownhistory.org/.\n\nNicolette White is the Diversity and Inclusion reporter for the Burlington County Times, The Daily Journal and Courier-Post.
