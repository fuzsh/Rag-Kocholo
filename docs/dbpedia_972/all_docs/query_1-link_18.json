        "text": "Élisa Bonaparte (born Jan. 3, 1777, Ajaccio, Corsica—died Aug. 7, 1820, Sant’Andrea, near Trieste) was Napoleon I’s eldest sister to survive infancy.\n\nShe was married on May 1, 1797, to Félix Baciocchi, a member of a Corsican noble family. Napoleon gave her the principality of Piombino in March 1805 and the principality of Lucca in the following June and finally, in March 1809, made her grand duchess of Tuscany. Her pride and ability had great influence on the administration and on Italian affairs in general. Her relations with Napoleon were frequently strained; in 1813–14 she abetted Joachim Murat in his enterprises. After her brother’s fall she retired, with the title of contessa (countess) di Compignano, first to Bologna and afterward to Sant’Andrea near Trieste."
