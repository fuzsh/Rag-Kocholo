        "text": "N & E\n\nNapoleon & Empire\n\nGenealogy of Napoleon - The Bonaparte Family\n\nThe ancestors of Napoleon: his great-grandparents\n\nNapoleon Bonaparte had eight great-grandparents! It was by no means a truism, if one observes that his wife Marie-Louise had only four (through intermarriage)!\n\nTheir historical significance was limited to the part they played in the birth of the Emperor, so this website doesn't publish their individual biographies; however it seemed to us appropriate to present them briefly, as well as Napoleon's grandparents.\n\nBONAPARTE, Sebastiano Nicola\n\nNobile Sebastiano Nicola Bonaparte, born September 29, 1683 in Ajaccio , was the father of Giuseppe Maria Bonaparte, the grandfather of Carlo Bonaparte (or Buonaparte), and therefore the back-grandfather of Napoleon the First.\n\nHe married on December 17, 1708, in his hometown, Maria-Anna Tusoli, who gave him six children. He was appointed Elder (Anziano) to the Council of Ajaccio on April 20, 1720, and died before November 1720 (some sources indicate October 20, 1720; others cite November 24, 1760, forty years later!), at Ajaccio too.\n\nThe Bonapartes were a branch of the family Cadolingi di Borgonuovo, lords of Fucecchio in Tuscany since the tenth century. Their lineage had moved to Sarzana, Liguria, before 1264 and to Corsica in the late fifteenth century, as we shall see below.\n\nSebastiano Nicola was the son of Giuseppe Maria Bonaparte (February 24, 1663 - October 24, 1703), who had served as Elder at the Council of Ajaccio, and Maria Colonna Bozzi (circa 1665 or 1668 - October 16, 1704), married on November (or December) 20, 1682. Maria's dowry was 4,901 pounds and included some parts of the Bozzi house (future Bonaparte house), located on Malerba Street.\n\nHis paternal grandparents were Carlo Maria Bonaparte (November 1st, 1637 - August 26, 1692), also Elder at the Council of Ajaccio on several occasions from 1666 to his death, who had married on June 10, 1657 Miss Virginia Odone (February 27, 1642 - ?), the daughter of Pietro Odone, a merchant, and Constanza Pozzo di Borgo, a noble young woman.\n\nHis maternal grandparents were Antonio Colonna di Bozzi, Signori dell Altu Taravu, and his wife Giustina Lomellini. Their relationship with the Colonna family, from which came Pope Martin V, is uncertain.\n\nHis homonymous great-grandfather Sebastiano Bonaparte (1603 - February 28, 1642) was Elder at the Council from 1620 and became Chancellor of Ajaccio in 1633. He married on May 19, 1630 Miss Maria Rastelli (1608 - after 1658), daughter of Domenico Rastelli. His ancestry was the following:\n\nSebastiano was born from Francesco Bonaparte (circa 1570 - 1633) and Camilla Catacciolo. Francesco had served as an officer in the armed forces of the Republic of Genoa, specifically as a colonel of his own regiment in Corsica;\n\nFrancesco's parents were the politician Geronimo (or Girolamo) Bonaparte and his wife Pellegrina Calvari. Girolamo, a notary, lived over 100 years (circa 1550 - 1650), held various positions (including that of President in 1594) to the Council and Senate of Ajaccio, and became senator representing Ajaccio at the Senate of Genoa;\n\nGeronimo's father was Gabriele Bonaparte (dead 1589), mercenary horseman of the Republic of Genoa in Ajaccio; his mother was Francesca Montano, from a patrician family;\n\nGabriele's father was Francesco Bonaparte (dead 1540), nicknamed \"il Moro\" (The Moorish). That Francesco was a noble man, from Sarzana in Liguria, who had served as a mercenary crossbowman and horseman in the Army of the Saint-George Bank (Banco di S. Giorgio); he had been assigned to Corsica in 1490 and had married the following year Miss Caterinada Castelletto, the daughter of Guido da Castelletto, the local representative of the Saint-George Bank. Francesco, who had retired in the 1510s, decided to settle permanently on the \"Island of Beauty\" (Corsica), thus founding the Corsican lineage of the Bonapartes.\n\nTUSOLI, Maria-Anna\n\nBorn 1690 at Bocognano (Bucugn√† in Corsican language), a mountain village located between Ajaccio and Corte, she was the daughter of Nobile Carlo Tusoli and Isabella N., both natives of the village.\n\nShe married Sebastiano Nicola Bonaparte at Ajaccio on December 17, 1708.\n\nThe couple had six children:\n\nPaola Maria Bonaparte, born on August 25, 1710 at Ajaccio, who married on June 29, 1737 Pietro Ternano (? - before 1750), then in second wedding in 1750 Michele Angelo Durazzo-Fozzani (Fozzano, 1698 - circa 1755), General of the Independant Corsican Army, and finally in third wedding on January 14, 1756 Gaetano Alata (August 1735 - ?);\n\nMaddalena Bonaparte, born towards 1712 at Zigliara, who married in 1736 Frederick de Drost Freiherr von Moersbruck, parent of Theodor Stephan Freiherr von Neuhoff, the first and only King in the whole history of Corsica, who reigned during only seven months, in 1736;\n\nGiuseppe Maria Bonaparte, born on May 31, 1713 at Ajaccio, dead on December 13, 1763, Napoleon's grandfather;\n\nNapoleone Bonaparte, born towards year 1717.

Archdeacon and canon of the Cathedral of Ajaccio since 1771, Luciano offered a scholarship in 1781 to Joseph Fesch, the half brother of the wife of his nephew, to enable him to enter the seminary of Aix-en-Provence.
