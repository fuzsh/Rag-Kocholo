        "text": "Scope of project\n\nThis project identifies members of the royal house of House of Bonaparte, First and Second French Empires.\n\nOverview\n\nThe House of Bonaparte is an imperial and royal European dynasty founded by Napoleon I of France in 1804, a French military leader who rose to notability out of the French Revolution and transformed the French Republic into the First French Empire within five years of his coup d'état. Napoleon turned the Grande Armée against every major European power and dominated continental Europe through a series of military victories. He installed members of his family on the thrones of client states, founding the dynasty.\n\nThroughout its history, the dynasty, as well as being Emperors of the French, held various other titles and territories including; their ancestral nation the Kingdom of Italy, Kingdom of Spain, Kingdom of Westphalia, Kingdom of Holland and the Kingdom of Naples. The dynasty was in a position of power for around a decade until the Napoleonic Wars began to take their toll. Making very powerful enemies such as Austria, United Kingdom, Russia and Prussia, as well as royalist (particularly Bourbon) restorational movements in France, Spain, the Two Sicilies and Sardinia, the dynasty eventually collapsed under its own weight.\n\nBetween the years 1852 and 1870 there was a Second French Empire, again a member of the Bonaparte dynasty would rule; Napoleon III of France the son of Louis Bonaparte. However after tensions relating to Prussia, the dynasty was again ousted from the imperial throne. Since that time there has been a series of pretenders, supporters of the Bonaparte family's claim to the throne of France are known as Bonapartists. Current head Jean-Christophe Napoléon is ironically from a Bourbon mother.\n\nCountries\n\nFrench Empire\n\nKingdom of Italy\n\nKingdom of Spain\n\nKingdom of Westphalia\n\nKingdom of Holland\n\nKingdom of Naples\n\nGrand Duchy of Tuscany\n\nElba\n\nTitles\n\nEmperor of the French\n\nEmperor of Elba\n\nKing of Italy\n\nKing of Spain\n\nKing of Holland\n\nKing of Westphalia\n\nKing of Naples\n\nKing of Rome (courtesy title only)\n\nGrand Duchess of Tuscany\n\nBonaparte family\n\nThe Bonaparte family were from minor Italian nobility who held most of their property in the hill town of San Miniato near Florence, Italy. The Bonapartes came from a Tuscan stock of Lombard origin. The name derives from Italian, bona (buona) \"good\" and parte \"solution\" or \"match\" (a name bestowed as an expression of satisfaction at a newborn’s arrival). It has been suggested that a certain William Bayne was forced to leave Scotland after the failure of the Jacobite Rebellion of 1745. He and his family were said to have been shipwrecked in Corsica and settled there. Bayne and his party became known as Boun-de-parte and after two generations the surname Bonaparte was used.\n\nAfter settling in Florence the family enjoyed a relationship with the then ruling Medici family. Jacopo Bonaparte was a friend and advisor to Medici Pope Clement VII. Jacopo was also a witness to and wrote an account of the sack of Rome, which is one of the most important historical documents recounting that event. Two of Jacopo's nephews, Pier-Antonio Bonaparte and Giovanni Bonaparte, however, took part in the 1527 Medici rebellion, after which they were banished from Florence and later were restored by Alessandro de' Medici. Jacopo's brother Benedetto Bonaparte maintained political neutrality.\n\nThe family later separated into two branches: Bonaparte-Sarzana, Nobili di Sarzana had been compelled to leave Florence due to the defeat of the Ghibellines and later when Francesco Bonaparte came to Corsica in 16th century and the island was in Genoese possession.\n\nThe Bonaparte tomb lies in the Church of San Francesco in San Miniato.\n\nCrowns held by the family\n\nEmperors of the French\n\nNapoleon I (1804–1814, 1815), also King of Italy (1805–1814) and Emperor of Elba (1814–1815)\n\nNapoleon II (1815), styled King of Rome from birth, but never reigned\n\nNapoleon III (1852–1870)\n\nKings of Holland\n\nLouis I (1806–1810)\n\nLouis II 1810, also Grand Duke of Berg 1809–1813\n\nKing of Naples\n\nJoseph I (1806–1808)\n\nKing of Westphalia\n\nJérôme I (1807–1813)\n\nKing of Spain\n\nJoseph I (1808–1813)\n\nGrand Duchess of Tuscany\n\nElisa Bonaparte (1809–1814)\n\nThe family tree\n\nCarlo-Maria (Ajaccio 1746–Montpellier 1785) married Maria Letizia Ramolino (Ajaccio 1750 – Rome 1836) in 1764.
