        "text": "Crowd (archive): Death to America! Death to America! (in Farsi)\n\nBarry Rosen, Press Attaché U.S. Embassy: The morning of November 4th, I’m in my office. It started to rain a little bit. We heard the crowds in front of the embassy. I looked up and saw someone climbing over the gate. Some young woman cut the chain and several hundred protesters, some with weapons, were moving all over the embassy.\n\nBarry Rosen, Press Attaché U.S. Embassy: Before I knew it. 15 to 20 people are pounding on my door. Just barged through. And there I am facing these people. And I said, “who are you?” And he says, \"I'm a part of the Students Following the Line of the imam. You're in the nest of spies. You are part of U.S. imperialism, and you're the corruptors of the Earth. You are our prisoner.”\n\nAustralian Reporter (archive): The hostages are apparently in the main building. The embassy is occupied by about 400 students and Islamic Revolutionary Guards.\n\nEd Bradley (archive): Good evening. In Tehran tonight, the American embassy is in the hands of several hundred Iranian students who took control after a three hour skirmish with U.S. Marines. They are holding hostages and are demanding that the exiled shah of Iran, now undergoing cancer treatment at a New York hospital, be returned to stand trial.\n\nCrowd (archive): “Death to the Shah” “Death to the Shah…” (in Farsi)\n\nGary Sick, National Security Council Staff: On November 4th, when the hostages were taken, I was at home in bed and I got a call from Brzezinski. He said, they took our people at the embassy. I got in my VW and drove over to the State Department\n\nIranian Hostage-Taker Over Phone (archive): …the American embassy…\n\nGary Sick, National Security Council Staff: We were getting reports directly from inside the embassy. So here we were with all of these open phones.\n\nIranian Hostage-Taker Over Phone (archive): … so please open the door. They didn’t accept.\n\nGary Sick, National Security Council Staff: So here we were with all these open phones\n\nIranian Hostage-Taker Over Phone (Archive): They get angry and shout to them, if you don't open the door we will open it ourselves. After that, a student has gone up and arrest all of them, ok? And then tied their hands.\n\nGary Sick, National Security Council Staff: And then one by one, as the day went on, the phones were shut down. So we lost contact.\n\nSam Donaldson (archive): The action against the embassy may or may not have been ordered by Iran's religious leader, the Ayatollah Khomeini, which adds to Washington's difficulty in trying to resolve this dangerous situation.\n\nTed Koppel (archive): The State Department is doing what it can. But at the moment, at least, that doesn’t appear to be much.\n\nGary Sick, National Security Council Staff: From my position in the White House, I'm not a decision maker. But I'm watching everything and I'm relaying what I learned to the President. So I have a straight line to him. One of the things that was discussed was possibly imposing a blockade against Iranian ports or cutting off their oil exports. But it was very likely that it would bring the Soviets in. And it could, in fact, lead to World War Three.\n\nTed Koppel (archive): Washington is tremendously concerned about Iran's oil supplies and our need for them and, of course, concerned about the safety of those Americans still at the embassy.\n\nReporter (archive): The demonstrators burned the American flag, blindfolded and handcuffed at least some of their American hostages and paraded them in front of the embassy building.\n\nBarry Rosen, Press Attaché U.S. Embassy: Here I had in my mind, okay, it's over, we're out of here. They'll just put us on a plane and take us out of here by tomorrow. Diplomatic immunity. Well, I was tied up and they start beating me up, there I started to really think about what the hell is going on now.\n\nBarbara Rosen, Wife of American Hostage: It was an early Sunday morning and the phone rang downstairs. It was my mother in law and she was very, very upset. Something’s happened at the embassy. She had heard it on the news.\n\nReporter (archive): His name is Barry Rosen. He is the embassy’s press attache. Because of the blindfold, Rosen could not see….\n\nBarbara Rosen, Wife of American Hostage: The Iranians were saying they had a certain number of people being held, and the Carter administration would neither confirm or deny. My mother took my kids and I got on the phone to Washington trying to find out what was going on.\n\nFrank Reynolds (archive): The Iran crisis. America held hostage tonight at eleven thirty, ten thirty Central Time.\n\nGary Sick, National Security Council Staff: This was the first American foreign policy crisis that had been televised live from start to stop.\n\nPresident Jimmy Carter (archive): We will not rest or deviate from our efforts…\n\nGary Sick, National Security Council Staff: The reality is that every American was sitting in their homes talking to other Americans about this situation. It had a huge impact on the way people think.\n\nFrank Reynolds (archive): Radio broadcasts by Khomeini and his supporters have now become ugly and violently anti-American.\n\nPresident Jimmy Carter (archive): I’ve just gotten a report that there are maybe 80,000 Iranians demonstrating outside our embassy in a highly emotional state and we are trying as best we can to protect the honor of our country and to protect the lives of our hostages who deserve every protection that we can give them.\n\n“Mary” Ebtekar, Hostage-Taker (archive): The hostages are in our hands, and we are ready so that in the case of any military intervention, we will destroy them.\n\nTITLE SEQUENCE\n\nBarry Rosen, Press Attaché U.S. Embassy: I first came to Iran in August of 1967 as a Peace Corps volunteer. I knew nothing about Iran. I had to run over to the map and find it.\n\nArchive Narrator (archive): This is the Middle East where three continents join. At the hub of this junction is Iran, formerly known as Persia. Iran is a country of contrast. It is actually a land of great wealth and of great interest. In biblical times, a great civilization thrived here and left the marks of its splendor.\n\nBarry Rosen, Press Attaché U.S. Embassy: I looked forward to going to the Peace Corps. It was something about actually finding yourself more than knowing the culture you were going into. I was religious as a young child, I went to a Hebrew day school, yeshiva. Ah, kind of traditional. Maybe two years of excitement out there somewhere doing something might make some difference in people's lives, but maybe most of all my own. I think I was thinking that more than anything else. After our three months of studying Farsi and customs of Iran and reading about Iran, I was then sent to Tehran. We flew directly to Tehran from New York. My job was to teach English at the police academy in Iran. I was told by members of the Peace Corps that Jewish kids did very well in Iraq, and I felt to a certain degree there was a certain warmth there that I could see in my own family. And there was a certain sense of kinship that I felt for Iranians. I was trying to learn as much Farsi as possible.\n\nArchive Narrator (archive): You listen, then you repeat. You listen, then you repeat. Listen, repeat. Pasada Ton Cajara.\n\nBarry Rosen, Press Attaché U.S. Embassy: I loved walking into the bazaar. Miles and miles and miles of different stands, all of the same products piled together. There I used to experiment with what they call bargain chunasa, the hitting of chins, that’s what it means. All this was part and parcel of the life force of of Iran. As a Peace Corps volunteer. I felt, you know, I was, accepted. I was really accepted.\n\nNewsreel Narrator (archive): Tehran, the glittering capital of Iran, prepared itself for the coronation day, such as it had never before witnessed, even the magnificence of its mosques was overshadowed by the spectacular preparations that transformed the city into a wonderland of color befitting the greatest day in the life of the Persian monarch.\n\nBarry Rosen, Press Attaché U.S. Embassy: During the time I was in Iran, that was the Shah's coronation as a Shahanshah. He was the king of kings.\n\nNewsreel Narrator (archive): After 26 years of steering his country from what he described as a nation of beggars into a thriving and prosperous realm, the shah was ascending the fabled Peacock Throne to crown himself king of kings.\n\nBarry Rosen, Press Attaché U.S. Embassy: When he became king in 1941, he said, I don't want any coronation, his father abdicated, until and when I think I am ready and when the country is ready for it. By ’67, he said, I am ready. He was consolidating his power. But he was, in fact, a dictator, there's no doubt about it. I don’t think there was anti-Americanism at that time that was palpable. But I have to tell you that throughout my Peace Corps years, I was able to get enough of a background even then to know what was irking Iranians about the United States. The ’53 coup was talked about in Peace Corps training. The issue of Mossaddegh came up and the idea of knowing more about Mossaddegh was something that always seemed to stir my curiosity about what was going on in Iran.\n\nEric Severide (archive): One of the new books about the CIA, Mr. Dulles, makes the claim that in Iran a few years ago, at the time of Mossaddegh, the CIA people spent literally millions of dollars hiring people to riot in the streets and do other things to get rid of Mossaddegh. Is there anything you can say about that?\n\nAlan Dulles (archive): Well I can say that the statement that we spent many dollars doing that is utterly false.\n\nGary Sick, National Security Council Staff: I knew about ’53 and the coup that overthrew Mossaddegh, with the help of British MI6 and the American CIA. I knew a lot of people who were in the CIA, or I met people who were involved in organizing it, and some of them became friends of mine at the time of the revolution.\n\nGarrick Utley (archive): It’s almost 30 years ago. How do you feel about it when you look back?\n\nKermit Roosevelt, CIA Agent (archive): Well, I feel terribly sorry about what has happened in Iran recently, but I don't think it was predictable then. And if I had to do it all over again, I would still do it without without regret.\n\nGary Sick, National Security Council Staff: I didn't understand at the time the degree to which Iranians felt that this was really a fundamental turning point. And I think everybody in the White House at the time of the hostage crisis was equally ignorant.\n\nBarry Rosen, Press Attaché U.S. Embassy: The most democratic period in postwar Iran was between 1941 and 1953. Iran was a budding democracy.\n\nStephen Kinzer, Author: Mossaddegh came to power as the embodiment of a popular movement based on two principals: democracy and nationalism. Democracy meant rulers should be elected leaders, and the Shah should just be a symbol of the nation like queen of England and not make political decisions. Nationalism meant, we have to take control of our oil\n\nNewsreel Narrator (archive): The world's largest oil refinery at Abadan, Iran becomes the center of a major international crisis as Iran's parliament voted unanimously to nationalize a vast oil fields - fields which by lease are owned by the British government.\n\nStephen Kinzer, Author: The British built the biggest oil refinery in the world at Abadan on the Persian Gulf. It was an immense facility. It was a classic colonial enclave. All the British administrators lived in nice houses with trimmed lawns. There were swimming pools.\n\nThere were restaurants, tennis clubs, all the amenities of home. Meanwhile, Iranians were living in some of the most miserable conditions of any people on Earth.\n\nBarry Rosen, Press Attaché U.S. Embassy: Iranian workers were living in hovels. The Brits controlled the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company since 1906, and the Iranian governments were getting mere pittance of profit. Mossaddegh wanted Iran to be independent.\n\nStephen Kinzer, Author: Mossaddegh, with the overwhelming support of the Iranian people, the Iranian political class and both houses of the Iranian parliament, signed a bill nationalizing Iranian oil. In other words, he seized control of an asset that the British considered theirs.\n\nBarry Rosen, Press Attaché U.S. Embassy: This was the first time that anyone in the Middle East had ever done anything against imperial powers, colonial powers.\n\nNasrollah Entezam, Iranian Ambassador To United Nations (archive): For 50 years, the oil resources of my country have been exploited by a foreign company whose profits have gone overseas. The time has now come to put an end to these painful practices and to put Iran's natural resources to use of the well-being and benefit of her own people.\n\nLord John Wilmot, British MP (archive): This agreement with the Anglo-Iranian oil company has meant immense benefits for the people of Iran. And it's a tragedy really that this thing should have been torn up in the way that it has.\n\nStephen Kinzer, Author: The British froze Iranian assets that were being held in British banks. They imposed what we would today call economic sanctions on Iran. At one point, they considered an actual invasion.\n\nBritish Reporter (archive):I'd like to introduce Mr. and Mrs. Sutcliffe who’ve just flown into London Airport here on the airlift from Abadan. And how were things there when you left Mr. Sutcliffe?\n\nMr. Sutcliffe (archive): Well, they’re not too good. People are all packing up, packing all their belongings.\n\nStephen Kinzer, Author: The British then took Iran to the world court in The Hague.\n\nBritish Barrister (archive): The present actions and threats of the Iranian government may render it impossible to execute a judgment in favor of the United Kingdom.\n\nStephen Kinzer, Author: The British then, with all of these measures failing, brought Iran to the U.N. Security Council. Britain was in a rising panic.\n\nMohammad Mossaddegh (archive): I am glad to come to the United States to defend to the Security Council the cause of my country. (in French)\n\nStephen Kinzer, Author: When Mossaddegh came to the United Nations in 1951, it was the first time that the leader of a country that was poor, developing and possessed resources that the West was exploiting, ever got to speak to the world on such a stage.\n\nMohammad Mossaddegh (archive): Speaking (in French)\n\nStephen Kinzer, Author: Mossaddegh spoke about the injustice that poor countries feel at having their resources exploited for the benefit of imperial powers and tied his struggle to that of other nations in the world. He went to Philadelphia and he posed alongside the Liberty Bell, he asked to visit Mount Vernon, George Washington's home. He was trying to make a point to Americans that they should be on his side because he was only doing what Americans had themselves done several generations earlier.\n\nWilliam Bradford Huey (archive): Why are we losing ground in the Middle East?\n\nAmbassador Henry Grady, U.S. Ambassador To Iran (archive): Because the people of the Middle East feel that we are not sympathetic to their problems. That we are supporting a colonial policy on the part of the British.\n\nWilliam Bradford Huey (archive): And when you say we there, you mean the United States?\n\nAmbassador Henry Grady, U.S. Ambassador To Iran (archive): Yes.\n\nWilliam Bradford Huey (archive): Our own government.\n\nHarley Burt (archive): What's the greatest trouble spot in the Middle East?\n\nIran at the moment. And I think there are tensions all through the Middle East because of a coming up of nationalism, which I think can be quite legitimate.\n\nBarry Rosen, Press Attaché U.S. Embassy: He was, in fact, made Man of the Year by Time magazine. The Truman administration backed him solidly. Because in Truman’s mind, the United States was anti-colonial.\n\nStephen Kinzer, Author: Truman was sympathetic to the anti-colonial idea. But in the end, people like Mossaddegh, who first of all refused to fully embrace the American cause in the Cold War, and secondly were involved in movements aimed at weakening the power of giant multinational corporations, became enemies of the United States.\n\nHarley Burt (archive): Uh, do you see the trend toward nationalization, this thing that occurred in Iran, spreading through the Middle East.\n\nAmbassador Henry Grady, U.S. Ambassador To Iran (archive): I see no indication of this yet, but nationalization, like any other movement, it could spread.\n\nStephen Kinzer, Author: It was a period of considerable disillusionment when many of these countries came to realize that the United States was not going to come to their aid and in fact was seeing them as dangerous threats.\n\nGary Sick, National Security Council Staff: The CIA, initially at the time of the coup, had basically come to the conclusion that we could change governments in different countries - throwing out one government and putting in another. That any government in the world was potentially susceptible.\n\nAnd they were quite confident of that.\n\nGarrick Utley (archive): The planning for your mission occurred as the Truman Administration was ending and the new Eisenhower Administration was coming into office. What did John Foster Dulles and the others tell Truman?\n\nKermit Roosevelt, CIA Agent (archive): They didn't tell him anything. The planning didn't actually take place until after the election.\n\nStephen Kinzer, Author: John Foster Dulles, who became his Secretary of State, and his brother, Allen Dulles, head of the CIA, were pushing Eisenhower from the very beginning to realize Mossaddegh as a threat. At a National Security Council meeting, Eisenhower asks Dulles to explain why we should be overthrowing this guy who's not a communist. He wonders why we can't do things that make people in poor countries like us instead of hate us. But in the end, Eisenhower was persuaded to go along. Eisenhower assigned the CIA to overthrow Mossaddegh, and the person it chose was the Middle East chief of CIA operations, Kermit Roosevelt.\n\nKermit Roosevelt, CIA Agent (archive): I had convinced myself that all you needed to do was to make it clear to the Army and to the people that there was a conflict between Mossaddegh and the Shah. And that was what I set myself to do, to dramatize conflict.\n\nStephen Kinzer, Author: As long as Mossaddegh was in power, the Shah was going to be more of a symbolic figure than someone who exercised real authority. So the CIA had decided that the outcome of the coup should be we place the Shah back in power. He'll be so grateful to us, he'll do everything we want. Which all turned out to be true. The problem was that the Shah was so afraid to get involved that he wouldn't agree to participate in the coup. He was afraid it would fail and then he would have to leave the country. By that time, British and American agents had devised a plan. But the coup was orchestrated from inside the American embassy in Tehran.\n\nStephen Kinzer, Author: Kermit Roosevelt and his CIA crew began bribing Iranian newspaper editors, columnists and publishers. They were printing all sorts of scurrilous denunciations of Mossaddegh, all of a sudden. Mossaddegh was a Jew, a communist, a homosexual, a British agent - anything you could imagine that would blacken his reputation. The CIA bribed mullahs to give sermons denouncing Mossaddegh. One way he could destabilize the government was to show people in Iran that Mossaddegh had lost control of public safety. The capital city was exploding in terror and chaos. Mossadegh didn’t want to send police out to crush protests because he believed that protest was everybody’s right. He didn’t understand that these protests were all being fomented by somebody in the basement of the American Embassy. People began to think Mossaddegh couldn't control the streets.\n\nGary Sick, National Security Council Staff: I remembered quite vividly that the Shah had fled to Italy. He got cold feet and ran. It looked like the whole coup was falling apart and was not going to work. Then within 24 hours, it got turned around and Mossaddegh was overthrown.\n\nNewsreel Narrator (Archive): The stay of the Shah of Persia and Queen Soraya in Rome was of short duration. For first reports of Dr. Mossaddegh having won a victory but quickly reversed. And from the turmoil of Tehran, news came that the royalist coup had been successful after all.\n\nStephen Kinzer, Author: Mossaddegh gave himself up soon after the coup. He was placed on trial. At the Shah's order, he was sentenced to home imprisonment from essentially the time of his release from prison in the mid 1950s until his death in 1967.\n\nBarry Rosen, Press Attaché U.S. Embassy: After ’53 in the coup, yes, the Shah had political parties and all that, but they really had no power. The real power was always in the Shah's hand.\n\nGary Sick, National Security Council Staff: From that point on, the Iranian people felt that the Shah was clearly beholden to the United States and pretty much assumed\n\nthat anything that the Shah did, he was getting orders from Washington.\n\nGarrick Utley (archive): The Shah once told you, I owe my throne to God, my people, the army, and to you, Kermit Roosevelt.\n\nKermit Roosevelt, CIA Agent (archive): Well, he didn't say Kermit Roosevelt. I chose to interpret it as including the British, the United States and me to some extent.\n\nGarrick Utley (archive): But he said it to you.\n\nKermit Roosevelt, CIA Agent (archive): He said it to me. Yes.\n\nGary Sick, National Security Council Staff: My first visit to Iran had to be about 1959. I was a very junior naval officer accompanying a delegation of senior military advisors. The Shah was, in fact, carrying out reforms which on the surface of them at least looked very attractive. This was a period in the ‘50s and ‘60s when this whole idea of take off, of countries putting lots of money into development, building institutions, building infrastructure, and then a country got to a certain point and suddenly, magically it would lift off. I mean, this was very popular stuff in those days. The Shah was doing the kinds of things that Western academics and Western politicians saw as as useful, and so Iran was getting ready for takeoff.\n\nBarry Rosen, Press Attaché U.S. Embassy: The shah was introducing what he called the White Revolution, as opposed to the red revolution, a communist revolution. The White Revolution, it was a revolution from the top.\n\nBernard Kalb (archive): Your Majesty, what are the basic points of your revolution?\n\nThe Shah (archive): Land reform. To fight and combat illiteracy in the country. And, uh electoral reform. The drive and the move is so tremendous that everybody in this country will have to confine itself to this new society that we are trying to build.\n\nBarry Rosen, Press Attaché U.S. Embassy: All these things were very revolutionary in Iran, going against Islamic law, going against the clerical class. It was an attempt to remake Iran. This meant land reform, parceling out pieces of land. But what happened is that dirt poor peasants could not really survive with those pieces of land and they were bought up by the wealthier people or Iranian oligarchs. And people were moving to the cities because of that, what you had was the growth on the periphery of Tehran of tin towns, and the saying in Persian ‘paper cities’ of the poor. And so you had a lots of dislocation of people.\n\nStephen Kinzer, Author: It was at this moment that Khomeini emerged in the early 1960s as a protester against the White Revolution. One of the main reasons was resentment at the Shah's servility to the United States. He was seen as a pillar of Western power who had sold out the interests of Iran in ways that Mossaddegh had refused to do.\n\nBarry Rosen, Press Attaché U.S. Embassy: Khomeini made himself out as this Gandhi-like figure. And he started this in 1963 against the United States military. United States military had immunity. That is, if any American soldier would hurt an Iranian, he would be judged by an American court, not by an Iranian court. Khomeini made hay out of that one and accused Americans of controlling the Shah. All of a sudden, there was this movement afoot and demonstrations against the Shah all over Iran.\n\nGary Sick, National Security Council Staff: We started the process after 1953 of building up a security service, the Iranian SAVAK. The CIA taught the SAVAK how to function. And of course the Shah had the military. So in the uprising in 1963, the Shah cracked down and killed a number of people. And from Washington's perspective, this was confirmation, if you like, that a strong man in place in Iran would take care of the problem.\n\nBarry Rosen, Press Attaché U.S. Embassy: After his criticism against the Shah, for being so corrupt, the Shah said that he had to leave. And Ayatollah Khomeini was sent to Iraq. So the idea is we're going to get rid of him forever.\n\nThe Shah (archive): There are some isolated priests with whom I had to take some strong measures.\n\nBarry Rosen, Press Attaché U.S. Embassy: It was a very tumultuous time in Iran in the 1960s. But there was also this feeling that Iran was moving out of poverty too. There was a sense of movement up, and the Shah felt very secure at that time.\n\nBritish Reporter (archive): This is celebration time, and here at Persepolis in the middle of the Iranian desert, it's been decreed that the 25th centenary of the founding of Persia has to be a suitably memorable occasion. For three days, his Imperial Majesty, the Shahenshah Iliama of Iran, will be setting himself back some lavish 15 million pounds or so for what’s obviously going to be one of the most fantastic parties that the world has ever seen. And all of it against this Hollywood-type background of 2,500 years of Persian military history.\n\nThe Shah (archive): Oh the dancing…\n\nHilary Brown, Foreign Correspondent: I was invited to accompany the Canadian Governor General on his plane to Persepolis. This was this extraordinary 2,500 anniversary of the Persian Empire. It was unprecedented. It got into the Guinness Book of Records, you know, for the amount of money spent, for the guest list which was, you know, heads of state from around the world, royalty. I mean, it was billed as the biggest party in history. We had absolutely no idea that so many people, you know, thought this was wrong. And of course, as we realized later, it probably sowed the seeds of the Shah’s downfall.\n\nFrench Architect (archive): So here we are in the club. We’ll put a bar here with easy chairs. You are going to have a piano here to have some smooth music.\n\nBritish Reporter (archive): What about down here?\n\nFrench Architect (archive): Down here it’s a salon…\n\nHilary Brown, Foreign Correspondent: They imported French architects and decorators and couturiers to design and build and furnish these tent- like suites. They flew in 50,000 songbirds from Europe to provide a morning chorus for the illustrious visitors. And all these birds later died. They couldn't take the blistering heat. And the guests were all heads of state or royalty. There were no ordinary Iranians there at all. It was just the invited guests, the Shah and the Shahbanu and the press.\n\nFrank McGee (archive): We may be sitting in on a television first this morning. Barbara Walters is in Iran, she’s been there all week as a matter of fact. And this morning she will bring this all to us via satellite.\n\nBarbara Walters (archive): It’s a blazing hot afternoon, late afternoon, here in Iran. And the most exciting part of a celebration that was planned 13 years ago is about to begin. The 5,000 soldiers are going to be marching in their ancient costumes behind us, with their shields and their spears, for what is an event unequaled in world history.\n\nHilary Brown, Foreign Correspondent: The event itself, the purpose was really to glorify the Shah. Shahanshah, King of Kings, Light of the Aryans, Shadow of the Almighty. And to celebrate 2,500 years of unbroken rule, which of course was not the case, but that was the illusion. The banquet had something like seven courses including crayfish mouse and peacock’s tongue stuffed foie gras. 2,500 bottles of fine wine. The banquet took five and a half hours to consume. The Ayatollah Khomeini described it as the ‘Devil's festival’. You know there were people in the country weren’t getting enough food to eat.\n\nGary Sick, National Security Council Staff: I remember as a young naval officer in the Pentagon, a whole group of us were brought into a room and were shown this movie that had been prepared as a result of the Shah's huge Persepolis blowout.\n\nRobert Stone: Why was this being shown at the Pentagon?\n\nGary Sick, National Security Council Staff: I have no idea.\n\nOrsen Welles (archive): In celebration of 2,500 years of nationhood, the Persian people led by their Shah, his Imperial Majesty Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, Ayamir, Shahenshah, make homage at the tomb of Cyrus the Great, the first Shah of all.\n\nHilary Brown, Foreign Correspondent: So it was all show, it was all show. And you know there was no opposition to him that he was aware of. The Shah had surrounded himself with sycophants who told him what he wanted to hear.\n\nThe Shah (archive): From me, the Shah of Iran… (in Farsi)\n\nPresident Nixon (archive): Your Imperial Majesty, as you leave this capital after your visit here, I believe that the relations between Iran and the United States have never been better. That is due to your leadership. It's due also to the fact that we feel a special relationship not only to your country, but to you. A relationship which in my case goes back many years.\n\nGary Sick, National Security Council Staff: Nixon came into office at a time when the British had just decided to withdraw from the Persian Gulf. And this was a big deal because the British actually were responsible for maintaining stability in the Gulf. And so everybody assumed, okay, the British go, the Americans will step in and take over responsibility.\n\nThe Shah (archive): As you very well mentioned, our relations have never been as good as they are now because they are based on an absolute trust and mutual interests.\n\nGary Sick, National Security Council Staff: The idea of the Americans stepping in and assuming responsibility for the stability of a whole area that was clearly not an easy one to deal with, at a time when we were fighting a war in Southeast Asia, was sort of unthinkable. And Nixon really understood that. He knew that the American people were just not going to buy it. So he and Henry Kissinger came up with the idea of the Twin Pillar Policy, which was that the\n\nUnited States would, in effect, arrange with Iran to protect our interests in the region and take on that responsibility, based on deterring a Soviet move to the Persian Gulf. So we would cooperate with the Shah to protect American security interests. And the second pillar was Saudi Arabia. We would cooperate with the Saudis to make sure that oil policy stayed reasonably stable.\n\nPresident Nixon (archive): I would say that today American ties with Saudi Arabia have never been stronger and have never more solidly been based than they are now.\n\nGary Sick, National Security Council Staff: So those were our twin pillars in the region. And that was agreed to by Nixon and Kissinger meeting with the Shah in 1972.\n\nPresident Nixon (archive): And we know, Your Majesty, that the talks that I should be privileged to have with you will provide counsel and wisdom also for the cause of peace and progress for all people to which you have dedicated your life and a cause with which we, all the people of the United States, are honored to cooperate with you. Thank you.\n\nGary Sick, National Security Council Staff: When Nixon was sitting across the table from the Shah in this meeting, asking the Shah to take on responsibility for American interests in the region, Nixon looked across the table at the Shah and said to him, ‘protect me’. This is the President of the United States talking to the Shah of Iran. He was protecting us. It was a blank check for military equipment, with the exception of anything to do with nuclear weapons or delivery systems.\n\nAnything else below that, including the highest technology fighters and everything else we produced, our answer would be yes.\n\nReporter (archive): At every airbase in Iran, fully armed jet fighters wait outside their blast proof hangar's. These drills go on every day. Iran sees herself as surrounded by unstable and not so friendly neighbors. And the Shah of Iran sees his massive investment in modern weapons as an absolute necessity.\n\nThe Shah (archive): I think that the reasons are there, loud and clear. I'm not taking any chances.\n\nHilary Brown, Foreign Correspondent: He was the biggest single buyer of American weapons in the world.\n\nBritish Reporter (archive): Each of these planes costs around five million dollars. While the West seems only too delighted to fuel the Shah's military ambitions, his growing war machine looks absurdly disproportionate to his defense needs, a positive danger to stability in the Gulf.\n\nGary Sick, National Security Council Staff: He was obsessed with military hardware. And he was very smart, he was very knowledgeable. And the White House would back up the Shah and give him whatever he wanted, because that was what we had promised him.\n\nReporter (archive): As commander in chief, why is it that you need a fighter-bomber force of 300 planes? Why do you need 700 helicopters, 1,700 tanks? Where exactly is the threat, the demands of a war machine of this size?\n\nGary Sick, National Security Council Staff: I basically was hired at the National Security Council because the Shah was spending so much of his wealth on military equipment that everybody was worried all the way up and down the line, and this was up to the level of the White House by this time, that he was creating trouble for himself by not paying enough attention to his domestic constituents. The United States had been worried about this from day one.\n\nThe Shah (archive): I think that we can say very firmly and with absolute certainty that Iran will not only become an industrial nation, but in my assessment in 12 years time enter what we say ‘the era of the Great Civilization’.\n\nGary Sick, National Security Council Staff: The Shah desperately wanted the price of oil to go up. He needed the money to carry out his very ambitious development plans.\n\nWhen the massive breakthrough in terms of oil prices took place\n\nin the 70s, he quit taking orders from us entirely. Suddenly, the Shah was one of the richest people in the world. He had tremendous resources to work with, and price went sky high.\n\nBarry Rosen, Press Attaché U.S. Embassy: He was supposedly our friend, our ally. But at the same time he had his own sense of independence. “I am the Light of the Aryans, and so why can't I start squeezing the American economy.”\n\nMike Wallace (archive): And the huge sums of money piling up with the oil producers?\n\nThe Shah (archive): Well, it's new to you. It's maybe a little shock at the beginning, but you are going to get used to it.\n\nBarry Rose, Press Attaché U.S. Embassy: In the early 1970s, I remember people were lining up all the time to get gasoline and the prices were going higher and higher and the Shah was part of that process, leading OPEC in raising the prices of oil.\n\nReporter (archive): As the fuel shortage continues to grow. the strongest suggestion to come from Capitol Hill is for an all out crash program, like the one to put a man on the moon, as a way to solve the energy crisis.\n\nGary Sick, National Security Council Staff: It was a huge shock all at once and completely upset the finances of most countries in the world who had to import their oil.\n\nHilary Brown, Foreign Correspondent (archive): OPEC members will continue to meet and set oil prices as they see fit. This will almost certainly mean more expensive gasoline in the United State.\n\nHilary Brown, Foreign Correspondent: My husband was a BBC correspondent, and he was in 1972, he was asked to open the first BBC bureau in Tehran. It is a very interesting period for us. We lived there in what we now call the bad old days of the Shah, but in many ways it was a fantastic time.\n\nHilary Brown, Foreign Correspondent (archive): Hillary Brown, ABC News, Tehran.\n\nHilary Brown, Foreign Correspondent: On the surface, the country seemed very, very westernized. Oil revenues went up enormously under the Shah. Western businessmen were doing business in Iran, and it was said that the Pahlavi's took a 15 percent cut of any contract that was signed in Iran.\n\nBarry Rosen, Press Attaché U.S. Embassy: A good deal of corruption started. And the Pahlavi's themselves, that Mohammad Reza Shah was the head of, owned a great deal of real estate. A lot of the oil money started to move in that direction. There was no accountability at all.\n\nHilary Brown, Foreign Correspondent: He was certainly a celebrity, and his wife was extremely beautiful. They sparkled, they were very glamorous and that added to their allure. You know, the extravagance of the Pahlavi's and their court were well known. But the middle class, the Iranian middle class did like him.\n\nArchive Narrator (archive): Tehran, a waterhole when Persia was mighty, and now the capital of the new Iran. The tempo here is much the same as in any other city. The traffic just as thick. The working population, equally burdened by office hours and the clock. The miniskirt is here, with all its consequences.\n\nHilary Brown, Foreign Correspondent: The role of women in Iran in the Shah's Iran was pretty unique. And the Shah's father, Reza Shah, actually began the sort of emancipation of women when he abolished the veil.\n\nCarole Jerome, Foreign Correspondent: The Shah’s efforts to emancipate women had actually started with his father, who did it by force. He tried to liberate women by having his soldiers ride along on their horses and rip their chadors from them. And the women were terrified. That really wasn’t the way to bring Iranian women into the new century. The Shah did it a different way, what he chose to do was to educate women and give them a possibility to take part in society as educated citizens, as professionals, as lawyers, as doctors.\n\nHilary Brown, Foreign Correspondent: Under the Shah, they introduced equal rights in marriage and divorce, pretty much abolished polygamy, because Iranian men could have four wives if they wished, raised the legal marriage age to, I think, 16 from 13. They could drive, and they did. Hold public office, go to university and wear Western dress, which they did with great flair, wear makeup. And they had the right to vote and they also had rights to abortion. So, yes, they were relatively free under the Shah. What was different and strange in the Shah's Iran was the security police and the degree to which people were watched.\n\nReporter (archive): Your Majesty, there's been considerable criticism in certain segments of the foreign press about political repression, censorship, the role of the security police in controlling potential opposition in Iran.\n\nThe Shah (archive): My only answer is that, who cares? They can say whatever they want.\n\nHilary Brown, Foreign Correspondent: Iran under the Shah was a police state, I mean, a very nasty police state, and with a secret service known as the SAVAK which was everywhere, which was all pervasive. There were SAVAK informers absolutely everywhere.\n\nMike Wallace (archive): Why do you need a SAVAK at all? Why do you need this secret police?\n\nThe Shah (archive): What? Everybody has. Who has who hasn't got a secret police?\n\nBritish Reporter (archive): Filmed secretly, the political prison of Evin, its cells and torture chambers buried underground. One girl was sent there for owning a copy of The Thoughts of Mao Zedong. For months, they asked her a single question, “Who gave you the book?”\n\nAnonymous Woman (archive): They started to torture me. They flog and they hang me from a ceiling. They shocked with electric shock.\n\nBritish Reporter (archive): They hung you from the ceiling?\n\nAnonymous Woman (archive): Yes, here by the hand, by the writs. For three months they tortured me about 38 or 40 times, every morning and every afternoon.\n\nHilary Brown, Foreign Correspondent: I don't think we really ever understood just how all pervasive and terrifying SAVAK was for ordinary Iranians. They lived in a perpetual state of fear and paranoia because there were so many informers. They knew that they could be arrested at any moment just for a single slip of the tongue or a misplaced word. And part of SAVAK’s role was to elicit criticism, to provoke someone into saying something that could be vaguely critical of the monarchy, for example. Then they would be arrested or disappeared or tortured or even executed.\n\nHilary Brown, Foreign Correspondent: In 1975, when the Shah was at the peak of his powers, ABC thought that, you know, we should go in and do a series of stories on Iran, on pro-Western, pro-American Iran, and they thought that I'd be the person to do it because, you know, I had lived there. I was then ABC’s first female correspondent. So we started off with an interview with the Shah. You know, the Shah had to know about these abuses since nothing was done without his orders.\n\nHilary Brown, Foreign Correspondent (archive): Your Majesty, you were speaking of activities in the Gulf, subversion…\n\nHilary Brown, Foreign Correspondent: And I began by asking the sort of softball questions about the economy, his ambitions to turn Iran into a great nation. And then I sort of switched to the less convenient questions about the arrest of dissidents who have criticized you for your policies.\n\nThe Shah (archive): But there is no opposition to the regime except those who are the terrorists. Yes, we have. We have them.\n\nHilary Brown, Foreign Correspondent (archive): You're saying that there's no opposition.\n\nHilary Brown, Foreign Correspondent: And then I moved into the question of human rights.\n\nHilary Brown, Foreign Correspondent (archive): I know you've been frequently questioned about allegations of torture practiced by your secret police, and I must ask you this because it does concern Americans. Could I refer to an article in The Sunday Times which describes an instrument of torture called ‘the hot table’, which is said to be used by SAVAK. And they say that it's an iron frame covered with wire mesh that's electrically heated like a toaster. And prisoners would be strapped to the table while it was heated until it became red hot. Do you have any comment to make on that? I mean it’s a terrifying allegation…\n\nThe Shah (archive): Is it really something that you will ask in a television interview from a responsible man like me?\n\nHilary Brown, Foreign Correspondent (archive): Yes, I think you're precisely the person I should ask about it.\n\nThe Shah (archive): It’s so rubbish that I'm not even going to bother to answer to you.\n\nHIlary Brown, Foreign Correspondent (archive): It’s rubbish. Uh huh. The article also referred to the trial of an engineer who was tried, and the trial was attended by a couple of French lawyers. And they say that this man showed them the scars from such a table.\n\nThe Shah (archive): Where?\n\nHilary Brown, Foreign Correspondent (archive): Here in Tehran.\n\nThe Shah (archive): Where? Where were, the scars, where?\n\nHilary Brown, Foreign Correspondent (archive): On his back and on his chest\n\nThe Shah (archive): You can't scratch yourself very easily.\n\nHilary Brown, Foreign Correspondent (archive): No, the lawyers said…\n\nThe Shah (archive): The lawyers. Which kind of lawyers? Really honestly, never heard anything like this. But you are really exaggerating. This is not serious this kind of interview. I'm not going to answer to you any more.\n\nHilary Brown, Foreign Correspondent (archive): Fine. Well, perhaps we could go on to something else.\n\nThe Shah (archive): No. I’m finished.\n\nHilary Brown, Foreign Correspondent (archive): Oh, please Your Majesty.\n\nThe Shah (archive): I'm finished with you. It’s ridiculous.\n\nHilary Brown, Foreign Correspondent (archive): Don't you think we must ask you this sort of thing?\n\nThe Shah (archive): No.\n\nHilary Brown, Foreign Correspondent (archive): Well, can I ask you about your personal sense of mission, which you obviously have\n\nThe Shah (archive): I'm not going to answer to you anymore.\n\nHilary Brown, Foreign Correspondent (archive): You are so used to these questions,\n\nThe Shah (archive): Not from…\n\nHilary Brown, Foreign Correspondent (archive): Don’t you think that…\n\nHilary Brown, Foreign Correspondent: The Shah then got up, shook my hand and walked out.\n\nBarry Rosen, Press Attaché U.S. Embassy:\n\nFor the first time in Iranian history a Shah tried to control everything. Shahs before him didn’t try to control everything. They controlled parts of society, but not everything. The United States made a deal with Iran, with the Shah explicitly, that we would not interfere in internal politics in Iran. And this was an active ingredient in U.S. Iran relations up and until and including Jimmy Carter. Our destiny was set. We were with the Shah and there was no other way out.\n\nBarry Rosen, Press Attaché U.S. Embassy: After I came back from the Peace Corps, I was invited through a friend to go to Kennedy Airport to be part of the inaugural ceremony of the new 747 jumbo jet.\n\nBarbara Rosen, Wife of American Hostage: There was a singles gathering on the 747s when they first came out, and it was at Kennedy Airport. And as I walked through the plane, Barry, he approached me and said, “is that an Iranian blouse you're wearing?” Sort of set the stage for what our whole life is going to revolve around. He was a graduate student at Columbia going for his doctorate in Iranian studies, and I was just a person from Brooklyn. And I never met anyone like that and it was very intriguing. When we started dating, he spoke a lot about the Peace Corps and how much he loved Iran and what a beautiful country it was. And it was just so amazing all of the things that he had done. Eventually, Barry and I, we got married.\n\nBarry Rosen, Press Attaché U.S. Embassy: I was always interested in that part of the world, but always specifically wanted to get back to Iran. And I wanted Barbara and the kids to feel what I felt about the place. The opportunity arose to serve as the press attache at the U.S. embassy in Tehran. And that meant a whole bunch of problems in terms of Barbara’s and my life because I had to train in Washington and she had to move to Brooklyn. But I was committed to go back to Iran.\n\nDavid Brinkley (archive): The Shah of Iran arrived in the US today, coming to Washington tomorrow. He says if the United States wants a strong ally on the Persian Gulf, it ought to be glad he is building a huge, formidable military machine.\n\nBarry Rosen, Press Attaché U.S. Embassy: During this time, I said, well, you know, the Shah’s coming, I'd like to see what's going on.\n\nWalter Cronkite (archive): Mr. Carter won't be the only one greeting the Shah in Washington.\n\nIranian Student Leader (archive): Shah is a US puppet! Down with the Shah!\n\nCrowd Of Iranian Students (archive): Shah is a US puppet! Down with the Shah!\n\nIranian Student Leader (archive): Shah is a fascist butcher! Down with the Shah!\n\nCrowd of Iranian Students (archive): Shah is a fascist butcher! Down with the Shah!\n\nIranian Student Leader (archive): US get out of Iran!\n\nCrowd of Iranian Students (archive): US get out of Iran!\n\nIranian Student Leader (archive): US get out of Iran!\n\nCrowd of Iranian Students (archive): US get out of Iran!\n\nGary Sick, National Security Council Staff: When the Shah arrived in Washington, his visit was preceded by days and days of groups of Iranian students across the street from the White House just bombarding us with noise.\n\nCounter-Protester (archive): Iran is a leader in the fight against communist aggression around the world.\n\nReporter (archive): At least five planeloads of pro-Shah demonstrators are arriving in Washington, along with over 400 Iranian military men who are in training here in the United States.\n\nIranian Counter-Protesters (archive): We love the Shah! Long live Shah!\n\nReporter (archive): And there have been ads in major American newspapers in support of the Shah. Just who is paying for all of this is somewhat of a mystery.\n\nIranian Counter-Protesters (archive): Long live Shah! Long live Shah!\n\nBarry Rose, Press Attaché U.S. Embassy: The Iranian government sent in their own people as a counterweight against these student protesters, students who felt that they had no voice in Iran.\n\nGary Sick, National Security Council Staff: The students, of course, wore masks so that SAVAK couldn't identify them and know who to come after.\n\nBarry Rosen, Press Attaché U.S. Embassy: I stood there and I was trying to listen, and then there was this cloud of tear gas. I couldn't really see anything. It was a fiasco.\n\nGary Sick, National Security Council Staff: They got out of control, and so the police used some tear gas to quell the crowds.\n\nPresident Jimmy Carter (archive): This morning, our nation and its people are indeed honored to have visiting us from Iran His Imperial Majesty and Empress Farah.\n\nGary Sick, National Security Council Staff: And that tear gas came wafting over the lawn. Everybody was coughing and sneezing. I was in one of the front rows audience and it was my very first experience with tear gas.\n\nPresident Jimmy Carter (archive): Your Imperial Majesty we welcome you to our country.\n\nGary Sick, National Security Council Staff: The Shah was up there trying to make his speech and wiping his eyes.\n\nThe Shah (archive): Mr. President, Mrs. Carter…\n\nReporter (archive): Oh God!\n\nThe Shah (archive): Thank you very much for your very warm words of welcome.\n\nCrowd of Iranian Students (archive): Down with the Shah! Down with the Shah!\n\nGary Sick, National Security Council Staff: It was certainly my first acquaintance with the fact that there were a lot of young Iranians who were very, very unhappy with the Shah and his rule.\n\nCrowd of Iranian Students (archive): Down with the Shah! Down with the Shah!\n\nReporter (archive): For 30 minutes, they fought one another and police, moving back and forth across the Ellipse behind the White House.\n\nIranian Counter-Demonstrator (archive): The Shah should kill them one by one.\n\nReporter (archive): It took police reinforcements and tear gas to end the fighting, but not until more than 80 people have been injured.\n\nBarry Rosen, Press Attaché U.S. Embassy: For me, it was one of the first portents of things are not going right. This movement within Iran that I kept reading about from early on. But look what happened here in Washington where everybody is protected from what's going on.\n\nGary Sick, National Security Council Staff: You go through these things. It's not that it didn't register. It did register. I mean, this this was a very powerful moment. But it doesn't translate into saying that this ruler is doomed. You looked at that group of people clustered across the street from the White House and you put that against a well-oiled regime with lots of soldiers and the like, and it was going to take more than that to bring him down.\n\nReporter (archive): The Shah told reporters he wasn't bothered by the demonstrations.\n\nThe Shah (archive): The nature of these demonstrations shows that they are violent. They are nihilistic. They are working for world disorder.\n\nTerrorism. And we are not a weakling that is going to fall.\n\nGary Sick, National Security Council Staff: We met in the Cabinet Room and Carter apologized for this, was clearly embarrassed and aggrieved that this could happen to a guest that was there. They sat down and immediately began talking high policy and military security and across the board.\n\nReporter (archive): The Shah of Iran said last night that President Carter talked him into changing his position from one of neutrality on keeping oil prices down to a position of activism.\n\nEd Bradley (archive): In a shift from his earlier public pronouncements, the Shah said Iran would fight any efforts to increase the price of oil. It's now thought that the Carter administration will seek congressional approval for the Shah’s request for sophisticated military equipment.\n\nPresident Jimmy Carter (archive): Some have asked why we came to Iran so close behind the delightful visit that we received from the Shah and Empress Farah just a month or so ago. After they left our country, I asked my wife, with whom would you like to spend New Year's Eve? And she said, above all others, I think, with the Shah and Empress Farah. So we arranged a trip accordingly.\n\nGary Sick, National Security Council Staff: We didn't see any demonstrations in Tehran. There were people along the road all the way in, and at no point along the way were we confronted with protesters at all.\n\nPresident Jimmy Carter (archive): Iran, because of the great leadership of the Shah, is an island of stability in one of the more troubled areas of the world.\n\nThis is a great tribute to you, Your Majesty, and to the respect and the admiration and love which your people give to you., Iwould like to offer a toast, and to the world peace that we hope together we can help to bring.\n\nGary Sick, National Security Council Staff: The Iranian revolution started in January of 1978, within weeks of when Carter was actually in Tehran. The irony of course was enormous.\n\nGary Sick, National Security Council Staff: In January of 1978, the Shah and SAVAK published an article accusing Khomeini of being a British agent, ahomosexual, a lot of things. And there was outrage about this. It led to these demonstrations. And a number of people were killed. In Shia Islam, there's a tradition that after a death, you wait for forty days and you have a commemoration. There would be another demonstration. More people would get killed, and 40 days after that there would be another.\n\nReporter (archive): The government says that the death toll is officially 97. The people here at this funeral say it was 10 or 20 times that just in Tehran alone.\n\nGary Sick, National Security Council Staff: It was actually this 40-day interval that set off this series of demonstrations that got bigger and bigger as the year went along.\n\nBarry Rosen, Press Attaché U.S. Embassy: I was ready to go to Iran with the family early November of 1978. But I was held back by Washington and told there might be a restriction in bringing families.\n\nBarbara Rosen, Wife of American Hostage: By the time we were ready to go, the revolution started. Families were told not to go, Barry was told not to go. I think he delayed until almost Thanksgiving and then he was sent.\n\nBarry Rosen, Press Attaché U.S. Embassy: And I said, well, looks like I'm going to have to go without the family. But I was duty bound, I needed to go. By the time I arrived in Iran, Ambassador Sullivan had already started to move American families out. Many, many members of corporations and businesses were leaving.\n\nPeter Jennings (archive): Martial law has been declared in 12 cities, including the capital. Just after it was imposed, government troops fired on demonstrators in Tehran. They were defying a ban on public protest.\n\nBarry Rosen, Press Attaché U.S. Embassy: The military had already shot into Iranian crowds, in September of 1979 in Jaleh Square. Killed many people.\n\nPeter Jennings (archive): 58 people were killed and more than 200 wounded in today's bloodshed.\n\nBarry Rosen, Press Attaché U.S. Embassy: The situation was becoming somewhat untenable, and no one really knew what was going to happen. My office was about a half a mile away from the embassy. I would spend time walking around and trying to see what was happening during the revolutionary period, and so I walked one day to the university. The faculty was having a slideshow on what was happening to the people who had been protesting. Men blown up. Women shot in the head. It went on and on. People were crying in the audience. It was nothing fit for children, but children were there with their parents. It knocked me out. It really knocked me out. And I remember writing a cable to Washington about this and saying, how can we be here and support the Shah under these circumstances that was so absolutely disgusting?\n\nReporter (archive): Millions marched in the streets of Iran protesting the rule of the Shah. Violent and bloody clashes escalate between the Shah's militant opposition and his martial law soldiers. Oil workers strikes impose nationwide fuel rationing, stop oil exports, and Iran goes to the brink of economic collapse. In each case, the calls for mass protests were issued by this aged man and Iranians eagerly obeyed him.\n\nCarole Jerome, Foreign Correspondent: I was the producer for the CBC bureau in Paris when Khomeini arrived in France from exile in Iraq. The Shah had made the mistake of thinking that if he was out of the Middle East, he wouldn't be able to meddle so much in Iranian affairs. It was a huge mistake because then all of a sudden Khomeini had all of the Western media right at his doorstep. Literally.\n\nRobert McNeil (archive): To protect him from possible assassination, the French police are providing heavy round the clock security.\n\nPeter Jennings (archive): Khomeini was, by most accounts, a relatively obscure religious teacher until his outspoken opposition to the Shah's modernization program led to his exile in 1963. He may hold more power over the fate of Iran than any other single individual.\n\nRobert McNeil (archive): What have the Americans done to you that you object to?\n\nIbrahim Yazdi Translating for Khomeini (archive): The American government, they have committed the biggest crime by imposing on our people the Pahlavi dynasty.\n\nCarole Jerome, Foreign Correspondent: Some of his lieutenants had been calling the Western press in Paris to publicize what they were trying to do in bringing down the Shah and this revolution they were running.\n\nReporter (archive): How far must the Shah now go before you're able to call for peace? What must he do?\n\nSadegh Ghotbzadeh translating for Khomeini (archive): He has no place in Iran anymore. He perhaps has become wise and has understood that the sooner he goes it is better for himself and for the Iranian people.\n\nSadegh Ghotbzadeh, Aide to Ayatollah Khomeini (archive): Mr. Carter and the other…\n\nCarole Jerome, Foreign Correspondent: That was my first introduction to the Iranian Revolution and to the people who were running it and especially Ghotbzadeh. I first met Sadegh Ghotbzadeh when he came to the CBC bureau to be interviewed by me. We had a relationship in Paris which carried on. I have to confess that I fell for him the minute I met him. He was really quite an extraordinary, charismatic and impressive person.\n\nSadegh Ghotbzadeh, Aide to Ayatollah Khomeini (archive): We want to be free and leave alone to decide for ourselves.\n\nCarole Jerome, Foreign Correspondent: And that was the beginning of a long personal relationship I had with him. Being with Sadegh meant I had an understanding at a personal level of what was happening with the different factions and rivalries especially across the moderates who could not get their act together. Ghotbzadeh and Bani Sadr and Ibrahim Yazdi. They were the secular leaders of the revolutionary movement who had been working for the revolution for a long, long time in exile.\n\nBritish Reporter (archive): Can you tell us how it could be in Britain's interest to support your cause against the Shah?\n\nCarole Jerome, Foreign Correspondent: They realized they weren't going to overthrow someone as powerful as the Shah of Iran without the help of the mosque. A lot of them of the moderates were almost willfully blind to what Khomeini really represented because they wanted so badly for this revolution to work. But they completely underestimated him.\n\nJohn Chancellor (archive): The Ayatollah Khomeini, who says he will establish a new Islamic government, is a tough and prejudiced man. He has written, “we want a ruler who would cut off the hand of his own son if he steals and would flog and stone his near relative if he fornicates.”\n\nCarole Jerome, Foreign Correspondent: One of Khomeini's main objections to the Shah was his emancipation of women. So we women who were reporters really saw from the outset what this man was like.\n\nBarry Rosen, Press Attaché U.S. Embassy: The big spark in the revolution came from mullahs distributing Khomeini's cassettes from Paris. These hardcore mullahs were willing to oppose the Shah and they had connections with the poorer people, the ones who were trodden upon. They were going to lift up Iran. The Shah didn't understand that for most of his reign, he destroyed the liberal opposition so devastatingly that there was no opposition but the religious opposition. They are well-organized and they’re there to tell the Shah “You’re gone. You're not going to survive. “\n\nGary Sick, National Security Council Staff: I'm watching everything going on in Iran during this time and relaying what I learned to the President. And we had this discussion. Things aren't looking good, but the reality is the Shah has a 400,000 man army, superbly equipped with everything you could possibly imagine. And the opposition appears to be a bunch of clerics operating out of the mosque, for the most part, unarmed. Oh, well, who would you bet on?\n\nPresident Jimmy Carter (archive): We have confidence in the Shah. We support him and his efforts.\n\nBarry Rosen, Press Attaché U.S. Embassy: It seemed clear to me that there was a split amongst the White House, the State Department and people on the ground, that is many of us at the embassy. The Shah of Iran had one of the largest armies in the world. The officer corps was devoted to the Shah, but most of the soldiers were conscripts from the villages. Two-year service. These were the ones who were used to fire on their own people.\n\nBarbara Walters (archive): Your Majesty, there were reports that your army may be disloyal to you. Are you concerned about this?\n\nThe Shah (archive): The Army? How could that be possible?\n\nBarbara Walters (archive): So the army you feel certain about? You feel loyalty?\n\nThe Shah (archive): If it was so, it would be the end of the country.\n\nBarry Rosen, Press Attaché U.S. Embassy: Ambassador Sullivan was talking about the issue in a long memo, Thinking the Unthinkable, where he outlined the possibility that the Shah may not survive, but that the most important thing was to keep the army intact. Thinking the unthinkable means we need to keep Iran working with us, even if there's a change in government. Whereas National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski was not in favor of hearing that. He was thinking about the survivability of the Shah.\n\nGary Sick, National Security Council Staff: Brzezinski was an unreconstructed cold warrior, so I think he did see the Iranian revolution in Cold War terms. He was tough, he was competitive to the nth degree. As an example, he had a picnic for the members of the National Security Council staff and he said, why don't we have a soccer match? I was the goalie actually on Brzezinski's side and the game began and what everybody realizes is that everybody else was wearing sneakers and the like. And Brzezinski had showed up in combat boots. He was not a lovable character.\n\nGary Sick, National Security Council Staff: We had long conversations about what was going on in Iran and we came to the same conclusion every time. Yes, there was trouble, but the Shah had the capacity to deal with it if he chose to do so. We misjudged him tremendously. The Shah wanted everybody to believe in the image that he created for himself. He worked hard at that. And where we were really wrong in our intelligence analyses is that the Shah was unwilling, deliberately unwilling, to take the kind of severe action that was necessary to stop the revolution.\n\nJudy Woodruff (archive): There are persistent reports tonight that the Shah of Iran will indeed leave the country, there's an Iranian radio says he will go for medical treatment and relaxation.\n\nThe Shah (archive): It’s been a long time….. (in Farsi, needs translation)\n\nBarry Rosen, Press Attaché U.S. Embassy: January 16th, 1979. He goes to Mehrabad Airport. He's met by a member of the military. The officer tries to kiss his feet. And he's given a small little chest of the earth of Iran. That was the last time he ever saw Iran in his lifetime.\n\nGary Sick, National Security Council Staff: The amazing thing is how fast. Hundreds of years of Iranian history and it's all over in a year.\n\nBarry Rosen, Press Attaché U.S. Embassy: The entire city of Teheran went wild. Absolutely celebratory. People were just overjoyed.\n\nReporter (archive): At the Ayatollahs headquarters outside Paris, the word is that he's going.\n\nIbrahim Yazdi (archive): Ayatollah has made the following statement on the occasion of his departure.\n\nSadegh Ghotbzadeh translating for Khomeini (archive): Maintenant, apres quatre mois que je reside en France, j’ai quitte ce pays pour servir mon pays.” (Now, after four months of staying in France I am leaving to serve my country.)\n\nCarole Jerome, Foreign Correspondent: Those of us who were part of the press corps in Paris, we all had the possibility of getting on that plane. And I was one of those who was issued a ticket.\n\nCBC News Anchor (archive): Sunday morning’s Carole R. Jerome is on the Air France 747 with Khomeini.\n\nCarole Jerome, Foreign Correspondent (archive): It's tempting to try to imagine the feelings of Khomeini right now as he sits up there ahead of us. During the weeks we've seen him at his exile headquarters in France, we have never seen him smile or show the slightest sign of emotion. Sadegh Ghotbzadeh says he is calm right now.\n\nCarole Jerome, Foreign Correspondent: There were many, many journalists on that flight. This is an historic moment and we felt very fortunate to be on that plane.\n\nCarole Jerome, Foreign Correspondent (archive): None of us are really very sure of just what awaits him and us down there. We've touched down.\n\nCarole Jerome, Foreign Correspondent: When the Ayatollah set foot again in Iran, someone said to him, as he came off the plane actually, “how do you feel now you're back in Iran after so many years in exile?”He said, “nothing”. He said he felt nothing.\n\nBarry Rosen, Press Attaché U.S. Embassy: I've never seen a crowd that large, and that exuberant, and that in love with someone.\n\nBritish Reporter (archive): It's extraordinary how one man can command such adoration, how so many people can believe that this frail old priest holds all the answers to Iran's problems.\n\nAyatollah Khomeini (archive): I will appoint the government with the help and support of this nation since the people have accepted me. (in Farsi)\n\nCarole Jerome, Foreign Correspondent (archive): This is a day of victory. But there is a grim sullenness here too. It's not over yet.\n\nCarole Jerome, Foreign Correspondent: There must have been 10 million people there. And we realized, this is what a revolution looks like. This is it.\n\nBritish Reporter (archive): The army, once loyal to the Shah, has now declared itself neutral and the soldiers have been ordered back to their barracks.\n\nBritish Reporter (archive): Army barracks were plundered and guns distributed almost like confetti. They ransacked police stations and commandeered abandoned tanks. The atmosphere was euphoric. Gunmen were everywhere.\n\nBarry Rosen, Press Attaché U.S. Embassy: The police force was totally disorganized, really didn't play a part in Iranian society at that time.\n\nCarole Jerome, Foreign Correspondent: It was anarchy. They often say if you put five revolutionaries in a jail cell together, they'll emerge with six different points of view. There were so many factions.\n\nBritish Reporter (archive): A mass of people this size may look united and purposeful, but on the ground it's a shifting and volatile coalition of different and sometimes conflicting groups.\n\nCarole Jerome, Foreign Correspondent: There were first the Muslim students. They wanted this Islamic Democratic Republic. And Bani Sadir, and Ghotzbadeh and the\n\nother moderates had been part of that. There was the Mujahedeen Khalq, basically Warriors of God who were very far left, fanatical extremists. There was the Fedayeen, another Islamist group that was more Marxist. There was the Tudeh, the Moscow- backed Iranian Communist Party. And at first you had certain pro-Shah groups. But they just melted away very, very quickly. It was like being a reporter with a camera crew at the French\n\nRevolution. It's as though you were there at the guillotine with your camera.\n\nBarry Rosen, Press Attaché U.S. Embassy: Most of the executions were televised. Whether it was a former member of SAVAK, whether it was the former prime minister of Iran, Hoveyda, and a large coterie of generals, they were being executed day in and day out by revolutionary courts. One of the worst of all was Ayatollah Khalkhali. He was called the Hanging Judge. And you knew once you were in front of him, you were a dead man. Vigilante's, gangster-like guerrilla forces, were all over Tehran. There were these battles going on. And your incidents around the embassy that were becoming very, very tense.\n\nJames Roberts, Colonel, U.S. Army, Retired: February 14th, 1979, we were witnessing massive demonstrations. I was a trained intelligence officer settling into the embassy in Tehran. There were long throngs of crowds chanting in the street, “Long Live Khomeini”, “Death to the Shah”, though the Shah was already gone, and “Death to America”.\n\nBarry Rosen, Press Attaché U.S. Embassy: I was with the ambassador at his desk when all of a sudden, a rocket propelled grenades fly through his window. Put a hole in the wall about ten feet wide.\n\nJames Roberts, Colonel, U.S. Army, Retired: When we were under direct attack, we asked the ambassador, “should we return fire?” He said, “no”.\n\nFrank Reynolds (archive): This has been a dark, indeed a devastating day for the United States in Iran. An embassy seized by an armed mob.\n\nBarry Rosen, Press Attaché U.S. Embassy: Within moments they were upstairs. I surrendered the embassy, I said, “We give up.”\n\nJames Roberts, Colonel, U.S. Army, Retired: And they marched us out into the main parking lot and stood up against the wall. It would have been easy for us all to have been shot right there.\n\nPeter Jennings (archive): It was certainly an interesting Valentine's Day at the American embassy compound, left wing Iranians stormed it, Khomeini's man rescued them\n\nJames Roberts, Colonel, U.S. Army, Retired: A negotiation occurred and we were, quote, free, unquote. But we still had these Iranian government officials in our midst.\n\nReporter (archive): The United States embassy here is in the hands of Iran's revolutionary forces. The embassy is being guarded by Ayatollah Khomeini's ragtag militiamen.\n\nJames Roberts, Colonel, U.S. Army, Retired: That first takeover was absolutely unprecedented. Diplomats are supposed to be off limits to the political vagaries of what's going on in the country where they're assigned.\n\nBarry Rosen, Press Attaché U.S. Embassy: Throughout history, embassies represent the place where the interchange of cultures and societies and politics takes place between nations. It is a sacrosanct area.\n\nGary Sick, National Security Council Staff: Valentine's Day was a warning of what we were up against. Embassies operate on the trust that the government around them will protect them. And if they don't, there's very little that you can actually do. You cannot turn the embassy into a fortress and have it defend itself against the whole country.\n\nBarry Rosen, Press Attaché U.S. Embassy: Between February 14th and November 4th, 1979, the level of violence was enormous. It was a maelstrom of insecurity.\n\nIranian Demonstrators (archive): Magbar America! Magbar America! (Death to America! Death to America!)\n\nReporter (archive): Anti-Americanism, particularly among the leftists, has flourished because of what is perceived by many as President Carter’s too strong and too long support of the Shah\n\nArmed Protester (archive): We are not opposite with the American people. We are opposite with government, American government all over the world. We are opposite. And we want to kick out all imperialism. We want this country for ourselves.\n\nJames Roberts, Colonel, U.S. Army, Retired: I came back to the States and was debriefed by a number of agencies. My advice was we should break our diplomatic relations, close the compound, too big, too visible, too much bad blood. I was convinced that our relationship was going to continue to deteriorate.\n\nReporter (archive): There's been a lot of speculation about where the Shah himself and his empress might stay in the United States, and this is one of the places considered very likely. It's the estate of publisher Walter Annenberg in Palm Springs, California.\n\nBarry Rosen, Press Attaché U.S. Embassy: When the Shah left Iran, he had requested that he go to the United States. There was this debate in Washington. The ambassador said it would be a big mistake to do it. The decision to accept the shah was rescinded. The shah was asked to find another place to go.\n\nGary Sick, National Security Council Staff: Well, initially, he flew to Egypt and met with Sadat.\n\nReporter (archive): This is probably the Shah's first stop on his road to exile. He invited himself to Egypt, officials said, and President Sadat went along perhaps with some nudging from the U.S.\n\nGary Sick, National Security Council Staff: He then flew on to Morocco. The king of Morocco was a friend. But he way overstayed his welcome and eventually the United States had to come and quietly suggest that maybe he ought to move on. He left there and went to the Bahamas.\n\nReporter (archive): Your Majesty, can you say how long you intend to stay here?\n\nThe Shah (archive): No, I'm afraid not. But it’s a beautiful place.\n\nReporter (archive): Do you expect to settle permanently here, sir?\n\nThe Shah (archive): We are visiting.\n\nGary Sick, National Security Council Staff: He hadn't told anybody that he was ill. He kept that a secret at the risk of his own life. It was only while he was in exile in Mexico that we discovered that he was apparently dying. And he needed medical treatment urgently. Carter was faced with a situation about bringing the Shah into the country. And, he called a meeting, Vice President Secretary of the Defense, Secretary of State, etc. One after another, they went around the room telling the president that for political reasons he simply couldn't say no to the Shah. And in the end he said, “well OK, I hear what you're a saying. You’re all unanimous that we should let the Shah come in. But I wonder what you are going to tell me when they take our people hostage in Iran.”\n\nJohn Chancellor (archive): The Shah of Iran is in a New York City hospital tonight. An American government source in Washington says the deposed Iranian monarch is suffering from cancer and a blocked bile duct. The Shah arrived last night after getting special approval from the US government to be treated at New York Hospital, Cornell Medical Center, one of the country's best hospitals.\n\nBarry Rosen, Press Attaché U.S. Embassy: When we heard that the decision was made to permit the Shah to come to the United States, we were astonished. Why did they not listen to us?\n\nIranian Crowd (archive): Magbar America! Magrar America! (Death to America! Death to America!)\n\nBarbara Rosen, Wife of American Hostage: The families, as well as the people who were in the embassy, always felt that if the Shah was truly a sick person and needed to be admitted to the United States for medical reasons, that was legitimate. However, we also all felt families, as well as people at the embassy, that they should have been evacuated before the Shah was admitted to the United States. There was no reason to keep the embassy open knowing the threats that had been made against our people.\n\nJohn Bierman (archive): It may seem like paranoia to the rest of the world, but from everything the Ayatollah, his followers and the press have been saying, it seems they really do believe that the Shah's sickness is just a cover, and that he's in the United States to plot a counter-revolution with the Americans.\n\nBarry Rosen, Press Attaché U.S. Embassy: Conspiracy theories within Iran are rampant. And they're based in some fact. They're based on 1953 on the coup against Mossaddegh. Many people were saying this is the United States doing it once again, the CIA will bring the Shah back. And he will murder us all. For those students, Following the Line of the Imam, who were preparing already for something to happen, who already were coalescing and meeting, and they had groups of people organized in different ways, this was a perfect conspiracy.\n\nReporter (archive): The embassy is occupied by about 400 students. On the outside there are a number…”\n\nReporter (archive): His name is Barry Rose, Press Attaché U.S. Embassy: , he’s the Embassy’s press attache….\n\nBarry Rosen, Press Attaché U.S. Embassy: I only served in Iran all these many years because I cared so much for a culture and a people who I really admired. I said to myself, why am I a prisoner. Why isn’t Henry Kissinger? Why me?\n\nGary Sick, National Security Council Staff: As far as the Iranian people were concerned we were just as guilty as the Shah about anything that happened. So when Americans asked, “why do they hate us so much?”, which was a reasonable question, it just meant we had very short memories. You didn’t have to go back more than 30 years to figure out why they didn’t like us.\n\nCrowd (archive): Death to America! Death to America! (in Farsi).\n\nReporter (archive): The American embassy in Tehran is in the hands of Muslim students tonight.\n\nEd Bradley (archive): They are holding hostages, one report says as many as 100, most of them American.\n\nTed Koppel (archive): The State Department has set up a special task force\n\nSam Donaldson (archive): Here in New York. Iranian students chained themselves to the Statue of Liberty.\n\nAustralian Reporter (archive): The reaction in New York, whether or not it's a coincidence, has been the occupation of the Statue of Liberty.\n\nReporter (archive): The demonstrators draped a banner demanding the United States return the Shah to Iran.\n\nBarbara Rosen, Wife of American Hostage: My mother in law, she would keep the radio on all night. And it was the first thing that she heard.\n\nSam Donaldson (archive): Latest reports say as many as 90 Americans may be involved, others say as few as 35.\n\nBarbara Rosen, Wife of American Hostage: We hadn't had any calls from the State Department. It just came across as a news report. And the government would not release the names of any of the people being held.\n\nReporter (archive): At a news conference inside the compound we were shown photographs taken yesterday of U.S. marine guards at the embassy after they were taken prisoner and blindfolded by their captors.\n\nOutside the compound, “Give us the Shah!\" they cried, and we will free the Americans.\n\nReporter (archive): The U.S. does not have a great number of options in dealing with what is a very sensitive situation in which there is no central authority. But one thing is certain, there will be no bowing to the mob's demand for the return of the Shah.\n\nHodding Carter (archive): In answer to the question, are we considering handing him over or are there any plans to do so or to meet that demand? The answer is no.\n\nReporter (archive): Your Highness, could I talk to you for just a moment? How is your husband?\n\nQueen Farah (archive): He's fine. Thank you.\n\nReporter (archive): Because of what's happened in Iran, would you consider going to another country for treatment?\n\nAmerican Protesters (archive): Burn! Burn! Burn!\n\nAmerican Student (archive): They invaded a sacred part - the embassy. An embassy is a sacred part of any nation. That's what they invaded. The Ayatollah is condoning this. And we want him!\n\nAmerican Protesters (archive): Fuck the Ayatollah! Fuck the Ayatollah!\n\nBarbara Rosen, Wife of American Hostage: There was demonstrations in the United States against Iran. Americans were very angry, and rightly so.\n\nAmerican Protesters (archive): Go home! Go home! Go home!\n\nReporter (archive): Despite a police ban, up to a thousand Iranian and anti-Iranian demonstrators massed in Beverly Hills, the Iranians outnumbered\n\nand targets of violence. There is little sympathy for Iranian students supporting the takeover.\n\nJohn Johnson (archive): Given the fact that most of the Iranian students here in the United States are receiving the benefits of an American education and at the same time supporting your student counterparts in Iran who are holding Americans hostages, the American public has begun to ask, should you be allowed to stay in the country?\n\nAmerican Protester (archive): I think the Iranians, if they don't like our government and they don't like our system, I think they need to go back to Iran.\n\nAmerican Protester (archive): We’re sick of being stomped on! We’re not gonna take it anymore! We’re sick of it! America! America!\n\nBarbara Rosen, Wife of American Hostage: 1979 was a time in American history when we weren't feeling very good about ourselves. The Vietnam War had ended in a terrible evacuation of our people from the embassy. I remember the images of people clawing to get on the last helicopters going out. The economy was not doing very well. Everything in the country was like negative, negative.\n\nReporter (archive): A gasoline shortage led to violence over the weekend in Levittown, Pennsylvania, just outside Philadelphia\n\nDavid Brinkley (archive): A new study shows the American people spend one fourth of their entire personal income on buying and operating cars and trucks.\n\nPresident Jimmy Carter (archive): It is a crisis of confidence. It is a crisis that strikes at the very heart and soul and spirit of our national will.\n\nGary Sick, National Security Council Staff: America had just been battered from one side to another. We have another oil crisis so that basically people are waiting at the pumps. The economy was tanking. Everything seemed to be going wrong at the same time. And this simply added to that sense.\n\nReporter (archive): Any encouraging news from Iran Mr. President?\n\nPresident Jimmy Carter (archive): No.\n\nReporter (archive): Status quo, sir?\n\nPresident Jimmy Carter (archive): Yes, I’m afraid so.\n\nReporter (archive): President Carter's special two man diplomatic mission to Iran remains stalled in Turkey.\n\nReporter (archive): The spokesman tried to counter a spreading bleak impression that all diplomatic trails have led to a dead end.\n\nBarbara Rosen, Wife of American Hostage: The America who you know of John F. Kennedy could go to the Moon, all of a sudden we can't do anything right and here’s our people being held hostage in Iran. And again, we can't do anything.\n\nHilary Brown, Foreign Correspondent: Initially, it wasn't easy for anybody to get into Iran in the first few days after the seizure of the hostages. But then the Ayatollah and his supporters realized that this was a wonderful way to get the world's attention. And a wonderful platform for their anti-American message was to let the press in. So then the press corps came in in droves and I was among those people who were allowed in.\n\nHilary Brown, Foreign Correspondent (archive): At the embassy today, the reaction to the U.N. resolution…\n\nHilary Brown, Foreign Correspondent: What made it riveting was that they had been able to do this, that they've been able to seize American diplomats and, you know and the odd marine, and hold them hostage inside the American embassy, which they had occupied, 3000 of them apparently, in total defiance of international law.\n\nCarole Jerome, Foreign Correspondent:\n\nI received a phone call one morning in my hotel room. It was this voice saying this is the student followers of the imams line. We are calling you from the Nest of Spies to tell you to be here at nine o'clock because we have revelations to make. It was rather haunting to know that the American hostages were right there within shouting distance, but we could do nothing for them. We were taken in to one of the marine guard huts, I believe it was, where the students would hold their press conferences.\n\nStudent Hostage Taker (archive): The main reason of our occupation in United States embassy is to attack to America and its actions and the expulsion of Shah from America.\n\nCarole Jerome, Foreign Correspondent: They were very naive if they thought that the United States could just hand the Shah over.\n\nStudent Hostage Taker (archive): If the America doesn't answer to our demand we will never release the hostages and we will never release the embassy. In case if United States decide to do something to release these hostages, you must be sure that they will definitely be killed.\n\nCarole Jerome, Foreign Correspondent: I'm not even sure they fully understood that seizing the embassy was an act of war.\n\nGary Sick, National Security Council Staff: As far as we knew, everybody in the embassy had been taken. For the first 72 hours it was basically just what we could get from our intelligence sources, which of course was limited.\n\nReporter (archive): At the State Department, a special working group was on duty around the clock trying to monitor developments in Iran. But there's a tremendous sense of frustration…\n\nGary Sick, National Security Council Staff: We had a report from the Iranians actually covering the event, that the son of Ayatollah Khomeini came to the embassy and climbed over the wall, lost his turban, and then got in and announced the Iranian government was fully behind the people who took the hostages. And at that point, it was very clear that until Khomeini changed his mind or decided to do something\n\ndifferently, that the people were there to stay. People in the West don’t appreciate just how shocking this was not just to us, but even to people in Iran.\n\nAustralian Reporter (archive): Well here in Washington, there's a real sense of humiliation and depression, and I think above all, helplessness. The president has no intention of handing over the Shah. I think that the bottom line may be that the only hope for a solution here is that the Ayatollah, that he may come around to reason…\n\nGary Sick, National Security Council Staff: At that point we realized that this was going to be a marathon, not a sprint. I told my family that basically they had lost me until this was over. You were basically dedicating yourself to something. I actually felt like it was sort of taking religious orders.\n\nPresident Jimmy Carter (archive): The actions of Iranian leaders and the radicals who invaded our embassy were completely unjustified. They and all others must know that the United States of America will not yield to international terrorism or to blackmail.\n\nJames Q. Roberts, Colonel, U.S. Army, Retired: There were a number of terrorist incidents in the mid to late 70s.\n\nReporter (archive): Six guerrillas stormed the OPEC offices with a barrage of submachine gun fire just before noon today. Three men were killed. The terrorist issued a host of…..\n\nJames Q. Roberts, Colonel, U.S. Army, Retired: Hostage taking it became a cottage industry.\n\nWalter Cronkite (archive): Waiting in the sweltering heat of a metal aircraft, hostages are the 20th century equivalent of the Barbary pirates.\n\nJames Q. Roberts, Colonel, U.S. Army, Retired: There was the hijacking of a Lufthansa aircraft that went to Mogadishu. There was the Munich Olympics hostage-taking and disastrous results there.\n\nReporter (archive): Five Arab commandos carrying submachine guns climbed the Olympic compound fence, broke into the Israeli team's quarters, shot and killed two Israelis and held nine others hostages all day and into the night.\n\nJames Q. Roberts, Colonel, U.S. Army, Retired: So there was definitely a whole series of events that attracted military professionals because these events began to create that demand among Western governments for the building of a specialized hostage rescue forces.\n\nGary Sick, National Security Council Staff: The idea of a rescue mission was discussed within hours after the taking of the hostages. I was not involved in that planning process, but I was aware that it was was going on.\n\nJames Q. Roberts, Colonel, U.S. Army, Retired: Military planning began right away. I was called, I think within the first three or four days. They were looking for people who spoke Farsi, who knew the embassy, folks who would be able to help get an assault force that deep inside Iran and that deep inside a city of six million people without being discovered.\n\nThe next day, I flew to Washington. I told the guy that picked me up, ‘I can tell you right now you can count me in.’\n\nJames Q. Roberts, Colonel, U.S. Army, Retired: The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff pulled together a small group of planners in the Pentagon. They put a new cipher lock on the door. They shut it off from everybody else. But the planning started immediately. The control of the number of people exposed was draconian.\n\nBarry Rosen, Press Attaché U.S. Embassy: In the beginning, I assumed the United States Air Force was going to come in and maybe bomb Abadan, make it incrementally difficult for Iran to export anything. And maybe that would stop them. But again, the question would be, would they take it out on us?\n\nMassoumeh “Mary” Ebtekar, Hostage Taker (archive): The CIA had various agents as embassy personnel to each of whom a cover was assigned so that the true nature of his job would not be exposed.\n\nFrank Reynolds (archive): In one respect, at least the Iranians have succeeded, you might say, because they have forced themselves into the consciousness of this country. And they have made it very difficult, if not impossible, for the highest officials of this government to deal with anything else.\n\nTV Announcer (archive): This is an ABC News Special. The Iran Crisis. America Held Hostage.\n\nGary Sick, National Security Council Staff: This was the story of the year. And it was the only story of the year in many respects because it just kept coming at you day after day. And that has effected us ever since.\n\nHilary Brown, Foreign Correspondent: It led to huge audience ratings. The appetite that the American viewing audience has for news was kind of discovered with this story.\n\nFrank Reynolds (archive): It’s Saturday morning there and we are going to switch live to Tehran…\n\nPeter Jennings (archive): Iranians are well aware that these demonstrations are being seen in American living rooms. Some of them actually believe they will convince Americans to see the Shah and the embassy occupation as they Iranians see it.\n\nJames Q. Roberts, Colonel, U.S. Army, Retired: The long and the short of it is that terrorism is theater. It's political theater. You're drawn to the events like bugs to a light. We watched every inch of footage of the guards, of the people around the embassy, of their demeanor, of their military training, of how they were holding their weapons, of where their guard posts were, trying to get an ever more accurate picture of the situation around the embassy walls as well as any pictures that we could get from inside the embassy.\n\nBarry Rosen, Press Attaché U.S. Embassy: The students became quite sophisticated in bringing in media people, bringing in officials. They would say, ‘ok I want your room cleaned up and you sit down there and smile. And we will do stills and have videographers coming in. The Iranians were trying to make a point that we were treated well. And there were posters all over about what America had done to Iran. It was just everywhere. They knew that they were the center of all the news that could be used by the government and by foreign press.\n\nBarbara Rosen, Wife of American Hostage: As time goes on I also became very angry that there were American reporters who were standing outside the embassy giving them a platform in the United States. We shouldn’t have been there.\n\nHilary Brown, Foreign Correspondent: Yeah. Of course, we realized that we were being played. Yes. We were providing a daily platform for them, for their anti- American grievances. There is a kind of symbiotic relationship between the hostage-takers and the press. It worked both ways, I suppose, in that sense. But we had to cover this.\n\nStudent Hostage Takers sung in Farsi(archive):\n\nKhomeini you are the Imam\n\nYou are the manifestation of honor\n\nYou are the one who has sacrificed his life for the cause Human salvation is your motto\n\nDying for righteousness is your glory It is you, the guardian of God\n\nStudent Hostage Taker (archive): I ask them to introduce themselves.\n\nWilliam Quarrels (archive): My name is Sergeant William Quarrels, United States Marine Corps.\n\nAustralian Reporter (archive): Three Americans from among the eighty hostages at the US Embassy in Tehran have been freed by their Muslim captors and are now in hospital in West Germany. Ten others later told foreign reporters that they too would be released later tonight.\n\nWalter Cronkite (archive): Good evening. Ten more American hostages, four women, six black men at the US Embassy in Tehran, prepared this evening to leave Iran having been ordered freed by Ayatollah Khomeini.\n\nAmerican Hostage (archive):\n\nThey indicated that we are being released not as a compromise, but because they felt some type of feeling for us as blacks and women.\n\nCarole Jerome, Foreign Correspondent: Yeah, they thought that would make Americans say, Oh, they're wonderful, folks, they like these other persecuted minorities, blacks and women, they let them free. And they actually thought that would garner them some support in the United States. They actually thought the black people of America would rise up and support them.\n\nVernon Jordan, National Urban League (Archive): The freeing of the black and female hostages in Iran is a cynical attempt to divide the American public. We join today with all Americans in demanding the release of all of the hostages in Tehran today.\n\nMaynard Jackson, Mayor of Atlanta (archive): The recent statement by the Ayatollah Khomeini calling on Afro- Americans to join his struggle against the United States is convincing evidence of how sadly and perhaps how tragically misinformed he is about our country.\n\nCarole Jerome, Foreign Correspondent: Their ignorance of America was only equaled by American ignorance of Iran.\n\nReporter (archive): You've seen it before this week around the country. Today happened in Atlanta, the burning of the Iranian flag.\n\nCarole Jerome, Foreign Correspondent: You've never seen two countries that understood each other so little, even after all those decades of being an alliance, as it were.\n\nMassoumeh “Mary” Ebtekar, Hostage Taker (Archive): The United States is an imperialist power. And it's one of the characteristics of an imperialist power to plant spy dens and spy networks all over a country to control all its major political, social, economical systems, and to control these systems for its own benefits.\n\nBritish Reporter (archive): But are you really saying that the people that you have taken prisoner that you're holding in this building are responsible for that in a way?\n\nMassoumeh “Mary” Ebtekar, Hostage Taker (Archive): We don't say that these hostages are, innocent? No. They were the people through which these crimes, many of them, have been done, and yet…\n\nBritish Reporter (archive): But they’ re still hostages aren’t they? I mean, they were diplomats and they’re now hostages.\n\nMassoumeh “Mary” Ebtekar, Hostage Taker (archive): Well, what does that have to? I mean?\n\nBritish Reporter (archive): I mean that it that is the basis, if you like, of international anger…\n\nMassoumeh “Mary” Ebtekar, Hostage Taker (archive): That is the basis but what about, what about the crimes?\n\nBritish Reporter (archive): …That international law has been broken?\n\nMassoumeh “Mary” Ebtekar, Hostage Taker (Archive): What about what about international law in the case of the crimes that the Shah committed, in the case of 60,000 martyrs we gave in this country?\n\nCarole Jerome, Foreign Correspondent: We all got very curious about Mary. She spoke excellent English and we asked her where she’d learned her English. And she said she learned it in Tehran, but she was lying. Because Mary had been educated in the United States. Mary was not her name. At that time I learned her name was Niloofar Ebtekar. And I gather she since became Massoumeh. She was obviously very dedicated to this revolution that she was a part of and certainly very, very hard line about the hostages.\n\nBritish Reporter (archive): Are you at all worried that there could be some kind of psychological damage to these people that you're holding as a result of their captivity?\n\nMassoumeh “Mary” Ebtekar, Hostage Taker (Archive): Psychological damage to the hostages?\n\nBritish Reporter (archive): Yes, that quite simply, that some of them might, if you hold on much longer, just go mad.\n\nMassoumeh “Mary” Ebtekar, Hostage Taker (Archive): Why should they? I mean, in our prisons at the time of SAVAK, tens of thousands of our most brilliant youngsters were kept in dungeons and tortured. No one cared for their “psychological after effects”.\n\nBarry Rosen, Press Attaché U.S. Embassy: Sister Mary. She was there to interrogate most of us. Accusing us, threatening trials. I had very negative feelings toward her. I just felt that she brought out the worst in me.\n\nPeter Jennings (archive): But you say you will follow the orders of Ayatollah Khomeini…\n\nBarry Rosen, Press Attaché U.S. Embassy: And she had lived in the United States as a young woman. She spoke English. Her English was good enough so that she could speak to reporters. So she was the basic PR person.\n\nMassoumeh “Mary” Ebtekar, Hostage Taker (Archive): The only way is that the American government, led by the criminal Carter, return Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the cause of corruption and the exploitation of the Iranian people. Must be returned to Iran with the property of the Iranian people and must be tried in a court of justice. And this Court of Justice will be the trial of the American presidents of his time as well.\n\nSam Donaldson (archive): Mr. President, can this crisis go on indefinitely? Or ought the Ayatollah Khomeini understand that at some point the American people may demand, and other nations may expect, that you move forward to resolve it by whatever means you find necessary?\n\nPresident Jimmy Carter (archive): It would not be possible or even advisable for me to set a deadline about when or if I would take a certain action in the future. This is an ever present consideration on my mind. I'm carrying out all the duties that normally fall on the president's shoulder, which are adequate. But I never forget one moment that I'm awake about the hostages whose lives and whose safety depend on me.\n\nGary Sick, National Security Council Staff: People were really behind the president. They were prepared to support him. And, you know to be brutally honest, he was taking advantage of that too. Presidents are politicians.\n\nBarbara Rosen, Wife of American Hostage: All the families were invited down to Washington for a meeting and to let us know what was going on. Jimmy Carter and Rosalyn Carter were standing up front in each one of the family members who were there came up and spoke to them for a few minutes. They didn't tell us a whole lot. And I gave them a picture of the two children, and I "
