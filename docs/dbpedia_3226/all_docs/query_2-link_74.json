        "text": "1. Thriller Genres\n\n2. Action Thriller  Action Thriller movies are a bundle of movies that will have you on the edge of your seat!  The aim of action thrillers is to keep you entertained with a brilliant performance or display. They also have amazing storylines and a bit of a twist!  Most action thrillers contain terrorists, psychopaths, exploration and crime fighting.  A action thriller would normally involve a hero and villain, guns and other weapons.  Most action films contain gore and violence such as fighting scenes. The thriller part always contains suspense, murder, mysteries and twists.  An example of an Action Thriller movie is Mission Impossible  Ethan and team take on their most impossible mission yet, eradicating the Syndicate - an International rogue organization as highly skilled as they are, committed to destroying the IMF.\n\n3. Horror Thrillers  A horror thriller usually consists of a conflict between a monster and the main character of the scene. This creates a lot of fear as loads of horror films have POV shots in them so it is as if you are the main character and it is happening to you. Also in horror thrillers they create a lot of suspense and tension until a jump scene will occur which will have you shaking.  Orphan (2009)  The Hills Have Eyes (2006)\n\n4. Psychological Thriller  Psychological thrillers are usually based around conflict between the main characters minds and emotions rather than physical. Action and psychological aspects both are used to add to the suspense. Characters shouldn't win using physical talents or efforts, but rather using their mind, wits or smarts.  Psychological thrillers often deal with common themes such as death, reality, perception, identity, existence or purpose, and one or two of these themes should be wound through the novel.  Psychological thrillers are usually in first person to give the viewers and accurate perspective of the characters mind and thoughts. They also involve flashbacks throughout or at the beginning of the main story to give us more information about the character that will give us a better understanding of him/her and can change our perception of the character.  Examples of psychological thrillers are paranormal activity.\n\n5. Crime Thrillers  crime films focus on a certain crime or set of crimes, and finding out the mystery or tracking down the criminals, with no or small violence but more drama throughout.  Thrillers most of the times are fiction-based and quick in pace, while crime fiction tend to be more leisurely paced, dramatic and realistic. Generally, violence is also lacking in crime fiction.  Crime-thrillers have more threat and suspense in them and may involve spying, many killings and other non-criminal conflicts.  a crime thriller is basically a thriller that concentrates on the impact of a crime on the protagonist.  Crime thrillers are a hybrid type of both crime films and thrillers that shows comprehensive accounts of successful or failed crimes.  An example of an crime-thriller movie is legend.  The film tells the story of the identical twin gangsters Reggie and Ronnie Kray, two of the most notorious criminals in British history, and their organised crime empire in the East End of London during the 1960s. The fact that they are criminals knows that the commit crime so this movie is definitely in crime thriller section.  They terrorize London during the 1950s and 1960s. The relationship that bound them together was one of gruesome violence and crime, one that led to their downfall and imprisonment for life\n\n6. Erotic thrillers  The erotic thriller consists of a thriller, that uses suspense, tension, and excitement as its main ingredients, also with an element of eroticism. The genre became well known in the United States, from the mid-1980s through the early 1990s, before declining in marketability.  in erotic films sometimes the women may be seen as the dominant characters.  The Boy Next Door is an example of an erotic thriller.  When a handsome, charming teenager named Noah moves in next door, newly separated high-school teacher Claire Peterson encourages his friendship and engages in a little bit of harmless -- or so she thinks -- flirtation. Although Noah spends much of the time hanging out with Claire's son, the teen's attraction to her is palpable. One night, Claire gives in to temptation and lets Noah seduce her -- but when she tries to end the relationship, he turns violent.\n\n7. Torture Porn  A gore film is a subgenre of horror film that purposely focuses on graphic portrayals of gore and graphic violence. These films, with the use of special effects, usually display an overt interest in the vulnerability of the human body and the theatricality of its mutilation.  Torture Porn mostly feature over-the-top gore which leave the audience disgusted.  The first appearance of gore in cinema can be traced to D. W. Griffith's Intolerance (1916), which features numerous body touching's, including two onscreen decapitations, and a scene in which a spear is slowly driven through a soldier's naked abdomen as blood wells from the wound.  An example of a torture porn movie is The Human Centipede  A mad scientist kidnaps and mutilates a trio of tourists in order to reassemble them into a human centipede, created by stitching their mouths to each others' rectums. "
