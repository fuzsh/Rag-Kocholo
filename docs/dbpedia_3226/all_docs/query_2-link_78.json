Focusing on ten films that span the range of the twentieth century, from Fury (1936) to Fargo (1996), Thomas Leitch traces the transformation of the three leading figures that are common to all crime films: the criminal, the victim, and the avenger. Analyzing how each of the subgenres establishes oppo- sitions among its ritual antagonists, he shows how the distinc- tions among them become blurred throughout the course of the century. This blurring, Leitch maintains, reflects and fosters a deep social ambivalence toward crime and criminals, while the criminal, victim, and avenger characters effectively map the shifting relations between subgenres, such as the erotic thriller and the police film, within the larger genre of crime film that in- forms them all. Thomas Leitch is Professor of English and Director of Film Stud- ies at the University of Delaware. A contributing editor of Liter- ature/Film Quarterly, he is the author of What Stories Are: Nar- rative Theory and Interpretation and The Encyclopedia of Alfred Hitchcock. GENRES IN AMERICAN CINEMA General Editor Barry Keith Grant, Brock University, Ontario, Canada Genres in American Cinema examines the significance of Ameri- can films in a series of single-authored volumes, each dedicated to a different genre. Each volume will provide a comprehensive account of its genre, from enduring classics to contemporary revisions, from marginal appropriations to international inflec- tions, emphasizing its distinctive qualities as well as its cultural, historical, and critical contexts. Their approach will be method- ologically broad, balancing theoretical and historical discussion with close readings of representative films. Designed for use as classroom texts, the books will be intellectually rigorous, yet written in a style that is lively and accessible to students and general audiences alike.

The stills illustrating this volume came from Jerry Ohlinger's Movie Materials Store and the archives of Literature/Film Quarterly, which Jim and Anne Welsh graciously allowed me to plunder. 1 am grateful to Judith Leitch and Beatrice Rehl for timely technical advice, and to Lisa Elliott for everything else. Finally, I offer my hccirtfelt ap- preciation to the University of Delaware undergraduates who for ten years have helped provoke my thinking about crime films by their will- ingness not only to engage in endless discussions of films noirs and gangster movies, but to sign up for courses with such unlikely titles as Victim Films and Comedies of Crime. Here's looking at you, kids. XV 1 The Problem of the Crime Film The crime film is tiie most enduringly popular of all Hollywood genres, the only kind of film that has never once been out of fashion since the dawn of the sound era seventy years ago. It is therefore surprising to discover that, at least cis far cis academic crit- icism is concerned, no such genre exists. Carlos Clarens's magister- ial study Crime Movies (1980) begins by criticizing Robert Warshow's seminal essay \"The Gangster as Tragic Hero\" (1948) for its narrow def- inition of the gangster film, based on liberal social assumptions that \"limited genres to one dimension apiece.\" Yet Clarens's definition of the crime film is equally delimited by its pointed exclusion of \"psycho- logical thriller[s]\" like Shadow of a Doubt (1943), Laura (1944), and Kiss Me Deadly (1955) from its purview on the grounds that their charac- ters are insufficiently emblematic of \"the Criminal, the Law, and Soci- ety.\"! Lcirry Langman and Daniel Finn place themselves outside the de- bate over whether or not crime films include psychological thrillers by announcing in the Preface to their encyclopedic reference, A Guide to American Crime Films of the Forties and Fifties: \"The American crime film does not belong to any genre. . . . Instead, it embodies many genres. \"2 But their attempt to rise above the problem of cicissification merely indicates how deeply entrenched that problem is. None of this academic quibbling has prevented crime films from re- taining their popularity, or even from entering universities cis the ob- ject of closer scrutiny. But subgenres of the crime film, like the gang- ster film of the 1930s and the film noir of the 1940s, have been more often, and more successfully, theorized than the forbiddingly broad genre of the crime film itself - this genre that is not a genre, even 2 Crime Films though an enormous audience recognizes and enjoys it, and a sub- stantial following is interested in analyzing it critically. The unabated popularity of mystery and detective fiction, the burgeoning of such re- cent literary subgenres as the serial-killer novel and the novel of legal intrigue, the efflorescence of true-crime books, and the well-publicized criminal trials that keep Court TV in business all attest to the Amer- ican public's fciscination with narratives of crime. The crime film there- fore represents an enormously promising, but hitherto neglected, fo- cus for a genre approach to cultural studies. To the question of whether the crime film is a genre or an umbrella term for a collection of diverse genres like the gangster film, the detec- tive film, and the police film must be added another question: What does it matter? After all, what difference does it make whether the film noir is a genre or a subheading of a broader genre? To anyone but a few scholars of genre studies, these questions might seem inconse- quential to the widespread understanding and enjoyment of crime films. It is exactly this understanding and enjoyment, though, that are at issue in the definition of any genre. Raymond Bellour has pointed out that viewers for Hollywood musicals like Gigi (1958) are able to put aside their general expectation that each scene will advance the plot because of their familiarity with the more specific convention of mu- sicals that successive scenes often present lyrical, tonal, or meditative \"rhymes\" instead, so that a scene of Gigi explaining how she feels trou- bled and baffled by love is logiccilly followed by a scene in which Gas- ton professes similar feelings, even if there is no causal link between the two.3 On a more practical level, it is viewers' familiarity with the conventions of the musical that prevents them from cringing in be- wilderment or distaste when the story stops dead so that Fred Astaire can dance or Elvis Presley can sing. Learning the generic rules of mu- sicals does not necessarily allow viewers to enjoy them more, but it does allow them to predict more accurately whether they are likely to enjoy them at all. It is therefore a matter of some importance to many viewers whether or not films like The Wizard ofOz (1939) and Aladdin (1992) are categorized as musicals, for their feelings about musicals are likely to influence how much they will enjoy such films, or whether they are likely to watch them in the first place. This is not to say that only viewers who like musicals will like The Wizard of Oz and Aladdin. Both films, in fact, are well-known for appealing to many viewers who do not ordinarily watch musicals; but appreciative viewers who recog- The Problem of the Crime Film 3 nize either film as a musical are more likely to be receptive to other films that resemble them, confirming the importance of genre in ac- curately predicting their enjoyment. In the same way, asking whether films like Bonnie and Clyde (1967) and The Wild Bunch (1969) are westerns, even if different viewers an- swer the question differently, acknowledges the ways each film's affin- ities to the western - its similarities in mise-en-scene, action, and mor- al problems to those of the western - places them in a context that helps to sharpen and illuminate them. A familiarity with John Wayne's outsized heroic persona in westerns like Stagecoach (1939) and Fort Apache (1948) deepens viewers' understanding of the more problem- atic but equally outsized heroes he plays in later westerns like Red River (1948), The Searchers (1956), and The Shootist (1976). In each Ccise, the conventions of the western provide a context that may make Wayne's actions more ironic, tragic, or elegiac - certciinly more richly nuanced and comprehensible. Viewers use many contexts, smaller or larger than established genres like the western, to interpret conventions of action and perfor- mance. Most viewers watching Stagecoach, for example, assume that Wayne's character, the Ringo Kid, will survive his climactic shootout with the Plummer family, even though he is outmanned and out- gunned, because the survival of characters played by John Wayne is statistically an excellent bet and because the conventions of classical Hollywood narrative films^ like Stagecoach make it more likely that Ringo will proceed to a rousingly heroic climax rather than survive a hazardous attack by Geronimo's braves only to be shot down on his arrival in Lordsburg. Even more fundamentally, most viewers assume that a climactic shootout will take place in the streets of Lordsburg because the conventions of cleissical Hollywood narrative predicate the resolution of the leading announced conflicts and an economy of representation that requires each person traveling in the stagecoach to fulfill the promise of his character and reveal his true nature. But all these expectations are generic, based as they are on a knowledge of the wider, though by no means universal, genre of classical Holly- wood narrative within which the western occupies a place that gives its own conventions their special potency. Because viewers understand and enjoy movies largely through their knowledge of the generic conventions, the question of whether gang- ster films have enough in common with whodunits and erotic thrillers to constitute a single genre of crime films is important to many more 4 Crime Films people than just film scholars. Even viewers who think they are inter- preting Brian De Palma's remake ot Scarf ace (1983) exclusively in light of the conventions of the gangster genre - or, more narrowly, in light of its departures from Howard Hawks 's 1932 film of the same title - may well be seeing it in the context of the broader genre of the crime film. The example of Stagecoach suggests that genres characteristi- Ccilly nest in one another, the most shcirply focused (the John Wayne western, for instance) drawing their powers from their specific trans- formations and adaptations of the conventions of broader genres like the western or still broader genres like the clcissical Hollywood narra- tive. Although viewers are most likely to be consciously aware of the narrowest genres, the broader genres that are operating simultane- ously are equally, though less visibly, influential in directing their re- sponses. Because every genre is a subgenre of a wider genre from whose contexts its own conventions take their meaning, it makes sense to think of the gangster film as both a genre on its own terms and a subgenre of the crime film. If a genre can be as specific as the John Wayne western or as gen- eral as the well-made Hollywood narrative, then it is clearly possible to defend the crime film as a genre simply by installing it at a level of generality somewhere between the gangster film and the classical Hollywood narrative. But such a solution would prove nothing at all; it would merely introduce still another category to a field already crisscrossed with genre markers. The aim of this book is therefore not simply to introduce a new generic category of the crime film but to explain how such a category has already been operating to inform viewers' understanding and enjoyment of such apparently diverse genres as the gangster film, the film noir, and the crime comedy. Establishing the crime film as a genre as rich as those of the western or the horror film - or, for that matter, the gangster film or the film noir - raises the problems involved in defining any genre. Genre theorists have long recognized this cis a chicken-and-egg problem. If a genre like the western can be defined only in terms of its members, but the mem- bers can be recognized as such only by viewers who are already fa- miliar with the genre, how can viewers recognize any genre without already having seen every film arguably within its boundaries?^ The short answer to this question is that they can't; hence the disagree- ments that inevitably arise over whether The Wizard ofOz is to count as a musical by viewers who have different idecis about what a musi- cal is. A contrary answer is that they can, despite the lack of theoret- The Problem of the Crime Film 5 ical justification. Even if theorists were to demonstrate that the west- ern was a logically indefensible category, nonspecialist viewers would go on referring to it because it is so useful and, except at its bound- aries, so easily recognized. Most people can recognize their friends more easily than they can describe them because different skills are involved in recognition and description, so that even Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart's oft-ridiculed pronouncement that he couldn't define pornography, but \"1 know it when 1 see it,\" makes sense.^ Recognizing genre conventions is clearly a developmental process. Few children understand the conventions of Hollywood westerns, but most adults do. Adults have gradually picked up the conventions through exposure to particular examples of the genre, because their understanding of the genre and of particular examples of it have been mutually reinforcing. When revisionist westerns like Duel in the Sun (1946) or Unforgiven (1992) appear, they are either dismissed as non- westerns or antiwesterns, sharpening the genre's definition through their exclusion, or they succeed in redefining the whole notion of the western by exploring new possibilities implicit in the genre. The mu- tability of generic conventions makes it clear that genres are best thought of as contexts that evolve in both personal and social history, the contingent results of ongoing transactions between viewers and movies, rather than eternally fixed and mutually exclusive categories. Even given this transactional, evolutionary concept of genres, there will always be debates about films on the margins of any particular genre, since many viewers believe, for example, that Singin ' in the Rain (1952) feels more like a musical than Fun in Acapulco (1963). Some fif- teen years ago. Rick Altman proposed a distinction between syntactic and semantic definitions of genre to account for the phenomenon of musicals that have many of the generic markers of musicals (a rec- ognized musical star like Elvis Presley sings several numbers) but not others (Fun in Acapulco does not explore the thematic relationships between performance and sincerity, public and private life, that are central to musicals like Singin ' in the Rairi).^ More recently, Altman hcis suggested \"a semantic/syntactic/pragmatic approach to genre\" to in- corporate into his grammar of textual markers a more systematic awareness of the multiple users and uses even the simplest films find.^ It is no wonder that Altman has expanded his earlier theory in the light of the many films marked by conflicting, often shifting generic allegiances. Most westerns from The Great Train Robbery (1903) to Unforgiven are organized around stories of crime and punishment; Crime Films 1. Something Wild: a crime film, or a screwball comedy gone wrong? (Ray Li- otta, Melanie Griffith) yet few viewers have called them crime films. If Sunset Blvd. (1950) is to be counted as film noir because of its confining mise-en-scene, its trapped hero, and its use of a fatalistic flashback, should Citizen Kane (1941) be counted cis noir too? Is Something Wild (1986) [Fig. 1] a crime film or a screwball comedy gone wrong? Critics have often coined nonce terms like \"superwestern\" and \"neo-noir\" to describe films that transform or combine elements from different genres, but these terms rciise as many problems as they solve. If Outland (1981) is an outer- space western -High Noon (1952) in space - is Assault on Precinct 13 (1976), John Carpenter's homage to Rio Bravo (1959), an inner-city western? This problem of cross-generic allegiances persists even within the crime film.io Is The Thin Man (1934) a private-eye story or a crime comedy? Is The Maltese Falcon (1941) a hard-boiled detective story or a film noir? The Usual Suspects (1995) combines elements of the gang- ster film and the whodunit; how is it to be classified? What to make of police films that are also studies of criminals, like The Untouchables (1987) and The Silence of the Lambs (1991) [Fig. 2]? And what about The Problem of the Crime Film 7 2. The Silence of the Lambs: A police film that is also a study of a monstrous criminal. (Anthony Hopkins) 8 Crime Films White Heat (1949), which combines a gangster hero, a film-noir hero- ine, an undercover cop, and an extended prison sequence that bor- rows the conventions of many another prison film? These problems are not solved by using the genre of the crime film to dissolve all dis- tinctions among its long-recognized subgenres; nor are they solved by declaring one subgenre the categorical victor and ignoring the claims of others. It makes sense, in such a work of clcissification as the bibli- ography to Barry Grant's Film Genre: Theory and Criticism, to exclude gangster films from the crime-film genre on the grounds that \"that group of films is clearly defined to the extent that it can be understood as comprising a distinct and separate genre.\"\" But the distinctiveness of the gangster film's conventions cannot support an argument for any essential distinction between gangster films and crime films, because there is no reason to assume that distinctive genres are parallel and mutually exclusive. The caper film, for example, has its own distinc- tive generic rules, but those rules do not prevent it from being widely recognized as a subgenre of an even more well-established genre, the gangster film, whose gangsters have been cissembled in caper films on an ad hoc basis for a particular job. Instead of attempting to construct genres that are mutually exclu- sive, it would be more judicious to agree with Janet Staiger that \"Holly- wood films have never been pure instances of genres, \"12 from D. W. Griffith's combination of historical epic, war movie, domestic melo- drama, and racial propaganda in The Birth of a Nation (1915) to George Luccis's revitalization of science fiction in Star Wars (1977) by recycling the story of Akira Kurosawa's samurai comedy-drama The Hidden For- tress (Kakushi toride no san akunin, 1958), itself based largely on the conventions of the Hollywood western. The multiple generic allegiances of most films, however, are ob- scured by the fact that some such allegiances have historically over- ridden others. Any story presented in animated form, from the musi- Ccil romance Beauty and the Beast (1991) to the epic Lord of the Rings (1978), will automatically be classified as a cartoon because the ani- mated cartoon is a stronger genre than the genres of romance and epic. Virtually any story with a setting in nineteenth-century western America will be cleissified as a western, because the cleiims of the west- ern override the claims of competing genres. Films like Harlan County, U.S.A. (1976) and Hoop Dreams (1994) are commonly classified togeth- er as documentaries rather than distinguished in terms of their sub- ject matter. In the same way, films like Blazing Saddles (1974) and The The Problem of the Crime Film 9 Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad! (1988) are classified as par- odies rather than as members of the various genres whose conven- tions they mock, because their parodic intent trumps their affinities with the specific genres they are sending up. What makes a genre strong? The example of the cartoon, the strong- est of all popular genres, suggests that the most powerful generic claims cire based on mise-en-scene. Crime-and-punishment tales like Winchester 73 (1950) and Rancho Notorious (1952) are classified as westerns rather than crime films because their setting takes prece- dence over their story. Any movie set in outer space, from Buck Rogers (1939) to Alien (1979), becomes a science-fiction movie. The reason that film noir is such a strong genre, or subgenre, despite the lack of any clear consensus about what sort of stories it tells, is the powerful- ly homogeneous sense of visual style that unites such diverse noirs as The Killers (1946), Force of Evil (1948), and The Big Combo (1955). Almost equally powerful as a generic marker is intent. Any movie whose stated aim is to entertain children will be classified as a chil- dren's film or a family film, whatever its plot or characters or setting - unless, of course, it is animated, in which case it will be classified as a cartoon. Comedy, which seeks to make viewers laugh; horror, which seeks to make them scream; documentary, which seeks to inform them about some real-life situation; and parody, which seeks to make fun of other genres - all these are such strong genres that critics have long categorized Arsenic and Old Lace (1944) and Married to the Mob (1988), for excimple, as comedies about crime, rather than crime films with some laughs; and reviewers who saw Mars Attacks! (1996) as more imitation than parody unanimously dismissed the film as a failed par- ody rather than a successful imitation because they agreed that a par- ody's first duty is to be funny rather than faithful to its sources. Weaker genres are based on typological situations (boy meets girl, ordinary characters get into ridiculous scrapes), characters (zom- bies, monsters, oversexed high-school students, attorneys), or pre- sentational features (the story is periodically interrupted or advanced by dance numbers). Such genres are most likely to be overridden by stronger genres whose claims conflict with theirs. Thus Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein (1948) is a comedy rather than a monster movie, and the transsexual science-fiction horror parody The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975), however it is categorized, is rarely de- scribed cis a musical. When Brian Henderson argued that The Search- ers's story of rescuers attempting to save a victim who did not want Crime Films to be saved actually crossed the boundaries of the western to consti- tute \"an American dilemma,\" in films as different as Taxi Driver (1976) and Hardcore (1979), his premise did not have the effect of establish- ing a new genre of unwelcome-rescue films because the common sto- ry he described did not have the power to override the conflicting ge- neric allegiances of the examples he cited. The disaster genre that flourished early in the 1970s (Airport, 1970; The Poseidon Adventure, 1972; Earthquake, 1974; The Towering Inferno, 1974) shows that smafl numbers do not necessarily make a genre weak; but the disaster genre is easily overridden by the conventions of the parody, as in Airplane! (1980), or the action blockbuster, as in Jaws (1975), originally market- ed as a disaster movie until it was recognized as inaugurating a far more profitable, hence stronger, genre. Lacking the box-office potential of such recent blockbusters as In- dependence Day (1996) and Titanic (1997), most genres can best dis- play their strength by articulating the central problems that endow their stock characters and situations and spectacles with power and meaning. Even apparently unproblematic genres like the musical and the cartoon can be seen as organized around problems based on their distinctive presentational features. Musical performers like Fred As- taire. Gene Kelly, and Judy Garland typically act out ritucils dramatiz- ing the complex relationship between realism and artifice, sincerity and performance, both while they are performing their song-and- dance numbers and in their characters' more private moments. Their films use production numbers to raise questions about public and private identities and the dynamics of self-presentation, particularly within the ritualistic context of romantic courtship. Similarly, just as Ccirtoons are defined pictorially by a tension between the highly styl- ized two-dimensional space in which they are drawn and the more realistic third dimension they imply, they are defined thematically by the tension between the requirements of realism (empathetic coming- of-age rituals for Disney heroes from Pinocchio to Simba) and magic (from the constant transformations of shapes and animated objects typical of all Disney cartoons to the playful self-reflexiveness of Warn- er Bros.' Duck Amuck, 1953). No matter how it is defined, the crime film will never be as strong a genre as the cartoon, the horror film, or the parody. It lacks both the instantly recognizable mise-en-scene of the animated film (or even the compellingly stylized visuals of the film noir) and the singleness of in- tent of the horror film or the parody. But the crime film is a stronger The Problem of the Crime Film 3. Pulp Fiction: A noir world of criminals like Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jack- son) without tlie noir visual style. genre than theorists of subgenres like the gangster film and the film noir have acknowledged. In fact, it is a stronger genre than the crim- inal subgenres that have commanded more attention, not only be- cause its scope is by definition broader than theirs, but because the problem it addresses as a genre, the problem that defines it as a genre, places the film noir and the gangster film in a more sharply illuminat- ing context by showing that each of those is part of a coherent larger project. The defining problem of the crime film is best approached through the specific problems involved in establishing it as a genre. Should the crime film be defined in terms of its subject, its effect, or its visual style? Many crime films adopt the visual conventions of film noir (low- key, high-contrast lighting, unbalanced compositions, night-for-night exterior shooting), but others do not. If the noir visual style is a defin- ing feature of the crime film, how are color films like Leave Her to Heaven (1945), Chinatown (1974), and Pulp Fiction (1994) [Fig. 3] to be categorized? If the noir visual style seems to produce too narrow a definition of the crime film, its characteristic subject, crime, and its frequently Crime Films sought effect, suspense, are impossibly broad. Both crime and sus- pense have an important role in a very great number of movies. The English Patient (1996) presents several important crimes, from rob- bery to murder, and a detective figure in David Caravaggio (Willem Dafoe); do those elements make it a crime film? Every classical Holly- wood narrative depends on some disruption of the social order for its conflict, and an enormous number of social disruptions (e.g., the fire in The Towering Inferno, which is started by the illegal installation of substandard wiring) are rooted in crimes. It would surely be im- practical to call every film in which a crime produces the central dra- matic situation a crime film. The touchstone of suspense is even more hopelessly vague, since suspense might be called a defining feature of the well-made Hollywood narrative. Even Jane Austen adaptations from Pride and Prejudice (1940) to Emma (1996) depend on the sus- pense generated by the questions of who will marry whom, and how the anticipated happy ending can be compassed. How can the crime film be distinguished from the broader category of the clcissical Holly- wood narrative, and how useful is such a vaguely defined genre likely to be? The problem of defining the crime film is exacerbated by three prob- lems implicit in its subject. John G. Cawelti has noted that popular nar- rative genres almost by definition package \"the ultimate excitements of love and death\" within the most reassuring generic formulas in or- der to appeal to both viewers' flight from ennui and their love of secur- ity, In crime film, this pciradox is linked to the question of crime's nor- malcy By definition crime is an aberration, a disruption to the normal workings of society; yet crime films invariably treat crime as normal even as they observe the ways it undermines the socieil order. Gang- sters do nothing all day long but smuggle or steal. Police officers pur- sue criminals for a living. Every single case a private eye like Philip Marlowe takes on turns criminal; every adaptation of a John Grisham novel of legal intrigue, even if the initicil proceeding is a civil one, ex- plodes in violence sooner or later. Crime films all profess to solve the criminal problems they present by means of a happy ending; yet the frequency of crime in such films suggests that the more general prob- lems posed by crime will never be solved. Is criminal behavior in these films abnormal or all too normal? The second problem cuts even deeper. In distinguishing between the heroes of thrillers, who \"almost exclusively represent themselves,\" and the heroes of crime films, who \"represent the Criminal, the Law, The Problem of the Crime Film and Society,\" Carlos Clarens implies a distinction between crime as an isolated event (the province of the thriller) and crime as a metaphor for social unrest (the province of the crime film).i7 But how solid is this distinction? In Clarens's terms, the work of Alfred Hitchcock, the filmmaker most closely identified with crime, includes only thrillers rather than crime films; yet critics from Eric Rohmer and Claude Cha- brol to Robert Corber have recognized that the criminal plots of all Hitchcock's films, from The Lodger (1926) to Psycho (1960), have obvi- ous moral and social implications that range far beyond the plight of the characters themselves, is When is a cinematic crime a metaphor for an enduring moral dilemma or social upheaval or ideological cri- tique, and when is a crime just a crime? The third problem concerns what may seem like the most straight- forward components of the crime film: its stock characters. Every crime story predicates three leading roles: the criminal who commits the crime, the victim who suffers it, and the avenger or detective who investigates it in the hope of bringing the criminal to justice and re- establishing the social order the crime hcis disrupted. The three roles could hardly be more clear-cut, yet they everywhere overlap and melt into each other. Gangsters like Vito Corleone are devoted family men concerned only to protect and provide for their loved ones. Victims like Paul Kersey, the bereaved hero of the Deaf/? Wish franchise (1974- 94), turn vigilante in order to avenge their loved ones. Maverick cops like Harry Callahan, in Dirty Harry (1971) and its sequels Magnum Force (1973), The Enforcer (1976), Sudden Impact (1983), and The Dead Pool (1988), break the law in order to catch criminals they know are guilty. A critique of the justice system is obligatory in Hollywood movies about lawyers, police officers, or private eyes. When the hero is a good cop, he is set against an entire corrupt department, cis in Serpico (1973), or ends up battling vigilante demons inside himself, as in The Untouchables. And Hollywood movies about victims who merely suf- fer, cis opposed to taking cirms against their oppressors, are virtually unheard of. Evidently crime films both believe and do not believe in the stock characters at their center; they seem determined to under- mine and blur the boundaries of the typological figures that might otherwise stake their surest claim to the status of a single genre. Although these problems might seem to present insuperable obsta- cles to the definition of the crime film, they are in fact at the heart of such a definition: for the crime film does not simply embody these problems; it is about them. Crime films present as their defining sub- Crime Films ject a crime culture that depends on normalizing the unspeakable, a place where crime is both shockingly disruptive and completely nor- mal. Crime may have different metaphorical Vcilences in different crim- inal subgenres - it can demonstrate the fragility of the social contract in thrillers about innocent men on the run, attack the economic prin- ciples of the establishment in gangster films, express philosophical despair in films noirs, test masculine professionalism in private-eye films - but it is always metaphorical. Every crime in every crime film represents a larger critique of the social or institutional order - either the film's critique or some character's. Finally, crime films dramatize not only the distinctive roles of criminal, victim, and avenger but also their interdependence and their interpenetration. The problem at the heart of crime films, then, is their attempt to me- diate between two logiccilly contradictory projects. Like cill popular genres, crime films work primarily by invoking and reinforcing a cher- ished, but not entirely convincing, series of social bromides: The road to hell is paved with good intentions, the law is above individuals, crime does not pay. Crime films need to reinforce these beliefs, just eis viewers want to have them reinforced, in order to confirm the distinc- tiveness of the moral and legal categories that allow viewers to main- tain their sense of social decorum and their own secure place in the social order as law-abiding citizens who know right from wrong, iden- tify with the innocent, and wish to see the guilty punished. It is no sur- prise that the Hollywood film industry is eager to endorse these bro- mides, since the industry's continued success depends on the hecilth of the capitalist economy. The moral certitudes on which the indus- try and its audience agree depend on a series of categorical distinc- tions among the roles of victim, who ought, according to Hollywood's official morality, to be their natural identification figure; the criminal, who ought by the same token to be the target of their fear and hatred; and the avenging detective, who ought to express the law in its purest yet most personal form. Viewers for crime films know that these three figures - the innocent victim, the menacing criminal, the detective who incarnates the law - never exist in such pure incarnations, not only because of the require- ments of realism and narrative complexity but because they would be utterly uninteresting. The ritual triumph of avenging heroes over criminals is compelling only as ritual; to succeed as narrative, it re- quires complications and surprises in the conception of the leading roles and their relationships. The fciscination of crime films arises pre- The Problem of the Crime Film cisely from the ways they test the limits of their moral categories, en- gaging and revealing contradictions in the audience's fantasies of iden- tification by mixing elements from these three different positions, the primary colors of crime films that never occur in isolation. Although crime films typically move toward endings that confirm the moral ab- solutes incarnated in each of their three primary figures, an equally important function crime films share is to call these primary figures, and the moral absolutes that inspire them, into question by making a case for the heroic or pathetic status of the criminal, questioning the moral authority of the justice system, or presenting innocent char- acters who seem guilty or guilty characters who seem innocent. Even when the endings of crime films endorse a reassuringly absolutist view of crime and punishment, the middle of such films puts absolutist cat- egories like hero, authority, innocent, guilty, victim, criminal, and aveng- er into play, engaging the doubts and reservations about these labels that make them fit subjects for mass entertainment as well as moral debate, and so raising questions that the most emphatically absolut- ist endings can never entirely resolve. Crime films always depend on their audience's ambivalence about crime. The master criminal is immoral but glamorous, the maverick police officer is breaking the law in order to catch the criminals, the victim is helpless to take any action except capturing or killing the criminal. It is therefore inevitable that they both insist on the distinc- tions among criminals, crime solvers, and victims, and that their ob- sessive focus is on the fluid and troubling boundaries among these categories. Crime films are about the continual breakdown and re- establishment of the borders among criminals, crime solvers, and vic- tims. This paradox is at the heart of all crime films. Crime films operate by mediating between two powerful but blank- ly contradictory articles of faith: that the social order that every crime challenges is ultimately well-defined, stable, and justified in consign- ing different people to the mutually exclusive roles of lawbrecikers, law enforcers, and the victims who are the audience's natural identifica- tion figures; and that every audience member is not only a potential victim but a potential avenger and a potential criminal under the skin. The audience's ambivalence toward both these premises, and the shifting identifications crime films therefore urge among the fictional roles of lawbreaker, law enforcer, and victim, are the defining feature of the genre, and the feature that indicates the place each variety of crime film has within the larger genre. Crime Films Hence the genre of crime films includes all films that focus on any of the three parties to a crime - criminal, victim, avenger - while ex- ploring that party's links to the other two. What defines the genre, however, is not these three typological figures any more than a dis- tinctive plot or visual style, but a pair of contradictory narrative proj- ects: to valorize the distinctions among these three roles in order to affirm the social, moral, or institutioneil order threatened by crime, and to explore the relations among the three roles in order to mount a critique that challenges that order. This contradictory double proj- ect, which has often been obscured by the predominance of sub- genres like the gangster film and the film noir over the crime film, un- derlies the ambivalence of all the crime film's subgenres, including several this book will not consider in detail. White-collar crime films like Wall Street (1987) explore the pciranoid hypothesis that American capitalism is at its heart criminal; caper films like The Asphalt Jungle (1950) present a criminal culture more admirable in its honor and pro- fessionalism than the official culture it subverts; prison films from Brute Force (1947) to The Shawshank Redemption (1994) explore the nature of legal and moral guilt in order to consider how individual hu- manity can survive the dehumanizing rituals of the prison system. One final apparent omission deserves fuller mention because, as Carlos Clarens has acknowledged, it goes to the heart of the crime film's definition: the thriller. The crime film has much in common with the thriller; but following Charles Derry's brief definition of the thriller as \"films in the shadow of Alfred Hitchcock\"i9 revccils that the thriller is not, as Clarens argues, a parallel alternative to the crime film but a subset of it. Although every crime film postulates the same three piv- otal figures, different figures predominate in different criminal sub- genres. The criminal is most prominent in gangster films and films noirs; the avenging crime solver in detective films, police films, and lawyer films; and the victim in the man-on-the-run films of which Hitch- cock made such a specialty. In a larger sense, however, all of Hitch- cock's films are about victims. The types of crime films Hitchcock nev- er essayed - films about professional criminals, about ordinary people sucked into committing crimes, about heroic agents of the justice sys- tem - make up a virtual catalog of the types of films about criminals and avengers. Despite Hitchcock's bromide, \"The more successful the villain, the more successful the picture,\"20 he never makes a criminal the hero of a film without recasting that criminal, from Alice White in Blackmail (1929) to Marnie Edgar in Mamie (1964), as a victim. Hitch- The Problem of the Crime Film cock's distaste for the police is even more well-known; he regards le- gal authorities of any sort with suspicion and fear. His abiding interest therefore remains with innocent people who are unjustly suspected of crimes (North by Northwest, 1959), or who must confront criminals without any help from the authorities (Shadow of a Doubt), or who turn detective in order to clear themselves or save their country (The 39 Steps, 1935). Hitchcock's thrillers, indeed thrillers generally, are essentially crime films that focus on the victims of crimes, or of the criminal-justice system. Including in the definition of crime films all films whose primary subject is crimiucd culture, whether they focus on criminals, victims, or avengers, may seem to make the genre too broad to be truly useful or distinctive. But the test of this definition, like that of any genre, is neither its narrowness nor its inclusiveness; it is its ability to raise questions that illuminate its members in ways existing modes of think- ing about crime films do not. If all genres, as Staiger and Altman sug- gest, are contingent, evolving, and transactional,^! the question they raise is not whether or not a particular film is a member of a given genre, but how rewarding it is to discuss it as if it were. Nearly any film, from The Wizard of Oz to The English Patient, might be considered a crime film. The model of ambivalence toward the categories repre- sented by the criminal, the victim, and legal avenger is not meant to distinguish crime films from non-crime films once and for all, but to suggest a new way of illuminating the whole range of films in which crimes are committed. 2 Historical and Cultural Overview The roots of the crime film go back far beyond the invention of the movies. Criminals have exercised a particular fascination for the literary imagination whenever social orders have been in flux. Shakespeare's great villains - Aaron the Moor, Richard 111, King John, lago, Edmund, Macbeth - are self-made men who seize oppor- tunities for advancement that would never have arisen in a medieval world whose divinely ordained sense of socicil order seems to reign, for example, at the beginning of Richard IIA Criminals, even if they end up as kings, are precisely those people who overstep the bounds appointed by their status at birth, striving each \"to rise above the sta- tion to which he was born.\"2 With the waning of the notion that the social and economic status of kings and peasants alike reflect an eter- nal, God-given order comes the suspicion that some people may be occupying social places they have no right to - a suspicion that pro- duces the rise of the criminal in literature. Criminals in American literature are as old as American literature itself. The first important novel to appear in the United States, Charles Brockden Brown's Wieland; or, The Transformation (1798), is asuper- naturally tinged tale of crime that goes far to anticipate the anxieties of film noir in its sense of gathering doom. Half a century later Herman Melville produced an even more memorable portrait of a protean riverboat swindler in The Confidence-Man: His Masquerade (1857). The early American writer most immutably associated with crime, how- ever, is Edgar Allan Poe. Only a few years after Sir Robert Peel began England's Bow Street Runners as the world's first official police force, Poe presented the ideally cerebral detective in three short stories: Historical and Cultural Overview \"The Murders in the Rue Morgue\" (1841), \"The Mystery of Marie R6- get\" (1842), and \"The Purloined Letter\" (1844). These stories, all fea- turing the reclusive Chevalier Auguste Dupin, have made Poe univer- sally hciiled as the father of the detective story. Dupin, though the only recurring character in Poe's fiction, never- theless plays a minor role in that fiction as a whole. The Poe of the popular imagination (and the Poe of innumerable Hollywood horror extravaganzas) is the high priest of Gothic horror Although horror in Poe has many sources - the fear of being watched by a malign pres- ence, communication with the dead, states of consciousness between life and death (dream, hypnosis, suspended animation, possession by the dead), the possibility of burial alive, the horror of maiming or dis- memberment - none of them is richer than the psychopathology of the criminal mind. Poe is the first writer to explore systematically the proposition that the ability to imagine an action acts cis a powerful in- ducement to complete it, regardless of the disastrous consequences. Hence his criminals, from Egaeus, who breaks into his fiancee's tomb to extract her teeth in \"Berenice\" (1835), to the anonymous killers of \"The Black Cat\" (1843) and \"The Tell-Tale Heart\" (1843), are typically driven to crimes they neither understand nor assent to; when these crimes succeed, they are driven, equally irrationally, to confess, as in \"William Wilson\" (1839), \"The Imp of the Perverse\" (1845), and \"The Cask of Amontillado\" (1846). It is no coincidence that Poe is noted both as the inventor of the detective hero and as the preeminent American literary explorer of criminal psychology. In Poe's nightmare world, Dupin, who is given many of the characteristics of Poe's crim- inals (misogynistic reclusiveness, a love of night and mystery, an abil- ity to identify with the criminals he is seeking), represents a uniquely successful attempt to impose through a strenuous effort of will what his author calls \"ratiocination\" on an imaginative world that is gen- erally irrational in its cosmology and criminal in its morality. One recison Dupin, unlike his successor Sherlock Holmes, spawned no imitators and no immediate legacy is that his import is so abstract- ly philosophical, so little rooted in a particular time and place that Poe can substitute a minutely detailed Paris, in \"The Mystery of Marie R6- get,\" to stand in, street by street and newspaper by newspaper, for the scene of the actual crime on which the story is based: Hoboken, New Jersey. But crime films have from their very beginning attempted to link criminal behavior to specific socicil settings both in fulfillment of Hollywood's general tendency toward sensationalizing abstract con- Crime Films flicts and as part of its generic project of casting a metaphoric light on the workings of the social order crime challenges. Broadly speaking, the history of the crime film before 1940 follows changing social atti- tudes toward crime and criminals; the 1940s mark a crisis of ambiv- alence toward the criminal hero; by 1950, it was following changing attitudes toward the law and the social order that criminals metaphor- ically reflect. The Romance of the Silent Criminal Given the vanishing of so many silent shorts and features, perhaps for- ever, the power and extent of the crime film in the years before syn- chronized sound may never be fully understood. To the handful of si- lent crime films scholars have discussed, Langman and Finn add some three thousand more in their catalog of the period 1903-28.3 There may seem little point in speculating about the patterns of silent crime films when so much of the evidence has disappeared, but a few gen- eralizations seem safe. From the time of Edwin S. Porter's Edison film The Great Train Robbery (1903), one of the earliest of all narrative films, criminals were more prominent on silent screens than enforcers of the law. If the robbers in Porter's seven-minute film are unremark- able, the posse of citizens that ends up shooting them down is even more nondescript, and has much less screen time. As its title indi- cates, the film is far more interested in the mechanics of crime than in the necessities of punishment.^ The work most often cited as the exemplary silent crime film is D. W. Griffith's two-reeler The Musketeers of Pig Alley (1912), which is equal- ly memorable for its realistically grubby urban exteriors and its pio- neering use of enormous close-ups of gang members as they loom sur- realistically before the camera while sneaking out of an alley en route to a shootout with a rival gang. It is easy to forget not only that Grif- fith, for all the fascination of his lead criminal, the Kid, ends the film with a flourish of his usual sentimentality - in return for the unexpect- ed chivalry he has shown her, the heroine covers up the Kid's cul- pability by lying to the police - but that crime features prominently in any number of Griffith's contemporaneous films, from The Lonely Villa (1909) and The Lonedale Operator (1911), which focus on hero- ines menaced by threatening robbers as stalwart heroes ride to their rescue, to The Narrow Road (1912), whose heroine, Mary Pickford, rescues her husband, Elmer Booth (the Kid in The Musketeers of Pig Historical and Cultural Overview Alley), from temptation by a counterfeiter and pursuit by a relentless police officer. The most elaborate story in Griffith's four-story epic In- tolerance (1916), later recut and relecised separately cis The Mother and the Law (1919), dramatizes the struggles of an innocent man (Robert Harron) when he is unjustly accused of murder and is rescued from the gallows by the last-minute detective work of his faithful wife (Mae Marsh). In all these films, Griffith's interest is less in the charisma or brutality of the criminals than in the dangers they pose the innocent victims, who remain closest to Griffith's heart. Intolerance is less an indictment of its sympathetic, distracted murderer, whom the film calls The Friendless One (Miriam Cooper), than of the ruthless indus- trialism and social hypocrisy that have made its hapless hero and heroine so vulnerable in the first place. Griffith's criminals are more fearsome for what they threaten them for who they are; their romemce lies in their function of bringing to a head the social forces that men- ace Griffith's innocents. Smirking Mack Sennett, who plays the lead vil- lain in The Lonely Villa, might just as well be the eagle who menaces the child in what seems to have occcisioned Griffith's first lead role as a film actor. Rescued from an Eagle's Nest (1908);^ and the dangers that brought every chapter of the contemporaneous Pearl White se- rials (The Perils of Pauline, 1914; The Exploits of Elaine, 1914-15; The Iron Claw, 1916) to an end were divided without prejudice between human and natural agency. Several silent films go much further in exploring the mystique of the criminal. Following the success in France of Louis Feuillade's five multiepisode salutes to the dashing master criminal Fantomas (1913- 14), Maurice Tourneur, whose son Jacques would make the important film noir Out of the Past (1947), directed Alias Jimmy Valentine (1915). Expanding on Paul Armstrong's 1909 play and its bcisis in the O. Henry short story \"A Retrieved Reformation\" (1903), the film follows the ad- ventures of Lee Randall, alias gentleman safecracker Jimmy Valentine (Robert Warwick), in what the credits call \"his double life\" as a mem- ber and an enemy of society In the film's most extraordinary se- quence, a high-angle long take shows the interior of a bank shorn of its ceilings as Jimmy and his confederates, often unaware of dangers the audience can see clecirly one or two rooms away, go about an ex- pertly planned robbery. When the gang is captured anyway, Jimmy goes to prison, but he eventually wins a pardon, goes straight, and, as trusted cashier Lee Randall, wins the heart of the Lieutenant Gover- nor's daughter. When a toddler is accidentally locked in a bank vault. Crime Films Randall's expertise in opening the lock threatens to reveal his double life. But the police detective who, convinced Jimmy never deserved pardon, has been wciiting for him to slip, takes a cue from The Narrow Road and The Musketeers of Pig Alley and passes the incident off with a knowing wink. This frees Jimmy to revert to Lee Randall, the better half of his split identity, which the film had privileged from the be- ginning. It is no wonder that Alias Jimmy Valentine was torn between ro- manticizing its safecracker and suggesting from the beginning that he would be redeemed in the end. The lower-class audiences who packed moviehouses in the first two decades of the century would have shrunk from any contact with real-life criminals, who were identified in the popular imagination with the recent waves of European im- migrants who had made America's cities so unsavory. But with immi- gration running at record levels after World War 1, it was only a mat- ter of time before a large portion of the audience was drawn from the ranks of those very immigrants. In the meantime, Prohibition, which had become the law of the land in 1920, made it necessary for any law-abiding citizen who wanted a drink to get liquor from crimi- nals. Finally, as the average budget for a Hollywood feature shot from $20,000 in 1914 to $300,000 in 1924^ and production companies re- sponded to the challenge of higher budgets by merging into bigger and bigger corporations and looking to Wall Street for investment cap- ital, the financial structure of the few surviving studios began to re- semble more and more closely that of the gangs who would ultimate- ly finance Harry Cohn's 1932 buyout of his brother Jack at Columbia Pictures and William Fox's unsuccessful attempt to keep control of the company that ended with its 1935 merger with Darryl F. Zanuck's Twentieth Century Productions - the same gangs who would infiltrate the rank and file of the industry through labor racketeering in the ear- ly 1930S.7 Higher budgets to lure bigger audiences, the rapid rise of Icirgely immigrant audiences, the criminalization of drinking through Prohi- bition, and the alliance of Hollywood studios with organized crime all combined to shift the romance of criminals from the menace they posed to innocent victims to their own personal mystique. Josef von Sternberg's Underworld (1927) retains the redemptive structure of Alias Jimmy Valentine while granting its lead criminal. Bull Weed (George Bancroft), a much more glamorous life from which to be re- deemed.8 Underworld gives Bull the best of all worlds by making him Historical and Cultural Overview both a legendary professional criminal whose life-style is an endless round of robberies, parties, and shootouts, and also one of nature's noblemen who knows when it is time to give himself up to the police in order to clear the way for his moll Feathers (Evelyn Brent) and her lover Rolls Royce (Clive Brook), the lawyer he mistakenly thought had betrayed him. So successful was the film that all the major studios rushed to copy it; Sternberg's own copy for Paramount, Thunderbolt (1929), also starring Bancroft, was a virtual remake. Amid the worldwide fascination with larger-than-life criminals, from Feuillade's Fantomeis to Fritz Lang's megalomaniacal Dr. Mabuse (1922, 1933), only one fictional detective, Sherlock Holmes, held anything like the same sway onscreen, and for many of the same reasons. Al- though Arthur Conan Doyle's novels A Study in Scarlet (1887) and The Valley of Fear (1915) had been adapted for the British screen in 1914 and 1916, audiences responded to Holmes's exotic eccentricities in many other contexts, from the camera trickery of American Muto- scope's short Sherlock Holmes Baffled (1903) to the stage play Sher- lock Holmes (1899), American actor-playwright William Gillette's fan- tasia on Holmesian themes, twice filmed in Hollywood - first with Gillette in the starring role (1916), then with John Barrymore (1922). Although Conan Doyle had made Holmes resolutely unromantic, Gil- lette ended by marrying him off to the heroine he had rescued from the clutches of Professor Moriarty, providing audiences with some of the same pleasures as the redemption of Jimmy Valentine or the un- selfish romantic posturing of Bull Weed. Tough Guys The gangster cycle of the 1930s weisted no time in turning the big- hearted crook silent films had considered ripe for redemption into a remorseless killer. Little Caesar (1930), The Public Enemy (1931), and Scarface (1932) were only the most notorious of a new cycle of tough gangster movies that included The Racket (1928), Alibi (1929), Door- way to Hell (1930), and Quick Millions (1931). The groundwork for this new brutality went back to the early 1920s, when high-speed presses and cheap wood-pulp paper stocks led to an explosion in mass-market publishing. At the same time newspapers battling for circulation made folk heroes of bootleggers like Al Capone, pulp magazines like Black Mask, founded in 1920 by H. L. Mencken and George Jean Nathan to help support their highbrow magazine Smart Set, were chronicling the Crime Films exploits of hard-edged detectives like Carroll John Daly's Race Wil- liams and Dashiell Hammett's nameless operative of the Continental Detective Agency.9 The collapse of the stock market in 1929 lit the match to the tough- guy fuse by sparking a national depression marked by soaring unem- ployment and widespread despair over the value of public policy and the institutions of government, finance, and the law. When police offi- cers appeared increasingly as enforcers of rich men's law, banks either foreclosed on delinquent mortgages or failed their depositors, and Wcishington seemed powerless to alleviate the nation's sufferings, au- diences turned toward strong heroes who offered them the hope of taking charge of their own future: self-made entrepreneurs in direct sales (albeit the illegal sale of liquor) like Tom Powers in The Public Enemy and Tony Camonte in Scarface. At the same time, the arrived of synchronized sound, as Jonathan Munby has noted, turned the sud- denly speaking gangster from a deracinated outlaw to a member of a specific marginal ethnic group whose \"accent frames his desire for success within a history of struggle over national identity.\"!\" Hence the gangster's inevitable death at the end of each film was not simply the necessary price for the hour and a half of upwardly mobile fantasy that preceded it but a site of the audience's sharp ambivcilence toward the immigrant gangster hero [Fig. 4]. The pattern of the new gangster films, tracing the hero's gradual rise to fabulous power and his inevit- able meteoric fall - which now substituted for the earlier romantic in- trigues ot Alias Jimmy Valentine and Underworld - cillowed audiences to indulge both sides of their ambivalence toward an establishment that seemed less and less responsive to their needs: their fantasies of personal empowerment and their fears of defying institutional author- ity, their despair over the possibility of social justice and their belief in the rough justice of the movies. In retrospect, it is remarkable how brief this vogue of the tough movie gcmgster, perhaps the most striking figure in the history of Hollywood crime, actually was. Studio heads were under such con- stant pressure from public-interest groups to tone down their portray- al of professional criminals that as early as 1931, at the height of the new cycle, Jack L. Warner announced that Warner Bros., whose prefer- ence for low-budget urban location shooting and proletarian milieus had made it the major studio most active in the gangster film, would stop producing such films, and that he had not allowed his fifteen- year-old son to watch any of them.\" In addition, the releeise of Scar- Historical and Cultural Overview 4. Scarface (1932): The Depression-era audience's ambivalence toward an up- wardly mobile fantasy. (Vince Barnett, Paul Muni, Karen Morley) face, the most violent of the new movies, wcis delayed for over a year while producer Howard Hughes dickered with the Motion Picture Pro- ducers and Distributors of America's Production Code Office (or Hays Office, cis it was popularly called for its first leader, former Postmeister General Will Hays) over the film's bloodletting and overtones of incest. Crime Films Eventually it was shorn of several repellent or suggestive shots; but- tressed by a new sequence shot by Hughes in which a stolid news- paper editor, faced by a citizens' bocird, denounced the glorification of gangsters in the mass media and urged action on the part of the fed- eral government and the American Legion; and given a new title for its 1932 release: Scarface: Shame of a Nation. The promethean gangster was shackled by the election of Franklin Roosevelt as president in 1932 and the stricter enforcement of the Hays Office's 1930 Production Code, provoked in large measure by the founding of the Catholic Church's Legion of Decency in 1934. Roose- velt, an activist president who cissiduously manipulated the newly dominant technology of radio to transform his public image from a New York patrician crippled by polio to a paternal man of the people in whom ordinary Americans could believe, launched a series of high- profile initiatives immediately on his inauguration in 1933: insuring de- posits in Federal Reserve banks, mandating increased prices for farm products, and launching the largest public-works programs in Amer- ican history to start putting the unemployed back to work. That same year, Joseph 1. Breen of the Hays Office finally succeeded, with the in- advertent help of the outrageous Mae West and the gangster cycle, in pressing the major studios to abide by the provisions of the 1930 Pro- duction Code, which forbade, among other things, nudity, profanity, justified violent revenge, the defeat of the law, seduction or rape, and the ridicule of organized religion or the flag. 12 Within a year the Hollywood crime film had undergone a seismic shift. Gone was the unquenchable ambition of Little Caesar, the cold- hearted brutality of The Public Enemy, the sexual explicitness of Scar- face. But although Roosevelt and the Hays Office could provide new models and regulations for Hollywood, they could do nothing to reg- ulate audiences' desires to see onscreen violence or digs at the justice system. The new wave of crime films that began in 1934 simply chan- neled their toughness in subtler ways. The most obvious of these ways was to make law enforcers as glam- orous and charismatic as criminals. Since real-life enforcers were by definition organization men and women, the challenge of bringing them to melodramatic life was considerable, and it is not surprising that the first police hero to achieve widespread popularity emerged from the funny pages. Chester Gould's Dick Tracy, the comic strip that debuted in 1931, worked by setting its hero - whose creator had orig- inally planned to emphcisize his anonymity by calling him Plciinclothes Historical and Cultural Overview Tracyi3 - against a galaxy of such criminal gargoyles as Flattop, B. B. Eyes, Pruneface, Mumbles, the Brow, and the Mole. Although Tracy, with his trademark square jaw and yellow raincoat, Wcis invariably upstaged by the grotesque villain in each story, he developed a loyal following as the continuing hero of case after case.i^ As Dick Tracy's readership was expanding among a Depression au- dience hungry for heroes, a new publicity campeiign for real-life detec- tive heroes was under way. Inspired by the activist example of Roose- velt, J. Edgar Hoover, director since 1924 of the Bureau of Investigation (renamed the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 1935), promoted big- ger budgets and wider press for his organization and himself through a well-publicized crusade against such gangsters as Machine Gun Kel- ly, Pretty Boy Floyd, Baby Face Nelson, and John Dillinger - the last pulling off a brilliantly reciprocal publicity coup when he was shot to death by FBI agents as he emerged from a Chicago screening of the gangster film Manhattan Melodrama (1934). Hoover's fictionalized ex- ploits were glorified in \"G\" Men (1935) through the sublimely simple tactic of recasting James Cagney, f cimous cis the gangster Tom Powers of Public Enemy, as the equally violent and mercurial, but now official- ly sanctioned, FBI hero. Although the film was as brutal and fast-paced as the gangster films from which it borrowed everything but its moral loyalties, it had no trouble earning a seal of approval from the Hays Office and the semiofficial blessing of Hoover in a prologue for its re- release in 1949. The other key crime film of the period, which could not have been more different from \"G\" Men, took a completely different approach to the challenge of Hollywood self-censorship. The Thin Man, shot in sixteen days in 1934, wcis a knockabout comedy of crime whose de- tective hero Nick Charles (William Powell) and his improbable social- ite wife Nora (Myrna Loy) were persuaded by Dorothy Wynant (Mau- reen O'Sullivan) to investigate a series of murders implicating her father, a vanished inventor. Nick and Nora, elided by their terrier Asta, were the model of Hays Office primness. Despite Nick's amusingly ex- tensive underworld connections, they consorted with criminals only reluctantly and fastidiously; their bickering was marked by elaborate courtesy; and each night, after a full day of detecting, they retired to their chaste twin beds. At the same time, their nonstop drinking, sanc- tioned by the repeal of Prohibition in 1933, and their frankly carnal in- terest in each other despite the bonds of holy matrimony, proved, like Cagney's lively incarnation of a fledgling FBI agent, that Hollywood Crime Films could sell the desire for violence, thrills, and mystery in the most re- spectable forms. The Thin Man and its five sequels, from After the Thin Man (1936) through Song of the Thin Man (1947), were only the most popular of the detective serials that sprouted on both sides of the Atlantic throughout the thirties. Spurred in England by protectionist laws man- dating a minimcil percentage of British-made films to be shown in each theater, even if these British products were \"quota quickies,\" and in America by the rise of the double feature, which demanded a constant relecise of \"programmers\" to fill the bottom of double bills, studios rushed to release detective B films that traded on their heroes' and heroines' preexistent following. Dozens of literary detectives enjoyed active screen careers during the 1930s. At the end of the decade Sher- lock Holmes and Dr. Watson, played by the inspired casting choices of Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce, made a triumphant return to the screen in The Hound of the Baskervilles [Fig. 5] and The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (both 1939). Most active of all was Earl Derr Biggers's soft-spoken Charlie Chan, played by Warner Oland until his death in 1938, and then by Sidney Toler, who starred in a total of twenty-seven Fox features between 1931 and 1942. The smiling, self-deprecating, epigrcimmatic Chan, the globe-trotting Honolulu police detective who seemed eternally to be drawn into crimes outside his jurisdiction, ap- peared the final blow to the tough-guy milieu of the gangster. One last source of detective films, however, suggested that Amer- ica's appetite for tough heroes had still not been sated. Although the half-hour time slots of radio demanded brief, action-filled stories whose leading characters would not need to be established each week if they were already well-known, the radio detectives who made the most successful transitions to Hollywood tended to be tough guys themselves. Among the many crime-fighting heroes of radio, pulp writ- er Walter Gibson's mysterious character the Shadow, alias Lamont Cranston, 15 bolstered by the sinister cissociations with the crimiucil mind crystallized by his radio tag line (\"Who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men? The Shadow knows\"), made perhaps the smooth- est transition to Hollywood in a string of features and serials from 1937 through 1946. But Fran Striker and George W. Trendle's Green Hornet and the A-1 Detective Agency, created by Carleton E. Morse tor I Love a Mystery, were not far behind. America's love affair with the detec- tive hero continued, for better or worse, to be marked by its fascina- tion with the dark side of human nature. Historical and Cultural Overview 5. The Hound of the Baskervilles: Nigel Bruce and Basil Rathbone as the best- loved Watson and Holmes of all. The Crisis in Hollywood Crime Through the 1930s, American mass culture had treated criminals and their culture predominantly as exotica, glamorizing both the criminal masterminds who cracked safes and controlled the traffic in illegal liquor and the detectives whose well-advertised eccentricities gave them a similarly exotic cachet. As the decade drew to a close, how- ever, the attitudes Hollywood seemed to encourage toward both fic- tional criminals and fictional detectives grew less strciightforward and more conflicted. At the same time, in an even more fundamental shift, crime films grew more figurative, their criminals metaphors for a tan- gle of social forces and attitudes rather than heroic outsiders in their own right. The gangsters played in the later 1930s by Humphrey Bogart illus- trate this shift from the exotic criminal to the metaphoric criminal. After several years playing nondescript characters in the early 1930s, Bogart had left the screen for the stage, and it was in a stage role he Crime Films had originated in 1935, Duke Mantee in The Petrified Forest, that he returned to Hollywood a year later. Mantee is the first of Hollywood's overtly metaphoriceil gangsters. Although he is by far the most com- manding presence in Robert Sherwood's play and Archie Mayo's film (1936), his role is nothing more than a plot contrivance, a catalyst that allows the metaphysically weary hero Alan Squier (Leslie Howard) to sacrifice his own life and leave a legacy that will cillow Gabrielle Maple (Bette Davis) to escape the existential paralysis Squier cannot. Warner Bros, paired Bogart with James Cagney in three films in the later thirties: Angels with Dirty Faces (1 938), 77ze Oklahoma Kid (1 939), and The Roaring Twenties (1939). In each of them, Cagney was the dy- namic lead, whether as criminal or avenger, Bogart the dishonorable villain as social pathology. Bogart's Baby Face Martin was used to ex- plciin juvenile delinquency in Dead End (1937); his George Hcilly helped embalm the Prohibition era as historic Americana in The Roaring Twenties; but not until after he emerged from Cagney's shadow in High Sierra (1941) would his Roy Earle meld Squier's anachronistic preten- sions to the gangster's atavistic grandeur. Unlike Cagney, whose ap- peal was direct, physical, and extroverted, Bogart, who could suggest depths of worldly disillusionment beneath a crooked shell, was the perfect choice to play gangsters designed to explore the ambiguities of nongangster culture: a stifling society's thirst for cathartic violence; the need to blame intractable social problems on outside agents or to project them onto a comfortably remote history; the recognition that the gangster's power, like the western gunslinger's, Wcis for better or worse a reminder of a simpler time long past. Better than anyone else before or since, Bogart incarnated the ro- mantic mystique of the doomed criminal. He never played the nobly redeemable crook of Sternberg's Underworld or the dashing outlaw who flouts unjust laws - a figure popularized by Mae West (She Done Him Wrong and I'm No Angel, both 1933) and Errol Flynn (The Adven- tures of Robin Hood, 1938). Instead, Bogcirt's protagonists were cimbiv- alent. Bogart villains like Roy Earle were sympathetic despite (or be- cause of) their guilt, Bogart heroes like Sam Spade (in The Maltese Falcon, 1941) [Fig. 6] tainted with guilty knowledge. Bogart continued to trade on the mystique of the soulful criminal and the hero with a shady past, even when cast against type as the aging sailor Charlie All- nut in The African Queen (1951) or the obsessive Captain Queeg in The Caine Mutiny (1954). On the eve of John Huston's pivotal caper film The Asphalt Jungle (1950), Bogart would close the forties by starring Historical and Cultural Overview 31 6. The Maltese Falcon: Humphrey Bogart as the private-eye hero tainted with guilty knowledge. (Bogart, Sydney Greenstreet) in a pair of 1948 Huston films that confirmed the metaphoric power of the criminal, appearing as the psychotic Everyman Fred C. Dobbs in The Treasure of the Sierra Madre and as Lt. Frank McCloud in Key Largo, whose admonition to Americans to rouse themselves from their exhausted postwar apathy to battle the forces of evil represented by Johnny Rocco (Edward G. Robinson) makes it the most allegorical of all the great gangster films. What made Bogart and his colleagues stop working exclusively for criminal gangs and go to work for cultural aucilysts who were using movie criminals as metaphors for American culture? The most obvi- ous cause for this shift was the decline in high-profile organized crime, partly because of the repeal of Prohibition in 1933, partly because of the well-publicized success of the FBI. The adventures of Scarface's Tony Camonte and \"G\" Men's Brick Davis could fairly be claimed to be ripped from newspaper headlines; the gangsters played by Paul Muni in Angel on My Shoulder (1946) and James Cagney in White Heat Crime Films (1949) are self-consciously anachronistic, memoirs of a gangster cul- ture whose day has passed. As the journalistic currency of criminals declined, their literary ma- trix stood out in sharper relief. Ever since the coming of synchronized sound had encouraged Hollywood to turn to literary and dramatic sources, the great gangster films, like the great detective films, had all been based on literary properties; even Scarface, cillegedly written from Chicago headlines, credited Armitrage Trail's novel as its source. But the crime films of the 1940s sprang out of a fictional tradition that wcis already hailed as more self-consciously literary despite its hard- boiled roots. 16 It may seem strange to claim Dashiell Hammett, Ray- mond Chandler, and James M. Cain as literary, but all of them had con- nections and pretensions to the literary establishment, and all of them - unlike fellow pulp writers Ccirroll John Dcily and Erie Stanley Gcirdner - turned from action writers to literary stylists when they left the short story for the novel. The second paragraph of Chandler's first novel, The Big Sleep (1 939) , for example, is a cleissic of playfully meta- phoric foreshadowing of the detective cis disillusioned knight-errant that would have been blue-penciled from any of Chandler's submis- sions to Black Mask, Detective Fiction Weekly, or Dime Detective: The main hallway of the Sternwood place was two stories high. Over the entrance doors, which would have let in a troop of Indian elephants, there was a broad stained-glass panel showing a knight in dark armor rescuing a lady who was tied to a tree and didn't have any clothes on but some long cind convenient hair. The knight had pushed the vizor of his helmet back to be sociable, and he was fiddling with the knots on the ropes that tied the lady to the tree and not getting anywhere. 1 stood there and thought that if I lived in the house, 1 would sooner or later have to climb up there and help him. He didn't seem to be really trying.i^ Cornell Woolrich, the pulp writer who had an even greater impact on crime films of the forties, was no one's idea of a stylist, in either short forms or long, and yet his contribution to the crime film was equally metaphoric: a knack of tying particular crimes to a pervasive sense of urban paranoia and a claustrophobic compression of dramatic time. So powerful was the appeal of Woolrich's nightmare fantcisies that apart from Erie Stanley Gardner, whose dozens of Perry Mason novels served as the basis for the 1957-66 television series, no crime writer approaches the number of Woolrich's source credits for movies. Films based on his novels and stories include Convicted (1938), Street of Historical and Cultural Overview Chance (1942), The Leopard Man (1943), Phantom Lady (1944), Mark of the Whistler (1944), Deadline at Dawn (1946), Black Angel (1946), The Chase (1946), Fall Guy (1947), Fear in the Night (1947), The Guilty (1947), / Wouldn't Be in Your Shoes (1948), Return of the Whistler (1948), The Night Has a Thousand Eyes (1948), The Window (1949), No Man of Her Own (1950) and its remakes I Married a Shadow (J'ai epouse une ombre, France, 1982) and Mrs. Winterbourne (1996), Rear Window (1954), and a pair of French adaptations directed by Frangois Truffaut, The Bride Wore Black (La Mariee etait en noir, 1967) and Mississippi Mermaid (La Sirene du Mississippi, 1969). The indirect influence of his fiction on other films noirs extends even further. One reason filmmakers in this period were more aware of the liter- ary traditions their work was following was that they were different filmmcikers. The rise of Nazism and the coming of World War II had dri- ven a generation of European filmmakers, including such important crime-film directors as Fritz Lang (Fury, 1936; You Only Live Once, 1937; The Woman in the Window, 1944; Scarlet Street, 1945; The Big Heat, 1953), Robert Siodmeik (Phantom Lady; The Spiral Staircase, 1946; The Killers, 1946; The Dark Mirror, 1946; Criss Cross, 1949), and Billy Wilder (Double Indemnity, 1944; Sunset Blvd, 1950; Some Like It Hot, 1959), to the United States, where they were joined by British emigre Alfred Hitchcock (Rebecca, 1940; Strangers on a Train, 1951; Rear Window; Vertigo, 1958; Psycho, 1960). Worldly, ambitious, and sophisticated, many of these European filmmakers managed to adapt to the big bud- gets of Hollywood studios while meiintaining their sense of expressive visual style and their fondness for literate dialogue. Their attempt to use criminal plots to encapsulate the audience's whole world was hal- lowed by recognition from French critics, if not by American, as early as 1946, when the term film noir first appeared in print in describing the style of five crime films first released in 1944: The Woman in the Window, Laura, Phantom Lady, Double Indemnity, and Murder, My Sweet. The noir cycle, which continued through the mid-1950s, featured amateur criminals - people who did not think of themselves as crim- inals at all - trapped in ordinary situations gone wrong, using every- day drives for love and success as the basis for crimiucil nightmares driven by the expressionistic psychopathology of everyday life rather than the imperatives of Depression economics. The weak hero sucked into a life of crime by the treacherous femme fatale, the tough private eye hoping to outwit the criminals who owned his city, the maze of Crime Films rain-slick night streets leading nowhere, the hallucinatory contrasts between glaring white faces and deep black skies, the lush orchestral scores ratcheting up moments of emotional intensity still further - all of these figures were familiar to film-noir audiences not from the head- lines, but from a mythic world created mainly by other movies. When the inevitable reaction against the expressionistic world of film noir set in, it focused on style rather than figuration. The semi- documentary approach pioneered by the anti-Nazi thriller The House on 92nd Street (1945) flourished in the location shooting of films like Kiss of Death (1947), Call Northside 777 (1948), and The Naked City (1948), with its you-are-there voice-over prologue and epilogue deliv- ered by producer Mark Hellinger: \"There are eight million stories in the naked city. This has been one of them.\" Although the crime film seemed poised to follow a new trend toward documentary realism, Robert Wise showed in The Set-Up (1949) that a realistic handling of mise-en-scene, coupled with the unfolding of the story in real time, could serve as the basis for a new, harder-edged expressionism, and it wcis this amalgam of realism emd expressionism that sparked crime movies as different as D.O.A. (1950), Sunset Blvd., and Detective Story (1951). By the end of the decade, home-grown American critics were be- ginning to look more closely at the figurative power of popular films. While disclaiming any special artistry for individual Hollywood prod- ucts, highbrow critics like Parker Tyler and Robert Warshow regarded Hollywood itself as a stage for repressed American cultural anxieties, which seemed to be running at an all-time high in the years immediate- ly following the war, when the national identity the country had con- structed for itself Wcis in danger of collapsing along with the national project of winning the war. As Joseph Samuels (Sam Levene) prophet- ically tells Sgt. Montgomery, the anti-Semitic veteran who will soon murder him in Crossfire (1947): Maybe it's because for four years now we've been focusing ... on one little peanut. The \"win-the-war\" peanut, that was all. Get it over, eat that peanut. All at once, no peanut. Now we start looking at each other again. We don't know what we're supposed to do. . . . We're too used to fightin'. But we just don't know what to fight. It was time for the crime film, armed with its newly acknowledged metaphoric power to diagnose hidden social problems, to be pressed into service in shoring up a new national identity. Historical and Cultural Overview Criminal Culture and Mass Culture Criminal subcultures had already been posed as socicil microcosms throughout the 1940s. More explicitly than any earlier prison film, Brute Force (1947) offered its prison as existential social metaphor for a meaningless, tragically unjust round of activities that would end only in death. The boxing cycle of the later 1940s (Body and Soul, 1947; Champion, 1949; The Set-Up), besides treating the ring as one more ex- otic milieu to be mined for its sociological interest, insistently equated it with one more inescapable prison. White Heat inaugurated a cycle of films using crime melodrama to tame the omnipresent danger of the nuclear bomb. The power of White Heat's psychotic gang leader, Cody Jarrett (James Cagney), is linked to uncontrollable technological forces like the stecim generated by a railroad engine, the \"white-hot buzz saw\" that he feels inside his head, and the natural-gas refinery he invades in the film's climactic sequence. Faced with Jarrett's outlaw power, the police have recourse to superior technology of their own, pursuing Cody's mother in radio- directed cars and plotting, by means of a radio-tracking device, the course of the truck that takes the Jarrett gang to their last job. The subtext is clear: When threatened by technological nightmares, fight fire with fire.^^ Interestingly, this subtext remains virtually unchanged in two later crime films that otherwise have little to do with each other, or with White Heat. The Big Heat (1953) and Kiss Me Deadly (1955). All three films use explicitly apocalyptic imagery both to indicate the danger- ous extent of the criminals' threats and to depict the cleansing de- struction of the criminals. In The Big Heat, the apocalyptic fury asso- ciated with the A-bomb's fearsome capacity to burn, maim, and kill individuals and whole communities is unleashed when Mrs. Duncan (Jeanette Nolan), a crooked cop's widow, is shot and murderous thug Vince Stone (Lee Marvin) scalded by the thug's former moll, Debby Marsh (Gloria Grahame). Debby's position beyond the pale of social morals and her own scalding by Stone - which has given the face of which she was so vain the half-scarred, half-beautiful look of a Dick Tracy grotesque - allow her a greater freedom to avenge herself than the upright, widower-cop hero Dave Bannion (Glenn Ford) could ever have. By killing Mrs. Duncan, Debby releases \"the big heat\" - intense police activity based on evidence against big-city crime boss Lagana (Alexander Scourby) and his organization that the cop's widow had Crime Films safely stowed - which the film persistently links to images of cata- strophically uncontrolled power and the \"traumatic consequences\" of nuclear holocaust. i9 The much darker Kiss Me Deadly pits another social outsider, \"bedroom dick\" Mike Hammer (Ralph Meeker), against a lineup of criminal plotters and government conspirators, leading him literally inside the body of a dead woman for the key to what his secretary dubs \"the Great Whatsit\" - an atom bomb waiting in a locker of the Hollywood Athletic Club - while at the same time condemning Hammer's dim, brutal machismo, whose effects are as disastrous as the criminals' schemes. In each of these films, as in the prison and boxing films of the for- ties, crime is used as a way of converting noncriminal but potentially unbearable social anxieties into entertainment by scaling down their threat from the global to the subcultural level, linking the threat to a series of charismatic heroes and villains who can encourage a strong rooting interest, and directing the audience's concern along the com- fortably generic lines of the crime film. Ten years earlier, the crime- reporter hero's editor in Foreign Correspondent (1940) had cut the Nazi threat in Europe down to size with the injunction, \"There's a crime hatching on that bedeviled continent.\" Now films like Kiss Me Deadly showed how the crime genre could be enlisted to domesticate the equally imponderable threat of global holocaust. The Asphalt Jungle (1950), released at the beginning of a new dec- ade, consolidated this tendency to define criminal subculture as a mir- ror of American culture. The cycle of caper films it exemplifies, from foreshadowings like The Killers and Criss Cross to full-blown later ex- amples like The Killing (1956) and Odds against Tomorrow (1959), used the planning and execution of a robbery that infallibly went wrong to dramatize the irreducible unreasonableness of life. Its aura of existen- tial despair made the caper film popular with European filmmakers, whose homages to Hollywood, beginning with Rihfi (Du Rihfi chez les hommes, 1955) and The Swindle (11 bidone, 1955), broadened into a wider and more complex mixture of nostalgia and critique with the coming of the French New Wave, which produced such notable crime films cis Frantic, also known a& Elevator to the Gallows (Ascenseur pour I'echafaud, 1958), Breathless (A bout de souffle, 1959), Shoot the Piano Player (Tirez sur le pianiste, 1960}, Alphaville (1965), and The Unfaith- ful Wife (La femme infidele, 1969). In the meantime, the doom-laden atmosphere of caper films was lightened in such British Ealing come- dies as The Lavender Hill Mob (1951) and The Ladykillers (1955), and Historical and Cultural Overview the Italian / soliti ignoti (1958), a notable U.S. success as Big Deal on Madonna Street. Hollywood was slower to adopt a comic attitude to- ward the big heist, with the international coproduction Topkapi (1964, directed by Rififi alumnus Jules Dassin) the pivotal film, followed by Gambit (1966), How to Steal a Million (1966), and The Hot Rock (1972) and Bank Shot (1974), both adapted from Donald E. Westlake's caper novels about the comiccilly frustrated thief John Dortmunder. Far more surprising than the rise of the caper film as an anatomy of noncriminal society or its leavening through the comedy of ineptness is the enlistment of crime films to promote family values. The author- ity of the 1930 Production Code had become so shaky that it wcis suc- cessfully challenged by Fox, which released Otto Preminger's The Moon Is Blue without a seal in 1953, and Warner Bros., which released Elia Kazan's Baby Doll in 1956 despite the condemnation of the Legion of Decency. In the wake of the anticommunist witch-hunts of 1947 and 1950, however, calls for central control of the mass-entertainment me- dia's content remained strong, particularly when those media target- ed children. Psychologist Fredric Wertham's influential study Seduc- tion of the Innocent (1954), attacking comic books, especially crime comics, as \"an agent with harmful potentialities,\"20 provoked wide- spread public outrage and a Congressional investigation under the direction of Senator Estes Kefauver. In response, industry leader DC (Detective Comics), which published the adventures of Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, and many of their superfriends, rushed to join other publishers in establishing a Comics Code that would pre- clude any government censorship, drawing a sharp line between code and noncode comics that would prepare the way for underground comics ten years later. At the same time, the burgeoning popularity of television, which was rapidly taking control of the formulaic genres that would have been Hollywood's province only a few years earlier, created a demand for formula melodrameis suitable for family viewing that could fit into slots of half an hour or an hour.2i Some popular radio anthology pro- grams like Suspense and The Whistler made successful transitions to television; others, like Alfred Hitchcock Presents and its successor The Alfred Hitchcock Hour, were created especicilly for the new medium. The mainstay of television programming, however, became the half- hour comedy or drama series that followed the adventures of a contin- uing character.
