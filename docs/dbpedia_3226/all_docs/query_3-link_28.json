        "text": "SATURDAY, JULY 20 AT 11:00AM\n\nRegular Admission Prices\n\nPasses Accepted\n\nExperience the greatest films from Hollywood’s Golden Age back on the big screen, every week at The Loft Cinema!\n\nA hurricane swells outside, but it’s nothing compared to the storm inside the hotel at Key Largo, as Humphrey Bogart, Lauren Bacall and Edward G. Robinson battle for survival in director John Huston’s electrifying, sweltering, Oscar-winning thriller. A run-down hotel in the Florida Keys becomes the site of spine-tingling danger when world-weary ex-GI Frank McCloud (Bogart) blows into town and runs up against sadistic mobster Johnny Rocco (Robinson) who’s holding the staff and guests of the coastal Hotel Largo hostage as a hurricane bears down on them. Hotel owner Nora Temple (Bacall), her invalid father-in-law James Temple (Lionel Barrymore), and Gaye Dawn (Claire Trevor, whose searing performance won her a Best Supporting Actress Oscar), Rocco’s gold-hearted, booze-soaked moll and part-time chanteuse, are drawn into the fray as tensions mount, the weather turns from bad to worse, and everyone wonders who’ll be left alive on the morning after. John Huston’s film version of Maxwell Anderson’s 1939 play oozes delicious menace in every frame, from the claustrophobic setting to the vicious dialogue to the sweat-drenched close-ups of the increasingly rattled hotel inhabitants. (Dir. by John Huston, 1948, USA, 101 mins., Not Rated)"
