        "text": "The Film Noir Odyssey\n\nWriter: Richard Brooks & John Huston\n\nBased on the play by Maxwell Anderson\n\nDirector: John Huston\n\nCinematographer: Karl Freund\n\nMusic: Max Steiner\n\nCast: Humphrey Bogart, Edward G. Robinson, Claire Trevor, Lionel Barrymore, Lauren Bacall\n\nRelease: July 16, 1948\n\nStudio: Warner Bros.\n\nAwards: Claire Trevor won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar. Also nominated in that category was Agnes Moorehead in “Johnny Belinda.” Director/Co-Writer John Huston won Oscars for Best Director and Best Screenplay… but for “The Treasure of The Sierra Madre.”\n\nPercent Noir: 60%\n\nI remember loving “Key Largo” when I was a kid, and that amazing penultimate shot of Lauren Bacall throwing the shutter open to allow in the sun is engrained in my mind in the same way other iconic film moments are to the public consciousness. Even though I remembered almost nothing else about the film, I have been so eager to get to it since the inception of the Odyssey, even though a tiny part of me kept whispering that there was no way it could ever live up to expectations.\n\nAnd it didn’t – but that doesn’t mean it’s not still a damn good movie.\n\nHumphrey Bogart is Frank, a former officer in the war who has come to a hotel in Key Largo to speak to the father and widow of a friend of his who died in the war. The father is James (Lionel Barrymore) and the widow is Nora (Bacall), and both run a hotel which is getting shut up for an incoming hurricane. Also there are a group of criminals led by notorious gangster Rocco (Edward G. Robinson), who hold the others hostage and wait out the storm so they can pull off an illegal money exchange.\n\nThough “Key Largo” has many good things in it, Robinson is by far the best. In fact, this may well be my favorite performance in his career of great performances. Screenwriters Richard Brooks and John Huston (who also directed) smartly keep Rocco offscreen for the first act, building up suspense until his first appearance, and boy is it a doozy! Robinson seems to be relishing every syllable of dialogue… every soulless move… every cocky gesture. It’s one hell of a lot of fun to watch. Here is a man who at first appears like a blunt object but, as the movie progresses, you realize his real insidiousness.\n\nHe’s central to the best scene in the film – his “girlfriend” Gaye (Claire Trevor) is an alcoholic going through major withdrawal… she can barely function without a drink. Rocco offers her one, but only if she’ll sing for it. So Gaye sings “Moanin’ Low” a capella, summoning up all her strength to push through the lyrics… she needs that drink. She finishes and Rocco refuses to give it to her, then berates her – her looks, her voice… her everything. Rocco is terrifying here, and Gaye is so pathetic that our sympathy is through the roof.\n\nTrevor (“Murder, My Sweet,” “Born to Kill”) is the other standout performance of the film, and I suspect her role was much smaller as production began and then expanded once Huston saw her excellent work. At the beginning she stumbles when actually playing drunk, but watching her go through alcohol withdrawal and become the heroine of the film is quite amazing – watching her beg and plead to go with Rocco on the boat near the climax is heartbreaking… until you realize she was stealing his gun. It’s the “stand up and cheer” moment of the movie, and the look in Trevor’s eyes as she secretly hands the gun to Bogart’s character is astonishing – you can’t teach that.\n\nBogart’s role isn’t as showy because it’s so interior – the entire emotional arc hinges on him making the choice to battle Rocco, and he acquits himself well. I doubt many other actors could have pulled it off, actually – they would be drowned by Robinson and Trevor. The news is less good for Barrymore and especially Bacall, who appears to be in the movie because… uh… er… I know that Nora is supposed to represent goodness and steer Dick into action, but with a little cutting and pasting, her character could be deleted and the emotional arc could be absorbed by James and Gaye. What’s worse, Bacall seems to realize that she’s the odd man out here, and doesn’t give a good performance as a result. A pity.\n\nAlso a pity is the Native American subplot, which has a members of a local Seminole tribe friendly with James. They are subservient and seek guidance from him in all their decisions, which is problematic enough, but things get super-awful when they spend the entire hurricane on the porch of the hotel! Denied entry by Rocco, the Native Americans become nothing more than a plot mechanism to show Rocco’s awfulness, which would have come across perfectly clear without it. Worse, I fundamentally do not buy the conceit that a group of people (one of whom is 104 years old!) could survive a hurricane sitting on a porch next to the beach. It is so unrealistic it grinds the movie to a halt every time Huston cuts back to it.\n\nSpeaking of Huston, he collaborated with iconic cinematographer Karl Freund (“Metropolis,” “Mad Love”) here, and I was surprised how flat the hotel seemed. Freund does solid work in the larger spaces with shadows, but the smaller rooms and hallways do not feel properly claustrophobic. There are a couple great shots outside on the dock after the storm subsides that linger long after the film ends, though. And as for the hurricane itself, it is suitably terrifying, with some impressive miniature special effects work driving the horror of the storm home (and underlining that there is no way those Native Americans could have survived). Apparently some of the effects were either recycled in or recycled from (it’s unclear who stole from who) another noir called “Night Unto Night,” which is unseen my me.\n\n“Key Largo” is a very good movie but, considering its pedigree, it should have been a masterpiece. Robinson’s performance is so amazing that it should be mentioned in the same breath as The Preacher in “Night of the Hunter” or the Joker, but unfortunately I think the role has gotten lost in the shuffle of history because the movie isn’t on that same level. Sure, it won’t blow you away (no pun intended… actually, maybe a little), but it’s still essential noir. Just watch all of John Huston’s other great films first.\n\nScore: ****"
