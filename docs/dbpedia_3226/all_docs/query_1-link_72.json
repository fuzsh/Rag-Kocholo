        "text": "AMS 304 / LAS 312 / ENV 324\n\nThis course studies how the environment has related to the construction of race and racism. By focusing on case studies around the globe, we will learn about the racial politics of waste, food consumption, energy, and climate change in diverse social and cultural contexts. Since the course moves chronologically through different historical periods, students will learn how dominant ideas about race and the environment have evolved over time. They will also examine how capitalism, imperialism, and colonialism have recreated environmental racism as a structure and a technology of power.\n\nInstructors: Juan M. Rubio\n\nAMS 317 / MTD 321 / THR 322 / ENG 249\n\nIn this course, we'll examine the musicals of Stephen Sondheim from COMPANY (1970) to ROAD SHOW (2009) as a lens onto America. How have Sondheim's musicals conversed with American history and American society since the mid-20th century? How do Sondheim's musicals represent America and Americans, and how have various productions shaped and re-shaped those representations? We'll explore how Sondheim and his collaborators used the mainstream, popular, and commercial form of musical theatre to challenge, critique, deconstruct, and possibly reinforce some of America's most enduring myths.\n\nInstructors: Stacy E. Wolf\n\nAMS 334 / ENG 234\n\nWhy did three American genres become classics in the same twenty-year period, 1936-1956? Part of the answer lies in global disruptions that unsettled codes of behavior. Part lies in film innovations that altered cinema itself. But more than this intersection of social and formal transformations, the decisive answer lies in a handful of directors who reconfigured gendered relations in three generic forms. The surprising correspondences that emerge among these classic films, if also the obvious divergences even within single genres, that will focus our discussion.\n\nInstructors: Lee C. Mitchell\n\nAMS 398 / DAN 312 / GSS 346\n\nThe fat body operates at the conjuncture of political economy, beauty standards, and health. This seminar asks, How does this \"f-word\" discipline and regulate bodies in /as public? What is the \"ideal\" American public body and who gets to occupy that position? How are complex personhood, expressivity, health, and citizenship contested cultural and political economic projects? We will examine the changing history, aesthetics, politics, and meanings of fatness using dance, performance, memoirs, and media texts as case studies. Intersectional dimensions of the fat body are central to the course. No previous performance experience necessary.\n\nInstructors: Judith Hamera\n\nAMS 403 / SOC 403\n\nThe aim of this course is to provide you with the tools to think about elites within democratic societies. The course is divided into four modular units: (1) The Decline of Aristocracy, (2) Creating an American Elite, (3) Elites and Power, and (4) A New Elite. For each of these units we will spend one week reading a theoretical approach to understanding the theme, one week on an empirical case to put this theory in context, and one week reading a novel that works with the themes of the theory and research we have read.\n\nInstructors: Shamus R. Khan\n\nAMS 404 / CWR 404 / ENG 454\n\nIn-depth look into current US issues, with emphasis on democracy and the question 'What is America?'-socially, culturally, politically. Seminar immerses students into nonfiction literature, particularly as it illuminates the idea of \"America\" and the state of \"Americans\". Together we explore seminal non-fiction writing about America, the better to hone students' ability to think and write critically about the public sphere, and to write intelligently about their lives. Seminar examines how major writers, and students, best integrate research, socio-political analysis, literary skill, to craft publicly valuable, self-revelatory writing.\n\nInstructors: Richard Benjamin\n\nAMS 415 / ENV 415 / HUM 415 / ENG 435\n\nCreation stories from Turtle Island foreground an integral connection between land and story. \"Sky Woman Falling\" contains key ecological and environmental knowledge. This course explores the relationship between land and story, emphasizing seeds as sources of sovereignty and repositories of knowledge across generations. We focus on Native New Jersey while understanding the history of this land in the context of global indigeneity and settler colonialism. Course literature engages seeds, land, and the environment from a perspective that crosses the disciplines of American studies, literature, history, ecology, and environmental studies.\n\nInstructors: Tessa L. DesmondSarah Rivett\n\nAMS 442 / HIS 470 / JDS 442\n\nFor over two centuries, Lower East Side tenements have housed immigrant and migrant families. Since 1988, the Tenement Museum has researched and told the stories of Jewish, German, Irish, Italian, Puerto Rican, Black and Chinese families, connecting individual family stories to larger historical questions. This course offers the unique opportunity to dive deeply into the research and methodology. What sources can we use to tell the story of \"ordinary people,\" and how do those sources change over time? How do contemporary questions of American identity connect to the stories that we tell?\n\nInstructors: Annie Polland\n\nAAS 322 / LAS 301 / LAO 322 / AMS 323\n\nThis course investigates how people of African descent in the Americas have forged social, political, and cultural ties across geopolitical and linguistic boundaries. We will interrogate the transnational dialogue between African Americans and Afro-Latin Americans using case studies from Brazil, Cuba, Haiti, Puerto Rico, and the Dominican Republic. We will explore how Black activists have partnered to challenge racism and economic inequality, while also considering why efforts to mobilize Afro-descendants across the Americas have often been undermined by mutual misunderstandings.\n\nInstructors: Reena N. Goldthree\n\nAAS 380 / AMS 382\n\nThis course explores how ideas and discourses about race shape how public policy is debated, adopted, and implemented. Black social movements and geopolitical considerations prompted multiple public policy responses to racial discrimination throughout the twentieth century. Despite these policy responses, discrimination persists, raising theoretical concerns about the dynamics of inclusion and exclusion, political representation, the role of the state (meaning government or law) in promoting social justice, and the role of social movements and civil society in democratizing policymaking and addressing group oppression.\n\nInstructors: Naomi Murakawa\n\nANT 223 / AMS 223 / AAS 224 / URB 224\n\nThis class aims to explore transnational issues in policing. Drawing heavily upon anthropological methods and theory, we aim neither to vindicate nor contest the police's right to use force (whether a particular instance was a violation of law), but instead, to contribute to the understanding of force (its forms, justifications, interpretations). The innovative transnational approach to policing developed during the semester will allow for a cross-cultural comparative analysis that explores larger rubrics of policing in a comprehensive social scientific framework. We hope that you are ready to explore these exciting and urgent issues with us.\n\nInstructors: Aisha M. Beliso-De JesúsLaurence Ralph\n\nANT 245 / ENV 245 / AMS 245\n\nHow do we grapple with the lasting, unintended impacts of science, engineering and medicine in \"the nation's service and the service of humanity\"? What lessons can we learn from the past to conduct morally sound research and generate culturally inclusive knowledge? We explore perspectives from indigenous studies to approach the intersection of Princeton's history, nuclear science, settler colonialism and environmental racism to collectively imagine a more holistic and inclusive approach to studying science, technology and the environment. Students will conduct original research that draws from and contributes to the Nuclear Princeton project.\n\nInstructors: Ryo Morimoto\n\nASA 320 / GSS 377 / AMS 220 / SAS 318\n\nAsian Americans have experienced a long history of contestation regarding gender and sexuality. To examine this saga, we will begin with Black and Asian feminist critiques of normative gender and sexuality. We will then turn to sociocultural history, analyzing legal cases policing intimacy, and the construction of the gendered and sexualized Asian woman in late 19th C. San Francisco. We will then examine histories of normative forms of sexuality, politics and social worlds of queer and trans communities, gendered labor, representation and the post-911 era.\n\nInstructors: Rishi Ramesh Guné\n\nENG 259 / AMS 259\n\nThis course offers a survey of the varieties of animation across the twentieth and twenty-first centuries as well as their critical reception. Animation is a ubiquitous form, present across media and in advertising. Many viewers take its components and effects for granted. But the archive of animation fundamentally complicates any easy assumptions about \"realism\" in the twentieth century; animation, moreover, challenges assumptions about bodies and their functions, exaggerating their features and functions, promoting alternatives to more mundane notions of life and liveliness, and relatedly, to ideas of time, contingency, and experience.\n\nInstructors: Monica HuertaRuss Leo\n\nENG 358 / LAS 385 / AMS 396 / AAS 343\n\nLooking to the many abyssal histories of the Caribbean, this course will explore major issues that have shaped Caribbean Literature: colonialism, indigeneity, iterations of enslavement, creolization, migration, diaspora, revolution, tropicality, and climate crisis. During our readings, we will be attentive to the Caribbean as a space of first colonial contact, as a place where the plantation system reigned, and as the site of the first successful slave revolt. These past legacies haunt contemporary conditions across the Caribbean in ways that necessitate attention to gender, race, and environment.\n\nInstructors: Annabelle E. HaynesChristina León\n\nENG 404 / NES 404 / AMS 402\n\nHow does political upheaval - especially in the form of revolution - shape memoir? This course focuses on the work of writers, particularly those of Middle Eastern origin who live in the Americas (Mexico, the United States, and Cuba) to explore this question. It pairs their memoirs with other examples of their writing (letters, eulogies, and essays) and artistic production to study issues of post-coloniality, gender, race, and nationalism.\n\nInstructors: Sarah Gualtieri\n\nENG 411 / AMS 411 / AAS 413\n\nThis course will focus on two \"representative men\" of the nineteenth century. It will propose that Emerson and Douglass are two of America's greatest defenders, precisely because they are its greatest mourners. While they point to America's unfulfilled promise of universal representation, they seek to realize it in their own acts of writing. This course attends to these writers' relations to the period's broader discourses surrounding race, ecology, empire, and nation-building. Alongside Emerson and Douglass, we will read short texts by naturalists, politicians, and activists such as J.B. Lamarck, James Madison, and Ida B. Wells.\n\nInstructors: Eduardo L. CadavaDenise Xu\n\nENV 238 / AMS 238\n\nIntroduces students to cross-disciplinary concepts that shape how complex environmental challenges are defined, studied, and addressed. These concepts include biodiversity, climate change, ecosystem, environmental racism, pollution, sustainability, and wilderness. Examines a wide range of case studies - from the U.S. National Park Service and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to the First National People of Color Environmental Leadership Summit and Extinction Rebellion.\n\nInstructors: Allison Carruth\n\nHIS 271 / AMS 271\n\nThis course is designed to introduce students to the historical processes and issues that have shaped the lives if Indigenous Americans over the past five centuries. We will explore the ways that the diverse peoples who lived in the Americas constructed different kinds of societies and how their goals and political decisions shaped the lives of all those who would come to inhabit the North American continent. The course requires students to read and analyze historical documents and contemporary literature, and includes a visit to the National Museum of the American Indian in New York City.\n\nInstructors: Elizabeth Ellis\n\nHIS 384 / GSS 384 / AMS 424\n\nThis course examines the history of gender and sexuality across the 20th century, with emphasis on both regulation and resistance. Topics include early homosexual subcultures; the commercialization of sex; reproduction and its limitation; sex, gender, and war; cold war sexual containment; the feminist movement; conservative backlash; AIDS politics; same-sex marriage; Hillary; and many others.\n\nInstructors: Margot Canaday\n\nHIS 393 / AAS 393 / SPI 389 / AMS 423\n\nFrom \"Chinese opium\" to Oxycontin, and from cocaine and \"crack\" to BiDil, drug controversies reflect enduring debates about the role of medicine, the law, the policing of ethnic identity, and racial difference. This course explores the history of controversial substances (prescription medicines, over-the-counter products, black market substances, psychoactive drugs), and how, from cigarettes to alcohol and opium, they become vehicles for heated debates over immigration, identity, cultural and biological difference, criminal character, the line between legality and illegality, and the boundaries of the normal and the pathological.\n\nInstructors: Keith A. Wailoo\n\nLAS 308 / THR 370 / AMS 298 / LAO 308\n\nThis class will look at the works of Latin American and Latinx women playwrights who have created works that are either adaptations of mythical Greek heroines or reinterpretations of the historical Latin American and Caribbean record. These works challenge our visions of history: they use the power of the canon to make us think about the weight of tradition, and use that weight to shatter our preconceptions of gender, race, and identity. The course will include dialogues/workshops with contemporary artists and scholars, and will include performance, creative writing, and digital work as part of our class assignments and/or final project.\n\nInstructors: Lilianne Lugo Herrera\n\nPOL 319 / AMS 219 / AAS 386\n\nThe 14th Amendment is the centerpiece of constitutional debates about equality. This class explores the development and ongoing debates over the 14th Amendment, including the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses. We also give attention to some additional statutes, notably Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The readings will largely be rooted in decisions by the U.S. Supreme Court, with a focus on race, sex, sexuality, religion, and disability. What constitutes discrimination and 'anti-discrimination'? What ought to be the goal for understanding equality, diversity, and acceptance?\n\nInstructors: Paul Frymer\n\nPOL 344 / AAS 344 / AMS 244\n\nAfrican Americans in the United States have encountered myriad barriers to their quest for inclusion. Drawing on a mix of history and social science, we will come to understand why certain segments of America oppose the full inclusion of African Americans. We will also discuss the political strategies undertaken by the Black community to combat social, political, and economic injustices. The first half of the course will focus on historical antecedents such as the civil rights movement and the Black Power movement. The second half of the course will focus on the nature of contemporary racial attitudes in the 21st century.\n\nInstructors: LaFleur Stephens-Dougan\n\nREL 397 / AMS 297\n\nHave you ever wanted to change the world? So have lots of other people. In this course, we'll explore how American Christians have participated in social movements since the early 20th century, and we'll see how religion fits into their mobilization strategies. We'll focus on four case studies: the Catholic Worker movement; Black church women during the Civil Rights movement; the early Christian Right; and advocacy around HIV/AIDS and LGBTQ+ rights. This course centers ethnographic research methods in the study of religion, and students will learn skills such as data coding, participant observation, and qualitative interviewing.\n\nInstructors: Lauren R. Kerby\n\nSOC 373 / AMS 428\n\nThis seminar focuses on the structural and institutional foundations of racial discrimination in the United States. It emphasizes the contributions of sociologists, some of whom will participate as invited guests. The course gives a historical overview followed by an investigation of key legislative actions and economic factors inhibiting racial equality. Subsequent topics include migration and immigration; urban development; and residential segregation. The end of the course reviews resistance movements and policies aimed at addressing systemic racism, including restorative justice and reparations.\n\nInstructors: Patricia Fernández-Kelly\n\nSPI 327 / AMS 327 / POL 428\n\nAs the United States has increasingly looked to its federal government to provide policies and protect rights that benefit its population, how have the branches of government risen to the occasion? Where have they struggled? What obstacles have they faced? What complexities have arisen over time? This course is an investigation of the institutional, political, and legal development of the unique \"American state\" in the contemporary era.\n\nInstructors: Sarah L. Staszak\n\nSPI 387 / SOC 387 / AMS 487\n\nFor the last 60 years, the United States has been engaged in a near-constant effort to reform American schools. In this course, we will make sense of competing explanations of educational performance and evaluate the possibilities for and barriers to improving American public schools and for reducing educational disparities by family socioeconomic status, race, and gender. In doing so, we will grapple with the challenges that researchers and practitioners face in evaluating educational policies.\n\nInstructors: Jennifer L. Jennings\n\nSPI 393 / GHP 406 / AMS 410\n\nThe Affordable Care Act, enacted in 2010, was the defining (and polarizing) initiative of the Obama era, with provisions to expand health insurance coverage, control health care costs, and improve the health care delivery system. This course will focus on the history of health reform, as well as implementation challenges since the law's enactment. We will examine the federal regulatory process, the many legal challenges to the law, the role that states have played in implementation, and Congressional repeal efforts. We will also investigate the role of federalism in health care policy and the future of health care reform.\n\nInstructors: Heather H. Howard\n\nURB 356 / AMS 256 / LAS 395\n\nThis course considers theories and practices of reinterpreting landscape through the lenses of indigeneity, transnational feminism, and decoloniality. We will explore alternative ways of knowing and relating to places--thinking across space and time, built structures and material absences, borders and networks of relation--with a focus on the Americas. Discussions will engage spatial perspectives in geography, anthropology, and decolonial thought along with creative writing and multimedia work. Students will apply critical spatial practices by designing a digital project using textual, sonic, and visual modes to remap a selected site.\n\nInstructors: Mary Pena\n\nAmerica Then and Now\n\nAMS 101\n\nThis course introduces students to methods of American Studies through discussion of some of the signature ideas, events, and debates in and about America's past and present. It presents students various scholarly approaches to historical and mythic manifestations of America from local, national, and global perspectives and considers the historical and cognitive processes associated with the delineation of America. The course examines a wide range of material and media from the point of view of multiple fields of study.\n\nInstructors: William A. Gleason, Monica Huerta, Shamus R. Khan\n\nNative American Literature\n\nAMS 322 / ENG 242\n\nAn exploration of the written and oral literary traditions of Native American and Indigenous authors. This course offers an occasion to reflect on, critique, and contest settler colonialism or the dispossession of land and waters and the attempt to eliminate Indigenous people. The course will include a service-learning trip to the Munsee Three Sisters Medicinal Farm and an opportunity to learn some Lenape, the ancestral language of New Jersey.\n\nInstructors: Sarah Rivett\n\nCreative Ecologies: American Environmental Narrative and Art, 1980-2020\n\nAMS 354 / ART 355 / ENV 373\n\nThis seminar explores how writers and artists--alongside scientists and activists--have shaped American environmental thought from 1980 to today. The seminar asks: How do different media convey the causes and potential solutions to environmental challenges, ranging from biodiversity loss and food insecurity to pollution and climate change? What new art forms are needed to envision sustainable and just futures? Course materials include popular science writing, graphic narrative, speculative fiction, animation art, documentary film, and data visualization along with research from anthropology, ecology, history, literary studies, and philosophy.\n\nInstructors: Allison Carruth\n\nAdvanced Seminar in American Studies: American Empire, the Anthropocene, & Afrofuturism in Octavia E. Butler\n\nAMS 404 / AAS 405\n\nThis seminar takes up the works of science fiction pioneer Octavia E. Butler to explore the future of the American empire via a study of Afrofuturism and the Anthropocene. We will explore Afrofuturism's history and current status, especially in relation to the Anthropocene in the novels, short stories, and critical writings by and related to Butler's canon. We will pay close attention to how Butler's oeuvre charts the arc of American history from the Civil Rights Movement to the Iraq war and the significance of Butler's prophetic work that had dire warnings regarding climate change, white nationalism, and the waning of the American empire.\n\nInstructors: Susana Morris\n\nDiversity in Black America\n\nAAS 323 / AMS 321\n\nAs the demographics of Blacks in America change, we are compelled to rethink the dominant stories of who African Americans are, and from whence they come. In this seminar, we will explore the deep cultural, genealogical, national origin, regional, and class-based diversity of people of African descent in the United States. Materials for the course will include scholarly writings as well as memoirs and fiction. In addition to reading assignments, students will be expected to complete an ethnographic or oral history project based upon research conducted within a Black community in the U.S., and a music or visual art based presentation of work.\n\nInstructors: Imani Perry\n\nPostblack - Contemporary African American Art\n\nAAS 372 / ART 374 / AMS 372\n\nAs articulated by Thelma Golden, postblack refers to the work of African American artists who emerged in the 1990s with ambitious, irreverent, and sassy work. Postblack suggests the emergence of a generation of artists removed from the long tradition of Black affirmation of the Harlem Renaissance, Black empowerment of the Black Arts movement, and identity politics of the 1980s and early 90s. This seminar involves critical and theoretical readings on multiculturalism, race, identity, and contemporary art, and will provide an opportunity for a deep engagement with the work of African American artists of the past decade.\n\nInstructors: Chika O. Okeke-Agulu\n\nAsian Americana: Theorizing Race, Class, Gender and Sexuality Across Difference\n\nASA 361 / AMS 461 / GSS 330\n\nFrom the height of the Asian American movement began at San Francisco State in 1968, the question of where Asian diasporic communities fit within the American racial matrix has been of pivotal interest for scholars, students, activists and artists across genres. This class seeks to explore Asian Americans' social location in the US. Using a relational intersectional feminist approach, this class will examine Asian Americans positionality in relation to Indigenous, Black and Latinx communities throughout the country. Students will engage and hone Asian American Studies interdisciplinary methods (historical, literary and filmic analysis).\n\nInstructors: Rishi Ramesh Guné\n\nSpecial Topics in Creative Writing: Writing Political Fiction\n\nCWR 345 / AMS 345 / GSS 383\n\nIn traditional workshops content and context come second to craft. Here we will explore writing political fiction, the politics of fiction and writing as political engagement. We'll read widely, from the most realistic depictions of the American political process and the varieties of immigrant experience to the work of afrofuturists and feminists. The personal is the political and our frame will range from the global to the domestic. We will write stories that inhabit experiences other than our own. This course will allow students to make interdisciplinary connections between courses on history, politics and identity and creative writing.\n\nInstructors: A.M. Homes\n\nWounded Beauty\n\nENG 216 / AMS 216 / GSS 214\n\nThis course studies the entanglement between ideas of personhood and the history of ideas about beauty. How does beauty make and unmake persons -socially, legally and culturally- at the intersection of race, gender and aesthetics? Let us move beyond the good versus bad binary that dominates discussions of beauty to focus instead on how beauty in literature and culture have contributed to the conceptualization of modern, western personhood and its inverse (the inhuman, the inanimate, the object). We will trace beauty and its disruptions in the arenas of literature, visual culture, global capitalism, politics, law, science and technology.\n\nInstructors: Anne Cheng\n\nConspiracy in America\n\nENG 261 / AMS 357\n\nHow do we analyze conspiracy narratives and conspiratorial thinking at a moment when the government spies on its citizens and profitable technology companies have turned surveillance itself into an economic necessity? Under what historical, political, and economic conditions do conspiracies proliferate? In this course we analyze conspiracies, paranoia, rumors, and the contemporary economies of dis/information and post-facts. Course material will be drawn from American history, from the 19th century to the present, and will include manifestos, films, novels, online fora, and theoretical texts in psychoanalysis, narrative theory and politics.\n\nInstructors: Zahid R. Chaudhary\n\nFeminist Futures: Contemporary S. F. by Women\n\nGSS 303 / AMS 313 / ENG 283\n\nFeminist Futures explores the way in which recent writers have transformed science fiction into speculative fiction - an innovative literary form capable of introducing and exploring new kinds of feminist, queer, and multi-cultural perspectives. These books confront the limitations imposed on women and imagine transformative possibilities for thinking about gender roles and relationships, the body, forms of power, and political and social structures.\n\nInstructors: Alfred Bendixen\n\nU.S. Legal History\n\nHIS 379 / SPI 362 / AMS 420\n\nThis class views legal history broadly as the relationship between formal law, popular legal culture, state governance, and social change in the U.S., from the colonial period to the present. We will examine changing conceptions of rights, equality, justice, the public interest. We also will consider questions about the operation of law in U.S. history: How is law made? What do people expect from law? Who controls law? How did that change over time? These questions open up a rich, layered past in which the law was a source of authority that mediated social and political conflicts, even as those conflicts ultimately changed the law.\n\nInstructors: Laura F. Edwards\n\nUnrest and Renewal in Urban America\n\nHIS 388 / URB 388 / AMS 380 / AAS 388\n\nThis course surveys the history of cities in the United States from colonial settlement to the present. Over centuries, cities have symbolized democratic ideals of \"melting pots\" and cutting-edge innovation, as well as urban crises of disorder, decline, crime, and poverty. Urban life has concentrated extremes like rich and poor; racial and ethnic divides; philanthropy and greed; skyscrapers and parks; violence and hope; downtown and suburb. The course examines how cities in U.S. history have brokered revolution, transformation and renewal, focusing on class, race, gender, immigration, capitalism, and the built environment.\n\nInstructors: Alison E. Isenberg\n\nBorderlands, Border Lives\n\nHIS 484 / LAS 484 / LAO 484 / AMS 484\n\nThe international border looms large over current national and international political debates. While this course will consider borders across the world, it will focus on the U.S.-Mexico border, and then on the Guatemala-Mexico and U.S.-Canada border. This course examines the history of the formation of the U.S. border from the colonial period to the present. Borders represent much more than just political boundaries between nation states. The borderlands represents the people who live between two cultures and two nations. This course will also study those individuals who have lived in areas surrounding borders or crossed them.\n\nInstructors: Rosina A. Lozano\n\nIntroduction to Latino/a/x Studies\n\nLAO 201 / AMS 211 / LAS 201\n\nThis introductory course examines what it means to be Latino/a in the United States and how Latino/a culture has been defined in historical and contemporary contexts. In this course students will learn how legacies of colonialism and modernity affect Latino/as and how they negotiate empire, identity, language, culture, and notions of home. Students will learn how certain Latino/a cultures and communities were formed in the United States, as well as how gender, class, race, and sexuality inform these ideas of identity in a given space and place.\n\nInstructors: Keishla Rivera-Lopez\n\nLatinx Autobiography\n\nLAO 218 / ENG 258 / AMS 218\n\nThis course begins from the disjoint and relation between the narrated autobiography and the lived life. In reading works by authors including Myriam Gurba, Wendy C. Ortiz, Carmen Maria Machado, Richard Rodriguez, and Junot Diaz, we will explore not only how writers experiment with the project of narrating a life that contends with the structures and strictures of racial matrices, gender binaries, and traumatic abuse - but also how writers test the boundaries of what autobiographies more generally are and are for.\n\nInstructors: Monica Huerta\n\nAmerican Deaf Culture\n\nLIN 215 / AMS 214 / GHP 315\n\nThis course explores the history, culture, and language of the Deaf in the United States. The first part of the course focuses on the history of Deaf people in the United States. The second part discusses various aspects of Deaf culture: language, literature, art, politics, etc. The third part critically examines different issues facing Deaf people here in the United States and around the world. These issues include audism, linguicism, ableism, intersectionality, disability rights, bioethics, and education. No American Sign Language knowledge required.\n\nInstructors: Noah A. Buchholz\n\nSecession, the Civil War, and the Constitution\n\nPOL 488 / HUM 488 / AMS 488\n\nThis seminar explores constitutional and legal issues posed by the attempted secession of eleven states of the Federal Union in 1860-1865 and the civil war this attempt triggered. Issues to be examined include the nature of secession movements (both in terms of the constitutional controversy posed in 1860-1861 and modern secession movements), the development of the \"war powers\" doctrine of the presidency, the suspension by the writ of habeas corpus, the use of military tribunals, and abuses of civil rights on both sides of the Civil War.\n\nInstructors: Allen Carl Guelzo\n\nCasting: History, Theory, Practice\n\nTHR 339 / AMS 439 / GSS 349\n\nThis course surveys the history, theory and practice of casting within U.S. entertainment industries over the last 150 years to evince the creative, industrial and social features of the always-evolving casting apparatus. As we explicate the interpretive dilemma of deciding which actor is \"right\" (or \"wrong\") for a role, we will also confront how casting structures determine who does (and does not) have access to artistic opportunity; how exclusionary and exploitative casting practices persist; and how the artistic, social and ethical implications of the casting apparatus have inspired efforts to transform it.\n\nInstructors: Brian E. Herrera\n\nIn Living Color: Performing the Black '90s\n\nTHR 392 / AAS 347 / AMS 350 / GSS 392\n\nFrom Cross Colours to boom boxes, the 1990s was loud and colorful. But alongside the fun, black people in the U.S. dealt with heightened criminalization and poverty codified through the War on Drugs, welfare reform, HIV/AIDS, and police brutality. We will study the various cultural productions of black performers and consumers as they navigated the social and political landscapes of the 1990s. We will examine works growing out of music, televisual media, fashion, and public policy, using theories from performance and cultural studies to understand the specificities of blackness, gender, class, and sexuality.\n\nInstructors: Rhaisa Williams\n\nUrban Studies Research Seminar\n\nURB 300 / ARC 300 / HUM 300 / AMS 300\n\nThis seminar introduces urban studies research methods through a study of New York in conversation with other cities. Focused on communities and landmarks represented in historical accounts, literary works, art and film, we will travel through cityscapes as cultural and mythological spaces - from the past to the present day. We will examine how standards of evidence shape what is knowable about cities and urban life, what \"counts\" as knowledge in urban studies, and how these different disciplinary perspectives construct and limit knowledge about cities as a result.\n\nInstructors: Aaron P. Shkuda\n\nRace, Gender, and the Urban Environment\n\nAMS 312 / GSS 462 / URB 316 / ENV 314\n\nThis course considers how environmental racism shapes urban inequality. We will discuss how racial and gender bias have conditioned proposals for the future of cities and the planet. We will also address how people who have experienced racial and gender marginalization have formed relationships with land, water, and non-human life in response to crisis. We will address environmentalist work in geography, critical race studies, city planning, queer and trans theory, and disability studies along with novels, journalism, and film to analyze how ideas of race and gender and questions of urban and planetary futures have informed one another.\n\nInstructors: Davy Knittle\n\nBlack and Indigenous Feminist Survival and Experimentation in the Americas\n\nAMS 351 / GSS 443 / AAS 352\n\nThis course is designed to explore how centering Black and Native/Indigenous feminist epistemologies (ways of knowing), theories, methods, themes, cultural production, and decolonial and abolitionist struggle reorient the field of American Studies. If we orient American Studies around and through Black and Native/Indigenous gendered, sexualized, feminist and queer modes of survival and ingenuity; what themes, debates, and questions rise to the surface and become salient?\n\nInstructors: Tiffany J. King\n\nCreative Ecologies: American Environmental Narrative and Art, 1980-2020\n\nAMS 354 / ART 355 / ENV 373\n\nThis seminar explores how writers and artists--alongside scientists and activists--have shaped American environmental thought from 1980 to today. The seminar asks: How do different media convey the causes and potential solutions to environmental challenges, ranging from biodiversity loss and food insecurity to pollution and climate change? What new art forms are needed to envision sustainable and just futures? Course materials include popular science writing, graphic narrative, speculative fiction, animation art, documentary film, and data visualization along with research from anthropology, ecology, history, literary studies, and philosophy.\n\nInstructors: Allison Carruth\n\nIsn't It Romantic? The Broadway Musical from Rodgers and Hammerstein to Sondheim\n\nAMS 365 / ENG 365 / GSS 365 / MTD 365\n\nSong. Dance. Man. Woman. These are the basic components of the Broadway musical theatre. How have musical theatre artists, composers, lyricists, librettists, directors, choreographers, and designers worked with these building blocks to create this quintessentially American form of art and entertainment? This course will explore conventional and resistant performances of gender and sexuality in the Broadway musical since the 1940s. Why are musicals structured by love and romance?\n\nInstructors: Stacy E. Wolf\n\nAdvanced Seminar in American Studies: Elites in Democratic America\n\nAMS 403 / SOC 403\n\nThe aim of this course is to provide you with the tools to think about elites within democratic societies. The course is divided into four modular units: (1) The Decline of Aristocracy, (2) Creating an American Elite, (3) Elites and Power, and (4) A New Elite. For each of these units we will spend one week reading a theoretical approach to understanding the theme, one week on an empirical case to put this theory in context, and one week reading a novel that works with the themes of the theory and research we have read.\n\nInstructors: Shamus R. Khan\n\nAmerican Agrarians: Ideas of Land, Labor, and Food\n\nAMS 419 / ENV 419\n\nFor agrarians, farms and fields are prized over boardrooms and shopping malls. Agrarianism values hard work, self-sufficiency, simplicity and connection with nature. For some today, it is a compelling antidote to globalization and consumerism. This course examines American agrarianism past and present and its central role in our national imaginary, tracing the complex and contradictory contours of a social and political philosophy that seeks freedom and yet gave way to enslaving, excluding, and ignoring many based on race, immigration status, and gender. A focus will be on new agrarianism and movements for food, land, and social justice.\n\nInstructors: Tessa L. Desmond\n\nLaw and Public Policy in African American History\n\nAAS 380 / AMS 382\n\nThis course explores how ideas and discourses about race shape how public policy is debated, adopted, and implemented. Black social movements and geopolitical considerations prompted multiple public policy responses to racial discrimination throughout the twentieth century. Despite these policy responses, discrimination persists, raising theoretical concerns about the dynamics of inclusion and exclusion, political representation, the role of the state (meaning government or law) in promoting social justice, and the role of social movements and civil society in democratizing policymaking and addressing group oppression.\n\nInstructors: Naomi Murakawa\n\nPluriversal Arctic\n\nANT 322 / ENV 342 / HUM 323 / AMS 422\n\nStudents will be introduced to anthropological and cross-disciplinary studies of multiple, divergent ways in which the Circumpolar populations experience, perceive and respond to environmental, political and socio-economic changes from within distinct horizons of knowledge & modes of sociality. By focusing on social and historical processes as well as current/emerging practices, worlds/cosmologies, the course will analytically evaluate such notions as Anthropocene, the Fourth World, indigeneity and decolonisation as well as examine attempts of various scholars to better understand complex interconnections of climate, environment and society.\n\nInstructors: Olga Ulturgasheva\n\nAre You For Sale? Performance Making, Philanthropy and Ethics\n\nDAN 357 / AMS 358 / THR 357 / VIS 357\n\nIn this class we study the relationships between performance-making, philanthropy and ethics. How are performing artists financing their work, and what does this mean in relationship to economic and social justice? How did we arrive to the current conditions of arts funding? What is the connection between wealth and giving and when are those ties inherently questionable? What is at stake in the debate of public versus private support? Does funding follow artists' concerns or delimit them?\n\nInstructors: Miguel Gutierrez\n\nTopics in 18th-Century Literature: The Red Atlantic and the Enlightenment\n\nENG 338 / HIS 318 / AMS 348\n\nAnishinaabe writer Gerald Vizenor notes the word \"indian\" is a \"colonial enactment\" that \"has no referent in tribal languages or cultures.\" But as a trope it has long provided Western culture with a vision of romantic primitivism, of savage cruelty, or of the doomed victims of colonial expansion. This course will examine eighteenth-century transatlantic representations of North American Indigenous people and consider the cultural functions of these representations and their role in settler colonialism. In addition to literary texts, we will also examine art and visual culture, collected objects, and philosophical writing from the period.\n\nInstructors: Robbie Richardson\n\nGlobal Novel\n\nENG 444 / ASA 444 / AMS 443\n\nWhat happens to narrative when writers aspire to write the world? How has globalization transformed not only the way novels are produced but also the internal form of the works themselves? We'll read novels that overtly strive for a fuller picture of some social or conceptual whole (e.g., migration, climate change, labor, the Internet), especially where they thematize the impossibility of such a project. Students will learn interdisciplinary methods for reading literature's relation to society by examining how writers play with scale, link parts to wholes, and provincialize worlds while rendering the seemingly provincial or mundane worldly.\n\nInstructors: Paul Nadal\n\nEmpire of the Ark: The Animal Question in Film, Photography and Popular Culture\n\nENV 357 / AMS 457 / GSS 357 / ENG 315\n\nThis course explores the fascination with animals in film, photography and popular culture, engaging critical issues in animal and environmental studies. In the context of global crises of climate change and mass displacement, course themes include the invention of wilderness, national parks, zoos and the prison system; the cult of the pet; vampires, werewolves and liminal creatures; animal communication, emotions and rights; queering nature; race and strategies for environmental justice. How can rethinking animals help us rethink what it means to be human? How can we transform our relations with other species and the planet itself?\n\nInstructors: Anne McClintock\n\nThe Sixties: Documentary, Youth and the City\n\nHIS 202 / URB 203 / AMS 202 / AAS 203\n\nThis seminar in history and documentary film explores personal narrative and how individual experience contributes to profound social change. We study 1960s youth through oral history, biography, memoir, ethnography and journalism. Trenton NJ is the case study. Themes include: civil rights & Black power; immigration & migration; student uprisings & policing; gender & sexuality; high school & college; churches & city institutions; sports & youth culture; labor, class & neighborhood; politics & government. Working with documentary narrative, the course asks how a new generation of storytellers will shape public conversations and policy.\n\nInstructors: Purcell Carson, Alison E. Isenberg\n\nU.S. Legal History\n\nHIS 379 / SPI 362 / AMS 420\n\nThis class views legal history broadly as the relationship between formal law, popular legal culture, state governance, and social change in the U.S., from the colonial period to the present. We will examine changing conceptions of rights, equality, justice, the public interest. We also will consider questions about the operation of law in U.S. history: How is law made? What do people expect from law? Who controls law? How did that change over time? These questions open up a rich, layered past in which the law was a source of authority that mediated social and political conflicts, even as those conflicts ultimately changed the law.\n\nInstructors: Laura F. Edwards\n\nArchiving the American West\n\nHIS 431 / AMS 432\n\nWorking with Princeton's Western Americana collections, students will explore what archives are and how they are made. Who controls what's in them? How do they shape what historians write? Using little studied collections, students will produce online \"exhibitions\" for the Library website, and research potential acquisitions for the Library collections. Significant time will be devoted to in-class workshops focused on manuscript and visual materials. Special visitors will include curators, archivists, librarians, and dealers.\n\nInstructors: Martha A. Sandweiss\n\nThe History of Incarceration in the U.S.\n\nHIS 459 / GSS 459 / AMS 459\n\nThe prison is a growth industry in the U.S.; it is also a central institution in U.S. political and social life, shaping our experience of race, class, gender, sexuality, citizenship, and political possibility. This course explores the history of incarceration over the course of more than two centuries. It tracks the emergence of the penitentiary in the early national period and investigates mass incarceration of the late 20th century. Topics include the relationship between the penitentiary and slavery; the prisoners' rights movement; Japanese internment; immigration detention; and the privatization and globalization of prisons.\n\nInstructors: Wendy Warren\n\nLatino Urban History\n\nHIS 465 / LAO 465 / AMS 465\n\nUsing cities like Los Angeles, Chicago, New York, and Miami as case studies, this course seeks to understand the history of Latinos in urban places. Casting a geographically broad net and focusing largely on the 20th century, this course will comparatively analyze Latinos of different national origins (e.g. Mexican Americans, Cuban Americans, Puerto Ricans, Dominican Americans). In addition, the course will look at a broad cross-section of the Latino community to get at changing understandings of gender, class, race, and immigration status. This course will include readings from traditional historical monographs and autobiographies.\n\nInstructors: Rosina A. Lozano\n\nAbraham Lincoln and America, 1809-1865\n\nHIS 470 / HUM 471 / AMS 471\n\nThis course surveys aspects of mid-19th century American culture through the life of Abraham Lincoln. This includes the imaging, ideologies, concepts, visions of behavior, institutions -- and the means for disseminating these -- which abounded in American life between 1848 and 1877, and which intersected at various points with the life of Abraham Lincoln. It pays attention to the emergence of markets for the arts and the restraints which those markets and 19th-century technology placed on them. The purpose is to have you at 'the cutting edge' of Civil War-era and Lincolnian cultural history scholarship.\n\nInstructors: Allen Carl Guelzo\n\nExcavate/Illuminate: Creating Theater from the Raw Material of History\n\nHUM 321 / THR 362 / AMS 331 / AAS 324\n\nExcavate/Illuminate will guide students' archival research and collaborative exploration of US history, journalism, and performance, focusing on the pivotal Tulsa Race Massacre (1921) as a case study. We will read several examples of documentary theater to see how artists create theater from the raw materials of history. For the first half of the semester, students will work in small groups, exploring online resources in order to develop and perform original scripts in the style of Federal Theatre Project Living Newspapers. During weeks 7-12, students will select collaborators and historical topics of interest to devise final performances.\n\nInstructors: Arminda F. Thomas, Catherine M. Young\n\nRace Across the Americas\n\nLAS 313 / ANT 313 / LAO 313 / AMS 305\n\nThis course explores transnational and diasporic formations of race in the Americas. Drawing on Ethnic Studies, Latin American Studies, and anthropological and historical approaches, we explore racial formations in Latin America and its transnational communities. A central goal for this course is to understand race and racial formations as culturally contextualized and situated within the politics of difference. How are U.S. racial-ethnic categories embraced, contested, or reconfigured across the Americas, and vice versa? Topics include multiculturalism, mestizaje, border thinking, transnationalism, and racial democracy among others.\n\nInstructors: Alberto E. Morales\n\nAmerican Deaf Culture\n\nLIN 215 / AMS 214 / GHP 315\n\nThis course explores the history, culture, and language of the Deaf in the United States. The first part of the course focuses on the history of Deaf people in the United States. The second part discusses various aspects of Deaf culture: language, literature, art, politics, etc. The third part critically examines different issues facing Deaf people here in the United States and around the world. These issues include audism, linguicism, ableism, intersectionality, disability rights, bioethics, and education. No American Sign Language knowledge required.\n\nInstructors: Noah A. Buchholz\n\n'Cult' Controversies in America\n\nREL 271 / AMS 341\n\nIn this course we examine a variety of new religious movements that tested the boundaries of acceptable religion at various moments in American history. We pay particular attention to government and media constructions of the religious mainstream and margin, to the politics of labels such as \"cult\" and \"sect,\" to race, gender, and sexuality within new religions, and to the role of American law in constructing categories and shaping religious expressions. We also consider what draws people to new religions and examine the distinctive beliefs, practices, and social organizations of groups labeled by outsiders as \"cults.\"\n\nInstructors: Judith Weisenfeld\n\nMuslim America\n\nREL 393 / CHV 393 / AMS 391\n\nThe course begins with the intertwined history of Muslims in America and America itself. We will then apply that foundation to topics in contemporary Muslim American life - for example, authority in mosques, fashion and coolness, and representation in movies. Students will encounter primary as well as secondary sources. For example, students will read an 1831 autobiography of an enslaved Muslim named Omar ibn Said and analyze a Chicago-based Ahmadi newspaper from the 1920s. We will use a range of media, including film and material culture, to emphasize the varieties of Muslim experience in America.\n\nInstructors: Rebecca L. Faulkner\n\nReimagining the American Theatrical Canon\n\nTHR 223 / AMS 346 / ENG 253 / GSS 444\n\nThis course offers an intensive survey of ongoing efforts to revisit and revise the American theatrical canon and repertoire. Students will examine the economic, institutional and cultural forces shaping the landscape of new play production in the United States as they also read a broad selection of plays from the contemporary American theater. Working in partnership with McCarter Theatre's \"Bard at the Gate\" initiative, students will develop dramaturgical and other resources in response to this uniquely curated virtual platform for noteworthy but overlooked plays by BIPOC, female, LGBTQIA+, and disabled artists.\n\nInstructors: Brian E. Herrera\n\nStorytellers - Building Community Through Art\n\nTHR 313 / AAS 312 / AMS 387 / GSS 453\n\nIn this Princeton Challenge course, students will participate in building a relationship between a historically significant Black theater company, Crossroads Theater in New Brunswick, and the university community. Co-taught by Sydne Mahone, Director of play development at Crossroads 1985-1997, students will research the theater through its people and its art, while making the role of women in Black art-making more visible. Students will consider their own role in movements for change, and the role of storytelling as a call to action. Our work will culminate in creative responses and roadmaps for continuing community relationship.\n\nInstructors: Jane F. Cox, Sydne J. Mahone\n\nDecentering/Recentering the Western Canon in the Contemporary American Theater\n\nTHR 416 / AMS 416 / COM 453 / ENG 456\n\nWhy do some BIPOC dramatists (from the US and Canada) choose to adapt/revise/re-envision canonical texts from the Western theatrical tradition? While their choices might be accused of recentering and reinforcing \"white\" narratives that marginalize and/or exoticize racial and ethnic others, we might also see this venture as a useful strategy to write oneself into a tradition that is itself constantly being revised and reevaluated and to claim that tradition as one's own. What are the artistic, cultural, and economic \"rewards\" for deploying this method of playmaking? What are the risks?\n\nInstructors: Michael W. Cadden\n\nAMS 101\n\nAmerica Then and Now\n\nThis course introduces students to the subjects of American studies through discussion of some of the signature ideas, events, and debates in America’s past and present in order to understand America as it exists today. It examines both historical and mythic manifestations of America from local, national, and global perspectives and considers the historical and cognitive processes associated with the delineation of America. The course examines a wide range of material and media from the point of view of multiple fields of study, and it engages the voices of diverse individuals and cultures in telling the story of America then and now.\n\nInstructors: Anne Cheng, Rachael Ziady DeLue, Yaacob Dweck\n\nAMS 322 / ENG 242\n\nNative American Literature\n\nAn analysis of the written and oral literary traditions developed by Native Americans. American Indian and First Nation authors will be read in the context of the global phenomenon of indigeneity and settler colonialism, and in dialogue with each other. Through readings, discussions, and guest speakers, we will consider linguistic, historical, and cultural approaches. This course offers an occasion to reflect on, critique, and contest settler colonialism, or the dispossession of land and waters and the attempt to eliminate Indigenous people.\n\nInstructors: Sarah Rivett\n\nAMS 399 / HIS 399\n\nIn the Groove: Technology and Music in American History, From Edison to the iPod\n\nWhen Thomas Edison invented the phonograph in 1877, no one, including Edison, knew what to do with the device. Over the next century Americans would engage in an ongoing dialogue with this talking machine, defining and redefining its purpose. This course will track that trajectory, from business tool to scientific instrument to music recorder to musical instrument. By listening to the history of the phonograph, and by examining the desires and experiences of phonograph users, students will perceive more generally the complex relationships that exist between a technology and the people who produce, consume, and transform it.\n\nInstructors: Emily Thompson\n\nAMS 403\n\nAdvanced Seminar in American Studies: Art and Politics of Food\n\nThis course brings methods and ideas from two fields — American studies and the environmental humanities — to examine the role of the arts in U.S. food movements related to agriculture, culinary experimentation and environmental justice. Course materials will include film, visual and performance art, journalism, political ephemera and culinary artifacts. Course participants will develop both an independent research-based essay and a multimedia collaborative project that build on the seminar’s guiding questions and assigned materials.\n\nInstructors: Allison Carruth\n\nAMS 406\n\nAdvanced Seminar in American Studies: The Disney Industrial Complex\n\nThis interdisciplinary seminar will examine the history and evolution of the Walt Disney Company not only as a multinational media and entertainment conglomerate but also as a powerful cultural force — from the early films and theme parks to the highly successful streaming service. We’ll consider the ever-expanding Disney multiverse (which now includes Pixar, Marvel, and Lucasfilm, among others) as well as the company’s global reach, while paying special attention to its impacts on, and representations of, American history, society, and culture, particularly as they touch on matters of gender, race, ethnicity, sexuality, disability, and place.\n\nInstructors: William Albert Gleason\n\nANT 328 / AAS 396 / AMS 314 / ART 327\n\nReckoning: Complicated Histories and Collective Identities\n\nHow do we grapple with complicated, violent, and disavowed aspects of our collective histories in contemporary society? This class takes as its central issue how societies chose (or not) to reckon with, redress, and repair their difficult pasts. This course will challenge students to take on the difficult work of grappling with violent and otherwise negative pasts through the cultural media of memorial, monument, museum, and collaborative heritage practice. See \"Other Information\" below about a possible break trip to a memorial to the victims of racial terrorism in the U.S. South, located in Montgomery, Alabama.\n\nInstructors: Tiffany Cherelle Fryer\n\nART 384 / AMS 394\n\nSupply-side Aesthetics: American Art in the Age of Reagan\n\nThis course investigates the art and the aesthetics of the age of Reagan and Reaganism with an eye toward the present. How did supply-side economics transform the art world and art itself during the 1980s? How did certain period styles propagate Reaganism? Drawing on artworks from the Princeton University Art Museum, art criticism, cultural criticism, political journalism, and an emerging history, we study critically sanctioned as well as controversial artistic movements of the period, including Neo-Expressionism, Graffiti Art, and Commodity Art, asking what this art can teach us about the age, in which an entertainer-turned-politician was elected president.\n\nInstructors: AnnMarie Perl\n\nATL 399 / THR 499 / AMS 498\n\nPrinceton Atelier: Women's Work: The Evelyn Brown Project\n\nThis course will use the reconstruction of Evelyn Brown, a movement piece by María Irene Fornés, to interrogate questions of female labor and its portrayal on stage. Fornés, arguably the most important Latina dramatist of the 20th century, sourced Evelyn Brown from the diary of an early 20th century New England domestic servant. The class will explore the relation of Evelyn Brown to Fornés larger body of work and lead to deeper questions about staging mundane labor as performance during our time when labor inequality has grown exponentially. Our final project will be a first step to re-staging this little-known work in a professional venue.\n\nInstructors: Gwendolyn A. Alker, Alice Reagan\n\nCOM 373 / AAS 383 / AMS 388\n\nCinema in Times of Pandemic: Research Film Studio\n\nThis course is dedicated to the study of critical film curation. The pandemic disrupted traditional film production, distribution and canonization. Could this disruption be turned into a creative subversion of the strong industrial and commercial aspect of American filmmaking and the Jim Crow system of Hollywood? In cooperation with the Sundance and the Berlin Film Festivals, we will practice critical curation of films made by women and Afro-American directors and interview filmmakers, film festival directors and leaders of the film industry. Work-products of the class (interviews, reviews, synopses) can be published on our course website.\n\nInstructors: Erika Anita Kiss\n\nDAN 305 / AAS 307 / AMS 310\n\nBlack Dance: History, Theory, Practice\n\nHow do we analyze conspiracy narratives and conspiratorial thinking at a moment when the government spies on its citizens and profitable technology companies have turned surveillance itself into an economic necessity? Under what historical, political, and economic conditions do conspiracies proliferate? In this course we analyze conspiracies, paranoia, rumors, and the contemporary economies of dis/information and post-facts. Course material will be drawn from American history, from the 19th century to the present, and will include manifestos, films, novels, online fora, and theoretical texts in psychoanalysis, narrative theory and politics.\n\nInstructors: Jasmine E. Johnson\n\nENG 261 / AMS 357\n\nConspiracy in America\n\nHow do we analyze conspiracy narratives and conspiratorial thinking at a moment when the government spies on its citizens and profitable technology companies have turned surveillance itself into an economic necessity? Under what historical, political, and economic conditions do conspiracies proliferate? In this course we analyze conspiracies, paranoia, rumors, and the contemporary economies of dis/information and post-facts. Course material will be drawn from American history, from the 19th century to the present, and will include manifestos, films, novels, online fora, and theoretical texts in psychoanalysis, narrative theory and politics.\n\nInstructors: Zahid Rafiq Chaudhary\n\nENV 357 / AMS 457 / GSS 357 / ENG 315\n\nEmpire of the Ark: The Animal Question in Film, Photography and Popular Culture\n\nThis course explores the fascination with animals in film, photography and popular culture, engaging critical issues in animal and environmental studies. In the context of global crises of climate change and mass displacement, course themes include the invention of wilderness, national parks, zoos and the prison system; the cult of the pet; vampires, werewolves and liminal creatures; animal communication, emotions and rights; queering nature; race and strategies for environmental justice. How can rethinking animals help us rethink what it means to be human? How can we transform our relations with other species and the planet itself?\n\nInstructors: Anne McClintock\n\nGSS 337 / MTD 302 / THR 347 / AMS 336\n\nGender Crossings in American Musical Theater\n\nThis course offers an intensive survey of gender crossings on the American musical theater stage. The course’s study of American musicals (in terms of form, content and context) will be anchored in a historical exploration of world theatrical traditions of cross-gender performance. The course will examine multiple modes of cross-gender performance, while also considering musicals that stage gender role reversals and those that open questions of gender expression and identity.\n\nInstructors: Brian Eugenio Herrera\n\nGSS 373 / AMS 383 / ENG 332\n\nGraphic Memoir\n\nAn exploration of the graphic memoir focusing on the ways specific works combine visual imagery and language to expand the possibilities of autobiographical narrative. Through our analysis of highly acclaimed graphic memoirs from the American, Franco-Belgian, and Japanese traditions, we examine the visual and verbal constructions of identity with an emphasis on the representation of gender dynamics and cultural conflict.\n\nInstructors: Alfred Bendixen\n\nHIS 270 / AMS 370 / ASA 370\n\nAsian American History\n\nThis course introduces students to the multiple and varied experiences of people of Asian heritage in the United States from the 19th century to the present day. It focuses on three major questions: (1) What brought Asians to the United States? (2) How did Asian Americans come to be viewed as a race? (3) How does Asian American experience transform our understanding of U.S. history? Using newspapers, novels, government reports, and films, this course will cover major topics in Asian American history, including Chinese exclusion, Japanese internment, transnational adoption, and the model minority stereotype.\n\nInstructors: Beth Lew-Williams\n\nHIS 375 / AMS 371\n\nU.S. Intellectual History: Development of American Thought\n\nThis course examines the history of the United States through its intellectuals and major ideas. Starting with the American Revolution and progressing through to the contemporary intellectual scene, it hopes to introduce students to major debates, themes, and intellectual movements in the history of American ideas. We will read a number of famous thinkers and actors in their own words: Thomas Jefferson, Henry David Thoreau, Jane Addams, Martin Luther King Jr., and many others. Students will leave this class with a deeper understanding and appreciation for the ideas and the thinkers who have shaped the nation’s politics and culture.\n\nInstructors: Peter Wirzbicki\n\nHIS 388 / URB 388 / AMS 380 / AAS 388\n\nUnrest and Renewal in Urban America\n\nThis course surveys the history of cities in the United States from colonial settlement to the present. Over centuries, cities have symbolized democratic ideals of “melting pots” and cutting-edge innovation, as well as urban crises of disorder, decline, crime, and poverty. Urban life has concentrated extremes like rich and poor; racial and ethnic divides; philanthropy and greed; skyscrapers and parks; violence and hope; downtown and suburb. The course examines how cities in U.S. history have brokered revolution, transformation and renewal, focusing on class, race, gender, immigration, capitalism, and the built environment.\n\nInstructors: Alison Ellen Isenberg\n\nHIS 482 / AMS 482 / ASA 482\n\nArab America: Culture, Activism, and Resistance\n\nThis course explores the history of Arabs and Arab Americans in the United States beginning from the 1850s to the present and analyzes the political, cultural, and economic conditions that have influenced Arab American communities. In doing so, the course covers a wide range of topics including: issues of citizenship, racial discrimination and exclusion; racial formation; labor, activism, and resistance; transnational networks; and cultural productions and representations of Arab Americans. Alongside academic publications, we will be reading a variety of sources including legal documents, newsletters, court rulings, poetry, and films.\n\nInstructors: Neama Alamri\n\nHIS 484 / LAS 484 / LAO 484 / AMS 484\n\nBorderlands, Border Lives\n\nThe international border looms large over current national and international political debates. While this course will consider borders across the world, it will focus on the U.S.-Mexico border, and then on the Guatemala-Mexico and U.S.-Canada border. This course examines the history of the formation of the U.S. border from the colonial period to the present. Borders represent much more than just political boundaries between nation states. The borderlands represents the people who live between two cultures and two nations. This course will also study those individuals who have lived in areas surrounding borders or crossed them.\n\nInstructors: Rosina Amelia Lozano\n\nTHR 308 / AMS 307 / COM 385 / ENG 260\n\nMetatheater, Then and Now\n\nIn 1963, Lionel Abel invented the term \"metatheater\" to discuss self-referential, anti-illusionist devices — introduced, as he thought, by some Renaissance playwrights — which had become ubiquitous in the theater of his day. \"Very meta!\" was soon used to describe almost every play ever written. But some plays are more \"meta\" than others and the methods and motives of their authors vary considerably. This seminar will spend six weeks focused on Greek, Renaissance, and Modern examples of the genre before turning to contemporary American playwrights who have found new and often jaw-dropping uses for metatheatrics.\n\nInstructors: Michael William Cadden\n\nURB 300 / ARC 300 / HUM 300 / AMS 300\n\nUrban Studies Research Seminar\n\nThis seminar introduces urban studies research methods through a study of New York in conversation with other cities. Focused on communities and landmarks represented in historical accounts, literary works, art and film, we will travel through cityscapes as cultural and mythological spaces — from the past to the present day. We will examine how standards of evidence shape what is knowable about cities and urban life, what “counts” as knowledge in urban studies, and how these different disciplinary perspectives construct and limit knowledge about cities as a result.\n\nInstructors: Aaron P. Shkud\n\nAMS 240\n\nIntroduction to American Popular Culture\n\nThis course engages critically with the artifacts and archives of contemporary American culture, inviting students to view, read, and create these artifacts with an eye toward what they tell us about how the United States represents itself and its citizens through various genres including theatre, musicals, film, TV, music, graphic and written novels, games, and the internet. Who are the heroes and villains in contemporary U.S. pop culture? How are family, work, and romance represented across races, genders and sexualities? How are economics and social class portrayed? Do the narratives we consume still promise an American Dream?\n\nInstructors: Jill Dolan\n\nAMS 334 / ENG 234\n\nAmerican Genres: Western, Screwball Comedy, Film Noir\n\nWhy did three American genres become classics in the same twenty-year period, 1936-56? Part of the answer lies in global disruptions that unsettled codes of behavior. Part lies in film innovations that altered cinema itself. But more than this intersection of social and formal transformations, the decisive answer lies in a handful of directors who reconfigured gendered relations in three generic forms. The surprising correspondences that emerge among these classic films, if also the obvious divergences even within single genres, will focus our discussion.\n\nInstructors: Lee Clark Mitchell\n\nAMS 351 / GSS 427 / AAS 345 / REL 393\n\nIslam in/and America: Race, Religion, and Gender in the United States\n\nWhat is American Islam and who are U.S. Muslims? This seminar employs lectures, discussions, and a diverse array of texts, including novels, scholarly works, films, arts, music, and much more, to respond to this question, revealing how a focus on Islam and Muslims in the United States produces critical counter-narratives of race, religion, and gender in the United States from the colonial era to the present.\n\nInstructors: Sylvia Chan-Malik\n\nAMS 403 / POL 478\n\nAdvanced Seminar in American Studies: Fixing a Bug in Democracy: The Math and Practice of Fair Redistricting\n\nDemocracy in the United States is looking a bit rickety. Decades of progress in voting rights are countered by recent efforts to weaken the connection between popular opinion and representational outcomes. This course will address redistricting, the process of redrawing legislative and congressional lines, which every state will do in 2021. Redistricting can remedy a distorted Census count — or make its effects tenfold worse. We will address how lines can be drawn to enhance fairness and the representation of diverse communities. As case studies we may redistrict Texas, North Carolina, Michigan, Virginia and Pennsylvania.\n\nInstructors: Samuel Sheng-Hung Wang\n\nAMS 404 / ENG 434\n\nAdvanced Seminar in American Studies: Multiethnic American Short Stories: Tales We Tell Ourselves\n\nShort stories have been used by writers to make concise, insightful comments about American national identity and individuality. Taken up by African-Americans, Asian Americans, Native Americans, Latinos, and many others, the genre has been used to convey experiences with immigration and assimilation, discrimination and oppression, generational divides, and interactions across difference. Examination of such stories deepens our understanding of America’s multiethnic landscape. In this seminar, we will explore stories written by a diverse group of writers to consider the ties that both link and divide multiethnic America.\n\nInstructors: Tessa Lowinske Desmond\n\nAMS 406\n\nAdvanced Seminar in American Studies: The Disney Industrial Complex\n\nThis interdisciplinary seminar will examine the history and evolution of the Walt Disney Company not only as a multinational media and entertainment conglomerate but also as a powerful cultural force — from the early films and theme parks to the recently launched streaming service. We’ll consider the ever-expanding Disney multiverse (which now includes Pixar, Marvel, and Lucasfilm, among others) as well as the company’s global reach, while paying special attention to its impacts on, and representations of, American history, society, and culture, particularly as they touch on matters of gender, race, ethnicity, sexuality, disability, and place.\n\nInstructors: William Albert Gleason\n\nAAS 322 / LAS 301 / LAO 322 / AMS 323\n\nAfro-Diasporic Dialogues: Black Activism in Latin America and the United States\n\nThis course investigates how people of African descent in the Americas have forged social, political, and cultural ties across geopolitical and linguistic boundaries. We will interrogate the transnational dialogue between African Americans and Afro-Latin Americans using case studies from Brazil, Cuba, Haiti, and Puerto Rico. We will explore how Black activists and artists from the United States have partnered with people of color in Latin America and the Caribbean to challenge racism and economic inequality, while also considering why efforts to mobilize Afro-descendants across the Americas have often been undermined by mutual misunderstandings.\n\nInstructors: Reena N. Goldthree\n\nAAS 372 / ART 374 / AMS 372\n\nPostblack - Contemporary African American Art\n\nAs articulated by Thelma Golden, postBlack refers to the work of African American artists who emerged in the 1990s with ambitious, irreverent, and sassy work. PostBlack suggests the emergence of a generation of artists removed from the long tradition of Black affirmation of the Harlem Renaissance, Black empowerment of the Black Arts movement, and identity politics of the 1980s and early 90s. This seminar involves critical and theoretical readings on multiculturalism, race, identity, and contemporary art, and will provide an opportunity for a deep engagement with the work of African American artists of the past decade.\n\nInstructors: Chika O. Okeke-Agulu\n\nANT 223 / AMS 223 / AAS 224 / URB 224\n\nPolicing and Militarization Today\n\nThis class aims to explore transnational issues in policing. Drawing heavily upon anthropological methods and theory, we aim neither to vindicate nor contest the police’s right to use force (whether a particular instance was a violation of law), but instead, to contribute to the understanding of force (its forms, justifications, interpretations). The innovative transnational approach to policing developed during the semester will allow for a cross-cultural comparative analysis that explores larger rubrics of policing in a comprehensive social scientific framework. We hope that you are ready to explore these exciting and urgent issues with us.\n\nInstructors: Aisha M. Beliso-De Jesús, Laurence Ralph\n\nANT 246 / AMS 246 / LAS 246\n\nNative American and Indigenous Studies: An Introduction\n\nThis course will introduce students to the comparative study of the Indigenous peoples of the Americas. We will take a broad hemispheric approach instead of focusing solely on the experiences of any particular native community, allowing students to both acquaint themselves with the diversity of Indigenous communities and better understand the multitude of Indigenous experiences — or, what it means to be Indigenous — across regional contexts. How do processes of imperial expansionism and settler colonialisms shape the conditions within which Indigenous Americans now live? How do native peoples relate to settler colonial governing bodies today?\n\nInstructors: Tiffany Cherelle (Cain) Fryer\n\nCOM 373 / AAS 383 / AMS 388\n\nCinema in Times of Pandemic: Research Film Studio\n\nIn cooperation with the Sundance and the Berlin Film Festivals, our workshop will investigate the crisis of film production, distribution and canonization made acute by the pandemic as well as divisive culture wars. We will uncover how the formation of film canons is informed by the ebb and flow of the civil rights movement. Our focus will be on stories of injustice filmed by women and Afro-American artists. The seminar work will consist of making short digital presentations and scholarly film-montage essays. The class will record Zoom interviews with critically acclaimed filmmakers, film festival directors and leaders of the film industry.\n\nInstructors: Erika Anita Kiss\n\nDAN 314 / AMS 335 / ANT 356 / THR 314\n\nPerformance in Extraordinary Times: Documenting and Analyzing the Present\n\nPerformance and crisis have always been partners: entangled in epidemics, state violence and resistance, and austerity regimes, as well as the crisis ordinariness of settler colonialism and structural racism. This seminar examines performance in our extraordinary present using autoethnography, ethnography, and interviews. Course readings and viewings offer historical and contemporary case studies. Guests will discuss the paired challenges of antiracism and the COVID-19 pandemic for performance organizations. Students will collaborate on analyses of dance and performance organizations’ responses to COVID-19 and anti-racist imperatives.\n\nInstructors: Judith Hamera\n\nDAN 329 / AMS 329 / GSS 433\n\nMoving Writing: Memoir and the Work of Dance\n\nWhat can memoirs teach us about navigating the demands of a life in dance, and about the ways these demands are profoundly intersectional: shaped by racial, gender, and class hierarchies and economies? This seminar examines memoir as an activist project and mode of performance illuminating the work of dance. Readings include works by Carlos Acosta, Misty Copeland, Li Cunxin, Mark Morris, Jock Soto, and others. Theories of personal narrative theory and autobiography guide our discussions. Students will conduct oral history interviews and investigate personal papers in local archives as forms of memoir. Emphasis on dancers in the Americas.\n\nInstructors: Judith Hamera\n\nENG 216 / AMS 216 / GSS 214\n\nWounded Beauty\n\nThis course studies the entanglement between ideas of personhood and the history of ideas about beauty. How does beauty make and unmake persons -socially, legally and culturally- at the intersection of race, gender and aesthetics? Let us move beyond the good versus bad binary that dominates discussions of beauty to focus instead on how beauty in literature and culture have contributed to the conceptualization of modern, western personhood and its inverse (the inhuman, the inanimate, the object). We will trace beauty and its disruptions in the arenas of literature, visual culture, global capitalism, politics, law, science and technology.\n\nInstructors: Anne Cheng\n\nENG 318 / LAO 318 / LAS 306 / AMS 318\n\nTopics in Latinx Literature and Culture: Latinx Literary Worlds\n\nThis course will look to the many narratives and histories that comprise the multiple worlds of Latinx literatures. How does the term Latinx respond to questions of gender and language? What does the history of naming this pan-ethnic group tell us about U.S. racial-ethnic categories? How do borders become an occasion to rethink space and psyche, as well as entangled crisis? Taking a hemispheric approach, this course will examine how Latinx texts lend imagination and poetic vision to the experience of migration, the movements of diaspora, and the lasting effects of colonization.\n\nInstructors: Christina León\n\nENG 338 / HIS 318 / AMS 348\n\nTopics in 18th-Century Literature: North American ‘Indians’ in Transatlantic Contexts\n\nAnishinaabe writer Gerald Vizenor notes the word “indian” is a “colonial enactment” that “has no referent in tribal languages or cultures.” But as a trope it has long provided Western culture with a vision of romantic primitivism, of savage cruelty, or of the doomed victims of colonial expansion. This course will examine 18th-century transatlantic representations of North American Indigenous people and consider the cultural functions of these representations and their role in settler colonialism. In addition to literary texts, we will also examine art and visual culture, collected objects, and philosophical writing from the period.\n\nInstructors: Robbie John Richardson\n\nENG 358 / LAS 385 / AMS 396\n\nReading Islands: Caribbean Waters, the Archipelago, and its Narratives\n\nThe Caribbean is an archipelago made up of islands that both link and separate the Americas — islands that have weathered various waves of colonization, migration, and revolution. How do narratives of the Caribbean represent the collision of political forces and natural environments? Looking to the many abyssal histories of the Caribbean, we will explore questions of indigeneity, colonial contact, iterations of enslavement, and the plantation matrix in literary texts. How do island-writers evoke gender and a poetics of relation that exceeds tourist desire and forceful extraction?\n\nInstructors: Christina León\n\nENG 361 / AMS 357\n\nConspiracy in American Literature and Culture\n\nHow do we analyze conspiracy narratives and conspiratorial thinking at a moment when the government spies on its citizens and profitable technology companies have turned surveillance itself into an economic necessity? Under what historical, political, and economic conditions do conspiracies proliferate? In this course we analyze conspiracies, paranoia, rumors, and the contemporary economies of dis/information and post-facts. Course material will be drawn from American history, from the 19th century to the present, and will include manifestos, films, novels, online fora, and theoretical texts in psychoanalysis, narrative theory and politics.\n\nInstructors: Zahid Rafiq Chaudhary\n\nENV 357 / AMS 457 / GSS 357 / ENG 315\n\nEmpire of the Ark: The Animal Question in Film, Photography and Popular Culture\n\nThis course explores the fascination with animals in film, photography and popular culture, engaging critical issues in animal and environmental studies. In the context of global crises of climate change and mass displacement, course themes include the invention of wilderness, national parks, zoos and the prison system; the cult of the pet; vampires, werewolves and liminal creatures; animal communication, emotions and rights; queering nature; race and strategies for environmental justice. How can rethinking animals help us rethink what it means to be human? How can we transform our relations with other species and the planet itself?\n\nInstructors: Anne McClintock\n\nGSS 345 / AAS 355 / AMS 373\n\nPleasure, Power and Profit: Race and Sexualities in a Global Era\n\nPleasure Power and Profit explores the intimate ways that sexualities and race are entwined in contemporary culture, historically, and in our own lives. Why are questions about sexuality and race some of the most controversial, compelling, yet often taboo issues of our time? Exploring films, popular culture, novels, social media, and theory, we engage themes like: race, gender and empire; fetishism, Barbie, vampires and zombies; sex work and pornography; marriage and monogamy; queer sexualities; and strategies for social empowerment such as: Black Lives Matter, the new campus feminism, and global movements against sexual and gender violence.\n\nInstructors: Anne McClintock\n\nHIS 270 / AMS 370 / ASA 370\n\nAsian American History\n\nThis course introduces students to the multiple and varied experiences of people of Asian heritage in the United States from the 19th century to the present day. It focuses on three major questions: (1) What brought Asians to the United States? (2) How did Asian Americans come to be viewed as a race? (3) How does Asian American experience transform our understanding of U.S. history? Using newspapers, novels, government reports, and films, this course will cover major topics in Asian American history, including Chinese exclusion, Japanese internment, transnational adoption, and the model minority stereotype.\n\nInstructors: Beth Lew-Williams\n\nHIS 415 / AMS 415\n\nRace, Labor, and Empire\n\nThis course explores histories of race, labor, and empire in the United States from late 19th century to the present from a transnational perspective. In doing so, we will examine the history of race as a product of modernity and colonization. By the end of this course, students will have a keen understanding of how racial constructions (in intersection with gender, sexuality, and class) are deeply intertwined with histories of empire, labor, and immigration. Yet, we will also discuss how groups have resisted, survived, and thrived. We will engage a wide range of sources including legal documents, court rulings, newspapers, and literature.\n\nInstructors: Neama Alamri\n\nHIS 431 / AMS 432\n\nArchiving the American West\n\nWorking with Princeton’s Western Americana collections, students will explore what archives are and how they are made. Who controls what’s in them? How do they shape what historians write? Using little studied collections, students will produce online “exhibitions” for the Princeton University Library website, and research potential acquisitions for the library collections. Significant time will be devoted to in-class workshops focused on manuscript and visual materials (all digitized for the class). Special visitors will include curators, archivists, librarians, and dealers.\n\nInstructors: Martha A. Sandweiss\n\nHIS 441 / AMS 441\n\nReconstructing the Union: Law, Democracy, and Race after the American Civil War\n\nThe Reconstruction of the Union, following the American Civil War, remade the United States. This course will examine how Reconstruction set the stage for rest of the 19th century in all its contradictions. One big theme for the course is how the Civil War and Reconstruction shaped American political philosophy, especially how later debates of the Progressive Era over the size of the government and over laissez-faire capitalism developed out of Reconstruction. We will examine some of the major constitutional and political changes that occur during the aftermath of the Civil War.\n\nInstructors: Peter Wirzbicki\n\nHIS 459 / GSS 459 / AMS 459\n\nThe History of Incarceration in the U.S.\n\nThe prison is a growth industry in the United States; it is also a central institution in U.S. political and social life, shaping our experience of race, class, gender, sexuality, citizenship, and political possibility. This course explores the history of incarceration over the course of more than two centuries. It tracks the emergence of the penitentiary in the early national period and investigates mass incarceration of the late 20th century. Topics include the relationship between the penitentiary and slavery; the prisoners’ rights movement; Japanese internment; immigration detention; and the privatization and globalization of prisons.\n\nInstructors: Wendy Warren\n\nHIS 474 / AMS 474\n\nViolence in America\n\nThis course considers the history of collective violence in America. We will define “collective violence” broadly to encompass people acting on behalf of the U.S. government (i.e., police, soldiers, militiamen, and immigration officers) and people acting as civilians (i.e., slaveholders, vigilantes, terrorists, and protestors). A series of case studies (drawn primarily from the 19th and 20th centuries) will introduce disparate forms of violence, including vigilantism, slavery, massacre, imperialism, riot, segregation, and terrorism.\n\nInstructors: Beth Lew-Williams\n\nHUM 363 / AMS 364\n\nWriting Lincoln: Biography, Film, Literature\n\nThis seminar explores how the historical image of Abraham Lincoln (1809-65) has been developed in American memory through writing, film and literature. Issues to be examined are the major groups of biographical interpreters (the “personal life,” the “Progressive Lincoln,” the “Liberal Hero”), the portrayals of Lincoln in literature (Whitman, Vidal), and how concepts of Lincoln have been shaped by film (Spielberg’s Lincoln, 2012) and television episodes (The Twilight Zone, Star Trek).\n\nInstructors: Allen Carl Guelzo\n\nLAO 201 / AMS 211 / LAS 201\n\nIntroduction to Latino/a/x Studies\n\nThis is an introductory survey of critical topics, themes, and approaches to the interdisciplinary field of Latin@x Studies. Drawing from anthropology, sociology, history, literature, critical race studies, gender and sexuality studies, this course will analyze the role and position of Latin@x in the United States alongside the policies and practices of the United States in the Caribbean and Latin America. The course will explore questions of citizenship, immigration, imperialism, settler/colonialism, border crossing/borderlands, mass incarceration, policing, globalization, and other emerging formations of latinidad from a transnational perspective.\n\nInstructors: Heidy Sarabia\n\nLAO 218 / ENG 258 / AMS 218\n\nLatinx Autobiography\n\nThis course begins from the disjoint and relation between the narrated autobiography and the lived life. In reading works by authors including Myriam Gurba, Wendy C. Ortiz, Carmen Maria Machado, Richard Rodriguez, and Junot Diaz, we will explore not only how writers experiment with the project of narrating a life that contends with the structures and strictures of racial matrices, gender binaries, and traumatic abuse — but also how writers test the boundaries of what autobiographies more generally are and are for.\n\nInstructors: Monica Huerta\n\nREL 377 / AAS 376 / AMS 378\n\nRace and Religion in America\n\nIn this seminar we examine the tangled and shifting relationship between religion and race in American history. In doing so, we explore a broad landscape of racial construction, identity, and experience and consider such topics as American interpretations of race in the Bible, religion and racial slavery, race and missions, religion, race, and science, popular culture representations of racialized religion, and religiously-grounded resistance to racial hierarchy.\n\nInstructors: Judith Weisenfeld\n\nSOC 330 / AMS 370\n\nThe Orange Bubble\n\nThis seminar uses the lenses of race, class, gender, and sexuality to help students understand undergraduate life at Princeton. We will make sense of how the experiences you have had over the past four years are strongly influenced by historical, cultural, social, and technological forces. The aim is to develop a sociological understanding of the Princeton experience, and use that to reflect more generally on the organization of communities. Topics covered include sports, town-gown relationships, nightlife, academics, sexual assault, eating clubs, admissions, systematic racism, the concepts of merit, inclusion, and equality.\n\nInstructors: Mitchell Duneier, Shamus Rahman Khan\n\nTHR 385 / AMS 385 / GSS 385 / LAO 385\n\nTheater and Society Now\n\nAs an art form, theater operates in the shared space and time of the present moment while also manifesting imagined worlds untethered by the limits of “real” life. In this course, we undertake a critical, creative and historical survey of the ways contemporary theater-making in the United States — as both industry and creative practice — does (and does not) engage the most urgent concerns of contemporary American society.\n\nInstructors: Brian Eugenio Herrera\n\nTHR 416 / AMS 416 / COM 453 / ENG 456\n\nDecentering/Recentering the Western Canon in the Contemporary American Theater\n\nWhy do some BIPOC dramatists (from the United States and Canada) choose to adapt/revise/re-envision/deconstruct/rewrite/appropriate canonical texts from the Western theatrical tradition. While their choices might be accused of recentering and reinforcing “white” narratives that often marginalize and/or exoticize racial and ethnic others, we might also see this risky venture as a useful strategy to write oneself into a tradition that is itself constantly being revised and reevaluated and to claim that tradition as one’s own. What are the artistic, cultural, and economic “rewards” for deploying this method of playmaking? What are risks?\n\nInstructors: Michael William Cadden\n\nAMS 101\n\nAmerica Then and Now\n\nAn introduction to the interdisciplinary field of American studies. Employing history, theater, law, and politics, and focusing on such critical concepts as “community,” “xenophobia,” and “race,” we will consider the structures of knowing and feeling that have formed America since its founding. Throughout the course, we will pay special attention to the ways that culture and difference have shaped, and continue to shape, the signature ideas and debates that have made the nation what it is today. In the fall 2020 semester, we will be particularly interested in the political, social, and cultural questions that inform the current U.S. presidential election.\n\nInstructors: Patricia Fernández-Kelly, William Albert Gleason, Ali Adam Valenzuela\n\nAMS 306 / GHP 411\n\nIssues in American Public Health\n\nThe study of public health is an interdisciplinary inquiry involving issues of politics, policy, history, science, law, philosophy, ethics, geography, sociology, environmental studies, and economics, among others. Students will examine governments’ role in assuring and promoting health, through the exploration of issues on America’s “public health agenda,” such as epidemic response, tobacco use, the impact of weight on health, mandatory vaccination, disease prevention, and violence. In doing so, they will consider the impact of race, income, gender, place and environment, education, capitalism and democracy on health outcomes.\n\nInstructors: Leslie E. Gerwin\n\nAMS 317 / MTD 321 / THR 322\n\nSondheim’s Musicals and the Making of America\n\nIn this course, we’ll examine the musicals of Stephen Sondheim from Company (1970) to Road Show (2009) as a lens onto America. How have Sondheim’s musicals conversed with American history and American society since the mid-20th century? How do Sondheim’s musicals represent America and Americans, and how have various productions shaped and re-shaped those representations? We’ll explore how Sondheim and his collaborators used the mainstream, popular, and commercial form of musical theatre to challenge, critique, deconstruct, and possibly reinforce some of America’s most enduring myths.\n\nInstructors: Stacy E. Wolf\n\nAMS 343 / ENG 238\n\nPrivacy, Publicity, and the Text Message\n\nThis seminar will explore how we negotiate the distance between ourselves and others through text messages. Texts sustain an ambient intimacy that is increasingly redefining borders that range from the interpersonal — via anonymous mental health support — to the international — via reporting platforms for immigrant communities. What technical and social expectations of privacy do we operate with when sending a point-to-point message? How do novelists incorporate text messages into works of fiction? What does it mean that Frank Ocean can sing, “you text nothing like you look”?\n\nInstructors: Grant R. Wythoff\n\nAMS 398 / DAN 312 / GSS 346\n\nFAT: The F-Word and the Public Body\n\nThe fat body operates at the conjuncture of political economy, beauty standards, and health. This seminar asks, How does this “f-word” discipline and regulate bodies in /as public? What is the “ideal” American public body and who gets to occupy that position? How are complex personhood, expressivity, health, and citizenship contested cultural and political economic projects? We will examine the changing history, aesthetics, politics, and meanings of fatness using dance, performance, memoirs, and media texts as case studies. Intersectional dimensions of the fat body are central to the course. No previous performance experience necessary.\n\nInstructors: Judith Hamera\n\nAAS 306 / AMS 305\n\nTopics in Race and Public Policy: Race and Inequality in American Democracy\n\nThis course explores how ideas and discourses about race shape how public policy is debated, adopted and implemented. Black social movements and geopolitical considerations prompted multiple public policy responses to racial discrimination throughout the twentieth century. Despite these policy responses, discrimination persists, raising theoretical concerns about the dynamics of inclusion and exclusion, political representation, the role of the state (meaning government or law) in promoting social justice, and the role of social movements and civil society in democratizing policymaking and addressing group oppression.\n\nInstructors: Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor\n\nANT 419 / AMS 417 / GSS 423 / LAS 419\n\nRace, Gender, Empire\n\nHow is empire made? How is it imagined and reimagined, mutating and creating new global relations? What are its social, political and material signatures? In this seminar we will explore how empire’s derivative manifestations and entrenched mechanisms (e.g. race, gender or capitalism) influence our understandings of history and the structuring of our social relationships. Engaging transdisciplinary works we will focus on how empire constructs contradictory logics of belonging in localized contexts through the formation of intimate, biopolitical and ecological relationships between people, territories and collective institutions of governance.\n\nInstructors: Tiffany Cherelle Cain\n\nASA 324 / AMS 324 / ENG 244\n\nModel Minority Fictions\n\nWhere did the stereotype of Asian Americans as model minorities — overachieving whiz kids, industrious workers, “tiger mothers,” “crazy rich” Asians — come from? What accounts for the model minority myth’s persistence today? How has its representational scheme changed over time? Does model minoritism have a literary (and not only social) history? By reading across fiction, visual culture, and economic history, this seminar traces the changing definitions of Asians in the United States from “yellow peril” to model minorities: from the myth’s wartime origins, to the birth of American neoliberalism, and onward to the global rise of Asia in the 21st century.\n\nInstructors: Paul Nadal\n\nCWR 345 / AMS 345 / GSS 383\n\nSpecial Topics in Creative Writing: Writing Political Fiction\n\nIn traditional workshops content and context come second to craft. Here we will explore writing political fiction, the politics of fiction and writing as political engagement. We’ll read widely, from the most realistic depictions of the American political process and the varieties of immigrant experience to the work of Afrofuturists and feminists. The personal is the political and our frame will range from the global to the domestic. We will write stories that inhabit experiences other than our own. This course will allow students to make interdisciplinary connections between courses on history, politics and identity and creative writing.\n\nInstructors: A.M. Homes\n\nDAN 314 / AMS 335 / ANT 356 / THR 314\n\nPerformance in Extraordinary Times: Documenting and Analyzing the Present\n\nPerformance and crisis have always been partners: entangled in epidemics, state violence and resistance, and austerity regimes, as well as the crisis ordinariness of settler colonialism and structural racism. This seminar examines performance in our extraordinary present using autoethnography, ethnography, and interviews. Course readings and viewings offer historical and contemporary case studies. Guests will discuss the paired challenges of anti-racism and the COVID-19 pandemic for performance organizations. Students will collaborate on analyses of dance and performance organizations’ responses to COVID-19 and anti-racist imperatives.\n\nInstructors: Judith Hamera\n\nDAN 348 / AMS 349 / GSS 418 / MTD 349\n\nThe Reverence and Violence of Modern Dance\n\nThis hybrid studio/seminar course progresses in two tracks: one of embodied movement practices and the other of theoretico-historical critique. The canon of modern dance — arguably an American trajectory — is the source material for our interdisciplinary work. We will mimic and examine landmark choreographies in order to explore foundational tenets of modern art and modernity at large. Ableism and nihilism, sovereignty and sexuality, race and gender, are some of the themes that we will face along the path of analyzing the work of Martha Graham, Alvin Ailey, Bob Fosse, Merce Cunningham, George Balanchine, and Vaclav Nijinsky.\n\nInstructors: Netta Carnit Yerushalmy\n\nDAN 357 / AMS 358 / THR 357 / VIS 357\n\nAre You For Sale?
