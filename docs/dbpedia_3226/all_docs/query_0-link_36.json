        "text": "This post is all about the best 1950s film noir movies\n\nHard boiled detectives, sexy femme fatales, a heist that that is likely to go wrong… if you're a fan of film noir movies, you know there isn't another genre quite like it.\n\nWe pulled together 20 of our favorite 1950s film noir movies.\n\nSo grab some popcorn and take a seat while you find your next favorite film noir.\n\nWhat exactly is a film noir?\n\nThe term film noir is a bit of a strange term, it literally means \"black film\" or \"dark film\" in French.\n\nThe visual style has roots in german expressionism and is often shot with dark shadows, giving the films a “dark” feeling.\n\nWhile some argue that film noir has to be a literal black and white film, there are other film noirs that are in color.\n\nTherefore it’s not just the color that defines the genre, but there are other elements and themes that help define the genre.\n\nFilm noirs are also usually focused on the darker side of life or criminal underground in an urban setting, often San Francisco or New York.\n\nThis could be a heist about the take place, a detective working on a case, an affair, a murder, a robbery, or any combination! …the list goes on.\n\nThis “dark” feeling in film noirs was a stark comparison to other movies set in the 1950s like musicals which were lighthearted and happy.\n\nSome common elements of film include:\n\nThe Femme Fatale\n\nA gorgeous dame that often has questionable motives, often the gangster's moll.\n\nHardboiled lead\n\nThe male lead is often a detective or police officer, or a fall guy.\n\nGritty storyline\n\nThe story is often centered around some sort of crime that occurred or is being planned.\n\nHardboiled dialogue\n\nSnappy dialogue between characters is common in film noir. Witty comebacks are common.\n\nFilm noirs were creative in working within the code restrictions at the time.\n\nAs a result, film noirs often have a sad ending, as no character was allowed to get away with murder.\n\nSo, spoiler alert! Unless the lead character isn't that bad, or turns around during the film, don't expect them to get away with murder in a 1940s or 1950s film noir movie.\n\nWhen someone commits a murder in a film noir, you know it’s not going to end well for them.\n\nFilm noirs became popular in the early 1940s thanks to classic noir films like The Maltese Falcon and Double Indemnity.\n\n​The trend continued into the 1950s before fading in the 1960s.\n\nOccasionally we get a modern or “neo” film noir like Sin City, (which incidently went all out on the film noir theme and was even filmed in black and white) Nightmare Alley, The Prisoners, and Gone, Baby Gone.\n\nFor 1940s film noirs, you might like:\n\nKiller 1940s Film Noirs - The 1940s Film Noirs by Year"
