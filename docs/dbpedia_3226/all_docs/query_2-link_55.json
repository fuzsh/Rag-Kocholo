        "text": "A good sign of solid characters in film is when they are forced to make difficult decisions, forcing the audience to be invested in what choices they‚Äôll make. This will either bug an audience if they feel like they would‚Äôve done something completely different, or put them at ease if they feel like they‚Äôve made the right choice. In some films, however, characters can be faced with impossible decisions that will have drastic consequences no matter how they go about it. In cases like this, we‚Äôll often leave the cinema wracking our minds, trying to figure out what would have been the right choice, if it was made, and if there even was one.\n\nPrisoners (2013)\n\nAfter his daughter is kidnapped, Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) decides to try and find her himself since the police are taking their time. The moral dilemma comes in when the police stop investigating a suspect, who Keller Dover feels certain is guilty. After kidnapping the suspect, Keller is forced to decide whether he should torture a man who likely knows where his daughter is, or if he should refrain and let him go since there is a chance he‚Äôs innocent. If Keller where to let him go, he‚Äôd be faced with the risk of letting a little girl die, and if he were to torture him he‚Äôd faced with the risk of severly harming someone innocent. Keller ends up torturing him, but unfortunately for his conscience the suspect turns out to be innocent. The moral dilemma shows how it‚Äôs ineffective to inflict harm for the greater good, since the future is unpredictable despite our best guesses.\n\nüëâ Watch Prisoners on Amazon Prime\n\nüëâ Buy Prisoners as DVD on Amazon\n\nThe Killing Of A Sacred Deer (2017)\n\nThe Killing Of A Sacred Deer is an adaptation of the Greek myth of Iphigenia In Aulisa. In the myth, King Agamemmon kills a deer, an animal sacred to the goddess Artemis, forcing him to sacrifice his daughter in order to make things right. In The film, a doctor‚Äôs children start to become incredibly ill, and the son of a patient that died under the doctor‚Äôs operation warns him that he must kill one member of his family, or else they‚Äôll all die. Director Yorgos Lanthimos gave the myth a medical twist and delivered a thrilling moral dilemma. The film uses deadpan, direct dialogue which is perfectly executed by Colin Farell and Nicole Kidman to give the bleak situation undertones of humour. The elements of humour are present even in the most disturbing parts, like when the two dying children compete against each other to win over their fathers love, who's trying to decide which one to kill.\n\nüëâ Watch The Killing Of A Sacred Deer on Amazon Prime\n\nüëâ Buy The Killing Of A Sacred Deer as DVD on Amazon\n\nToy Story 2 (1999)\n\nThe world‚Äôs most beloved children's films often have something thatt will keep parents entertained, whether it be sly adult humour or challenging themes. In the case of Toy Story 2, It‚Äôs a moral dilemma. Woody is forced to choose between being meticulously maintained all his life and living forever, or to live his normal life with the people he loves. It‚Äôs a tale as old as time - having to choose between immortality or a short but full life. Toy Story 2 tackling this as a theme at the end makes it a little more than just another kids film.\n\nüëâ Watch Toy Story 2 on Amazon Prime\n\nüëâ Buy Toy Story 2 as DVD on Amazon\n\nThe Mist (2007)\n\nAdapted from Stephen King‚Äôs novel, The Mist is about a father and his son who get trapped in a supermarket after a mist filled with monsters takes over the town. At the end, they get hold of a car and attempt to escape the town with some other survivors, but the car breaks down and the monsters start approaching. This is where the film throws a truly disturbing moral dilemma at us - one that wasn‚Äôt even in the King of Horror‚Äôs book. The boy's father is faced with the decision to shoot his sleeping son and everyone else in the car, including himself, or to watch them be eaten by bloodthirsty monsters. Everyone else in the car agrees that suicide is the best option, and he ends up shooting all of them. The film decided to be especially cruel to its characters, as right before the father shoots himself, the mist vanishes and the military show up.\n\nüëâ Watch The Mist on Amazon Prime\n\nüëâ Buy The Mist as DVD on Amazon\n\nWatchmen (2009)\n\nWatchmen gives a similar Utilitarian moral dilemma to Prisoners. Ozymandias, the film's antagonist, kills three million people to prevent nuclear war. A new take on the villain archetype is given as we‚Äôre left uncertain about whether his actions were villainous or not. After one of the superheroes tells him ‚Äúkilled millions‚Äù, Ozymandias responds with ‚Äúto save billions‚Äù. The film's most memorable dialogue exchange really pushes this uncertainty forward. While Prisoners seems to be more critical of the ‚Äúgreater good‚Äù approach to these scenarios, Watchmen leaves more ambiguity.\n\nüëâ Watch Watchmen on Amazon Prime\n\nüëâ Buy Watchmen as DVD on Amazon\n\nSophie‚Äôs Choice (1982)\n\nThe film‚Äôs title already teases a moral dilemma, but it doesn‚Äôt give away how truly devastating and heartbreaking it is. Sophie is forced to choose which two of her children should be sent to a concentration camp, and which two to let live. The scene really punches you in the gut, making you imagine the horror of a mother having to make such a decision.\n\nüëâ Watch Sophie‚Äôs Choice on Amazon Prime\n\nüëâ Buy Sophie‚Äôs Choice as DVD on Amazon\n\nLooper (2012)\n\nIn the world of the film, criminals get sent back in time when they hadn‚Äôt committed a crime yet to get executed. This in itself rasies many ethical questions, but the true dilemma occurs when one of the executioners go back in time for his job, and he sees his older self getting executed.

The story revolves around a young man named Alex, played by Malcolm McDowell, who is a delinquent and the leader of a violent gang.\n\nThroughout the film, Alex and his gang commit heinous crimes, including assault, robbery, and rape. The government, in an attempt to \"cure\" Alex of his violent tendencies, subjects him to an experimental procedure called the Ludovico Technique. This treatment forcefully conditions Alex to become physically ill when he encounters violence, essentially disabling his ability to perform violent acts.\n\nThe moral dilemma in A Clockwork Orange arises when we, as viewers, are forced to question the morality of the Ludovico Technique. While the technique is successful in pacifying Alex, it also raises concerns about free will and human dignity. The audience is compelled to ask themselves if it is ethical to subject someone to such a procedure, even if it may ultimately benefit society by reducing violent crime.\n\nMoreover, the film examines how societal forces and a lack of social support contribute to the creation of individuals like Alex. His parents, teachers, and law enforcement all fail to provide the proper guidance, which may have contributed to his deviant behavior. The film raises questions about the responsibility of society in nurturing and rehabilitating individuals who have gone astray.\n\nIn A Clockwork Orange, Kubrick expertly utilizes various cinematic elements, such as the unsettling use of classical music during violent scenes and the vibrant, contrasting visuals, to heighten the tension and emphasize the moral complexities presented.\n\nBy presenting the audience with this impossible moral dilemma, A Clockwork Orange remains a powerful and thought-provoking film that continues to evoke discussions about the nature of good, evil, and personal responsibility.\n\nüëâ Watch A Clockwork Orange on Amazon Prime\n\nüëâ Buy A Clockwork Orange as DVD on Amazon\n\nThe Shawshank Redemption (1994)\n\nThe Shawshank Redemption is a critically acclaimed film that follows the story of a man, Andy Dufresne, who is wrongly convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. Throughout his incarceration at Shawshank State Penitentiary, Andy faces several impossible moral dilemmas that challenge the viewer's sense of right and wrong.\n\nOne of the key moral dilemmas that Andy faces is deciding whether to help the corrupt prison warden, Samuel Norton, with his illegal activities. Andy, a brilliant banker, provides financial advice and engages in money laundering for Norton to gain certain privileges within the prison. This raises the question of whether these actions are justifiable for someone who is innocent and seeking freedom.\n\nAndy's friendship with fellow inmate and narrator of the story, Ellis \"Red\" Redding, also presents a moral dilemma. Red is guilty of his crimes and has accepted his punishment within the prison system. However, Andy is instrumental in helping Red find redemption and ultimately freedom, despite his involvement in illicit activities. Some may argue that aiding a guilty individual towards freedom is morally wrong, while others may see it as a necessary part of Red's journey towards redemption.\n\nThe film also raises the question of vigilante justice, as Andy discovers evidence that could prove his innocence and secure his release. He is faced with the decision to submit this evidence to the proper authorities or take matters into his own hands. This complicates the viewer's understanding of justice and challenges them to decide whether legal mechanisms should always be trusted in the pursuit of truth.\n\nThe moral dilemmas presented in The Shawshank Redemption serve to engage the audience and heighten the emotional impact of Andy's journey. By exploring these complex issues, the film allows viewers to consider their own values and beliefs in the face of adversity.\n\nüëâ Watch The Shawshank Redemption on Amazon Prime\n\nüëâ Buy The Shawshank Redemption as DVD on Amazon\n\nOldboy (2003)\n\nOldboy is a South Korean film directed by Park Chan-wook, released in 2003. The film is known for its compelling narrative and various moral dilemmas faced by the protagonist. The story revolves around Oh Dae-su, who is imprisoned in a hotel room for 15 years without knowing the identity of his captor or the reason for his confinement. Once released, he faces a series of twisted challenges to find the person responsible for his imprisonment and seek revenge.\n\nThe film makes use of several moral dilemmas, such as questions of vengeance and forgiveness, trust, and the thin line between good and evil. As Oh Dae-su tries to unravel the truth behind his confinement, he is confronted with choices that force him to question his morals and ethics. The audience is taken on a journey of suspense and morally challenging decisions, ultimately revealing the antagonist's calculated manipulations that drove these impossible choices.\n\nOne such moral dilemma occurs when Oh Dae-su meets Mi-do, a young woman who becomes his romantic partner. As their relationship develops, the audience learns that Dae-su's captor might have manipulated circumstances involving Mi-do, demonstrating the captor's control over the protagonist's life. This scenario further complicates Dae-su's decisions, as he must consider not only his well-being but also the safety of Mi-do.\n\nThe film skillfully explores themes of confinement and revenge, using these complex moral dilemmas to bring forth thought-provoking, intense situations. Oldboy's gut-wrenching turns and heart-pounding moments keep the audience questioning the characters' morality and testing their assumptions about right and wrong.\n\nThroughout Oldboy, the protagonists and antagonists each reveal different facets of their characters, engaging the viewer in an emotional and intellectual struggle.

When Amy goes missing on their fifth wedding anniversary, Nick becomes the prime suspect in her disappearance. As the investigation unfolds, it becomes clear that Amy has staged her own abduction and meticulously framed her husband.\n\nThis concocted scenario forces viewers to question their own moral compass. On one hand, Amy's actions are driven by her dissatisfaction with her husband and a desire for revenge. But on the other hand, Nick's infidelity and dishonesty contribute to her motivation for this elaborate plan.\n\nThroughout the movie, audience members are faced with several conflicting perspectives. They must grapple with the ethics of Amy's manipulative actions, weighing them against Nick's shortcomings as a husband. The film masterfully explores the gray area between right and wrong, leaving viewers to ponder the boundaries of acceptable behavior within a relationship.\n\nThe juxtaposition of Amy's calculated and remorseless actions with Nick's more relatable character flaws creates an unsettling atmosphere. This dynamic presents a unique moral challenge to the audience as they are compelled to examine their own biases and question where the line between justice and retribution should be drawn. The complex moral landscape in Gone Girl brings forth an engaging and thought-provoking viewing experience.\n\nüëâ Watch Gone Girl on Amazon Prime\n\nüëâ Buy Gone Girl as DVD on Amazon\n\nTaxi Driver (1976)\n\nTaxi Driver is a 1976 American film directed by Martin Scorsese, written by Paul Schrader, and starring Robert De Niro. The movie centers around Travis Bickle, a mentally unstable Vietnam War veteran who becomes a taxi driver in New York City.\n\nTravis is depicted as a lonely, depressed individual who struggles with insomnia. As he spends more time on the streets, he witnesses the crime and immorality within the city, which fuels his growing disillusionment and anger. The film presents several moral dilemmas, which are closely tied to Travis' psychological state and his increasingly violent tendencies.\n\nOne key moral dilemma arises when Travis becomes infatuated with Betsy, a campaign volunteer for a presidential candidate. Despite Travis' genuine feelings for Betsy, his social awkwardness and inability to relate to her ultimately cause their relationship to falter. This failure further exacerbates his sense of isolation.\n\nAnother significant dilemma is presented with the character of Iris, a 12-year-old runaway turned prostitute. Travis becomes fixated on the idea of \"saving\" her from her involvement in this dangerous and exploitative lifestyle. Although his intentions are somewhat noble, his disconnection from reality and his willingness to resort to extreme violence in his pursuit of her liberation make his actions ethically questionable.\n\nThe climactic scene of Taxi Driver raises a final moral dilemma, as Travis sets out on a rampage, targeting the criminals and corrupt politicians who he believes are responsible for the city's degradation. While his actions might be seen as an attempt to bring about justice and purge the city of its ills, his methods are undeniably brutal, and he effectively becomes a vigilante.\n\nTaxi Driver masterfully portrays the complexity of human morality and poses difficult questions about the consequences of vigilantism, the limits of personal responsibility, and the role of mental illness in shaping our actions.\n\nüëâ Watch Taxi Driver on Amazon Prime\n\nüëâ Buy Taxi Driver as DVD on Amazon\n\nThank You for Smoking (2005)\n\n\"Thank You for Smoking\" is a satirical comedy-drama film that presents an interesting moral dilemma for its viewers.

Set during the Holocaust, the movie tells the true story of Oskar Schindler, a German industrialist who saved the lives of over 1,100 Jews during World War II by employing them in his factories.\n\nThe moral dilemma at the heart of Schindler's List is the question of what one individual can truly do to save lives in the face of institutionalized evil.

As time goes on, however, he becomes committed to rescuing as many individuals as possible from extermination.\n\nSchindler's List brings viewers face-to-face with the horror of the Holocaust, but it also offers them a chance to ponder the impact that one person's choices can have on the lives of others.

Based on the novel by Cormac McCarthy, the story revolves around the pursuit of stolen drug money in the desolate Texas landscape.\n\nThe protagonist, Llewelyn Moss (played by Josh Brolin), discovers a crime scene involving a drug deal gone wrong and decides to take the money, unwittingly setting off a chain of events that tests the morals of each character. Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) becomes involved in the investigation and struggles with the violent world he encounters, while the enigmatic and ruthless hitman Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) pursues Moss and the money.\n\nThroughout the film, each character is confronted with moral decisions that are not easily categorized as right or wrong. For example, Moss's decision to take the money initially appears to be purely selfish, but as the story unfolds, his attempts to protect his family and outsmart Chigurh reveal that he is not a simple criminal.\n\nSimilarly, the character of Chigurh, while cold and merciless, operates on a strict code of ethics. He often decides the fate of his victims with a coin toss, highlighting the randomness and unfairness of life. This practice further complicates the moral landscape of the film, as Chigurh's actions are both horrifying and strangely principled.\n\nSheriff Bell, despite being the law enforcement figure, is often powerless to stop the violence occurring around him. His inability to protect innocent bystanders forces him to reflect upon the changing world and question the value of his role in it. He is faced with the difficult decision of whether to continue pursuing justice in an increasingly brutal environment.\n\n_Perhaps one of the most striking aspects of No Country for Old Men is its lack of a clear moral hierarchy. The characters constantly grapple with difficult choices, and their actions often have unintended consequences. The movie confronts the audience with the harsh reality of life's uncertainties and the blurred lines between good and evil.\n\nIn summary, No Country for Old Men masterfully explores the concept of impossible moral dilemmas through its complex, morally ambiguous characters and thought-provoking narrative. The film is an outstanding example of cinema that challenges and captivates the viewer, leaving a lasting impact on those who experience the story.\n\nüëâ Watch No Country for Old Men on Amazon Prime\n\nüëâ Buy No Country for Old Men as DVD on Amazon\n\nThe Dark Knight (2008)\n\nIn Christopher Nolan's 2008 film, The Dark Knight, it portrays a complex and layered narrative that centers around impossible moral dilemmas.

This 1975 film, directed by Milos Forman, is based on Ken Kesey's novel of the same name. The story revolves around Randle McMurphy, a criminal who feigns insanity to serve his sentence in a mental institution rather than prison. Upon his arrival, he faces the oppressive and authoritarian Nurse Ratched, who attempts to control the patients completely.\n\nThe moral dilemma in this film centers on the clashing of two different approaches to mental health treatment. On one hand, Nurse Ratched represents the traditional medical system with strict rules and regulations, while McMurphy introduces an unconventional, rather rebellious perspective that values humanity and compassion. The question arises: which approach is morally right, and is it possible to maintain a balance between the two?\n\nOne of a series of seemingly unethical movies, we see the consequences of both perspectives. Nurse Ratched's methods lead to the dehumanization of patients and contribute to an unhealthy environment that stifles recovery. However, McMurphy's actions prioritize the patients' well-being and happiness over their overall mental health. This often results in short-term relief but could become problematic in the long run.\n\nViewers are left to grapple with the dilemma, as there seems to be no definitive solution. One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest illustrates the complexity of mental health treatment and raises important questions about the ethics of authority figures and their impact on vulnerable individuals. The film urges the audience to consider the appropriate balance between control and freedom, as well as the responsibilities tied to the care of people with mental illnesses.\n\nüëâ Watch One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest on Amazon Prime\n\nüëâ Buy One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest as DVD on Amazon\n\nBatman Forever (1995)\n\nBatman Forever, directed by Joel Schumacher, is an action-adventure film that explores the never-ending battle of good versus evil.
