        "text": "George Clooney's friend and frequent co-star Matt Damon addressed rumors surrounding the actor entering politics, saying he'd \"be amazing.\"\n\nSpeaking on Wednesday's episode of the Australian news program Sunrise, the 53-year-old Bourne Identity star said he'd vote for the Hollywood legend \"in a second\" if he left the movie world behind.\n\nDamon appeared alongside co-star Casey Affleck, 48, on the program to discuss their new heist film, The Instigators, with correspondent Steve Hargrave. Talk turned to Clooney, 63, but Damon suggested that now wasn't the time for the politically active actor to make a career change.\n\n\"As his mates, where do you stand? Would he get your vote?\" Hargrave asked, two weeks after Clooney, a major Democratic Party donor, endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic Party's presidential nominee.\n\n\"He would in a second,\" Damon replied. \"He'd be amazing.\"\n\nHowever, he continued, \"But I just think, he's got young kids and my guess is that's not where his life is right now. He's a phenomenal guy.\"\n\n\"He'd do a good job—super smart, charming and he would win Ohio,\" Affleck added. Clooney spent much of his childhood in the state,\n\nHargrave quipped: \"It's just a shame he's not very good-looking, as we always say.\"\n\nJoining in on the joke, Damon laughed and replied, \"I know. You can't have everything.\"\n\nNewsweek reached out to a representative for George Clooney for comment.\n\nDamon's remarks come after sources allegedly within the Democratic Party told DailyMail.com that Clooney's involvement in the presidential race is in an effort to line up a future spot in the White House.\n\nLast month, Clooney was one of several key Democrats to call for President Joe Biden to step down as the party's 2024 presidential nominee over concerns about his age and health.\n\nClooney wrote in a July 10 op-ed for The New York Times that while he admires Biden and considers him a friend, \"We are not going to win in November with this president. On top of that, we won't win the House, and we're going to lose the Senate.\"\n\nClooney said in a statement to CNN after Biden later announced that he was dropping out of the race and endorsing Harris as the presumptive nominee: \"President Biden has shown what true leadership is. He's saving democracy once again. We're all so excited to do whatever we can to support Vice President Harris in her historic quest.\"\n\nDamon and Clooney have worked on numerous films together over the years, including Ocean's Eleven (2001), Confessions of a Dangerous Mind (2002), Ocean's Twelve (2004) and Ocean's Thirteen (2007), Syriana (2005), The Monuments Men (2014) and IF (2024).\n\nClooney, who is father to 7-year-old twins Ella and Alexander, went on to direct Damon in 2017's Suburbicon, too."
