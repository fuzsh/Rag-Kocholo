        "text": "Key Largo, American film noir, released in 1948, that is widely considered a classic of the genre. It was directed by John Huston, stars married actors Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall, and was loosely based on a 1939 play by Maxwell Anderson.\n\nBogart played against type as Frank McCloud, a cynical army veteran who visits a hotel on Floridaâ€™s Key Largo owned by the father (played by Lionel Barrymore) and young widow (Bacall) of one of his military comrades. McCloud finds himself among the captives in the hotel when it is taken over by notorious gangster Johnny Rocco (Edward G. Robinson) and his gang of thugs, who are hoping to hide out until they can escape to Cuba. Although he initially seems nonheroic and maintains a stance of noninvolvement, McCloud comes to despise Rocco for his cruelty, and he decides to fight back. The drama is heightened by the violent hurricane battering the island.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nOscar-Worthy Movie Trivia"
