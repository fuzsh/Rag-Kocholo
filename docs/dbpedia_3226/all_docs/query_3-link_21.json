Item #17946\n\nKey Largo, a play by Maxwell Anderson, unfolds in verse with a prologue and two acts. Set in Key Largo, Florida, during a hurricane, it portrays Frank McCloud, a WWII veteran, visiting the family of a fallen comrade. He discovers the hotel occupied by gangster Johnny Rocco, evading the law. Amidst rising tension and violence, McCloud must safeguard the trapped innocents, delving into themes of morality, loyalty, and the aftermath of violence.\n\nBasis for the Oscar-winning 1948 film noir directed by John Huston, starring Humphrey Bogart, Lauren Bacall, Edward G. Robinson, and Lionel Barrymore. A handsome copy of a scarce film noir source title, one that is almost always difficult to find in anything resembling collectable condition.\n\nRef: Hirsch 150; Johnson v1 8"
