        "text": "the world will always be shit so long as good men do nothing about fat gangsters.\n\nachieves a remarkable sense of place for a film shot on a backlot. Bogart is sweeter than you expect, as he often was in the Huston films, but this is Edward G. Robinson's show and he sells it so well.\n\n80\n\nPost-war in that every character is dealing with the repression of reconciling with their own trauma. That this sweaty, theatrical Noir utilizes a hurricane storm swirling outside the one-location is a representation of how no one got away from WWII unscathed. Key Largo, with its lightning and thunder and howling wind, is always on the verge of Horror. Falters by the end, but in the meantime, it's as sharp and ruthless as the very best of John Huston.\n\nHot dog, what an awesome movie! This is maybe my sixth time watching. The first time I watched Key Largo I thought it was OK, but not great. Not sure what headspace I was in then, because the acting in this is top notch. The underrated Claire Trevor is a standout (she won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her work here), but everyone, Bogart, Robinson, Barrymore, and Thomas Gomez are all in top form. Probably the best that Bacall has ever been. Huston has some nicely framed shots and sets things up well. Highly recommended and if you don't love it, watch it again.\n\n\"You don't like it, do you Rocco, the storm? Show it your gun, why don't you? If it doesn't stop, shoot it.\"\n\nBogey, Bacall and Huston oh my.\n\nYou know it's gonna be something special if Bogey goes the whole film refusing a drink... This noir potboiler bathed in shadows and angles and ocean water has an incredible sense of place and spaces and the kind of rowdy movie star performances (save Bogey who's more gentle here than in maybe anything else he ever played in) that simply don't exist anymore. That it's a play essentially about the inescapable repercussive storm of WWII makes it all the more compelling, exciting and unnerving.\n\nEdward G Robinson is the original fat gangster made over and Claire Trevor's wry drunken lover performance is truly one for the ages despite that it's gone vastly unnoticed within the pantheon of Oscar-winning performances.\n\n(The Average Joe‚Äôs Movie Club Cast)\n\nTrapped in a hotel in the middle of a Hurricane, Humphrey Bogart faces off against a couple of wise guys.\n\n\"No, Mr. Temple, it wasn't you. It wasn't the law or anybody. It was only Johnny Rocco. Nobody in the whole world is safe as long as he's alive.\"\n\nKey Largo got off to a slow start and just felt like one of those people talking in a room kinda movies. But then it dawned on me that this had to have been one of Quentin Tarantino's influences for 'The Hateful Eight', which got me a little more invested. The film has some interesting things to say about how gangsters were viewed back then, but overall I would only recommend this one to big-time noir fans.\n\nFor my full discussion on Key Largo with Joey Porter just click HERE!\n\nThanks for reading.\n\nHappy movie watching ... Sk√•l! üçª\n\nIn Key Largo, Bogey plays Frank, a morally conflicted WW II vet who‚Äôs just passing through. Bacall plays Nora, a rock solid war widow who helps her father run a Key Largo hotel. Edward G. Robinson plays Johnny Rocco, a mob boss waiting on a business deal from Miami. John Huston directs them in what‚Äôs advertised as a ‚ÄúSizzling Florida Keys noir!‚Äù Can‚Äôt lose, right? At first, Key Largo seemed like a single location film in which three iconic actors would simply bounce their favorite personas off each other for 100 minutes.\n\nLike in Casablanca, Bogart has to decide whether he wants to continue walling himself off from the rest of the world, or make himself vulnerable by admitting that he‚Ä¶"
