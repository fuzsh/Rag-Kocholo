        "text": "Ugo Foscolo, was an Italian poet whose works rank among the masterpieces of Italian literature. Talented and well educated in philosophy, classics, and Italian literature, Foscolo gave literary expression to his ideological aspirations and to the numerous amorous experiences in odes, sonnets, plays, poems and an epistolary novel. Concurrent with his rich literary output, Foscolo&#39;s correspondence represents a unique perspective from which to monitor his literary and political views and investigate aspects of his everyday life. Among other interesting information, one can find elements of Foscolo&#39;s medical history which is generally unknown. Based on his testimonies we suggest that he suffered of longstanding bladder outlet obstruction presumably due to urethral stricture. In the present article we investigate the possibility that chronic bladder outlet obstruction and the consequent renal insufficiency was attributed to the death of Ugo Foscolo.\n\nSome medical treatises from medieval France and Italy demonstrate surprising rhetorical exuberance, especially in the paratexts where an authorial persona can emerge in the first person. This essay launches from the scatological metaphors and epithets in the exordia of works and commentaries by the physicians Archimattheus, Gilles of Corbeil, and Gentile da Foligno. In captationes benevolentiae styled after Ciceronian precepts, these authors attack their rivals before presenting their own superior science. Their scurrilous invectives-\"Hoc salernitani cacantes sanitatem nominant!\" (This is what the shitting Salernitans call health!); \"discursores alienis fecibus imbuti\" (vagrants steeped in other dreck)-tap into carnivalesque modes where excrement is organic, filthy, vituperative, and comic, in contrast to the sterility of the treatises' technical, Scholastic discourse. A close reading of Gilles's twelfth-century Carmina de urinarum iudiciis (Songs on Judging Urine) and Gentile's fourteenth-century commentary on this verse treatise shows that both of these experts in uroscopy tie their excremental imagery into a nuanced poetics that extends from the paratexts into the heart of the work. Both writers demonstrate acute metaliterary sensibility, and respectable training in classical and medieval theories of rhetoric and poetry. Gilles defends his choice to write in verse through a constellation of metaphors pitting the synthetic clarity of both urine and poetry against the muddled confusion of feces and prose. He further ennobles his work by comparing the hermeneutics of uroscopy with allegorical interpretation. Gentile assumes the role of exegete, interpreting Gilles's verses and unveiling their philosophical and theoretical underpinnings.\n\nThe study was devised to understand the contribution to nephrology ofDe Medicina Methodicaof Prospero Alpini published in 1511, at a time when the fame of the professor reached the azimuth. We have analyzed the contents of chapters devoted to nephrology in that book of Prospero Alpini and the novelties of his message. Prospero Alpini (1563-1616) taught at the University of Padua (1594-1616), at the same time of Galileo Galilei, Santorio Santorio, and Girolamo Fabrizi dAcquapendente, when measurements (pulse, temperature, perspiration) were introduced into medicine. He was a travelling physician to whom we owe fundamental contributions to the use of urine to prognosticate life and death (De Praesagienda vita et morte aegrotantium libri septem, Venetiis, apud Haeredes Melchioris Sessae,1601). As prefect of the Botanical Garden - the first ever and a model in the world - he could turn the study of simples into cures(De Medicina Methodica Libri Tredecim. Patavi, apud Franciscum Bolzetta...\n\nGiuseppe Mazzini announced, but never actually wrote, a biography of the Italian patriot and poet, Ugo Foscolo. This article recounts Foscolo's last years in exile by means of available documents in order to explain why Mazzini renounced the writing of Foscolo's biography and decided instead to complete and publish, under the latter's name, an edition of Dante's Divine Comedy that Foscolo had merely begun to sketch. Once he arrived in London, Mazzini suddenly shied away from the proposition, and having retrieved Foscolo's manuscripts for an edition of the Divina Commedia under Foscolo's name, decided instead to effect one of the most influential forgeries of the history of Italian literature: he substituted himself for Foscolo, completing the latter's edition of the Divina Commedia, and had it published, preceded by a preface written in an unapolo-getically patriotic tone and signed 'Un Italiano.' Why did Mazzini renounce his intention of writing a biography of Foscolo and decide instead to attempt a philological operation, quite removed from his own interests, which he did not want to attribute to his own scholarly merit and which, in fact, would constrain him, when near death, to a full confession?\n\nUrology is a branch of clinical medicine that deals with etiology, pathogenesis and diagnosis of urinary tract disorders in men and women, and reproductive organs in men. Physician specialists in this area are called urologists and he has been trained to diagnose and treat urogenital disorders. Urogenital tract disorders under Urology include urinary tract infections, kidney and urinary bladder with various bacteria, as well as men's prostate inflammation, kidney function disorders such as urinary traps, birth anomaly, kidney stone, benign and malignant kidney tumors. This paper was created according to the rules of the desk research methodology in which the author elaborated the available medical literature in the field of urology. The result of the study is the treatment that the doctor must take when a malignant patient comes to him."
