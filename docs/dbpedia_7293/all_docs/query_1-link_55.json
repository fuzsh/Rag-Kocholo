[from our regular correspondent.] Eastern Office Lockwood Press, I 250 Devonshire St., Boston, July i, 1884. f Six months of the year have now passed, and as soon as the June accounts are footed up the volume of business for the first half of the year can be more accurately stated. If one can believe the various statements — and I see no reason for doubting the asser- tions— trade has been even better than many had predicted early in the season. Many of the leading jobbers of stationers' supplies, as well as some of the manufacturers of special- ties, claim to have had an increased amount of trade over the same period of last year. Col- .ections, generally, have been good, though I do hear of some cases to the contrary. For the holiday trade the Thorpe Manufac- turing Company is presenting a line of albums and scrap-books which will not be excelled by any house in the country. The line is very extensive, and comprises many very effective designs. One series of scrap-books, called \" Ideal Heads,\" is particularly attractive. The front cover of this book is in gold, or rather a gold bac'^-jround serves to bring out in strong relief the figure of a child's head. These heads are of various designs, and are litho- graphed in colors. The \" Longfellow Album \" is another beautiful work, its title-page being in fifteen colors. The lithographing is done by Armstrong, and the designing is by the most eminent artists. This album is replete with illustrations, which give pictorial presen- tations of many of Longfellow's most beauti- ful poems, while each page bears apt quota- tions from the great poet. Another album is« the \" Hour,\" in which appropriate selections from American poets 01. morning, noon, evening and midnight, are beautifully illus- trated with pictorial presentations. Among the scrap-books is a line having for front covers some very artistic designs in bronze bass reliefs. This line is ver;, rich in effect and is decidedly quite a novelty. For origi- nality of conception, beauty of designs and artistic workmanship, these goods will not be surpassed by any house in America, and I doubt if foreign importations will equal them. The special -.J.idjc_:purhberi-6f- The American,^ STATiONJERf^'will give the tfafte'-^ome idea of what the Thorpe Mkiiafacturing Company has to offer in albums and scrap-books, and the trade should be on the lookout for it. Downes & Atwood are displaying some ele- gant samples of holiday goods. The line em- braces hand-painted sachets very neatly boxed, some very pretty satin wall-pockets of unique design and an extensive stock of Christmas, New Year and souvenir cards. A very pretty | card-receiver shown consists of a fringed cres- cent card mounted upon a satin background ancl designed for wall decoration. The \" Kit- tie \" sachet is a pretty little device, having a tiny envelope attached, upon which is in- scribed \" greetings,\" and makes a very attrac- tive souvenir for children. Satin Christmas books, embellished with a number of choice coromo cards are also among the holiday goods displayed. These novelties are all manufactured by this house exclusively for its ojvn trade, and are really what may be styled novelties of the season. Henry A. Young & Co., stationers and pub- lishers, have removed from their old stand, 25 Arch street, to 55 Franklin street. An in- creasing business necessitated the change, as more spacious quarters and greater facilities were needed. I. B. De Nike, representing Cameron & Amberg's Peerless Letter File, is now in this city, looking after the business interests of his house. Mr. De Nike expects to remain in Bos- ton for some six or eight weeks. He claims that the Peerless Letter File is now in use in 569 cities and towns, with several counties yet to hear from. G. W. Shepard, of G. W. Shepard & Co., manufacturer of the patent wooden back in- voice-books, of Troy, N. Y., spent a few days of last week among the stationers of this city. Though only two years since Shepard's wooden-back invoice-books were patented and presenting to the trade, large numbers of them are in use, and the demand is steadily increas- ing. The trade here find them a salable article. Mr. Downes, of Downes & Atwood, who for some weeks has been traveling in the West,, presented to the trade samples of his holiday goods, is expected home in time to celebrate the Fourth of July. After a few days recrea- tion he will take the road again. OnJlVednesday night of last week a fire was liscovered in the building 105 to 11 1 Summer street, in which were located a number of prin- ters. Among those who suffer loss are : Geo. B. King, S. Woodberry & Co., Percival T. Bartlett, William J. Schofield, printers ; the Bailey Combination Type and Printing Com- pany, and Jones & Butterfield, publishers of the Railroad Advertiser. Geo. B. King suffers a loss of $2,000 — the loss of the others is not over a few hundred dollars each. The office of Samuel Hand & Co., manufac- turers of manifold copying books, which is located on the third floor of the building, was slightly damaged by water. A. L. D. TORONTO GOSSIP. [from our regular CORRESPONDENT.] Toronto, June 28, 1884. I had to take a run up to Hamilton a few days ago, and while there had a look-in on a few friends. Mr. Duncan, of R. Dune? ^ <*'; Co., informed me that their spring trad'> had been first-class, and that it was then i,jv \" Charlie,\" manager of the Duncan I'fhogra^ establishment, said that they were full vvi h orders, and, to impress me with th. truth jf the statement, showed me around the place. If I had had any doubts, they were all dis- pelled. The machines were running at : speed, and every employee seemed to have on hand all he or she could attend to. The above statement makes it unnecessary for me to say that good work is turned out. If it w°-e not so, there would be much less to do. My next point was John Eastwood & Co. Mr. Eastwood and wife are in England for the summer. Mr. Cloack said that their spring trade was good, and that it was all they looked for at this time of year. My impression is, and has been for some time, that these houses have the best retail business ir the province, and they deserve it. Few nieii have devoted such unremitting attention to business as our friends R. Duncan and John Eastwood. On Monday last I had to' make another dash out, and this time my first point was St. Thomas. I had not been in this town for some three years. I n^ijced a number 0/ changes, new buildings and others being erected, and that sort of|rthing. I was in Mc- Lachlin's, the oldest bookseller and stationer THE AMERICAI^ STATIONER in the place. Mr. Forbes, who now manages the business, said that they had had a good spring trade, but that it was dull just now. From this I went into London, which is only a few miles distant, and heard there very much the same story I hear here every day and have heartl about the country for the last few weeks, that is, that trade is dull. liut this is just what every one expects at this time of year ; never- theless, people must grumble. It has come to be a chronic complaint, and at certain times of the year if one didn't growl, he might be in danger of being arrested as a lunatic. I saw Mr. Anderson, of J. Anderson & Co., and while he admitted that trade was quiet just now, yet the spring trade had been good and they had no reason to complain. Rcid Brothers and others reiterated the above. I remained over one train in Stratford. The party I wanted to see here was out of town. It was altogether too hot to saunter about the streets. The place looked very much as it did five or six years ago. The people I saw said business was dull, and I was glad after four hours to get out and away. My last point was Guelph. I found my old friend Day — as you will always find him — very much like a bee in a tar bucket. I use this old saw because it is understood to mean diligent and all that, but I I have never been able to see the point. Is it because this industrious little insect doesn't find a tar bucket equal to a clover blossom ? I would like some light. There is this about Mr. Day : he is a hard worker, and the best part of it is that he has not worked in vain, for if he has metaphorically buzzed about tar buckets, he has gathered up honey, and I hope he may live long to enjoy it. When I was there he was haunted by three or four commercials, but no one knows better how to meet these Gentiles than he. It will be in order to say a word about weather and crops. As to the first, we have had remarkably hot weather, and for a week or more I was nearly melted, but fortunately there came a change last Wednesday and it is much more agreeable now. So far as I could see in this run of over three hundred miles, the crops of all kinds are most promis- ing. I have the same statements from all parts of the country, and if things go well for the next five or six weeks we shall have an im- mense harvest. During next week, commencing on Monday, we celebrate the semi-centennial of the found- ing of this city, and we expect to have a big time. Preparations are being made on a large scale, and we shall no doubt have such a crowd here as has never been seen before. I may say something about it when it is over. In view of the above, everything has been very quiet in the city for the last few days. Upon the whole, I do not think we have much reason to grumble. A last word. I have some recollection about an editor complaining about too much work, with its attendants, and have prescribed several times, without result. If you are bound to wear the machine out, I can't help it, but let me say, you cannot round up the full measure of your existence without taking in our beauti- ful city. You might feel ready to take your flight to a better world after a short visit, from the realization of the fact that the world had nothing better to offer. Then there are the wilds of Muskoka, with its charming lakes and scenery, which I have told you about, where the most beautiful fish arc just wild to be pulled out of their natural clement. Why, sir, I have no doubt a visit here would add years to your life, open up visions of beauty that you never dreamt of, and give a tone to your system that would enable you to grasp your pen with such power that — on second thought, I came to the conclusion that it would be better not to finish that sentence. Au revoir! C. H. Modern Antiquities from Persia. The United States Consul-General at Teheran reports the springing up of a new in- dustry in that capital, viz., \"the manufacture of imitation of ancient Persian armor and coins to meet the extensive demands of Euro- pean collectors,\" to which may be added Amer- ican buyers. The ancient armor of Persia, es- pecially of the palmy days of Shah Abbas, often displayed extraordinary beauty, costli- ness, and skill. But the museums of Europe long since absorbed most of the best examples of one of the most interesting of the industrial arts of the East. Specimens still exist, but are not easily obtained, and only at a high price and by those resident in the country and able to ferret out the old families who still possess fine bits of the magnificent metal- work for which Persia was once justly famous. But if not as inventive as formerly, the Per- sian craftsmen are scarcely less skillful in handiwork to-day, while labor continues cheap. If there are no armies now to be clad with carved and inlaid helmets, breastplates and bucklers, there is an army of collectors, artists and virtuosi, studios or banqueting halls, and the artisans of Persia have taken up the business of manufacturing old arms, which may be pur- chased for reasonable prices. Ispahan is the centre of this industry. Nor let it be thought that these imitations are poorly made. The Persians can imitate admirably, and these modern antiques are often made in a costly manner, inlaid with silver and gold after exqui- site designs of the most elaborate character. Sometimes these pseudo-antiques are sold with little attempt to conceal the fact that they are new, while in many cases much cunning has been exercised in giving them the appearance of antiquity. Only an expert could detect the difference between some of these imitations and the gen- uine antique. Many of these imitations are now exported. Even the fajnous blades of Khorassan, whose wavy steel rivaled in tem- per that of Damascus, is cleverly imitated in appearance, if not in quality, by modern chem- ical devices. The Jews of Hamadan, writes Mr. Benjamin, also carry on an extensive manufacture of spu- rious antique coins, against which the public should be warned. That city, the ancient Ec- batana, abounds above any other city in Persia, probably, in antiquities, and the soil seems to be full of gold and silver ornaments, coins and the like. Although pretty well dug over of late years, the supply does not seem to be exhaust- ed. Fine examples of the silver coins of Alex- andef the Great and the Sassanidje are com- mon. Rut the greed with which these have been snatched up by travelers and collectors has led the Jews of that city to consider it easier to counterfeit them than to dig for them. A steady supply of spurious coins is therefore constantly furnished the market from this source. It is customary for those who carry them around for sale to have a few genuine coins mingled in with the spurious ones. To the eye the difference is often slight, and the cheat is only detected by the ring of the genu- ine metal and the dull thud of the baser coins. Even gold antiques are thus imitated, having a coating of real gold, and cleverly simulating all the appearance of age. The manufacture of glazed ceramic ware in imitation of the antique is also extensively car- ried on at Ispahan, but with less success than the imitation of old armor. Some interesting tiles are indeed turned out with rich glazes, which are very creditable. But, with the ex- ception of blue, the colors do not approach the superb character of the former ceramic art of Persia, while the art of making n'Jlets or iri- descent glazes seems to be entirely forgotten. It is. safe to assume that the ri?Jlet tiles or dishes which occasionally reach the market are really old, dating back 600 to 1,000 years. They are generally stolen from the interior of celebrated mosques or shrines at the risk of life. Consequently they are expensive. The blue cashee works of or before the time of Shah Abbas and the Sefanian dynasty are also difficult, if not impossible, to imitate, and also the antique, milk-white, translucent por- celain, which is now rare and costly. Other Persian ceramic wares assuming to be antique should be received with caution and their antiquity proved by experts before the purchaser allows his money to pass into the hands of the dealer. One test for proving the tiles lies in the difference of texture of the wares. The old ware was baked much harder than is the present custom of the Persians, and hardly yields to the scratch of a nail, while the latter can easily be ground or punctured. The lovers of artistic binding will be most interested in a magnificent relic of Grolier's sumptuous collection lately added to the Astor Library. It is a Latin Bible, printed in Paris in 1558, in size a folio, measuring about six- teen by eleven inches, and its original calf binding is still in an excellent state of preser- vation. The edges are gilt and gauffered, and the sides and back are splendidly ornamented, the ground color being a dark brown, with . painted compartments of black, green and red. The elaborate gilt tooling of the sides is very characteristic of the Grolier binding, and is bordered by an interlacing geometrical de- sign. The centrepiece of the obverse is in- scribed, \" Quisque suos,\" in gilt letters, and the reverse ends the sentence, \" patimur manes.' At the bottom of the obverse is the famous inscription, \" lo. Grolierii et amico- rum.\" He that liveth wickedly can hardly die honestly. Julys, 1884.] THE AMERICAN STATIOISTEE. OIL.3D iOElI^KlSim^E: Js/LXX^X^& GHAELES 0. BEOWN, President.

About $2,030 is secured by a mortgage on the debtor's stock. The house of Fairbanks, Palmer & Co., subscription book publishers, of Nos. 133 and 13s Wabash avenue, Chicago, was closed by the sheriff on Monday. Their failure is due to that of G. W.

Early on Monday morning confessions of judgment were entered in the Superior Court in favor of W. J. Durham, acting for the Commercial National Bank, for $21,200, and James T. Hoyne, act- ing for the Metropolitan National Bank, for $10,100. Felsenthal, Gross & Miller got out an attachment to cover a note for $684.40. The liabilities will reach $40,000, and Mr. Fair- banks hopes the assets will reach this amount. There is $io,ooo to $15,000 worth of merchan- dise on hand, and the same amount in valu- able plates.

Alt)ert Strasburger has retired from the firm of Oscar Strasburger & Co., toy and fancy goods dealers, the co-partnership agreement existing between him and Oscar Strasburger having expired by limitation. The Chicago Installment Book Company and George W. Borland, who was its presi- dent, have confessed judgments for $40,600 and made an assignment. In April the com- pany claimed assets of $149,102 and liabilities of $132,812, including capital stock of $100,000- In the assets were notes for capital stock of $51,500. Mr. Borland owned nearly all of the stock. The announcement was made shortly before noon on Saturday that Butler & Miles, paper dealers, at 23 Beekman street, New York, had made an assignment to William Allan, attor- ney-at-law. No. 317 Broadway. In view of the recent statements made by the Mercantile Agen- cies of the condition of the firm, and the fur- ther facts that goods had been delivered to it after its failure, the intelligence was a surprise to a great many. The firm consisted of Ed- ward Butler, Jr., and Walter V. Miles, and had only been in existence since March i, 1883, and was supposed to have had a capital of $30,000. The assignment makes a preference in favor of Rebecca C. Miles, said to be the mother Walter V. Miles, on two promissory notes, of $1,600 and $400 respectively. This is the only preference. The assignee expresses his inability to give any estimate of the liabili- ties of the firm, but says that its assets will go far toward paying its debts, and the members of the firm, in answer to the question put to them by a reporter of this paper, as to the amount of their liabilities and assets, said that they were unable to give any correct estimate of either, but hoped by next week that they would have a full statement of their affairs ready to be placed on record. As near as can be ascertained the firm owes about $50,000. Among the principal creditors are Vernon Brothers & Co., and the American Wood Paper Company, about $4,000 each ; Smith Company $1,500 ; McAIpine Brothers, Lee, Mass., $500 to $600; Wilder & Co., Boston, Mass., and Frank H. Wittlesey, Windsor Locks, Conn., and several concerns at Lam- bertville, N. J., are also said to be interested as creditors. After the statement is prepared the assignee will call a meeting of the credi- tors. On March i, 1883, the following state- ment was made to a city mercantile agency : \" Edwin Butler, Jr., states that the firm of Butler & Miles was formed March i, 1883. Mr. Coffin paid off in full with our check for his interest in stock, good-will, &c., and we took his receipt. We have assumed all the old firm's liabilities and paid off $8,000 already and will pay $6,000 to $7,000 in a few days. On March I, 1883, had capital of $33,000 net, none borrowed. Mr. Miles was a bookseller and publisher, but has given up that line of business and will be actively engaged here. We propose to enlarge the trade and hand- ling lines which the old firm did not. Mr. Butler was once employed in a city dry- goods house, and later was salesman with Coffin & Lyon, who failed in 1877, after which he purchased the store fixtures and a portion of the stock from assignee, giving notes for $5,000 for a loan for Mrs. Cofl^n. He carried on business in his own name for a time pend- ing a settlement of the affairs of Coffin & Lyon, after the consummation of which the firm of Coffin & Butler was formed, about January i, 1880, succeeding E. Butler, Jr., Mr. Butler re- turning notes for about $5,000 to Mrs. Coffin. This firm-name was continued until the forma- tion of the present firm, ist inst. Mr. Butler is a young man, estimated worth individually $5,000, and is believed to be a hard worker, good salesman, rather cautious in credit and a close liver ; is a brother of Frederick Butler, of EST BlLOTTIMGr MANiLLA.^^ § » o o- IH » s c * * E 2. \" « » ^ s o 3! 3 o The Standard and Best Double ManlUa for Tags, Boxes and Drafting. 0 n •a Facsimile of a Bundle of Rdsbell's Blotting.

His father is employed in a city bank. Mr. Miles is about thirty-eight years old, was formerly of Johnson & Miles, who dissolved partnership in 1878. He con- tinued in the same line, in which he has been many years since the dissolution ; has been alone ; is a nephew of Robert Martin, of West- port, Conn., who is reported wealthy, and who, it is understood, loaned Miles $15,000 cash, to be put into the business. It is believed he had about $5,000 of his own means, all invested in a book publishing business, and is deemed honorable, capable and industrious, with a very fair business ability.\" On April 11, 1883, the following report was furnished the Mercan- tile Agency over the signature of the firm : \" The $15,000 referred to in your report as being loaned to our Mr. Miles by Mr. Robert Martin is an entirely personal matter, and not in any manner connected with or in any way a lien or obligation on our business. In addi- tion, Mr. Miles is at present realizing from his old outstandings not less than $1,000 or $1,500 per month, and will continue to do so for a year or longer until it is wound up. Mr. But- ler contributed an equal amount, and we esti- mate our capital at $30,000.\" The Mercantile Agency made the following report of the firm on January 15 of the present year : \" Formed March i, 1883, with a capital of about $30,000; have done a very fair trade, and it is believed have added a little to their means. Are both economical and hard workers ; deemed honest, and were credited here, have met engagements as agreed.\" D. & W. Pemble's strawboard mill at Still- water, N. Y., was destroyed by fire on Sunday morning, and forty tons of strawboards were consumed, together with the house of Joseph Mulls. The loss on the mill is $30,000, and on the house $3,000. Insurance only on the latter. Among the occupants of the building, num- bered I, 3 and 5 on Catharine street, and i and 3^ on Division St., which was burned out at an early hour on Monday morning, was A. S. Stein, printer, whose loss was $800 ; insured for $500. The printing office of Dick & Stecker, at No. 252 Mercer street, New York, was dam- aged $1,000 by fire Saturday night. The build- ing was damaged $300. The Star Publishing Company, San Fran- cisco, Cal., has suspended publication. Trifling damage was done by fire on Friday night to Frank D. Hermann's printing office at No. 18 Jacob street. New York. Billings & Morrison, manufacturers of straw boards and paper at Appleton, Wis., have made an assignment. Their liabilities are re- ported at $50,000 and assets $40,000. They have been in business ten years. A fire broke out on June 27 in the building No. 12 Pennsylvania avenue, Baltimore, Md., occupied by Charles F. Miller as a paper-box factory. The fire is supposed to have been occasioned by the spontaneous combustion of a lot of glazed paper. Both the stock and machinery were partially destroyed, and the damage to each was about $1,500. The in- surance amounts to $5,000. A fire broke out on Sunday morning in Howard S. Ingersoll's rubber type manufactory, on the fourth floor of No. 155 Fulton street. It soon spread to the fourth floor of No. 153 Ful- ton street. In half an hour the flames were out, but the following damage had been done by fire, smoke and water : Howard S. Ingersoll, $3,000 ; the Protection Ventilator Company, $2,000 ; Austin & Magill, blank-books, $1,000; E. D. Slater, printer, $1,000 ; J. J. Whiteway, printer, $500, and Stearns & Beale, stationers, $2,500. The buildings were damaged $2,500. A fire broke out in the upper rag-room of the main building of the No. i Mill of J. B. Sheffield & Son, Saugerties, N. Y., at about 1:30 o'clock on Saturday morning last, causing a loss of about $10,000. The watchman's clock showed a visit to the rag-room at 12:15, and, as he was about to start on his r o'clock round, he heard a sound like an explosion and a flash of light. Two men from the engine-room went with him to the rag-loft where the rags are first dusted and where about 150 bales of rags are kept for immediate use. They found that a bale of rags was burning furiously near one end of the loft. The fire attained such head- way that the use of water-pails was insuflScient. They immediately applied the hose and turned on the sprinklers connected with the main fire- pump, and completely submerged the floor, but the fire had gained headway into the peaked roof above the sprinklers. The fire department of the village was then on hand, and with its help the fire was confined to the roof and attic alone. The rag duster and line of shafting was the only machinery destroyed, and about 160 bales of rags were more or less damaged by fire and water. The main build- ing was 150 feet long by 42 feet wide and was built in 1872. The mills are all covered by insurance in the Mutual Insurance companies of Boston, Providence and Worcester. Work was resumed in the No. 2 Mill and the finish- ing department of the No. i Mill on Monday morning, and there is sufficient stock in the drainers to keep the mill in full operation till the rag-room is sufficiently repaired to resume work. The sprinkler system, as introduced by the Mutual Insurance Companies, proved to be of the greatest value. They were the origi- nal perforated pipes and not the automatic kind as used in the more recently built No. 2 Mill. It is believed that with a plank roof such as is now recommended and with auto- matic sprinklers such a fire would be confined to a very small space. William A. Christian and James H. Chris- tian, composing the firm of Christian & Brother, manufacturers of baby carriages at No. 38 Ainslie street, Brooklyn, filed an as- signment on Monday to W. H. Hamilton, giving preferences for $1,150. They had a capital of about $20,000, which was left them by their father.

It is only to immerse the yellowed print in a dilute solution of bichloride of mercury until all the yellowness disappears. It is then well washed in water to remove the mercurial salt. If the print be a mounted one, it is by no means necessary to unmount it previously to treatment. All that is required in this case is to keep it in intimate contact for a time with blotting paper charged with the bichloride ; in- deed, this is the plan originally suggested by Mr. Barnes. By the bichloride treatment no lost detail is actually restored, as some have imagined. It is simply that the sickly yellow color which, as it were, buried the delicate half-tints, or what remains of them, is re- moved, and thus renders the picture bright and clear. Pictures which have been treated with the mercury always possess a much warmer tone than they did originally, as the purple or black tones give way to a reddish brown or reddish purple — more or less bright, accord- ing, probably, as gold or sulphur had been the principal toning agent. Here a question very naturally arises with regard to the future per- manence of pictures which have been thus \"restored,\" seeing that negatives intensified with mercury or transparencies toned with it are so prone to change. In answer to this we may mention that they appear to be perma- nent— at least that is our experience with some that have been done for many years. There appears to be no further loss of detail, and the whites retain their purity. Indeed, since un-; dergoing the treatment With mercury, no al- teration IS yet perceptible. — Br. Jour, of Photo. A meeting of the representative lithographic card men, and also the employees of T. Sin- clair & Son, took place on June 28 at 212 North Fourth street. The object of this meet- ing was to express regret at the. retirement of George M. Hayes from the management of the business of T. Sinclair & Son. Mr. Hayes, who is now the partner of Mr. Baker, has done a great deal to improve the card business, and the trade desired to make some recognition of this, and while regretting his departure from the firm of T. Sinclair & Son, hope that he will be successful in his new enterprise. Leon Myers, of Baltimore, made a very appropriate speech, in the course of which he presented Mr. Hayes with a handsome gold watch as a gift from some of the leading firms in the card trade in this country. Mr. Hayes was much moved, for the presentation was unexpected, and he returned thanks for the handsome present. C. M. Cooledge, well known under the pseudonym of \" Kash,\" wrote a very funny letter, illustrated with humorous designs, and excusing himself for not attending the re- ception. W. W. Denslow, a well known artist of Philadelphia, presented the new firm of Baker & Hayes with the design of a set of cards which, when published, will be found to be very amusing, and which it is expected will be a iuccess. The first order (and a large one) was given to the new firm of Baker & Hayes by a member of one of the largest firms in the trade, who was present at the meeting. ESTABLISHED 1830. ESTABLISHED 183('.

Price, fifty cents. Readers of this paper who avail themselves of the information obtained from its columns, by advertise- ment or otherwise, are rcgilcsted to notify their cor- respondents of the source ol their information TnK Secretary of the American Paper Manufacturers' Association has sent out the call for the annual meeting of that body on July 30 at Saratoga. What the association may have to do and what it may do are uncertain quantities, although the notification suggests that important matters will be up for consideration. The paper-makers' organization, if effectively worked, ought to be able to do a good deal in stimulating an export trade in the line of its products. We have already referred to the gratifying increase of our trade in paper and stationery with Mex- ico, and we would like to see it further extended. But we do not advise that a hazard should be made of this business to the extent of forcing goods upon the market of the neighboring republic. While we ought to and can sell much more, business management and judg- ment are essential in prosecuting this trade. The act of Congress for \" removing certain burdens from shipping\" has gone into operation. This law affects vessels entering American ports, reducing the tonnage tax and abolishing hospital fees. The act provides that in lieu of the tax on tonnage of 30 cents a ton per annum heretofore imposed, a duty of 3 cents a ton — not to exceed in the aggregate 15 cents a ton in any one year — shall be im- posed at each entry on all vessels which shall be entered in any port of the United States from any foreign port or place in North America, Central America, West Indies, Bahama, Bermuda, or Sandwich Islands or Newfoundland. A duty of 6 cents a ton, not to exceed 30 cents per ton per annum, is to be imposed at each entry upon all vessels which shall be en- tered in United States ports from any other foreign ports. What the operation of this change may prove to be remains to be seen. It is apparent that some benefit will accrue to the shipping inter- ests. Will it be of commercial advantage otherwise } What with warm weather and the pros- pect of a broken week, there has been very little disposition for the past few days to push business. And it is just as well ; the relaxation of a few days' respite from trade will not be disadvantageous. But it mu.st not be supposed that this summer holiday time is indicative of the abandonment of enterprise or of loss of confidence in the future. There are too many preparations extant to permit this opinion. We have had surprise more than once lately to note the extension of business undertakings in lines connected with the stationery trade, and if the mar- ket seems to be dull, we are quite sure that there are many who do not expect it to continue long in that condition. When we are through with the excitements and turmoil of political contest, what shall prevent the general rehabilitation of trade.' Nothing that we can see. The earth promises her abundance, and if the valleys \"laugh and sing\" and the hill tops \" drop down their fatness,\" what shall withstand the inevitable demand for more from all sources and from all kinds of people? It does not seem pos- sible that there shall be any financial trouble which may afTect general trade injuriously.. There has probably been too much caution exercised for that. Roundabouts. By the Tk.\\i)F. Lounger. \" When in the course \" of a man's trav- els about town he finds a general expression of warmth and fervid remarks upon the weath- er, it may reasonably be concluded that there is some occasion for heat. So there is just now. It is July, and the summer days are well upon us. * * * * \" All men are \" not alike, however, and while to some the sunny days and parching atmosphere are particularly aggravating, it is not unusual to find some who enjoy the heated atmosphere. .^. ^ ^ ^ \" Endowed with certain \" peculiarities of temperament and physical distinctions, the enviable few who do not call it warm and who protest that the weather is delicious, are just the kind who ought to celebrate the \" Foufth of July.\" * * # # The \"Lounger\" has got down to this point by easy degrees, for he didn't want to precipitate the announcement too suddenly. The \" ever glorious \" is close at hand and the pyrotechnical small boy has been making his customary racket ahead of time. I am sorry to observe a decadence of the celebration of the \"Fourth\" in New York and adjacent cities. Perhaps this is due to the fact that the large foreign population doesn't \" enthuse \" as it ought. We should not let the day go un- honored. * * -jt * And the closing-up movement for Sat urday has taken right hold of the business pub- lic. There will be very little trading done here for the next two or three days and recreation will be sought and enjoyed by all. The antici- pation seems to have affected people somewhat, for nobody seems to be anxious to do much business, or to talk much about business. A few notes of interest have been secured, how- ever, and I herewith present them. * * * * Brass picture frames are going to be quite as popular this season as last. They are not entirely novel, of course, but some of this season's styles of decoration are new and very pretty. The finest goods of this sort are im- ported, it seems, and there has been a great reduction in price. Plush picture frames will also be in demand. They come in many new designs as well as odd shapes. » * * * July 3. 1884.] THE AMEEICAI^ STATIOl^EE. i According to a statement in a daily paper, there is a demand for the coinage of half cents, which, it is said, would be useful in the toy, candy, and other small retail trades. Some persons may not see the wisdom of this de- mand, but they should remember that in France the smallest coin is one-fifth of a cent. * * * * A very neat and handy coin-holder for ladies' use has lately appeared on the market. It is of cylindrical form, and the coins are placed in either end and held securely by a spring which presses the coin against a small lip. Attached to the holder is a chain by means of which it may be fastened to the button-hole. * * * * Quite a display of campaign portraits is being made. One Broadway dealer in these goods has Blaine, Logan and Ben. Butler ranged in a row in his show-window, with the latter in the centre, underneath a placard bear- ing the inscription ; \" Some day, who knows ? \" * * * * A New York firm has. brought out a very neat, simple pencil-holder, which con- sists of a ring which slides on the pencil, and a projecting hook by means of which the pen- cil is secured to the edge of the pocket. The article is made of. German-silver. * * * * The latest thing out in toys is the me- chanical crocodile and the steam engine, both of which are cheap tin toys having a mechani- cal movement. .jj. ^j * .j;. The Government has been giving out a few stationery contracts. Arnold's writing fluid is put in at $3.93 per dozen quarts. Isn't this under cost price? Blotting, 120 lbs., is put in at $I3.2I@I4.32 per ream. Envelopes, too, seem to be going in at low prices. These are only two or three of the items. The list is too long and diversified to go over it com- pletely. If anybody wants to know the prices paid' by Government on any special line, per haps by asking The Stationer they can ^et the desired information. Life is too short and the Fourth of July too near for me to spread the news in full. Obituary. Richard B. Van Alstyne. Richard B. Van Alstyne, of the Troy Paper Company, died on June 25, after an illness of only a few days, and the announcement of his death created the greatest surprise among his friends, who were not even aware that he was ill. He was about 46 years old, and had for many years been engaged in business at Troy, N. Y., and was regarded with high es- teem by the business community generally. During the late war he served with distinction in the 169th and 44th regiments, and at the time of his demise was an honored member of Post Griswold. His funeral took place on Fri- day afternoon, June 27, from his late resi- dence. No. 7 Waverly place. The religious services were performed by the Rev. H. C. Farrar, assisted by the Rev. M. B. Mead, of Waterford, and the Rev. Willard Hitchcock, of Chatham Centre. The members of Post Griswold attended -in carriages, and a large number of personal friends were present. The floral offerings were profuse. A broken col- umn, the gift of Post Griswold, stood at the foot of the casket, while other floral gifts were strewn about it. The bearers were : Shepard Tappen ; H. S. Bingham, of Bennington, Vt. ; Haines D. Cunningham, of the New York Evening Post ; J. N. Smith, John C. Ide, E. W. Simpson, D. M. Ranken and P. M. Wales, the last two being members of Post Griswold. At the conclusion of the funeral service the re- mains were borne to Oakwood Cemetery, where interment was had. The deceased leaves a wife and one child. C. A. Rodney, president of the Vulcanized Fibre Company, Wilmington, Del., is dead. Charles E. Griswold, publisher, Dell Rapids, Dak., is dead.

Added to this will be heavy Treasury disbursements on account of called bonds ; so that the prospects are still toward abundant money, although the period is approaching when there is usually a more active inquiry for funds. The stock market was at prices frequently higher than last week, but at the close a decline set in, and the bulk of the advance was lost. Government bonds were strong. The railroad bond market was moderately ac- tive and irregular. The market for sterling was quiet but fully steady, posted rates having been advanced by certain leading drawers. Commercial bills were in rather better supply. TBE PAPER MARKET.—The leading man ufacturers continue to report a steady and quiet trade. Some of them give a rather discouraging ac count of the present condition of their industry, bu entertain the hope that, after the summer months have passed, the fall trade will develop more activity. Con- sidering the general dullness existing in all lines of business at this time, there is really no great cause for complaint in the paper trade. The circulation of news- papers generally is increasing, and although the book- publishers are not as busy as they have been at this time in former years, the lead ing houses are said to be handling quite a good many manuscripts, while some of them assert that they are doing fully as much as at any corresponding time. Manufacturers of some kinds of paper assert that the prices offered are really below cost ; overproduction is complained of, and the jobbing houses, they say, are selling on margins which, in some cases, do not justify a continuation of manufacturing; but it seems that there is no escape from this condition of things, because of the inability to get the trade to come together and restrict the production to within wise limits. Notwithstanding this, manufacturers are not, in a few instances, increasing their capacity, taking out old machinery and putting in new ; building extensions and preparing to meet an improved demand, as if an improvement was doubly assured. Collections are said to be rather slow, and prudent people are only purchas- ing what they need for early requirements. Super- calendered paper is being sold at the mill at 7^^c., print at 5!<^c., No. I manillas at 6Jic. and other grades in pro- portion. These prices even do not seem to offer much inducement to consumers to buy ahead, most of them appearing utterly indifferent, feeling safe in waiting and buying supplies as they are actually needed. THE STATIONERY MARKET.— Trade has made little if any progress this week. The near ap- proach of a national holiday has not improved matters much. This condition of affairs is expected to con- tinue until after the loth or 12th of the month, when, as usual at that period, there will probably be a bright- ening up in most lines of staple goods. Reports from the West and South indicate that the crops are in good condition, and this augers well for a good fall trade. There continued to be a fair degree of activity in Fourth of July goods during the week, and prices re- mained firm. Many dealers complained of a scarcity of goods, but there was no attempt to bull the market, as all were glad to get rid of what goods they had ; hence few if any will have any stock to carry over. The trade in campaign goods continues brisk. There is a greater variety of these goods on the market this season than in any previous year, and a proper assort- ment will not be likely to prove a bad investment to any dealer in stationery. There is quite a demand for fancy plush goods, but mostly for those of a staple character. A few orders for September delivery have been taken for plush novelties, but trade in these goods has not made any headway eis yet. 18 THE AMERICAN STATIONER EDWARD POSEN L CO., - MANUKACrrUKEltS OF- OFFENBACHON MAIN, (GERMANY), (USTAHLISUEU 1838), Beg lo inToi'm ihe Trade that they have opened a Branch House at No. 437 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, KOR THE SVLE OF THEIR WELL-KNOWN MAKE OF ALBUMS AND LEATHER GOODS.

IV. \" Heraldry viewed from a peculiar point,\" said John W. Weston, with whom the readers of Tmk Stationer became acquainted in the initial number of the article on this sub- ject, \" is often of vast importance, for while great estates and fortunes lie unclaimed, her- aldry sometimes comes in, and like a magic wand restores lands, titles and fortunes to per- sons who may have a right to them by in- heritance but who may be in poverty and obscurity. It is a common thing for a silver refiner to have brought to him a quantity of old plate — a relic, for instance, of some family of noble origin — say, for convenience' sake, a set of old spoons. These he weighs, and sees no other feature in them than their intrinsic value as so much silver. But let a connoisseur in heraldry come along — one gifted in heraldic lore, or a lawyer whose business it is to restore property in chancery, and the first thing he will notice in the battered spoons is the crest upon their handles. On seeing this he at once inquires, ' Whose crest is it ? ' and his mind is relieved at having found a name to a certain list of unclaimed estates, perhaps the name of the person to whom the spoons belonged and one of the names on his list of unclaimed es- tates or fortunes tallying. He thinks that he has obtained a key, seeks the owner of the old spoons, inquires into his pedigree, and it is not infrequently the case that a little incident like this will be the means of restoring property or fortunes to their rightful owners, especially in this country, inasmuch as persons of respectability or high family connections have immigrated to this country, where they have married, had families and died, without any hope or thought of ever possessing ancestral wealth or title ; and thus the old piece of plate is stopped from going into the melting-pot, and the owner commences to re- trace his pedigree and is able to prove that four or five generations back the same spoon belonged to a person of wealth and power and estate, whose vast worldly possessions and prestige had long lain unclaimed for want of proper proofs to establish their ownership. The spoon, it may be, becomes the subject of litigation, and perhaps the only family relic remaining is taken into court and there becomes a bona fide stepping-stone to wealth. Hence any old relic bearing the insigna of the family should be carefully pre- served. There are a great many such relics in the country. They turn up all over. This morning I had a gentleman in my office claim- ing to be an immediate descendant of Sir Hugh Nicholas, an old English aristocrat. The aris- tocratic ()opulation of the old countries is so completely interwoven with the people of other countries, that in the long series of generations which have intervened since the time of the ancestors from whom the title of nobility has descended, all trace of nobility lineage is lost. In many cases, those of noble descent belong to the lowest walks of life, some are pursuing various kinds of business, some the trades and professions. Down in Wall street I know a broker who is a German count. Another ex- July 3. 1884. THE AMERICA]^ STATIOJSTER 19 ample is that of the late Professor'Groschel, of Brooklyn, who founded the Conservatory of Music in this country. He was very much in- terested in heraldry and his ancestry rated high. Many persons of noble descent in this country are political refugees. They flee to this country, and in the course of time, their family failing to discover their whereabouts, they die in obscurity.\" \" Do you have much old plate brought to you for the purpose of tracing heraldic bear- ings ? \" the reporter asked. \" No ; I sometimes receive parchments for examination. They sometimes bear the coat- of-arms emblazoned, that is, fully set forth in colors, and sometimes the coat-of-arms is de- scribed in writing.\" ■' Do people have as great a desire to dis- cover their coat-of-arms as they used to?\" '■ Oh yes ; there seems to be an increasing tendency to use the family crest upon plate, carriages and articles of jewelry among those who inherit them, be they high or low.\" R.
