        "text": "“To you, James Boswell, Ugo Foscolo liberally gave [this book], so that the memory of a happy and grateful soul may never leave you“\n\nThis is the dedication, translated from the original in Latin and Greek, by Ugo Foscolo (1778-1827) one of the key Italian writers of the Romantic movement, on the first page of a copy of his Hypercalypseos, in May 1818.\n\nAn obscure and cryptic satire in Latin, the Hypercalypseos liber singularis is a true witness of one of the most troubled times in Foscolo’s life. Written in 1810, when the author was living in Milan, it was meant as “a satire against the learned men of Italy who, being willing to sell their knowledge and, ultimately, the truth, have ruined the literary fame of the whole Country.”[1]\n\nThe anger that Foscolo channelled in this particular work stemmed from the political situation of Northern Italy at the beginning of the 19th century, when Lombardy and the Republic of Venice, after a brief Napoleonic spell, had lost their sought-after independence to the Austrian Empire. Foscolo was already a renowned author by then: the Austrian authorities endeavoured to control him by offering him the direction of a periodical, upon the condition that he swore an oath of submission to the Empire. Foscolo, on the contrary, decided to flee. On the night of the 30th March 1815, he travelled to Switzerland with the manuscript of the Hypercalypseos and just a few belongings and, famously, without his coat, to arrive in Zurich the following day.\n\nHypercalypseos was published by Orelli, Füssli & co. in 1816, under the pseudonym ‘Didimus Clericus’, and with a false imprint (Pisa, In Aedibus Sapientiae, 1815). The book was printed in two issues, one consisting of twelve copies, and the other of ninety-two copies. In the first issue the author revealed his name, and added a commentary to the text, titled Clavis Hypercalypseos, explaining the meaning behind some names and stories readers wouldn’t otherwise be able to identify. The Wren Library copy, which is part of the Crewe Collection, doesn’t include the Clavis, and therefore belongs to the “ninety-two issue”. Foscolo took it with him when moving to London in September 1816.\n\nInitially Foscolo enjoyed the opportunities London had to offer; preceded by his literary fame, he had arrived as part of the big wave of exiled fighters from the Continent, whose political and military efforts had been quashed by the restoration after the hopes and turmoil of the Napoleonic years. [2] “Famous but penniless”, Foscolo was “warmly welcomed in Whig circles, and at Holland House he gained an entrée into polite society which led him to adopt a lifestyle beyond his means”.[3]\n\nHypercalypseos with its heartfelt inscription was given to James Boswell the younger (1778-1822), son of the famous biographer, diarist and lawyer James Boswell the elder (1740-1795) in 1818, but little is known of the connection between the two. To this date, scholars haven’t been able to establish a connection between Foscolo and Boswell other than the autograph dedication present in this book. [4]\n\nOne conjecture might point to the fact that Boswell was covering the role of Commissioner of Bankrupts: the mention of gratitude in the dedication might give us an inkling of the financial struggles Foscolo was already facing in the Spring of 1818.\n\nAnother hypothesis would be based on the strong involvement of the Boswell family with the cause of political exiles: James Boswell the elder had been a long-standing friend of Pasquale Paoli, who had fled Corsica in 1769 and had become “a European cause célèbre”.[5] Boswell the elder had supported him during his London years, and had published Paoli’s Memoirs, as well as a biography in his Account of Corsica. Foscolo, who followed the same path as Paoli nearly fifty years later, was likely to feel a connection with a family who had been so supportive of the cause of political exiles coming from the Continent, and would treasure a friendship with Boswell, the younger. [6]\n\nThe book was eventually part of the auction sale of Boswell’s library in 1825. Richard Monckton Milnes, who gathered the core of the Crewe Collection, acquired it later, probably at some point in the late 1840s-early 1850s. Milnes had an interest in both Boswell and Foscolo: the former due to him coming into possession, in 1849, of the Boswelliana, a group of manuscripts that had accidentally been included in the 1825 sale, and that he partially published in 1856 (the Wren Library owns a copy of the 1856 edition). His interest in the latter most likely arose after a journey he had made to Italy in the early 1830s, where he became acquainted with the works of Foscolo probably through a connection with Isabella Teotochi Albrizzi, one of the most brilliant social and literary personalities of the time, who had also been Foscolo’s lover many years earlier. This copy of the Hypercalypseos, the only witness of a link between Boswell and Foscolo, would have been a perfect addition to Milnes’s book collection.\n\nThrough this book and its history, we gain a glimpse of Foscolo in his early London years as an author who, among the first ones of his time, embodied the ideal of the Romantic writer as someone who must be ready to live perilously in order to maintain his intellectual independence. Foscolo would fight until the end against political pressures, tyranny, and indifference; the latter being probably the worst sin for someone who dedicated his life to his ideals, and lived for them, true to his convictions until his death in poverty, at the age of 49 in London; after a life full of adventures, misfortunes, military battles, political passions, and literary success.\n\nThis blog was written by Maria Giovanna De Simone, Rare Books Cataloguer at Trinity College\n\n[1] In Foscolo’s own words: “L’Hypercalypsios è una satira contro gli uomini dotti d’Italia, i quali, il sapere e la verità mercanteggiando, corruppero le lettere di questo popolo” – see Gemelli, C., Della vita e delle opere di U. Foscolo, Bologna, Zanichelli, 1881, p. 171-172.\n\n[2] Petrusewicz, M., Risorgimento in Exile: Italian Émigrés and the Liberal International in the Post-Napoleonic Era. By Maurizio Isabella.
