        "text": "A look at history: the new “Gardens of eternity”\n\nThe late XVIII century was a rather tough period for Genoa that was in the midst of the war which opposed the Napoleonic troops on one side to the English and Austrian troops on the other one: hunger and disease had caused the death of many citizens, buried in mass graves or inside churches. In 1801 the Committee for the Public Health of the city of Genoa sent a report on the subject of burials to the National Institute of Paris, highlighting the need to find a solution to the problem of burying the dead in proper areas.\n\nThe debate on burials spread especially with the Edict of Saint-Cloud (June 12, 1804) which prohibited burials inside religious buildings and city walls: cemeteries should have been placed in open and sunny places far from inhabited areas. The Edict also stipulated that the tombs had to be anonymous to avoid discrimination: only the gravestones of illustrious citizens could carry an epitaph with the consent of a commission of magistrates.\n\nVisits to the dead were definitely prohibited. As the Genoese citizen Mongiardino had written in the report sent to France three years before the Napoleonic Edict: “The cemetery door will never be opened, except on the occasion of the burial of the dead or by order of the established authorities. The key will be enshrined by the Municipality“.\n\nGenoa was annexed to France in June 1805 and Napoleon visited the city with his wife Giuseppina at the end of the month. The Edict of Saint-Cloud also became law here. In 1806 an architect named Tagliafichi presented the project of a new city cemetery out of the city walls. The era of the new “gardens of eternity” had begun.\n\nSource: The silent city, the monumental cemetery of Staglieno, Anselmo Orsi, De Ferrari Editore\n\nThe cemetery of Staglieno\n\nThe project presented by Mr. Tagliafichi in 1806 for the construction of a cemetery in an area close to the coast was never carried out and the controversy about the conditions of the cemeteries in Genoa continued without reaching important conclusions for some more years. Meanwhile, Napoleon’s Empire was disrupted and the Congress of Vienna in 1815 ordered the annexation of Genoa to the Kingdom of Sardinia. The Royal Patents of May 26th, 1832 resumed the laws issued by the Edict of Saint-Cloud, enforcing the cessation of burials in churches and promoting the construction of new cemeteries in places far from inhabited areas.\n\nIn 1833, Carlo Barabino, a very popular architect at the time, presented a project for the construction of a cemetery in the area of S. Agata or near the church of San Francesco da Paola. But the General Council of Genoa was unable to find a proper place there and Mr Barabino was forced to look beyond the city walls. Finally, a large hilly area was identified on the right bank of the Bisagno stream, in the borough called Staglieno. In 1835 the Senate of Genoa gave its consent and, despite protests from local inhabitants, the construction of the cemetery, later labelled as one of the wonders of the world, started.\n\nArchitect Barabino was hit by the cholera epidemic that plagued Genoa in 1835 and he died without being able to complete the work. His pupil Giovanni Battista Resasco took his place and the works for the construction of the world famous Monumental Cemetery of Staglieno finally started on April 8th, 1846.\n\nThe debate on the tombs\n\nThe Edict of Saint-Cloud of 1804 (extended to Italy in 1806) enforced rules related to burials that resulted from the typical materialism of the Enlightenment which did not foresee a life beyond death. The end of life was considered to be definitive, therefore any form of devotion linked to the tomb, intended as a place of memory, was seen as useless: the dead could be remembered in private homes, without the need to go to the cemetery. Furthermore, the egalitarian spirit typical of the Jacobin thought sanctioned that social distinction should not be made even after death: all the tombs had to be identical.\n\nThe harshness of these rules which made the separation from the departed ones even more definitive than death itself, aroused a great debate that saw poet Ugo Foscolo as a great protagonist in Italy. In the literary living room of Dame Isabella Teotochi Albrizzi, Foscolo started a dispute with the his his fellow poet Ippolito Pindemonte, champion of Christian values. This debate later gave him inspiration for his poem Dei Sepolcri in which he finally admitted that the tombs were necessary to relieve the pain and sorrow of those who had lost a loved one.\n\nFoscolo was also inspired by the contemporary English Graveyard poets, such as Edward Young and Thomas Gray, author of the famous Elegy written in a country cemetery.\n\nMurta cemetery\n\nEven the villages of the outback had to comply with the rules imposed by the Royal Patents of 1832, ceasing to bury the dead in churches or in areas too close to them.\n\nIn the same years in which the government of Genoa was looking for the right location to build the new city graveyard, the people of Murta chose an area called Fontanasse for the construction of the cemetery. The initial project was, however, abandoned due to the presence in that area of many water sources that could have been contaminated by the burials. After further inspections, it was decided to build the graveyard “at the far edge of the parish villa”. The cemetery area was delimited by walls and a mortuary chapel and an ossuary were built over time.\n\nMurta cemetery was blessed on September 4th,1835, but the first grave had already been dug in August for a young victim of the cholera epidemic that caused the death of many Genoese in the same year. According to the historian Luigi Persoglio, on average 35 people were buried every year since then and in 1873 there had already been 1332 burials.\n\nThe newest tombs that we found in the cemetery date back to the 90s and today the graveyard is considered dismissed.\n\nBetween the date of the last burials and the moment of our recovery project, which began in January 2019, the cemetery saw a long period of abandonment during which vegetation was left free to thrive. There have been episodes of profanation by vandals which have irreparably ruined many tombs without erasing the ancient and romantic charm of our small “garden of eternity”."
