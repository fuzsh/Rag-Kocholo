MAP OF Byrons Greece VOL. i pp. xxviii-xxix BYRON : A Biography VOLUME III CHAPTER XXIV 1821-1822 Pisa BYRON was well pleased with the palace chosen for him, and soon also with the company which Shelley had gathered about him. The Casa Lanfranchi was lighter and less gloomy than the palace of the Guicciolis which he had occupied in Ra- venna. The winter climate of Pisa was a relief, too, after the snows and slush of the Romagna, Sheltered by hills from the tra- montane winds, Pisa enjoyed a truly Mediterranean mildness more like the winters he had enjoyed in Greece. The garden was small but pleasant, sunny, and private, and surrounded by high walls. He had only to descend the wide steps to the ground floor and go through a back door to enter it. A few days after his ar- rival he wrote to Moore: \"At present, owing to the climate, etc. (I can walk down into my garden, and pluck my own oranges, — and, by the way, have got a diarrhoea in consequence of in- dulging in this meridian luxury of proprietorship,) my spirits are much better.\" w The only thing he had to complain of was the noise of the main highway that ran in front of the house along the Arno. After the first month, he wrote Murray: '1 have got here into a famous old feudal palazzo, on the Arno* . . \" The house be- longed to the Lanfranchi family, (the same mentioned by Ugo- lino in his dream, as his persecutor with Sismondi,) and has had a fierce owner or two in its time. The staircase, etc., is said to have been built by Michel Agnolo [sic]. It is not yet cold enough for a fire. What a climate!\" n 944 CHAPTER XXIV: 1821-1822 What lifted Byron's spirits more than the climate, however, was the fact that he could settle into a congenial routine with pleasant companions once again. After his long isolation in the Italian society of Ravenna, to which he had been drawn by his passionate attachment to Teresa, he was glad to relax again in an English circle that looked up to him for his poetry and re- sponded to his wit and literary and worldly conversation. He had no taste for cultivating new Italian acquaintances. Teresa by her situation was effectively cut off from Italian society in this strange city, and saw only the few friends who had been exiled with her father and brother. The Gambas had been given per- mission by the Tuscan government for a residence of only two months, but by some mistake of the officials their passports were made out for four months.* Teresa visited only with Mary Shelley and Mary's friend Jane Williams, who befriended her before Byron arrived, and Shelley, for Byron's sake, was kind to her. As had been his custom in Ravenna before the exile, Byron paid his daily call on Teresa at the Casa Parr£, only a quarter of a mile up the Lungarno. The Shelleys had just returned to Pisa from the Baths at San Giuliano a few days before his arrival, and had furnished a flat at the top of the Tre Palazzi di Chiesa, a house facing the Arno on the opposite bank from the Casa Lanfranchi. Shelley s admi- ration for Byron's poetic genius was increased by his reading Cain, which he saw in manuscript shortly after Byron's arrival. Before long, Mary, always exhilarated by the presence of Byron, was writing to her friend Maria Gisborne: \"So Pisa, you see, has become a little nest of singing birds.\" n Shelley was also stimu- lated by the association. \"Lord Byron/' he wrote to Peacock some weeks later, \"is established now, and we are constant compan- ions. ... I get up, or at least wake early; read and write till two; dine — go to Lord B.'s, and ride, or play at Billiards as the weather permits, and sacrifize the evening either to light books or whoever happens to drop in.\" n Just then a good many people were dropping in on the Shel- leys, and Shelley had already introduced a number of them to Byron. Edward and Jane Williams, then their closest friends, PISA 94S had arrived in Pisa in January 1821, responding to the urgent invitation of Shelley's cousin Thomas Medwin, who had served with Williams in the Eighth Dragoons in India, and who had come to Italy the previous October to be near his talented cousin. Williams, a half -pay lieutenant with literary leanings and liberal sympathies, having run away with a fellow officer's wife, found it more congenial as well as cheaper to live abroad. In Italy no one raised eyebrows at the statement that they were Mr. and Mrs. Williams any more than at the assumed name of the Shel- leys' other close friends in Pisa, \"Mr. and Mrs. Mason,\" actually George William Tighe and Lady Mountcashell. The latter had left the Earl some eight years before, and was living with her common-law husband in Casa Silva. Shelley, who had found an ideal companion in the artistic and sensitive Williams, had prepared him for the arrival of Byron, lauding the poet's genius but warning his friend of \"the canker of aristocracy\" in the noble lord's character. Shelley had called on Byron the day after his arrival, and on November 5 took Wil- liams to see him. The latter was agreeably surprised: \"So far from his having a haughtiness of manner,\" he wrote in his jour- nal, \"they are those of the most unaffected and gentlemanly ease — and so far from his being (as is generally imagined) wrapt in a melancholy gloom he is all sunshine, and good humour with which the elegance of his language and the brilliancy of his wit cannot fail to inspire those who are near him.\" n The next day Byron accompanied Teresa and Pietro Gamba to the Shelleys'. This is the only recorded visit of Byron to the Shelley house, for most of the visiting was in the other direction. The Pisan circle rapidly switched to the Casa Lanfranchi, and it was almost entirely a masculine society. Teresa continued her daily rides with Mary and her visits, often with Pietro, to the Shelleys', and they and the Williamses returned the visits. But Byron saw Teresa only at her own house, though he sometimes met her and Mary while they were riding. Like a magnet, he drew Shelley and his friends into his own orbit of amusements and conversation. Williams was present during Byron's visit to the Shelleys', and recorded: \"Lord B. told us of a singular accu- 946 CHAPTER XXIV: 1821-1822 sation now brought against him, which is, that he has gained £500 by writing puffs for Day and Martin's blacking/' ' Byron had hoped to establish in his garden a range for his fa- vorite pastime of pistol-shooting. Soon after his arrival he applied for permission to do so to the Governor of Pisa, the Marquis Nicolo Viviani, father of Emilia Viviani, whom Shelley had wanted to save from her convent and who inspired his \"Epipsy- chidion.\" The Governor, who had dabbled in literature and had written a poem on \"Hero and Leander,\" sent a very polite re- fusal.*1 Within a few days after Byron's arrival in Pisa he had also drawn into his circle another friend of the Shelleys, an Irish ex- patriate who had been some years in Italy. John Taaffe, Jr., of an ancient Irish Catholic family, had been forced into exile by an unfortunate affair with a woman in Edinburgh. He landed in Italy in 1815 and had been there since. He formed a warm friendship in Genoa with Mme Regny, a charming and talented woman who had entree to society in Pisa, Lucca, and Florence, as well as to artistic and cultural circles, for she was a painter of some ability. Taaffe prided himself on his horsemanship, though he was not a good rider (he had been in charge of M. Regny's stables), and he devoted himself to scholarship and writing. When Taaffe met the Shelleys sometime late in 1820, he was already at work on a magnum opus, a Commentary on Dante which was to be pub- lished with his own translation of the Divine Comedy. He was still at work on it when he met Byron in November 1821, and was immediately hopeful that the famous poet, whom he had long known by reputation, would help him to get it published. Strangely enough, Byron took to him almost at once and fell in with his scheme so far as to recommend the Commentary to Murray.*1 Shortly after the middle of the month, Byron's circle was en- livened by the addition of another friend of Shelley. This was 1 Williams, p. no. Entry of Nov. 6, 1821. Byron added a note to The Two Foscari, published with Cain and Sardanapalus on December 11, 1821, con- cerning this fantastic accusation, concluding: 'This is the highest compliment to my literary powers which I ever received.\" (The Two Foscari, ist ed. P- PISA 947 Thomas Medwin, who, after being the constant companion of the Shelleys for some months, had left Pisa on February 27, 1821, and had just returned on November 14, perhaps with the spe- cific view of meeting through Shelley the renowned Lord Byron, who had the reputation of shunning his countrymen. Medwin was full of stories of India. He too had literary ambitions and had already published at Geneva the previous year Oswald and Edwin: an Oriental Sketch. He had read widely and was full of allusions, not always accurate. Mary had found him amusing at first, but his effervescing ego soon grew monotonous. But Byron accepted Medwin as he had Taaffe, with some slightly cynical reservations, as a companion who could furnish him with the worldly conversation that Shelley shunned, and particularly as one who deferred to him and served as a sound- ing-board for his own wit and reminiscence. Soon Medwin, like Taaffe and Williams, was almost a daily caller. Soon after the refusal of the Governor of Pisa to allow pistol- shooting in the garden, Byron had made his own arrangements with some friends of Dr. Vacc&, the Castinelli family, who re- sided outside the city walls. Thenceforth, almost every after- noon, when the weather permitted, Byron and his friends rode out to the Villa la Podera, \"an extensive enclosure attached to a picturesque farmhouse — part garden, part farm, part vineyard — situated in Cisanello, some two miles outside Pisa beyond the Porta alle Piagge, where they practised pistol-shooting at a tar- get.\" According to local tradition, part of the attraction of the farmhouse to Byron was the presence of Maria, a beautiful bru- nette peasant girl.n When Rogers accompanied Byron on his daily expedition to the villa in 1822, he observed that \"The farm- keeper's daughter was very pretty, and had her arms covered with bracelets, the gift of Byron, who did not fail to let me know that she was one of his many loves.\" w Both Teresa and Mary directed their rides and their walks very frequently toward the pistol-shooting party, sometimes join- ing it and sometimes meeting it on the way.n Teresa may, indeed, have seen the bracelets on the arms of the pretty peasant girl and been eager to check up on the proceedings at die farmhouse. And it was for Mary, strongly attracted by the intellect and 948 CHAPTER XXIV: 1821-1822 charm of Byron, almost the only opportunity to associate in this man's world, for which by temperament and intellectual procliv- ities she was eminently fitted. She remembered nostalgically their evenings together at the Villa Diodati, or in the boat on Lake Geneva, in the summer of 1816, and felt cut off from that pleasure now that Byron was surrounded by a masculine com- pany centered in the Casa Lanfranchi. There is a slight disap- pointment mingled with admiration for Byron in her letters of this time.2 Once he had established himself in the Palazzo Lanfranchi, Byron's dinners to his male friends (the ladies were never in- vited) were frequent. Taaffe, Medwin, Williams, and Shelley usually came, and all but Shelley frequently talked over their wine until two or three in the morning.*1 Shelley enjoyed the talk until it turned from literature and philosophical subjects to worldly matters, and then he generally withdrew. In January he told Horace Smith: \"Lord Byron unites us at a weekly dinner, when my nerves are generally shaken to pieces by sitting up con- templating the rest making themselves vats of claret, etc., till three o'clock in the morning.\" n Byron held to his resolution to limit his social activity to a small circle. The spy Torelli recorded with relish in his diary: \"Lord Byron sent to the Grand Duke Mis* Taff [sic] another Englishman, his friend, to beg him to excuse him [Byron] for not presenting himself at Court. . . . The Grand Duke laugh- ingly replied that he [Byron] could have dispensed with in- forming him of this since he had not sought him [Byron] out/' n Byron no doubt met, but never became intimate with, some of the Shelleys' other friends, such as Dr. Vacc£, whom he had 2 In her journal at a later time Mary tried to explain to herself \"why Alb&, by his mere presence and voice, has the power of exciting such deep and shifting emotions within me.\" (Mary Shelley's Journal, p. 184. Entry of Oct. 19, 1822,) Mary was probably not consciously aware, or could not admit to herself, how deeply attracted she was to Byron, both physically and by the subtle responses to his complementary personality. How could she, young, attractive, not free from the fire of passion, even with a Shelley at her side, be entirely oblivious to the charm that almost every other woman felt in the presence of Byron? (For an acute analysis of Mary Shelley's sub- conscious preoccupation with Byron, in her journals and her novels, see Lovell: \"Byron and Mary Shelley/') PISA 949 heard of through Dr. Polidori, and whom he respected highly as a surgeon. Prince Mavrocordatos, the Greek patriot who had given Greek lessons to Mary earlier in the year, had sailed on June 2,6 for his homeland to join in the battle for Greek freedom, but his cousin Prince Argiropoli remained in Pisa, and on No- vember 14, Shelley took him to see Byron, thereby kindling anew the latter's enthusiasm for the Greek cause.n Such an association would not have allayed the suspicions of the government con- cerning Byron's activities, and still less would any contact with the Shelleys' friend Professor Francesco Pacchiani, commonly known as 'The Devil of Pisa\" because of his eccentric irregulari- ties. On first hearing of Byron's imminent arrival in Pisa, the au- thorities had been alarmed for his influence on the students of the University, many of whom had displayed alarming radical tendencies and defiance of constituted authority .* From his first day at the Casa Lanfranchi, constant watch was kept on his house to see who came and went.\" But after a time the spy Torelli reported perforce: \"Milord led a very quiet and retired life: the only persons he visited, besides the Gambas and his English friends, were Madame Kemstein and her four daughters, and the Canon Danielle Girolami, priest of the church of San Pierino.\" * Before long, however, the government of Tuscany was con- cerned with something disturbing. The Royal Commissioner of Volterra, a few miles to the south of Pisa, wrote a private letter to the \"Buongoverno\" at Florence warning that \"some copies of the Prophecy of Dante, a poem by Lord Byron, have reached this city. It is most decidedly not written in the spirit of our Gov- ernment, or of any of the Italian Governments. To me it appears designed to augment popular agitation, already sufficiently aroused. Lord Byron makes Dante advocate democracy and the independence of Italy for the salvation and good of the coun- try.\"* If not completely oblivious to the fact that he was obnoxious to the government, Byron was indifferent to how they felt about him, for he had already weathered the displeasure of the govern- ment of the Romagna, where fanatics had even posted an affiche calling for his assassination. Comfortably adjusted to the pleas- 950 CHAPTER XXIV: 1821-1822 ant climate and companionship of Pisa, and finding conjugal sat- isfaction in the warm affections of his arnica, Byron was for a time more contented than he had been for many months. Certainly Byron made himself agreeable to the members of his new circle. Medwin, who had soon begun to take notes on his brilliant conversation, was immediately won over by the friendliness of the great poet who acted the host so graciously. Byron was aware that he was being \"Boswellized,\" but did not refrain from talking freely of his own life and affairs, though he sometimes found pleasure in pulling Medwin's leg.8 Medwin re- called: '\"There was something enchanting in his manner, his voice, his smile — a fascination in them; but on leaving him, I have often marvelled that I gained so little from him worth car- rying away; whilst every word of Shelley's was almost oracular; his reasoning subtle and profound; his opinions, whatever they were, sincere and undisguised; whilst with Byron, such was his love of mystification, it was impossible to know when he was in earnest.\" * And after he had known Byron for some time he recorded: \"I never met with any man who shines so much in conversation. He shines the more, perhaps, for not seeking to shine. His ideas flow without effort, without his having occasion to think. As in his letters, he is not nice about expressions or words; — there are no concealments in him, no injunctions to secrecy. He tells every thing that he has thought or done without the least reserve, and as if he wished the whole world to know it; and does not throw the slightest gloss over his errors. Brief himself, he is impatient of diffuseness in others, hates long stories, and seldom repeats his own. . . . \"He hates argument, and never argues for victory. He gives every one an opportunity of sharing in the conversation, and has the art of turning it to subjects that may bring out the person 8Trelawny, according to his own account, told Byron that Medwin was taking note of his conversation, but Byron was not deterred from talking to him on that account. When Trelawny mentioned his warning to the Shelleys, \"Mrs. Shelley, smiling said 'That won't restrain, it will stimulate Byron; he will blab the more/ \" (Trelawny: Records, p. so.) PISA 951 with whom he converses. He never shews the author, prides him- self most on being a man of the world and of fashion, and his anecdotes of life and living characters are inexhaustible. In spir- its, as in every thing else, he is ever in extremes.\" n Despite the fact that Shelley was sometimes annoyed by By- ron's flitting from subject to subject without arguing any point through, he too was drawn by the personality and brilliance of the man whose genius so overawed his own that for the first months of Byron's residence in Pisa the younger poet wrote but little. He had written from Ravenna in August: \"I despair of ri- valling Lord Byron, as well I may, and there is no other with whom it is worth contending.\" n And he later told Horace Smith: \"I do not write — I have lived too long near Lord Byron and the sun has extinguished the glow-worm. . . ?n He wrote to John Gisborne apropos of Cain: \"What think you of Lord Byron now? Space wondered less at the swift and fair creations of God, when he grew weary of vacancy, than I at the late works of this spirit of an angel in the mortal paradise of a decaying body. So I think — let the world envy while it admires, as it may/' n Even after he had begun to feel the strain of Byron's parties and wished he might gracefully withdraw from them, he continued to hold exaggerated views of the merits of Cain. Byron, in spite of his tendency to make sport of Shelley occa- sionally as he did with his other companions, had a genuine lik- ing for him and an admiration for his intellect and integrity. Teresa no doubt reflected something of Byron's own feeling about Shelley in the realistic but sympathetic picture she drew of him in her later recollections: \"He was very tall, but so bent that he seemed of ordinary height, and although his figure was so fragile, his bones and joints stood out too much, even grossly. And yet all these details, themselves unbeautiful, still formed an extremely sympathetic being — and really one must use the word being, for truly Shelley seemed rather Spirit than man. He was also extraordinary in his dress, for he generally wore a school- boy's jacket, never any gloves, and unpolished shoes — and yet, among a thousand gentlemen, he would always have seemed the most accomplished. His voice was high-pitched — even strident 952 CHAPTER XXIV: 1821-1822 — but nevertheless took on inflections, to suit his thoughts, of a grace, a softness and a delicacy which went straight to the heart\"* Byron's literary activity had not stopped on his arrival in Pisa, though Medwin later wondered how he could find time to write after being occupied all day with riding, shooting, dining, and visiting, and sitting up until three in the morning in animated conversation.*1 But he was more deeply engaged than ever in squabbles with Murray on the publication of Cain, about which the publisher was somewhat timid. To Murray's request that he recast certain lines in Cain which seemed impious, Byron re- plied: \"The two passages cannot be altered without making Lucifer talk like the Bishop of Lincoln. ... As to 'alarms/ etc., do you really think such filings ever led any body astray? Are these people more impious than Milton's Satan? or the Pro- metheus of ^Eschylus?\" * And he was wrought up by the treatment accorded Don Juan. Murray had acted as if it were unwanted at the same time that he had profited considerably from it. That Byron had reason for complaint there seems little doubt. Murray's biographer wrote: \"There was quite a rush for the work. The booksellers' messen- gers filled the street in front of the house in Albemarle Street, and the parcels of books were given out of the window in answer to their obstreperous demands.\" n Byron spoke plainly on the matter: \"You have played the stepmother to D[on] J[uan] throughout, either ashamed or afraid, or negligent, to your own loss and nobody's credit.\" * Byron was encouraged to wage his battle against the \"canters\" by the good opinion of his drama expressed by Kinnaird, Gif- ford, Scott, and Moore. Moore had written: \". . . Cain is won- derful—terrible— never to be forgotten. If I am not mistaken, it will sink deep into the world's heart; and while many will shud- der at its blasphemy, all must fall prostrate before its grandeur.\" n But on November 23, Byron received a letter from Hobhouse which disturbed him more than all the \"canting\" of Murray or other friends in England who had been fearful of the public re- action to Cain. Hobhouse, always protective of his friend's rep- utation, and from his experience in Parliament having developed PISA 953 a supersensitivity to public opinion, was genuinely frightened by what appeared to him to be a deliberate frontal attack on the most touchy area of prejudice and accepted belief of his coun- trymen.71 Byron's first impulse was to flare up in anger at Hob- house's effrontery, but within an hour he had cooled down suffi- ciently to write a restrained reply which showed only by under- tones how deeply the letter had hurt him. He was always at a disadvantage with Hobhouse because he knew he could find lit- tle sympathy for his high-flown romantic \"Childe Harold\" style in that quarter. In self-defense he parried by pretending that he persisted in the publication only for money. Byron showed Hobhouse's letter to the members of his Pisan circle also, to get their opinions and relieve his mind by discuss- ing it with them. Medwin quoted Byron as saying that Shelley had been most indignant, for he thought Cain the best thing Byron ever wrote. Byron continued: \"The Snake's41 rage has pre- vented my crest from rising.\" n But Byron's annoyance did not subside for several weeks, and for a time almost every letter to England made some reference to the episode. On November 28 he told Kinnaird that Hobhouse's letter was \"one of the grossest ever written in style and manner. Had it been by any but an old friend, I really think I must have, at the least, made such an answer, as would have produced a scene/' n In the meantime Byron was partly mollified by Murray, who had finally offered through Kinnaird twenty-five hundred guin- eas for the last three cantos of Don Juan and the three plays Sardanapalus, The Two Foscari, and Cain? which were pub- lished together on December ig.n Shortly after he arrived in Pisa, Byron had received from Au- gusta a lock of his daughter Ada's hair. He was again impelled to write to Lady Byron (though the letter was never sent). For that skeleton was always in his closet, more haunting than the 4 This is a title that Byron gave in jest to Shelley. In a letter to Moore he explained its origin: \"Shelley's allusion to his 'fellow-serpent/ is a buffoonery of mine. Goethe's Mephistofilus calls the serpent who tempted Eve 'my aunt, the renowned snake;' and I always insist that Shelley is nothing but one of her nephews, walking about on the tip of his tail.\" (LJ, V, 495-6« Undated, but probably about Dec. 13, 1821.) 954 CHAPTER XXIV: 1821-1822 ghosts in the Casa Lanfranchi. He thanked her for the lock, and continued: \"I also thank you for the inscription of the date and name, and I will tell you why; — I believe that they are the only two or three words of your hand-writing in my possession. For your letters I returned; and except the two words, or rather the one word, 'Household,' written twice in an old account book, I have no other. I burnt your last note, for two reasons: — firstly, it was written in a style not very agreeable; and, secondly, I wished to take your word without documents. . . . We both made a bitter mistake; but now it is over, and irrevocably so. \"I say all this, because I own to you, that, notwithstanding every thing, I considered our re-union as not impossible for more than a year after the separation; — but then I gave up the hope entirely and for ever. But this very impossibility of re-union seems to me at least a reason why, on all the few points of dis- cussion which can arise between us, we should preserve the courtesies of life, and as much of its kindness as people who are never to meet may preserve perhaps more easily than nearer connections/' n This was about the time that he met Medwin, and it was prob- ably then that he talked so freely to him about his marriage and separation, adding to the story a greater flippancy than he felt in order to hide the wound. Thoughts of Ada never failed to arouse melancholy reminiscences of the past in Byron. He wrote to Murray on her birthday, December 10: \"This day and this hour, (one, on the clock,) my daughter is six years old. I won- der when I shall see her again, or if ever I shall see her at all. I have remarked a curious coincidence, which almost looks like a fatality. My mother, my wife, my daughter, my half-sister, my sisters mother, my natural daughter (as far at least as I am con- cerned), and myself, are all only children. . . .5 \"I heard the other day from an English voyager, that her [Ada's] temper is said to be extremely violent. Is it so? It is not 5 This idea seemed to obsess Byron. He told Medwin the same thing (1, 116) , and he repeated it in a passage in his \"Detached Thoughts\" written after Ada's birthday, adding: \"Such a complication of only children, all tending to one family, is singular enough, and looks like fatality almost. But the fiercest Animals have the rarest numbers in their litters, as Lions, tigers, and even Elephants which are mild in comparison.\" (LJ9 V, 467.) PISA 955 unlikely considering her parentage. My temper is what it is — as you may perhaps divine, — and my Lady's was a nice little sul- len nucleus of concentrated Savageness to mould my daughter upon, — to say nothing of her two Grandmothers, both of whom, to my knowledge, were as pretty specimens of female Spirit as you might wish to see on a Summer's day.\" n Byron's pondering on fate and his relation to the mysteries of life and the unknown had been stimulated two days before by the receipt of a curious letter from an Englishman by the name of John Sheppard, a clothier of Frome, who was a writer of po- etry, books of travel, and pious works. Sheppard enclosed a copy of a prayer written by his deceased wife in the summer of 1814 at Hastings, where she had admired the agility of Byron on the rocks and no doubt heard stories of his wickedness. Without mentioning his name she prayed for the person \"who is now we fear as much distinguished for his neglect of Thee as for the transcendent talents Thou hast bestowed on him.\"n Byron was touched by the letter and its enclosure. With the politeness he always displayed toward men of faith when no hy- pocrisy was evident, he gave what consolation he could to the hopes of his pious correspondent without falsifying his own point of view with regard to matters which he considered wholly un- knowable. He concluded: \"But a man's creed does not depend upon himself: who can say, I will believe this, that, or the other? and least of all, that which he least can comprehend.\" n It is possible that Byron had imbibed from Shelley the idea that a man's belief does not depend upon his wilL But when By- ron doubted his own skepticism, as he did once in discussing his drama of Cain with Shelley, the latter exclaimed, according to Trelawny: \"I do believe, Mary, that he is little better than a Christian/' * According to Medwin, Byron once said: \"I have often wished I had been born a Catholic. That purgatory of theirs is a com- fortable doctrine; I wonder the reformers gave it up, or did not substitute something as consolatory in its room. It is an improve- ment on the transmigration, Shelley, which all your wiseacre philosophers taught. \"You believe in Plato's three principles; — why not in the Trin- 956 CHAPTER XXIV: 1821-1822 ity? One is not more mystical than the other. I don't know why I am considered an enemy to religion, and an unbeliever. . . . _ IJknow, however, that I am considered an infidel. My wife and sister, when they joined parties, sent me prayerbooks.\" n Byron's premonitions of gloom on his daughter's birthday seemed to him not altogether unfounded when he heard not long after that Dr. Polidori, his former physician, had taken his own life. He told Medwin: \"I was convinced something very unpleas- ant hung over me last night: I expected to hear that somebody I knew was dead; — so it turns out! Poor Polidori is gone! . . . he has prescribed a dose for himself that would have killed fifty Miltiades' \" n Whatever may have been Byron's reluctance to disturb ortho- dox religious beliefs, he was as quick as Shelley to protest against acts of bigotry or inhumanity committed in the name of any re- ligion. On December 12, Medwin was at the bookseller Moloni's in Pisa when he heard a report that \"a subject belonging to the Lucchese States had been taken up for sacrilege, and sentenced to be burnt alive.\" Medwin hastened to the Casa Lanfranchi with the news. On hearing his story, Byron exclaimed, accord- ing to Medwin: \"Is it possible? . . . Can we believe that we live in the nineteenth century? . . . We must endeavour to prevent this auto da f£\" Shelley had also heard the story and came in horror-struck. \"He proposed,\" Medwin recorded, \"that we should mount and arm ourselves as well as we could, set off immediately for Lucca, and endeavour to rescue the prisoner when brought out for ex- ecution, making at full speed for the Tuscan frontiers, where he would be safe. Mad and hopeless as the scheme was, Lord By- ron consented, carried away by his feelings, to join in it, if other means should fail.\" n They agreed to meet again in the evening, and Byron in the meantime suggested that Shelley should enlist the services of two men well acquainted at the court of Lucca. One was Lord Guilford, then at Leghorn, who knew the Grand Duke person- ally, but whom Byron knew only slightly and did not particu- larly like.* The other was Taaffe, who knew the language well aad had met many people of influence in Lucca through his PISA 957 friend Mme Regny. Although he took little stock in the fantastic story of inquisitorial cruelty, Taaffe succumbed to Byron's en- treaty and decided to go to Lucca himself to find out the truth of the matter and set Byron's mind at ease. When he returned to Pisa during the afternoon, he reported that there was no such cruel punishment on the statutes of Lucca, and that the story of the burning was a pure fabrication. But the sacrilege had been committed, and the culprit, a Florentine, had fled to the Tuscan territory and given himself up to the authorities there.71 So the matter blew over without involving Byron and his Pisan associ- ates in any rash conflict with the government, thanks to Taaff e's tactful resistance to any overt acts before the facts were known and to Byron's own curbing of Shelley's impetuosity. Shelley had received a letter on December 7 from the Hunts saying that they were finally embarking for Italy. Mary set out immediately to buy furniture for the bare ground floor of the Casa Lanfranchi, which Byron had agreed to put at their dis- posal.\" Byron insisted on paying for the furniture. Hunt, in his disgruntled account, when he was bent on belittling Byron's gen- erosity toward him, recorded that the furniture \"was good and respectable, but of the plainest and cheapest description, con- sistent with that character.\" n Mary Shelley took a different view of the matter. She wrote to Maria Gisborne on December 20: \"He [Hunt] will be more comfortable than he dreams of now. For Lord Byron has furnished the pian terreno of his own house for him. ... I am so happy. . . . and feel much gratitude to- wards L[ord] B[yron] for his unpretending generosity on this occasion.\" n But a letter arrived the next day from Hunt saying that he and his family had been delayed by storms and could not predict when they would get under way. Just after the middle of December there was a break in the mild weather which had prevailed through the autumn, and through the rest of the year a chill cloudiness, cold rain, and wind curtailed Byron's outdoor excursions, though the conversa- tions and Hinner parties at the Casa Lanfranchi continued. So strong was the hold that Byron had on the male members of his little circle that even Shelley and Williams left their families on Christmas Day to join Medwin and Taaffe at Byron's dinner ta- 958 CHAPTER XXIV: 1821-1822 ble. Of course Shelley, and probably Williams too, had an aver- sion to celebrating Christinas anyhow, but it must have been something of a disappointment for the women of the circle, in- cluding Teresa, to be shut out from the festivities. Williams had recorded in his journal on December 25: \"It was on this day that Lord B. and S[helley] proposed to give a thou- sand pounds to the other who first came to their estate/' n Per- haps Byron thought that by thus tempting fate he could hasten the demise of his mother-in-law, who, despite reports of her ill- health, seemed destined to live forever. When Williams called on Byron on January 3 he found him sitting for his bust to the noted sculptor Lorenzo Bartolini.\" By- ron later told Murray: \"Bartolini, the celebrated Sculptor, wrote to me to desire to take my bust: I consented, on condition that he also took that of the Countess Guiccioli. He has taken both, and I think it will be allowed that Hers is beautiful. I shall make you a present of them both, to show you that I don't bear mal- ice, and as a compensation for the trouble and squabble you had about Thorwaldsen's.6 Of my own I can hardly speak, except that it is thought very like what I now am, which is different from what I was, of course, since you saw me.\" n But, having taken the clay model, though it had been at his own particular request, Bartolini was slow in executing the busts in marble.\" When they were finally finished in September, Byron was shocked to see his own physical deterioration recorded in stone. As Byron approached his thirty-fourth birthday, he felt that he had already lived a lifetime and that his youth was gone. One evidence of it, even to his own consciousness, was that he no longer desired an all-consuming passion, but was content with the calmer relationship into which he had settled with Teresa. And he found this a pleasanter state even than that of being an active cavalier servente. This realization helped to make his life in Pisa pleasant and relaxed. But it was perhaps not quite so with Teresa, who, torn from her home and friends, felt a little ill at ease among Byron's English friends, whose language she 6 A reference to a misunderstanding which caused Murray to believe Byron intended the Thorwaldsen bust for him instead of Hobhouse. }*> BYRON, 1818 GIOVANNI BATTISTA FALCIERI (\"TIT A\") PISA 959 did not speak and whose ways she did not wholly comprehend. She could not help feeling something of an outsider, despite the kindness of Mary Shelley and Jane Williams. She admired Mary's wide reading and intellectual ardor, and foolishly thought that Byron would love her more if she emulated that paragon. She wrote him with a playful pathos one day: \"I will leave you now so as not to bore you — and to lose time, which should be given up entirely to the history of Hannibal. But will you love me more when I know by heart the names of the river Trebbia, of Lake Trasimene, and of Cannae? If you will, my memory will accomplish miracles. . . . But let this remain between us, my treasure. Love me, for I adore you and forgive you.\"\" But Byron had already expressed his views of \"ladies intellec- tual.\" What appealed to him in Teresa was that she had pre- served her youthful beauty and naive charm. Medwin quoted Byron as saying: \"Her conversation is lively, without being friv- olous; without being learned, she has read all the best authors of her own and the French language. She often conceals what she knows, from the fear of being thought to know too much; pos- sibly because she knows I am not fond of blues.\" If Medwin had stopped here, Teresa might in later years have forgiven him. But he added: \"Lord Byron is certainly very much attached to her without being actually in love.\" n Early in January, Byron received a letter which revived recol- lections of a time when his life was agitated by almost contin- uous passions, when the 'lava of the imagination\" was at fever heat, when in his days of fame almost every post brought letters from romantic young women. Harriette Wilson, who had seen him only once, according to her own story, at a masquerade in the \"summer of the sovereigns,\" 1814, had never forgotten Byron and had continued to write to him after he went abroad. Har- riette was not bashful. Her last letter, written to him at Ravenna in 1820 from Paris, where she was in dire need, had asked him for £50. Now she was back in England, deserted by all her lovers, and again in sorry straits. \"Do you want an english maid who is not a maid?'9 she asked, \"& whome you need not speak to for a month together, who can amuse herself alone, make your 960 CHAPTER XXIV: 1821-1822 room look comfortable, pimp for you in french but not in ITALIAN, make your tea a Tanglaise your coffee bien a la francoise do any- thing but mend your shirts for I can't do needle work — if so pray have me and I would rather upon my word be your servant & live in your kitchen than wife to anybody else.\" * A letter that probably pleased Byron more was one from Sir Walter Scott. He told Medwin: 'The sight of one of his letters always does me good.\" n He replied immediately, apologizing for not having written before: \"I can only account for ... [not writing] on the same principle of tremulous anxiety with which one sometimes makes love to a beautiful woman of our own de- gree, with whom one is enamoured in good earnest; whereas, we attack a fresh-coloured housemaid without (I speak, of course, of earlier times) any sentimental remorse or mitigation of our virtuous purpose/* Byron ended his letter with a tribute to the Scotch novels of Scott: 'To me those novels have so much of 'Auld lang syne' (I was bred a canny Scot till ten years old), that I never move with- out them; and when I removed from Ravenna to Pisa the other day, and sent on my library before, they were the only books that I kept by me, although I already have them by heart/' n On January 14 a new and livening apparition entered the Pi- san circle. Edward John Trelawny, a curious combination of salty adventurer and sensitive enthusiast with a longing to asso- ciate with literary men, had come to Italy purposely to meet Shelley and Byron. Medwin had induced Williams to join Shelley, and Williams in turn, with his enthusiastic letters to Tre- lawny about both Shelley and Byron, had drawn that pictur- esque character into the Pisan circle. Trelawny had met Medwin and Williams at Geneva the previous winter. His ostensible pur- pose was to go on a hunting expedition into the Maremma, a wild forest and swampland south of Leghorn, with his friend Captain Daniel Roberts, but after leaving Roberts at Genoa, and shipping his guns, dogs, and baggage to Leghorn, he drove on to Pisa. Encouraged by Williams, he had already conceived the idea of spending the following summer boating on the Mediter- ranean with Shelley and Byron.n He was cordially welcomed by the Williamses, who were then PISA 961 living in a flat below the Shelleys in the Tre Palazzi, and the same evening he met Shelley and Mary, who was particularly struck by him. Mary wrote in her diary a few days later: \"Trelawney [sic] is extravagant — un giovane stravagante — partly natural and partly perhaps put on, but it suits him well, and if his abrupt but not unpolished manners be assumed, they are nevertheless in unison with his Moorish face (for he looks Oriental yet not Asiatic) his dark hair, his Herculean form, and then there is an air of extreme good nature which pervades his whole counte- nance, especially when he smiles, which assures me that his heart is good. He tells strange stories of himself, horrific ones, so that they harrow one up, while with his emphatic but unmodulated voice, his simple yet strong language, he pourtrays the most frightful situations; then all these adventures took place between the age of thirteen and twenty. I believe them now I see the man. Trelawny later told some of these stories in his Adventures of a Younger Son, which he set before the world as his autobiog- raphy. According to this account, he entered the Royal Navy in 1805 after an unhappy childhood in Cornwall, fought his way against sadistically cruel naval officers, deserted in India, joined up with a Dutch-American privateersman, half Robin Hood, who became his hero and who put him, still a boy, in command of one of his vessels. Flying the French flag, they fought Malay pi- rates and harried the East India Company's shipping, carrying their prizes into the harbors of Mauritius, where De Ruyter, the heroic leader of the band, had an idyllic estate in the hills. Tre- lawny had dressed and looked the part of an Arab, and had married an Arab girl whom he had rescued. The death of his idolized Zela, a savage and devoted wife like no woman in fic- tion, unless it might be the Gulnare of Byron's Corsair ( a poem greatly admired by Trelawny), took the zest out of his adven- tures, and after cremating her on the sands, he returned discon- tentedly to civilization. But the facts of his early life, only recently discovered, were quite different. He was never a pirate or privateersman, and he never deserted from the Royal Navy, but returned to England in 1812 in a British frigate. Nor, so far as is known, did he ever 962 CHAPTER XXIV: 1821-182* marry an Arab girl. It is possible that he saw some of the actions he described, but under the British rather than the French flag, and that he heard about others. Most of his vicarious heroisms were no doubt daydreams.11 The day after Trelawny's arrival in Pisa, Williams and Shelley took him to see Taaffe,n and at two o'clock, when Byron was likely to be rising, they crossed the bridge and followed the Lungarno to the Casa Lanfranchi. Trelawny recalled: \"A surly- looking bull-dog (Moretto) announced us, by growling, and the Pilgrim instantly advanced from an inner chamber, and stood before us. His halting gait was apparent, but he moved with quickness; and although pale, he looked as fresh, vigorous, and animated, as any man I ever saw. His pride, added to his hav- ing lived for many years alone, was the cause I suppose that he was embarrassed at first meeting with strangers; this he tried to conceal by an affectation of ease. After the interchange of com- monplace question and answer, he regained his self-possession. ... He then took a cue, and asked me to play billiards; he struck the balls and moved about the table briskly, but neither played the game nor cared a rush about it. . . .\" Byron recounted anecdotes about the East, not forgetting to drag in his feat of swimming the Hellespont. Trelawny was at first a little taken aback. \"I had come prepared to see a solemn mystery,\" he wrote, \"and so far as I could judge from the first act it seemed to me very like a solemn farce. I forgot that great actors when off the stage are dull dogs. . . \" n Trelawny noted that Byron's conversation \"was anything but literary, except when Shelley was near him. The character he most commonly appeared in was of the fine and easy sort, such as had been in vogue when he was in London, and George IV. was Regent; and his talk was seasoned with anecdotes of the great actors on and off the stage, boxers, gamblers, duellists, drunkards, &c., &c., appropriately garnished with the slang and scandal of that day. Such things had all been in fashion, and were at that time considered accomplishments by gentlemen. . . . His long absence had not effaced the mark John Bull brands his children with, the instant he loomed above the horizon, on foot or horseback, you saw at a glance he was a Britisher. . . . PISA 963 He seemed to take an especial pleasure in making a clean breast to every new comer, as if to mock their previous conceptions of him, and to give the lie to the portraits published of him.\" n On another occasion Trelawny wrote: \"Lord Byron was noth- ing in conversation, unless you were alone with him, but then he was rich as a gold mine, in every direction you bored into him you could extract wealth, and he was never exhausted — \" n Byron was a little perplexed and embarrassed by Trelawny's emulation at first, as if he had seen a caricature of his own East- ern heroes in this strange character. After the first meeting he told Teresa: \"I have met today the personification of my Corsair. He sleeps with the poem under his pillow, and all his past ad- ventures and present manners aim at this personification/' n But after a few days Byron was quite at ease with Trelawny, who had become an almost daily visitor. One of the first things Trelawny did was to reanimate the scheme, which Williams and Shelley had been fostering for some weeks, to have a boat built and to spend the summer on the Bay of Spezia. Trelawny was responsible, too, for rekindling Byron's interest in the summer plans and in having a boat built for himself. Shelley had already entered into the proposal with the zest of a boy. Trelawny suggested that Shelley persuade Byron to join the proposed summer colony. \"No!\" Shelley replied, \"you must do that. Byron is always influenced by his last acquaint- ance. You are the last man, so do you pop the question.\" * \"The following morning,\" Trelawny continued, \"I told Byron our plan. Without any suggestion from me he eagerly volun- teered to join us, and asked me to get a yacht built for him, and to look out for a house as near the sea as possible. I allowed some days to pass before I took any steps in order to see if his wayward mind would change.\" n But when he discovered that Byron's interest persisted, Tre- lawny asked Roberts to send plans. By February 5 he was giv- ing final instructions: \"I have only time to tell you, that you are to consider this letter as definitive, and to cancel every other re- garding the Boats! \"First, then, continue the one you are at work upon for Lord B. She is to have Iron Keel, copper fastenings and bottom — the 964 CHAPTER XXIV: 1821-1822 Cabin to be as high and roomy as possible, no expence to be spared to make her a complete BEAUTY! We should like to have four guns, one on each bow and one on each quarter, as large as you think safe — to make a devil of a noise! — fitted with locks — the swivels of brass! — I suppose from one to three pounders/' n Byron later regretted that he had told Trelawny to spare no expense, for the boat eventually cost nearly ten times what he had anticipated. He told Kinnaird in February that the boat he was building would cost \"a hundred or more/' n But in the end it cost nearer a thousand pounds.\" Shelley and Williams had modified their rather too ambitious plans for a thirty-foot boat. \"But in her lieu,\" Trelawny wrote Roberts, \"will you lay us down a small beautiful one of about 17 or 18 feet? to be a thorough Varment at pulling and sailing! Single banked oars, say four or six; and we think, if you differ not, three luggs and a jib — backing ones! — She will be used for fishing, shooting, and as a tender for the other.\" * Trelawny settled quickly into the Byronic orbit. On the i6th he dined with the ''pistol club\" at the Casa Lanfranchi and met Bartolini there.\" But from the first he had a greater affinity for Shelley. While he spent part of almost every day with Byron, fre- quently riding with him on the daily pistol-shooting expeditions, he more often spent the evenings with the Shelleys and their friends. At least according to his later account, Trelawny soon discovered Byron's weaknesses. Despite his wide and harsh experience of the world, Trelawny was in some respects rather naive and serious, and Byron no doubt delighted in baiting him as he did Shelley. All of the Pi- san circle were under thirty except Byron and Taaffe, who were about the same age. Trelawny later recalled that Byron once said, apropos of a proposed introduction, \"that he wished to know no men under thirty nor women beyond it.\" n In his Records, composed in his last years, Trelawny wrote: \"A short time after I knew Byron, I said to Shelley, Trlow very unlike Byron is to what people say of him. I see no mystery about him — he is too free; he says things better not said. I shall take care what I say to him. He reads parts of letters from his London correspondents/ (Mrs. Shelley smiled; she knew they cautioned PISA 965 Byron not to risk his popularity by coupling his name with Shelley's.) 'He is as impulsive and jealous as a woman, and may be as changeable.' \"At a subsequent conversation Shelley called Mrs. Shelley and said, 'Mary, Trelawny has found out Byron already. How stupid we were — how long it took us.' \" n But Shelley did not cease to admire Byron's poetry, nor did Trelawny withdraw from the charmed circle at the Casa Lan- franchi. For the communal life still centered there. The few times that Byron was induced to go elsewhere, he was, despite his pose of man of the world, distinctly ill at ease. Trelawny noted that Shelley, forgetting himself, was much more natural. \"To the first party I went with Byron, as we were on the road, he said, \" It's so long since I have been in English society, you must tell me what are their present customs. Does rank lead the way, or does the ambassadress pair us off into the dining-room? Do they ask people to wine? Do we exit with the women, or stick to our claret?' \"On arriving, he was flushed, fussy, embarrassed, over cere- monious, and ill at ease, evidently thinking a great deal of himself and very little of others.\" n But in his own house, in congenial company, Byron was at his best, as Williams, Shelley, Medwin, and Trelawny himself all bore witness. And he was happiest when, after an evening of stimulating conversation, he had a composition that engrossed him to keep him at his desk until the small hours of the morning. Trelawny, with his sailor habits, considered Byron lazy and dawdling. When Trelawny first met him, he was writing Werner. Mary Shelley, glad to have some contact with Byron again, was copying the manuscript for the printer, as she had copied Mazeppa in i8i8.w But Byron's relations with Murray of late had so irritated him that he had again decided to withdraw from him as a publisher, without quarreling with him personally if that were possible. According to Medwin, Byron said of the manuscript of Heaven and Earth, which he had sent to England in Decem- ber: \"Douglas Kinnaird tells me that he can get no bookseller CHAPTER XXIV: 1821-1822 to publish it. It was offered to Murray, but he is the most timid of God's booksellers, and starts at the title/7 n On January 23 he was further annoyed, on receiving a copy of the three plays published in December, to find that Murray had omitted the dedication of Sardanapalus to Goethe.\" Kin- naird, too, seeing the outcry against Cain, had warned him not to rush into print again too soon. But he replied: \"No one has a greater right to say what he pleases to me than you, who have so much bother and trouble on my account. But acknowl- edging all this, I shall not the less continue to publish, till I have run my vein dry. If it is not profitable, be it so, I shall do so for nothing (till it becomes actually a loss) and this because it is an occupation of mind, like play, or any other stimulus.\" * His determination to leave Murray had not wavered a week later when the manuscript of Werner had been copied, and he sent it to Moore in Paris, at the same time asking Kin- naird to collect all his manuscripts in England and send them to Paris also. Murray indeed had reason for caution, however, for the cry was up concerning the \"blasphemies\" of Cain. Kinnaird had called Byron's attention to an anonymous pamphlet entitled A Remonstrance to Mr. John Murray, Respecting a Recent Publi- cation, by \"Oxoniensis,\" which attacked the Manichean doc- trines and other \"often-refuted sophisms\" of the poem, pointing out that many of these came from Bayle's Dictionary, or Voltaire's novels.\" Byron replied with an arch nonchalance: \"I know noth- ing of Rivington's n remonstrance by the 'eminent Churchman,' but I suppose he wants a living. I only heard of a preacher at Kentish town against Cain. The same outcry was raised against Priestley, Hume, Gibbon, Voltaire, and all the men who ever dared put tithes to the question/'71 The attack on the poem had extended even to Pisa, where the Reverend George Frederick Nott, who preached to a small group of English people on the ground floor of the Tre Palazzi, spoke out against the heresies of Cain. Byron replied to his oblique thrusts by writing some satirical verses on the hypo- critical moralist, who had, according to Medwin, earned the nickname of \"Slip-knot.\" n PISA 967 At the beginning of February, Byron had a quarrel on his hands which absorbed more of his emotional intensities. Robert Southey had seen Byron's note to The Two Foscari, and wrote a bitter reply which was published in The Courier on January 5. A copy of this letter reached Pisa on February 4,\" but Byron did not see it until the next evening. During his afternoon ride with Byron on the 5th, Medwin mentioned having seen Southey s attack at Mr. Edgworth's and told him the general purport of it. \"His anxiety to get a sight of it was so great,\" Medwin re- corded, \"that he wrote me two notes in the course of the evening, entreating me to procure the paper. I at length succeeded, and took it to the Lanfranchi palace at eleven o'clock. . . . \"He had left the Guiccioli earlier than usual, and I found him waiting with some impatience. I never shall forget his countenance as he glanced rapidly over the contents. He looked perfectly awful: his colour changed almost prismatically, his lips were as pale as death. He said not a word. He read it a second time, and with more attention than his rage at first per- mitted, commenting on some of the passages as he went on. When he had finished, he threw down the paper, and asked me if I thought there was any thing of a personal nature in the reply that demanded satisfaction; as, if there was, he would instantly set off for England and call Southey to an account, — muttering something about whips, and branding-irons, and gib- bets, and wounding the heart of a woman, — words of Mr. Southey's. I said that, as to personality his own expressions of 'cowardly ferocity/ 'pitiful renegado/ ^hireling/ [were] much stronger than any in the letter before me.\" * Southey's letter to The Courier was provocative enough. By- ron, he said, had avoided acknowledging the basis of his ani- madversions against the Satanic School. \"He conceals the fact that they are directed against authors of blasphemous and las- civious books; against men who, not content with indulging their own vices, labour to make others the slaves of sensuality like themselves; against public panders, who, mingling impiety with lewdness, seek at once to destroy the cement of social order, and to carry profanation and pollution into private families, and into the hearts of individuals.\" 968 CHAPTER XXIV: 1821-1822 With complacent self-confidence, Southey offered Byron a bit of advice: \"When he attacks me again let it be in rhyme. For one who has so little command of himself, it will be a great advantage that his temper should be obliged to keep tune\"n This was excellent counsel, but Byron had already taken it, and Southey might well have paused had he known with what devastating effectiveness Byron had launched his poetic attack. Byron himself was aware that his Vision of Judgment was the most effective reply, for the day after he had seen Southey's letter, he wrote to Kinnaird: \"Try back the deep lane/ till we find a publisher for 'the Vision/ and if none such is to be found, print fifty copies (at my expense), distribute them amongst my acquaintances, and you will soon see that the book- sellers will publish them.\" n But this was his second thought, for after Medwin left him on the evening of the 5th, Byron sat down and dashed off almost eight folio pages of a prose reply addressed to the editor of The Courier? This literary exertion had apparently gathered up instead of dissipated Byron's spleen, for in a post- script to his letter to Kinnaird the next day he wrote: \"What remains to be done is to call him out. The question is, would he come? for if he would not, the whole thing would appear ridiculous, if I were to take a long and expensive journey to no purpose.\" n The following day, the yth, he enclosed in another letter to Kinnaird a curt note addressed to Southey: \"My friend, the Honourable Douglas Kinnaird, will deliver to you a message from me, to which an answer is requested.\" And to Kinnaird he wrote: \"I give you a 'Carte blanche' in Southey's busi- ness. . . . Better on the coast of France, as less liable to inter- ruption or publicity, but I presume Mr. S. is too great a patriot to come off the soil for such a purpose/' * For some weeks after this Byron kept open the possibility that he would be called to England to meet with Southey, but it did not seem to unsettle his plans for the building of his boat or shatter the pleasure of his daily routine. His knowledge of Kinnaird's good judgment perhaps contributed to his equa- nimity even more than his belief in Southey's cowardice, But he PISA 969 had made his gesture, and his friends could make what they would of it. On March 20, Williams recorded: \"Kinnaird did not think it necessary to present Lord B's challenge to fight Southey and therefore this contemptible affair is dropped for the mo- ment.\"7 News that Murray was likely to be prosecuted for the publi- cation of Cain caused Byron to write his publisher in a half- scolding, half -placating manner: \"I can only say . . . that any proceedings directed against you, I beg, may be transferred to me, who am willing, and ought, to endure them all; that if you have lost money by the publication, I will refund any or all of the Copyright. ... If they prosecute, I will come to Eng- land— that is, if, by meeting it in my own person, I can save yours.\" 8 And Byron used the situation as a justification for sever- ing publishing connections with Murray, Having confided his spleen to paper in the quiet hours of the morning (\"All my malice evaporates in the effusions of my pen . . . ,\"n he told Lady Blessington), Byron looked out from his study upon the moonlit night and concluded: \"I write to you about all this row of bad passions and absurdities with the Summer Moon (for here our Winter is clearer than your Dog days) lighting the winding Arno, with all her buildings and bridges, so quiet and still: what Nothings we are! before the least of these Stars!\" n On February 12, Trelawny called with the drawing Roberts had made of Byron's boat/1 There was much discussion about the summer plans, though the sparsity of houses was an obstacle, and Byron required a spacious mansion. Apparently Taaffe, who, Mary said, \"bores us out of our [senses],\"*1 was not to be of the party, and Medwin was planning a trip to Rome. But Tre- 7 Williams, p. 135. In the margin of his copy of Moore (II, 575), opposite Byron's statement in a letter to Moore: *1 wrote to Douglas Kinnaird to con- vey a message of invitation to Mr. Southey,\" Hobhouse wrote: \"J[ohn] C.[am] H[obhouse] stopt this from being sent\" Byron did not forget \"master Southey,\" however, and nothing could rouse him quicker than a reference to the Laureate. 8 LJ9 VI, 16-17. Cwn was not prosecuted, but to protect the copyright when it was pirated immediately after publication, Murray sought an injunction, which Lord Eldon, the Chancellor, refused. Murray eventually got his in- junction through a jury trial. 970 CHAPTER XXIV: 1821-1822 lawny and Captain Roberts would join the Shelleys, and Teresa and Pietro would follow Byron. The Williamses also expected to take a house on the coast. On the 15th news came that Lady Noel had died on January 28.\" It was an event Byron had long looked forward to,9 but when it happened, despite his frequent facetious remarks on the longevity and toughness of the old lady, his first reaction carried him into sentimental reflections on the past and sympathy for his wife. Medwin said that when he called, Byron and all his servants were in deep mourning, and in telling him the cause of it Byron said: \"I am distressed for poor Lady Byron! She must be in great affliction, for she adored her mother! The world will think I am pleased at this event, but they are much mis- taken.\" n By the terms of the separation settlement, the income from the Wentworth estates, roughly estimated at £/ 10,000 a year, was to be divided by arbitrators at Lady Noel's death, one to be appointed by each party. Byron immediately wrote to Kin- naird naming Sir Francis Burdett, Hobhouse's close friend in Reform politics, as his referee, and asking that £ 10,000 insurance be taken on Lady Byron's life, as the Wentworth income would go to other heirs at her death. But he was eager to be generous in his dealing with Lady Byron. He told Kinnaird: \". . . I have no wish to press Sir Ralph [Lady Byron's father] or his off- spring hard; for example the Mansion-house [Kirkby Mallory] (which rests in abeyance for the Umpires in this boxing match to award to time) is no object to me living abroad, and with no wish to return to your agreeable country/' And as he was 9 Williams wrote on February 15: \"Heard of the death of Lady Noel and that Lord B. consequently comes into an estate of 10,000 a year — Memo on this subject— See Xmas day/' (Williams, p. 130.) It was at the Christmas Day dinner that, according to Williams, Byron and Shelley had made an agreement that the one who came into his estate first should pay the other £ 1,000. Whether either took it seriously it is difficult to know. Medwin said that \"Williams . . . was highly indignant at, and disgusted with Lord Byron, and never afterwards entered his doors. . . /' (Life of Shelley, 1913. P- 3750 This last statement, however, is abundantly refuted by Wil- liams's journal, which records no such indignant feeling and indicates that he continued to call on Byron frequently and to express admiration for his character and his genius. PISA 971 by terms of the will to take the Noel arms, he signed himself for the first time \"Noel Byron.\" n Thenceforth he took a childish pride in the fact that his initials, \"N. B.,\" were the same as those of Napoleon Bonaparte. It was Byron's expectation that a certain fixed sum would be allowed Lady Byron out of the annual rents, but when the ref- erees met on April 4 (Lord Dacre for Lady Byron, Sir Francis Burdett for Byron), they decided that \"the moiety of the net proceeds of the said Estates of the said Lord Wentworth shall be applied to the sole use of Lady Byron/' n Lord Dacre wrote afterward to Burdett that it was understood that the decision was influenced in part \"by the consideration that the expenses of maintaining the Child must fall upon Lady Byron/' and that no extra allowance was to be made for that purpose.** The actual money value of the property was less than anticipated, but sufficient so that Byron's share approximately doubled his in- come. Hanson reported that \"the gross Rental of the Wentworth Estates, as handed over to us, is £6336 a year exclusive of the House at Kirkby Mallory and about 160 acres of Land held therewith.'*1 With deductions for upkeep and other expenses, Byron's share would be about £2,500. With this new access of wealth, Byron could afford to be generous with Leigh Hunt, whose demands for money, through Shelley, were increasing. Stranded at Plymouth for the winter with a sick wife and a large family, Hunt, having already drained the ready cash of his brother John, sent a desperate appeal to Shelley, who on January 25 sent him £150. Seriously concerned with Hunt's naive unconcern about money matters and his trust that others would provide for him, Shelley wrote: \"Pray tell me in answer to this letter, unless you answer it in person, what arrangement you have made about the receipt of a regular income from the profits of the Examiner.\" 2 But in 1 Letter of April 8, 1822, Murray MSS. Lady Byron continued to live at Kirkby Mallory. Byron's total income now came to more than £6,000 from the funds and the Wentworth estate. In addition he had been earning more than £2,000 a year by his pen, but that income was beginning to fall off. 2 Shelley: Letters, Julian ed., X, 351. Trelawny wrote that Byron's principal inducement in joining in the plans for the journal with Hunt \"was in the be- lief that John and Leigh Hunt were proprietors of the 'Examiner;' — so when 972 CHAPTER XXIV: 1821-1822 the meantime Hunt embarrassed Shelley considerably by appeal- ing directly to Byron for money for his voyage. The defensive familiarity of his tone did not make the request less audacious. There was always a mingling of sycophancy and brazenness in Hunt's letters to Byron which, when their relations became more strained, annoyed Byron considerably. The letter, dated Plym- outh, January 27, 1822, began: My dear Byron, (For I will not abate a jot of my democracy, at least on occasions of letter-writing, and especially the present one) Shelley told me some time ago that you were good enough to wish my company in Italy, and that you would have sent me a considerable sum of money to enable me to come over.\" I could not leave England at that time; but you may imagine I was not insensible of your kindness. He confessed: \"I might have been somewhat coy in matters of pecuniary obligation to you at that time . . . because from the first hour I knew you, I had got a romantic notion in my head, perhaps a coxcombical one, (and yet not so), of awaken- ing your school-day ideas of friendship again, & shewing you that a man could cultivate your regard, merely from a disin- terested love of your intellectual qualities and of that very gener- osity. ... I must give you a still better proof perhaps of my boyish notions of friendship, & fairly ask you for your assistance. I would borrow, if possible, (for other purposes besides the mere journey) as much as £250, only you must let me have two years to return it in; I should rather say, 'you will have/ — if you can, — for I persuade myself on this occasion that if you have as much to spare, or half of it, you will lend it me with as [word torn out] readiness, — as true a \"Here, Hunt/ — as you would have done a [word torn out] or a cricket-bat at school.\" n Hunt had apparently written to Shelley at the same time Leigh Hunt at Pisa told him he was no longer connected with that paper, Byron was taken aback, finding that Hunt would be entirely dependent on the success of their hazardous project, while he would himself be deprived of that on which he had set his heart, — the use of a weekly paper in great circulation.\" (Trelawny: Recollections, p. 155.) It is probable that if Hunt ever had any proprietary interest in The Examiner, his debts to his brother wiped it out. PISA 973 asking his assistance in opening Byron's purse, for Shelley wrote to Byron on February 15: \"Hunt had urged me more than once to ask you to lend him this money. My answer consisted in sending him all I could spare, which I have now literally done. ... I do not think poor Hunt's promise to pay in a given time is worth very much; but mine is less subject to uncertainty, and I should be happy to be responsible for any engagement he may have proposed to you/' n Byron felt sufficiently obligated to Hunt and enough interested in the joint literary adventure to supply the money requested despite the gaucheries of Hunt's appeal and his own increasing disinclination to make large disbursements. Knowing something of Hunt's impecunious habits, and fearing that he would spend the money before leaving England and would then ask for more, while the delay might cool Byron's ardor for the literary journal, Shelley urged him to sail at once. But he added a sentence at the end of his letter which was not likely to make Hunt more economical in the use of Byron's money: \"You know Lady Noel is dead, and Lord B. is rich, a still richer man.\"* Byron's newly acquired wealth had, however, made him only more concerned with its conservation. His change in attitude from that of his spendthrift youth was perhaps due in part to the fact that at thirty-four he was experiencing the growing anxieties of age and the need for security. He was looking for- ward to the time when he would have to provide not only for himself, but also for his child, perhaps for Teresa and her family, and very probably for Augusta and her children. Shelley's uneasiness concerning his relations with Byron was largely due to the agitation of Claire over Byron's failure to bring Allegra with him or to remove her from the convent when he left Ravenna. According to her later account, she induced Mr. Tighe (alias Mason, the common-law husband of Lady Mountcashell) to make a secret trip to Ravenna and Bagna- cavallo to find out what he could about the convent and Allegra's treatment there. His report was not reassuring, she said. He brought back tales of the fever-ridden marshes of the Romagna, of the poverty and austerity of the nuns, the poorness of the food, and the lack of fire in the winter. \"You may think what 974 CHAPTER XXIV: 1821-1822 pangs of anguish I suffered in the winter of 21,\" Claire wrote many years later to Trelawny, \"when I saw a bright fire, and people and children warming themselves by it, and knew my darling never saw or felt a cheerful blaze. . . \"n She was now in a state in which she was willing to believe the worst, and, finding sympathy in the Masons while she feared Shelley and Mary were too close to Byron to be wholly trusted with her schemes, she only hinted to Shelley that she had some bold plans for rescuing her child. Claire, following the advice of Mrs. Mason (Lady Mount- cashell), wrote to Byron to plead with him to place Allegra in some respectable family in Pisa, Florence, or Lucca. Receiving no reply, she wrote again in a month and still met with a complete silence.\" Then on February 18 she wrote once more, asking for a chance to see Allegra before departing for Vienna to join her brother and look for employment there.\" Byron, as always aroused to brutal resistance and unreasoning contempt by Claire's histrionic appeals for sympathy, ignored this appeal as he had her other letters. In the meantime, he had been enjoying a social and literary existence in a closed circle which he dominated. Although he did not actively participate in the Carnival, then at its height, the atmosphere of gaiety permeated even the Casa Lanfranchi. According to Medwin, Byron had taken a box at the opera along with others of the group, and, although he himself, out of deference to Teresa, did not, despite his strong attraction to the theater, frequent it, others of the party did.\" Aroused by the community activity to something like the lit- erary evenings he had shared with the Shelleys at Diodati, and stirred too perhaps by the Carnival spirit (masked revelers were constantly passing before his house on the Lungarno), By- ron proposed some private theatricals at the Casa Lanfranchi. Medwin recorded: \"It was accordingly agreed that we should commence with 'Othello/ Lord Byron was to be lago. Orders were to be given for the fitting up of the stage, preparing the dresses, etc., and rehearsals of a few scenes took place. Perhaps Lord Byron would have made the finest actor in the world. His voice had a flexibility, a variety in its tones, a power PISA 975 and pathos beyond any I ever heard; and his countenance was capable of expressing the tenderest, as well as the strongest emotions. I shall never forget his reading lago's part in the handkerchief scene.\" n But on the 2,8th, Williams wrote in his journal: \"Othello that was talked of laid aside/' n Medwin implied that the reason was the jealousy of Teresa, who was left out of the cast because she could not speak English. \"All at once,\" he said, \"a difficulty arose about a Desdemona, and the Guiccioli put her Veto on our theatricals.\"*1 There may well have been other reasons for the abandonment of the theatricals. On February 21, Claire Clairmont arrived in Pisa from Florence to discuss with the Masons and the Shelleys means of softening Byron or of getting Allegra out of his hands. She remained until the 25th,n and it seems likely that her wretched state of anxiety put a damper on the festive spirit of the little group. She was apparently encouraged by the Masons and by an orphan girl named Elizabeth Parker, who was living with them, in her wild schemes to take drastic action to rescue the child. What actually happened during her stay in Pisa can only be surmised. \"I was for decided measures,\" Claire wrote to Trelawny in her old age, \"and so were Lady M. and Mr. Tighe — so also was Elisabeth Parker. . . . Elisabeth constantly averred that nothing but the death of L.B. would free the child and that were she its mother she would stab or shoot him . . . but I was not cast in that mould. . . \"n The Shelleys were sympathetic, but counseled caution, and felt that Claire was exaggerating the evils of the convent. It is probable that Byron did not know of her visit, but Shelley, urged against his better judgment by her plaintive appeals after she returned to Florence, did finally approach Byron on the subject of her anxiety and appealed to him to do something to ease her mind. According to Claire, Byron's only reply \"was a shrug of impatience, and the exclamation that women could not live without making scenes.\" n Elizabeth Parker gave Claire a circumstantial account of the interview calculated to make her even more wildly determined to take things into her own hands. \"I never saw him [Shelley] 976 CHAPTER XXIV: 1821-1822 in a passion before/' she wrote; 'last night, however, he was downright, positively angry. . . . Mr. Shelley declared to Lady Mountcashell that he could with pleasure have knocked Lord Byron down; for when he mentioned that you were half-dis- tracted with alarm about the child's health, and also that you were yourself in very declining health, he saw a gleam of ma- licious satisfaction pass over Lord Byron's countenance. 1 saw his look/ Mr. Shelley said; 1 understood its meaning; I de- spised him, and I came away.' These were his own epigrammatic words. Afterwards he said, It is foolish of me to be angry with him; he can no more help being what he is than yonder door can help being a door.' Mr. Tighe then said, 'You are quite wrong in your fatalism. If I were to horsewhip that door, it would still remain a door; but if Lord Byron were well horsewhipped, my opinion is he would become as humane as he is now inhumane.'\"*1 Following further frantic letters from Claire, who wanted Mary to come to Florence and help her formulate plans for abducting Allegra from the convent, the Shelleys used their ut- most persuasiveness to try to prevent her from doing anything rash that might forever alienate Byron and make him even more adamant in his resolve to protect Allegra from a madwoman. Much as he disliked continuing his intimacy with Byron, Shelley felt that for Hunt's sake he must not break with him before the new journal was established. Moreover, Shelley, like Mary, could not escape feeling attracted to Byron when he was near him, and continued to have an admiration for his poetry which no judgment of the author's character ever affected. Mary wrote to John Murray after reading Moore's Letters and Journals of Byron in 1830: \"The great charm of the work to me ... is that the Lord Byron I find there is our Lord Byron — the fascinat- ing— faulty— childish — philosophical being— daring the world — docile to a private circle — impetuous and indolent — gloomy and yet more gay than any other. I live with him again in these pages — getting reconciled (as I used to in his lifetime) to those waywardnesses which annoyed me when he was away, through the delightful & buoyant tone of his conversation and man- ners—\" n PISA 977 Shelley wrote to Hunt on March 2: \"Particular circumstances, or rather I should say, particular dispositions in Lord B's char- acter, render the close and exclusive intimacy with him in which I find myself, intolerable to me; thus much, my best friend I will confess and confide to you. No feelings of my own however shall injure or interfere with what is ever nearest to them — your interest, and I will take care to preserve the little influence I may have over this Proteus in whom such strange extremes are reconciled until we meet. . . .\" * Byron's attention was now turned again to the uproar over the supposed blasphemies of Cain. He could express contempt for the views of sanctimonious English clergymen on the sub- ject, but when Moore, who had at first praised the poem, caught up the cry of irreligion, he was more perturbed. \"I am no enemy to religion,\" he replied, \"but the contrary. As a proof, I am educating my natural daughter a strict Catholic in a convent of Romagna; for I think people can never have enough of reli- gion, if they are to have any. . . . \"As to poor Shelley, who is another bugbear to you and the world, he is to my knowledge, the least selfish and the mildest of men — a man who has made more sacrifices of his fortune and feelings for others than any I ever heard of. With his speculative opinions I have nothing in common, nor desire to have.8 \"The truth is, my dear Moore, you live near the stove of society, where you are unavoidably influenced by its heat and its vapours. I did so once — and too much — and enough to give a colour to my whole future existence. . . . One thing only might lead me back to it, and that is, to try once more if I could do any good in politics; but not in the petty politics I see now 8 Shelley, in a letter to Horace Smith, April 11, 1822, wrote, apropos of a letter from Moore which Byron had showed him: \"Amongst other things . . . Moore, after giving Lord B. much good advice about public opinion, etc., seems to deprecate MY influence on his mind, on the subject of religion, and to attribute the tone assumed in 'Cain' to my suggestions. ... I think you know Moore. Pray assure him that I have not the smallest influence over Lord Byron, in this particular, and if I had, I certainly should employ it to eradicate from his great mind the delusions of Christianity, which, in spite of his reason, seem perpetually to recur, and to lay in ambush for the hours of sickness and distress.\" (Shelley: Works, Julian ed., X, 377-8.) • 978 CHAPTER XXIV: 1821-1822 preying upon our miserable country/' n In another letter to Moore, Byron said that Catholicism \"is by far the most elegant worship, hardly excepting the Greek mythology. What with incense, pic- tures, statues, altars, shrines, relics, and the real presence, con- fession, absolution, — there is something sensible to grasp at. Be- sides, it leaves no possibility of doubt; for those who swallow their Deity, really and truly, in transubstantiation, can hardly find any thing else otherwise than easy of digestion. \"I am afraid that this sounds flippant, but I don't mean it to be so; only my turn of mind is so given to taking things in the absurd point of view, that it breaks out in spite of me every now and then.4 Still, I do assure you that I am a very good Christian.\" n On March 8, Byron gave a dinner party to which Taaffe and half a dozen English were invited. It was probably intended as a farewell party for Medwin, who, Williams records, left for Rome the next day. It was a convivial affair. Williams re- corded in his journal: \"During dinner S[helley] repeated some of the finest lines of Childe Harold, and Lord B. after listening to a stanza — cried 'Heavens! Shelley, what infinite nonsense are you quoting?'\"11 Byron, usually rather abstemious, indulged in more wine than was his custom during the evening. Trelawny was unimpressed with Byron's boast of the drinking he had done as a young man. \"From all that I heard or wit- nessed of his habits abroad, he was and had been exceedingly abstemious in eating and drinking. When alone, he drank a glass or two of small claret or hock, and when utterly exhausted at night a single glass of grog; which when I mixed it for him I lowered to what sailors call Vater bewitched/ and he never made any remark. . . . \"Byron had not damaged his body by strong drinks, but his terror of getting fat was so great that he reduced his diet to the point of absolute starvation. . . . When he added to his weight, even standing was painful, so he resolved to keep down to eleven stone, or shoot himself. . . . \"He was the only human being I ever met with who had 4 Hobhouse wrote in the margin of his copy of Moore's life of Byron at this point: \"This is the man.\" PISA 979 sufficient self-restraint and resolution to resist this proneness to fatten. . . . He would exist on biscuits and soda-water for days together, then, to allay the eternal hunger gnawing at his vitals, he would make up a horrid mess of cold potatoes, rice, fish, or greens, deluged in vinegar, and gobble it up like a famished dog.\"\" Captain John Hay, Byron's old friend, had arrived in Pisa in January. After returning from a hunting expedition in the Maremma,11 he soon replaced Medwin in the circle and joined in the daily ride. Even before he heard on the 20th that Kin- naird had not delivered his challenge to Southey, Byron had given up any serious idea of returning to England. Despite the lack of political freedom in Italy, his life in that country had meant to him an emancipation from the shackles of English prejudices, and he could not easily give that up. Byron was satisfied too with his present relations with his arnica. The quiet domesticity of his evening visits was tranquil- izing rather than exciting, but he had had enough of the tortur- ing passion. Middle age had definitely settled upon him. His fondness for Teresa had not diminished. When the plans for the boats had been conceived, Byron's first impulse was to name his craft after her.5 Teresa was contented, despite the fact that she was forced to spend more time with Mary Shelley and her friends than with her lover. When Count Guiccioli, constantly scheming to find some way to clear himself of the obligation of paying his wife's allowance as stipulated in the Pope's rescript granting the sepa- ration, finally made the astounding proposal that she should return to him, she replied calmly: \"I must repeat to you that I am perfectly happy in my present situation and I think that no other would ever again suit me. When one has attained the tranquillity I now enjoy, at the cost of so many sacrifices and so much suffering, it is not easy to renounce it.\" n Byron's equanimity was temporarily disturbed by a letter from Hanson, who had examined Lady Noel's will and discovered 5 Cline, pp. 74-5. Teresa in the \"Vie\" says that the only reason Byron did not persist in his intention to put her name on the boat was the fear he would compromise her and annoy her father. (\"Vie\" p. 917.) CHAPTER XXIV: 1821-1822 that she had left Byron's portrait to Ada on condition that it was not to be given her until she was twenty-one.\" He im- mediately imagined that it was the old lady's studied design, perhaps concurred in by Lady Byron herself, to have his daugh- ter's mind poisoned against him.n On Lady Noel's death he had been willing to bury the hatchet. Now he wrote to Hanson that \"some steps must be taken to prevent the Child's mind from being prejudiced against her father, and I beg of you to in- form me what can legally be done to direct her education, so as to prevent her being brought up in a hostile state towards me.\"\" On the afternoon of March 24 an event occurred which dis- rupted the routine of the whole Pisan circle, and which, trifling in itself, had far-reaching reverberations in the lives of Byron and all those associated with him. On this Sunday afternoon, By- ron had been accompanied on his ride to the podere, where the pistol practice took place, by Shelley, Trelawny, Captain Hay, and Pietro Gamba.n They were returning at a leisurely pace along the road to the city, and were about half a mile from the gate when they met Taaffe, who had been riding with a Turkish friend, and who was walking his horse to cool him off before taking him to the stable. He turned about and accompa- nied them. They were four abreast in the front line, Taaffe on the left next the ditch, then Byron, Shelley, and Trelawny, so that they almost completely filled the road. Behind them were Hay and Gamba, and the courier brought up the rear. Some distance ahead was Teresa in her carriage with Mary Shelley. They had, as usual, driven out along the road to the podere in the hope of meeting their cavaliers, and were now returning. Vincenzo Papi, Byron's coachman, was driving the carriage, and Teresa's servant, Antonio Maluccelli,\" rode be- hind. The shooting party had come to within a quarter-mile of the gate when suddenly a horseman came galloping at full speed from behind and passed with a great wind between TaaflEe and the ditch, astonishing him and frightening his spirited horse, which reared and bumped Byron's horse. Taaffe, much agitated and fully occupied in controlling his horse, cried to Byron: \"Have you ever seen the like of that?\" PISA 981 Byron, thinking Taaffe had been jostled or insulted by the rude rider, immediately put spurs to his horse in pursuit of the galloping figure, who, dressed up with gold braid and epau- lets, looked like an officer. The others followed after, with the exception of Taaffe, who had all he could do to calm his mount. Shelley was the first to overtake the soldier, Stefani Masi, a sergeant-major in the Tuscan Royal Light Horse, who was hurry- ing back from dining with a friend in the country in order not to be late for roll call. He slowed up thirty paces in front of the gate, and Shelley passed in front of him and blocked his way. He asked what they wanted, and Shelley replied civilly in Italian: \"Please explain what you mean by your conduct.\" Masi was defiant, and his manner, if not his words, offended the whole party.6 Byron and the others had now come up, and they surrounded the dragoon. Still thinking Masi an officer, By- ron demanded: \"Why have you insulted us in this manner?\" He was greeted with insulting remarks in Italian and French. \"This man is very insolent,\" Byron told Trelawny, and, reaching into his saddlebag, drew out a card, which he handed to a soldier to give to Masi, who said: \"I have no card, but my name is Masi, and I am ready to fight you all, one at a time.\" Byron and Trelawny both issued a challenge to fight the follow- ing day, and, though the Sergeant said nothing, they understood that he accepted. Hay was die only one who saw that he was not an officer, and he urged them to let him go, but in the excitement they paid little heed. While the cards were being passed, Taaffe came up, but lin- gered in the background. When his horse reared, his hat had fallen in the dust, and he took time to recover it and brush it off lest Byron and the others taunt him with having fallen from his horse again. The English party, all on horseback, crowded around Masi and jostled him. One of the group, Masi later said (it was 6 Masi testified that lie said the road was free and that he would pass over it when he wished, but Trelawny said he was heated with wine, and so Shelley was probably right in thinking Masi's language abusive. The dragoon was no doubt exasperated for being taken to task when he felt that these English people were in the wrong for having blocked the road and forced him almost into the ditch. 982 CHAPTER XXIV: 1821-1822 probably Pietro Gamba), struck him across the chest with a riding-whip and called him \"Ignorante.\" In a rage, the Sergeant shouted: \"You are all madmen; you are not sane/' and, wheeling his horse, rode off toward the gate. He turned back and said to Byron and the others: \"If I liked I could draw my sabre and cut you all to pieces, but as it is, I only arrest you,\" and he called to the guards: \"Arrest them all!\" Byron laughed scornfully and shouted to the others: \"Arrest us indeed! Let us ride on,\" and he led the way, spurring his horse through the gate. The others followed, but only Byron and Pietro got through unmolested. Trelawny, Shelley, and Hay found their way blocked by Masi and one or two foot soldiers. Masi had drawn his saber and was slashing right and left. Trelawny parried a few blows and escaped unwounded, but Shelley, coming between them, was knocked from his horse and remained insensible for some time, while Hay was slashed severely on the nose by a saber which cut his walking-stick in two. The courier got such severe blows from the hilt of a saber that he spat blood for weeks thereafter. In the meantime, Byron, galloping down the Lungarno, told Pietro to ride ahead and send Lega Zambelli immediately to the police to report the incident. Pietro found Lega in front of the palace and dispatched him. The next to arrive was the courier, Strauss, who dismounted and rushed into the house. He had re- turned when Byron arrived, and handed him a black sword stick. Byron then started back to look for his companions, followed by Strauss and later by Tita, who had grabbed two cavalry sabers and started running after his master. At that moment die carriage arrived and the hysterical Teresa rushed up the stairway of the palace, shouting: \"Oh God! Oh God!\" Her father followed her, while Mary remained calmly behind to order Maluccelli to carry the news to the Williamses, who had been asked to dine with them that evening. Byron had gone only a short distance when he met Masi, who at sight of him put his hand on his saber. Byron said: \"Don't draw,\" and half drew his sword stick to show that he was armed. Masi said: \"Are you content now "
