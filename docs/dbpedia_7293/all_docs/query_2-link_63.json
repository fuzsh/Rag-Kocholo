        "text": "Dr Simona Di Martino is a 2023/24 MHRA Research Fellow at the University of Warwick.\n\nHer current research focuses on adolescent girls and analyses the ways in which they are represented in media for young people. Simona is interested in studying whether girls have positive and empowered models to look up to in a crucial period of identity formation which is adolescence, and aims to co-create her study with young girls themselves. Her research is not confined to a single country but it rather focuses on the concept of transnational girlhood and involves different media (novels, comics, magazines, TV, social networks).\n\nResearch interests\n\nGirlhood from a Transnational perspective.\n\nChildren's and YA Literature.\n\nComics and Magazines.\n\nWomen's Writings.\n\nWitchcraft.\n\n18th/19th-century Italian Literature.\n\nGothic literature.\n\nReception of Dante's works.\n\nPopular literature and folklore.\n\nFamily novels.\n\nEkphrasis and art history in literature.\n\nShe is currently working on her first monograph, Italian Gothic Poetry: Excess, Abjection, and Dantean Legacy (1789-1816), stemming from her doctoral thesis. She completed her PhD in Italian Studies at the University of Warwick, funded by SMLC Doctoral Fellowship, under the supervision of Professor Fabio CamillettiLink opens in a new window. She is now an Associate Fellow of the IASLink opens in a new window and a Teaching Assistant.\n\nIn 2023 she held a Visiting Research FellowshipLink opens in a new window at the Centre for Contemporary Women's Writing (ILCS, SAS) University of London; a Jeffs Postdoctoral FellowshipLink opens in a new window at the Brotherton Library, University of Leeds; and a Visiting FellowshipLink opens in a new window at the Centre for Book Cultures & Publishing, University of Reading.\n\nCurrent Project\n\nSimona is currently working on representations of the trope of the witch in contemporary Italian culture. She has a twofold interest:\n\nInvestigating the ways in which the figure of the witch successfully embodies female adolescence in contemporary media (magazines, novels, comics, and animated series) for young people, being a role model and representing empowered young girls that are otherwise objectified, neglected and made invisible by society.\n\nExamining American models of girlhood (such as teen-age witches) and how these have been received by the Italian context. Specifically, she is interested in the huge role played by American comics in promoting a new efficient medium to communicate to younger generations and an increasing presence of American culture in Italy.\n\nPhD Thesis\n\nFrom Flesh to Soul: The Dichotomy of the Body in Alfonso Varano, Salomone Fiorentino, and Giacomo Leopardi\n\nMy thesis advocates the existence of a cluster of late eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century Italian poetry, often imperfectly labelled as ‘sepulchral’, focusing on the co-existence between the physicality of death and the religious longing for eternal life. By dynamically relying on Dante’s model and reinstating it within Italian literature, these texts explore the tension between belief and secularisation embodied by the corpse as an object of supreme ‘abjection’ but also of devotional contemplation. I hypothesise the existence of a direct literary lineage running from the works of Alfonso Varano (Visioni sacre e morali, 1789) and Salomone Fiorentino (Elegie in morte di Laura sua moglie, 1790) to Giacomo Leopardi’s early poetic experiments, and particularly to his Dante-inspired poem Appressamento della morte (1816). As a consequence, the study detects a so-far under-investigated strain in Italy’s literary history, enabling a different assessment of young Leopardi’s sources, beyond his overt Dantean inspiration. The research draws on Hans Robert Jauss’ reader’s response theory: texts are analysed as they were their authors’ response, completion, confirmation, refusal to previous works (in relation to one another and to Dante’s oeuvre). My study also pivots around Julia Kristeva’s notion of ‘abjection’, and applies Fred Botting’s concept of Gothic, defined as “writing of excess” which trespasses the rational. This study opens new avenues of investigation, including a re-evaluation of the current literary canon, and a reflection on the outset of the Italian Gothic.\n\nTeaching\n\nLN305 European Gothic - seminars (2023/24)\n\nIT401 Modern Italian Language IV Oral (2024)\n\nIT101 Italian for Beginners (2018/2019)\n\nIT115 The History of Modern Italy - reading group (2018/2019)\n\nIT212 Italian for Historians (2018/2019)\n\nIT317 Introducing Dante's Hell - reading group (2019/20)\n\nIT301 Modern Italian Language III (2019/2020; 2020/2021; 2021/22; 2022/23)\n\nIT101 Grammar, Translation, Writing, Oral (2021/22; 2022/23)\n\nOnline conversation classes for year abroad students (2020)\n\nExtra oral activities in person based on a series of Podcast in Italian that I fashioned \"2 Passi 4 ChiacchiereLink opens in a new window\" (2021)\n\n[organiser] Italian Research Seminar - Death and the birth of a nation: Cemeteries in Nineteenth-Century Italy, by Hannah Malone (University of Groningen).
