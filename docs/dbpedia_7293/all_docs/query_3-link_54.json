These books are intended for a readership including students, graduate students, teachers, scholars and advanced general readers. Each volume will be dedicated either to an individual author or to a group of authors. It will offer a concise reference guide, consisting mainly of entries presented under headwords arranged in alphabetical order. The entries will vary in length from about 10 to about 3,000 words, depending on the significance of the particular topic. The topics will include the literary works, individuals, fictional characters, genres, traditions, events, places, institutions, editors and scholars most relevant to a full and sophisticated understanding and appreciation of the author (or authors) in question. The more substantial entries will include suggestions for further reading, full particulars of which will be supplied in a bibliography. Access to information will be facilitated by extensive cross-referencing. We trust that volumes in this series will be judged by their effectiveness in providing quick, clear and convenient access to reliable and scholarly information. BRIAN G. CARAHER AND E STELLE SHEEHAN Series Editors Queen’s University Belfast\n\nix\n\n10.1057/9780230245419 - The Palgrave Literary Dictionary of Byron, Martin Garrett\n\nCopyright material from www.palgraveconnect.com - licensed to Taiwan eBook Consortium - PalgraveConnect - 2011-03-03\n\nSeries Editors’ Foreword\n\n10.1057/9780230245419 - The Palgrave Literary Dictionary of Byron, Martin Garrett\n\nCopyright material from www.palgraveconnect.com - licensed to Taiwan eBook Consortium - PalgraveConnect - 2011-03-03\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nTo work on a Byron dictionary is to be reminded forcibly of the extraordinary amount of reading, writing and living Byron accomplished during his 36 years. He read history, poetry, novels, travel books, lives; he wrote satire, lyric, drama, parody, tales, speeches, essays, journals, letters, squibs; he knew drinkers, actors, aristocrats, boxers, talkers, poets, politicians, prostitutes, clergymen, servants, Italians, Greeks, Albanians. In life and later he also generated much biography, criticism, editing and research. Complete coverage is impossible, but the dictionary includes entries or references for all but very minor poems and prose works and attempts to provide as much information as space permits on sources, publication, interpretation and reviews. It also focuses on the context of the work in Byron’s reading, relationships and beliefs. His wider cultural impact is registered by entries, some extensive, on his portraits, illustrations of his work, his treatment in fiction, film and drama, and his reception in different countries. There are cross-references for variant titles and for material – poems, people, topics – gathered elsewhere in the dictionary. Reference to most books and articles is by author name and date, with full details provided in the Bibliography. For other references see the list of abbreviations. Anyone studying Byron owes much to Jerome J. McGann’s edition of the Complete Poetical Works, Leslie A. Marchand’s of the Letters and Journals, and Andrew Nicholson’s of the Complete Miscellaneous Prose. I am particularly indebted to McGann’s and Nicholson’s information and suggestions about sources and dating. Marchand’s two biographies of Byron remain invaluable. Useful more recent work includes: Fiona MacCarthy’s Byron: Life and Legend; Caroline Franklin’s Byron: A Literary Life; and the absorbing notes in Andrew Nicholson’s edition of The Letters of John Murray to Lord Byron. Other helpful resources are the Byron Journal and the International Byron Society website (<www. Internationalbyronsociety.org>), with its editions and essays by the tireless Peter Cochran. More personal thanks are due to Christine Corton, John Edmondson, Jennifer Fellows, Robert Inglesfield and, as always, to the supportive Helen, Philip, Lottie and Ed Garrett. My father, Frank Garrett, was also keenly interested in my work; this book is dedicated to his memory.

He was brought here by his mother in 1789 and left following his succession as Lord Byron in 1798. Some of his memories are recorded in the Ravenna Journal (BLJ viii.107–8).\n\n‘Address, Spoken at the Opening of Drury-lane Theatre’ Byron’s couplets for the new theatre. They were delivered by the actor Robert Elliston each night between 10 and 20 October 1812 and published on 12 October in the *Morning Chronicle. The old *Drury Lane theatre had burnt down in 1809. Having refused to enter an address in competiton with others – and following the committee’s controversial rejection of all the other entries – Byron was asked to write one by Lord *Holland. He had some difficulty with the piece, destroying the first draft and submitting five subsequent versions to Holland between 23 September and 2 October. It is to be hoped that ‘our stage’ will ‘unfold/Scenes not unworthy’ the old Drury Lane glories of Sarah *Siddons, David Garrick, ‘Roscius’ (William Henry *Betty) and *Sheridan. The Morning Chronicle itself called the address ‘in parts unmusical, and in general tame’ (see BLJ ii.225). See also: ‘Parenthetical Address by Dr. Plagiary’; Smith, James and Horatio (Horace).\n\n‘Address Intended to be Recited at the Caledonian Meeting’ Poem written probably in May 1814. All but the last six lines (C) were first published in Moore, Life. It was intended as a contribution to the campaign, by the Highland Society of London, for charitable aid for Scottish orphans in London. (The Caledonian Asylum was established by Act of Parliament in 1815 and opened in 1819.) *Scotland was once glorious for repelling invaders; now ‘O’er Gael and Saxon mingling banners shine’ (9). A great number of Scottish soldiers and sailors were involved in the Napoleonic wars which had seemingly ended with *Napoleon’s first abdication on 11 April 1814. 1\n\n10.1057/9780230245419 - The Palgrave Literary Dictionary of Byron, Martin Garrett\n\nCopyright material from www.palgraveconnect.com - licensed to Taiwan eBook Consortium - PalgraveConnect - 2011-03-03\n\nAberdeen\n\n2\n\n‘Adieu. Written under the impression that the author would soon die, The’\n\nPoem written probably in late 1806 or early 1807. (Byron told the Earl of *Clare on 6 Februay 1807 (BLJ i.106), ‘Though my health is not perfectly re-established, I am out of all danger’.) A melancholy leave is taken of *Harrow (‘Ida’), *Cambridge (‘Granta’), the ‘regions of the North’ he should never have left, *Newstead, Mary *Chaworth and John *Edleston. Now the poet must turn to God, who ‘Will not reject a child of dust,/although his meanest care’ (109–10). Part of ‘The Adieu’ was published in Moore, Life, and the whole in 1832.\n\n‘Adieu to the Muse’ The poet’s ‘bosom’ is ‘responsive to rapture no more’ (5). His themes are gone for ever: he cannot love alone; he has little hope of seeing his friends again; and he cannot do justice to the heroic exploits of his ancestors. This ‘Ode expressive of my Intention to relinquish Poesy forever’ was meant, Byron told *Long (BLJ i.118), to ‘conclude my Volume’ (HI). In the event it was first published in 1832. He also claimed that he would give up writing in the preface to HI and, later, in the dedication to Corsair.\n\nAeschylus (525–456 BC) Greek dramatist. Byron translated some lines (526–35, 555–60) of Aeschylus’ Prometheus Bound at *Harrow in December 1804 and published them in FP and related volumes as ‘Fragments of School Exercises, From the Prometheus Vinctus of Aeschylus’. As a boy he was ‘passionately fond’ of the play, and acknowledges, when discussing Manfred with John *Murray, that it ‘has always been so much in my head – that I can easily conceive its influence over all or anything that I have written’ (BLJ v.268). In the same letter he mentions favourably Aeschylus’ Seven before Thebes. See also: ‘Prometheus’.\n\n‘Again deceived! again betrayed!’ see Vaughan, Susan Age of Bronze; Or, Carmen Seculare et Annus Haud Mirabilis, The Verse satire written mostly in December 1822. Originally intended for The *Liberal, it was published separately and anonymously on 1 April 1823 by John *Hunt. Two further editions followed in the same year.\n\n10.1057/9780230245419 - The Palgrave Literary Dictionary of Byron, Martin Garrett\n\nCopyright material from www.palgraveconnect.com - licensed to Taiwan eBook Consortium - PalgraveConnect - 2011-03-03\n\n‘Adieu. Written under the impression that the author would soon die, The’\n\nThe occasion of the poem is the Congress of *Verona, where European leaders met in October–December 1822. Satire is aimed at ludicrous and reactionary royals including *Louis XVIII and Tsar *Alexander I, who has ‘no objection to true liberty,/Except that it would make the nations free’ (442–3) and the ministers, *Wellington among them, ‘who sway the puppets, pull the strings’ (710). Behind such figures are self-interested bankers and the landowners whose ‘good, ill, health, wealth, joy, or discontent,/Being end, aim, religion – Rent, Rent, Rent!’ (632–3). This is the ‘Age of Bronze’ by comparison with the age – silver at least – which preceded it. (The subtitle, ‘secular song for a not at all wonderful year’, is an ironic reference to *Horace’s celebratory poem for the secular, or centennial, games of 17 BC.) That age was *Napoleon’s, and although he is extensively condemned for abandoning his own principles – he ‘burst the chains of millions to renew/The very fetters which his arm broke through’ (256–7) – he is clearly worthy of more sympathy and respect than those who rule after him. He is granted much more space and more tolerance in the poem than any of them; the spirit of freedom he originally championed is alive in *Spain, the former Spanish colonies and *Greece (260–376). (Byron’s main source for his account of Napoleon on St Helena is Barry O’Meara, Napoleon in Exile [1822].) Age is one of Byron’s less-popular works. Readers have often endorsed his description of the poem as ‘in my early English Bards style – but a little more stilted and somewhat too full of “epithets of war” and classical and historical allusions’ (BLJ x.81). Some ‘cryptic condensations of thought’, as Beaty (1985), says, are necessitated by Byron’s desire to ‘achieve succinct comparisons and contrasts’ (p. 176). (Cochran, Age, p. 1, suggests that Byron was in fact writing down to Hunt’s readership, ‘defying his ignorant audience to follow him’.) Inevitably the couplets and stern *Juvenalian manner of the poem have been contrasted with the more flexible and humorous *ottava rima satire of the contemporary DJ. The return to the earlier style and tone was perhaps a conscious answer to criticism of DJ; for the Edinburgh [Scots] Magazine for April 1823 Age ‘demonstrates that, notwithstanding the “devilry” in which the noble author has lately been engaged, and which we hope he has abandoned for ever, the wings of his genius are still unclipped’ (RR v.2212). Beaty ([1985], p. 176) feels that the importance of the poem lies in Byron’s conception of history as ‘a continuum guiding both present and future – a lesson that humanity must learn or be doomed to repeat the errors of the past’.\n\nAlbania Name, in Byron’s time, for much of northern *Greece as well as modern Albania. The area was part of the Turkish Empire but was under the\n\n10.1057/9780230245419 - The Palgrave Literary Dictionary of Byron, Martin Garrett\n\nCopyright material from www.palgraveconnect.com - licensed to Taiwan eBook Consortium - PalgraveConnect - 2011-03-03\n\nAlbania 3\n\n4\n\nAlborghetti, Count Giuseppe\n\nquasi-independent rule of *Ali Pasha when Byron and *Hobhouse travelled in the area in autumn 1809. Few western travellers had preceded them. Albania is described in CHP II.334–692.\n\n(1776–1852) Secretary-General to the Papal Legate in *Ravenna. He gave Byron practical help, even disclosing sensitive political material to him, at a time when Alborghetti might have been expected to be hostile to an associate of the *Gambas and the *Carbonari.\n\nAlbrizzi, Countess Isabella Teotochi (1761?–1836) Aristocratic Venetian hostess, of Corfiote extraction. Byron attended her conversazioni from the autumn of 1816. Her description of the Opere di scultura e di plastica di Antonio Canova had been published in 1809 and *Canova had given her his Helen; Byron wrote ‘On the Bust of Helen by Canova’ on seeing it at her palazzo. In the fourth edition (1826) of her Ritratti the countess remembered Byron as physically striking, changeable and wont to follow his own will. He was also surprisingly shy – possessed of una timidezza costante e quasi infantile (p. 95).\n\nAlbuera, Battle of see Talavera, Battle of Alexander I (1777–1825) Tsar of Russia 1801–25. In Age he is ‘the coxcomb Czar,/The autocrat of waltzes and of war’ (434–5). His theoretical commitment to liberty is belied by his actions in Poland and ambitions for *Greece, which he would gladly free ‘if Greeks would be his slaves’ (445).\n\nAlfieri, Vittorio (1749–1803) Tragic playwright. His spare neoclassical manner had some influence on Byron’s plays, especially Two Foscari. In CHP IV.478–88, he is, with\n\n10.1057/9780230245419 - The Palgrave Literary Dictionary of Byron, Martin Garrett\n\nCopyright material from www.palgraveconnect.com - licensed to Taiwan eBook Consortium - PalgraveConnect - 2011-03-03\n\nAlborghetti, Count Giuseppe\n\nMichelangelo, Galileo and Machiavelli, one of ‘four [Italian] minds, which, like the elements,/Might furnish forth creation’ (487–8). *Hobhouse’s note (CPW ii.236) points up his political significance to Italians – and Byron and Hobhouse – as ‘the bard of freedom’. In August 1819 a production in *Bologna of Alfieri’s tragedy Mirra had a more emotional effect on Byron when, he told *Murray, ‘the two last acts ... threw me into convulsions ... the agony of reluctant tears – and the choaking shudder which I do not often undergo for fiction’ (BLJ vi.206). *Polidori’s father had been Alfieri’s secretary.\n\nAli Pasha (1744?–1822) Albanian ruler. He was provincial governor of *Yanina from 1788. Although nominally subject to the Turkish Sultan he became, by the early nineteenth century, quasi-independent ruler of much of *Albania, northern *Greece and the Peloponnese. He had a justified reputation for ruthlessness and violence. Eventually war broke out between the pasha and the Sultan; Ali was killed at Yanina in 1822 but the effort which it took for the Turks to defeat him was a material aid to the Greek rebellion. Byron and *Hobhouse visited Ali in *Tebelene on 20–2 October 1809. He seems to have been personally taken with Byron, who told his mother that Ali ‘said he was certain I was a man of birth because I had small ears, curling hair, & little white hands ... He told me to consider him as a father’ (BLJ i.227). Some commentators assume that sexual encounters followed. (Lang [1985], pp. 158–61, points out similarities between his reception of Byron and Catherine’s of Juan in DJ IX.337–664.) Whether or not this is so, Ali’s ‘courtesy ... was probably increased by his knowledge that the English forces had just taken the neighbouring Ionian islands of Ithaca, Cephalonia, and Zante [Zakynthos] from the French’ (Marchand, Portrait 72). Cochran (1995) thinks that the British authorities on *Malta may have encouraged Byron and Hobhouse to go to Ali’s court on an informal diplomatic mission. He was ‘much courted by both’ the English and the French (BLJ i.228). Byron was interested by the contrast between the pasha’s hospitable and dignified manner and his ‘real character’ as ‘a remorseless tyrant, guilty of the most horrible cruelties’ (BLJ i.228). He develops the point when he characterizes Ali in CHP II.554–67. Ali is one source for Lambro, the ‘mildest manner’d man/That ever scuttled ship or cut a throat’ (DJ III.321–2) and for Giaffir in Bride.\n\n10.1057/9780230245419 - The Palgrave Literary Dictionary of Byron, Martin Garrett\n\nCopyright material from www.palgraveconnect.com - licensed to Taiwan eBook Consortium - PalgraveConnect - 2011-03-03\n\nAli Pasha 5\n\n6\n\n‘All is Vanity, Saith the Preacher’\n\n‘All is Vanity, Saith the Preacher’\n\nAlpine Journal Journal for Augusta *Leigh. Byron kept it between 17 and 28 (misdated 29) September 1816; extracts were published in Moore, Life, and the whole work in P. It records his impressions on a tour with *Hobhouse in *Switzerland, starting from Villa *Diodati and visiting places including *Chillon, Clarens and the mountains, glaciers and lakes of the Bernese Oberland. There is much about the glory of nature; still in CHP III vein, Byron says, after watching and hearing some shepherds and their music, ‘I have lately repeopled my mind with Nature’ (BLJ v.99). But according to the last entry in the journal nothing he has described has ‘for one moment – lightened the weight upon my heart – nor enabled me to lose my own wretched identity in the majesty & the power and the Glory – around – above – & beneath me’ (BLJ v.105). The suffering results from the crisis of Byron’s separation from Lady *Byron and its aftermath, and aims particularly to excite his sister’s sympathy and continuing love. Another way of coping with or forgetting such feelings, while entertaining Augusta, is comedy. The travellers’ minor doings and misfortunes at times look forward to Jerome K. Jerome’s Three Men in a Boat. ‘H. went to fish – caught one’ (BLJ v.99) and the next day, equally laconically, ‘H. went to fish – caught none’ (100). On 20 September Hobhouse ‘knocked his head against the door – and exclaimed of course against doors’ (100) so that when ‘H. hurt his head against door’ again on 24 (102) it is like a repeated visual gag. The mountain guide tumbles (99), the deaf guide at Chillon roars (98), Byron comes to the assistance of a goat but ‘nearly overset both self & kid into the river’ (100), he and his horse sink in the mud (102). He snowballs Hobhouse (102 – soon after the partly more serious ‘Avalanches falling every five minutes nearly – as if God was pelting the Devil down from Heaven with snow balls’).\n\nAmerica Byron expressed consistently positive feelings towards the United States. In Detached Thoughts he says that he always agrees to meet Americans because\n\n10.1057/9780230245419 - The Palgrave Literary Dictionary of Byron, Martin Garrett\n\nCopyright material from www.palgraveconnect.com - licensed to Taiwan eBook Consortium - PalgraveConnect - 2011-03-03\n\nSong in HM, written in February 1815. ‘Fame, wisdom, love, and power’ have brought no content, no ‘hour/Of pleasure unembittered’. The title and the general sentiment are from Ecclesiastes.\n\nhe respects ‘a people who acquired their freedom by firmness without excess’ and because he feels as if talking to posterity: ‘in a century or two’ the two Americas will probably be ‘masters of the old Countries’ (BLJ ix.17). For examples of his relations with the Americans he met in Italy see BLJ ix.20–1, 162–3, and MacCarthy 330–1, 422–3. He regarded *Washington as one of the most unambiguously heroic of men. He also praised Benjamin Franklin (Age 245–8, 386–7) and Daniel *Boone (DJ VIII.481–536). Because America did not (until 1891) acknowledge international copyright, reprints of Byron’s works were widely disseminated in America soon after first publication. As in continental Europe, they were available much more cheaply than in Britain. St Clair (2004) notes ‘records of about a hundred early American editions of Byron’ (p. 387). The periodical press paid much attention, frequently censorious, to the author’s life, but his ostracism at home seems to have worked in his favour as far as many American readers were concerned. His defenders included John Neal, in the Baltimore magazine The Portico of 1816–18, and Hugh Legaré in the Southern Review of 1828–32. Washington *Irving’s account, in Abbotsford and Newstead Abbey (1835) of *Newstead and the poet’s early life, generously illustrated with quotations, also promoted a favourable impression. Byron exerted a strong influence on the early work of Poe, Melville and Thoreau, and on the conception of *Italy and the old world in Hawthorne’s The Marble Faun and Henry James.\n\n‘L’Amitié Est L’Amour Sans Ailes’ Poem of December 1806, first published in 1831. Friendship and its memory console for the loss of youth. ‘Friendship is Love without his wings’, a French proverb, was Elizabeth Bridget *Pigot’s motto. At fondly remembered *Harrow, where friends included Lycus (James Wynne de Bathe), Byron was ‘In one, and one alone deceived’ (61): George, Earl *Delawarr.\n\nAnacreon (6th century BC) Greek lyric poet. He was wrongly credited with the collection of ancient lovepoems published in 1554 and later known as Anacreontea. Thomas *Moore’s version was published in 1800. Byron wrote four unpublished translations from this material, probably all in 1806 (CPW i.8–11) and included two more in HI. Anacreon is the archetypal poet of love in DJ III.695–6 and XVI.917–19.\n\n10.1057/9780230245419 - The Palgrave Literary Dictionary of Byron, Martin Garrett\n\nCopyright material from www.palgraveconnect.com - licensed to Taiwan eBook Consortium - PalgraveConnect - 2011-03-03\n\nAnacreon 7\n\n8\n\n‘And wilt thou weep when I am low?’\n\nPoem in IT. A lover can no longer feel but is consoled by the fact that his beloved will ‘weep when I am low’. Byron’s corrected fair copy is dated 12 August 1808. CPW i.390 conjectures that it is addressed to Caroline *Cameron. Elizabeth *Pigot copied it into POVO; it was possibly addressed to her, or perhaps to *Edleston or the Duke of *Dorset. ‘There was a time, I need not name’, originally for Dorset, is printed in IT as addressed ‘to the Same’ person as ‘And wilt thou weep’.\n\nAngelo, Henry (1756–1835) Byron’s fencing instructor. He taught Byron first when he was at *Harrow, and visited *Cambridge regularly. In London he shared the boxer John ‘Gentleman’ *Jackson’s Bond Street rooms.\n\nAnimals, Byron’s Byron kept many pets including *Boatswain and other dogs, parrots (Nathan 18–19), the bear he installed in *Cambridge, the three tortoises he brought back from *Greece (BLJ ii.94), and the creatures listed in BLJ vii.208–9: cats, ‘a badger – a falcon, a tame Crow – and a Monkey. – The fox died.’ P. B. *Shelley’s letter to *Peacock (10[?] August 1821) on his visit to Byron in *Ravenna includes most of the same animals plus an eagle, ‘five peacocks, two guinea hens, and an Egyptian crane’. Juan, who also has ‘a kind of inclination, or/Weakness, for what most people deem mere vermin’, travels with ‘A bull-dog, and a bull-finch, and an ermine’ (DJ X.393–7). Byron’s bulldog, Moretto, and his Newfoundland, Lyon, went with him to Greece.\n\n‘Another Simple Ballat’ see ‘Ballad to the Tune of “Sally in Our Alley” ’ ‘Answer to a Beautiful Poem, Written by Montgomery ... Entitled “The Common Lot” ’ Poem asserting the triumph of ‘bright renown’ over oblivion. James Montgomery’s more pessimistic treatment of mortality concludes his The Wanderer of Switzerland, and Other Poems (1806).

John Thomas\n\n(1474–1533) Poet, author of the *ottava rima epic Orlando Furioso. He features as Bard of Chivalry in CHP IV.356–69 and more extensively in Prophecy III.110–18, 149–58: art will ‘seem into Nature wrought/By the transparency of his bright dream’ (117–18). See also the preface to Morgante (CPW iv.247).\n\n‘Aristomenes’ Opening of ‘Canto the First’ of an unfinished poem, dated 10 September 1823. It was written on *Cephalonia. (First publication was in C.) Traditionally Aristomenes was a hero of ancient Messenian resistance to the Spartans; Byron probably intended to develop parallels with the situation of modern Greeks fighting Turkish rule – and perhaps between himself and Aristomenes. The fragment alludes to Plutarch’s story (Moralia 419) of a cry announcing the death of Pan (later interpreted as signalling the arrival of Christianity). The gods have been silent since Pan expired and ‘How much died with him! false or true, the dream/Was beautiful which peopled every stream ... ’ Barton (1968), p. 24, sees this as, unusually in Byron’s work, honouring fiction rather than fact and almost adopting *Keats’s point of view in the opening of Endymion.\n\nArmenian Language studied by Byron in *Venice. Armenian monks, refugees from southern Greece, had been given the island of San Lazzaro (consequently known as San Lazzaro degli Armeni) by the Republic of Venice in 1717. At the monastery here Byron studied the language with Father Paschal Aucher (Harutiun Avgerian in Armenian) mainly between late November 1816 and February or early March 1817. He told *Moore, ‘my mind wanted something craggy to break upon’ (BLJ v.130). In the aftermath of separation and exile, Andrew Nicholson suggests (Prose 335), Byron sought a more challenging distraction ‘from himself than poetry could provide’. Byron had some share (‘the major part’ according to BLJ ix.131) with Aucher in the compilation of his Grammar English and Armenian (1817) and Grammar Armenian and English (1819). He also wrote a preface to the 1819 work which, however, remained unpublished until 1830 (Moore,\n\n10.1057/9780230245419 - The Palgrave Literary Dictionary of Byron, Martin Garrett\n\nCopyright material from www.palgraveconnect.com - licensed to Taiwan eBook Consortium - PalgraveConnect - 2011-03-03\n\nAriosto, Ludovico\n\nLife ii.69n.) because Aucher disliked its overtly political defence of Armenia, ‘an oppressed and noble nation’ (Prose 335, 67). Byron paid for the printing of Grammar English and Armenian but, Aucher’s diary says (Bekaryan [2004], p. 395), he was ‘disheartened’ by the refusal to use his preface, stopped coming to the monastery, and failed to finance the appearance of Grammar Armenian and English. The money was provided instead by Edward Lombe, another of Aucher’s pupils. Byron also undertook one verse and several prose translations from Armenian (CPW iv.110–13; Prose 67–76). His involvement with the language resulted in widespread reading and translation of his own work among the communities of the Armenian diaspora (Bekaryan [2004], p. 397).\n\nArnold, Matthew (1822–88) Poet, critic and social commentator. Arnold’s essay on Byron (1881) finds him sometimes too affected and rhetorical but commends him for his energy, sense of ‘what is beautiful in human action and suffering’ (p. 234) and assault on *‘cant’ (pp. 232–3). He also salutes Byron’s ‘fire’ in ‘Memorial Verses’ (1850), ‘Courage’ (c.1850) and ‘Haworth Churchyard’ (1855); and see his ‘Stanzas from the Grande Chartreuse’ (1855).\n\n‘Art of Praise, The’ Poem probably written in 1814. It was first published, with this title supplied, in CPW. Satirical couplets on the art of praising people for their defects turn, in lines 29–34, to ridicule of the Prince Regent (*George IV), whom one should not praise but ‘Thank and adore, and hear him praise himself’ for his alleged achievements. These have been sung in ‘hymns of special praise’ by *Southey (Carmen Triumphale for the Commencement of the Year 1814).\n\nArtistic taste, Byron’s see Painting and sculpture Athens Greek city. Byron wrote to his mother on 20 July 1810 that it was ‘a place which I think I prefer upon the whole to any I have seen’ (BLJ ii.3). With *Hobhouse he arrived in Athens on 25 December 1809 and lodged with the *Macri family until 5 March 1810 and again briefly in July. For much of the period between mid-August 1810 and late April 1811 he lived at the\n\n10.1057/9780230245419 - The Palgrave Literary Dictionary of Byron, Martin Garrett\n\nCopyright material from www.palgraveconnect.com - licensed to Taiwan eBook Consortium - PalgraveConnect - 2011-03-03\n\n10 Arnold, Matthew\n\n11\n\nCapuchin monastery built around the ancient Monument of Lysicrates, then known as the Lantern of Demosthenes. Here he had (BLJ ii.37) ‘Hymettus before me, the Acropolis behind, the temple of Jove [or Olympieion] to my right ... the town to the left.’ Among the pupils at the small monastery school was Nicolo *Giraud. In CHP II.1–135 ancient Athens represents the glory that has been lost by modern *Greece. Here as in Curse the plunder of the Parthenon frieze adds to the desolation.\n\nAuden, [W]ystan [H]ugh (1907–73) Poet. His prose discussions of Byron value him especially, before the preference became generally accepted, for Beppo, VJ and DJ. His ‘distinctive contribution to English poetry was to be, not the defiant thunder of the rebel angel, but the speaking voice of the tolerant man-about-town’ ([1938], p. 296). Auden’s essay on DJ ([1963], p. 403) argues that the poem is comic rather than satirical and that there is a humanly important place for poetry expressive not of passion or rage but of states in which a man is ‘amused and amusing, detached and irreverent’. In the verse of Letter to Lord Byron (in Letters from Iceland (1937); revised 1966) Auden addresses him in suitably conversational and self-referential style, although not in *ottava rima: it would be ‘proper’ but he would ‘come a cropper’.\n\nAugustanism Term often applied to the work of eighteenth-century neoclassical writers. The original Augustan age was the reign of the Emperor Augustus, when *Horace and *Virgil wrote. In spite of the elements of *Romanticism in his poems, Byron felt a strong allegiance to the Augustans, above all to *Pope.\n\n‘Augustus Darvell’ Fragment of a novel or story by Byron. It was the foundation of *Polidori’s The *Vampyre. At Villa *Diodati in June 1816 it was Byron who, according to Mary *Shelley’s 1831 introduction to Frankenstein, suggested to her, P. B. *Shelley and Polidori, that ‘We will each write a ghost story.’ The untitled fragment represents Byron’s contribution. Darvell who, in the tradition of the *Byronic hero, suffers from ‘some cureless disquiet’ (Prose 59), travels to Turkey with the younger, unnamed narrator. Darvell dies at a remote\n\n10.1057/9780230245419 - The Palgrave Literary Dictionary of Byron, Martin Garrett\n\nCopyright material from www.palgraveconnect.com - licensed to Taiwan eBook Consortium - PalgraveConnect - 2011-03-03\n\n‘Augustus Darvell’\n\nAusten, Jane\n\ncemetery having made the younger man swear that he will not reveal his death and that he will ‘fling’ Darvell’s seal-ring ‘into the Salt Springs which run into the bay of Eleusis’ (62). *Southey’s Thalaba (1801) is the source of some of the oriental details and probably of the ring, but their mystery is increased by transposition into the ‘more realistic context of a journalnarrative’ (Seed [1988], p. 139). According to *Polidori (note in the introduction to Ernestus Berchtold, 1819) the story would have gone on with ‘the remaining traveller returning to his native country’ where he is ‘startled at perceiving his former companion moving about in society, and ... horrified at finding that he made love to his former friend’s sister’. It was only because this scenario was developed into The Vampyre, which was published as Byron’s, that Byron published the fragment with *Mazeppa in 1819. The differences between ‘Augustus Darvell: a Fragment of a Ghost Story’ (as Nicholson calls it in Prose) and Polidori’s tale would show clearly that Byron could not have written the latter. ‘Augustus’ is unfinished probably because he soon tired, as Mary Shelley says, of ‘the platitude of prose’; Seed (1988, p. 146) suggests that he stopped because ‘the journal method had locked him into a narrative with a single perspective and thereby debarred him from the rapid shifts of pace and technique which characterize his verse narratives’. But what we have, brief though it is, is Byron’s most accomplished piece of prose fiction: ‘a compelling story, building up a picture of Augustus Darvell that is never openly sinister. Byron’s prose is complex and sensitive, capable of hints, qualifications, second thoughts and dissimulations, that suggest an almost Jamesian depth of character’ (Wordsworth [1991], p. 180).\n\nAusten, Jane (1775–1817) Novelist. In Persuasion (1817), Chapter 11, Anne Elliot and the melancholy, grieving Captain Benwick discuss the work of Walter *Scott and Byron. They consider ‘how ranked the Giaour and The Bride of Abydos; and moreover, how the Giaour was to be pronounced’. Benwick is ‘intimately acquainted’ with ‘all the impassioned descriptions of hopeless agony’ in Byron. But in fact it is Anne whose situation, masked by her composure, arguably ‘corresponds ... to that of the heart-broken heroes of [Byron’s] tales’ (Knox-Shaw [1993], pp. 51–2). In Chapter 12 there is a reference to ‘Lord Byron’s “dark blue seas” ’ (the ‘dark blue sea’ of the first line of Corsair; Austen mentions having read the poem in a letter of 5 March 1814).\n\n10.1057/9780230245419 - The Palgrave Literary Dictionary of Byron, Martin Garrett\n\nCopyright material from www.palgraveconnect.com - licensed to Taiwan eBook Consortium - PalgraveConnect - 2011-03-03\n\n12\n\n13\n\nByron owned copies (Sale Catalogue 1813, no. 154) of Sense and Sensibility (1811) and Pride and Prejudice (1813), probably sent by John *Murray, who published both authors. Murray asked Byron whether he and Augusta *Leigh admired Emma (1816), but received no reply, and briefly mentioned Austen’s death (Murray, Letters 149, 246). CPW v.680 suggests that he may have sent Byron Persuasion and that Anne’s contrast between female and male lovers in Chapter 23 may have influenced Donna Julia’s ‘Man’s love is of his life a thing apart,/’Tis woman’s whole existence ... ’ (DJ I.1545–6).\n\n10.1057/9780230245419 - The Palgrave Literary Dictionary of Byron, Martin Garrett\n\nCopyright material from www.palgraveconnect.com - licensed to Taiwan eBook Consortium - PalgraveConnect - 2011-03-03\n\nAusten, Jane\n\nB\n\n(1762–1851) Playwright. Byron valued her tragedies highly, especially De Monfort (1798) and Ethwald (1802): see e.g. BLJ iii.109 and the preface to Marino Faliero (CPW iv.305). He attempted unsuccessfully to have De Monfort revived at *Drury Lane in 1815 (BLJ iv.336–7). Brewer (1995, p. 177) argues that Baillie both ‘challenged Byron’s belief that women could not write tragedies’ (cp. BLJ v.203) and inspired him (especially in Sardanapalus) ‘to depict women who act in surprising and sometimes “masculine” ways’.\n\n‘Ballad to the Tune of “Sally in Our Alley” ’ Satirical abuse of Henry Gally Knight (1786–1846) and his poems. The author of Alashtar, an Arabian Tale (1817) ‘rode upon a Camel’s hump/Through Araby the sandy -/Which surely must have hurt the rump/Of this poetic dandy’ (33–6). The piece is a parody of the song by Henry Carey (1687?– 1743), where ‘Of all the girls that are so smart/There’s none like pretty Sally’. Sally is poor but perfect; Gally is rich and a fool. Part of Byron’s poem, with ‘Another Simple Ballat’, which provides further jibes at Gally Knight, was sent to John *Murray in a letter of 11 April 1818 (BLJ vi.27–9). Byron’s longer versions of both ballads were first published in C.\n\nBankes, William (1786–1855) *Cambridge friend of Byron. He was at Trinity College between 1803 and 1808 and came into a considerable fortune on the death of his brother in 1806. Reminiscing to *Murray in November 1820 (BLJ vii.230–1), Byron calls Bankes his ‘collegiate pastor, and master, and patron’, ‘good-naturedly tolerant of my ferocities’ and ‘father of all mischiefs’. MacCarthy 58 suggests that Byron was ‘indoctrinated’ by Bankes into ‘an already thriving subculture of sodomy, with its own rituals and codes’. (He knew *Matthews well.) Allegations of homosexual activity led him to live permanently abroad after 1841. 14\n\n10.1057/9780230245419 - The Palgrave Literary Dictionary of Byron, Martin Garrett\n\nCopyright material from www.palgraveconnect.com - licensed to Taiwan eBook Consortium - PalgraveConnect - 2011-03-03\n\nBaillie, Joanna\n\nBecher, Rev. John Thomas 15\n\nBarff, Samuel see Hancock, Charles Barry, Charles F. (fl. 1822–26) Byron’s banker and friend in *Genoa. He was responsible for the detailed organization of Byron’s journey to *Greece on the brig Hercules in 1823.\n\nBartolini, Lorenzo see Byron, portraits of Bayle, Pierre (1647–1706) French scholar. His Dictionnaire historique et critique aims to expose irrationality in theology and philosophy. Byron owned a copy of the 1734–41 translation of the Dictionary; it was included in Sale Catalogue 1816 (no. 190) but he sent for another from *Murray in 1821 (BLJ viii.238). In Cain Byron’s knowledge of dualism probably comes either from Bayle or from his disciples *Voltaire and *Gibbon (Thorslev [1991], p. 60). Thorslev argues for possible influence also on DJ through what Wolf Z. Hirst (1991b) sums up as Bayle’s ‘stance of disillusioned common sense’ and ‘open-ended, closureresistant irony’ (pp. 9–10).\n\nBecher, Rev. John Thomas (1770–1848) *Southwell friend of Byron and critic of his verse. He was vicar of Rumpton and Midsomer Norton and later a prebendary of Southwell Minster. He was the uncle of Elizabeth and John *Pigot. Becher took an interest in Byron’s early poems, but influenced his decision to suppress FP because ‘one of his descriptions was rather too warmly drawn’ (CPW i.179). This is part of the title of ‘Answer to Some Elegant Verses, Sent by a Friend to the Author’ (POVO, HI), where Byron begins by accepting ‘Your strong, yet just, reproof’\n\n10.1057/9780230245419 - The Palgrave Literary Dictionary of Byron, Martin Garrett\n\nCopyright material from www.palgraveconnect.com - licensed to Taiwan eBook Consortium - PalgraveConnect - 2011-03-03\n\nIn 1812, soon after unsuccessfully proposing marriage to Annabella Milbanke (later Lady *Byron), Bankes began his travels. He became a noted explorer and Egyptologist. In 1819–20, on the way back from one of his expeditions, he was with Byron in *Venice and *Ravenna. Byron told *Murray in August 1820 that ‘Bankes has done miracles of research and enterprize’ (BLJ vii.150).\n\nBeckford, William\n\nbut goes on to mount a vigorous defence of his honest Muse, who will taint no modest maid; the lustful ‘nymph’ would ‘have fallen, tho’ she ne’er had read’. It seems that Becher objected to the public presentation of poems like ‘To Mary’ but was less worried about the author’s private morality. In a letter of February 1808 Byron clearly experiences no difficulty in telling him about his sexual exertions with the ‘blue eyed Caroline’ (BLJ i.157). It is often noted that Becher did not destroy his own copy of FP – one of the four which survive. A fairly close relationship is also suggested by ‘To the Rev. J. T. Becher’ (POVO), according to which Becher advised Byron to ‘mix with mankind’; he replies that he has high ambitions but will not ‘mingle in fashion’s full herd’. See also: ‘Egotism’.\n\nBeckford, William (1759–1834) Author of Vathek, an Arabian Tale (1786). This was one of Byron’s favourite books. He acknowledged it as an influence on Giaour and regarded it as a convincingly eastern work; ‘for correctness of costume, beauty of description, and power of imagination, it far surpasses all European imitations’ (note added to the fourth edition, CPW iii.423). Byron was keenly aware of Beckford’s pariah status since the homosexual scandal of 1784 which had forced him to remain abroad for some years. In June 1809 Byron referred to him in a letter to *Hodgson as ‘the great Apostle of Paederasty’ and ‘the Martyr of prejudice’ (BLJ i.210). In a rejected stanza for CHP I (CPW ii.18) he censured, while lamenting, Beckford’s ‘deed accurst’. A more anodine version was printed as CHP I.275–87. Later Byron wanted (3 March 1818, BLJ vi.17), to see the unpublished ‘remaining tales’ of Vathek, which contained more explicitly homosexual material than the published work. Further reading: Crompton (1985).\n\nBenzon, Countess Marina Querini (c.1758–1839) Venetian hostess. Byron attended her conversazioni in 1818–19. There in April 1819 he saw Teresa *Guiccioli for the second time. He liked Countess Benzon enough to call her ‘a Venetian Lady *Melbourne’ (BLJ vi.96).\n\n10.1057/9780230245419 - The Palgrave Literary Dictionary of Byron, Martin Garrett\n\nCopyright material from www.palgraveconnect.com - licensed to Taiwan eBook Consortium - PalgraveConnect - 2011-03-03\n\n16\n\nBeppo, a Venetian Story 17\n\nComic poem in *ottava rima. The first draft was written probably on 9–10 October 1817 and most of the additions were made between then and January 1818. The first edition was published in mid-March 1818; there were six further editions by the end of the year. (The first four appeared anonymously – see BLJ vi.25.) Stanzas xxviii, xxxviii–xxxix and lxxx were incorporated only in the fourth edition. Steffan (1953) studies the revision process as a whole, demonstrating the precision with which the spontaneous-sounding Beppo was crafted. The plot of Beppo derives from a story told Byron by Pietro Segati, husband of Marianna *Segati, on 29 August 1817, and recorded in *Hobhouse’s diary. A seeming Turk who asks to see the mistress of a Venetian inn proves to be her husband, presumed long ago lost at sea, who has become a rich man in *Turkey. He offers her the choice of going with him, staying with her ‘amoroso’, or living alone on a pension he will provide. Laura in the poem is the equivalent of the mistress of the inn, Beppo of her husband, and the Count of the ‘amoroso’. The story itself, McGann suggests in CPW iv.484–5 (cp. SC vii.246–7), is less important than the scene of – the Venetian manners implied by – Segati telling the tale to his wife’s acknowledged lover. Their liaison, like Byron’s marriage, ‘is always a deliberately invoked halfpresence which is the source and standard for the poem’s genial comedy of manners’. More broadly, Beaty (1985) feels that the Venetian ‘permissive society’ enabled Byron ‘to discard many feelings of guilt relating to his own delinquencies’ and to develop ‘a more sophisticated view of human nature and of the human imperfections on which satire thrives’ (p. 83). Carnival is an analogue for the sexual and narrative straying characteristic of the poem. The ‘Turk’ is actually Beppo masquerading as a Turk (like the other maskers of 18–20); he sheds his Turkish identity almost as rapidly as a mask in 777–80; and Laura emphasizes its external features only – long beard, ‘queer dress’, fingers for fork. In this carnivalized context even ‘With any other women did you wive?’ (730) becomes simply another item in Laura’s list of unimportant questions. (The flippant account of Turkish sexual mores in 555–76 is like a carnival version of the attention to such matters in the *Oriental Tales.) Classical and Shakespearean references are also carnivalized: for example ‘the deep damnation’ not of Duncan’s ‘taking off’ in Macbeth but of the Count’s ‘ “bah!” ’ (254). The name ‘Beppo’, a familiar form of ‘Giuseppe’ (200), also contributes to the atmosphere of informality; in English it has a rather\n\n10.1057/9780230245419 - The Palgrave Literary Dictionary of Byron, Martin Garrett\n\nCopyright material from www.palgraveconnect.com - licensed to Taiwan eBook Consortium - PalgraveConnect - 2011-03-03\n\nBeppo, a Venetian Story\n\ncomical ring, more like a nickname. ‘Laura’ alludes to Petrarch’s unobtainable beloved but is not even her real name (167) and she is much more obtainable – a carnival Laura. The most important literary influence on Beppo was Byron’s reading of John Hookham *Frere’s Whistlecraft and its Italian forebears, particularly *Pulci and *Casti. Byron first read Frere’s poem in September 1817 and described Beppo as an imitation of it (BLJ v.267, 269). The style of Beppo was probably also affected by the imitation of Pulci by John Herman Merivale (1779–1844), which Byron had read in 1814. There are some parallels with Casti’s Novelle, which he read in 1816 (CPW iv.485–8). Another significant influence seems to have been his rereading of *Pope in September 1817 (BLJ v.265). A combination of these sources enabled the ‘adaptation of an Italian conversational form to an English conversational style’ (McGann [1976], pp. 55–6). Equally the poem can be seen (as mentioned already with reference to carnival) as turning the *Oriental Tales ‘inside out’ (Joseph [1964], p. 135). McGann in SC vii.252 builds on Joseph’s observation to say that ‘Heroes like the Count and heroines like Laura imply that anyone can fill a “poetic” role. A “Venetian Tale” in Beppo means a piece of gossip, not a grim or mysterious adventure. Just as anyone is or could be the subject of Venetian gossip, so Beppo makes potential heroes of everyone.’ Readers have inevitably identified the narrator as Byron himself, recently settled in Venice and involved in affairs as scandalous (to English eyes) as that of Laura and the Count. The identification is encouraged, or at least played with, in 295–6 (‘damage and divorces’ as integral to ‘Old England’), 410–16 (‘A broken Dandy lately on my travels’ who writes verse), 624–8 (Lady *Byron’s dreaded ‘mathematics’). But the narrator is only fitfully Byron or an anonymous English traveller. Beaty (1985) argues that ‘The hedonistic and moderately devious narrator, displaying only a relative scale of values, so discredits himself that the traditional norm of satire vanishes’ (p. 102). His ‘digressive manner and preoccupation with trivia defy all the accepted techniques of narration’ (pp. 102–3). Beppo is usually regarded as a turning point in Byron’s work: turning away from the ‘monotony and mannerism’ (BLJ vi.25) of his earlier style and towards DJ in its use of *ottava rima, lists and comic juxtapositions, self-reflexive digression, and satire of England. ‘Digression is a sin, that by degrees/Becomes exceeding tedious to my mind’ (394–5) stands at the mid-point and inevitably prompts two more stanzas of the sin in question – which makes up about half of the poem. Reviews were generally positive. The Monthly Review (March 1818) found the satire sometimes a little vulgar but ‘usually good-humoured and often\n\n10.1057/9780230245419 - The Palgrave Literary Dictionary of Byron, Martin Garrett\n\nCopyright material from www.palgraveconnect.com - licensed to Taiwan eBook Consortium - PalgraveConnect - 2011-03-03\n\n18 Beppo, a Venetian Story\n\nwell pointed’ (RR iv.1787). *Jeffrey in the *Edinburgh Review (February 1818) delighted in this ‘thing of nothing’ and the ‘matchless facility’ with which it versifies ‘the unmingled, unconstrained, and unselected language of the most light, familiar, and ordinary conversation’ (RR ii.889). Frere, surprised at Byron’s new manner, found in Beppo ‘the protean talent of Shakespeare – thus to assume at will so different a character’ (Murray, Letters 251). The near-absence of attacks on individuals in the poem (*Sotheby is an exception) made such praise easier; Frere and others who delighted in Beppo objected to the harder-hitting DJ. Further reading: Drummond Bone in Bone (2004); McGann (1968); Vassallo (1984).\n\nBerlioz, Hector (1803–69) French Romantic composer. His symphonic Harold en Italie (1834) takes CHP IV as its inspiration or point of departure.\n\nBerni, Francesco (1497/98–1535) Tuscan poet. His reworking of Matteo Boiardo’s *ottava rima epic Orlando innamorato was published in 1542. Byron gives him honourable mention but seems to have had less detailed knowledge of his work than of *Pulci’s. On 25 March 1818 he told John *Murray, with reference to Beppo, that ‘Berni is the Original of all’ (BLJ vi.24), but by February 1820 was giving priority as ‘parent ... of all jocose Italian poetry’ to *Pulci (BLJ vii.42; cp. Advertisement to Morgante). Ogle (1973) attributes the change to Byron’s reading, probably in 1820, of *Ginguené’s Histoire littéraire d’Italie, where the poets are discussed in more detail than in his earlier preferred guide, *Sismondi’s De la littérature du midi de l’Europe.\n\nBetty, William Henry (1791–1874) Teenage actor known as ‘the Young Roscius’. (Roscius was a well-known Roman actor.) He was much talked about in 1804–05. Byron thought him ‘tolerable in some characters, but by no means equal to the ridiculous praises showered upon him by John Bull’ (BLJ i.67). Elledge (2000), p. 93, suggests that Byron was, nevertheless, interested in him as ‘a lad of about the age,\n\n10.1057/9780230245419 - The Palgrave Literary Dictionary of Byron, Martin Garrett\n\nCopyright material from www.palgraveconnect.com - licensed to Taiwan eBook Consortium - PalgraveConnect - 2011-03-03\n\nBetty, William Henry 19\n\n20\n\nBible\n\nBible Christian sacred book. Byron told John *Murray in October 1821 that he was ‘a great reader and admirer’ of the Bible and had read it ‘through and through before I was eight years old – that is to say the old Testament – for the New struck me as a task – but the other as a pleasure’ (BLJ viii.238). He remained interested in the Old Testament (see e.g. BLJ iv.60), psalms and stories from which provide the back-bone of HM, Cain and Heaven and Earth. In the last two works and frequently elsewhere, Byron wrestles with the Fall; Genesis is the biblical book most often referred to in his poems. St Matthew’s Gospel is the second most popular, followed by Psalms and Isaiah. He told *Parry that he read a chapter of the Bible every day (HVSV 569). In various contexts Byron quotes, casually alludes to, or parodies the Bible. (Looper [1978] provides useful lists of references but their value is sometimes decreased by the inclusion of phrases and expressions which, although of biblical origin, had become an established part of the language.) The best-known parody is of the Ten Commandments (Exodus 20.3–17; Deuteronomy 5.6–21) in DJ I.1633–45, which caused much anger among the orthodox. Both the serious and the flippant approach to biblical material came easily to him: one of his favourite pieces, Psalm 137, was given two serious treatments – ‘In the Valley of Waters’ and ‘By the Rivers of Babylon We Sat Down and Wept’ – and its first few lines were parodied as ‘By the waters of Cheltenham I sate down & drank ... ’ (BLJ ii.192; cp. DJ II.xvi). Further reading: Hirst (1991b).\n\nBlackett, Joseph see ‘Epitaph for Mr. Joseph Blackett, Late Poet and Shoemaker’ Blake, William (1757–1827) Poet and artist.

Byron disliked Betty’s adult appearance and acting. He told Lord *Holland that ‘His figure is fat, his features flat, his voice unmanageable, his action ungraceful’ and Lady *Melbourne that ‘his figure is that of a hippopotamus ... his voice the gargling of an Alderman with the quinsey’ (BLJ ii.192, 193).\n\nBlessington, Marguerite Gardiner, Countess of\n\n21\n\nBlaquiere, Edward (1779–1832) Founder member, with *Bowring, of the *London Greek Committee. He was a disciple of Jeremy Bentham and had witnessed and written about the revolutionary conflict in *Spain before becoming involved in the Greek cause. On 5 April 1823, with Andreas Louriotis, a representative of the provisional Greek government, he visited Byron in *Genoa. Byron told them that he was willing to go to Greece if the government ‘think that I can be of any use’ (BLJ x.142). Then and thereafter Blaquiere gave Byron a highly optimistic account of the situation in Greece. In 1825 he published Narrative of a Second Visit to Greece: including facts connected with the last days of Lord Byron.\n\nBlessington, Marguerite Gardiner, Countess of (1789–1849) Author of Conversations of Lord Byron. Following her marriage to Charles Gardiner, Earl of Blessington (1782–1829), in 1818, she presided over a circle of literary and political men, many of them known to Byron. Her beauty had been made famous by Sir Thomas Lawrence’s portrait, shown at the Royal Academy in 1821. She was, however, excluded from the society of respectable ladies because of her chequered past, in Ireland and England, as what she called ‘that despised thing, a kept mistress’ (Blessington, Conversations, introduction 12). Byron met the Blessingtons and their companion Count Alfred D’Orsay in *Genoa on a number of occasions (see Conversations 35n.) between April and June 1823. Byron addressed her in ‘To the Countess of Blessington’ (‘You have asked for a Verse ... ’). Her Journal of Conversations of Lord Byron was serialized in the New Monthly Magazine in 1832–33 and published in one volume in 1834. Some of her encounters with Byron feature also in her Idler in Italy (1839–40). Conversations concentrates on Byron’s appearance and dress, his opinions of friends, love of gossip, detestation of *cant, and particularly his shifting\n\n10.1057/9780230245419 - The Palgrave Literary Dictionary of Byron, Martin Garrett\n\nCopyright material from www.palgraveconnect.com - licensed to Taiwan eBook Consortium - PalgraveConnect - 2011-03-03\n\nlife that leads to death’ in Cain II.ii.18–19 Blake opposes belief in a merciful Jehovah and the true life of Eternity. ‘Can a poet doubt the visions of Jehovah?’ For Blake, Byron ‘was a potential poet-prophet destroyed by his allegiance to false gods of realism and rationality: a man clinging to a world of fact when he should look beyond it’ (Barton [1968], p. 4).\n\nBlues, A Literary Eclogue, The\n\nand paradoxical view and presentation of himself. ‘He claimed admiration not only for his genius, but for his defects, as a sort of right that appertained solely to him’, was aware of this weakness and was offended if anyone detected it (227–8). She exaggerates the degree of her intimacy with Byron and her record must always be received with some scepticism. For Moore (1961) Lady Blessington’s was ‘the first of the patronizing biographies’ (p. 459). Yet in 1844 *Hobhouse said that it was ‘very fair and faithful’ (Broughton [1909–11], vi.104).\n\nBlues, A Literary Eclogue, The Satirical poem in two ‘Eclogues’. It was written in August 1821 and sent to *Murray, but eventually published by John *Hunt in The Liberal in April 1823. The setting is outside, and then after, a lecture by ‘Scamp’ – evidently S. T. *Coleridge, two of whose lectures Byron attended in 1811–12. Satire is directed against the Lake poets ‘Wordswords’ and ‘Mouthey’ (*Southey) and at *Sotheby as Botherby. In the second eclogue the bluestockings themselves appear: the mathematical Miss Lilac is meant for Lady *Byron and Lady Bluemount for Lady Beaumont (Margaret [1756–1829], wife of Sir George Beaumont. The Beaumonts were art patrons and friends of *Wordsworth). The hosts, the Bluebottles, broadly correspond to Lord and Lady *Holland. Inkel has often been taken for Byron himself and Tracy for *Moore, but Vail (2001), p. 203 n. 1, shows clearly that Inkel is Moore and Tracy Byron. Byron often expressed his antipathy for educated women (e.g. BLJ iii.221, 228; DJ I.73–112, XI.393–424) yet ‘was always drawn to women who were well read’ (DJV iv.26) including his wife, Lady *Oxford and Teresa *Guiccioli.\n\nBoatswain (1803–08) Byron’s Newfoundland dog, subject of a verse epitaph. Boatswain is first heard of in 1806. He went mad and died, tended by his master, in November 1808. Byron wrote ‘Inscription on the Monument of a Newfoundland Dog’ on 20 November; like the prose inscription which precedes it on the monument at *Newstead (CPW i.391–2), it contrasts canine loyalty with human untrustworthiness. In a draft will of 1811 Byron said that he wished to be buried with ‘my faithful dog’ in ‘the vault of the garden of Newstead’ (Marchand, Biography 286–7).\n\n10.1057/9780230245419 - The Palgrave Literary Dictionary of Byron, Martin Garrett\n\nCopyright material from www.palgraveconnect.com - licensed to Taiwan eBook Consortium - PalgraveConnect - 2011-03-03\n\n22\n\nBoone, Daniel 23\n\n(1313–75) Author of The Decameron. CHP IV.498–9 and 514–22 protest at the absence from Santa Croce in *Florence of the tomb of this ‘Bard of Prose, creative spirit! he/Of the Hundred Tales of love’ (The Decameron). In DJ III.934–5 and 941–4 Byron refers to Boccaccio’s story of Nastagio degli Onesti (Decameron V.viii), set in *Ravenna, and *Dryden’s version Theodore and Honoria; cp. BLJ vi.166, 168, 181, viii.48.\n\nBolivar, The Byron’s schooner. It was built in *Genoa by Captain Daniel Roberts in 1822. (Roberts also built P. B. *Shelley’s smaller boat, the Don Juan.) *Trelawny was the captain. According to Edward *Williams’s journal for 13 June 1822, ‘she costs Lord Byron 750£ clear off & ready for sea, with provisions and conveniences of every kind’ (Jones [1951], p. 154). But in May 1823 Byron sold the Bolivar to Lord Blessington for 400 guineas. He had difficulty collecting the payment, which he was still seeking in what may be his last letter (9 April 1824, BLJ xi.153). Simón Bolívar (1783–1830), the South American ‘Great Liberator’, is mentioned in Age 252 and 383.\n\nBologna Italian city. Traditionally it, and particularly its paintings, featured on the Grand Tour. Byron visited briefly in April 1817, June 1819, and on several other occasions, and lived here in August and September 1819. On his first visit he was epigrammatic about this city ‘celebrated for the production of Popes – Cardinals – painters – & sausages’ (BLJ v.231). In June 1819 he mentions the ‘superlative’ painters Domenichino and Guido Reni but is moved much more by the tombs and skulls of the cemetery of the Certosa, as again later in the year (BLJ vi.148–9, 217).\n\nBonaparte, Napoléon see Napoleon Bonaparte Boone, Daniel (1734–1820) American pioneer, idealized in DJ VIII.481–536. The account of his peaceful way of life, killing only ‘bear or buck’ in ‘wilds of deepest maze’, interrupts the sack of *Ismail.\n\n10.1057/9780230245419 - The Palgrave Literary Dictionary of Byron, Martin Garrett\n\nCopyright material from www.palgraveconnect.com - licensed to Taiwan eBook Consortium - PalgraveConnect - 2011-03-03\n\nBoccaccio, Giovanni\n\n24 ‘Bouts-rimés from Seaham’\n\nRecord of a rhyming-game played by Byron and Lady *Byron in late January or February 1815. In 1816 she remembered the verses as made ‘with that sort of mirth which seeks to jest away bitter truths’ (Elwin [1962], p. 275). Most of the lines suggest, apparently humorously, differences and tensions between the two.\n\nBorgia, Lucrezia see Milan ‘Bosworth Field’ Lost early poem on the battle of 1485. Byron completed several hundred lines of it in summer 1807 (BLJ i.131, 132).\n\nBowles, Rev. William Lisle (1762–1850) Poet and editor of *Pope, attacked by Byron. His sonnets, of which there were nine editions between 1789 and 1805, were admired by S. T. *Coleridge. In EBSR 330–84 Byron attacks Bowles for the strictures on Pope in his 1806 edition of the poet, his work as ‘The maudlin prince of mournful sonneteers’ (330) and his longer poem The Spirit of Discovery (1805). (The lines on Bowles’s Pope in the first edition are by *Hobhouse, replaced in the second edition by Byron’s own 363–84.) Byron later wrote against Bowles, and in particular his belief in the inferiority of ‘artifical’ poets including Pope, in Letter to John Murray (1821). Bowles replied in Two Letters to the Right Honourable Lord Byron ... (1821). Byron then wrote, but did not publish, ‘Observations upon Observations’.\n\nBowring, John (1792–1872) Secretary of the *London Greek Committee. Bowring was a political radical and a disciple of Jeremy Bentham. ‘He was energetic in managing the affairs’ of the committee, ‘though sometimes, like Colonel *Stanhope, a little too doctrinaire in his expectations of the Greeks’ (Leslie A. Marchand in BLJ x.210). He was also an accomplished linguist; in *Greece in 1823–24 Byron read at least some of his translated Specimens of the Russian Poets (BLJ xi.85, 147).\n\n10.1057/9780230245419 - The Palgrave Literary Dictionary of Byron, Martin Garrett\n\nCopyright material from www.palgraveconnect.com - licensed to Taiwan eBook Consortium - PalgraveConnect - 2011-03-03\n\n‘Bouts-rimés from Seaham’\n\nBrandreth, Jeremiah\n\n25\n\n(fl. 1815–21) Actress at *Drury Lane theatre. Byron had a brief affair with her in late 1815, at the height of his marital problems. When she wrote asking for money in 1821 he told *Kinnaird to advance her some money; and that when he knew her he was ‘in such a state of mind & body – that all carnal connection was quite mechanical & almost as senseless to my senses as to my feelings of imagination’ (BLJ viii.185).\n\nBoxing see Jackson, John ‘Gentleman’ Braham, John (1777?–1856) Well-known singer, associated with *Drury Lane. His name appears with *Nathan’s on the title-page of N1815 (and its successors up to 1824) because Braham had proposed ‘singing the melodies in public, and to assist me in the arrangement of them, on condition of my giving him an equal share in the publication’ (Nathan viii). Nathan’s remark that Braham had been prevented ‘from fulfilling his engagement to me’ (Nathan viii) probably means that the public performance did not take place.\n\n‘Bramblebear and Lady Penelope’ Byron’s opening letter for an unfinished epistolary novel. The title is Andrew Nicholson’s (Prose 46, 315). It was written probably in November 1813 and was originally intended as the beginning of a joint novel by Byron and *Dallas. Dallas later incorporated it, with minor changes, in his novel Sir Francis Darrell; or, The Vortex (1820). The letter is from Darrell, a cynical observer who claims to find women inferior but to be ‘always the slave of some only one’; he is interested by Lady Penelope who, he feels, detests her husband, despises another suitor, ‘and loves – herself’ (Prose 47–8). The piece clearly alludes to Byron’s pursuit of Lady Frances *Webster. Lady Penelope corresponds to her, the ridiculous Bramblebear to her husband Sir James Wedderburn Webster, and Darrell to Byron.\n\nBrandreth, Jeremiah (1790?–1817) Leader of the ‘Pentrich uprising’, a revolution attempted by Midlands workers. He was executed for high treason in Derby on 7 November 1817.\n\n10.1057/9780230245419 - The Palgrave Literary Dictionary of Byron, Martin Garrett\n\nCopyright material from www.palgraveconnect.com - licensed to Taiwan eBook Consortium - PalgraveConnect - 2011-03-03\n\nBoyce, Susan\n\nOn 23 October Thomas Denman, unsuccessfully defending Brandreth’s co-accused, Isaac Ludlam, read extracts from Corsair (I.61–186, 193–226, with some omissions and misquotations) because there he claimed to find Brandreth ‘wonderfully depicted’: ‘the commanding qualities of his powerful but uncultivated mind, and the nature of his influence over those that he seduced to outrage’ (The Trials of Jeremiah Brandreth ... and Others, for High Treason [1817], ii.235–7). This use of Corsair suggests its popularity and also perhaps its potential for association with radical causes. Further reading: Manning (1990).\n\nBride of Abydos. A Turkish Tale, The The second of Byron’s *Oriental Tales. It was written mainly in early November 1813 and published in late November or early December. There were ten editions in 1813–14 and one in 1815. The pasha Giaffir mocks his ‘son’ Selim for unmanliness and announces to his beloved daughter Zuleika her marriage to an older man, Osman Bey. But Zuleika’s expression of undying devotion to Selim prompts him to declare that she is ‘mine, for ever mine’. In the second canto he reveals to her that he is not her brother but her cousin and, secretly, the leader of a pirate band. He intends to marry her but Giaffir and his men arrive, Zuleika dies of grief because she cannot save Selim, and Selim, turning fatally to look for her, is killed. Sources of Bride include Byron’s experience of eastern moeurs and knowledge of eastern history, accuracy about which he is keen to stress in the notes. (The notes also complicate responses to the poem, counterpointing its romantic excesses with prose explanation and dry wit and exposing its constructed, literary nature.) He drew on his encounters with *Ali Pasha in his depiction of Giaffir. Literary sources include Ovid’s Heroides xviii–xix, where another doomed love, that of Hero and Leander, is enacted by the shores of Sestos and Abydos; Hamlet – the relationship between Claudius and Hamlet reflected in Giaffir and Selim; and Romeo and Juliet – Selim loves his enemy’s daughter and with her reads ‘Mejnoun and Leila, the Romeo and Juliet of the East’ (note to I.72) in the Gulistan of the Persian poet Sadi. The plot of John Brown’s tragedy Barbarossa (1754) is another possible influence (Cochran [2006], pp. 58–9). The incestuous nature of the love between Selim and Zuleika is often taken as a reflection of relations between Byron and Augusta *Leigh. As far as the first-time reader of Canto I is concerned, the characters are\n\n10.1057/9780230245419 - The Palgrave Literary Dictionary of Byron, Martin Garrett\n\nCopyright material from www.palgraveconnect.com - licensed to Taiwan eBook Consortium - PalgraveConnect - 2011-03-03\n\n26 Bride of Abydos. A Turkish Tale, The\n\nbrother and sister. Byron said (BLJ iii.199) that only ‘the times and the North’ made him ‘confine them to cousinship’. Anxiety about incest (and the frustrating end of his relationship with Lady Frances *Webster) partly explains his statement that writing the poem ‘wrung my thoughts from reality to imagination – from selfish regrets to vivid recollections’ of the east (BLJ iii.230–1; cp. iii.157). But there are, as Byron told E. D. Clarke (BLJ iii.199), abundant literary sources for incest, and the situation is not particularly close to his own: hero and heroine have known each other well since childhood. This intimacy allows exploration of gender in the Canto I role-reversals between seemingly effeminate Selim, ‘ Pale – mute – and mournfully sedate’ (I.256; cp. 81–100) and the more vigorous Zuleika. The heroine has often been found more interesting than the hero. Byron ‘wished to try my hand on a female character in Zuleika’ – Leila in Giaour is undeveloped – and ‘endeavoured as far as ye. grossness of our masculine ideas will avail – to preserve her purity without impairing the ardour of her attachment’ (BLJ iii.199). Partly for this reason she seems unaware of the erotic potential of her manner towards Selim in Canto I – a manner which caused some offence among contemporary reviewers (see Franklin [1992], p. 56) – and has very little to say after he declares himself in Canto II. She has often been discussed as the passive victim of a society dominated by men: dweller in an Orient whose attitudes to women are frozen in time, and in a tower full of ‘ “feminine” material luxuries irrelevant to “masculine” warfare, yet amassed to testify to the Pacha’s status’ (Franklin [1992], p. 50). Giaffir and Selim fight to possess her, one claiming the right to dispose of her in a politically advantageous arranged marriage, the other with an equally clear plan for her future (II.395–425). In Bride the characters inhabit a world where ‘all, save the spirit of man is divine’ (I.15; cp. Gleckner [1967], p. 122–3). They do not have the control over others and themselves which they think they have. The open-hearted, playful Zuleika of Canto I is almost paralysed with shock in Canto II. Giaffir, so authoritative in Canto I, misjudges Selim and is diminished for the reader by his revelation as a poisoner stained by ‘a brother’s murder’ (II.236–45, 254). He is unable to control his family without destroying his beloved daughter and so himself. He has lost, moreover, ‘a valuable means of exchange of power with other men in the feudal system’ (Franklin [1992], p. 51). The sensitive Selim becomes more one-dimensionally masculine and is easily defeated in spite of his plans for a life of victorious raiding. (Leask [1992] studies what he sees as both Selim’s and the poem’s political\n\n10.1057/9780230245419 - The Palgrave Literary Dictionary of Byron, Martin Garrett\n\nCopyright material from www.palgraveconnect.com - licensed to Taiwan eBook Consortium - PalgraveConnect - 2011-03-03\n\nBride of Abydos. A Turkish Tale, The 27\n\n‘Bridegroom, A’\n\nfailure: ‘the suppressed knowledge that effective resistance to tyranny is the prerogative of a more radical political ideology, like that of Lambro’s [see II.379–87] patriot band’ [p. 43].) The Ovidian notion of transformation into an ever-blooming ‘mourning flower’ or bird (II. 670–716) provides some element of consolation. What remains in another sense – as Homer’s ‘immortal dreams’ are the most important remains of Priam’s reign (II.25–7) – is Bride itself: ‘Sorrow’s tale’ (II.732) or the melancholy song whose listeners ‘cannot leave/The spot, but linger there and grieve/As if they loved in vain!’ (II.697–8). Contemporaries felt the song worth singing in a number of versions including the dramatic pieces Selim and Zuleika (1815), The Bride of Abydos, a Tragick Play (1818) by William Dimond with music by Michael Kelly (1818), and a play by W. O[xberry] ‘founded upon’ Bride and Corsair (1818). Further reading: Watkins (1987).\n\n‘Bridegroom, A’ Humorous poem, first published in CPW. A bridegroom, for all his devotion to his young wife, cannot resist the charms of ‘a certain black-eyed fair,/ Lovely Anne!’ Presumably because the subject is adultery, Jerome J. McGann in CPW iii.476 says that ‘the lines undoubtedly date from 1815’ – from the time of Byron’s marriage. Perhaps, therefore, this is ‘a slightly transformed narrative of Byron’s feelings for Susan *Boyce’.\n\n‘Bright Be the Place of Thy Soul’ Song incorporated in editions of HM from 1819. It was first published as ‘Stanzas’ in the Examiner on 11 June 1815 and then as a song-sheet by *Nathan. Its burden is that we should not mourn for ‘the blest’. Burwick and Douglass (1988), p. 28, suggest that the piece remembers *Edleston, but the sentiment seems fairly generalized.\n\nBrighton Fahionable seaside town. Byron visited in July–August 1808. He brought Caroline *Cameron here, gambled with Scrope *Davies and others (BLJ iv.256–7), and met John *Cowell. Between 1815 and 1823 John Nash transformed the Brighton residence of the Prince Regent (*George IV from 1820) into the exotically oriental Pavilion. Byron alludes to it in Sardanapalus\n\n10.1057/9780230245419 - The Palgrave Literary Dictionary of Byron, Martin Garrett\n\nCopyright material from www.palgraveconnect.com - licensed to Taiwan eBook Consortium - PalgraveConnect - 2011-03-03\n\n28\n\nBrougham, Henry 29\n\nI.ii.1 and, more directly, in DJ XIV.663–4: ‘Shut up – no, not the King, but the Pavilion,/Or else ’twill cost us all another million’.\n\n(1816–55) Novelist. She was greatly influenced by Byron’s life and work, most clearly in her juvenilia and Jane Eyre (1847). The passionate, seductive Duke of Zamorna in the Glass Town and Angria saga which she wrote with her brother Branwell (1817–48) is essentially a *Byronic hero. Rochester in Jane Eyre inherited Zamorna’s ‘Byronic glamour’, volatility and secrets, and ‘more directly from the Byron of Childe Harold his despairing wanderlust’ as described in Chapter 24 (Alexander and Smith [2006], p. 272). Jane’s robust attitude to Rochester suggests, however, a more critical approach to Byronic figures than in some of Brontë’s earlier writing. Branwell, contrastingly, ‘never seems to have relinquished his obsession with Byron’ (Alexander and Smith [2006], p. 114).\n\nBrontë, Emily (1818–48) Novelist and poet. Byronic characters feature in the Gondal saga which she wrote in association with her sister Anne (1820–49). Most attention, however, has centred on Heathcliff in Wuthering Heights (1847) as a form of *Byronic hero. Like Byron’s Conrad, as the Examiner noted in January 1848, he is ‘Link’d with one virtue, and a thousand crimes’ (Corsair III.696). Further reading: Alexander and Smith (2006); Elfenbein (1995).\n\nBrougham, Henry (1778–1868) Lawyer and politician, Byron’s enemy (later Lord Brougham). He was a founder of the *Edinburgh Review, for which (January 1808) he wrote a mockingly hostile review of HI. Byron thought the reviewer was *Jeffrey, but ridiculed Brougham also in EBSR 524–5. Byron’s dislike of Brougham came to a head when, in 1817, he heard that during and after the separation crisis Brougham had circulated malicious rumours about his finances and his sexuality. Byron pilloried him in seven unpublished stanzas originally meant for DJ I (CPW v.85–8) and intended to fight a duel with him (BLJ vii.95–6).\n\n10.1057/9780230245419 - The Palgrave Literary Dictionary of Byron, Martin Garrett\n\nCopyright material from www.palgraveconnect.com - licensed to Taiwan eBook Consortium - PalgraveConnect - 2011-03-03\n\nBrontë, Charlotte\n\n30 Broughton, John Cam Hobhouse, Lord\n\nBroughton, John Cam Hobhouse, Lord see Hobhouse, John Cam (Lord Broughton)\n\n(fl. 1821–34) Scottish philhellene. He was involved in the negotiation of the British government loan to *Greece. Browne joined Byron in Livorno in July 1823 and travelled with him to Cephalonia, leaving for the Greek mainland with *Trelawny in September 1823. He returned in November with the Greek deputies Ioannis Orlandos and Andreas Louriotis and helped arrange Byron’s loan of £4,000 to them. His ‘Voyage from Leghorn [Livorno] to Cephalonia with Lord Byron’ was published in Blackwood’s Edinburgh Magazine in January 1834.\n\nBrowning, Elizabeth Barrett (1806–61) Poet. She was already reading Byron during her precocious childhood: Corsair in 1817, for instance, and CHP IV in 1818. Byron was a strong influence on her ‘Leila’ (1822) and in 1824 she published ‘stanzas on the Death of Lord Byron’, mourning ‘Britannia’s Poet! Graecia’s hero.’ Her view in maturity was that because of his incompleteness, his ‘one-sided passionateness’, his poems ‘discovered not a heart, but the wound of a heart; not humanity, but disease; not life, but a crisis’; *Wordsworth’s approach is contrastingly thoughtful and feeling (The Book of the Poets, 1842). On 30 December 1844 Elizabeth Barrett told Mary Russell *Mitford, ‘I want to write a poem of a new class ... a Don Juan, without the mockery and impurity.’ The work which most closely fulfils this ambition is Aurora Leigh (1857).\n\nBrowning, Robert (1812–89) Poet. Browning read Byron in his childhood or early teens and could still quote from him extensively in old age. The mostly lost Incondita (c.1826) was written under his influence. Browning told Elizabeth Barrett (*Browning) on 22 August 1846 that in youth he would have travelled miles for a sight of ‘a curl of his hair or one of his gloves’ (Browning and Browning [1984–], xiii.280). This admiration was largely displaced by interest in P. B. *Shelley. But the fragmentary, gradual self-revelation of the speakers in Giaour perhaps\n\n10.1057/9780230245419 - The Palgrave Literary Dictionary of Byron, Martin Garrett\n\nCopyright material from www.palgraveconnect.com - licensed to Taiwan eBook Consortium - PalgraveConnect - 2011-03-03\n\nBrowne, James Hamilton\n\nBurns, Robert\n\n31\n\nhad some effect on the technique of Browning’s dramatic monologues. In later work he shows some hostility to Byron, partly, it seems, in anger at Alfred Austin’s unfavourable comparison of him and other modern poets with Byron in The Poetry of the Period (1870).\n\n(c.1800–?) Byron’s personal physician in *Greece from 1823 to 1824. He had recently qualified at the university of Genoa. Like Dr *Millingen he insisted on bleeding Byron during his final illness. Bruno accompanied the body to England.\n\nBulwer-Lytton, Edward (Lord Lytton) (1803–73) Novelist, politician and dandy. Elfenbein (1995), pp. 212–18, argues that Bulwer and *Disraeli established themselves in society by imitating what was considered Byron’s ‘effeminacy’; they exploited, without betraying, the ‘open secret’ of his homsosexuality. Such novels as Bulwer’s Pelham: or the Adventures of a Gentleman (1828) are ‘narratives of transition away from Byron’ (Elfenbein [1995], p. 219), from characters associated with Byronic transgression and political failure to characters who achieve heterosexual marriage and political success. In 1824 Bulwer acquired another connection with Byron when he and Lady Caroline *Lamb became lovers.\n\nBurns, Robert (1759–96) Scottish poet, farmer and excise officer. Had he been a patrician ‘We should have had more polish – less force – just as much verse, but no immortality’ (BLJ iii.207). Having seen some unpublished letters by Burns, ‘full of oaths and obscene songs’, Byron noted on 13 December 1813, ‘What an antithetical mind! – tenderness, roughness – delicacy, coarseness – sentiment, sensuality – soaring and grovelling, dirt and deity – all mixed up in that one compound of inspired clay!’ (BLJ iii.239). It was a compound which Byron perhaps recognized in himself (Low [1992], p. 129). Burns is also briefly mentioned in EBSR 777 and 812. In Letter to John Murray (Prose 150) Byron credits Burns as ‘the very first of his Art’, but implies that his art itself – a tale, a descriptive sketch, songs – ranks lower than *Pope’s.\n\n10.1057/9780230245419 - The Palgrave Literary Dictionary of Byron, Martin Garrett\n\nCopyright material from www.palgraveconnect.com - licensed to Taiwan eBook Consortium - PalgraveConnect - 2011-03-03\n\nBruno, Dr Francesco\n\n32 Burton, Robert\n\n(1577–1640) Author of The Anatomy of Melancholy. According to Lady *Blessington, Byron said that The Anatomy was ‘excellent for the quantity of desultory information it contained’, and was an inexhaustible mine of knowledge (Blessington, Conversations 206). For his early reading of Burton see also Prose 6–7 and 197–8 and Murray, Letters 428. In October 1821 Byron requested a copy of Burton’s book from *Murray, who sent him, in November, the copy of the 1806 edition which he had purchased in the 1816 sale of Byron’s books (BLJ viii.238; Murray, Letters 426, 428).\n\nButler, Rev. Dr George (1774–1853) Headmaster of *Harrow School 1805–29. Byron, loyal to the memory of Joseph *Drury, caricatured Butler as ‘Pomposus’ in ‘On a Change of Masters, at a Great Public School’ and ‘Childish Recollections’. The latter was included in HI and POVO but left out of POT following Byron’s reconciliation with Butler.\n\nButler, Samuel (1613–80) Satirist, author of Hudibras. In Hints 397–400 *Swift’s wit is ‘Unmatched by all save matchless Hudibras’ and Butler is acknowledged as pioneer of the octosyllabic couplet. Byron writes ‘Hudibrastics’ (BLJ ii.126) in ‘Farewell to Malta’. Butler’s digressiveness is one possible model for that of DJ.\n\n‘By the Rivers of Babylon We Sat Down and Wept’ Song in HM, written in January 1815. It is a version of Psalm 137, where the Israelites lament their exile in Babylon. ‘In The Valley of Waters’ was written as an alternative version (Nathan 69) and published later in N1827–9. *Nathan set both pieces.\n\nByromania Obsession with Byron. The term was coined in 1812 by Annabella Milbanke (Lady *Byron) in her satirical poem on women’s attention to Byron, newly famous for CHP I–II.
