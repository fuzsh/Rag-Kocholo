        "text": "The Italian Cultural Institute in Athens and the Italian Embassy in Athens present the exhibition “Levante” by illustrator and graphic designer from Venice, Lucio Schiavon, as part of the bilateral programme for the cultural promotion of Tempo Forte, with the participation of Greek local authorities which will host the exhibition from stage to stage, starting in Corfu (from 30 June to 24 July).\n\nLucio Schiavon, illustrator and graphic designer, was born in Venice. Among others, he collaborated with Fabrica, La Biennale di Venezia, and Armando Testa agency. Through his journey in Greece, his exhibition “Levante” aims to shed light on the common heritage that links Greece and Venice by means of totally contemporary artistic styles and gestures.\n\nDuring the first stop, held within the walls of the Old Venetian Fortress in the Old Town of Corfu, a UNESCO heritage site, in between the premises of the Latin Chapel, it will be possible to admire the first original piece of his journey, portraying Isabella Teotochi Albrizzi, a literary woman, essayist, and leading exponent of the Venetian intellectual scene between the 18th and 19th centuries. Born in Corfu, she boosted the cultural life in Venice, where she lived a turbulent and passionate relationship with Ugo Foscolo. The first exhibition will therefore be held in Corfu, with the collaboration of the Superintendency for Antiquities, from 30 June to 24 July 2022. The following stages are already in the pipeline, in famous and unexpected places in coastal, island and inland Greece, such as Monemvasia, Rovies (Euboea), Syros, Igoumenitsa, Kastoria, as well as the main urban centres."
