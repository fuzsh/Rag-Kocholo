Not saying there aren’t good aspects of having An Autism Spectrum Disorder, I’m just writing right now about how it can make life rather hard. © on Dec 25 2020 11:23 PM PST, Gabriella Volk misc • pain • sad • society\n\nPlease give me all the languages,\n\nso that I may find my voice,\n\nfor it is hard for me to understand,\n\nhow sometimes I feel broken and without a choice,\n\nscattered by demands,\n\nso stuck inside my head,\n\nlost without words,\n\nwithout a voice,\n\nchoking on failed plans,\n\nflailing with the thoughts inside,\n\nas my mouth moves wordless.\n\nAnd maybe it’s normal, must happen to everyone,\n\ngetting lost inside their heads, not able to speak, but I feel brain dead.\n\nPlease gift me all the languages,\n\nso that I may understand.\n\n© on Dec 20 2020 09:42 PM PST, Gabriella Volk"
