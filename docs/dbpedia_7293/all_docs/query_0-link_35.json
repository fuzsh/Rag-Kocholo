        "text": "The idea that Gian Domenico Ottonelli was an art theorist writing in harmony with Pietro da Cortona is deconstructed by an examination of his primary career as a critic and guerrilla fighter against popular theater. He is the Italian counterpart to William Prynne in England and his Trattato sulla pittura is comparable to Prynne's Histrio-Mastix of 1633. All notions that he is a legitimate theorist of art or theater must be dismissed.\n\nDuring the 16th century and at the beginning of the 17th century the age-old competition between scholarly doctors and folk healers became more and more serious, creating a division between the two categories entrusted with treating population diseases. On one side there were the representatives who practiced medicine in an official capacity, and on the other, the &quot;others&quot;, that is, the charlatans, the acrobats and female healers. Two representatives of these contrasting approaches of practicing medicine within the health profession during that historical period were two Italian doctors, Domenico Lanzoni and Giuseppe Rosaccio. Together, with their ties to the city of Bologna and the bolognese Carracci family of painters, they were able to describe in complete detail these two types of practices as medical sciences of the sixteenth and early seventeenth century.\n\nMy study analyzes the most common types of illnesses of the head in treatises of medicina practica and in collections of consilia written by leading Bolognese physicians in the second half of the sixteenth century. In this study I offer a partial answer to the question of madness in sixteenth-century Bologna, a university medical center for all of Italy and Europe in the early-modern period. The answer lies, in part, in the learned medical tradition of madness, and in particular, in the ways in which important physicians at the University of Bologna represented madness in relation to gender in two genres: the treatise of medicina practica and the consilium. Though stereotypes of masculine and feminine behavior shaped the way these two genres viewed mental illnesses, they played a lesser role in the consilia.\n\nAfter Girolamo Donzellini became a physician in 1541, he worked variously in the fields of medicine, philosophy, and religion over the following forty-five years. He was a bibliophile and a philosopher, fascinated by Hermetic discourse and the attempt to study secret correspondences in nature. He was open to ideas for change in the medical world, and his rational nature gradually led him to reject any kind of medical or religious dogma. With his intellectual vitality, he was the epitome of Cinquecento humanist medical culture in the Italian peninsula. As his life is documented in a wealth of sources, it can be used to underline and contextualise the way that the evolution of medicine on the eve of the scientific revolution was linked to the religious upheaval affecting the whole continent in the sixteenth century. As the path he took was by no means an isolated case, these pages will explore this connection by outlining the experiences of many other heterodox physicians."
