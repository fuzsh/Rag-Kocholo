Her popular blend of rhythmn and blues and hip-hop styles, together with her sexily provocative film videos (in one she wrestled with a python) made Aaliyah an extremely popular performer. Before her early death (Aug 25, 2001) in a plane crash in the Bahamas, she made two films Romeo Must Die (2000) which featured her song âTry Againâ and the title role in Queen of the Damned (2001) based on the vampire novel of Anne Rice.\n\nAames, Angela â (1956 â 1988)\n\nAmerican film and television actress\n\nBorn (Feb 27, 1956) in Pierre, South Dakota, she attended university there prior to the beginning of her movie career in Hollywood, California.

The saga refers to Aarlof as âAlof the Fecundâ a poetical allusion to the future fertility of this marriage, but in fact she bore her husband only one child, a daughter Bergliot Thorirsdotter, later the wife of Sigurd Hakonssen (died 962), Jarl of Lade by whom she left issue.\n\nAarons, Ruth Hughes â (1910 â 1980)\n\nAmerican sportswoman\n\nRuth Aarons was born in Stamford, Connecticut.

She was finally arrested by the Ottoman government, which suspected her of spying for the British. She was apprehended with a code message, and was then tortured, before managing to commit suicide, in order to protect others. Sarah Aaronsohn shot herself with her own gun (Oct 9, 1917) aged twenty-seven, at Zichron Yaakov.\n\nAas Kaur â (c1776 â 1823)\n\nSikh princess\n\nAas Kaur was the daughter of Durdas Singh, ruler of Chattah in the Punjab, and became the wife (1792) of Sahib Singh, ruler of Patiala. Ambitious and manipulative, Aas Kaur managed to insinuate herself into her husbandâs favour, after bearing him a son (1797), and succeeded in removing her powerful sister-in-law from the court. However, the princess became involved in a bitter property dispute with her husband, and eventually betrayed him to the British authorities, who removed Sahib Singh from power and placed Aas Kaur as regent for their son (1812).\n\nWith her husbandâs death in 1813, her son requested that she remain at the head of the government of Patiala, and the British consented to this arrangement.

Abahai was posthumously granted the rank of empress twenty-five years later with the official title Xiao Lieh Wu Huang Hou (1650) by decree of her son Dorgon, who was regent for the young Emperor Shun-chih (1543 â 1661).
