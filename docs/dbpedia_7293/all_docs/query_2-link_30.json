The villa is located on the eastern side of the Terraglio (the ancient road from Venice to Treviso).\n\nThe villa takes its name from Isabella Teotochi Albrizzi who lived there at the end of the eighteenth century and who hosted a literary salon which earned her the nickname, the Italian Madame Stael. Among her guests were Ippolito Pindemonte, Ugo Foscolo, Lord Byron, and Antonio Canova.\n\nThe villa has a classical facade typical of many Venetian villas, surmounted by a pediment with three statues and with balconies at the piano nobile [main floor, the second floor to Americans] and on the second floor [third floor to Americans]. Noteworthy are the landscaped grounds and especially the two (*)barchesse [support structures] that flank the south and north sides of the villa, designed by Andrea Pagnossin.\n\nThe villa is not open to the public.\n\nReference and links\n\nIst.reg. per le ville venete - Le ville venete, itinerari tra Veneto e Friuli - Marsilio Venezia 1998"
