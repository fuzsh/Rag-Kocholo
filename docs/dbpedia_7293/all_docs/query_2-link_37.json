        "text": "The Palace\n\nThe hospitality of Palazzo Marin will transform your events and celebrations into warm and glowing memories for you and your guests. The perfect acoustics of the frescoed stately rooms will turn your favourite piece into an unforgettable concert, and will provide a sublime setting for poetry readings and cultural events.\n\nChoose Palazzo Marin for your next event and experience an exclusive moment in the last salon in Venice, where every gesture is a play in itself, it is art unfolding, poetry in the making.\n\nWhere art is at home\n\nIt has the shape of a palace, but the heart of a home. It speaks through art, telling the story of a city and the people who lived in it. It offers an opportunity, indulging in its own: to be the symbol of a rediscovered elegance, sought after and unique like a gem guarded with respect and then returned to the world.\n\nIt is Palazzo Marin, located between Santa Maria del Giglio and the Teatro della Fenice, which belonged to the family whose name it now bears and who oversaw its 18th-century restoration. The restoration, which began in 1760, enriched the three hundred square meters of the structure thanks to the artistic intervention of Gaetano Zompini and Giovanni Scajaro, who created the frescoes.\n\nFrescoes\n\nGaetano Zompini's work adorns the hall on the \"piano nobile\": on the walls are depictions of Aeneas' Flight from Troy, The Rape of Helen and, on the ceiling, Apollo and the Muses.\n\n\"A grand piano in this room reiterates the artist's propensity for art, in harmony with his depiction of Zeus' daughters with their guide, Apollo.\"\n\nIt was Scajaro, on the other hand, who painted the enchanting fresco, La Virtù incorona il Merito (Virtue Crowns Merit), which embellishes, also on the \"piano nobile\", the ceiling of the room overlooking the Rio della Fenice. In the next room, there is, again by Scajaro, a flight of putti on the oval ceiling.\n\nThe Marin family and Isabella Teotochi\n\nThe rich and chequered history of this palace is not easy to follow - the long list of successions and property transfers makes for an intricate and captivating story. The coat of arms carved on the inner courtyard well - a blue wave on silver leaf - testifies to the palace's passage to the Marin family. Tradition has it that it was home to the celebrated Countess Isabella Teotochi from Corfu in her early years in Venice. She was married twice, first to Carlo Antonio Marin, and then to Giuseppe Albrizzi…. A very learned woman of letters, witty, beautiful, loved by Vivant Denon (the “creator” of the Louvre museum), and poets Ippolito Pindemonte and Ugo Foscolo, and an intimate friend of Canova, to whom she dedicated the famous biography of his works, Isabella Teotochi was called “the Venetian Madame de Staël\"."
