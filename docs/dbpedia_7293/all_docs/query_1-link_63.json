Louis Marchesano, collections curator of prints and drawings at the Getty Research Institute, co-organized the conference with Paula Findlen. Thomas Crow, director of the Getty Research Institute, Gail Feigenbaum, associate director of programs at the Getty, and Peter H. Reill, director of the UCLA Center for i/th- and i8th-Century Studies, all helped to make this a provocative and enjoyable event. We thank the staff of both institutions for making the event go so smoothly. Chloe Chard, Massimo Ciavolella, Carole Paul, and Geoffrey Simcox, who all participated in the conference, stimulated discussion that led to the idea of publishing the papers. More recently, Carole Paul served as the external reviewer for this manuscript and offered sage advice on its final composition. We express our gratitude to them and to other colleagues, family, and friends who provided inspiration, encouragement, and support throughout the development of this interdisciplinary project. We would also like to thank Meredith Kunz for assistance with editing, Matthew Sneider for his translations of Italian essays, and Brian Brege for the index. Many institutions lent support, including the University of Rhode Island Center for the Humanities, Stanford University, the American Academy in Rome, the British School at Rome, the Getty Research Institute, the American Council for Learned Societies, the American Philosophical Society, and the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences. They offered material support for the completion of this project and sabbatical leave for two of the three editors.\n\nXll ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThe essays in this volume present original research by international scholars in fields ranging from the history of science, art, and music to literature, travel writing, and gender studies. Some were presented in earlier versions at the conference; other, new essays were included to broaden the scope of our theme. We would like to acknowledge the patience, cooperation, and generosity of all the authors who contributed essays to the book. Their enthusiasm for this project has made it a pleasure to complete. We are especially appreciative of the care with which Stanford University Press has seen this project into print. Norris Pope, Emily-Jane Cohen, Judith Hibbard, and Tom Finnegan have all been a pleasure to work with. We thank them for their enthusiasm and understanding of the pleasures and importance of collaborative research. During the course of this collaborative project, the editors learned a great deal from each other and the other authors about the women and men in these essays: their lives and loves, their successes and losses, and their contributions to letters, arts, and sciences in eighteenth-century Italy. As we prepared this volume, we experienced some joyous and some painful personal events of our own—the birth of a child, the serious illness of a brother, the death of a beloved sister. Without the love and compassion of our families and friends, bringing our work to fruition would not have been possible.

But you must probe more deeply to judge this country. —Germaine de Stael, Corinne, or Italy (1807)!\n\nTouring Italy, Again \"The voyage to Italy is the most interesting of all possible voyages,\" declared the abbe Gabriel-Francois Coyer after his trip of I7&3.2 Italy had long captured the imagination of foreigners, but it did so to an unprecedented degree during the eighteenth century, when Grand Tourists arrived in evergrowing numbers. They came primarily to view the tangible remains of Italy's glorious past—its art, architecture, great libraries and museums, and especially its antiquities—and to sample certain elements of its present that they found in the theaters, opera houses, coffeehouses, casinos, and salons. \"One comes to Italy to look at buildings, statues, pictures, people,\" wrote Hester Lynch Thrale Piozzi in 1789.3 In an era in which travel was a necessary part of a gentleman's education and increasingly a possibility for a handful of adventurous women, firsthand experience of Italy became an Many thanks to Martha Feldman, Marta Cavazza, Carole Paul, and especially my coeditors, Catherine Sama and Wendy Wassyng Roworth, for generously sharing their knowledge of eighteenth-century Italy with me. Their comments and bibliographic suggestions have substantially improved the introduction as a reflection of a multidisciplinary conversation about the state of this field.\n\n2\n\nPAULA F I N D LEN\n\nessential prerequisite to any claim to be a citizen of the world. \"A man who has not been to Italy,\" declared Samuel Johnson in 1776, \"is always conscious of an inferiority from his not having seen what it is expected a man should see.\"4 Two years after Coyer completed his voyage, twenty-five-year-old James Boswell explained to Rousseau why he lingered in the southernmost parts of Europe: \"My desire to know the world made me resolve to intrigue a little while in Italy,\" he confessed.5 The very month that Boswell penned this letter, Tobias Smollett found himself in Florence shunning the very thing that his fellow Scotsman craved: \"the intolerable caprices and dangerous resentment of an Italian virago.\"6 He haunted the Uffizi and dreamed of visiting it daily in another life in which he would reside permanently in Florence. When Smollett arrived in Rome, he avoided the common practice of hiring an antiquarian, furnishing himself instead with maps, guidebooks, and an unschooled Roman servant so that he could see the city for himself rather than claim any pretension of connoisseurship in the hands of a professional and learned guide (cicerone). It was experience rather than knowledge that he sought to acquire. By contrast, Boswell happily reported to Rousseau from Rome: \"I have almost finished my tour of Italy . . . and I believe that I have acquired taste to a certain degree.\"7 While these representative travelers may not have agreed uniformly about how Italy would be the culmination of their education, they nonetheless concurred on the fundamental role of an Italian experience for eighteenthcentury Britons and Europeans. In between their trips, for example, lay the imaginary journey of Ann Radcliffe's English travelers, whose wanderings in Naples, set in \"about the year 1764,\" were the pretext for telling her melodramatic tale of love, family, honor, and Roman Catholic iniquity in The Italian (1796).8 The year 1764 was also the first time that the antiquarian Edward Gibbon laid eyes on the Eternal City. His three-month encounter with Rome famously inspired the writing of The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire (1776-1783). Gibbon was hardly alone in the desire to produce something tangible from his Italian experience. The astronomer Jerome de Lalande, whose year in Italy commenced in August 1765, transformed his experience into a bestselling guidebook, Voyage d'unfranc,ois en Italie (1769), so lengthy, detailed, and definitive that Napoleon's advisors used it as a blueprint for pillaging the scientific and artistic treasures of the Italian peninsula almost thirty years later. Germaine de Stael carried the updated edition of Lalande's book with her during a trip which inspired\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n3\n\nthe writing of her melancholic bestseller Corinne or Italy (1807; Figure Li). An allegorical and highly nostalgic portrait of Italy as a \"learned lady\" for foreigners to love, her novel immortalized one of the crucial images of Italy in the eighteenth century.9 As even a casual perusal of eighteenth-century travel literature reveals, there were many ways to tour Italy.10 Two years after the appearance of Lalande's bestselling Baedeker for the enlightened public, Charles Burney highlighted the value of a musical Grand Tour in The Present State of Music in France and Italy (1771), presenting Italy as a feast for the ears as well as the eyes. The landscape of Roman ruins, Renaissance palaces, and Baroque galleries and churches also revealed a wealth of contemporary vocal and instrumental talent. Burney took his readers to the opera houses and into homes where learned conversazione gave way to musical performance. In Bologna, he visited the retired castrate Carlo Broschi (1705-1782), better known to his fans as Farinelli, and first laid eyes on the improviser Maria\n\nFigure Li Elisabeth Vigee-Lebrun, Madame de Staelas Corinne, 1808. Erich Lessing/ Art Resource.\n\n4\n\nPAULA F I N DLEN\n\nMaddalena Morelli (1727-1800), celebrated under her Arcadian name as Gorilla Olimpica, in Florence where he sang tenor to her accompaniment on violin. n He very much wanted his readers to hear Italy just as Lady Anne Miller, also on the Grand Tour in 1770, sought to create an artistic guidebook that went beyond simple enumeration of paintings—mere catalogues without any hint of knowledge or taste that transformed such a list into an experience of connoisseurship. She promised readers of her Letters from Italy (1776) that she would describe \"even to tediousness\" absolutely everything she saw.12 The Grand Tour has played such an important role in the study of eighteenth-century Italy that it is virtually impossible to discuss the Italian peninsula during this period without some allusion to the significance of foreigners in shaping perceptions of Italian society, especially after the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748 which inaugurated a half-century of peace after several decades of intermittent warfare, making it far easier to travel. Their writings, published and unpublished, created an indelible image of Italy as an early modern tourists' paradise, a terrain of exploration and selfdiscovery that quickly established a sort of humdrum routine as successive waves of travelers followed in the footsteps of their predecessors, marching to the tune of the latest guidebooks and rarely deviating from this welltrodden path.13 This Italy was an itinerary rather than a living, breathing entity; it existed to confirm assumptions and prejudices rather than to overturn them, and it outlined a history of a region that its inhabitants would— and did—write differently. When the London-based Italian teacher and journalist Giuseppe Baretti (1719-1789) published his acerbic rebuttal to the stereotypical images of Italy in the writings of Grand Tourists in 1768, he aptly summed up the character of the oblivious visitor, describing him as someone who \"saw little, inquired less, and reflected not at all.\" Baretti echoed the commonly held view among Italians that few foreigners really understood anything of the history, culture, and customs of the land they visited, preferring an imaginary Italy to the actual one since it was a more effective mirror of their own preoccupations. Foreigners, he observed, were less apt to comprehend the differences between the Italian states, preferring to transform this long and complicated set of relations and linguistic, cultural, and political differences into a unitary whole. \"But it is so hard to say any thing universal of Italy,\" he warned his readers.14 Such misperceptions were compounded by a strong sense of cultural superiority on the part of many Grand Tourists that Baretti hoped to dispel. He\n\nI NTROD UCTION\n\n5\n\nnot only recounted the misbehavior and ignorance of English youth abroad but also sought to correct exaggerated accounts of the political turpitude, religious decadence, laxity of morals, and lack of ambition that allegedly flourished in the warm Mediterranean climate. Certainly Italy was different, but that did not necessarily make it inferior to the lands north of the Alps which, after all, drew so much inspiration from this part of the world.15 Not all foreigners who passed judgment on Italy were quite so transitory or ill-informed. In an era in which the Austrian Hapsburgs and the Spanish Bourbons ruled most of Italy, save for the Papal States and the republics of Genoa, Venice, and Lucca, and when the English and French saw the Italian peninsula as critical to maintaining their own presence in the Mediterranean through trade and diplomacy, there were many reasons to linger awhile in the Italian peninsula. Each of these four major European powers considered its attachment to Italy to be an important component of any claim to be the presumptive heir of the ancient Roman empire. Growing numbers of foreigners resident in the principal Italian cities—British consuls such as Joseph Smith in Venice, Sir Horace Mann in Florence, and Sir William Hamilton and his flamboyant wife Emma in Naples; antiquaries such as Johann Joachim Winckelmann and James Byres in Rome; and an international colony of artists, dealers, connoisseurs, and ciceroni that included such luminaries as painters Anton Raphael Mengs (1728—1779), Gavin Hamilton (1723—1798), and Angelica Kauffman (1741-1807), sculptors Christopher Hewetson (ca. 1739-1799) and Bertel Thorwaldsen (1770-1844), and artist, dealer, and banker Thomas Jenkins (1722—1798) as well as formal institutions such as the French Academy (founded in 1666 and installed in the Palazzo Mancini in 1725)16—helped to shape the most urbane aspects of Italian society and culture, especially in the second half of the eighteenth century. Their writings, artworks, and activities contributed to the image of Italy as a foreigners' paradise, and they profited directly from tourists and visiting artists through sales of artworks and antiquities, by serving as guides and providing art training. They advertised their knowledge of this region as the antidote to ignorance and inexperience. As early as 1740, the well-traveled Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, at the beginning of her own lengthy residence in northern Italy, poked fun at the young English dandies who lounged around the Venetian coffeehouses, elegantly dressed in the latest fashions, sipping coffee and chocolate, spooning sorbets, discussing their latest affairs, and learning no Italian.17 She would have found Boswell's unrestrained sexual tourism the epitome of the boorish\n\n6\n\nPAULA FINDLEN\n\nbehavior of the British abroad, though she initially came to Italy in search of her own thwarted affaire du coeur with the young Venetian Francesco Algarotti (1712-1764). Disappointed in love, Wortley Montagu found other reasons to remain. Having arrived in Italy carrying her considerable library in tow, she proclaimed it to be the ideal environment in which a thinking woman could flourish, better in every respect than the British Isles. \"The character of a learned lady is far from being ridiculous in this country,\" she informed her daughter in 1753, \"the greatest Familys being proud of having produce'd female writers and a Milanese Lady being now proffessor of Mathematics in the University of Bologna.\"18 It was the presence of learned women such as the mathematician Maria Gaetana Agnesi (1718-1799)—appointed professor in absentia in 1749 since she never actually left Milan for Bologna19—that made Wortley Montagu confident of her chosen land of expatriation. When the French poet Anne-Marie Piquet du Boccage met her in Venice in the summer of 1757, Lady Mary was sufficiently enamored of the Italy of Benedict XIV to show her visitor a portrait of the pope which she kept in her palace, while professing her utter disdain for Roman Catholicism.20 Upon completing her tour of Italy, Madame du Boccage wondered why the French did not correspond more frequently with the numerous talented Italian scholars and poets whom she met.21 Britons and northern Europeans found Italy a different place, in part because they expected it to be quite unfamiliar. For them, Italy was both a Utopia and a dystopia, a place of dreams and aspirations that offered endless opportunities to reinvent one's identity but also a location from which one could return home truly appreciative of the superiority of a world that was not defined and constrained by its past. There was an undeniable stink in the Venetian lagoons and Roman marshes, a sense of indolence in the Florentine galleries, a lingering Spanish decadence to the splendors of Naples that could not be denied—or at least this was what many visitors perceived. Italy had faded so that other places might flourish. \"The inhabitants of this country were once the triumphant lords and conquerors of the world; but at present the softer arts prevail,\" observed Thomas Nugent in 1749.22 Visitors looked everywhere for signs of this waning of Italy. They found it partly in the mustiness of its relics (talismans of previous eras of great political and artistic regimes) and partly in the perceived corruption of Italian morals that seemed to express itself most clearly in the unusual behavior and occupations of some of its most prominent men and women. What Mary Wortley Montagu considered an\n\nI NTRO D UCTION\n\nJ\n\nItalian virtue—the flourishing of learned and aristocratic women who proclaimed their independence from traditional customs and beliefs—others equally perceived to be a sign of Italy's corruption. Was Italy a place where women became men, and men became women? The Marquis de Sade, who fled to Italy in July 1775 to avoid prosecution for a litany of sexual transgressions, was quite sure that there was \"a great penchant for betraying one's sex\" throughout the Italian peninsula.23 He linked the image of Italy as a world turned upside down to his understanding of its decline since the Renaissance. Trapped in the mausoleum of history and culture, the Italians inevitably could not progress as a civilization. Were we only to follow the path trodden by the likes of Boswell, Gibbon, Lalande, Sade, the intrepid Lady Mary and earnest Lady Anne, the dashing Madame de Stael, and their fellow travelers, we might be left with this impression. The Grand Tour produced a rich and diverse array of documentation—diaries, guidebooks, novels, portraits, sketches, curios, and even buildings—that offers us a glimpse of a vibrant artistic, antiquarian, musical, and literary culture, a world of people constantly on the verge of self-illumination and grand historical reflection in response to their environment. Some of the most interesting, colorful, and important figures of the eighteenth century traveled to, were inspired by, and passed judgment on the history and contemporary fate of Italy. As a result of this torrent of words and images, it is all too easy to see the fruits of their encounter, both trivial and profound, as the sum total of Italy's contribution to the age of Enlightenment and Revolution, and to see the Italian peninsula only through their eyes. Seductive as the narrative of the Grand Tour may be, it inevitably limits our vision of the past. Italian society and culture in the eighteenth century was far more than simply a tourists' playground and artists' haven. This point, of course, is hardly novel but worth revisiting in light of the persistence of certain stereotypes. Rather than simply revisiting the caricatures of Italian society perpetuated by the accounts of Grand Tourists, we should analyze them in relationship to documents internal to this culture. If the eighteenth century, as many scholars have suggested, was the period in which the Italian peninsula developed new, stronger, and more diverse connections to many other parts of Europe, then one of the goals of studying this century should be an exploration of the dialogue between foreign and indigenous views of Italy.24 As Ilaria Bignamini observes, Italians were \"fully-fledged actors on the scene of the Grand Tour.\"25 They not\n\n8\n\nPAULA F I N D L E N\n\nonly shaped this cultural activity by guiding foreigners through their cities, painting their portraits, and supplying them with real and faked antiquities and lessons in Italian history and culture but also sought to realize their own vision of bringing Italy into the modern era. This volume, originating from a conference held at the Getty Research Institute and the William Andrews Clark Library of UCLA in conjunction with a Getty Center exhibit in 2002 on Italy and the Grand Tour, presents some of the recent work by Italian and North American scholars on eighteenth-century Italy. Our goal is to examine selected aspects of the social and cultural life of the Italian peninsula, both in its own terms and in relation to foreign observations of this region. What were some of the distinctive features of Italy in the eighteenth century? Why did they emerge, and how did they operate in practice? To what extent did these elements of Italian society and culture shape discussions of Italy abroad? Implicitly, while engaging in a dialogue with the scholarship focused on those two classic images of the eighteenth century—the Enlightenment and the Grand Tour—we have tried to indicate the possibilities of another history that expands our understanding of this fascinating period.26 We have focused on the relationship between gender and culture for several reasons. As a great deal of recent scholarship has shown, the eighteenth century was an especially important moment for the reassessment of traditional roles of men and women.27 It was also a critical period in the emergence of a new understanding of sexual behavior and affective relations.28 Recent work on eighteenth-century Italy has begun to explore these issues, highlighting the Italian peninsula's distinctive contributions to public debates about marriage, sexuality, and the place of women in society.29 Scholarship on cicisbei) castrati, and the sexual behavior and artistic proclivities of Grand Tourists in Italy has begun to develop an account of attitudes toward male sexuality.30 This volume explores the theme of gender and culture across disciplines; it seeks to create a conversation among scholars in the fields of history, literature, philosophy, art history, and music regarding perceptions of gender in the eighteenth century.\n\nOther Visions of Italy Far from being trapped irrevocably in its past, Italy was a region undergoing profound political, social, and economic transformation at a level it had not experienced since the end of the Renaissance. At the beginning of the eigh-\n\nINTRO DUCTIO N\n\n9\n\nteenth century the configuration of the Italian peninsula reflected the outcome of the political struggles of the sixteenth century. The Spanish were the dominant foreign power, ruling Lombardy, the Kingdom of Naples, Sicily, and Sardinia. The Papal States controlled much of central Italy while the Republic of Venice retained its independence and a foothold in the Adriatic, and the Republic of Genoa, closely allied with the Spanish, retained some measure of its political independence and commercial interests in the Mediterranean, including control of Corsica until 1768. A handful of smaller states—far fewer in number by the eighteenth century than at the height of the Renaissance— continued to be governed by hereditary princes, most famously the Medici in Florence, the Gonzaga in Mantua, the Este in Modena, the Farnese in Parma, and the House of Savoy in Piedmont, whose territory and influence grew as others reached the point of obsolescence.31 Tiny Lucca retained its place as Italy's other long-lived republic while the dukes of Guastalla maintained their autonomy from their Gonzaga cousins in Mantua. With important exceptions, Italy had become a largely aristocratic and agrarian society. Italian cities were still lively places to live in and to visit, full of conversation and cosmopolitan civility, but the vast commercial enterprises and glittering court culture that had brought many of them to prominence in the late Middle Ages and the Renaissance no longer were their defining features. The first half of the eighteenth century saw the collapse of a number of the political arrangements that had governed the Italian states for almost two centuries. The death of Charles II of Spain in 1700 triggered the War of Spanish Succession (1700-1713) between the Austrian Hapsburgs and the French Bourbons. Many regions found themselves pawns once again in an international game of war and diplomacy. In 1707 the Hapsburgs gained control of the Kingdom of Naples which they subsequently ceded to the Bourbons in 1734.32 The House of Savoy gained temporary possession of Sicily in 1713—it would later become a Hapsburg (1720) and finally a Bourbon territory (1734)—followed by their acquisition of Sardinia in 1718. Formerly Spanish Lombardy became Austrian in 1713, though the Hapsburg right of possession would continue to be periodically contested until the end of the War of Austrian Succession (1740-1748). In between these events, many prominent ruling families found themselves on the verge of extinction. The marquisate of Mantua, ruled by the Gonzaga since 1328, became a Hapsburg possession in 1707. The death of the last Farnese duke, Antonio, in 1731 precipitated a struggle between the Bourbons and Hapsburgs for control of the duchy. The last surviving male member of the Medici family, the gluttonous\n\n10\n\nPAULA FINDLEN\n\nand ailing Gian Gastone, died in 1737. Tuscany welcomed a foreign ruler, Duke Francis Stephen of Lorraine, whose marriage to Maria Theresa paved the way for his succession as emperor in 1745; his third son, Peter Leopold, succeeded him as grand duke in 1765. Like Lombardy, Tuscany was now a Hapsburg possession though not directly subject to its rule. The uneasy relationship between older and newer visions of Italy might best be observed by considering the aspirations of Elisabetta Farnese (1692— 1766), who certainly rivaled the Hapsburg emperor Charles VI (ruled 1711-1740) and his daughter, the empress Maria Theresa (ruled 1740-1780), in the influence she exercised on the political reconfiguration of Italy. The second wife of Philip V and last descendant of the ruling family of Parma, Elisabetta Farnese became queen of Spain in 1714 (Figure 1.2). Initially under the influence of cardinal Giulio Alberoni (1664-1752), she aspired to oust the Hapsburgs from Italy in order to reunify many of its disparate parts under a Bourbon-Farnese dynasty. While failing to recover Lombardy and Sardinia for Spain, she nonetheless succeeded in placing her eldest son, Charles, on the Neapolitan throne in 1734 and restored the duchy of Parma and Piacenza (expanded to include Guastalla) to her family's possession under his younger brother Philip in 1748.33 When she retired from the Spanish court upon the death of her husband in 1746, an English pamphlet begrudgingly admired \"the Queen's boundless Ambition\" and \"extraordinary Passion for governing\" by declaring her \"Mistress of all Italy.\"34 Its anonymous author recommended to the new king Ferdinand VI that he either shut his stepmother up in a convent or send her to Siberia to prevent her from undermining his rule. The Spanish queen was exactly the sort of powerful female figure who inspired tales of Italy as a land of literary and political Amazons where men were content to be ruled by women. Elisabetta Farnese embodied the failed struggle to claim Italy for an Italian princely lineage in the face of its reconquest and ultimately political marginalization by various foreign powers. Farnese's bold plan to reinvent the map of Italy found no immediate successors. The most important indigenous ruler within Italy, the papacy, was on the verge of reversing its longstanding reputation as an ecclesiastic office from which many of Italy's ruling families had realized their ambitions since the fifteenth century. The place of religion in Italian society changed dramatically in the course of the eighteenth century, beginning with a substantial reduction in the temporal powers of the papacy. Failed efforts to capture the Republic of San Marino and to gain Parma and Piacenza for the papacy\n\nINTRO D UCTION\n\nII\n\nFigure 1.2 Louis Michel van Loo, Portrait ofElisabetta Farnese, Queen of Spain, Second Wife of Philip V, ca. 1745 (oil on canvas, 107 x 84 cm). Reunion des Musees Nationaux/ Art Resource.\n\nin the 17305 clarified the secondary status of the Papal States in the carving up of the Italian peninsula. The papacy ceased to vie for new territory. Equally telling, it did not play a decisive role in the diplomatic negotiations among those who harbored such aspirations.35 Instead, it carved out a new role for itself as the guardian of an immense cultural patrimony, inaugurating what Christopher Johns has aptly described as \"Settecento papal arts programs.\"36 Under Clement XII (1730—1740)—who restored the papacy to financial solvency, in part by reviving the public lottery—ambitious building and public works projects embellished the fa$ade of Rome, continuing the work of his distinguished predecessor Clement XI (1700-1721). At the same time, the papacy focused its attention on scholarly projects designed to write a more complete and scientific history of Roman Catholicism and its doctrines with the new tools of modern scholarship. Benedict XIV (1740-\n\n12\n\nPAULA FINDLEN\n\n1758), another pope inspired by the foundational work of Clement XI, made significant efforts to reform longstanding ecclesiastical rituals and institutions. Like many popes of the eighteenth century, he saw Rome as a city of faith, knowledge, and culture. Despite this bold new vision of a reinvigorated Catholicism, the eighteenth-century papacy found itself facing a number of challenges, both within and without. The century that began with Clement XTs condemnation of Jansenism in 1713 and Clement XII's condemnation of freemasonry in 1738 ended with the suppression of the Society of Jesus in 1773 during the papacy of Clement XIV (1769-1775) and the forced exile of Pius VI (1775-1799) from Rome at the hands of Napoleons army. They declared Rome a republic on 13 February 1798 and escorted the pope to Siena a week later. He died a prisoner in the citadel of Valence the following year, having been immortalized in Sz&zs Juliette (1798) as the willing audience for a long history of ecclesiastic debauchery and depravity which Juliette recites as a prelude to a papal orgy. The transformation of religious values in the age of Enlightenment affected many aspects of Italian society. Throughout the century, the papacy and its supporters grappled with the shape of enlightened Catholicism.37 This question resonated throughout Catholic Europe but played an especially crucial role in the intellectual life of the Papal States and surrounding territories. Just how modern should Italy become? What did modernity mean in a region rich with history, tradition, and faith? The tensions between traditional values and novel ideas threatened to divide, if not actually shatter, Ludovico Antonio Muratori's (1672-1750) vision of an Italian Republic of Letters. The kind of intellectual experimentation, cultural innovation, and programs for social, juridical, and economic reform that we associate with the Enlightenment played no small role in shaping Italy's eighteenth century. Whether it was in the opera house, the salon, the academy, the gallery, or the pages of journals such as // Caffe, conversations revolved around the possibilities for change. These innovations too caught the attention of the more discerning visitors who perceived the Italian cities as making distinctive contributions to learning, the arts, and public life. For example, many of the most famous and popular sites in Rome, including the Spanish Steps, the Trevi Fountain, the Piazza del Popolo, and the Villa Borghese, were designed, built, or renovated during the eighteenth century. While strongly immersed in the past, eighteenth-century Italians were painfully conscious of the present they inhabited and eager to stake their place in this world.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n13\n\nThe Italian states generally did not exhibit the military strength, economic vitality, and colonial ambitions of their British and northern European counterparts, but they were hardly a closed and stagnant world, unable or unwilling to keep up with the times. Some of the most interesting and sustained efforts at political and economic reform in the second half of the eighteenth century occurred in Piedmont, Lombardy, and Tuscany while regions such as the Papal States, the Kingdom of Naples, and the Republic of Venice also attempted to transform traditional social structures to respond to the new circumstances in which they found themselves. As Franco Venturi demonstrated in his monumental studies of the eighteenth-century illuministi, Italy fully participated in the project of Enlightenment.38 With the noteworthy exception of scholarship on figures such as Giambattista Vico (1668-1744) and Cesare Beccaria (1738-1794), we still know little about Italian contributions to this European-wide efflorescence of new ideas, projects, and institutions since studies of the Italian Enlightenment do not feature prominently in general surveys of this subject. Many of the most passionate Italian advocates for modernity did not simply advocate change at home but based their ideas on reading foreign books, corresponding with foreign scholars, and experiences culled from traveling in Britain and northern Europe—a kind of reverse Grand Tour. Writers such as Algarotti, Baretti, the poet and dramatist Pietro Metastasio (1696—1782), the playwright Carlo Goldoni (1707—1793), and the adventurer Giacomo Casanova (1725—1798), musicians such as Farinelli and Giuseppe Domenico Scarlatti (1685—1757), and painters such as Rosalba Carriera (1675—1757), Giovanni Battista Tiepolo (1696—1770), and Antonio Canaletto (1697—1768) acted as cultural brokers in cities such as London, Paris, Madrid, Vienna, Dresden, and Potsdam. Inhabiting both worlds, they represented Italy abroad and also brought news of these other parts of the world to Italy.39 The ongoing dialogue between the Italian peninsula and the rest of Europe played a significant role in the cosmopolitan character of its eighteenth century. The eighteenth century may well be the least studied period of Italian history. Lying between the Renaissance and the Risorgimento, it has often been perceived as a political and cultural low point in the history of this region. The general consensus of the broader community of eighteenth-century scholars has implicitly reinforced this vision by suggesting that Italy did not shape this century as actively as northern European counterparts such as France, England, and Germany.40 Save for a handful of passionate devotees\n\n14\n\nPAULA FINDLEN\n\nof the writings of prominent figures such as Goldoni, who commanded a European-wide audience, literary scholars have generally preferred to study any period but the eighteenth century.41 Art historians working on the eighteenth century have also lamented the degree to which the history of Italian painting, sculpture, and architecture has been neglected except for the work of artists such as Canaletto, Giovanni Paolo Panini (1692—1765), Pompeo Batoni (1708-1787), and Giambattista Piranesi (1720-1778), who contributed directly to the visual production of the Grand Tour.42 The case of music stands apart since the eighteenth century was the great age of opera. Italian musicians, librettists, and singers played a crucial role in shaping musical taste and the culture of public performance at this time.43 However, since scholars in other fields rarely read the work of music historians, this aspect of Italy's eighteenth century has not been integrated into a more general social and cultural history. The same might also be said of the history of science, whose scholarship has produced a number of important studies of the intellectual preoccupations of eighteenth-century Italy, its scientific academies, and its most interesting practitioners that certainly demonstrate the importance of Italy to furthering our understanding of eighteenth-century science in general.44 Since the 19505, a small group of Anglo-American historians have begun to outline a history of this period. Their work has explored specific aspects of politics, economy, and culture in the Italian states of the eighteenth century, introducing English-speaking readers to the possibilities of what Eric Cochrane evocatively labeled the \"forgotten centuries\" and engaging in a dialogue with the considerably richer historiography of this period written by Italian and French scholars. We are still in the initial stages of developing a more comprehensive account of this neglected period of Italian history.45 Unfortunately, the majority of the excellent work by many European, especially Italian, scholars on this period has not yet found its way into English.46 Until this occurs, accounts of the eighteenth century will remain impoverished. As Baretti observed, Italy was not a nation in this period but a collection of states whose diversity of political and economic arrangements was matched only by their linguistic and cultural regionalism. Not every city celebrated its learned philosophical women in the manner of the university town of Bologna or shrouded them in the piety of enlightened Catholicism to the degree that one sees in Milan. The Papal States and the Kingdom of Naples far surpassed other Italian states in the number of castrati\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n15\n\nthat they created and celebrated, and in the quantity of antiquarians who haunted the archeological digs, galleries, and libraries in search of new insights into the past. The prominence of women artists, poets, translators, salonnieres, and journalists in Venice was indeed one of its distinctive characteristics, just as that peculiar Italian phenomenon of formally assigning male companions to aristocratic wives—cicisbeismo—reputedly originated in Genoa, where women supposedly had far greater social freedoms at the beginning of the eighteenth century than did their counterparts in many other Italian cities.47 Naples was the only state that produced a few female revolutionaries at the end of the century—most notably the journalist Eleonora Fonseca Pimentel (i752-i799)48—while Rome was quite decidedly a city of antiquarians, abbes, poets, and salonnieres who fought over far less momentous issues than the promise of political independence. Despite these differences, there are ways in which Italy was also a cultural unity that transcended its pronounced regionalism. To some degree, foreigners were correct in perceiving connections between the various Italian states and their peoples. This promise of a larger Italy, for example, lay at the heart of Gian Vincenzo Gravina and Giovan Maria Crescimbeni's founding of the Accademia degli Arcadi in 1690, not simply as a Roman institution but as a literary community for the Italian peninsula, inspired by the ghostly presence of the recently deceased Queen Christina of Sweden, who played such a prominent role in Roman academy and salon life in the late seventeenth century after abdicating her throne and converting to Catholicism. By the mid eighteenth century, there were colonies up and down the peninsula, numbering fifty-six by 1761. Being an Arcadian became a kind of cultural capital among poets and other aspiring writers.49 More critically, Muratori's famous sketch of an Italian Republic of Letters at the beginning of the century sought to raise the standards of scholarly conversation among his contemporaries by outlining plans for reviving the arts and sciences. It informed subsequent projects such as the Venetian Giornale de lettemti d'ltalia (1710—1740) and the Swiss Bibliotheque italique (founded in 1728), which sought to foster intellectual community across political boundaries, bringing the news of Italy to their readers.50 Even while the Italian peninsula suffered under the burdens of foreign rule, its leading citizens aspired to create a better, stronger Italy and left behind numerous traces of these projects and dreams. Neither the Hapsburgs nor the Bourbons fully succeeded in their quest to make the Italian peninsula their own. As the century wore on and the\n\n16\n\nPAULA FINDLEN\n\nworld outside of Italy changed, they too found their presence in Italy under assault. With the arrival of the French army in Piedmont in the spring of 1796, virtually all the political arrangements that defined Italy for much of the century dissolved within the next two years; those which remained were under considerable strain. While none of the Italian states experienced a full-fledged revolution that radically challenged the very structures underpinning their society, reverberations of the French Revolution echoed throughout the peninsula.51 French observers of the Italian scene had already suggested that many leading citizens of the Italian states were sympathetic to the goal of overthrowing the Old Regime. Napoleon fueled their fantasies of an independent Italian nation while making no promises about its eventual existence. Between 1797 and 1798 Lombardy, the Papal States, and the Kingdom of Naples all became part of Napoleons empire while other states sued for peace. The Republic of Venice, whose leading citizens gave up their ancient rights and privileges upon the arrival of Napoleon's troops in the lagoon in May 1797, ended with hardly a whimper, only to find itself subject to Austrian rule after the Treaty of Campoformio (17 October 1797).52 While the French ruled Italy for a briefer period than either the Hapsburgs or the Bourbons, their own efforts to reinvent their nation and, under Napoleon, transform it into an empire left a powerful impression upon their Italian subjects. Mastering Italy was an essential component of the French claim to be the new Roman empire of the eighteenth century. The Grand Tourists of the preceding century as much as Napoleon's political rivals helped to foster this great ambition. Napoleon may rightfully be described as the first person to make the \"Italian nation\" a political entity.53 Prior to his arrival in the Italian peninsula, \"Italy\" denoted a geographic region defined by the ancient Romans, a literary ideal promoted by writers such as Petrarch, Machiavelli, and Francesco Guicciardini, and a sector of the Republic of Letters devoted to increasing the reputation of Italian contributions to the arts, letters, and sciences abroad while advocating for reforms at home. The \"Italians\" as a people, however, inhabited the pages of virtually every travel book written about Italy in the eighteenth century. For some, they were an annoying obstacle in the pursuit of a pristine experience of a landscape, its art, and its ruins. As Alexander Drummond wrote disparagingly of Italy in 1754, \"In this country there is enough to see without being fooled by the Italians.\"54 Other visitors actively tried to anatomize the people they encountered. The Italians were increasingly present in works of history and political theory written by such\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nI/\n\nnotables as Montesquieu, Gibbon, and Jean Charles Leonard de Sismondi, who described them as a people whose distinctive characteristics and customs explained their historical greatness and contemporary obsolescence. Who, then, were the Italians?\n\nGender Trouble in Eighteenth-Century Italy Marveling at the strange reports he heard from visiting Englishmen about the social customs of Italians at midcentury, Baretti ironically queried: \"Or are the men and women in Italy of a different species from those of other countries?\"55 Perceptions of gender played an especially important role in constructing an image of the Italians in the age of the Grand Tour. The fascination with—as well as fear of—sexual ambiguity lay at the heart of understanding Italy's alleged cultural difference. Many travelers observed that Italy was full of exceptional women who did not abide by the rules of society as many northern Europeans understood them. \"Italy has produced more learned women than any part of Europe,\" observed Lady Sydney Morgan upon hearing of the death of the classicist and Greek professor Clotilde Tambroni (1758-1817), echoing the opinion of virtually every traveler in the eighteenth century.56 When Charles Burney arrived in Bologna in August 1770, for example, he made sure to meet Italy's most famous woman professor and university graduate, the physicist Laura Bassi (1711-1778), to complement his visit with Farinelli. After a demonstration of her electrical experiments, a subject in which he deemed himself an amateur enthusiast, Burney wrote admiringly that she has \"fairly earned her title of Dottoressa^1 Bassi's thesis defense, university degree, and professorship in 1732—like the 1705 admission of the painter Rosalba Carriera to the Accademia di San Luca as a regular member, despite rules barring women's admission; the controversial crowning of Gorilla Olimpica as poet laureate on the steps of the Capitoline in 1776; and Maria Dalle Donne's (1778—1842) receipt of a medical degree from Bologna in 1799—represented the most visible moment of Italy's well-publicized celebration of its women. For travelers in search of learned women, virtually every city offered up one or two female prodigies. In 1738 the French lawyer and politician Charles de Brosses recorded his surprise at finding the poet Francesca Manzoni (1710-1743) immersed in the Latin books of the Biblioteca Ambrosiana in Milan, and his pleasure at meeting some of the most talented\n\nl8\n\nPAULA F I N D L E N\n\nwomen of Italy, including the formidable salonniere Clelia Grillo Borromeo (1684-1777), the mathematician Agnesi, and the physicist Bassi. In the early decades of the eighteenth century, the prominent role of women in the intellectual and cultural life of the Italian cities was a great novelty for foreigners. Having heard stories of the university women and female academicians and artists of Italy, they came prepared to pass judgment on them in person. Quite a few made the pilgrimage to Padua to find the statue of Elena Lucrezia Cornaro Piscopia (1646-1684), who had graduated from the university there in 1678 with a degree in philosophy.58 They also admired her portrait in the very library in which Manzoni studied and wrote and, traveling south, collected impressions of learned Italian women like curios for their cabinets. De Brosses' famous description of Agnesi—\"more stupendous than the Duomo of Milan\"59—captures the essence of the foreign fascination with Italian women. Like the churches, galleries, and Roman ruins, they were monuments to be admired and critiqued. Following the highly publicized debate of the Accademia dei Ricovrati of Padua in 1723 regarding whether women should be educated, numerous responses to this question indicated just how central an issue women's learning was to understanding their place in society. Discerning the nature of woman was a cultural preoccupation of the educated elite of the Italian peninsula.60 Establishing a genealogy of Italy's learned women reinforced the idea that the Italian peninsula had historically produced more literate and cultured women than any other region of Europe. The Venetian writer Luisa Bergalli (1703-1779), for example, collected and published the work of 248 female poets of the thirteenth through eighteenth centuries in her Componimenti poetici delle piu illustri rimatrici d'ogni secolo (1726). Sympathetic readers told her that there were many more for her to celebrate. By 1728, for example, seventy-four women had been admitted to Arcadia.61 When the Venetian playwright Pietro Chiari described his epoch as \"The Century of Women\" in 1783, he captured the incessant fascination with educated, independent-minded, and socially unconventional women that characterized the eighteenth century.62 Not everyone thought that Italy's learned women were quite as advertised. In 1764 Giuseppe Baretti informed readers of his periodical, La frusta letteraria, that while he disagreed with those who felt that Italy had produced no noteworthy women of learning, he nonetheless felt that \"the female sex is not generally educated by us with all that care which she ought to be and with which she is educated in other parts of Europe.\"63 Others\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n19\n\nconcurred with his assessment that learning was largely an aristocratic privilege in this society. After visiting Bologna in 1784, the Italian city which claimed to celebrate learned women more than any other by producing such luminaries as the physicist Bassi and the anatomist-artist Anna Morandi Manzolini (1714-1774) and admitting many others to its academies, Hester Lynch Thrale Piozzi, recently remarried to the Brescian singer and composer Gabriele Piozzi, perceptively observed: \"Here is no struggle for female education as with us. . . . A Lady in Italy is sure of applause, so she takes little pains to obtain it.\"64 To her eyes, the celebration of women's learning was yet another means of foreclosing the real discussion regarding the possibility of educating all women. A contemporary of Mary Wollstonecraft, she viewed the Italian tradition more as a vestige of the past than a harbinger of the future. What Lynch Piozzi could not see, however, were the very real struggles for knowledge that propelled many of the women immortalized in the portrait gallery of the Bologna Academy of Sciences, or inscribed into the membership of the Accademia degli Arcadi in Rome and the Accademia dei Ricovrati in Padua, into the public eye. Not every learned woman was, in fact, aristocratic. Gorilla Olimpica was of relatively modest social origins as the daughter of a violinist, though her Neapolitan patron, Faustina Pignatelli, celebrated for her mathematical acumen and philosophical learning, could not have been more highly placed. The acclaimed Roman poet Faustina Maratti Zappi (1680-1745) and the anatomist Morandi Manzolini were daughters of painters; Laura Bassi was a lawyer's daughter, Clotilde Tarnbroni the daughter of a cook, and Agnesi the eldest daughter of a Milanese silk merchant; Maria Dalle Donne was the daughter of peasants from the Bolognese countryside. The Venetian journalist Elisabetta Caminer Turra (1751-1796) grew up surrounded by print because publishing was her father's trade; both she and Rosalba Carriera, daughter of a clerk and a lacemaker, emerged from the professional and artisanal culture of La Serenissima. Angelica Kauffman, the foreign centerpiece of the Roman artistic community, also learned her trade from an artist father.65 While the salons and academies that admitted and feted women were largely aristocratic, the women who studied and taught in the universities, like the female artists of this period, belong to the middling classes. Like the saintly women canonized by the Roman Catholic Church in the course of the eighteenth century, the learned women of this period increasingly did not come from the highest level of society.\n\n2O\n\nPAULA F I N D L E N\n\nNonetheless, Lynch Piozzi was quite correct to state that none of these individual cases forced Italian society to rethink the education and status of women in general. Casanova, whose Lana caprina (1772) argued forcefully for the equality of the sexes—one of the few Italian texts to do so in the eighteenth century—and wryly suggested that women enjoyed greater sexual pleasures, nonetheless confessed in his autobiographic memoirs that he would rather remain a man: After all this examination, I ask myself if I would consent to be born again as a woman and, curiosity aside, I answer no. I have enough other pleasures as a man which I could not have as a woman, and which make me prefer my sex to the other.66 Casanova enjoyed trying to understand women. To some degree, he was sympathetic to the goals of a select few who had begun to advocate that women should not only be celebrated as prodigies—surpassing the limits of their sex—but educated more broadly. But nothing he observed made him want to assume their position in society, save in the kind of masked ball that made Sade wonder about the Italian penchant for transgressing one's sex. The Italian peninsulas fascination with its female poets, artists, journalists, and philosophers was, in the end, a celebration of their uniqueness. The imaginary community ofpastorelle andfilosofesse, female Arcadians and philosophers, was exactly that: a construction of an ideal in which to deposit the actual accomplishments of a handful of women in various Italian cities to create the myth of the learned lady. Similarly, the fame of a few women painters did not make the arts a comfortable home for women aspiring to exercise their talents, as both Carriera and Kauffman discovered in their efforts to find the right audience for their paintings. The iconic status of these women reaffirmed their function in society. Madame du Boccage sardonically commented during her stay in Naples that all the women she met fashioned themselves as either Minerva or Venus, making learning a kind of endless performance. She particularly admired Maria Angela Ardinghelli (1728-1825), well known for her translations of the scientific work of the experimental physiologist Stephen Hales, for eschewing this sort of vain display and excessive flattery.67 Boccage shrewdly remarked that the men who praised women rarely meant it sincerely, while other women responded by being highly critical of those members of their own sex who aspired to display their talent.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n21\n\nFor the inhabitants of the Italian cities, women of talent and learning were civic monuments, organic expressions of the qualities that made each city individually great. This strong sense of regionalism contrasted markedly with foreign attitudes toward the same phenomenon. For visitors, Bergalli and Camera in Venice, Caminer Turra in Venice and later Vicenza; Bassi, Morandi Manzolini, Tambroni, and Dalle Donne in Bologna; Agnesi, Manzoni, and Grillo Borromeo in Milan; Gorilla Olimpica in Florence and later Rome; and Ardinghelli and Pignatelli in Naples were, much like StaeTs fictional Corinne, expressions of the essence of the Italian character. The Piedmontese writer Baretti sternly rebuked his English readers for leaping to such ridiculous conclusions about the minds and morals of Italian women when he wrote that \"the character of a numerous nation does not depend on a few individuals.\"68 Foreign women who contributed actively to the cultural life of the Italian peninsula were also incorporated into this vision of Italy. Kauffman was indeed an expression of Italy's artistic spirit, just as Emma Hamilton's (ca. 1765-1815) wildly popular \"attitudes,\" a kind of tableau vivant, made her a living antiquity whose performance in Naples perfectly complemented a tour of the recently discovered ruins of Pompeii and Herculaneum and the royal archeological museum. The French artist Elisabeth Vigee-Lebrun was so struck by Hamilton's place in Neapolitan society when she visited in 1790 that she painted her as the image of southern Italy (Figure 1.3). Stae'l would later incorporate elements of Hamilton's dramatic performances into her description of Corinne. Like the Anglo-Venetian Giustiniana Wynne (1732—1791), whose unhappy love affair with Andrea Memmo has recently been transformed into a popular book, Corinne was indeed half-English in a Mediterranean land, a combination of the qualities of Gorilla Olimpica and Lady Hamilton and equally destined for tragedy.69 Of course, there were other images of Italian women in circulation that regarded not their minds but their bodies. As Grand Tourists traveled from one city to another, they tried to assess the differences in social behavior they observed in each location. In which city did women circulate most freely? Some argued for Venice, others for Bologna, Florence, Milan, or Genoa. Were they truly constrained by their piety? No one really thought so. Attempts to understand social conventions among the Italian patricians quickly devolved into stereotypes of Catholic priggishness and sexual promiscuity. \"Before marriage their women are nuns,\" declared Thomas Watkins in 1792, \"and after it libertines.\"70 Boswell predictably took this kind of com-\n\n22\n\nPAULA F I N D L E N\n\nFigure L$ Emma Hamilton portrayed in front of an erupting Vesuvius.

His experiences of Venice, Naples, and Florence in 1765-66 incited a loathing for Italian social customs so bilious that he wrote at length about the bold behavior of women and its effect on men. It was in Venice that he first observed married women rowing up and down the Grand Canal in their gondolas, accompanied not by their husbands but by at least one cicisbeo. By the time he arrived in Naples in November 1765, he condemned this system of male companionship as an \"abominable and infernal fashion\" which ruined marriages (Figure 1.4). Six months later in Florence, he considered himself fully apprised of how this peculiar social\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n23\n\ncustom worked, writing that Florentine ladies took three cicisbei, one to uphold her dignity, another to act as a servant, and a third to be a lover.72 He attributed these practices to a peculiarly Italian inability to distinguish between moral and immoral behavior. Baretti acerbically responded that if Sharps book were ever translated into Italian, his fellow Italians would appoint an exorcist to cure him of these misconceptions. Also the subject of widespread commentary within Italy, cicisbeismo was the social custom that most fascinated foreigners. As early as 1696, a Sienese broadside // cidsbeo tormentato made this figure an icon of the male condition; many plays in the mideighteenth century, most notably the work of Goldoni, feature the cicisbeo as a stock figure of Italian comedy.73 As Roberto Bizzocchi points out, cicisbeismo was not as exclusively Italian as this commentary might have us believe. Muratori, for example, felt it\n\nFigure 1.4 Pietro Longhi, The Visit, 1746. The Metropolitan Museum of Art, Frederick C. Hewitt Fund, 1912 (14.32.2). Image © The Metropolitan Museum of Art.\n\n24\n\nPAULA F I N D L E N\n\nwas a legacy of French customs introduced into Italy in the late seventeenth century.74 Its categorization as an Italian vice, however, says a great deal about how relations between the sexes were perceived from the outside, especially by Protestants visiting a Catholic country. Were the number and names of cicisbei written into some marriage contracts? The German traveler Johann Georg Keyssler certainly thought so, since he (and others) cited a Spinola marriage contract that he heard about during his travels of 1729—30, which excluded the possibility of a wife taking or her husband becoming a cicisbeo, as a sign that this practice was in decline. He found the custom far less distasteful than many Englishmen, writing that while a Genoese woman might have as many as five, they \"all pass under the denomination of Platonic lovers.\"75 De Brosses emphasized that taking a cicisbeo was a matter of honor rather than dishonor in the family. Lalande also considered Sharp incredibly naive in believing that cicisbeismo had anything to do with passion. Baretti also shared this opinion. He argued that cicisbeismo was not a function of loveless marriages and misplaced lust but a sophisticated form of friendship and kinship, a service to a family as much as a relationship with an individual. He defined the etymology of cicisbeo as \"whisperer\" rather than \"adulterer.\" Emphasizing these other aspects of male companionship, he sought to downplay the escalating critique of Italian masculinity which presented the cicisbeo as an enslaved male.76 This image of an emasculated, effeminate Italy filled the pages of books about the Grand Tour. Invoking the other name of the cicisbeo, Boswell wrote to Rousseau from Lucca: \"A cavaliere servente is a being whom I regard as illustrating the last stage of human degradation. A lover without love, a soldier without pay, a being who is more a drudge than a valet de chambre, who does continual duty, and enjoys only appearances!\" Sade more pragmatically lamented that the presence of so many attentive men made it harder for others to get to know Italian women because they had already chosen a \"second husband,\" though Boswell does not seem to have had any problem overcoming this barrier.77 Women travelers were less censorious of cicisbeismo, as were men such as Sir Horace Mann, who resided for many years in Florence and participated in these customs, even introducing a new kind of double chair in his conversazioni which he described to Horace Walpole in 1744 as cicisbeatoii™ Wortley Montagu first observed the custom in Genoa in August 1718, long before she took up residence in Italy. She marveled at \"the Custom of Tetis\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n25\n\nbeys,\" telling her sister that in its earliest incarnation women could choose as many as eight or ten, even though the fashion nowadays was to have only one: Upon my Word, nothing but my own Eyes could have convinc'd [me] there were any such upon Earth. The fashion begun here and is now receiv'd all over Italy, where the Husbands are not such terrible Creatures as we represent them.79 To her eyes, cicisbeismo revealed the advantages of a social system controlled by women, since it was entirely the question of a woman's choice that captured her imagination, the very antithesis of the seraglio of the Sublime Porte she had just left behind at the conclusion of her husband's embassy in Constantinople. Lady Anne Miller, more restrained in her outlook than the flamboyant Lady Mary, instead saw cicisbeismo as the definition of a good, companionate marriage. She recalled her pleasure at seeing an aging couple at a caffe in Piazza San Marco who had spent forty years together, \"and with the most steady constancy had loved each other, till age and disease were conducting them hand in hand together to the grave.\" Thrale Piozzi made light of the custom when she chose an eighty-year-old cleric as her cicisbeo—but she did not see this practice as a sign of moral depravity.80 Criticism of cicisbeismo was simply part of a broader condemnation of Italian men in general—and it is quite striking that none of this commentary condemned the female equivalent, the dcisbea^ who appears frequently in Sir Horace Mann's description of Florentine social life. What had become of the tradition of the proud Romans, whose virility was imitated in the stances taken by British and French sitters for Pompeo Batoni's portraits? (Figure 1.5). In the opinion of many travelers, Italy was a land of Amazons precisely because its men were so enervated and emasculated. After describing an encounter with Bassi in October 1763 to a female correspondent, Coyer remarked: \"What do you say of this Masculine Sappho? Her husband perhaps would have been humiliated to have such a learned wife if he himself had not been learned.\"81 The delicate equilibrium between the sexes was under assault, and it was the women rather than the men who seemed to carry the day. Cicisbeismo was a phenomenon utterly unrelated to the presence of learned women since it was an aristocratic social practice, but it nonetheless confirmed what many visitors suspected: the Italian upper classes must be dominated by a new kind of Amazon. Stael captured this sentiment well when she had Corinne's Scottish lover, Lord Oswald Nelvil,\n\n26\n\nP A U L A F I N D LEN\n\nFigure 1.5 Anonymous gentleman on the Grand Tour.

The prattling cicerone leading tourists around the ruins satirized in the caricatures of Pier Leone Ghezzi (1674—1755) (Figure 1.6), the versifying abbe who inhabited the academy and the salon, and the solicitous cicisbeo who brought his lady chocolate and a dressing gown in the morning and waited upon her in the opera box at night were all representations of men of culture rather than action, a far cry from the image of the Renaissance condottiere of centuries past.83 Among the many dubious etymologies of the word cicisbeo was a definition suggesting possible Greek origins: cicys sbeo. A force extinguished, in other words, effeminate.84 Visi-\n\nI NTROD UCTION\n\n17\n\ntors could not help but conclude that there was something . . . lacking . . . in the Italian male. The preoccupation with what Italian men were not in the eighteenth century reached its culmination in the assessment of the castrato. As Roger Freitas and Martha Feldman discuss in this volume, the castrato was the musical counterpart of the cicisbeo. A man made womanish and gawky in his appearance, with the voice of a young boy, he was a striking figure on the public stage. In the fall of 1775, the Marquis de Sade attended the opera of Perseus and Andromeda in Florence. There was absolutely nothing that pleased him about the performance. What especially horrified him was the voice and appearance of a castrato. \"It was the first time that I saw this species of half-men in a theater,\" he wrote the anonymous female recipient of his letters. He described his repulsion upon hearing \"a small, clear voice, much higher than a woman's emerge from a rather large, fatty,\n\nFigure 1.6 Two Roman antiquarians examining a coin.

He could not believe that any woman would love them, despite reports of the long retired Farinelli's great celebrity. (His body was recently exhumed in July 2006 from the Certosa cemetery in Bologna to examine what remains of his anatomy and physiology.) The celebrity of the castrato fully complemented the longstanding perception of the Italian peninsula as a region that openly tolerated, if not actively promoted, homosexuality. If travel was a transformative experience, would Grand Tourists return from Italy with characteristics of the other sex? The Entertaining Travels and Adventures of Mademoiselle de Richelieu, published around 1740, described an imaginary voyage of a cross-dressing Frenchwoman Alithea, who gave herself \"the Appearance of a Man\" in order to travel. In Italy she and her cross-dressing companion enjoy the attention of both male and female admirers. The response to cross-dressing women travelers indicates how readily foreigners believed Italy to be a land in which the differences between the sexes simply dissolved. Italian women find the French women attractive because they are so feminine, while men find the women's boyishness equally appealing, due to \"that abominable Goust to which the Italian Men are, I am told, addicted.\"86 By the time they reach Rome, Alithea's fondest desire is to seduce another woman. At the end of the decade, John Cleland would translate the physician Giovanni Bianchi's account of the life of the Roman servant Caterina Vizzani, who died for her Sapphic proclivities. Like Sade, he became a moralist in the presence of the Italians, harshly censoring them for neither condemning Vizzani s behavior nor finding the cause of her unnatural desires.87 The fear that women might return from Italy somewhat male—viragos, in the term of the day—was fairly minimal since so few women traveled. Those who did were, by and large, an unconventional group to begin with. Concerns about the effect of the Grand Tour on men, however, were rampant. Would a lengthy stay in Italy make a man half-woman, as many thought the rakish Lord John Hervey and, later, the members of the Society of Dilettanti had become? Moralists warned that this was the inevitable result of such a journey south. By the 17605 the British had a term for the Italianate Englishman: the macaroni (Figure 1.7). A foppish young gentleman with preposterous hair, fancy clothes, and an imported air, he spent entirely too much time at the opera in Covent Garden, where, \"enervated and emasculated by the Softness of the Italian Musick,\" as John Dennis wrote in 1711,\n\nINTRO DUCTION\n\n29\n\nhe ceased to care for women. In June 1770 the Oxford Magazine defined the macaroni as \"neither male nor female, a thing of neuter gender.\"88 He was the foreign equivalent of the castrato. Robert Hitchcock's play, The Macaroni (1773), immortalized this vision of the effect of Italy on Englishmen in the character of Jack Epicene. Recently returned from Venice, his dress is so outlandish that a friend declares: \"you make such large advances to the feminine gender, that in a little time 'twill be difficult to tell to which sex you belong.\" Epicene reflects the failure of the Englishman abroad to resist the vices of other nations. He returns home still willing to marry for the sake of his family but tells\n\nFigure /./ The English macaroni, lately returned from Italy.

His friends finally force him to concede his error, confessing \"that a Macaroni is the most insignificant—insipid—useless—contemptible being—in the whole creation\" and repudiating his \"degenerate, exotic effeminacy.\"89 The English obsession with the alleged homosexuality of the Italians— more a reflection of their own anxieties about sexuality than an actual understanding of the different social norms of the two regions of Europe90—gave them a readymade explanation for their own moral failings. If Englishmen did not always behave like honorable men, it was not due to any intrinsic flaw in the national character but a result of pernicious foreign influence. Italy had seduced and corrupted them. It lured them to the Mediterranean and followed them home across the Channel. With the publication of Montesquieu's influential Spirits of the Laws (1748), a theory emerged to explain the source of this corruption. Montesquieu and a number of his contemporaries believed that climate played a determinative role in the nature of a people. Cold, northern countries were relatively free of vice while warm, southern ones overflowed with a criminal degree of passion. Montesquieu specifically invoked the experience of going to the opera in England and Italy as his best example. The same music, he wrote, that so incited the Italians received a more measured reception in the north. 91 The Italians, he suggested, were naturally enslaved by their passions and therefore sexually degenerate. Baretti strongly objected to this sweeping characterization of the Italians. He reminded his readers that the Italians were not, pace Boswell, a savage race incapable of understanding what had been said about them. Invoking a cosmopolitan Italian readership who consumed the books and essays of all the great London wits and French philosophes, he conjured up their laughter at such preposterous generalizations. How could anyone who had lived in Turin, Milan, Bologna, and Florence in the winter truly believe that the climate of northern and central Italy was significantly more temperate than many parts of northern Europe? Italy was not quite the Mediterranean seraglio Montesquieu envisioned from his travels, and the Italians were not \"a womanish race of people, only fit for fiddling and singing, because they are born under too warm a sun.\" Baretti had his own criticisms of his fellow Italians, but he sought to reclaim their national character by arguing that foreigners viewed Italy like a bad connoisseur who claims but fails to understand a painting. \"They travel to see things, and not men.\"92\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n3!\n\nThe pastorelle, filosofesse, cicisbei, castrati, ciceroni, and even the macaroni were all there to be seen in eighteenth-century Italy, and they are the subject of the chapters that follow. The fact that such individuals did exist and such customs were primarily Italian, in some general sense, raises the question of how local practices and foreign perceptions interacted. If the examination of gender, as Joan Scott famously wrote, is about understanding a system of relations between men and women as well as the crafting of male and female roles in society, then the kind of \"gender trouble\" observed in Italy in the eighteenth century offers us an important window into understanding some crucial facts of this society.93 Perhaps one of the reasons the Italian peninsula did not produce a Mary Wollstonecraft or an Olympe de Gouges, women we associate with the origins of modern feminism, was because the society of eighteenth-century Italy had given women a role, albeit limited and largely ceremonial, in its leading educational and cultural institutions. Aristocratic women had choices beyond marriage, and talented daughters of professionals and artisans could aspire to some degree of public recognition, perhaps even to an artistic, literary, or scientific career. Cicisbei did not simply serve women but also fostered their own social position through networks of friendship and kinship. Castrati existed to fulfill a specific musical vocation that had the approval of the Roman Catholic Church. Despite mounting criticism of these practices in the late eighteenth century, they nonetheless lingered into the nineteenth century, no longer active features of a society under reconstruction in the age of the Risorgimento but vestiges of its early modern past.\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nP A R T\n\nO N E\n\nGender and Public Life\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nO N E\n\nCicisbei Italian Morality and European Values in the Eighteenth Century ROBERTO BIZZOCCHI\n\nSismondi and the Cicisbei In J. C. L. Sismondo Sismondi's portrait of the moral decline of the Italian conscience in the final chapters of his Histoire des republiques (Storia) (1807-1818)—a decline that he attributed to the loss of political and religious freedoms in the sixteenth century—a great deal of space is reserved for the figure of the cicisbeo, the cavalier servente who openly kept company with a married noblewoman, not only in public but also in private. Since the cicisbeo is a figure most commonly associated with the eighteenth century (think, for example, of the \"giovin signore [young gentleman]\" in the famous poem \"II Giorno\" by Giuseppe Parini, 1763), it is all the more interesting that Sismondi speaks of him at the beginning of his chapter on the seventeenth century. It is almost as though the topic pressed upon him with urgency in light of the end of political independence and the\n\nThis chapter is an updated and expanded version of an earlier article published in Italian: \"Cicisbei. La morale italiana,\" Storica 9 (1997), pp. 63-90. Translated by Matthew Sneider.\n\n36\n\nROBERTO\n\nBIZZOCCHI\n\naffirmation of the Counter Reformation. He marvels at the scarce interest dedicated to the theme by other writers: No one has numbered among the public calamities of Italy what is perhaps the most general reason for the private troubles of all Italian families; the offense, I say, made to the sacred bond of matrimony by another open bond, regarded as honorable, which foreigners always witness in Italy with equal stupor, without understanding the reason—the cicisbei or the cavalieri serventi. The cicisbei remain the protagonists in the successive pages on Italian corruption, from which I can cite here only a few phrases: \"no husband regarded his consort any longer as a faithful companion and partner for life . . . no father dared assure himself that the children of his marriage were his.\" In this manner \"the institution of all the ridiculous duties of the cicisbei' was \"the most efficacious means of calming agitated spirits recently reduced to servitude.\" Sismondi even claims that \"not because certain women had lovers, but rather because a woman could no longer show herself in public without a lover, Italians ceased to be men.\"1 The final section of Sismondi's Histoire is a fundamental text for Italian culture and the image of modern Italy. On the one hand, the Histoire was at the center of attention for and the focus of debates of the nineteenth century's greatest intellectuals, beginning with Alessandro Manzoni, who in 1819 wrote Osservazioni sulla morale cattolica to refute the text. On the other hand, Sismondi's invocation of this kind of male behavior revived with greater authority this image of relations between the sexes in Italy that had previously been popularized by a long series of tales, reliable or otherwise, and through judgments, often very negative and contemptuous, reported over the course of the eighteenth century by foreign travelers who came into contact with Italians during their Grand Tours. On cicisbei Sismondi seems particularly to echo the pages of the Englishman Samuel Sharp, whose words were so ferocious as to immediately provoke a resentful response by Italian writer Giuseppe Baretti.2 Cicisbei are an interesting subject for two reasons: first, for the reality of the social phenomenon that they represent, and second, for the national stereotype which was constructed around them. The present chapter deals to a greater degree with the latter issue, but it also seeks to shed some light on the former, although the documentary research here is still in its beginning stages.\n\nCICISBEI\n\n37\n\nScholars and Cicisbei A bibliography on the topic of cicisbeismo is not lacking. This bibliography, however, dates primarily to the period between the end of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth; it is composed almost entirely of works by positivist scholars of Italian literature. I note this last fact to clarify the intellectual attitude that marks the greater part of our body of knowledge on the topic: an attitude which mixes, in a manner characteristic of such scholars, moralism and spicy anecdote, erudition and frivolity. It is an attitude in which the most crucial of questions is ever present, sometimes below the surface and sometimes, amusingly, quite in the open: did they do it or didn't they? That certain responses to this question have been offered which contradict Sismondi is not terribly important. On the other hand it is worth noting that almost all scholars of cicisbei follow Sismondi, perhaps unconsciously, in his sociological characterization of the phenomenon. I take Luigi Valmaggi as an example of the general tendency. Valmaggi was a cautious follower, regarding the crucial curiosity, of the idea of omnia munda mundis', he was the author of a 1927 book which reprised and reordered the scholarship of recent decades, allowing him to review broadly the eighteenth-century literary sources.3 The cicisbeismo which emerges from Valmaggi's book is an (innocent) peculiarity of the eighteenth-century Italian nobility, an unexplained unicum in the history of human civilization. Apart from its innocence, the relevant point is that the specialized studies confirm, in an entirely different historiographic context, the gist of Sismondi's description: his political and moral dramatization of cicisbeismo in relation to servitude and the Counter Reformation would not even be conceivable without enclosing and isolating its usage to Italy, in the early modern period and in the ruling class. In times and in the hands of spirits much closer to ourselves, the theme of cicisbei has been the object of three analyses which have a scholarly acuity lacking in those of the early twentieth century. Luciano Guerci has the merit of having gathered and interpreted eighteenth-century treatises (which Valmaggi must have judged less amusing than the poems and the accounts of travelers) and, above all, of having connected the gallantry of the cavalieri serventi to the \"sociability\" of conversations and salons.4 Romano Canosa has placed the custom in the context of the sexual repression promoted by Catholic moralists, in his opinion substantially victorious\n\n38\n\nROBERTO BIZZOCCHI\n\nin imposing chastity in every nonconjugal relationship between men and women.5 Finally, Marzio Barbagli has dedicated to husbands and cicisbei a brief but dense paragraph in his important book on the family where, following a famous page of Cesare Beccaria, he relates \"gallantry\" and cicisbeismo to the absence of \"freedom in marriage\"—the ability to choose one's spouse. In this sense, cicisbeismo was a practice which offered a controlled outlet for impulses of physical attraction, friendship, and \"sympathy.\"6 When one examines the historical sociology of marital or extramarital relations between the sexes, the cavalier servente ceases to be the ridiculous marionette of erudite literati or the tragic puppet of Sismondi. He remains, however, a human specimen specific to eighteenth-century Italian nobility. Barbagli, who like Guerci and Canosa,7 shares this conviction with his predecessors, makes the objection which occurs spontaneously at this point: if the cicisbeo is related to the absence of freedom in marriage—a fact widespread also outside of Italy—why does the custom appear characteristic of the Italian aristocracies? I propose to reformulate the very premise of this question. Contracts and Cicisbei An important component of this image of cicisbeismo as a peculiarly Italian custom is the prevailing conviction that it had the character of a legally regulated institution. In fact, Barbagli argues that the usage was legally fixed: \"The cicisbeo was chosen jointly by wife and husband and was sometimes provided for in the nuptial contracts.\"8 This affirmation is not accompanied by reference to any evidence. In reality it is an opinion repeated many times before Barbagli, whose proof, however, remains rather vague. In his book on Parini, Cesare Cantu asserts that \"in nuptial contracts it was stipulated that a cavalier servente be given to the lady, and a specific individual was sometimes even named.\" This assertion is accompanied by a note, however, which speaks of a sonnet by Parini in praise of a woman who does not have a cicisbeo.9 Giosue Carducci, also speaking of Parini, repeats the thesis of the \"cavalier servente stipulated and even designated by the nuptial contracts,\" adding that \"when the Marquis Spinola, in mideighteenth century Genoa, acted in a contrary fashion—stipulating his refusal of any servente—it appeared singular and inconvenient.\"10 Note that this is an accord regarding the absence, and not the presence, of the cicisbeo. In any event, Carducci depends for this information on Achille Neri, one\n\nc i c i s BEI\n\n39\n\nof the positivist literati to whom I made reference above, who in his turn depends on the legal historian Carlo Gabba, who depends on still others—a mechanism of Chinese boxes in which reference to any specific notarial act seems to have been lost.11 A notarial act marked with a place, a date (Rome, September 17, 1793), and a notary's name (Felci), appears and is also partially published in a zibaldone, an anecdotal book written around the time of Neri's study. The author, David Silvagni, reports for several pages on the patrimonial agreements contained in the nuptial contract between don Paluzzo Altieri and donna Marianna di Sassonia where—he comments—\"there was not the usual promise to grant to the bride . . . a cavalier servente of her liking, as was the usage and as we have read in the contract of a Visconti woman married into the house of the Marsciano counts.\"12 Silvagni, however, shows us nothing of this Visconti-Marsciano contract. Among the authoritative scholars of our own day, Paolo Ungari, in his fundamental book on the family law, has explicitly dealt with the problem of legal formalization: Leaving aside the possibility of documenting pacts regarding the cicisbeo in nuptial contracts, which are attested by many, the series of accessory stipulations . . . , all of which clearly preordain an independent social and sentimental life, are interesting and very easy to document. The \"accessory stipulations\" are those which regarded the \"treatment\" of the wife—allowance, servants, carriage, box at the opera, and so on. Ungari exhibits notarial formulas regarding this treatment. But he can adduce not one nuptial contract which includes agreement over a cicisbeo, despite the caricatured representation of a contract's stipulation in Vittorio Alfieri's satirical comedy Ildivorzio.1^ In his book on eighteenth-century Venice, the French historian Jean Georgelin, on the trail of an unsubstantiated reference by Philippe Monnier, also went in search of notarial stipulations of agreement on cicisbei: \"The anecdote—he concludes—had the success that one might imagine. But the examination of thousands upon thousands of noble marriage contracts obliges us to deny it: we have not found even one which mentions it!'14 I can declare the same thing—for what my tens of contracts, added to the thousands, are worth—regarding the Tuscan contracts which I have read. In conclusion, even if we cannot argue that the phenomenon of legal stipulation never existed, we can regard it as being much less pervasive than\n\n40\n\nROBERTO\n\nBIZZOCCHI\n\nmany studies on cicisbeismo imply. Until contrary proof conies to light, it will be correct to regard cicisbeismo as more a common practice than a legal institution.\n\nCompart and Cicisbei The fact that cicisbeismo may not have been a matter of law and contracts reveals some interesting dimensions of this social practice. The less one insists on the institutionalized role and the crystallized artificiality of the relationship of cicisbeato, the more we may consider it within the overall reality of relations between the sexes and therefore contextualize it in an environment rather far from the literary satire of Parini's giovin signore. The existence of recognized and overt ties between men and women, ties which are independent of and prior to—but also contemporary with and parallel to—the engagement and marriage of one or both of the parties with another person, has been attested among the populations of various parts of Italy and Europe for centuries, almost up to the eve of the sexual freedom of our own time. The most obvious of these ties is godparenthood—the bond of spiritual family relations and familiar intimacy which is created between godfather and godmother and between these two and the godchild and parents. We do not need Boccaccio's slyness (novellas VII, 3 and 10; novella X, 4) to imagine opportunities for adulterous sex in the relative freedom of encounter conceded to godfathers and godmothers. But for our purposes this sacramental and technically circumscribed family relation is less interesting than a generic and widespread usage which clearly has some relation to baptism—as demonstrated by its most common name, godparenthood of San Giovanni (comparatico di San Giovanni), and the importance of the feast of San Giovanni on June 24—which nevertheless has as its principal function the creation of a couple. This couple is generally, but not exclusively, composed of a male and a female and in fact is almost always a young man and a young woman. Numerous variants of this usage exist. The most dramatic is the presence of a girl pretending to be a mother who baptizes a doll. We find an example of the former in the following description from Barile in Basilicata in 1889: On the feast of San Giovanni . . . a great number of boys and girls move from the village. . . . the girls carry dolls wrapped in swaddling clothes in\n\nC ICISBEI\n\n41\n\ntheir arms. When they arrive at the clearing of San Pietro the girls take turns choosing the godfather and the godmother, and they ask them to baptize their newborns. So in every little group the girl-mother places her little one sweetly on the ground and the two little godparents, holding each other by the hand, jump over it three times, holding their feet together, while pronouncing the following formula. . . . Pupe de San Giuanne I battezzame sti panne I Sti panne so bbattezzate I tutte compare sime chiamate (Babes of San Giovanni / We baptize these bundles / These bundles are baptized / Now we are all godparents). In many similar cases, though not necessarily in this case, the relations of godparenthood created by these rituals last \"for life.\"15 The other principal variant of comparatico di San Giovanni seems to be situated in a decidedly more adult sphere. Let me give an example: In Sardinia there is a special relation of godparenthood called godparenthood of San Giovanni. Its ties do not last longer than one year. It is generally created between married persons, without leaving space for suppositions or suspicions regarding the parties to the contract, and it concludes in the following manner. . . . On the feast of San Giovanni the godfather and the godmother take [a vase] and, followed by many people in attendance, they move toward the church. Once there, one of the two throws the vase against the door and the entire crowd eats an herb omelet together. Thereafter each person, placing his or her hands on those of the male or female near to them, sings out over and over: compare e comare di San Giovanni (godfathers and godmothers of San Giovanni). Once this has been done, there are many hours of dancing which bring the festival to an end.16 Agnes Fine, author of a notable book on spiritual family relations which includes diverse cases of godparenthood of San Giovanni, or its equivalent, in Mediterranean Europe (Italy, Spain, Portugal, Albania, and Dalmatia), gathered from a Corsican peasant a typology dating to the 19305. It mixes certain characteristics of the preceding two examples, because it focuses on young but unmarried adults and is not limited to one year. Consequently \"it often happened that a real friendship grew up and survived the marriage of one or the other. At public dances, for example, the godfather invited the godmother to have the first dance without her husband taking offense.\" The old peasant explains: They were thought of as brother and sister. It wasn't a little ceremony that you would forget overnight. For their lives, they were faithful to it ... it was a sort of vow. That [sexual relations] wasn't a part of it. What's more,\n\n42\n\nROBERTO BIZZOCCHI\n\nI believe that here in the region there has never been a marriage between cumma e cumpa de San Ghjuani [godmother and godfather of San Giovanni]! They were like brother and sister.17 Just like certain late-nineteenth-century literary critics and many contemporary ethnographers, the Corsican peasant expresses a presumption of chastity which was not at all shared by the bishops who dealt with godparenthood of San Giovan"
