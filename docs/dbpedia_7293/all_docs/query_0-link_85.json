It is not an encyclopedia of Italian women writers, although, of course, many writers considered here are women; it is rather a companion volume for all those who wish to investigate Italian literary culture and writings, penned by women and men, in a feminist perspective. In its comprehensive treatment of feminist themes, this volume complements Italian Women Writers, another Greenwood publication, which gathers fifty-one monographic chapters by a team of specialists on the most prominent Italian literary women from the fourteenth century to the present. In its introduction, that volume also sketches a history of women writers in Italy. Over the last twenty years, there has been an increasing interest in feminist views of the Italian literary tradition both in Europe and in the United States. While in this country the acceptance of feminist theory and methodology by the academy is an achieved goal, in Italy studies and programs about women’s writing have been sketched so far almost entirely outside the universities. A great deal of critical work in this field has been done within the small programs of Italian studies, in the departments of history and comparative literature in academic institutions outside Italy. Among the general, college-educated readers, knowledge about feminist approaches to Italian writing, and even about the existence of Italian women writers, remains scanty. This encyclopedia, with its companion volume Italian Women Writers, intends to make available for the first time to a wide public a field of intellectual endeavor that is now open only to a few specialists.\n\nviii\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nAs the title indicates, this encyclopedia is about literature in the traditional sense of the word. This is appropriate in the case of Italian literary culture. If a tradition of Italian popular literature written by men is scanty and intermittently traced, one may state without fear of contradiction that, with the exception of writing by religious women, few literary forms and examples of female expression remain other than those provided by canonical genres. No corpus of letters, diaries, or other types of female literary outlet, has been found and collected in Italy, besides those already known in literary circles. With a few exceptions of self-taught ladies—St. Catherine of Siena, for example, and, in this century, Grazia Deledda, who won the Nobel Prize in 1926—the women who in Italy have consigned thoughts and feelings to paper were generally women with a formal, though often private, education, who set out to write in a self-conscious manner and were prone to engage themselves in canonical genres. Only with the recent onset of the feminist movement, some women writers have used popular forms or created new transgeneric forms of writing in order to say what traditional genres would not allow. Letter writing is a good example. In the Renaissance—when most members of the Italian upper class used the written word for many exigencies and vagaries of social intercourse—several women wrote letters, some of which were published in collectanea during their lifetime. Letter writing was already a highly developed genre, used either as polite conversation carried out long-distance among social equals, or, at a more formal level, as a means of projecting an idealized self onto the public arena. Since the sixteenth century and throughout modern times, letters have been written almost exclusively by literary rather than ordinary women; they were addressed to sponsors or lovers who also were literary people, and have been of interest to scholars for the importance of the men to whom they were addressed. There are reasons for this situation that are specifically Italian. The separation between the small elite of professional intellectuals and other classes has perhaps always been greater in Italy than in northern European countries. From the sixteenth century up to World War II, this was as much due to a condition of widespread illiteracy, which kept wide the gap between the literate few and the illiterate many, as to the tradition of strong cultural controls that, throughout the centuries, various governments, institutions, and political parties have exercised over those with a literary bent. At the same time high culture has always been rigidly institutionalized, and women, while not totally excluded from it, have been cramped by the very sponsorship they received. Understanding the relationship of these women to literature and writing is important. It is not only crucial to those feminists who wish to expose the roots of patriarchal oppression, but also to the readers who want to become acquainted with western cultural tradition at large. In fact, the ideological parameters for representing early modern women in the West were established to a great extent by the major fourteenth-century Italian authors—such as Dante, Boccaccio, and Petrarch—and by those sixteenth-century writers in the vernacular who epitomize the literary achievement of the Renaissance. The fate of Italian women writers was indeed\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nix\n\ndecisive in shaping the destiny of European women of letters for centuries to come. Particularly significant are the sudden appearance of women on the social and literary scene in the sixteenth century, their subjugation to the moralistic control of the church, and the absorption of their literary talents to the demands of patriarchal middle-class society in the ages that followed. In order to be useful to scholars of different orientations, this encyclopedia is impartial to all brands of feminist approach. This does not mean, however, that discussing works by a woman is to be considered per se a feminist exercise, for women writers, as any other, can, and often do share assumptions that are, or are considered to be, pernicious to them and other women. When scarce or no critical feminist material existed on certain subjects, the contributors have delineated new approaches and made suggestions for a possible new treatment. In this manner, to the admiration and gratification of the editor, the encyclopedia not only has become a valuable map of feminist criticism, but it has also created the very foundations of a subject women might want to explore. The entries, written in an accessible language, cover eight centuries of Italian literature. They fall in several categories, their selection within each category depending on their relevance to Italian culture and to the development of feminist reflection. Many entries focus on authors, women and men, who either have already attracted the interest of feminist scholarship or are proposed here for the first time as interesting subjects of study. As stated above, many canonical male writers included in this volume were influential in shaping images of women and gender relations in western society. Other lesser-known male writers, who have occupied a marginal place in the canon, are present here because of their special relevance in a woman writer’s perspective. The female writers, on the other hand, either have identified themselves as feminists or have been absorbed, to various degrees of awareness, by relations between the sexes and by the problems connected with them. All authors are listed alphabetically by their family name. The only exceptions are Dante Alighieri, who is better known under his first name, and Moderata Fonte, whose express wish was to appear in print only under her pseudonym. In the entries for authors, a brief presentation of their total output generally precedes a feminist discussion. Many other entries are dedicated to historical periods and literary-cultural movements that are either of European import or specifically Italian—such as Enlightenment, futurism, humanism, modernism/postmodernism, Petrarchism, Renaissance, Risorgimento, scapigliatura, and verismo. After a presentation of the period’s or movement’s main features, each of these entries discusses why that period was or was not conducive to women’s writing, or with what effects that cultural current was favorable or hostile to women. Other entries in this volume analyze disciplines, schools of thought, and trends in criticism that influenced the shaping of a feminist perspective, such as Aristotelianism, deconstruction, feminism, Marxism, new historicism, Platonism, and psychoanalysis. Other subjects, like cicisbeismo, questione della lingua, and weak thought, are considered here for the first time in relation to feminist positions. Jewish fiction before the Holocaust\n\nx\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nwas never discussed before in any critical context, one more reason for including it here. The volume also considers feminist literary criticism of Italian literature as it has developed in Canada, England, Ireland, Italy, and the United States. Women philosophers, such as Adriana Cavarero and Luisa Muraro, whose theorization centers on women’s identity, have been given individual space. Literary and theatrical genres, including opera, are discussed in several entries, which explain how they originated, why they were important in Italian literature, and which ones were especially cultivated by women. Themes, ideas, and issues that have figured prominently in the lives as well as in the imagination of women—for example, abortion, female bonding, disease, dress, food, incest, tradition, and work—are also discussed, because they loomed large in the social context of the relations between the sexes and of literature. There are social types and stereotypes of women, showing how they were categorized and constrained throughout history and how they are represented in writing: actress, comare, courtesan, enchantress, mulier sancta, learned woman, nun, saint, shepherdess. Some legal, medical, and social issues—such as abortion, class struggle, cross-dressing, gynecology, hysteria, and prostitution, are also considered here for the great effect they had on women’s condition and on the imagination of both sexes. Various forms of women’s spirituality are discussed in the entries dedicated to devotional works, hagiography, mulieres sanctae, mysticism, and theological works. Those who wish to know how homoeroticism, homosexuality, and lesbianism have been represented in Italian literature will turn to the relative entries and to the discussions on cross-dressing and hermaphrodites. There are also entries dealing with women’s publishing and publications, as well as with women associations or collectives like the Diotima Group, Societa` italiana delle letterate, and Societa` italiana delle storiche. Finally, because of cinema’s importance in shaping the imagination of writers and the public, and because film courses are usually included in the programs of Italian studies, there is one entry on film, as well as one on the best-known Italian woman director, Lina Wertmu¨ller. Entries vary in length and internal organization according to their relevance to feminist studies and to the interest shown by feminist scholars. They are all signed, with the exception of those written by the editor. A certain amount of overlapping has been allowed, in order to offer a large contextual coverage as well as a variety of viewpoints. In each entry, the discussion was planned to offer a general presentation of the subject and a critical exposition of the works written on it from a feminist perspective. A short selected bibliography is appended to almost all entries; the works are presented in chronological sequence in order to give an idea of the precedence of, and the possible relationship between the studies done on the subject. To indicate that an author or topic is dealt with in another entry, an asterisk has been placed after it. Many entries are provided with cross-references identifying contiguous subjects that are discussed elsewhere.\n\nThe Feminist Encyclopedia of Italian Literature\n\nA Abortion. In 1978 both chambers of the Italian parliament passed Law 194, which liberalized abortion. Abortion was a pivotal issue to the feminist movement, which insisted that the right to choose was critical to social acceptance of women as adult human beings and moral agents. Motherhood was largely viewed under the ideological sway of Catholicism and through the patriarchal model of the woman-mother manufactured by scientific discourses in the late 1800s and recodified by Fascist rhetoric (an unrepealed Fascist law defined abortion as a crime ‘‘against the race’’). Behind this idealized picture, however, lurked a reality shaped by humiliating out-of-wedlock births, unsafe illegal abortions, and, in some extreme cases, infanticide. La storia (History, 1974) by Elsa Morante (1912–1985) paints a compelling picture of this reality: history (World War II), as refracted through the humble microcosm of a widow, removed from the Fascist solemnization of motherhood, is inaugurated by the woman’s rape and by the illegitimate birth of her baby. Abortion, particularly while the political battles for its legalization were escalating, was depicted by prominent women authors. In Donna in guerra (Woman at war, 1975) by Dacia Maraini* (1936–), maternity is the result of conjugal rape; both the consummation of a degraded marriage and the physical consequences of an illegal abortion are symptomatic of societal brutality against women. In Natalia Ginzburg’s (1916–1991) Caro Michele (Dear Michael, 1973), where the agonizing decision is recalled by a man, Michele, there is only a fleeting allusion to his offer to pay for the abortion of a former girlfriend. Oriana Fallaci*’s (1929–) Lettera a un bambino mai nato (Letter to an unborn child, 1975), perhaps the best-known reflection on the ambiguities and apprehensions\n\n2\n\nABORTION\n\ninvolved in parenthood, stages the trial of an unborn child against his mother, and ends with a pessimistic evaluation of life. Elena Gianini Belotti*’s Il fiore dell’ibisco (The hibiscus flower, 1985), written after the abortion law was implemented, presents an inventory of the societal changes brought about by the feminist movement through the encounter between a former governess and the man she had looked after twenty years earlier, before leaving to get an abortion. With the exception of Ginzburg’s text, which dramatizes the point of view of a man, abortion is never viewed as an isolated phenomenon, but as a manifestation of socially ingrained patterns of violence and domination of women. The political discussion over abortion, significantly, was not treated by the feminist movement as an issue regarding exclusively women’s reproductive functions, but as a symptom of widespread sexism in society. The decriminalization of abortion, thus, was the culmination of a series of successful campaigns for a divorce legislation (1970), the revocation of the ban against advertising contraception (1971), a legislation for working mothers and nursery schools (1971), the institution of equality between the sexes (1975), the establishment of family planning clinics (1975), and equal pay for equal work (1977). When in the midst of bitter political debates a bill legalizing abortion was passed in 1978, the Christian Democratic Party petitioned with the right for a referendum to repeal Law 194, and fostered a climate of intense hostility toward the feminist movement by appealing to the cultural and ideological hold of Catholicism and family-related values. Two referenda were held in May 1981. The one sponsored by the feminist movement and the Radical Party, introducing free abortion on demand, was defeated by 88 percent of the votes; the Catholic antiabortion motion, however, was also defeated by 67 percent vote (a larger outpouring of support than that obtained by the pro-divorce coalition in the 1974 referendum). Law 194 did not meet all the demands of the feminist movement, which had pressed for free and state-subsidized abortion for all women. The decision to carry out an abortion was formally left to the doctor, and the woman had to be at least eighteen years old and seek to terminate her pregnancy within the first trimester. Law 194, however, introduced a window of opportunity for women’s self-determination and, most important, it showed that the alliance of the feminist movement with lay forces could bring about a significant victory in an open confrontation with state power and male-dominated institutions.

The main issues that liberal, protofeminist writers confront in the Ottocento are the need for divorce,* improved work conditions, universal education, the control of prostitution,* and the acceleration of social reform. The most prolific woman writer and propagandist among the Ottocento activists was Princess Cristina Trivulzio* di Belgioioso (1808–1871). Belgioioso, despite bouts of ill-health and various enemies, defied the Austrian authorities, chose exile in France, edited journals, wrote histories of the early Church and eyewitness accounts of the risorgimento,* organized an ambulance service in the Rome uprising of 1849, and founded a nursery school and Utopian farm in Lombardy and at Ciaq-Mag-Oglou in Turkey, thus creating an amalgam of the contemporary woman of action and letters. Indeed, at Naples in March 1848 she hired a steamboat to transport herself and a corps of two hundred volunteers to Genova, to swell the Milan insurrection. Just months later, she wrote an analysis of the same events in a series of articles run by the Revue des deux mondes, published in Paris. In 1866 she published an essay, ‘‘Della presente condizione delle donne e del loro avvenire,’’ suggesting that Italy’s new national unity could afford to educate interested and qualified females. She concedes that only the armed forces and the magistracy should remain closed to women. The protagonist of the novel Emma Walder (1893), by Bruno Sperani* (pseudonym of Beatrice Speraz), visits estates worked by her father’s tenants and listens to their complaints. When her beneficiaries call her ‘‘ganza . . . zingara’’ (paramour . . . gypsy), she shoulders the scorn aimed at a woman’s activism and tries to overcome her limitations as a ‘‘dishonored’’ woman. Sibilla Aleramo,* in Una donna (1906), tells how she and the writer Giovanni Cena started elementary school rooms for disadvantaged children in the Agro romano, after her liberating, life-enhancing flight from an unsatisfactory marriage. In Io e il mio lettore (1910), the liberal journalist Donna Paola (pseudonym of Paola Baronchelli Grosson, born 1866) denounces the constriction of women by the Catholic catechism, the banality of indissoluble marriage, and the grotesqueness of sex legalized by monogamy. This is an early feminist cahier de dole´ances, where anger is mingled with compassion, about the falling, shot, disfigured, punched, tortured, and murdered women in the daily round of the world. Donna Paola reaches an anarchist position: since women cannot obtain fair laws by tabling petitions, they must resort to a ‘‘love strike,’’ that is, the withholding of conjugal relations. Many of these voices of early activism were collected in a rash of new journals—Un comitato di donne, La donna italiana, La donna, La donna e la famiglia, and La missione della donna—and they were strengthened by the translation of foreign women writers—notably Elizabeth Barrett, Harriet Beecher Stowe, and George Sand. Later they were subsumed in the essays and\n\n4\n\nACTIVISM: TWENTIETH CENTURY\n\njournalism of Anna Kuliscioff (1857–1925), a socialist on the fringe of anarchism, who founded the journal Critica sociale with Filippo Turati (1891) and helped to promulgate the social philosophy of Engels and Marx. Kuliscioff contributed to the 1892 amalgamation of Turati’s neo-Socialist group with the Partito Operaio Indipendente (started by Costantino Lazzari in 1881) into the new Partito Socialista Italiano. Its part in the popular uprising in Milan in May 1898 led to her arrest, together with Filippo Turati, Leonida Bissolati, and the Catholic leader, Davide Albertario, editor of Osservatore cattolico. In 1912 Kuliscioff declared epigrammatically, ‘‘any Italian who wants to enjoy citizenship must take just one precaution: be born male.’’ See also: Novel: Risorgimento; Women’s Periodicals: From 1860 to the Early Twentieth Century.

Since the beginning of the feminist movement in the latter part of the nineteenth century, Italian feminists have promoted group activism to produce change in the social, literary, and political realms. In 1881, Anna Maria Mozzoni (1837–1920)—who wrote several books and articles deploring the Mazzinian vision of woman as the angel of the hearth (‘‘angelo del focolare’’) and translated John Stuart Mill’s Subjugation of Women— founded the League to Promote Female Interests (Lega promotrice degli interessi femminili) to promote women’s entrance and equality in public areas such as law, education, and work. This organization and others—such as the National Council of Women (Consiglio Nazionale Donne Italiane, 1904) and the National Suffrage Committee (Pro Suffragio, 1904)—however, were not successful in improving women’s economic and social status, for Italy’s reunification did not develop a flourishing middle-class culture and the political tensions between Catholics, Liberals, Socialists and, later, Fascists were great. Nonetheless, by the 1920s, a limited public sphere for women was created through the formation of primarily bourgeois women’s philanthropic, medical, and journalist groups. The Italian Resistance against the German occupation (1943–1945), in which approximately fifty-five thousand women participated, is often considered to be the prototype for the type of activism (with mass mobilization and militant action promoting change in the social, political, and literary areas) that characterized the movements of feminists, workers, and students in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nACTIVISM: TWENTIETH CENTURY\n\n5\n\nWomen’s groups formed after the war, notably the Union of Italian Women (Unione delle Donne Italiane, 1944), moved successfully to reactivate prewar support for women’s suffrage and to reverse setbacks in legal reforms, despite the reemergence of disagreements within the political parties concerning how to define and deal with women’s issues. In the 1960s, a new generation of feminists favoring the integration of women’s issues into the general strategy of the Communist Party mobilized together with the students’ (1968) and workers’ (1969) rebellions. New women’s groups bearing more radical names proliferated (Lotta Continua, Gruppo Demistificazione Autoritarianismo, Rivolta Femminile, Fronte Italiano di Liberazione Femminile, Movimento di Liberazione della Donna). The strong ties of these groups to the Italian Communist Party helped pass legislation legalizing birth control, divorce,* and abortion,* and establishing a new family code that abolished the supremacy of the husband and father. Attempts by Christian Democrats to limit these gains for women as well as debates inside the Communist Party were met with the formulation within women’s groups of theories of originary and nonnegotiable differences between the sexes and with practices of separatism. The newly formed groups overwhelmingly rejected emancipationist philosophies that strove to win equality in a masculine society, thus forcing women to harmonize work and family to their detriment. In the 1970s and 1980s, separatist groups articulated theories on women’s subjectivity, differences, and sexuality, with the intent of forming and putting into practice a feminist political perspective that would reshape the public sphere according to two essentially different natures, male and female, instead of one masculine nature masquerading as a universal one. Although it is sometimes objected that Italian feminist theory and practice has shifted toward more private interests, Italian feminists continue to remain active in the political domain. The removal of the ‘‘Carta delle donne’’—a document outlining the theory of women’s essential difference from men—from the new platform of the Democratic Party of the Left (formerly the Communist Party) in 1991 is more indicative of continuing tensions among political parties than of the failure of women to impose their desires in the political realm. Women hold more than 35 percent of the positions in the Communist Party. Although gains are no longer as visible and dramatic as those made when the new laws on family, divorce, and abortion were passed, group activism continues in the proliferation of feminist publishing houses, bookstores, scholarly journals, and over one hundred women’s cultural centers and cooperatives, which have introduced the woman question on all levels of Italian society. These centers serve as sites for a general renegotiation of women’s status within the political system. See also: Fascism; Feminist Theory: Italy; Marxism.

From the beginning of the sixteenth century, letters and chronicles describing court entertainments refer to women who appeared as nymphs, dancers, singers, musicians, and probably actresses, although men also played women’s roles. The founding of professional theater toward the middle of the century gave actresses social standing, legal recognition, earnings, and a place on stage. Eight men signed the first known contract for a professional company in Padua in 1545. In 1564 six persons, including a woman named Lucretia of Siena, formed a similar acting company. Audience enthusiasm for actresses ran high, and women soon headed companies or joined them as prima or seconda donna or serva (also servetta). In the years 1570 to 1780, according to a count taken by Cesare Molinari, there were 550 comedians dell’arte, of whom 160 were women. These companies were professional (i.e., dell’arte) and trained to act all’improvviso, although not all performances were improvised and the same troupes performed fully scripted plays, such as Battista Guarini’s Pastor fido (1589). Playing an innamorata, the prima donna (first lady) commanded a repertory of witty conceits and solemn pronouncements on love, invented by her or learned from tradition. Audiences praised both what she said and how well she recited her part. Rivalries between highly celebrated prime donne encouraged audience enthusiasm. In 1567–1568 a Roman actress called Flaminia brought her troupe to Mantua, where she performed in a comedy with Pantalone and in the tragedy of Dido changed into a tragicomedy. Competing performances by Vincenza Armani divided the town into followers of one prima donna or the other; a year later Armani died of poisoning. Scandal, travel, and the disturbances actresses incited encouraged society to view them as little better than courtesans. Yet, despite their low social prestige, many actresses pursued careers offering personal and economic independence. The erudite Isabella Canali Andreini, distinguished poet and faithful wife of the comic actor Francesco Andreini, enhanced the respectability of her profession. When she died in Lyon in 1604, miscarrying her eighth child, she was given a grand public funeral; Torquato Tasso,* Giambattista Marino, Gabriello Chiabrera, and others praised her in verse. On stage, Andreini won fame in a\n\nACTRESS: SIXTEENTH TO EIGHTEENTH CENTURIES\n\n7\n\nscenario that portrayed ‘‘Isabella’’ driven to madness by thwarted love. A letter describing her performance during the wedding festivities for the Grand Duke Ferdinand de’ Medici and Christine of Lorraine in Florence in 1589 recounts that, after Vittoria Piisimi had played her signature role as a gypsy (La Zingara), Isabella triumphed with an original mad scene in which she sang in French, spoke foreign languages, and imitated the dialects of her fellow actors. Her representation of madness as a loss of identity expressed by speaking in other voices and in song was taken up in opera, most notably in Gaetano Donizetti’s Lucia di Lammermoor (1835). Feminist criticism has interpreted Lucia’s coloratura madness as a leap to freedom from the male order that denied her choice and happiness in love. The development of opera* in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries was linked to commedia dell’arte. Since a number of professional actresses were also skilled musicians and singers, they performed in both kinds of theater. Virginia Ramponi-Andreini, Isabella’s daughter-in-law, for example, sang the title role in Monteverdi’s Arianna after the scheduled singer fell ill. Operatic roles linked to commedia dell’arte include the figure of the serva. Susanna in Mozart’s Le Nozze di Figaro (1786), with a libretto by Lorenzo Da Ponte, is a strong character consistent with the figure of the maidservant on the eighteenthcentury stage. The serva attends one of the play’s ladies, although she might be an innkeeper or the wife of a manservant. There was only one serva in a company. Her stage language was generally Tuscan. In the early period of commedia dell’arte, the serva was an older woman, experienced and earthy, dressed in a plain, nurselike uniform. The later maidservant matches in wit and resourcefulness, flirts with, and dresses like the male Arlecchino; she is the servetta who changes her character on demand. Carlo Goldoni* disapproved of the actresses’ practice of changing speech and costume according to the character they played. His solution was to control characterization by writing all the lines in his plays; yet the figure of a high-tempered, independent donna di spirito throughout his work is based on the playwright’s observation of the servette who interpreted his roles. Goldoni’s artful servette utilize acting skills, by impersonating others and pretending to be who they are not. His plots, however, sustain middle-class values, and in the end the maidservant is kept in her place. Carlo Gozzi, committed to theatrical fantasy and patrician social values, developed in his ten Fiabe two female characterizations with strong feminist traits: Turandot and Cherestanı` (in La Donna Serpente), the first an imaginary Chinese princess, the second a half-fairy Queen of Eldorado. Both of these women exercise extraordinary power to avoid conventional marriages: Turandot demands the head of all men who fail to answer her riddles; Cherestanı` demands to be kissed when she has taken the form of a serpent. Although these two heroines are exceptions in Gozzi’s work, their tales disclose their author’s awareness that marriages made to serve the interests of society may violate women’s needs. Possibly\n\n8\n\nAESTHETICS\n\nGozzi attained insight into the female personality as a young man in Dalmatia, when he performed as the company’s servetta in a male acting troupe.

Aesthetics was developed as a philosophy of art in the mideighteenth century. It consists of a speculative and a practical branch (respectively concerned with the theoretical definition of art and its material production). The term derives from the Greek aı`sthesis, meaning ‘‘sensation,’’ ‘‘perception,’’ or ‘‘sensibility.’’ In its modern sense, it was first employed by Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten (1714–1762) in his Reflections on the Poetic Text (1735) and Aesthetica (1750), to designate an autonomous discipline whose field of inquiry is the realm of sensitivity, which, in turn, Baumgarten identified with beauty and art. In recent decades feminist criticism has played a key role in undermining the tacit reliance of aesthetics on the universality of beauty. More broadly, it has contributed to uncover the social and cultural circumstances that partake in the production of taste and to trace the ideological implications of aesthetics in its varied exemplifications. In antiquity and the Middle Ages,* the term ‘‘art’’ denoted the competence and skill acquired by the artisan by training (from its etymological meaning, from the Greek techne and its Latin equivalent ars), while beauty was viewed as an objective and measurable attribute and generally associated with order, symmetry, and light. In the Renaissance* and Baroque periods the modern image of the artist (and the modern connotations of art) supplanted that of the artisan: the Lives (1550) by Giorgio Vasari (1511–1574) is regarded as the first critical history of Italian art and presents a common theoretical basis for all figurative arts. It was in the eighteenth century, however, that art was completely set apart from other pursuits grounded in specific technical instruction and perceived as a purely aesthetic activity and the product of the autonomous inspiration of the genius. Giambattista Vico (1668–1744) and Immanuel Kant (1724–1804) are credited with the theoretical framework of aesthetics. Vico’s revolutionary philosophy of history, put forth in The New Science (1744), examined an age in which knowledge and wisdom were rooted in the mythical thinking and imaginative creations of the poet, and thus advanced the cause for the autonomy of the aesthetic field. In his Critique of Pure Reason (1781) and Critique of Judgement (1790) Kant defined two different kinds of judgment: one purely contemplative and disinterested, independent of any utilitarian or practical objective, and the other for-\n\nAESTHETICS\n\n9\n\nmulated according to preconceived notions that schematize sensible experience. He defined the first aesthetic judgment, the second teleological. Kant’s emphasis on the autonomous and self-referential nature of the aesthetic judgment established the premises of the Decadent movement’s self-conscious expression of ‘‘art for art’s sake.’’ Italian culture was dominated by the idealistic positions of Benedetto Croce’s (1866–1952) philosophy of spirit. The disinterested and impartial nature of the judgment of taste and the ensuing notion that art is autonomous, immutable, and universal, however, were challenged by Antonio Gramsci (1891–1937) and Galvano della Volpe (1895–1968), who scrutinized the socioeconomic and political context in which the discourse of the aesthetic was deployed and focused their analysis on the concrete conditions and ideological context that guarantee the production of art. Italian feminist theory has been keenly interested in inspecting the conceptual framework of aesthetics. As a major social, political, and cultural movement, Italian feminism succeeded in the 1970s in politicizing the language and signifying structures of art as well as its institutional context (schools, galleries, funding agencies, publishing houses, bookstores, etc.). The female body has occupied a central place in the Western cultural imagination. Its cultural significance has hardly ever been that of a flesh and blood entity, but that of a theoretical construct mantled in symbolic layers. Italian literature, from Dante*’s Beatrice and Petrarch*’s Laura onward, has traditionally bestowed woman a central, though always allegorical position—as the abstract embodiment of an intellectual process in male-authored texts—while women authors were ousted to the periphery of cultural production. Through the work of eminent philosophers and critics such as Adriana Cavarero,* Luisa Muraro,* Biancamaria Frabotta, Anna Nozzoli, Elisabetta Rasy, Gianna Morandini, and Marina Zancan, Italian feminist theory has embarked on a project, which is still far from settled, to define a feminine aesthetics. While feminist theory and aesthetics in the 1960s and 1970s were dominated by an ideology of marginality, in the 1980s different positions have arisen: some groups have become inclined to join the mainstream and use literature and art to inspire wider audiences, while others have advocated total separatism and committed to the practice of sexual difference in order to infuse all facets of life, not only art, with a feminist perspective.

Patrick Camiller. London: Sage, 1994. ISABELLA BERTOLETTI\n\nAleramo, Sibilla (1876–1960). Sibilla Aleramo (pseudonym of Rina Faccio) was a novelist, poet, and political essayist. She was something of a figurehead for Italian feminism in the early years of the twentieth century because of her seminal work Una donna (1906), which enjoyed both critical and popular acclaim. The novel tells, in thinly disguised form, Aleramo’s own story. It is the tale of a young girl who is raped, marries her attacker in accordance with (then) southern Italian custom, eventually becomes pregnant, and gives birth to a son who becomes her reason for living. Trapped in a violent and loveless marriage, the protagonist chooses, finally, to leave. This leavetaking, however, involves leaving her son behind too, since at that time Italian mothers had little or no legal rights to their children under the ‘‘patria potesta`.’’ Aleramo’s novel, thus, highlights social injustice, questions the legal system, places the position of women in Italy under a critical microscope, and interrogates the terms ‘‘mother’’ and ‘‘woman’’ in relation to each other. Aleramo questions the link between motherhood and sacrifice, and describes motherhood as it was conceived of in the nineteenth and early twentieth century, as a monstrous chain of servitude passed on from mother to daughter. Her anonymous (everywoman?) protagonist breaks this chain by choosing to leave the family, and hopes that her son will come to a different understanding of the mother-child relationship. The novel also questions what it means to be a woman writer. It is, indeed, writing that saves the narrator-protagonist’s sanity, and it is through the discovery of her own mother’s writings that the protagonist finds the courage to break out of her conventional role. Una donna is often considered to be the first Italian feminist novel. Aleramo went on to become involved in adult literacy courses; her commitment to improving the lot of women was matched by her concern for both the working classes and the uneducated. She travelled widely in Europe and wrote for various socialist and feminist periodicals. She did not return to writing fiction for some time after Una donna. In her fictional writings, which always retained an autobiographical element, she was repeatedly drawn to the seductions of the romance plot, as in Amo, dunque sono (1927). She also translated the love letters of George Sand and Alfred de Musset. She created something of a romantic persona for, and aura around, herself. Hence, although in many respects a feminist, Aleramo was at the same time in thrall to conventional images of femininity.

URSULA FANNING\n\nAlfieri, Vittorio (1749–1803). Often considered the forefather of Italian Romanticism,* Vittorio Alfieri is the author of tragedies that invoke grand themes of liberty and individualism, embodied in titanic clashes between two male figures—an evil, but exceptional, tyrant and his counterpart, the champion of liberty. Male-oriented critical studies tend toward analyses of these tragic works along the lines of the epic hero/tyrant conflict, so that Alfieri’s concern with psychological depth and realism and with the importance of forte sentire (strong feeling) are generally seen in function of traditional male thematic content. More intimate topics, such as Alfieri’s treatment of the family and his representation of women, are perceived as ‘‘minor’’ subjects, subordinated to grand, polis-centered themes. Some recent research, however, seeks to reevaluate Alfieri’s tragedies, concentrating instead on these ‘‘minor’’ topics and especially on their numerous female characters. Traditional analyses of Alfierian women limit interpretation to a series of marginal characters, noted mostly for their adherence to a bland ideal of femininity characterized by delicacy, fragility, and tragic victimization. In a broader interpretation of the female role, certain Alfierian female characters function as proponents of familial preservation, as tragic counterpoint to male violence and aggression within a patriarchal and politically driven society. These heroines act as diplomatic arbiters, working to create a peaceful resolution to a conflict or to prevent an impending disaster. In the early tragedy Filippo (1775), Isabella attempts to facilitate a father-son reconciliation that would create an environment of familial normalcy; in the tragedy Polinice (1775) Giocasta acts as fair-minded mediator between brothers; and in La congiura dei pazzi (1779) Bianca makes an outright offer to act as mediator between her feuding husband and brothers, while reminding them of their duties to their family. Elettra’s techniques as a family savior in Agamennone (1778) are quite varied, ranging from simple exhortations to her mother to artful diplomacy between parents, to dealing efficiently with obstacles to the hoped-for accord. The heroines often belie traditional eighteenth-century views of erratic female behavior as they represent the voice of reason amidst the irrationality of male power-based political action. In most cases, however, their efforts are eventually thwarted, brought to a standstill by the mostly male insistence on the primacy of other objectives. A variety of heroines deals directly, and successfully, with tyrannical threats against the family. In Merope (1782), Merope’s innate intelligence and strength\n\n12\n\nALFIERI, VITTORIO\n\nserve her well throughout the long, grueling period in which she awaits her son’s return from exile: her foresight in saving Cresfonte as a child and her sharp vigilance during Polifonte’s reign facilitate the overthrow of the tyrant. In the tragedy Antigone (1776), Antigone and Argia undertake the perilous mission to bury their loved one in a rebellious act of defiance against the tyrant’s violation of traditional family ritual; the courage of these two women thwarts the tyrant’s efforts at controlling them. The heroine in Virginia (1777), in an atypical female role as mouthpiece for Roman political ideals, displays unexpected maturity in her arguments in defense of herself as she bears witness to the truth and negates the tyrant’s falsified reasoning. Also unusual is the use of a woman, Agesistrata, as standard-bearer for civic ideals in Alfieri’s Agide (1786): she is the unflinching voice of frankness with the tyrant. More problematic is the protagonist of Ottavia (1780), whose irrational love for her monstrous husband Nerone is not diminished by her remarkable insight. Alfieri extends to women his vision of a society of free and self-affirming equal beings in a number of portrayals of tragic heroines as unexpectedly selfcontained, independent, and often powerful persons. In Maria Stuarda (1780) the protagonist struggles with her power as it places her in the unavoidable position of mentor to her resentful husband’s political ambitions, even as she is beset on all sides by men who wish to topple her reign. Unique in Alfieri’s works is the antiheroine found in Rosmunda (1780), a female tyrant who skillfully wields very real and quite ruthless power. The captured queen in Sofonisba (1787) is an impressive figure who maintains her autonomy and wrests control of her fate from the men who seek to dominate her: in captivity as in love she is neither dependent nor subordinate to the Other. The most famous of Alfieri’s heroines is the protagonist of Mirra (1786), the youthful embodiment of uncontrollable forte sentire, who nevertheless displays perfect self-knowledge and unshakable determination to liberate herself from her dark passion. She drives the tragic action, while family and lover respond in pawn-like roles to her will. Most controversial in Alfieri’s repertoire of heroines is the murderous Clitennestra in Agamennone (and in Oreste [1778], although here she appears in a greatly diminished capacity). In a rebellious move against the transgressions of patriarchal society, Clitennestra rejects wifely fidelity and seeks personal power, finally murdering her husband, the author of these patriarchal sins. In his quest for greater psychological depth in his characterizations, Alfieri undermines the traditional assumptions of gender roles. His tragic characters are quite modern—complex, strong figures possessing keen powers of observation as well as great courage in confronting their foes, women who seek to subvert the male order and assert their own value systems in its place.

In the sixteenth century, when the activity of the first publishing houses was at its highest, many anthologies of verse went through the presses. One volume, Rime diverse d’alcune nobilissime e virtuosissime donne, edited by Lodovico Domenichi in 1559 for Busdrago of Lucca, was entirely dedicated to women poets. The best-known among the anthologies containing poems by both men and women is the so-called Giolito collection. Originally conceived by Gabriel Giolito de’ Ferrari of Venice as a series of nine books, the collection, as we have it today, gathers volumes printed by various publishers in different cities. The first two volumes were edited by Lodovico Domenichi for Giolito in Venice in 1545 and 1547 with the titles of Rime diverse di molti eccellentiss. autori nuovamente raccolte and Rime di diversi nobili huomini et eccellentissimi poeti nella lingua toscana. The third and the sixth volumes were edited by Andrea Arrivabene and published with slightly different titles by the Venetian printers of Segno del Pozzo in 1550 and 1552. Ercole Bottrigari prepared the fourth volume in Bologna in 1551, while Lodovico Dolce edited for Giolito the fifth and seventh volumes: Rime di diversi illustri napolitani in 1552 and 1555, and Rime di diversi Signori napoletani in 1556. The eighth volume of the collection was prepared by Girolamo Ruscelli* with the title I fiori delle rime dei poeti illustri and was published by Marchio` Sessa of Venice in 1558, while the ninth volume was edited by Giovanni Offredi for Vincenzo Conti of Cremona in 1560. Each volume of the series was reissued several times, either by the same publisher or by a different one. At times a few poems were added; at other times, a reprint of a successful edition was given a new title, thus creating a great deal of confusion for anyone wishing to track down all editions. The success of the Giolito volumes prompted other publishers to publish similar collections, which may be grouped into two categories: the volumes that present the latest work by authors already known and those issued by regional printing firms proud to make known to the literate public the poets of their own region. To the latter category belong Rime di diversi eccellenti autori bresciani, edited by Girolamo Ruscelli (Venice: Plinio Pietrasanta, 1553) and Rime di diversi\n\n14\n\nANTHOLOGIES: POETRY, EARLY MODERN\n\ncelebri poeti dell’eta` nostra di Bergamo (Venice: Comin Ventura, 1587). Some anthologies are abridgements of volumes published earlier: two such examples are Rime di diversi eccelenti autori raccolte dai libri da noi altre volte impressi, edited by Lodovico Dolce (Venice: Giolito, 1553), and Rime scelte, edited by Terminio for the same publisher in 1563. Of these anthologies, which are scattered in the rare book sections of many research libraries in Europe and the United States, no comprehensive study has been attempted, nor has anyone made a complete bibliography of them. Even so, a few features stand out. From the front matter of these volumes, it is clear that their aim was to supply the reader with new verse of known authors and, at times, with the work of unknown ones. When poems already published are reprinted, explanations for it are given in the preface. They are not, therefore, anthologies in the modern sense of the word, for they do not intend to offer a representative view of contemporary poetry, and exhibit no specific approach to the material they present. The only exception in this sense is Girolamo Ruscelli’s volume Fiori. The importance of these publications for women’s studies cannot be overstated. Although women are a small percentage of the total number of poets anthologized, these volumes have made known the work and the names of women writers that might have otherwise disappeared from the record. Some women had their work published only in these anthologies. This is the case with both Isabella di Morra,* whose extant poems came to light in the 1552, 1555, and 1556 volumes of the Giolito series edited by Lodovico Dolce, and Veronica Ga`mbara, whose verse appeared in sixty-eight collections in the sixteenth century alone. Furthermore, these volumes bear witness to the extent and the manner in which women were allowed to participate in the cultural activity of their times. Although women poets had to be approved on a social and moral level before they were accepted as legitimate authors, nonetheless the anthologies created a new public perception of the woman writer and contributed to viewing her as much less of an extraordinary occurrence. The only anthology dedicated to women’s verse, Rime diverse d’alcune nobilissime e virtuosissime donne, was edited by Lodovico Domenichi and published by Busdrago of Lucca in 1559. This is a collection of 331 compositions, mostly sonnets of correspondence or sonnets on religious and moral themes. There are some love poems, mostly in the Petrarchan mode, by Cassandra Petrucci, Lucrezia Figliuzzi, Laudomia Forteguerri, Silvia Piccolomini, and Virginia Martini Salvi. The description given in the title of ‘‘very noble and very virtuous women,’’ implies, according to Marie Franc¸oise Pie´jus, a critical bias toward women. Although the act of publication wants to be an apologia of the bluestocking, Domenichi is careful to stress the acceptable character of these poets. All poems are preceded by a dedication and address either an author present in the collection or some highly placed personage. As a result of the social structure, women’s literary production is accepted as a regulated social game, a superior form of conversation or epistolary art for upper-class ladies.\n\nANTHOLOGIES: POETRY, MODERN\n\n15\n\nPie´jus thus views Domenichi as the representative of a class that subordinated literature to social power, and she judges sixteenth-century female craft to have been more accepted by literary circles the less originality it was capable of showing. In the seventeenth century the anthology becomes an obsolete literary product. The only publication of this kind is the reprint of Domenichi’s collection by Antonio Bulifon* of Naples in 1694. At this time, Petrarchism* is revived and women reenter the literary field under the regulated sponsorship of fashionable academies. The literary woman of impeccable moral character has become an accepted feature of Italian cultural life. In this context, as the title given by Antonio Bulifon to the collection indicates, women are bestowed for the first time the legitimate appellation of poetesse.

The beginning of the eighteenth century in Italy marks the entrance of women in the academies and their acceptance as poetesse. Indicative of the female presence in the official literary field is Rime degli Arcadi 14 vols. (1716–1722), a collection of verse in volumes produced by the members of the prestigious Accademia dell’Arcadia and edited by its theorist, Giovan Battista Crescimbeni. These volumes have been the authoritative texts for the female poetic voice of that period until the publication in 1959 of Bruno Mayer’s Lirici del Settecento, which reduced the number of women poets to two: Faustina Maratti Zappi and Petronilla Paolini Massimi. The anthologies that over the centuries have been dedicated to Italian women’s poetry are relatively more numerous. Some of them favor contemporary poets from the whole peninsula, such as Teleste Ciparissiano’s Poesie italiane di (34) rimatrici viventi (Venice, 1716). Others specialize in the poetic talents of women residing in a specific Italian region, as does G. G. Ranza’s Poesie e memorie di donne letterate che fiorirono negli stati di S. M. il Re di Sardegna (Vercelli, 1769). These volumes are aimed at a more mixed and wider public than the ones provided by the academies and the literary establishment. In both types of collections, women poets are regarded as objects of special curiosity, whose accomplishments are seen to be reaching beyond what is normally expected of women. A protofeminist spirit of pride in the talents of\n\n16\n\nANTHOLOGIES: POETRY, MODERN\n\nwomen animated Componimenti delle piu` illustri rimatrici d’ogni secolo, an extensive and now famous collection of women’s poetry assembled by Luisa Bergalli in Venice in 1726. It covers the whole span of Italian literature from a Nina Ciciliana’s verse of 1290 to the versifiers of Bergalli’s own times. The first wave of feminism in the second half of the nineteenth century created considerable interest in women’s verse. Special attention was given by the popular presses and by some scholars to the women poets of the Renaissance,* as Angelo de Gubernatis’s Antologia delle poetesse italiane del secolo decimosesto (Florence, 1883) and Olindo Guerrini’s Rime di tre gentilissime donne del secolo XVI (Milan, 1882) attest. Although scanty, the publication of collections of women’s verse has stretched into our century, and comprises Camilla Bisi’s Poetesse d’Italia (Milan, 1916) and Poetesse del Novecento (Milan, 1951). Also worthy of mention is the well-known Antologia delle scrittrici italiane dalle origini al 1800, edited by Jolanda De Blasi (Florence, 1930). The second wave of Italian feminist movement in the 1970s brought about a new interest in anthologies of women’s poetry. Most noteworthy are Donne in poesia, edited by Biancamaria Frabotta (Rome, 1976), and The Defiant Muse: Italian Feminist Poems from the Middle Ages to the Present (New York, 1986), edited by Beverly Allen, Muriel Kittel, and Keala Jane Jewell. These are the first collections to bring Italian women poets to the attention of the Italian and American public respectively. A strong feminist slant characterizes Nadia Fusini and Mariella Gramaglia’s La poesia femminista (Rome, 1978) and Laura di Nola’s Poesia femminista italiana (Rome, 1978). An anthology attesting to an increasing appreciation of women’s verse is Poesia d’amore: l’assenza, il desiderio (Rome, 1986), in which a series of women poets are introduced by famous male poets. The production of these specialized anthologies has remained outside the area of academic criticism and has not affected the established canon. No woman poet was included by Gianfranco Contini in his Letteratura dell’Italia unita (Florence, 1968), which appeared at the inception of the feminist movement— although he briefly addresses the issue of a ‘‘specific’’ feminine literature in the prefacing note to Gianna Manzini,* a novelist. Hardly any interest in women’s poetry is displayed in recent Italian textbooks. A case in point is the ponderous anthology Il materiale e l’immaginario, by Remo Ceserani and Lidia de Federicis (Turin, 1988), which dedicates a section to twentieth century feminism and to questions of women’s literary production but includes no contemporary Italian woman poet.

Nineteenth-century literary historians have portrayed Tullia d’Aragona as a courtesan who in her writing made use of Platonic theories in an attempt to camouflage her profession and a disreputable conduct. Some critics, with no documentary proofs to support their contentions, went as far as to deny her authorship of the work she published. In general, what weighed heavily against Renaissance women writers was the custom of sending their work to friends and sponsors for approval and suggestions. The same exchanges were also practiced among men, and often with decisive results, but never challenged the assumption of male authorship. Feminist scholars have recently reexamined Aragona’s life and writing in the context of sixteenth-century Italian society, its literary practices, and the privileges and coercions exercised by and on courtesans. In her poetry (Rime, 1547), Aragona is thus shown to have appropriated images and ideas of the male poetic code to her own advantage; by placing her verse in a framework sustained by the replies of famed men, she has turned a common feature of Renaissance* verse sequences into a strategy for her social and literary enhancement. In Dialogue on the Infinity of Love (1547), Aragona exposes the rhetoric of Platonism* and proposes a definition of love that is founded on both sensual and intellectual drives, thus radically deviating from dominating views, which consented exclusively to the spiritual elements in human relationships. With a strategic use of both Platonic and Aristotelian arguments and methods, she describes a lasting bond between woman and man based on human nature and on a parified sexual morality.

Pietro Aretino, one of the most complicated figures of the High Renaissance,* has given us a scathingly cynical description of women’s condition in patriarchal society. Author of poetry and prose both sacred and profane, notorious libertine, patron of artists and writers, and flamboyant scandalmonger, Aretino described himself as a ‘‘censor of the proud world,’’ while Ariosto* labeled him ‘‘the scourge of princes.’’ He was born in a year (1492) that saw Europe on the threshold of the New World and Italy at\n\n18\n\nARETINO, PIETRO\n\na watershed, with the death of Lorenzo de’ Medici and the consequent plunging of the rival Italian states into civil struggle and ultimate foreign domination. Aretino inhabited and helped to shape an era of turbulent transformations, marked by intrigue, immorality, and scandal in political, civic, and religious life. The very same era, however, also witnessed a blossoming of humanistic culture resulting in unparalleled achievements in philosophy, art, literature, and music by luminaries such as Machiavelli, Ariosto,* Castiglione,* Titian, Raphael, and Palestrina. From a background of humble origins and little schooling, buoyed by an ingenious instinct for self-promotion and unfettered by scruples, Aretino rose to a position of extraordinary wealth and power. Both were derived from a kind of literary blackmail. Rich benefactors gave him gifts and money to retain his loyalty; if inadequately rewarded, Aretino wrote scathing, intimate satires libeling his patrons for all the world to read. Aretino died of apoplexy in 1556. His epitaph reads, ‘‘Here lies the Tuscan poet Aretino. / He slandered all but God, Whom he left out / because, he pleaded, Well I never knew him.’’ Aretino’s body of writings consists of over three thousand letters, many pasquinades, sonnets, satires, epics, prose dialogues, religious tracts, five prose comedies, and one tragedy. Of particular interest to the feminist critic is the Ragionamenti (1600), a series of cynically humorous and pornographic dialogues between the elderly prostitute Nanna, her friend Antonia, her daughter Pippa, a nurse, and a midwife. In the first three dialogues, the mother and her friend consider the daughter’s options (nun, wife, and whore). In the end, Antonia counsels that the most honest choice would consist in Pippa’s becoming a whore, ‘‘for the nun is a traitor to her sacred vows, the wife an assassin of holy matrimony; but the whore[’s] shop sells that which she has to sell.’’ In the Ragionamenti, Aretino exposes the cruelties and impracticalities visited upon women in a commercialized Renaissance culture that often unwittingly betrayed its own notions of civic morality. Beneath its bawdy hyperbole, the text illustrates the very real problems created when women were forced into convent life or into arranged marriages by their families primarily for economic reasons. This often resulted in both the oppression of women and the corruption of the institutions into which they were coerced, thus lending a perverse grain of truth to Aretino’s satirical assertion that the only honest life for a woman was that of the prostitute. Some critics have gone so far as to suggest that Nanna’s defense of prostitution, notwithstanding its crude misogyny, functions as a moral critique of Renaissance culture, which forced women into positions of compromise and servitude. They also attempt to redeem the text’s portrayal of prostitution itself, pointing out that Nanna and Pippa explicitly discuss the dangers of a prostitute’s life, such as robbery, beatings, murder, and syphilis. Such readings see Aretino, for all his licentiouness, as a moral-minded satirist or even a defender of women. Feminist critics, however, are wary of too sweeping a rehabilitation of the ideology of Aretino’s text, as well as of too narrow an analysis of the complexities of the society it reflects. In light of the sheer perversity of Aretino’s\n\nARIOSTO, LUDOVICO\n\n19\n\nhumor, it is difficult to situate this text clearly within either a vein of moral satire or contemptuous parody. The most productive feminist reading might reject both of these polarities and take as a point of departure the possibility raised by Guido Ruggiero that Aretino was ‘‘a clever and outrageous writer who could play all sides in a little-understood war of values and cultures’’ (29). The value of Ragionamenti for the feminist critic lies more in the text’s opening a way for a radical interrogation of Renaissance notions of civic morality than in its own ambivalent response to the questions it raises about the conditions of women of that era.

The literary works of Ludovico Ariosto and the stance of their author within the sixteenth-century debate on women (the querelle des femmes*), have long been the subject of feminist inquiry. Although many of Ariosto’s shorter works have little to do with promoting feminism, and some, like his ‘‘Satire V’’ (1519), rely on typically misogynist tropes, Ariosto’s major work, the Orlando furioso (1532), is structured around the movements of its female characters and thus relies on women to shape the narrative and define the plot. The perspective of the poet on the place of women within his text and society at large, however, is difficult to assess. In the opening to canto 37 of the Orlando furioso, for example, the poet extols the virtues of women past and present while lamenting their underrepresentation in literature and history. Such injustices, he explains, are due to envious and mean-spirited men who, recognizing the natural superiority of women, choose either to neglect or to defame the heroines of their day. Interestingly, however, given the opportunity to rectify such practices and to create a space within his own text for worthy female contemporaries, the poet chooses instead to remain silent on this score, claiming the project to be too immense for his present work. Rather, he names only one virtuous woman, Vittoria Colonna (1492–1547), to serve as exemplar for her entire generation. In contrast to this singular entry, the opening twenty-four verses of canto 37, which comprise the poem’s digression into the subject of women and fame, swell with the virtues of Ariosto’s male contemporaries, of male poets and writers (seventeen in all, including the poet himself) who take it upon themselves to praise women in their pages. Given its male-oriented outcome, can such an appeal be properly termed ‘‘feminist’’? Such ambiguities concerning the treatment of women are not unusual in the Orlando furioso. Indeed, no particular brand of feminism or misogyny seems\n\n20\n\nARIOSTO, LUDOVICO\n\nto prevail in Ariosto’s text, as no specific character or event can be said to embody the author’s point of view. Rather, the text provides readers on both sides of the fence with ample material to support their claims. Feminist readers, for example, often look toward Ariosto’s maiden warriors as describing a vision of early modern ‘‘femininity’’ that does not exclude female independence, physical strength, and assertiveness. Responding to conservative critics who tend to categorize these warrior women as either unusual examples of females rising ‘‘above their sex,’’ or as monstrous exceptions to the ‘‘feminine’’ norm, recent readings attempt to negotiate disparate visions of maleness and of femaleness and look toward the maiden warrior to provide the material for this broader definition of woman. Skeptics, however, point to Bradamante’s ready retreat from the world of knights and arms to become wife to Ruggiero and mother to the Este dynasty (a lineage in which women are noted neither for their physical strength nor for their spirited independence, but rather for their mothering capabilities embodied in their ‘‘piety,’’ ‘‘prudence,’’ and ‘‘continence’’) as evidence that the poet favors a more ‘‘domesticated’’ vision of woman. Similarly, ambiguities involving the treatment and presentation of such story lines as Angelica’s love for Medoro and Olimpia’s tragic loyalty to Bireno have inspired a wide range of critical points of view. Recent readings employing a psychoanalytic model have been particularly fruitful in dispelling critical views that characterize these independently motivated female characters as heartless, inhuman, and deceitful for acting as desiring subjects in their own right, rather than merely mirroring the desires of the males with whom they interact. In the case of Angelica, for example, such studies ask why her story is so abruptly expelled from the narrative at the moment in which her desire for Medoro is physically realized and rendered textually legible. In the case of Olimpia, why is she accorded marital bliss only after she has been quite literally stripped bare of any and all means of self-definition and self-signification, thus becoming an empty text voyeuristically inscribed with the amorous desires of her soon-to-be husband and narratively defined by Orlando’s authoritative male voice? What do these events tell us about woman’s relationship to language and, in particular, about the narrative development and de´nouement of the Orlando furioso? Although unwilling or perhaps unable to provide us with definitive answers concerning the outcome of this sixteenth-century version of the querelle des femmes, Ariosto’s text poses provocative questions and, in so doing, affords the critical reader a fruitful glimpse into the terms of a debate that has shaped, and continues to shape, our ‘‘modern’’ notions of gender.

LAUREN LEE\n\nAristotelianism. The Aristotelian vision of woman, born out of the philosopher’s description of the processes of conception in the De generatione animalium, defines ‘‘woman’’ in terms of materiality, corporeality, and passivity. According to Aristotle (384–322 B.C.), in the act of conception the male ‘‘contributes the principle of movement and the female the material’’ [I: 21 (730a 26–27)]. While the man’s seed is said to provide the life force or anima to the embryo, the woman, as passive receptacle, is responsible only for providing the nutritive matter from which the embryo is shaped and through which it is sustained. In Aristotle’s vision of ‘‘semen as tool’’ [I: 22 (730b 20)] the male seed is seen as shaping and animating an otherwise inchoate mass of female materiality, supplying it with life, form, definition, and reason. The notion of gender inspired by Aristotelian logic constructs a hierarchical vision of male versus female as form versus substance, as active versus passive, as the embodiment of reason (ratio) and therefore of language (oratio) versus nonlinguistic corporeality. It follows as well that as the male seed seeks to contain and control female materiality by endowing it with life, form, and reason, so too does the man seek to contain and control the woman by subjecting her to his law and endowing her with definition through him (as ‘‘daughter,’’ as ‘‘wife,’’ or as ‘‘mother’’). Aristotelian dualities invoke the notion that woman, because she is described in terms of a perfected male principle, is innately lacking and wholly imperfect. It is only through sexual contact with the male that the female achieves any sort of ‘‘completion.’’ Hence the notion of female lack and female desire so prevalent both in medieval writings on women and in modern, psychoanalytic theories concerning female sexuality. Borrowing from Aristotle, woman is thus associated with the corporeal, with the fleshy, with the material side of humanity, whereas man is linked to the soul as the seat of reason. During the Middle Ages* and the early modern period, followers of Aristotle not only debate woman’s status as an ‘‘imperfect’’ version of man and thus ‘‘naturally’’ inferior to him, but some go as far as to question whether or not her status as a non-male precludes her from being human at all. Because of woman’s association with physical frailty, intellectual weakness, moral decrepitude, lust, dishonesty, and disease,* moralists, theologians, doctors, and lawyers alike from these periods deem her unsuited for any form of public office or public speech, or indeed any duties outside of those derived from her ‘‘private’’ and male-governed role as daughter, wife, or mother. Although Aristotelianism fell out of favor among medical scholars by the end\n\n22\n\nARTHURIAN ROMANCE\n\nof the sixteenth century, the vision of woman derived from Aristotle’s works continued to flourish and to be cited in an authoritarian manner, especially in moralistic literature and in treatises dealing with women. Such references to Aristotle as intellectual, medical, and moral authority are used throughout the early modern period and beyond to justify the intellectual subjection of women, as well as the banishment of women’s writings from the public sphere.

LAUREN LEE\n\nArthurian Romance. See Romance: Arthurian Autobiography. Autobiography can be described as the narrative of one’s own life, or of a meaningful fragment of it. Author, narrator, and main character are assumed to be the same. Traditionally considered by Italian literary historians a simple form of self-expression, hence a minor genre, autobiography has recently acquired the status of a complex form of self-representation and accrued importance in literary criticism. The theories of French and American critics such as Philippe Lejeune, Jean Starobinski, William Howarth, Burton Pike, and James Olney have been applied to the study of autobiography and of autobiographical fiction and poetry. Noteworthy in this respect are Graziano Guglielminetti’s Memoria e scrittura (1977) and Angelica Forti-Lewis’s Italia autobiografica (1986). Autobiographical writing by Italian men reached its maturity in the eighteenth century, when Vico, Alfieri,* and Goldoni* wrote their memoirs. In the Risorgimento period the genre became expression of implicit and explicit political discourse, and in the early twentieth century it was at the heart of the movement of ‘‘La Voce.’’ Autobiography by Italian women writers, however, had its inception only at the end of the last century. Particularly memorable in this early production is Sibilla Aleramo*’s Una donna (1906), which traces the author’s early feminism and describes its unfolding under paternal and marital oppression. Autobiography has proved ever since to be a powerful vehicle of personal and artistic expression for women, and a highly liberating activity as well. Unlike diaries and letters—genres more commonly practiced in the early years of women’s writing—autobiographies address an audience, take a public stand, and thereby break the silence that patriarchy has imposed on women. By exposing women’s life, frustrations, and desires—traditionally the object of male descrip-\n\nAVANTGARDE\n\n23\n\ntion—women’s autobiographies implicitly challenge patriarchal values and the common view of womanhood. Italian women writers, however, have often preferred to label their autobiographies as novels and, perhaps for fear of public exposure, have refused to align themselves with personal and feminine forms of literary expression. Their stories, therefore, often stand at the borderline with other genres, especially family histories, autobiographical fiction, and poetry. In recent decades, women’s autobiography has developed new themes and structures, thus giving origin to what has been called the mapping of female genealogies. Representative of this type are Fausta Cialente’s Le quattro ragazze Wieselberger and Clara Sereni*’s Il gioco dei Regni, in which the female protagonists claim their origin and their emotional inheritance from their female ancestry. Family relations in general, but especially parental relations, have always played a strong thematic role in Italian women’s autobiographies. This can be seen in Natalia Ginzburg’s Lessico familiare, in Gianna Manzini*’s Ritratto in piedi and Sulla soglia, and in Lalla Romano’s Le parole tra noi leggere. A recurrent trait of the female genre is the problematic relationship between mother and daughter. The maternal model is felt as both inspiring and debilitating, for these new women see in their mothers the perpetuators of patriarchy, as well as its heroic victims and survivors. By giving voice to their mothers’ silenced lives, these writers inscribe into history generations of women who have been obliterated by patriarchal society. Women’s autobiographies have been valued in Italy for their function as historical records, a pursuit very much in consonance with the aim of the new feminist historians, who want to reconstruct women’s history by means of an interdisciplinary method that includes all forms of narrative.

MAROTTI\n\nAvantgarde. The term ‘‘avantgarde’’ is used to describe the conscious effort to challenge all traditional forms and contents of literary production. In Italian\n\n24\n\nAVANTGARDE\n\nliterary history it is more frequently applied to futurism* and the poetry of the 1960s (the so-called Gruppo ’63 and its derivations), two twentieth-century movements separated by the Fascist period and World War II. Only recently a number of feminist scholars have begun to show interest in the women, poets and novelists, who worked within the sphere of futurism and took part in its debates. The first example of futurismo al femminile was authored by Valentine de Saint-Point, who wrote in Italian. Saint-Point’s ‘‘Manifesto della donna futurista’’ and ‘‘Manifesto della lussuria’’ so shocked the public—as many futurist manifestos did—as to earn Filippo Tommaso Marinetti’s great appreciation for the author and a place among I manifesti del Futurismo (Milan, 1919). From the beginning, women’s futurism was rife with ambiguity as well as rich in purpose. While initially taking a strong interest in the affirmation of feminine artistic individuality, futurism became progressively skeptical toward the political undertakings of any organized feminist group. As a result, futurist women remained aloof from the contemporary debate on women’s condition and from important social questions such as universal suffrage. The increased political orientation of futurism in the Fascist decades brought about a limited concern for feminist issues. Divorce* and welfare for minors were in Marinetti’s platform when he campaigned as a Fascist candidate in the 1919 elections. His political agenda, however, does not invalidate the deep-seated chauvinism of many of his statements, especially those found in ‘‘Come si seducono le donne’’ (How women are seduced), which came out in 1917. This text provoked the reaction of many women futurists who were animated by a strong emancipationist spirit, such as Rosa Rosa`. Mina della Pergola and Maria Ginanni also intervened in the debate, which raged on the pages of L’Italia futurista and Roma futurista, although they did not take a strict feminist position. The neo-avantgarde of the 1960s, heralded by Elio Pagliarani’s anthology I Novissimi (1961), showed an entirely different attitude toward women. Although Pagliarani did not include any woman poet in his collection, two women, Amelia Rosselli* and Carla Vasio, were among the authors of Gruppo ’63 when they organized their first meeting and exhibited their works in October 1963. Marina Mizzau, Alice Ceresa, Rossana Ombres, Patrizia Vicinelli, and Luciana Marcucci took part in the group’s subsequent debates on the form and content of poetry. Alice Ceresa’s La figlia prodiga (1969) and Amelia Rosselli’s Serie ospedaliera (1969) are two excellent examples of such participation, in prose and in verse respectively. Although the group had strong political concerns, the question of women writers was never considered. All debates, even when conducted by women, addressed literary problems from a male point of view. It is symptomatic of the group’s outlook that even the discussion on literary language, whose transgressive potential was the foundation of the group’s poetics, never involved issues of gender. As a consequence, feminist writers, who were struggling to define the new frontiers of women’s literature, took a guarded distance from the avantgarde, even when they shared some of its formal and ideological choices.\n\nAVANTGARDE\n\n25\n\nA female component remained strong in Gruppo ’63 until its dissolution at the end of the 1960s, as periodicals such as Quindici and Marcatre` attest. It is also felt in the composition of Gruppo ’70, which replaced the avantgarde of the 1960s and whose creative energy was channeled to visual poetry and conceptual art.

Anna Banti’s substantial body of writings—works of fiction, translations, art historical monographs, a critical biography of Matilde Serao,* and a large number of articles on literature, cinema, and contemporary culture—was published over a period of forty-four years (1937–1991) and made her a prominent figure in Italian intellectual life. Ten novels, one play, and six collections of short stories concern themselves predominantly with the relationships between women (mothers and daughters, female best friends, and professional rivals). Banti’s insistent thematization of women’s conditions focuses on the struggle of women for survival and dignity in fictional settings that range from ancient Rome to several centuries into the future. Her female protagonists labor to establish and maintain independent identities in spite of economic dependence on husbands and fathers, domestic entrapment in loveless and sometimes violent relationships, the tyranny of social expectations regarding female propriety and motherhood, and the devastation of wars. Several of Banti’s works display a particular interest in women who claim unconventional identities as artists and intellectuals. These protagonists strive to work freely, to be taken seriously, and to earn recognition for their talents rather than their appearances. Of particular interest to the feminist critic are Il coraggio delle donne (1940), Sette lune (1941), and Il bastardo (1953). Il coraggio delle donne, which many critics use as a point of departure for discussions of Banti’s feminism, consists of five stories set in turn-of-the-century Italy. These tales interrogate women’s economic, physical, and psychological servitude. They depict the suffering endured by women at the hands of abusive alcoholic husbands or cruel relatives\n\nBARBAPICCOLA, GIUSEPPA ELEONORA\n\n27\n\nwho resent their charges’ lack of dowry or other financial means. Sette lune tells the story of a student whose talent and diligence go unrewarded by her parents, who heap all their attention on her undeserving brother. Il bastardo (1953) portrays a woman who achieves success as an engineer, but only at the price of rejection and hostility. Banti’s most celebrated work, and the one that is most important to the feminist reader, is Artemisia (1947). This novel consists of the interwoven recollections of author, narrator, and protagonist as it narrates the life story of the sixteenth-century painter Artemisia Gentileschi. Banti blends together historical facts with speculation and invention, as she portrays Artemisia’s struggle to create an identity in a world that literally has no name for what she is: ‘‘But she is not a princess, she is not a pawn, she is not a peasant nor a tradeswoman, she is not a heroine, she is not a saint. Not even a courtesan, even if what people say were true.’’ Not surprisingly, Banti criticism revolves heavily around issues related to gender and feminism, with much attention given to the construction of Banti’s female characters as well as to ideological discussions of Banti’s feminism. Scholars interested in the position of women intellectuals have also analyzed Banti’s highly influential role as a critic and editor. Discourses of popular versus elite writing, especially as defined along gendered lines, also turn up in Banti criticism. Together with Sibilla Aleramo,* Banti clearly ranks as one of the groundbreaking feminist authors in Italian culture.

With her 1722 translation of Rene´ Descartes’s Principles of Philosophy, the young Neapolitan scholar Giuseppa Eleonora Barbapiccola expanded access to Cartesian philosophy for a general public, and she established her authority as a translator and a master of contemporary philosophy. Moreover, in the lengthy preface to her translation, Barbapiccola offered a puissant defense of women’s intellectual ability, their right to a meaningful education, and their claim to a voice in the traditionally male domain of intellectual discourse.\n\n28\n\nBARBAPICCOLA, GIUSEPPA ELEONORA\n\nIn her prefatory apology, Barbapiccola defends the scholarly integrity of her translation against dominant arguments for women’s intellectual inferiority, asserted by classical and contemporary male authorities such as Homer, Herodotus, and Claude Fleury. She provides an extensive account of women’s achievements throughout history in every area of human endeavor: art, literature, science, religion, warfare, and government. Barbapiccola does not, however, offer as a defense a conventional catalog of illustrious women from the amazons to her contemporary femmes savantes. She instead emphasizes specifically those women in history who set cultural trends, influenced intellectual thought, and served as the instructors and the inspiration for major male figures of the Western canon. To name only a few, she cites Daphne, whose verses, she maintains, served as the font for Homer’s poetic inspiration; Diotima, whom Socrates called master; Queen Christina of Sweden, the founder of the Arcadia Academy; and a close French contemporary and principal authority for her translation of Descartes, Anne Lefe`vre, Madame Dacier, who translated and interpreted Homer for a general French public. Barbapiccola not only documents women’s intellectual attainment, but also inscribes women in the cultural canon, often supplanting the authority of the fathers of Western civilization with that of their mothers. Barbapiccola thus defends this ‘‘work by a woman,’’ first by establishing a clear precedent for women’s intervention and authority in intellectual discourse, and second by displaying her own erudition. As other ‘‘Cartesian women’’ of her age, Barbapiccola seeks to disseminate the philosophical teachings of Descartes in large part because of the intellectual authority he accorded women. She cites Descartes’s extended philosophical exchange with Queen Elizabeth of Bohemia, to whom he dedicated the Principles of Philosophy, and his assertion that women naturally surpass men at philosophical thought not only as authorization for her translation, but also to defend a more rigorous education for women. Indeed, Barbapiccola explicitly identifies women as the special beneficiaries of her translation. She seeks to offset the deficiencies of women’s traditional education in ‘‘the Catechism, sewing, diverse little works, singing, dance, fashionable dress, courteous behavior, and polite speech,’’ by imparting to them the clear and coherent method of intellectual inquiry of Cartesian philosophy. Although exceedingly scant biographical information exists about Barbapiccola, it is clear, from her poetic correspondence with Giambattista Vico’s eldest daughter Luisa and from writings by contemporaries such as Gherardo de Angelis and Vico himself, that Barbapiccola was both an intimate of the Vico family and a noted member of Neapolitan intellectual circles.

REBECCA MESSBARGER\n\nBellonci, Maria (1902–1985). A central figure in the Italian literary world from the 1930s up to her death, Maria Bellonci is known for her scrupulous work as a Renaissance* historian and for her historical novels. She is also famous for having established in 1947, and having managed thereafter, the prestigious Premio Strega, together with her husband Goffredo Bellonci. Her involvement with the literary prize is documented in Come un racconto gli anni del premio Strega (1971), while Pubblici segreti, her diaries from 1958 to 1964, are a record of a life devoted to the world of letters. As an historian, Maria Bellonci is particularly noteworthy for the rigorous accuracy of her research as well as for a very personal style, which breeds life into documents and records while providing psychological motivations for historical figures. The main objects of her research were the great families who ruled during the Italian Renaissance; the Borgias, the Estes, the Gonzagas and the Sforzas. Of particular relevance is the attention she gave to the female protagonists of Renaissance history, Lucrezia Borgia and Isabella d’Este, and in particular to their involvement with power. For Lucrezia Borgia Bellonci was awarded the Viareggio prize in 1939. Bellonci’s fiction—Delitto di stato, Soccorso a Dorotea, Tu vipera gentile, Marco Polo, Segni sul muro, and Rinascimento privato—is preceded by and based on her historical research. Most of these stories have a Renaissance setting, in which the dynamics of power are highlighted. Most successful in this respect is the novel Rinascimento privato, where a gender-conscious discourse is developed through the penetrating insights of the protagonist, Isabella d’Este, who is shown to be aware both of the limitations linked to her ge"
