        "text": "During inclement weather when there are erratic flight delays, flights may land but sit on the tarmac for some extended period of time and do not make to the gate until some time (due to unavailability of the gate, as all the flight start landing at the same time after the weather clears), we switch to a Dispatch only when the flight is at the gate model, or when you call us that you are ready.\n\nEach Terminal at EWR has its own pick area, which is subject to change during ongoing construction. Pickup Point will change depending upon whether it is an outside pickup or inside pickup (inside the terminal). Always stay alert and please free to call your driver or the car company when in doubt. A text message or email may provide you a link for the driver location.\n\nPick up points for each terminal are listed below under “Meet Your Driver” heading.\n\nHaving started out as a site for 2 regional airstrips for US Airmail Service in the 1920’s, Newark Liberty International Airport, originally Newark Metropolitan Airport evolved into the first great commercial airport in the United States. During 2022, the airport served 43.4 million passengers, which made it then the 13th-busiest airport in the nation and the 23rd-busiest airport in the world. Newark serves 50 carriers and is the largest hub for United Airlines.\n\nNewark along with John F. Kennedy International Airport and LaGuardia Airport all serve the NYC metropolitan area. Although Newark is technically in New Jersey, it’s easier to access from the westside of Manhattan than JFK and handles the greater portion of New Jersey travelers.\n\nImpact on travelers: Pricing regulations have recently changed. Since 1945 airlines followed (International Air Transport Association (IATA) guidelines that as all 3 airports (EWR, JFK and LGA) serviced the NY Metro Area they were grouped together under the city code NYC. Under new rules adapted in 2022 Newark is listed as a separate city code, EWR. Previously passengers had the option of freely changing flights, i.e. from arriving in JFK to arriving in LGA or EWR — without a penalty.\n\nAt EWR Newark Liberty Airport, the best way of getting airport transfer or transportation is to pre-book your ride with a legitimate Private Hire, limo or Black Car service. The other good options are to get a taxi at the airport-controlled taxi line or get an Uber or Lyft. The Information Counter just outside the Customs Hall can guide you to the Taxi Line or your Private Hire, Black Car or Uber-Lyft pick up area. Know your fare in advance. At EWR, Taxi Fare for Manhattan is fixed. If you are going someplace other than Manhattan, ask the Taxi Dispatcher for an estimated fare to your destination. Cost of your pre-arrange Private Hire, Black Car or limo ride should also be fixed and include all charges including tolls, taxes and credit card fees, etc. Only pay by credit card, even in a taxi. Before entering into a taxi, make certain that the driver will accept a credit card. Get a receipt. Please note down the Taxi License Number in case you forget something in the taxi. To avoid “Lost & Found” problems, using a legitimate Private Hire or Black Car Company that tracks your ride history and offers the surest way to get your property returned.\n\ncapacities. In time, new technologies and security requirements necessitated changes. We have seen it as a never ending construction project with a better and better design. While Foreign Exchange facilities are in less demand, duty free shops have created an atmosphere of a shopping mall. When airlines stopped serving food on the planes, restaurants and food shops took over. It is always in a flux. The 3 operational terminals are listed below.\n\nThe new Terminal A, replacing the original terminal (circa 1973), was built with redesigned roadways, 8 new bridges, a new six-level 2,700-car parking garage and rental center, and a walkway that connects the AirTrain station, parking garage, and terminal building. There are more traffic lanes at pickup and drop-off points, closer check-in counters and security areas to the entrance The terminal has four levels: the departures level, the mezzanine level for offices, the arrivals level, and the ground floor, where baggage claim is located.\n\nServices & Amenities:\n\nThis year four lounges will be available before you depart: American Airlines Admirals Club, Delta Air Lines Sky Club, American Express Centurion Lounge a 350-seat United Club.\n\nRegional NJ eateries include Jersey Mikes, Smokehouse BBQ, Office Tavern & Grill, Kitchen Step Neighborhood Bistro and Playa Bowls.\n\nStores & Kiosks:\n\nArtist PopShop, Dufry Tax and Duty Free, Bluwire and Bang Cookies.\n\nFor Curbside service please confirm with your carrier. Most carriers direct arriving passengers to Level 1 Pickup Area 2-3 except for Alaska Airlines and Frenchbee outside Door # 8; Allegiant Level B; Aer Lingus and Air India Lower Level Area 4; Jet Blue Level 2 Doors 3-4-5; Air France, El Al Emirates and LOT Lower Level B; Porter, Sun Country and Spirit Level 1 Area 2-3. For Domestic flights inside Meet & Greet service your driver will meet you at the Baggage Area; For International flights your driver will meet you outside the Customs Door.\n\nServices & Amenities:\n\nUnited has 3 First Class passenger lounges: A United Club (near Gate C74); a second United Club near Gate C93; and the United Polaris Club (between Gates 102 and 120).\n\nIn 2019, Terminal C was named ‘Best for Foodies’ in the nation by Fodor’s Travel Awards. There are dozens of options ranging from grab-and-go eateries to sit-down restaurants with upscale service.\n\nAmong the choices: Abruzzo (Italian steakhouse), Boars Head (deli), Caps Beer Garden (Asian), Casciano (Italian), Creepier Juliet (sweet & savory), Daily (seasonal selections), Flora Café (middle eastern, Greek), Flip Flop (pancakes), Forno Marico (Italian), Garden State (New Jersey style diner), Happy Clam (Italian seafood), Kaedama (Japanese, Korean), Little Purse (dumplings), Melange (chocolates, savory), Notorious Taco (Mexican), Novella (pasta, pizza)), Park (American grill), Philly Cheesesteaks, Proof Whiskey (bar food), Riviera (French), Saison (French), Surf Bar (sushi), Tacquila (ameri-mex), Tagliare (pizza), Tsukiji (Japanese seafood), Vesper (American tavern), Wabi Sabi (Japanese dumplings), Wanderlust (burgers) and more.\n\nStores and Kiosks:\n\nDufry Tax and Duty, Cico Express, Poppy’s Bagels, Johnston & Murphy, Huson Booksellers, TUMI, In Motion Entertainment, L’OCCTANE EN PRIVENCE, Bluwire, Departure Spa and Swarovski.\n\nJust like taxis, Black Car Companies, vehicles and drivers are all licensed and regulated by the City of New York Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC). Vehicles are inspected for safety by the TLC every four months. Drivers are licensed after mandatory classes, background checks, driving record checks and drug testing. Insurance filings of the vehicles and driving records of the drivers are monitored on a continuous basis, with direct computer links to the New York State Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) and other agencies.\n\nBlack Car and Limo Companies are only allowed to pick up by prearranged reservations or by calling a company you know after arriving at the airport. If your car company is a small company, you should make a reservation because it may not have a vehicle readily available for on demand service.\n\nSelect trains along the Northeast Corridor and North Jersey Coast Line routes make a stop at Newark Liberty International Airport Station. To identify these trains, watch for either an airplane symbol or the abbreviation ‘EWR’ on the departure boards. It’s essential to note that not all trains on these routes include the airport stop, so it’s advisable to verify before boarding.\n\nFor your journey, you can purchase your ticket from either a vending machine or a ticket counter. Make sure to keep your ticket with you because you’ll need it again when boarding the AirTrain.\n\nUpon reaching Newark International Airport Station, simply follow the signs directing you to the AirTrain.\n\nThe airport is served directly by U.S. Route 1/9, which provides connections to Route 81 and Interstate 78, both of which interchange with the New Jersey Turnpike at Interstate 95’s exits 13A and 14, respectively. Northbound, Route 1/9 becomes the Pulaski Skyway continues east to the Holland Tunnel, linking Jersey City with Lower Manhattan."
