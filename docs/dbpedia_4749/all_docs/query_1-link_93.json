        "text": "(United States, February 29, 2024): The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey is bolstering the food and dining options at Newark Liberty International Airport’s award-winning Terminal A with the addition of the Guy Fieri’s Flavortown Kitchen + Bar, operated by SSP America, a division of SSP Group. The hearty offerings from one of the most recognizable celebrities and celebrity chefs in the world adds to the terminal’s diverse dining options and one-of-a-kind sense of place.\n\n“We’ve welcomed countless dignitaries through our world-class airports, but nothing compares to the arrival of the Mayor of Flavortown himself, Guy Fieri,” said Port Authority Chairman Kevin O’Toole. “We’re proud to be rollin’ out with one of the culinary world’s most respected and well-liked figures as we add to the unique offerings and experiences on tap at Terminal A.”\n\n“The addition of the Flavortown Kitchen + Bar to Terminal A underscores our effort to bring passengers exciting amenities and dining options to complement this stunning, award-winning new terminal,” said Port Authority Executive Director Rick Cotton. “Guy’s bold and hearty offerings pair perfectly with Terminal A, as we dish up a streamlined, state-of-the-art traveling experience with a side of distinctive architecture, diverse dining, and magnificent local art.”\n\n“I’m very proud to have partnered with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and SSP America to bring Flavortown Kitchen + Bar to the bar-raising new Terminal A at Newark Liberty Airport,” said Guy Fieri. “This makes EWR our official hub and we are ready and welcoming all passengers on their trip to Flavortown!”\n\n“Guy Fieri’s Flavortown Kitchen and Bar is a perfect fit in the new Terminal A at Newark Liberty International Airport and complements the offerings in the terminal,” said Elisabeth Sailer, chief commercial officer of Munich Airport NJ LLC (MANJ), which operates Newark Liberty’s Terminal A. “Flavortown is a bold, new restaurant that offers passengers an exciting, delicious, and entertaining dining experience developed by a culinary icon. As we continue to focus on providing passengers with a world-class travel experience, we are pleased to have partners like SSP America and Flavortown who are as committed as we are to surprise and delight passengers traveling through Terminal A.”\n\n“Terminal A represents a new era for Newark Liberty and a harbinger of America’s future aviation industry considering the significant investment taking place,” said Paul Loupakos, SSP America senior vice president of development and airport retention. “We’re proud to be part of the Newark Liberty community, and we’re also now official citizens of Flavortown, and as Chef Guy says, ‘Plan to take passengers on a road-rockin’ trip down to Flavortown.’”\n\nFieri is one of the most recognizable celebrities and celebrity chefs in the world since his win on the second season of “Food Network Star” in 2006. With a long list of restaurants, cookbooks, and television shows to his credit, he has simultaneously become a philanthropic leader, raising tens of millions of dollars for first responders and hospitality workers, as well as supporting literacy and culinary education for children and adults alike through the Guy Fieri Foundation.\n\nConceptually, Guy Fieri’s Flavortown Kitchen + Bar is derived from a well-known Fieri reference to a place that doesn’t exist – Flavortown – which came about on Food Network’s hugely popular “Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives” television show hosted by Fieri. The full-service restaurant and bar serves an all-day menu consistent with the Fieri brand, which includes items such as Trash Can Nachos, Ain’t No Thing Butta Chicken Wing and Motley Que Pulled Pork Sandwich.\n\nThe restaurant’s design is inspired by Fieri’s exuberant personality combined with a local industrial vibe. The space unfolds around a large bar, surrounded by seating areas and bordered by elements reminiscent of shipping containers covered with Guy Fieri’s signature graphics. The triple-height space above the restaurant is bordered by an oversized Flavortown illuminated sign visible throughout the terminal.\n\nGuy Fieri’s Flavortown Kitchen + Bar is one of Terminal A’s 54 unique and diverse dining options that include six locally owned and operated concessionaires from the nearby communities of Newark, Elizabeth, and Jersey City.\n\nThe new terminal recently celebrated its one-year anniversary, serving 15 million passengers in its first year and collecting a multitude of awards including the prestigious Prix Versailles Special Prize from the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).\n\nAbout the Newark Liberty International Airport redevelopment\n\nThe Port Authority has embarked on a complete redevelopment of Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) that began with the opening of Terminal A – the centerpiece of an airport-wide renaissance designed to establish the airport as a world-class gateway for the New Jersey and New York region.\n\nThe Port Authority is actively moving forward on a full replacement of Newark Liberty’s outdated AirTrain system with a modern, reliable 2.5-mile automated people mover train system. The first contract in a multi-phase procurement process was awarded in December to Doppelmayr, a market leader in cable-propelled transport systems. The new system is expected to open in 2029.\n\nAdditionally, the Port Authority Board of Commissioners has authorized $12 million for the planning and preliminary design of the EWR Station Access Project, which is expected to increase public transit access to Newark Liberty International Airport and New York City for underserved communities in Newark and Elizabeth, including easy access for residents of these communities to New York Penn Station via Amtrak and NJ TRANSIT’s direct Northeast Corridor service.\n\nThe next phase of the Port Authority’s ongoing transformation of Newark Liberty International Airport will be developed through the work of a world-class airport master planner selected by the agency. The EWR Vision Plan — which will serve as a framework for future development through 2065 – will incorporate plans for long-term economic growth, sustainability projects, and multimodal access to the airport for both work and travel.
