        "text": "Key Takeaways\n\nNewark Liberty International Airport (EWR) has 3 terminals: A, B, and C. Each serves a different airline and destination, with Terminal C being used as a United Airlines hub.\n\nThe airport offers a range of amenities, including dining, shopping, and lounges, catering to the needs of domestic and international travelers.\n\nGround transportation options include NJ Transit trains, taxis, ride-shares, and rental cars, providing convenient access to and from the airport and the New York City area.\n\nNewark Liberty International Airport (EWR) served 49.1 million passengers in 2023. EWR is a major hub for United Airlines, which operates from each of the airportâs 3 terminals and has sole occupation of Terminal C.\n\nAlthough none of the airportâs 3 terminals are physically connected to each other, itâs easy to travel between them and the parking garages by hopping on the regular AirTrain service.\n\nQuick Information\n\nAirport: Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR)\n\nTerminals: 3 total: Terminals A, B, and C\n\nAirport Address: 3 Brewster Rd., Newark, NJ 07114\n\nDistance From Midtown Manhattan: 15 miles (24 km)\n\nWebsite: newarkairport.com\n\nPhone Number: 973-961-6000\n\nFlight Information: Departures and arrival information can be viewed online\n\nEWR Terminal Map\n\nAirlines Operating from EWR\n\nTerminal A\n\nTerminal B\n\nTerminal C\n\nUnited Airlines\n\nEWR Airport Terminals\n\nNewark Airport is an oval shape, with 2 of the terminals, short-term parking lots, and road system on the inside and the departure concourses on the outside.\n\nTerminals A and B are located next to each other, but are not directly connected via any walkways or bridges, and Terminal C is located a little further away. Passengers must ride the AirTrain or shuttle bus to connect between all 3 terminals.\n\nTerminal A\n\nTerminal A is the newest of all the terminals, having opened at the beginning of 2023. The bright and spacious terminal is a welcomed contrast to the old building and is able to accommodate an additional 4 million passengers annually. Flights within the U.S. and Canada operate from Terminal A.\n\nTerminal A has 33 gates split across 3 concourses. Gates A1 to A6 are located in the south concourses, gates A8 to A27 are located in the east concourse, and gates A30 to A34 are located in the north concourse.\n\nAll concourses are served by 1 central security checkpoint, so passengers can walk freely between the 3 concourses without having to re-clear security. The majority of shops and restaurants can be found in the central atrium after you clear security, with only a small selection of concessions located near the gates.\n\nTerminal A has a United Club and will eventually have 3 additional lounges â an American Admirals Club, a Delta Sky Club, and a signature American Express Centurion Lounge â due to open later in 2023.\n\nStar Alliance passengers can connect to the other terminals by riding the courtesy shuttle bus departing from near gate A28. Other passengers will be required to exit the terminal, ride the AirTrain, and re-clear security at the next terminal.\n\nTerminal B\n\nTerminal B is the main international terminal at EWR and consists of 3 concourses. Concourse B1 has 10 gates numbered B40, B41A and B, B42, B44, B45A and B, B46, B46B, and B47; Concourse B2 has 8 gates numbered B51 to B58; Concourse B3 has 9 gates numbered B60 to B68.\n\nThere are not many shops and restaurants in the B2 concourse, so passengers will need to make use of the facilities within the other 2 concourses. As the 3 security checkpoints each lead into a specific concourse, passengers are not able to move freely between the 3 concourses without having to re-clear security again.\n\nTerminal B has a British Airways Lounge, Delta Sky Club, Lufthansa Business Lounge (with First Class Area), SAS Lounge, and a USO Lounge.\n\nTerminal C\n\nTerminal C is operated solely by United Airlines for domestic and international flights. Like the other terminals, Terminal C is split across 3 concourses â C1, C2, and C3.\n\nConcourse C1 has 21 gates numbered C70 to C75, C80 to C88, and C90 to C99; Concourse C2 has 12 gates numbered C101 to C105 and C107 to C113; Concourse C3 has 19 gates numbered C120 to C123, C125-C128, C130V, W, X, Y, Z, and C132 to C139.\n\nThe 3 security checkpoints lead into a central concourse area, so there is no need to re-clear security to enjoy the terminalâs good selection of shops and restaurants.\n\nTerminal C has a United Polaris Lounge and 2 United Club Lounges. To connect to Terminals A or B, passengers can ride the shuttle bus that departs from near gate C71.\n\nInter-terminal Transport\n\nWalking\n\nEWRâs 3 terminals are not directly connected, so passengers are not able to walk between connections and must ride the Air Train or terminal shuttle bus.\n\nThe above image shows the estimated walking times from when you have cleared the security checkpoint to the gate.\n\nPassengers (excluding international arrivals) can freely walk between the 3 concourses in Terminals A and C as the security checkpoints lead into a central area. Passengers walking between concourses in Terminal B have to re-clear security as there is a checkpoint at the entrance of all 3 concourses.\n\nAirside Transport (Inside the Secure Area)\n\nUnited Airlines operates a courtesy shuttle bus to transport Star Alliance flight passengers between terminals.\n\nThese buses depart from near gates A28, B68, and C71 and run inside of the secure area, so passengers are not required to re-clear security on arrival at the next terminal. This excludes passengers arriving on international flights as they are required to pass through customs and immigration on arrival, which requires re-clearing security again.\n\nBuses between Terminals A and C run from 4 a.m. to 12 a.m. and buses from Terminal B to Terminals A and C run from 1 p.m. to 11 p.m.\n\nLandside Transport (Outside of the Secure Area)\n\nThe AirTrain is an easy mode of transport to get around Newark Airport, however, it operates outside of the secure area, so itâs necessary to re-clear security at the next terminal.\n\nWithin airport property, the train is free to ride, and this includes journeys between any of the terminals, parking lots, and rental car center. For journeys between the airport and Newark Liberty Airport Station, there is a fee of $8 (free for children under 11 years old).
