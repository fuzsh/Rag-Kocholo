        "text": "While Jackson Hole Airport is small and easy to navigate, it gets crowded at peak times. We recommend that you arrive at the airport 2 hours prior to your flight to ensure stress-free travel and enjoy the newly renovated fireplaces, oversized chairs, free Wi-Fi, local dining, and floor-to-ceiling windows that just might take your breath away. Ask your lodging accommodations if they provide an airport shuttle. If not, pre-schedule a taxi to take you from your hotel to the airport upon your departure.\n\nDollar, Hertz, and Thrifty are all located 9 miles from the airport in the town of Jackson, and travel from the airport is provided by a complimentary shuttle. Find the shuttle outside the north end of the center island below a brown sign reading “Rental Car Shuttles.”\n\nExperience the best of both worlds by flying into one of our neighboring airports and take a miniature road trip to Jackson. Both Idaho Falls, Idaho, and Salt Lake City, Utah, are popular flight destinations for travel to Jackson Hole and just a scenic drive away.\n\nSalt Lake City International Airport (SLC) is a 4-hour, 30-minute drive from Jackson\n\nIdaho Falls Regional Airport (IDA) is a 1-hour, 45-minute drive from Jackson\n\nREGIONAL FLIGHTS"
