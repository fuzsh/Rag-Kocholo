        "text": "Whether you have a layover, overnight sleepover or you are just quickly passing through, our Newark Airport Guide is a great place to start planning your visit. Here, you’ll find information on services and facilities available inside the airport – including details about airport lounges, WiFi, mobile charging points, lockers, 24-hour food options, nearby hotels, and everything in between.\n\nAirport Lounges\n\nAirport Hotels\n\nAirport WiFi\n\nShowers\n\nRest Zones\n\nLuggage Storage\n\nMobile Charging\n\nThe seats aren’t that comfortable, but a staff member came around handing out blankets and pillows to anyone who wanted them. -a traveller\n\nEWR Airport Overview\n\nTo help you plan your layover or overnight sleepover, here is a quick run-down about what to expect during your time at Newark Liberty Airport.\n\nWhat to Expect\n\nNewark Airport (code: EWR) is spread over three large terminals. The free AirTrain Newark connects all terminals, running every 3 minutes during peak times. Once inside your terminal, anticipate lots of walking to reach your gate and other facilities.\n\nTravellers often report on long, slow security lines, so arrive earlier than normal for peace of mind. On the plus side, you’ll find plenty of eating, drinking, and shopping establishments to pass the time and a couple eateries stay open 24-hours. WiFi is free and unlimited. Several airport lounges offer fee-based entry to economy class travellers who want to upgrade their layover. See Airport Lounges in the guide below for locations and rates.\n\nSleeping in Newark Airport\n\nAs a major transit hub, long layovers at Newark airport are the norm. Overall, the terminals are cold and seating is very limited. Plan to sleep on the floor or prop yourself up on opposite seats. If you’re looking to stay the night, all overnight campers will be relocated to the pre-Secure landside areas until early AM. For daytime resting, travellers like Terminal B’s airside for quieter corners and a few armrest-free benches. We’ve heard from some travellers that the airport has cots, blankets, and pillows for use in cases of severe weather delays. Explore our guide to sleeping in Newark Airport or read some traveller airport reviews for more tips. For uninterrupted sleep, several hotels are located within a 3-minute drive, including a hotel on airport grounds. See Airport Hotels in the guide below.\n\nTo help us keep this guide up-to-date, you can add or update information or write a review to submit airport tips and photos. You can also visit the airport’s web site for current information. For more airport information continue scrolling down to explore more in our Newark Airport Guide.\n\nIn this guide we may refer to locations as “landside” and “airside”. Landside is the public area of the terminal located in the non-secure zone, before security. Airside is the secure area of the terminal that you must reach by going through security. For more information on Europe’s Schengen Area, click here.\n\nAirport Hours\n\nThe airport is open 24 hours.\n\nKeep in mind that TSA, airline check-in and baggage drop hours vary according to the flight schedule. Check these hours with your airline. If you are in the public area of the terminal (landside) you will not be able to get through to the secure area of the terminal (airside) until the morning.\n\nCots\n\nIf you have been stranded at Newark airport due to a storm, there is a limited supply of cots. Availability may have been affected by Covid. If you are stranded during a weather delay, contact an airport employee to find out when the cots are located.\n\nDrinking Water\n\nA reader tells us there are drinking water fountains, including water bottle refill stations, both landside/airside near every bathroom. (May 2024)\n\nFood & Drinks\n\nThere are many dining options landside and airside. Subway (located in Terminal B, landside) is open 24 hours. Dunkin Donuts (located in Terminal C) is not open 24 hours, but almost. A reader tells us it opens at 2:00AM, so it might close for a few hours during the night.\n\nLuggage Storage & Lockers\n\nA reader tells us that there was luggage storage in Terminal C, baggage claim, near baggage belt #1. Rate $15.\n\nMobile Charging\n\nPower outlets for mobile charging are located both Landside and Airside in all Terminals.\n\nRest & Relaxation Zones\n\nThere is a quiet room available to relax. Location: Terminal B, Landside, near British Airways ticket counter. Also in Terminal B, you will find Relax & Recharge area. Location: Landside, Level 3, Door 1.\n\nTake precaution even when sleeping in the rest zones. In December 2019, a traveller at another airport reported that money and credit cards had been stolen from their bag even though the bag was right beside them. Protect and lock your bags as you would sleeping elsewhere in public."
