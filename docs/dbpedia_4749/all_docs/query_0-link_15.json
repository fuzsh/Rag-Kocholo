        "text": "Spirit Airlines is planning to station about 200 pilots at Newark Liberty International Airport later this year, while shutting down its Atlantic City crew hub.\n\nThe crews will move beginning in September and additional personnel are expected to follow once the hub is operational, the airline announced Friday.\n\nIn April, the company announced it would rely on out-of-area teams to staff Atlantic City flights, and close its crew hub at Atlantic City International Airport.\n\nJohn Bendoraitis, Spirit’s executive vice president and chief operating officer, said the company chose Newark because of growing demand in the nation’s largest metropolitan area.\n\n“Spirit has a long history of serving New Jersey travelers, and this investment reflects our commitment to our guests and team members in the Garden State,” Bendoraitis said in a statement.\n\nA company spokesperson did not immediately return a request by NJ Advance Media for comment. It was unclear if workers at the Atlantic City base would be relocated to Newark once the new hub opens.\n\nCrew bases, Spirit said, are airport stations where flight crews begin and end their trips. With its recent $2.7 billion investment to upgrade its Terminal A, and its status as one of the nation’s busiest airfields, Newark is an attractive base for staff, company officials said.\n\nSpirit first began servicing Newark in October 2016. Since then, the company said it has become the airport’s second-largest carrier, with up to 32 peak day departures and service to 22 destinations, seven of which were added in the past year.\n\nSpirit is based in Florida and has multiple crew hubs there, as well as in Atlanta, Chicago and Dallas.\n\nSpirit is the only carrier providing frequent commercial flights to and from Atlantic City Airport. Sun Country Airlines makes occasional flights, and an American Airlines shuttle bus operates from the airport, which is located in Egg Harbor Township.\n\nA company spokesperson told NJ Advance Media in April that flight numbers have fallen in recent years to an average of eight to 10 daily departures, depending on the season.\n\nThe Atlantic City base is expected to close in September, affecting 157 pilots and flight attendants. Flights, however, will continue despite the closure.\n\nAirline officials in April cited the move as part of a larger restructuring decision with aircraft manufacturer Airbus to defer all aircraft orders scheduled for delivery in the second quarter of 2025 through the end of 2026. The orders will be deferred to 2030-2031. The plan also is tied to a shortage of Pratt & Whitney GTF engines.\n\nSpirit and airline JetBlue earlier this year failed to complete a proposed $3.8 billion merger, which faced legal battles in a U.S. District Court in Massachusetts. JetBlue agreed to pay Spirit $69 million after both mutually terminated the deal.\n\nStories by Eric Conklin\n\nAnticipated Jersey Shore restaurant with stunning sunset views opened this week\n\nN.J. lake bans swimming due to high algal levels\n\nPedestrian struck twice, killed by 2 passenger trains in Mercer County\n\nThank you for relying on us to provide the local news you can trust.
