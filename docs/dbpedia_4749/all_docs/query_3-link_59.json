        "text": "This post explains how to get to Manhattan from Newark Airport (EWR) and other parts of New York City. We go over transport by bus, train, shuttle, private car, taxi, and rideshares.\n\nThough Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) is located in New Jersey, it is considered one of NYC’s 3 main airports, along with John F. Kennedy and LaGuardia.\n\nLike many travelers, some of our local tour guides prefer flying in and out of Newark because it's less crowded and offers direct flights from more cities.\n\nWhen we wrote this post, we tapped into our local guides’ expertise about the various options for transportation from Newark to Manhattan which we share with you below.\n\nIn this video, Katie, a tour guide with us, Free Tours by Foot, details your options to get to NYC from Newark Airport.\n\nNJ Transit Train\n\nShuttle Buses and Shared Vans\n\nHow to Save on Airport Transfers\n\nPublic Bus\n\nTaxis and Private Car Services\n\nRide Share (Uber)\n\nUse this link to Google Maps to get exact directions from Newark Airport to your destination.\n\nManhattan to Newark International Airport?\n\nJust use the information in this post in reverse.\n\nBe sure to check out our other posts on the other airport options in NYC.\n\nJFK Airport to Manhattan\n\nLaGuardia Airport to Manhattan\n\nAirTrain + New Jersey Transit Train\n\nThe AirTrain connects Newark Airport terminals to New Jersey Transit trains and Amtrak trains that travel roughly 30 minutes to Penn Station in Midtown Manhattan.\n\nAirTrain operates 24 hours a day, 365 days a year and New Jersey Transit trains operate 21 hours a day, seven days a week.\n\n(There is no rail service between 2 a.m. and 5 a.m.).\n\nThis means that at just about any time of day or night, this inexpensive and fast service is available to you.\n\nOn weekdays, between 6 a.m. and 9 pm, at least 6 NJ Transit trains arrive every hour at the airport station.\n\nBetween 9 p.m. and midnight, 4 trains arrive every hour.\n\nAfter claiming your baggage, follow the signs to the AirTrain station.\n\nYou can purchase your train ticket from NJ Transit ticket machines at the AirTrain station.\n\nBoard the AirTrain from your airport terminal and get off at the only stop it goes to - Newark Liberty International Airport Station.\n\nFrom there you take an NJ Transit train to Penn Station.\n\nThe lines that service the airport are the North Jersey Coast Line and the Northeast Corridor Line.\n\nUse this helpful NJ Transit Trip Planner to see schedules.\n\nOne-Way Ticket\n\n$16.00 Adult\n\n$11.50 Child (age 5-11) | Senior | Disabled\n\nChildren under 5 ride free\n\nTravel Time: 40-50 minutes to New York Penn Station depending on the time of day\n\nPros: Trains come frequently and this is one of the quickest and cheapest options.\n\nThe NJ Transit train will take you to Penn Station in Midtown Manhattan (32nd Street and 7th Avenue), where you can easily get a taxi to your destination or connect with the subway.\n\nCons: You will have to maneuver your luggage around quite a bit so this option can be difficult for those with a lot of luggage.\n\nAlso, depending on where you are staying in New York you could still have a bit of traveling left once you get to Penn Station.\n\nNJ TRANSIT AND PATH TRAINS TO LOWER MANHATTAN\n\nWhile the above option is the fastest to get to Midtown Manhattan, it's not necessarily the fastest option, particularly if your final destination is Jersey City/Hoboken, Lower Manhattan, or parts of Brooklyn.\n\nAn alternative is to take AirTrain to the NJ Transit Train, just like explained above, but rather than heading to New York Penn Station, get off at Newark Penn Station, which is just a 4-minute ride from the airport.\n\nFrom Newark Penn Station, switch to the PATH Train, New Jersey's subway system to NYC.\n\nThe PATH trains make stops in Jersey City and Hoboken, and this is the easy choice for those whose hotels or final destinations are in either city.\n\nThen, depending on the particular line, the PATH trains head into either the Lower Manhattan/World Trade Center area or run up through Greenwich Village, Chelsea, and then Midtown Manhattan.\n\nThe World Trade Center (WTC) line ends at the Fulton Street Transit Center, where it is a much shorter ride to most of Brooklyn, compared to the time it would take from New York Penn Station.\n\nOne-Way Ticket\n\n$14.25 Adult\n\n$11.10 Child (age 5-11) | Senior | Disabled\n\nChildren under 5 ride free\n\nTravel Time: 45-60 minutes to World Trade Center depending on the time of day\n\nShuttle Buses and Shared Vans from Newark Airport to Manhattan\n\nAnother option is to take one of the shuttle bus services.\n\nTwo companies, GoAirLink and SuperShuttle, are ride-sharing services that have the door-to-door benefits of a taxi but could be significantly cheaper, depending on the number in your group.\n\nYou can request Go AirLink NYC and SuperShuttle from the ground transportation desk in the baggage claim area.\n\nYou will be assigned to a van with other passengers heading to the same general area as you. You can also book online in advance.\n\nCost: It depends on your destination from the airport.\n\nAs a point of reference, the cost from Newark International Airport to Port Authority in Midtown Manhattan will cost you around $40 per person with up to two bags.\n\nThis also includes tunnel tolls and taxes.\n\nNote that Groupon often runs deals.\n\nTravel Time: Can vary. If you are sharing a full van (11 passengers), you might be the first dropped off or you might be the last.\n\nPros: It has the convenience of a taxi and is much cheaper\n\nCons: It can take a very long time. Passengers often have to wait at the airport until there are enough people for a mostly full van, so plan to sit and wait for a bit.\n\nHow to Save on Airport Transfers\n\nThere are several ways to save money on airport transfers, but one of the easiest options is to use a New York tourist pass.\n\nCurrently, the New York Turbopass is the only pass offering a free airport transfer to EWR.\n\nThey also include admission to popular attractions such as the following:\n\nRadio City Music Hall Tour\n\nHop-on Hop-off Bus Tour\n\nOne World Observatory\n\nLiberty Helicopter Tour\n\nMadame Tussauds\n\nSpeed Boat Tour\n\nAnd more!\n\nIf you're already considering any of these activities and you want a free airport transfer, this money-saving pass can save money on everything.\n\nFor more details, check our post covering New York tourist passes.\n\nNewark Express Bus to Manhattan\n\nNewark Airport Express is a bus shuttle service that operates express service between Midtown Manhattan and Newark Airport.\n\nBuses run 4 am - 1:00 am and depart every 15 minutes (every 30 minutes in the very early morning or late at night) and the trip to the airport can be quick.\n\nThe main advantage is it has 3 Midtown Manhattan stops.\n\nGrand Central Station (41st Street between Park & Lexington Avenues)\n\nBryant Park (42nd Street & 5th Avenue)\n\nPort Authority Bus Terminal (41st Street between 8th and 9th Avenues)\n\nCost one way: Adults $16, Children 5-11 years $5, Children under 5 years ride FREE. Students 12-16 years: $10,\n\nTravel Time: 45-60 minutes depending on traffic\n\nPros: Inexpensive. Good for those on a budget. Especially convenient for anyone staying in Midtown.\n\nCons: The buses frequently run late and traffic could make the trip into NYC last as long as just over 1 hour.\n\nTaxi Cabs and Private Car Services from Newark Airport\n\nYou can take a yellow taxi cab or a car service from Newark Airport to Manhattan just as you can from the other NYC airports.\n\nThe same procedures and cautions against accepting rides from solicitors apply.\n\nYellow Taxis\n\nNewark is farther in distance from Manhattan and there is no set flat rate for taxis. This means that the fare can be quite steep, depending on your destination.\n\nTotal Cost: Varies depending on destination, but can be in the $60-80 range.\n\nTravel Time: Will vary with destination and traffic conditions.\n\nPros: Convenient door-to-door travel. For people with many bags, this can be easier than the train.\n\nCons: Very expensive. If price is a major concern this may not be the best option. Also, they can only take four people so if your group is bigger, consider a private car service.\n\nPrivate Car Service\n\nBy far the most convenient, but most expensive way to get to Manhattan from Newark Airport is by private car service.\n\nHowever, if you are traveling with a family or group of over four people (the limit that yellow taxis can take), this is a very good choice and is cost-effective.\n\nIf you want to book a private car before your trip, you can find many car services listed on Yelp.\n\nTotal Cost: This will vary depending on the destination. The approximate cost between Newark and Midtown Manhattan is $60 plus tolls.\n\nTravel Time: Again, this will vary depending on the destination\n\nPros: Can book in advance. Also, heading back to the airport from NYC, you may want to take a private car service since you can book in advance and the costs may not be much more than a taxi.\n\nCons: More costly than many of the other options. Also, like all options other than the train, you may run into traffic on your way into Manhattan.\n\nUber and Other Rideshare Apps\n\nYou can take Uber, Lyft, and other ride-share apps to and from Newark Airport. There is a designated area outside where you can easily find your Uber.\n\nFollow these instructions:\n\nWhen you are ready for your ride, open the app. Choose the EWR Airport transportation option that suits your group size and luggage needs.\n\nExit the terminal on the arrivals level and follow the signs for Ground Transportation and Passenger Pick-Up. Note that rideshare pick-up locations may vary by the terminal.\n\nSelect your terminal and door number. Then go to your assigned EWR pickup location as specified by the app. Note that the pick-up location may not always be at your nearest exit.\n\nPrices range according to your destination and time of day.\n\nAs a point of reference, the average cost of an UberX from Newark Airport to Penn Station in Midtown Manhattan at 5:00 pm (rush hour) is $60.\n\nUse the Uber Price Estimator to see an estimate of the cost and wait time.\n\nRead our posts on using Uber in NYC.\n\nRELATED POSTS\n\nThings to Do in NYC\n\nJFK Airport to Manhattan\n\nLaGuardia Airport to Manhattan"
