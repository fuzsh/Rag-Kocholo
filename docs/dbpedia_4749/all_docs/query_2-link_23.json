        "text": "First, the flight was schedule to leave at 12:08. Delayed to 12:38. It is 12:58 and I am sitting at the gate. The staff are not communicating with us (just tell me it’s gonna be five hours if that’s the case, quit hufflepuffing around like you’re trying to board us when the plane isn’t even here and you don’t know where your crew are. I’m still waiting for any communication about the further delay. This is a rebooked flight from a cancelled flight yesterday, when the airline failed to fulfill its fiduciary responsibility to hotel and cover transport for overnight cancelations. Asking about the food on the flight? What food?!? Delta doesn’t serve meals unless you pay for them and you really want me to give delta a high rating for passing out processed snacks (fun size!)? Can we be for real. Delta is cementing itself in history as one of the cheap, stingy, outdated, glory days are over airlines, and it shows. I took this flight knowing delta was going to provide below level service but this is beyond burgers!! I can’t believe a multi billion or dollar company looked straight in my eyes yesterday and I told me this wasn’t their fault and there for the extra cost in hotel and hundreds of dollars in Ubers are MY RESPONSIBILITY. The only thing I am at fault for is believing delta is reputable company worthy of my dollars. I’m not even sure I want to be compensated unless it is cash because I would rather die never traveling again than to put money in their pockets.\n\nFlight was delayed. Had to get rebooked. Diamond medallion but stuck in a crappy seat. Rebooked flight then got delayed again. Then when we finally boarded, we waited another hour for a new crew. Then landed in JFK and sat for another 40 minutes waiting for a crew to come to the gate to be able to deplane. Hot mess all around, which unfortunately is becoming the norm for Delta\n\nMy seat was changed at the last minute and I was moved to the last row, right next to the bathroom despite selecting my seat well in advance. I was also made to check my carry on due to space but when I got on the plane there was significant empty overhead space. Picking up my carry on from the luggage carousel added time to my trip which had already been extended due to delay.\n\n3 hours late and all they have is was a $12 meal voucher. That’s not even enough to cover fast food.\n\nFriendly flight attendants. Comfort plus seats were very comfortable and had lots of leg room. 10A and 10 B.\n\nOur flight to Zurich was delayed by almost 3 hours, so we missed our next flight. There was no indication it would be delayed this much. We were told the gate had changed and then it apparently took over 2 hours to load the \"catering\" on the plane. We were not compensated in any way for the trouble.\n\nThe 1st class male crew member was very pleasant - the short female with round glasses , maybe in 50’s had no personality- never spoke when delivering my food, drink, & never smiled the whole trip! In fact looked annoyed when the boarding proses was happening- I would never hire this woman - unfriendly . Have never dealt with a crew member like her-\n\nA regional sized plane was used for a cross country flight with no overhead bin space. I had to \"pink check\" my laptop and my medications. I was NOT pleased!!!!\n\nBest airline! Always friendly and welcoming. Skyclub was great and loved the fast free wifi on board. I also love that you can pre-order your meal on the app!\n\nThe gate area was incredibly short staffed, with one representative manning 4-5 flights, which caused a 3 hr delay in boarding even though the plane was all ready to leave. Other flights also were delayed because of this. The flight crew was awesome and I feel bad for the only gate worker on call, but Delta needs to hire more employees.\n\nIn-flight staff was very helpful and excellent. However, the flight was delayed by 90 minutes. Also the boarding process should be expedited in case of delayed flights. This will help the passengers trying to make international connections.\n\nThe walk from baggage claim to the taxi is very difficult for older people I will never fly into JFK again. It is physically challenging\n\nFlight was delayed by almost 5 hours. Suitcase was not loaded despite the flight being near empty (my colleagues’ suitcases did reach JFK, unlike mine). Had to argue on phone to get JetBlue to deliver the case to my hotel. Never again\n\nGreat. Loved that there was WiFi on flight to keep in touch and excellent service of beverages and snacks.\n\ngreat flight. Pilot was communicative, flight attendants were excellent. Really nice experience except my tv didn’t work.\n\nOverall, the flight was better than the flight I took to go to Florida, which had a bunch of problems. The crew is really nice and the plane was new so it had a small problem when we were on the runway, but the flight itself was great. They even made some time back up, which is always a good thing.\n\nEverything was good except for deplaning in NY. Took way too long!!\n\nJet Blue keeps getting iit wrong. 4 hour mechanical delay followed by terrible boarding experience. This is my third horrific jet blue flight in 2024. I am going to try to avoid this loser in the sky\n\nMy experience with JetBlue was fantastic! The service was top-notch, the flight was smooth, and the staff were friendly and helpful. I would definitely fly with them again.\n\nno wifi and the aircraft was very old with tiny 4” screens.\n\nOur flight was delayed several times. It left 9 hours after scheduling. We had to sleep in the airport.\n\nLike all other airlines United makes you pay for everything. Like everyone, you have to pay for checking in a bag on top of your already expensive ticket. Hence no one does it and we all show up with our luggage at boarding which forces the company to push people to drop their luggage as there is no space. Well, that delays the boarding process a d generates frustrated passengers who lashes out on the poor crew. Please go back to the simple past: charge my original ticket 30 dollars more and make one bag check in included (even in basic economy). I won't even see the difference on price but will definitely notice the beauty of having the chance to ship my luggage !\n\nThe Check-in process at ORF for united is ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE. I got there two hours early for a flight down the street and didn’t make it halfway to the register before I had to get out of line and remove my bags or miss my flight. This is every day thing and I’m clueless how this has gone on for years. This was the final straw. I’d rather pay a fortune more for a different airline than deal with this process\n\nTerrible Initial delay for almost an hour before boarding and departing in Seattle. Then a “customary” wait on the tarmac in Newark after landing for half an hour. I call it customary because it happens almost every time I land in Newark. I do t know if it’s Newark or United airline but it’s a travesty . I use Newark because it’s closer than jfk to where I live but am strongly considering switching because of extremely poor in time performance and Condé and delay after landing\n\nThe boarding process was delayed and the miscommunication of what seats are broken\n\nIt got us to our destinations pretty well but the flight from Dulles to Newark was the size of a school bus or less and the flight to Israel was better but premium seats are way tooo expensive and necessary. The seat cushions in economy plus are virtually nonexistent. The service was minimal. There was a noticeable absence of beverage service, including nonalcoholic beverages. The flight to Israel was my mos on time flight to Israel ever. The pilot talked too much, though, especially yelling instructions at everyone.\n\nIt was soooo hot I was sweating even at altitude. I know you want people to sleep, but keeping it that hot is stupid!\n\nflight delayed, was put on another flight after standby queue, luggage was misplaced and arrived to me 3 days later\n\nWas 4 1/2 hours delayed. No food options, poor entertainment and cramped seats made worse by people in front reclining while we could not as in back row.\n\nSurprisingly easy! I was hesitant to try this, but the cost swayed me. I actually felt like I had less stress than all the taxiing and possible delays that occur with short regional flights where you spend less time in the air than getting to and from the plane..\n\nThe American flight was a connecting flight to an international flight. The international flight has a 2 check bag rule. Despite being informed of this, American would only check 1 bag and wanted 100 to check the second (basically a 3rd carry-on) to NYC. Subsequently tsa took a sealed container of maple syrup and a few other things that couldn't be in carry-on plus I had to lug around 3 pieces of luggage for the entire trip. The American reservation was made with the international and American actually checked the one piece the entire way to China. This is one of the reasons that I will avoid American airlines if possible in the future.\n\nWorst flight in terms of service and food. Attendants were inexperienced, no preflight drinks, did come and give us hot towels until well into the flight. The left the Curtin open between main cabin and everyone from the main cabin went to the fist class bathroom. Food was awful! Had the golden chicken and was too lemony and inedible. No offer of coffee after. Awful!\n\nMy morning PHX to NY flight was canceled. Not a cloud in the sky. No wind. No weather across the country. My guess is they canceled the flight because they didn’t have enough people or a mechanical issue. Either way really bad. I checked it at midnight and the 830a flight was on time so I was very surprised when I woke up to see the flight canceled and I’ve been rebooked on a flight… An hour earlier than my originally scheduled one. Of course I missed this earlier flight because AA texted at 4 AM when I was sleeping. I was re routed to Miami, boarded a plane, sat in the heat for 40 minutes, then boarded because of mechanical issues and had to wait another hour before finally getting to New York Ironically, the 430 Phoenix to New York flight landed at the same time I did… I could’ve been sitting at the pool all day vs jumping through hoops. never ever will I again fly American Airlines. No offer of a free drink, maybe a few points on my advantage account nothing… As if nothing happened and they did not inconvenienced me at all. I’m so sick of the dumb crackers that they give us on these flights. It’s really like a budget Airlines these days. A far fall for s once mighty company.\n\nIt was overall a great experience. No TV’s, but you can connect to your Wi-Fi from your portable device. We had extra legroom because we were sitting in be back and the flight attendant moved us to the front with extra legroom. It was only an hour flight, so in all it was great.\n\nPlane was delayed an hour causing me to miss my flight to London and now I am not arriving until Sunday instead of Friday. I am stranded at airport and they give me $12 of food vouchers. It's a joke and everyone I talked to was rude\n\nWorst experience flying American Airlines. I fly with them often, so I was super disappointed in the service I received at gate 30 in LGA on May 24, mid-day. The flight was delayed twice. I was patiently waiting in the American Airlines lounge when I received the notice on my app that the plane was boarding 45 minutes before its newly re-scheduled take off of 4 pm (from the orginal 1:45 pm then 3:00 pm). It took me 5 min to travel from the lounge to the gate and when I arrived there at 3:20 flight gate attendant told me the flight had closed and that they announced for passengers multiple times. I showed them the notification on my app and they were really rude and unempathetic. The person who rescheduled my flight at customer service wasn't any happier but was at least helpful in getting me on the next flight.\n\nWas lucky to have a employee at the AA checkin counter that had compassion and understood they ordeal that we went through with our original flight being diverted, needing to stay in the aircraft and then flying to the original destination; adding hours to the trip and forcing us to miss our connection and our rebooked connection. She was able to get up on standby on the highest priority on the next flight to the closest airport we need to be at and it all worked out despite being many hours late.\n\nI like the boarding process, it was fast. The seat doesn’t have a TV for a long flight and food wasn’t served, just snacks.\n\nComfort of seats, ease of boarding. Food selection could be better\n\nI arrived to the airport 2 hours before my American Airlines flight was scheduled to take off. I have TSA pre-check. The airport was crazy packed when I arrived. After momentarily standing in the pre-check line, the TSA agent said that I am not pre-check. Of course I said that I am because I entered my KTN number on all my traveling sites and programs. I had to get out of line and go back to the AA counter to discover that American Airlines did not add my KTN to my boarding pass. I had to call TSA to find out my number, then have AA enter it onto my boarding pass. The emblem would not load onto my boarding pass. By this time, I decided to use my Clear in order to get through TSA but the line was ridiculous long. By the time I made through TSA, I missed my 11:08am flight and was re-booked for the 5:30pm. This is after the AA employee told me I should have gotten to the airport early. AA use to be a dependable airline not I use them only if I have too.\n\nHorrible experience, they cancelled the flight , and we had to lose money on car rentals and hotels and tickets for extraction\n\nWe were delayed departing and also it took 40 min before we were able to exit the plane after landing and there was no AC I felt like I’m going to die\n\nTo long of a delay and way to long on the plane. I know weather sucks, but I felt the flight crew did the bare minimum.\n\nflight was delayed two hours delayed another two hours and ultimately cancelled\n\nI didn't like that before both flights we had to wait for an hour sitting on the plane for maintenance reasons while this could have been done earlier. I also didn't like that we had to pay even for water. The small water bottle is 5 dollars. I also didn't like that the ticket didn't include either carry on or check in bag, are we supposed to travel without anything? I'm not happy with that.\n\nTerrible experience, will definitely NEVER fly with Spirit again (this was my first AND last time). They canceled the flight JUST minutes before we were about to board, with no warning, no reason, and no recourse. We managed to get on a different, much more expensive one-way flight home (with United) later that night, and arrived early the next morning, although by that point, the garage with our car had already closed for the day. So we were left having to pay an exorbitant $200 Uber ride to get home. Trying to fly with Spirit is definitely “penny wise and pound foolish,” absolutely NOT worth whatever meager savings they promise (and then still nickel and dime you for everything from water to a carry-on bag).\n\nIt was awful. I would have to really contemplate ever flying with spirit again!!\n\nEvery last departure to get to our two destinations was horrible delayed putting us way after midnight to get to home and had to pay extra day for parking due to them getting us back to Myrtle Beach airport after midnight. The attendant on our flight from Newark decided to spray disinfected down the aisles and cause our eyes mouth and throat to burn and thanks to that we have suffered sinusitis. Shame on Kayak for having this airline on your site.\n\nMy flight was canceled, resulting in not being able to make my daughters graduation in time.\n\nI recently flew with Spirit Airlines and had an incredibly disappointing experience. I brought a book bag, which should have easily fit in the overhead compartment, but there was no space left. Instead of offering any assistance or a reasonable solution, the airline made me pay $70 for my book bag. This fee was extremely unreasonable and added unnecessary stress to my travel. To make matters worse, the flight attendant was extremely rude, further souring the entire experience. I had a terrible time and will not be flying with Spirit Airlines again."
