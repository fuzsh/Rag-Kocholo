        "text": "Known as EWR, Newark Liberty International Airport is located 15 miles southwest of Manhattan and is part of the largest airport system in the U.S., operated by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey along with LaGuardia and JFK. We serve 30 airlines, with United Airlines as a key hub. Each year, over 30 million passengers choose Newark, making it one of the busiest airports in the U.S. and the third-largest hub for United Airlines. Experience the convenience of traveling through EWR and book with us for a hassle-free transfer. Since the events of 2001, the airport is officially known as Newark Liberty International Airport.\n\nOne of the most popular transportation options from New York airport to Manhattan are the city's iconic yellow taxis. However, since Newark Liberty Airport is the busiest airport in the United States, during peak hours, the wait time for an airport taxi can extend up to 30 minutes. With I CAR TAXI SERVICE you have the advantage of scheduling your arrival with us and we will gladly take you directly to your hotel."
