        "text": "Time Cost Best For Train 40 minutes from $16 Traveling like a local Bus 45–60 minutes from $18.70 Connecting to the subway Cab 40–70 minutes from $65 Stress-free commuting Shuttle 45–60 minutes from $32 Balancing cost and convenience\n\nWhat Is the Cheapest Way to Get From Newark Airport to Manhattan?\n\nTrains operated by NJ Transit from Newark Airport to Manhattan are the cheapest method for getting into New York. These trains run frequently, are quick, and in many ways are even more convenient than taking public transportation from JFK or LaGuardia airports. First, take the AirTrain directly from the terminal to the nearby Newark Airport train station (about 10 minutes). From there, catch a NJ Transit train to Moynihan (Penn) Station in New York City, a journey that takes 30 minutes.\n\nYou only need one ticket to ride both trains, and you can purchase them at NJ Transit ticket machines in the terminal or through the NJ Transit app. The price to New York Penn Station (Moynihan) is $16 for an adult, but the train also makes a stop at Newark Penn Station. Don't get out here if you're going to Manhattan. Double-check before completing your purchase to make sure you've selected the correct Penn Station, or you may get fined for traveling with an invalid ticket.\n\nOnce you get to Penn Station, you can use the 1,2,3, A, C, or E lines of the subway to continue on to your final destination or hail a cab from the station.\n\nWhat Is the Fastest Way to Get From Newark Airport to Manhattan?\n\nThe fastest method can vary depending on what part of the city you're going to and what time of day you're commuting. During rush hour, driving or a taking taxi will generally be the slowest method. Renting a car is not a good idea for a trip to New York City, since you won't use a car in the city and you'll end up paying a ton just to leave it in a parking garage.\n\nFrom the airport, you can hail a New Jersey cab, call an Uber or Lyft, or hire a private car service to pick you up. The benefit is that you can sit back and relax in the car while a driver takes you directly to the front door of your hotel or accommodations. However, rush hour traffic can seriously delay your arrival.\n\nUsing a taxi service is by far the most expensive option as well. Taxis are metered and a ride to downtown Manhattan will cost you at least $65, with journeys getting more expensive as you travel further uptown. Passengers are also responsible for paying bridge tolls, a rush-hour and weekend surcharge, and a credit card fee, all of which can drastically bump up the price of a regular taxi. Don't forget to add on an additional 10 percent to 20 percent of the fare for the customary tip.\n\nUber and Lyft tend to be cheaper, around $75 all-in.\n\nIs There a Bus That Goes From Newark Airport to Manhattan?\n\nThe Newark Airport Express is a coach bus that picks up from each terminal at the airport and drops off passengers at Port Authority Bus Terminal (Times Square), Bryant Park, or Grand Central Terminal. It cost only a few dollars more than taking the train, but the multiple stops may be a more convenient option if you need to travel around Manhattan after arriving. Between the three drop-off points of the Express Bus, you can catch the subway to virtually any part of the city.\n\nThe one-way fare for an adult is $18.70, but you can save money by purchasing a roundtrip ticket ($33) if you'll be flying out of Newark as well. Other discounts are also available for seniors, youth, and disabled passengers.\n\nAre There Shuttles From Newark Airport to Manhattan?\n\nRide-sharing vans are a great option for travelers who want the convenience of a door-to-door ride but without the exorbitant cost of a taxi. These shuttles are especially convenient for solo travelers since they can cost half the price of using a cab or other private car service. Several companies offer shuttle services, such as Airlink NYC. Airlink NYC rides are about $32 per passenger for a seat in a shared van, depending on your departure time, destination, and number of passengers. The perk of using this service is that you can get dropped off right at the front door of your accommodations, but it's difficult to gauge your travel time. If you're the first person in the car to be dropped off it can be as fast as taking a taxi. But if you're the last person to be dropped off, it will have been faster to take the train.\n\nWhen Is the Best Time to Travel to Manhattan?\n\nWeekday mornings and early evenings are when hundreds of thousands of New Jersey residents are commuting into/out of the city, so if taking a cab during this time, expect congested roads and long delays. Since taxis are metered from the airport, you'll pay more if your car gets stuck in heavy traffic. You'll also pay a surcharge on all taxi rides from New Jersey into New York City on weekdays 6-10 a.m. and 3-8 p.m, and weekends from 12 p.m. to 9 p.m. Congestion pricing can add $15, depending on where you're going.\n\nTrains are likely to be extra packed during weekday rush hour as well, but they also run more frequently. There is no train service between the hours of 1:30 a.m. and 4:50 a.m., so be sure to plan ahead if you have a late-night arrival.\n\nWhat's the Most Scenic Route to Manhattan?\n\nIt must be said that driving yourself from Newark Airport to Manhattan really isn't a good idea: it's expensive and time-consuming. You also won't get much of a view if you take the Lincoln Tunnel or Holland Tunnel into the city. The George Washington Bridge connects to Washington Heights up near the Bronx; if you're staying uptown, this is how you'll get to Manhattan, and you'll get a great view of the skyline on your way in.\n\nWhat Is There to Do in New York City?"
