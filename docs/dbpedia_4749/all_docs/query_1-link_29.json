        "text": "Airport transfer or Airport transportation is one of the most important transfers in Newark Airport EWR. That is the reason comes LIMO TAXI CAR , where we have the best Newark Airport limo taxi service system “BE ON TIME” . The “Be On Time” Airport Transfer system has been working perfect in Newark Airport . When you arrive at the Airport we understand you are so tired, where Limo Taxi Car came up with perfect “Be On Time” system, works so good that we pick you up at no time.\n\nNewark Liberty International Airport (EWR)\n\nformerly known as Newark International Airport, is an international airport within the city limits of both Newark and Elizabeth, New Jersey, United States. It is about 15 miles (24km) south west of Midtown Manhattan.\n\nNewark is a major hub for United Airlines, which is the airport’s largest tenant (operating all of Terminal C and part of Terminal A). United Airlines and FedEx operate cargo hubs. The airports in the New York metropolitan area combine to create the largest airport system in the United States, the second largest in the world in terms of passenger traffic, and largest in the world in terms of total flight operations. In 2013, Newark Airport handled 35 million passengers, JFK handled 50.4 million, and LaGuardia handled 26.7 million.\n\nTerminals\n\nNewark Liberty International Airport has three passenger terminals. Terminal A and Terminal B were completed in 1973 and have four levels. Ticket counters are on the top floor, except for the second-floor Air India and first-floor British Airways desks in Terminal B. Gates and shops are on the third floor. Baggage carousels (both A and B) are on the second floor, and Terminal B has an international arrivals lounge on that floor too. Finally, short-term parking and ramp operations (restricted areas) are on the ground floor.\n\nTerminal C, designed by Grad Associates and completed in 1988, has two ticketing levels, one for international check-in and one for domestic check-in. The main terminal building for Terminal C was built alongside Terminals A and B in the 1970s, but lay dormant until People Express Airlines took it over as a replacement for the former North Terminal when the airline’s hub there outgrew the old facility. Upon opening, Terminal C had 41 gates, originally with one departures level, one arrivals level, and an underground parking garage. The gates, as well as food and shopping outlets, are located on a mezzanine level between the two check-in floors.\n\nLimo to Newark Airport, Taxi to Newark Airport, shuttle to Newark Airport, limousine to Newark Airport, car service to Newark Airport, Newark Airport limo, Newark Airport taxi, Newark Airport cab, Newark Airport car service, Limo to EWR, taxi to EWR, shuttle to EWR, limousine to EWR, cab to EWR, car service to EWR, EWR limo, EWR taxi, EWR cab, EWR car service.Limo Taxi Car & Newark Airport Limousine Service – EWR Airport Limo & Shuttle\n\nEWR | LGA | JFK | TEB | SWF | HPN | MMU"
