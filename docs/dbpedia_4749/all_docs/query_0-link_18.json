        "text": "Everything You Need to Know About EWR Airport\n\nOn the first day of October in 1928, Newark Liberty International Airport began operations. Originally known as Newark Metropolitan Airport, it was the only airport available to serve travelers flying in and out of New York City for eleven years until LaGuardia Airport was constructed in 1939. In 1934, Newark Airport’s first terminal, the Art Deco Administration Building, was added on. Operations continued until the start of World War II when the United States Army took control of Newark Airport for logistics operations. In 1946, the airport reopened and has been operated by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey ever since. As construction continued and the airport was expanded, it was renamed Newark International Airport.\n\nLocated near the New York and Philadelphia Metropolitan areas, Newark Liberty International Airport is one of the busiest airports in the United States, with most of its passengers traveling via United Airlines. On September 11th, 2001, the tragic hijacking and crash of United Airlines Flight 93 led to the airport’s renaming, and it is now officially known as Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR). Each year, Newark Airport sees over 30 million passengers, and it serves as United Airline’s third-largest hub. Newark Airport works in conjunction with La Guardia Airport and John F. Kennedy International Airport to serve travelers in the New York Metropolitan Area.\n\nNewark Airport Terminals\n\nNewark Liberty International Airport’s three terminals are arranged in a semi-circle. Terminals A, B, and C serve domestic, international, and United Airlines passengers respectively, with each terminal offering its own unique selection of shopping, dining, and amenities. Lounges are also available in each of the terminals for passengers who want to escape the loud, busy nature of the airport in exchange for a nap, hot shower, and a light meal or drink. Newark Airport’s Terminal C is well-known as one of the best places to eat and shop on the East Coast, so travelers flying out of this terminal may want to arrive early so they have time to enjoy it before departure.\n\nPhoto by Scott Brody CC BY\n\nEWR Terminal C\n\nTerminal C at Newark Airport is owned by United Airlines and is divided into concourses B1, B2, and B3. Domestic and international flights operate from Terminal C, and passengers can travel throughout the concourses without going through security each time. Newark Liberty International Airport’s Terminal C is renowned as an excellent shopping and dining hub, and passengers are spoiled with choices of places to eat, drink, and shop while they wait for their flights. Helpful amenities and lounges are available for travelers to use at their leisure in Terminal C.\n\nNewark Liberty International Airport Lounges\n\nEach terminal at Newark Liberty International Airport offers several lounges where passengers can rest, enjoy light refreshments, grab a drink, work, and shower. The Newark Airport lounges offer relaxing spaces for passengers to destress, grab a bite to eat, or catch up on work while they wait for their flights. The lounge areas are popular among passengers with long layovers at Newark Liberty International Airport, and they offer quiet, comfortable spaces for passengers to retreat to while they wait. Access to some EWR lounges can be purchased at the door, but some require a first-class reservation or membership to enter.\n\nPhoto by Newark CC BY\n\nNewark Airport Parking Lots\n\nNewark Liberty International Airport offers several parking options for travelers to choose from. Short term, economy, and daily parking can be found onsite at EWR, and off-site parking options are available at airport hotels and other parking facilities. Valet parking is also available at Newark Liberty International Airport and some of the off-site parking facilities. Onsite parking rates vary by lot and are significantly more expensive than the rates at off-site parking facilities like Newark Airport Long Term Parking.\n\nPhoto by Qwesy CC BY\n\nNewark Airport Short Term Parking\n\nThe Newark Airport Short Term Parking Lots are located across from Terminals A, B, and C. Parking rates in the short term lots are $4 for each half-hour with a daily maximum rate of $39. This lot is mainly used by travelers taking short trips and those who wish to park close to the terminal area. Because of the expensive parking rates at these lots, it’s best not to use them for extended trips. Instead, make your reservation at Newark Airport Long Term Parking where you’ll enjoy additional perks and better rates.\n\nNewark Airport Economy Parking (P6)\n\nThe Newark Airport Economy Parking Lot (P6) is located three miles from the terminal area. The daily rate for parking in the economy lot is $18 and $6 every eight hours after the first 24-hour period. This lot is ideal for passengers who will be away for several weeks, but travelers who park in this lot will need to take the AirTrain to reach the terminal area. If you’re looking to save even more on EWR parking, look no further Newark Airport Long Term Parking. You can book parking accommodations for your vehicle at a fraction of the price."
