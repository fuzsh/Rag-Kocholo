        "text": "International airport in Newark, New JerseyTemplate:SHORTDESC:International airport in Newark, New Jersey\n\n\"EWR\" and \"Newark Airport\" redirect here. For other uses, see EWR (disambiguation) and Newark Airport (disambiguation).\n\nNewark Liberty International Airport (IATA: EWR, ICAO: KEWR, FAA LID: EWR), originally Newark Metropolitan Airport and later Newark International Airport, is an international airport straddling the boundary between the cities of Newark in Essex County and Elizabeth in Union County, New Jersey. The airport is currently owned jointly by the cities of Elizabeth and Newark and leased to and operated by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.[3]\n\nNewark Airport is located 3 miles (4.8 km) south of Downtown Newark, and 9 miles (14 km) west-southwest of the borough of Manhattan. It is one of three major airports serving the New York metropolitan area; the others are John F. Kennedy International Airport and LaGuardia Airport, which are also operated by the Port Authority.[4]\n\nThe airport is located near the Newark Airport Interchange, the junction between Interstate 95 and Interstate 78 (both components of the New Jersey Turnpike), as well as U.S. Routes 1 and 9, which has junctions with U.S. Route 22 and Route 81. The airport handles almost as many flights as John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK), despite being 40 percent of JFK's land size. The City of Newark built the airport on 68 acres (28 ha) of marshland in 1928 and the Army Air Corps operated the facility during World War II. After the Port Authority took it over in 1948, an instrument runway, a terminal building, a control tower and an air cargo center were added. The airport's original 1935 central terminal building is a National Historic Landmark. EWR employs more than 24,000 people.[5]\n\nIn 2017, EWR was the sixth-busiest airport in the United States by international passenger traffic and fifteenth-busiest airport in the country. It served 43,393,499 passengers in 2017, which made EWR the 43rd-busiest airport in the world by passenger traffic. In 2019, the airport saw 46,336,452 passengers, the most in its history. In 2020, EWR served 15,892,892 passengers, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which made it the 50th-busiest airport.[6]\n\nNewark serves 50 carriers and is the third-largest hub for United Airlines, the airport's largest tenant, and FedEx Express, its second-largest tenant (operating in three buildings on two million square feet of airport property).[7] During the 12-month period ending in July 2014, over 68% of all passengers at the airport were carried by United Airlines.[8]\n\nHistory[]\n\nEarly years[]\n\nNewark Metropolitan Airport opened on October 1, 1928, on 68 acres (28 ha) of reclaimed land along the Passaic River,[5] the first major airport serving passengers in the New York metro area.[9] The Art Deco style Newark Metropolitan Airport Administration Building, adorned with murals by Arshile Gorky,[10] was built in 1934 and dedicated by Amelia Earhart in 1935.[11] It served as the terminal until the opening of the North Terminal in 1953. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979 and is now a museum and Port Authority Police headquarters.[12]\n\nNewark was the busiest commercial airport in the world until LaGuardia Airport opened in December 1939; the March 1939 Official Aviation Guide shows 61 weekday departures on five airlines, but by mid-1940 passenger airlines had all left Newark.[13][14]\n\nDuring World War II the field was closed to commercial aviation while it was taken over by the United States Army for logistics operations. In 1945 captured German aircraft brought from Europe on HMS Reaper for evaluation under Operation Lusty were off-loaded at Newark AAF and then flown or shipped to Freeman Field, Indiana or Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Maryland. The airlines returned to Newark in February 1946. In 1948, the city of Newark leased the airport to the Port of New York Authority (now the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey). As part of the deal, the Port Authority took operational control of the airport and began investing heavily in capital improvements, including new hangars, a new terminal and runway 4/22.[15]\n\nThe February 1947 C&GS diagram shows 5,940-foot (1,811 m) runway 1, 7,900-foot (2,408 m) runway 6 and 7,100-foot (2,164 m) runway 10.\n\nOn December 16, 1951, a Miami Airlines C-46 bound for Tampa lost a cylinder on takeoff from runway 28 and crashed in Elizabeth killing 56.[16] On January 22, 1952, an American Airlines CV-240 crashed in Elizabeth while on approach to Runway 6, killing all 23 aboard and seven on the ground.[17] On February 11, 1952, a National DC-6 crashed in Elizabeth after takeoff from runway 24, killing 29 of 63 on board and four on the ground.[18][19] Inevitably, the airport was closed for some months; airline traffic resumed later in the year, but the airport's continued unpopularity and the New York area's growing air traffic led to searches for new airport sites. Port Authority's proposal to build a new airport at what is now the Great Swamp National Wildlife Refuge was defeated by local opposition.[20]\n\nThe April 1957 Official Airline Guide showed 144 weekday passenger fixed-wing departures from Newark: 40 Eastern, 19 Capital, 16 American, 14 United, 14 Mohawk, 13 Allegheny, 11 TWA, 8 National, 5 Delta and 4 Braniff. National had a nonstop to Miami, Eastern had nonstops to Miami, New Orleans and Houston, Braniff had a nonstop DC-7C to Dallas and TWA flew nonstop to St Louis; no other nonstops to points west of St. Louis and no international nonstops.[21]\n\nLate 20th century[]\n\nThrough the early 1970s, Newark had a single terminal building located on the north side of the field, by what is now Interstate 78.[22] In the 1970s the airport became Newark International Airport. Present Terminals A and B opened in 1973, although some charter and international flights requiring customs clearance remained at the North Terminal. The main building of Terminal C was completed at the same time, but only metal framing work was completed for the terminal's satellites. It lay dormant until the mid-1980s, when for a brief time the west third of the terminal was equipped for international arrivals and used for some People Express transcontinental flights. Terminal C was finally completed and opened in June 1988.[23]\n\nUnderutilized in the 1970s, Newark expanded dramatically in the 1980s. People Express struck a deal with the Port Authority to use the North Terminal as its air terminal and corporate office in 1981 and began operations at Newark that April. It grew quickly, increasing Newark's traffic through the 1980s.[24] Virgin Atlantic began service between Newark and London in 1984, challenging JFK's status as New York's international gateway (but Virgin Atlantic now has more flights at JFK than at Newark). Federal Express (now known as FedEx Express) opened its second hub at the airport in 1986.[7] When People Express merged into Continental in 1987, operations (including corporate office operations) at the North Terminal were reduced and the building was demolished to make way for cargo facilities in the early 1997. This merger started Continental's and later United Airlines', dominance at Newark Airport.[23]\n\nOn July 22, 1981, a railroad tank car carrying ethylene oxide caught fire at the Port Newark freight yard causing the evacuation of a one-mile radius, which included the evacuation of the North Terminal building of Newark International Airport.[25]\n\nIn late 1996 the monorail opened, connecting the three terminals, the overflow parking lots and garages, and the rental car facilities. A new International Arrivals Facility also opened in Terminal B that year.[9] The monorail was expanded to the new Newark Airport train station on Amtrak's Northeast Corridor line in 2001 and was renamed AirTrain Newark.[26]\n\n21st century[]\n\nAfter the hijacking and crash of United Airlines Flight 93 in the September 11 attacks in 2001 while en route from Newark to San Francisco, the airport's name was changed from Newark International Airport to Newark Liberty International Airport in 2002. This name was chosen over the initial proposal, Liberty International Airport at Newark, and pays tribute to the victims of the September 11 attacks and to the landmark Statue of Liberty, lying just 7 miles (11 km) east of the airport.[27][28]\n\nA modern control tower was built in 2002 and opened in 2003. It is the fourth and tallest tower in the airport's history, standing 325 feet (99 m) over the main parking lot.[9]\n\nThe original control tower was demolished from February–July 2004.[29]\n\nIn October 2015, Singapore Airlines announced intentions to resume direct nonstop service between Newark and its main hub at Singapore Changi Airport which had ended in November 2013.[30] The airline announced that service would resume some time in 2018, and the Airbus A350-900ULR was chosen as the aircraft for the route.[31][32] On May 30, 2018, Singapore Airlines officially announced that nonstop service between Newark and Singapore would begin on October 11, 2018, and Newark Liberty once again became host to the world's longest non-stop flights.[33] On March 25, 2020, however, service was once again suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[34]\n\nContinental Airlines (now merged with United Airlines) began flying from Newark to Beijing on June 15, 2005, and to Delhi on November 1, 2005. The airline soon started flights to Mumbai. On July 16, 2007, Continental announced it would seek government approval for nonstop flights between Newark and Shanghai in 2009. Continental began flights to Shanghai from Newark on March 25, 2009, using Boeing 777-200ER aircraft. Newark was the only New York area airport used by Philippine Airlines (PAL), until financial problems in the late 1990s caused it to terminate this service. In March 2015, PAL resumed service to the New York metropolitan area routing to JFK Airport, and will not return to Newark, following the removal of the Philippines from the air safety blacklist of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).[35]\n\nIn June 2008 flight caps were put in place to restrict the number of flights to 81 per hour. The flight caps, in effect until 2009, were intended to be a short-term solution to Newark's congestion. The FAA has since embarked on a seven-year-long project to reduce congestion in all three New York area airports and the surrounding flight paths.[36]\n\nNewark is a major hub for United Airlines (Continental Airlines before the 2010–12 merger). United has its Global Gateway at Terminal C, having completed a major expansion project that included a new, third concourse and a new Federal Inspection Services facility. With its Newark hub, United has the most service of any airline in the New York area. On March 6, 2014, United opened a new 132,000-square-foot (12,300 m2), $25 million hangar on a 3-acre (1.2 ha) parcel to accommodate United's wide body aircraft during maintenance.[37] In 2015, the airline announced plans to leave JFK altogether and streamline its transcontinental operations at Newark.[38] On July 7, 2016, the United States Department of Transportation announced that Newark was one of ten cities to first operate flights to José Martí International Airport in Havana, Cuba.[39]\n\nSouthwest Airlines began service at the airport in 2011, flying to ten cities. It ended all Newark service in November 2019, primarily due to the Boeing 737 MAX groundings, low demand, and inadequate facilities, and consolidated its New York-area operations to Long Island & LaGuardia.[40]\n\nAs of 2012 , United carried 71% of the airport's passengers. The two next-busiest airlines, Delta Air Lines and JetBlue, each had less than 5%.[41]\n\nIn 2016, the Port Authority approved and announced a redevelopment plan to replace Terminal A, set to fully open in 2022.[42] A $2.7 billion investment, Terminal One is expected to increase passenger flow and gate flexibility between airlines, and would also be accompanied by a replacement for the AirTrain Newark monorail system, scheduled for completion in 2024. Terminal One will have 33 gates, increasing Newark's gate total to 125, including 16 international gates that can be alternated so that 2 narrow-body aircraft or 1 wide-body aircraft can occupy a space.[42]\n\nFacilities[]\n\nRunways[]\n\nThe airport covers 2,027 acres (820 ha) and has three runways and one helipad:[43]\n\n4L/22R: 11,000 by 150 feet (3,353 m × 46 m), asphalt/concrete, grooved\n\n4R/22L: 10,000 by 150 feet (3,048 m × 46 m), asphalt, grooved\n\n11/29: 6,726 by 150 feet (2,050 m × 46 m), asphalt, grooved\n\nHelipad H1: 54 by 54 feet (16 m × 16 m), asphalt\n\nRunway 11/29 is one of the three runways built during World War II. In 1952 Runways 1/19 and 6/24 were closed and a new Runway 4/22 (now 4R/22L) opened at a length of 7,000 ft (2,100 m). After 1970 this runway was extended to 9,800 feet (3,000 m), shortened for a while to 9,300 ft (2,800 m) and finally reached its present length by 2000. Runway 4L/22R opened in 1970 at a length of 8,200 ft (2,500 m) and was extended to its current length by 2000.[44]\n\nAll approaches except Runway 29 have Instrument Landing Systems and Runway 4R is certified for Category III approaches. Runway 22L had been upgraded to CAT III approach capability.[36]\n\nRunway 4L/22R is primarily used for takeoffs while 4R/22L is primarily used for landings and 11/29 is used by smaller aircraft or when there are strong crosswinds on the two main runways. Newark's parallel runways (4L and 4R) are 950 feet (290 m) apart, the fourth smallest separation of major airports in the U.S., after San Francisco International Airport, Los Angeles International Airport and Seattle–Tacoma International Airport.[45]\n\nUnlike the other two major New York-area airports, JFK and LaGuardia, which are located directly next to large bodies of water (Jamaica Bay and the East River, respectively) and whose runways extend at least partially out into them, Newark Liberty, while located just across Interstate 95 from Newark Bay and not far from the Hudson River, does not directly front upon either body of water, so the airport and its runways are completely land-locked.[46][47][48]\n\nTerminals[]\n\nAcross the airport's three terminals, there are 121 gates: Terminal A has 29 gates, Terminal B has 24 gates, and Terminal C has 68 gates.[49]\n\nEach terminal has three concourses: Terminal A, for instance, is divided into concourses A1, A2 and A3. Gate numbering starts in Terminal A with Gate 10 and ends in Terminal C with Gate 138 (139 has been decommissioned since 138 became a 2 jet bridge gate). Wayfinding signage throughout the terminals was designed by Paul Mijksenaar, who also designed signage for LaGuardia and JFK Airports.[50]\n\nTerminal A[]\n\nTerminal A was completed in 1973 and has four levels. Terminal A is operated by EWR Terminal One LLC, part of Flughafen München GmbH. Terminal A handles only domestic and Canadian flights served by JetBlue (for domestic flights), Air Canada, Air Canada Express, Alaska Airlines, American Airlines, American Eagle; and some United Express (i.e., ultra-short haul) flights. Terminal A handles all of JetBlue's domestic departures and all domestic arrivals. All of JetBlue's international departures and arrivals are at Terminal B.[51][52]\n\nIn Terminal A, ticket counters are on the top floor, baggage carousels are on the second floor, and parking is on the first floor. There is one United Club in Terminal A's second concourse. Gates and shops are on the third floor. Terminal A is the only terminal that has no immigration facilities; flights arriving from other countries cannot use Terminal A (except countries with U.S. customs preclearance), although some departing international flights use the terminal.[53]\n\nTerminal B[]\n\nLike Terminal A, Terminal B was completed in 1973 and has four levels. Terminal B is the only passenger terminal directly operated by the Port Authority. Terminal B handles most foreign carriers; and also handles JetBlue's international flights, other carriers, such as Delta Airlines, Delta Connection, Sun Country, Elite Airways, Allegiant Air, and Spirit Airlines flights, and some of United's international arrivals.[52]\n\nIn Terminal B, ticket counters are on the top floor, except for the second-floor Aer Lingus, Frontier Airlines, Delta Air Lines and Spirit Airlines counters and first-floor British Airways, Level, and Icelandair. Baggage carousels are on the first floor for domestic arrivals and on the second floor for international arrivals. Terminal B also has an international arrivals lounge on the second floor.[54] Gates and shops are on the third floor.[55]\n\nIn 2008, Terminal B was renovated to increase capacity for departing passengers and passenger comfort. The renovations included expanding and updating the ticketing areas, building a new departure level for domestic flights and building a new arrivals hall.[56] In January 2012, Port Authority executive director Patrick Foye said $350 million would be spent on Terminal B, addressing complaints by passengers that they cannot move freely.[57] Further developments were made to Terminal B when the Port Authority installed new LED fixtures in 2014. The LED fixtures developed by Sensity Systems, use wireless network capabilities to collect and feed data into the software that can spot long lines, recognize license plates, and identify suspicious activity and alert the appropriate staff.[58]\n\nTerminal C[]\n\nTerminal C, designed by Grad Associates[60] was completed in 1988. Terminal C is exclusively operated by and for United Airlines and its regional carrier United Express for their global hub at EWR. The terminal has two ticketing levels, one for international check-in and one for domestic check-in. The main terminal building for Terminal C was built alongside Terminals A and B in the 1970s, but lay dormant until People Express Airlines took it over as a replacement for the former North Terminal when the airline's hub there outgrew the old facility. Upon opening, Terminal C had 41 gates, one departures level, one arrivals level, and an underground parking garage.\n\nFrom 1998 to 2003, Terminal C was rebuilt and expanded in a $1.2 billion program known as the Continental Airlines Global Gateway Project.[61][62] The project, which was designed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill,[61] doubled the available space for outbound travelers as the former baggage claim/arrivals hall was remodeled and turned into a second departures level. Probably most significant was the addition of International Concourse C-3, a spacious and airy new facility with capacity for a maximum of 19 narrowbody aircraft (or 12 widebody planes). Completion of this new concourse increased Terminal C's mainline jet gates to 57. Concomitant with Concourse C-3 is a new international arrivals facility. Also included in the project: a 3,400-space parking garage constructed in front of the terminal, a new airside corridor connecting Concourses C-1, C-2 and C-3, a new President's Club — now called United Polaris Lounge — for international Polaris Business and Polaris First flights between C-2 and C-3, and all-new baggage processing facilities, including reconstruction of the former underground parking area into a new baggage claim and arrivals hall.[63][64]\n\nTerminal C also has many food and shopping outlets. The C1 concourse of Terminal C has Abruzzo[65], Johnston Murphy[66], Philly Cheesesteaks by Pat La Frieda[67], Surf[68], Red Mango[69], Melange[70], and Starbucks[71]. The C2 concourse of Terminal C has Vanguard Kitchen[72], Hudson Booksellers[73], Garden State Diner[74], and Wendy's[75]. The C3 concourse of Terminal C has Caps Beer Garden[76], Jamba Juice[77], Tacquila[78], Wabi-Sabi[79], and Classified which is an Invite only eatery for United Airlines customers.[80]\n\nIn November 2014, airport amenity manager OTG announced a $120 million renovation plan for Terminal C that included installing 6,000 iPads and 55 new restaurants headed by celebrity chefs, with the first new restaurants opening in summer of 2015 and the whole project completed in 2016.[81]\n\nNew Terminal A[]\n\nIn 2016, the Port Authority approved and announced a redevelopment plan to build a new Terminal A to replace the existing, which opened in 1973. Built on a site once occupied by United Parcel Service and the United States Postal Service,[42] the new terminal, is expected to cost around $2.7 billion, and will include a new six-level, 3,000-car parking garage and rental center,[42] 33 gates, and a walkway to connect the AirTrain station, parking garage, and terminal building.[82][83][84][42] The project is expected to open in two phases, with the first in spring 2022 and the second in late 2022.[85]\n\nDesigned by Grimshaw Architects, the redevelopment is expected to offer more traffic lanes at pick-up and drop-off points, closer check-in counters and security areas to the entrance, and more gate flexibility to allow planes to park at any gate in a \"common-use\" system.[42] The new Terminal A will have four levels: the departures level, the mezzanine level for offices, the arrivals level, and the ground floor, where baggage claim will be located.[42] The terminal will be operated as EWR Terminal One LLC by Munich Airport International, a subsidiary of Munich Airport, which will manage the terminal's operations, maintenance, and concessions in the 1 million square feet of retail space.[86] The redevelopment also comes with plans to replace the existing AirTrain monorail system, scheduled to open in 2024.[42] As of September 30, 2021, the A1 concourse of Terminal A has been closed, and gates 14, 15, 16A, 16, 17, and 18 have been decommissioned.[87][88]\n\nImpact of COVID-19[]\n\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, aircraft operations in Terminal A have drastically changed with only 15,892,892 passengers in 2020, but the previous year it had 46,336,452 the most in its history.[89][90] Alaska Air Lines trimmed its Newark schedule to just three daily flights and has leased their gates (A30 and A31) to JetBlue to accommodate their increased operations.[91] In addition, United Airlines has vacated concourse A2 in favor of Terminal C for their operations. United has not yet announced when, or if, they will return to Terminal A. JetBlue currently utilizes Gates 16, 16A, 17, 18, 20, 21, 22, 23, 30, and 31 in Terminal A and is now the dominant carrier of the Terminal.[92] As of Summer 2021, United has returned some Express service to Terminal A.[citation needed]\n\nMost international flights from the airport are still suspended with the exception of United's flights to major European, Latin American, and Caribbean destinations.[93]\n\nGround transportation[]\n\nTrain[]\n\nA monorail system, AirTrain Newark, connects the terminals with Newark Liberty International Airport Station. The station is served by New Jersey Transit's Northeast Corridor Line and North Jersey Coast Line, with connections to regional rail hubs such as Newark Penn Station, Secaucus Junction and New York Penn Station where transfers are available to any rail line in northern New Jersey or Long Island, New York. Amtrak's Northeast Regional and Keystone Service trains also stop at the Newark Liberty International Airport station. A fee for the AirTrain is included with rail ticket purchases, with the exception of children 11 and younger and customers using monthly passes with the airport as the origin or destination. Passengers can also ride the AirTrain for free between the terminals and the parking lots, parking garages, and rental car facilities.[citation needed]\n\nIn September 2012, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey announced that work would commence on a study to explore extending the PATH system to the station.[94] The new station would be located at ground level to the west of the existing NJ Transit station.[95] In 2014, the Board of Commissioners approved a formal proposal to extend the PATH to Newark Airport.[96] On January 11, 2017, the PANYNJ released its 10-year capital plan that included $1.7 billion for the extension. Under the plan, construction is projected to start in 2020, with service in 2026.[97][98]\n\nIn January 2019, New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy announced a plan for a $2 billion replacement project for AirTrain Newark. Murphy has stated that replacement is necessary because the system is reaching the end of its projected 25-year life and is subject to persistent delays and breakdowns. The Port Authority would be responsible for funding the project.[99] In October 2019, the Port Authority board approved the replacement project with an estimated cost of $2.05 billion. Construction is expected to start in the first quarter of 2022. The testing of the new system expected to start 2025. It is expected to go into service in 2026 and the old monorail will be demolished.[100]\n\nBus[]\n\nNJT buses operate northbound local service to Irvington, Downtown Newark and Newark Penn Station, where connections are available to the PATH and NJ Transit rail lines. The go bus 28 is a bus rapid transit line to Downtown Newark, Newark Broad Street Station and Bloomfield Station. Southbound service travels to Elizabeth, Lakewood, Toms River and intermediate points.[citation needed]\n\nOlympia Trails operates express buses to the Port Authority Bus Terminal, Bryant Park and Grand Central Terminal in Manhattan,[101] and Super-Shuttle, Go Airport Shuttle and Go-link operate shared taxi services.[102]\n\nRoad[]\n\nPrivate limousine, car service, and taxis also provide service to/from the airport. Taxis serving the airport charge a flat rate based on destination. For trips to/from New York, fares are set by the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission.[citation needed]\n\nThe airport is served directly by U.S. Route 1/9, which provides connections to Route 81 and Interstate 78, both of which have interchanges with the New Jersey Turnpike (Interstate 95) at exits 13A and 14, respectively. Northbound, Route 1/9 becomes the Pulaski Skyway, which connects to Route 139. Route 139 continues east to the Holland Tunnel, which links Jersey City with Lower Manhattan.[citation needed]\n\nThe airport operates short and long term parking lots with shuttle buses and monorail access to the terminals. The shuttle bus fleet is slowly being upgraded to electric buses, with half the buses to be upgraded by the summer of 2019.[103]\n\nA free cellphone lot waiting area is available for drivers picking up passengers at the airport.[104]\n\nAirlines and destinations[]\n\nPassenger[]\n\nAirlinesDestinationsRefs Aer Lingus Dublin [105] Air Canada Calgary, Vancouver [106] Air Canada Express Montréal–Trudeau, Ottawa, Toronto–Pearson [106] Air India Delhi, Mumbai [107] Alaska Airlines Los Angeles, Portland (OR), San Diego, San Francisco, Seattle/Tacoma [108] Allegiant Air Asheville, Cincinnati, Destin/Fort Walton Beach, Grand Rapids, Savannah\n\nSeasonal: Knoxville [109] American Airlines Charlotte, Chicago–O'Hare, Dallas/Fort Worth, Miami, Phoenix–Sky Harbor [110] American Eagle Chicago–O'Hare [110] Austrian Airlines Vienna [111] British Airways London–Heathrow [112] Delta Air Lines Atlanta, Detroit, Minneapolis/St. Paul, Salt Lake City [113] Delta Connection Boston, Cincinnati, Detroit, Minneapolis/St. Paul, Raleigh/Durham [113] El Al Tel Aviv [114] Elite Airways Melbourne/Orlando, St. Augustine\n\nSeasonal: Vero Beach [115] Emirates Athens, Dubai–International [116] Ethiopian Airlines Addis Ababa, Lomé [117] French Bee Paris–Orly [118] Icelandair Reykjavík–Keflavík [119] JetBlue Antigua (ends April 30, 2022),[120] Aruba, Atlanta, Austin, Barbados (ends April 30, 2022),[120] Boston, Cancún, Cartagena, Charleston (SC), Fort Lauderdale, Fort Myers, Jacksonville (FL), Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Miami, Montego Bay, Nassau, Orlando, Phoenix–Sky Harbor, Port-au-Prince, Providenciales, Puerto Plata, Punta Cana, Raleigh/Durham, San Diego, San Francisco, San Juan, Santiago de los Caballeros, Santo Domingo–Las Américas, Sarasota, St. Lucia–Hewanorra, St. Maarten, St. Thomas, Tampa, West Palm Beach\n\nSeasonal: Aguadilla, Martha's Vineyard, Nantucket, Seattle/Tacoma [121] La Compagnie Milan–Malpensa (begins April 15, 2022),[122] Paris–Orly\n\nSeasonal: Nice [123] LOT Polish Airlines Warsaw–Chopin\n\nSeasonal: Kraków (resumes June 3, 2022),[124] Rzeszów [125] Lufthansa Frankfurt, Munich [126] Porter Airlines Toronto–Billy Bishop [127] Scandinavian Airlines Copenhagen, Oslo, Stockholm–Arlanda [128] Singapore Airlines Singapore (resumes March 28, 2022)[129] [130] Spirit Airlines Atlanta, Austin, Boston, Fort Lauderdale, Fort Myers, Houston–Intercontinental, Las Vegas, Miami, Myrtle Beach, Nashville, New Orleans, Orlando, San Juan, Tampa, West Palm Beach [131] Sun Country Airlines Minneapolis/St. Paul\n\nSeasonal: Madison [132] Swiss International Air Lines Zürich [133] TAP Air Portugal Lisbon, Porto [134] Turkish Airlines Istanbul [135] United Airlines Aguadilla, Amsterdam, Antigua, Aruba, Atlanta, Austin, Barbados, Barcelona, Beijing–Capital, Berlin, Bogotá, Bonaire, Boston, Brussels, Cancún, Cape Town, Charleston (SC), Charlotte, Chicago–O'Hare, Cleveland, Dallas/Fort Worth, Delhi, Denver, Dublin, Edinburgh (resumes March 5, 2022),[136] Fort Lauderdale, Fort Myers, Frankfurt, Geneva, Grand Cayman, Guatemala City, Hong Kong, Honolulu, Houston–Intercontinental, Jacksonville (FL), Johannesburg–O.

Yellow signs direct passengers to airline gates, ticketing and other flight services; green signs direct passengers to ground transportation services and black signs lead to restrooms, telephones and other passenger amenities. New York City traffic reporter Bernie Wagenblast provides the voice for the airport's radio station and curbside announcements, as well as the messages heard onboard AirTrain Newark and in its stations.[citation needed]\n\nThe airport has the IATA airport code EWR, rather than a designation that begins with the letter 'N' because the designator of \"NEW\" is already assigned to Lakefront Airport in New Orleans, LA, and because the Department of the Navy uses three-letter identifiers beginning with N for its purposes.[159]\n\nAccommodations[]\n\nWithin the Newark Liberty International Airport complex is a Marriott hotel, the only hotel located on airport property.[160] Shuttle vans operate between the hotel and terminals because the Marriott is not serviced by the monorail and there is no official walking route to the terminals, despite the Marriott's immediate proximity to the main parking lot between the terminals.[citation needed]\n\nAccidents and incidents[]\n\nOn March 17, 1929, a Colonial Western Airlines Ford Tri-Motor suffered a double engine failure during its initial climb after takeoff, failed to gain height, and crashed into a railroad freight car loaded with sand, killing 14 of the 15 people on board. At the time, it was the deadliest aviation accident in American history.[161]\n\nOn January 14, 1933, Eastern Air Transport, a Curtiss Condor, crashed at Newark; two crewmembers were killed.[162]\n\nOn May 4, 1947, Union Southern Airlines, a Douglas DC-3 with 12 passengers and crew, crashed on landing at Newark after overrunning the runway and into a ditch where it burned. Two crewmembers were killed.[163]\n\nOn December 16, 1951, a Miami Airlines C-46 Commando (converted for passenger use) lost a cylinder on takeoff from Runway 28 and crashed in Elizabeth, killing 56.[16]\n\nOn January 22, 1952, American Airlines Flight 6780, a Convair 240, crashed in Elizabeth on approach to Runway 6, killing 30.[17]\n\nOn February 11, 1952, National Airlines Flight 101, a Douglas DC-6, crashed in Elizabeth after takeoff from Runway 24, killing 33.[19][164]\n\nOn April 18, 1979, a New York Airways commuter helicopter on a routine flight to LaGuardia Airport and John F. Kennedy International Airport plunged 150 feet (46 m) into the area between Runways 4L/22R and 4R/22L, killing three passengers and injuring 15. It was later determined the crash was due to a failure in the helicopter's tail rotor.[165]\n\nOn March 30, 1983, a Learjet 23 operated by Hughes Charter Air, a night check courier flight, crashed on landing at EWR during an unstabilized approach. Both crewmembers were killed. Marijuana was later found in their systems, impairing judgement.[166]\n\nOn July 31, 1997, FedEx Flight 14, a McDonnell Douglas MD-11, crashed while landing after a flight from Anchorage International Airport. The Number 3 engine contacted the runway during a rough landing, which caused the aircraft to flip upside down. The aircraft was destroyed by fire. The two crewmembers and three passengers escaped uninjured.[167][168]\n\nOn January 10, 2010, United Airlines Flight 634, an Airbus A319, made an emergency landing after the aircraft's right main landing gear failed to deploy. No passengers or crew members were injured during the landing.[169] The aircraft sustained substantial damage in the accident.[170][171]\n\nOn May 1, 2013, Scandinavian Airlines Flight 908, an A330-300 that was cleared for takeoff, collided with an ExpressJet Embraer ERJ-145 aircraft on the taxiway. The ERJ-145 lost its tail in the accident.[172]\n\nOn May 18, 2013, a malfunctioning landing gear forced US Airways Flight 4560, a de Havilland Canada Dash 8-100, to make a belly landing. None of the passengers or crew were injured.[173]\n\nOn March 2, 2019, Southwest Airlines Flight 6, a Boeing 737-700 registration N918WN, struck the tail of Southwest Flight 3133, a Boeing 737-700 parked at Gate A15 bound for Nashville, while taxiing to the runway. The incident is under review and both Southwest planes (N493WN and N918WN) were taken out of service for review. There were no injuries reported.[174]\n\nOn June 15, 2019, United Airlines Flight 627, a Boeing 757-200 registration N26123, suffered fuselage damage on the nose landing gear from a hard landing. The aircraft reportedly skidded to the left side of runway 22L and the left main landing gear veered into the grass. Although no notable injuries were reported, the airport went into a complete ground stop, and flights were diverted to other airports. The Federal Aviation Administration is reviewing the incident.[175]\n\nSee also[]\n\nPage Module:Portal/styles.css has no content.\n\nNew Jersey World War II Army Airfields\n\nReferences[]\n\n[]\n\nPage Module:Side box/styles.css has no content.\n\nPage Module:Side box/styles.css has no content.\n\nNewark Liberty International Airport (official site)\n\n\"World's Busiest Airport\" Popular Mechanics, May 1937\n\nTemplate:HAER\n\nHow To Get To Newark Airport\n\nAviation: From Sand Dunes to Sonic Booms, a National Park Service Discover Our Shared Heritage Travel Itinerary\n\nTemplate:FAA-diagram\n\nResources for this airport:\n\nAirNav airport information for KEWR\n\nASN accident history for EWR\n\nFlightAware airport information and live flight tracker\n\nNOAA/NWS weather observations: current, past three days\n\nSkyVector aeronautical chart for KEWR\n\nFAA current EWR delay information\n\nTemplate:New York City Area Airports\n\nPage Template:Hlist/styles.css must have content model \"Sanitized CSS\" for TemplateStyles (current model is \"wikitext\")."
