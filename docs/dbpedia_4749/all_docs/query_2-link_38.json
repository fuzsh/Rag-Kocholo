        "text": "Car rentals have been consolidated and moved to a new parking deck next to the new Terminal A. If you have landed at Terminal A it is one floor above the arrival level, across the footbridge. From Terminals B and C you will need to take AirTrain to get to Terminal A; from there it is a 5-10 minute walk.\n\nIf you're driving yourself to EWR or getting a friend to drop you off, there are many highways that can get you to the airport. US-1/US-9 (they run concurrent around here) is the highway with immediate access to the road loop that feeds into the airport itself and its parking lots (both short- and long-term) and terminals. Interstate 78 is most useful if you're coming from the east (Jersey City and Manhattan) or west (the North Jersey suburbs) as Exit 57 is dedicated to feeding you directly to the airport entrance. The New Jersey Turnpike funnels traffic to the airport from north and south: from the north driving southbound exit the Turnpike at Exit 14/14A/14B/14C towards I-78 where you will soon reach the previously-mentioned Exit 57; from the south driving northbound Exit 13A will lead you to a short stretch of NJ-81 before leading you to the airport itself, a relatively new construction that eliminates the previous looping onto US-1/US-9 and U-turning before hitting the Turnpike tolls.\n\nThe airport's road access is centered around the elevated loop that funnels drop-off/pick-up traffic for each of the terminals, meaning if you happen to miss your terminal's exit you can loop back around again. Signs listing which airline flies out of each terminal can be seen on the approach, though there's not a lot distance between the signs telling you where the exit to the terminal is and the actual exit. Each terminal has multiple levels to separate drivers picking up arriving passengers (Level 1) from those dropping off departing passengers (Level 2 for Terminals A and B; Terminal C has two departing Levels 2 and 3 with 3 meant for United MileagePlus frequent fliers and business/first class passengers though this isn't really enforced at the curbside). Short-term parking for each of the terminals is also available, though to access them you have to split off from the road before the elevated loop and follow the signs; you can use cash, card, or EZ-Pass to pay.\n\nArrival levels frequently have significant traffic back-ups piling all the way back to the main loop, especially during busy travel periods and times of day (this is more so the case for Terminals B and C; the new Terminal A has more lead-up road length to the curbside entrances). If both you and your friend are in cell phone contact you can try to arrange a pickup at the departure levels instead if those levels are not as busy (for instance, nighttime). The P4 Daily Parking lot station can also be used as an alternative pick-up point as it can be reached by AirTrain -- it normally serves as the pick-up point for hotel shuttles and valet parking, but there's generally less traffic there than in front of the terminals if the arrival is willing to walk a bit.\n\nExiting the airport by car can be a bit tricky as there's not a lot of distance from the signs telling you where each exit leads to and the exits themselves, which may require you to cross several lanes in a short amount of time; add on top of that the fact that the way to re-enter the loop road is in the far left lane which may make for some rather sudden lane-crossings. Be aware of your surroundings as you drive to your exit.\n\nDaily and long-term parking is also available at the airport, accessible via a side road off from the central loop when you have your car and AirTrain or shuttle bus when you don't. Off-site privately-run parking lots are also available -- they operate their own shuttle buses between the lots and the terminals.\n\nBe aware of cars parked on the shoulders of highway exits leading into the airport -- oftentimes drivers who are waiting to pick up their friends from an arriving flight will park there and wait until their friend calls that their plane has landed. This happens for a couple of reasons: short-term parking is pricey ($5.25 per half hour, so it jumps to $10.50 after 31 minutes), and the arrival levels of each terminal are patrolled by the Port Authority Police Department who will regularly ask drivers that aren't actively loading or unloading to move along, which while not the end of the world since a driver can loop around again to get back to their previous spot can be a pain due to heavy traffic backups that happen at busy times. A cell phone lot is available near P4 (Daily Parking) that can hold about 100 cars, but this is a relatively new thing, it's located off of the main loop road after all the terminals, the signs leading to it are not well-marked, and the airport's chronic construction and spaghetti-like road design tends to camouflage it further, which is why you'll still see the previously-mentioned parked cars on shoulders until a PAPD patrol chases them off."
