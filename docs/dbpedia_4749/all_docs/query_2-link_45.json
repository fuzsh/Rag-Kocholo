        "text": "Munich Airport International GmbH (MAI) and its subsidiary, Munich Airport NJ LLC (MANJ), today announced Terminal A at Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) was awarded a 5-Star Airport Terminal Rating from Skytrax, the air travel industry’s premier rating organization. This award represents the world’s highest rating for customer experience within an airport terminal. MAI is a 100 percent subsidiary of Munich Airport, which was the first European Airport to be awarded Skytrax 5-Stars and recently recertified this rating for the fourth time in a row.\n\nThe 5-Star Airport Terminal rating recognizes airport terminals that are providing exceptional standards of facilities and staff service to customers across all front-line areas of the airport environment. To achieve this prestigious rating, the staff service and product standards must be meeting or setting global best practice for the items under evaluation.\n\nJost Lammers, CEO of Munich Airport said, “I am very proud of this prestigious award, which confirms the remarkable performance of our U.S. subsidiary in close cooperation with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ). This makes the Munich Airport Group the first airport operator to run two 5-Star terminal buildings on two continents.”\n\nOpened in January of 2023, the $2.7 billion USD, one million square foot Terminal A at EWR provides 15 million annual customers with a world-class experience. With its spacious interiors, floor-to-ceiling windows, inspiring local public art features, locally inspired restaurants, and small businesses from the surrounding area, the terminal offers a unique ambience across landside and airside areas.\n\n“Being awarded Skytrax 5-Stars is the biggest honor for any airport or terminal,” said Dr. Lutz Weisser, Managing Director of Munich Airport International GmbH. “We have seen Terminal A through its early construction phase and opening and celebrated the one-year anniversary of operations just recently. This award is the reward for the outstanding work of our U.S. team and all our partners: The PANYNJ, the airlines, our concessionaires and everybody else who contributed to this great achievement. It is such a pleasure to see Terminal A blossom to its full extent.”\n\n“We are honored to be recognized as a 5-Star Airport Terminal. This 5-Star rating places Newark Terminal A in a very exclusive club - one of only three 5-Star Airport facilities in North America,” explained Michael Kunz, CEO of Munich Airport NJ LLC, the operator of Newark Terminal A. ‘I would like to express my sincere thanks for the tireless support of our MANJ family, and the thousands of dedicated team members who strive each day to make Newark Terminal A, a very special place to travel through.”\n\nDuring the 3-day Skytrax audit, Terminal A was lauded for its exceptional customer experience offerings. Notable highlights include user-friendly wayfinding and dynamic TSA signage providing queue wait times, a diverse range of top-notch facilities, attractive seating with ample charging options, innovative security screening allowing liquids and electronics to stay in carry-on bags, and a rich selection of local food and retail outlets. Furthermore, Terminal A incorporates digital signage such as the “Digital Journey of Surprises” at key touchpoints throughout the terminal, showcasing the iconic spirit of New Jersey’s people, landmarks, and innovations. The terminal also features a digital Welcome Banner that highlights local art, notable New Jersey Hall of Fame inductees, and must-see venues across the state, creating a sense of place for travelers. A striking \"Forest of Firsts\", comprised of eight towering LED pillars, honoring the state's innovative spirit further enhances the overall passenger experience in Terminal A.\n\nIn addition to the 5-Star rating, Terminal A is the recipient of multiple other awards for excellence including the UNESCO Prix Versailles Award, LEED Gold Certification, and the American Society of Civil Engineers 2023 Project of the Year, among others."
