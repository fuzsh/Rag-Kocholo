        "text": "In determining the best airports for layovers, we prioritized several key stats: food selection, shopping options, price ratings, and lounge and seat availability. The top 10 airports had an average food and beverage choice rating of 3.9 out of 5 stars and an average shop selection rating of 3.9.\n\nGeorge Bush Intercontinental Airport had the highest overall score, leading the rest of the top 10 airports in food and beverage choice rating, shop selection rating and stores per passenger per hour. The Houston hub also had high ratings for food and beverage prices and staff service, along with the maximum rating for ease of WiFi login.\n\nOnly three airports ranked in the top 10 overall and in the top 10 for both frequent fliers and families: George Bush, Washington Dulles International and Seattle-Tacoma International.\n\nBest Airports for Layovers: Frequent Fliers\n\nTo figure out the best airports for layovers for frequent fliers, we analyzed the presence of American Express Centurion Lounges, the general distribution of lounges and other unique amenities available to frequent travelers. Food and beverage also weighed heavily in this category.\n\nGeorge Bush Intercontinental Airport ranked at the top of this list with a high food and beverage choice score and 0.32 lounges per 100 people per hour. Washington Dulles ranked highest in lounge distribution at 0.54 lounges per 100 people per hour, however the lack of a Centurion Lounge is part of what moves the airport to third overall for frequent fliers.\n\nOverall, the top 10 airports for frequent flyers had an average of 0.27 lounges per 100 people per hour, in addition to an average food and beverage choice rating of 3.9 stars and a shop selection rating of 3.8 stars.\n\nBest Airports for Layovers: Families\n\nWhen looking at the best airports for families, we prioritized the distribution of family restrooms and nursing rooms and the number of kid play areas each airport offers. Second to those categories, we prioritized price ratings for food and beverage and seat availability, as families likely need more room than a single flier.\n\nWith those priorities, Detroit ranked as the number one airport for families, surpassing all other airports with five available playrooms. Logan International Airport ranked second, leading other airports with 0.92 family restrooms per 100 people per hour. Salt Lake City has the most nursing rooms per 100 people per hour at 0.44.\n\nFive of the top 10 airports feature shuttles or trains from terminal to terminal, including Detroit Metropolitan Airport, George Bush Intercontinental Airport, Washington Dulles International Airport, Seattle-Tacoma International Airport and San Francisco International Airport. Having access to shuttles or trains can help travelers better navigate airports during a layover, saving transit time between flights."
