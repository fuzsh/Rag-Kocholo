        "text": "John F. Kennedy International Airport LaGuardia Airport Newark Liberty International Airport Public transit LIRR + AirTrain, subway + AirTrain Bus Train + AirTrain Driving time to/from Manhattan 30 to 90 minutes 30 minutes to an hour 30 minutes to two hours Taxi cost $70 flat rate to or from Manhattan + any taxes, tolls, and tips $30 to $45 + tip $50 to $70 or more + tip Airlines More than 70, mostly international Eight, mostly domestic More than 30 domestic and international Amenities Fast food and sit-down restaurants, and lounges for Virgin Atlantic, Alaska Airlines, Delta, Emirates, and others Fast food and sit-down restaurants, a Delta lounge Fast food, sit-down restaurants, and lounges for United, British Airways, Delta, and Virgin Atlantic\n\nJohn F. Kennedy International Airport\n\nNYC's main airport, John F. Kennedy International, is in Queens. It's the largest and busiest of the three major airports serving the city, seeing more than 55 million passengers per year.\n\nIf you're staying in Brooklyn south of Williamsburg or in eastern Queens, JFK will be your closest airport. New York's most famous gateway is a preferred choice for many travelers because of its lounges, shops, and dining options.\n\nAirlines and Destinations\n\nMore than 70 airlines fly in and out of JFK, and most of them are international: Singapore Airlines, Korean Air, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Air France, Finnair, and EgyptAir, to mention a few. You can catch a direct flight from JFK to cities across the world, from Buenos Aires to Reykjavik. Of course, major U.S.-based carriers American, Delta, and JetBlue use JFK as a hub. The airport's entire Terminal 5 is operated by JetBlue.\n\nAirport Amenities\n\nJFK is in the midst of a $19-billion renovation, which will add two new terminals and is expected to be completed in 2030. The project also includes modernizing existing terminals, which might affect hours and operations at restaurants and shops throughout. Popular places to eat are Terminal 1's Jikji Cafe for quick Asian-inspired bites, Terminal 4's Blue Point Brewing Company for a sit-down meal and beers, and an outpost of Artichoke Basille's Pizza in Terminal 5.\n\nJFK has a Virgin Atlantic Clubhouse and lounges for Aer Lingus, Air France, Air India, Alaska Airlines, Delta, Emirates, and Lufthansa.\n\nGetting to and From JFK\n\nJFK is relatively easy to access on public transportation. The fastest way to get there is by taking the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) to Jamaica from Penn Station in Manhattan or Atlantic Terminal in Brooklyn. A one-way trip costs $5 off-peak and $7 during peak hours. From Jamaica, take the AirTrain to your terminal. This airport shuttle costs $8.25 to ride to or from Jamaica or Howard Beach stations, but it's free to use between terminals.\n\nThough not as fast, taking the subway is cheaper. Pay $2.90 to ride the E, J, or Z train to Jamaica, then transfer to the AirTrain to get to your terminal. Alternatively, take the A train to Howard Beach and catch the AirTrain from there. Traveling from Manhattan to the airport by subway takes an hour or more, depending on where you start.\n\nTaking a taxi between JFK and anywhere in Manhattan, in either direction, costs a flat rate of $70 plus taxes, tolls, and tip. There's a $5 surcharge during peak hours. If you opt to take an Uber or a Lyft into the city instead, you can meet your driver in the pickup line outside of arrivals. Driving time between JFK and Manhattan typically takes 30 to 90 minutes, depending on traffic.\n\nLaGuardia Airport\n\nLaGuardia is the smallest of the NYC area's three major airports but has been called the most efficient in the world. It's located in Queens, about 10 miles north of JFK, and is most accessible from Queens, Manhattan's Upper East Side, the Bronx, and northern Brooklyn.\n\nAirlines and Destinations\n\nLGA is a popular option for domestic travelers. Eight carriers — United, American, Delta, Air Canada, Frontier, Southwest, Spirit, and JetBlue — fly direct to cities across the U.S., plus Canada, Aruba, the Bahamas, and Bermuda. LaGuardia is the only NYC-area stop for the Delta Shuttle, which runs to Boston, Chicago, and Washington, D.C.\n\nAirport Amenities\n\nLaGuardia used to catch a lot of flack for its subpar facilities. Now, after a years-long renovation, LGA is broadly perceived as one of the best. Terminals B and C received a complete overhaul. After it reopened in 2020, Terminal B was even named the best new airport in the world at UNESCO's Prix Versailles awards. These terminals are where you'll find the best eats, including Shake Shack, Bubby's, Dos Toros Taqueria, Zaro's Family Bakery, and other New York favorites. Terminal C also houses the Delta lounge, the only airline lounge at LGA.\n\nTerminal A is an outlier, better known as a piece of art and history than for its amenities. Also known as the Marine Air Terminal, this funky art deco building was once used for seaplanes and contains a spectacular WPA mural in its rotunda. The only airlines flying out of Terminal A are Spirit and Frontier.\n\nGetting to and From LGA\n\nThere's no subway or train stop at LaGuardia Airport, so getting there on public transit includes a leg of bus travel. First, take an E, F, M, R train to Jackson Heights-Roosevelt Avenue or the 7 to 74th St-Broadway, then hop on the free Q70-SBS LaGuardia Link, which stops at terminals B and C. There's a complimentary shuttle that will get you to Terminal A, if needed. If you're traveling to or from uptown Manhattan, the M60-SBS bus, which stops on Harlem's 125th Street outside the 4, 5, 6 line station at Lexington Avenue, is your route. A one-way trip costs $2.90.\n\nTaking a taxi to Manhattan from the airport (or vice versa) costs about $30 to $45 plus tolls and tip. If you're traveling at rush hour, the meter will probably soar well above that price bracket. Similarly, Uber and Lyft pricing will increase during peak times. LaGuardia has designated pickup areas for rideshare services at each terminal.\n\nNewark Liberty International Airport\n\nNewark Liberty International serves about 44 million passengers per year. The west side is its easiest access point, but traveling between EWR and other hoods like Queens and Brooklyn can be pricey and time-consuming.\n\nAirlines and Destinations\n\nMore than 30 airlines fly in and out of EWR, including more than a dozen international carriers. United claims the airport as one of its major hubs. Other airlines include American Airlines, Air Canada, Alaska Airlines, Delta, JetBlue, British Airways, Emirates, Spirit, and TAP Air Portugal. You can get to cities like San Juan, London, Tokyo, Dubai, and Berlin on direct flights.\n\nAirport Amenities\n\nEach terminal has a food court, and Terminal C's is arguably the best. Order an Italian deli sandwich from Casiano's, dim sum from Wabi Sabi, or ramen from Kaedama while you wait for your flight. At the recently renovated Terminal A, you can get a classic NYC bagel from Ess-a-Bagel or an organic chocolate chip cookie from Jersey favorite Bang Cookies.\n\nUnited, British Airways, Delta, Lufthansa, Scandinavian Airlines, and Virgin Atlantic have lounges at EWR.\n\nGetting to and From EWR\n\nNJ Transit's Northeast Corridor and North Jersey Coast lines provide transportation between midtown Manhattan and Newark Airport Station, which connects to EWR via the AirTrain. The whole trip takes about 50 minutes and costs $15.75 for a trip in either direction. The Coach USA Newark Airport Express bus service also runs between midtown Manhattan and all EWR terminals. It costs $33 for a round-trip fare or $18.70 for a one-way ticket.
