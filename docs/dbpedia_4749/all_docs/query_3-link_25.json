        "text": "Skip the traffic, tolls, and taxis with NJ TRANSIT service to and from Newark Liberty International Airport.\n\nTRAIN SERVICE\n\nTwo NJ TRANSIT train lines serve Newark Airport. Northeast Corridor trains provide service to New York, Trenton and intermediate points. North Jersey Coast Line trains provide service to New York, Long Branch and intermediate points. You can connect at Newark Penn Station or Secaucus Junction for other destinations in New Jersey. At least six NJ TRANSIT trains stop every hour at the Newark Liberty International Airport Station between 6 a.m. and 9 p.m. weekdays. Four trains stop every hour between 9 p.m. and midnight. Trains that stop at the airport are designated with an airplane or \"EWR\" on departure boards.\n\nTrip Planner\n\nWhen you purchase your NJ TRANSIT ticket to or from Newark Airport through the NJ TRANSIT Mobile App, Web Ticketing or ticket vending machines, the AirTrain access fee ($8.50) is already included in the price - one ticket does it all. Download the NJ TRANSIT Mobile App now:\n\nTravel Tips\n\nPurchase your round-trip tickets in advance through the NJ TRANSIT Mobile App or Web Ticketing to avoid lines.\n\nKeep your ticket with you when you leave the train because you will need it to pass through the fare gates. Otherwise, you will be charged the AirTrain access fee.\n\nAllow about 15 minutes to travel via AirTrain between the train station and your airport terminal.\n\nIf possible, plan to travel during off-peak hours or on weekends, especially if you are traveling with children. (Peak hours are weekdays between 7-9 a.m. and 4-7 p.m.)\n\nTravel light. Available space for luggage is limited.\n\nIf your flight arrives after the Newark Liberty International Airport Station has closed for the evening, you will need to take alternate ground transportation to your final destination.\n\nRidesharing (Uber/Lyft/Taxi): Ridesharing services are not available directly at Newark Liberty International Airport Station. For Uber, Lyft, or taxi services, please proceed to Newark Penn Station or North Elizabeth Station, accessible via our train services. Rideshares can also be hailed from Parking Garage P4.\n\nTicket and Fare Information\n\nNJ TRANSIT fares to the Newark Liberty International Airport Station are based on distance traveled.\n\nTickets to or from the Airport have barcodes and allow you to pass through the fare gates at the airport rail station. Simply scan the barcode at the fare gate, wait for the partition to open and walk through.\n\nTickets may be purchased from the NJ TRANSIT Mobile App, Web Ticketing ticket vending machines or ticket agents at your boarding station. Customers boarding without tickets will be charged the regular fare to Newark Penn Station or North Elizabeth (depending on direction traveled) plus surcharge. Upon arrival at the Airport station, you will be required to pay the $8.50 access fee. This fee can be paid by tapping a contactless payment card or mobile wallet at the faregate. Conductors can accept cash only (all bills up to $100). Complete fare details, including Senior Citizen and Children's fare information can be found in results from the Trip Planner.\n\nOne-Way Tickets can be used on any train for one continuous ride between designated stations. If you are traveling to the airport and plan to return via AirTrain and NJ TRANSIT, we recommend that you purchase two one-way tickets prior to departing from your boarding station.\n\nMonthly Passes save you approximately 30 percent compared to regular one-way fares and are valid for unlimited trips throughout the calendar month.\n\nOnly monthly passes purchased with the Newark International Airport Station as the origin or destination will allow passage through the fare gate. If your monthly pass is for a destination other than the airport, you will be required to pay an access fee to pass through the station. See the Station Information section for ticket purchase locations.\n\nAirport Employees: If you work at the airport and plan to take NJ TRANSIT service regularly, we recommend that you purchase a monthly pass. The airport access fee is not charged on monthly rail passes with the airport as the origin or destination.\n\nAccessibility\n\nThe Newark Liberty International Airport Station and AirTrain system are fully ADA accessible, and are equipped with escalators, elevators, and stairs.\n\nTo find out if the station you plan to travel from is accessible to customers using mobility devices, refer to the station information page and look for the international symbol of accessibility.\n\nFor assistance getting on and off the train, please inform your train crew. Be aware that train crews will not be available to assist with transporting luggage on or off the train.\n\nIf you are traveling to New York, inform train personnel if you need to use an elevator upon arrival. When departing from New York, visit the NJ TRANSIT or Amtrak Customer Service Office to help you determine which elevator to use to access your connecting train.\n\nBUS SERVICE\n\nNJ TRANSIT also operates the following bus service to Newark Airport:\n\n62 Bus – Frequent service from Newark Penn Station (Raymond Boulevard Bus Lanes, Gate 3A during the day, Gate 2A after 10pm) and Elizabeth\n\n37 Bus – Maplewood, Irvington and Newark\n\nGO 28 – Bloomfield and Newark\n\n67 Bus - Brick, Lakewood, Howell, Freehold, Manalapan, Marlboro, Old Bridge, Jersey City and Newark\n\nPlease note: Exact Fares are required to board these buses.\n\nTrip Planner"
