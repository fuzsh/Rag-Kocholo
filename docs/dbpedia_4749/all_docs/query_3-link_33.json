The prestigious international industry honor comes a month after Skytrax gave Terminal A its highest rating, five stars, following a detailed audit of the terminal’s facilities, operations and customer service in 2023.\n\nThe Skytrax honor is considered a global benchmark of airport facility excellence, following the results of comprehensive surveys taken between August 2023 and March 2024 from passengers worldwide that evaluated traveler experiences regarding airport facilities, staff service and customer experience ranging from check-in, arrivals, transfers, shopping, security and immigration through departure at the gate. Newark Liberty is the second Port Authority airport in just two years to receive Skytrax’s highest honor for airport terminals: LaGuardia Airport’s Terminal B was named the world’s best airport terminal in 2023 and was also rated five stars by Skytrax.\n\nNewark Liberty’s latest Skytrax honor was announced at the 2024 Skytrax World Airport Awards held last week at the Passenger Terminal Expo & Conference in Frankfurt, Germany, which was attended by Port Authority Chairman Kevin O’Toole; James Heitmann, the agency’s chief operating officer; Jacquelene McCarthy, the agency’s director of aviation redevelopment; and Frank Radics, the Port Authority’s aviation operational standards and compliance general manager. The annual ceremony is known within the international aviation industry as the industry’s equivalent of filmmaking’s Academy Awards.\n\n“This is a tremendously well-deserved honor for the flagship of the Port Authority’s ongoing renaissance at Newark Liberty International Airport,” said N.J. Gov. Phil Murphy. “It’s no surprise that the industry’s leader has bestowed one of its highest honors on this facility. From the distinctly Jersey aesthetic to the first-rate amenities and home-grown attractions, Terminal A is a point of pride for the Garden State that the whole world now gets to enjoy.”\n\n“We believe strongly that our region deserves nothing but the best, and Newark Liberty has delivered the best new facility in the world for the state of New Jersey,” said Port Authority Chairman Kevin O’Toole. “As a native New Jerseyan, I am incredibly proud that passengers selected Terminal A for this global recognition, and I was honored to join the distinguished Port Authority team who accepted Newark Liberty’s award for the world’s best new airport terminal from Skytrax last week in Germany.”\n\n“From Newark to LaGuardia, and from worst to best, our $30 billion redevelopment of the New York-New Jersey area’s major airports has truly transformed air travel for the millions of people who use our airports,” said Port Authority Executive Director Rick Cotton. “Our work at the airports reflects best-in-class standards, and we are extremely gratified by the international aviation industry’s recognition that this region is home to two of the world’s best new airport terminals.”\n\n“It’s a tremendous honor to see this prestigious award for best new airport terminal in the world go to Newark Liberty’s spectacular new Terminal A,” said Elizabeth Mayor and Port Authority Commissioner J. Christian Bollwage. “This international recognition means the world to this region, to New Jersey, and to communities like the city of Elizabeth that contribute to the airport every single day.”\n\nThe $2.7 billion Terminal A represented both the Port Authority’s largest single investment in New Jersey and the state’s largest design-build project. The terminal opened in phases throughout 2023 as operations migrated from the 50-year-old former Terminal A. Within its first year of service, the terminal served 15 million passengers, greatly outperforming yearly passenger totals from the previous Terminal A.\n\nThe new 1 million-square-foot Terminal A features state-of-the-art passenger amenities, local artwork, a children’s play space, digital technology and dozens of local and national dining and retail options. Other unique passenger amenities include a sensory room that offers neurodivergent travelers and their families a calm space away from the bustle of the airport, and a children’s lending library curated by a local fifth grader.\n\n“Proud to see the Port of Authority of New York and New Jersey set a new standard with the new best-in-class Terminal A,” said U.S. Rep. Robert J. Menendez of New Jersey. “This transformation elevates the travel experience for millions of travelers and is a testament to our region’s commitment to innovation and progress, as well as to our local artists and business owners who are an integral part of this incredible facility.”\n\n“This is a proud honor for the Port Authority and the state of New Jersey that showcases the fact that Newark Liberty International Airport is a world-class facility that serves the transportation needs of the entire region,” said New Jersey State Senate President Nick Scutari. “The modernization of Terminal A is part of a vision that makes use of a meaningful investment in the largest design-build project in New Jersey. This state-of-the-art facility contributes to our economy and provides a quality experience for passengers.”\n\n“Thanks to the dedication and ambition of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, passengers and aviation industry leaders agree that the new Terminal A at Newark Liberty International Airport is a top-rated, world-renowned facility,” said New Jersey State Senate Majority Leader M. Teresa Ruiz. “Part of this success is from the inclusion of local vendors and art in Terminal A, which celebrates Newark and New Jersey and gives visitors a taste of our unique culture. I am thrilled to see this honor bestowed upon my district’s airport and look forward to the continued transformation of our region’s transportation infrastructure so that we can deliver more high-quality travel experiences that represent all of what New Jersey has to offer.”\n\n“Congratulations to the Port Authority, the design and construction teams, and all the hardworking men and women who deliver world-class service day-in day-out for this global hub,” said New Jersey State General Assembly Speaker Craig J. Coughlin. “The Terminal A project has been transformative for travelers and our economy. With an anticipated growth in demand, investments in our transportation infrastructure pay dividends for generations to come, especially when they are implemented with quality of this caliber.”\n\n“I am delighted to celebrate the recognition of Newark Liberty International Airport’s Terminal A as the world’s best new airport terminal,” said New Jersey State General Assembly Deputy Speaker Shanique Speight. “This honor is considered a global benchmark of airport facility excellence. This accolade is not just a win for our airport but a triumph for Newark and New Jersey, offering our citizens access to top-notch airport facilities and services. This is a proud moment that highlights our commitment to providing world-class experiences.”\n\n“I congratulate Port Authority and Newark Airport for Terminal A’s designation as the world’s best new airport terminal by Skytrax,” said New Jersey State Sen. Joseph Cryan. “This prestigious and well-deserved recognition will only serve to benefit our local economy, bringing more jobs and visitors to the region overall.”\n\n“Whereas the Skytrax five stars are the result of a comprehensive audit by experts, the World Airport Awards are based on actual passenger opinions,” said Dr. Lutz Weisser, managing director of Munich Airport International, the parent company of Terminal A’s operator Munich Airport NJ LLC. “Seeing that Terminal A is not only convincing auditors but is also loved by passengers shows us that we have managed to create an extraordinary travel experience at Terminal A. I am tremendously proud of the whole team who excels passenger expectations every day. The dedicated work of everybody at Terminal A and all our partners and concessionaires made this prestigious award possible.”\n\n“It’s an amazing accomplishment to be named the best new terminal in the world,” said Michael Kunz, CEO of Munich Airport NJ LLC. “We are so incredibly proud of this milestone for Terminal A and for Munich Airport NJ. It is the pinnacle of achievement in both customer experience and the result of years of planning and tireless dedication to the program. This recognition comes with a solemn responsibility associated with maintaining a world-class standard of customer service and terminal operations.”\n\n“This award covers new airport terminals that have opened in the previous 18 months of the 2024 World Airport Awards, and covers the full range of airport facilities, staff services and customer experience evaluation,” said Edward Plaisted, CEO of Skytrax. “It is pleasing to see such a high standard being delivered here at Terminal A, which is very worthy of their award as the world’s best new airport terminal.”\n\nIn addition to the facility’s best new terminal award and five-star rating, the terminal has collected myriad other awards and recognitions. Terminal A was awarded a 2023 United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Prix Versailles Special Prize for the terminal’s exterior, a design that reflects the building’s distinctive architecture emphasizing spaciousness, functionality and abundant natural light. The terminal also received LEED gold certification from the U.S. Green Building Council, the most widely used green-building rating system in the world and an international symbol of environmental responsibility. In 2023, the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) in New Jersey named Terminal A as its 2023 Project of the Year.\n\nAbout the Newark Liberty International Airport redevelopment\n\nThe Port Authority is redeveloping the entire Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR), beginning with Terminal A – the centerpiece of an airport-wide renaissance designed to establish the airport as a world-class gateway for the New Jersey and New York region. Planning work to replace the airport’s existing mass transit system, AirTrain Newark, with a modern, reliable 2.5-mile automated people mover train system is underway. In December 2023, the first contract in a multi-phase procurement process was awarded to Doppelmayr, a leader in cable-propelled transport systems.\n\nAdditionally, the Port Authority is adding local access to the airport and New York City by increasing public transit access through the EWR Station Access Project. The new accessible facility will provide easy access for underserved communities in Newark and Elizabeth to New York Penn Station via Amtrak and NJ TRANSIT’s direct Northeast Corridor service, decreasing the current journey time from 40 minutes to under 10 minutes. Most recently, the agency’s Board of Commissioners approved $160 million for the design and construction of the project.\n\nThe next phase of the Port Authority’s transformation of Newark Liberty International Airport will be developed through the work of a world-class airport master planner selected by the agency. The EWR Vision Plan — which will serve as a framework for future development through 2065 – will incorporate plans for long-term economic growth, sustainability projects, and multimodal access to the airport for both work and travel.

The project will greatly improve transit accessibility for underserved Newark and Elizabeth neighborhoods, enabling far easier commutes and streamlined airport access.\n\nThe project will include an extension of the existing pedestrian bridge over station platforms and tracks to a new public access area off Frelinghuysen Avenue. The public access area will include a pick-up/drop-off point for private vehicles, taxis, buses, and for-hire vehicles, along with bicyclist and pedestrian access. Construction is expected to be completed in 2026.\n\nThe new facility will transform transit access for residents of North Elizabeth and Newark’s South Ward. Transit trips to both Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) and Newark Penn Station will take under 10 minutes with the new facility. Currently, the same journey via existing transit options from these neighborhoods can take 40 minutes. The project will also improve connections to PATH train service from Newark Penn Station for access to job centers in Jersey City and Manhattan, while spurring transit-oriented development around the rail station serving the airport, consistent with local community-driven planning efforts.\n\nCurrently, accessing the airport for travel or employment is unnecessarily difficult for these neighborhoods, typically requiring a private vehicle or lengthy public transit trip despite close proximity to the AirTrain.\n\n“My administration is proud to partner with the Port Authority on the latest component in the ambitious plan to transform Newark Airport into a modern, world-class gateway,” said Governor Phil Murphy. “This latest project will be a crucial bridge – literally and figuratively – for local residents, many of whom help power one of the world’s busiest airports. An extended pedestrian bridge will provide access to multiple modes of transportation, cutting down travel time significantly, and providing greater and easier access not only to multiple modes of transportation, but to a world of opportunities.”\n\n“This is a true example of how transit access can transform a community,” said Port Authority Chairman Kevin O’Toole. “This project will fill in a critical link that had been missing for too long in the South Ward and North Elizabeth, giving residents in these previously underserved neighborhoods far easier access not just to Newark Airport, but to our regional transit system and all the opportunities that come with it.”\n\n“This project represents the Port Authority at its best – breaking down barriers and expanding economic opportunity all around our facilities,” said Port Authority Executive Director Rick Cotton. “Transit access is proven to be a game changer – expanding job options, shortening commutes, and promoting sustainability. We’re proud to help deliver those opportunities to these Newark and Elizabeth neighborhoods.”\n\nThe project scope includes a westward extension of the rail station’s existing above-grade pedestrian bridge to a new public access facility built off of Frelinghuysen Avenue. The new facility will provide elevators and escalators between the bridge and street level. It will be ADA-accessible and will display real-time bus and train arrival information alongside ticket vending machines.\n\nThe new public access area will provide accessibility for pedestrians and bicyclists. Dedicated lanes will allow for streamlined pick-up/drop-off access for buses, private vehicles, taxis, and for-hire vehicles. The 16,350 square-foot facility will also include a cellphone lot for private vehicles.\n\nThe project is anticipated to generate 1,380 total job-years directly and indirectly, $125 million in direct wages, and nearly $300 million in economic activity over the life of the project. The Board of Commissioners voted on Thursday, March 21, to advance the design and construction of the project. The Port Authority previously authorized funding for project design work in March 2023.\n\nEWR access has been a vocal request of community members for many years, most recently expressed during the agency’s EWR Vision Plan community outreach sessions. The plan will serve as a framework for future development through 2065 and makes recommendations for both short- and long-term projects while emphasizing Newark Airport as a world-class gateway for New Jersey.\n\nThe Port Authority’s planning efforts have included significant community engagement, which will continue through future phases of the project. A town hall-style event was held in Newark’s South Ward in October 2023. Extensive governmental outreach has also been conducted with the state of New Jersey, the cities of Newark and Elizabeth, and local elected officials. The agency has also coordinated with regional transportation and technical partners, including NJ TRANSIT, Amtrak, the New Jersey Department of Transportation, the Federal Aviation Administration, and PSE&G.\n\nCommunity outreach will continue through the project’s final design and construction phases. This will include direct outreach to civic organizations, additional town hall meetings in the local area prior to the start of construction, and periodic status updates throughout construction.\n\nNEWARK LIBERTY INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT’S NEW TERMINAL A AWARDED PRESTIGIOUS FIVE-STAR RATING FROM PREEMINENT GLOBAL AIRPORT EVALUATION FIRM SKYTRAX\n\nMarch 19, 2024\n\nFive-Star Rating Awarded After Detailed Audit of Airport Terminal’s Customer Service and Front-Line Operations\n\nWith LaGuardia’s Terminal B, New York-New Jersey Region Now Home to North America’s Two Five-Star Airport Terminals\n\nOnly Three Airports or Airport Terminals in North America Have Five-Star Ratings from Skytrax, Two are Port Authority Airport Facilities\n\nOutstanding Evaluation Builds on Terminal A’s Growing List of Accolades, including UNESCO Prix Versailles Special Prize and Project of the Year Award from American Society of Civil Engineers New Jersey Chapter\n\nPhotos of Terminal A are Available Here\n\nThe Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and Munich Airport NJ LLC, the operator of Newark Liberty International Airport’s new Terminal A, announced today that Terminal A was given a prestigious five-star rating by Skytrax, the preeminent aviation industry ratings firm. The rating was awarded following a detailed audit of the terminal’s facilities, operations, and provision of customer service.\n\nThe coveted rating confirms Terminal A’s outstanding world-class quality. Completed in 2023, Terminal A now joins LaGuardia Airport’s Terminal B as the only two airport terminals in North America awarded the highest rating by Skytrax.\n\nThe Skytrax ratings are considered a global benchmark of airport excellence, based on a detailed audit and an assessment of an airport’s product and front-line service standards. The five-star terminal rating recognizes airport terminals that provide exceptional standards of facilities and staff service to customers across all front-line areas of the airport environment.\n\n“Five stars are reserved for the best of the best, but we expected nothing less for Newark’s Terminal A,” said Port Authority Chairman Kevin O’Toole. “We set out to raise the bar with Terminal A, from its soaring architecture to its streamlined design to its engaging local art. This stellar evaluation from the aviation industry’s preeminent rating organization proves we’ve accomplished exactly that, giving New Jersey a magnificent gateway that is taking its rightful place among the world’s best.”\n\n“This rating from Skytrax puts Newark’s Terminal A in rarified air,” said Port Authority Executive Director Rick Cotton. “Skytrax has awarded five stars to just three airports or airport terminals in North America, and our facilities account for two of them – LaGuardia’s Terminal B and Newark’s Terminal A. We’re delivering world-class facilities that befit this world-class region, and we’re proud to add this Skytrax rating as the latest validation of our effort.”\n\nThe 1 million-square-foot Terminal A opened in phases throughout 2023 as airport operations migrated from the 50-year-old former Terminal A. The $2.7 billion project represented both the Port Authority’s largest ever single investment in New Jersey and the state’s largest design-build project.

I would like to express my sincere thanks for the tireless support of our MANJ family, and the thousands of dedicated team members who strive each day to make Newark Terminal A a very special place to travel through.”\n\n“This five-star airport terminal rating is a fabulous achievement for Terminal A at Newark Liberty International Airport, being just one of 22 airports and terminals worldwide and one of only three in North America to achieve our highest five-star rating,” said Edward Plaisted of Skytrax. “Terminal A at Newark Liberty International Airport provides an excellent range of passenger facilities, easy customer wayfinding, excellent signage and high standards of staff service. The outstanding multimedia features offer a unique, differentiating factor here at Terminal A.”\n\nBeyond the prestigious Skytrax rating, the terminal has collected a multitude of other awards and recognitions since its opening. Terminal A was awarded a 2023 United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Prix Versailles Special Prize for the terminal’s exterior, reflecting the building’s distinctive architecture that emphasizes spaciousness, functionality and abundant natural light. Additionally, the terminal received LEED gold certification from the U.S. Green Building Council, the most widely used green-building rating system in the world and an international symbol of environmental responsibility.

More than 113,000 flights arrived or departed from the terminal in its first year, with 6.4 million bags processed. The terminal so far has created 2,500 direct jobs, with an economic impact of $4.6 billion across the region.\n\nThe new terminal, which is 20 percent larger than the one it replaced, increased total air traveler volumes at Newark Liberty by 6 percent over the previous record high set in 2019 and approximately 12 percent over total passenger levels in 2022. Designed as a common-use terminal, the new terminal’s 33 gates are utilized by multiple carriers to increase flexibility, efficiency and optimize operations.\n\nSince its opening in January 2023, the terminal has collected prestigious awards and recognitions. In December, Terminal A was awarded a 2023 United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Prix Versailles Special Prize for the terminal’s exterior, reflecting the building’s distinctive architecture that emphasizes spaciousness, functionality and abundant natural light. Terminal A also was named as one of three finalists for “Best New Terminal in the World” as part of Skytrax’s World Airport Awards, which are widely regarded as a quality benchmark for the global aviation industry. Additionally, the terminal received LEED gold certification from the U.S. Green Building Council, the most widely used green-building rating system in the world and an international symbol of environmental responsibility. Terminal A was also named the 2023 Project of the Year by the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) in New Jersey.\n\n“Beyond its distinguished architecture, operational efficiency and top-tier customer amenities, we’re gratified to see that one year in, Terminal A has also given New Jersey an economic shot in the arm,” said Port Authority Chairman Kevin O’Toole. “This terminal supports thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in economic activity, and most importantly, it gives New Jersey a world-class gateway it can proudly show off to the world.”\n\n“The first year of Newark’s Terminal A has been a resounding success almost beyond our wildest expectations, shattering passenger volume records and collecting an eye-popping array of awards and recognitions, as LaGuardia has done before it,” said Port Authority Executive Director Rick Cotton. “This new terminal reflects our agency’s high standards for best-in-class design and customer experience as we continue our historic $30 billion airport redevelopment work across New Jersey and New York.”\n\n“Terminal A is an economic engine for the City of Elizabeth from increasing parking revenues to increasing hotel rooms and jobs for our residents,” said J. Christian Bollwage, mayor of Elizabeth, N.J. “Ancillary employment in hospitality, service industry and car rentals employ many from Elizabeth.”\n\n“Since its opening, Terminal A has exceeded expectations in terms of passenger growth and operational excellence. The close cooperation with our partners, the airlines and the Port Authority, has made this possible,” said Jost Lammers, CEO of Munich Airport. “I am proud that our Munich Airport International (MAI) and our Munich Airport NJ LLC (MANJ) teams contributed considerably to ensuring smooth operations and enhancing the passenger experience, which has received great feedback.”\n\n“We want to thank the entire Terminal A community for a great first year of operations,” said Michael Kunz, CEO of Munich Airport NJ LLC, the operator of Terminal A. “MANJ has enjoyed a front-row seat to the planning, construction, implementation of art and amenities, and the daily operations of this world-class facility. It has been a great honor to partner with the Port Authority, the airlines, and all the terminal stakeholders in creating an amazing experience for the 15 million passengers travelling through Terminal A last year, and we look forward to building on these successes and partnerships well into the future.”\n\nThe 1 million-square-foot Terminal A opened in phases throughout 2023 as airport operations migrated from the 40-year-old former Terminal A. The facility features state-of-the-art passenger amenities, local artwork, children’s play space, digital technology and dozens of local dining and retail options. The $2.7 billion project represented both the Port Authority’s largest ever single investment in New Jersey and the state’s largest design-build project. The new terminal became fully operational in September with all 33 gates in use when Delta Air Lines added their five gates, joining Air Canada, American Airlines, United Airlines and JetBlue.\n\nFor customers, the new Terminal A offers a distinctive sense of place by showcasing an innovative public art program of 29 local artists with exhibits that place New Jersey culture front and center. The terminal’s Jersey-centric vibe extends to the terminal’s dining and retail options, with a total of 54 establishments that include six locally owned and operated concessionaires from Newark, Elizabeth, and Jersey City.\n\nThe terminal features an ever-growing slate of passenger-friendly amenities, such as a brand-new sensory room that offers travelers with disabilities and their families a calm space away from the bustle of the airport. The room has soft lighting, comfortable seating and a tactile-based activity area, all designed in consultation with the Anderson Center for Autism. Travelers with special needs can be accommodated in the space through a partnership with the Transportation Security Administration’s TSA Cares program to assist people who would benefit from extra help navigating security checkpoints. A second sensory room past airport security is currently under construction.\n\nTerminal A offers several family-friendly features, including a children’s lending library and a play area with a track and ropes course. The terminal also features 12 family and four nursing suites, as well as an outdoor pet relief area and indoor Service Animal Relief Areas (SARAs). More amenities are forthcoming, including a multifaith space where travelers can spend time in contemplation or prayer; a business center, and an accessibility room with an adult changing table. American Express is building a 17,000-square-foot Centurion Lounge that will open in 2026.\n\nOutside of Terminal A, rental car operations are streamlined with a new consolidated rent-a-car (ConRAC) facility co-located within the Parking A garage. The new facility, which opened in November, houses all of the airport’s rental car companies and includes 54 fueling stations and 12 car washes, along with vacuum systems, waste management and service bays.\n\n“Congratulations to the Port Authority, the rental car industry, our funding partners Related Fund Management and Fengate Asset Management and project team Austin VRH and PGAL on bringing the consolidated rental car facility at Newark Liberty International Airport to fruition,” said Michael Minerva, CEO of Conrac Solutions. “We are excited to have been part of delivering this customer service enhancement with no use of taxpayer dollars and contributing to the new Terminal A at Newark Liberty International Airport.”\n\nThe building that houses the terminal’s new parking facility and consolidated rental car center is powered by a 5-megawatt (MW) solar rooftop, the largest single solar rooftop project at any U.S. airport. The parking garage features more than 150 electric vehicle chargers and over 2,700 public parking spaces.\n\nAbout the Newark Liberty International Airport redevelopment\n\nThe Port Authority has embarked on a complete redevelopment of Newark Liberty International Airport that began with the opening of Terminal A – the centerpiece of an airport-wide renaissance designed to establish the airport as a world-class gateway for the New Jersey and New York region.\n\nThe Port Authority is actively moving forward on a full replacement of Newark Liberty’s outdated AirTrain system with a modern, reliable 2.5-mile automated people mover train system. The first contract in a multi-phase procurement process was awarded in December to Doppelmayr, a market leader in cable-propelled transport systems. The new system is expected to open in 2029.\n\nAdditionally, the Port Authority Board of Commissioners has authorized $12 million for the planning and preliminary design of the EWR Station Access Project, which is expected to increase public transit access to Newark Liberty International Airport and New York City for underserved communities in Newark and Elizabeth, including easy access for residents of these communities to New York Penn Station’s Moynihan Train Hall and on Amtrak and NJ TRANSIT direct Northeast Corridor services.\n\nThe next phase of the Port Authority’s ongoing transformation of Newark Liberty International Airport will be developed through the work of a world-class airport master planner selected by the agency.

The prestigious global architecture and design award underscores the agency’s comprehensive efforts to transform its outdated airports into modern 21st century facilities that are worthy of both industry and global recognition.\n\nThe Prix Versailles award, established in 2015, aims to highlight “intelligent sustainability” as a cultural driver, touching on every aspect of the built environment. Recipients, as cited by UNESCO, are selected for the “qualities of innovation, creativity, reflection of local, natural and cultural heritage, and ecological efficiency, as well as the values of social interaction and participation which the United Nations holds in high regard.” Terminal A was selected for a special prize from among six nominees across three continents in the airports category. LaGuardia Airport’s Terminal B received the 2021 Prix Versailles award for best new airport.\n\n“We’re gratified that industry and design experts agree with what the New Jersey/New York region already knows: our reimagined airports are among the world’s best, thanks to the ambitious goals and tireless work of the Port Authority and our partners,” said Port Authority Chairman Kevin O’Toole. “We’re pleased to see this distinguished panel agree that Terminal A’s distinctive architecture, intuitive engineering and sustainable design work in concert for an airport experience that’s among the best in the world.”\n\n“Newark Liberty’s Terminal A is the embodiment of our commitment to offer a top-tier customer experience from curb to gate, with a New Jersey sense of place and world-class amenities in an extraordinary space that offers a fitting welcome to the region,” said Port Authority Executive Director Rick Cotton. “We’re immensely proud to add another accolade just two years after our last Prix Versailles win for LaGuardia’s Terminal B, and we expect more to come as our $30 billion airport redevelopment work continues.”\n\nNewark Liberty’s Terminal A features a sleek, modern design that evokes New Jersey’s identity as the Garden State through several diamond-shaped skylights and floor-to-ceiling windows. The distinctive architecture emphasizes spaciousness and functionality that offers travelers uninterrupted sightlines and abundant natural light. The design works in combination with state-of-the-art digital technology and modern amenities to create an intuitive and comfortable passenger experience.\n\nOpened in early 2023, the 1 million-square-foot Terminal A was delivered as part of a design-build consortium led by Tutor Perini/Parsons JV with Grimshaw as the design architect in partnership with STV as executive architect. The $2.7 billion project represented both the Port Authority’s largest ever investment in New Jersey and the state’s largest design-build project. In addition to its award-winning aesthetics, the facility received LEED gold certification from the U.S. Green Building Council thanks to its energy-efficient design, rooftop solar panels, efficient lighting and water fixtures and “cool roof” to reflect sunlight.\n\nAlongside innovative amenities and eye-catching design, Terminal A offers an unmistakable sense of place with a public art program featuring dozens of local artists, digital wayfinding with New Jersey-themed fun facts and airport lounges with locally sourced furniture and décor. The New Jersey connections extend to food and retail offerings that include local shops with roots in the nearby cities of Newark, Elizabeth, and Jersey City that together complement regional, national and global brands.\n\nTo serve the new terminal, the Port Authority opened a 2.7 million-square-foot consolidated rent-a-car facility that houses 10 rental car operations under one roof for a streamlined, simplified rental process. The facility is housed within the terminal’s new public parking facility, which features the largest rooftop solar panel installation in any U.S. airport along with more than 150 electric vehicle charging stations.\n\nMore information on the 2023 Prix Versailles awards is available here.\n\nAbout Newark Liberty International Airport Redevelopment\n\nThe Port Authority has embarked on a complete redevelopment of Newark Liberty International Airport that began with the opening of Terminal A – the centerpiece of an airport-wide renaissance designed to establish the airport as a world-class gateway for the New Jersey and New York region.\n\nThis month, the Port Authority moved forward on a full replacement of Newark Liberty’s outdated AirTrain system with a modern, reliable 2.5-mile automated people mover train system. The first contract in a multi-phase procurement process was awarded to Doppelmayr, a market leader in cable-propelled transport systems.

The AirTrain Newark Replacement Program will replace the current outmoded system with a modern, reliable 2.5-mile automated people mover train system.\n\nDoppelmayr will play a key role in developing the new AirTrain Newark system. The contract includes $570 million for design and construction, with an estimated $385 million over 20 years, net present value, for operation and maintenance of the automated people mover system and its vehicles. The new AirTrain system is expected to open in 2029.\n\n“By advancing the replacement of AirTrain Newark, we further build upon Newark Liberty’s transformation into the modern, world-class airport our region deserves,” said New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy. “This project marks a massive win-win not only for the tens of thousands of passengers who utilize AirTrain Newark daily, but for our residents in adjacent communities as well. While the revamped AirTrain will improve efficiency and connectivity at Newark Liberty, the project will also promote workforce development opportunities and good-paying local jobs, including for minority- and women-owned businesses.”\n\n“This is a critical step in our wide-ranging efforts to revitalize and modernize Newark Liberty International Airport,” said Port Authority Chairman Kevin O’Toole. “Given Doppelmayr’s experience and expertise, we know the firm will be a great partner in bringing our travelers the reliable, efficient transportation they deserve, surrounded by world-class terminals and amenities.”\n\n“We are committed to driving this critical project forward, and this multi-step procurement process does it in a way that’s manageable and encourages competition,” said Port Authority Executive Director Rick Cotton. “The selection of Doppelmayr underscores our determination to deliver travelers a world-class customer experience at our airports, including modern, reliable mass transit options.”\n\n“Doppelmayr is proud to partner with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey for the development of the new AirTrain Newark,” said Markus Schrenttewein, President Doppelmayr Cable Car America, Inc. “The Doppelmayr Group has a large number of similar projects to its name in the US, namely the Oakland Airport Connector and systems in Las Vegas. For AirTrain Newark, Doppelmayr will place a special emphasis on creating value for the local community.”\n\nIn addition to the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of the automated people mover system and its vehicles, the first procurement phase also includes the furnishing, delivery, installation, testing and commissioning of the system technology components. Those components include train control, electrical power, communications, propulsion, and Maintenance and Control Facility (MCF) equipment. Future project procurement phases will include contracts related to the system’s guideway and stations, maintenance and control facility, pedestrian connections, and demolition of the existing system, among others.\n\nDoppelmayr was selected after a rigorous review process, following a Request for Qualifications issued in December 2022 and a Request for Proposals issued in March 2023.\n\nThe contract continues the Port Authority’s mandate to create equitable economic opportunities at its major capital projects. To this end, Doppelmayr has committed to making good-faith efforts to meet specific benchmarks around the hiring of minority-owned business enterprises, women-owned business enterprises, service-disabled veteran-owned business enterprises, and locally owned business enterprises, with those from the cities of Newark and Elizabeth prioritized.\n\nThe firm is also required to develop a locally based workforce development program, with goals to hire program participants for future work on the new system’s construction and operation. Additional details regarding work and contracting opportunities are available on the EWR Redevelopment website.\n\nAirTrain Newark serves as the primary means for millions of passengers to transfer between the three passenger terminals at Newark Liberty, parking, rental car facilities, and regional rail transit via the Northeast Corridor Rail Link Station, with connections to NJ TRANSIT and Amtrak rail service. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the AirTrain carried an average of 33,000 passengers per day, or approximately 12 million passengers per year. The existing AirTrain, in operation since 1996, is reaching the end of its useful life, requires extensive maintenance and repair, and cannot adequately meet forecasted demand.\n\nRedeveloping Newark Liberty International Airport\n\nThe Port Authority has embarked on a complete redevelopment of Newark Liberty International Airport that began with the opening of Terminal A – the centerpiece of an airport-wide renaissance designed to establish the airport as a world-class gateway for the New Jersey and New York region.\n\nEarlier this year, the Port Authority Board of Commissioners also authorized $12 million for the planning and preliminary design of the EWR Station Access Project, which is expected to increase public transit access for the South Ward neighborhood to Newark Liberty International Airport and New York City for the underserved communities in Newark and Elizabeth, including a one-seat ride to New York Penn Station’s Moynihan Train Hall and on Amtrak and NJ TRANSIT direct Northeast Corridor services.\n\nThe next phase of the Port Authority’s ongoing transformation of Newark Liberty International Airport will be developed through the work of a world-class airport master planner selected by the agency last year.

The Port Authority will replace the existing AirTrain Newark system with a new 2.5-mile automated train system under a multi-phase procurement process.\n\nIn keeping with its commitment to communities surrounding its facilities, the Port Authority developed several programs designed to engage local communities in the areas of workforce development and job creation; diversity, equity and inclusion; and education.\n\n“At the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, we keep the region moving by air, land, rail and sea, so that the people and businesses of our region continue to thrive,” said Port Authority Chairman Kevin O’Toole. “As one of the largest economic generators in the region, we also have a commitment to an inclusionary contracting practice and to ensuring the economic benefits of our infrastructure projects are available to the communities surrounding our facilities, which includes job opportunities.”\n\n“The Port Authority recognizes the value of a diverse workforce and supplier base that reflects our region,” said Port Authority Executive Director Rick Cotton. “That diversity will help enhance and promote our operational effectiveness, our brand and our impact in the community, particularly as we are modernizing our facilities.”\n\n“These times remind me of words that were expressed by the late Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.: ‘The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy,’” said John E. Harmon Sr., the founder, president and CEO of AACCNJ. “We are now in those times once again and the optimal outcomes can be realized when the rules of engagement are clearly defined, and the playing field is available to all to compete effectively with value being the declared goal. The AACCNJ applauds the Port Authority and its team of professionals in their support of our collaborative approach to identify talented businesses from communities near the proposed AirTrain Newark replacement program at a time when others are trepid about creditably engaging MWSDBE and SDVOB enterprises to compete for public and private sector opportunities.”\n\n“This is a one-of-a-kind executive education, workforce development and bonding capacity building program. It will increase the readiness of small businesses to sign contracts. It leverages the Port Authority’s commitment to local contracting, the connections of AACCNJ, the research on minority business development of CUEED and expertise in procurement of Integrity Compliance Consulting,” said Lyneir Richardson, assistant professor of practice at Rutgers Business School and executive director of the Newark Center for Urban Entrepreneurship and Economic Development (CUEED).\n\nProgram participants will be connected directly to leaders in finance, law, accounting, information systems, procurement, supply chain, bonding, and human resources. The program sessions are held at Rutgers Business School in Newark, N.J. The second cohort begins today with classes starting on Sept. 20. The Port Authority, with the AACCNJ, CUEED and Integrity Compliance Consulting (ICC) successfully launched the eight-week program consisting of classes with the following curriculum:\n\nmarketing/branding/elevator pitch\n\nproject and document management; construction management\n\njob cost\n\nbonding/general conditions for bidding/project labor agreements/prevailing wages\n\nwork schedule/forecasting\n\nestimating/scheduling/change orders\n\njoint venture/contract law\n\nfinancials/bookkeeping/taxes\n\nAbout AirTrain Newark\n\nAirTrain Newark is a critical component of the operation of Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR). The automated monorail system carries on average 33,000 passengers per day or approximately 12 million passengers per year. It provides access to the Northeast Corridor Rail Link station, connecting riders to NJ TRANSIT and Amtrak service, and provides customers and employees with the ability to transfer between terminals, parking lots and rental car facilities. The current AirTrain EWR, which has reached the end of its useful life, will be replaced with a new AirTrain system that will meet increasing passenger demands and enable world-class operations that provide for a 21st century customer experience for airport visitors and employees.\n\nAbout the AACCNJ\n\nThe AACCNJ performs an essential role in the economic viability of New Jersey. While providing a platform for New Jersey’s African American business leaders to speak with a collective voice, the AACCNJ advocates and promotes economic diversity fostering a climate of business growth through major initiatives centering on education and public policy. The chamber serves as a proactive advocacy group with a 501(c) 3 tax exemption, which is shared by the National Black Chamber of Commerce.\n\nAbout CUEED\n\nRutgers University – Newark’s Center for Urban Entrepreneurship and Economic Development (CUEED) is the first center of its kind in the nation to integrate scholarly works with private capital, government, and non-profit sectors to develop citywide resources and bring renewed economic growth and vitality through urban entrepreneurship. It promotes and fosters a new generation of urban entrepreneurs who actively seek socially conscious urban renaissance. Its mission is to build a world-class research-driven, teaching and practitioner-oriented urban entrepreneurship and economic development program that will transform the economy of the city of Newark, New Jersey, and other urban centers; create wealth in urban communities; and be a model for all urban universities.\n\nNEWARK LIBERTY INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT’S NEW TERMINAL A NOW FULLY OPERATIONAL WITH OPENING OF FINAL GATES, ADDITIONAL RETAIL OPTIONS\n\nAugust 23, 2023\n\nDelta Air Lines Moves Operations and Sky Club Lounge from Terminal B to New Terminal A\n\nTerminal A Milestone is First Step in Comprehensive Makeover for Newark Liberty\n\nPhotos of Delta’s New Sky Club Lounge at Terminal A are Available Here\n\nThe Port Authority of New York and New Jersey today announced the new Terminal A at Newark Liberty International Airport is now fully operational with the opening of the final five gates of the terminal alongside additional retail and dining outlets and the transfer of Delta Air Lines operations and Sky Club lounge from Terminal B.\n\nThe new 1 million-square-foot Terminal A replaced the previous terminal that opened in 1973. The 33-gate facility features airy, light-filled concourses alongside state-of-the-art digital technology, modern passenger amenities, superior dining and retail options, and an innovative public art program showcasing dozens of local artists. Terminal A has been designed and constructed to the standards of LEED silver certification from the U.S. Green Building Council.\n\nWith Terminal A now fully operational, the Port Authority has committed to a full re-envisioning of the entire airport complex. The agency last year selected a world-renowned master planner to design a framework for future development through 2065, recommending short- and long-term projects to enable economic growth, drive sustainability efforts, and create a world-class gateway for New Jersey and the region. The plan’s development includes extensive community outreach and participation.\n\n“The full rebirth of Newark Liberty International Airport begins with this gleaming new terminal,” said Port Authority Chairman Kevin O’Toole. “We are proud to welcome Delta Air Lines to its spectacular new home in Terminal A, as we embark on a comprehensive reimagining for the entire airport.”\n\n“Newark Airport’s transformation is now taking off,” said Port Authority Executive Director Rick Cotton. “Newark Airport’s new Terminal A is yet another testament to the Port Authority’s commitment to bring our airport passengers the world class facilities they deserve. The agency’s largest-ever investment in New Jersey has certainly paid off.”\n\nDelta Air Lines joins Air Canada, American Airlines, JetBlue, and United Airlines in the new Terminal A. The activation of five more gates completes the full operational complement of 33 gates in Terminal A. As of mid-August, the terminal has served over 9 million passengers, and is on target to welcome the 10 millionth passenger in mid-September.\n\n“Delta’s move to the transformed and modernized Terminal A helps us further enhance the travel journey for our Newark customers for years to come,” said Ginny Elliott, Delta Air Lines’s vice president of East Coast airport operations. “This relocation also makes it possible for us to open a new, larger Delta Sky Club, where lounge guests can relax and recharge before their flights.”\n\n“We are very happy to welcome Delta Air Lines and the Delta Sky Club to Terminal A,” said Michael Kunz, CEO of Munich Airport NJ LLC., the terminal operator of the new Terminal A. “Their arrival marks a major milestone in achieving a full-operational status and sets the stage for continued world-class travel in and out of Terminal A.”\n\nIn addition to relocating to Terminal A, Delta has opened a new 7,000-square-foot passenger lounge with a design inspired by the city’s natural landscape and industrial past. The new space seats more than 200 guests and includes elevated views of the terminal and airfield. The lounge features acoustic systems designed to absorb outside sounds, providing visitors with a quiet refuge inside the bustling terminal. Guests of Delta’s Sky Club at Terminal A can enjoy a drink from either the premium bar or the beverage station, as well as buffet-style food offerings.\n\nAdditional local retail, food and beverage shops from Newark, Elizabeth, and Jersey City, as well as regional, national and global brands, provide passengers with more dining and retail options.\n\nMore upgrades are on the way at the airport. The privately financed Consolidated Rent-A-Car (ConRac) facility is expected to open later this year. The 2.7 million-square-foot facility will consolidate 10 rental car operations under one roof, allowing for a streamlined, simplified rental process. The terminal’s public parking facility features the largest rooftop solar panel installation in any U.S. airport along with more than 150 electric vehicle charging stations.\n\nFor travelers seeking mass transit options to the airport, the Port Authority is committed to building a brand-new AirTrain Newark system, which is integral to modernizing and improving Newark Liberty. AirTrain Newark will be replaced through a multi-phase procurement process. Earlier this year, the agency selected three automated-people-mover (APM) system technology firms to advance to the next phase of a multi-phase procurement process to replace the existing AirTrain Newark system at Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) with a new 2.5-mile automated train system.\n\nThe AirTrain started operating in 1996 and is now outdated. It carries an average of 26,000 passengers per day and nearly 10 million passengers per year.

Kennedy International Airport in 2023\n\nExpanding Use of Solar Power at Region’s Airports Critical to Agency Goal of Net-Zero Emissions by 2050\n\nThe Port Authority of New York and New Jersey today announced that Newark Liberty International Airport’s 5-megawatt (MW) solar project at the Terminal A parking garage, which is the largest single solar rooftop project at any U.S. airport, has generated 1 gigawatt hour of power after just two months of operation. As part of the agency’s continued commitment to sustainability, Port Authority also announced a deal with TotalEnergies to begin construction of New York state’s largest solar carport at JFK in 2023.\n\n“With the announcement of the largest single solar rooftop project at any airport in the nation, Newark Liberty continues to bolster its standing as a world-class transportation hub that is not only modern and welcoming but equipped to confront the challenges of our worsening climate crisis,” said New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy. “Indeed, as we continue to pursue a 100 percent clean-energy economy and a greener New Jersey, every institution and agency has a crucial role to play. While advancing PANYNJ’s critical efforts to prioritize sustainability, the unveiling of this project testifies to the significant progress we can – and will – achieve toward making our state greener and more resilient for generations to come.”\n\n“New York is taking historic action to combat climate change, from investing in energy affordability to promoting clean air and water to mandating all vehicles sold in New York be zero emission by 2035,” said New York Governor Kathy Hochul. “The inclusion of a significant solar array as part of the redevelopment of JFK Airport will help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, effectively repurpose heat energy for water management, and will limit the carbon footprint at one of the world’s busiest hubs. We will continue working closely together to create a greener future for our communities, our infrastructure, and our planet.”\n\n“We became the first U.S. transportation agency to embrace the Paris Climate Agreement and have taken ambitious actions to do our part to mitigate the effects of climate change,” said Port Authority Chairman Kevin O’Toole. “As part of our longstanding commitment to environmental sustainability and reducing the emission of greenhouse gases in the New York and New Jersey region, the agency has made significant investments, such as these projects, in solar energy and other renewable energy sources.”\n\n“The agency recognizes the transformative potential of solar energy,” said Port Authority Executive Director Rick Cotton. “We have established a goal of achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. These projects at JFK and Newark Liberty are part of the Port Authority’s aggressive climate action plan to meet the demands of a growing region by embarking on an unprecedented program to build the next generation of world-class infrastructure all while focusing on reducing our environmental impact.”\n\nInstalled by ENGIE North America (ENGIE), a leader in energy transition, the canopy structure atop the parking garage servicing Newark Liberty’s new Terminal A features 12,708 solar panels covering 364,000 square feet, which is the equivalent of more than six football fields. The 5-MW solar project will generate enough energy to power approximately 833 homes.\n\n“ENGIE is proud to support the Port Authority’s ambitious sustainability targets, aligned with our mission to accelerate the global transition toward net-zero carbon,” said Stefaan Sercu, ENGIE’s chief energy solutions officer. “Our team is excited to be an integral part of the Port Authority’s modern approach to becoming a more sustainable airport with the largest solar project build out of any airport structure in the country, while improving operations efficiency and reducing emissions.”\n\nAdditionally, the parking garage features more than 150 electric vehicle chargers for public use. To help reduce cost and lower energy utilization, the charging stations feature sophisticated load management software so that charging will be shared smartly from the garage’s solar energy and ensures appropriate power output for the number of cars and the duration someone will be parking there.\n\nIn 2020, the Port Authority Board of Commissioners authorized the development, construction, and operation of New York state’s largest onsite solar plus storage system at John F. Kennedy International Airport. The JFK solar installation will create a carport canopy with solar panels on top of the southern section of the airport’s Long Term Parking Lot 9, providing covered parking to approximately 3,000 parking spaces. The 12.3-MW solar energy system includes 7.5 MW of battery storage, which will provide enhanced resilience to AirTrain JFK. With construction expected to begin in 2023, the project is expected to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by nearly 5,300 metric tons annually and the solar-generated electricity provided to the grid will serve low-income residents who may be eligible to receive credits on utility bills through the New York state community solar program.\n\nSimilarly, the Port Authority installed more than 3,500 solar panels on the rooftop of the newly built parking garage on the western side of LaGuardia Airport, which produces more than 1.7 million kilowatt-hours of clean, renewable energy annually as part of the agency’s net-zero emissions targets announced in 2021.\n\nAs part of the redevelopment of John F. Kennedy International Airport, the future New Terminal One will feature a rooftop array and integrated microgrid to help reduce its greenhouse gas emissions. The panels — some 13,000 of them — will feed energy into an 11.34-MW microgrid. Each of the system’s four “power islands” is designed to function as an integrated energy system; together, the microgrid will boast 7.66 MW of rooftop solar power, 3.68 MW of natural gas fuel cells, and 4 megawatt-hours of battery energy storage. Reclaimed heat will be used to chill and heat water. The rooftop’s photovoltaic array alone can create enough electricity to power 1,039 average U.S. homes for a year.\n\nNewark Liberty’s new Terminal A has been designed and constructed to achieve LEED silver certification from the U.S. Green Building Council, and features a variety of sustainability features including water efficient fixtures saving more than 45 percent on potable water demand, a “cool roof” and light-colored pavements to reduce heat gain on the building and heat-island effect on the surrounding environment, energy-efficient indoor lighting and controls, solar photovoltaic system on the western entrance canopy, materials with recycled content and regionally procured, low-emitting materials and paints to improve indoor air quality.\n\nTerminal A was also designed to withstand today’s 100-year flood plus projected future sea level rise.\n\nRevolutionizing ground operations, the Port Authority airports are also providing infrastructure to support electric ground support equipment (GSE) as well as new electric buses to support shuttle operations. On-site solar and other renewable energy initiatives are among seven key areas that the agency’s overall sustainability program encompasses, along with clean electric vehicles; energy efficiency; “green” facilities; clean ship practices for ocean-going vessels; offshore wind and partnering to combat climate change.\n\nA variety of solar projects are across Port Authority facilities, include a 600-kilowatt solar roof on a PATH warehouse rooftop.

An important planning element will be the analysis of the impact of COVID-19 on the airport’s travel volumes and customer demands in the near and longer terms.\n\nFor a copy of the RFP, click here: EWR Vision Plan RFP\n\n“The reimagining and renovation of Newark Liberty International Airport will be a gamechanger for the state and the region’s status as a transportation hub,” said New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy. “The Newark Liberty Vision Plan will continue making improvements that build on New Jersey’s strategic location and improve the travel experience for the millions of people who make their way through Newark Airport every year.”\n\n“Today marks another bold step forward in the Port Authority’s effort to reimagine what EWR can be,” said Port Authority Chairman Kevin O’Toole. “The aim of the Newark Liberty Vision Plan is nothing less than the creation of a stunning, world class gateway that delivers best-in-class facilities for our passengers and further enhances the airport’s economic importance to the region.”\n\n“We continue to move toward a modern, state-of-the-art Newark Liberty Airport that delivers for our travelers at the highest level,” said Port Authority Executive Director Rick Cotton. “With this next phase of the redevelopment of Newark Liberty, we are creating a new vision for the airport to serve air passengers at a world-class level in the decades ahead.”\n\nPre-pandemic, Newark Liberty ranked as the nation’s 12th busiest airport in total passengers, with 33 airlines serving more than 47.5 million customers in 2019 offering non-stop service to more than 160 destinations globally. Newark Liberty also serves as a powerful economic engine for the region, with about 23,000 people employed in airport-related jobs.\n\nNewark Liberty is in the midst of an airport-wide transformation with three major projects on the books and underway, totaling about $5.3 billion in public and private investment.\n\nFirst, a new Terminal A is scheduled to open later this year. Measuring more than one million square feet, the $2.7 billion facility — the largest design-build project in New Jersey history – is in the final stages of construction. It is replacing the outdated current Terminal A and incorporating a new roadway access network and additional terminal-front parking once completed. The new Terminal A represents the largest single investment in New Jersey by the Port Authority in the agency’s 100-year history.\n\nSecond, a new privately financed Consolidated Rent-A-Car (ConRac) facility combined with Port Authority-funded public parking also is in the final stages of construction with a partial opening scheduled for later this year and a full opening in 2023.\n\nThird, the Port Authority is moving forward with development of a $2.05 billion Newark Liberty AirTrain to replace the current outdated AirTrain.\n\nVision planners also will also be looking beyond the airport proper, seeking ways to enhance the quality of life for nearby residents and to increase the economic value of the airport to the region by maximizing job creation and economic opportunities in Newark, Elizabeth, and throughout the Port District.\n\nIn addition, planning consultants will be developing strategies for more operationally efficient parking facilities, road access and potential creation of new Ground Transportation Center (GTC) facilities to meet current and future needs. Experts hired to conduct the study will also be asked to identify new, cutting-edge technology resources to improve the customer experience and wayfinding capabilities.\n\nContact:\n\nThe Port Authority of New York and New Jersey\n\n212-435-7777\n\n[email protected]\n\nThe Port Authority of New York and New Jersey is a bi-state agency that builds, operates, and maintains many of the most important transportation and trade infrastructure assets in the country.
