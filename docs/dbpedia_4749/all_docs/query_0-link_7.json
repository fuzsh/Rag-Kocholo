        "text": "About Newark International Airport\n\nOn October 1, 1928, Newark Liberty International Airport began serving the New York Metropolitan area. Located in Newark, New Jersey, EWR provides access to thirty major airlines. Newark International is one of the three airports that serve the New York/New Jersey area. Each year, over 42 million passengers fly out of EWR.\n\nUsed for military operations during the second world war, Newark International Airport reopened for commercial use in 1964 under the Port Authority of New York.

Additions to the airport included rental car facilities, two terminals, a rail system, and countless amenities to make travel convenient for air passengers.\n\nEWR is one of United Airlines’ largest hubs and this bustling airport is steeped in American history. On September 11, 2001, a United Airlines flight left EWR and never reached its final destination.
