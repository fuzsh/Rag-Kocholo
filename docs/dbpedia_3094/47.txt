You can say what you want about Elon Musk's politics, but he's a brilliant guy. Here's a short video clip about "Elon Musk's 5-step process for making things in a better way" which is excellent. Here's a summary: The video is an extract for educational purposes from a great interview with Elon Musk by Everyday Astronaut. It's an extract for product managers, service designers and other people who make hardware, software, or both. It might be good general life advice too! The 5 step process for handling requirements when making things is according to a man who gets a lot of things done and learns from his mistakes (including the Cybertruck window smash, which he's wearing an image of on his t-shirt during the interview). 1. Make your requirements less dumb - Your requirements are definitely dumb - Its particularly dangerous if a smart person gave them to you as you might not question them enough 2. Delete the part or process - If you're not adding back then you're not deleting enough - Don't add requirements just in case, don't hedge your bets 3. Simplify/Optimise - Don't optimise if it shouldn't exist 4. Accelerate cycle times - But don't go faster if you haven't worked on the other 3 things first... - If you're digging your grave don't dig your grave faster 5. Automate - Don't reverse these 5 steps Musk admits that early in his career he started with step 5 - automation - and worked backwards, such as with the beginnings of the Tesla Model 3. I think he's learned his lessons! You can find the amazing full SpaceX Starbase Tour episode on Everyday Astronaut's channel here! https://lnkd.in/eNkJw8Vm #success #technology #innovation #automotive #space #elonmusk #tesla #spacex #leadership

One of the highlights of the Infor portfolio is Birst, which is a market-leading business intelligence (BI) platform. It combines data from the Data Lake, which, through APIs, can include many Infor and non-Infor data sources. This allows Birst Analytics to provide beautiful dashboards and KPIs operating from "one source of truth". At PCG | PREDICTABLE BUSINESS AND DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION, we have taken this a giant step further by adding capabilities for Microsoft Power BI and Tableau combined with Birst to provide many pre-built analytics and dashboards on top of the already expansive library available out of the box with Infor. We call it "Actualize" and the video does a great job of showing it in brilliant color. Here is some more explanation of Actualize: ACTUALIZE is an analytics accelerator for Infor ERP, built on the Infor Birst platform. ACTUALIZE provides dashboards and ad-hoc reporting capabilities across the C-suite, Sales, Inventory, Supplier, Finance, and Production as well as 360¬∞ dashboards for Products, Customers, Suppliers, and Sites. ACTUALIZE has been developed by an industry-leading data and analytics team within the Infor ecosystem, experienced across thousands of successful analytics projects. In addition to ACTUALIZE, my article "Why PCG Should Be Your Business Transformation Partner" explains our entire portfolio of products and services: https://lnkd.in/ea-tFuJY Enjoy!

We need more cost-saving use cases for AI combined with ERP! Here is a great example from Infor of using AI, ERP and IoT for proactive predictive maintenance on machines! It covers: 1) Quality inspections in the Infor CloudSuite Enterprise ERP system 2) Processing service orders in the ERP 3) AI to predict the number of days before a machine is likely to fail 4) Use of an Infor Operating Service (OS) API to create an inspection order 5) Based on automatically created service orders, dispatch a technician proactively There are so many more educational videos that will be housed in our "PCG Insights Hub" where we are building content and planning the design. Can't wait to show it to you!

This is an excellent Infor CloudSuite Enterprise (CE) Finance Overview video that shows the beautiful Home Pages and drill-down capabilities in the ERP and BI. You can see: 1) Role-based Home pages for the CFO and Accounting Manager roles (standard or customized). 2) Multiple Dashboards and widgets from the Infor Operating Service (OS) and Birst Analytics all on one page. 3) Drill down to 360 views for Accounts Payable, Accounts Receivable and General Ledger (GL) all the way to the GL transactions. 4) Summary views and financial statements by up to 12 financial dimensions, such as P&L by Product Line or Expenses by Cost Center. 5) Drill down from charts and graphs into budget vs actual numbers from a single source of the truth from the ERP GL that can be looked at in Enterprise Performance Management (EPM). 6) Online or export to Excel for financial information such as Financial Statements (Balance sheet, P&L, Cash Flow).

It's all coming together! This is another example of the types of demo and educational videos we will have in the new "PCG Insights Hub". It's a sweet "cross-functional" overview of the Infor CloudSuite Enterprise (CE) ERP system. üëè The video also covers how the ERP is integrated with other Infor solutions, such as Configure/Price/Quote (CPQ) and Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) using the Infor Operating Service (OS). üé¨ I think this one is amazing, and I'm not easily impressed as I've seen hundreds if not thousands of demos in my 25+ years of ERP experience. I really believe that with this Hub we are creating something very special that showcases the ERP, MES, and other solutions - not just AI and RPA - although those will be there as well. üìπ I'm amazed at the response to the individual videos I've been putting out, all of which are in the Hub already. Some of these are getting 12000+ views on LinkedIn! Awesome. üöÄ I also have been receiving many messages from my network and others on LinkedIn requesting access, so I'll start maintaining a list. üòé Let me know what you think in the comments below! And if I or PCG | PREDICTABLE BUSINESS AND DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION can help you with Infor then let me know via LinkedIn at Dan Aldridge, ERP Software Expert. Thanks!

This is exciting that Infor and their partner Amazon Web Services (AWS) are teaming up for all the Infor CloudSuites running on AWS Cloud. It's a perfect match - the leading cloud provider and the 3rd largest ERP provider in the world! ü§ù Infor, AWS, and many other partners like my company PCG | PREDICTABLE BUSINESS AND DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION will be in Vegas for the Velocity Event on September 30th - October 2nd, 2024. üí™ Here's what you can expect: https://lnkd.in/gv5Vi8s9 If you're not that familiar with Infor, here is an article "Modernizing ERP Systems With Infor": https://lnkd.in/eq8jvJJY If you're not that familiar with the Infor CloudSuites ‚òÅ, here is an article "What are the Infor CloudSuites? Intro to Infor CloudSuites that has a number of demo videos and lots of good education about the solution. https://lnkd.in/gyi6EcnB At PCG, we're building a "PCG Insights Hub" üí° which will include a large library of demo and educational training videos that will allow you to do your own research into the solutions.

Birst is Infor's excellent data visualization and analytics platform. Here's a sweet YouTube video short that explains how to use the Infor Operating Service (OS) Portal Bookmarks with Birst! I plan to include several "shorts" in the PCG | PREDICTABLE BUSINESS AND DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION Insights Hub and there are a lot on Infor's YouTube channel as well. Here's a link to the PCG's Actualize Analytics capability which includes Birst! https://lnkd.in/euui6-BF There's a demo on the page which will be posted on Insight Hub later. Hope you like it!

Sometimes the simplest "how-to" videos are the best. This video describes "How to add users and authorize permissions" using the Infor Operating Service (OS). It's simply words and upbeat music...very nice. And it's only 1 minute and 52 seconds (you can dance if you want). üï∫ I've been trying to put out a range of the types of demo and training videos that we will have in the new PCG Insights Hub. So excited about the launch! üöÄ If you enjoyed this video, let me know in the comments below. As the Hub is being built, I'll continue publishing examples and eliciting feedback on what you want to see. üì∫ The target market for this is on-prem customers of Infor and prospects who want to research the Infor CloudSuites. Soon after that, we will do the same for NetSuite. ‚òÅ Enjoy! - The ERP Doctor üë®‚öïÔ∏è ‚ù§Ô∏è #digitaltransformation #ERP #demo #training #videos #infor #sap #oracle #netsuite
