This MARADMIN provides Marines, civilians serving with Marines, and their families conducting a Permanent Change of Station (PCS) move during the peak moving season (15 May through 31 August 2024) with information on how to ship and store personal property and execute travel as effectively and efficiently as possible. Personal property is defined as household goods (HHG), unaccompanied baggage (UB), mobile homes and privately owned vehicles (POVs). During this peak moving season, most moves 98% will continue to use the Defense Personal Property System (DPS). A very small percentage, less than 2% will use the Global Household Goods Contract (GHC) for local moves of approximately (50) miles or less within the Continental United States (CONUS). The responses provided to the questionnaire as detailed in paragraph 3 will determine which move program a Marine will use.\n\n2. Keys to Success. Early counseling, planning, preparation, flexibility, communication, and command support are the keys to executing a successful PCS move and especially during the peak season. Contact the origin and / or destination Personal Property Office (PPO) / Passenger Travel Office (PTO) or the LP Distribution POCs for additional information, training, and support.\n\n3. Initial Steps\n\n3.a. Personal Property Shipment and Storage Requirements. Once notification is received that PCS orders are forthcoming or orders are in hand, Marines can use the following methods to access the DPS Landing Page.\n\n3.b. Option one: Navigate to the DPS Landing page by following https:(slash)(slash)dps.move.mil/cust/standard/user/home.xhtml. Once on the DPS Landing Page, Marine will see the “sort tool.” The “sort tool” is designed to sort applications between DPS and GHC. Once at the “sort tool” follow the instructions as a “CUSTOMER (I need to ship personal property).” Accurate responses to the questions will ensure Marines are routed to the correct system. Marines must enter correct email addresses to facilitate communications throughout the application and onboarding process.\n\n3.c. Option 2: While the DPS link above is the best method to access the DPS Landing Page, Marines may also use the Military One Source website, www.militaryonesource.mil/moving-pcs/moving-personal-property and click on LOGIN TO DPS to reach the DPS Landing Page.\n\n3.d. For those that choose the Military One Source website, scroll down the page and explore the various links and tabs to learn how the generic move process works. Locate the supporting Personal Property Processing Office (PPPO) / Installation Transportation Office (ITO), determine the weight of household goods, receive initial personal property entitlement and allowance information, review POV shipment and storage instructions, review instructions on claim filing, and much more.\n\n3.e. If technical issues arise with the DPS Landing Page, contact the System Response Center for assistance at 800.462.2176 or email at usarmy.scott.sddc.mbx.g6-src-dps-hd@army.mil.\n\n4. Counseling requirements and considerations.\n\n4.a. Marines conducting their first move, Marines separating or retiring, and Marines moving a mobile home must receive additional counseling because of varying entitlements. Visit / contact your local Personal Property Processing Office (PPPO) before submitting the shipment application to learn about your shipping requirements and entitlements.\n\n4.b. All Marines will perform self-counseling using the DPS Landing Page instructions provided in paragraph 3 above. Marines using DPS to manage their shipment are encouraged to take notes on entitlements, allowances, and procedures during counseling. Once complete with reviewing the counseling information, upload the required documents such as PCS Orders and endorsements, and note any questions not covered by DPS Counseling. The next step is to contact or visit the nearest installation PPPO to receive targeted counseling on questions noted during DPS counseling and submit any additional documents, including documents for a Personally Procured Move (PPM) and/or to complete shipment or storage for a POV.\n\n4.c. Planning the Move Dates. Marines MUST complete their DPS counseling and submit their requested pickup date as soon as possible after receipt of their orders, but not less than 90 days before their requested pickup date.\n\n4.d. Important dates to consider. The most popular peak season pickup dates (the peak of the peak season) are immediately following the Memorial Day weekend through mid-July. HHG moves in this 45-day window are difficult to schedule because of the high demand for shipments across the Department of Defense. Therefore, the sooner an application is submitted, the sooner the requested pickup date can be considered. Also, be aware that the first two days and last two days of every month may be difficult to schedule as pickup dates because of the timing of rental and lease agreements.\n\n4.e. Requested pickup dates are not confirmed until the Transportation Service Provider (TSP) representative contacts the Marine in writing via email with the confirmed pickup date(s). This sets the 7 Day Spread for Routine Shipments (described in paragraph 4.g.). Should unexpected circumstances require a change to the pickup and / or delivery dates, Marines should be aware that new pickup and / or delivery dates that meet their needs may not be available. Marines MUST contact the PPSO Outbound Shipment Section / Shipment Management Section immediately to attempt to schedule new pickup and / or delivery dates.\n\n4.f. Marines may have multiple shipments and a different TSP assigned to each shipment, particularly for orders Outside the Continental United States (OCONUS). Please note, be careful not overlap multiple shipment pickup and delivery dates because (although unlikely) it could cause the wrong items to be packed and placed in the wrong shipment. If this occurs, a \"break-in” cost will be charged to the Marine seeking to retrieve items. To avoid those costs, schedule requested pickup and delivery dates accordingly and when possible, be sure to physically separate different shipments for different locations.\n\n4.g. The 7 Day Spread for Routine Shipments. Marines will provide a requested pickup date, which should be the last day the HHGs are ready for pickup. The preceding six (6) calendar days before the requested pickup date will be set as the 7 Day Spread period. The Marine will submit a preferred pickup date that must fall within the 7 Day Spread. When the shipment is awarded to a TSP, the TSP may select the requested pickup date or the TSP may select any one of the other previous six (6) calendar days before the requested pickup date to pick up the shipment. The TSP must provide the confirmed pickup date in writing via email to the Marine within three (3) calendar days from the date the shipment was awarded. Please ensure that your email address is listed correctly in the DPS Landing Page. The Marine and TSP may negotiate the pickup date; however, the TSP must accommodate a pickup date within the spread-date window. Once established, the pickup date cannot change without the Marine's approval and notification by the Marine and the TSP of the approved date change to the Personal Property Shipping Office (PPSO). Weekends and holidays may be part of the previous six (6) calendar days but are not normally used for routine shipment pickup dates unless the Marine wants to be picked up on a weekend / holiday and the TSP can accommodate this request. Weekend / holiday pickup dates must be approved by the Marine, the TSP, and the PPSO that awarded the shipment to the TSP. Note that there may not be Government Quality Assurance personnel available on weekends or holidays. For Marines seeking to move on a weekend or holiday, confirm Government Quality Assurance personnel support with their local PPPO before the pickup date. If the Marine cannot support the pickup date selected by the TSP, the Marine must immediately contact the shipping office to explain why that date is not supportable and request a different date. For additional details on the 7 Day Spread for Routine Shipments, Marines are encouraged to contact their local PPPO.\n\n4.g.1. Note 1. For planning purposes use 4,000 pounds of HHG weight as equal to one day of packing. Therefore, 16,500 pounds of HHG weight equals up to five days of packing immediately before the confirmed pickup date, unless those days are weekends or a holiday, in which case the packing on those dates must be agreed to by the Marine, the TSP, and the PPSO that awarded the shipment to the TSP. The confirmed pickup date should drive all other dates needed to clear quarters and other requirements necessary to execute the move. Once established, the pickup date should not be changed unless it is necessary to make a change due to unforeseen circumstances beyond the control of the Marine because new pickup dates may not be available because of the high volume of moves. To estimate the weight for each shipment, use the authorized weight estimator located at this link: https:(slash)(slash)www.ustranscom.mil/dp3/weightestimator.cfm. Short Fuse, Direct Procurement Method, One Time Only and local move shipments are not eligible for the 7 Day Spread and will be processed per current procedures.\n\n4.g.2. Note 2. Information on the selected TSP is available at this website: https:(slash)(slash)www.ustranscom.mil/dp3/tspinformation.cfm#tspdetail. The Marine will provide the four-digit Standard Carrier Alpha Code (SCAC), which is assigned to every TSP, to enable the search feature. The SCAC will be identified on the email from the PPSO that announces which TSP was awarded the shipment. Select Sort by: “SCAC” and enter the TSP's SCAC to search for TSP ratings. Almost every TSP will have at least one Letter of Warning and / or Letter of Suspension which will be identified on the TSP Metrics page. When the Marine has questions regarding the selected TSP, contact the PPSO at the phone number / email address provided on the shipment award email to discuss.\n\n4.h. Short Fuse shipments. A Short Fuse shipment is a short notice PCS requirement when the Marine receives PCS Orders with limited time between the orders issuance date and the Estimated Departure Date, such as \"10-day orders,\" and orders issued for various schools based on promotion dates, etc., that are beyond the Marine's control. In the rare cases when these short notice situations arise, it is understandable that coordinating all the elements for a PCS move can be overwhelming. Commanders at all leadership levels are encouraged to allow the Marine the necessary time to complete preparations for the move. There are several checklist tools available for a Marine requiring immediate support. Further, all Marines should plan the move as soon as possible and complete the counseling process accordingly. In the event circumstances beyond the control of the Marine (TAD, Formal Schools, etc., and supported by documentation) prevent an early submission of the shipment application, or applications when OCONUS PCS Orders are issued, contact the local PPPO and inform them of the issues associated with the delay in submitting the required application(s). Confirmed pickup date(s) should drive all other dates needed to clear quarters and other requirements necessary to execute the move. Marines should not wait until the last minute to submit their shipment applications as shipping capacity may not be available or lesser quality moving companies may be the only moving companies available for the shipment. When capacity is constrained, it is very important to manage the move and ensure details are clearly explained and supported by all involved.\n\n4.i. Extended transit times. Because of continued worldwide supply chain limitations, TSPs have been provided additional time to deliver HHG shipments to / from / between OCONUS locations. The United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) manages the Defense Personal Property Program (DP3) and continues to monitor transit times with the household goods industry and the military Services.\n\n4.j. Lithium Battery shipment and storage limitations. There are two types of lithium batteries: lithium metal and lithium-ion. Lithium metal batteries are commonly found in cameras, watches, remote controls, handheld games, and smoke detectors. Lithium metal batteries are single use and not rechargeable and come in various forms including cylindrical, button cells, or coin cells. Always check items for the type of batteries installed. They will commonly identify “lithium battery” on the item. Lithium-ion batteries are commonly found in cellphones, power tools, digital cameras, laptops, children’s toys, electronic cigarettes, robot vacuums, small and large appliances, tablets, e-readers, lawn care equipment, and electric bikes (e-bikes). Lithium-ion batteries are rechargeable and intended for multiple uses. Since 15 May 2023, the TSP has been required to properly package, label, and certify lithium-ion cells rated at 100 watt-hours or less (20 watt-hours or less for a single cell) and lithium metal batteries containing two (2) grams or less of lithium content (one (1) gram or less for single cells). Most lithium batteries have labels that identify the watt-hour rating or lithium metal content to assist the consumer with information about the battery. Further, lithium (metal and lithium-ion) batteries are not authorized to be stored in Non-temporary Storage (NTS) shipments picked up on or after 15 May 2024 regardless of watt-hour rating or lithium metal content. Questions regarding lithium batteries can be directed to the local PPO and should be discussed in counseling sessions to ensure there are no violations of this requirement.\n\n4.k. Professional Books, Papers, and Equipment (PBP&E), aka “Pro Gear”. The maximum weight limit for Pro Gear for Marines of all ranks is 2,000 pounds. Marines may request an additional weight allowance up to 500 pounds for spouse Pro Gear required for employment or community support activities for their spouse (civilian employee spouses are not authorized a PBP&E weight allowance). All Pro Gear requests must be submitted to the local PPPO for consideration before the move. Ensure inventory items that are Pro Gear are weighed separately (bathroom scales are acceptable) to obtain a weight on each item. Also, items designated as Pro Gear on the inventory must be marked as M-PRO for the Service member or S-PRO for the spouse of the Service member. See the Defense Transportation Regulation Part IV, Appendix K1 \"It's Your Move\" https:(slash)(slash)www.ustranscom.mil/dtr/part-iv/dtr_part_iv_att_A-k_1.pdf for a list of items that qualify as Pro Gear. For civilian, see Appendix K2 \"It's Your Move\" https:(slash)(slash)www.ustranscom.mil/dtr/part-iv/dtr_part_iv_att_A-k_2.pdf.\n\n4.l. Additional Counseling and Contact Information. The official Marine Corps Facebook Page for Personal Property is located at www.facebook.com/usmchouseholdgoods. The official Marine Corps Facebook Page for Passenger Travel is located at www.facebook.com/usmcpassengertravel. LPD Public Page for PCS Move Resources related to Personal Property Shipment and Storage, Passenger Travel and other critical information is located at: https:(slash)(slash)www.iandl.marines.mil/Divisions/Logistics-Division-LP/Logistics-Distribution-Policy-Branch-LPD/PCS-Move-Resources/.\n\n4.m. Sailors assigned to Marine Corps units should also access the Navy Household Goods and Personal Property website at https:(slash)(slash)www.navsup.navy.mil/NAVSUP-Household-Goods/Home/ for Navy-specific entitlements, allowances and procedures.\n\n4.n. Post Counseling and Follow-Up Actions Before the Move. A Shipping Office representative may contact the Marine to confirm a certain element or elements of a shipment prior to awarding the shipment to a TSP. A Pre-move Survey will also be performed. Further, many TSPs may request the use of an electronic pre-move survey, using a cell phone with camera, to conduct the survey. This method is authorized when approved by the Marine.\n\n4.o. Personally Procured Move (PPM). BE IN CONTROL OF THE MOVE. There are several benefits to executing a PPM, especially during peak season: (1) Marines can choose who (the Marine, a moving company, friends, family or combination), when, and how to move their HHG, (2) no delays in receiving the HHG at destination, (3) Marines are in charge of caring for their own HHG, and (4) potentially more money in the Marine's pocket based on how much they do to keep their costs as low. Note that PPMs will not be performed under the GHC system at this time and only within the DPS. Marines can receive 100% of the Government's cost to move the same weight (up to the maximum authorized weight allowance based on rank and with or without dependents) from the authorized origin location to the authorized destination location in the PCS Orders. Marines are authorized storage up to (90) days at a commercial storage facility not to exceed the Government's cost to store the same weight. Marines executing a PPM inside the CONUS or to Hawaii, Alaska, and U.S. territories and possessions must be counseled and documents properly prepared before the move is performed to ensure they are advised of information particular to the destination, such as the requirement to verify the use of U.S. Flag vessels when the shipment is transiting over ocean. Marines must use their Government Travel Charge Card (GTCC) for all expenses related to a PPM and must notify their Agency Program Coordinator (APC) to adjust the credit limits and PCS Mission Critical status to accommodate the required use at least 10 days prior to departure to ensure the Marine has a maximum amount of time to submit and settle their PPM Claim. The GTCC cannot be used for separation travel, to include PPMs in conjunction with separation travel. For those Marines who do not possess a GTCC, an Advance Operating Allowance (AOA) may be authorized as an exception to policy, however Marines who are using only their POV(s) to execute a PPM are not eligible to receive an AOA. Marines must also provide empty and full weight tickets and submit their completed PPM Claim via Marine Online (MOL) utilizing the PPM Submission portal within the Travel tab. If MOL is not available, Marines may turn the completed claim in to the Marine Corps installation Personal Property Office at destination. Make a complete copy of the PPM Claim before it is turned over for settlement. Marines who receive an AOA must submit their claim within 45 days of receipt of the AOA. Review the PPM Claim settlement website at: https:(slash)(slash)www.logcom.marines.mil/Marines/Personally-Procured-Move/ for the latest information on how to prepare and submit a PPM Claim and the estimated processing time and payment dates for settled PPM Claims. Additional information on PPM processes and claims settlement can be accessed using the link provided in paragraph 4.l. of this MARADMIN.\n\n4.p. Global Household Goods Contract (GHC). USTRANSCOM has begun the process for moving household goods shipments currently performed by hundreds of commercial moving companies worldwide using the Defense Personal Property System (DPS) to a “single move manager” under the GHC. Implementation of the GHC has begun for selected local move pickups and deliveries in four locations (Camp Lejeune / MCAS Cherry Point, Camp Pendleton, and MCRD San Diego). The benefits of using a single move manager contract improves the tasks associated with customer support, communication, packing and moving household goods, storage-in-transit warehouse services and unaccompanied baggage shipments. As mentioned above, 98% of moves will continue to use the DPS process during this peak moving season.\n\n5. Executing the Move. Pre-move preparations are fully explained at this website: https:(slash)(slash)www.militaryonesource.mil/moving-housing/moving/moving-resources/. The residence or other pickup location must be ready for the packers to begin their work. At origin, Marines may need to contact the origin PPPO Quality Assurance Section, the TSP or the TSP's local agent responsible for packing and picking up the shipment, to resolve any issues with the TSP crewmembers, loaders or drivers. At destination, Marines may need to contact the destination PPPO Quality Assurance Section to resolve any issues with the TSP provider or the contracted crew. Origin PCS Counselors will annotate the contact phone numbers of both the Origin and Destination Quality Assurance Sections in the Remarks Block of the DD FORM 1299, Application for Shipment and / or Storage of Personal Property. In the event the DD FORM 1299 is misplaced, Marines may use https:(slash)(slash)installations.militaryonesource.mil/search?program-service=2/view-by=ALL to locate Quality Assurance Section phone numbers.\n\n5.a. Quality Assurance Inspections for all Shipments. Personal Property Quality Assurance Inspectors are authorized to inspect all shipments at origin and destination, including PPM shipments, before and during packing / loading and unloading / unpacking. Also, weight scale operators on military installations can inspect shipments at the scales to ensure only authorized household goods are being weighed in accordance with ref (c), Chapter 4.\n\n5.b. During and After the Move (Completing the Customer Satisfaction Survey in stages). Marines should complete the Customer Satisfaction Survey within seven (7) calendar days after notification that an element of the move is completed, such as Counseling, Origin Services, Destination Services and Claims. The comments and scores given to each TSP contributes toward eliminating poor performers from the Defense Personal Property Program and ensures the best moving companies get the most shipments. To improve the quality of every move, Marines must make their voices heard by completing the Customer Satisfaction Survey as their move progresses to delivery.\n\n6. OCONUS Privately Owned Vehicle (POV) Shipment and Storage\n\n6.a. Marines conducting a PCS move to, from or between Outside the Continental United States (OCONUS) locations may be entitled to ship or store one POV at government expense. Contact the local PPPO for information regarding POV entitlements based on the OCONUS destination and prepare required documents needed to ship or store the POV. Generally, a POV that cannot be shipped OCONUS because of a country restriction is authorized storage and may be stored in government contracted facilities or stored by the Marine in self-procured POV storage. Regardless of the method, storage must be approved in advance by the PPPO. The reimbursable monthly storage rate for self-procured POV storage is based on the monthly POV storage rate paid by the Government to the Global POV Contractor (GPC) International Auto Logistics (IAL). The monthly storage rate for reimbursement changes annually and is based on the rates in the contract. Traditionally, rates tend to drop over time to make contracts competitive and the Government cannot reimburse more than it pays for the same service. Therefore, Marines must be prepared to negotiate a lower monthly storage rate or pay the difference out of pocket if they elect to use a self-procured storage option and the monthly storage rates are less than when the POV was placed into storage.\n\n6.b. Marines must use www.pcsmypov.com to make an appointment for POV drop-off or pick-up at government provided storage facilities. During peak season, demand is high for appointments so make them as soon as possible once orders are received. Marines remaining OCONUS with new orders must provide them to the GPC to ensure continuation of storage at Government expense.\n\n6.c. Marines must prove to the PPPO Counselor and the Vehicle Processing Center (VPC) that all safety recall repairs have been performed on the POV prior to turning in the POV for shipment or storage. Self-procured POV storage businesses may not require the safety recall repairs to be completed prior to placement in storage, but Marines should complete them upon notification by the manufacturer per the instructions in the notification document. The Global POV Contractor will accept Electric Vehicles (EVs) for shipment and storage starting 1 October 2024.\n\n6.d. Late Arrival at Destination. When a POV is delayed at destination, the Marine rates reimbursement for the cost of a rental vehicle for Marine or their dependent’s use at $30 per day (one POV only) for a maximum of $210.\n\n6.e. For information on how to prepare a POV for shipment or storage, review the documents Shipping Your POV, Appendix K3 and Storing Your POV, Appendix K4 of the Defense Transportation Regulation, Part IV, Personal Property at https:(slash)(slash)www.ustranscom.mil/dtr/part-iv/dtr_part_iv_app_k_3.pdf and https:(slash)(slash)www.ustranscom.mil/dtr/part-iv/dtr_part_iv_app_k_4.pdf.\n\n7. Claims\n\n7.a. Lost and Damage Claims. For DPS shipment claims, please visit the guide located at https:(slash)(slash)www.militaryonesource.mil/moving- housing/moving/planning-your-move/file-a-claim-after-your-military-move/. For non-DPS claims, such as contracted moves called Direct Procurement Method moves, or if Marines still have questions on their DPS claims, Marines should contact the Navy Personnel Claims Unit at (888) 897-8217, (757) 440-6315 (DSN 564) or email NorfolkClaims@us.navy.mil. Marines have 180 days from the delivery of each shipment to identify additional loss or damages using the after delivery form. Marines are encouraged to complete their check of all delivered items as soon as possible after delivery to ensure every item that is lost or damaged is clearly identified to the delivery TSP within 180 days. The 180 days after delivery reporting time does not apply to shipments delivered using the Direct Procurement Method (DPM) and local moves in the DPS process. Such moves have 75 days from delivery date to identify loss or damage. Note that the TSP maximum liability for each HHG shipment is 75,000 dollars, but Military Claims Offices can compensate the difference between the TSP maximum and the depreciated value for the remainder of the shipment items not covered by the TSP maximum. Marines who own high dollar items and/or the overall cost to replace the entire HHGs exceeds the TSP maximum may consider private insurance or verify with their homeowner/rental property policy to determine coverage for HHGs when performing a move. A complete and accurate visual inventory of the Marine's personal property (photographic evidence) is key to submission and settlement of any lost and/or damage claim, whether filed with the TSP or the Military Claims office.\n\n7.b. Inconvenience Claims. When HHGs are not picked up or delivered on the agreed upon dates, Marines may qualify to file an Inconvenience Claim with the TSP. Shipments moved under the Direct Procurement Method (DPM) do not qualify for Inconvenience Claims as this time. Download the latest Inconvenience Claim Information Handout from the USMC (slash) USTC Handouts and Brochures link identified in paragraph 11.a. of this MARADMIN.\n\n7.c. Real Property (Residence) Damage Claims. When a TSP damages the residence in any way, Marines may be able to submit a Real Property Damage Claim to the TSP. There is a seven (7) calendar day limit to notify the TSP of the damage to the residence and the TSP must determine repair estimate within 15 days of notification of the damage. To meet deadlines and PCS on time, Marines must be proactive with photographs and notifications to the TSP regarding these damages.\n\n8. Overseas Moves (OCONUS).\n\n8.a. Overseas Suitability Screening (OSS) and OCONUS counseling. Upon receipt of PCS orders to OCONUS locations, each Marine MUST immediately initiate OSS through a Military Medical Treatment Facility for all dependents authorized to accompany the Marine to ensure suitability for OCONUS assignments since the OSS process may take an extended time to complete. In the meantime, Marines should continue to plan to execute their HHG shipment pickup dates while this process is occurring. In the event the orders are modified or canceled, Marines MUST notify the PPSO immediately for further instructions. Additional OCONUS counseling information is also available at https:(slash)(slash) www.militaryonesource.mil/moving-housing/moving/moving-resources/ and the links in paragraph 4.l. of this MARADMIN.\n\n8.b. Marines Traveling Accompanied with Dependents\n\n8.b.1. U.S. Marine Corps PCS Advocacy Council (UPAC, volunteer spouses of Marines) and LPD prepared very detailed checklists for Marines executing a PCS to Japan, Hawaii, and within CONUS that covers everything from travel and passports to scheduling moves and settling claims, plus many additional steps needed to execute a PCS with and without dependents. The checklists can be downloaded by visiting the LPD Public Page for PCS Move Resources website. Information on UPAC support is also provided on the website: https: (slash)(slash)www.iandl.marines.mil/Divisions/Logistics-Division-LP/Logistics-Distribution-Policy-Branch-LPD/PCS-Move-Resources/.\n\n8.b.2. Marines should coordinate with the receiving command-designated sponsor and the Housing Office to determine availability of on-base housing. To obtain the latest status of available housing on Okinawa, Japan contact Housing at DSN 315-634-0582 or kadenahousing.customerservice@us.af.mil.\n\n8.c. Special Issuance Passports (SIP) and Visas. SIPs and Visas may be required for Marines, civilians, and their dependents whenever they travel to OCONUS locations. Reference (a) provides the requirements necessary for entry into a particular country and can be accessed for personnel with a Common Access Card (CAC) at link: https:(slash)(slash)www.fcg.pentagon.mil/fcg.cfm. *NOTE: Official Orders should also state passport requirements. When SIPs/visas are required, applications must be prepared and submitted to a DoD Passport Agent as soon as possible due to an 8–11-week application processing period. DoD Passport Agents may be located within the DMO Passenger Travel Office or other locations aboard the installation.\n\n9. Travel Compliance. Each traveler is responsible to ensure they comply with all travel requirements prior to the departure date from the airport for a commercial flight or from the Aerial Port of Embarkation for AMC-PE flights. Marines should maintain all receipts during travel as many expenses are reimbursable. Marines should contact their supporting Installation Personnel Administration Center or Disbursing Office for more information regarding travel allowances and reimbursement processes. Civilian Marines should contact their supporting Human Resources Office for such information.\n\n10. Excess Baggage on AMC-PE Flights. Marines often travel with excess baggage and as a result must pay out of pocket expenses. Marines will not be reimbursed for this expense unless the excess baggage is identified and authorized in their orders. Excess baggage may also cause the maximum aircraft weight limit to be reached before all the seats are filled. To ensure all passengers can board the aircraft, Marines are normally authorized to have no more than two (2) bags weighing 70 pounds each not to exceed 62 linear inches (sum of length plus width plus height) plus a small carry-on per reserved seat. For further information, contact the local PTO or see the AMC-PE Travel Page at link: https:(slash)(slash)www.amc.af.mil/AMC-Travel-Site/.\n\n11. Transporting Pets\n\n11.a. The key to a successful pet move is early planning and constant follow- through. Marines who are being reassigned to, from or between OCONUS locations are encouraged to immediately visit their local PTO located within the DMO to establish transportation requirements for their pets. Be aware it may take up to six months to complete all the requirements for ensuring pet(s) can be imported to an OCONUS location.\n\n11.b. PCS orders are NOT required to submit reservations for PCS travelers and pets (dogs and cats only) on AMC-PE nor do pets have to be cited within the orders for reimbursement purposes. Because pet reservations will be apportioned on a first come/first served basis, pet transportation needs should be identified to the local PTO as soon as the Marine has a general idea of the required departure month. Reservations will be finalized when AMC schedules the flight on/about 90 days prior to the flight departure date. At that time, pet space requests will be submitted by the PTO. However, because of limited space on the AMC-PE and the flight is available to members of all Services, there is no guarantee of a pet reservation no matter how early a Marine registers a pet movement requirement. Once the Marine completes the PCS Outbound Interview located in Marine Online (MOL), follow up with the PTO is required to finalize all pet travel arrangements.\n\n11.b.1. A Service member on a PCS order with an effective date of January 1, 2024, or later, as defined in Ref (b), may be authorized reimbursement for the costs related to the relocation of one household pet that arises from a permanent change of station. A household pet is a cat or a dog, owned for personal companionship. A Service member is responsible for compliance with all rules for importing and exporting a pet to and from the United States to be eligible for reimbursement. Denial of entry for the pet could result in denial of reimbursement for pet transport expenses. Reimbursement for the actual cost of all pet related transportation expenses is limited to $550 per CONUS PCS move and $2,000 per OCONUS PCS move. A Service member may be authorized the reasonable and substantiated cost of mandatory microchipping, quarantine fees, boarding fees, hotel service charges, licensing fees at the new PDS, testing titer levels for entry, and pet shipping fees if the member flies rather than drives, or the pet is shipped separately from the member. For transoceanic travel, use of Government or Government procured transportation must be used if available or reimbursement for transportation costs is not authorized. Reimbursement for the actual cost of all necessary expenses described above in connection with the movement of one pet to / from / between OCONUS locations is limited to $2,000 per PCS move.\n\n11.b.2. The government contracted AMC-PE rotator flights offer a discounted rate (ranging from 125 dollars to 375 dollars depending on pet weight) to transport pets. However, the number of pet spaces per flight is very limited. The maximum weight allowed for a combined pet and kennel is 150 pounds, which cannot be waived. Marines are responsible for obtaining an authorized kennel/carrier bolted with metal nuts/bolts that provides adequate ventilation and ample space for safe pet movement. Soft-sided pet kennels / carriers may be accepted for in-cabin movement only. See the AMC Pet Travel Information Page at https:(slash)(slash) www.amc.af.mil/AMC-Travel-Site/AMC-Pet-Travel-Page/ then click on AMC Pet Pamphlet 20 October 2023 or later date when updated on the website.\n\n11.c. Emotional Support Animals and Service Animals. The U.S. Department of Transportation revised its Air Carrier Access Act (ACAA) regulation on the transportation of Service Animals by air. This final rule defines a Service Animal as a dog, regardless of breed or type, that is individually trained for the benefit of a qualified individual. It allows airlines to recognize Emotional Support Animals as pets, rather than Service Animals, and permits airlines to limit the number of Service Animals that one passenger can bring onboard an aircraft to two Service Animals. Please find more information concerning this matter at: https:(slash)(slash) www.transportation.gov/briefing-room/us-department-transportation-announces-final-rule-traveling-air-service-animals. Review the procedures for Service Animals currently posted on the AMC Travel Page or contact the local PTO for the current policy related to Service Animals and AMC-PE transportation.\n\n11.d. Other Options for Moving Pets. Options include services offered by regularly scheduled commercial airlines, including both US and Foreign Flag-carriers (NOTE: you cannot legally be reimbursed if using a Foreign Flag carrier for transport of your pet), and dedicated pet relocation services. Regardless of the method, all pets traveling to or returning from OCONUS require a health certificate from a certified veterinarian. The animal health screening process may include several visits to the veterinarian, a quarantine period, and shots which may take at least six months prior to the expected travel date to complete. The following website provides helpful information and guidelines to consider when traveling with a pet followed by direct links to each of the City Pair Program's participating airline carrier's pet and service animal policy for your convenience: https:(slash)(slash) www.gsa.gov/travel/plan-book/transportation-airfare-pov-etc/airfare-rates-city-pairs-programs/resource-library/airline-pet-policy.\n\n11.e.
