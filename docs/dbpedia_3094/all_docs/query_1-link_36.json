The Auto Craft Centers make it easy and affordable for you to perform regular maintenance on your vehicles by providing space, equipment, and instruction. Skilled staff members are on site and will answer technical questions and guide you through your self-service projects.\n\nMost garrisons have Auto Craft Centers where, for a minimal hourly or flat fee, youâ€™ll find just about everything you need. We have more than 2,500 indoor and outdoor work bays available worldwide. They come equipped with vehicle lifts, a broad selection of tools and state-of-the-art equipment including online diagnostic databases, which include vehicle specific wiring diagrams, maintenance information, labor estimates, technical service bulletins, and recalls.\n\nWe have mechanics available that are certified by the National Institute for Automotive Service. Our staff offer a variety of classes: safety orientation, equipment usage, and classes for specialty groups (i.e. basic auto maintenance and emergency readiness for Family Readiness Groups (FRGs).\n\nThe Auto Skills program supports HIRED, a teen apprentice program that employs eligible Army teens.\n\nWe stock many items in our shop at discount prices. Everything from motor oil to brake cleaner, oil filters to hose clamps. We also have partnerships with the local auto parts stores Advance Auto Parts, Auto Zone and O'Reilly's Auto Parts. If you need a part or a tool we can call and have it delivered to the shop ASAP."
