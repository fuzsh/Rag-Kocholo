Do it.\n\nYa got a new song you wanna try? Come on.\n\nWhy do you like that song? What about it makes you feel good? Or makes you feel sad? Or makes you feel…oh Feelings!!\n\nAre you an actor who’s working on a new monologue? Perhaps brush off the dust to an old one?\n\nCome try.\n\nPerhaps you are a writer who has a new scene for that screen play youve been working on, and you’d like to hear it out loud? Bring it. I’ll help you cast it!\n\nAre you an instrumentalist who has a story to share about a piece that has moved you? Come share.\n\nComedians: trying out some new stuff?\n\nDo it!\n\nAre you an improv group and looking for a 1/2 hour to do your thang!? Come on!\n\nHow bout you?\n\nYou avant-garde neon light Hula Hooper just back from Burning Man, being your unicyclist friend and do your thing!\n\nWith Foreign Objectz @HopsScotch\n\nI’m hoping to curate and cultivate a night that uses a variety of artists who want to share…something, almost anything.\n\nIf you are or know someone who wants to share send them our way!\n\nIf perhaps you or they are reticent to share- well that’s normal.\n\nTrust when I say, it’ll be a welcoming room. All are welcome to share, or not share. Perhaps just listen and get a lay of the land.\n\nIf you do perform, or share-\n\nI may ask some questions about the piece and why you find it interesting in the attempt to build connection between the performer and the room. Sometimes the piece may speak for itself, sometimes, perhaps not.\n\nThis will be an open mic, an invitational, it may involve live music and or improv: im hoping for a variety for sure.\n\nTruth be told I’m not certain what will be chiseled out, but I know I’d like to work on some things, and surround myself with those who’s dreams are still entact, dormant as they may be…\n\nAt the very least here’s how you can participate:\n\nBring an album. Yes a VINYL Record.\n\nPick a song, and I’ll play it. Perhaps you can share why it means so much to you.\n\nEvery week I’ll have my humble record player there, and we will have a ‘grown up’s Music Show and Tell’\n\nIf interested in showing, sharing, or playing: please Contact righteous jolly\n\nAt\n\nForeignObjectsRJ@gmail.com\n\nForeign Objectz\n\nAn Open Mic Predicated on storytelling.\n\nYa got a story?\n\nYou wanna work it out in front of a crowd?\n\nCome share it.\n\nYou want to get something off your chest?
