        "text": "‚ÄúMoney motivation‚Äù is a great driver for tech sellers, but the pursuit of money alone will leave you feeling unfulfilled and empty inside. Here‚Äôs why (and 5 examples from my own life): Most sellers I know chose to pursue a sales career because of the unlimited earning potential. But because of this sales is a difficult, stressful profession. We are constantly riding a roller coaster of emotions with the pressure to perform year after year. In order to persevere through the day to day challenges and obstacles which working in sales presents, we must have a clear idea of WHY we are selling. Without a strong WHY, most salespeople will not give their all and show up fully every day which impacts performance. And money motivation alone is very poor WHY. The best salespeople have a very clear vision, purpose, income goal, and idea of what they will do with the money once they get it. They also reset their WHY every year so they stay motivated and hungry. When money is mapped to our goals and purpose, this is positive money motivation. Here are a few examples from my own career: 1. Making enough money so my wife Sandy could be a full time mom and care for our son, who is on the Autism spectrum 2. Buying our dream house in a neighborhood with great schools 3. Using commissions to invest in real estate so that we could have passive income stream and long term financial freedom 4. Being able to travel frequently and create amazing memories with our family. 5. Show others what‚Äôs possible in sales and inspire them to give it their all every day! When money motivation is mapped to serving and providing for others, it can be hugely motivating over a sustained period. When money is mapped solely to acquiring material goods, showing off to others, or making us feel worthy, this is much less motivating and will feel like a constant grind without purpose.\n\nDon't waste your time negotiating your sales bonus. Why? You will rarely achieve it. When you do one year, the year after you likely miss it. You sales bonus is part of your work contract. The way you negotiate it says a lot about the way you are perceived by your employer. If you can't negotiate a good deal, How are you expected to close sales on someone else's behalf? A lot of employers like to pay salespeople as little as possible but then when they don't deliver they get upset and start creating all sorts of strategies before sacking them. My point? Employers use bonuses to lure salespeople into jobs that could earn them a lot of money if one goal is achieved. Then the business will generate enough cash to pay: ‚Ä¢ investors ‚Ä¢ banks ‚Ä¢ execs wages ‚Ä¢ execs bonuses ‚Ä¢ execs Christmas dinners ‚Ä¢ taxes and other expenses Then they will pay sakes bonuses. Instead focus on a good basic salary that is comfortable for the next 2 years or so. You need to take account that your expenses will grow. This is life. The moral. You will never get rich working for somebody else, all you need to know is that your job is like lifting weights. It is a paid practise that will help you develop skills that can help you when you move jobs or start your own business. Don't focus on the money you will never make, focus on the skills you can acquire and the mistakes you will make that will help you grow in business and in your private life. I would like to know in the comments, if you value more your basic salary or your bonus. Follow me (& hit that üîî) to see more, I post daily. P.S Repost/save this if you found this useful ‚ôªÔ∏è\n\nAre you a 'commission' is a cost type of company? Or a 'commission' is an incentive type of company? The one above see's commission or other non salary reward as an addition to the cost of sales ONLY, as opposed to that little bit of psychology that might push the sales effort past the winning post. Those people think that reducing that commission cost by 10% improves the bottom line - as clearly sales would bring that money in as a matter of course! The more progressive thinkers understand that the fun and games of incentives, and yes, the overage commissions and ridiculous amounts that sales people can earn make up for the following 'cultural issues'. The pressure of the whole company success being on their shoulders Being told NO over and over again, every day Every week Every quarter Every year! Being blamed by management for underachieving Being criticised for over achieving Having the rest of the business think that all they do is swan about making loads of cash And thinking that they could do the job better And thinking its not fair that they make all that money And getting the blame (or taking the blame) with the customer when things go wrong And not being able to rely on the delivery team to get things right And spending more time on small deals than big ones And only talking to your boss when things are going wrong.... On its day, sales is the BEST job in the world, but its also one of the hardest (proper jobs like doctors aside) Here's a thought, if you want to earn the money sales do, take a target and go for it. No? Thought not! What else does your commission payment make up for in your job?\n\n‚ö†Ô∏è Controversial Commission Sales Post ‚ö†Ô∏è Sales can be a hard world to break into. If you are looking to get into it and the only options available are commission only jobs, here are my thoughts: They are usually in mortgages, insurance, real estate etc. Find a small boutique firm without all the marketing, glitz and wild claims that they close the most out of anyone else in the industry. Yes the large firm might close the most because they have the biggest team, but per person how many deals do they close a year? A small firm may still not have that base salary you dreamed of but you will be a lot closer to the action, you will work directly under the boss and you'll be handed real opportunities to close a deal, coached along the way, invested in, and not cold calling all day to blocked numbers. what do you think? (FYI we have some great boutique firms always looking for sales people if this post for you going üòâ)\n\nSo one of the things that drives me absolutely CRAZY is when salespeople come to me with ‚Äòmoney issues.‚Äô Meaning salespeople who are not exactly successful at what they‚Äôre doing right now‚Ä¶ And looking for ways to make more money. ‚Ä¶and hey I GET IT - you are looking for ways to increase your income and decrease your hours worked‚Ä¶ Isn‚Äôt everybody? But one of my biggest pet peeves and one of the WORST things you can possibly do for yourself is tell me this: ‚ÄúDavid, I love the systems, love the leads, and really feel aligned with this gig‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶let me first just pick up a side job to generate some side income so I don‚Äôt have to worry about money.‚Äù No. THIS IS WRONG. Don‚Äôt you get it? You‚Äôre thinking that way because you can‚Äôt just commit to ONE thing and believe that ONE thing can pay you BIG paychecks. What you need is someone to sell to‚Ä¶ A service. A product. And most importantly proof that people selling what you‚Äôre selling can make good money. Does the company you‚Äôre at have that? Yes - good. No? Keep searching. If you can simply commit to sales‚Ä¶ You can make great MONEY and never have to worry about a job again. Winning is easy. Don‚Äôt make it hard. Never Settle!\n\nAre you a 'commission' is a cost type of company? Or a 'commission' is an incentive type of company?

No? Thought not! What else does your commission payment make up for in your job?\n\nWhy Sales People Get Paid The Most! Let me tell you a story about a brother I know who outshone everybody during the first year in his 9-5 job... His managers said that no one has performed in the manner that he had... So he thought it was time to ask for a pay rise. He was on a ¬£25k/year salary so he had to bring in ¬£75k/year in contracts otherwise NO pay rise, which the brother said was a very difficult task to do. The manager told him that if you bring in 3x your worth in sales, then you can command a pay rise. And this makes COMPLETE sense. It's all about the money. It's not about how much of a great worker you are, if you're not bringing in enough for the business, you won't be able to step up to the next tier of pay in most cases. You work for a business at the end of the day. This is why SALES PEOPLE get paid the most. They BRING IN the most for the company so they get compensated the most. And I've found a way where you can earn a whole load of money as an ETHICAL sales person who just helps people make buying decisions (no cold calling, prospecting, manipulation or high pressure sales)... It's called 'High Ticket Closing' or 'Remote Closing' All you do is take sales calls with prospects who are already interested in the product/service you're selling. They are booked into your calendar and they come on to the call looking for help to make a buying decision. It's performance based & you earn a commission for each sale you make. If you bring in ¬£50,000 cash collected in a month for a business, you will earn 10-20% of that (¬£5,000-¬£10,000) in that month. After a few months in this industry, I made enough to quit my job then after a period of time, I made ¬£10k+/month. The best thing is you're working for businesses that NEED you. This skill is in such high demand right now and if you're someone who can dedicate your time to mastering this skill, you will be able to quadruple your current income within a short space of time. Stop waiting for pay rises, which, let's face it, only add on a few hundred pounds a month to your take home pay lol - what's the point in working for so hard and so long to do that? There is a whole NEW WORLD out there where you can earn a living online. You don't have to rely on the 9-5 if you don't want to. And you can even do this alongside your 9-5 too! Alhamdulillah. - Shohaib\n\nSo one of the things that drives me absolutely CRAZY is when salespeople come to me with ‚Äòmoney issues.‚Äô Meaning salespeople who are not exactly successful at what they‚Äôre doing right now‚Ä¶ And looking for ways to make more money. ‚Ä¶and hey I GET IT - you are looking for ways to increase your income and decrease your hours worked‚Ä¶ Isn‚Äôt everybody?
