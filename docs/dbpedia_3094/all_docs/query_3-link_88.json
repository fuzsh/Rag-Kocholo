        "text": "New York Times and USA Today bestselling author L. P. Dover is a southern belle living in North Carolina with her husband and two beautiful girls. Everything’s sweeter in the South has always been her mantra and she lives by it, whether it’s with her writing or in her everyday life. Maybe that’s why she’s seriously addicted to chocolate.\n\nDover has written countless novels in several different genres, including a children’s book with her daughter. Her favorite to write is romantic suspense, but she’s also found a passion in romantic comedy. She loves to make people laugh which is why you’ll never see her without a smile on her face.\n\nYou can find L.P. Dover here:\n\nWebsite: www.lpdover.com\n\nEmail: authorlpdover@gmail.com\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/lpdover\n\nBe sure to sign up for L.P.
