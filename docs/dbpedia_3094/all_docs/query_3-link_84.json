Graph visualization is a way of representing structural information as diagrams of abstract graphs and networks. It has important applications in networking, bioinformatics, software engineering, database and web design, machine learning, and in visual interfaces for other technical domains.\n\nFeatures\n\nThe Graphviz layout programs take descriptions of graphs in a simple text language, and make diagrams in useful formats, such as images and SVG for web pages; PDF or Postscript for inclusion in other documents; or display in an interactive graph browser. Graphviz has many useful features for concrete diagrams, such as options for colors, fonts, tabular node layouts, line styles, hyperlinks, and custom shapes.\n\nDownload\n\nThe current release of Graphviz can be downloaded here: Download The code base is stored here on GitLab.\n\nDocumentation\n\nDocumentation is available in the released package and from here: Documentation\n\nDiscussions\n\nYou can post questions and comments in the Graphviz forum.\n\nBug And Issue Tracking\n\nYou can report or view Graphviz bugs and issues by visiting the Graphviz Issues page."
