And it always bums me out. ——— Sellers, please take this advice: Don’t feel bad for doing your job. You don’t need to apologize for attempting to pique my interest in your solution. What you do need to do is research me and my company. Understand what’s most top of mind for me and what problems I’m facing. Then show me how your solution can solve those problems. If you’re intentional with your outreach, if you show me you understand my universe, and if you can resonate with things that are top of mind, then you have nothing to apologize for. You're critical to driving revenue for you company. Don't lose sight of that fact. ✊ #sales #sdr #revenue"
