        "text": "EDI message standards define all EDI transactions. It is vital to have proper governance processes for data quality. When information is missing or in the wrong place, the EDI document might not be processed correctly.\n\nStandards are the basis of EDI conversations.¹ Several organizations define the EDI message standards, including ODETTE, TRADACOMS, GS1, Peppol and the Accredited Standard Committee X12 (ASC X12).\n\nIn general, EDI transmission has 2 basic types:\n\nPoint-to-point or direct connections: Two computers or systems connect with no intermediary over the internet, generally with secure protocols.\n\nValue-added network (VAN): A third-party network manages data transmission, generally with a mailboxing paradigm.\n\nEDI internet transmission protocols include Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP), Applicability Statement 2 or AS2, an HTTPS-based protocol, Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) and others. EDI data elements include items such as sender ID and receiver ID. Data segments combine two or more related elements to give them greater meaning. For example, FNAME and LNAME can combine to form CUSTOMERNAME. Envelopes structure different types of data and carry the sender and receiver address information. EDI document flow or message flow describes the movement of EDI messages to various inbound and outbound addresses and departments to execute a business process or transaction.²\n\nMetalanguages such as Extensible Markup Language (XML) or JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) complement EDI rather than replace it. Companies must be ready to handle an ever-increasing number of document formats and transmission options. One global manufacturer routinely exchanges about 55 different document types with nearly 2,000 partners.\n\n“As many as 20% of our B2B transactions were producing an error before we began using IBM® Supply Chain Business Network. We have fewer errors now, for example, we used to have issues with transfer orders because a client would submit a wrong code, which was painful for our client service team. It happens probably 80% less now because all of that used to be done manually.” Read what other EDI managers tell IDC about how they drive strategic value with IBM Sterling Supply Chain Business Network.\n\nFor some enterprises, EDI can be difficult to implement. One reason is the need to keep pace with shifting government regulations, standards and updates. It is also inherently complex, as it needs to accommodate the complexities of global business needs. For example, each trading partner in a B2B network can present individual requirements. Many organizations outsource EDI solutions due to unique formatting criteria.\n\nWhether in-house or outsourced, there are some basic conditions, capabilities and resources that are needed to implement EDI effectively. In addition to factors such as agreement on document types, secure transmission methods and necessary hardware and software, an effective EDI implementation should consider:\n\nTranslation or mapping software\n\nThis type of transformation software takes fields such as names, addresses, currency amounts, part numbers and quantities, and maps them from business application formats into standardized documents and vice versa.\n\nBatch enveloping or de-enveloping capabilities\n\nThese capabilities support large EDI message batches by enabling senders and receivers to wrap and unwrap transactions. The transactions can then be grouped from or split into several divisions or areas of a trading associate’s business.\n\nMessage routing mechanisms\n\nAfter a message is de-enveloped, routing mechanisms are required to sort the messages for different groups and deliver them to the appropriate targets. Message transformation may also be required to get the message into the correct format for its destination.\n\nTrading partner agreements (TPA)\n\nTPA clarifies terms and conditions, establishes standards for business documents and defines communications and business protocols between trading partners."
