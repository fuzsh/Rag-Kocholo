        "text": "Riddley Walker by Russell Hoban\n\nNovember 4, 2015 6:33 AM - by Russell Hoban - Subscribe\n\nInspired by the medieval wall painting of the legend of Saint Eustace at Canterbury Cathedral, and utilizing a made-up language filled with double meanings and puns, Russell Hoban’s 1981 story of a newly come of age boy in a post-nuclear England is widely admired by readers, critics, and authors. Gather round and share your experiences reading this especially striking apocalyptic tale!\n\nThere is a lot online that is easily googled about both Hoban and Riddley. Hoban wrote some beloved children’s books (Bread and Jam for Frances) and some somewhat lesser known genre-bending adult books - Riddley Walker is undoubtedly the most famous. An American who lived most of his adult life in England, he seemed to write mostly from an English point of view, and Riddley centrally features England's specific geography.\n\nThere are endless links about the book and Hoban at the end of this page, including interviews with Hoban. Here we find a long set of annotations. (I found the notes on places especially helpful.) This article is, well, pedantic as all get out, but it did help explain some stuff about the plot that I hadn’t been able to follow, and also attempts to break down the 'rules' of Riddley Speak.\n\nAbout FanFare\n\nFanFare is a pop culture discussion site for TV, movies, podcasts, and books.
