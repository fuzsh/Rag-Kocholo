Hoban's novel of a post-apocalyptic Kent, set 2,000 years after a nuclear war, sees iron-age level societies fighting for scraps of knowledge, technology, and language. What survives of culture is a bizarre (but utterly believable) melange of Punch and Judy shows, the life of St Eustace, and nuclear myth. Written in a weird Chaucerian English drawn from his experiences as a teacher in Kent and his childhood in suburban Pennsylvania, Hoban alleged that it destroyed his ability to spell - words are mangled, degraded, and re-formed. An astonishing feat of imagination. Anthony Burgess said that while it 'could not expect to be popular. it seems to me a permanent contribution to literature'.\n\nHardcover. Condition: Very Good+.
