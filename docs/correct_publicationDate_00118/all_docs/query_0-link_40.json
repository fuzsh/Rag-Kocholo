        "text": "By of the\n\nRussell Hoban, who died this week in England at 86, wrote one of the best post-apocalyptic novels ever, and some fine children's books. Now that is some range.\n\nHis children's books about a family of badgers, \"Bread and Jam for Frances\" and \"A Birthday for Frances,\" were in heavy rotation at our house when the Recommended Reading teens were littler. (Particularly \"Bread and Jam,\" about a fussy eater, as we had one of those in our house, and always read that tale with extra relish.)\n\nOf the many adult novels he wrote, his unquestioned masterpiece is \"Riddley Walker\" (1980). In 2006, I wrote an appreciation of the novel for a special project on the pleasures of difficult books. In tribute to Hoban, and in the hope that it might encourage a few of you to try the novel, I'm reposting that piece here.\n\nWalk along with Riddley Walker through the feral wasteland of post-apocalyptic England:\n\n\"On my naming day when I come 12 I gone front spear and kilt a wyld boar he parbly ben the las wyld pig on the Bundel Downs any how there hadnt ben none for a long time befor him nor I aint looking to see none agen. He dint make the groun shake nor nothing like that when he come on to my spear he wernt all that big plus he lookit poorly. He done the reqwyrt he ternt and stood and clattert his teef and made his rush and there we wer then. Him on 1 end of the spear kicking his life out and me on the other end watching him dy. I said, ‘Your tern now my tern later.’ \"\n\nIf that looks like gibberish to you, read it aloud. It becomes clearer.\n\nSome books (take a bow, \"Finnegans Wake\") demand that you be a genius to read them. But \"Riddley Walker\" only asks that you, dear reader, be like young Riddley himself: clever, open-minded, a little bit mystical, and persistent.\n\nRiddley is a young hunter-gatherer in a future Iron Age, thousands of years after some unspeakable atomic horror. In this dangerous landscape he watches his father die, comes of age, discovers a relic of the distant past and leaves the modest security of his tribe for a greater destiny. Author Russell Hoban began this tale in ordinary English. But as he went along, he has told interviewers, he drifted into a degraded language that mirrors Riddley’s debased world. This Riddleyspeak worked, Hoban has written, because \"it slows the reader down to Riddley’s rate of comprehension.\"\n\nAs a mystic might say, when the reader is ready, the book appears. I’d been aware of this novel, and its glowing reputation, since it was published in the U.S. decades ago. Other writers I respect have pointed back to it. Taking it up has reconnected me with a younger self who had the nerve (if not the required wisdom) to grapple with \"Ulysses\" and \"Gravity’s Rainbow.\" To get better at chess or tennis, you have to play better opponents. It’s the same with literature: To read a challenging, ambitious novel, however ineptly, is to partake of its magic and become a more powerful person.\n\n\"Riddley Walker\" is more than a language experiment; it is an immersion in another world that Hoban has fashioned by tinkering with the atomic and sub-atomic levels of fiction — words and syllables. Its richness and its difficulty come from the same source. It is a trudge with spear in hand, taking pleasure where it can be found, eyes open for game and for enemies.\n\nRiddley’s tribe earns \"comping station\" (compensation) by prying iron artifacts out of the ground; the reader, too, must earn knowledge by digging out the meaning of Hoban’s puns, neologisms and folk etymologies. Riddley is a \"connexion man,\" a workaday seer who knits together the deeper meaning of events; the reader is also called on to make connections, to grasp, for example, how Hoban has grafted a myth of atomic destruction on top of the medieval legend of St. Eustace and the stag. Clever as he is, Riddley’s understanding is always partial, never complete. So, too, is the reader’s.\n\nIn the slowness with which it must be absorbed, \"Riddley Walker\" is also a startling throwback to the oral tradition of storytelling. Riddley tells, cites and learns the handed-down tales of his culture, and invents at least one of his own. These stories of Eusa and the 1 Big 1, the on-the-spot \"tels\" given by Riddley and the wise woman Lorna, even the violent Punch and Judy puppet shows (which serve a surprisingly serious purpose in Riddley’s era) reflect an instinctual human hunger to account for the difficulties of life and to understand the incomprehensible past.\n\n\"Why is Punch crookit?\" Riddley asks. \"Why wil he all ways kil the babby if he can? Parbly I wont never know its jus on me to think on it.\""
