Weve come way way down from what they ben time back way back. May be it wer the barms what done it poysening the lan or when they made a hoal in what they callit the O Zoan.” In this deeply imagined work, the narrator, Riddley Walker, gallantly struggles to figure out the koans of soul and the purpose of life. His is a feral existence in a post-Armageddon world. A vague collective memory of civilization (as we know it) taunts him and his fellow hunters, with the legend of St. Eustace, martyr saint of hunters, plaguing his bafflements. Part of the spell—a sort of black enchantment—lies in Hoban’s specially concocted, purely phonetic language; to be comprehended it almost needs to be read aloud, yet its childlike freshness constantly overturns assumptions of meaning. Although the story line (and therefore the interest) peaks too early, Riddley Walker is an eerily powerful, bewitching book.\n\n Julia Ehresmann"
