For further information on his life and career, see CLR, Volumes 3 and 69.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nEqually respected as a writer and illustrator of children's stories and adult novels, Hoban is known for the wit and elegance of his imaginative portrayals of modern life. Although Hoban has originated several well-known characters in children's literature, including Charlie the Tramp, Emmet Otter, the Mouse, his Child, and Manny Rat, he is especially recognized for a series of bedtime picture books about an anthropomorphic badger named Frances, a series which began with Bedtime for Frances (1960). While the Frances books have attracted a wide audience since their first publication in the early 1960s, Hoban's fantasy novel The Mouse and His Child (1967) won the author his greatest critical acclaim to date, with many scholars hailing the juvenile novel as a modern children's classic. Following the publication of The Mouse and His Child, Hoban shifted his writing toward older audiences with several well-received novels, most notably Riddley Walker (1980), a highly acclaimed novel set in the distant future after a twentieth-century nuclear holocaust.\n\nBIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION\n\nNamed after Temple University founder Russell Conwell, Hoban was born on February 4, 1925, in Lansdale, Pennsylvania, to Abram and Jeanette Hoban. His parents were Ukrainian immigrants, and his father, the advertising manager for The Jewish Daily Forward, directed Yiddish classics and socially-driven American plays in his spare time. As a child, Hoban demonstrated artistic talent which his parents strongly fostered, believing his future lay in the arts. After studying at the Philadelphia Museum School of Industrial Art and Temple University, he enlisted in the Army during World War II and served as a radio operator in the Italian and Asian campaigns where he earned a Bronze Star. Hoban married Lillian Aberman in 1944, with whom he would have four children. Upon his release from the military in 1945, Hoban worked as an illustrator and art director for various art studios and advertising firms in New York until 1957, when he decided to become a freelance journalist and illustrator. His work during this period appeared in various magazines, including cover art for Sports Illustrated, The Saturday Evening Post, and Time. In 1959 he released his first book, What Does It Do and How Does It Work, which featured Hoban's sketches of construction equipment that he has been composing in his free time. In 1960 he published the first of his Frances the Badger books with Bedtime for Frances. While developing a reputation as a children's author, Hoban still maintained a professional career, working variously as a copywriter and art instructor at the Famous Artists Schools in Westport, Connecticut, and the School of Visual Arts in New York. After publishing more than a dozen children's books—many illustrated by his wife—Hoban decided to become a full-time author. He moved with his family to London in 1969, though his wife Lillian soon returned to America with their children and the couple divorced in 1975. Hoban was later remarried to Gundula Ahl, with whom he has three children. The success of 1967's The Mouse and His Child, Hoban's first full-length juvenile novel, buoyed his confidence in his writing, and he released his first novel for adults, The Lion of Boaz-Jachin and Jachin-Boaz, in 1973 to mostly positive reviews.\n\nMAJOR WORKS\n\nHoban's early career is noted for his successful picture books, which have been praised for their engaging depictions of ordinary childhood dilemmas and endearing, childlike animal characters. Drawing inspiration from his own four children, Hoban developed the character Frances the Badger, who embodies such childhood emotions as bedtime fears, jealousy, and self-determination. Despite the positive reception of his picture books and the Frances books, in particular, critics were unprepared for the powerful impact of Hoban's fantasy novel The Mouse and His Child. Initially ignored by American critics, The Mouse and His Child gained great popularity in England and has since become a cult classic among preteens and adolescents. The picaresque story recounts the adventures of two wind-up toy mice who are discarded from a toyshop. Ill equipped for the baffling, threatening world into which they are tossed, the mouse and his child innocently confront the world's inherent treachery, violence, the unknown, and their own fears. The book explores not only the transience and inconstancy of life but the struggle to persevere as well.\n\nWith The Lion of Boaz-Jachin and Jachin-Boaz and Kleinzeit (1974), Hoban began to write allegorical novels specifically for a more mature audience, although he retained the magical and bizarre worlds of his children's stories. Consistent throughout his adult novels is Hoban's search for the patterns that make life significant—and this often in the face of a threatening, desolate, or near mad world. Hoban's prose style, markedly individual, unique, and often humorous, is a linguistic match for his metaphysical themes. Nominated as the most distinguished book of fiction by the National Book Critics Circle and for the Nebula Award for Science Fiction Writers of America, Hoban's Riddley Walker received the John W. Campbell Memorial Award from the Science Fiction Research Association as the year's best science fiction novel. Riddley Walker imagines a world and civilization decades after a nuclear holocaust; the story of what remains is narrated in a fragmented, phonetical English by a twelve-year-old boy struggling to comprehend the past so that its magnificence might be recaptured. A popular work among young adult readers, Riddley Walker is often compared with other contemporary works such as Anthony Burgess's A Clockwork Orange, John Gardner's Grendel, and the works of William Golding, as well as with Mark Twain's Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. While the novel's philosophical themes, which explore such issues as humankind's continued existence on Earth and the potential destructiveness of technology, are of primary interest to its readers, the inventiveness of Hoban's language used throughout the narrative is most often discussed by commentators.\n\nCRITICAL RECEPTION\n\nHoban has enjoyed widespread critical appreciation for his works for both older and younger readers. Christine Wilkie has argued that, \"Russell Hoban is one of few contemporary writers of literature for children, who is in the process of challenging the conventions by which the genre has become recognized, and in which the child has become inscribed … It invites them to be child enough to be themselves, to make of it whatever they want it to be, and to find in it whatever helps them to experience the actuality behind the appearance of things.\" While reviewers have generally praised his early picture books for their appealing protagonists and genteel storylines, Hoban's greatest critical success to date has been his novel The Mouse and His Child. Margaret and Michael Rustin have complimented the novel for \"succeed[ing] in representing and integrating an extraordinary range and depth of feelings, concluding with a happy outcome which is perhaps especially appropriate for young readers considering the extreme fears that this demanding story is likely to evoke in them.\" Similarly, the Booklist review of The Mouse and His Child has labelled the text an \"intricate but skillfully executed fantasy [that] chronicles the hazardous and heroic adventures of a broken windup mouse child and his father in search of happiness and security.\" Riddley Walker has also endured as one of the critical highlights of Hoban's career, though some scholars have argued whether the novel is appropriate for the teen and young adult readers who have co-opted the text as their own. Paul Brians has called Riddley Walker \"one of the finest of all post-holocaust novels,\" and the Sunday Times review of the novel has asserted that, \"Riddley Walker is told in language that attempts the impossible and achieves it.\"\n\nPRINCIPAL WORKS\n\nJuvenile Nonfiction\n\nWhat Does It Do and How Does It Work?: Power Shovel, Dump Truck, and Other Heavy Machines [as author and illustrator] (juvenile nonfiction) 1959\n\nThe Atomic Submarine: A Practice Combat Patrol under the Sea [as author and illustrator] (juvenile nonfiction) 1960\n\nJuvenile Novels\n\nThe Mouse and His Child [illustrations by Lillian Hoban] (juvenile novel) 1967; new edition illustrations by David Small, 2001\n\nThe Trokeville Way (juvenile novel) 1996\n\nChildren's Poetry\n\nThe Pedalling Man and Other Poems [illustrations by Lillian Hoban] (children's poetry) 1968; new edition, 1990\n\nEgg Thoughts and Other Frances Songs [illustrations by Lillian Hoban] (children's poetry) 1972\n\nThe Last of the Wallendas and Other Poems [illustrations by Patrick Benson] (children's poetry) 1997\n\nPicture Books\n\nBedtime for Frances [illustrations by Garth Williams] (picture book) 1960\n\nHerman the Loser [illustrations by Lillian Hoban] (picture book) 1961\n\nThe Song in My Drum [illustrations by Lillian Hoban] (picture book) 1962\n\nLondon Men and English Men [illustrations by Lillian Hoban] (picture book) 1963\n\nSome Snow Said Hello [with Lillian Hoban] (picture book) 1963\n\nA Baby Sister for Frances [illustrations by Lillian Hoban] (picture book) 1964\n\nBread and Jam for Frances [illustrations by Lillian Hoban] (picture book) 1964\n\nNothing to Do [illustrations by Lillian Hoban] (picture book) 1964\n\nThe Sorely Trying Day [illustrations by Lillian Hoban] (picture book) 1964\n\nThe Story of Hester Mouse Who Became a Writer and Saved Most of Her Sisters and Brothers and Some of Her Aunts and Uncles from the Owl [illustrations by Lillian Hoban] (picture book) 1965\n\nTom and the Two Handles [illustrations by Lillian Hoban] (picture book) 1965\n\nWhat Happened When Jack and Daisy Tried to Fool the Tooth Fairies [illustrations by Lillian Hoban] (picture book) 1965\n\nCharlie the Tramp [illustrations by Lillian Hoban] (picture book) 1966\n\nGoodnight [illustrations by Lillian Hoban] (picture book) 1966\n\nHenry and the Monstrous Din [illustrations by Lillian Hoban] (picture book) 1966\n\nThe Little Brute Family [illustrations by Lillian Hoban] (picture book) 1966\n\nSave My Place [with Lillian Hoban] (picture book) 1967\n\nThe Stone Doll of Sister Brute [illustrations by Lillian Hoban] (picture book) 1968\n\nBest Friends for Frances [illustrations by Lillian Hoban] (picture book) 1969; new edition, 1994\n\nA Birthday for Frances [illustrations by Lillian Hoban] (picture book) 1969\n\nEmmet Otter's Jug-Band Christmas [illustrations by Lillian Hoban] (picture book) 1969\n\nHarvey's Hideout [illustrations by Lillian Hoban] (picture book) 1969\n\nThe Mole Family's Christmas [illustrations by Lillian Hoban] (picture book) 1969\n\nUgly Bird [illustrations by Lillian Hoban] (picture book) 1969\n\nA Bargain for Frances [illustrations by Lillian Hoban] (picture book) 1970\n\nThe Sea-Thing Child [illustrations by Abrom Hoban] (picture book) 1972; new edition illustrated by Patrick Benson, 1999\n\nLetitia Rabbit's String Song [illustrations by Mary Chalmers] (picture book) 1973\n\nHow Tom Beat Captain Najork and His Hired Sportsmen [illustrations by Quentin Blake] (picture book) 1974\n\nTen What?: A Mystery Counting Book [illustrations by Sylvie Selig] (picture book) 1974\n\nCrocodile and Pierrot: A See the Story Book [illustrations by Sylvie Selig] (picture book) 1975\n\nDinner at Alberta's [illustrations by James Marshall] (picture book) 1975\n\nA Near Thing for Captain Najork [illustrations by Quentin Blake] (picture book) 1975\n\nThe Twenty-Elephant Restaurant [illustrations by Emily Arnold McCully] (picture book) 1977\n\nArthur's New Power [illustrations by Byron Barton] (picture book) 1978\n\nThe Dancing Tigers [illustrations by David Gentlemen] (picture book) 1979\n\nLa Corona and the Tin Frog [illustrations by Nicola Bayley] (picture book) 1979\n\nAce Dragon Ltd.

Rutherford, N.J.: Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 1989.\n\n[In the following essay, Wilkie suggests that Hoban's canon of children's books evolve from the structured, gentle universe of his early novels to a more carefree child-oriented philosophy in his later works.]\n\nOf his children's writing Hoban is probably best known for his Frances stories. Written over a period of ten years between 1960 and 1970, they tell about the daily happenings in the life of Frances, a badger with shrewd intelligence, vivid imagination, and tenacious self-will. She first appeared as a badger with bedphobia in Bedtime for Frances (1960) and has since been joined by a sister, Gloria, in A Baby Sister for Frances (1964), who is the object of Frances's jealousy. In Bread and Jam for Frances (1964), she is subjected to bread-and-jam exposure as a cure for being difficult about what she will and will not eat with the family. And she has subsequently celebrated Gloria's second birthday in A Birthday for Frances (1968); made friends with Albert and Gloria in Best Friends for Frances (1969); and finally, she strikes a bargain over a tea set in A Bargain for Frances (1970). These stories are minutely observed and sensitively written, with gentle humor. The jingles and rhymes that appear in the series have been collected in a separate book of verse, Egg Thoughts and Other Frances Songs (1972). In 1987, with fifty-three published titles on his children's list (excluding The Mouse and His Child, 1967), Hoban has reported them to be his most commercially successful children's writing.1\n\nAs with most of his early writing, the Frances stories are stories-with-a-message in the study of human relations, and they share a phase in Hoban's children's writing that was about the doings of anthropomorphized furry animals, and sometimes small children, as in Herman the Loser (1961) and Tom and the Two Handles (1965). And nearly all of these early picture books come with illustrations by Lillian Hoban.2\n\nThe Little Brute Family (1966) tells of the brutish life of an unidentified animal species who \"never laughed and said, ‘Delightful!’ They never smiled and said, ‘How lovely!’ \"until they are affected by \"Baby Brute's … little wandering lost good feeling.\" And in its sequel, A Stone Doll for Sister Brute (1968), Sister Brute learns how to love. Harvey and his sister, Mildred, in Harvey's Hideout (1969), are quarreling brother and sister muskrats whose mutual loneliness drives them to befriending each other, but only conditionally: \"‘Would you make fun of my poems and my tea parties? … Would you laugh when I talk to Lucinda?’ ‘No,’ said Harvey, ‘I wouldn't.’ ‘Would you say mean things about the pictures I draw and would you tell me that I do everything wrong when I cook?’ ‘No,’ said Mildred. ‘I wouldn't.’\"\n\nThe Mole Family's Christmas (1969) is clichéd and technically less successful, with three very near-sighted moles wanting to see the stars; there are several close encounters with Ephraim, a predatory owl who unwittingly mediates for them with \"the fat man in the red suit … S. Claus\" to get the Christmas-present telescope through which they are able to stare at the stars. Better is Emmet Otter's Jug-Band Christmas, a Southern-American-animal Christmas Carol. It's about risk taking, with a widowed and impoverished Ma Otter and her son Emmet each being willing to risk—secretly from the other—their means of livelihood in hope of winning a fifty-dollar-prize talent competition. It will let Emmet buy Ma a piano and Ma buy for Emmet \"something shiny and expensive…. It's been such a rock-bottom life for so long, just once at least I'd like to bust out with a real glorious Christmas for Emmet.\" Neither Ma's singing nor Emmet's \"Frogtown Hollow Jug Band\" are any match for the electronic \"River Bend Nightmare\" band. But their talents are spotted by Doc Bull- frog while they sing and play on their return journey from the talent competition. And he employs them at his Riverside Rest as the resident entertainment group known as \"Ma Otter and the Frogtown Hollow Boys.\"\n\nWritten in 1969 and in a similar vein, it is not clear whether Dinner at Alberta's (1975) is as a story for parents about children or a story for children about parents. But it is an undoubtedly cautionary tale. Arthur crocodile's table manners are appalling; an offense and an embarrassment to his family's middle-class gentility. Arthur chews with his mouth open, talks when his mouth is full, feels the saltcellar, diddles with his spoon, and spills the milk when reaching across the table. But when Arthur is invited with his sister, Emma, to have dinner at her friend Alberta's house, he wants to impress her and submits himself to a six-day program of training in good manners from his family in advance of the visit.\n\n\"Arthur,\" said Father, \"don't ball up your napkin in your left hand like that.\"\n\n\"Too many things to think about,\" said Arthur. He was breathing hard.\n\n\"Relax,\" said Father. \"Listen to how Emma breathes.\"\n\n\"Too much,\" said Arthur, letting out his breath.\n\n\"What's the good of it all?\"\n\n\"All right,\" said Father. \"Forget it. Just eat at Alberta's the way you eat at home, and let it go at that.\"\n\nArthur breathed like Emma.\n\n\"That's it,\" said Father to Mother. \"This is a turning point.\"\n\nAt Alberta's his table manners are impeccable. Alberta's father says to her brother Sidney, \"You just watch how Arthur eats, and maybe you can learn some manners.\" After dinner, Albert and Sidney go outside. Sidney returns with a puffed-up lip. When he returns home with his sister, Arthur announces that the nicest part of table manners is \"teaching them to other people the way I did to Sidney.\" In the sequel to this story, Arthur's New Power (1978), Arthur attempts to restore the balance of power to the overloaded electrical system in their house by inventing a water generator.\n\nThe message for the world from the man and the woman in The Twenty-Elephant Restaurant (1977), illustrated by Quentin Blake, might be the preparedness to take whatever turns up, and whatever turns up isn't always what is prepared for. Their very small, restorative, table-making venture grows into a table-making industry and becomes an idea for a restaurant with a dancing elephant that grows into an idea for a restaurant with seventeen dancing elephants. \"‘One to a table, I'd say…. The elephants could wait on the tables, and in their spare time they could practise dancing until they're good enough so people will pay to see them.’\" A motley variety of elephants offering a variety of skills is hired in response to a classified ad for agile elephants. And a dancing-instructor elephant, a chef elephant, and a reliable elephant bring the total to twenty elephants. The main attraction for prospective clientele becomes the spectacle of the one-man-circus, Mr. Buildo. \"See Mr. Buildo build a Restaurant single-handed! Admission 50p.\"; the customers are prepared to watch while eating hot dogs served to them by elephant waiters. The restaurant becomes a huge success. And each time it begins to wobble, the man and the woman and the twenty elephants move to a flat place and begin all over again. \"‘Maybe that's just how it is,’ … ‘I think maybe you're right,’ said the man. ‘Sometimes its a one-man circus and sometimes it's a twenty-elephant restaurant.’\"\n\nThe Sea-Thing Child (1972) is a sad and humorous fable of gain and loss. It is closely related to the themes and style of Hoban's adult writing inasmuch as it is about individuals' growth into their own way of being. The sea-thing child is washed up from the ocean deeps and spends an interim existence on the alien territory of a beach, nursing his fears and anxieties: he is afraid of the ocean; hides himself first inside an igloo made by himself from stones, and, after a passing-through and intrepid albatross advises him to \"‘get off the beach before you go barmy and start building stone igloos,’\" he moves, instead, to containing himself inside a circle he has drawn in the sand. He befriends a melancholy fiddler crab without a bow, falls out with him, and makes friends with him again. Every creature who passes through this story is on its way to somewhere else, is in pursuit of something better: first, the albatross; and then an eel on its way to \"far and deep\" (p. 24). And so, too, is the sea-thing child. \"‘You will go,’\" said the crab. ‘At night I hear you running in the dark. Sometimes I see you looking at the stars. I hear the humming of the wind that will take you away’\" (p. 45). And he goes, in answer to what is in him. \"He moved forwards against the wind, then he began to run, faster and faster. The beach slipped away from under him, he laughed and flapped his wings and flew up into the storm\" (p. 46).\n\nLa Corona is the beautiful lady in the title story of La Corona and the Tin Frog ((1979). She lives in the picture on the inside of the cigarbox lid, and she is loved by the tin frog who lives inside the box. But she refuses to look at him. It is the traditional story of the frog prince. He swims through the ocean in search of his love, whom he wins and marries; but he does not turn into an enchanting prince. It is the first of four interrelated fairy-tale stories in this book about Victorian toys who live among the bric-a-brac of a children's nursery. La Corona and the Tin Frog share the nursery with \"The Tin Horseman,\" \"The Night Watchman and the Crocodile,\" and \"The Clock.\" The text has been illustrated by Nicola Bayley in the style of a Victorian children's book. The tin horseman in his story has determined to seek the beautiful yellow-haired princess who he is certain lives in the weather castle on a painted card by the window; the tin crocodile in his story has convinced himself for years that he \"was going to compose a poem for the literary quarterly edited by the spinster mouse who lived behind the skirting board.\" And the clock, who watches everything that happens in the nursery, can never do anything \"except go on keeping time,\" in that in-between moment when \"his hands touched midnight and just before he sounded his twelve strokes.\" The tin horseman reaches his princess by conquering his fears. And he breaks the enchantment to which she is bound by a Sorcerer who lives behind the \"round red-and-yellow glass-topped box that was the monkey game of skill.\" The crocodile is inspired to write his poetry when the incense-burning night watchman speaks, \"‘Now is the only time there is!’\" And the clock in his story—which is where all the stories converge—walks out of his case, \"just the two little walking brass legs of him and walked down the wall…. ‘Time can't be kept,’ said the brass legs of the clock's escapement. ‘And time can't keep you.’\" At this timeless moment when all time is Now, the nursery toys who have assembled themselves at the open window escape into the moonlight. And the Sorcerer goes with them.\n\nBy contrast, the Whitbread Award-winning How Tom Beat Captain Najork and His Hired Sportsmen (1974) is a witty anti-Establishment tale, with illustrations by Quentin Blake, about a fooling-around Tom who lives with, and under the ever-critical eye of, his maiden aunt, Miss Fidget Wonkham-Strong. She makes him learn pages of the Nautical Almanac and eat \"mutton and cabbage-and-potato sog.\" Tom fools around with \"sticks and stones and crumpled paper; with mewses and passages and dustbins, with bent nails and broken glass and holes in fences.\" Tom continues to fool around under threat of his aunt's sending for Captain Najork; \"… he comes up the river in a pedal boat, with his hired sportsmen….\" When he arrives, Captain Najork challenges Tom to the games of \"womble,\" and \"muck,\" and \"sneedball,\" the skills of which are uncannily the same as Tom's fooling-around activities. Tom wins the games of \"womble\" and \"muck.\" But before playing their game of sneedball he makes a deal with the Captain.\n\nLet's play for something.\" said Tom. \"Let's say if I win I get your pedal boat.\"\n\n\"What do I get if I win?\" said the Captain. \"Because I am certainly going to win this one.\"\n\n\"You can have Aunt Fidget Wonkham-Strong.\"\n\nAnd, with the game fought and won, by Tom, he leaves his aunt in the tender care of the Captain, pedals his boat to the next town, and advertises in the local newspaper for a new aunty, who turns out to be aunt Bundlejoy Cosysweet. In its sequel, A Near Thing for Captain Najork (1975), Tom invents a two-seater, jam-powered frog, hops off in it with his aunt Bundlejoy Cosysweet, and is hotly pursued by Captain Najork and his sportsmen in a \"peddle-powered snake.\" In a saga that is less ingenious and more slapstick than its predecessor, Tom makes a forced landing in a girls' boarding school, followed hot on the heels by the Captain in his snake. And he, in his turn, has been followed there by his jealously suspecting wife, Aunt Fidget Wonkham-Strong Najork. She first accuses the headmistress of the girls' school of hiding him and then challenges her to an arm-wrestling contest to win him back. There is a scuffle and a chase between the headmistress, Aunt Fidget, and the Captain. Aunt Fidget Wonkham Strong Najork wins two out of three in her arm-wrestling contest with the Headmistress.\n\n… and the Headmistress wept bitter tears….\n\n\"Did you want to play some more games?\" said Tom to the Captain.\n\n\"He can't,\" said Aunt Fidget Wonkham-Strong Najork.\n\n\"He's got to have his lunch and he'll be learning off pages of the Nautical Almanac for the rest of the day.\"\n\nThese Tom and Captain Najork stories represent the beginnings of a turning point in Hoban's children writing that was a move away from the well-ordered and cozy world of the Frances stories, away from cautionary tales in which young animals and children are heavily under the control and influence of adults (usually parents), and into a world where he is no longer writing about children from an adult point of view but is with them. Finally, in the early 1980s, with his quartet, The Great Fruit Gum Robbery, They Came From Aargh! (1981), The Flight of Bembel Rudzuk, and The Battle of Zormla (1982)—and in keeping with a similar movement at this time in his adult writing—he is writing from within the inner world of children's imagination that is coupled with a paradoxical move towards a greater realism; more realism in the sense that characters have become more recognizably human. And animals, when they are used (see below), are no longer furry and toy-like but are more real in their presentation, possessing animalistic behaviors which don't—as they did in earlier works such as The Mole Family's Christmas —stop short of preying on one another.\n\nThe stories in The Great Fruit Gum Robbery quartet are inventively illustrated by Colin McNaughton. Here, the world is child-high, and the perceptual field is restricted to the lower parts of the adults' bodies, who turn up in these child fantasies as: the mermaid queen and the mermaid king; the mummosaurus; the princess; and the Empress of Zurm. In The Great Fruit Gum Robbery (1981), the deep-sea diver, who is swimming around the floorboards and skirting boards of his room, visits the king of the desert, whom he finds seated in his washing-basket oasis and wrapped in his Middle Eastern towelrobe. The deep-sea diver's request of him for fruit gums is refused. There is a chase, with the king of the desert mounted on Kyrat, his stool-and-broom steed, hotly pursued by the baby Turpin on a motorcycle push toy. The baby Turpin seizes the fruit gums from the oasis and escapes to the bottom of the sea, where he hides in the ocean deeps under the kitchen table of the castle of the mermaid queen and consumes the fruit gums. \"‘Never mind,’ said the mermaid queen. ‘It's supper time anyhow.’ … The mermaid king said, ‘Next time you all get sweets the baby Turpin will have to give you some of his.’\"\n\nCommander Blob, Technician Bleep, and Navigator Blub are a band of aliens. And They Came from Aargh! (1981) depicts their travels in a twelve-legged kitchen-chair spaceship, wearing battle dress of a colander and plant pot and miscellaneous other hightech household effects. They encounter a purring, \"asymetrical shock horror,\" which they placate with milk, and a mummosaurus who attacks their ship while announcing, \"‘Cheese omelettes with chips and baked beans,’\" and \"‘You can't have chocolate cake until you've eaten your cheese omelette.’\" When Blob and Bleep have finished eating, they thank her and she invites them back to this part of the solar system which in Aargh language is called \"Plovsnat\" (\"the place of chocolate cake\").\n\nWhen, in The Flight of Bembel Rudzuk (1982), the back and front parts of the squidgerino squelcher slobbers and moans its way across the princess's floor, it leaves a loathsome track, and the princess demands to know, \"‘Where'd this monster come from? And who's going to clean up after it?’\" The squidgerino squelcher is the invention of the wizard Bembel Rudzuk, who now takes flight from the princess in Gar Denshed and is joined by the back and front halves of the squidgerino squelcher. Here, they spy a cheesecake. \"The front half said, ‘If we were to cut off just a little bit all down one side, do you think she'd notice?’ ‘No,’ said the back half.\" When the princess returns, the mess from the squidgerino squelcher has been cleaned up. \"‘Would you like some cocoa?’ … ‘Would you like some cheesecake with your cocoa,’ said the princess…. ‘Isn't this odd!’ said the princess when she brought in the cheesecake…. ‘Do you suppose mice have been at it?’ ‘Squeak, squeak!’ said the two halves of the squidgerino squelcher. ‘Squeak!’ said Bembel Rudzuk.\"\n\nThe Battle of Zormla (1982) is fought inside and outside of the fortress of Wendi Husa and is the culmination of a series of skirmishes between Zormla himself and the warlords of Troon in alliance with the Empress of Zurm. A number of sorties have occurred using various arsenals of blazing clementines, a laser sponge, marmalade, and a squad of one-eyed teddy bears. But before Zormla can make a getaway in his spaceship, the Empress of Zurm calls, \"‘Pizza's ready! … We need three chairs here.’\" \"‘Three chairs for pizza!’ said Zormla and the warlords of Troon as they quickly dismantled the space ship, sat down at the table, and ate up their pizza.\"\n\nThe Rain Door (1986), has echoes of Tom and Captain Najork in it's style and appearance. But the adventures of Harry belongs to the genre of folk tales that attempts to explain natural phenomena. Behind the rain door, in the shimmering heat of a sunny London Thursday afternoon, Harry discovers the cause and the secret of thunder and lightning: \"The rag-and-bone man opened the rain valve and the rain poured down.\"\n\nIn 1983-84 Hoban made a return to the philosophic and pastoral moods of The Sea-Thing Child and The Mouse and His Child with the publication of Jim Frog, Big John Turkle (1983), Charlie Meadows, and Livinia Bat (1984); and these have been reissued in a single volume, Ponders (1988), with four other stories in the series Grover Crow, Starboy Mole, Joram Vanderstander, and Carrie Possum. His consistent talent has been to seize the seemingly insignificant and inconsequential details of daily living and to use these as the ideas with which to invest his story. And he does this in these microscopic and verisimilar observations of life in and around the pond. The series has been illustrated by Martin Baynton with the detail of a natural history text. And the actions center for the most part around creatures of nature doing what it is natural for them to do. Jim Frog is unable to croak \"Jug-of-rum\" with the rest of the frogs because he is depressed and can only manage to croak \"Mug-of-jum.\" And his story tells how the incidentals of his day help restore his sense of hop. Big John Turkle is having a similarly depressing time. He's hankering after the taste of a lobster salad sandwich. But there are no picnickers on the surface, where he encounters, instead, Grover Crow sporting in his beak a willow-patterned cup handle, his \"object of art.\" Jim Frog steals it from Grover's hiding place and retreats with it to his winter bedroom under the mud, sets his alarm clock for spring, and looks at the willow-patterned cup handle on his bedside table. \"‘Ahhhhh!’ he sighed…. ‘Well,’ he said, ‘it isn't lobster salad but at least Grover Crow hasn't got it.’\" And when Charlie Meadows takes his torn-off newspaper headline \"Bleak Outlo\" out into the full moon of the winter night, \"when the shadows were black on the snow and the frozen pond creaked and his whiskers were stiff with the cold,\" he encounters Ephraim Owl, who is thinking of his supper; \"… but he didn't want Charlie's little shadow to stop dancing. He liked the way it whirled and changed its shape, He flew low over the ice and tried to make his shadow do the same….\" Then he changes his mind about eating Charlie and lets him go on his way to Frogtown Stump, where Charlie says nothing about his encounter with Ephraim.\n\nBut the moths in Lavinia Bat are not quite so lucky. Lavinia eats them without compunction. \"She put her FM echolocator on SCAN, she put her computer on AUTOMATIC and she was ready to go…. MOTH AT SIX O'CLOCK! said Lavinia's scanner. FOUR METRES AND CLOSING. THREE METRES, TWO … DIVE! said Lavinia's computer. I TASTE AWFUL! ultrasounded the moth.\" Lavinia has just woken from her winter sleep. She was listening to herself telling her she was going to have a baby. When Lola is born, she wants to know about everything. \"‘The main thing,’ said Lavinia, ‘is to get tuned in.’ ‘Tuned in to what?’ said Lola. ‘Everything,’ said Lavinia.\" Lavinia shows her how to hunt, and how to get tuned into the night and \"into moving with it.\" and then Lavinia remembers her half-remembered dream, saying \"‘Pass it on!’ ‘Ah!’ said Lavinia, tuned into everything. ‘I've done that!’\"\n\nHoban wrote The Marzipan-Pig in 1976 and had it published in 1986. It would seem to be a return to his earlier style. But the marzipan pig of the title is merely the catalyst, and the trigger for a series of happenings that are mainly concerned with the activities of an owl who is in love with a taxi meter, who has eaten a mouse, who in its turn has eaten the marzipan pig who had spent months of solitude and loneliness from his fall behind the sofa, \"‘I am growing hard … and bitter. What a waste of me!’\" he had complained to himself with some irony just before being eaten up entirely by the mouse. And it is about a bee and another mouse.\n\nThe story is revealed in a chain of events caused by each of these characters' lives coinciding with each other in ways such as these. It is a story delicately and sensitively told in the style of a fairy tale, but which bears the distinctive marks of Hoban's rhythmic and poetic style that was so present in The Sea-Thing Child and in The Mouse and His Child. As with The Mouse and His Child it deals with issues of love, and loneliness, and the triumph of individual characters over adversity.\n\nAnd Hoban's great chain of life continues. His children's writing, he says, comes from the same place as his adult writing.3\n\nI find myself using some of the same material—different aspects of it—in the children's books and in the adult writing….4\n\nBut the fact is, my children's writing is less and less commercially successful, and I'm working my way from popularity to obscurity, and there it is, there's nothing I can do about it…. Sometimes I think that probably parents tend to approve of books that reinforce law and order in some way. I don't know why children like it so much…. why do children like to read books in which it is pointed out that they must go to bed on time, or they must not just eat bread and jam or they should do this or should do that?5\n\nRussell Hoban is one of few contemporary writers of literature for children who is in the process of challenging the conventions by which the genre has be- come recognized, and in which the child has become inscribed. He is widening the parameters that traditionally dictate this, and this, and this, to be what children—who are themselves products of a literary tradition—expect of their literature. Instead he is offering literature that invites its young audience to go with it, wherever it might take them; to be with it, wherever that might be. It invites them to be child enough to be themselves, to make of it whatever they want it to be, and to find in it whatever helps them to experience the actuality behind the appearance of things. This is the essence of Hoban's writing.\n\nNotes\n\n1. Hoban, interview with author, 1982.\n\n2. None of these references relates to The Mouse and His Child unless specifically indicated.

A. Milne.]\n\nGiven the protean nature of literary genre, the question \"What is a children's book?\" has long been regarded as intriguing if possibly unanswerable, almost to the point of teleology: a children's book is \"a book which appears on the children's list of a publisher\" (Townsend 10). An equally complex but perhaps more fruitful query is \"What enables an author to write both children's books and adult fiction?\" Is this skill a matter of authorial personality, marketing, or a serendipitous synthesis? And what provokes the crossover?\n\nCertainly, the list of authors who have published in both genres is long and distinguished. In They Wrote for Children Too, Marilyn Fain Apseloff has catalogued over a hundred \"adult\" writers whose works have also included children's texts (admittedly, sometimes adapted by later writers). But in fact the number of authors famous in both genres is far more limited. What links a book like Ian Fleming's Dr. No with his Chitty Chitty Bang Bang?\n\nThose who write for both children and adults tend to fall into one of three categories (not including hybrids, exceptions, and bad examples). The most com- mon category comprises writers of adult fiction who, for one reason or another, take up children's literature in mid-career. This pattern mimics the general history of publishing: an enterprise importuned by or otherwise made aware of a new audience for its goods. Unfortunately, some modern adults' authors think that all they must do to appeal to children is write pablum versions of their regular material. Those who manage the transition gracefully may have learned something about children: sometimes the impetus for a first children's book is the author's first child. Such authors may also have an intuitive grasp of children's psychology, in some cases an arrested adolescence of sorts. Another possibility in this category is an author who writes on themes appealing to readers of diverse ages. Roald Dahl is a good example of this type; so, for that matter, are such seeming opposites as Antoine de Saint-Exupéry and Fleming. But it is not an easy achievement, and each year's list of children's books are strewn with casualties, inferior works that will soon perish.\n\nSomewhat rarer is the second type, which is simply the reverse of the first: those who start out writing for children and only later begin to write for an older audience. The obvious worry, that the original genre may constrain the new mode, seems not to apply in this direction. If anything carries over, it is the emphasis on imagination, as in Madeleine L'Engle's books for adult readers. Of course, those who achieve sufficient fame in children's literature, such as Maurice Sendak, will attract adult readers for anything they have written. But the career-arc of Russell Hoban is different; after becoming well known as both an illustrator and writer of children's books, he began to put forth adult novels of astonishing complexity and power. Perhaps accretion is in some ways easier than simplicity.\n\nThe third category, what one might term polygraphy, falls somewhere in between the first two types. Though writers such as A. A. Milne, who penned nursery rhymes and box-office hits with equal facility, are hardly a common breed, there has always been a small but recognizable subset of authors who balance an array of diverse projects and have done so since the start of their careers. Louisa May Alcott and C. S. Lewis are two good examples. Their output is generally prolific, yet marked by a high degree of craft. If some critics fault polygraphic authors for lack of depth, this quality may be attributable to speed of composition, or the tendency of popular opinion to equate prolixity with shallowness.\n\nPerhaps the most useful way to illustrate this typology is to examine the career of one writer from each category. In selecting authors for this purpose, I seek a homogeneous group, since the variables of gender, race, class, language, and era introduce complexities that, though intriguing, are beyond the scope of this essay. Accordingly, I have restricted my discussion to three twentieth-century male English-speaking authors—Dahl, Hoban, and Milne—whose texts seem to illuminate key aspects of genre crossover.\n\n* * *\n\nDahl provides an excellent example of a latecomer to children's books, as well as to the profession of writing itself. An ex-R.A.F. pilot whose first published work was a doctored account of his plane crash in Libya, Dahl soon produced a book of stories about pilots called Over to You (1945). The style was tight with occasional flourishes of wit, Hemingwayesque in its spareness, yet also with Ernest Hemingway's love of technical detail. In fact, Hemingway was a friend of Dahl's, though his response to Over to You was curious. As Alan Warren recounts the incident: \"Hemingway borrowed the volume: he returned it after two days, and when Dahl asked him how he'd like [sic] the stories, Hemingway, striding off along the corridor, replied: ‘I didn't understand them’\" (121). This kind of reader-response keeps one from defining \"adult\" books as those beyond children's comprehension, since they obviously confuse some adults, as well. In any event, encouraged more by Alfred A. Knopf than by Hemingway, Dahl became known as a polished short-story writer in the vein of Saki and John Collier.\n\nA typical Dahl story, such as \"Skin\" or \"Lamb to the Slaughter,\" depends on a what-if premise or a twist—what happens when a man has a masterpiece tattooed on his back? suppose the murder weapon were edible?—though the writing is not gimmicky. Someone Like You (1953) and Kiss Kiss (1959) showcase the best of these gently macabre tales, with a slight fall-off in quality when Dahl tackles the risqué in Switch Bitch (1974). And then one day, as Dahl puts it, \"I didn't have a plot for a short story, and I decided to have a go at doing a children's book\" (West, Interview 63). As further impetus, Dahl by then had a live audience, his own children. The bedtime stories he told them formed the nucleus of James and the Giant Peach (1961). After that, it was Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (1964), and Dahl was off and running. Switching genres was apparently a piece of cake, to borrow the title of Dahl's first short story.\n\nAnd yet, if one looks more closely at the start of Dahl's writing career, some discrepancies emerge. First, as Jeremy Treglown chronicles in his recent biography of Dahl, switching genres was more an imperative than a lark: Dahl confessed that he had begun running out of short-story ideas, and in any event magazines such as The New Yorker were turning away from his brand of narrative (127). Second, Dahl had begun working on children's material well before his first published book for juveniles. The Gremlins, a fantasy about mythical creatures who interfere with the workings of airplanes, came out in 1943 as a picture book after being bought by Disney for possible film adaptation. Third, given the nature of Dahl's short stories, strongly plotted ‘flights of imagination with O. Henry twists, one could argue that Dahl was always writing with a child's delight in reversals. As Mark West remarks in his book-length study of Dahl: \"In almost all of Dahl's fiction—whether it be intended for children or adults—authoritarian figures, social institutions, and societal norms are ridiculed or at least undermined\" (x). Treglown makes a similar point about strong maternal figures, specifically Dahl's mother, Sofie (52). Dahl depended heavily on her but also seems to have rigged events in his fiction against just such types.\n\nMany of the plots suggest a desire for revenge on the powerful. In the short story \"William and Mary,\" the wife sees her autocratic husband reduced to utter, bodiless dependency; in \"Beware of the Dog,\" the shot-down pilot learns that he is not only crippled but imprisoned. The children's books showcase this incapacity. In The Magic Finger (1966), for instance, the duck hunters are turned into ducks, and The Twits (1980) is full of images of immobility: \"Mrs. Twit was quite helpless now. With her feet tied to the ground and her arms pulled upward by the balloons, she was unable to move\" (24).\n\nAs Freud notes in Beyond the Pleasure Principle, the next step after dependency and paralysis is the inorganic state, which is where Dahl often leaves his victims, sometimes literally. In \"The Landlady,\" the new lodger finds out too late that his landlady practices human taxidermy. In \"Georgy Porgy,\" a shy curate returns to the other end of life, birth. Afraid of eros due to a childhood memory of a rabbit eating her newborn baby, and guilty over the death of his own sexually aggressive mother, he envisions a return to the womb down the throat of a promiscuous female parishioner. He ends up engulfed—inside the woman, as he imagines, but really confined to a padded cell.\n\nThe figures due for comeuppance in Dahl's children's books are dealt with similarly: the wicked aunts in James and the Giant Peach are flattened, and the two odious adults in The Twits succumb to a fatal case of the shrinks. At first, Dahl doled out poetic justice: in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, for example, Augustus Gloop falls into the Slough of Gluttony, and Mike Teavee becomes as tiny and limited as the figures he watches on television. Only in his later children's books, such as Matilda (1988), does Dahl settle too predictably into a back-and-forth mode of injury and vengeance. As Matilda resolves after her father insults her: \"She decided that every time her father or mother was beastly to her, she would get her own back in some way or another\" (29). In Dirty Beasts (1983), a pig decides to turn the tables on the farmer and eat him, an ant-eater eats an aunt, and so on. Revenge is sweet, but less so when it becomes systematic.\n\nYet as far back as the flying stories, as close to barebones realism as Dahl ever got till he wrote his autobiographical volumes Boy (1984) and Going Solo (1986), a sense of payback prevails, often taking an arguably childlike form. In \"Madame Rosette,\" the pilots are like boys sassing the evil old witch, in this case the ugly madam of a brothel in Cairo. The sense of impishness is never far from even the utmost seriousness. In \"A Piece of Cake,\" a pilot in a burning airplane crash imagines a telegraph system between the body and the brain: \"Down here there is a great hotness. What shall we do? (Signed) Left Leg and Right Leg\" (41). \"Beware of the Dog,\" the pen-ultimate story in the collection, is the stuff of childish paranoia, everyone around the protagonist seemingly kind but really an enemy—the fantasy brilliantly vindicated in the end.\n\nEven the salacious stories in Switch Bitch (first published in Playboy, with two expanded into the novel My Uncle Oswald) are not quite the material of adult sexuality but rely on nudges and winks. Uncle Oswald, a grown-up Willy Wonka figure addicted to sex rather than chocolate, writes in hints and innuendoes. A typical instance occurs during a love scene in a harem, when Oswald's diary primly declares: \"I wish to be excused a detailed description of the great scene that followed\" (Switch 64). His one earlier novel, Some Time Never: A Fable for Supermen (1948), was a failure as far as both Dahl and the public were concerned. Though billed as a full-length adult work, it relies on two elements of children's literature, both risky in the context of the realist fiction of the 1940s and '50s: allegorical fantasy and didactic preachiness. References to Fifinellas who eat snozzberries jostle warnings about the dangers of warfare. On the other hand, the same story, pared down and illustrated by animation frames from Disney Studios, made for a likeable fable as The Gremlins (see Treglown 62 ff).\n\nWhat are the implications for Dahl's voice or the writer behind it? As Dahl once said of himself: \"It's a mistake to see me as two different people. I'm not\" (West, \"Interview\" 65). In fact, what Dahl does best is write Dahl books, a curious middle ground that, with a little alteration in subject and tone, appeals to either adults or children. When he veers away from this mode, as in the sexually titillating My Uncle Oswald, he loses a portion of his audience. And when he writes too deliberately for children, as in The Magic Finger with its restricted lexicon, his narrative also suffers. In fact, Dahl has gone on record against what Jan Susina has termed \"kiddie lit(e),\" or \"the dumbing down of children's literature\" (v). In a polemic entitled \"Let's Build a Skyscraper, But Let's Find a Good Book First,\" Dahl rails against books with limited vocabulary and \"those horrible things that are called educational books\" (2). More successful, from both a narrative and marketing point of view, was Danny the Champion of the World (1975), in which Dahl did not pare down but rather expanded on several adult stories about poaching that had appeared in Someone Like You.\n\nIn \"Lucky Break—How I Became a Writer,\" Dahl lists seven qualities a fiction writer should have (Henry Sugar 168-69). The first is a lively imagination, but stamina, self-discipline, humor, and humility are also on the roster. In the end, the moral dimension in which Dahl places both children and adults is more complex than mere payback or turning the other cheek, since it involves luck, shrewdness, and a wit that doesn't flinch from life's ugliness. Dahl's long-time illustrator Quentin Blake, with his cartoonish but apt drawings, helps to accentuate the fun in Dahl's otherwise tendentious humor.\n\nIn these days of political correctness, Dahl has endured accusations of racism and sexism, as Jonathan Culley and others have chronicled. As for charges of sadism and vulgarity, however, Culley provides convincing analogies with folklore to show just what Dahl is about: the structures and methods of myth, with their occasional cruelty and excess. Hubris leads to a sickening fall; one foul deed is repaid with another. Hamida Bosmajian has even pointed out Rabelaisian links in an essay on Dahl's excremental vision. This kind of Lévi-Straussian analysis also explains why Dahl's appeal is so broad, since the mythic dimension knows no age limit.\n\nHoban and his circumstances seem to present an opposite case to Dahl's. Starting as a children's-book illustrator, Hoban eventually switched over to writing for children. During the 1960s, he came out with the well-known series of Frances books, most with drawings by his wife Lillian. Their popularity is easily understandable: the books are engaging and accurate in their simple but subtle depiction of families and relationships. The occasional rhymes that Frances recites, short and with skip-a-beat meter, present a pleasant contrast to the clever extravaganzas in Dahl's fiction, and in fact eventually made up their own collection, Egg Thoughts, and Other Frances Songs (1972). The didactic but humorous messages against stubborn behavior are shown again and again through the girl-badger Frances, whether she is sticking to a diet of bread and jam or refusing to go to sleep.\n\nThe strength of these books lies not in any lampooning but in the shrewd accuracy of depiction. In Best Friends for Frances (1969), for instance, when Frances can't join a boys' baseball game, she reluctantly falls back on her little sister for company. In A Birthday for Frances (1968), Frances must deal with sibling envy at the fuss being made over her sister's birthday. Hoban's other children's books from that decade are similar. Nothing to Do (1969), for instance, opens with \"‘I have nothing to do,’ said Walter Possum to his father\" (5)—a set-up to show, by the end of the story, that necessity is the mother of invention, which staves off boredom. In The Stone Doll of Sister Brute (1968), through the cathexis of affection onto a rock and a dog, Sister Brute learns about love.\n\nMost critics see Hoban's turning point as The Mouse and His Child (1967), which is far longer than anything he had written previously, as well as more complex in theme, tone, plot, and character. As Hoban has commented, \"I didn't make any concessions for a young reader either in vocabulary or in what I was putting into it\" (qtd. in Wilkie 98). It includes depictions of the homeless, murder, and a take-off on Samuel Beckett's drama, and it took three years to write. Still, as a story with toys and animals as characters, The Mouse and His Child was classed as a children's book.\n\nThe classification reveals as much about publishing practice as about genre, which is to say that marketing strategy determines a great deal about how a book is perceived. Hoban was known as a children's-book author; hence, his market appeal was likely to be highest in that category. Also, children's books in the past decade or two have sold better on the whole than adult books. As Dahl has noted of authors: \"if they hit the jackpot with just one children's book, it's an income for life\" (West, \"Interview\" 65). An additional reason is the apparent simplicity of the work's composition, though simpler does not necessarily mean easier.\n\nOn the other hand, Hoban was trying to move past his earlier work, and the marketing of The Mouse and His Child as juvenile literature cannot have pleased him much. Referring to the rigid rules of genre, Hoban remarked, \"Most adult books are about clockwork dolls who copulate. Mine happens to be about clockwork mice who walk, and therefore it is a children's book\" (\"Thoughts on a Shirtless Cyclist\" 13-14). When critics at the 1973 Exeter Children Literature Conference pursued the question of classification, by now tiresome to him, he replied \"that he had wanted the manuscript to be published, that Faber was interested, and if Faber had marketed tables and chairs, he would have sold it as a table or, if they preferred, as a chair\" (qtd. in McMahon-Hill 41).\n\nYet the problem cannot be reduced to mere marketing economics. Though The Mouse and His Child is yet another Hoban book illustrated by his wife, both lay readers and critics see it as different from his earlier efforts. As Valerie Krips notes in her Lacanian essay \"Mistaken Identity,\" the book's pervasive notions of lack and fantasies of wholeness are pursued on sophisticated psychological and linguistic levels (97). In any event, no one questioned the adult status of his next (unillustrated) novel, The Lion of Boaz-Jachin and Jachin-Boaz, when it came out in 1973. During that time, Hoban's personal circumstances underwent some dramatic changes: he moved to London, his marriage broke up, his wife returned to the United States with the children, and he married again and produced a new son named Jachin Boaz. As Hoban mentions in \"Thoughts on Being and Writing,\" he named his son after the twin pillars in Solomon's temple, Jachin and Boaz (70). The son's rage at the father in the novel, as well as the father's guilt, however, derives from Hoban's relations with his son from his first marriage (see Haffenden 128). The novel has a great deal to do with the theme of fathers and sons, specifically a father who leaves his wife and son, but also with the entwined concerns of epistemology and ontology. As Jachin-Boaz tells his onomastically opposite son Boaz-Jachin, \"Everyone in the world is looking for something\" (12), an allegorical theme that becomes increasingly urgent in Hoban's later fiction. The Sea-Thing Child, a children's book that came out one year earlier (and was illustrated by a son from his first marriage, Abrom Hoban), has the same pattern: a character of indeterminate status who must make his way in the world. But the nature of the search is spiritual, even mystical, and, as the sea-thing child hears an eel singing, \"The finding is in me, and the finding finds the way\" (13). Knowing merges with being.\n\nHoban's next novel was Kleinzeit (1974), whose dissection of language and social institutions might seem deconstructive were it not for the cohering mythology of Orpheus at its core. It may also reveal the precarious mental state of Hoban at the time, checking into a hospital for diabetes complications and feeling the terror of mortality. But the arch manner in which Hoban handles the situation shows his background as an author for juveniles, from inanimate objects that talk, to comic mishearings of words. In 1974, the same year that Kleinzeit was published, Hoban put out How Tom Beat Captain Norjak and His Hired Sportsmen, which went on to win a Whitbread Award. Illustrated by Quentin Blake, who later collaborated with Dahl, the book also contains repressive adult figures like those in such works as James and the Giant Peach and Matilda. For obvious reasons, How Tom Beat Captain Norjak does not participate in the complex language play of Kleinzeit, but children's fiction has other compensations, in this instance a Seuss-like indulgence in games with names like womble muck and sneedball.\n\nThe mixed experiences in Kleinzeit participate in such syllabic play, but also extend further to figures of speech as they become figures of being. Apostrophe, for example, usually a one-sided trope, is answered here. The introduction to the basic ontological dilemma in the book, \"Am I real?,\" could be a page from one of Hoban's children's books:\n\nI exist, said the mirror.\n\nWhat about me? said Kleinzeit.\n\nNot my problem, said the mirror.\n\n(7)\n\nBy the end, Kleinzeit has resolved this question sufficiently to go on. He has also made his peace with eventual extinction, but in a manner typical of Hoban, through a personification of death who gives a present to Kleinzeit. Abstractions are instantly turned into metaphors in Hoban's work, providing a necessary handle for young readers, but also a mythic con- sciousness for adult themes. As Neaera H. points out in Turtle Diary (1975): \"The differences in scale and costume do not alter the event. Oedipus went to Thebes, Peter Rabbit into Mr. McGregor's garden, but the story is essentially the same\" (52). Hoban may alter or even invert a traditional motif to make it more relevant to adults, however. As the father in The Lion of Boaz-Jachin and Jachin-Boaz thinks of one fairy-tale paradigm: \"Always the father was dead at the beginning of the story, and the young man went out with his few coins, his crust of bread, his fiddle or his sword\" (26). Though the son Boaz-Jachin does indeed go on the road with his guitar, the father has preceded him in a midlife-crisis quest, and in fact the pair are almost two halves of one man, separated in time.\n\nTurtle Diary takes a more reflective look at what may also have been two halves of Hoban's own psyche: the lonely, brooding man divorced from his family, William G.; and the burned-out children's book illustrator, Neaera H. Yet the observations throughout, as in all of Hoban's adult novels, are not only lively and inventive, but also the kind of remarks a child might make about strangers. Neaera H. remarks of her neighbor, \"His eyes look as if he's pawned his real ones and is wearing paste\" (10), just as William G. comments about a fellow-lodger, \"He carries a briefcase, the kind that looks as if it might be full of sausages\" (29). This kind of writing, applied to an adult consciousness, mimics a child's inquisitive manner. Similarly, the Frances series, in which all the characters are anthropomorphized badgers, undergoes a sea change in Turtle Diary : Neaera H. thinks of \"the John Clare poem about a badger hunted out of his den by men and dogs and taken to the town and made to fight until he was dead. There's a line in which he ‘cackles, groans, and dies.’ William G. looked as if he might be going to cackle\" (75). The emergent tone is a blend of cackles and groans, childish amusement mixed with middle-age angst. In a Wordsworthian sense, the children's writer is father to the author for adults.\n\nIn switching to an adult mode, however, Hoban also becomes less didactic and moralistic, more reliant on found symbols. His closely observed detail, the mind's speculative ruminations, and the seamless merging of naturalism and symbolism all bespeak a modernist texture, except for the tendency toward allegory that becomes more pronounced in Riddley Walker (1980) and Pilgermann (1983). As Gillian McMahon-Hill notes of the protagonist at the end of Kleinzelt : \"He has not been presented with answers, but his perception has changed\" (51). The same change occurs in Turtle Diary when William H. traces a manhole cover labeled \"K257\" to the catalogue listing of Mozart's Credo Mass in C, which translates into \"I believe\" (117). (The signifying manhole cover is repeated in Hoban's children's book Ace Dragon Ltd [1980], where the etched words \"Ace Dragon Ltd\" refer to a dragon named Ace, of limited powers.) Added perception leads to a more meaningful existence; increased epistemology makes for a more satisfying ontology.\n\nThe succès d'estime of Riddley Walker in 1980 raised all these elements to new heights, from locale to language. Hoban's childhood exposure to fantasy and science fiction combines with Conradian pacing and a Joycean attention to language to form an apocalyptic fable of modernist complexity. But the children's writer remains visible. The narrator's language in the novel is unintentionally paronomastic, as awkward as it is clever. In fact, as Natalie Maynor and Richard F. Patteson argue, \"the syntax in Riddley Walker suggests that of a child going through the necessary experimentation in mastering sentence construction\" (21).\n\nPilgermann is a further meditation on the ruinous patterns of history, against a medieval tableau of surreal violence that resembles a canvas of Hieronymus Bosch. More and more in Hoban, as Jack Branscomb comments, one sees \"the need for the individual to enter into a cyclical pattern larger than himself\" (31). Or, to borrow a title from Leonard Woolf, the journey not the destination matters. Hoban's most recent novel, The Medusa Frequency (1987), presents a similar message, along with the same Orphic references as in Kleinzeit, no longer on yellow paper but on a computer screen. Both rely on the protagonist's disorientation to produce a disorienting narrative. As the hallucinatory head of Orpheus says to Herman Orff, one of Hoban's disenchanted artist-figures: \"My story is not a sequence of events like knots on a string … all of it is happening now and any part of it contains the whole of it\" (39). This is quite close to Virginia Woolf's famous pronouncement: \"Life is not a series of gig lamps symmetrically arranged; life is a luminous halo, a semi-transparent envelope surrounding us from the beginning of consciousness to the end\" (150). Art can derive much of its complexity from sheer mimesis.\n\nHoban applies this kind of insight to children's books with mixed results. The Marzipan Pig (1986), tracing the sweetness from a marzipan pig to the mouse that eats the pig to the owl that eats the mouse, and so on, presents the same casual Joycean metempsychosis that Hoban attempts in his novels, but the story remains without closure—save an abstract sense of transformation and renewal. As A. Joan Bowers notes, Hoban's children's books have shifted from fantasy to metaphysics (94). Hoban himself confesses: \"Recently my children's books and my adult novels are coming from the same place more than they used to\" (qtd. in Heffenden 123). Equally revealing are his affinity for Zen Buddhism (Myers 15) and a statement in a 1990 address he made to a convention in San Diego: \"What I want to do is come at you from several places at once\" (\"Russell Hoban Reads Russell Hoban\" 96). In his striving for meaning in a densely psychological, achronological thicket, Hoban has increasingly adopted a more allusive style, less didactic but not necessarily more attractive to children: \"I'm always having to bother with editors who will say, ‘Oh, could you change such and such a word for something simpler because a child won't take it in.’ I just tell them to get lost\" (qtd. in Wilkie 118).\n\nLike Dahl, Hoban has done quite well with a few adult and children's titles, while the rest of his output is not nearly so well known. With years of successful writing behind him, he no longer feels the need to adhere to a particular fictional pattern, or even a specific bundle of bound pages: \"As my thoughts get more and more interesting to me, the output of books becomes less and less pressing\" (qtd. in Haffenden 123). At this stage in his career, Dahl was writing his memoirs. Yet Hoban seems to have moved beyond sheer versatility to the omniscient consciousness of the modernists. And in moving back and forth from children's books to adult fare, Hoban has expanded his moral dimension from social behavior to a true spiritual ethos.\n\nA writer like A. A. Milne fits into another class altogether, those for whom essays seem to come as easily as verse, or plays as effortlessly as novels. This is not to cheapen Milne's writing, no matter how copious. But for the versatile Milne, who came to the Punch round-table at age twenty-four, \"shifting genres\" seems questionable terminology. From the time of his Cambridge days at Granta, Milne simply wrote, producing everything from poetry to editorial commentary in a steady stream. His earliest efforts at light verse, often written in collaboration with his older brother Ken, show a clever emulation of the contemporary Punch style, a series of witty observations in the semblance of a dialogue, a poem, or an essay. The first piece he sold freelance was a parody of the latest Sherlock Holmes for Vanity Fair. As a contributing editor to Punch, Milne provided humorous write-ups of everything from missing a wrestling match to enduring a month of fresh butter when he preferred the salted kind (see Autobiography 144ff.).\n\nThis style of patter has its risk, a triviality that seems vapid rather than amusing. As the London Times once noted in a mixed tribute, \"When there is nothing whatever to say, no one knows better than Mr Milne how to say it\" (qtd. in McGrath 95). Trifling matters may suit a humorous column but fail in any prolonged treatment. One of Milne's early plays, for example, is all about whether a man will change his name to Wurzel-Flummery in order to claim an inheritance with that proviso. The Red House Mystery (1922), with its clever amateur detective Antony Gillingham, was famously singled out in Raymond Chandler's \"The Simple Art of Murder\" for its procedural errors. Milne's success, however, is undeniable: the one-acter Wurzel-Flummery enjoyed a double bill with a J. M. Barrie drama; The Red House Mystery saw thirteen printings in twenty years. In 1922, he had five plays running simultaneously in England and the United States, and his four children's books, published between 1924 and 1928, assured Milne an immortality at times vexing even to the author.\n\nOne can attribute this popularity not to the pleasant nastiness of Dahl or to the moral complexity of Hoban but to Milne's sheer cheerfulness. No character is allowed to languish for too long; no problem is proposed without some uplifting or at least amusing solution. The possibility of bigamy in Mr. Pim Passes By (1921) is relegated to a faulty memory; Eeyore's missing tail in Winnie-the-Pooh (1926) turns out to be Owl's bell-rope. The sheer smoothness of his technique (a quality some postmodernist critics deplore) carried him through, giving his works a rosy, upturned face. Almost as important was the fit between Milne's affability and the mood of the era—with the qualification that eras inevitably change, as Milne, like so many other writers of the '20s, suffered a decline in the socialist '30s. Milne's novel Two People (1931), for instance, involves Reginald Wellard, a man of independent means with a beautiful, pleasant wife named Sylvia. Reginald bemusedly finds that he has written a bestselling novel, which causes a series of minor irritations, from having to get a haircut to dealing with an unscrupulous publisher named Mr. Pump. The novel meanders on in a Wodehousian vein (it was indeed one of P. G. Wodehouse's favorite novels; see Thwaite 270), but without the narrative ingenuity. One needn't be a Marxist critic to wonder what supports such floating characters.\n\nBut then, this is the sort of minor matter that Milne could spin out at great length. It is the very essence of the two Pooh books, in which the lack of a birthday present is a crisis, or the deciphering of a written sign occupies an entire episode. And there are reasons why these have become canonical children's works. As in Dahl's and Hoban's best children's narratives, there is an urgency behind the charm: bees deliver both honey and stings, overeating has dismaying consequences, and a Heffalump is the inevitable confrontation with the Other that is an emerging part of oneself.\n\nThe verses in When We Were Very Young (1924), Milne's first book for children, work on the same double levels: a small child dislikes rice pudding—though the issue is over who controls whom; a king needs butter for his breakfast—why won't people comply with simple requests? As Milne commented on the situations:\n\nWhen We Were Very Young is not the work of a poet becoming playful, nor of a lover of children expressing his love, nor of a prose-writer knocking together a few jingles for the little ones, it is the work of a light-verse writer taking his job seriously even though he is taking it into the nursery.\n\n(Autobiography 282)\n\nThe same may be said of Ernest H. Shepard, whose illustrations stamp their images indelibly on the mind of the reader, to the point where any other vision of Kanga or Eeyore seems wrong.\n\nThe impetus for the rhymes and stories seems the same as Dahl's, and perhaps Hoban's: children in the household. On the other hand, as his son Christopher has observed in The Enchanted Places, his father enjoyed \"a boyhood from which all his inspiration sprang\" (158). A sort of permanent adolescence, which Ann Thwaite portrays gently in her massive biography of Milne and which Charles McGrath puts bluntly in his review of it, may account for Milne's ease in stooping, if indeed it was so for Milne. The verse \"Halfway Down\" perfectly captures the inertia of a child in his chosen spot, \"Disobedience\" the protective, slightly fearful love of a son for his all-too-capable mother. There is more, of course: \"Disobedience\" masks Oedipal attraction, and the poem, despite its jolly tone, is about a mother who never comes back. As Martha Wolfenstein has noted, much of children's humor—and no doubt adults', as well—consists of jokes to ward off anxiety (23).\n\nThe poems in Now We Are Six (1927) have a lower rate of success, to judge by which ones from each volume are still recited in various households (according to an admittedly informal poll). In fact, certain poems in When We Were Very Young have direct counterparts in Now We Are Six, in each case to the original volume's advantage: \"Jonathan Jo,\" about a helpful, funny, rustic type, presages the calmer portrait in \"The Charcoal Burner\"; the same is true of James the snail in \"The Four Friends\" versus Alexander the beetle in \"Forgiven.\" This kind of contrast raises the possibility that Milne, despite his famed versatility, nonetheless appeals most to a certain-age child, beyond which children grow faintly embarrassed or bored. Small children like him and many adults dote on him, but few teenagers repair to their rooms with a volume of Milne. What is invoked here may be the innocent urge for protection, so comforting when one is young, so irritating at an older age. As Dahl once articulated his aversion to When We Were Very Young: \"It's that bloody nanny\" (qtd. in Thwaite 266).\n\nMilne's output is sufficiently varied at such an early stage in his career that the question of whether he wrote for adults or children first is almost irrelevant. In a curious way, even his novels are slightly childlike and unformed, while his children's books contain the intuitive insights into human nature that we expect from classics. The specifics are fluff, the generalities based on them true. Such are the multivalent paradoxes embodied by his polygraphy.\n\n* * *\n\nThe pantheon of writers noted for both adult and children's literature is growing yearly. Everyone seems to have a children's book that wants to be published, and well-known authors often have the audience to make these plans a reality, if not a success. Vagaries of the Zeitgeist, issues of marketing, and even the element of luck also play a part. A full-scale study of crossover failures should take these factors into account, as well as more immediate stylistic issues, since the critical field known as reader-response really depends on everything from social consciousness to aleatoric aspects, and must also explain why readers fail to respond to certain textual invitations.\n\nCausation is complex—yet this is precisely where Dahl, Hoban, and Milne are most convincing in providing reasons for why we do what we do and how we come to be ourselves. If Roland Barthes was right in calling all the world a text, the opposite is equally true, and adults have just as pressing a need as children to understand the universe. Of course this need includes authors. In the long run, perhaps the genre-crossover from children's books to adult fiction or-vice versa is defined more by need and the art that bridges such frustration as it is by casual ambidexterity. Not everyone can travel this span successfully—not everyone wants to. As Hoban has written:\n\nWhen we think about someone who writes fiction, I believe that we mostly think that the writer can pretty well make up whatever kind of story he likes. We are aware of course of individual limitations: writer A is best with short introspective novels; B does great epics; C excels in travel and adventure; D in the microcosm of every day. Within those limitations, we may suppose, A, B, C and D can do what they like. But of course they can't, any more than they can dream what they like when they're asleep. The dreams come from what is in the person.\n\n(\"Time Slip\" 40)\n\nWorks Cited\n\nApseloff, Marilyn Fain, comp.

The original Booklist review described the book in these words: \"An intricate but skillfully executed fantasy [that] chronicles the hazardous and heroic adventures of a broken windup mouse child and his father in search of happiness and security.\" This new edition includes new artwork by Small, who received the Caldecott Medal for So You Want to Be President? (2000), written by Judith St. George. Here, his dynamic yet sensitive black-and-white artwork will appeal to adults and children alike. The illustrations' economy of line, grace of expression, and underlying wit reflect the spirit and subtlety of the text.\n\nRIDDLEY WALKER (1980)\n\nNancy Dew Taylor (essay date fall 1989)\n\nSOURCE: Taylor, Nancy Dew. \"‘… you bes go ballsy’: Riddley Walker's Prescription for the Future.\" Critique 31, no. 1 (fall 1989): 27-39.\n\n[In the following essay, Taylor calls Riddley Walker \"an expression of Riddley's two pasts, present, and future,\" that is, in itself, a reflection of our own society.]\n\nHell is where we are…. The question is whether we want to get out of where we are, whether we're so full of our large death that we have forgotten about life.\n\n… that same thing that lives within us has shown us that it wants everything that can happen to happen. Is survival something that can happen? … Maybe we ought to look into it. There's no one else.\n\nHoban, [\"It Cancels All Distance between Our Unthinking and the Unthinkable\" ], 4.\n\nIn 1984, following two BBC2 programs on the effects of nuclear war, the British journal The Listener asked two men to write articles for its September 27th issue. One writer was a scientist who traced the development of scientists' belief in nuclear winter; the second was an American writer who makes England his home. His name is Russell Hoban, and he is the author of Riddley Walker, a post-holocaust novel set in England in the year \"2347 o.c. which means Our Count.\"1 The epigraph, taken from Hoban's article, provides in miniature several clues to the nature of Riddley Walker, for pessimism, mysticism, and a desire for hope mingle in these few sentences much as they do in the novel itself.\n\nThe novel's plot centers on Riddley and the characters he meets during his travels around his world, the southeast corner of Inland. His father dies on Riddley's twelfth birthday, and Riddley inherits the role of shaman for his \"form\" (farm). He wants to create his own \"tels\" and \"connexions\" but quickly discovers that the Mincery—the ruling government—expects him to follow party lines in his interpretation of the old stories and myths handed down by word of mouth since Bad Time (the nuclear holocaust and its aftermath). Asserting his individuality, Riddley literally jumps the \"fents\" (fence) and strikes out alone to seek answers to the riddles that confuse him.\n\nStriking out alone in the Inland of 2347 o.c. is equivalent to certain death, so here our hero is joined by a pack of dogs, whose leader speaks to Riddley with his eyes. Riddley and the dogs are then mysteriously drawn to the underground prison of the Ardship of Cambry, a horribly disfigured boy Riddley's age whom the Mincery has imprisoned because it believes he knows, from his ancestors, the secret of atomic fission. With the help of the dogs, Riddley frees the Ardship, and the two young men \"road\" together—one in search of the secret of destruction lost in the holocaust, the other in search of knowledge that will enable him to find his place in his world. Although they believe they are in charge of their own destinies, the Mincery has actually allowed them to escape, for it hopes these two \"movers\" will lead it to \"yeller-boy stoan\" (sulfur, the main ingredient in making gunpowder) and to the secret of atomic fission, the two things the Mincery believes will give it the power needed to maintain its dominance of Inland.\n\nRiddley writes down his experiences—those with and those separate from the Ardship—in a broken language, for like books, \"culture,\" and even mankind, language was almost destroyed during Bad Time. Hoban's carefully created language has drawn almost more critical interest than have the novel's plot and characters. Natalie Maynor and Richard F. Patteson devote an entire article to it, and David Dowling's fine article is as informative about Hoban's language as it is about Riddley's connections.\n\nHoban's created language is generally read phonetically, yet he manages to imbue its crudity with a poetry and irony all its own. \"The Littl Shynin Man the Addom\" thus plays on the inconceivableness of both the beauty and the horror of the atom and, at the same time, ties these concepts of beauty and destructiveness to atom's near homophone, Adam. \"The Ardship of Cambry\" implies that the Ardship's life is a hardship, and, since Cambry is the new word for Canterbury, Ardship may play on an ironic combination of lordship and archbishop. These ironies are deepened by Cambry's being the old center of power—not of religious but of nuclear power.\n\nAs these two examples illustrate, Hoban's language is fascinating, and undoubtedly it will continue to interest the critics. The novel itself, however, is equally as fascinating, equally as challenging, and certainly pertinent to the condition of modern mankind, yet few critics have attempted to discuss it. In fact, most reviewers and critics have viewed the novel in terms of its negative emphases. Benjamin Demott, reviewing the book in the New York Times Book Review, stated that the novel represents \"a commanding summons to the reader to dwell anew on that within civilization which is separated from, opposite to, power and its appurtenances, ravages, triumphs\" (25); although praising this theme as \"valuable,\" Demott essentially emphasizes what the novel tells us to avoid. British novelist Penelope Lively correctly spoke of \"the terrible and perhaps fatal duality\" of the human mind, but Jennifer Uglow took the book to task for what she called its \"pessimistic contempt for the masses which is hardly balanced by the promise of mystic intuition for an artistic élite,\" a reading I find totally misdirected. In a recent study, Jack Branscomb views the circular \"roading\" as suggestive of \"the futile, destructive, repetitive nature of the human search for knowledge and power\" (33), and in a recently published book, History and the Contemporary Novel, David Cowart sees Riddley Walker as a pessimistic statement concerning the grim and meaningless circularity of history.\n\nCowart does, however, recognize that the novel also speaks of the role of art in humanity's struggle to know itself in history and in its effort to recover its lost potential. My own reading of the novel takes its departure from this idea, for I believe Riddley Walker contains a positive statement about art's and man's roles in preventing a repetition of history. The novel provides some \"vansit theary\" (107) on the human heart, a \"trants mission\" (145) of hope for the human race.\n\nRiddley Walker portrays two pasts, the present, and the future in almost equal proportions. The blasted landscape of the novel's present is a physical wasteland; its inhabitants, no less than Eliot's, exist amidst a confusion of moral values. Struggling forward toward what we would term \"civilization\"—an idea whose validity the novel and its author question—the \"primitives\" of Riddley Walker have come to a turning point in their history. The killing of the last wild boar, Riddley's questioning of the purpose of coming-of-age rites (\"The woal thing fealt jus that littl bit stupid,\" 1), the growing dissatisfaction of \"fents\" communities with the power of the \"forms\" (with which the Mincery is in league)—all are indications of this turning point.\n\nThese important events are symbolized in the early chapters by the death of Riddley's father, the death of the newborn at Widders Dump, and the death of the black-and-red spotted leader of the dogs. Lorna, the tell woman, \"reads\" these three deaths as signals of the passing of old ways: connections (Hoban intends the double meaning) with the past are broken by Brooder Walker's death; the baby's death is a sign of what happens when farms dig up Bad Time. The dog's offering of itself in death to Riddley becomes an indication of the renewal of the possibility of \"1st knowing.\" \"1st knowing\" is Lorna's term for, essentially, the garden of Eden. As a part of Time Back Way Back, this state of balance between humans, animals, and nature represents that good time in history when mankind \"Dint have no mor fear in the nite they put ther self right day and nite\" (18). But the death of the old dog leader also becomes a sign that Riddley is being chosen for something. It is \"The far [old, old 1st knowing] come close took by the littl [Riddley] come big\" (14).\n\nYoung Riddley is an English Adam, and, like those in R. W. B. Lewis's famous study, he is a figure \"of heroic innocence and vast potentialities, poised at the start of a new history\" (1). Riddley's moral posture is vulnerable, and one way in which he seeks knowledge about his condition is through dialogue with others. Like his American counterpart of the 1820s-1860s, Riddley questions the moral, intellectual, and artistic resources of man in a new society (Lewis 2), and his concerns are the same as the American Adam's: innocence, sin, experience, time, evil, hope, the present, memory, the past, and tradition (Lewis 2).\n\nUnhappily, Riddley cannot emancipate himself from history. Nor can he in any way be considered Adam before the fall; too much of his world is there to remind him of that fall. Yet, like the American Adam, \"he stands alone, self-reliant and self-propelling, ready to confront something with the aid of his own unique and inherent resources\" (Lewis 5).\n\nRiddley is also a picaresque saint. He is the creative rogue and law-breaker who strives to find meaning in a broken, seemingly hopeless world. Like his predecessors in this literary tradition, Riddley manages to eke out some sense of meaning, of purpose, for the life of the in"
