        "text": "Slightly Foxed Books\n\nSlightly Foxed brings back forgotten voices through its Slightly Foxed and Plain Foxed Editions, a series of beautifully produced little pocket hardback reissues of classic memoirs, all of them absorbing and highly individual. For younger bookworms – and nostalgic older ones too – there’s the Slightly Foxed Cubs series, in which we’ve reissued a number of classic nature and historical novels. Our online bookshop also includes a carefully-curated selection of titles from other publishers’ lists.\n\nView Books\n\nGifts\n\nAlmost everything listed on our website can be sent to you, or directly to a gift recipient together with a hand-written gift card. The office is well-stocked with smart gift cards, reams of brown wrapping paper and foxed ribbon. For last-minute gifts, we can send an e-gift card in advance of sending the subscription or item. You can arrange to do this during the checkout process.\n\nWelcome\n\nWelcome to our virtual kitchen table. Here you can read articles and extracts from the quarterly magazine and our books, catch up with newsletters, find out more about our writers and artists, use the online index to hunt down articles published in back issues and seek out books featured in the magazine, listen to episodes of our podcast, and much more besides.\n\nDive in\n\nBy signing up for our free email newsletter or our free printed catalogues, you will not automatically be subscribed to the quarterly magazine.
