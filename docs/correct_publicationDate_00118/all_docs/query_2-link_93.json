        "text": "Reviews by Evelyn C. Leeper\n\nAll reviews copyright 1984-2010 Evelyn C. Leeper.\n\nANGELICA'S GROTTO by Russell Hoban (Bloomsbury, ISBN 0-747-54611-8, 1999, 271pp, trade paperback ):\n\nRussell Hoban has written several science fiction and fantasy works (RIDDLEY WALKER and FREMDER among others), but this, like his previous book (MR RINYO-CLACTON'S OFFER) is a return to a non-fantastic setting. In fact, it bears some similarity to Hoban earlier TURTLE DIARY--both involve a man and a woman who need each other in dissimilar ways, and who come together to satisfy these needs without becoming romantically involved. Both also show Hoban's love of London in his detailed descriptions, and both have other, smaller touches that seem to run as threads through Hoban's work: beach stones, statues, and various off-beat allusions to homosexuality.\n\nThe protagonist, Harold Klein, has many features in common with Hoban--age, background, profession, etc. Nevertheless, it would probably be a mistake to read this as even semi-autobiographical. At the beginning of the book, Klein has lost his ability to keep his inner voice inside himself. So, for example, when he is talking to a woman and thinks, \"What a nice pair of breasts,\" he actually says it aloud. This, as one might expect, causes him problems. (In some way, this malady is the reverse--or perhaps the extension--of the bicameral mind that Julian Jaynes discussed. Jaynes theorized that the inner voice was at one time an actual voice that the individual heard and received as external. Whether this is an intentional reference or not, I have no idea.)\n\nBecause of his problems, Klein goes web surfing and discovers a porn site named \"Angelica's Grotto.\" He is fascinated by it, and its owner is fascinated, or at least interested, by him and contacts him for a study she is doing. Thus begins Klein's odyssey through an alien world.\n\nHoban's works concentrate on the connections between people, on their need for each other, and on the unusual forms this need can take, and this book is no exception. ANGELICA'S GROTTO is a disturbing book in some ways (and may prove too graphic for some readers), but it is ultimately a very human book.\n\nTHE BAT TATTOO by Russell Hoban:\n\n[From \"This Week's Reading\", MT VOID, 08/04/2006]\n\nThe back blurb from the \"Guardian\" for THE BAT TATTOO by Russell Hoban (ISBN 0-7475-6163-X) says that it \"completes a trilogy of masterful late works.\" I wish there had been some indication of what the other two books are. Internal evidence suggests that one is AMARYLLIS DAY AND NIGHT and the other is probably HER NAME IS LOLA. However, since I read the latter two years ago, and have the former still on my shelf of books to read, the trilogy aspect was lost on me. Luckily, it seems more a triptych than a trilogy, in that the books seem to be able to stand on their own. (I might compare the effect to one I mentioned in my comments on Christopher Priest's books a few weeks ago--that characters and places seem to recur throughout the different books.)\n\nIn THE BAT TATTOO, the main characters are Roswell Clark and Sarah Varley. Roswell is an artist/craftsperson who has had one big success with a toy involving crash-test dummies. Sarah is a dealer in \"objects d'art\" which she sells from a table at various street markets. Both of them are trying to get over the guilt they carry from their earlier relationships. The idea of two people in need, and in need of each other, is a recurring theme in Hoban's work, and he does it very well. Of course, the big problem is that most of his later works are not readily available in the United States. I bought THE BAT TATTOO and AMARYLLIS NIGHT AND DAY in Canada, and several others in Britain. The only book of his (other than children's books) that one sees here with any regularity seems to be RIDDLEY WALKER--a very good book, but very unlike any of his others. I don't think I've ever read a bad Hoban book, so any that you find are recommended.\n\nFREMDER by Russell Hoban (Jonathan Cape, ISBN 0-224-04370-6, 1996, 184pp, hardback ):\n\nIn the 21st century (a very different 21st century than that of Greg Egan's Distress, though they take place in only three years apart), Fremder Gorn is found floating in space sans space suit, sans helmet, sans everything--everything but life that is. This is considered strange, even in Gorn's universe of spaceports with robot sweepers under noctolux lamps cleaning up under signs saying \"Mikhail's Quiksnak\" and \"Q-Bo Sleep.\" Fremder Gorn's quest to find out how he came to be floating in space also involves finding out what happened to his mother, a famous inventor, and the almost predictable interaction with mysterious government agencies et al.\n\nBut Hoban is not so much a novelist as a poet. His classic Riddley Walker proves he has an eye for language and sounds rarely found in science fiction, and even his narratives written in more standard language (Kleinzeit, The Lion of Boaz-Jachin and Jachin-Boaz, The Medusa Frequency, Pilgermann, and Turtle Diary are the ones I know of) are more novel-length free verse than prose. I'm sure some lit-crit major will explain that there are strict rules for free verse that this doesn't meet. But to my untutored ear, a sentence like \"I've always considered sleep after lovemaking more intimate than the lovemaking: getting through the night together, lying embraced until an arm becomes numb, then lying together like two spoons until sleep doesn't come that way, then turning backs and reverting to aloneness together and the snores, farts, and sighs of the passage from darkness to morning. Katya in her sleep seemed to have no rest: she mumbled laughed, cursed, quoted from the Bible, sometimes in a voice that seemed different from her own.\" This is a book that cries out for a reading by the author.\n\nAnyone who has read any of Russell Hoban's works will immediately want to know how to get a copy of this, his latest and perhaps most traditional science fiction book. (This is not to say that it is traditional by any normal definition of the term, of course.) Unfortunately for us USans, this is available only in a British edition, and it will probably be a while before it crosses the Atlantic--assuming it ever does. (Why do I latch on to authors who are impossible to find here?) Of his other works I mentioned, only Riddley Walker (a post-holocaust novel) and Pilgermann (a first-person story by a Jew during the Crusades, perhaps best described as magical realism) have been published in the United States, where Hoban is known primarily as an author of children's books. His others--Kleinzeit (an eventful and mysterious day in the life of its eponymous hero), The Lion of Boaz-Jachin and Jachin-Boaz (a quest for lions in a country that seems to be modern England), The Medusa Frequency (involving the talking head of Orpheus and a Vermeer portrait), and Turtle Diary are the ones I know of--seem to be available only in British editions from Picador.\n\n(And now that I've pulled his other books off the shelf to refer to them, I want to go back and re-read them all.)\n\nHER NAME WAS LOLA by Russell Hoban:\n\n[From \"This Week's Reading\", MT VOID, 10/08/2004]\n\nRussell Hoban is one of my favorite authors, but his novels do not always get published in the United States. HER NAME WAS LOLA (Arcade, 1-55970-726-7) is his first to \"cross the pond\" (I believe) since ANGELICA'S GROTTO; the intervening AMARYLLIS NIGHT AND DAY and THE BAT TATTOO are available only in British editions. In LOLA, as in many of Hoban's books, the main character seems patterned after Hoban himself.\n\nMax Lesser is a Jewish expatriate American author living in England. Max is the author of many financially successful children's books and several financially unsuccessful novels. However, I do not think the novel itself is auto-biographical, any more than TURTLE DIARY (or RIDDLEY WALKER, his best know adult novel). Max meets first Lola Blessington, and then Lula Mae Flowers, and finds himself enmeshed in a romantic and sexual web. At the same time, he tries to break out of his writer's bloc with a novel about Moe Levy, who meets Lulu and Linda Lou under suspiciously similar circumstances. Apparently Max can talk to Moe; what's worse, Moe can talk back. Oh, and Max also has arguments with his own mind, and three-way conversations with his mind and the dwarf demon Apasmara Purusha, called Forgetfulness.\n\nHoban's style is (to me) quintessential magic realism, and incredibly poetic, and I wish his adult books were not so hard to find. (His earlier ones, such as PILGERMANN, THE LION OF BOAZ-JACHIN AND JACHIN-BOAZ, and TURTLE DIARY, do show up occasionally. RIDDLEY WALKER is unlike any of his other works-- it's great, but do not assume it is typical.) HER NAME WAS LOLA, like all of Hoban's books, gets a strong recommendation from me.\n\nLINGER AWHILE by Russell Hoban:\n\n[From \"This Week's Reading\", MT VOID, 01/22/2010]\n\nLINGER AWHILE by Russell Hoban (ISBN-13 978-1-56972-326-1) is Hoban's first return to science fiction since FREMDER (1996). Hoban uses a dozen points of view in this short novel, which makes it a bit hard to follow, but fits in well with the central idea of bringing a movie star to life from the \"visual DNA\" in the magnetic bits on a videotape of one of her films. (Okay, maybe this is more magical realism than science fiction, though the science fiction is really no less realistic than stuff that was written back in the pulps.) Because everyone has a different perspective on Justine Trimble, having the multiple points of view allows the reader to experience this, but it's hard work. However, Hoban crafts his writing to make it a joy to read:\n\n\"My eyesight was failing. Age-related macular degeneration was the diagnosis. The macula is that part of the eye that gives detail and depth perception. I frequently mistook flat surfaces for raised ones and shadows for substance.\"\n\nTHE LION OF BOAZ-JACHIN AND JACHIN-BOAZ by Russell Hoban:\n\n[From \"This Week's Reading\", MT VOID, 05/25/2007]\n\nTHE LION OF BOAZ-JACHIN AND JACHIN-BOAZ by Russell Hoban (ISBN-10 0-747-54908-7, ISBN-13 978-0-747-54908-6) was Hoban's first \"novel for grown-ups\" (as Auberon Waugh described it-- unfortunately \"adult novel\" has aquired a connotation that requires this circumlocution). Hoban starts with a quote from the Book of Job (10:16): \"For it increaseth. Thou huntest me as a fierce lion: and again thou shewest thyself marvellous upon me.\" But the names are from Chronicles II (3:17): \"And he reared up the pillars before the temple, one on the right hand, and the other on the left; and called the name of that on the right hand Jachin, and the name of that on the left Boaz.\"\n\nThe story is of Jachin-Boaz, a seller of maps, and his son Boaz- Jachin, a seeker of something. Set in an unspecified country at an unspecified future time when all lions are extinct, the two are somehow connected by a lion from a palace carving, of the distant past, but also of the present.\n\nHoban's writing is full of poetry and memorable phrases:\n\n\"Every person is like thousands of books. New, reprinting, in stock, out of stock, fiction, non-fiction, poetry, rubbish. The lot. Different every day. One's lucky to be able to put his hand on the one that's wanted, let alone know it.\"\n\nOr,\n\n\"How many people speak the same language even when they speak the same language?\" (pg. 154)\n\nOr,\n\n\"When you get to know a face or a voice or a smell you think the person isn't a stranger, but that's a lie.\" (pg. 59)\n\nEven the narrative passages are poetic: \"In the morning he was awakened by the sun on his face. There was a professional- looking seagull perching on the mast. It looked down at Boaz- Jachin with a contemptuous yellow eye that said, I'm ready for business and you're still asleep.\" (pg. 97) Note that the gull is \"perching\", not \"perched\"--it is not just sitting there, passively but sitting there actively, about to fly off."
