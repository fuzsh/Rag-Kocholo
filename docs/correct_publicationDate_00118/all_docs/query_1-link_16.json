        "text": "For some novelists, catastrophe is a narrative device. Russell Hoban was not the first to create a world after some apocalyptic event that has killed most of its inhabitants and destroyed civilisation. The tradition was begun as early as 1826 with Mary Shelley's The Last Man, describing how the few survivors of a deadly plague try to build a better world. In science fiction it was pursued in more than one John Wyndham novel, and by Walter M Miller's influential A Canticle for Leibowitz (1960), in which the monks of the Order of Leibowitz preserve human knowledge after a nuclear war. Where a dystopian novel imagines how a nightmarish social order might come through \"progress\", these stories imagine humanity without it.\n\nRiddley Walker takes us to \"Inland\", which is Kent at least 2,500 years after some nuclear cataclysm. Humanity is plunged into primitivism. The remnants of industrial civilisation are already sunk into the earth. Early in the novel Riddley and his group are digging out of the muck \"some girt big rottin iron think some kund of machine it wer you cudnt tel what it wer\". Even the English used by its eponymous narrator is crudely patched together from a language half-destroyed. The novel's territory is Riddley's, an area he traverses on foot (even horses seem unknown). There are a couple of passing references to the \"outland\" beyond this known area, and in one important episode Riddley discovers a boat that has come from somewhere across the sea, washed up with a dead man on board. But the larger world is unknown.\n\n\"Solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short\": such was the philosopher Thomas Hobbes's irresistible definition of the state of nature, \"wherein men live without other security, than what their own strength, and their own invention shall furnish them withal\". Hobbes offered his pithy summary as an antidote to those who might think \"the Natural Condition of Mankind\" is a happy one. And look at his use of the present tense: the state of nature is not something back in the past, before society developed; it is there all the time, ready to swallow us up. Riddley Walker uses catastrophe to inhabit this state.\n\nIn Riddley's small world, where characters have been given names announcing their characteristics (Fister Crunchman, Rightway Flinter), the protagonist is defined by his restlessness. He is always \"roading\", as he calls it, down the criss-crossing tracks that quaintly preserve their A-road designations. He will end the novel still travelling, though round and round \"Inland\" – going \"Fools Circel\", as he puts it. \"Walker is my name and I am the same.\" He calls his rare gift of writing \"walking\" too – \"walking my riddles . . . now on this paper\". His refusal to stay put is his curiosity, which leads him to puzzle about the remnants among which he lives, such as the enigmatic songs and chants with which people solace themselves. \"London town is drownt this day / Hear me say walk a way / Sling your bundle tern and go / Parments in the mud you know.\" There is no indication that the men who sing this as they work know what London or Parliament ever were. Like nursery rhymes, their songs carry the trace of what has been forgotten.\n\nWe see how myths get cobbled together as befuddled explanations of what might once have happened. People entertain themselves with puppet shows and pseudo-religious legends centring on the figure of \"Eusa\" (a name that conflates Jesus with St Eustace, whose life is obscurely depicted in a mural in Canterbury Cathedral). We recognise in their references to \"the Little Shyning Man the Addom\" and his \"E qwations\" the nuclear technology that has made this world. But the presiding spirit of their tales, called Mr Clevver, is an older survivor whom we understand better. \"Same red face and little black beard and the horns growing out of his head.\" People still give life to the old devil.\n\nMany of the tales of catastrophe that we tell ourselves are essentially comforting. They may be narratively pessimistic – the human race brings disaster on itself one way or another – but they are morally reassuring: if we could only change this or that behaviour, we would flourish. Riddley Walker has no message. The circumstances of the catastrophe are as unclear to us as to the novel's narrator. From The Day of the Triffids to The Day After Tomorrow, our favourite post-apocalyptic narratives involve the restoration of civilisation. Even the central narrative of David Mitchell's Cloud Atlas, in which a post-nuclear-holocaust world has unleashed human predatoriness, envisages a group that escapes savagery for a pacific way of life. Riddley Walker has no such grand narrative. It covers about 10 days in the life of someone who can hardly imagine a future – except to say of himself and his companion, \"Orfing and me we know weare living on burrow time but then who aint.\"\n\nJohn Mullan is professor of English at University College London."
