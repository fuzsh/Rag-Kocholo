Riddley Walker is haunting and fiercely imagined and--this matters most--intensely ponderable. --Benjamin DeMott, The New York Times Book Review\n\nThis is what literature is meant to be. --Anthony Burgess\n\nRussell Hoban has brought off an extraordinary feat of imagination and style. . . . The conviction and consistency are total. Funny, terrible, haunting and unsettling, this book is a masterpiece. --Anthony Thwaite, Observer\n\nExtraordinary . . . Suffused with melancholy and wonder, beautifully written, Riddley Walker is a novel that people will be reading for a long, long time. --Michael Dirda, Washington Post Book World\n\nStunning, delicious, designed to prevent the modern reader from becoming stupid. --John Leonard, The New York Times\n\nHighly enjoyable . . .

One reads it again and again, discovering new wonders every time through. Set in a remote future in a post-nuclear holocaust England (Inland), Hoban has imagined a humanity regressed to an iron-age, semi-literate state--and invented a language to represent it. Riddley is at once the Huck Finn and the Stephen Dedalus of his culture--rebel, change agent, and artist. Read again or for the first time this masterpiece of 20th-century literature with new material by the author."
