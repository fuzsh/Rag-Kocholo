        "text": "\"A hero with Huck Finn's heart and charm, lighting by El Greco and jokes by Punch and Judy.... Riddley Walker is haunting and fiercely imagined and--this matters most--intensely ponderable.\" --Benjamin DeMott, The New York Times Book Review\n\n\"This is what literature is meant to be.\" --Anthony Burgess\n\n\"Russell Hoban has brought off an extraordinary feat of imagination and style.... The conviction and consistency are total. Funny, terrible, haunting and unsettling, this book is a masterpiece.\" --Anthony Thwaite, Observer\n\n\"Extraordinary... Suffused with melancholy and wonder, beautifully written, Riddley Walker is a novel that people will be reading for a long, long time.\" --Michael Dirda, Washington Post Book World\n\n\"Stunning, delicious, designed to prevent the modern reader from becoming stupid.\" --John Leonard, The New York Times\n\n\"Highly enjoyable... An intriguing plot... Ferociously inventive.\" --Walter Clemons, Newsweek\n\n\"Astounding... Hoban's soaring flight of imagination is that golden rarity, a dazzlingly realized work of genius.\" --Jane Clapperton, Cosmopolitan\n\n\"An imaginative intensity that is rare in contemporary fiction.' --Paul Gray, Time\n\nRiddley Walker is a brilliant, unique, completely realized work of fiction. One reads it again and again, discovering new wonders every time through. Set in a remote future in a post-nuclear holocaust England (Inland), Hoban has imagined a humanity regressed to an iron-age, semi-literate state--and invented a language to represent it. Riddley is at once the Huck Finn and the Stephen Dedalus of his culture--rebel, change agent, and artist. Read again or for the first time this masterpiece of 20th-century literature with new material by the author."
