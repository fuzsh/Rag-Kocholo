I mean, I barely could understand the plot, since I watched a stunning HD print of the Italian dub, but I cannot find any subtitles, let alone an English dub (which I suspect would be for a shorter cut down version anyways). But in the absence of knowing the dialogue, I find great appreciation in the core, base elements of the film.\n\nWhere do we start? Might as well start with what grabbed me immediately as soon as the film started: The visual storytelling, cinematography, and compositions. This is where the film shines because this is amazing, especially in comparisonâ€¦"
