        "text": "From Pushkin to Putin, from Balanchine to Lake Baikal, from caviar to commissars, from yurts to baba yaga—Russia and Eurasia offer a glittering array of riches waiting to be discovered. We invite you to join with us in our exploration of the vast area of the world that we engage in on a daily basis. Through course work in language, literature, history and politics, you will gain a multidimensional understanding of the diverse peoples and cultures that inhabit this region—its past, its present, as well as its prospects for the future.\n\nWhether you choose to study the language, literature, history or politics of this vast region, you’ll become part of a close-knit company of students and teachers passionately committed to not only studying, but also experiencing Russia and Eurasia through in-country internships and study abroad. Your life will never be the same. We guarantee it.\n\nOur programs are intended to develop a critical awareness of both Russia and Eurasia and to provide the linguistic and intellectual tools necessary for sustained engagement with this area of the world. Mastery of Russian and a grasp of Russia’s historical role on the Eurasian continent are essential to developing a deep understanding of regions where native non-Russian peoples lived under Russian and Soviet rule.\n\nMajoring in Russian and Eurasian studies will help you gain a background in the cultures of Eurasia, where questions regarding global energy and the influence of Islamic culture are vitally important.\n\nWe offer both a major and minor in Russian and Eurasian studies as well as minors in Russian Language and Russian Culture and Literature.\n\nWhy study Russian?\n\nWith 160 million native speakers, Russian is among the top 10 most commonly studied languages, as well as being one of the top 10 most commonly spoken languages. Learning Russian connects you with speakers around the world, including in places and contexts you might not expect!\n\nCulture\n\nGeographically the largest country in the world, Russia has a long history with deep and rich cultural traditions.\n\nFrom Pushkin to Nabokov, the colossus of Russian literature speaks for itself. Russia has produced many of the world’s great literary giants. Reading these great authors in the original Russian is an eye-opening experience, given the grammatical complexities and cultural subtleties of the Russian language.\n\nRussia has equally rich traditions in film, art, and music. It is home to some of the biggest names in film and classical music (Tchaikovsky, anyone?). In addition, Russia created one of the most widely used ballet methodologies, it boasts arguably the top ballet companies, the Bolshoi and the Mariinsky, and it has produced some of the greatest ballet dancers of all time. Indeed, Russia's place in the arts is unrivaled - its literature, philosophy, music, ballet, architecture, painting, cinema and animation have all made their mark on world culture.\n\nEducation and Career Opportunities\n\nKnowing Russian is useful in many fields, from the arts to business and the sciences.\n\nStudying Russian helps you enter graduate programs. Students of Russian have a high acceptance rate for graduate study in law, business, and medicine.\n\nRussia ranks among the top 10 countries for entrepreneurship. It is the world’s largest producer of natural gas and is among the world’s largest producers of many other natural resources. Russia is also an enormous market for US goods and services.\n\nRussian is an important language for science and technology. More articles on the physical and life sciences are published in Russian than in English! Looking for a career in space? NASA relies on Russia to help with its launches and thus requires all potential astronauts to be fluent in Russian.\n\nThe US Government is always looking for Russian language specialists! Many federal agencies, including the State Department and the NSA, identify Russian as a priority language and are specifically seeking to employ Russian speakers.\n\nOur courses\n\nWe offers courses in Russian ranging from the elementary level (for students with no knowledge of Russian) through advanced-level courses in Russian language and culture. You can also take courses in Russian Literature, taught in English. For placement in Russian language courses, the department will review your course selection, taking into consideration your school and AP records together with your answers to a questionnaire and the results of your online placement exam.\n\nCourses on Russian literature and culture may be used to satisfy the distribution requirement in the humanities—arts, language, and literature.\n\nCourses on Russian history and politics satisfy distribution requirements either in the humanities (IB) or social sciences (III-A).\n\nWe are a five-college department and courses can be also taken through the Amherst College Russian Department, Smith College Russian Department, UMass Program in Slavic and East European Studies.\n\nSelecting courses in your first year\n\nIf you have no background in Russian language you should enroll in Russian 101-102, a yearlong introduction to Russian language and culture. If you have previously studied Russian and plan to elect Russian language, you should consult with the department for individual placement.\n\nIn addition to RES 101–102, recommended courses for first-year study include:\n\nRES 210f, Great Books: Literature of 19th Century Russia\n\nRES 240f, Contemporary Russian Politics"
