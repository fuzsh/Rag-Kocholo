        "text": "About the Program\n\nMinor\n\nThe Department of Slavic Languages and Literatures offers a minor in Russian Language. There is no major in Russian Language. Students who wish to major in Russian language, literature, or culture should choose the appropriate major track offered by the Slavic Languages and Literatures major.\n\nHeritage Speakers of Russian\n\nHeritage speakers include those who grew up in Russian speaking families but are without a standard Russian language educational background. Heritage speakers of Russian are not eligible for this minor. However, heritage speakers may choose any of the department's other minors (see links below).\n\nDeclaring the Minor\n\nStudents considering a minor track involving language requirements must see the undergraduate student services adviser early on to have their minor study list plan reviewed and approved. Final approval for a minor rests with the major adviser. The paperwork for the minor, called an L&S Confirmation of Minor form, is completed with the undergraduate student services adviser no later than the semester before the student's Expected Graduation Term (EGT).\n\nOther Minors offered by the Department of Slavic Languages and Literatures\n\nArmenian Studies (Minor only)\n\nEast European/Eurasian Languages and/or Cultures (Minor only)\n\nRussian Culture (Minor only)\n\nRussian Literature (Minor only)\n\nSlavic Languages and Literatures (Major only)\n\nVisit Department Website\n\nAdvising\n\nThe department provides programmatic and individual advising services to prospective and current students who are pursuing major and minor tracks.
