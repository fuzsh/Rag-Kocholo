        "text": "With the OP's permission (thank you, Eef!), here's a repost of a (subjective) list of top several Russian-language movies commonly used in language classes (for more info on individual titles, check out imdb):\n\nOffice Romance (–°–ª—É–∂–µ–±–Ω—ã–π —Ä–æ–º–∞–Ω), 1977\n\nMoscow doesn't believe in tears (–ú–æ—Å–∫–≤–∞ —Å–ª–µ–∑–∞–º –Ω–µ –≤–µ—Ä–∏—Ç), 1980\n\nThe irony of fate (–ò—Ä–æ–Ω–∏—è —Å—É–¥—å–±—ã –∏–ª–∏ —Å –ª—ë–≥–∫–∏–º –ø–∞—Ä–æ–º), 1975\n\nLove and doves, (–õ—é–±–æ–≤—å –∏ –≥–æ–ª—É–±–∏),1985\n\nOnly \"old men\" are going into battle (–í –±–æ–π –∏–¥—É—Ç –æ–¥–Ω–∏ \"—Å—Ç–∞—Ä–∏–∫–∏\"), 1974\n\nOperation Y and Shurik's other adventures, (–û–ø–µ—Ä–∞—Ü–∏—è \"–´\" –∏ –¥—Ä—É–≥–∏–µ –ø—Ä–∏–∫–ª—é—á–µ–Ω–∏—è –®—É—Ä–∏–∫–∞), 1965\n\nThese are usually picked not only for the quality of spoken Russian, but also because they form shared cultural baggage for anyone over 40 from ex-Soviet states.\n\nRunner-ups (not commonly used in language classes, but also part of that baggage - and might be of interest:\n\nMary Poppins, Good Bye (–ú–µ—Ä–∏ –ü–æ–ø–ø–∏–Ω—Å, –î–æ —Å–≤–∏–¥–∞–Ω–∏—è) - a tacky but cute Soviet take on the British classic (Eef, you might enjoy seeing Lembit Ulfsak of \"Tangerines\" fame in a couple of episodes)\n\nThe adventures of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, (–ü—Ä–∏–∫–ª—é—á–µ–Ω–∏—è –®–µ—Ä–ª–æ–∫–∞ –•–æ–ª–º—Å–∞ –∏ –¥–æ–∫—Ç–æ—Ä–∞ –í–∞—Ç—Å–æ–Ω–∞) 1979 - mid80s. A quality take on Mr. Conan Doyle's classic, very slow-paced, but very, very well done.\n\nSeventeen Moments of Spring (–°–µ–º–Ω–∞–¥—Ü–∞—Ç—å –º–≥–Ω–æ–≤–µ–Ω–∏–π –≤–µ—Å–Ω—ã) - a 12-part mini-series\n\nThe Meeting Place Cannot Be Changed (–ú–µ—Å—Ç–æ –≤—Å—Ç—Ä–µ—á–∏ –∏–∑–º–µ–Ω–∏—Ç—å –Ω–µ–ª—å–∑—è) - a 5-part mini-series\n\nAs a follow-up, here‚Äôs a short list of modern Russian movies that are ultimately watchable, even with subtitles, and offer a better understanding of social and cultural background, popular perceptions, biases, and views on some key historic events, and, more generally, a ‚Äúshared cultural code‚Äù of some of the people you might meet when you visit the country.\n\nAgain, most of these should be readily available through the main streaming platforms ‚Äì if not, there‚Äôs always sovietmoviesonline.com.\n\nThe Nineties:\n\nBrother (–ë—Ä–∞—Ç), 1997 * - a must see for a first-approximation understanding of what the nineties meant for an average Russian, and what Saint Petersburg looked and felt like after the dissolution of USSR\n\nThe movie started off a landslide of noir ‚ÄúRussian gangster‚Äù movies, with the most notable ones listed below:\n\nBrother 2 (–ë—Ä–∞—Ç/2), 2000, a much more commercial sequel;\n\nBummer/Beemer (–ë—É–º–µ—Ä), 2002,\n\nBlind Man‚Äôs Bluff (–ñ–º—É—Ä–∫–∏)\n\nInteresting to see the evolution from the ‚Äútragedy‚Äù and bona-fide romanticization of strong gangster characters (Beemer) to a farcical, parody take (Blind Man‚Äôs Bluff)\n\nAlso in this category:\n\nThe Rifleman of the Voroshilov Regiment (–í–æ—Ä–æ—à–∏–ª–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏–π —Å—Ç—Ä–µ–ª–æ–∫), 1997, which pre-dates Brother but has some similar themes; Country of the Deaf (–°—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω–∞ –≥–ª—É—Ö–∏—Ö, 1998) - also nineties, included for the first screen appearance of Chulpan Khamatova and a beautiful soundtrack by Alexey Aigui; Nenaste (–ù–µ–Ω–∞—Å—Ç—å–µ), a 2018 mini-series rather accurately and carefully addressing the \"vet brotherhood\" phenomenon after Soviet war in Afghanistan and revisiting the 90s.\n\nWar in Chechnya:\n\nPrisoner of the Mountains (–ö–∞–≤–∫–∞–∑—Å–∫–∏–π –ø–ª–µ–Ω–Ω–∏–∫, 1996), Checkpoint (–ë–ª–æ–∫–ø–æ—Å—Ç) 1999, War (B–æ–π–Ω–∞, 2002)\n\nRussian Doom And Gloom (easily the best-represented genre, usually very well done cinematographically, with the general idea that the society is irreparably bad, people are intrinsically evil, and there is no hope or future):\n\nLeviathan (–õ–µ–≤–∏–∞—Ñ–∞–Ω, 2014)\n\n(Also in this category Elena (–ï–ª–µ–Ω–∞, 2011), A long and happy life (–î–æ–ª–≥–∞—è —Å—á–∞—Å—Ç–ª–∏–≤–∞—è –∂–∏–∑–Ω—å, 2013), The Fool(–î—É—Ä–∞–∫, 2014), Loveless (–ù–µ–ª—é–±–æ–≤—å, 2017).\n\nNot so gloomy (things are bad, but there might ‚Äì just might ‚Äì be a glimpse of light in the end of the tunnel):\n\nMermaid (–†—É—Å–∞–ª–∫–∞), 2007 *\n\n12 (2007) *\n\nArrhythmia (–ê—Ä–∏—Ç–º–∏—è) 2017 *\n\nDoctor Lisa (–î–æ–∫—Ç–æ—Ä –õ–∏–∑–∞), 2020\n\nNon-conformism and quest for liberty in a watchable lighthearted package:\n\nStilyagi, or \"Hipsters\" (–°—Ç–∏–ª—è–≥–∏) 2008 * - about non-conformist youth of the late 50s, a musical\n\nSummer (–õ–µ—Ç–æ), 2018 - about non-conformist youth of the 80s.\n\nEdited to replace Youtube links to movie trailers with links to imdb descriptions and discussion boards, which are way more helpful\n\nSo yes, to kind of round it off I also wanted to mention several post-Soviet movies that some people would be quick to discount as \"propaganda\". I don't necessarily agree: they are all solid movies, with some good (and sometimes very good) acting and historic accuracy. It's the subject matter that matters here...\n\nSpace exploration:\n\nSpace walk (2017) –í—Ä–µ–º—è –ü–µ—Ä–≤—ã—Ö\n\nGagarin (2013) –ì–∞–≥–∞—Ä–∏–Ω: –ø–µ—Ä–≤—ã–π –≤ –∫–æ—Å–º–æ—Å–µ\n\nWWII:\n\nFortress of War (–ë—Ä–µ—Å—Ç—Å–∫–∞—è –∫—Ä–µ–ø–æ—Å—Ç—å), 2010\n\nBattle for Sevastopol (–ù–µ–∑–ª–∞–º–Ω–∞), 2014. The title is quite misleading, it's actually a decent-quality biopic on Lyudmila Pavlichenko, one of the better known female snipers of WWII.\n\nAugust 1944 (–í –∞–≤–≥—É—Å—Ç–µ 44–≥–æ), a slow-paced movie on military counterintelligence. More of a detective story; not without its faults, but quite watchable.\n\nThe whole \"propaganda\" negative bias against them is something that I have a bit of a hard time finding a logical explanation for. For space films, for instance, if you take a patriotism/propaganda scale of one to ten, with an Attenborough-style BBC documentary on space race at 1, something uber patriotic (if not jingoistic) and cliched like Armageddon at 10, and \"healthily patriotic\" and technically and historically accurate Apollo 13 at, say, four, -both Russian movies would probably end up somewhere smack in the middle.\n\nI wonder if it's the fact that other nations' patriotism is almost always bound to be perceived as alien and less worthy than your own? Or could it be due to the fact that most Russian movies open up with credits to the Ministry of Culture of the Russian Federation? That much is true, but it is also true for all the movies from my previous post, which are very markedly anti-establishment. It's just a fact of life - Russian government annually earmarks about $100 million in grants, interest-free loans, and subsidies to support the domestic film industry, and there are many, many takers.\n\nFor war movies, though, it's a bit more complicated. It would seem that the Great Patriotic War legacy offers an easy pathway to boosting post-Soviet national pride, and the government does try to use the memory of the war for nation-building purposes. This resulted in a plethora of barely watchable high-CGI low-IQ blockbusters, but the three examples I quoted above are actually quite decent action films. The problem is, the bar for war movies has been set quite high by Soviet filmmakers, and, with very few exceptions, the best Soviet war movies are best described as \"movies about war/anti-war propaganda\", rather than \"action films/entertainment\":\n\nFate of a man (1959) –°—É–¥—å–±–∞ —á–µ–ª–æ–≤–µ–∫–∞\n\nBallad of a Soldier (1959) –ë–∞–ª–ª–∞–¥–∞ –æ —Å–æ–ª–¥–∞—Ç–µ\n\nThe cranes are flying (1957) –õ–µ—Ç—è—Ç –∂—É—Ä–∞–≤–ª–∏\n\nIvan's childhood (1962) –ò–≤–∞–Ω–æ–≤–æ –¥–µ—Ç—Å—Ç–≤–æ\n\nThe dawns are quiet here (1972) –ê –∑–æ—Ä–∏ –∑–¥–µ—Å—å —Ç–∏—Ö–∏–µ\n\nTwo out of 20 million (1987) –°–æ—à–µ–¥—à–∏–µ —Å –Ω–µ–±–µ—Å\n\nAnd what in my opinion is one of the most powerful antiwar films of all times:\n\n–°ome and See (1985) –ò–¥–∏ –∏ —Å–º–æ—Ç—Ä–∏"
