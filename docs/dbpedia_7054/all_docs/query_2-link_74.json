        "text": "Overview\n\nRussian Studies at The College of Wooster\n\nRussian Studies at Wooster is an interdisciplinary program, offering courses in Russian language, literature, culture and film. Students focus on Russia and Eurasia in their cultural, historical, and political contexts, developing proficiency in the Russian language in connection with their other academic and professional interests.

Our students have successfully pursued double majors with programs like Global and International Studies, Political Science, Mathematics, and English, among others.\n\nFaculty and students in Russian Studies form a close and lively community. Faculty are always available for conversations about courses, life in Russia, and are glad to practice the Russian language informally outside of class. Often students live in the Russian House, a suite in Luce Hall. Wooster’s Russian language assistant, a graduate student from Russia, lives on campus and organizes informal events in Luce (Russian Tea, Russian Movie Night, Masterclass in Russian cookery). The department also organizes outings to Russian-related cultural events in Cleveland and other nearby cities.\n\nWhat are the careers or graduate school paths for students who major in Russian Studies at The College of Wooster?\n\nRussian Studies majors and minors pursue a wide range of careers.

This experience gives students a strong foundation in research that prepares them well for a variety of careers.\n\nWhy Study Russian?\n\nRussian is spoken by 260,000,000 people, with just under one million speakers in the United States.\n\nA regional power in Eurasia, Russia is returning to the world arena as an important player in this globalized world. It controls natural gas and oil delivery to many European countries, and is a major player in space exploration, arms manufacturing, aerospace production and electrical engineering.\n\nRussian opens a window into the rich culture of literary giants Tolstoy and Dostoevsky, the enchanting musical spectacle of Tchaikovsky and Stravinsky, avant-garde art of Kandinsky and Malevich and extraordinary cinematic experiments of Eisenstein and Tarkovsky.\n\nRussian is strategically important in scientific spheres such as aerospace engineering, information technology, and nuclear technology, among others.\n\nRussian is classified as a “critical needs language” by the US government, and Russian specialists are regularly recruited by government agencies.\n\nWith knowledge of Russian, your resume will stand out among those of your peers, especially when applying to graduate programs like law school, medical school and business school.\n\nStudents of Russian at the College of Wooster have a record of success: they have been awarded the prestigious Fulbright research and teaching scholarships to Russia and Kyrgyzstan and won the competitive Critical Language Scholarship to Moscow, funded by the US government.
