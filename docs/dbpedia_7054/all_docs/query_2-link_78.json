Lioudmila Fedorova, Bradley Gorski, George Mihaychuk, Jill Neuendorf, Svetlana Grenier & Olga Meerson\n\nThursday 2:00–2:50 PM\n\nCourse Taught in English\n\nThis one-credit course is a survey of major topics in Russian culture from its beginnings to the present.

And we shall have to consider how one can reconcile his championing clarity and simplicity with the complexity of his literary texts and his views on life. We will examine these issues in several works: an early story from the Sebastopol Tales, his great novel War and Peace, “Khadji Murat,” “The Death of Ivan Ilich,” his play The Power of Darkness, and his booklet What is Art? (3 credits; HALC)\n\nRUSS 4467: Pushkin: Paradoxes of Freedom\n\nProf. Svetlana Grenier\n\nTu/Th 5:00–6:15 PM\n\nCourse Taught in Russian\n\nStudents will read and analyze a selection of lyrics, two narrative poems (verse tales: The Gypsies and The Bronze Horseman), one or two of Little Tragedies (verse drama), and one or two of The Tales of Belkin (stories in prose). We will consider Pushkin’s work in the context of European Romanticsm and Realism. This is an upper-level Russian course, taught primarily in Russian. (3 credits; HALC)\n\nRUSS 4472: The Russian Short Story\n\nProf. Olga Meerson\n\nMW 3:30–4:45 PM\n\nCourse Taught in English\n\nThis course introduces stories by major Russian writers starting with Karamzin, then sampling the 19th Century Classics—ranging from Pushkin, Gogol, Lermontov, Tolstoy, Leskov, and, bridging into the 20th century, Chekhov. In the 20th Century, it comprises authors ranging from Kharms, Platonov, Bulgakov, and Zoshchenko, through Nabokov and then, the Post-Soviet Pelevin and Sorokin, thus bridging into the 21st century and issues of burning relevance today, both poetic and political.
