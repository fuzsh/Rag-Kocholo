Students are asked to submit a one-page application that includes a narrative description of their plans as well as a preliminary budget. These grants are distributed based on the merit and feasibility of the project described, and students may apply more than once for this grant.\n\nStudy abroad opportunity\n\nStudy Abroad in Russia and Eastern Europe\n\nMultiple programs are available through the School of Russian and Asian Studies, a World Partner program affiliated with Syracuse Abroad. In Riga, Latvia, an intensive and supportive environment for Russian language study is paired with the option of a home stay to provide you with an immersive language and cultural experience. Out-of-classroom experiences, special lectures and workshops will give you ample opportunity to use the Russian language while introducing you to local Latvian identity, history and current issues in Latvia today."
