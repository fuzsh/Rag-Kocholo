        "text": "The major in Russian Language and Literature aims to provide a solid foundation in the Russian language and a broad, interdisciplinary introduction to the culture of Russian-speaking regions. Our particular strength is russophone literary culture during the Imperial, Soviet, and post-Soviet periods. The program grounds the study of literature and film in specific historical, social, and cultural contexts. It includes the study of elements of literary and cultural theory. The major also fosters a broad interdisciplinary perspective on the region by encouraging students to take relevant courses in such fields as history, philosophy, political science, art history, and music. Students may count up to two courses approved for the minor in Slavic and East European Studies toward the major in Russian.\n\nRussian majors are expected to achieve a degree of language fluency that will enable them to enter into dialogue with regions where Russian is used, as readers, writers, and speakers of a language native to over 170 million people around the world. Coursework includes materials in the original ranging from literary classics to current journalism and other mass media.\n\nProgram Learning Goals\n\nMajors in Russian language and literature will have a solid foundation in the Russian language and a broad, interdisciplinary introduction to the culture (particularly literary culture) of Russian-speaking regions. Majors will demonstrate a grasp of critical practices, including close readings, and an ability to analyze Russian-language literature within specific historical, social, and cultural contexts. Students will be able to critically examine how Russian-language literatures construct particular models of reality and sets of values. Students will be able to communicate complex ideas effectively in standard written English, and to critically evaluate sources and use the conventions of citation and attribution correctly. Majors are also expected to study Russian-language literature within a broad interdisciplinary perspective in order to analyze and synthesize information and ideas from multiple disciplines, including Comparative Literature, Cinema Studies, History, Art History, and the history and politics of Soviet and post-Soviet Russia, eastern Europe, and the broader region.\n\nMajors will be able to demonstrate language proficiency at the 300-level or above, i.e., be able to communicate effectively in the language, read a variety of literary and non-literary texts in the original, achieve intermediate to advanced proficiency in speaking, reading, and writing, and demonstrate a knowledge of the structure of Russian. Majors will also learn how to effectively use tools (reference works, internet, etc.) and technology appropriate to learning Russian.\n\nThe major consists of a minimum of 36 credits or 12 courses in Russian language and literature, including at least 18 credits at or above the 200 level. Students must complete all required coursework for the major or minor with grades of C or better. All majors must fulfill the following requirements:\n\nsix language courses beyond 101. One semester of the Practicum may count toward language credit. Students whose knowledge of Russian places them beyond 01:860:302 are required to substitute other 860 courses to complete a total of 36 credits.\n\ntwo surveys: 01:860:259 (Introduction to 19th Century Russian Literature) and 01:860:260 (Introduction to 20th Century Russian Literature)\n\n01:860:315 Reading Russian Literature in Russian\n\nthree electives offered in the department at the 200-400 level, at least one of which must be a 400 level course. Note: beginning in Fall 2024, majors may also count up to two courses approved for the \"Minor in Slavic and East European Studies\" (861) toward the Russian major\n\nIn addition to these course requirements, each Russian major will complete the following in early April of their senior year:\n\nsubmit a portfolio of 3 papers (of the student's choosing) from literature and culture courses taken in the program, at least one of which is from a 400-level course. Please make sure to include the prompt for the paper when putting together your portfolio!\n\ntake oral and written proficiency tests in Russian.\n\nsubmit a short exit essay (suggested length 2-4 pages). This is an informal essay in which students will be asked to reflect on their experiences in the Russian Program.\n\nThese materials will be used for internal evaluation to ensure that Russian majors are meeting the learning goals of the program. They will not be graded and will not be entered into the student's record or reflected in the transcript.\n\n*Students whose knowledge of Russian places them beyond 01:860:302 are required to substitute other 860 courses to complete 37 credits.\n\nLooking to minor in Russian (860) or in Slavic and East European Studies (861)?
