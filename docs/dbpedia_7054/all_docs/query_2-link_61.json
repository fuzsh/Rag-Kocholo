Youâ€™ll gain high-impact practical experience that deepens learning and opens doors.\n\nRussian Area Studies students at HWS delve deep into Russian language, history, and culture through language-intensive study abroad. The Russian Area Studies program is committed to providing engaging and valuable study abroad options in countries that also ensure the safety of its students.\n\nIn the past, students have studied in Barnaul and Yaroslavl, including grant-funded summer opportunities through the Fulbright-Hays program. While the current political situation precludes students from traveling to Russia to study, there are many options available in other countries with large Russian-speaking communities, including European Union member countries Latvia and Lithuania.\n\nFor the summer of 2022, the Russian Area Studies department's program took place in Daugavpils, Latvia, where students had one-on-one conversation sessions with college students who were native Russian speakers.\n\nWherever you go, our top-ranked global education program will allow you to apply classroom knowledge, develop cultural understanding and build global connections that expand your personal capacity and sense of purpose.\n\nHere are some of the courses that allow you to explore and embrace all aspects and areas of Russia.\n\nRUSE 203 RUSSIAN PRISON LITERATURE\n\nGain insight into the responses from those falsely imprisoned under the dictatorship of Josef Stalin.\n\nRUSE 206 AMERICA THROUGH RUSSIAN EYES\n\nView American culture and identity with a Russian lens by studying readings and films by American and Russian poets, novelists, and directors.\n\nRUSE 208 FANTASTIKA: SCI-FI AND FANTASY IN THE RUSSIAN WORLD\n\nExplore how science fiction and fantasy relate to the Russian cultural and historical context and the ideological stance they portray.\n\nRUSE 237 RUSSIAN FOLKLORE\n\nSurvey a wealth of Russian and Slavic folk tales, epic songs, legends, riddles, and other elements of the oral tradition, as well as the later literatures these genres inspired.\n\nbea hoffman '23\n\nCurrent Position:\n\nAdministrative Assistant, Preservation of Affordable Housing Communities\n\nCurrent Location:\n\nBoston, MA\n\nMajors:\n\nRussian Language and Culture, Dance, English\n\n\"HWS, and especially the Russian Area Studies program, prepared me for my current role as my day-to-day work consists of frequent interactions with residents who live in the affordable housing complex where my office is located. A majority of the residents speak solely Russian, or Russian with some English. While I am not fluent, I am able to put them at ease and communicate enough, which is something I could not have ever considered before attending HWS!\"\n\nCOMPANIES THAT EMPLOY OUR GRADUATES\n\nColumbia University\n\nFederal Bureau of Investigation\n\nMIT Skoltech Initiative\n\nOverseas Strategic Consulting\n\nRussian American Foundation\n\nTechnoServe\n\nU.S. Department of Defense (Dept. of the Air Force)\n\nU.S. Department of State\n\nUNIVERSITIES WHERE OUR GRADUATES ARE STUDYING\n\nColumbia University Graduate School of Arts and Sciences\n\nColumbia University Teachers College\n\nGeorgetown University\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n\nNortheastern University\n\nSimmons University\n\nUniversity of Colorado Josef Korbel School of International Studies\n\nUniversity of Wisconsin-Madison Graduate School"
