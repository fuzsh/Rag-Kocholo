        "text": "RUS 232: Twentieth-Century Russian Literature in Translation. Spring of every even year I teach this survey of the main trends and themes of 20th-century Russian literature in the context of Russian and Soviet history. Authors we read include Chekhov, Zinovieva-Annibal, Sholem Aleichem, Zamiatin, Nabokov, Bulgakov, Pasternak, Shalamov, Solzhenitsyn, Erofeev, and Petrushevskaya.\n\nClick here for the most recent syllabus for Russian 232\n\nRUS 250: Russian Cinema. Spring of every odd year I teach this survey of the major themes of Russian cinema from the silent era to today. In this course I strive for a balance between the “big names” of Russian cinema that you might find in Film Studies classes and those popular films that most Russians watch and quote regularly and are part of popular Russian culture."
