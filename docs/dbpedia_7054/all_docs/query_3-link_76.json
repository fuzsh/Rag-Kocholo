        "text": "Should Boris Johnson wish to get more involved in Ukraine’s war than he is already, Edward Leonov and his Scales of Justice militia are waiting for him.\n\nA volunteer brigade based near the Black Sea port of Mykolaiv, they are preparing for an offensive to retake the nearby Russian-occupied city of Kherson. And last week, they issued an invitation to Johnson to join them.\n\n“He is a great guy, who has helped us when others have not, so he is welcome in our ranks whenever he wants,” said Leonov, who was in Kyiv’s Independence Square to attend a commander’s funeral. “And we love his hair, too.”\n\nHis hair? Yes, strange as it may seem, it is not just the Prime Minister’s generous supplies of anti-tank missiles that have won him the support of Leonov and his men. What they also admire is his unruly flaxen mop. For in their eyes, it embodies the anarchic spirit of Ukraine’s Cossacks – the rebel warriors who have come to symbolise the country’s resistance against Russia.\n\nFamed for their fighting prowess and horsemanship, the Cossacks were Eastern Europe’s answer to Robin Hood and his Merry Men. They lived in self-governing communities in the vast Ukrainian steppe, resisting imperial authority from east or west.\n\nHalf a millennium later, the war against Moscow may be one of missiles rather than muskets – yet for Leonov, the Cossack spirit is why Ukraine has had the courage to stand up to its mightier neighbour.\n\n“The Cossacks symbolise our culture of freedom, especially in wartime,” he says, gesturing to a comrade who lost both legs to a landmine yet has returned to the front on prosthetics. “We are the people who never leave the front lines, even when it might be safer to do so.”\n\nOn that note, even the stunt-loving Johnson might want to think twice before taking up Leonov’s invitation. Yet should he prefer a more ceremonial Cossack role, he will not be short of offers either.\n\nTwo weeks ago, he was declared an honorary Cossack by a community in the northern town of Chernihiv. Two local artists painted a picture of him as Cossack Mamay – a horse-riding, lute-strumming, all-action hero of Ukrainian folklore.\n\nIt depicted Johnson dressed in traditionally baggy Cossack cavalry trousers, together with a sword and hip flask. The two items symbolise the traditional Cossack’s hard-living, hard-drinking lifestyle – aspects of which the star of partygate might approve. Chernihiv’s city officials have sent a copy of the painting to Downing Street, in “gratitude to this outstanding person who has been supporting Ukraine”.\n\nGiven that Johnson has a street named after him in Odesa, and a croissant in Kyiv, his new-found Cossack status may seem like just another minor civic accolade. That, though, would be to underestimate the symbolic power that Cossack culture has in Ukraine, especially in the light of hostilities with Russia over the past two decades.\n\nToday, Cossack cultural societies abound in Ukraine, as do Cossack-named bars, cafés and folk bands. A Ukrainian software firm has produced a hit Cossack-themed video game featuring battles against marauding Prussians and Tsarists. Even the traditional Cossack hairstyle has enjoyed a revival – a top knot with shaved sides that would not look out of place on the average Hoxton hipster.\n\nSo for the benefit of Johnson’s own public – some of whom may know nothing about Cossacks except their legendary kick-dance, the “hopak” – who exactly were they? The answer goes back 500 years, to when what is now Ukraine was known as the Wild Fields – a vast no-man’s land between the Russian and Polish empires.\n\nAs Anna Reid, the Telegraph’s former Kyiv correspondent, notes in her book Borderland, it became a bolt-hole for all manner of outcasts: fallen nobles, rebellious serfs, the indebted, unfrocked and disgraced.\n\nFrom the chaos, though, emerged a landscape of self-governing semi-martial societies, which had no written laws but elected their own leaders. When it suited them, they fought for both the Russians and the Poles. But mostly they fought for themselves. As Reid puts it: “Outlaws and frontiersmen, fighters and pioneers, the Cossacks are to the Ukrainian national consciousness what cowboys are to the American.”\n\nTrue, Cossack mini-states like Zaporizhian Sich on Ukraine’s River Dnieper were the Dodge Cities of Central Europe – violent, anarchic and macho. Women were banned from even entering. And much time was spent drinking huge quantities of “horilka”, a fiery moonshine vodka.\n\nBut Cossack life instilled a rough-and-ready culture of liberty that Ukrainians say distinguishes them from Russians, who were under Tsarist absolute rule.\n\nSlavic Spartas like the Zaporizhian Sich did not last. Catherine the Great destroyed it as part of Russification in the 17th century, while the Bolsheviks repressed all aspects of Cossack culture. When the Soviet Union collapsed, though, it was revived, and has since become closely associated with Ukraine’s nationalist cause.\n\nNot every aspect of Cossack culture is celebrated. Over the centuries, they also acted as regime strongmen and freelance thugs, carrying out pogroms against Jews. Some Cossacks in Crimea still ally themselves with the Kremlin, and were deployed to beat up pro-Ukrainians during Vladimir Putin’s annexation of the peninsula in 2014.\n\nNone the less, the Cossack-style hairdo – or variations of it – have gained popularity since the war. At last week’s military funeral in Kyiv, for example, Leonov and many other mourners sported the classic Cossack “osoledets” – a single lock of hair on an otherwise smooth-shaven head.\n\n“When a Cossack dies in battle, God grabs him by the hair to pull him to heaven,” explained mourner Volodymr Lusyuk, who also wore full traditional Cossack dress.\n\nSometimes nicknamed the “medieval mullet”, the osoledets is such a symbol of Cossack culture that the Russian word for it is now used as a slur for Ukrainians. For those who want something more mainstream, meanwhile, there is its loose cousin, the “czupryna” – a half-shaven head with ponytail on top.\n\nTrue, the Cossacks’ male-centric world no longer reflects 21st-century Ukraine, where women play an active role on the front lines. But even that is now changing, according to Oleksandr Chernish of the Kyiv-based Cossack Guard of Ukraine, who is pioneering what might loosely be described as a “progressive Cossack” movement.\n\nRather than just brawling, drinking and espousing fiery nationalism, his group runs social programmes and children’s adventure days. He is even trying to push the term “Kosakchtka” – or Cossack woman – something that might have had the old-timers choking on their horilka.\n\n“It’s no longer just men who can defend our country, and besides, our problems don’t just come from our neighbours,” he says. “We also need to reform our whole society if we want to build a better, stronger Ukraine.”\n\nEven the Cossacks of old, one imagines, might raise a glass to that.\n\nColin Freeman’s book ‘Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea’ is out now."
