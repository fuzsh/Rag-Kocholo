The course focuses on building a high level of competence in language skills and allows you to explore topics of interest within Russian-language culture and history.\n\nThe course is available to both students who are beginners in Russian and to more advanced students who have an SQA Higher or a GCE A-Level qualification in Russian. Advanced students will follow a separate language course for the first two years.\n\nIn the first two years, students of all levels will build on their Russian language skills and are offered a broad view of Russian-language literatures, histories and cultures.\n\nAlongside Russian, in the first year of your studies, you will be required to study an additional two subjects. In the second year you will usually carry on at least one of these subjects, sometimes two. Find out more about how academic years are organised.\n\nDuring your third and fourth year, you will take modules focused on communication skills and can choose to specialise in a number of areas, such as Russian literature, film or cultural history.\n\nGraduates in modern languages from St Andrews can expect to have not only a high level of competency in language skills, but a highly developed appreciation for other cultures and peoples. Other transferable skills, including analysis, synthesis and communication skills will prepare you for a career in almost any sphere.\n\nThe University of St Andrews operates on a flexible modular degree system by which degrees are obtained through the accumulation of credits. More information on the structure of the modules system can be found on the flexible degree structure web page.\n\nModules\n\nIn the first two years of your degree (known as sub-honours), you will take the required modules in Russian along with modules in at least one additional subject.\n\nA single Honours student will take one Russian module per semester during the first two years, and four Russian modules per semester during third and fourth years (known as Honours).\n\nFirst year\n\nSecond year\n\nHonours\n\nTwo different types of module are offered in first year: intensive foundation courses for beginners, and advanced language and literature courses for those with higher entrance qualifications. For all modules, speaking in Russian is practised in small groups with a native speaker.\n\nStudents who are beginners are required to take the following compulsory modules in their first year:\n\nElementary Russian Language 1: provides the most basic elements of Russian – the alphabet, vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation.\n\nElementary Russian Language 2: provides training in Russian grammar sufficient for reading Russian texts (books, newspapers, etc) with the aid of a dictionary.\n\nStudents who have an SQA Higher or GCE A-level in Russian will take the following compulsory modules in first year:\n\nAdvanced Elementary Russian Language and Literature 1: reinforces and builds on the knowledge of grammar and vocabulary acquired at school, develops translation and oral skills, and studies literary texts in Russian.\n\nAdvanced Elementary Russian Language and Literature 2: covers elements of grammar, translation, text analysis, study of literature, and includes oral tuition classes with a native language instructor.\n\nThe distinction between beginners and non-beginners is maintained in year two, with separate sets of modules depending on your previous experience.\n\nStudents who are ex-beginners are required to take the following compulsory modules in their second year:\n\nIntermediate Russian Language 1: builds knowledge of Russian grammar and develops comprehension and writing skills in response to audio-visual material. Spoken proficiency is developed in small-group oral classes.\n\nIntermediate Russian Language 2: builds on the grammar and syntax taught in Intermediate Russian 1. Alongside audio-visual communication and writing practice, students will translate texts from Russian into English and hone oral skills in small-group classes.\n\nStudents who have an SQA Higher or GCE A-level in Russian will take the following compulsory modules in second year:\n\nAdvanced Intermediate Russian Language 1: builds knowledge of Russian grammar at an advanced intermediate level. Students will develop comprehension and writing skills in response to contemporary audio-visual material. Oral proficiency is developed in small-group classes.\n\nAdvanced Intermediate Russian Language 2: continues to build on the advanced intermediate grammar taught in Advanced Intermediate Russian Language 1 and develops key writing, listening and speaking skills in response to contemporary audio-visual materials.\n\nFor all modules, spoken Russian is practised in small groups with a native speaker.\n\nIf you take Russian at St Andrews in your third and fourth years, you will choose from a variety of advanced options which incorporate literary, historical and cultural studies into language learning.\n\nStudents of all language levels take the same core modules in Russian language, including advanced oral, writing and communication skills.\n\nOptional specialist modules that have been offered in previous years include (but are not limited to):\n\nGender in Russian Literature and Culture\n\nIssues in Russian Cultural Memory\n\nRussian Children’s Literature (1900 – 2015)\n\nRussian Crime Fiction\n\nRussian Modernist Fiction 1900 - 1940\n\nThe City in Soviet and Russian Cinema\n\nThe Nineteenth-Century Russian Novel\n\nTheatre and Performance in Twentieth-Century Russia\n\nUtopia/Dystopia in Russian Literature and Culture\n\nVoices of the Russian Enlightenment.\n\nIn fourth year, students have the option of undertaking a dissertation of up to 10,000 words in length, written in English, on a topic of their choice. This independent project enables you to develop key research skills which are desired by both prospective employers and by graduate schools offering postgraduate degrees.\n\nThe compulsory modules listed here must be taken in order to graduate in this subject. However, most students at St Andrews take additional modules, either in their primary subject or from other subjects they are interested in. For Honours level, students choose from a range of Honours modules, some of which are listed above. A full list of all modules appropriate to the programme for the current academic year can be found in the programme requirements.\n\nTeaching\n\nTeaching format\n\nAssessment\n\nSupport\n\nAll modern language modules involve a combination of lectures, tutorials and practical language classes. Lectures provide information, stimulate thought, and suggest directions for further reading and personal study. Small language tutorials allow you to actively work together with your tutors to practice language skills, give presentations, and discuss texts and issues relevant to the course.\n\nSub-honours Russian modules are delivered through small language classes, with 15 to 30 students in each. Oral classes are generally held in smaller groups of no more than 15 students.\n\nAt Honours level, you will attend smaller language classes (5 to 15 students) and seminars (5 to 12 students).\n\nWhen not attending lectures, tutorials and language classes, you will be expected to continue learning independently through self-study. Typically, this will involve:\n\nworking on individual and group projects\n\nundertaking research in the library\n\npreparing coursework assignments and presentations\n\npreparing for examinations.\n\nAll Russian modules are assessed by a combination of coursework (at least 40%) and end-of-semester examinations.\n\nCoursework includes:\n\nadvanced language exercises\n\ndiscursive essays\n\noral presentations.\n\nExaminations are held at the end of each semester during a dedicated exam diet with revision time provided beforehand. Examinations are either entirely in written format or comprise both written and oral components.\n\nTutors advise you closely on the preparation of written work and give individual assessments of your performance. The Department aims to provide feedback on every assessment within three weeks to help you improve on future assessments.\n\nUndergraduates at the University of St Andrews must achieve at least 7.0 on the St Andrews 20-point grade scale to pass a module. To gain access to Honours-level modules, students must achieve the relevant requisites as specified in the policy on entry to Honours and in the relevant programme requirements. To find out the classification equivalent of points, please see the common reporting scale.\n\nYou will be taught by a research-led teaching team with expertise and knowledge of Russian. Postgraduate research students who have undertaken teacher training may also contribute to the teaching of tutorials under the supervision of the module leader.\n\nYou can find contact information for all Russian staff on the School of Modern Languages website.\n\nThe University’s Student Services team can help students with additional needs resulting from disabilities, long-term medical conditions or learning disabilities.
