        "text": "The importance of studying depictions of artificial intelligence (AI) and its embodiment in popular culture has been demonstrated, notably by the Global AI Narratives (GAIN) project at the University of Cambridge. Examining the different AI narratives is key to understanding expectations and public perceptions of the risks and benefits of this technology as it is increasingly used in various domains. For example, the popular depiction of AI as a Pandora’s Box which, once created, can result in vengeful robots trying to destroy humanity, could encourage people to be more afraid of or skeptical towards applications of AI. As argued by the GAIN team, such perceptions, in turn, could influence the regulation of AI and possibly the emergence of international norms on its development.\n\nAs AI-based technologies have a global impact, it is also important to explore how they are portrayed in the popular imagination of different cultures. However, much of the literature on the depictions of AI in popular culture focuses on Western or English-language films (especially the “Terminator”), television series, and novels. To help broaden our understanding of different perspectives of AI, this article examines some of the narratives and representations of AI in popular culture in the Soviet Union and the Russian Federation.\n\nAs pointed out elsewhere, AI is a relatively recent term. To help get at the full picture about the various narratives it has produced, it is useful to consider different ways in which intelligence is attributed to a machine. As demonstrated in this review, robots and androids are by far the most common depiction of AI in Soviet and Russian culture.\n\nThis article includes some of the most well-known depictions of AI in Russian popular culture measured against the author’s knowledge, resources such as Kinopoisk (the Russian equivalent of IMDB), and literature on Soviet science-fiction cinema. It highlights some of the main themes in how AI has been presented in Russian films, theatre, television, literature, and music. Starting with revolutionary robots, this article then explores five major themes: anthropomorphic depictions of AI, positive depictions of AI, negative depictions of AI, the ‘gendered’ depiction of AI, and depictions of human-AI relationships. It concludes with a series of brief reflections on whether these depictions vary considerably from the ones found in Western popular culture.\n\nRevolutionary robots\n\nThe term “robot” is of Slavic origin and was coined in 1920 by Czech playwright Karel Čapek in his piece “R.U.R. (Rossum’s Universal Robots)”. It comes from the Czech word robota, meaning forced labour or serfdom. In Russian, the word rabota means work.\n\nČapek’s play, where robots revolt against their human creators, made it onto Soviet theatre scenes, while also inspiring adaptations with a political message. Writer Alexey Tolstoy, for instance, composed “The Rise of the Machines” in 1924, describing it as a version of “R.U.R” made for the Russian theatre scene. In Tolstoy’s play, an imperialist producer makes so-called artificial workers on a tropical island in the Pacific Ocean. However, these robots eventually learn about the principles of the communist revolution and decide to rise against the capitalist class.\n\nOne of the first cinematic depictions of robots are found in the movie “Loss of Sensation” (1935), also said to be inspired by “R.U.R”. The film portrays a capitalist country where the bourgeois class wants to replace workers with robots because they are more efficient. When the proletariat revolts, robots are directed by the factory owners to suppress the strike, but one worker ends up cracking the robots’ code and eventually takes over them – an early depiction of hacking. It is also suggested that the movie was based on a novel by Ukrainian writer Volodymyr Vladko, “The Robots Are Coming” (1929), in which robots also engage in class conflict, first on the bourgeoisie side, and then on the workers’ side.\n\nThe robot metaphor is also explored in songs about relationships. In a video clip from 2001, the popular singer Kristina Orbakaite asks a robot to become human again, suggesting that men often become cold-hearted at some point after a few years of marriage or relationship. This is a remake of her mother’s Alla Pugacheva song back from 1965.\n\nFinally, the rock band Leningrad has a song called “Terminator” (2013) in which a man who is left by a woman decides that bones and skulls will become his new emblem and swears not to love again.\n\nConclusions\n\nAs this overview demonstrated, Soviet and Russian popular culture depicts similar views of AI and the human-machine relationship as in the West. Common narratives and types of perceptions (as in Cave, Coughlan and Dihal 2019) include ease (robots doing homework or helping with work tasks), gratification (friendship or romantic relationships with robots), and uprising (robots trying to turn against their creators). There are also examples of anthropomorphic AI, dystopian AI, hypersexualized AI, and romantic AI.\n\nHowever, the narrative of the rise of the machines, except for art glorifying the communist revolution, does not seem as strong in Soviet and Russian popular culture as it does in some Western states. The fact that Soviet cinema features somewhat awkward-behaving and strange depictions of robots is perhaps a message that these creatures would never be able to be fully human, no matter how hard they try. Modern Russian cinema also bypasses a scenario where robots revolt or launch a war against humans. Machines that decide to or are programmed to not follow Asimov’s laws never really succeed.\n\nThese narratives could have an influence on how Russian society interprets the increasing presence AI-based technologies have on their daily lives. The Russian government is keen on integrating more AI-based systems in areas such as health, transport, public services and education. Judging by some public opinion polls, the Russian attitude towards AI can be described as being between positive and neutral.\n\nIn a recent survey, 48% of respondents said they trust AI, with 42% saying that they do not and 10% not knowing what to answer. However, the same survey shows that only 32% of respondents could explain what AI is, with 49% answering they have heard about it but could not define it. Meanwhile, another survey from December 2021 carried out by the Higher School of Economics suggests a shift towards a more distrustful attitude towards the Internet, digitalized public services, and AI being involved in bureaucratic decision-making.\n\nAt the same time, when asked about the prospects of robotization in various surveys, most Russians said they are not afraid that a robot could replace them in their work duties in the foreseeable future, suggesting that they are not worried about the economic challenges brought by further automation (see VTsIOM 2021, FOM 2021, VTsIOM 2019, VTsIOM 2017). Thus, the uprising narrative, although not absent in popular culture, does not seem to resonate among the Russian public as much.\n\nInteractions with robots and androids will continue to be explored in various forms of popular culture as Russian society becomes more digitalized and accustomed with AI-based technologies, especially with the trends accelerated by the Covid-19 pandemic."
