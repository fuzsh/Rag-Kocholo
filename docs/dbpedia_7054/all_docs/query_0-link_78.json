        "meta_description": "Lukashka humiliates his father, Ivan, by refusing to participate in the Cossack preoccupation--killing Turks. The townspeople brand him a coward, and his behavior elicits the disapproval of Maryana, his favorite pastime. The escape of several Turkish prisoners arouses his fighting spirit; he becomes a real warrior and returns from battle proudly displaying a mouth wound (a heroic injury, yielding status). When his pride causes him to be aloof with Maryana, she accepts the marriage proposal of visiting Prince Olenin. Lukashka chases the couple, already on their way to the capital, kidnaps Maryana, and leaves the royal party to a band of marauding Turks.",
