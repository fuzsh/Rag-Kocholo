        "text": "Russian has been designated a critical language by the United States government. Critical languages are those that are considered crucial for national security but are not spoken by enough Americans.\n\nRussia is waging a war against Ukraine. We need more people who study and understand the country, the language, and culture in order to help end the war.\n\nRussia is one of the greatest cyber threats to the United States. The Russia government engages in malicious cyber activities.\n\nRussian language will help you understand and enjoy\n\nRussian literature, which is crucial for understanding Russian society and communicating with its people. Russian literature has a profound effect on the structure of Russian society and it influences the daily lives of ordinary people and of its leaders.\n\nRussian literature engages in political, social, religious, ethical, and moral debates, but also touches on mundane everyday events. It encourages readers to think critically about what makes us human.\n\nRussia is the largest country of the world and has the largest new sources of natural gas and petroleum.\n\nRussia and the United States continue to work together on the International Space Station (ISS).\n\nRussian is the most widespread of the Slavic languages and the largest native language in Europe. Russian is the official language of Russia, and one of the official languages in Belarus, Kyrgyzstan, and Kazakhstan. Russian is also considered an unofficial lingua franca in many former Soviet countries including Georgia, Latvia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan.\n\nOur language courses are designed both for students with no previous knowledge and for those who speak Russian at home (heritage speakers). Students in our language courses can achieve a high level of linguistic competence in speaking, comprehension, reading, and writing.\n\nMany European languages have been languages of oppression. Russia, too, has a long imperialist history of language politics which continued into the Soviet period and remains today. We teach Russian to understand more deeply the past and present cultural, linguistical and political arcs.\n\nLanguage Placement\n\nStudents interested in beginning their study of Russian should enroll in the RUS 1A-1B-1C series, which is offered each year, starting in the Fall only. We offer both online and in person options. Occasionally, heritage speakers may place into first year Russian. If you have some formal instruction in Russian it is possible to place into the Winter or Spring Quarter courses.\n\nStudents ready for the second year Russian (intermediate level), or who come to UC Irvine with a full year's worth of college level Russian language, should enroll in the RUS 2A-2B-2C sequence. Second year will typically include heritage speakers of Russian who may have extensive knowledge of the spoken language, but either little experience with the written language or want to improve their written language.\n\nThere is an exemption exam at the UCI Academic Testing Center for UCI students. Please contact the Center testcenter@uci.edu or 949-824-6207 to request an exam.\n\nQuestions about placement should be addressed to Dr. Lora Mjolsness at lora@uci.edu.\n\nLower division Russian culture courses taught in English discuss the rich cultural tradition of world-renowned art, literature, film, and music, but also strive to teach diverse perspectives and expose inherent imperialist currents. Upper division courses, also taught in English, focus more in depth on one author, time period or movement.\n\nRussia literature captures everyday real life while also striving to define national identity. As instructors, we are also committed to teaching Russian literature in its historical context while also acknowledging its mechanisms of patriarchy, patriarchy, expansionism, and imperialism. At the same time, we also examine how Russian literature also grapples with the fundamentals of universal truths, experiences, and qualities that transcend politics, which makes it part of world culture.\n\nStudents who are able to do the reading in Russian are encouraged to do so, and the Russian texts can be used in final papers. Please contact your instructor if you plan to do this.\n\nHere are some of the lower division courses frequently taught at UC Irvine.\n\nRussian Dissent\n\nRussian Travel\n\nSoviet Animation\n\nRussian and East European Folklore\n\nRussian Demons\n\nEastern European Utopian Worlds\n\nHere are some of the upper division courses frequently taught at UC Irvine.\n\nDostoevsky\n\n19th Century Russian Literature\n\n20th Century Russian Literature\n\nChekhov\n\n20th Century Soviet Cinema\n\nThe European Language and Studies Department and the Russian Program encourage our students to study abroad. UC Educational Abroad Program (UCEAP) does not currently have a program in the Russian language.\n\nThe U.S. government wants Americans to study and to master critical and strategic foreign languages, like Russian. Students of diverse disciplines and majors are encouraged to apply.Critical Language Scholarships provide fully funded intensive language instruction for U.S. citizens. https://clscholarship.org/\n\nIn addition, students can choose to study abroad in Russian speaking countries, for example, in Georgia, Armenia, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, and Uzbekistan.\n\nJob and Educational Opportunities\n\n**Please note that all students must be U.S. citizens and able to obtain a Top Secret security clearance.\n\nSummer Language Program Internship: Spend 12 weeks this summer working as a language analyst at NSA. The summer 2024 program is hiring students with proficiency in Chinese, Russian, and Farsi, but other languages are considered on a case-by-case basis.
