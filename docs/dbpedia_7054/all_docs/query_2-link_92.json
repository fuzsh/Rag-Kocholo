        "text": "“By integrating short film into the language learning experience, this textbook not only enhances comprehension and cultural understanding, but makes learning Russian both enjoyable and effective. A great resource for both teachers and students!”\n\nNina Shkolnik, Lecturer of Russian, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, USA\n\n“The textbook Learn Russian through Contemporary Short Film perfectly combines a traditional approach to Russian language teaching and learning with the possibilities brought about through with new technologies. The decision to use short films as a starting point for organizing didactic materials could not be better: for contemporary students the world of ‘moving images’ is the most natural environment, thereby this medium seems to be the most involving and convincing for them. Despite the innovative approach, the Author successfully managed to include exercises for all language skills practised in conventional language teaching, both reproductive and productive. The book’s vocabulary – up-to-date and stylistically diverse – deserves special recognition”.\n\nDorota Drużyłowska, Adjunct Professor of Russian, University of Wroclaw, Poland\n\n\"A cutting-edge contribution to the field of Russian language pedagogy, this innovative textbook seamlessly integrates language learning with cultural immersion, offering learners a uniquely stimulating and dynamic pathway to fluency. The modular flexibility targets all language skills with engaging activities, making this book an invaluable resource for both classroom use and independent study, as well as an exciting opportunity for learners to discover Russian and Kazakh contemporary cinema!\n\nMikhail Vodopyanov, Associate Lecturer in Russian, University of St Andrews, UK\n\n\"Compiled and written with compelling knowledge, this textbook offers excellent modern Russian short films selection where live and topical themes are presented in engaging and thought-provoking ways. This textbook is an outstanding resource for language skills teaching in the context of modern life. Various exercises, guiding questions, linguistic and grammar materials encourage students not only to discuss films in Russian but also to develop better and deeper understanding of Russian society, arts and culture. This textbook is a rewarding blend of different aspects of language teaching and showing of contemporary reality \".\n\nLudmila Snigireva, Russian Development Officer, Teacher of Russian and Cultural Awareness, Marino Institute of Education, Dublin, Ireland\n\n“Ignite your passion for the Russian language with Learn Russian through Contemporary Short Films. This valuable tool not only provides a dynamic path to mastering Russian but also immerses learners in the diverse hues of its daily modern life and culture. Twelve versatile and engaging modules could be tailored to various teaching styles and goals, creating a comprehensive journey for language enthusiasts and educators alike”."
