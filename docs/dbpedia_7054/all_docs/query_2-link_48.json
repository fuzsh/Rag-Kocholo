They may do so by making a formal request to the department which includes a rationale for the proposed substitution.\n\nSuggested curricular flow through the major\n\nThe Russian major was designed with the hope that all of our students would spend time abroad on the Dickinson in Tbilisi, Georgia program. As a result, we developed the curriculum so that a student who studies abroad can complete all the requirements for the major, as long as they follow a few guidelines. The Russian major is also designed to accommodate students with double majors.\n\nRather than specify courses that you “must” have in a given semester, we have provided some general guidelines. You should think of these guidelines as giving you a fast track into the major – providing maximum flexibility in your junior and senior year.\n\nFirst Year\n\nRUSS 101 (fall semester); RUSS 102 (spring semester)\n\nRUSS 100, Russia and the West (spring semester)\n\nSophomore Year\n\nRUSS 201 (fall semester); RUSS 202 (spring semester)\n\nRussian literature or culture course in English (200-level course)\n\nRUSS electives, for example, a Russian history course\n\nJunior Year\n\nThe majority of Russian majors study in Tbilisi, Georgia during their Junior Year; In Tbilisi you will take 4-9 courses per semester (refer to the Courses section in the Academic Bulletin: Russian)\n\nIf you do not go abroad, take:\n\nRUSS 231 (fall semester); RUSS 232 (spring semester)\n\nRussian literature or culture course in English (200-level course)\n\nRUSS elective, for example, a Russian history course\n\nSenior Year\n\n300-level RUSS course (fall semester); 300-level RUSS course (spring semester)\n\nFinish your requirements for Russian literature/culture and your electives\n\nFor information regarding these guidelines, please feel free to contact a Russian faculty member. Consult your advisor regarding writing an honors thesis in Russian.\n\nIndependent study and independent research\n\nIndependent study projects are an option open to motivated students who wish to pursue a topic in Russian or Slavic literatures and cultures not offered as part of the regular curriculum. Interested students must be willing to initiate their own study project and meet with their director on a weekly basis. Most projects are taken for half or full course credit.\n\nHonors\n\nA student who wishes to be considered for honors in the major must have an overall grade point average of 3.33 or higher. Each candidate for honors must write a thesis of exceptional merit; the thesis should be based on Russian-language research and should be written at least partially in Russian. The thesis will be approximately 25 pages in length and is usually developed from research conducted abroad and/or written during the senior year in a course numbered 300 or above. Students should reach out to a faculty member in the fall of their senior year to discuss the process. An oral examination will be conducted by members of the Russian department on those papers judged to be of honors quality.\n\nOpportunities for off-campus study\n\nJunior Year All students majoring or minoring in Russian are encouraged to spend one or two semesters on the Russian-language program in Tbilisi, Georgia during the junior year. Students will undergo intensive language training while also having the opportunity to take courses in Identity Studies and Conflict Studies by experts from the region. As part of their introduction to life in Tbilisi, all students will take a course in Georgian Language for Conversation. Russian-language internship opportunities are also available for motivated students.\n\nSummer Immersion Opportunities Summer immersion opportunities are available in Russian language through our partner prorams in Armenia, Georgia, Kyrgyzstan, and Latvia, and a Ukrainian language workshop in Poland.\n\nCo-curricular activities/programs\n\nThe college has an active Russian Club, a Russian House, and a Russian Meal Table, held weekly for students who want to speak or listen to Russian in an informal setting. Russian-language films and cultural events are featured regularly, as well as events featuring cultures of Eastern Europe, the Caucasus, and Central Asia. The Russian Department is a member of Dobro Slovo, the National Slavic Honor Society. Students are nominated for membership on the basis of their academic standing.\n\nCourses\n\nThe following courses are offered in Tbilisi, Georgia:\n\n281 Russian Language in Context\n\nThis course of Russian as a Second Language (RSL) builds on student’s existing foundation in Russian and is designed to help them become more effective in all aspects of communication, including introducing increasingly complex structures and significantly increasing their active vocabulary. The course will also focus on achieving cultural literacy through the study of Russian-language texts (classic and contemporary), films and other media, as well as engaging with local cultural events, traditions, and the daily surrounding environment of Tbilisi. The communicative approach to teaching creates an interactive environment and requires a high level of participation from students. Students will be split into groups based on proficiency level and may take this course multiple times at various levels, as their proficiency develops.\n\nMay be offered as a full or half credit.\n\n282 Russian Conversation in Context\n\nThis course is aimed at developing students’ skills and proficiency in the conversational and interactive aspects of the Russian language. Students will learn vocabulary and grammatical constructions as well as typical phrases to use in different communicative situations of everyday life. Students will be able to solve various communicative tasks in real-life situations. Special attention will be given to mastering typical linguistic constructions for greetings, expressing gratitude, making requests, extending invitations, offering assistance, giving consent, refusing, discussing time and place, giving reasons, and more. As a result, students will learn to speak and understand their interlocutor, maintain a conversation, and feel more confident in everyday situations in a Russian-speaking environment. Students will be split into groups based on proficiency level and may take this course multiple times at various levels, as their proficiency develops.\n\nMay be offered as a full or half credit.\n\n283 Advanced Conversation and Stylistics\n\nThis course is designed to help students develop and improve speaking and listening skills, as well as the ability to engage in meaningful discussions, articulate personal points of view, and defend positions effectively in Russian. Special emphasis will be placed on presentation skills in Russian, as well as practicing the art of answering questions, engaging in dialogues, and participating in discussion. Throughout the course, students will engage in discussions on a wide range of topics. These include topics related to society, science, literature, art, economics, politics, ecology, as well as devoted to exploring countries and their histories, allowing students to make comparisons with other regions and express their opinions. Students will be split into groups based on proficiency level and may take this course multiple times at various levels, as their proficiency develops.\n\nMay be offered as a full or half credit.\n\n284 Identity and Conflict in the Caucasus\n\nThe Caucasus is a region noted for its ethnic, religious and cultural diversity. The North Caucasus, which can be described almost as a mosaic of the peoples, stands out in particular. Such diversity within the population makes the Caucasus attractive and interesting. At the same time, there is a constant threat of conflict and misunderstanding between cultural groups in the region. This is proved by history, which was often marked by bloody conflicts in the Caucasus. Diversity expressed through confrontation puts identity issues and the theoretical and conceptual perspectives of nationality formation at the core of our studies, and from this basis it is possible to analyze the complex, multifaceted, and contradictory processes that have evolved in the Caucasus region. The theoretical models adopted in identity, nationalism and memory studies will provide an opportunity to understand the dynamics and casualties of developments in the region.\n\nAttributes: Russian Poli Sci Elective\n\nThe following courses are offered in Moscow:\n\nProgram suspended until further notice\n\n215 Moscow Summer Immersion Program\n\nA four-week course in contemporary Russian language and culture offered at the Mendeleev University in Moscow.

No prior knowledge of Russian culture required.\n\nAttributes: Arts, Film & Media Studies Elective, Taught in English\n\n242 War and Peace in Russian Literature and Film\n\nThe topic of war serves as a window into Russian and Soviet culture. War’s horrors—from Napoleon’s invasion of 1812 to the debacle in Afghanistan in the 1970s and 1980s—have left a deep imprint on the Russian national psyche. This course approaches the Russian experience of war through films, short stories, diaries, and poetry. Special focus is placed on representations of the Second World War, resulting in 26 million Russian casualties.

No knowledge of Russian is required.\n\nConducted in English. Offered every other year.\n\nAttributes: Arts, INST Russia/USSR/Post-Soviet\n\n244 The Russian Novel\n\nRussian literature is known for its novels. More specifically, Russian literature is known for its long, unwieldy, philosophical novels: structurally and existentially dense works in the thousands of pages, which Henry James described as “large, loose, baggy monsters.” And yet, 19th century Russian novels by Pushkin, Dostoevsky, Gogol, and Tolstoy regularly appear on lists of the “best literary works of all times.” In this course, we will delve into a selection of Russian novels that have shaped both Russian culture and world literature. We will ask questions like: Where does the Russian novelistic tradition come from, how does it differ from other European longform traditions, and what exactly is a novel anyway? We will consider why the “philosophical novel” has become synonymous with Russian writing, trace the development of the novel over the course of the 19th century, and examine the ways the novel might be especially well suited to reflect the complexity of human conscious experience. No knowledge of Russian required. br> Taught in English. Offered every three years.\n\nAttributes: Humanities, Russian 19th Century Elective, Taught in English\n\n245 Tolstoy in the 21st Century\n\nThis course investigates the numerous ways in which Tolstoy, one of the most influential Russian writers and thinkers, transcends his time and through his works speaks to our concerns today. What makes life meaningful? What kind of love lasts? Why do certain attempts to modernize society fail while others succeed? It is worth reconsidering Tolstoy's ideas on these and other issues because he teaches us to see the world more wisely. Students will read and discuss Tolstoy's fiction, including War and Peace and Anna Karenina, as well as his essays on religious, philosophical, social and artistic issues. Students are encouraged to have read War and Peace before the semester begins.\n\nTaught in English. Offered every two years.\n\nAttributes: Humanities, Taught in English\n\n248 Russian Culture and the Environment\n\nRussia is the largest country in the world. It contains some of our largest supplies of natural resources, including the most voluminous freshwater lake and the most square miles of forest. Russia and the Soviet Union have also been home to devastating environmental catastrophes, such as the Chernobyl nuclear disaster. It is thus fitting that the theme of the environment—both natural and man-made—have played a pivotal role in the Russian cultural imagination of the past two centuries. This course will look at how Russian and Soviet culture from the nineteenth century to the present engage with the theme of the environment over a variety of genres, including literature, film, journalism, and art. No knowledge of Russian is required.\n\nTaught in English. Offered every three years.\n\nAttributes: ENST Humanities/Arts (ESHA), Humanities, INST Sustain & Global Environ, Taught in English\n\n253 Autocracy, Uprisings, and Daily Life in Medieval Ukraine, Russia, and its Empire\n\nThis course will survey the first 1000 years of the eastern Slav lands that are now Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus and the expanding empire of the former into Central Asia and the Caucasus. Students will gain a better understanding of the region’s political, economic, social, and cultural development and how it can inform our understanding of Russia today. We will examine the early formation of multi-ethnic clans into a large multinational empire while highlighting state formation, the role of women, church power, the arts, and nationality conflict. The course concludes with the impending collapse of the Russian empire under Tsar Nicholas II.\n\nThis course is cross-listed as HIST 253.\n\nAttributes: Appropriate for First-Year, INST Russia/USSR/Post-Soviet, Social Sciences, Taught in English\n\n254 Revolution, War, and Daily Life in Modern Russia\n\nThis course explores Russia's attempts to forge modernity since the late 19th century.

Offered every other year.\n\nAttributes: Taught in English\n\n270 Philosophy and Literature\n\nDostoevsky's characters lie, steal, scheme, and murder. What is it about Dostoevsky's depictions of their lying, cheating ways that makes his novels not just literary but philosophical? And what is it about philosophical works like Kierkegaard's and Nietzsche's that makes them literary? More generally, where do the overlapping realms of literature and philosophy begin and end? This course investigates the intersections of philosophy and literature across different schools of thought, paying special attention to the work of Dostoevsky, Kierkegaard, Leibniz, Plato, Tolstoy, Voltaire, and others. We will pair the treatment of philosophical issues in fiction with their treatment in more traditional philosophical genres, thereby raising and discussing the contentious question of whether philosophy can achieve things that literature cannot, and vice versa.\n\nOffered every two years. This course is cross-listed as PHIL 270.\n\nAttributes: Humanities, Taught in English\n\n333 Advanced Seminar in Russian Culture and Literature\n\nAuthentic Russian texts in different genres and disciplines present specific sets of challenges, including specialized vocabulary, narrative conventions, and idiosyncratic grammar.
