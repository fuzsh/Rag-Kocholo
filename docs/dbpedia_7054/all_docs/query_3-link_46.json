        "text": "Hopak dance is one of the most visually recognizable symbols of Ukraine—either as a Soviet republic or an independent country. Men in bright colored sharovary pants performing virtuosic jumps in squatting position or effortless high leaps to stylized folk tunes is one of the most popular moving images that represent Ukrainian culture. During from the 1950s until recently, the hopak in Ukraine was performed almost exclusively as a stage dance art (unlike in diasporas where it has over time has taken on traits of social dance and event), connected with state celebrations.\n\nStarting in 1985, a new kind of hopak has been formed and implemented in Ukraine—military hopak. Its tradition is claimed to descend from the martial art of Zaporizhian Kossaks, which was lost during Soviet times and later rediscovered and renewed as specifically a Ukrainian martial art. It gained lots of publicity, fans, and practitioners in the 2000s, and it seemed that military hopak strived to replace the old, representational stage dance version of its practice, which emphasized playfulness and light-hearted character of Ukrainian folk. Hopak as a martial art refers to the heroic past of Ukraine, its identity, and uniqueness."
