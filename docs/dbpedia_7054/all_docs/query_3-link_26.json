The game mixes contemporary and modern names when designating factions. The differences are detailed in the Behind the scenes section.\n\nThe \"Days of Brilliance\" DLC (release 13.12.16) added the Netherlands and Denmark as playable nations.\n\nIn \"Cossacks 3: Rise to Glory\" (release 15.02.17) Bavaria and Saxony were added as playable nations.\n\nIn \"Cossacks 3: Path to Grandeur\" (release 16.06.17) Hungary and Portugal were added as playable nations.\n\nIn \"Cossacks 3: The Golden Age\" (release 24.08.17) Piedmont and Switzerland were added as playable nations.\n\nList of nations[ | ]\n\nAlgeria\n\nAustria\n\nBavaria (*DLC RtG)\n\nDenmark (*DLC DoB)\n\nEngland\n\n17th century pikeman with armour against bullets\n\nstrong cuirasser cavalry\n\ncheap 18th century Highlander musketeer: high damage and HP, slower training\n\n18th century musketeer\n\n18th century balloon to reveal the map\n\nStables are built faster, require less wood and stone, but more gold.\n\nCosts more resources to upgrade to the 18th century.\n\nFrance\n\nHungary (*DLC PtG)\n\nNetherlands (*DLC DoB)\n\nPiedmont (*DLC tGA)\n\nPoland\n\nPortugal (*DLC PtG)\n\nPrussia\n\nRussia\n\nSaxony (*DLC RtG)\n\nSpain\n\nSweden\n\nSwitzerland (*DLC tGA)\n\nTurkey\n\nUkraine\n\nVenice\n\nScotland (*DLC GotH).\n\nLuxembourg\n\nBehind the scenes[ | ]\n\nThe game uses a number of anachronistic or blatantly erroneous names in naming nations, likely to make it more accessible.\n\nEngland is actually the Kingdom of England and Wales, and then the United Kingdom once the transition to the 18th century is made, and use Scottish highlanders as units in game.\n\nPoland wasn't a distinct, sovereign entity in the game's time period, but a constituent state of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.\n\nTurkey didn't exist at all, what existed was the Ottoman Empire. (This is false. Ottoman Empire was commonly referred as Turkey and/or Turkish Empire)(Ottoman Empire and Turkey are different)\n\nUkraine is a Cossack military state that emerged in the territories that constitute Ukraine proper.\n\nPiedmont is just a principality of the duchy of Savoy, a country which existed from 1004 to 1860, and represent central Italy in game.\n\n[ | ]\n\nA summary of each nation's bonuses"
