To be a \"critical thinker,\" one must develop the habit and discipline of asking questions and challenging assumptions. Through a comparative approach to the US and Russian experiences, we will explore the role of language and its power in different political and social systems. We will explore such questions as: Why is free speech so fiercely defended in a democracy and such a threat to totalitarianism? What is the relationship between free speech, political power and dissent? Is the pen still mightier than the sword, even in the nuclear age? What has shaped our current attitudes toward freedom of expression? How has the concept of political free speech been extended to include freedom of expression in general, such as in the creative arts? What role do new technologies play in the arena of free speech debates? We will explore how freedom of speech and expression has been defended or its suppression justified in the US and Russia. We will practice the art of questioning and constructing counter-arguments throughout the course.\n\nCredit Only Granted for: RUSS287 or RUSS289I.\n\nFormerly: RUSS289I.\n\nAdditional Information: Taught in English.\n\nRUSS298 Special Topics in Russian Language and Literature (3 Credits)\n\nRepeatable to: 6 credits if content differs.\n\nRUSS301 Advanced Russian I (3 Credits)\n\nAdvanced training in written Russian communicative structures.\n\nPrerequisite: RUSS202; or students who have taken courses with comparable content may contact the department.\n\nRestriction: Must not be a native/fluent speaker of Russian.\n\nRUSS302 Advanced Russian II (3 Credits)\n\nAdvanced training in written Russian communicative structures.\n\nPrerequisite: RUSS301.\n\nRUSS303 Russian Conversation: Functional Skills (3 Credits)\n\nIntended for students who do not anticipate having the opportunity to study in Russia.
