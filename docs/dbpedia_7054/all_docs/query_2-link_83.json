All courses feature small classes using materials designed specifically for MSU students. All students are encouraged to spend time studying in Russia or a Russian-speaking country.\n\nThis program is for students looking to travel to a Russian-speaking country and improve their language skills. It is offered in the summer in Daugavpils, a Russian-speaking city in Latvia. Students will attend classes and study intensive Russian for six weeks while living with host families."
