        "text": "He defeated the invading Swedes, earning his honorific Nevsky, on the frozen river Neva a few years before defeating the crusading knights on frozen Lake Peipus. To prove that nothing is as simple as it may appear, Alexander decided it was better to switch than fight when the Mongols came along, and collaborated with them til the end of his days. Speaking of collaboration, a brilliant foursome is responsible for this film… Eisenstein as director; his partner, Sergei Prokofiev, whose score for Nevsky is probably the best \"movie music\" ever composed; Edward Tisse, Eisenstein’s long-time collaborator as cinematographer; and Nikolai Cherkasov in the title role as Alexander. Cherkasov would later appear also in Eisenstein’s Ivan the Terrible films, but in those he's an overwrought, evil oil slick. Here he is, I think, unforgettably heroic. The film was intended to stir patriotism in the run-up to the expected confrontation with the Nazis, but when the Hitler-Stalin non-aggression pact came along in August 1939, the film had to stay in the cans. It was, of course, given a quick national re-release after the June 1941 invasion. I’ve seen the film countless times, having screened it often for both Russian history and Soviet cinema classes, but my closest encounter with an element of the genius underlying this collaborative masterwork was being present in April 1991 for a performance of the Prokofiev cantata conducted by Mstislav Rostropovich, Prokofiev’s one-time protégé. Rostropovich’s love for the composer was palpable as he called forth the best the National Symphony Orchestra had in an unforgettable tribute marking Prokofiev’s hundredth birthday, as well as the fiftieth anniversary of the fateful Operation Barbarossa. Watch it, suspend some disbelief for this 1930s warhorse, and I genuinely believe you'll like it. Among those who went to school on Eisenstein’s first sound film, by the way, was Laurence Olivier, whose 1945 Henry the Fifth owes much to Nevsky.\n\n* Andrei Rublev, 1966, directed by Andrei Tarkovsky. The film, based on the life of the medieval Russian icon painter, was only shown in Russia, in a much abridged format, in 1972; that was three years after winning the International Critics Prize at the Cannes Film Festival. Soviet censors edited the film, removing up to an hour from the original. Reading the plot description at imdb will certainly help you understand the movie. You can also read the notes by Alan Kimball, University of Oregon, A Guide to Fifty Minutes Worth of \"Andrei Rublev\".\n\nCTE: Far from being a masterpiece, in my opinion, the movie can be long, disjointed and completely non-understandable. There are some good scenes about the depravities of medieval Russian life and the impact that the Mongols (Tatars) had on the Russian people: suddenly the Mongols appear; there is terror and destruction; and then they are gone. You get very little sense of the intellectual and spiritual motivations of Rublev, which is perhaps understandable given the lack of surviving historical sources about him. We've got one of those color switches (Remember the Wizard of Oz) when the final section of the movie shifts to a color montage of some of Rublev's surviving icons, but that gives only a hint of what was so powerful about his work.\n\n* Anna Karenina, 1967, directed by Alexander Zarkhi.\n\nCTE: There have been numerous attempts to make a movie based on Tolstoy's novel; most are not very successful. My suggestion is \"Read the book.\" This particular film does follow the novel rather closely, with soe nice costuming, but, of course, so much had to be left out of the movie. The film tends to highlight the weaknesses, immorality, depravity, /etc. of the characters, which fit with Societ society in the mid-1960s, but that was not quite Tolstoy's entire intention in his novel. \"Read the book\" and then maybe watch the movie.\n\n* Ballada o Soldate (Ballad of a Soldier), 1960, directed by Grigorii Chukhrai. Make sure you see the sub-titled print and not the dubbed version.\n\nCTE: Filmed in 1959, only 14 years after World War II had ended and in the midst of the Thaw, sweeping the Soviet Union, the movie is unbelievably corny in places. The cinematography is nothing special, black and white, but if you don't cry when Alyosha finally reaches his mother while on leave from the front, then you have no heart! So, it is worth watching.\n\nBB: This was the first Soviet film I ever saw. I was an undergraduate student taking first-semester intro course in Russian language and this film was used as a \"text\" by my instructor. That is, we watched the film several times and also used the film's audio track in language lab exercises. This made me tire of it, and when I first taught a course in \"Soviet Cinema,\" I omitted Chukhrai's film. In a later version of the course, I screened Ballad of a Soldier, and think it will always be an affecting film for traditional-age undergraduates because Alyosha and Shura are themselves both about 20. Now that I'm much older even than the mother character, I am still much affected by the film's pathos. It's been called \"socialist realism with a human face,\" and I think this is an accurate summation.\n\nBoris Godunov. There are many versions available of this opera. I watched the 1978 version of Modest Mussorgsky's opera, Boris Godunov. This is generally considered the greatest of all Russian operas, and let me warn you that operas can be long and slow-moving, and this is no exception. But what makes this opera a bit unique is that the title role must be song by a bass, not a tenor or baritone! So, the opera that I watched was filmed live at Moscow's Bolshoi Theatre in 1978 and featured the renowned Russian bass Evgenii Nesterenko in the title role. Ok, it is a bit long, and at places Nesterenko seems to be lacking any real pathos, but at the very least watch the magnificent coronation scene. There is also available a 1954 version of the opera, also filmed at the Bolshoi, that stars Aleksandr Pirogov. Finally, there is a 1986 dramatic version based on Aleksandr Pushkin’s story. This version is directed by Sergei Bondarchuk with Bondarchuk also playing the lead role as Godunov. The drama has received much praise for its outstanding photography and production design. So, enjoy this most Russian of Russian historical tales in whichever version you choose.\n\nBrat (Brother), 1997, directed by Aleksei Balabanov. The movie deals with the seamy underside of life in St. Petersburg after the collapse of the soviet world. A brother moves to the citt to be with his brother, who is already an underworld hit man, but it is the younger brother, new to the city, who really thrives as an assasin dealing with the drugs, crime and music of the city. One is left wondering if the criminal is the victim or the hero. Pretty violent, although not near as violent as a Hollywood film would have been dealing with the same subject.\n\nScreen shot from Battleship Potemkin\n\n* Bronenosets Potemkin (Battleship Potemkin), 1925, directed by Sergei Eisenstein. The film depicts the mutiny of sailors aboard the Battleship Potemkin during the 1905 Russian Revolution. The original mutiny took place 14-25 June 1905. Sailors protested the quality of the meat being served them, but an official doctor said that it was ok for human consumption. When the sailor leading the delegation to the officers was killed , a mutiny ensued, and the senior officers on the ship were killed. The ship arrived at Odesa on the 15th hoping to arrouse the support of workers for the mutiny. City authorities did allow the burial of the dead sailor but would not grant an amnesty to the mutineers. The ships guns then briefly bombarded the city. Eventually, the sailors ended up in Romania where they were given safe passage to Western Europe.\n\nCTE: The film was originally commissioned by the Soviet government to commemorate the 1905 Revolution. Eisenstein then chose to focus on the mutiny of the sailors on the Battleship Potemkin in Odesa. The sailors had revolted because of their absolutely horrible service conditions (including rancid meat) and the unrest in Russian in 1905 as a result of the Russo-Japanese war. Although the recreation of the historical details of the incident leaves much to be desired, the film is still an Eisenstein triumph with his \"rhythmic editing\" technique and the famous Odesa Steps scene in which the Cossacks gun down rioters and innocent bystanders. The actors in the film were amateurs, selected by Eisenstein because of their \"rightness\" for the roles. Remember this film was shot in 1925, a relatively good year for the Bolshevik Regime, and reflects the Bolshevik view of the world at that time.\n\nRobert Brown, Assistant Professor of Film, Loudoun Campus: Even though Potemkin appears to have lost some of its luster among film critics as being one of the finest films ever made, the film is still considered quite powerful due to the intensity served to viewers by director Sergei Eisenstein in the scene known as the \"Odesa Steps Sequence.\" If D.W. Griffith, in Birth of a Nation was able to transform film into an art form with the \"shot,\" then Eisenstein, in the \"Odesa Step Sequence\" made the emerging art form more malleable of space and time using the technique of montage editing. The sequence, even by today's standards of editing, is majestic, and at the same time, horrific, due to the mixture of images and the expansion of time and rhythm parlayed by Eisenstein. While it seems in most modern-day films editing is used to collapse time in order to make the drama presented more intense (see any \"Action\" film of today), Eisenstein in does the opposite. And in so doing, presents to us what seems a kind of surreal time frame of expansion that prolongs the drama on film and makes us not only see but feel with horrific intensity.\n\nBB: Eisenstein’s Potemkin (pronounced Po-tchom-kin) remains a cinematic touchstone. It’s a staple of \"ten best\" movie lists, including the one done every ten years (beginning in 1952) by Sight and Sound (the 2002 list had it at #7). Critics always acknowledge Eisenstein’s brilliant montage editing (\"Art is conflict,\" he wrote in Film Form, and he was always striving for a \"dialectical\" clash of images.) but often find this film \"unlikable\" (Pauline Kael). In the still breath-taking \"Odesa Steps\" sequence, there are 112 cuts flying past in no more than about 60 seconds.\n\nAnother Screen shot from Battleship Potemkin\n\n(a woman who has just been sabred by a cossack)"
