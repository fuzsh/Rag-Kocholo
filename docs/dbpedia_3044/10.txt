Description

The Civil War diaries of Ephraim Miner of the 142nd Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry and the 22nd Veterans Reserve Corps are set against a sweeping backdrop of injury, remorse and redemption, from the rural mountain farms of Somerset County, Pennsylvania, and the Union breakthrough at the Battle of Fredericksburg, to the hospitals, railroads, arsenals and convalescent camps of the federal war effort, and then back again in peacetime to his beloved mountains.
