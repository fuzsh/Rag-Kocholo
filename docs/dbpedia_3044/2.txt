The 172nd Pennsylvania Infantry was an infantry regiment in the Union Army during the American Civil War.

Formation[]

When Pennsylvania did not meet President Lincoln's August 1862 request for 300,000 nine-month volunteers, the Commonwealth drafted (under the Federal Militia Act of 1862[1]) fifteen regiments between mid-October and early December 1862, totaling 15,000 men. All fifteen regiments were mustered out of service by mid-August 1863. Few saw any combat action.[2]

The 172nd Pennsylvania Infantry was organized at Harrisburg, Pennsylvania (Camp Curtin). The regiment’s soldiers were selected principally from Snyder and Northumberland Counties, with detachments from Clearfield, Elk, McKean, Union, Montour, and Butler Counties.[3] In all, 1,332 men were mustered into the regiment.[4]

By company, most soldiers hailed from the following counties:

Company A: Snyder, Northumberland, and Union

Company B: Northumberland

Company C: Snyder, Elk, Union, and Northumberland

Company D: Northumberland

Company E: York and Elk

Company F: Clearfield, Montour, and Union

Company G: Snyder and Union

Company H: Northumberland, Montour, and Elk

Company I: Snyder

Company K: Northumberland[5]

Service[]

The regiment mustered in for nine months service between October 27 and November 29, 1862, under the command of Colonel Charles Kleckner.[6]

The regiment was assigned to larger formations as follows:

Garrison duty at Yorktown, Va. assigned to IV Corps, Department of Virginia, to April 1863

Advance Brigade (West), IV Corps, Dept. of Virginia, to June 1863

3rd Brigade (Kleckner), 1st Division, IV Corps, to July 1863

1st Brigade (Tyndale), 3rd Division, XI Corps, Army of the Potomac, to August 1863.[7]

On the day after their arrival at Yorktown in December 1862 with three other drafted regiments from Pennsylvania, Maj. Gen. Erasmus D. Keyes, IV Corps commander, wrote that he found the regiments to be “perfectly green” and that “none of them are in a condition to meet the enemy.” Thus he assigned the 172nd to the heavy guns at Yorktown and until April 1863 they remained unassigned to any brigade.[8]

In June 1863, the men of the 172nd offered to re-enlist for six months at the end of their term of service. The War Department originally intended to accept their offer but upon learning that it was contingent upon serving in the Department of the Susquehanna in Pennsylvania, declined, and the regiment mustered out as scheduled on August 1, 1863.[3][9]
