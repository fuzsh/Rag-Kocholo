Preface Andrew was born May 15, 1935 in Altoona, Pennsylvania. He served twice in the Union Army from that state. From his military records at the time of his first enlistment (July 7, 1863) list his civilian occupation as cooper (barrel maker). His height was five feet five inches (other parts of the records say five feet nine inches). He had blue eyes, black hair and a fair complexion. He served with the 46th Pennsylvania Volunteers and was discharged August 18th 1863. He reenlisted with the rank of corporal with his brother William on March 9th 1864. They were both assigned to ï¿½Dï¿½ Company of the 184th Regiment Pennsylvania, Infantry. Andrew was discharged near Washington, D.C. on July 11th, 1865

He returned home to Pennsylvania and shortly after, left and went to Iowa. (Many of the veterans left the impoverished war-torn east and headed west. Why Andrew settled in Iowa is not known.). Within a few months, Andrew met, courted, and married Mary Agnes Miller of Millersburg, Iowa on the 29th of November 1866. The ceremony was performed by Father Sullivan in Marenga, Iowa County, Iowa. Old Man's Creek is also mentioned in the records as the place of marriage.

Andrew and Mary Agnes had seven children:

Charles N. (b. August 26,1868)

Clara (b. December 21, 1869)

George A. (b. February 10, 1879 ï¿½ My grandpa Walker)

A.C. (b. November 22, 1871)

F.A.. (b. April 16, 1878)

S.A. (b. January 2, 1882)

Alice (b. January 16, 1887)

Records show that Andrew and family moved to Persia, Iowa in 1881. (There is no information as to where he lived in Iowa from 1865 until 1881. In 1898 he moved to Portsmouth. I presume that he owned or rented a farm around Persia for 17 years.)

Andrew had a disability pension up to the time of his death, August 20, 1908. The records state that his suffered with eye problems, piles, and indigestion. These ailments were contracted at Cold Harbor, Virginia, beginning around December 11, 1864.

William Walker (1842-1864)

Andrew's brother William was born in Blair County, Pennsylvania (probably Altoona) in 1842.

His military records state that he was 22 at the time of his three-year enlistment which began March9, 1864. His occupation was the same as Andrew's; cooper or shuck maker (barrel-maker). He had hazel eyes, black hair, dark complexion and was five feet six inches tall.

He was mustered into service as a Private on the 12th of May, 1864 at Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. He was assigned to the 184th Pennsylvania Infantry. A little over a month later on June 16th he was killed at Petersburg, Virginia.

June 16, 1864 was the start of the siege of Petersburg. It did not end until April2, 1865. Seven days before the end of the war.. This would not have been William's first encounter under fire. He and Andrew had been involved in the fighting at Cold Harbor from June 1 to June 12, 1864.

Comments of the Transcriber (Jim Walker ï¿½ Redondo Beach, Calif.)

I did the original transcription in December of 1976. In May of 2002, I retyped the diary and added a lot of research material and photographs. However, this is a redacted copy without the additional materials and photos.

Using a magnifying glass and under strong light, I spent many hours transcribing the entries in the diary. The small hardcover book measures approximately 2 by 4 inches and has about 50 lined pages. It is in very fragile condition and the ink has faded. I have it sealed in plastic and do not expose it to strong light

In the transcription of this material, I made numerous corrections in spelling. Great grandpa probably had a minimal elementary education. He spelled many words the way they sounded to him.

The only punctuation changes made were the substitution of periods for ï¿½andï¿½. All grammatical patterns and incorrect verb tense forms are intact.

Lined spaces in the text are for words that I could not decipher. Question marks in parentheses after a word indicate doubt as to the spelling or meaning of a word.
