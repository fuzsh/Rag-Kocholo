Tuttle of the “Hibriten Guards” of Company F, 26th Regiment North Carolina Troops, who was killed at Bristoe Station in October 1863.\n\nEditor’s Desk (p. 1)\n\nThe editor introduces the tenth year of publication of Military Images, provides a hint of the content of upcoming issues, and discusses his effort to protect the “MonsterMaul” proposed at Manassas by returning his wife’s credit cards with a letter of explanation to the main retailers involved.\n\nMail Call (p. 3)\n\nLetters of congratulations abound in this edition, with some readers providing bits of additional information about some past images, and with one reader providing a detailed explanation of why the publication resonates with her, such as the personal touches provided by vignettes, letters, and images that show the grit and resolve of the soldiers’ images.\n\nPassing in Review (p. 4)\n\nSix different publications are given rather short reviews; one is given longer treatment, beginning with Gettysburg Battlefield Commanders; A Photographic Guide by Blake Magner and Michael Cavanaugh. Although many people interested in the Civil War are aware of what the major commanders looked like, this book provides images of lesser-known and lower-ranking officers in a format this “illustrated organizational chart.” Catalogue of Civil War Photographers: a Listing of Civil War Photographer’s Imprints was compiled by George F. Witham; this first edition included over 1700 listings of photographers and the backmarks they used in their work organized by name and location. Following editions are anticipated as Witham had collected many more after publication. Next is the lengthier review of Joe Brown’s Army: the Georgia State Line, 1862-1865 by William Harris Bragg. He investigates the contradiction between centralized Confederate government as pursued by Jefferson Davis and the grip on individual states’ rights held by Georgia’s governor Joseph Brown. Bragg’s book tells the story of the military units organized to protect the railroad lines in northern Georgia, known as the Georgia State Line, which provides great detail about the men involved in the units involved. Next is Battle Cry of Freedom, the Civil War Era by James McPherson, which is part of a larger series of ten volumes. McPherson takes all the available assessments of the Civil War and provides insightful and original analysis that needs to be part of every Civil War enthusiast’s collection. Author Walter A. Clark originally wrote Under the Stars and Bars: Service with the Oglethorpe Infantry of Augusta, Georgia in 1900; this reprint is significant as this unit fought with the Army of the Tennessee, not the Army of Northern Virginia. The Civil War Campaign Medal was edited by John M. Carroll, describes the Congressional medal that was authorized in 1907, many years after the end of the war, which might explain why only 554 medals were issued after soldiers would apply. Finally, Custer and His Times: Book Three was edited by G.J.W. Urwin and Roberta Fagan who compiled fifteen articles by academics about Custer and his era, including an extensive bibliography of sources written between 1983 and 1985.\n\n“Tha Kill So meny of us”: the 26th North Carolina Regiment at Gettysburg unit history by Greg Mast (pp. 5-11)\n\nBeginning with a brief background of the 26th North Carolina covering its formation and eventual integration into the brigade of Henry Heth, the article traces the action that involved the regiment during the Battle of Gettysburg. The author uses excerpts from several soldier memoirs as well as nine images of members of the 26th (with short biographies), and one map illustrating the assault by Pettigrew and Brockenbrough on July 1. At the end of the day, the 26th North Carolina Regiment could only muster 216 men. The next day, the band of the regiment played to cheer the remaining soldiers, but on July 3, the 26th was led by Brigadier General J. Johnston Pettigrew as part of Pickett’s Charge. Three officers and 67 “muskets” returned.\n\nThe Blue Springs Images photo analysis by Scott Cross (pp. 12-15)\n\nThe author ties five different outdoor images showing scenes such as “Division of IV Corps, Blue Springs, Tenn.,” which shows the division of Grose’s Brigade set in order of battle, to a photographer named Sweeney from Cleveland, Tennessee, who was in that area in April, 1864. Images include Companies B and C of the 184th Illinois Infantry and the 9th and 36th Indiana.\n\nThe Marine Finds a Mate or, “Ain’t Love Grand” humor by John Stacey (pp. 16-17)\n\nA series of postcards copyrighted in 1909 by Theodor Eismann of New York show the progression of a romance between a Marine and a young lady. Beginning with “The First-Meeting” and ending with “After the Ceremony,” the five cards shown are possibly only part of the tinted series printed in Germany. The cards were addressed to a Miss Ada Y. Miller by J.P.M., but were never mailed.\n\nThe Well-Accoutered Soldier: Army Uniforms of the Civil War, Part IX by Michael J. McAfee (pp. 18-24)\n\nTwenty-one different images illustrate the accoutrements required by various types of soldiers in different roles as described in the introduction. Waist belts and shoulder belts that held the cartridge and cap boxes needed to fire weapons, bayonets, side arms, haversacks, knapsacks, and canteens were all among the equipment that frequently was not adequately imaged in total by photographers of the era, unless they happened to be near a camp. Officers had waist belts for their side arms and sabers. The images include the accoutrements required by musicians, including cavalry buglers, and other “quasi-military” groups. Each image includes a caption that highlights unique details and provides identification of the soldier or at least his unit.\n\nHistory, Photography & the Civil War: a critical bibliography of books for buffs by Book Review Editor Philip Katcher (pp. 25-27)\n\nFrom the advent of the daguerreotype in 1839, people have invested in having their images reproduced, usually for personal reasons. It was not until much later that the photograph in its many forms became to be considered an important form of primary documentation. When considering the Civil War image, having a reliable source to reference when trying to date or place an image is important for collectors, historians, and others. This article outlines and critiques the several essential volumes that those interested in Civil War photography should consider. Some are more specific (such as Cities Under the Gun: Images of Nashville and Chattanooga by James A. Hoobler) while others attempt to cover the entirety of the era (The Photographic History of the Civil War edited in volumes by Francis T. Miller). This comprehensive bibliography should assist readers in finding the best source of information to meet their needs.\n\nStragglers (pp. 29-30)\n\nThe first page of contributed images focuses on horses: one “riding” his cavalryman, while the other shows a National Guard officer mounted on his steed in about 1881 with his servant rides a donkey. Other images include a “Wide-Awake” boy, who campaigned for Abraham Lincoln in 1860 with a distinctive uniform consisting of rain cape, pole with whale oil lamp and flag, and a small kepi-type cap. Crowds appearing upon the news of Lee’s surrender at Appomattox are shown in a carte de visite by J.B. Hazelton of Montrose, Pennsylvania. One contributor asks for help in identifying garrison troops in his quarter-plate tintype that appears to be of the Civil War era, however the hats worn appear to be from the 1870s.\n\nBack Image\n\nThree different images are presented: two Philadelphians in an albumen print, two first lieutenants from about 1855 in a quarter-plate daguerreotype, and five men in a quarter-plate ruby ambrotype, some in uniform, some not, but all with cigars.\n\nThe complete issue\n\nVol. IX, No. 6\n\n(32 pages)\n\nPrint edition: Visit our store to check availability\n\nDigital edition: Visit JSTOR.org to purchase\n\nSubscribe to MI\n\nExplore the MI Archives: Browse | Advanced search | Tutorial\n\nInside\n\nCover image\n\nThe image of “Capt. Sam. J. Richardson” from the Independent Company of Texas Cavalry, complete with jaguar skin trousers with “conchos” (ball buttons) down the seams and matching holsters greets the reader of this issue of Military Images.\n\nEditor’s Desk (p. 1)\n\nThe editor introduces the issue as the first “all Confederate” issue of the magazine, thanks to the many submissions of Rebel images by readers of MI. He also warns about another attempt to reduce the Manassas battlefield and encourages readers to contribute to the fund being raised to fight commercial encroachment of the battle site.\n\nMail Call (p. 3)\n\nLetters to the editor include identifications of soldiers in images from past issues, including more information on Private Edwin F. Jemison, whose image is often used to embody the youth of the soldiery in the Civil War. The collection of images belonging to Michael McAfee in the previous issue is also lauded.\n\nPassing in Review (pp. 4-5)\n\nThis issue features five reviews of new publications and alerts readers to recent reprints of older works they may be interested in acquiring. The first review is Forts Henry and Donelson: the Key to the Confederate Heartland by Benjamin Franklin Cooling. The author looks at the battles in their larger context of the whole war, critiques the first losses for the Confederacy as being due to lackluster generalship, and looks at the aftermath of the battles as well. Second is Gettysburg: The Second Day by Harry W. Pfanz. Lauded as a major work, the reviewer’s only complaint is that the book focuses only on the southern portion of the fighting under Longstreet and does not consider any of Ewell’s contributions. However the contribution to understanding of Gettysburg by this work is significant. Third is Judah P. Benjamin, the Jewish Confederate by Eli N. Evans; while the reviewer admits that a biography of Benjamin is a difficult task as he destroyed much of the documentation of his work for the Confederacy and did not write or discuss the war afterwards, he also outlines a number of factual errors that make this biography less than complete. The fourth book reviewed is A Generation on the March: the Union Army at Gettysburg by Edmund J. Raus, who provides a profile of all Federal units, identification of corps, commanders, origin, strength and losses, and the location of the unit monument on the Gettysburg field. The last new publication is entitled Lee’s Tarnished Lieutenant: James Longstreet and His Place in Southern History by William Garrett Piston, who attempts to analyze how Longstreet’s image declined in the years following Lee’s death and why it is unlikely to be resurrected by scholarship. The two reprintings noted are Yankee Blitzkrieg: Wilson’s Raid Through Alabama and Georgia by James Pickett Jones (1976) and Confederate Navy Chief: Stephen R. Mallory by Joseph T. Durkin as part of the “Classics in Maritime History” series published by the University of South Carolina Press.\n\nThe Whole World was Full of Smoke: Letters of J.A. Byers, 17th Mississippi Infantry edited by Hartman McIntosh (pp. 6-11)\n\nBorn in Alabama, the soldier in the ambrotype is a handsome man with a bit of a blonde cowlick, and a prolific writer of letters, many of which are printed in this feature. Including one copy showing a cross-hatched letter (where paper was saved by writing over again at 90 degrees), Private John Alemeth Byers left for Virginia with his “Panola Vindicators” from Mississippi at the age of 25. The eleven letters he wrote as a member of Company H of the 17th Mississippi Infantry were written to Sister, Father, and Uncle, and trace his journey through the war from First Manassas (when he was too ill to fight), to Balls Bluff, to the Peninsula, where he starts requesting that the family send him Gilbert (a slave) to be a body servant for him. Wounded in the hand at Second Manassas, he writes again during the February after Fredericksburg, and tells the family that he and Gilbert are doing alright in the cold. The next letter is from a year after Gettysburg, where Byers took part in fighting with Barksdale’s Brigade in the Peach Orchard, being left behind severely wounded when the Confederates returned to Virginia; he was eventually sent home on furlough once returned to the Confederacy. He sees Gilbert at this time, who seems to be working on his own as a camp cook. The letters continue from around Petersburg and then on to the Shenandoah Valley, when Byers’ unit is moved in the fall of 1864. His letters provide an interesting glimpse into the life of a Confederate soldier, as he makes comments on people known to his family, requests specific types of clothing in almost each letter, and wishes for food from home as well as more letters. The last letter is from one of his commanding officers, Capt. Jesse C. Wright, who talks about “Almuth” as a valued member of the company and describes his death as quick; his belongings were to be forwarded with Gilbert as “soon as the opportunity presents itself.”\n\nRebels in Halifax: Rare Images of Confederates in Canada from the collection of Al Fleming (p. 12)\n\nThey are not identified, but the men posing before the second Confederate national flag had two cartes de visite with backmarks identifying them as being made by W. Chase in Halifax. They may be escaped prisoners of war or perhaps the St. Alban’s attackers? More information would need to be found to know for certain.\n\nVignette: Battery Guidon Bearer, Pvt. Louis Sherfesee, Hart’s South Carolina Artillery by John Bigham (pp. 13-14)\n\nNot many guidon bearers, North or South, survived the entirety of the war, but the subject of this vignette is an exception. With the words “Hampton’s Legion” and “Washington Artillery” sewn on it, the banner that Private Sherfesee carried as well as his photographic image from June 1861 are presented along with a brief history of his Civil War record. He was part of Hart’s Battery and described being sent out to attract the fire of Federal troops at Freestone Point on the Potomac. When Hampton’s Legion was broken up, Sherfesee was with Hampton’s cavalry under J.E.B. Stuart; the damage to the guidon was sustained at the cavalry battle at Brandy Station in 1863. His service ended with the Battle of Bentonville in 1865.\n\nWounded & Captured at Gettysburg: An account by Sgt. William Jones, 50th Georgia Infantry edited by Keith Bohannon (p. 15)\n\nThe vignette begins with a description of the wounded soldier arriving at his home plantation, not being recognized by his own mother. Sgt. William Moore Jones was missing a leg and spent four months of incarceration by the Union at Point Lookout. The households of two plantations, his and his uncles, turn out to welcome him home, and after recounting his service at Second Manassas, South Mountain, Antietam, and Chancellorsville, the article begin with the soldier’s own words describing the action of Semmes’ brigade, probably fighting with Kershaw’s South Carolinians on the Second Day at Gettysburg. He describes his original wound, how he insisted on surgeons from his own regiment to be the ones to remove his foot, and the fact that he was captured when it was decided that his portion of the ambulance train on the way to Williamsport would not be able to sustain a crossing of the Potomac. His description of how the Union physician who eventually came to his assistance dealt with gangrenous wounds is horrific but spellbinding, and it was this one dedicated Union surgeon who saved his life. After his exchange, Sgt. Jones was hospitalized at Chimborazo in Richmond before making his way home, arriving in mid-April of 1864.\n\nSoldiers of the Southland compiled by Daniel Brogan (pp. 16-27)\n\nA total of forty different images of Confederates makes up this pictorial article, from a rare antebellum daguerreotype of a South Carolina firefighter to before-and-after-the-war images of the same Confederate officer. Coming from a number of different collectors, this compilation shows the wide variety of men and uniforms that represented the South in the Civil War. One soldier is identified as “E. Cunningham, May 1861, aged 14,” showing some of the youth involved in the war. Another image is of Florida Captain Robert Knickmeyr and his wife, presenting the impact the war had on families as well as the two ambrotypes of Louisiana brothers “Uncle Jimmy Harris” and “Uncle T. Harris” who were both identified as “brothers of Grandma Finley” in the inscription on the reverse. Many of the soldiers are identified, but just as many are not, leaving the reader to wonder about the fates of the men presented in these images.\n\nVignettes: Five Tarheels by Greg Mast (pp. 28-31)\n\nEach of the images in this feature includes a brief biography of each soldier, only one of which appears to have survived the Civil War. Included are a quarter-plate ambrotype of Pvt. George Washington Lyon (killed July 1, 1863 at Gettysburg), a ninth-plate ambrotype of Pvt. James Wilkerson (killed at Chancellorsville on May 3, 1863), a sixth-plate ambrotype of Pvt. William T. Blanton (died of typhoid fever on June 30, 1862), a ninth-plate ambrotype of possibly Maberry Marvin Miller (paroled at Petersburg on June 26, 1865), and a carte de visite image of Pvt. Robert Jones (died of smallpox on October 20, 1863), the image of which may be a copy of a hard photographic image.\n\nBack Image\n\nA Rebel looks out from under his forage cap in a ninth-plate ambrotype found in Galveston, Texas.\n\nThe complete issue\n\nVol. XXIX, No. 1\n\n(48 pages)\n\nPrint edition: Visit our store to check availability\n\nDigital edition: Visit JSTOR.org to purchase\n\nSubscribe to MI\n\nExplore the MI Archives: Browse | Advanced search | Tutorial\n\nInside\n\nCover image\n\nA half-plate ambrotype from the Guy DeMasi collection pictures Surg.

Vaughan.\n\nMedical Images of the Civil War Period by Dr. Gordon E. Dammann, D.D.S., F.I.C.D., F.A.C.D. (pp. 3-34)\n\nSubtitled “A Leading Collector Reminisces About Collecting Medical Images,” the author explains how photographs were originally not big on his list to acquire and how that changed when he became interested in these “capsules of history.” He continues to discuss some of the most memorable images in his collection. What follows Dammann’s introduction is 116 photographs gleaned from the author’s collection and others.

McAfee (pp. 45-46)\n\nIn “The Reverend Doctor Gordon Winslow,” McAfee explains that the theme of the issue prompted him to move away from the usual format to share Winslow’s story. As chaplain of the 5th New York Infantry (Duryee’s Zouaves), Winslow saw much of the war. In 1863 he left the regiment to become Sanitary Inspector of the Army of the Potomac under the auspices if the United States Sanitary Commission. Illustrations include four cartes de visite of Winslow and a carte de visite of his son, Cleveland Winslow, pictured as colonel of the 5th.\n\nSutler’s Row (p. 47)\n\nThe Last Shot (p. 48)\n\nA carte de visite from the collection of Dr. Paul R.

McAfee. These include a member of the 146th New York Volunteer Infantry with its distinctive uniform, a member from the 3rd Massachusetts Cavalry, a ship’s boy with his mascot, an unidentified Rhode Islander, and a New York Zouave.\n\nEditor’s Desk (p. 1)\n\nThe editor lets the readership know that the Visitor Center at Gettysburg National Military Park is looking for images to be included in a mural entitled “Wall of Faces.” He also lets the readers know that the lawsuit Katz v. Gladstone that stemmed from a book review in “Passing in Review,” Vol. VII, No. 2 was settled as being without merit. The format of this special issue is introduced, and the editor lets the readers know that more Confederate images are on the way in future issues.\n\nMail Call (p. 2)\n\nLetters to the editor include a detailed drawing and description of a Minie ball medal similar to the “Massachusetts Mystery Medal” and the identification of an assumed foreign musket in “Stragglers” as an American model. There were also identifications of two Vermonters and a correction of the name of the drummer boy killed at Antietam (Charles E. King). One letter provided a rationale for why an image may show A.P. Hill in a naval type uniform in 1858.\n\nInterview with Mike McAfee (pp. 3-4)\n\nBeginning with a general interest as a child in things military to happening to find a job at the West Point Museum, the interview discusses how McAfee got interested in the collection of images. As he also works professionally as a museum curator, he has some advice for collectors who are looking for images now as opposed to when he began collecting in the 1960s. For example, he has very few if any Confederates in his collection as they have become rare and expensive, so he has focused more on Federal images. He also collects more general images as opposed to specific subjects and highly suggests protecting these “little bits of history” by using archival sleeves. While the images in this issue of MI are not necessarily his best, McAfee has provide a wide range of images for the enjoyment of the readership.\n\nPre-War Images (pp. 5-7)\n\nFour stereographic images, including an enlargement of one showing mounted New York Hussars in a parade begin this section of Mike McAfee’s collection of images. These outdoor scenes include the North Dock at West Point and a militia picnic. The ambrotypes included in this section include a member of a New York drill company, a militiaman who did not eventually serve in the Civil War, a New York militiaman wearing the regulation 1858 uniform and two militiamen in the Continental uniforms worn by some militia of the antebellum era.\n\nThe First Volunteers (pp. 8-11)\n\nTwenty images from McAfee’s collection show the different uniforms worn by those who were among the first to volunteer in the Civil War. This would include an image of the large blouse worn by Rhode Island light artillery units and the uniforms of the Collis and Rush Hawkins Zouave regiments. Many of the image subjects are identified, such as Brigadier General Benjamin Butler in the uniform of the Massachusetts militia unit he led. Another carte de visite from the collection is of Francis Brownell of the 11th New York (the “Ellsworth Zouaves”), who avenged the death of Colonel Elmer E. Ellsworth in Virginia in 1861.\n\nCamp Life (pp. 12-15)\n\nMany of the fourteen images presented in this section of the issue are a combination of stereographs and cartes de visite that show the defenses outside of Washington, at Harper’s Ferry, and other camp sites. A few show different leaders outside of their own personal camps, such as the 1861 images of Captain Thomas Francis Meagher and Colonel Adolph von Steinwehr prior to Bull Run. The formal and informal posing of these images provide a glimpse into the early years of a Civil War camp.\n\nThe Troops (pp. 16-20)\n\nTwenty-four different images from the famous young drummer boy John Clem (who retired as a Brigadier General in 1916) to the bugler from the 1st New York Cavalry show something of the life of the Civil War enlisted man. There are variations in uniform, weaponry, types of service, and state of origin as well as in format of the images themselves.\n\nThe Officers (pp. 21-24)\n\nAll but one of the twenty officers presented in this collection of cartes de visite also show many different variations, from the lieutenant wearing all of his gear for his portrait and the cavalryman wearing Mexican spurs, to the clergyman wearing his simple black frock coat that typified his vocation. Two images are of European aristocracy, one of whom returned to his home country of Sweden once his service in the Federal army was at an end. Some of the officers survived, but some did not, as indicated in the image captions.\n\nStragglers (pp. 25-28)\n\nA number of unidentified soldiers are among the “Stragglers” with some wearing identifiable uniforms while others are completely unknown. One image is of a chasseur from the 83rd Pennsylvania Infantry, so identified on the back of the image by noted Civil War artist A.R. Waud. A few of the men, such as Hospital Steward George H. Thompson are unique images that do not easily fall into a category. Any information regarding these men would be appreciated by Mike McAfee.\n\nPassing in Review (pp. 29-31)\n\nTen different publications are included in this issue, with many of them being concise and to-the-point. First is a review of Brief History of the 30th Georgia Regiment by Augustus Adamson, an exact reprint of the 1912 publication of the same title. It includes some biographical information written later in their lives. Next is The Heavens Are Weeping: The Diaries of George R. Browder 1852-1866 edited by Richard Troutman. The reviewer warns that the cover of the book, which features the battleflag of the Army of Northern Virginia and two Union soldiers, is misleading as very little of the diary entries have anything to do with the Civil War directly. That being said, it does provide some insight into everyday life of the era. Third is Cities Under the Gun by James A Hoobler, and provides readers with images of Chattanooga and Nashville, Tennessee. The book makes some “then and now” comparisons and includes Corps of Engineers drawings or blueprints of some buildings. Similarly, Portraits of Conflict: a Photo History of Arkansas in the Civil War by Bobby Roberts and Carl Moneyhon provide a detailed regional history of the war in Arkansas, with many previously unpublished images. Confederate General Service Accoutrement Plates by Lon W. Keim, M.D. is an excellent volume for those collectors who would appreciate the detailed images and information about plates and buckles worn by Confederates, including some images of soldiers wearing the items. The next item for review is a film entitled The Civil War Soldier: The Infantryman, written and directed by Steve Tilson. A 24-minute videotape, it is an attempt to capture some of the work of living historians in VCR format, and provides basic background on Federal and Confederate soldiers; the reviewer provides some suggestions for future improvement to this relatively new way of imparting this kind of information. The Drums Would Roll by Thomas C. Railsback and John P. Langellier is an attempt to provide a pictorial history of U.S. Army bands on the frontier. The reviewer suggests that more attention to the selection and presentation of the images would greatly improve this work. Next is Illustrations of U.S. Military Arms 1776-1903 and Their Inspector’s Marks is a reproduction of the 1949 Bannerman’s Catalog and provides information relevant to arms collectors. The Art of Warfare in the Western World by Archer Jones begins with the Greeks and moves up to modern times, outlining the evolution of weapons systems, focusing on heavy and light infantry and heavy and light cavalry as well as a small section on naval development. A major work, the reviewer feels it is a significant research tool, although the treatment on the Civil War is brief and focuses on transportation methods. Finally, is Peter Newark’s work Sabre & Lance: An Illustrated History of Cavalry which the reviewer feels falls far short of the mark the title implies.\n\nBack Image\n\nFive additional images from the McAfee collection are included on the back cover as well. This includes a woman who may be a vivandiere, a Zouave, an unidentified soldier, and two unidentified couples.\n\nThe complete issue\n\nVol. XXXIV, No. 3\n\n(72 pages)\n\nPrint edition: Visit our store to check availability\n\nDigital edition: Visit JSTOR.org to purchase\n\nSubscribe to MI\n\nExplore the MI Archives: Browse | Advanced search | Tutorial\n\nInside\n\nCover image\n\nAn original color-tinted sixth-plate ruby ambrotype of Lt.

He introduces the cover story, a gallery of portraits of Union and Confederate soldiers who were killed, wounded or captured during the three-day engagement.\n\nDownload (free)\n\nMail Call (p. 3)\n\nFeedback includes an anecdote about 6,000 Dead Letter Office ambrotypes, praise for Richard A. Wolfe’s “Custer’s West Virginia Red Ties,” the identification of a Massachusetts soldier pictured in the Spring 2016 issue, and thoughts about the Jefferson and Varina Davis tintypes, truth and understanding.\n\nDownload (free)\n\nPassing in Review (p. 4)\n\nDistinctive Union soldier portraits are the stars of the show in a self-published book of highlights of one man’s 30-year journey as a Civil War photo collector. In The Union Soldier: Images of the Civil War, Bruce Bonfield brings together 170 selected photographs from his personal holdings.\n\nDownload (free)\n\nThe Honored Few (p. 5)\n\nAt the Battle of Gettysburg, Col. Wheelock Graves Veazey of the 16th Vermont Infantry led a bold counterattack against advancing Confederate troops during Pickett’s Charge. The Vermonters was successful. In 1891, Veazey was recognized with the Medal of Honor for his courage on the battlefield.\n\nPhoto Sleuth by Kurt Luther (pp. 7-8)\n\nWhat is the value of a photo inscription as an identification tool? Author Kurt Luther shares how the post-war writing taped to the back of a tintype helped solve one photo mystery—and introduce another.\n\nFinding My Great-Grandfather by Mark H. Dunkelman (pp. 9-10)\n\nIt’s the dream of Civil War students with an ancestor who fought for the Blue or Gray—finding an original wartime portrait of their soldier. And when it happened to Mark Dunkelman, whose great-grandfather fought with the 154th New York Infantry, it was one of the most fantastic finds he had ever had in six decades of researching the regiment.\n\nCardomania! How the Carte de Visite Became the Facebook of the 1860s by Ronald S. Coddington (pp. 12-17)\n\nThe carte de visite format is a blip on the timeline of photographic history, wedged between the beauty of the daguerreotype and the technical improvements later in the 19th century. But during its heyday in the 1860s, cartes de visite affordability, reproducibility and share-ability made it a social media powerhouse.\n\nJefferson Davis, Political Soldier by John O’Brien (pp. 18-19)\n\nIn early 1861, Jefferson Davis served as major general in command of Mississippi’s army. The stint lasted only a few weeks until he was inaugurated president of the Confederate nation. During this brief period, curious Northerners wanted to see a portrait of Davis in uniform. New York photographer Charles Fredricks made it happen with a bit of photo trickery.\n\nAntebellum Warriors (p.20)\n\nA daguerreotype of a pre-Civil War militiaman wearing chevrons and epaulettes on his uniform seems confusing. Is he a commissioned or non-commissioned officer? The answer may be a surprise.\n\nHonored Dead, Haunted Survivors introduced by Harold Holzer (pp. 21-35)\n\nThey fell in the thousands during three brutal days of carnage in a crossroads community in southeast Pennsylvania. The ground hallowed by their blood—Little Round Top and Culp’s Hill and The Wheatfield—are forever part of our American memory. A small yet significant group of the men who were killed, wounded or captured are remembered here in portraits and personal stories.\n\nFinal Harvest: The Last Journey of a Confederate Lieutenant Wounded and Captured at Pickett’s Charge by Charles Joyce (pp. 36-38)\n\nLt. John R. Emerson and his comrades in the 26th North Carolina Infantry marched into the hail of fire at Pickett’s Charge and like so many of the regiments were decimated in the assault. For Emerson and so many others who were shot and captured by the enemy, the day marked the beginning of a journey from which many never returned.\n\nA Gallant Son of Orange Falls at Gettysburg by Ronald S. Coddington (pp. 40-43)\n\nThe body of Capt. Isaac Nicoll of the 124th New York Infantry was lined up with other dead after Georgia Confederates took position of part of Houck’s Ridge on the afternoon of July 2. One of the Georgians picked a Bible out of Nicoll’s pocket. The Testament’s journey from its late owner to his father in New York is the stuff of legend.\n\nReturn and Retreat at Gettysburg: A Seminarian Is Called to Arms to Defend His College Town by Paul Russinoff (pp. 44-46)\n\nFrederick Klinefelter, like many college students during the war, suspended their studies to enlist in the army. Klinefelter’s circumstances are however unusual, for he had attended Gettysburg College and was a student at the Lutheran Theological Seminary when Gen. Robert E. Lee and his Confederates invaded the North. The young seminarian joined many of his fellow students to repel the invaders, and went down in history as among the first to fight at Gettysburg.\n\nImmortality on Little Round Top, Butchery in Saunders Field by Kevin Canberg (pp. 48-50)\n\nTwo officers who served in the 140th New York Infantry, Capt. Henry Belding Hoyt and Lt. Joseph H. Pool, served with distinction in the fighting at Gettysburg. But less than a year later in The Wilderness, they would face some of the toughest fighting of the war. Both men would pay a price in the fighting at Saunders Field, a place where the glory of Gettysburg had no value.\n\nConspicuous Cadet at New Market: The life and legacy of VMI’s Jonathan E. Woodbridge by Katie O’Halloran Brown (pp. 51-53)\n\nLate on the night of May 10, 1864, the cadets of Virginia Military Institute were called out of bed for orders that directed them to join Confederate forces at Staunton, Va. Despite the late hour, “the air was rent with wild cheering,” as the men broke from ranks, excited at the prospect of finally having a hand in the conflict. Among the cadets was 20-year-old Richmond native Jonathan Edwards Woodbridge. His story is representative of the young men who stepped up when their country called upon them.\n\nAt Gettysburg, Life Imitates Art by Ronald S. Coddington (pp. 54-55)\n\nThe story of Amos Humiston of the 154th New York Infantry, found dead on the Gettysburg battlefield clutching an ambrotype of his three children, is one of the war’s most poignant stories. And yet an eerily similar poem written a year before Humiston’s death is forgotten.\n\nHighly Honorable and Strictly Confidential Service by Scott Valentine (pp. 56-58)\n\nOhio farm boy Smith Stimmel knew when he enlisted in the 7th Independent Company of Ohio Volunteer Cavalry that he was slated for unusual duty. He could not have known that he would soon by a guard at the White House and come to hold the president who lived there in the highest regard.\n\nUniforms & History by Michael J. McAfee (p. 59)\n\nIn “Gettysburg’s Damned Black-Hats and Other Distinctive Fellers,” Mike introduces readers to some of the more unique uniforms worn by federals at the time of the Gettysburg Campaign.\n\nButterflies and Battle Scars (pp. 60-64)\n\nAn exclusive gallery of selected photographs adapted from The Union Soldier: Images of the Civil War. The book, by Bruce Bonfield, is discussed in Passing in Review.\n\nStragglers: Distinctive Images from MI contributors (pp. 66-70)\n\nIncluded in this issue is a Georgia Confederate from the studio of respected Charleston, S.C. photographer George S. Cook, and a reenactment of Union soldiers apprehending three men, one of which appears to be holding Greek Fire.\n\nSutler’s Row (p. 71)\n\nThe Last Shot (p. 72)\n\nCollector Rick Brown shares a sixth-plate ambrotype of an unidentified member of the 2nd U.S. Sharpshooters, a crack regiment commanded by Col. Hiram Berdan.\n\nThe complete issue\n\nVol. IX, No. 4\n\n(32 pages)\n\nPrint edition: Visit our store to check availability\n\nDigital edition: Visit JSTOR.org to purchase\n\nSubscribe to MI\n\nExplore the MI Archives: Browse | Advanced search | Tutorial\n\nInside\n\nCover image\n\nA sixth-plate tintype shows an unidentified soldier from the 2nd Vermont Volunteer Infantry.\n\nEditor’s Desk (p. 1)\n\nThe editor responds to readers requesting more Confederate images. He explains that it is not due to a Federal bias, but basic economics. There were far more photographers available to soldiers from the North than from the South and Federal soldiers were more financially able to purchase their images than were their Confederate counterparts. Military Images strives to include at least one feature on a Confederate topic per issue and would like to increase that number. It takes readers willing to write the articles to make that happen.\n\nMail Call (p. 3)\n\nA few letters are included in this issue, including one that shows fake “Kearney Cross” (sic) medals sold by the B.T. Hayward Co. A notice from the editor is included to let the readership know that the Taney Farm Bill had indeed been signed by President Reagan, preserving an important part of the Gettysburg Battlefield. Another reader writes to ask if an image of an officer from a previous issue of MI is the same man (Lt. Col. J.W. Lyman) in a carte de visite from the collection of Ronn Palm.\n\nPassing in Review (p. 5)\n\nThis issue presents five different publications for review. The first is The Divided Union by Peter Batty and Peter Parish. This volume is a companion publication to the BBC production of the same name that had been shown on the A&E channel. The text focuses more on political and civilian issues than on battlefield descriptions and some of the images are not presented as accurately as they could have been, but it is an overall nice publication. Next is Photographic Collections in Texas by Richard Pearce-Moses, who provides a comprehensive overview of all of the public collections that are open to research in Texas, an important source for those interested in viewing what is available there. Soldiers, Sutlers, and Settlers: Garrison Life on the Texas Frontier by Robert Wooster describes the conditions and concerns of the people who settled Texas and built a society there. The major problem with the book is that the images provided are not captioned, which may lead the reader to misinterpret them or put them into the wrong context. The Confederate Image by Mark E. Neely, Jr., Harold Holzer, and Gabor S. Boritt was produced as part of a traveling show of Confederate prints (not photographs). It attempts to show that the lack of prints such as those created by Currier and Ives and Harper’s Weekly in the North led to a lack of a common frame of reference that united the South both during and after the war. Last to be discussed is Lincoln’s Dreams by Connie Willis, a work of fiction that involves the dreams of researchers, one of whom has rather accurate dreams of the Civil War. The work includes Civil War characters such as Lincoln and son Willie, Lee and daughter Annie, and makes for an interesting if not completely accurate read.\n\nA Norwegian in Blue: Letters of Iver Torkelson, 15th Wisconsin edited by Anthony B. Torkelson (pp. 6-13)\n\nThis series of translated letters edited by the author’s great-grandson. They trace the Civil War journey of Sgt. Iver Torkelson, part of the “Scandinavian Regiment” which was composed of soldiers who did not have a good command of the English language. Indeed one of the notes by the editor of the article states that many of the Norwegians stationed at Island No. 10 died of disease as their reluctance to show their inability to speak English made them hesitant to go for medical care. For a while, Torkelson worked with a saw mill; two of his letters describe problems they were having which allowed him time to write to his family. He was concerned about letters and pay getting back home to Wisconsin; he cites two instances of mail being stolen (once by John Morgan’s guerillas) and one instance where rebels stole about $20,000 from the express service that took pay home. The letters describe the surrounding countryside from his travels in detail, but do not discuss the fighting; his unit participated at Perryville, Murfreesboro, and Chickamauga, although Torkelson missed some of this, having come down with typhoid fever and then being reassigned to the Invalid Corps in late 1863. The last letter, from 1876, is to a friend from his Army days, describing the adventure he had tracking thieves who had stolen his horses. There are also images throughout, such as the one showing new recruits with both American and Norwegian flags flying.\n\nFaithful to the End: Letters of Lt. William Boswell, 35th Georgia edited by Terry Lynn Anderson (pp. 14-15)\n\nA few letters survive from this educated Georgia farmer, who left for the war led by his brother-in-law, fighting for the “liberties, the home, the all-in-the-world” of his wife and two children. Boswell was a religious man, as the partial letter and the short letter to his mother reveal. The touching letter to his wife, Missouria, was in between engagements at Chancellorsville and Gettysburg; in all, Boswell saw other action at the Wilderness, Mine Run, and Anna River and was wounded three times.\n\nA Distant Drummer: Images in the Collection of Frederick Fabel (pp. 16-21)\n\nTwenty images of drummers grace this pictorial article, with drummers of all ages and showing all kinds of different drums. The author of the article is also a drummer, and began his collection of drumming images in 1983. The drummer was a familiar and necessary figure in Civil War regiments, sounding when it was time to get up, time to eat, and to keep time on the march. The author requests that if anyone can identify the images more precisely, to please contact him.\n\nVignette: James Buckner, Marine by David M. Sullivan (pp. 22-24)\n\nIt is not often that one hears about a person who is three feet, eight inches joining the U.S. Marine Corps, but in 1837, such was the case for James Buckner; he was just seven years old and enlisting as a musician. Fifer Buckner saw much in his Marine career, including the initial cruises of at least two experimental vessels, wartime service in both the Mexican and U.S. Civil Wars, and periods where he was unable to serve due to ill health. Most of his Civil War service was spent on the Mohaska. The vignette includes two images of the life-long Marine during that era of his service.\n\nIn the Nick of Time: The Ohio National Guard to the Rescue by Chris Nelson (p. 25)\n\nThis vignette details the events experienced during a 100 day enlistment of the 147th Ohio Volunteer Infantry, made up of mostly Ohio National Guardsmen. Elihu Pearson was a member of that group, which was called to the defense of Washington in May 1864. Pearson took part in the defense of Fort Reno during Jubal Early’s Confederate attack through Maryland, and then Fort Stevens, with President Lincoln present in the fort at the time. Pearson also got into a bit of a fix when he was found to have removed his “accoutrements” without permission, but this did not seem to cause him any undue trouble. A carte de visit image of Private Pearson with his wife, Eliza Jane, round out the article.\n\nEin Grün Berg Deutscher: A German officer in the 3rd Vermont by Wendell W. Lang, Jr. (pp. 26-27)\n\nThe recent discovery of an identification disk on the banks of the Rapidan River in Virginia led to this vignette, which describes the career of Johann Friedrich Koch, who took the name of John F. Cook upon his arrival in the U.S. from Saxony as a child. His identification badge shows him as a participant in the “War of 1861” in which he was enlisted as a private in July of that year. Cook eventually rose to the rank of Major after fighting in some battles such as the Peninsula, Antietam, and the Bloody Angle at Spotsylvania Court House and being wounded twice.\n\nStragglers (pp. 29-31)\n\nThree different images of soldiers from the collection of Robert Kotchian include a soldier with an imported Liege rifle on a ninth-plate sized image, a quarter-plate image of an outdoor backdrop with many different relics included, and carte de visite of a sailor with a painting of the Monitor on the background. The large image on the last two pages is of “Haley’s Coronet Band” from Lexington, Kentucky. Taken towards the end of the Civil War, readers are asked if they know of any additional details about the unit posed in the large albumen print.\n\nBack Image\n\nA cabinet card showing a man displaying two popular board games: “The Blue and the Gray” and “The Four Rival Lovers.”"
