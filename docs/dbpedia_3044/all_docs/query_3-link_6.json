        "text": "One Hundred and Eighty-fourth Infantry. Â— Col., John H. Stover; Lieut. -Col., Charles Kleckner; Majs., Charles Kleckner, George L. Ritman. This regiment was recruited from the state at large and rendezvoused at Camp Curtin, Harrisburg. During May, 1864, seven companies were mustered into the U. S. service for a three years' term, the remaining three companies being mustered in during Sept., 1864, for a one year term, and joined the regiment before Petersburg, early in Oct., 1864. Col. Stover did not assume command of the regiment until Jan. 1, 1865. He had previously served as captain in the 10th, and major in the 106th. On May 14, 1864, the seven companies then organized, left the state for the front under the command of Maj. Kleckner, and joined the army of the Potomac as it was crossing the Pamunkey river. It was at once assigned to the 2nd brigade, 2nd division, 2nd corps; took part in the fighting at Cold Harbor, leading its brigade in two deadly assaults. Its loss here was 16 killed and 94 wounded, and it won the warm commendation of its brigade commander, Gen. Pierce. In the first assaults on Petersburg, it again lost severely, having 52 killed and wounded and 115 taken prisoners. During its 25 days of active service at the front, the command lost 350 out of its 500 members, including 12 officers, killed, wounded, or captured. Seven of the prisoners died at Andersonville and several more at Salisbury and Florence, while many of the wounded prisoners died at Petersburg. The fragment of the regiment which was left was engaged at Deep Bottom and Strawberry Plains in July, losing 27 killed and wounded out of 97 engaged. It was active at Reams' station, where Lieut.-Col. Kleckner was severely wounded while cheering on his men. It then served in the trenches before Petersburg until the close of October, being joined meanwhile by the three new companies. Late in October it fought at Hatcher's run, losing 15 killed and wounded, and then resumed its place in the trenches, being stationed between Forts Haskell and Stedman, where it was much exposed to the enemy's sharpshooters. In Feb., 1865, it was actively engaged at Dabney's mill and remained encamped on the field until the opening of the final campaign at the close of March. In the assault on Petersburg, April 2, it escaped with small loss and then moved with its corps in the final pursuit of the enemy, which ended with Lee's surrender at Appomattox. Returning to Washington it participated in the grand review May 23. The one year companies, H, I and K, were mustered out of service on June 2, 1865, at Munson's hill, Va., and the original seven companies, A to G, were mustered out near Washington, July 14, 1865."
