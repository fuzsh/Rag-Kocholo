He was born, June 14, 1819. He was a wood-cutter and shingle-maker, having worked in all the long stretch of woods that used to extend across Mount Pleasant township from New Oxford to Littlestown, now all gone. He was a son and only living child of William Weaver and Catharine Rath, a name that has long since disappeared here. Jere Weaver was first married to a daughter of Nicholas Dahlhammer, and his last wife was a Craumer of Littlestown. He had eleven children, Lewis, Frank, John, Pius, William, Mrs. Buff, Mrs. Martz, Mrs. Vincent Storm, Mrs. Peters, Mrs. Bohm, and Miss Emma who remained at home and faithfully cared for her aged parents to the last. Mr. Weaver was a good citizen and a life long member of Conewago Church. He served in the Union Army during the civil war and was a pensioner.\n\nPeter Wagaman (Bates: Wageman)\n\nPrivate; April 7, 1865 (Substitute)\n\n• Mustered out with Company; June 29, 1865\n\n– Date of Death: September 22, 1905\n\n– Place of Burial: St. Joe’s Cemetery, Bonneauville, PA\n\nWolford, Elias – Private; March 20, 1865 Drafted; mustered out with Company, June 29, 1,65\n\nWeigle, David – Private; April 7, 1865 Substitute; mustered out with Company.
