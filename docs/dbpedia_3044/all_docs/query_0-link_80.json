Photo: Pennsylvania Capitol Preservation Committee\n\nActive November 29, 1862 to August 1, 1863Country United StatesAllegiance UnionBranch InfantrySize 1,332Engagements Gettysburg Campaign\n\nThe 172nd Pennsylvania Infantry was an infantry regiment in the Union Army during the American Civil War.\n\nFormation[]\n\nWhen Pennsylvania did not meet President Lincoln's August 1862 request for 300,000 nine-month volunteers, the Commonwealth drafted (under the Federal Militia Act of 1862[1]) fifteen regiments between mid-October and early December 1862, totaling 15,000 men. All fifteen regiments were mustered out of service by mid-August 1863. Few saw any combat action.[2]\n\nThe 172nd Pennsylvania Infantry was organized at Harrisburg, Pennsylvania (Camp Curtin). The regiment’s soldiers were selected principally from Snyder and Northumberland Counties, with detachments from Clearfield, Elk, McKean, Union, Montour, and Butler Counties.[3] In all, 1,332 men were mustered into the regiment.[4]\n\nBy company, most soldiers hailed from the following counties:\n\nCompany A: Snyder, Northumberland, and Union\n\nCompany B: Northumberland\n\nCompany C: Snyder, Elk, Union, and Northumberland\n\nCompany D: Northumberland\n\nCompany E: York and Elk\n\nCompany F: Clearfield, Montour, and Union\n\nCompany G: Snyder and Union\n\nCompany H: Northumberland, Montour, and Elk\n\nCompany I: Snyder\n\nCompany K: Northumberland[5]\n\nService[]\n\nThe regiment mustered in for nine months service between October 27 and November 29, 1862, under the command of Colonel Charles Kleckner.[6]\n\nThe regiment was assigned to larger formations as follows:\n\nGarrison duty at Yorktown, Va. assigned to IV Corps, Department of Virginia, to April 1863\n\nAdvance Brigade (West), IV Corps, Dept. of Virginia, to June 1863\n\n3rd Brigade (Kleckner), 1st Division, IV Corps, to July 1863\n\n1st Brigade (Tyndale), 3rd Division, XI Corps, Army of the Potomac, to August 1863.[7]\n\nOn the day after their arrival at Yorktown in December 1862 with three other drafted regiments from Pennsylvania, Maj. Gen. Erasmus D. Keyes, IV Corps commander, wrote that he found the regiments to be “perfectly green” and that “none of them are in a condition to meet the enemy.” Thus he assigned the 172nd to the heavy guns at Yorktown and until April 1863 they remained unassigned to any brigade.[8]\n\nIn June 1863, the men of the 172nd offered to re-enlist for six months at the end of their term of service. The War Department originally intended to accept their offer but upon learning that it was contingent upon serving in the Department of the Susquehanna in Pennsylvania, declined, and the regiment mustered out as scheduled on August 1, 1863.[3][9]\n\nDetailed service[]\n\n1862[]\n\nMoved to Washington, D.C., December 2.\n\nTo Newport News.

Colonel Thaddeus G. Bogle, and Major M. T. Heintzelman. On December 10, 1862, Lt. Colonel Bogle was discharged and replaced by Lt. Colonel James A. Johnson. The regiment mustered out on August 1, 1863, under Colonel Kleckner.[6]\n\nBefore serving in the 172nd, Col. Kleckner served as a private in Company K of the 6th Pennsylvania Infantry (in 1861) and then as a first lieutenant in Company D of the 48th Pennsylvania Infantry (in 1861-62). Afterwards he served as a lieutenant colonel in the 184th Pennsylvania Infantry (in 1864-65). After the war, he was elected to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives as a Republican, in 1868 and 1869.[13]\n\nSee also[]\n\nList of Pennsylvania Civil War regiments\n\nPennsylvania in the Civil War\n\nReferences[]\n\nAttribution\n\nThis article contains text from a text now in the public domain: Dyer, Frederick H.
