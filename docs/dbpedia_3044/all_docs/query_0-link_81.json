Grant\n\nIf you have installed the mod before, you must delete any previous versions of the mod and start a new game. Never overwrite any files or try to play a saved game from a previous version of the mod.\n\nIt is strongly recommended that you download Warband Script Enhancer 2 (WSE2) and run the mod through it's launcher in order to avoid crashes and significantly boost performance. More information about WSE2, as well as additional crash solutions, are included under the mod's Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) found on the download page, and included as a text file in the mod package.\n\nHere is a link to the WSE2 forum: Forums.taleworlds.com\n\nHere is a YouTube tutorial on how to install WSE2: Youtube.com\n\nDownload the WinRAR package called, \"The American Civil War Mod Revived v3.0\", and save it to your desktop or another preferred destination that you can easily access.\n\nOpen the package and extract the folder inside called, \"The American Civil War Mod Revived\", to your modules folder (default location should be, \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\MountBlade Warband\\Modules\").\n\nStart Mount & Blade: Warband, select the mod from the drop down menu, and play!\n\nYou can join the mod's discord server here: Discord.gg\n\nThere has been a great deal of progress since the last update we had all the way back in May of last year, and therefore this introduction will be brief, so that we can get to the good stuff right away. First though, a great deal of gratitude is owed to dstn, Seek & Destroy, and Swyter for helping with a few nagging issues with the mod, as well as helping with some other more interesting improvements, some of which we will examine later on in this article.\n\nThe 3.0 update is available on the Steam Workshop, and the troop guides under the articles tab are now fully up to date!\n\nThere are a number of new battle scenes, as well as new scenes for cities, forts, and villages, however they can't all fit in one article so photos of them will be included in the gallery, under the images tab.\n\nMonocacy\n\nThe Battle of Monocacy was fought on July 9th, 1864, about 6 miles (9.7 km) from Frederick, Maryland, as part of the Valley Campaigns of 1864. The battle was part of Lieutenant General Jubal A. Early's raid through the Shenandoah Valley and into Maryland in an attempt to divert Union forces from their siege of General Robert E. Lee's army at Petersburg, Virginia. Between 9:00 and 10:00 a.m., Confederate Major General Stephen D. Ramseur's division encountered about 3,500 of Union Brigadier General James B. Rickett's men along the bluffs overlooking the bridge where the Georgetown Pike crossed the river, while Major General Robert E. Rodes' division clashed with Brigadier General Erastus B. Tyler's brigade, who were guarding the Baltimore Pike and its stone bridge across the river. Union prisoners taken during this phase told the Confederates that the entire VI Corps was present, which seemed to have heightened the Confederates' caution and they did not initially press their numerical advantage.\n\nBelieving that a frontal attack across the Monocacy River would be too costly, Early sent Brigadier General John McCausland's cavalry of about 1,100 men down Buckeystown Road to find a ford and outflank the Union line. McCausland crossed the Monocacy below the McKinney-Worthington ford, about a mile downstream from the Georgetown Pike bridge, and attacked Major General Lew Wallace's left flank. Due to the rolling terrain, McCausland's men did not notice that four regiments of Ricketts' veteran troops had taken a position along a fence separating the Worthington and Thomas farms. Consequently, the Union line was able to fire a single volley that destroyed McCausland's front line and panicked the remaining Confederates. McCausland rallied his brigade and launched another attack, but was unable to break the Union line and retreated.\n\nWhen the cavalry could not break the Union flank on its own, Early sent Major General John B. Gordon's infantry division across the ford to assist in the attack. Gordon launched a three-pronged attack with three brigades against Ricketts' center and both flanks. Ricketts' right flank was pushed back, allowing the Confederates to enfilade the Union line. Pressure from Ramseur's attack on the Union center and Confederate artillery fire from across the river kept Wallace from reinforcing Ricketts' men. Unable to hold the Union line, Wallace ordered a retreat toward Baltimore, leaving Tyler's brigade holding the stone bridge with a small force of men. Rodes' Confederate troops made one final push to capture the stone bridge about 6:00 p.m., but most of the Union troops were already headed toward Baltimore. At the end of the day, the outnumbered Union forces had withstood five attacks before they were forced to retreat.\n\nThe battle was the northernmost Confederate victory of the war. Afterward, the Union troops retreated to Baltimore, Maryland, and the Confederates continued toward Washington, D.C., but because the battle had delayed Early's march for a day, Union reinforcements had time to get to the Union capital before the Confederates.\n\nFort Stevens\n\n(Note that this map replaces the siege scene for the city of Washington in the mod.)\n\nAfter being delayed at the Battle of Monocacy, Jubal Early's forces advanced on Washington, D.C., and his cavalry attacked Fort Stevens on July 11th and 12th, only 4 miles (6.4 km) from the White House. Early delayed an infantry assault because he was still unsure of the strength of the Federals defending the fort, much of his army was still in transit to the front, and the troops he had were exhausted due to the excessive heat and the fact that they had been on the march since June 13th. Additionally, many of the Confederate troops had looted the home of Montgomery Blair, where they found barrels of whiskey in the basement of the mansion, and many troops were too drunk to get a good start in the morning. This allowed for further fortification by Union troops.\n\nAround 3:00 p.m., with the bulk of their force present, the Confederates commenced skirmishing, probing the Union defenses. Near the start of the Confederate attack, the lead elements of the Union VI and XIX Corps arrived at the fort, reinforcing it with battle-hardened troops. The battle picked up around 5:00 p.m. when Confederate cavalry pushed through the advance Union picket line. A Union counterattack drove back the Confederate cavalry and the two opposing lines confronted each other throughout the evening with periods of intense skirmishing. The Union front was aided by artillery from the fort, which shelled Confederate positions, destroying many houses that Confederate sharpshooters used for protection.\n\nPresident Abraham Lincoln, his wife Mary, and some officers rode out to observe the attack, either on July 11th or July 12th, and were briefly under enemy fire that wounded a Union surgeon standing next to Lincoln on the Fort Stevens parapet. Lincoln was brusquely ordered to take cover, mostly likely by Union Major General Horatio Wright. A story has grown up, probably apocryphal, that future Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., then an aide-de-camp to Wright, yelled at Lincoln, \"Get down, you fool!\" This is believed to have been only the second time in American history that a sitting president came under enemy fire during a war (the first being President James Madison during the War of 1812).\n\nAdditional Union reinforcements from the VI and XIX Corps arrived overnight and were placed in reserve behind the line. The skirmishing continued into July 12th, when Early finally decided that Washington could not be taken without heavy losses which would be too severe to warrant the attempt. Union artillery from Fort Stevens attempted to clear out Confederate sharpshooters hidden in the buildings and fields in front of the fort, however when the artillery fire failed to drive them off, a brigade of the VI Corps under Daniel Bidwell, supported by Oliver Edwards' brigade and two Veteran Reserve Corps regiments, attacked at about 5:00 p.m. The attack was successful, but at the cost of over 300 men.\n\nEarly's force withdrew that evening and crossed the Potomac River back into Virginia on July 13th, successfully bringing with them the supplies they seized during the previous weeks. Early remarked to one of his officers after the battle,\n\n\"Major, we didn't take Washington but we scared Abe Lincoln like hell.\"\n\nFort Donelson\n\n(Note that Fort Donelson encompassed an extensive line of fortifications, and this map is based on one section of the fort where two regiments of Colonel William R. Morrison's brigade, along with one regiment, the 48th Illinois, from Colonel W.H.L. Wallace's brigade, made a failed attack on February 13th, 1862, to seize a battery (\"Redan Number 2\") that had been plaguing their position. Also from this section of the fort, Confederate troops under Brigadier General Simon Bolivar Buckner assisted in the Confederate surprise flanking attack on February 15th.)\n\nFollowing his capture of Fort Henry on February 6th, 1862, General Ulysses S. Grant was ordered by General Henry Halleck to assault Fort Donelson immediately and capture it by February 8th. General Ulysses S. Grant moved his army 12 miles (19 km) overland to Fort Donelson, and made reconnaissance, conducting several small probing attacks, and observing the natural obstacles and Confederate improvements to the fort. From the information he had gathered through these efforts, Grant knew that the fort would not be taken by the 8th. On February 14th, Union gunboats under Flag Officer Andrew H. Foote attempted to reduce the fort with gunfire, but were forced to withdraw after sustaining heavy damage from the fort's water batteries.\n\nOn February 15th, with the fort surrounded, the Confederates, commanded by Brigadier General John B. Floyd, launched a surprise attack, led by his second-in-command, Brigadier General Gideon Johnson Pillow, against the right flank of Grant's army. The intention was to open an escape route for retreat to Nashville, Tennessee. Grant was away from the battlefield at the start of the attack, but arrived to rally his men and counterattack. Pillow's attack succeeded in opening the route, but Floyd lost his nerve and ordered his men back to the fort. The following morning, Floyd and Pillow escaped with a small detachment of troops, relinquishing command to Brigadier General Simon Bolivar Buckner, who accepted Grant's demand of unconditional surrender later that evening.\n\nThe battle resulted in virtually all of Kentucky as well as much of Tennessee, including Nashville, falling under Union control. The capture of Fort Donelson also opened the Cumberland River, an important avenue for the invasion of the South, and the Union's success elevated Ulysses S. Grant from an obscure and largely unproven leader to the rank of major general, along with the nickname of \"Unconditional Surrender\" Grant.\n\nBaton Rouge\n\nOn April 25th, 1862, the day before New Orleans fell to the U.S. Navy fleet under Admiral David Farragut, the Confederate government decided to abandon Baton Rouge. On May 29th, Union Brigadier General Thomas Williams arrived with six regiments of infantry, two artillery batteries, and a troop of cavalry, and began the occupation of Baton Rouge. During the summer, Major General Earl Van Dorn, commander of Confederate forces east of the Mississippi, desired to regain Baton Rouge. It was thought that re-taking Baton Rouge would be key to driving the Union out of Louisiana, as they could then launch attacks along the Red River on Union-occupied territory, and threaten Union control of New Orleans. On July 27th, 5,000 Confederate troops left Vicksburg, led by Major General John C. Breckinridge, and they were joined by a small infantry division led by Brigadier General Daniel Ruggles. Simultaneously, the Arkansas was sailing down the Mississippi River, en route to engage Union ships near Baton Rouge.\n\nGeneral Thomas Williams reportedly had word of the Confederate forces' departure, and on August 4th, after information was again received of the imminent arrival of the Confederates, Union troops were formed up a mile outside of Baton Rouge. The Confederates lost the element of surprise when they were discovered by Union sentries, but despite this, the attack was launched at daybreak on August 5th. The Union troops were in the center of Baton Rouge, while the Confederates were lined up in two divisions north of the city. The action occurred around Florida Street, and began with the Confederates pushing the Union forces all the way across town. Bitter fighting took place, especially around the Magnolia Cemetery, and it was in this action that General Williams, was killed in action, with command passing to Colonel Thomas W. Cahill.\n\nColonel Cahill led a retreat back to prepared defensive lines near the Penitentiary, under the protection of Union warships, and the Confederate troops began coming under fire from the gunboats. The undermanned Confederate ironclad Arkansas arrived not long after to engage the Union ironclad USS Essex, but her engines failed just four miles above the city. The commander of the Arkansas ordered the ship to be set on fire to prevent it's capture. Without any prospect of naval support, Breckenridge was unable to attack the Union positions and withdrew. Union troops evacuated the city a week later, concerned for the safety of New Orleans, but returned that autumn. The Union victory at Baton Rouge halted Confederate attempts to recapture New Orleans.\n\nUnion\n\n83rd Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry\n\nThe 83rd Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry (PVI) was mustered into Federal service in Erie, Pennsylvania, on September 8th, 1861, under the command of Colonel John McLane. Like many of the regiments recruited at the beginning of the Civil War, the 83rd’s history began with a pre-war militia unit, the \"Wayne Guards\", named after the famous Revolutionary war hero, General Anthony Wayne. When President Lincoln issued his first call for volunteers, the energetic McLane responded by organizing a three-month regiment, with the Wayne Guards forming the first three companies of the new regiment, and five other companies being recruited from Erie County, and two from Crawford County. The regiment was not present for the Union disaster at the Battle of First Bull Run, however the news of this disaster aroused the nation to a new sense of danger, and on July 24th, McLane received an order from Secretary of War Simon Cameron to raise a new regiment for three years of service.\n\nBy September, more than 1,000 men had responded to McLane’s call, in addition to the 300 men of the old regiment, and the unit was officially designated the 83rd in the order of its acceptance into Pennsylvania service. The regiment soon became noted for the excellence of its drill and its soldierly appearance, and were publicly acknowledged as the best shots at target firing. On one occasion, General McClellan, in passing along the lines with his staff, rode up to Colonel McLane, and said,\n\n\"Colonel, I congratulate you on having one of the very best regiments in the army\".\n\nThat fall, the army held a competitive trial for drill proficiency, and the 83rd was one of two regiments awarded prized imported French uniforms. Described as being a \"...uniform of the Chasseur de Vincennes, consisting of a shako, two uniforms,\" a cloak, a leather knapsack, and complete sets of personal and mess gear. Though the uniforms were impractical for field use and sent away before their first battle, many of the men had their photographs taken in their fancy new clothes.\n\nThe 83rd participated in almost every major battle in the East, including the Seven Days Battles, Antietam, Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville, Gettysburg, Petersburg and Appomattox Court House, earning it's well deserved reputation as \"one of the very best regiments in the army.\" The number of battles in which this regiment was engaged, as published in orders, and recorded in the official army register of 1865, is 25, larger by two than any other Pennsylvania infantry regiment. One of it's most famous actions was at the Battle of Gettysburg, where it fought alongside the 20th Maine, 44th New York, and the 16th Michigan in the defense of Little Round Top. Colonel Strong Vincent, the regiment's commanding officer, was mortally wounded during this engagement. Due to their ability to endure harsh conditions, particularly muddy and challenging terrains, the regiment earned the nickname, \"Pennsylvania Mud Turtles\".\n\nThe 83rd Pennsylvania suffered the second-highest number of battle deaths among Union Army infantry regiments during the war, second only to the 5th New Hampshire. During its service, the 83rd Pennsylvania lost 11 officers and 271 men killed in combat, and 2 officers and 151 men died from disease or accidents. In total, 435 of the regiment's men died during the Civil War, amounting to 24% of its enlistments. Historian Lt. Col. William Fox described the 83rd as one of the Three Hundred Fighting Regiments:\n\n\"Blunders caused none of its losses, none occurred in disastrous routs, its dead always lay with their faces to the enemy.\"\n\n12th Illinois Infantry \"First Scotch\"\n\nThe 12th Illinois Infantry Regiment, also known as the \"1st Scotch Regiment\", was organized at Springfield, Illinois and mustered in on May 2nd, 1861 for three-month service. The regiment was transferred to Cairo, Illinois, for garrison duty until August 1861, when it was mustered into Federal service for a three-year enlistment. On September 5th, 1861, the 12th, along with the 9th Illinois Infantry, moved up to and occupied Paducah, Kentucky, being the first Union troops there. The 12th remained at Paducah until February 5th, 1862, during this time being engaged in the demonstration against Columbus, Kentucky during the Battle of Belmont, and a reconnaissance in force towards Fort Donelson, Tennessee in January.\n\nThe regiment endured the cold, snow, hunger and fatigue of the Fort Donelson battle, suffering terribly, but also fighting nobly on February 15th, losing 19 men killed, 58 wounded, and 10 missing. The 12th then took part in the terrible battle of Shiloh, being engaged nearly the entirety of the two days of fighting, losing 109 men killed and wounded, and 7 missing. On April 28th, the 12th Illinois moved with the army on Corinth and was engaged in the siege of the city, doing its share of picket and fatigue duty, extending saps, and so on. After the evacuation of the city, the regiment was sent with General Pope in pursuit of the Confederates, but returned to Corinth after six days, where it remained until the middle of September.\n\nOn October 3rd and 4th, the 12th Illinois was engaged in the Battle of Corinth. The 2nd division under General Davies, and the 6th division under General McArthur, fought nearly the whole Confederate army. The losses were very heavy, and the fighting most desperate. On the 4th, \"Powell's Battery\", which the 12th Illinois were supporting, was captured by the Confederates in a charge, but was almost immediately retaken. In this affair the 12th took a very conspicuous and brilliant part. Supported by a small part of the 50th and 52nd Illinois Infantry, they drove the Confederates from the works, capturing a stand of colors, and turned the guns of the battery on the enemy. The division lost more than half of the men that were lost during the day, with the 12th Illinois losing 17 killed, 80 wounded, and 15 missing. Captain Guy C. Ward, acting major, was killed, and brigade commander General Oglesby was severely wounded.\n\nThe 12th Illinois went on to participate in the Battle of Missionary Ridge, and on May 9th, embarked upon the Atlanta Campaign, where it was actively engaged nearly every day until the fall of Atlanta. November 11th began Sherman's \"March to the Sea\", and the regiment was put to work burning bridges and tearing up railroads. On April 10th, the regiment marched in pursuit of General Joseph E. Johnston's army, arriving in Morrisville on the 15th, where it remained until Johnston's surrender.\n\nOn July 10th, 1865, the 12th Illinois was mustered out at Louisville, Kentucky, and received final pay and discharge at Camp Butler, Illinois on July 18th. The regiment suffered 5 officers and 143 enlisted men killed in action or mortally wounded and 3 officers and 109 enlisted men who died of disease, for a total of 260 fatalities.\n\n34th Ohio Infantry \"Piatt's Zouaves\"\n\nThe 34th Ohio Volunteer Infantry was a three-year regiment raised at Camp Lucas near Cincinnati on September 1st, 1861 by Abraham S. Piatt at his own personal expense. Most of the recruits came from the western part of the state, and they are well known for wearing an Americanized zouave uniform which consisted of a dark blue jacket with red trimming, a pair of sky blue baggy trousers with two red stripes going down vertically, a pair of tan gaiters, and a red Ottoman styled fez with a blue tassel. The organization’s members adopted the nickname, \"Piatt's Zouaves\", after the regiment's founder, Colonel Abraham S. Piatt, and their zouave uniforms.\n\nAfter training and drilling, the new regiment moved to Camp Dennison on September 1st, and then embarked trains for the front lines. They initially served in the forces under General George B. McClellan, and then under a variety of generals for the next two years while engaging in several raids and operations in the western Virginia region. On September 25th, 1861, the 34th Ohio won a victory at the Battle of Kanawha Gap near present-day Chapmanville, West Virginia. In September 1862, the regiment fought in the Kanawha Valley Campaign of 1862, doing much of the fighting at the Battle of Fayetteville.\n\nThe regiment's Colonel, John Toland, was killed July 18th, 1863, in the Wytheville Raid. When the regiment's term of enlistment expired late in 1863, the men voted to re-enlist on December 23rd. They were part of Crook's Expedition against the Virginia & Tennessee Railroad in early May and fought in the Battle of Cloyd's Mountain on May 9th. Later they fought in the Battle of Cove Mountain and in other smaller engagements in the region. The regiment was re-mustered as a veteran regiment on January 19th, 1864, and participated in many of the battles of the Valley Campaigns of 1864, including the Battle of Opequon near Winchester, Virginia.\n\nFor the remainder of the autumn of 1864, the 34th Ohio encamped near Kernstown, Virginia, until returning to Martinsburg in mid-December 1864. On December 22nd, 1864, the regiment boarded trains for Webster, Virginia and then encamped at Beverly, Virginia on December 28th. On January 11th, 1865, a Confederate force attacked Beverly, surprising the Union garrison and capturing most of the soldiers. The few members of the 34th Ohio that managed to escape retreated to Philippi, West Virginia, and officials reassigned these men to the 36th Regiment Ohio Volunteer Infantry on February 2nd, 1865, and thus the 34th Ohio ceased to exist.\n\nOver the course of the war, the 34th Ohio suffered 10 Officers and 120 enlisted men killed in battle or died from wounds, and 130 enlisted men dead from disease for a total of 260 fatalities.\n\n4th Michigan Infantry \"Dexter Union Guard\"\n\nThe 4th Michigan Infantry was organized at Adrian, Michigan and mustered into Federal service for a three-year enlistment on June 20th, 1861, with 1,025 men including officers. The 4th Michigan wore a very Americanized zouave uniform, consisting of a Federal dark blue sack coat, dark blue chasseur trousers, gaiters, and a maroon zouave fez with a light blue tassel. The 4th Michigan earned the nickname, \"Dexter Union Guard\", due to a significant number of it's recruits coming from Dexter, Michigan. The town's name became associated with the regiment, leading to the adoption of the nickname.\n\nThe regiment was sent to the seat of war near Washington to join up with the Army of the Potomac, where the men of the 4th saw extensive action during the Peninsula campaign in 1862, suffering 263 casualties. In the fall of 1862 the 4th was held in reserve during the battle of Antietam and was part of the V Corps that went in pursuit of the Army of Northern Virginia. Here they fought at Shepherdstown Ford, crossing it several times and successfully capturing four Confederate artillery pieces and driving the opposing Confederate infantry back. The 4th Michigan would once again see fighting at Fredericksburg and take another 14 casualties, however this was a small price compared to the Irish Brigade fighting on their right, who they witnessed suffer a two-thirds loss.\n\nIn May of 1863, the regiment was involved in the fighting at Chancellorsville, taking about 30 casualties, and not long after, they began moving north with the rest of the Army towards their fate at Gettysburg. On July 2nd, the 4th Michigan went into the Wheatfield at a time when the Union forces under Brigadier General Samuel K. Zook were overrun, leaving the 4th’s flank unprotected. The regiment became surrounded, and in the retreat, Colonel Harrison Jeffords rallied the men to save their flag, which was being captured. As Jeffords attempted to reclaim the flag, he was bayoneted by Confederate soldiers. The next day the colonel died of his wounds at the age of 26, being the only field officer stabbed with a bayonet on either side during the war. Sadly, his efforts were not successful, as the flag was lost in the close combat that took place in the Wheatfield, however, the attack was able to slow the Confederate advance across the area. The 4th Michigan suffered a terrible loss of 165 men killed, wounded, and missing during the horrific three-day battle.\n\nIn early 1864, 150 men from the regiment chose not to reenlist as they felt they had done their duty and it was someone else’s time to serve. However, almost an equal number of the regiment's veterans did reenlist, and by the end of April the army was getting ready to march towards one of its toughest campaigns yet under the direction of General Ulysses S. Grant. The Battle of the Wilderness was a costly one for the regiment. By it's end, they had fewer then 200 men still standing, but there was no time for rest as the battle at Spotsylvania Courthouse was just a few days later. By May 8th, the most senior officer still with the regiment was Captain David Marshall who took command of what was left of the unit. They received reinforcements on May 15th that brought them back up to about 200 men present for duty. The fighting carried on into June with Cold Harbor, and eventually the Confederate army was driven into the defenses around Petersburg. What was left of the 4th was not enough to be an effective unit any longer because of the casualties they sustained in May and June, so they were combined with the 1st Michigan Infantry, essentially bringing an end to the 4th Michigan as it had existed for the last three years.\n\nMajor Jarius Hall, now a Colonel, started to recruit for a reorganized 4th Michigan back home in the summer and fall of 1864, however, this new regiment would be sent west instead of east. During the rest of the year, the old 4th Michigan that had been combined with the 1st Michigan continued to stay outside Petersburg in trenches. They would see action again at Five Forks before being at Appomattox Courthouse for the surrender of Robert E. Lee in April 1865.\n\n1st Vermont Brigade\n\nThe 1st Vermont Brigade was organized in October 1861, primarily through the efforts of Major General William F. \"Baldy\" Smith. It was composed of the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th Vermont regiments, which had been individually mustered into service between June and September. The Vermont Brigade is one of the few in the Union army whose regiments were all from the same state. Even more rare, for a short time in June and July of 1863, there were two all-Vermont brigades in the Army of the Potomac. This unit had no uniform distinctions, save perhaps an occasional red blanket which was common to New England regiments. Also, the Vermonters were keen on wearing the more formal frock coat, as well as the soft black civilian slouch hat. They had no flashy clothing, no ornaments, no specific ethnic definition. Just tough Yankees, who fought with the pure motivation of love for country, and the old flag.\n\nIn April 1862, the brigade was incorporated into the Army of the Potomac as the 2nd Brigade, 2nd Division, VI Corps, and first saw action during Major General George B. McClellan's Peninsula Campaign in the battles of Williamsburg and Savage's Station. It was later present at the battles of South Mountain, Antietam and Fredericksburg, and fought in the campaign culminating in the Battle of Chancellorsville. The Vermonters participated in the VI Corps' capture of Marye's Heights in the Second Battle of Fredericksburg and then were prominent in the fighting at Salem Church. The regiment entered into 1863 with an already established reputation as the cream of the crop of the hard fighting VI Corps, being either the first in the fight, or the last to leave one. They were held in reserve during the Battle of Gettysburg, and afterwards elements of the Vermont Brigade were sent to help quell the draft riots in New York City.\n\nThe depleted brigade received reinforcements in May 1864 when the 11th Vermont Infantry was assigned to the organization, and that same month joined in Ulysses S. Grant's Overland Campaign towards Richmond. At the Battle of the Wilderness on May 5th, Confederate Lieutenant General A.P. Hill's corps had been brought up by midday and was attacking the weak Union center along the Orange Plank Road. The Vermont Brigade took the southern flank and charged the advancing Confederates. Ordered to retreat, the 5th Vermont regiment instead launched a bayonet charge, buying time for Union troops and the rest of the Vermont Brigade to fall back to their hasty works. In less than 12 hours of fighting, losses to the brigade totaled 1,269 killed, wounded, and missing.\n\nEarly in the battle of Spotsylvania Court House, elements of the Vermont brigade, defending barricades forward of the rest of the Union Army, were ordered to retreat and spike their supporting artillery pieces before the Confederates overran them. Disobeying orders, the commander of the brigade ordered the guns to be \"spiked with canister\", and the brigade was able to defend the guns and works successfully until reinforcements arrived. The Vermonters suffered heavily during the ensuing assault on the Confederate defenses as the Vermont Brigade led the assault on the \"Mule Shoe Salient\". On June 1st, 1864, the Vermont Brigade was one of the units selected to make the ill fated charge on the Confederate earthworks at the Battle of Cold Harbor, and in less than 10 minutes, hundreds of soldiers from the Vermont Brigade were killed or wounded. In less than one month of fighting, the brigade had been reduced from 2,850 men to less than 1,200.\n\nThe Vermont Brigade fought in the Valley Campaign against Confederate Lieutenant General Jubal A. Early, under the overall command of Major General Philip Sheridan. At the Battle of Cedar Creek, Early launched a surprise attack against Sheridan's army and the 1st Vermont Brigade covered the Union army's temporary retreat, prior to Sheridan's counterattack and decisive victory. Six Medals of Honor were awarded to Vermonters at Cedar Creek, and the brigade captured three regimental colors as well as much of the 12th North Carolina regiment. Returning to Petersburg, where it was engaged until the end of the war, the 1st Vermont Brigade spearheaded the attack on the earthworks defending the city, successfully breaking through the Confederate lines on the morning of April 2nd, 1865. Six more members of the brigade were awarded the Medal of Honor for valor in this action. After the surrender of Lee's army later that month, the brigade participated in the victory parade in Washington, before returning to Vermont where the men were mustered out of service.\n\nThe 1st Vermont Brigade suffered the highest casualty count of any brigade in the history of the United States Army, with some 1,172 killed in action.\n\n2nd Ohio Cavalry\n\nOn October 10th, 1861, the 2nd Regiment Ohio Volunteer Cavalry completed muster into service at Camp Wade, near Cleveland, Ohio, under the command of Colonel Charles Doubleday. Benjamin F. Wade and John Hutchins organized the regiment, with most of its members coming from the Western Reserve section of Ohio. The 2nd served in nearly every theater of the war, from Indian Territory to Tennessee to Virginia. The 2nd Ohio Cavalry made one of the most brilliant records of any regiment in the service, and six of it's members were awarded the Medal of Honor.\n\nThe regiment first moved to Missouri, scouting on the borders of Kansas, and in February 1862, drove the infamous William Quantrill from the town of Independence. In the summer it served in the Indian Territory, and in the fall joined General Blunt's campaign in Arkansas and Missouri, fighting at Pea Ridge, Carthage and other points. It then moved to Kentucky, and four companies raided East Tennessee. It joined in the pursuit of John Morgan and followed him 1,200 miles until he was captured. In September, the regiment again raided East Tennessee and operated on Confederate Lieutenant General James Longstreet's flank at Knoxville, fighting continuously with severe loss.\n\nIn April 1864, it was transferred to the Potomac and moved with Grant's army towards Richmond, fighting with Sheridan's Cavalry Corps around the flanks of the army. In August it moved to the Shenandoah Valley and engaged Confederate Lieutenant General Jubal A. Early, fighting at Opequan, Front Royal, and Cedar Creek. In March, 1865, it joined in the pursuit of Robert E. Lee and after the surrender of Lee's army, the regiment was reviewed at Washington and mustered out on September 11th, 1865.\n\nDuring the 2nd Ohio's term of service, 83 men, including 7 officers, died from wounds received on the battlefield. An additional 184 men, including five officers, died from disease or accidents.\n\nU.S. Colored Cavalry\n\nEstablished in response to a demand for more units from Union Army commanders, by the end of the war in 1865, the 175 total USCT regiments constituted about one-tenth of the manpower of the entire army. The U.S. Colored Cavalry regiments played a significant role during the American Civil War, representing the Union's commitment to utilizing African American soldiers in combat. Formed after the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863, these regiments consisted of freed slaves and free African American volunteers. Initially facing skepticism about their combat abilities, the U.S. Colored Cavalry quickly proved their worth on the battlefield, displaying courage and skill in various engagements. Despite facing discrimination and unequal treatment, these soldiers contributed significantly to the Union's success, challenging racial prejudices prevalent during that era.\n\nThe U.S. Colored Cavalry participated in key battles such as the Battle of Saltville and the Battle of Nashville, where they demonstrated their bravery and resilience. Their involvement helped to dispel doubts about the combat effectiveness of African American troops and paved the way for greater acceptance and recognition. After the war, the Colored Cavalry regiments, along with other USCT regiments, played a prominent role on the American frontier in clashes with Native Americans, and came to be known as \"Buffalo Soldiers\". The struggle for racial equality continued long after the war, but the legacy of the USCT, including the Colored Cavalry, contributed to the broader movement towards civil rights, and paved the way for future integration of the military.\n\nIt should be noted that in the mod, the U.S. Colored Cavalry will start off being equipped with Pattern 1853 Enfield rifle muskets, and not every trooper will have a horse. This is to reflect the haste to equip and deploy these units, which was historically the case in particular for the 5th U.S. Colored Cavalry. Therefore these troops are best used as mounted infantry, where their horses are used solely for transportation, and the troopers dismount to engage the enemy on foot. However once they are upgraded to the veteran tier, all of the troopers will have horses, and be equipped with modern cavalry carbines, including Spencers, and can then perform the same role as other cavalry units.\n\nConfederate\n\n6th Alabama Infantry \"Raccoon Roughs\"\n\nThe 6th Alabama Infantry Regiment was organized in Alabama in May of 1861 with 12 companies and about 1,400 men recruited from Autauga, Henry, Jackson, Lowndes, Macon, Montgomery, Russell, and Wilson counties. The regiment fought throughout the Civil War until it was surrendered by Robert E. Lee in April 1865 at Appomattox Court House. Company I of the 6th Alabama Infantry was a mountaineer company known as the \"Raccoon Roughs\" for their choice of wearing raccoon skin caps.\n\nThe 6th Alabama was on the field but was not actively engaged in the Battle of First Manassas (Bull Run), and it passed the fall and winter in that vicinity. The regiment was also present at the Battle of Williamsburg, but never came under fire. At the Battle of Seven Pines, the 6th took a prominent part, losing 102 men killed and 282 wounded out of 632 engaged (59% of the regiment's total strength; their brigade lost 1,296 out of about 2,500). It again took a conspicuous part at the Battles of Mechanicsville, First Cold Harbor, and Malvern Hill. It was then in the advance movement across the Potomac and suffered slight losses at Boonsboro. At the Battle of Antietam (Sharpsburg), the 6th Alabama lost 52 men killed and 104 wounded, and at Fredericksburg, the regiment was again present for duty but was not engaged in the fighting.\n\nThe regiment then fought at Chancellorsville, suffering 156 casualties, and capturing a Federal battery flag and 105 prisoners. The 6th went on to participate in the Gettysburg Campaign under the command of Colonel James N. Lightfoot, fighting on Oak Ridge at Gettysburg on July 1st, and at Culp’s Hill on July 2nd and 3rd, suffering 22 men killed, 109 wounded and 31 missing out of 30 officers and 352 men engaged, a casualty total of more than 50% of their strength. Colonel Lightfoot, Major Culver, and Captains John W. Burton and William B. Hunt were wounded, with Burton captured as well.\n\nHaving spent the winter near Orange Courthouse, the 6th Alabama was at the Battle of the Wilderness, where it lost considerably, and it suffered even further severe losses at Spotsylvania Court House. Colonel Lightfoot was again wounded in this battle, and Adjutant John Whit Thomas was killed. The regiment's colors were captured by Captain Benjamin F. Davis of the 22nd Massachusetts Infantry Regiment, who was killed shortly afterwards. The regiment took part in the Valley Campaign of General Jubal Early and suffered casualties at Winchester. At the Battle of Cedar Creek, many of the regiment's men were captured. Moving back to Petersburg, it was placed in Fort Mahone and was almost continuously under fire until it surrendered at Appomattox with only 4 officers and 80 men remaining, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Culver. Of the 2,109 names on its rolls, nearly 400 were killed in battle, and 243 died of disease while in service.\n\n1st Kentucky Infantry \"Orphan Brigade\"\n\nAfter President Abraham Lincoln issued a call for 75,000 volunteer troops, the pro-Southern Governor of Kentucky, Beriah Magoffin’s response was terse and to the point:\n\n\"I will send not a man nor a dollar for the wicked purpose of subduing my sister Southern states.\"\n\nDespite their personal loyalties, Magoffin and other prominent Kentuckians sought to avert secession, maintain Kentucky's neutrality, and possibly play a role as a mediator in the conflict. Although Magoffin was forceful in his reply, the governor apparently did not speak for the majority of his own people, and perhaps more than any other state, Kentucky would come to know the dreadful meaning of the phrase, \"brother against brother.\"\n\nKentucky's declared neutrality prevented Confederate recruiting officers from mustering units within its borders, however this didn't stop thousands of Kentuckians from crossing into Tennessee to enlist at Camps Boone and Burnett, near Clarksville. These early regiments, combined with others raised that fall at Bowling Green, were organized into the 1st Kentucky Brigade. The brigade was the largest Confederate unit to be recruited from Kentucky during the war. When the Orphan Brigade was mustered into service, weapons were in short supply, and the troops were armed with old smoothbore muskets (some flintlock and others percussion) along with shotguns and hunting rifles. The men were given a bounty if they brought their own rifle, however some men had no arms at all.\n\nGoing into 1862, the men of the Kentucky Brigade began to present a more uniform appearance, and only a week before the Battle of Shiloh, every regiment except the 9th Kentucky was issued a supply of Enfield rifles imported from England (the 9th armed themselves with Enfields captured during the battle).\n\nThe brigade fought bravely and with distinction at a variety of battles throughout the Western Theater, including Shiloh and Stones River. At the Battle of Stones River, the brigade suffered heavy casualties in an assault on January 2nd, 1863, including General Roger W. Hanson, who had replaced Major General John C. Breckinridge as the brigade's commander. According to legend, Breckinridge, who vehemently disputed the order to charge with the army's commander, General Braxton Bragg, rode among the brigade's survivors, crying out repeatedly, \"My poor Orphans! My poor Orphans!\"\n\nThe origins of their nickname, \"Orphan Brigade\", are uncertain, and there is little evidence that use of the term was widespread during the conflict, but the veterans certainly felt the sentiment was appropriate and embraced it. Besides Breckinridge's legendary quote, one possible provenance of the name stems from Kentucky's tenuous political situation. Men had to leave the state to enlist in the Confederate army, and were unable to return home for fear of being indicted by the Union government, therefore becoming \"orphaned\" from their home state.\n\nThe Orphan Brigade lost another commander at the Battle of Chickamauga, when Brigadier General Benjamin H. Helm, Abraham Lincoln's brother-in-law, was mortally wounded on September 20th, 1863, and died the following day. The Orphan Brigade served throughout the Atlanta Campaign of 1864, then were converted to mounted infantry and opposed Sherman's March to the Sea.\n\nThey ended the war fighting in South Carolina in late April 1865, and surrendered at Washington, Georgia, on May 6th – 7th, 1865, receiving generous parole terms. Those in mounted units kept their horses or mules, and every seventh man was allowed to retain his musket for the journey home.\n\nThe Orphan Brigade is a noteworthy addition to the mod, being one of the most dynamic in their upgrade tree. As displayed in the above photos, the unit will start out equipped with a variety of low quality or civilian weapons, and lack a uniform appearance. They will then upgrade to become a more proper infantry unit, wearing standard Confederate uniforms and being armed with Enfield rifles. Their last upgrade tier will see them receive horses and change roles to become mounted infantry.\n\n4th Virginia Infantry \"Liberty Hall Volunteers\"\n\nThe 4th Virginia Volunteer Infantry Regiment was assembled at Winchester, Virginia, in July, 1861, under the command of Colonel James F. Preston. Its companies were from the counties of Wythe, Montgomery, Pulaski, Smyth, Grayson, and Rockbridge, and Company I was nicknamed the, \"Liberty Hall Volunteers\". This name came about because many of the members of Company I were students from Washington College in Lexington, Virginia, and at the time of the Civil War, Washington College was known as Liberty Hall Academy. The volunteers took pride in their association with the institution, and so chose the name. The 4th Virginia joined with other Virginia regiments to form the First Brigade of Virginia (nicknamed the \"Stonewall Brigade\" following the First Battle of Manassas).\n\nThe regiment fought at First Manassas, and their stout defense of Henry House Hill during that engagement led South Carolina General Barnard Bee to characterize their commander, General Thomas J. Jackson as a \"stone wall\", hence the brigade's name. The regiment's 31 dead and 100 wounded were the highest losses in the brigade. The 4th's men recovered and drilled for the next few months, and by March 1862, the unit was only about a third of its normal strength due to sickness and resignations, but still fought in the First Battle of Kernstown until its ammunition ran out, with 5 men killed and 23 wounded. That spring, the unit participated in Jackson's Valley Campaign, marching 646 miles in 28 days, fighting 4 battles and 6 skirmishes. The 4th Virginia was only peripherally involved during the first battle at Front Royal and the First Battle of Winchester, however, the Stonewall Brigade delivered the primary assault at Port Republic, and this unit lost only four men wounded.\n\nAs part of the Army of Northern Virginia during the Seven Days' Battles, the regiment participated in the Battle of Gaines' Mill and the Battle of Malvern Hill on July 1st, 1862, losing 8 men killed and 48 wounded in the campaign. Malaria, heat and skimpy rations took a higher toll before the Battle of Cedar Mountain on August 8th, 1862, where the unpopular General Charles S. Winder was mortally wounded along with 3 men of this unit being killed and another 6 wounded. At the Battle of Second Manassas, of the 180 effectives, 78 were wounded, including Major William Terry, but the unit was in high spirits from the Confederate victory in the battle. At the Battle of Antietam, the regiment lost 3 men killed and 3 wounded. It lost another 3 killed and 14 wounded in a skirmish at Kearneysville, at which Colonel Charles A. Ronald suffered a thigh wound which ended his military career. By December, the 4th Virginia was suffering from a smallpox epidemic and so was in reserve during the Battle of Fredericksburg. However when the Federals breached Jackson's line, they were called into action, and acquitted themselves well, despite losing 12 men wounded.\n\nOn May 2nd – 3rd, 1863, the Stonewall Brigade lost 48% (160 men) of the 355 engaged at Battle of Chancellorsville, including Brigadier General E. Franklin Paxton, who fell dead personally leading the brigade early in the battle. The 4th Virginia's casualties were the highest of any regiment in the brigade, but the greatest loss was hearing of General Jackson's death from pneumonia following his wounding by friendly fire. During the Battle of Gettysburg, the Stonewall Brigade participated in the fighting on Culp's Hill, but the 4th Virginia again suffered the heaviest losses within the brigade, losing 18 men killed, 50 wounded and 69 captured, as well as their battle flag. Only 66 men were left in the regiment to return across the Potomac River. During the winter of 1863 – 1864, most of the men in the Stonewall Brigade lacked shoes and socks, and rations were in very short supply. Conscripts, recruits and soldiers from other units were assigned to fill its ranks, so the 4th Virginia reached maybe 200 men. At the Battle of Spotsylvania, the regiment was trapped at the Bloody Angle and lost 7 men killed, 6 wounded and 126 captured, which led the Stonewall Brigade to cease existing as an independent unit.\n\nThe remains of the Stonewall Brigade, including the 4th Virginia, were consolidated into a new brigade under General William Terry, and joined the Second Corps under General Jubal Early in the Shenandoah Valley, and threatened Washington D.C., but were hopelessly outnumbered as they retreated, and lost the Third Battle of Winchester, with the 4th Virginia suffering 3 wounded and 8 captured. Another two men were lost at the Battle of Fisher's Hill, and at the Battle of Cedar Creek, one man was killed, 5 wounded and 4 captured. Terry's Brigade was assigned to join Robert E. Lee's besieged army at Petersburg and also saw action around Appomattox in the war's final days as Lee frantically sought to resupply his army.\n\nAt the surrender at Appomattox, the only staff officer left from the 4th Virginia was assistant Surgeon John A. Field. By this time, Captain Hamilton D. Wade had recovered from his wounds and was the senior field officer at the time, with 5 lieutenants and 38 men (of whom only 17 were armed). John P. Moore of the Liberty Hall Volunteers became the unit's last battle fatality, during the final attempt to break out from the encircling Union forces on Palm Sunday, April 9th, 1865, shortly before General Lee decided to surrender. Though it suffered heavy losses, two surviving officers resumed political careers after the conflict and won election to the U.S. House of Representatives, and several more served in the Virginia General Assembly.\n\n7th Florida Volunteer Infantry\n\nThe 7th Florida Infantry Regiment was organized at Gainesville in April, 1862, and its companies were recruited in the counties of Bradford, Hillsborough, Alachua, Manatee, and Marion. The composite rosters of this unit contains the names of 1,759 men. During the war, the 7th Florida Infantry served in R.C. Trigg's, Finley's, and J.A. Smith's Brigades of the Army of Tennessee, and took an active part in the arduous campaigns of the army, from Chickamauga and the Atlanta Campaign, to the battles of Nashville and Franklin, and then participating in the Carolina's Campaign before fighting its last battle at Bentonville. The 7th Florida surrendered on April 26th, 1865.\n\nPindall's Missouri Sharpshooters\n\nOn April 21st, 1862, the Confederate States Congress authorized each brigade of infantry to be assigned a battalion of sharpshooters. Per law, these battalions were to be armed with long-range rifles and were to consist of three to six companies. On November 25th, Major General Thomas C. Hindman ordered his subordinate division commanders to form the sharpshooter battalions if practical. One of Hindman's division commanders, Brigadier General Mosby Monroe Parsons, had two weeks earlier formed a sharpshooter company to serve with a brigade of Missouri troops. Two more sharpshooter companies were formed on November 29th, and the three were consolidated together into a battalion commanded by Major Lebbeus A. Pindall, at a camp near Fort Smith, Arkansas. Nothing indicates that the soldiers possessed any particular marksmanship abilities or met any other special qualifications for assignment to the battalion. In fact, the original company consisted of men assigned from a disbanded artillery battery and a company of partisan rangers, while the other two filled their ranks from the infantry regiments of Parsons' brigade.\n\nThe unit's first major battle was the Battle of Prairie Grove in December 1862. In the afternoon on December 7th, Parsons' brigade moved to the front, but Hindman ordered Pindall's battalion to remain in the rear near a church with Tilden's Missouri Battery. It remained in the rear for about an hour, but was ordered forward when Parsons requested support for his right flank. Parsons ordered an attack, which had some success. Shortly before sunset, Parsons ordered another attack, but it was repulsed. No surviving official report by Pindall about the unit's actions during the battle is known to exist, and the battalion suffered only three casualties during the fighting, all wounded.\n\nThe first half of 1863 saw the battalion serving at various points in Arkansas, however when a Confederate force attacked the Federal-held city of Helena, Arkansas, on July 4th, in an attempt to relieve some of the pressure on Vicksburg, Mississippi, the 9th Missouri Sharpshooters were put into action. At daylight on July 4th, Pindall's battalion drove in the Federal skirmish line and led Parson's brigade in the assault on \"Battery C\" atop Graveyard Hill, pinning down the artillery crews with their fire. Once the brigade charged forward, it quickly overcame the defenders and drove them into Helena. The brigade enjoyed only short-lived success, however, for it received no support on either flank and soon experienced the full brunt of their opponent's firepower. Parsons' men could not endure the fire and hastily retreated, with the sharpshooters covering their withdrawal. Pindall's sharpshooters suffered 14 men killed or mortally wounded, 22 wounded, and 8 missing at Helena, and mustered only 190 men present the following day.\n\nThe battalion was present in the Little Rock area during the Little Rock Campaign later in the year, but saw no action. In March 1864, it moved into Louisiana to oppose the Red River Campaign, during which it fought at the Battle of Pleasant Hill in early April. It is likely that the Confederate War Department officially designated the battalion as the 9th Missouri Sharpshooter Battalion at about this time as well. After Pleasant Hill, the battalion returned to Arkansas and was engaged at the Battle of Jenkins' Ferry on April 30th. The battalion spent the rest of the war at various points in Louisiana and Arkansas before the Confederate forces in the Trans-Mississippi Theater surrendered on May 26th, 1865. The battalion was sent back to Missouri on the steamboat Kentucky, but tragically the vessel sank in the Red River during the trip, and at least 12 men of the battalion died in the wreck.\n\n34th Virginia Cavalry\n\nThe 34th Virginia Cavalry Battalion was raised in the Appalachian mountain region of southwestern Virginia and adjoining areas of what became West Virginia, as well as Tennessee, Kentucky and North Carolina. Lieutenant Colonel Vincent A. \"Clawhammer\" Witcher and Majors John A. McFarlane and [John] William Straton were in command. During the war it served in the cavalry brigades of Albert G. Jenkins, William E. Jones and Bradley T. Johnson. Witcher was accused of committing wartime atrocities several times, and was court-martialed, however all of the 34th Virginia Cavalry's commanding officers survived the war, and both Witcher and Straton became involved in politics.\n\nThe battalion first engaged the Federals in western Virginia. On November 10th, 1861 it raided the town of Guyandotte, where Colonel (and future Congressman) Kellian Whaley was recruiting for the Union army. It captured Whaley and several others, however Whaley managed to escape. Confederate General John B. Floyd was also concerned about allegations of plunder and robbery conducted by Witcher and his men, and ordered Witcher arrested for two murders, but General Humphrey Marshall ordered Witcher released and his rangers placed under his command. Witcher and his men became infamous for performing grisly executions via a bent sapling tied around the victims neck, which when released, would tear the head off, thereby decapitating them. This method became known as \"Witcher's parole\".\n\nAlthough most of its activities involved raiding, the battalion fielded 172 men at the Battle of Gettysburg, before returning to western Virginia and becoming involved in operations in East Tennessee. During April, 1864, after new recruits in the new state of West Virginia added a new company, Company K, to the battalion, it contained 222 effectives. The 34th Virginia saw action at the Battle of Piedmont in Augusta County, Virginia, and fought with General Jubal Early in the Shenandoah Valley. The 34th disbanded at Lynchburg in April, 1865.\n\nOne of the most interesting new features that has been added to the mod is the ability to aim down the sights of your weapon. The player's first person camera will now be oriented above the weapon, rather than next to it, as it is in the original game. This will make using firearms in first person more viable and generally results in more accurate shooting, but just keep in mind that first person shooting in Mount & Blade has always been a little off, so don't expect absolute perfection. It's just how the game itself was designed, originally being a medieval fantasy game, it wasn't created around the concept of shooting firearms in first person.\n\nSome things to note are that the iron sights script is disabled while on horseback, because the camera will still want to be at the player's height on foot when you are mounted, so it would end up inside of your horse. You can also zoom in while aiming down the sights (Alt key by default), but if you don't fire the weapon, you will need to cancel the attack in order to exit the zoomed in iron sights mode.\n\nA new system of wages has been implemented, which will make maintaining armies a lot easier and affordable. Instead of once a week, pay day for your soldiers will now be bi-monthly (once every 60 days, to be exact), and Union soldiers will earn $13/month (or $26 every pay day), while Confederate soldiers will earn $11/month (or $22 every pay day). Flagbearers for both sides will earn $20/month ($40 on payday), and Union officers will earn $115/month ($230 on payday), while Confederate officers will earn $130/month ($260 on payday). The Native American faction's troops are exempted from this system, and will pay whatever the game already gives them. Mercenaries will be paid 50% more than the normal cost of troops, which is how the mercenaries pay is already determined by the game. Be mindful that the game may force you to pay your troops the first week of the game, but after that it will be once every two months, as it is supposed to be.\n\nSome of the goods have had their prices increased, as well as the amount of consumable units those items provide, so they can be sold for more money and feed armies for longer. There was also a typo in how much money you would get as a reward from prizefights; before it only gave the player $200, but it should have instead been $2,000. This has been increased to $3,000, since the maximum reward you can earn from sparring matches is $2,500, so it is only fair that you would earn more from the actual prizefights.\n\nThe final thing I would like to preview here is that I have added some guides to the Game Concepts tab, where you can find basic strategic and tactical information, as well as information about the usage of infantry and cavalry historically, and in the mod. There is also information about how the artillery works in the game, and explains everything you need to know about it.\n\nThis concludes the news update for version 3.0 of the American Civil War Mod: Revived! There are a ton of other updates, fixes, and changes to the mod that I could not fit into this one article, and you can find them all listed in the changelog.\n\nHave fun everyone! Thanks for playing, I'm glad you all have enjoyed the mod so much, and I hope that this new version will bring many more hours of enjoyment for you.\n\nRemember to give your love to your families, friends, neighbors, and pets, and take good care of each other. And on one final note, please take a moment to remember all of the brave men who gave their lives in this conflict, and the enormous suffering endured by the soldiers, civilians, and animals. It is my sincere hope that this project can help keep their memory alive.\n\n\"We are never prepared for so many to die. So you understand? No one is. We expect some chosen few. We expect an occasional empty chair, a toast to dear departed comrades. Victory celebrations for most of us, a hallowed death for a few. But the war goes on. And men die. The price gets ever higher. Some officers can pay no longer. We are prepared to lose some of us, but never all of us. But that is the trap. You can hold nothing back when you attack. You must commit yourself totally. And yet, if they all die, a man must ask himself, will it have been worth it?\"\n\n~ Michael Shaara, \"Killer Angels\""
