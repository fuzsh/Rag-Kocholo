        "text": "History and Campaigns\n\nThis regiment, Col. Ezra L. Walrath, was organized at Elmira; accepted by the State for a service of two years and numbered May 8, 1861; mustered in the service of the United States, at Elmira, for three months, May 13, 1861. At the request of the general government, it was ordered by the Governor of the State, August 2, 1861, to be mustered in the United States service for the unexpired period of its term of State service. February 3, 1862, it was consolidated into five companies, A, G, H, I and K; Company B being merged into H; C into K; D into I and K; E into A; F into H. The nucleus of this regiment was of members of the 51st Regiment, State Militia, and the companies were recruited principally: A, B C, E, H and I at Syracuse; D at Homer; F at Liverpool; G at Canastota; and K at Batavia. The regiment left the State May 29, 1861.\n\nColonel Henry A. Weeks received, on the return of the 12th Militia from its three months' service, authority to reorganize it for a service of three years. While the regiment as a body did not re-enter the service, a majority of the officers and enlisted men of the new organization, which was named - 12th Militia - were from the original regiment. The men were recruited principally in New York city, Patchogue and Buffalo, and mustered in the service of the United States for three years in October, November and December, 1861, and January, 1862. In January, 1862, Company A was transferred to the 102nd N.Y. Volunteers, and the seven remaining companies of the regiment consolidated into five, B, C, D, E, and F; Company G being merged into Company B, and K into E. These five companies left the State February 5, 1862.\n\nFebruary 8, 1862, the companies of the 12th Militia joined the battalion of five companies of the 12th N.Y. Volunteers, and completed the regimental reorganization of the latter, all the companies retaining their alphabetical designation. May 1, 1863, the two years' men were returned to Elmira and there honorably discharged and mustered out May 17, 1863; the three years' men were consolidated into a battalion of two companies, D and F, and this battalion, commanded by Maj. Henry W. Ryder, was, June 2, 1864, transferred to the 5th Veteran N.Y. Volunteers, as Companies F and E, respectively, of the latter.\n\nThe regiment served at Washington, D.C., from May 31, 1861; in the 4th Brigade, 1st Division, Army of Northeastern Virginia, from July, 1861; in Richardson's Brigade, Division Potomac, from August 4, 1861; in Wadsworth's Brigade, McDowell's Division, Army of the Potomac, from October 15, 1861; in Butterfield's Brigade, Porter's Division, 3rd Corps, Army of the Potomac, from March 13, 1862; in the 3rd Brigade, 1st Division, 5th Corps, Army of the Potomac, from May, 1862; the battalion as Provost Guard, 5th Corps, from May 1863.\n\nDuring its service the regiment lost by death, killed in action, 3 officers, 44 enlisted men; of wounds received in action, 22 enlisted men; of disease and other causes, 1 officer, 67 enlisted men; total, 4 officers, 133 enlisted men; aggregate, 137; of whom 4 enlisted men died in the hands of the enemy; and it took part in the following engagements, etc.:\n\nBlackburn's Ford, Va.

(The list of battles and of casualties has been paraphrased in its presentation.)\n\nThe list of officers of the regiment was copied from pages 1874-1877 of Phisterer.\n\nThe Regimental Band\n\nCongress, on July 22, 1861, passed an act authorizing a band of 24 musicians for each Regular Army regiment. Many volunteer regiments followed suit and recruited their own bands. The 12th NY Volunteer Regiment was apparently among that number, enrolling, December 1, 1861, at Syracuse, at least 13 men who are identifiable as members of the band of the 12th NY Infantry. One of these men, Lewis Bramer, Jr., of Fabius, kept a diary of his career in the regimental band. Sandra K. Walling has provided me with a copy of Lewis Bramer's diary, and I have been granted permission to post it. By July of 1862, with one of every forty soldiers a musician, Congress abolished regimental bands, and so the regimental band of the 12th NY Infantry ceased to exist. The men were discharged and most, if not all, returned home.\n\nThose that have been positively identified from the diary and from the Annual Report of the Adjutant-General of the State of New York for the year 1899. Albany: James B. Lyon, State Printer, 1900. include the men who are listed below.\n\nPage 8\n\nBALSEY, EUGENE.Age, -- years.

Willett Britton is an example of such a case. According to the muster rolls he first went into Co. I as a drummer. When the band was formed he seems to have been transferred to the band, and when the band was discharged he went back into Co. I. His name never actually appears in Bramer's diary.\n\nAdditional Information\n\nIn Print:\n\nBush, B. Conrad, compiler, Van Rensselaer Evringham, Corporal, Co.

According to records I have found, he collected a pension in 1897  application # 1187309. He enlisted December 13, 1861, in the town of Marcellus, Onondaga County. I would like to see him added to the list, please.\n\nElisha Veeder is one of those who did not enlist at the initial formation of the regiment, and consequently he is (as noted at the beginning of each roster) not included in the company rosters that I have on the site. He was, however, a member of the regiment. His entry on page 196 of the Annual Report of the Adjutant-General of the State of New York for the Year 1899, Serial #19; James B. Lyon, State Printer, Albany, N.Y.; 1900, reads as follows:\n\nVEEDER, ELISHA.Age, 23 years. Enlisted, December 13, 1861, at Marcellus; mustered in as private, Co. H, same date, to serve unexpired term; transferred to Co. G, December 14, 1862; mustered out with company, May 17, 1863, at Elmira, N.Y.\n\nFor information about several other members of the regiment who may not be listed in my company rosters see the various entries in the guest book.\n\nStill More\n\nSubject: Location of Tombstone of John Snyder, Co A\n\nOn July 25, 2005, I received the following e-mail from Shawn Parsons:\n\nMy name is Shawn Parsons, and I'm a re-enactor with the 149th NYSVI (4th Onondaga) out of Syracuse NY.\n\nWe held a living history this past weekend at the Salt Museum near Onondaga Lake Park. One of the staff mentioned that there was solitary tombstone he remembered seeing some years ago in a piece of woods off of Buckley Road which is a short drive from my house in Pennellville, NY. He remembered the name as John Snyder and thought he may have been a veteran of the 149th.\n\nOut of curiosity my wife and I drove out yesterday to take a look and found the tombstone. The inscription read:\n\nJohn Snyder\n\nInfantry\n\nCo A 12th Regiment NYV\n\nDied 1896\n\nAged 57 Yrs\n\nThe tombstone is lying flat on the ground about 30 yards from the road, surrounded by roadside debris. It's hard to tell if it is the final resting place of Mr. Snyder or if someone had removed the tombstone and dumped it by the road. I spoke with the owner of the property who said she would check to see if the abstract lists the name of Snyder as previous owners of the property.\n\nThe reason I'm informing you of this is that I'd like to find out if you have any information on the final resting place of John Snyder, and if it turns out that the tombstone has been reported missing to help get it back where it belongs. If it is the burial site of Mr. Snyder, then I'd like to inform you that the property has recently been zoned for commercial and the owner will be selling off the property. I'd like to make sure that Mr. Snyder's remains are properly moved to a more suitable and honorable location.\n\nI have no information about this subject. Perhaps some viewer does. How about it?\n\nA Photograph from the 12th Infantry\n\nIn December of 2000 Janet Noble White Gibbens, jwgibbens2@yahoo.com, a great-grandaughter of Edward Allen Noble of Company I, sent the accompanying picture to me all the way from Australia. Edward Noble may be the man on the right. The others remain unidentified. Quite possibly they are also from Company I. For more detail, see the biography of Edward Noble that Janet sent to me February 26, 2001.\n\nJanuary 24, 2003, Conrad Bush, Bushresear@aol.com, identified the man in the middle with his arm against the tree as 2nd Lt. Edward Drake of the 12th NY, who was later to become Captain of Company I.\n\nGuest Book\n\nPlease sign the guest book for the 12th New York Volunteer Infantry.\n\nSign View"
