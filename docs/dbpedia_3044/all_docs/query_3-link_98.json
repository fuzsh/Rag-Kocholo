The committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10 a.m., in room 2154, Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Tom Davis of Virginia (chairman of the committee) presiding. Present: Representatives Tom Davis of Virginia, Shays, McHugh, Souder, Schrock, Miller, Murphy, Blackburn, Waxman, Lantos, Maloney, Tierney, Watson, Van Hollen, Ruppersberger, and Norton. Staff present: David Marin, deputy staff director and director of communications; Keith Ausbrook, chief counsel; David Young, counsel; Robert Borden, counsel and parliamentarian; Drew Crockett, deputy director of communications; Grace Washbourne, professional staff member; Teresa Austin, chief clerk; Brien Beattie, deputy clerk; Corinne Zaccagnini, chief information officer; Kristin Amerling, minority deputy chief counsel; Karen Lightfoot, minority communications director and senior policy advisor; Anna Laitin, minority communications and policy assistant; Earley Green, minority chief clerk; Jean Gosa, minority assistant clerk; and Andrew Su, minority professional staff member. Mr. Shays [assuming Chair]. Good morning. A quorum being present, the Committee on Government Reform hearing entitled, ``Transforming the National Guard: Resourcing for Readiness,'' will come to order. Chairman Davis will be arriving shortly, but he asked me to open the hearing so we can get all the testimony in the record. Governor Pataki, we understand you have a tight schedule, and we appreciate your being here. I ask unanimous consent to allow the Governor to testify and answer questions after Mr. Waxman and I have made opening statements but before other Members do so. But if it's just Mr. Lantos and my colleague from Virginia, we probably could have all four of us do it. Without objection, so ordered. The committee convenes today to discuss important issues raised by plans to transform and modernize the National Guard to meet the demands of a growing set of domestic and global missions. We captioned the hearing Resourcing for Readiness, because Members need to know Guard units will be equipped and trained to perform both the Homeland Security and global defense tasks assigned them. In the past, the total force, the operational union of Active Duty and Reserve component units, didn't always add up. National Guard units too often languished at the end of the supply chain with limited training on hand-me-down equipment. At the national level, significant strides have been made reshaping military capabilities to meet an uncertain world of lethal threats at home and asymmetrical warfare overseas. But much more needs to be done to clarify the operational and physical implications of new military missions within the sovereign borders of the States, where National Guard members can be called to duty by both the Governor and the President. Federal mobilization of National Guard units can draw heavily from local first responder ranks, degrading domestic readiness. So the shape, size and mission of the National Guard of the future will have significant intergovernmental implications. Governors, county executives, mayors and hospital administrators are trying to build response capabilities and enhance preparedness without knowing who the Federal Government might bring or take away when disaster strikes. To train as they fight, Guard units have to take part in local and regional exercises. Equipment, interoperability standards and communication channels have to be established before the next attack is upon us. But National Guard civil support capabilities are not yet well integrated with the State and local response plans. When the battle lines stretch from Baghdad to Bridgeport, from Kandahar to Kinderhook, new approaches are needed to assure the National Guard is ready to confront the threat at home and abroad. Building on rich traditions that predate our constitution, the citizens militia that are the National Guard today bring awe inspiring patriotism and skill to their work and our common defense. They deserve to know they will have the equipment and training they need to succeed in their 21st century mission. At this time, the Chair recognizes the Ranking Member of the full committee, Mr. Waxman, for his opening statement. [The prepared statement of Hon. Christopher Shays follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T5597.001 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T5597.002 Mr. Waxman. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I want to thank you for holding this hearing. I am pleased that the committee has been focusing attention on the increasing demands facing our National Guard members. We must do everything we can to ensure that the National Guard can meet its myriad responsibilities without overburdening the dedicated and brave Guard members who risk their lives to serve. For over 350 years, our country has looked to the National Guard to provide security within our borders and assist in local disaster relief. But in the past few years, Guard members have been activated for Federal duties with increasing frequency and the Guard's responsibilities have been growing exponentially. The shift from an essentially Reserve role to active participation in the Nation's security forces has placed tremendous strains on the National Guard system. We in Congress have heard countless stories about problems Guard soldiers have experienced, from poor training to inferior equipment and health care, to delays in pay, to the negative effects of long deployments. We can't keep expecting these men and women to be everywhere and to serve indefinitely. We need direction and forethought from our military and State leaders, and a clear plan that considers the increasing burdens facing the National Guard. To this end, I support the efforts of General Blum and his counterparts at the Department of Defense and Department of Homeland Security to formulate a plan for restructuring the National Guard. I look forward to hearing more from today's witnesses about this plan and any other steps necessary to assure that the National Guard is best equipped to fulfill its important duties within and outside our Nation's borders. Mr. Shays. Thank you. We're going to go right to the witness, but we have a senior member, Mr. Lantos, and Mr. McHugh, who's from New York. I guess what I would do is just say that the Governor has to leave by 11 a.m., so it would make sense to go to his testimony. Is there anyone who would just like to make a short comment? Mr. McHugh. Mr. McHugh. I will be very, very brief, and I certainly want to add my words of welcome and note to my fellow committee members, as I suspect they totally understand, that the reason the Governor is here is, this Governor is a lot of very great things, known to New Yorkers and known, particularly after September 11th, to every American. But one of the things he is most of all is an amazing leader of the New York National Guard. Through his initiatives and his programs New York State National Guard receives support and benefits that are really second to none in this Nation. We have before us a gentleman who can help us understand a great deal about the demands on the Guard here and the new reality of the 21st century, but also can teach us a great deal about what other States might do to have as effective an organization. So Governor, welcome, it's good to see you again. Governor Pataki. Thank you. Mr. Shays. The Chair would recognize Mr. Lantos and then hope that we could go to Governor Pataki. Mr. Lantos, you have the floor. Mr. Lantos. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm particularly delighted to welcome my good friend, Governor Pataki. I am particularly pleased that he is testifying today because his State is a perfect illustration of the wisdom of the legislation I introduced, namely, preventing National Guardsmen and Guardswomen from incurring severe financial losses and their families incurring severe financial hardships as they are activated. The State of New York provides the differential between the military pay and the former civilian pay. I want to commend the Governor for his State's action along this line. When it comes time to question him, I will ask him what the cost of this has been for the State of New York, whether it has entailed additional appropriations, and what in his judgment has been the impact on morale. New York State is leading by giving us an example of how to handle this problem. And it's long overdue that the administration drop its opposition to what is a common sense, singularly non-partisan approach to a severe issue of recruitment and retention. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Shays. I thank the gentleman. Mr. Pataki, Governor, as you may know, it is our practice to swear in all our witnesses, being that this is an investigative committee. I would ask you to stand and raise your right hand. [Witness sworn.] Governor Pataki. I do. Mr. Shays. Thank you so much, Governor. You have the floor, and we welcome you and we know you have a very busy schedule. Thank you for honoring us. STATEMENT OF GEORGE E. PATAKI, GOVERNOR, STATE OF NEW YORK Governor Pataki. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and to Congressman Lantos and Congressman McHugh and the other Members, thank you all for having me before you this morning, and for the opportunity to speak on this important subject. At no time in America's history has the National Guard played so critical role in both the security of our homeland and in our Nation's military objectives overseas. In today's world, the notion of the traditional citizen soldier, training 1 weekend a month and 2 weeks a year for a war that might never occur is a thing of the past. Our troops are actively engaged on the front lines, supporting both our State's efforts to keep New York safe at home and our Nation's efforts to combat terror abroad. In February, I had the great privilege of joining five other Governors from across the Nation on a historic bipartisan mission to visit our troops in Iraq. I was inspired by the tremendous spirit, professionalism and resolve of each and every one of the soldiers I met. They understand the mission before them and why we must seize the opportunity to break the back of terror so that our children and their children can live in freedom. The trip also reinforced just how involved and essential the role of our National Guard troops is to our Nation's mission. Each day, we flew in and out of Iraq from Amman, Jordan. It was National Guard soldiers who piloted us each way. And everywhere I went, I met with National Guard soldiers from New York and from the other States. As we speak this morning, more than 3,700 of the New York National Guard members are currently on Active Duty, supporting State security missions at home, Federal security missions under Operation Mobile Eagle and overseas military operations as part of Operational Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom. Thousands more are engaged in regularly scheduled training and operational requirements around the State, the Nation and the world. From riflemen to fighter pilots, in the turrets of Humvees and in the huge bellies of C5 Galaxies, New York National Guard soldiers and airmen are providing a historic level of support to the Coalition forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. From a total force perspective, the Guard has never played a more vital role in major combat operations. What truly sets the Guard apart, however, is its dual roles. Our Guardsmen and women are not just part time members of our Nation's military forces, they are our State's primary emergency response force, providing support to their communities and to civil authorities and first responders throughout the State. At no time in New York's history was this aspect of the National Guard's role more evident than on September 11, 2001. Within hours of the attacks on the World Tarde Center, 1,500 New York National Guard troops from units within New York City had reported to duty. Another 1,500 units from upstate New York were en route. In less than 24 hours after the attacks, over 8,000 New York National Guard soldiers and airmen were on Active Duty supporting New York State's security needs. These troops provided not just a calming presence on the streets of New York during very unsettling times, they provided New York's first responders with critical perimeter security support, refueling for civil emergency vehicles, emergency lighting, power generation, communications, emergency transportation, engineering assets and other logistical support. In the days, weeks and months that followed, our National Guard force would assume mission and responsibilities within New York State that never could have been imagined by previous generations of National Guard soldiers. Today, hundreds of New York Army National Guard soldiers are serving on State Active Duty as part of Task Force Empire Shield. These soldiers support security operations at New York's major rail stations and nuclear power facilities, missions that have been ongoing every day since September 11th. During times that warrant an even higher elevation of the threat level, the National Guard's Task Force Empire Shield is integrated into Main Shield, the State's multi-agency joint security task force, headed by the New York State Office of Public Security. In addition, a civil support team for weapons of mass destruction is on call 24 hours a day to respond to incidents, known or suspect, to involve nuclear, biological or chemical weapons. We continue to deploy our CST, to provide proactive precautionary monitoring at major public events and strategic locations throughout the city and State of New York. Soon our CST will play an instrumental role in the stand-up of a new type of National Guard capability, a chemical, biological, radioactive, nuclear and explosive, or CBRNE, enhanced response force. This joint National Guard task force will integrate CST with an enhanced medical company possessing robust determination and treatment capabilities, engineering assets specializing in search and rescue, and specially trained combat units capable of supporting civilian law enforcement. Even with all of these added responsibilities and missions, the New York National Guard remains our State's primary emergency response force. As New York's Governor, I've called upon New York's Guard more than any other Governor in our State's history. Each time they responded heroically and met every mission asked of them, particularly in times of crisis. The attack on the World Trade Center, 8 natural disasters, 4 plane crashes, 11 crippling blizzards, 2 major wildfires, a statewide blackout and now of course, the threat of global terror. National Guard Bureau Chief Lieutenant General Blum is working in Washington to transform the Guard into a modern, highly relevant and appropriately structured force, capable of combating the asymmetrical threat of terror at home and terror threat abroad. I salute General Blum's efforts to enhance and modernize the Guard's mission, while preserving both its relevance to the Department of Defense and the capabilities it provides to the Governors. As State Commander in Chief of one of the largest Guard forces in the Nation, I'm encouraged by General Blum's vision and his appreciation of the Guard's dual role and the necessity of preserving that role. General Blum is committed to enhancing the National Guard's role as an active participant in the Nation's military force and he aims to preserve and enhance the National Guard's State role simultaneously. As we work to transform the U.S. military, and specifically the National Guard, it's critical to ensure that the Governors who are most intimately familiar with and better understand their unique needs retain the ability and the authority to deploy the National Guard troops that best meet those needs. General Blum's transformation plan would allow for a generous National Guard contribution to Federal missions at home and abroad, and ensure that at least 50 to 75 percent of a State's National Guard troops remain available for State Active Duty. His model shows real commitment to the traditional dual roles of the National Guard, and is one I strongly support. When President Bush gave authorization to deploy troops to airports across the Nation after the September 11th attacks, New York was of course among the first to respond. Because this mission was a Title 32 status, where troops are paid federally but remained under their State's command and control, rather than in Title 10 status, where they would have served under the Active Duty Army, we were able to meet this requirements quickly, smoothly and with the troops best suited for the task. From an operational standpoint, this approach makes the most sense and is consistent with General Blum's innovative thinking on this matter. We need to assure that troops activated under Title 32 status remain under the authority and control of the State's Governor to ensure maximum flexibility and effective deployment. General Blum's plan promises to bring predictability and regularity to Federal deployment of National Guard units. A full spectrum availability model would call for one Federal Title 10 Army Guard deployment every 6 years and one Air Guard rotation every 15 months. This will distribute the burden equally among States and units and provide predictability and ample planning time for both unit commanders, their individual troops and their families. Having spoken directly with families of deployed troops across New York, and having talked with troops on the ground during my trip to Iraq in February, I can tell you that General Blum's plan is not only welcome, but it is urgently necessary. In today's post-September 11th climate, we are asking more from our National Guard troops than ever before. In New York, we strongly believe it is incumbent upon our government to do more for our troops than ever before. No State in the Nation is doing more than New York to support our troops and their families. Last year, I was proud to propose and sign a historic measure called the Patriot Plan into law. The Patriot Plan, without question, provides the most comprehensive package of protections and benefits in the Nation to assist New York's military personnel and their families. This historic package of benefits and protections for deployed New York National Guard and Reserve troops was a recognition that the National Guard, like the rest of the U.S. military, cannot hope to continue its mission without these brave men and women who join its ranks. The Patriot Plan has 28 different benefit packages for our Guardsmen, including, and I will just briefly summarize, because I know it's a long hearing, including providing the difference between a State employee's pay and their Active Duty compensation; providing free tuition for the children and families of National Guard members who are killed or seriously injured in defending our freedom, and a number of other benefits as well. Quite simply, we have two basic roles here. One is to understand the importance of the State mission that the Guard plays as we call upon it for enhanced Federal activity, and second, the sacrifice that the families have to make while their loved ones are away. To the extent we can provide additional benefits, that's what we need to make sure the Guard remains strong and effective. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Governor Pataki follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T5597.003 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T5597.004 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T5597.005 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T5597.006 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T5597.007 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T5597.008 Mr. Shays. Thank you for a very helpful statement, Governor. We have a number of people, we'll do the 5-minute rule, we're going to go with Mr. Schrock then Mr. Waxman if he returns. Then Mr. McHugh and Mr. Lantos. I'd love it if other Members--if you're able to stay beyond 11 a.m., it would be great, but let's give it a shot. Mr. Schrock. Mr. Schrock. Thank you. Thank you, Governor, for being here, thank you for your testimony, thank you for going to Iraq. I've been to Iraq and Afghanistan a few times, and whether they're Guard, whether they're Reserves or Active Duty forces, they all work together as one cohesive unit. That's a wonderful thing. You talked about the dual role. I just have one question I'm going to ask. Is there a benefit to, in your opinion, redefining the role of the National Guard in responding to homeland security concerns? In looking back at the last 2\\1/2\\ years, what have you found are the major stumbling blocks to helping the Guard respond to their homeland security challenges in your State? Do we need to redefine the authorities of the State Governors and the adjutant generals? Governor Pataki. In our State, we have had, I hate to use the word, but virtually seamless efforts to respond to any homeland security problems within New York State. We have a well thought out plan and we're able to implement that plan. And the fact that the adjutant general, the local commanders can determine what force to use for a particular mission has been enormously helpful. I'll just give you one example. When we call on National Guard troops to perform a particular mission that doesn't require a skill set, we ask for volunteers so that we minimize the disruption in these citizens soldiers' lives. We couldn't do that if they were federally controlled, so we're very pleased with the response of the Guard and the ability to command and control the Guard within the State. Mr. Schrock. You think it works fine, then? Governor Pataki. Within our State, it works very well. The area of concern that we all have, I think, is to make sure that the homeland security role within the States under the command and control of the Governors is understood as a critical mission of the Guard as they assume a more important Federal role, and that the sacrifice that the families make is understood, and we do what we can to help them on every different front. Mr. Schrock. Great. Thank you. I yield back, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Shays. Mr. Lantos, you can now question Mr. Pataki. Mr. Lantos. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Governor, I again want to commend you for your leadership on this whole, complex issue. I'd like to zero in on the legislation I introduced almost a year ago. I have to admit that I find it very disturbing when I don't understand the source of the opposition or the logic behind the opposition. I know you will be able to help me. In New York State, you recognize the obvious, that at a time of war, we must have if not equality of sacrifice, because we cannot attain that, but we must have an attempt at sharing sacrifice. To place on the families of activated National Guard people tremendous financial burdens, financial strains of major proportion, people losing their homes because they cannot pay their mortgage, children discontinuing their college education because the parents can't pay tuition. It makes eminently good sense not to impose on an activated National Guardsman or woman an additional financial burden. In New York, you're doing this, and I want to congratulate you. May I ask your general judgment about the philosophy behind my legislation, namely preventing financial losses for people who are already called upon to make a major personal sacrifice? Governor Pataki. Congressman, of course I agree with the need that we have, not just at the State level but at the Federal level to understand the economic impact this has on a citizen soldier who has been activated. It's very different from a career professional military person who understands the pay scale and accepts that pay scale as part of their career determination. But citizen soldiers too often will see their income dramatically reduced. Now, how you deal with that, I think you can do it in many different fronts. In fact, Congress first began to respond to that concern with the Soldiers and Sailors Relief Act that was passed back during World War II. But obviously, circumstances have changed dramatically since World War II. So I think there are a number of different approaches. One is to provide additional benefits in the form of salary enhancement or making up the gap when someone suffers a significant diminution of earnings. Another is to make sure that we do cap interest rates. I know the Soldiers and Sailors Relief Act does that at 6 percent. Given the historically low interest rates now, perhaps they could be lowered even more. Our plan not only provides to make up that salary differential, but as an example, if a young man or young woman goes out and leases an SUV that they use and then they get called to Active Duty, we allow them to cancel that lease, so that the don't have any penalty at all. If you're enrolled in school and you're activated, we require that school to give the tuition back and the fees back to the portion of the semester they were there and to keep that slot open for when they come back. So there are a whole gamut of benefits, including salary enhancements, that we are looking to do at the State level, and I think it is appropriate to do at the Federal level as well. Congressman, just one point, though, and this is something where I'm commenting from afar because I'm not a part of the Federal military chain of command. But one of the important things we cannot do is have a differential among those in the Guard so that people are reluctant to call up a particular unit because of the additional cost factor if that skill set is needed. So I don't know if that is in fact a relevant consideration as your legislation and others is considered, but it's just something that we have to be able to call upon the people we need with the skills we need without concern for the economic cost to the country, we have to be concerned about the economic impact on those soldiers and sailors and their families. Mr. Lantos. Governor, if I may pursue this for one more moment, obviously we all know that we face serious problems of re-enlistment, retention, enlistment, given the new nature of the global struggle we are engaged in. In view of that fact, do you view the New York program as a success? Governor Pataki. The New York program is a success. As I indicated earlier, one of the first things we did, well before September 11th, we created a program where if you enlist in the National Guard, you get free tuition at our State or city universities or an equivalent in a private or parochial. And that had a very dramatic impact on recruitment. Now we have seen, since September 11th and since the operations overseas, recruitment holding steady, and in fact a little bit increased over the last couple of months. We are concerned about retention, as thousands of our National Guard troops come back. It's too soon to tell, but one significant enhancement of the benefit package for our National Guard troops that we believe would help with both recruitment and retention would be to provide health benefits to those who enlist in the National Guard. It's something that they would be able to access under the Federal program, and it would have an enormous help to both encourage enlistment in the first case and retention of those who are coming back. Mr. Lantos. I want to thank you, Governor, and want to commend you for your achievement. Governor Pataki. Thank you very much, Congressman. Mr. Shays. Thank you. Mr. McHugh. Mr. McHugh. Thank you. Again, Governor, welcome. Always good to see you. My friend from California brings up a serious consideration, and from my other perspective as the chairman of the Personnel Subcommittee on Armed Services, I commend him for his concern and for his leadership on it. I was pleased to hear your response, Governor, and the program you've initiated, that I tried to acknowledge and praise in my opening comments. Obviously I'm very familiar with it. Again, God bless you for that insight and that leadership. As I think your response indicated, there's a whole range of things that can and probably should be done in terms of benefit packages for the Guard, for the Reserve component in general that can show both our appreciation and also our concern about retention and recruitment, and you have. As my friend from California suggested, you're a natural leader on that. But Mr. Lantos mentioned the administration's opposition, and I think technically that's true. But I think it's important just to note for the record that the military service is opposed to that initiative as well, because of their concern about the morale impact of placing two service members in this new era, one active and the other Guard and Reserve, where they're doing the same job and taking the same bullets and sitting in the same foxhole and being paid at different levels. Mr. Lantos. Will my friend yield for just a second? Mr. McHugh. I will in just a moment. I'm not sure that concern is justified. There have been attempts in the past to try to divide pay differentials that have failed and insurance policies that were run through Gulf war one. We are aggressively searching for a way in which we can help that one-third, in fact about one-third of the Guard and Reserve that have deployed actually lose money, about a third stay the same and about the other third actually make some money, because it is a legitimate point. But it has proven to be far more complex here at the congressional level, and at the Washington level, than just passing the bill to mandate it. With that, I'd be happy to yield to my friend from California. Mr. Lantos. I will just make one quick point, and thank my good friend for yielding. I find a profound inconsistency in the administration's opposition while at the same time the administration is praising private employers for maintaining salary levels of activated people. They can't have it both ways. They can't praise a company for doing exactly what my legislation is calling for while opposing the legislation. Mr. McHugh. Well---- Mr. Lantos. That's profoundly inconsistent. Mr. McHugh. Reclaiming my time, I understand the gentleman's point. But as I tried to note, maybe I wasn't clear enough, there is a distinction between the administration concerns about the gentleman's proposal, and they're praising private employers and the military opposition, I was referring to the military's concern, I'm not de-legitimizing the gentleman's point, I just want him to know we're trying to work through that. That having been said, Governor---- Governor Pataki. It's a very unpleasant debate, and I'm used to being in the middle of it. Mr. McHugh. Well, we appreciate it, and if you weren't so darned foresighted on this, it wouldn't have been a problem. But it raises a very serious point, and we need to deal with it, and we thank you for drawing our attention to it. I was going to ask you about recruitment and retention, because that does become important in the Reserve components, and General Blum was kind enough to stop by my office not so very long ago and talk about the discussions he had with you and some of the other Governors with respect to that meeting to retain both the control of those forces through his Title 32 provision, but also the need to ensure you have sufficient manpower, personpower, I guess, in this day and age, to meet those kinds of emergencies and demands that are common to someone who's got a few nuclear power plants in his district and has had all those snow storms you spoke about and the ice storm and others for the National Guard that you deployed and activated came and helped. That's something we want to see happen. So you are, as I understand your comments, at least at the moment encouraged if not optimistic that General Blum is in the right direction, and that will be helpful in ensuring that you have as a Governor what you need. Governor Pataki. Yes, I think General Blum has outlined a very sound strategy that not only works from a Federal force perspective but works from the standpoint of the Governors, their Guards and the Guard families. One of the important elements is to have some predictability and some warning as to when you're going to be called for Federal duty. After September 11th, obviously we were all starting an era that we had not anticipated and could not, if we have tried, prepared for. It was just very different to see this type of attack upon our soil against civilians. So when some of our Guard components were activated for Federal duty, they hadn't been prepared, either as a family or militarily to respond. And it took some time. But that is a thing of the past, I honestly believe that. Right now we are seeing some, we get the advance notice, the units are on a list and they do have the training, the preparation and when they're called to duty, they are called for a mission as opposed to being called and then ending up waiting, which happened shortly after September 11th quite a bit. So I'm very pleased with the Federal action in dealing with, to the extent they can, predictability, notification, training, and equipment is prevailing. Congressman, let me just say for a moment, you and I have been to Fort Drum together a number of times. The Tenth Mountain Division, of course, is headquartered there. They have played a critical role in Afghanistan and in the entire war against terrorism. You've done a tremendous job in making sure that facility and that great unit is one of the finest, if not the finest in the world. Mr. McHugh. Thank you. I yield back. Mr. Shays. I thank the gentleman. We're going to go to Mr. Ruppersberger then Mrs. Miller and Mr. Tierney and Mrs. Blackburn. Mr. Ruppersberger. Governor, thank you. First, having a job like yours and managing a lot of issues you have to deal with, you do a great job. Governor Pataki. Thank you. Mr. Ruppersberger. When I was in Iraq, it was where you talked with the troops and I think one of the biggest issues with the National Guard and Reserves too were what was happening when they got back to their home life and with their families and jobs. I think really, you call it the Patriot Plan, it's an admirable plan and probably has given a lot of comfort to those individuals. We still have a long way to go, and there are a lot of problems when our men and women come back, and we'll have to face that down the road. To begin with, the issue of recruitment, because we do have a dual role, and that dual role, I'm sure, will continue on for many years to come, based on what's happening in the world today. Where does New York stand as far as recruitment of National Guard? What is your plan? Governor Pataki. We have, as I indicated, we have recruitment levels not just remain the same so that we can maintain our current force level, it has actually gone up a little bit over the course of the past few months. We had a terrible record in the early and mid 1990's in recruitment. But one of the programs, we began a number of things. One was the free tuition thing. That had an enormous impact on young people, to understand that by serving their State and their country they could at the same time get education without any charge. It dramatically improved recruitment. We also began to use the norm, so that they had constructive missions, not just in response to emergencies, whether it was TWA 800 or the ice storm in Congressman McHugh's district or some of the other disasters, but we created something called Guard Help where they would proactively work with communities. Just one example in the south Bronx, the Bronx River was a needed entity, it's a wonderful water body where you had truck bodies and debris blocking the stream. We brought in a Guard engineering crew to work with the community and clean it out. So they had a mission where they were helping their communities, they had a sense of purpose as well as immense benefits. It worked extremely well, we're pleased with the recruitment level that continues now. Our concern, as I indicated, is with the troops coming back, what the retention rate will be. We just don't know, because it's too soon. Mr. Ruppersberger. How about the issue of retention? Governor Pataki. We don't know, we're not sure. We're hopeful, because most of our National Guard troops in Iraq have gotten back within the last weeks. I believe there's a 90 day period when they come back where they make a determination. So we haven't seen people saying yes or no yet. Anecdotally we're hopeful, but it's too soon to really say. Having said that, it's always better to retain more. And if we could enhance the National Guard by providing health care benefits, military Federal health care benefits for someone who enrolls in the National Guard, it would help on both levels. It would help with recruitment because it would be another benefit and reason for someone to choose to serve. And when the soldiers came back, it would help with retention because they would have a significant benefit they might not have in civilian life. Mr. Ruppersberger. That would be excellent. It's amazing the patriotism that the National Guard and Reserve in the United States and abroad and Iraq have at this point. To get to another issue as far as local government is concerned, you have a lot of your first responders, especially in your volunteer fire and paramedics, that have been called to service. And it's causing a problem with some of the stations that have to, at least in my State, the State of Maryland. What impact is that having on your State? Governor Pataki. It has had an impact, a significant percentage of our National Guard are first responders. And a lot of them are police officers and corrections officers. Before we passed the Patriot Plan, we listened to the local governments. And they said, well, we're losing three of our police officers, a small town in upstate New York. And we don't want to hire new ones, because they'll be coming back. So what we did as part of our plan is in that law now, local governments can bring back retirees to fill a position of someone who has been activated to National Guard duty. It's a very intelligent program. A retired firefighter, retired police officer, someone from that community gets activated, their local government doesn't want to train somebody else, knowing that this person will be returning in a year, so they can bring back someone. So we have had the problem, this is one of the ways we've looked to deal with it. Mr. Ruppersberger. OK, thank you. [The prepared statement of Hon. C.A. Dutch Ruppersberger follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T5597.013 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T5597.014 Mr. Shays. Thank you. The Chair would like to recognize Mrs. Miller. Mrs. Miller. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Governor, thank you so much for being here today. I must say that watching you after the absolutely horrific attacks on our Nation on September 11, we all look to you as the Nation's Governor, quite frankly, and your leadership that you demonstrated at that time has really been very significant. We certainly appreciate your being here today and your comments. I share your concern about retention with the National Guard. I actually have a National Guard base in my district in Michigan, which has been sort of the staging area for our, all of the midwest, frankly, for many of the Guard and Reserve components that have deployed for Afghanistan, Iraq, Uzbekistan, what have you. It's interesting, actually over 30 percent now of all our troops in theater are National Guard or Reserve. So they really, as you mentioned in the total force concept, are such a critical component of all that. I would just make one comment, we talked about retention. One of our Guard units, the Michigan Red Devils, who fly F-15s, the 107th is over in Iraq right now. When they deployed, they had more volunteers than they actually could accommodate, and I'm sure that is not unique throughout the Nation. But my question, I think, Governor, to you would go more to your State plan. As you're aware, obviously, all the different States are preparing their individual risk assessment plan for the Department of Homeland Security. And how did you find in your State the cooperation from your various units? Did you task that force principally to--did you call it New York's Public Security Force or your State Police? Did they cooperate with the National Guard? Governor Pataki. We had an emergency management office, SEMO, the State Emergency Management Office, that responded to the national disasters and plane crashes and things of that nature. But after September 11th, we created a whole new bureau, the Office of Public Security. We gave them oversight over all the different elements, including the National Guard, so we would have coordination. So we don't have the National Guard running our homeland security operation in New York State, we have an entity, because we have to integrate not just National Guard, but State Police, New York City Police Department, the finest in the world, first responders from around the State. And one of the key elements is integrating the health department, so we can have instantaneous, not instantaneous, but within minutes, the ability to determine if there is an outbreak of a particular illness or where experts are to respond. So we created this entity, the National Guard plays a critical role within that entity, but I wouldn't say a disproportionate role. The State police, the health department, local officials are all of them working together. Mrs. Miller. Just one other question. As all of us are trying to make sure that we do get the necessary resources into our respective States, the first responders, what have you, did you share your State plan with your congressional delegation or did you have any input---- Governor Pataki. We have worked closely with the congressional delegation. I don't know that we sat down and formally said, this is what we're doing. But we did give them parameters and also of course the request for Federal assistance. Because this is an extraordinary expense, and in New York now, we're at level yellow, it's still costing us tens of millions of dollars for, as Congressman McHugh was indicating, enhanced security at the nuclear power plants in his district, train stations, bridges, tunnels, other very sensitive areas. Mrs. Miller. I see. Thank you very much, and again, thank you for your testimony today and your service to the State and the Nation. Governor Pataki. Thank you. Mr. Shays. Thank you. Mr. Tierney, you have the floor. Mr. Tierney. Governor, thank you for coming here today and for your testimony. In Massachusetts, one of the comments that some of our officers were making was about the armories, the physical assets that the Guard has. In New York, do you feel all your physical assets are being used to their maximum potential? If they are, what exactly are you doing with them other than just the monthly training regimen that's going no, and if you're not, what do you think they might be used for? Governor Pataki. First, let me say from an equipment standpoint, I know that question has been raised. All of our Guard troops that have been deployed overseas were very pleased with the level of material and equipment they've been provided. And I think there's been dramatic improvement over the course of the past couple of years in making sure that the necessary equipment and supplies that we need, not just for overseas but also domestically, are available. With respect to the utilization of the resources, General McGuire, our Adjutant General, I'm unaware that we have any shortages or stockpiles. The General reminded me that things like our engineering battalions that haven't been deployed we're using as things like the Guard health program, so that we are utilizing those assets on an ongoing basis in a way that is constructive to the troops, because it gives them experience and training and a sense of mission and helps with the local communities as well. So if you're creative, we've got the equipment, we're going to use it. Mr. Tierney. Beyond equipment, the armories themselves, the buildings, structures. Are you maximizing the use of those and how? Governor Pataki. We have surplus armories, because the size of the force has, since over 100, in some cases 150 years ago when these armories were constructed, there are surplus armories. But what we've done, as we have identified those that no longer serve a military purpose, we've turned them over to community groups, we've converted them into recreational centers, or community centers, we've sold them off to private entities. They still serve a very important function. The evening of September 11th, the armory on 23rd Street in lower Manhattan served as the family command center where family members would go for information. So we want to make sure we maintain sufficient armory capability around the State in case there's a call on them for some emergency service. To the extent we have surplus armories, we have disposed or turned over to communities a large number of them. Mr. Tierney. Thank you. I yield back, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Tom Davis [assuming Chair]. Thank you very much. Governor, I apologize for being late. We are so happy to have you here today to talk about the job you're doing there. You have a unique perspective in New York, of course, being the epicenter of September 11. We appreciate it. I'm going to defer my opening statement so we can get to members' questions. Usually we have one or two Members in this hearing, so on a day the House is not voting, there's not a lot of interest in what you have to say, and we appreciate your being here. Governor Pataki. Thank you for having me, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Tom Davis. Mrs. Blackburn. Mrs. Blackburn. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and Governor, thank you so much for taking the time to be here and to talk with us. Those of us that have large numbers of National Guard families in our districts and in our States are very concerned and very interested in what we're going to do as we look at the National Guard going forward, how they integrate into the Active Duty. The issues you've mentioned of predictability, readiness, skills, whether it's the equipment, the training, the help, the quality of life issues for the families, and I commend you for your Patriot Plan and the way that does address those quality of life and recruitment and retention issues. I'm going to roll my three questions into one for the sake of conserving time, and ask you to respond to those. Because I know you all had significant Guard deployments like we are having in Tennessee, with our Guard being down, and did those Guard deployments affect your ability to respond to State missions or disasters, or homeland security needs. And then as you looked at your State plans, did you build a compact with surrounding States to assist you and back you up if there were to be a need for those resources. And the third part is, how did you as a State reimburse the Guard for any homeland security missions that they may have performed for you? Governor Pataki. That brings up three very important questions. First, with respect to the Federal deployment, it has never jeopardized our ability to respond or be active status to protect the State of New York against any possible attack. As I indicated, right now there are probably 3,700 New York Guards troops that are serving a Federal mission, hundreds more serving a State mission. But we have 17,000 plus the Naval militia and the New York Guard. So I don't believe, other than September 12th and a few weeks after that, there are still units that have not been called upon because of their unique skill sets. So we have not been stretched too thin, to use that term. And General Blum and the Federal officials have been very, very careful to work closely with our command structure to make sure that the calls they have made are consistent with our need to protect ourself. Second, with respect to compacts with surrounding States, of course, we are a part of EMAC, the Emergency Management Assistance Compact, with a number of other States. That was very helpful right after September 11th, when emergency teams from other States came to New York and they had the ability to function within New York State free of any constraints they may have had because they were not within their home State. We also have entered into, I assigned Executive orders, I'll just give you one example, authorizing Connecticut and the New Jersey State police and law enforcement officials to have jurisdiction on the trains between New York and Connecticut and New York and New Jersey. When we're at level orange and at other times that we don't discuss, we have significant additional support and security on the commuter trains, in addition to on the subway lines. The commuter lines run not just within New York State but into New Jersey and Connecticut. And the Governors of Connecticut and New Jersey have placed their troopers where we would have jurisdiction of our troopers on the trains in Connecticut and they would have jurisdiction within Penn Station or Grand Central Station. And that has worked very well. And we're continuing to work on a regional concept of support, particularly information sharing. We're going to be moving forward on the intelligence and information sharing with some specific initiatives over the course of the next few weeks. Mrs. Blackburn. Thank you, sir. We appreciate your work and appreciate your time here very much. [The prepared statement of Hon. Marsha Blackburn follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T5597.009 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T5597.010 Governor Pataki. Thank you. Chairman Tom Davis. Thank you. Mr. Van Hollen. Mr. Van Hollen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, Governor, for your leadership on these many issues. I also had the opportunity to travel to Iraq in February on a trip that was led by the chairman of this committee, and had the opportunity to talk to many of our National Guardsmen and women there. I must say I found their morale was high, that they were proud of the service they were doing. They also, though, were lied, that the term, that the time for their tour of duty, they took that seriously as it was given to them and many of them were discouraged by the fact that their tours were extended beyond the time they had been originally informed. Obviously you have a hardship on families back home as well as them. So I think it's important that we work this out so we can provide greater predictability both to the men and women who are serving overseas but also to their families back home. I do appreciate what you've done in New York to relieve those burdens. I want to ask quickly, if there's a member of the New York State government who is deployed overseas, in addition to paying the pay gap, you also guarantee their position will be held open when they return, is that right? Governor Pataki. That's correct. We hold their position open. Mr. Van Hollen. And a number of States have done this, my home State of Maryland has done this. Their experience has been that they are able to cover this pay gap without having to request additional appropriations, that those agencies have been able to fill, meet those demands without having a lot of additional cost. Is that your experience? Governor Pataki. That has been our experience. But I just want to clarify something in response to what Congressman Lantos said earlier. We provide the pay gap when you are a State employee. We did not mandate that for local governments and we do not do that for private employers. So if you are a State employee, we work with the public employee unions, we provide that pay gap, we hold the slot open. And we've been able to minimize the fiscal impact to the State of that particular benefit. Mr. Van Hollen. Right. I just think what you've done is a good model for what we can be doing at the Federal level with respect to Federal employees, as Congressman Lantos has suggested. I think we can do it with minimal impact on the budget. Let me ask you, because a lot of States are facing multiple demands on the National Guards people as you suggest. Do we have, this function where the Guards serve within the States to respond to emergencies now more and more to homeland security demands, at the same time we have many being deployed overseas. Have you encountered any difficulties in terms of the competing demands on the same resources and when those competing demands occur, which take precedence? How do you decide? Governor Pataki. We really have not seen that, because General Blum, as I indicated, has been very, very cooperative in working with our command structure, General McGuire and the others, as the New York members of the Guard are deployed for a Federal mission. So we haven't seen that. There is one area where we are requesting additional help, and that's the civil support team, which has the ability, the high tech equipment, to not just respond but to monitor for chemical, biological or radiological weapons. We only have one of those teams. It hasn't been called upon for Federal service, but we call upon it regularly to monitor and to proactively protect. That is one area where we would very much like the authorization to have a second civil support team that would allow us to enhance that capability and not keep relying on that one unit. Mr. Van Hollen. Thank you. And thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Tom Davis. I think the time has come, you said 11 o'clock, and we will let you go at 11. I appreciate it very much, for what you've been able to add to this. We may get back to you with some ideas. This has been very, very helpful for us and we appreciate it. Governor Pataki. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. It's been an honor to testify before the committee. What you're doing is extremely important and I have no doubt you will do it extremely well. Thank you very much. Chairman Tom Davis. Thank you very much. We will have a 3 or 4 minute recess as we go to our next panel. [Recess.] Chairman Tom Davis. We're going to move to our second panel of witnesses, and I want to thank you all for taking time from your busy schedules to appear today. I think you've heard Governor Pataki from the back. We have today the Honorable Paul McHale, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Homeland Security and a former Member of this body. Paul, welcome back in a different role here, but it's good to have you here. The Honorable Thomas F. Hall, the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Reserve Affairs; Lieutenant General H. Steven Blum, the Chief of the National Guard Bureau; and Major General John Love, the Special Assistant to the Combatant Commander for National Guard Affairs, U.S. Northern Command. It is the policy of this committee that all witnesses be sworn before you testify, so if you would rise with me and raise your right hands. [Witnesses sworn.] Chairman Tom Davis. Thank you very much. Members deferred opening statements, and I would just put my opening statement into the record, and we'll ask unanimous consent that Members put their statements into the record. [The prepared statement of Chairman Tom Davis follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T5597.011 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T5597.012 Chairman Tom Davis. I do recognize Mr. Schrock. Do you want to wait? We'll go through this panel and then go to Mr. Schrock's questioning. Mr. Secretary, welcome back. It's good to have you here. I know you've worked hard on this and thanks for being here. STATEMENT OF PAUL MCHALE, ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF DEFENSE FOR HOMELAND SECURITY, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE; THOMAS F. HALL, ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF DEFENSE FOR RESERVE AFFAIRS, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF AFFAIRS; LIEUTENANT GENERAL H. STEVEN BLUM, CHIEF, NATIONAL GUARD BUREAU; AND MAJOR GENERAL JOHN A. LOVE, SPECIAL ASSISTANT TO COMBATANT COMMANDER FOR NATIONAL GUARD AFFAIRS, U.S. NORTHERN COMMAND Mr. McHale. Mr. Chairman, it's good to be back. Mr. Chairman and distinguished members of the committee, it is an honor and a privilege to appear before this body. To be entrusted with national security responsibilities at any time, but especially at this point in our country's history, it is a solemn and sacred duty. From past experience, I fully appreciate your oversight obligations pursuant to Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution, although I have to tell you it's a little more challenging on this side of the table than it was when I sat up there and asked the questions. My goal today is to provide the committee with a candid, accurate assessment of our current homeland defense capabilities and to describe emerging DOD mission requirements with particular emphasis on Reserve component capabilities. Because I have submitted my formal testimony for the record, I would like to provide only a brief introduction at this point, in order to allow maximum time for member questions. I appear before you today in my capacity as Assistant Secretary of Defense for Homeland Defense. My position was created by Public Law 107-314, the National Defense Authorization Act of 2003. The statutory duty assigned to the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Homeland Defense is ``the overall supervision of the homeland defense activities of the Department.'' I was nominated by President Bush in January 2003 and confirmed by the Senate 1 month later. As a result, I have been serving in this office for just a little over a year. In the interim, much has happened. Although my written testimony focus in some detail on the organizational changes within the Department of Defense following the attacks of September 11, 2001. I think the members of this committee are primarily interested in the recent steps we have taken to ensure the physical safety of our citizens, their property and our Constitutional freedoms. The painful losses of September 11th produced not only grief, but resolute action. Each day since September 11th, the men and women of the North American Aerospace Defense Command, NORAD, have patrolled the air space over Canada and the United States. In a completely integrated effort of U.S. and Canadian capabilities, the U.S. Air Force, Air Force Reserve and the Air Guard have protected the skies of our major metropolitan areas, critical infrastructure, government facilities and historic monuments. These dedicated professionals have executed over 34,000 air defense sorties and responded to over 1,700 requests from the Federal Aviation Administration to intercept potential air threats. That is an extraordinary achievement. In fiscal year 2004 alone, the Air National Guard has flown 1,909 sorties and logged 6,926 hours to guard our Nation's skies. The number of flights and their location changes daily, and each day's flight data is shared in advance with the Department of Homeland Security. This level of air security is unprecedented in our Nation's history. Nearly every homeland defense exercise that we now conduct involves a threat scenario involving a terrorist takeover on commercial airliners. As a result, our air defense training is realistic, focused, and subject to well understood rules of engagement. We had implemented similar improvements in our domestic land defense capabilities, while fully recognizing that domestic counter-terrorism is a lead law enforcement mission, we now have Active Duty soldiers and Marines on alert every hour of every day, prepared to deploy to any location within the United States where a land defense against a terrorist attack might be required. Such quick reaction forces did not exist on September 11, 2001. They do now and they are both trained and ready. Even more importantly, we are working closely with the National Guard Bureau to ensure that Army Guard forces will be mission ready to provide immediate land security forces within their own States. In my judgment, the protection of critical infrastructure will likely become a core National Guard mission during the next decade. It is also important to note that DOD has recently been assigned, with the signing of Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7, an important responsibility in the protection of the defense industrial base. The achievement of this new mission will require close coordination of private and public, military and civilian security capabilities. The task is both enormous and essential. We now recognize that a 21st century maritime defense requires a common operating picture of the maritime domain, real time tracking of threat vessels, appropriate ships and resources to support maritime intercept operations on the high seas against terrorists potentially armed with weapons of mass destruction, and command and control structure which maximizes both Navy and Coast Guard capabilities. Our goal is to defeat every enemy maritime threat with an integrated, layered defense long before such threats are able to enter our ports. To that end, Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld recently signed an expanded maritime intercept operations execute order for realistic maritime exercises and unprecedented Navy-Coast Guard cooperation. We are making daily progress with that goal. Similar improvements have been made with regard to DOD's ability to support civilian authorities following a terrorist attack. Thirty-two National Guard weapons of mass destruction civil support teams have been trained, equipped and certified by the Secretary of Defense. Twelve new teams will be created this year. We are planning to establish a total of 55 civil support teams, sufficient to ensure that every State and territory will be served by a team. If a more substantial WMD response is required, we have established, equipped and organized large joint task forces at dispersed locations throughout the United States, sufficient to ensure that we will be able to respond to multiple, near- simultaneous terrorist attacks involving weapons of mass destruction. Although this capability is not fully developed, we are working hard and with a sense of urgency to get there. In my view, multiple simultaneous attacks are not only possible, they are consistent with terrorist operational doctrine. Even in the absence of a large scale enemy attack, the Department of Defense civil support responsibility is substantial. During the past year, DOD acted on 75 separate civil support requests from more than 20 civilian agencies, including the January 4th deployment of the Marine Corps chemical-biological incident response force to the Dirksen Building when ricin was detected in Senator Frist's office. That mission was executed at the request of the Capitol Police. And finally, we at DOD recognize that an effective defense against terrorist activity requires a close daily partnership between our Department and the newly created Department of Homeland Security. Our missions are complementary and mutually reinforcing. To make certain that partnership is a reality, employees from my office now work full time in the Homeland Security and Operations Center. A defense coordination office has been established by DOD personnel at DHS. A memorandum of agreement for mutual support has been negotiated between the two departments. And I meet routinely and regulatory with senior DHS leadership, including a 1-hour meeting yesterday with Admiral Loy, the Deputy Secretary. Our homeland security and homeland defense exercise programs have now been fully integrated. The scenarios are challenging and involve complete interagency participation. Mr. Chairman, this summary should make it clear that the Department of Defense, working with our partners in the private and public sectors at the local, State and national levels, is fully committed to the most capable homeland defense ever planned or executed in our country's history. Despite great progress, we are not comfortable, we are not satisfied. Rather, we are dedicated, with a real sense of urgency, to ever-improving homeland defense capabilities. In that effort, our men and women in uniform stand in common cause with the members of this committee. Victory in the global war on terrorism is a national imperative, our generation's greatest challenge. Mr. Chairman, I look forward to your questions and those of the members of the committee.

Thanks very much. Mr. Hall. Mr. Hall. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for the opportunity to be here and speak to the committee. I'm pleased to be here today with my colleague Paul McHale and with Generals Blum and Love to discuss the role of the National Guard in overseas and homeland operations. Our Guard and Reserve make up 46 percent of our military, or some 1.2 million service members. Since September 11, we have mobilized a total of 340,000 service members. This equates to 40 percent of our force, and it's the largest mobilization since Korea. Today as we meet, there are over 165,000 Reserve and Guard members that are mobilized. Although 60 percent of our Reserve force has not been touched, we share everyone's concerns about the same thing, and that's the stress on our force. Just as the active force is the first to deploy in support of U.S. operations abroad, the National Guard is often the first military force to deploy in support of most homeland security requirements. National Guard is a citizen soldier force that can be activated by the Governor in support of State emergencies and also Federalized to support national contingency requirements. A Governor can deploy National Guard under State Active Duty or upon approval of the Secretary of Defense in Title 32 of the U.S. Code, National Guard can of course be Federalized under provisions of Title 10, U.S. Code. This unique triple status makes the National Guard a cost effective, flexible force that can be employed in a variety of circumstances. The Guard's capability was demonstrated in the aftermath of the September 11th attacks. Even after the attacks, as we have heard and know, the National Guard responded, National Guard assets took to the skies to secure our air space, and local Guard forces were directly sent to the World Trade Center and the Pentagon to assist with security and recovery efforts. Shortly thereafter, the President asked the Governors to use their Guardsmen to secure airports at Federal expense. They responded in a matter of hours by deploying Air Guardsmen in Title 32 status at over 440 airports. In addition, many of our Governors ordered our Guardsmen in State Active Duty to secure critical infrastructure facilities, such as bridges, power plants and government buildings. Many of those State security missions continue today. Our National Guard personnel were activated in 12 States under Title 10 to augment security along our Nation's borders. Their missions ensure that the commerce continued to flow while the vital entryways were protected. Today, there are over 100,000 Air and Army National Guard men and women mobilized in support of Operations Noble Eagle, Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom. They are flying air patrols, performing force protection duties here in the United States, flying refueling missions over central Asia and on the ground in both Iraq and Afghanistan. As expected, the National Guard continues to conduct all missions in an exceptional manner. The fight against terrorism and the protection of our homeland will be protracted endeavors, much like the cold war. To that end, many outside policy experts, independent panels and studies have advocated expanding roles for the National Guard in homeland security. Some have even suggested that the National Guard should be reoriented, re-equipped, and retrained solely for the homeland security mission. The reality is that there has been no recent national security change that justifies the need to establish a separate role for the National Guard to perform homeland security related missions under new statutes and administrative guidelines. There are already sufficient legal mechanisms in place that enable State and territorial Governors to employ their National Guard forces and support local authorities to meet a wide range of existing missions. The National Guard is an integral part of the Air Force and Army total force mission capability. Their roles are vital to the survival of this Nation. The position of the Department of Defense is that the National Guard will remain a dual mission military force. This concludes my statement. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.

Thank you very much. General Blum. General Blum. Good morning, Chairman Davis and other members of the committee. Thank you for the opportunity to address this body this morning. I ask that my written testimony be entered into the record. Chairman Tom Davis. Without objection, so ordered. General Blum. As we appear here this morning before you, there are 149,000 citizen soldiers and airmen employed all over the globe in the current global war on terrorism. For the last 2\\1/2\\ years, since September 11, the National Guard has maintained and sustained that level of contribution to the war fight, both here at home and abroad. The National Guard is no longer questioned about its relevance. Today our worst critics can only call us over-used or essential to the safety and security of our Nation. The modern day National Guard has been in the homeland defense business now for 367 years. Our homeland defense efforts actually predate us as a Nation. We plan to remain in that effort and we call that ``job No. 1'' or ``priority No. 1.'' But defending the homeland is not always done only here at home. Some of that homeland defense has to be conducted, to use a sports analogy, as an away game, or a scheduled away game, where you see us participating with our Active Duty counterparts and the other Reserve components in a joint, multinational, interagency and intergovernmental effort overseas in Iraq, Afghanistan, Kosovo, Bosnia and other places in the world. We have to change the National Guard, however, because it is not exactly optimized for the current threat that we're facing right now and future threats that we foresee on the horizon. As the modern day National Guard, we can answer no less calls by our Governors to respond to catastrophic events created by either Mother Nature, man-made accidents or acts of terrorism here at home. But we have to change the National Guard, the way we train it, organize it, and most importantly, the way we resource it, so that it can be an operational Reserve force that can be used in a joint and expeditionary overseas war fight to supplement our active components when necessary. We are not structured correctly to do that today and we are working very hard to move as fast as we can with a great sense of urgency to become a relevant, ready, reliable and accessible force that is needed by our combatant commanders around the world. The Congress, and its National Guard and Reserve Equipment Account, will remain a very essential tool in helping us accomplish this effort. As you heard Governor Pataki say, and the two previous Secretaries that have testified before me in their opening statements, I am proud to tell you that the National Guard has met every requirement that it has been asked to perform since September 11 and even before that. Service in the National Guard has always been honorable, but it is particularly rewarding today, because we are truly defending our Nation, our way of life, our liberties, our form of government, and our future. And we're very proud to stand and answer the call to do that. But to do this, I have to tell you, we are committed to transformation. We are changing the Guard from what it was designed to do what it needs to be designed to do today. We are transforming the Guard today to be a more joint and effective organization from the very top to the very bottom, building it from the bottom up, and that's the essence of the Joint Force Headquarters that were described by Governor Pataki and the Secretaries. We are developing capabilities that will be needed to defend the homeland here at home and to support combatant commanders overseas in the war-fight outside our Nation's borders. We want to give better predictability to our soldiers, to their families, to their employers, as you heard discussed. And we've built a model for this that we think will accomplish better predictability. Soldiers, their families and employers will know on a more routine basis when they can expect to be called, how long they can expect to be deployed and when they will return home and then how soon again they will be asked to answer the call for another extended duration deployment. We are meeting the needs of our elected officials and our uniformed leaders. We are meeting the mandate to operate as a seamless organization that can perform both the State mission and the Federal mission and do them simultaneously if necessary and to be able to do this in a joint, interagency, intergovernmental or multinational environment if required. The National Guard is focusing so that it ensures that every Governor and every combatant commander gets the right force mix from the National Guard: the right kinds of units with the right kinds of capabilities; modern equipment that is interoperable, and beyond interoperable--or actually interchangeable parts with our active components, whether it be Air Force or Army, Air National Guard or Army National Guard. We need to redistribute these capabilities so they are resident in every State and territory of this great Nation. We are transforming, along with the Army and the Air Force. This is not an independent effort. We are shoulder-to-shoulder on this. There is no daylight between the National Guard and the active components as once existed. The Army recognizes that there are 18 divisions in the U.S. Army; 10 on Active Duty, 8 in the National Guard. The U.S. Army hopes to have 84 transformed brigades, 34 of these brigades will be resident in the Army National Guard. We are similarly full partners with the U.S. Air Force and their initiatives to modernize and transform and develop modularity, so that the Air National Guard and the Army National Guard can truly be plug and play elements of our Active Duty counterparts. The bottom line is, your National Guard is committed to doing what is right for the United States of America. I look forward to answering your questions. Thank you.

Thank you very much. General Love. General Love. Mr. Chairman, distinguished members of the committee, on behalf of General Everhard and the men and women of the U.S. Northern Command, thank you for the opportunity to be here to discuss the National Guard's role in the vital issues of homeland defense and homeland security. As you've heard from Secretary McHale, Secretary Hall and Lieutenant General Blum, every Department of Defense office and headquarters charged with defending our homeland has looked very carefully at the role the National Guard should play in deterring and preventing attacks on our homeland and mitigating any attacks that might occur. The National Guard Bureau, under the guidance and direction of General Blum, has begun a number of what I believe to be critical initiatives to respond to the realities of our post-September 11 world. Historically, the National Guard headquarters in each State has largely acted to fulfill the services and needs to organize, train and equip airmen and soldiers to fight our Nation's war somewhere other than in our homeland. It was always an additional mission to provide Guardsmen to meet the needs of their States in responding to natural disasters. That response seldom called for skills other than those war-time training had already provided. All of our assumptions regarding the use of our core war force and Reserve were predicated upon the United States having and retaining the initiative as to where to fight and when to fight. This is not the case with the global war on terrorism. We no longer have the initiative, and we must be prepared to respond anywhere within our homeland, knowing that any delay in that response may be a loss of lives, and those are American lives. The National Guard has deployed in 3,300 locations across our Nation. Wherever a terrorist attack may occur, it is likely that the National Guard will be the first military force on the scene. The response to a terrorist attack will not be analogous to the response to a flood. It will require specialized training at a corporate as well as a unique command and control structure that is responsive to the realities of a WMD attack. By any measure, this change is through transformation. The National Guard headquarters in each State must now deal with its historic roles to organize, train, equip and deploy, it must now be an operational headquarters that provides not only a response to a crisis in their State but provides NORTHCOM and the Nation with a clear picture of what has happened and what is needed to save lives and property. We must examine closely the statutory authorities under which the National Guard responds to an attack in our homeland and how best it may be utilized to prevent those attacks. We at NORTHCOM are looking closely at changes that may be necessary in Title 32 of the U.S. Code. We believe that certain circumstances may dictate that National Guard units should perform homeland defense or homeland security duties in a Federal status other than Title 10. It may be far more effective for the Guard to remain under the command of the Governor of a State as opposed to being Federalized and placed under the command of NORTHCOM. Guardsmen know the local territory, know the local first responders, exercise with those who will be engaged on the part of the State emergency response system, and under Title 32 utilization, can be accessed far more quickly. Response in the homeland is all about speed. We cannot wait for help from afar if there is help close at hand. We must train and equip that help so it can offer the kind of assistance that is needed and so it can do so with proper training and equipment. If the mission is a Federal mission, we must find a way to budget for that mission and make those funds available to a Governor to pay his or her Guardsmen. Of course, States must assure the Congress that its appropriations are being used as it directs. But that's not a complicated undertaking. The Guard performs counter-drug missions in a similar manner, and that program has worked well for 15 years. The war on terrorism demands that we look for innovative ways to utilize those forces that are closest to any crisis. That said, it is not really innovative at all. The National Guard has been responding to crises in their communities for more than 367 years, since 1636, when the Massachusetts Militia mustered in December of that year in Salem. Mr. Chairman, thank you for the opportunity to testify today and thank you and your colleagues for your continued commitment to armed forces. [The prepared statement of General Love follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T5597.065 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T5597.066 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T5597.067 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T5597.068 Chairman Tom Davis. Thank you very much. I thank the panel for your testimony. We will move into questioning. We'll start first with the gentleman from Indiana, Mr. Souder. Mr. Souder. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I first want to make sure I get a couple of comments on the record, if we have to get the answers written, I'd appreciate it. First, I want to thank Secretary McHale for his comments on narcotics. It's impossible to do that task without the assistance of the Department of Defense. On JTF6, there is an interrelationship where the training of our Guard and Reserve and military component is absolutely essential to our south border. If we're long-term going to protect our homeland security on the south border, I mean, right now a million people are making it across. That's why we need immigration reform, we need a number of things. But the bottom line is, we are not secure at all there. And without your help, it would be inconceivable even to do it. I want to raise again, and we need your particular help, we've raised this with the Department of Defense, in the Barry Goldwater Range in the southwest part of Arizona, we have a problem with, we don't have aerostat protection, we have high yield monitoring that can feed in, but we need low level. The U.S. Customs, which is now your homeland security, wants to fly planes there in a 5 mile radius, like they do the rest of our border, but have not because it's an Air Force training range. But the jets shouldn't be that close to the international border anyway, or we'd have a problem. We need to get this worked out. We have repeatedly been told, well, we're working on it, but we need a solution, because what's going to happen is, we squeeze other parts of the border, illegals, not to mention narcotics trafficking, is going to push into that range. And the first one that gets killed, you are going to endanger your entire training facility there. We have to secure that portion of the border, not only for other reasons in the United States, but for even keeping our range open. We really need your help on the Air Force range. But I thank you for raising the narcotics issue. I want to mention a couple of other things, and then if the chairman indulges, maybe you can raise it. I have heard from the Guard and from the manufacturer that the Humvees that the Guard takes over to Iraq are being left there because of shortages of the Humvee, and I want to know if this is true, because it's going to long term impact our training with Guard people in the States if we're having to leave the Humvees in Iraq. If it's true, which we have heard from a number of different people in a number of different places, then are you requesting more Humvees for Guard and Reserve training? Second, I was pleased to hear that you are trying to get better at communicating to our groups long term whether they're going to be deployed again, not only the first time. But I want to raise a couple of questions. My understanding is that 60 percent have not been utilized. A logical question would be, before others go back, will that 60 percent be utilized, or are we talking about some of these units didn't have, didn't get 100 percent utilized and the 60 percent of the Guard that hasn't been utilized in fact may be in that unit, and if that unit's called up, they may not be utilized again. In other words, I just had a group that's been forward deployed of 700 Army Guard in Fort Wayne, IN that was a specially trained battalion. Are we adequately communicating? Will that group be called up again because of its special training? I have a Reserve group that is going up over to Afghanistan, they may already be in flight, it's within the next day, that they haven't been forward deployed since Alayat Gulf. But they are the only artillery ammunition support group going into Afghanistan, in place of all the other units on the ground. It seems to me, if our premise is correct, that many of us feel that the war on terrorism is not going away and we are going to use Guard and Reserve, certain specially trained units for short need may be facing some serious redeployment, even if you have 60 percent that aren't. Could you elaborate on that, because we need to be able to look at, should we have specially targeted benefits for those who are higher risk, how do we communicate this, if you join certain units? Because it doesn't seem to be an even deployment list in the combat zone. Mr. Hall. I certainly would take a couple of them. You hit upon the exact problem that we have. As we analyzed the force over the past 19 months that I've been there, we have discovered that we have used about 28,000 of our people over and over again, two, three and four times. And that's about 3.3 percent of our force. But they're in specialties like civil affairs, military police, air traffic control. So it is very clear to us that we need to rebalance. And within that 60 percent that we mentioned are many of the specialties that are not required today. So we have an excess of artillery. So the services are all recommitted to balancing 100,000 billets and taking the specialties that were targeted toward the cold war that are not used in today's warfare, moving these over, building a bigger base so that we don't have to continually call up the same people all the time. As of this year, we're about halfway there. We have 50,000 billets, 10,000 in 2003, 20,000 in 2004 and 20,000 in 2005. We have another 50,000 to go, and the services are moving as fast as they can to convert those kinds of specialties, and one of the areas is excess artillery. So we're concerned about that. We want to minimize the stress, and we certainly, every time we mobilize a unit, one of the things my office asks is, when were they mobilized before, how long ago and are there other alternatives we have other than remobilizing them, either through other services, through the joint solutions. So that is always part of that equation. We want to reduce that stress on the force. With respect to the Humvees, I think you are absolutely right, that there are ones that are being left there. I think it's a question that all the chiefs, including General Myers, have looked at. If there are not enough, do you want them where the actual combat was going on, rather than the training. The answer is, you'd like them both places. As you know, the industrial base is pushing as hard as it can to get the armored Humvees out. But right now they are kept there, so that the people participating in combat can have them. We certainly would like to have them at the national training center and other places, and we're moving toward getting those for training. Mr. Souder. I want to clarify something for the record there, because this is important to Members of Congress. If somebody, the AM General facility that makes the Humvees is at the edge of my district, it's not in my district, but my district is the biggest parts supplier. They can produce more. They can produce 150 more a month now, up-armored. The question is, are you going to allocate the funds to do that and is the administration going to request that. Mr. Hall. I will certainly take that for the record, sir, that they have that capacity. And I don't know if General Blum has any comments on the Humvees or not. General Blum. My comments on the up-armored Humvees would be this. The National Guard has shipped overseas every single up-armored Humvee that we controlled in the United States of America, so that the soldiers in harm's way have the best protection to perform their mission. I don't want to see an up- armored Humvee in the United States of America until every single one that's required overseas in the warfight is delivered into the warfight. I cannot speak to what AMC can produce or what the Congress wants to provide in the way of funds and who's going to request it. But I will tell you, with the assets that I control, I put the protection of soldiers No. 1, and I put that protection in theater where they need the protection. Thank you. Chairman Tom Davis. Thank you very much. Ms. Norton. Ms. Norton. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. D.C. National Guards, the Guardsmen trucking company where we lost one man, came home yesterday, we had a big ceremony, and I am one of their greatest supporters, have great appreciation for them. I'm going to ask Mr. McHale to help me to get for the District of Columbia what Mr. Pataki indicated in his testimony has been so helpful to him, and I quote from you, we need to ensure that troops activated under Title 32 status remain under the authority and control of the State's Governor to ensure maximum flexibility and effective deployment. The D.C. National Guard comes totally under the President of the United States, it's as if this were 1800. It's really dangerous today to have a situation in the Nation's Capital where the kind of flexibility that Mr. Pataki testified to is not even possible here. I have a bill to put the National Guard under the mayor. At least this city, which must be target No. 1 in the world, ought to have the kind of flexibility as Mr. Pataki. I'm going to ask you to work with my office to try to get some of that flexibility here in the Nation's Capital, where more is at stake than the, not only the 600,000 people who live here, but the entire Federal presence as well. That flexibility is simply not available to us. My question really goes, however, to the mix. I very much appreciate what you are trying to do with the National Guard. It's almost like zero budgeting. Gentleman, I think you may as well start over again. It's the old concept of the militia, which we are operating under, just lay aside, begin in the world of post-September 11, particularly since I understand that within a few months you may have as many as 40 percent of the National Guard in Iraq. Nobody contemplated that, even a year ago. In Mr. Pataki's testimony, by the way, the GAO graph showing this escalation of the Army National Guard--nobody believed that these men and women were prepared for this kind of escalation in combat. And in contrast to your testimony, the GAO, let me read from the GAO, it says, DOD has not fully defined requirements, readiness standards and readiness measures for the homeland security missions it will lead or support. The Guard's readiness, preparedness specifically for homeland mission is unknown. Then it says, this is my concern, based on concern that continuing deployments reduce the Guard's preparedness and availability for all its homeland security and natural disaster missions. Now, Mr. Pataki was brought here this afternoon, he is totally unrepresentative of the Governors of the United States at this point, wonderful testimony. But there's no doubt he called General Blum's name over and over again, there is no doubt that following September 11 you were careful about what you did with the National Guard in the State of New York. And I hope that the next time we will have a more typical Governor here, so we can really find out what is happening with the Governors. At least for example, in neighboring New Jersey, 70 percent of the National Guard has been deployed. In this city, 40 percent have been deployed. These folks are in Iraq. Now, the Governor testified proudly since he's been Governor, he's been Governor for 2 terms, 8 natural disasters, 4 plane crashes, 11 crippling blizzards, 2 major wildfires, etc. We just had a terrible hurricane, Hurricane Isabel. It is very hard for me to believe we had a representative Governor here. He would be able to say, particularly since there's no doubt he wouldn't have been given the special consideration that New York was entitled to, that he could handle any disaster that came forward. I need to know, particularly in light of what the GAO has said, even about the definition of requirements. I need to know, I find a real contrast with you on the testimony. I need to know what we're supposed to do on the home front, when these are deployed in Iraq, we've got them deployed also for homeland security, and then they're supposed to deal with disasters as well. I still have no understanding of how this in fact is going to occur, how long it will take you to get to this rebalanced National Guard, or how a typical Governor is supposed to operate during this period when that Governor happens not to be of New York State. Mr. McHale. Congresswoman, if I may, what I'll do is divide your question into a couple of different parts. A portion of your question falls within the area of responsibility that has been assigned to me, a portion of the question is really within the area of responsibility assigned to Secretary Hall and General Blum. But let me take the part for which I am accountable. With regard to the command and control of the D.C. National Guard, the first part of the comment that you raised, in order to achieve a closer partnership between the Department of Defense and the operational requirements assigned to the D.C. National Guard, there is an ongoing review, not yet completed, within the Department of Defense that would consider the possibility of transferring that responsibility from one individual to another. You correctly noted that ultimately the President of the United States is responsible for the"
