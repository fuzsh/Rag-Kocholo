        "text": "I don't think it's really one depth chart. Jesus is one kind of striker; Vazquez is completely different, and I don't think either are good enough that fit isn't a major part of why they'd be selected at this point.\n\nI think it's a big reason why Ferreira made the Qatar roster -- because he was a change of pace for a coach who was seriously considering multiple times to use something false 9-ish and put the scoring on the wingers. I'm not saying this is the right way to think about it, but I don't know that Pepi was ever in contention with Ferreira; I think he was competing with Sargent and Wright. And in that context, Berhalter's comments about size, physicality, etc make a lot more sense.\n\nBecause of this, I do think Ferreira has dropped down a bit in part because the false 9 is pretty dead. We did it before Balogun's commitment, and with that and Pepi's continued development, the striker position doesn't look great, but it doesn't entirely look like we need to run out Reyna or Ferreira at the false 9.\n\nI also think that it's worth noting that for the World Cup, some of the decisions clearly leaned to size, strength and experience relative to other rosters. And I expect that for Copa as well and less so for CONCACAF-only comps.\n\nEither way, I think it's weird to see Ferreira behind Dike on depth charts. Dike has barely played over the last two years and while he has some great positives, he's the least well rounded striker on these lists.\n\nI don't think a 9 that passes to goal scoring wingers is ever out of the playbook as long as we have Pulisic as our best player.\n\nDike's just got too many can'ts for me: doesn't seem like he can do 90, can't really defend, can't use his left foot, can't get shots off quickly, and so on.\n\nHe's big and strong and fast and he's pretty good in the air and when he gets a shot off it's a rocket, but I think he's somewhat half dimensional right now.\n\nHe didn't drop Pepi for form. His only argument against Pepi that made any kind of sense at all was, well, he didn't rate the Netherlands, period, but since then he's called in Dest, Tillman, and Pepi so, it doesn't make any sense. The form argument dies right here, as I've posted before: What were Pepi's production #'s before the deadline for naming the roster?\n\nIn his first 9 games for Groningen (8 Eredivisie and 1 League Cup Match) he scored 6 goals, and added 2 assists, just to underline it, in his 10th game, a couple of days after the worst announcement of his life, he scored again, making it 7 goals and 2 assists in his first 10 matches for Groningen. Well? Did he poor in the goals and get skunked otherwise? It turns out, nope, in those first 10 matches he was only skunked twice.\n\nSo the Pepi exclusion remains utterly obtuse, to this day, he made contradictory statements about it as well (in one case suggesting it was about Pepi competing with Ferreira for a spot, in another case mentioning the comp was Sargent, and also mentioning that the league was a bad match for what we could expect in the WC (which was odd since the Dutch were always the most likely opponent in the knockouts, and the opponents across the board had either great size, or good to average size, not ideal for Ferreira (even with his Caribbean conquests).\n\nI don't think there's an answer there, or really anywhere. We'll never know why he left him off, though I think the simplest answer is the right one: He was lazy as hell in his thinking, and focused more on Pepi's swoon in Augsburg where he earned only a handful of starts (people forget he didn't score there at all yes, but he also barely played, and only very rarely started matches there), and his swoon with the senior team where after a blistering start against Honduras and Jamaica, his play became more middling to erratic, with no goal production, and uneven at best performances.\n\nThat's the only argument that makes sense to me. He hadn't score for the US in a year, didn't score for Augsburg, Ferreira was productive for the senior team (admittedly against totally bunk competition, and not against the tougher competition and he tailed off yet again at the end of the season), and maybe he went with the hot hand who wasnt actually hot? I don't know, it just never made sense because the hottest striker in the pool in the fall of '22 was Pepi, not Pefok, not Sargent (who cooled and was shunted back to the wing), not Ferreira who did little yet again down the stretch, I guess you can say Wright was hot, he was, but Pepi was the one guy producing a goal contribution per start essentially which made the exclusion utterly mystifying.\n\nAs for Berhalter going with hot hands and form? I don't really agree. I think he's more a vividness bias guy to quote Matt Kelly at playerprofiler. If you're an edge guy, and you have a horrific performance, you're probably gonna get bounced out of the pool. If you're a locked in starter, you're probably gonna get forgiven screw ups, or like Weah, ice cold form for club. Think of the guys that made vivid screw ups or crap performances and how quickly they disappeared: Trapp, Bradley, Yueill, Lovitz and friends from '19, the pile of wtf moments from Bello, and McKenzie and others in '21, Lletgett's horror show match at Panama, Zardes in qualifying (own goal+), JAB's horror show in Window 1, Sargent's horror show in window 1, Pefok's blown sitter against El Tri in window 5.\n\nI tend to think he gives people a quick hook when he's already a skeptic and something vivid happens, or if a guy has slowly played himself out of contention (say Arriola vs weah, kind of). Since he's an analytics guy, maybe thats some of it too, I honestly don't know. But I don't think it's hot form, because guys like Aaronson, Pulisic, McKennie, Weah, Ferreira, Sargent, just to name a few have been ice cold, and still gotten love.\n\nI tend to think he has his biases like anyone, and when he sees something that underlines, italicizes, and bold types a bias, he acts. But that's just a hunch based on what he's seen. With a guy like Pepi, it's different, I dont know wtf happened there, and I tend to think the answer is one of two things:\n\n1. Greg Velasquez at scuffed calls his, his penchant to be \"too cute\" periodically. Overthinking something, or underthinking it because he's taken by an \"idea\" and getting too cute when something should be obvious (\"not only should Pepi be in the pool, he should be starting\").\n\n2. He overreacted to Augsburg, and the window 3/4/5 lack of production with the senior team, and underreacted to his sudden explosion of productivity immediately after arriving in Groningen. I tend to think it's a \"sign\" that this might have been happening the summer of '22, he left Pepi off of that summer window, which should have alarmed us all more, a la leaving Sargent off in '19's Gold Cup, but none of us thought he'd be stupid enough to not have him in the roster for Qatar, we were all panicked that he might be stupid enough to start Ferreira over him, we weren't afraid of him actually leaving him at home, for all of us, that wasn't even considered a possibility. Now people try to figure out why, but that's assuming it was rational, when it wasn't, it was idiocy, always was. Simple as that.\n\nI'd normally think that's a possibility, but the problem is, we don't have much time. Balo and Pepi have clearly locked onto the top 2 gigs, Sargent is humming for the first time in his club career the last 18 months other than the injury, Wright is officially usable at least as a club player, Ferreira's always Ferreira (lots of goals, lots of assists, playing against crap opponents, untested against quality), Pefok suddenly woke up a bit. Dike's been largely out since the summer of '01 other than some months here and there. When can he break through? There's no way he's getting an invite in spring or summer of '24, which leaves fall of '24, and '25 to make an impression unless injuries hit.\n\nI'm just skeptical. He just had terrible timing with injuries because post-covid, we had to reinvent the striker position with Altidore and Wood shoved into retirement, and Zardes sooned to be kicked out the air lock. So there was an opening in '21, and he was somewhat promising before getting hurt in the Gold Cup and then, basically a black hole since. And since then, Sargent, Pepi, Ferreira, and Balo have layed claims, while Pefok and Wright have done business periodically in Europe for Pefok and consistently for Wright, and now the position looks nothing at all like it did in 2021. Its loaded with accomplished guys playing in Europe, and Ferreira. It's not a barren wasteland anymore.\n\nI get that technically there's an opening fall '24 through winter '25-'26, but that's not really a lot of time for a guy based in Europe to grab an injury related opportunity and run with it. March, Summer, Fall windows of '24 and '25 and that's basically a wrap.\n\nI suspect there's next to no chance barring an injury apocalypse."
