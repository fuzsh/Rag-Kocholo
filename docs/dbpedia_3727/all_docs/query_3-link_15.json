        "text": "Nottingham Forest have completed the signing of Nuno Tavares on loan from Arsenal.\n\nThe deal includes a £12m option to make the move permanent.\n\nTavares, 23, is a former Portugal under-21 international and came through the ranks at Benfica, before signing for Arsenal in the summer of 2021. He has made 17 starts and 11 substitute appearances for Arsenal in all competitions, scoring one goal.\n\nTavares picked up valuable experience in Ligue 1 during a loan spell at Marseille last season, where he made 29 starts and eight sub appearances in all competitions. He also demonstrated more attacking threat in France, where he scored six goals.\n\nHe will add valuable competition to the left-back role and will wear the No 3 shirt at the City Ground.\n\n“I’m really happy to stay in the Premier League as it’s the best league in the world and I thank Forest for giving me the opportunity,” he said.\n\nAdditional reporting: Jordan Campbell\n\nPremier League rules state that players must be registered by midday on the working day before a game.\n\nThat means that any players who make late moves on Friday will have to wait until the next round of fixtures to feature for their new teams.\n\nMatchweek four takes place this weekend, and the Premier League then pauses for the international break, before resuming on Saturday, September 16.\n\nSekou Mara is set to remain at Southampton despite interest from Lille and Werder Bremen this summer.\n\nMara was close to joining Werder Bremen on loan yesterday and Lille showed interest last night, but Southampton have decided to keep the 21-year-old striker as they want to develop him at St Mary's rather than send him out on loan. He is expected to be given opportunities in the first team this season.\n\nThe decision to keep Mara comes despite the impending signing of fellow striker Ross Stewart from Sunderland.\n\nMara joined Southampton from Bordeaux last summer in a deal worth €13million (£11.1m). However, he failed to fully adjust to life at St Mary's, scoring two goals and providing three assists in 33 games last season.\n\nThe striker has made three appearances for Southampton this season, most recently coming on as a substitute during his side's 2-1 victory over Queens Park Rangers last Saturday.\n\nChelsea have completed the signing of Cole Palmer from Manchester City.\n\nCity will receive an initial £40million ($50.7m) with £2.5m due in potential add-ons.\n\nPalmer, 21, has signed a seven-year deal at Chelsea, with the option for a further 12 months.\n\n\"I’m excited to get started and it feels great to sign,\" said Palmer. \"I’ve joined Chelsea because the project here sounds good and because of the platform I will have to try to showcase my talents.\n\n\"It is a young and hungry squad and, hopefully, we can do something special here.\"\n\nA product of City's academy, Palmer has made 19 appearances in the Premier League and a further 22 in additional competitions.\n\nEverton striker Tom Cannon is set to undergo a medical at Leicester after the two clubs agreed a deal worth around £7.5million.\n\nThe academy graduate has attracted interest from several Championship clubs this window, having spent the second half of last season on loan at Preston North End.\n\nCannon scored eight goals in 20 Championship appearances for Preston and has featured once off the bench for Everton this term.\n\nThere may be further Goodison Park exits on deadline day in addition to Cannon, with Everton and Fulham still in talks over a deal for Alex Iwobi. The winger's contract is set to expire next summer.\n\nDemarai Gray is also attracting late interest from Lille after a move to Saudi side Al Shabab stalled.\n\nNottingham Forest have agreed a deal with Chelsea to sign Callum Hudson-Odoi.\n\nThere remains a few minor issues for the player to resolve with the London club, but Forest are hopeful that the deal will quickly progress today.\n\nThe 22-year-old winger would fill the void left by Brennan Johnson, if he is sold today, with negotiations continuing with Tottenham and continued interest from Chelsea, Atletico and one or two other clubs.\n\nSteve Cooper’s side are also expected to formalise the completion of the loan signing of Nuno Tavares, the speedy left-back, from Arsenal, which was expected to go through yesterday. An option to make the move permanent is expected to be included in the deal.\n\nForest sources also say things are ‘progressing nicely’ with regard to the signing of Nicolas Dominguez from Bologna, with fellow midfielder Remo Freuler heading in the opposite direction, as part of the package.\n\nNegotiations continue over the signing of Benfica and Greece goalkeeper Odysseas Vlachodimos.\n\nIt could be a busy day at the City Ground, with the club also keen to add a further midfielder.\n\nA £30million bid has been tabled for Ibrahim Sangare, the PSV midfielder, but more negotiation may be required to land a player who has always been a hugely ambitious target this summer.\n\nForest have Leicester’s Wilfred Ndidi as an alternative option while interest in long-term target Michy Batshuayi, currently at Fenerbahce, has also been revived, as the club look to bolster their forward options.\n\nMurillo, the Brazilian central defender, became Forest’s sixth signing of the summer last night, when he joined on a five-year contract from Corinthians, in a deal with an initial €13m.\n\nSouthampton have signed Taylor Harwood-Bellis on loan from Manchester City.\n\nThe 21-year-old centre-back won the Championship title with Burnley last season and returns for another season in the second tier.\n\nThere is an obligation to buy in the region of £20million included if Saints are promoted.\n\nHarwood-Bellis said: \"I’m really happy to be here and can’t wait to get going. The willingness from their side to get me in the door and when I spoke to the manager and Jason (Wilcox) I think it was straight after then that I knew.\n\n\"I felt the warmth of the manager and he explained to me exactly what he wants to do and the ambitions of the club that suited exactly where I am in my career and where I want to be going forward, and I can hopefully do it under the manager here.\n\n\"I want to win, I obviously had a taste of that this summer, but my aspiration is to become a better footballer as well, and I feel like I can do that along the way and learn different styles and different ways to play football and I feel like the manager, the staff and the team here can help me do that.\"\n\nManchester United have completed the signing of Altay Bayindir from Fenerbahce.\n\nThe 25-year-old goalkeeper has signed a four-year deal to keep him at the club until 2027.\n\nThe move comes after Dean Henderson's permanent departure to Crystal Palace was confirmed yesterday.\n\n“It is a huge honour to join Manchester United and become the first Turkish player to represent this incredible club,\" Bayindir said. \"I have a passion for success, and I will give everything to help this special group of players to achieve our ambitions.\n\n“I cannot wait to start working with such an experienced goalkeeping unit. We will support each other and drive high standards every day so that each of us is ready to perform whenever called upon.”\n\nBayindir played 40 games for Fenerbahce last season and was part of the side that won the Turkish Cup.\n\nHe made 146 appearances for Fenerbahce after arriving from Ankaragucu in 2019.\n\nSergio Reguilon has signed his Manchester United contract ahead of completing a season-long loan from Tottenham Hotspur.\n\nFinal paperwork is now being completed before an official announcement later today.\n\nThe 26-year-old travelled to Manchester for a medical last night after the two clubs agreed a straight season-long loan with no fee or option to buy.\n\nThere is a break clause in January and the Old Trafford club will cover all of his wages.\n\nThe Athletic reported yesterday that United had switched their attentions to Reguilon after previously having Chelsea's Marc Cucurella as their priority target.\n\nHowever, the Spaniard's appearance against AFC Wimbledon on Wednesday complicated matters leading United to a deal for Reguilon.\n\nFirst-choice left-back Luke Shaw is currently out with a muscle injury that is expected to sideline him for an extended period.\n\nAdditional reporting: Mario Cortegana\n\nJaphet Tanganga is set to join Bundesliga side Augsburg on loan.\n\nThe versatile defender, 24, is leaving Tottenham Hotspur on a season-long loan with the obligation to buy if certain terms are met.\n\nA potential €6million fee has been agreed if the club avoids relegation and the player makes a certain amount of appearances.\n\nHe is currently in Germany for a medical ahead of completing the move.\n\nThe Athletic revealed that the two clubs were in talks yesterday, and on Wednesday reported that a potential move to Torino was off after the Italian club and Spurs could not reach an agreement.\n\nBrighton & Hove Albion have reached a full agreement to sign Ansu Fati from Barcelona.\n\nThe 20-year-old forward is set to join Brighton on a season-long loan with no option to buy.\n\nPersonal terms are in place for Fati, who is expected to travel to England and do a medical on Thursday before completing the move.\n\nBrighton will cover almost the entirety of the salary.\n\nTottenham were linked with a move of their own for the Spain international but head coach Ange Postecoglou is prioritising a different type of forward before Friday's transfer deadline.\n\nFati won La Liga with Barcelona last season, scoring seven goals in 36 league matches, and has accumulated nine caps for his country.\n\nHe has the versatility to play as a No 6 at the base of midfield or as a No 8. For Ajax, Ryan Gravenberch largely played on the left side of a double pivot, but he is also comfortable operating on the left of a midfield three in more advanced areas.\n\nOne of his stand-out attributes is his ability to carry the ball and advance his team up the pitch. His large strides, matched with his excellent close control, allow him to drive past opponents.\n\nHe is happy to receive possession and his physicality, helped by his 6ft 3in (190cm) height, allows him to accelerate away from players.\n\nGravenberch can draw players towards him and commit them with driving runs.\n\nRead more below for a detailed analysis of his style of play...\n\nBirmingham City have reached an agreement with Leeds United for the signing of Cody Drameh on a season-long loan.\n\nThe Athletic reported on Thursday that the full-back was attracting interest from a number of Championship clubs, with Birmingham and West Brom among those making enquiries, and he is now closing in on a deadline day move to St Andrew's. He rejected a permanent move to Hull City earlier in the window because personal terms could not be agreed.\n\nThe season-long loan will take Drameh up to the end of his Leeds contract, which expires in June.\n\nThe 21-year-old is not part of Farke’s plans following the signing of Djed Spence on loan from Tottenham, a deal that was confirmed yesterday.\n\nDrameh has made only two substitute appearances for Leeds this season, having spent the second half of the 2022-23 campaign on loan at Luton Town.\n\nLiverpool have reached agreement with Bayern Munich to sign Ryan Gravenberch.\n\nThe two clubs have agreed a fixed fee of €40million for the Netherlands international midfielder to move to Anfield\n\nThe 21-year-old will fly to Liverpool tonight and undergo a medical tomorrow.\n\nThe deal was negotiated by Jose Fortes Rodriguez from Raiola and will see Gravenberch sign a long-term contract with the club.\n\nGravenberch only joined Bayern from Ajax last summer but is keen to leave the German champions in search of regular first-team football.\n\nHe started three Bundesliga matches for Bayern last season and has so far featured only once as a substitute in the 2023-23 campaign, against Augsburg last Sunday.\n\nAfter the transfer window has shut, clubs are required to submit an updated 25-man squad list to the Premier League. The deadline for this is Wednesday, September 13.\n\nEach squad must contain no more than 17 players who do not fulfil the ‘home grown player’ (HGP) criteria. The rest of the squad, up to a total of 25 players, must be ‘home grown’.\n\nPremier League rules say that a ‘home-grown player’ means a player who, irrespective of nationality or age, has been registered with any club affiliated to the Football Association or the Football Association of Wales for a period, continuous or not, of three entire seasons, or 36 months, before his 21st birthday (or the end of the season during which he turns 21).\n\nAs well as the squad list, each club submits a list of their registered under-21 players who are eligible over and above the squad limit of 25 players."
