A tall forward with great potential, the native of El Paso, Texas, had previously trained with Vancouver&#39;s USSF D-2 Pro League squad in Aug. 2010.<br> &nbsp;<br> <strong>MAJOR LEAGUE SOCCER</strong><br> <strong>2013:</strong> Salgado missed the duration of the 2013 MLS season while recovering from a right foot fracture. <strong>2012: </strong>Salgado was #23 in MLSsoccer.com&rsquo;s &#39;24 Under 24&#39; list for the season on Sept. 10.

He also assisted on Alain Rochat&rsquo;s first goal of the season during a 2-2 home draw with Pacific Northwest rivals Seattle Sounders FC on May 19. After suffering a broken foot with the United States U-20 national team on June 6, Salgado had to wait more than five months before his next MLS appearance. On Oct. 21, he was a late substitute in Whitecaps FC&#39;s 1-0 home defeat to Portland Timbers.

The striker then made his first start and scored his first goal in MLS during Whitecaps FC&#39;s 2-1 defeat at Columbus Crew on Apr. 30. He then assisted on Nizar Khalfan&#39;s first goal in MLS during Whitecaps FC&#39;s 3-0 home win over Real Salt Lake on Oct. 6. The striker also made two appearances in the Nutrilite Canadian Championship that season. This include a start in the semifinal, second leg, versus North American Soccer League side Montreal Impact on May 4 and a late substitute appearance in the final, first leg, versus MLS rivals Toronto FC on May 18. Following his rookie MLS season, Salgado joined the league&rsquo;s &lsquo;Generation adidas&rsquo; tour of the Netherlands in December of that year. This included three friendly matches versus Dutch opposition, with the striker appearing as a substitute in a 4-2 defeat to Ajax reserves on Dec. 8. Salgado then started and scored in the Generation adidas side&rsquo;s 3-2 win over Dutch Eerste Divisie (second division) outfit FC Volendam on Dec. 13. The next day, the striker played the first half of Generation adidas&rsquo; 2-0 defeat to Dutch Eerste Divisie club Almere City FC on Dec. 14. 2010: After leaving Mexican giants Club Deportivo Guadalajara in order to accept a call-up with the United States U-20 squad, Salgado opted to sign with MLS as a member of the &#39;Generation adidas&#39; player development program on July 26.

In June 2010, the striker then ended his time with Chivas after accepting a call-up to the USA U-20 national team.

On Jul. 26, 2010, Salgado scored his first international goal in his USA U-20 debut, as they defeated China 1-0 in their tournament opener. Salgado was then selected in head coach Thomas Rongen's 20-player squad for the 2011 CONCACAF U-20 Championship in Guatemala.

In Jan. 2012, Salgado was called up by USA U-20 head coach Tab Ramos for a week-long training camp in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, before appearing at a 10-day camp with the American U-20 squad in Clermont, Florida, in late Feb. 2012. U-18: After playing in the 2010 Milk Cup with USA U-20's, Salgado returned to Northern Ireland to play for the American U-18 squad in The Elite Group of the 2011 Milk Cup, where they finished in third in the tournament.
