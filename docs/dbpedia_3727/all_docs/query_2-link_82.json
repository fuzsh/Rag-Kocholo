        "text": "BISPECIFIC ANTIBODIES AGAINST HER2 AND CD3\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\nThe present invention relates to bispecific antibodies directed to human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) and cluster determinant 3 (CD3) and to uses of such antibodies, in particular their use in the treatment of cancer.\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\nHER2 is a 185-kDa cell surface receptor tyrosine kinase and member of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family that comprises four distinct receptors: EGFR/ErbB-1, HER2/ErbB-2, HER3/ErbB-3, and HER4/ErbB-4. Both homo- and heterodimers are formed by the four members of the EGFR family, with HER2 being the preferred and most potent dimerization partner for other ErbB receptors (Graus-Porta et al., Embo J 1997; 16: 1647- 1655; Tao et al., J Cell Sci 2008;121:3207-3217). HER2 can be activated by overexpression or by heterodimerization with other ErbBs that can be activated by ligand binding (Riese and Stern, Bioessays 1998;20:41-48). For HER2, no ligand has been identified. HER2 activation leads to receptor phosphorylation, which triggers a cascade of downstream signals through multiple signaling pathways, such as MAPK, phosphoinositol 3-kinase/AKT, JAK/STAT and PKC, which ultimately results in the regulation of multiple cellular functions, such as growth, survival and differentiation (Huang et al., Expert Opin Biol Ther 2009;9:97- 110).\n\nMuch of the attention on HER2 in tumors has been focused on its role in breast cancer, in which HER2 overexpression is reported in approximately 20% of the cases and is correlated with poor prognosis (Reese etal., Stem Cells 1997;15:1-8; Andrechek et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 2000;97:3444-3449; and Slamon etal., Science 1987;235:177- 182). Besides breast cancer, HER2 expression has also been associated with other human carcinoma types, including prostate cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, bladder cancer, ovarian cancer, gastric cancer, colon cancer, esophageal cancer and squamous cell carcinoma of the head & neck (Garcia de Palazzo et al., Int J Biol Markers 1993;8:233-239; Ross etal., Oncologist 2003;8:307-325; Osman etal., J Urol 2005;174:2174-2177;\n\nKapitanovic et al., Gastroenterology 1997;112:1103-1113; Turken etal., Neoplasma 2003;50:257-261; and Oshima etal., Int J Biol Markers 2001;16:250-254).\n\nTrastuzumab (HerceptinÂ®) is a recombinant, humanized monoclonal antibody directed against domain IV of the HER2 protein, thereby blocking ligand-independent HER2 homodimerization, and to a lesser extend heterodimerization of HER2 with other family members in cells with high HER2 overexpression (Cho et al., Nature 2003;421:756-760 and Wehrman et al. , Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 2006; 103 : 19063-19068) . In cells with modest HER2 expressing levels, trastuzumab was found to inhibit the formation of HER2/EGFR heterodimers (Wehrman et al. , (2006), supra; Schmitz et al. , Exp Cell Res 2009;315 : 659- 670) . Trastuzumab mediates antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and prevents ectodomain shedding, which would otherwise result in the formation of a truncated constitutively active protein in HER2 overexpressing cells. Also inhibition of both in vitro and in vivo proliferation of tumor cells expressing high levels of HER2 has been reported for trastuzumab (reviewed in Nahta and Esteva, Oncogene 2007; 26 : 3637-3643). HerceptinÂ® has been approved both for first-line and adjuvant treatment of HER2 overexpressing metastatic breast cancer, either in combination with chemotherapy, or as a single agent following one or more chemotherapy regimens. Trastuzumab has been found to be effective only in 20-50% of HER2 overexpressing breast tumor patients and many of the initial responders show relapse after a few months (Dinh et al. , Clin Adv Hematol Oncol\n\n2007; 5 : 707-717) .\n\nPertuzumab (Omnitargâ¢) is another humanized monoclonal antibody. It is directed against domain II of the HER2 protein, resulting in inhibition of ligand-induced\n\nheterodimerization {i. e. , HER2 dimerizing with another member of the ErbB family to which a ligand has bound) ; a mechanism reported to not strictly require high HER2 expression levels (Franklin et al. , Cancer Cell 2004; 5 : 317-328.) . Although pertuzumab also mediates ADCC, the main mechanism of action of pertuzumab relies on its dimerization blockade (Hughes et al. , Mol Cancer Ther 2009;8 : 1885-1892) . Moreover, pertuzumab was found to enhance EGFR internalization and downregulation by inhibiting the formation of EGFR/HER2 heterodimers, which otherwise tethers EGFR at the plasma membrane (Hughes et al. , 2009, supra). This correlates with the observation that EGFR homodimers internalize more efficient than EGFR/HER2 dimers (Pedersen et al. , Mol Cancer Res 2009;7 : 275-284. The complementary mechanisms of action of pertuzumab and trastuzumab reportedly results in enhanced anti-tumor effects and efficacy when combined in patients who progressed during prior trastuzumab therapy (Baselga et al. , J Clin Oncol 2010; 28 : 1138-1144), and a phase III trial to evaluate this antibody combination together with Docetaxel in previously untreated HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer is underway.\n\nAn alternative approach to improve targeted antibody therapy is by delivering cytotoxic cells or drugs specifically to the antigen-expressing cancer cells. This concept of using T-cell for efficient killing of tumor cells has been described already in 1985 (Stearz at al . Nature 1985, 314 : 628-631) . For example, the so-called trifunctional antibodies are bispecific antibodies, targeting with one arm the antigen on the tumor cell and with the other arm for instance CD3 on T cells, and provide Fc receptor binding by the Fc region . Upon binding, a complex of T cells, tumor cells and effector cells that bind the antibody Fc domain is formed, leading to killing of the tumor cells (Muller and Kontermann, BioDrugs 2010; 24 : 89-98.) . Ertumaxomab is one such trifunctional antibody against HER2 and CD3, which induces cytotoxicity in cell lines with low HER2 expression and which is in Phase II clinical development in metastatic breast cancer (Jones et al. , Lancet Oncol 2009; 10 : 1179- 1187 and Kiewe et al. , Clin Cancer Res 2006; 12 : 3085-3091) .\n\nAlternatively, a complex of T cells and tumor cells are formed, leading to killing of the tumor cells (Muller and Kontermann, BioDrugs 2010; 24: 89-98, Baeuerle and Reinhardt 2009, Cancer Research 96 : 4941) by an dual targeting antibody fragment (e.g. dual targeting single chain antibodies). Blinatumomab (Bargou et al, Science 2008, 321 : 974- 976) is a single chain antibody construct named BiTE which induces cytotoxicity by targeting CD19 and CD3. Other antibody fragment based T-cell engaging bispecifics have been described (Moore et al. 2011, Blood 117 :4542-4551, Baeuerle et el . Current opinion in Molecular Therapeutics 2009, 11 : 22-30) .\n\nThe complex mechanisms regulating the function of HER2 warrant further research on new and optimized therapeutic strategies against this proto-oncogene. Accordingly, there remains a need for effective and safe products for treating HER2-related diseases, such as cancer.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\nIt is an object of the present invention to provide novel effective bispecific antibodies comprising a first antigen-binding region derived from a HER2 antibody and a second region having a binding specificity for CD3, for medical use. Typically, the second region is an antigen-binding region derived from a CD3 antibody, optionally a known CD3 antibody.\n\nAs shown herein, the novel bispecific HER2xCD3 antibodies are capable of dose- dependent killing of HER2-expressing cells in in vitro cytoxicity assays, effectively prevent tumor growth in vivo, and/or have other advantages over monospecific HER2 or CD3 antibodies. In one aspect, the monospecific HER2 antibodies from which the HER2-binding region is derived exhibit HER2 binding characteristics or variable region sequences that differ from HER2 antibodies described in the art.\n\nIn preferred embodiments, the bispecific HER2xCD3 antibodies of the invention are prepared from HER2 antibodies that are fully human or humanized, bind to novel epitopes, and/or have favorable properties for therapeutic use in human patients. Each Fab-arm of the bispecific antibodies may further include an Fc-region, optionally comprising\n\nmodifications promoting the formation of the bispecific antibody, modifications affecting Fc- mediated effector functions, and/or other features described herein .\n\nThese and other aspects of the invention are described in further detail below.

Species homologs include rhesus monkey HER2 (macaca mulatta ; Genbank accession No. GI : 109114897) .\n\nThe term \"CD3\" refers to the human CD3 protein complex, which is composed of six distinct chains (a CD3y chain (SwissProt P09693), a CD35 chain (SwissProt P04234), two CD3E chains (SwissProt P07766), and one CD3 zeta chain homodimer (SwissProt P20963) (Îµ Î³: Îµ Î´ : Î¶Î¶), and which is associated with the T cell receptor a and Î² chain . The term includes any CD3 variants, isoforms and species homologs which are naturally expressed by cells, including T cells, or are expressed on cells transfected with genes or cDNA encoding the aforementioned chains.\n\nThe term \"immunoglobulin\" refers to a class of structurally related glycoproteins consisting of two pairs of polypeptide chains, one pair of light (L) low molecular weight chains and one pair of heavy (H) chains, all four inter-connected by disulfide bonds. The structure of immunoglobulins has been well characterized. See for instance Fundamental Immunology Ch . 7 (Paul, W., ed., 2nd ed. Raven Press, N.Y. (1989)). Briefly, each heavy chain typically is comprised of a heavy chain variable region (abbreviated herein as VH or VH) and a heavy chain constant region . The heavy chain constant region typically is comprised of three domains, CH1, CH2, and CH3. Each light chain typically is comprised of a light chain variable region (abbreviated herein as VL or VL) and a light chain constant region. The light chain constant region typically is comprised of one domain, Q_. The VH and VL regions may be further subdivided into regions of hypervariability (or hypervariable regions which may be hypervariable in sequence and/or form of structurally defined loops), also termed complementarity determining regions (CDRs), interspersed with regions that are more conserved, termed framework regions (FRs) . Each VH and VL is typically composed of three CDRs and four FRs, arranged from amino-terminus to carboxy-terminus in the following order: FR1, CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3, FR4 (see also Chothia and Lesk J . Mol . Biol . 196, 901-917 (1987)) . Unless otherwise stated or contradicted by context, CDR sequences herein are identified according to IMGT rules (Brochet X. , Nucl Acids Res.\n\n2008; 36 : W503-508 and Lefranc M P., Nucleic Acids Research 1999; 27 : 209-212; see also internet http address imgt.cines.fr/IMGT_vquest/vquest?livret=0&Option = humanIg .\n\nHowever, the numbering of amino acid residues in an antibody sequence can also be performed by the method described in Kabat et a/. , Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th Ed . Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD. (1991) (phrases such as \"variable domain residue numbering as in Kabat\", \"Kabat position\" or \"according to Kabat\" herein refer to this numbering system). Particularly, for numbering of amino acids in the constant region, the EU index numbering system (Kabat et al, supra), can be used . The Kabat numbering of residues may be determined for a given antibody as described in Kabat et al., supra.\n\nIn the present invention reference to amino acid positions is, unless contradicted by the context, according to the EU-index as described in Kabat et al ., Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD. (1991).\n\nThe term \"antibody\" (Ab) in the context of the present invention refers to an immunoglobulin molecule, a fragment of an immunoglobulin molecule, or a derivative of either thereof, which has the ability to specifically bind to an antigen under typical physiological conditions with a half life of significant periods of time, such as at least about 30 minutes, at least about 45 minutes, at least about one hour, at least about two hours, at least about four hours, at least about 8 hours, at least about 12 hours, about 24 hours or more, about 48 hours or more, about 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or more days, etc., or any other relevant functionally-defined period (such as a time sufficient to induce, promote, enhance, and/or modulate a physiological response associated with antibody binding to the antigen and/or time sufficient for the antibody to recruit an effector activity) . The variable regions of the heavy and light chains of the immunoglobulin molecule contain a binding domain that interacts with an antigen. The constant regions of the antibodies (Abs) may mediate the binding of the immunoglobulin to host tissues or factors, including various cells of the immune system (such as effector cells) and components of the complement system such as Clq, the first component in the classical pathway of complement activation . A HER2 antibody may also be a multispecific antibody, such as a bispecific antibody, diabody, or similar molecule (see for instance PNAS USA 90(14), 6444-8 (1993) for a description of diabodies) . Indeed, bispecific antibodies, diabodies, and the like, provided by the present invention may bind any suitable target in addition to a portion of HER2. As indicated above, the term antibody herein, unless otherwise stated or clearly contradicted by context, includes fragments of an antibody that are antigen-binding fragments, i.e. , retain the ability to specifically bind to the antigen . It has been shown that the antigen-binding function of an antibody may be performed by fragments of a full-length antibody. Examples of antigen- binding fragments encompassed within the term \"antibody\" include (i) a Fab' or Fab fragment, a monovalent fragment consisting of the VL, VH, Q_ and CH1 domains, or a monovalent antibody as described in WO2007059782 (Genmab) ; (ii) F(ab')2 fragments, bivalent fragments comprising two Fab fragments linked by a disulfide bridge at the hinge region ; (iii) a Fd fragment consisting essentially of the VH and CH1 domains; (iv) a Fv fragment consisting essentially of the VL and VH domains of a single arm of an antibody, (v) a dAb fragment (Ward et ai. , Nature 341 , 544-546 (1989)), which consists essentially of a VH domain and also called domain antibodies (Holt et ai; Trends Biotechnol . 2003\n\nNov; 21(l l) :484-90) ; (vi) camelid or nanobodies (Revets et al; Expert Opin Biol Ther. 2005 Jan ; 5(l) : l l l-24) and (vii) an isolated complementarity determining region (CDR).\n\nFurthermore, although the two domains of the Fv fragment, VL and VH, are coded for by separate genes, they may be joined, using recombinant methods, by a synthetic linker that enables them to be made as a single protein chain in which the VL and VH regions pair to form monovalent molecules (known as single chain antibodies or single chain Fv (scFv), see for instance Bird et ai. , Science 242, 423-426 (1988) and Huston et ai. , PNAS USA 85, 5879-5883 (1988)) . Such single chain antibodies are encompassed within the term antibody unless otherwise noted or clearly indicated by context. Although such fragments are generally included within the meaning of antibody, they collectively and each independently are unique features of the present invention, exhibiting different biological properties and utility. These and other useful antibody fragments in the context of the present invention, as well as bispecific formats of such fragments, are discussed further herein . It also should be understood that the term antibody, unless specified otherwise, also includes polyclonal antibodies, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), antibody-like polypeptides, such as chimeric antibodies and humanized antibodies, and antibody fragments retaining the ability to specifically bind to the antigen (antigen-binding fragments) provided by any known technique, such as enzymatic cleavage, peptide synthesis, and recombinant techniques. An antibody as generated can possess any isotype.\n\nThe term \"bispecific antibody\" is in the context of the present invention to be understood as an antibody having two different antigen-binding regions defined by different antibody sequences. This can be understood as different target binding but includes as well binding to different epitopes in one target.\n\nThe term \"bispecific antibody\" is in the context of the present invention to be understood as an antibody with two different antigen-binding regions (based on sequence information). This can mean different target binding but includes as well binding to different epitopes in one target.\n\nWhen used herein, unless contradicted by context, the term \"Fab-arm\" or \"arm\" refers to one heavy chain-light chain pair.\n\nWhen used herein, unless contradicted by context, the term \"Fc region\" refers to an antibody region comprising at least a hinge region, a CH2 domain, and a CH3 domain .\n\nAs used herein, \"isotype\" refers to the immunoglobulin class (for instance IgGl, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgD, IgA, IgE, or IgM) that is encoded by heavy chain constant region genes.\n\nThe term \"monovalent antibody\" means in the context of the present invention that an antibody molecule is capable of binding a single molecule of the antigen, and thus is not able of antigen crosslinking.\n\nAn \"antibody deficient in effector function\" or an \"effector-function-deficient antibody\" refers to an antibody which has a significantly reduced or no ability to activate one or more effector mechanisms, such as complement activation or Fc receptor binding . Thus, effector-function deficient antibodies have significantly reduced or no ability to mediate antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and/or complement- dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) . An example of such an antibody is IgG4. Another example is the introduction of mutations in Fc-region which can strongly reduce the interaction with complement proteins and Fc-receptors. See, for example, Bolt S et al., Eur J Immunol 1993, 23 :403-411; Oganesyan, Acta Crys. 2008, D64, 700-704; and Shields et al. , JBC 2001, 276 : 6591-6604.\n\nA \"HER2 antibody\" or \"anti-HER2 antibody\" is an antibody as described above, which binds specifically to the antigen HER2. A \"HER2xCD3 antibody\" or \"anti-HER2xCD3 antibody\" is a multispecific antibody, optionally a bispecific antibody, which comprises two different antigen-binding regions, one of which binds specifically to the antigen HER2 and one of which binds specifically to CD3.\n\nThe term \"human antibody\", as used herein, is intended to include antibodies having variable and constant regions derived from human germline immunoglobulin sequences. The human antibodies of the invention may include amino acid residues not encoded by human germline immunoglobulin sequences (e.g. , mutations introduced by random or site- specific mutagenesis in vitro or by somatic mutation in vivo) . However, the term \"human antibody\", as used herein, is not intended to include antibodies in which CDR sequences derived from the germline of another mammalian species, such as a mouse, have been grafted onto human framework sequences.\n\nAs used herein, a human antibody is \"derived from\" a particular germline sequence if the antibody is obtained from a system using human immunoglobulin sequences, for instance by immunizing a transgenic mouse carrying human immunoglobulin genes or by screening a human immunoglobulin gene library, and wherein the selected human antibody is at least 90%, such as at least 95%, for instance at least 96%, such as at least 97%, for instance at least 98%, or such as at least 99% identical in amino acid sequence to the amino acid sequence encoded by the germline immunoglobulin gene. Typically, outside the heavy chain CDR3, a human antibody derived from a particular human germline sequence will display no more than 20 amino acid differences, e.g. no more than 10 amino acid differences, such as no more than 9, 8, 7, 6 or 5, for instance no more than 4, 3, 2, or 1 amino acid difference from the amino acid sequence encoded by the germline\n\nimmunoglobulin gene.\n\nWhen used herein, the term \"heavy chain antibody\" or \"heavy-chain antibody\" refers to an antibody which consists only of two heavy chains and lacks the two light chains usually found in antibodies. Heavy chain antibodies, which naturally occur in e.g. camelids, can bind antigens despite their lack of VL domains.\n\nIn a preferred embodiment, the antibody of the invention is isolated. An \"isolated antibody,\" as used herein, is intended to refer to an antibody which is substantially free of other antibodies having different antigenic specificities (for instance an isolated antibody that specifically binds to HER2 is substantially free of antibodies that specifically bind antigens other than HER2) . An isolated antibody that specifically binds to an epitope, isoform or variant of HER2 may, however, have cross-reactivity to other related antigens, for instance from other species (such as HER2 species homologs) . Moreover, an isolated antibody may be substantially free of other cellular material and/or chemicals. In one embodiment of the present invention, two or more \"isolated\" monoclonal antibodies having different antigen-binding specificities are combined in a well-defined composition .\n\nWhen used herein in the context of two or more antibodies, the term \"competes with\" or \"cross-competes with\" indicates that the two or more antibodies compete for binding to HER2, e.g. compete for HER2 binding in the assay described in Example 14. An antibody \"blocks\" or \"cross-blocks\" one or more other antibodies from binding to HER2 if the antibody competes with the one or more other antibodies 25% or more, with 25%-74% representing \"partial block\" and 75%-100% representing \"full block\", preferably as determined using the assay of Example 14. For some pairs of antibodies, competition or blocking in the assay of the Examples is only observed when one antibody is coated on the plate and the other is used to compete, and not vice versa . Unless otherwise defined or negated by context, the terms \"competes with\", \"cross-competes with\", \"blocks\" or \"cross- blocks\" when used herein is also intended to cover such pairs of antibodies.\n\nThe term \"epitope\" means a protein determinant capable of specific binding to an antibody. Epitopes usually consist of surface groupings of molecules such as amino acids or sugar side chains and usually have specific three dimensional structural characteristics, as well as specific charge characteristics. Conformational and nonconformational epitopes are distinguished in that the binding to the former but not the latter is lost in the presence of denaturing solvents. The epitope may comprise amino acid residues directly involved in the binding and other amino acid residues, which are not directly involved in the binding, such as amino acid residues which are effectively blocked or covered by the specifically antigen binding peptide (in other words, the amino acid residue is within the footprint of the specifically antigen binding peptide) .\n\nThe term \"monoclonal antibody\" as used herein refers to a preparation of antibody molecules of single molecular composition . A monoclonal antibody composition displays a single binding specificity and affinity for a particular epitope. Accordingly, the term \"human monoclonal antibody\" refers to antibodies displaying a single binding specificity which have variable and constant regions derived from human germline immunoglobulin sequences. The human monoclonal antibodies may be generated by a hybridoma which includes a B cell obtained from a transgenic or transchromosomal nonhuman animal, such as a transgenic mouse, having a genome comprising a human heavy chain transgene and a light chain transgene, fused to an immortalized cell .\n\nAs used herein, the term \"binding\" in the context of the binding of an antibody to a predetermined antigen or epitope typically is a binding with an affinity corresponding to a KD of about 10\"7 M or less, such as about 10\"8 M or less, such as about 10\"9 M or less, about 10\"10 M or less, or about 10\"11 M or even less when determined by for instance surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology in a BIAcore 3000 instrument using the antigen as the ligand and the antibody as the analyte, and binds to the predetermined antigen with an affinity corresponding to a KD that is at least ten-fold lower, such as at least 100 fold lower, for instance at least 1,000 fold lower, such as at least 10,000 fold lower, for instance at least 100,000 fold lower than its affinity for binding to a non-specific antigen (e.g. , BSA, casein) other than the predetermined antigen or a closely-related antigen . The amount with which the affinity is lower is dependent on the KD of the antibody, so that when the KD of the antibody is very low (that is, the antibody is highly specific), then the amount with which the affinity for the antigen is lower than the affinity for a non-specific antigen may be at least 10,000 fold.\n\nThe term \"kd\" (sec-1), as used herein, refers to the dissociation rate constant of a particular antibody-antigen interaction . Said value is also referred to as the koff value.\n\nThe term \"ka\" (M 1 x sec\"1), as used herein, refers to the association rate constant of a particular antibody-antigen interaction .\n\nThe term \"KD\" (M), as used herein, refers to the dissociation equilibrium constant of a particular antibody-antigen interaction .\n\nThe term \"KA\" (M 1), as used herein, refers to the association equilibrium constant of a particular antibody-antigen interaction and is obtained by dividing the ka by the kd.\n\nWhen used herein the term \"heterodimeric interaction between the first and second CH3 regions\" refers to the interaction between the first CH3 region and the second CH3 region in a first-CH3/second-CH3 heterodimeric protein .\n\nWhen used herein the term \"homodimeric interactions of the first and second CH3 regions\" refers to the interaction between a first CH3 region and another first CH3 region in a first-CH3/first-CH3 homodimeric protein and the interaction between a second CH3 region and another second CH3 region in a second-CH3/second-CH3 homodimeric protein.\n\nThe term \"reducing conditions\" or \"reducing environment\" refers to a condition or an environment in which a substrate, here a cysteine residue in the hinge region of an antibody, is more likely to become reduced than oxidized.\n\nAs used herein, the term \"inhibits proliferation\" (e.g. referring to cells, such as tumor cells) is intended to include any substantial decrease in the cell proliferation when contacted with a HER2 antibody as compared to the proliferation of the same cells not in contact with a HER2 antibody, e.g. , the inhibition of proliferation of a cell culture by at least about 10%, at least about 20% or at least about 30%, or at least as much as a reference antibody such as trastuzumab, e.g. , as determined by an assay in the Examples, e.g. Example 16.\n\nAs used herein, the term \"promotes proliferation\" (e.g. referring to cells, such as tumor cells) is intended to include any substantial increase in the cell proliferation when contacted with a HER2 antibody as compared to the proliferation of the same cells not in contact with a HER2 antibody, e.g. , the promotion of proliferation of a cell culture by at least about 10%, at least about 20% or at least about 30%, or at least as much as a reference antibody as F5, e.g. , as determined by an assay in the Examples.\n\nAs used herein, the term \"internalization\", when used in the context of a HER2 antibody includes any mechanism by which the antibody is internalized into a HER2- expressing cell from the cell-surface and/or from surrounding medium, e.g. , via endocytosis. The internalization of an antibody can be evaluated using a direct assay measuring the amount of internalized antibody (such as, e.g. , the fab-CypHer5E assay described in Example 19), or an indirect assay where the effect of an internalized antibody- toxin conjugate is measured (such as, e.g. , the anti-kappa-ETA ' assay of Example 18) .\n\nThe present invention also provides antibodies comprising functional variants of the VL region, VH region, or one or more CDRs of the antibodies of the examples. A functional variant of a VL, VH, or CDR used in the context of a HER2 antibody still allows the antibody to retain at least a substantial proportion (at least about 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95% or more) of the affinity/avidity and/or the specificity/selectivity of the parent antibody and in some cases such a HER2 antibody may be associated with greater affinity, selectivity and/or specificity than the parent antibody.\n\nSuch functional variants typically retain significant sequence identity to the parent antibody. The percent identity between two sequences is a function of the number of identical positions shared by the sequences {i.e. , % homology = # of identical\n\npositions/total # of positions x 100), taking into account the number of gaps, and the length of each gap, which need to be introduced for optimal alignment of the two sequences. The percent identity between two nucleotide or amino acid sequences may e.g. be determined using the algorithm of E. Meyers and W. Miller, Comput. Appl. Biosci 4, 11-17 (1988) which has been incorporated into the ALIGN program (version 2.0), using a PAM 120 weight residue table, a gap length penalty of 12 and a gap penalty of 4. In addition, the percent identity between two amino acid sequences may be determined using the Needleman and Wunsch, J . Mol . Biol. 48, 444-453 (1970) algorithm.\n\nExemplary variants include those which differ from a parent antibody VH and/or VL sequence shown in Figures 1 and 2 at one or more \"variant\" amino acid positions, denoted \"X\" in the corresponding consensus sequence. Preferred variants are those in which the new amino acid is selected from those at the corresponding position in one of the aligned sequences in Figure 1 or 2 (for details on CDR sequence variants, see Table 4) .\n\nAlternatively or additionally, the sequence of VH, VL or CDR variants may differ from the sequence of the VH, VL or CDR of the parent antibody sequences mainly by conservative substitutions; for instance at least 10, such as at least 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 or 1 of the substitutions in the variant are conservative amino acid residue replacements.\n\nIn the context of the present invention, conservative substitutions may be defined by substitutions within the classes of amino acids reflected in the following table :\n\nAmino acid residue classes for conservative substitutions\n\nIn the context of the present invention the following notations are, unless otherwise indicated, used to describe a mutation; i) substitution of an amino acid in a given position is written as e.g. K405R which means a substitution of a Lysine in position 405 with an Arginine; and ii) for specific variants the specific three or one letter codes are used, including the codes Xaa and X to indicate any amino acid residue. Thus, the substitution of Arginine for Lysine in position 405 is designated as : K405R, or the substitution of any amino acid residue for Lysine in position 405 is designated as K405X. In case of deletion of Lysine in position 405 it is indicated by K405*.\n\nThe term \"recombinant host cell\" (or simply \"host cell\"), as used herein, is intended to refer to a cell into which an expression vector has been introduced, e.g. an expression vector encoding an antibody of the invention . Recombinant host cells include, for example, transfectomas, such as CHO cells, HEK293 cells, NS/0 cells, and lymphocytic cells.\n\nThe term \"transgenic non-human animal\" refers to a non-human animal having a genome comprising one or more human heavy and/or light chain transgenes or\n\ntranschromosomes (either integrated or non-integrated into the animal's natural genomic DNA) and which is capable of expressing fully human antibodies. For example, a transgenic mouse can have a human light chain transgene and either a human heavy chain transgene or human heavy chain transchromosome, such that the mouse produces human HER2 antibodies when immunized with HER2 antigen and/or cells expressing HER2. The human heavy chain transgene may be integrated into the chromosomal DNA of the mouse, as is the case for transgenic mice, for instance HuMAbÂ® mice, such as HCo7, HCol2, or HCol7 mice, or the human heavy chain transgene may be maintained extrachromosomally, as is the case for transchromosomal KM mice as described in WO02/43478. Similar mice, having a larger human Ab gene repertoire, include HCo7 and HCo20 (see e.g. WO2009097006) . Such transgenic and transchromosomal mice (collectively referred to herein as \"transgenic mice\") are capable of producing multiple isotypes of human monoclonal antibodies to a given antigen (such as IgG, IgA, IgM, IgD and/or IgE) by undergoing V-D-J recombination and isotype switching. Transgenic, nonhuman animal can also be used for production of antibodies against a specific antigen by introducing genes encoding such specific antibody, for example by operatively linking the genes to a gene which is expressed in the milk of the animal .\n\n\"Treatment\" refers to the administration of an effective amount of a therapeutically active compound of the present invention with the purpose of easing, ameliorating, arresting or eradicating (curing) symptoms or disease states.\n\nAn \"effective amount\" or \"therapeutically effective amount\" refers to an amount effective, at dosages and for periods of time necessary, to achieve a desired therapeutic result. A therapeutically effective amount of a HER2 antibody may vary according to factors such as the disease state, age, sex, and weight of the individual, and the ability of the HER2 antibody to elicit a desired response in the individual . A therapeutically effective amount is also one in which any toxic or detrimental effects of the antibody or antibody portion are outweighed by the therapeutically beneficial effects.\n\nAn \"anti-idiotypic\" antibody is an antibody which recognizes unique determinants generally associated with the antigen-binding site of an antibody.\n\nFurther aspects and embodiments of the invention\n\nAs described above, the invention relates to a bispecific antibody comprising two different antigen-binding regions, one which has a binding specificity for HER2 and one which has a binding specificity for CD3.\n\nIn one aspect, the invention relates to a bispecific molecule comprising a first antigen binding region from a HER2 antibody described herein and a second antigen binding region from a CD3 antibody described herein.\n\nIn one embodiment, the HER2 antigen-binding region is from a HER2 antibody which cross-blocks or binds to the same epitope as a reference antibody from cross-block group 1, described herein. In a specific embodiment, the bispecific antibody comprises an antigen- binding region from an antibody of cross-block group 1, as described herein.\n\nIn one embodiment, the HER2 antigen-binding region is from a HER2 antibody which cross-blocks or binds to the same epitope as a reference antibody from cross-block group 2, described herein.
