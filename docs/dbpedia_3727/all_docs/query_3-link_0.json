        "text": "For other uses, see Almere (disambiguation).\n\nCity and municipality in Flevoland, Netherlands\n\nAlmere (Dutch pronunciation: [ɑlˈmeːrə] ⓘ) is a planned city and municipality in the province of Flevoland, Netherlands across the IJmeer from Amsterdam.\n\nBordering Lelystad and Zeewolde, the municipality of Almere comprises six official areas[5] that are the districts of Almere Stad (which is further split up into Almere Stad Oost, Almere Stad West and Almere Centrum), Almere Buiten and Almere Pampus (which is currently being designed),[6] and the boroughs of Almere Haven, Almere Hout and Almere Poort. Four of them feature official district or borough offices.[7] Furthermore, it also comprises the unofficial historic district and neighborhood Oostvaardersdiep.[8][9] Almere is part of the Amsterdam Metropolitan Area (MRA).\n\nAlmere is the newest city in the Netherlands:[10] the land on which the city sits, the Southern Flevoland polder, was reclaimed from the IJsselmeer from 1959 to 1968. The first house was finished in 1976, and Almere became a municipality in 1984. It has the largest population of the municipalities in Flevoland with 214,715 citizens in 2021 and the 8th largest in the Netherlands. In October 2007, the city council of Almere made agreements with the government to expand the city to 350,000 inhabitants by 2030.[11][12]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nThe original plans for the IJsselmeerpolders saw the land being used for agriculture. However, after World War II housing was needed for the rapidly growing population of Amsterdam and two towns were planned in the polders Oostelijk Flevoland and Zuidelijk Flevoland. The town in Oostelijk Flevoland became Lelystad. The town in Zuidelijk Flevoland was still called Zuidweststad (English: South West City) on the first sketches, but in the 1970s it became called Almere, named after the lake Almere, the early medieval name of the Zuiderzee. The first house in Almere was finished in 1976. At that time the town was still controlled by the Openbaar Lichaam Zuidelijke IJsselmeerpolders (Z.IJ.P.), with a Landdrost. In 1984 Almere became an official municipality. Originally, Almere was envisioned as a town with multiple centres. This idea was later abandoned in favor of allowing neighbourhoods like Tussen de Vaarten to be built. There is also a difference between the way houses are built in the oldest and the newest parts of the city. The housing plan in Almere in the 1970s was basic functionality and a levelling of social status. However, starting in the 1990s more exclusive homes with striking designs were built (notably in the Regenboogbuurt).\n\nGovernance\n\n[edit]\n\nLocal executive\n\n[edit]\n\nHein van der Loo (independent) has been mayor of Almere since March 2023, with the municipal council consisting of a coalition of several parties.[13]\n\nList of mayors\n\n[edit]\n\n1984–1986: Han Lammers (PvdA)\n\n1986–1993: Cees de Cloe (PvdA)\n\n1993–1994: Cees Roozemond (PvdA, acting)\n\n1994–1998: Ralph Pans (PvdA)\n\n1998–2003: Hans Ouwerkerk (PvdA)\n\n2003–2003: Jaap van der Doef (PvdA, acting)\n\n2003–2015: Annemarie Jorritsma (VVD)\n\n2015–2022: Franc Weerwind (D66)\n\n2022–2023: Ank Bijleveld (CDA, acting)\n\n2023-current: Hein van der Loo (independent)\n\nMunicipal council\n\n[edit]\n\nThe first municipal council was installed on 2 January 1984 in the presence of the then-Minister of the Interior Koos Rietkerk. The council elections took place on 21 September 1983. Prior to 1984 Almere had an Adviesraad, which was chosen every 2 years (1978–1980, 1980–1982, 1982–1984). This Adviesraad was made up of different political parties similar to a local council. On 11 March 1977 the first adviescommissie was elected. It consisted of 5 people that were chosen on personal title. Since 2018, the council of Almere has comprised a total of 45 members.\n\nParty 1984 1986 1990 1994 1998 2002 2006 2010 2014 2018 2022\n\n[14] People's Party for Freedom & Democracy 5 5 7 10 12 8 7 7 5 8 6 Labour Party 10 14 9 6 9 7 12 8 5 7 4 Party for Freedom - - - - - - - 9 9 6 5 Democrats 66 1 2 7 10 5 2 1 3 6 5 4 GroenLinks 2 1 3 4 4 4 3 3 2 4 3 Leefbaar Almere - - - - - 9 4 3 4 3 3 Socialist Party - - - - - - 4 2 4 3 4 Party for the Animals - - - - - - - - - 3 3 Christian Union - - - - 1 1 2 1 1 2 2 Christian Democratic Appeal 2 3 4 3 3 4 3 2 2 2 2 Almere Partij/OPA - 1 2 2 3 2 2 - 1 1 1 Respect Almere - - - - - - - - - 1 1 Trots op Nederland - - - - - - - 1 - - - Verenigde Senioren Partij - - - - 1 1 1 - - - - Stadspartij Almere - - - - 1 1 - - - - - Centrumdemocraten 2 1 1 2 - - - - - - - Stap '84 1 - - - - - - - - - - BIJ1 - - - - - - - - - - 2 50PLUS - - - - - - - - - - 2 Forum for Democracy - - - - - - - - - - 2 DENK - - - - - - - - - - 1 Total 23 27 33 37 39 39 39 39 39 45 45\n\nInternational relations\n\n[edit]\n\nTwin cities\n\n[edit]\n\nAlmere maintains international relations with the following twin cities:[15][16]\n\nAalborg, Denmark[17]\n\nČeské Budějovice, Czech Republic\n\nHaapsalu, Estonia[citation needed]\n\nKumasi, Ghana\n\nLancaster, United Kingdom\n\nMilton Keynes, United Kingdom\n\nPort Sudan, Sudan (1986)\n\nRendsburg, Germany\n\nTainan City, Taiwan (2009)\n\nVäxjö, Sweden\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nAlmere is located in the polder of Southern Flevoland (Dutch: Zuidelijk Flevoland). It is the most western municipality of the province Flevoland. It borders with Markermeer in the west and north, Lelystad in the northeast, Zeewolde in the east, and Gooimeer in the south.\n\nAlmere consists of three boroughs and three districts (Dutch: stadsdelen), three of which are under construction.[18]\n\nName Year[19] Location Almere Haven ('Almere Harbor') 1976 Almere Stad ('Almere City') 1980 Almere Buiten ('Outer Almere') 1984 Almere Hout ('Almere Woods') 1991 Almere Poort ('Almere Gate') 2000 Almere Pampus To be constructed\n\nClimate\n\n[edit]\n\nAlmere has an oceanic climate characterized by mild to cool winters, and warm summers with fair precipitation year-round.\n\nDemography\n\n[edit]\n\nInhabitants by origin\n\n[edit]\n\n2017 Numbers % Dutch origin 118,944 54.31 Other European origin 17,380 10.91 Non-European origin 64,590 32.93 Suriname[21] 22,772 11.33 Morocco 7,871 3.92 Indonesia 5,981 2.98 Netherlands Antilles and Aruba 4,955 2.47 Turkey 3,572 1.78 Others 36,819 11.50\n\nTotal population\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Almere Haven Almere Stad Almere Buiten Almere Hout Almere Poort Almere Pampus Almere in total 1970 52 1975 47 1980 6,596 6,632 1985 21,410 17,240 1,559 40,297 1990 22,355 37,024 11,499 71,087 1995 22,376 58,816 22,740 564 104,496 2000 22,237 83,934 35,290 1,336 142,797 2005 22,590 103,560 47,358 1,366 175,008 2007 22,507 105,261 51,751 1,345 134 180,998 2016 22,037 109,863 55,663 1,678 10,920 200,812\n\nCulture\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 19 May 2004, at the instigation of Kees Kousemaker, owner of the Amsterdam comics store Lambiek, the first buildings of the Stripheldenbuurt were inaugurated in Almere. This is a district where all street names are named after famous comics characters and cartoonists.[22]\n\nSport\n\n[edit]\n\nAlmere is the home of football team Almere City FC, American football team FlevoPhantoms and the home of professional basketball team the Almere Sailors.\n\nTransport\n\n[edit]\n\nThe traffic infrastructure in Almere is recognisable because of its separate infrastructure for cycles (which, in most cases, have separate cycle paths), cars and buses (the buses drive on a separate bus lane in most parts of the city). Almere is connected to the motorways A6 and A27.\n\nRailway\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1987 Almere was connected to the national railway system (see NS) with the fully completed Flevolijn which connected Weesp to Lelystad Centrum.\n\nAlmere currently has six railway stations:\n\nAlmere Poort (opened December 9, 2012)\n\nAlmere Muziekwijk (opened May 30, 1987)\n\nAlmere Centrum (opened May 30, 1987)\n\nAlmere Parkwijk (opened on February 1, 1996)\n\nAlmere Buiten (opened May 30, 1987)\n\nAlmere Oostvaarders (opened December 12, 2004)\n\nA seasonal-use station, Almere Strand, was set up for certain events, such as Libelle Zomerweek. The station was made up of iron platforms. It was opened in May 1996 under the name Muiderzand. The station was closed after June 1996 but re-opened in June 1999 under the name Muiderstrand and closed again in July 1999. It re-opened again in 2001 under the name Almere Strand as an official seasonal-use station, meaning it was now open certain seasons every year. Because of the rapid development of the adjacent borough Almere Poort, it was decided to open an official station there (see Almere Poort), thus making the station of Almere Strand obsolete. Almere Poort station opened on December 9, 2012. Therefore, Almere Strand station was officially closed just after the summer of 2012 and its iron platforms were torn down in the weekend of October 6–7, 2012.[23] There are no remains of the station, although passengers can still see where the platforms once stood from the windows of Flevolijn trains.[clarification needed]\n\nPublic buses\n\n[edit]\n\nLocal bus lines\n\n[edit]\n\nIn Almere there are 11 bus lines which service the urban area.\n\nLine # Route Notes M1 Almere Centrum Station – Almere Haven De Marken or Almere Haven De Gouwen – Almere Haven Centrum Runs every 5 minutes Mon-Fri during daytime hours (every 7.5–15 minutes on evenings and Sundays).
