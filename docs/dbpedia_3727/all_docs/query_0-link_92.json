        "text": "Nottingham Forest are in the market for a striker, and they’ve identified Feyenoord’s Santiago Giménez as their number one target. According to 1908.NL the Premier League side are preparing an offer for the Mexican and could make a move in the coming weeks. Giménez, 23, has netted 51 times in 87 appearances for Feyenoord, making his mark as one of the best Eredivisie strikers in recent years.\n\nSantiago Giménez made the move from Cruz Azul in Mexico to Feyenoord for around €6m back in 2022. Two years later, the striker holds an estimated value of around €40m and has been on the radar of some of Europe’s biggest clubs. Last season he scored 26 goals and provided eight assists in 41 appearances as the Rotterdam club finished second in the league and lifted the KNVB Cup. Giménez played a pivotal part in Feyenoord’s 2022/23 title winning campaign as he netted 23 times.\n\nWith his current contract valid until 2027, this certainly won’t be an easy move for Nottingham Forest. But with an ambitious owner like Evangelos Marinakis and a third successive season in the top flight close to commencing, you never know what might happen at the City Ground this month.\n\nThey’ve already spent over €60m this summer on the likes of Elliot Anderson from Newcastle, Nikola Milenković from Fiorentina and Jota Silva from Vitória Guimarães, but major outgoings have helped to balance things out. A successful swoop for Santiago Giménez is certainly possible for the club."
