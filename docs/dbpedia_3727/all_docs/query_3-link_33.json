        "text": "CP-PC014: Medication related experiences of adults with learning disabilities\n\nJ. Macleod1,*, K. MacLure1\n\n1School of Pharmacy, Robert Gordon University, Aberdeen, United Kingdom\n\nBackground and objective: Learning disabilities (LD) is a term used to describe an individual who: has significant impairment of intellectual functioning; has significant impairment of adaptive functioning; and where the age of onset was before adulthood1. People with LD are known to have increased medical needs and are known to be prescribed more medication than the general population2. Little is known about their experiences with medication3. The aim of this research was to explore the medication related experiences of adults with LD using the Patient’s Lived Experience with Medicines (PLEM) conceptual model1.\n\nSetting and method: After the required ethical approval, qualitative, case-study methodology was used to explore the experiences of 10 adults with LD with medication. These adults were all living in the community in the north-east of Scotland. Data was collected through interviews, observation and review of any care provider records.\n\nMain outcome measures: Identifying:\n\nWhat medication related burden is/has been experienced by adults with LD?\n\nWhat are/have been the medication related beliefs of adults with LD?\n\nWhat is/has been the medication taking practice of adults with LD?\n\nResults: What medication related burden is / has been experienced by adults with LD?\n\nDe-sensitisation to the burden of medication is apparent\n\nAdverse effects from medication on cognitive ability, mental wellbeing, and social activity are of particular concern\n\nChanges to medication and/or routine can be challenging\n\nBurden is often transferred to carers\n\nWhat are / have been the medication related beliefs of adults with LD?\n\nCapacity and level of capability determines the beliefs of the adult with LD and the influence of others\n\nMedication is perceived to be beneficial and necessary\n\nHealth care professionals (HCPs) are seen to be the medication experts but the carers are the experts on the adult with LD.\n\nWith support and/or supervision, adults with mild LD can be enabled to self-administer.\n\nWhat is / has been the medication taking practice of adults with LD?\n\nAdults with LD are generally compliant with prescribed medication but regimens have often been optimised by carers.\n\nConclusion: Through case study methodology, this research has outlined the medication related experiences of adults with LD. This increased understanding will allow HCPs, in particular pharmacists, to better support adults with LD in relation to medication.\n\nDisclosure of Interest: None Declared.\n\nHP-PC022: Practice assessment of antibiotics combinations: more does not mean better\n\nP. Alexandrzak1,*, L. Painchart1, C. Lu1, N. Van Grunderbeeck2, B. Frimat1, C. Fournier1\n\n1Pharmacy, 2Infectious diseases unit, Centre hospitalier de Lens, Lens, France\n\nBackground and objective: To evaluate prescription practices regarding antibiotic combinations in our hospital, and their conformity towards local guidelines.\n\nDesign: Elaboration of an evaluation chart (data related to drugs were searched: indications, doses, traceability of the treatment reassessment…); 6 days of data collection in medicine and surgery units (all patients of each unit receiving more than one antibiotic were included on a given day); analysis of the antibiotic combination’s and treatment length’s conformity by a pharmacist and an infectious disease specialist.\n\nResults: 21 patients hospitalized in 10 different units were treated with at least two antibiotics. These patients received an average of 2.1 antibiotics during 7.9 days. The infection was documented for 3 (14%) patients, the 18 (86%) others were treated according to a probabilistic approach. For 18 (86%) patients, an association of antibiotics was recommended (febrile neutropenia, sepsis, aspiration pneumonia, endocarditis, bone and joint infection…); the prescribed association was consistent with the guidelines for 15 (83%) of them. An infectious disease specialist made treatment recommendations for 7 (33%) patients; all of them were in compliance with the guidelines. 17 (81%) patients received an appropriate dosing; for the 4 (19%) others, a pharmaceutical intervention was made, leading to a dose modification for 3 of them. The treatment length was > 7 days for 12 (57%) patients; for 4 (33%) of them, this treatment duration wasn’t justified. Antibiotic treatment reassessment after 48 h was indicated in the medical file for 7 (33%) patients.\n\nConclusion: This study shows deviations between professional practices and local guidelines in our hospital: unjustified antibiotic combinations, discrepancies between prescribed and recommended associations, excessive length of treatment, lack of traceability of the treatment reassessment. These results will be passed on to the prescribers to raise awareness regarding appropriate antibiotic use: antibiotics mustn’t be used as tranquilizers for physicians; an antibiotic combination must be justified and reassessed. The pharmacist’s implication must be constant: pharmaceutical interventions regarding doses, treatment lengths and 48 h reassessment are key elements for a wise use of antibiotics, a crucial issue in a time of increasing bacterial resistances.\n\nDisclosure of Interest: None Declared.\n\nHP-PC024: Medication reconciliation at admission in an orthopedic-traumatologic surgery ward: setting up, benefit and perspective\n\nA. Barbier1,*, F. Koussougbo2, N. Guénault1\n\n1Pharmacy, 2Orthopedic-Traumatologic, CH Armentieres, Armentières, France\n\nBackground and objective: Securing and optimizing patient’s care in health care institution have become major concerns in public health. Surgery wards are considered at risk of medication errors (EM), it is then interesting to strengthen the pharmaceutical presence. The objective is to implement the medication reconciliation at admission (MRA) in an orthopedic-traumatologic surgery ward (OTSW) with an evaluation of prescription discrepancies and risk factors associated to their apparition.\n\nDesign: Prospective and single-center study over 5 months. Have been included patients aged 50 or older admitted for a schedule hospitalization or by emergencies. MRA has been done retroactively. An analysis of unintentional discrepancies (NID) has been done descriptively and statistically.\n\nResults: 161 MRA done of which 123 patients admitted by emergency and 38 for a scheduled hospitalization. 70% of women and 30% of men, an average age of 77 years old and an average length of stay of 7.5 days. The average length of a MRA was 27 min. The average time between the patient’s arrival and the realization of MRA was 1.5 day. 1495 prescriptions was analyzed and 952 discrepancies identified of which 268 (28.2%) NID (average of 1.66 NID per patient). The NDI correction rate was 81%. Being admitted by emergency multiplies by 2 the number of NID (p = 0.005). The number of drugs at home also influences the NID number: taking more than 8 drugs multiplies by 2.8 the number of NID (p < 0.001). It is the same for the time between the admission and the MRA: an additional day increases the number of NID of 16% (p = 0.03). The most frequent type of NID is the stop of a drug (69%). The ATC classifications mainly aimed was cardiovascular, nervous and digestive systems. The grading of NID seriousness, made by a pharmacist-surgeon pair, shows the following distribution: 46% of minor NID, 48% of significant NID and 6% of major NID. For each additional NID on a prescription, the probability of seeing appear a significant or major g NID is multiplied by 3 (p < 0.0001).\n\nConclusion: It seems necessary to pay attention of prescription of patients admitted by emergency, especially if they have a lot of drugs in order to avoid significant or major gravity NID. NID persistence for scheduled patients shows the interest of pharmacist during the pre-anesthetic consultation. The correction rate of 81% must be considered in relation to difficulties encountered in a surgery ward (poor adhesion to MRA; frequent turn-over of anesthetists; surgeons unconcerned by the prescription of the patient’s usual treatment…).\n\nOur study shows that MRA partially helps to prevent the appearance of ME in OTSW, and has a potential effect on length of hospital stay or on rehospitalization.\n\nDisclosure of Interest: None Declared.\n\nHP-PC025: Fluconazole: «high-risk drug»?\n\nA. Bernard-Arnoux1,*, G. Rousseaux1, P. Quillet1, C. Mongaret1, M. Bonnet1, M. Legrand1, D. Hettler1\n\n1CHU Robert Debré, Reims, France\n\nBackground and objective: To secure the medical care process, a “high-risk drugs list”, defined in our establishment, is used by pharmacists to prioritize the pharmaceutical analysis of prescriptions. Due to several medication errors, we are wondering about the interest of adding fluconazole to this list.\n\nDesign: A retrospective study was conducted over 4 weeks in our university hospital (2500 beds), from computerized prescriptions or paper prescriptions including fluconazole. Demographic, clinical, biological and therapeutic data relating to the patients were collected using a structured and standardized data collection form.\n\nResults: Twenty-nine patients were prescribed fluconazole: 13 men and 16 women (sex-ratio = 0.81) with an average age of 66.7 years [16–92] and an average BMI of 24.1 kg/m2 [15.4–43.7]. 8/29 patients had impaired renal function: moderate (n = 5) or severe (n = 3) renal impairment. 9/29 patients suffered from swallowing disorders. Indications for fluconazole treatment were: systemic (n = 5), urinary (n = 6), oral (n = 6), and other or unrecorded (n = 12) candidiasis. Fluconazole was administered intravenously to 12/29 patients, 4 of whom had known swallowing disorders. 5/29 patients should receive a loading dose (indicated in systemic candidiasis) but only one received a loading dose. 5/8 patients with renal impairment had appropriate dosage according to recommendations. Only one patient (with severe renal impairment and BMI = 19.4 kg/m2) had a plasma drug monitoring (residual concentration < 80 mg/L). One case of drug interaction between fluconazole and apixaban was observed with increased risk of bleeding by increasing apixaban plasma concentrations.\n\nConclusion: Our study showed several medication errors related to fluconazole prescriptions, in particular: non-compliance with the loading dose, inappropriate route, absence of plasma drug monitoring especially for extreme weights, drug interactions. Our study highlights the importance of including fluconazole on the “high-risk drugs list” to prioritize pharmaceutical analysis of fluconazole prescriptions and promote the good prescribing practices.\n\nDisclosure of Interest: None Declared.\n\nHP-PC026: The development and reliability of a Clinical Pharmacy Triage Tool in the Emergency Department\n\nJ. Blackburn-Smith1,*, A. Lawther1, K. Hodson2\n\n1Pharmacy Department, South Eastern HSC Trust, Dundonald, 2School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Cardiff University, Cardiff, United Kingdom\n\nBackground and objective: Increasing complex patient populations have led to an increase in demand on the health service and clinical pharmacy resources. The design and development of a clinical pharmacy triage tool for use in the Emergency Department aimed to stratify patients based upon their clinical pharmacy needs in order to prioritise workload and use resources effectively.\n\nDesign: A 3-phase mixed-methods design and literature review was used to allow for data triangulation and evaluation. Initial triage tool development followed semi-structured key informant interviews, utilising action research methodology for the development of the final triage tool. Cohen’s kappa reliability methodology determined the reliability of the clinical pharmacy triage tool when used live by clinical pharmacists in the Emergency Department.\n\nResults: Data demonstrated that medication, disease and patient-centred factors are all equally important in developing a robust clinical pharmacy triage tool that can be used to stratify individual patient clinical pharmacy needs in the Emergency Department. Substantial (κ = 0.65) and almost perfect (κ = 0.86) levels of agreement demonstrated significant reliability across the team of Emergency Department clinical pharmacists when using the tool. This has led to the routine use of clinical pharmacy triage in this area; ensuring high-risk patients are seen and reviewed by a clinical pharmacist in a timely manner.\n\nConclusion: Significant reliability data has demonstrated the potential benefits clinical pharmacy triage can have in terms of prioritising patient needs and resources within the Emergency Department. Further implementation and evaluation of clinical pharmacy triage in other acute areas and wards may help redesign how clinical pharmacy services can be delivered, leading to improved patient care and safety.\n\nDisclosure of Interest: None Declared.\n\nHP-PC027: Evaluation of the management of drugs batch recalls\n\nE. Coulpier1,*, J. Courseaux1, S. Bouillon1, E. Morice1, R. Delplanque1\n\n1076, Hôpital Jacques Monod - Pharmacie, Montivilliers, France\n\nBackground and objective: The management of drugs batch recalls is the subject of a procedure to quickly manage National Agency for Medicines alerts in the pharmacy and in the units care (UC). At the pharmacy, a check-list can be used to help with the withdrawal management. The documents are archived in a binder and a computer table. To inform the UC, a standard letter with a reply card is sent to the health executives by an internal mailbox. To secure the medical treatment, we wanted to check the application and the effectiveness of the procedure.\n\nSetting and method: In order to set up a retrospective audit, three drugs recalls, which were used across the institution, were selected from those that occurred in 2017. All hospital units and the pharmacy were audited over 4 half days by a pharmacy intern and a nurse.\n\nMain outcome measures: Two collection grids were created as well as a questionnaire self-administered for the pharmacy dispensers.\n\nResults: On the three withdrawals, only 3 capsules of an impacted batch were found in the medicine cabinet of a unit despite the return of the reply card mentioning the absence of the batch. Less than 40% of the UC returned the card to the pharmacy. For these, no reminder had been sent. Regarding the transmission of information in the UC: for 68%, the health executives relayed information to the nurses who checked the presence of the batch, for 25% the executives managed the withdrawal alone, for 6% the system was unknown. At the pharmacy, none of the affected batches were found and one check-list was missing.\n\n11 out of 24 dispensers answered the questionnaire. During a drug reintegration, 82% never checked the computer list of withdrawals due to lack of time, omission or lack of knowledge of which file to check.\n\nConclusion: Following these results, several areas of improvement were identified: harmonizing the drugs labels between the alert and the medicine cabinet, simplifying the computer list, communicating the results in a management meeting to raise the awareness for all parties.\n\nA second audit round will be conducted to check the effectiveness of these actions.\n\nDisclosure of Interest: None Declared.\n\nHP-PC028: CYP2C19*17 polymorphism in stroke or transient ischemic event patients\n\nX. Díaz-Villamarín1, C. L. Dávila-Fajardo1, D. Blánquez-Martínez1, E. Leno-Durán2, A. Antúnez-Rodríguez2, M. Pérez-Campos1, I. Cano-Talavera1, R. Herrera-Trigueros1, R. Álvarez-Sánchez1,*, L. J. Martínez-González2\n\n1Clinical Pharmacy, San Cecilio University Hospital, 2Genomics Unit, GenYo, Granada, Spain\n\nBackground and objective: Clopidogrel is metabolized by the CYP2C19 isoenzyme to its active metabolite responsible for the inhibition of platelet aggregation. Different mechanisms have been proposed to explain interindividual differences on clopidogrel response, among them, CYP2C19 polymorphisms have shown the highest level of evidence in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients. The CYP2C19*17 allele is related with an ultra-rapid metabolism (UM) phenotype, this means an enzyme (CYP2C19) gain of function (GOF), so, higher clopidogrel antiplatelet effect.\n\nThe aim of this study is to evaluate the CYP2C19*17 SNP influence on clopidogrel response in stroke or transient ischemic event (TIA) patients.\n\nSetting and method: Retrospective cohort study. Patients treated with clopidogrel after stroke or TIA were recruited and dichotomized depending on their CYP2C19 gain of function (GOF; CYP2C19*17 carriers) status.\n\nMain outcome measures: The primary endpoint was the occurrence of the combined cardiovascular (CV) death, stroke or TIA, and acute coronary syndrome (ACS) during clopidogrel treatment from the recruitment until the treatment was stopped or 31st July 2017.\n\nResults: 67 patients were recruited, all of them were Caucasians, mean age 68.22 (± 9.83) and 24 (35.82%) were women. The most of them were recruited due to stroke (n = 53; 79.1%), only 14 (20.9%) because of a TIA. 19 patients (28.4%) were heterozygous and 5 (7.5%) recessive homozygous, total 24 (35.8%) CYP2C19 GOF patients. Among our patients, 11 (16.4%) presented stroke/TIA, 2 (3.0%) ACS and 1(1.5%) CV death; in total, 14 (20.8%) individuals met primary endpoint during clopidogrel treatment. Carrying the CYP2C19 GOF allele (Genotypes: CYP2C19*1/*17 or CYP2C19*17/*17) was associated to the response (OR = 0.11; 95% CI = 0.02–0.79; p = 0.012).\n\nConclusion: The CYP2C19*17 allele protects against the occurrence of major CV events.\n\nDisclosure of Interest: None Declared.\n\nHP-PC030: A retrospective regional audit of compliance with urinary tract infection: treatment guidelines in secondary care\n\nL. Hagan1,*, A. Brady1, C. Mallon1\n\n1Pharmacy Department, Belfast Health and Social Care Trust, Belfast, United Kingdom\n\nBackground and objective: Recent strategies to tackle antimicrobial resistance have identified antimicrobial stewardship as a means to encourage prudent prescribing. Furthermore, Public Health initiatives such as the Strategy for Tackling Antimicrobial Resistance (STAR 2012–2017) cite the establishment and maintenance of systems to monitor antimicrobial usage and surveillance of resistance as a key objective1. As such, this study focuses on urinary tract infections (UTI), at present the second most common indication for empirical antimicrobial treatment in both primary and secondary care2.\n\nDesign: The study is a retrospective audit across the five Health and Social Care Trusts in Northern Ireland. A total of 303 patients, with a diagnosis of uncomplicated, complicated or catheter associated UTI, were randomly selected from all patients admitted from January to August 2016. The primary aim was to assess compliance with empirical guidelines for the treatment of uncomplicated, complicated and catheter associated UTI. Secondary aims focussed on documentation of clinical symptoms, obtaining and recording of appropriate cultures and documenting intended duration or review date of antibiotic therapy.\n\nResults: Overall Trust-wide compliance with regional guidelines was 31% (n = 95). Of 303 patients reviewed 57% (n = 173) were prescribed an antibiotic compliant with regional guidelines. Two of the hospital trusts met the Trust-wide target of 95% compliance for correctly prescribed dose of antibiotic. Of 303 patients reviewed, 54% had a documented review date or duration on their Kardex and 42% (n = 129) had a documented review or duration in their medical notes.\n\nConclusion: In conclusion, none of the five Trusts met the Trust-wide agreed target of 95% compliance to regional guidelines. Based on the findings of this audit the following recommendations are proposed to improve compliance to the guidelines, promotion of the regional guidelines, revising the regional Kardex to include a dedicated section for recording intended duration of antibiotic, development of regional evidence based algorithm to aid diagnosis and classification of UTI, education for the management of asymptomatic bacteria, and education on using urinalysis and culture results to guide treatment.\n\nReferences\n\n1.\n\nDepartment of Health, Social Services, and Public Safety.

Mangé1,*, T. Barsagol1, M. Carreiro2, A. Staub2, D. Giamarchi3, V. Bassoua1\n\n1Pharmacy, 2Department of oncology, 3Department of pneumology and allergy, Centre Hospitralier Montauban, Montauban, France\n\nBackground and objective: Platinum-based chemotherapy (PC) is the standard therapy for many cancers treatment. In patients with recurrent disease and multiple lines of PC hypersensitivity may occur. The initiation of a desensitization protocol can be considered.\n\nThe objective is to assess the benefit and safety of desensitization protocol in a platinum chemotherapy hypersensitivity case.\n\nDesign: 74 years old patient with a serous carcinoma of the ovary, presented in 2004, 2008 and 2012 three episodes of clinic evolution treated by surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy (carboplatin-paclitaxel). She had two shocks suggesting to anaphylaxis during carboplatin’s administrations in 2009 (to the fifth cycle) and 2012 (to the second cycle).\n\nIn 2017 we discovered a recurrence with tumour mass of 3–4 cm and several secondary liver injuries. It’s inoperable and given the platinum sensitivity and the somatic BRCA genotype, the best therapeutic option was PC. A gemcitabin-oxaliplatin protocol was chosen during a multidisciplinary meeting, because of the cross-reactivity risk and an acute renal failure that contraindicate the cisplatin use.\n\nSkin testing with Prick Test and Intradermal Test (to carboplatin, cisplatin and oxaliplatin) performed by the allergy specialist, to recommended dilutions, were negative. But given the strong suspicion of allergy, oxaliplatin was reintroduced with 13-step desensitization procedure.\n\nThe pharmacist was involved in drafting a protocol including the preparation of three oxaliplatin solutions diluted to concentrations of 0.01 mg/ml, 0.1 mg/ml et 1 mg/ml and its establishment. Initial desensitizations are carried out in intensive care unit.\n\nResults: After 5 cycles:\n\nThe chemotherapy is well tolerated. After the third cycle, the administration is performed in a conventional unit care.\n\nThe follow-up shows a good response to the treatment. The thoracic-abdominal-pelvic scan shows a regression of liver injuries (around 20%), a stabilization of the iliac tumor and a small increase in size of adrenal tumor. The protocol is continued.\n\nConclusion: Desensitization protocol is safe and effective. The pharmacist contribution in the multidisciplinary collaboration is here significant for the establishment of a new chemotherapy protocol.\n\nDisclosure of Interest: None Declared.\n\nHP-PC032: Optimizing medication reconciliation: creation of a shared electronic tool\n\nJ.-F. Meyer1, A.-L. Mouterde2, D. Toulet3, E. Salmi2, I.-B. Balde1, S. Combaud3, C. Michel3, V. Rathouin2, R. Ratiney3, J.-E. Fontan1,*, A. Jacolot2\n\n1Pharmacy, Hôpital Jean Verdier (AP-HP), Bondy, 2Pharmacy, Hôpital Avicenne (AP-HP), Bobigny, 3Pharmacy, Hôpital René-Muret-Bigottini (AP-HP), Sevran, France\n\nBackground and objective: Medication reconciliation (MR) is an effective process for the detection of medication discrepancies during the care transitions process. Health care professionals collaborate together with the patient and his family to improve medication safety. The care transition process in our hospital group is articulated between three hospitals. MR at admission and discharge is realized for the elderly patients (> 65 years) and/or treated by chemotherapy. Pharmacy students, residents and also medicine students are actors of the process, under the oversight of a pharmacist.\n\nThe purpose of our project is the creation of a shared and secured electronic tool, not only to permit to standardize our practices and documents but also to improve the communication between our three hospitals and with the community pharmacies.\n\nDesign: The Regional Health Agency of Ile-de-France funded the project in the purpose of promoting the MR. The tool has been developed on Microsoft Access® by a medical secretary and a pharmacist. The protection of its data has been validated by the National Commission of Computing and Freedoms. The drugs database Theriaque® has been implemented. The contact information of community pharmacies are registered in the tool and permit to establish a collaborative information flow with medication information at the discharge.\n\nResults: The development lasted from January 2017 to March 2017, before the release of the first version. Personal data useful for MR (e.g. name, age, hospitalization date, reason for hospital admission, name of the community physician and pharmacist…) are contained in the database. The whole prescription is included with discrepancies detected (intentional or not) and gravity evaluation. The performing time and sources used are also informed. All information is available for every professional trained. Instructions for use and regular training sessions are established. Edition of a record of reconciliation with all information cited above is automatic. The record is incorporated in the medical record and sends to health care professionals at the discharge.\n\nConclusion: From April 2017 to March 2018, 580 prescriptions have benefited the MR at admission and 38 at discharge. 35 health care professionals (8 pharmacists, 1 pharmacy resident, 8 pharmacy students and 18 medicine students) have been trained. The development requires continued attention and is still ongoing, new versions have been developed with implementation of new features (improved ease of use, statistics of MR…). This shared electronic tool has permitted a standardization of the process of MR between the three hospitals. Shared information is primordial for security of the care process of the patient in our hospital group and with other health care professionals. The next steps would be to evaluate the effects on the quality and safety of healthcare, and then to incorporate this tool in the prescription software.\n\nDisclosure of Interest: None Declared.\n\nHP-PC033: Economic impact of biosimilar etanercept use\n\nR. Morón1, P. Nieto Gómez1, C. Garcia Fernandez1, R. Alvarez Sanchez1,*\n\n1Farmacia Hospitalaria, Hospital Universitario Clinico San Cecilio, Granada, Spain\n\nBackground and objective: The prescriptions of biologics are increasing as new indications and drugs are authorized. Since biosimilar drugs were introduced in the pharmaceutical market, they became an alternative to continue with the demand at competitive costs.\n\nTo analyse the economic impact from incorporating the biosimilar etanercept in the hospital pharmacotherapeutic guide.\n\nSetting and method: Retrospective observational study in a third level hospital. The study period goes from April 2017 to April 2018.\n\nMain outcome measures: The database are obtained for the dispensing program. The selected patients were the all patients treated with etanercept biosimilar since its incorporation into the pharmacotherapeutic guide of the hospital. The studied variable is the savings derived when using the biosimilar drug compared to the original drug.\n\nResults: The study included 30 patients from Rheumatology service. A total of 533 administrations of etanercept biosimilar were performed in the 9-month study period. The price of the biosimilar drug vial is 92.11 € whereas the original drug is 176 €, being 44,713.37 € the economic saving produced in the administration of etanercept biosimilar in 9 months.\n\nConclusion: The biosimilar drugs market is growing which leads us to conduct studies in daily clinical practice, both in terms of efficacy and safety as well as economic saving. In the study carried out in our pharmacy service, an economic advantage of the biosimilar drug against the original drug is clearly demonstrated. It is important to find efficient treatments for the public health system.\n\nDisclosure of Interest: None Declared.\n\nHP-PC034: Efficacy and safety of cinacalcet in secondary hyperparathyroidism to chronic renal insufficiency\n\nM. Prieto Castelló1,*, C. Aparicio Rubio1, S. Cornejo Uixeda1, E. Monteagudo Santolaya1, A. Sánchez Alcaraz1, B. Quintana Vergara1\n\n1Pharmacy, Hospital Universitario de la Ribera, Valencia, Spain\n\nBackground and objective: Evaluate the efficacy and safety of cinacalcet in patients with hyperparathyroidism secondary to chronic renal failure without renal replacement therapy or kidney transplantation.\n\nDesign: Retrospective observational study of patients with hyperparathyroidism secondary to chronic renal failure under treatment with cinacalcet.\n\nThe following variables were collected from the electronic medical record: age, sex, weekly dose of cinacalcet at the beginning of treatment and currently, levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH), calcium, phosphorus, albumin, creatinine and glomerular filtration at the beginning of treatment, at 12 months and 24 months after starting treatment.\n\nResults: 21 patients were included, 11 women (52.4%) and 10 men (47.6%) with an average age of 75 years (58–86). The mean weekly dose of cinacalcet at the start of treatment was 176.5 mg (60–420). Stage III renal failure was the most common (48%) followed by stage IV (33%).\n\nMean analytical values at the start of treatment with cinacalcet were: PTH = 266.4 ± 190.5 pg/ml; Ca = 10.5 ± 0.9 mg/dl; PO4- = 3.2 ± 0.97 mg/dl; Albumin = 4.3 ± 0.28 mg/dl; Serum creatinine = 1.8 ± 1.4 mg/dl and glomerular filtration = 40 ± 15.36 ml/min.\n\nThe mean dose of cinacalcet increased by 39% from the start of treatment to the end of the study.\n\nThe mean values of PTH at 12 months decreased by 19% compared to the initial value (216.4 ± 144.2 pg/ml) and 32% at 24 months (181.1 ± 55.2 pg/ml, p < 0.001). Regarding the average values of calcium, they were also reduced by 11% (9.3 ± 0.8 mg/dl) at 12 months compared to the initial value, remaining stable at 24 months (9.6 ± 0.6 mg/dl). The phosphate values remained stable during the study (3.3 ± 0.7 mg/dl at 24 months).\n\n10 patients presented adverse effects to cinacalcet. All of them were described in the technical data sheet: 50% hypocalcemia, 20% myalgia, 20% asthenia and 10% nausea and vomiting.\n\nConclusion: In our study, cinacalcet was effective for the treatment of patients with hyperparathyroidism secondary to chronic renal failure without hemodialysis, significantly reducing the PTH and calcium values.\n\nDisclosure of Interest: None Declared.\n\nHP-PC035: Hospital at home, an alternative to hospitalization: truly in practice? Example of imipenem\n\nC. Ratsimbazafy1,*, B. Mittaine-Marzac1, O. Marquestaut2, L. Havard1\n\n1Hospital Pharmacy, 2Department of Medical Information, Hospitalisation A Domicile - Assistance Publique Hopitaux De Paris (APHP), Paris, France\n\nBackground and objective: Hospital-at-home (HAH) is generally defined as a substitutive care model to hospitalization (H). The study investigated if HAH did not merely on paper but was truly implemented in practice, by taking for example patients with imipenem/cilastatine (IMP) infusion in order to define the patients’ type treated in HAH.\n\nDesign: All patients (adults, infants) in the 820 places of HAH of Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris (APHP), covering Paris and its suburb, treated with IMP—an antibiotic drug for complicated infections, restricted to hospital infusion—were analysed retrospectively from 1st/04/2017 to 31st/12/2017. Social, medical, and pharmaceutical items, as well as cost data were collected from patients’ records and billed medical charges.\n\nResults: 26 patients (males = 65%, 64 years old [17; 97], Karnofsky score = 45% [35; 55]) were treated during 27 home stays, with a mean length of stay (MLS) of 26 days [4; 88]. 25 patients had a helping person and one was isolated. 24 patients were admitted after discharged on average beyond 10 days of antibiotic treatment in H, mostly from surgery and onco-haematology wards. Antibiotic indications were sepsis or urinary tract, bronchopulmonary, and osteo-articular infections. 50% of patients carried multi-drug-resistant (MDR) bacteria. The treatment start date and treatment duration were respectively known in 15 patients, and in 8.\n\nPatients were addressed to HAH for 85% intravenous infusion, 7% palliative care, 4% pain, 4% complex care of bandages. During the stay at home, 4 patients died, 12 readmissions including 6 unscheduled occurred.\n\nHospital cost data were collected for 20 out of the 24 patients from H. Average daily costs of care were 633€ in H (MLS = 19.5 days) against 280€ in HAH (MLS = 23.9 days).\n\nOver the study period, HAH ordered 2064 units of IMP of 500 mg, which represents 1.8% of the consumption of all 39 APHP hospitals.\n\nConclusion: Despite the small size of sample, these results suggest traditional hospital care still remain “the gold standard” for the delivery of antibiotic treatment, in spite of the feasibility and the lower costs of HAH care. In practice, HAH appears to cover patients with specific clinical components: few in number, elderly, dependant patients, often carrying a MDR bacteria, after a long-term hospital stay.\n\nAdditionally, the study also revealed further progress was still necessary to improve the fight against antimicrobial resistance, such as medical and nurse staff providing valuable information needed for antibiotic treatment.\n\nDisclosure of Interest: None Declared.\n\nHP-PC036: The reliability and validity study of Turkish Version of High Alert Medications Knowledge Questionnaire\n\nB. Okuyan1, O. Ozkan1, B. Torun1, F. Ozturk1, M. Sancar1,*\n\n1Clinical Pharmacy, Marmara University Faculty of Pharmacy, Istanbul, Turkey\n\nBackground and objective: It is aim to assess the reliability and validity of Turkish version of high-alert medications knowledge questionnaire1.\n\nSetting and method: This study was conducted between December 2017 and January 2018 among healthcare professionals (18 years or older) working in a private hospital. The adapted questionnaire consisted 20 true–false knowledge items and the higher score was indicated better knowledge regarding high alert medications. After its appropriate language translation and cultural adaptation, the internal consistency by using Kuder-Richardson coefficient and test–retest reliability of the Turkish version of this questionnaire were evaluated.\n\nMain outcome measures: Reliability and validity parameters of Knowledge Questionnaire.\n\nResults: Of the 159 individuals, 91.8% (146) participated to the study and 24% were males. 69.9% of the participants were nurses, 2% were pharmacists and 28.1% were technicians. The mean age of the participants was calculated as 25.40 ± 5.16 (19–56). Test–retest reliability was confirmed (0.527; p < 0.01) and internal consistency reliability that was assessed by using Kuder-Richardson 20, was acceptable (Cronbach’s α = 0.815). Of them, 65.1% agreed to have ‘sufficient’ knowledge and 63.7% hope to acquire more training about high-alert medication. In addition, there is a statistically significant correlation between the number of participants who agreed to have ‘sufficient’ knowledge about high-alert medication and their total knowledge scores (p < 0.01). Advanced age and increased in professional experience were statistically correlated with higher knowledge regarding high alert medications (p < 0.001).\n\nConclusion: As a result of this study, it was determined that the Turkish version of the questionnaire is valid and reliable scale to assess health-care professionals’ knowledge towards high-alert medications.\n\n1Hsaio GY, Chen IJ, Yu S, Wei IL, Fang YY, Tang FI.

Simona1,*, S. Negres2\n\n1Pharmacy Department, Bucharest University Emergency Hospital, 2Pharmacology and Clinical Pharmacy Department, University of Medicine and Pharmacy “Carol Davila” Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania\n\nBackground and objective: When a patient with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) cannot tolerate disease modifying therapy (DMT), or there is unacceptable breakthrough disease activity, the most common approach is to change drug. All have side effects, and none are cure.\n\nNo universal guidelines exist for switching therapy and choices of clinicians on this matter are often based on observational reports and guided by good clinical practice.\n\nThe variety of DMT available in our hospital (5 different first-line therapies and only one for second-line), allows treatment switch, based on reccomendation.\n\nObjective is assessing safety, switch causes for each DMT, which drugs are less likely to follow discontinuation.\n\nSetting and method: Retrospective observational study was conducted from January 2017 to March 2018, including patients with the following DMT:\n\nInterferon like:\n\ninterferon beta1-a and beta1-b,\n\nglatiramer acetate (GA),\n\nnatalizumab,\n\nand teriflunomide,\n\nMain outcome measures: Variables collected: average age at diagnosis, sex, previous treatment, reason for changing treatment, EDSS, presence of antibodies against JC virus, adverse drug reactions, mean duration of disease. The data from the patient monitoring file reffers to: clinical examination every 3 months, paraclinical investigation:brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)—every year and laboratory investigation.\n\nResults: 149 patients with a median exposure to medication 8.83 years (1–19 years), 97 women, mean age at diagnostic 32 (14–63 years), mean baseline EDSS = 1.97 (0–6).\n\nDuring the follow-up period, no changes were observed in treatment in more than half of the patients (53.5%).\n\nPatients that switched treatment (46.5%): 39.5% once, 7%, at least twice and despite treatment, 11 patients (16%) evolve to a progressive form-SMSP with relapses and/or active MRI.\n\nGlatiramer was the least likely to follow discontinuation.\n\n3 patients had temporary interruption during pregnancy.\n\nThe main reason for changing DMT was lack of efficacy, other reasons were injection-site reactions, persistent flu-like symptoms, clinical activity and only one patient had safety issues- high-risk for PML, with anti-JCV index above 1.5 and long natalizumab exposure (5 years) was withdrawn, switched to glatiramer after a short “drug holiday”.\n\nConclusion: The overall goal of switching MS therapies is to balance the risks posed by the medications to the risks posed by the disease, though prognosticating long-term outcomes in MS is difficult.\n\nIndividual response to DMTs varies significantly across patients (within and between subjects) and the risk of serious adverse events represent an issue, particularly for the newest agents, so the main challenge facing clinicians and patients remains choosing a course of personalized treatment, considering all factors.\n\nDisclosure of Interest: None Declared.\n\nCP-PC016: Pharmacist prescribing and care improves cardiovascular risk, but what do patients think? A sub-study of the RxEACH study\n\nY. N. Al Hamarneh1,*, S. lamb1, M. Donald2, K. King-Shier2, C. Jones3, B. Hemmelgarn2, C. Mitchell4, R. Tsuyuki1\n\n1University Of Alberta, Edmonton, 2University of Calgary, Calgary, 3University of British Columbia, Kelowna, 4Patient Partner, Grand Prairie, Canada\n\nBackground and objective: The Alberta Vascular Risk Reduction Community Pharmacy Project: RxEACH, was a randomized trial which demonstrated that a community pharmacy-based case finding and intervention program (including prescribing, laboratory testing, and follow-up) reduced the risk for cardiovascular (CV) events by 21% when compared to usual care.\n\nObjective: To evaluate patient perceptions regarding pharmacist prescribing and care in patients at high risk for CV events.\n\nSetting and method: All participants who took part in RxEACH received an invitation letter. Those who took part in the interviews provided verbal consent.\n\nParticipants were asked to provide their opinions about:\n\nThe care they received from pharmacists.\n\nCommunication between patients, pharmacists and family physicians.\n\nSuggestions for sustainability.\n\nInterviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim. Three reviewers (including one patient who did not participate in RxEACH) analyzed and coded the data independently.\n\nMain outcome measures: Patient perceptions regarding pharmacist prescribing and care in patients at high risk for CV events.\n\nResults: Data saturation was achieved after interviewing 14 participants. Half of whom were male and approximately two-thirds were older than 60.\n\nThe following themes were identified:\n\n(i)\n\nPatient-pharmacist relationship: Participants highlighted the importance of having a strong relationship with the pharmacist, indicating that could enhance their level of comfort with the pharmacist. They also felt that pharmacists truly cared about them as people.\n\n(ii)\n\nHealthcare system characteristics: The majority of the participants supported expanded scope of practice and identified it as an opportunity to fill healthcare gaps highlighting easy accessibility, high quality and timeliness of pharmacist services.\n\n(iii)\n\nPatient reaction: Participants were extremely satisfied with the care they received and reported that they felt empowered when pharmacists encouraged them to take responsibility for their own health.\n\nConclusion: Patients are highly supportive of an advanced scope of pharmacy practice which includes prescribing, follow-up, and remunerated care. Our inclusion of a patient in the analyses provided a unique perspective.\n\nDisclosure of Interest: None Declared.\n\nCP-PC017: Implementing online pharmaceutical care services based on web-based pharmacy care setting: a retrospective pilot study\n\nA. H. Al-Taie1, Z. K. Yilmaz2,*\n\n1Pharmacy Department, Osol Aldeen University College, Baghdad, Iraq, 2Clinical Pharmacy Department, Faculty of Pharmacy-Marmara University, Istanbul, Turkey\n\nBackground and objective: Pharmaceutical care services (PCSs) are extremely valuable for patients related outcomes. Implementation of web-based pharmacy care and thereby different online PCSs could have the potential to promote better access to information by patients and providers, improve the quality and safety of patients and encourage healthier lifestyles. The aim of this study was to exhibit the esential role of the pharmacist through the provision of different PCSs that could be conducted via an online platform as a new modernized pharmacy practice.\n\nSetting and method: A retrospective pilot observational study was carried out on patients during their website visiting to İlaçpedia (https://www.ilacpedia.com/) seeking pharmacists with more in-depth health and medication knowledge regarding different medical conditions. This website is considered as an online drug information and patient counselling service platform regarding healthcare topics, discussions and medication care services in Turkey. Suitable customized online PCSs were provided to patients who considering İlaçpedia for health and medication consultancy and detailed information regarding patient’s demographic, health and medication status were collected.\n\nMain outcome measures: Impact of pharmacist care intervention via web-based pharmaceutical care setting offered through different trends of online PCSs including disease–related trends (DRTs) and medication-related trends (MRTs).\n\nResults: A total of 57 participants were included with a mean age of 33.70 years constituting 27(47.4%) males and 30(52.6%) females. 29(50.9%) patients were cigarette smokers. A total of 83 medical conditions encountered with endocrine conditions (n = 23, 27.7%) followed by CNS conditions (n = 20, 24%), dermatologic disorders (n = 14, 16.9%) and cardiovascular conditions (n = 11, 13.3%) were the most common medical conditions observed. Among these, acne (n = 11), hypertension (n = 8), anxiety disorders (n = 7) and DM (n = 6) were the most reported diseases. Number of medications being used by the participants were (130) medicines representing (n = 120) orally administered and (n = 8) topically administered medicines alongside (n = 7) supplementary medications. Regarding adverse drug reactions (ADRs) patients reported to pharmacist was (no. of ADRs = 36; no. of suffering patients: n = 27; 47.4%). Among the most common ADRs observed was those related to CNS (n = 13, 36.1%) and skin (n = 10, 27.8%). Different many trends of PCSs were provided to patients (n = 348) including DRTs [disease condition and general health information: n = 57, 16.4%; smoking habits control: n = 27, 7.8%] and MRTs [proper medication information: n = 55, 15.8%;proper dosage selection: n = 57, 16.4%;proper treatment duration: n = 56, 16.1%;refilling of prescription: n = 45, 12.9%;presence of medication side effects: n = 25, 7.2% and proper drug alternative: n = 7, 2%].\n\nConclusion: The results of this study clearly support the pivotal and effective role of the community pharmacist as a patient-centred healthcare provider and the intriguing trend of web-based pharmacy care for the provision of different PCSs as another mode of community pharmacy practice.\n\nDisclosure of Interest: None Declared.\n\nCP-PC018: Patterns of patients’ reliance of online health and pharmaceutical care services as an alternative implemented platform of pharmacy practice\n\nA. H. Al-Taie1, Z. K. Yilmaz2,*\n\n1Pharmacy Department, Osol Aldeen University College, Baghdad, Iraq, 2Clinical Pharmacy Department, Faculty of Pharmacy-Marmara University, Istanbul, Turkey\n\nBackground and objective: The increasing prevalence of diseases is proportionally correlated with the growing body of health services that could successfully redesign care systems to meet the patients’ needs. Different models of healthcare services could be performed by pharmacists that would match pharmacy practice to provide more advanced disease management and medication care services. The aim of this study was to assess the trends of patients’ knowledge of online pharmaceutical care (PC) setting alongside types of health and medication care services introduced by the community pharmacists based upon online PC platform.\n\nSetting and method: A retrospective pilot observational study was carried out on patients during their website visiting to İlaçpedia (https://www.ilacpedia.com/) seeking pharmacists with more in-depth health and medication knowledge regarding different medical conditions. This website is considered as an online drug information and patient counselling service platform that provides patients with comprehensive information regarding healthcare topics, discussions and medication care services in Turkey. Suitable customized online PCSs were provided to patients who considering İlaçpedia for health and medication consultancy and detailed informationfor patient’s demographic, health and medication status were collected.\n\nMain outcome measures: Trends of patients’ knowledge of online PC and types of health and pharmaceutical care services offered by the community pharmacist via online services.\n\nResults: A total of 57 participants were included with a mean age of 33.70 years constituting 27(47.4%) males and 30 (52.6%) females. 29(50.9%) patients were cigarette smokers. Regarding educational level, majority of participants visiting the website had well education level (53,93%) presenting as 21(36.8%) and 32(56.1%) patients having secondary and university education level respectively. Regarding the reaching mode of this online pharmacy service, 43(75.4%) patients had a recognition via own self-seeking followed by 8(14%) via friends and/or relatives. Types of health and pharmacy care services relied upon issues related to medications, health, and lifestyle (a total of 96 services were provided) including medication-related issues (n = 57, 59.4%) followed by health-related issues (n = 21, 21.9%) and lifestyle-related issues (n = 18, 18.7%). The number of times participants visiting this online pharmacy service were in a step up ordering [one time = 25 (44%); 2–3 times = 20(35%); 4–5 times = 5(8.7%); 6–10 times = 3(5.3%); > 10 times = 4(7%)]. A total of 83 medical conditions were encountered with endocrine conditions (n = 23, 27.7%) followed by CNS conditions (n = 20, 24%), dermatologic disorders (n = 14, 16.9%) and cardiovascular conditions (n = 11, 13.3%) were the most common medical conditions observed.\n\nConclusion: The above findings provide compelling evidence that patients particularly those with well education level had a high, intensive assessing and reliability of online pharmaceutical care services as another phase of community pharmacy care setting to help manage different health and medication care concerns.\n\nDisclosure of Interest: None Declared.\n\nCP-PC019: Assessment of attitudes and practice of Turkish community pharmacy staff regarding skin problems using virtual patient profiles\n\nS. Apikoglu-Rabus1,*, I. Kahya2, M. Serin2, P. Yildiz2\n\n1Clinical Pharmacy Department, 2year-5 Student, Marmara University Faculty Of Pharmacy, Istanbul, Turkey\n\nBackground and objective: Skin problems are commonly encountered in community pharmacies. A considerable amount of patients come to the pharmacies with symptom-related requests for advice. In this study we aimed to assess Turkish pharmacy staff’s self-reported counseling practices and attitudes regarding skin problems using virtual patient profiles.\n\nSetting and method: The study was conducted at 100 community pharmacies located in Istanbul. Pharmacy staff that agreed to participate in the study completed a questionnaire, which was structured to elicit their demography, professional experience, counseling practices and attitudes regarding skin problems. This study utilized paper-based virtual patient profiles representing 5 different skin problems: dermatitis, athlete’s foot, diaper rash, acne and psoriasis. Each staff was requested to act as if they were counseling with the patients identified in three virtual patient profiles. Brief information about and a high-resolution photo of the condition were provided to the staff. More information about the virtual patient was only provided if the staff asked for it by specific questions. Attitudes were measured by questions with 5-Likert answer choices as: “totally agree, agree, neither agree nor disagree, disagree and totally disagree”.\n\nMain outcome measures: The rate of counseling on various aspects of the skin problems and the rate of correct attitudes.\n\nResults: The study was conducted on 100 pharmacy staff (76 pharmacists and 24 pharmacy technicians); 53% was male and the mean age was 42.72 (12.57). They have been practicing at the community pharmacy for 17.65 (10.93) years and serving a median (min–max) of 30 (3–300) patients/week with skin problems. The pharmacy staff completely agreed or agreed that the reason of the patients’ visiting the pharmacy in order to receive advice for their skin problems were “high availability of pharmacy staff (97%), familiarity with pharmacy staff (97%), advice with no cost (95%), triage (89%), reassurance (84%). On the other hand only 23% of pharmacy staff completely agreed or agreed that “they lack dermatologic knowledge”. When the counseling practices of the pharmacy staff were assessed, it was seen that 41% of the pharmacy staff asked for detailed information from the patient and 79% defined the disease/condition correctly, while only 40% recommended the correct product and 22% provided correct information on how to use the product. When the overall approach to the cases were assessed it was seen that only 23% of the pharmacy staff followed the most correct way (i.e. “Takes detailed patient history, defines the condition, recommends a product, provides patient education” or “takes detailed patient history, defines the condition, refers to the physician” depending on the case).\n\nConclusion: Our results showed that although the pharmacy staff think that they have enough dermatology knowledge, they were only able to show their knowledge while identifying the problem; they need to receive more education on product selection and product information.\n\nDisclosure of Interest: None Declared.\n\nCP-PC020: Opinions of the Syrian patients about the effect of language barriers on the quality of pharmacy services received and about the use of pictograms\n\nS. Apikoglu-Rabus1,*, R. Barri1, A. Alsaleh1, R. Muhammad Umar2\n\n1Clinical Pharmacy Department, Marmara University Faculty of Pharmacy, 2Clinical Pharmacy Department, Istanbul Medipol University Faculty Of Pharmacy, Istanbul, Turkey\n\nBackground and objective: Since the beginning of the Syrian conflict, over 3,5 million Syrians have fled their homes and been living in Turkey. Although, the government covers all health care costs including the medications of the refugees, lack of language skills is a major problem limiting the utilization of quality health care both at hospitals and at community pharmacies. This study aimed to investigate the opinions of the Syrian patients about the effect of language barriers on the quality of pharmacy services received at community pharmacies and about the usefulness of pictograms.\n\nSetting and method: The study was conducted at three community pharmacies where medications of the Syrian refugees were provided according to a contract. All Syrian patients who visited these pharmacies during a week’s time were informed about the study and invited to participate. All participating patients were asked to fill in an Arabic questionnaire asking for demographic data and opinion about the effect of language barriers on the quality of health-care and pharmacy services. An example of pictogram use (i.e. Voltaren retard ®; with five pictograms as ‘for back pain; to be taken in the morning; to be taken on full stomach, to be taken one tablet at once; should not be crushed, broken and chewed’) was shown to the patients and their opinion about the usefulness of the pictogram was questioned.\n\nMain outcome measures: Opinions of the participants about the effect of language barriers on the quality of pharmacy services and about the usefulness of pictograms.\n\nResults: Fifty-three patients [mean (SD) age = 32 (13.15) years; 78% male] participated in the study. Vast majority (93%) of the participants were refugees and they have been living in Turkey for 3.58 (1.16) years; 28% were primary-school graduates and 34% were secondary school graduates; 44.4% were working. Forty-seven percent of the patients totally agreed or agreed that incompetency in Turkish language skills negatively affect the pharmacy services they receive from community pharmacies. More than half of the patients totally agreed or agreed that they receive enough information about the correct use of their medications (69%) and warnings and side effects of their medications (61%). Majority (80%) totally agreed or agreed that they would have used their medications more correctly if they had received instructions by the use of pictograms. In general (91%) they reported that they were satisfied by services they received from the community pharmacies.\n\nConclusion: The language problem seems to be a barrier for the Syrian patients to receive the best quality pharmacy services. Use of pictograms while instructing on medication use would help the non-native speakers receive the most relevant information and result in the correct use of the medications.\n\nDisclosure of Interest: None Declared.\n\nCP-PC022: The experience of people with type 2 diabetes being cared for by their community pharmacist in Ireland\n\nP. Cooney1, J. Hanley1, N. Ryan-O’Brien1, H. Okada2, M. Bermingham1,*\n\n1School of Pharmacy, University College Cork, Cork, Ireland, 2EPICORE Centre, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada\n\nBackground and objective: The Future Pharmacy Practice in Ireland report recommends expanded pharmacy-based services for people with type 2 diabetes.1 These services may include structured patient education, adherence monitoring, medication use review and supplementary prescribing. The aim of this study is to evaluate the experience of people with type 2 diabetes being cared for by their community pharmacist in Ireland, which may inform expansion of pharmacy services to this patient group.\n\nSetting and method: Questionnaire (adapted from Stewart et al.2) was administered in seven Irish community pharmacies. Participants were type 2 diabetics, aged ≥ 18 years. Participants were asked five “yes or no” questions about their medications and then scored 13 statements on a five-point Likert scale (strongly disagree = 1 to strongly agree = 5).\n\nMain outcome measures: Likert scale responses for each statement were summarised as frequencies and percentages. The mean (± standard deviation) score for each item was calculated.\n\nResults: Data were available for 125 participants, average age 65.7 ± 12.4 years and 74 (59.2%) were male. Oral hypoglycaemic therapy was prescribed to 123 (98.4%) participants, parenteral hypoglycaemic agents to 15 (12.0%) participants and insulin products to 20 (16.0%) participants. The statement that participants most frequently agreed with was “I am totally satisfied with my visit to this pharmacist” (agree/strongly agree = 99.2%, mean score 4.9 ± 0.4). There was also strong agreement with the statement “I would recommend seeing a pharmacist to other people” (agree/strongly agree = 95.2%, mean score 4.7 ± 0.7). A high proportion of participants (81.6%) agreed/strongly agreed with the statement “It is easier to get to see the pharmacist than the doctor” (mean score 4.3 ± 1.1); 19.2% of patients disagreed with the statement “I am more comfortable discussing medication-related issues with the pharmacist than my doctor” (mean score 3.5 ± 1.2) and 85% of participants disagreed or strongly disagreed with the statement “Some things about my consultation with the pharmacist could have been better” (mean score 1.7 ± 1.1).\n\nConclusion: In this Irish community-based cohort, participants with type 2 diabetes reported a high level of satisfaction with the care provided to them by their pharmacist. This augurs well for implementation of expanded community pharmacy services for this patient group.\n\nReferences\n\n1.\n\nPharmaceutical Society of Ireland.

Boag1,*, A. C. Boyter2, K. MacLure3, S. Cunningham3, G. Akram2, H. McQuillan4, D. Stewart3\n\n1Robert Gordon University/University of Strathclyde, Aberdeen, 2University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, 3Robert Gordon University, Aberdeen, 4Community Pharmacy Scotland, Edinburgh, United Kingdom\n\nBackground and objective: The Minor Ailment Service (MAS) in Scotland has provided free treatment via community pharmacy, for those eligible, for self-limiting conditions since its inception in 2006. MAS is a source of free expert advice and treatment which is readily available with no need for an appointment. This service contributes to the national enhancement of healthcare: improving access to services and minimising health inequalities. In 2016/17 over 2 million over-the-counter products were prescribed by pharmacists on MAS costing £4.9 Million. However, there is no information on the experiences of service users at a national level. A national evaluation is therefore planned in the latter part of 2018. The aim of this study is to gauge project feasibility, test the planned data collection and handling of the full scale project, and to obtain an expected response rate.\n\nSetting and method: Five community pharmacies across Scotland were selected for the pilot study on the basis of deprivation and locations. Each pharmacy was provided with 25 study packs containing an initial questionnaire. Those service users who returned the initial questionnaire were mailed a follow-up questionnaire.\n\nMain outcome measures: The initial questionnaire included items on: previous use of MAS, presenting condition, expectations, reasons for using MAS, perceived privacy, planned use of other healthcare service(s), perceptions of consultation and views of pharmacist care (Consultation and Relational Empathy: CARE) and self-reported quality of life. The follow up questionnaire determined: perceived effectiveness of treatment, other sources of treatment, further use of MAS and self-reported quality of life.\n\nResults: Of the possible 125 questionnaires a total of 52 were distributed in a 1 week period. Pharmacies in the least deprived areas distributed the fewest study packs (n = 11), while the most deprived areas distributed the most (n = 41). Of the 52 questionnaires distributed 14 were returned completed: a response rate of 27%. The pilot responses informed questionnaire development with minor changes in layout to increase response rate, and reduction in open ended questions which were rarely completed. Responses from the pilot questionnaires provide positive indications regarding MAS experiences but lack the statistical power to provide representational results. The pilot study has however provided the framework for the full scale study.\n\nConclusion: The full study will distribute 10 study packs from every community pharmacy in Scotland within a 2 weeks period. Given the number distributed in the pilot, this should be achievable. Using the pilot response rate the full project should return in excess of 3000 questionnaires. The full study will provide national patient experience of MAS, allow quantification of the transfer of care to community pharmacy from other healthcare services and service users perception of effectiveness.\n\nDisclosure of Interest: None Declared.\n\nCP-PC024: Services provided by pharmacists in Swiss nursing homes\n\nL. D. Brühwiler1,*, A. Niederhauser1, L. Fishman1, D. L. Schwappach1,2\n\n1Patient Safety Switzerland, Zürich, 2Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine (ISPM), University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland\n\nBackground and objective: Drug-related problems are frequent among nursing home (NH) residents. A designated pharmacist may detect and solve these problems, e.g. by reviewing residents’ medications. The collaboration with a pharmacist in Swiss NH may however, due to heterogeneous regional regulations, vary widely. Therefore, we sought to analyse how often NH collaborate with a designated pharmacist and how widespread services e.g. medication reviews by pharmacists are. In addition, we aimed to examine in what types of NH medication reviews by pharmacists could further be disseminated.\n\nSetting and method: Online survey to directors of nursing in all Swiss NH with ≥ 10 beds (n = 1525). Chi2-test was used to examine the association between categorical variables.\n\nMain outcome measures: Percentage of NH with a designated pharmacist (NH-P), frequencies and types of pharmaceutical services in NH-P, characteristics of NH where pharmacists don’t provide medication reviews.\n\nResults: 420 (27.5%) questionnaires were returned. 81.8% of NH collaborate with a designated pharmacist (329 NH-P among 402 NH). Pharmacists provide an array of different services, but with variable dissemination. Medication reviews by a pharmacist are provided in 40.7% of NH-P. In those NH-P, self-reported satisfaction with medication review processes was higher (79.1% satisfied) than in NH-P where pharmacists don’t provide medication reviews (59.0% satisfied, p < 0.001).\n\nWe found that medication reviews by pharmacists were less frequently provided in NH mainly collaborating with independent general practitioners (30.3%) than in NH mainly collaborating with employed physicians (45.8%, p < 0.05). Furthermore, there was an association with the NH’s region: Pharmaceutical reviews were less frequent in regions where self-dispensing of medications by physicians is permitted, i.e. most German-speaking regions (23.8%) than in regions where this is prohibited (49.3%, p < 0.001). There was no association between the provision of medication reviews and number of beds, total number of physicians per NH and organisation type.\n\nConclusions: A majority of Swiss nursing homes collaborate with a designated pharmacist, but provided services by pharmacists vary. NH in the German-speaking part of Switzerland who collaborate with general practitioners could be targeted to disseminate pharmacist involvement in medication reviews in order to improve medication safety.\n\nDisclosure of Interest: None Declared.\n\nCP-PC025: Pharmaceutical care for the institutionalized patient in nursing homes\n\nC. Campabadal1,*, F. Bejarano1, N. Marco2, L. Palacios3, D. Ferrer-Vidal4, L. Canadell1\n\n1Pharmacist, 2Administrator, 3Care Director, 4Director, Hospital Joan Xxiii Tarragona, Tarragona, Spain\n\nBackground and objective: Guarantee comprehensive and quality pharmaceutical care for institutionalized patients in nursing homes (NH) based on equity, safety, efficiency and effectiveness.\n\nDesign: The pharmacist evaluates the pharmacotherapeutic plans (PTP) of all residents. The review consists of an evaluation of the indication, effectiveness, safety, Stopp-Start criteria, drug based on evidence, follow-up of the pharmacotherapeutic guide, efficiency, dose correction and guidelines. Once the evaluation is completed, the Pharmacotherapeutic Advisory Commission (CAP), created by the management and formed by the doctors and nurses of the NH and the team and the pharmacist, meets. The CAP evaluates in a multidisciplinary way the pharmacotherapeutic plans and consensual changes in medication. Once the medication changes are agreed upon, they are proposed to the patient or their relatives. The changes are applied in the different computer programs.\n\nResults: In the 6 months of the project this has been implemented in 8 of the 26 NH of the territory. 402 PTPs have been reviewed, representing 22% of patients. Some incidence has been found in 85.8%. A total of 697 drugs were reviewed, of which 47.02% had an incorrect indication and 30% required clinical assessment by the CAP. Of the incidences present in the PTP, 86.3% was an innecessay drug, followed by a drug not recommended in geriatrics (4.17%), duplicity (2.36%), patient with 2 or more benzodiazepines (0.34%) and others. Of the proposals made by the pharmacist the majority was to suspend the drug (84.12%), change by therapeutic equivalent (9.75%), decrease dose (4.74%), start a treatment (0.84%) and others. 94% of the proposals made by the pharmacist have been accepted. Of the 6% of the proposals not accepted, 60% is due to the NH doctor, 30% to the patient/family member and 6% to the team doctor. An annual theoretical saving of € 79,813 is estimated with 22% of the patients reviewed. This represents an average decrease of 24.8% of the annual turnover per residence.\n\nConclusion: Pharmaceutical care for institutionalized patients in nursing homes contributes significantly to an improvement in the quality of the pharmacotherapy prescription.\n\nDisclosure of Interest: None Declared.\n\nCP-PC026: Pharmaceutical care for patients with renal insufficiency and treatment with oral antidiabetics\n\nC. Campabadal1,*, F. Bejarano1, N. Marco2, L. Palacios3, D. Ferrer-Vidal4, L. Canadell1\n\n1Pharmacist, 2Administrator, 3Care Director, 4Director, Hospital Joan Xxiii Tarragona, Tarragona, Spain\n\nBackground and objective: Provide the safest and most suitable treatment in patients with chronic renal failure and in treatment with oral antidiabetics.\n\nDesign: All patients with chronic kidney disease (using Cockroft-Gault formula) who were taking oral antidiabetic drugs were listed. The glomerular filtration and type of drug data were crossed based on the glomerular filtration value from which the drug requires a dose adjustment or is contraindicated, so that only those patients who a priori needed a dose adjustment in their treatment were reviewed.\n\nThe review carried out by the Pharmacy consists of the last glycated hemoglobin of the patient with date of analysis, the last glomerular filtration of the patient and the current treatment with oral antidiabetics.\n\nThe patients controlled by endocrinology were reviewed jointly with the doctor responsible for the patient.\n\nPersonalized reports for each patient were sent to their responsible physician, enclosing recommendations for change in the proposed treatment of Pharmacy.\n\nResults: We reviewed 60 patients with an average age of 77 ± 9.9 years, with an average glomerular filtration rate of 43 ± 13.8 mL/min/1.73 m2.\n\nThe 60 patients had an average of 2 ± 0.84 drugs. This entails that a total of 144 treatments have been reviewed.\n\nOf the 144 treatments reviewed, 54 (37.5%) were contraindicated due to the glomerular filtration of the patient and 14 (9.72%) required a dose adjustment, the rest of the treatments were indicated based on glomerular filtrated.\n\n16 patients were commented toghether with endocrinology service.\n\nOf the 60 emails sent, in 20 (33.3%) patients the recommendations issued by pharmacy have been followed, 4 (6.66%) patients have a normalized renal function that does not need dose adjustment of the antidabetic treatment and 36 (60%) patients are waiting to make the changes.\n\nThis revision is made 20 days after sending the mails.\n\nConclusion: An exhaustive review of oral anti-diabetic treatments is necessary in patients with chronic renal insufficiency to ensure safety in their treatment.\n\nDisclosure of Interest: None Declared.\n\nCP-PC027: Exploring the potential for improved community pharmacy breastfeeding support—expectations and priorities of breastfeeding parents and community pharmacists\n\nD. M. D’Arcy1,*, R. Duignan1, S. McCarthy2, M. C. Henman1\n\n1School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Trinity College Dublin, Dublin, 2School of Pharmacy, University College Cork, Cork, Ireland\n\nBackground and objective: Although the World Health Organisation recommends exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months with continued breastfeeding up to 2 years of age or beyond, breastfeeding rates in the Republic of Ireland (RoI) are among the lowest recorded. The accessibility and health promotion role of the community pharmacy in the RoI suggest potential for community pharmacy based breastfeeding support. Furthermore, there is potential to better explore the full pharmaceutical care needs of this patient cohort.\n\nSetting and method: This was an academic study separately surveying community pharmacists (CPs) and breastfeeding parents as stakeholders (SHs). A subsection of the survey is presented, based on suggested services relating to (a) pharmaceutical care of the breastfeeding patient (e.g. medication safety, nipple care, mastitis, timing of feeds and medication) and (b) other services potentially available from the community pharmacy (e.g. advice on breast pump selection, breastfeeding support information and the pharmacy environment). Respondents indicated which advice and services they would (i) currently expect and (ii) ideally (for breastfeeding support) expect from a community pharmacy. For the CP group, current expectations were determined by whether the services were available in their current community pharmacy workplace, or whether they had recently given advice on listed topics.\n\nMain outcome measures: Description of service expectations in the current vs ideal setting in CP and SH cohorts and comparison between cohorts.\n\nResults: 50 CPs and 158 SHs responded to the surveys. The highest proportion of respondents in both cohorts expected advice on medication safety while breastfeeding, in both current and ideal settings. The rank order of expectations was similar for both cohorts, and high ideal expectations not achieved in current practice were evident. A notable difference (40%) between current and ideal expectations related to the provision of general information on breastfeeding support and support groups (SH group), and the provision of practical advice around expression, storage and feeding of expressed milk along with identification and treatment of mastitis (CP group). Of interest, the proportion of SH respondents ideally expecting a comfortable place to breastfeed in the pharmacy which is not necessarily a private space was higher than the CP group, a greater proportion of whom ideally expected to offer a private space. The promotion of breastfeeding as the norm in all interactions with the breastfeeding mother or their representative was expected by a higher proportion of the SH cohort than the CP cohort in current (53% CPs; 73% SHs) and ideal (63% CPs; 91% SHs) scenarios.\n\nConclusion: Expectations are rightly high in both CP and SH groups with respect to advice on medicines use while breastfeeding. Priority actions CPs could take to offer a more supportive environment for breastfeeding parents include promotion of breastfeeding as the norm, provision of information on local breastfeeding support and a comfortable area to breastfeed in the pharmacy.\n\nDisclosure of Interest: None Declared.\n\nCP-PC028: A pharmacist-delivered smoking cessation program in Qatar: a qualitative exploration of pharmacists’ and patients’ experiences and perceptions with the program\n\nM. S. El Hajj1,*, A. Awaisu1, S. A. S. Sheikh Ali1, N. Kheir2, R. Shami1\n\n1Qatar University College Of Pharmacy, Doha, Qatar, 2The University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand\n\nBackground and objective: Tobacco use is one of the major preventable causes of death and diseases in Qatar and globally. There is a great opportunity for pharmacists practicing in Qatar to promote tobacco cessation. An intensive pharmacist-delivered smoking cessation program was designed and implemented in 8 primary care pharmacies in Qatar. This study aimed to qualitatively explore the experiences of pharmacists and patients who were involved in the program, to elucidate their perceptions of the barriers and facilitators to implement the program, and to identify the strategies needed to improve it.\n\nSetting and method: The study used an exploratory qualitative study design that employed semi-structured interviews of a random sample of patients and pharmacists who participated in a pharmacist-delivered smoking cessation program in Doha, Qatar. The interviews with pharmacists were conducted face to face in meeting rooms at Qatar University College of Pharmacy. Due to the difficulty of bringing patients to the university campus, the interviews with patients were conducted over the phone. Interviews were facilitated using a designed peer-reviewed semi-structured interview guide. The interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim with the use of the recorder’s notes. Transcripts were reviewed many times by the study team, and a code list was generated based on emerging patterns. A thematic approach of data analysis was used.\n\nMain outcome measures: Experiences of pharmacists and patients who were involved in the program, their perceptions of the barriers and facilitators to implement the program, and their perceived strategies needed to improve it.\n\nResults: Eight pharmacists and 22 patients were interviewed. Five preliminary themes emerged. The first theme described the experiences with the program, including the role of the pharmacists, the program benefit on patients, and the program impact on pharmacists’ skills. The second theme addressed the barriers to implementing the program including: lack of time, lack of patient commitment and motivation, and cultural barriers. The third theme identified the facilitators including: peer and management support, organized program structure, the use of tools, and the availability of free medications. The fourth theme outlined the smoking cessation strategies used by the pharmacists including: pharmacologic medications and behavioral modifications, use of role models, and continuous follow-up with patients. The fifth theme included strategies to improve the program including: improving the pharmacist training workshop, expanding the pharmacist-delivered smoking cessation program, improving the program facilities and tools, and increasing the program publicity.\n\nConclusion: The program was perceived to be beneficial in helping patients quit smoking, and it positively contributed to advancing the role of pharmacists in Qatar. The study findings can guide the development of successful pharmacist-led smoking cessation programs in Qatar.\n\nDisclosure of Interest: None Declared.\n\nCP-PC029: Patients ‘ experiences with and attitudes towards generic substitution\n\nA. G. Granas1,*\n\n1School of Pharmacy, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway\n\nBackground and objective: Generic substitution was introduced in Norway in 2001. Generics has been met with skepticism by some patients and health professionals. Pharmacy staff spend a lot of time explaining the implications of generic substitution to patients. In this study, we aim to explore if patients ‘ information needs were met by physicians and pharmacy staff, and if socio-economic conditions affect the attitudes and experiences of patients.\n\nSetting and method: Randomly selected community pharmacies in Oslo, Norway: one pharmacy from each of the 15 city districts. Five pharmacy students interviewed patients. All pharmacy customers were asked by to participate, and those fulfilling inclusion criteria were included. Data was analyzed on SPSS.\n\nMain outcome measures: Experiences with and attitudes towards generic substitution.\n\nResults: We collected the 534 questionnaire from pharmacy customers. Of these, 74.5% of patients reported high trust in generic drugs, and 80% accepted generic substitution when this was offered by pharmacy staff. However, they reported knowledge of generic drugs. Trust in generics was lower for polypharmacy patents. One in four patients reported that changes in the look of the tablet or packaging made it more difficult to manage their medicines. One in three patient reported that changes in the names of medicines made it more difficult to manage their medicines. One in five had experienced a decline in effect and 13% have experienced new or more side effects. One in six experienced better effect and one in ten had fewer side effects from the generic drug. Patients ‘ attitudes to generics as more positive if they have received information about generics from their doctor. Respondents with higher level of education was more positive to generic substitution, whereas elderly were more skeptical to change.\n\nConclusion: Lack of knowledge about generic drugs affects patients’ attitudes towards generic substitution. More information from physicians about the generic switch can potentially increase the degree of the acceptance of the patients.\n\nDisclosure of Interest: None Declared.\n\nCP-PC030: Do community pharmacists address sexually transmitted infections during a consultation on emergency hormonal contraception? A focus group discussion\n\nM. Haag1,*, N. Wittwer1, K. E. Hersberger1, I. Arnet1\n\n1Pharmaceutical Care Research Group, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland\n\nBackground and objective: Since 2002, emergency hormonal contraception (EHC) is dispensed as Pharmacists only medicine in Switzerland. Increased access to EHC did not lead to increased risky sexual behavior of EHC users. Nevertheless, the rate of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) has steadily increased in Western countries. Chlamydia is the most commonly reported STI affecting mainly young people ≤ 25 years i.e., those who are most likely to need EHC. A tick box in the official Swiss EHC protocol indicates that to inform EHC users about the risk of contracting STIs is optional. We aim to assess factors that influence community pharmacists to address STIs during a consultation on EHC.\n\nSetting and method: Community pharmacists around Basel were invited by phone calls to participate in a focus group discussion if they had experience in dispensing EHC. A set of 8 questions was developed about STI counseling during a EHC consultation. Factors were gathered with open questions, and yes/no voting was used to prioritize them. Strong consensus was defined as identical answers but one (91.7%). The discussion was audio recorded and logged by two members of the research team. Verbatim transcription and data analysis were performed using MAXQDA.\n\nMain outcome measures: Factors that trigger STI counseling during EHC consultation with emphasis on chlamydia.\n\nResults: A focus group discussion was performed on the 20th March, 2018 in Basel with 12 community pharmacists (age 26–59 years; experience 2–33 years; 9 women). Participants reported to inform every EHC user about STIs, but especially when they (a) were young (b) would often change sexual partner, or (c) would require EC several times (unanimity). Implicit statements are mostly used such as “You know that…”. Attention is not expressly drawn to chlamydia.\n\nConclusion: Community pharmacists regard as their duty to inform EHC users about STIs. However, general statements are enumerated in a cautious way. Whether this strategy contributes to safer sexual behavior and ultimately to containment of STIs needs further investigation.\n\nDisclosure of Interest: None Declared.\n\nCP-PC031: Attitudes of polymedicated patients towards generic drugs in Switzerland\n\nT. L. Imfeld-Isenegger1,*, V. Albert1, K. E. Hersberger1\n\n1University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland\n\nBackground and objective: In Switzerland generic drug substitution is not mandatory. Pharmacists are allowed and encouraged to substitute and they receive a small compensation of lost margin. Generic drug substitution may decrease costs in the health care systems, however the use of generic drugs also poses multiple challenges for patients. We aimed to assess the attitudes of polymedicated patients towards their own generic drugs.\n\nSetting and method: Fifth-year pharmacy students of the University of Basel reported a medication review (medication history + patient interview) during their internship in community pharmacies. Patients with ≥ 4 drugs taken during 3 months, with at least one generic drug and one drug from ATC group C (cardiovascular system) were eligible. In addition, students performed structured interviews using open-ended and closed questions about knowledge on and attitudes towards generic drug substitution.\n\nMain outcome measures: Patients’ awareness of generic drugs in their therapy, perception of specific aspects, and attitudes towards drug substitution.\n\nResults: The medication review including the interview was conducted with 136 patients (median age 74 [range 49–91], 58.8% male). Patients’ medication lists comprised 9.94 drugs (range 4–26). More than a quarter (27.9%) of the interviewed patients were not aware of having a generic drug in their medication list. Asked about their perceptions (multiple answers possible) 29.1% of the patients could not attribute any advantage, whereas the price was mentioned as advantage by 67.7%. The majority of the patients (77.4%) prefer generics, if they would get a new drug prescribed.\n\nConclusion: In a setting without mandatory generic substitution, patient counselling on generic drugs is important to improve patient’s awareness, to address potential advantages and to achieve improved rates of generic drug use through shared decision making.\n\nDisclosure of Interest: None Declared.\n\nCP-PC032: Measurement of knowledge levels of hypertensive patients\n\nE. Karatas Kocberber1,*, G. Ozen2, O. Bilgin3, B. S. Uydes-Dogan2\n\n1Clinical Pharmacy Department, 2Pharmacology Department, Faculty of Pharmacy, Istanbul University, 3Faculty of Pharmacy, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey\n\nBackground and objective: The incidence of hypertension increases steadily with the increase in expected life span. The prevalence of hypertension was found to be 33.7% in a study in Turkey. The lack of a rational treatment plan increases cardiovascular risk and can lead to serious complications. For this reason, it is very important to educate patients with hypertensive disorders, to teach blood pressure measurement correctly and to train self-monitoring.\n\nSetting and method: This prospective study was conducted in a total of 100 hypertensive patients were randomly selected from patients coming to the pharmacy for prescription. Patient information was collected via the questionnaire of rational drug use in the treatment of hypertension. The questionnaire is designed to measure the level of knowledge about patients’ treatment of hypertension.\n\nMain outcome measures: The purpose of the study is to measure the knowledge level of hypertensive patients.\n\nResults: 68% of the participants were female, 32% were male. Patients were taken to study at different levels of education. Only 28% of the patients measure the blood pressure correctly at all stages. The question with the most incorrect answer (60%) is sitting position in the measurement of hypertension. The most correct answer has given is (84%) not to speak during the measurement. 80% of the patients are satisfied with the education given by the pharmacist. In 20% of the patients, the reasons why patients are not satisfied with the education are that Pharmacist’s information is insufficient (67.85%), pharmacist is not in the pharmacy (14.28%), the communication skills of pharmacist are insufficient (10.71%), the pharmacist is very busy (7.14%). There is a significant negative correlation (p < 0.05) between the level of education of the patients and the training they have received from Doctors, Pharmacists and Pharmacy technicians.\n\nConclusion: The pharmacist plays an important role in increasing the patient’s level of knowledge, increasing treatment adherence, and training in progressive self-monitoring methods, such as blood pressure measurement.\n\nDisclosure of Interest: None Declared.\n\nCP-PC033: Opportunities and challenges with direct-to-consumer genetic tests in personalised care\n\nY. Kiselev1,*, C. Johannessen Landmark1, A. Baftiu2\n\n1Programme for Pharmacy, OSLOMET - Oslo Metropolitan University, 2Norwegian Medicines Agency, Oslo, Norway\n\nBackground and objective: Direct-to-consumer genetic tests (GTs) have been gaining global popularity in recent years, while personalisation of care is widely seen as an approach in securing effective and safe treatment. The aim of this literature analysis was to investigate medical and legal challenges with the use of GTs for improved pharmacy care.\n\nDesign: A search was performed in PubMed and Google Scholar from January 2010 to March 2018. Peer-reviewed original articles and reviews in English were included. EUR-Lex and Lovdata.no databases were used to identify relevant regulations in EU and Norway.\n\nResults: GTs can be purchased at pharmacies or ordered by mail. The former are usually marketed as diagnostic tests for specific conditions like lactose intolerance, indicative towards individual’s metabolic or athletic properties. In Norway several GTs were previously available at pharmacies but were unexpectedly retracted for the market. In several EU countries GTs are currently sold at pharmacies, including paternity tests. GTs are also available for ordering online, and usually include information on predisposition to common diseases, carrier status for hereditary conditions, response to medications and geno-geographic origin. The largest provider claims to have more than 3 million customers. Publications suggest that GTs may be a valuable instrument to secure rational pharmacotherapy by early identification of risks for serious adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and by enabling choice of therapies most likely to succeed in a patient with a given genotype. The major technological disadvantage of most GTs is that only panels of SNPs are sequenced, which reduces the costs but limits the coverage. Interpretation of GTs is complicated by the deficient scientific evidence and lack of competence among medical professionals. There is little evidence that taking GTs will actually provide health benefits or safer treatment. Transmission of personal genetic data to private companies is worrisome. Among the EU countries legislation is diverse from virtually banning GTs to fully permitting them. In Norway the sale of GTs is not regulated by law but testing of children is forbidden.\n\nConclusion: Most published studies deal with validity of GTs, bioethics, and legislation. Major challenges with GTs are deficient scientific evidence, low public and professional literacy in genomic health, and vague regulation of GTs. There is a lack of scientific proof for cost-effectiveness of GTs in relation to health outcomes. GTs may contribute to personalised choice of treatments, reduction of ADRs, early diagnostics, and better health awareness, but progress is necessary in validating GTs and elaborating regulations.\n\nDisclosure of Interest: None Declared.\n\nPC034: Professional services in Norwegian community pharmacies, with focus on a possible new service for patients with migraine\n\nT. Krogstad1,*, L. M. Vhile Hanssen2\n\n1Natural Sciences and Health, 2Oslo Metropolitan University, Oslo, Norway\n\nBackground and objective: The community pharmacies in Norway have been through major changes during the last 10–20 years. The last 2 years the Norwegian Government has approved several professional services that pharmacists, mainly those working in community pharmacies, offer to patients. Examples are guidance of inhalation of patients with asthma or Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, new medicine service and vaccination.\n\nIn this study we wanted to investigate the pharmacists´ perception of these established services and a suggested service for patients with migraine.\n\nSetting and method: Ten pharmacists from different pharmacies near Oslo, the capital of Norway, were recruited by phone. They were interviewed personally with a semi-structured questionnaire. All the three major pharmacy chains were represented.\n\nMain outcome measures: To investigate the pharmacists´ perception of the established services in Norwegian pharmacies and a suggested service for patients with migraine.\n\nResults: Most of the pharmacists were satisfied with the services they offer. The patients are also satisfied, they said. The informants were not just offering the services for the income of the pharmacy; they really wanted to help the patients. They are especially gratified with the guidance of inhalation of patients with asthma or Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. When it comes to vaccination, the informants are divided in two parts: the pharmacists who have offered this service for a while were much more positive than the pharmacists who were not offering this service yet. Although migraine patients is an important patient group in the pharmacy, only half part of the informants gave information and other advice, and asked if the migraine patient was satisfied with the medication, how did they use the medicine and so on.\n\nLess than 50% of the informants demonstrated use of the different formulations, due to lack of knowledge. The recruited pharmacists were positive to a professional service for the migraine patients.\n\nConclusion: The pharmacists that participated in this study were positively oriented to professional services in the pharmacy. Not only for helping the patients to use their medicines more correctly, but also for using more of their knowledge. They were warmly welcoming of a similar service for migraine patients.\n\nDisclosure of Interest: None Declared.\n\nCP-PC035: An evaluation of mental health clinical pharmacist prescribers within primary care medical practices in NHS Highland\n\nK. Maclure1,*, D. Stewart1, E. Buist2, R. McLelland2, A. MacLure1, S. Cunningham1, K. Macaskill2, K. Gibson Smith1, G. Rushworth2\n\n1School of Pharmacy and Life Sciences, Robert Gordon University, Aberdeen, 2NHS Highland, Inverness, United Kingdom\n\nBackground and objective: A pilot has been conducted during which a specialist mental health clinical pharmacist prescriber (SMHCPP) consulted with patients by appointment at one of two GP Practices. The aim of this study was to evaluate the SMHCPP delivered pharmaceutical care to patients with anxiety disorders and/or depression in NHS Highland.\n\nSetting and method: Both pharmacists handed out a study pack to patients. Patient study packs included a questionnaire based on the CARE Measure plus 5-point Likert scale attitudinal statements all subject to statistical analysis. Ethical approval had been gained.\n\nMain outcome measures: Patient satisfaction measured with the validated CARE scale.\n\nResults: Eleven of 70 surveys were returned (response rate 16%) with an even gender split. Most were employed (n = 9). Wellbeing was good (n = 3), fair (n = 6) or poor (n = 2). All (n = 11) thought the pharmacist excellent at ‘making you feel at ease’, ‘really listening’, ‘being interested in you as a whole person’, ‘showing care and compassion’, ‘being positive’, ‘explaining things clearly’. Most said the pharmacist was excellent at ‘letting you tell your story’ (n = 10), ‘fully understanding your concerns’ (n = 10), ‘helping you take control’ (n = 9) and ‘making a plan of action with you’ (n = 8). All (n = 11) strongly agreed/agreed they were ‘confident that a pharmacist will prescribe as safely as a GP’ also that they wanted their ‘pharmacist and doctor to work together to make sure I am receiving the best treatment’. However, ‘given the choice, I prefer to consult a GP rather than a pharmacist’ half (n = 5) were unsure, some strongly agreed (n = 1)/agreed (n = 1) but others strongly disagreed (n = 2)/disagreed (n = 2).\n\nConclusion: Overall, this small sample from a difficult to reach population were positive about care they received from the SMHCPP.\n\nDisclosure of Interest: None Declared.\n\nCP-PC036: Development of a tool to support community pharmacy engagement with patients who may be homeless\n\nK. Maclure1,*, K. Gibson Smith1, V. Paudyal2, D. Stewart1\n\n1School of Pharmacy and Life Sciences, Robert Gordon University, Aberdeen, 2Institute of Clinical Sciences, School of Pharmacy, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom\n\nBackground and objective: Homelessness remains a global public health concern. A prior survey indicated the need for pharmacist training and coverage of the topic of homelessness around minimising impact of medicines use, referring for social support, confidence in broaching the subject with patients, support and guidelines for practice.\n\nPurpose\n\nTo further explore community pharmacists’ views on the need for, type and content of a tool to support their engagement with patients who may be homeless.\n\nSetting and method: A semi-structured interview schedule was developed based on existing literature, survey results and theoretical frameworks (Theoretical Domains Framework; COM-B model) Community pharmacists from England and Scotland who had taken part in a survey consented to take part in a follow-on, digitally recorded telephone interview. Each was transcribed then coded using a framework approach. Ethical approval had been gained.\n\nMain outcome measures: Community pharmacist views on the need for and content of a tool to support engagement with patients who may be homeless.\n\nResults: Interviews (n = 15) conducted November–December 2017 found all participants felt capable and were motivated to improve their approach when engaging with patients who may be experiencing homelessness. They welcomed the opportunity to contribute to the content and format of a support tool. They also thought the topic should be better covered at undergraduate and continuing professional development. Some suggested role play to improve confidence and all felt capable if provided with up-to-date information on local homelessness support services.\n\nConclusion: Community pharmacists are capable, motivated and have the opportunity to better engage with patients considered to be homeless. However, this was a small cohort and further research is indicated to inform support tool design.\n\nDisclosure of Interest: None Declared.\n\nCP-PC037: Pharmaceutical care in pediatric patients, knowledge attitudes and practices of community pharmacists in Jordan\n\nT. L. Mukattash1,*, M. Qudah1, I. Alshammari1\n\n1Department of Clinical Pharmacy, Jordan University of Science and Technology, Irbid, Jordan\n\nBackground and objective: Advances in paediatric medicine, increasing complexities of childhood disease, and unique dosing and pharmacokinetic challenges all support a growing need for skilled and experienced pharmacists in pediatric pharmacy. The aim of this study was to determine pharmacists’ perceived knowledge and expertise required to make recommendations regarding selected pediatric topics.\n\nSetting and method: The questionnaire was developed after an extensive literature review of studies that assessed healthcare professionals’ knowledge of pediatrics. The questionnaire was assessed for face and content validity by being sent to a panel of experts and was the piloted among 20 pharmacists.\n\nAfter obtaining the required administrative and ethical approvals, the questionnaire was distributed to 1460 pharmacists practicing in community and hospital settings. The questionnaire explored their perceived knowledge, expertise, and comfort in providing recommendations related to different pediatric topics.\n\nThe questionnaire consisted of four sections: (1) Demographics (2) Perceived knowledge of pediatric treatment and dosing (3) Real life pediatric cases (4) Future aspirations to enhance pediatric pharmacy.\n\nMain outcome measures: A total knowledge score was calculated by summing the correct answers for each case, creating a scale of zero to ten, where 10 is the highest knowledge score and zero was the lowest knowledge score.\n\nResults: Of 1460 questionnaires, 1000 questionnaires where complete and returned (68.5%). The majority of respondents (76%) practiced in a community setting. The majority of respondents reported that more than 30% of their patients were pediatrics. In general, respondents had a good perception of their knowledge and expertise to make recommendations for the frequently occurring conditions among pediatric patients. Work experience and peer influence had the most influence on their knowledge in pediatrics.\n\nThe majority of respondents scored an average knowledge score in pediatric knowledge (64.6%), while 26.3% had a low knowledge score, and only 9.1% of respondents had a good knowledge score in pediatrics. This was highly influenced by holding higher education degrees, specifically in clinical pharmacy, and being working in a hospital setting.\n\nConclusion: The present study sheds the light on an alarming lack of knowledge in pediatric treatments amongst community and hospital based pharmacies in Jordan. Though pharmacists reported high confidence in their ability to work with this age group, knowledge scores highlighted how deficient their pediatric knowledge is.\n\nPediatric pharmacy certification, specialized postgrad"
