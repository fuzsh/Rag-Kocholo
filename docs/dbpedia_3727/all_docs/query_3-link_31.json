        "text": "Wolves have completed the loan signing of Manchester City midfielder Tommy Doyle.\n\nDoyle, 21, has joined the Wolves on an initial loan deal until the end of this season, with the West Midlands side holding a £5m option to buy. City will receive 50 per cent of any profit Wolves make if they sell the 21-year-old.\n\nIt is expected that Wolves midfielder Matheus Nunes' move to City will be confirmed later today, with the 25-year-old Portuguese to move to Manchester for €62m.\n\nDoyle spent last season on loan at Sheffield United, helping them earn promotion to the Premier League.\n\nNewcastle United are optimistic that centre-back Sven Botman has not suffered a serious injury to his ankle ligaments after last weekend’s 2-1 loss to Liverpool.\n\nThe Netherlands international limped off late in the second half after going down in the opposition penalty area, with centre-back an area in which Newcastle lack depth. Their options are to play club captain Jamaal Lascelles or shuffle over left-back Dan Burn to central defence.\n\n“He’s had a scan on the ankle,” head coach Eddie Howe said on Botman. “The scan didn’t appear too good, so there’s definitely an injury there, but it actually doesn’t present too bad.\n\n“It’s very bruised, a little bit swollen, so he’s been very lightly jogging this week. We’re going to see how it is today and make a decision for this weekend.”\n\nOn whether Botman could still make Saturday’s squad against Brighton, Howe added: “There’s a small chance.”\n\nJoelinton is another injury doubt after suffering a niggle in his knee against Liverpool.\n\n“Again, (he’s) another player that we're going to make a late decision,” said Howe. “He hasn't trained this week, very similar to Sven. He's done some light jogging, he feels better with each day. We'll make a late call.”\n\nNottingham Forest have completed the signing of Nuno Tavares on loan from Arsenal.\n\nThe deal includes a £12m option to make the move permanent.\n\nTavares, 23, is a former Portugal under-21 international and came through the ranks at Benfica, before signing for Arsenal in the summer of 2021. He has made 17 starts and 11 substitute appearances for Arsenal in all competitions, scoring one goal.\n\nTavares picked up valuable experience in Ligue 1 during a loan spell at Marseille last season, where he made 29 starts and eight sub appearances in all competitions. He also demonstrated more attacking threat in France, where he scored six goals.\n\nHe will add valuable competition to the left-back role and will wear the No 3 shirt at the City Ground.\n\n“I’m really happy to stay in the Premier League as it’s the best league in the world and I thank Forest for giving me the opportunity,” he said.\n\nAdditional reporting: Jordan Campbell\n\nSekou Mara is set to remain at Southampton despite interest from Lille and Werder Bremen this summer.\n\nMara was close to joining Werder Bremen on loan yesterday and Lille showed interest last night, but Southampton have decided to keep the 21-year-old striker as they want to develop him at St Mary's rather than send him out on loan. He is expected to be given opportunities in the first team this season.\n\nThe decision to keep Mara comes despite the impending signing of fellow striker Ross Stewart from Sunderland.\n\nMara joined Southampton from Bordeaux last summer in a deal worth €13million (£11.1m). However, he failed to fully adjust to life at St Mary's, scoring two goals and providing three assists in 33 games last season.\n\nThe striker has made three appearances for Southampton this season, most recently coming on as a substitute during his side's 2-1 victory over Queens Park Rangers last Saturday.\n\nChelsea have completed the signing of Cole Palmer from Manchester City.\n\nCity will receive an initial £40million ($50.7m) with £2.5m due in potential add-ons.\n\nPalmer, 21, has signed a seven-year deal at Chelsea, with the option for a further 12 months.\n\n\"I’m excited to get started and it feels great to sign,\" said Palmer. \"I’ve joined Chelsea because the project here sounds good and because of the platform I will have to try to showcase my talents.\n\n\"It is a young and hungry squad and, hopefully, we can do something special here.\"\n\nA product of City's academy, Palmer has made 19 appearances in the Premier League and a further 22 in additional competitions.\n\nEverton striker Tom Cannon is set to undergo a medical at Leicester after the two clubs agreed a deal worth around £7.5million.\n\nThe academy graduate has attracted interest from several Championship clubs this window, having spent the second half of last season on loan at Preston North End.\n\nCannon scored eight goals in 20 Championship appearances for Preston and has featured once off the bench for Everton this term.\n\nThere may be further Goodison Park exits on deadline day in addition to Cannon, with Everton and Fulham still in talks over a deal for Alex Iwobi. The winger's contract is set to expire next summer.\n\nDemarai Gray is also attracting late interest from Lille after a move to Saudi side Al Shabab stalled.\n\nNottingham Forest have agreed a deal with Chelsea to sign Callum Hudson-Odoi.\n\nThere remains a few minor issues for the player to resolve with the London club, but Forest are hopeful that the deal will quickly progress today.\n\nThe 22-year-old winger would fill the void left by Brennan Johnson, if he is sold today, with negotiations continuing with Tottenham and continued interest from Chelsea, Atletico and one or two other clubs.\n\nSteve Cooper’s side are also expected to formalise the completion of the loan signing of Nuno Tavares, the speedy left-back, from Arsenal, which was expected to go through yesterday.
