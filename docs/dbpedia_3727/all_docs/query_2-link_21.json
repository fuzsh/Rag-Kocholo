        "text": "The inclusion of Cricket in the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics is the biggest news of the year. After 128 years, the sport will make its appearance at the biggest quadrennial multi-sport event in the world. It has been a long cherished dream of cricket fans to see the sport featured at the Olympics. None of us were born when Cricket was last played at the Olympics in 1900 in Paris, when France and Great Britain competed against each other over two days, with the latter team winning the Gold medal. Since then, Cricket has been absent from the Olympics, not even as a demonstration sport, until the official announcement of its inclusion in the quadrennial multi-sport event in Los Angeles in 2028. Since the Olympics is much bigger than the Cricket World Cup, it will serve as a platform for the sport to cater to a larger audience and further its global image beyond the cricketing world. Cricket already has its reputation of being one of the most followed sports in the world. The sport will have to leverage its popularity effectively to appeal to the masses beyond the cricketing world at the 2028 Olympics. The world witness a new era of cricket in Los Angeles in 2028. #Olympics #CricketatOlympics #Cricket #IndianCricket #2028LosAngelesOlympics #2028Olympics\n\nRugby League State of Origin returns to the Melbourne Cricket Ground tonight for the first time in 6 years. The intense state rivalry between Queensland and NSW is often referred to as Australia's greatest sporting rivalry and generates plenty of excitement and passion among players and fans. It is the envy of many sports and has grown into a commercial machine for the National Rugby League. I've been lucky enough to attend the last two series in Sydney and Brisbane and there isn't anything quite like it. According to our Gemba data: üèâ Interest in SOO has grown 17% in Australia in the last 3 years with over 34% of Australians interested üèâ 20% of Victorians are passionate about State of Origin compared to 43% in NSW and 46% in QLD üèâ Interestingly, almost 5% of Australians don't follow NRL but say they are fans of State of Origin Game 1 at Accor Stadium in Sydney was the highest-rating game since 2016, drawing an average national audience of 3.4 million viewers across Nine‚Äôs linear TV network and its streaming platform 9Now. Over 77,000 people attended. Game 2 tonight is expecting over 80,000 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. If Queensland win tonight it will be their third series win in a row. Whereas, a NSW win will see the series tied at 1 - 1 making Game 3 at Suncorp Stadium in Brisbane the decider and a much better commercial outcome. #stateoforigin #nrl #queenslandrugbyleague #nswrugbyleague #sportsbusiness #sportsdata\n\nNew York City is gearing up to host a high-stakes showdown between India and Pakistan during the 2024 T20 World Cup, set to take place in the West Indies and the USA. Preparations are underway for the construction of a brand-new stadium facility in Eisenhower Park, located 30 miles east of New York City. This facility will span an impressive 930 acres in East Meadow. Initially, the International Cricket Council (ICC) had plans to build a similar facility in Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx. However, local residents in the vicinity of the park and a local cricket league operating out of the park strongly opposed the idea, leading the ICC to abandon the project. Subsequently, the ICC swiftly engaged in negotiations with Nassau County, the administrators of Eisenhower Park, and successfully reached an agreement. This development will increase the number of floodlight-equipped, international-standard cricket facilities in the USA to three. Presently, there is a 15,000-seat stadium in Dallas used for the inaugural season of Major League Cricket, as well as Central Broward Park in Miami. The successful hosting of the 20 matches assigned to the USA for the 2024 T20 World Cup is a top priority for the ICC. Moreover, the prospect of Los Angeles hosting the 2028 Olympics further underscores the importance of this event. It is expected that this successful cricket event will instill confidence in the International Olympic Committee to consider including cricket as one of the sports in the upcoming Olympics. The USA represents the largest sports market globally. Despite having a relatively nascent international cricket team and a league system only a few years old, the media rights for ICC tournaments in the USA are believed to be among the top four in terms of their dollar value. #IndvsPak #newyork #T20WorldCup #trending #trendingnow #trending2023 #trendingnews #wisetoknow #pakistan #pakistannews #arynews #humnews #bolnews #bolnewsheadquarter #pakistanicelebrities #pakistan #pakistanicelebrities #pakistanshowbiz #arydigital #humtv #geo #pakistanfashion #pakistanstyle #theblogtab #Dubai #india #bollywood #pakistan\n\nüèè Hit it out of the park, or maybe not üèè Many of us are still buzzing from the nail-biting India vs. Pakistan match this Sunday. It was an exhilarating game and a perfect victory, but it also raised questions about the pitch's unpredictability at Nassau County Cricket Stadium in New York. üèüÔ∏è After an IPL season with average scores around 200, a total score of 119 seemed disappointing. A perfect example of the weight those 22 yards hold in this sport! ü§î So, what‚Äôs special about the pitch at Nassau County? The pitch used in Nassau County is technically called a drop-in pitch. This turf traveled across the world: grown in Adelaide, shipped to Florida, and finally driven to New York. ‚úà Drop-in pitches are commonly used in Australia and New Zealand. These modular pitches are assembled in trays and then dropped into a rectangular pit in the middle of the ground. This allows the pitch to be easily removed for other sports when cricket is not in season ‚Äì and this makes total sense for countries where solely erecting cricket stadiums is not the most profitable move owing to less frequent matches and less revenue potential per match. However, a drop-in pitch is ultimately a living and breathing thing that needs its own time to acclimatize to a new environment and needs to be broken in a couple of times before it's ready for use. On the contrary, ten pitches were transported to New York as late as April and four of the best were used for the match, while the rest became practice pitches nearby. The shortest format of cricket requires batsmen to hit out from the start. When the bounce, pace, and deviation of the pitch are uncertain, it‚Äôs a nightmare. New Yorkers, accustomed to seeing home runs by the Yankees, might be disappointed if they don‚Äôt witness many sixes in this tournament. üèèüí• Do you think the ICC took a hasty decision in giving a green signal for the match in New York? Let me know what you think! #Cricket #IndvsPak #NassauCounty #DropInPitch #CricketLovers #SportsScience #T20Cricket #WorldCup\n\nKarma Never Forgets an Address: England's 2023 World Cup Crumble Four years ago, the cricketing world witnessed an unforgettable spectacle as England emerged victorious in a dramatic ICC Cricket World Cup final against New Zealand. However, as time has passed and the dust has settled, a lingering question remains: Did England truly win, or did they unknowingly sow the seeds of karma, which would come back to haunt them? The 2019 final was an epic clash, a breathtaking duel that had fans worldwide on the edge of their seats. But amidst all the drama, a cloud of controversy hung over England's triumph. The boundary count rule, an unusual tiebreaker for such a historic contest, ultimately decided the outcome. This rule left many, including New Zealand, feeling that neither team truly deserved to LOSE, nor did either fully deserve to WIN. Now, in 2023, England's title defense has crumbled, their campaign marred by struggle and disappointment. It appears that the cricketing gods are reminding us that karma, indeed, never forgets an address. Perhaps, in the wake of their 2019 controversial victory, England had a chance to rise above mere rules and share the title with New Zealand‚Äîa gesture that would have resonated in history as a symbol of sportsmanship and fairness. But they did NOT. Fast forward to the present, and England finds themselves at the BOTTOM of the points table, fighting to regain their footing. It's a poignant reminder that in cricket, as in life, actions matter. The universe has a way of restoring balance. As England faces the Netherlands and Pakistan in their remaining matches, they have an opportunity to rewrite their story. To show that true champions are those who not only strive for victory but also stand for integrity, fairness, and sportsmanship. The lesson of karma is a challenging one, but it guides England toward a path of redemption, where history remembers them not just as winners but as exemplars of what it means to share the glory. #CricketWorldCup #KarmaInSports #FairPlay #ShareTheGlory #karma Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) NEW ZEALAND CRICKET England & Wales Cricket Board (ECB) England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) New Zealand national cricket team"
