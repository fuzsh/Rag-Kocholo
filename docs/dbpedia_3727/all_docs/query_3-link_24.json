        "text": "CHICAGO (Nov. 19, 2022) – The U.S. Men’s National Team will kick off the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar on Monday, Nov. 21 against Wales. Returning to the world stage for the first time in eight years, the USA was drawn alongside Wales, England and IR Iran in Group B.\n\nKickoff for USA-Wales from Ahmad Bin Ali Stadium in Al Rayyan, Qatar is set for 2 p.m. ET on Fox and Telemundo.\n\nTwenty-five of 26 USMNT players have the opportunity to make their World Cup debuts. The remarkably youthful U.S. roster is the second youngest in Qatar, but is packed with potential -- 14 of 26 players compete in the world’s top five leagues.\n\nContesting its first World Cup since 1958, Wales is in the midst of perhaps its greatest era of international success after qualifying for its first two UEFA European Championships in 2016 and 2020, finishing third at the 2016 tournament.\n\nU.S. MEN’S NATIONAL TEAM - 2022 FIFA WORLD CUP ROSTER BY POSITION (CLUB/COUNTRY; CAPS/GOALS; HOMETOWN)\n\nGOALKEEPERS (3): Ethan Horvath (Luton Town/ENG; 8/0; Highlands Ranch, Colo.), Sean Johnson (New York City FC; 10/0; Lilburn, Ga.), Matt Turner (Arsenal/ENG; 20/0; Park Ridge, N.J.)\n\nDEFENDERS (9): Cameron Carter-Vickers (Celtic/SCO; 11/0; Southend-on-Sea, England), Sergiño Dest (AC Milan/ITA; 19/2; Almere, Netherlands), Aaron Long (New York Red Bulls; 29/3; Oak Hills, Calif.), Shaq Moore (Nashville SC; 15/1; Powder Springs, Ga.), Tim Ream (Fulham/ENG; 46/1; St. Louis, Mo.), Antonee Robinson (Fulham/ENG; 29/2; Liverpool, England), Joe Scally (Borussia Mönchengladbach/GER; 3/0; Lake Grove, N.Y.), DeAndre Yedlin (Inter Miami CF; 75/0; Seattle, Wash.), Walker Zimmerman (Nashville SC; 33/3; Lawrenceville, Ga.)\n\nMIDFIELDERS (7): Brenden Aaronson (Leeds United/ENG; 24/6; Medford, N.J.), Kellyn Acosta (LAFC; 53/2; Plano, Texas), Tyler Adams (Leeds United/ENG; 32/1; Wappingers Falls, N.Y.), Luca de la Torre (Celta Vigo/ESP; 12/0; San Diego, Calif.), Weston McKennie (Juventus/ITA; 37/9; Little Elm, Texas), Yunus Musah (Valencia/ESP; 19/0; London, England), Cristian Roldan (Seattle Sounders FC; 32/0; Pico Rivera, Calif.)\n\nFORWARDS (7): Jesús Ferreira (FC Dallas; 15/7; McKinney, Texas), Jordan Morris (Seattle Sounders; 49/11; Mercer Island, Wash.), Christian Pulisic (Chelsea/ENG; 52/21; Hershey, Pa.), Gio Reyna (Borussia Dortmund/GER; 14/4; Bedford, N.Y.), Josh Sargent (Norwich City/ENG; 20/5; O’Fallon, Mo.), Tim Weah (Lille/FRA; 25/3; Rosedale, N.Y.), Haji Wright (Antalyaspor/TUR; 3/1; Los Angeles, Calif.)\n\nUSA SCHEDULE - 2022 FIFA WORLD CUP\n\nDate\n\nOpponent\n\nVenue\n\nTime (ET)\n\nTV Info\n\nMonday, Nov. 21\n\nWales\n\nAhmad Bin Ali Stadium; Al Rayyan, Qatar\n\n2 p.m.\n\nFOX, Telemundo\n\nFriday, Nov. 25\n\nEngland\n\nAl Bayt Stadium; Al Khor, Qatar\n\n2 p.m.\n\nFOX, Telemundo\n\nTuesday, Nov. 29\n\nIR Iran\n\nAl Thumama Stadium; Doha, Qatar\n\n2 p.m.\n\nFOX, Telemundo\n\nRETURN TO THE WORLD STAGE\n\nPlaying in its 11th FIFA World Cup and eighth of the last nine, the USMNT will go up against the tournament’s strongest overall group in Qatar. Drawn into Group B alongside Wales, England and IR Iran, the four nations hold an average rank of 15.\n\nThe 2022 World Cup, the first to be held in the Middle East, features 32 nations divided into eight groups of four teams and will be the last tournament played with the 32-team format. After group play from Nov. 21-29, the top two finishers in each group will advance to the knockout stage of the competition from Dec. 3-18. All 64 matches of the tournament will be played in eight state-of-the-art stadiums in Qatar, with all venues within an hour drive of the capital of Doha.\n\nYOUNG AMERICANS\n\nThe USMNT was by far the youngest team to qualify for the 2022 FIFA World Cup, garnering valuable experience going through the rigors of World Cup qualifying. Through 14 qualifiers, the USA Starting XI came in at an average of 23.82, almost two years younger than the next closest team, Ghana at 25.67. Together, the other 31 participating teams averaged a Starting XI age of 27.5 through qualifying, nearly four full years older than the U.S.\n\nFrom the available data for qualified teams, the USMNT played 10 of the 11 youngest lineups worldwide during the recently concluded qualifying cycle, with all 14 lineups falling in the 23 youngest Starting XIs in the world dating back to October 2020. After its successful qualifying campaign, each match is another opportunity for the young USMNT player pool to gain experience against top-flight competition.\n\nThe 2022 team ties the 1990 USA side for most U-23 players on a USMNT World Cup roster with nine: Tyler Adams (23); Brenden Aaronson, Sergiño Dest, Josh Sargent and Tim Weah (22); Jesús Ferreira (21); Yunus Musah, Gio Reyna and Joe Scally (19).\n\nWith the inclusion of Musah, Reyna and Scally, this is the first USMNT World Cup squad with more than one teenager on the roster, though Gio Reyna turned 20 on Nov. 12 and Yunus Musah will do so on Nov. 29, the day of the USA’s final group stage match against Iran.\n\nHIGHEST LEVEL FOR CLUB & COUNTRY\n\nWhile 25 players will seek to make their World Cup debuts in Qatar, the USMNT roster is no stranger to some of soccer’s biggest stages at the club level. Five of 26 players are participating in this year’s UEFA Champions League, the sport’s premier club competition, while 14 play for teams in the world’s top five leagues (England, Germany, Spain, Italy and France).\n\nThis USMNT World Cup roster boasts perhaps the most impressive list of club homes ever at the tournament, with players at some of Europe’s most storied clubs. Forward Christian Pulisic helped Chelsea win the UEFA Champions League in 2020-21, becoming the first American to play in the UCL Final. Defender Sergiño Dest moved this season to reigning Italian champion AC Milan, while goalkeeper Matt Turner is plying his trade for English Premier League leader Arsenal. Midfielder Weston McKennie’s club Juventus won the Italian league championship nine times in a row from 2011-12 through 2019-20.\n\nONLY FORWARD\n\nThe USMNT’s World Cup squad reflects the success of the U.S. Soccer player development pathway, as many of the players came up through the U.S. Youth National Teams program and spent time in the U.S. Soccer Development Academy and/or the U.S. Soccer U-17 Residency Program.\n\nFourteen players – just over half the roster - have represented the USA in at least one FIFA Youth World Cup. Four took the field together at two separate tournaments: Tyler Adams, Luca de la Torre Christian Pulisic and Haji Wright at the 2015 U-17 World Cup in Chile, and Adams, Cameron Carter-Vickers, de la Torre and Josh Sargent at the 2017 U-20 World Cup in Korea Republic.\n\nSeventeen of 26 played in the U.S. Soccer Development Academy, run by the Federation as the nation’s highest level of youth soccer from 2007-2020 to maximize youth player development by positively impacting everyday club environments. Seven players participated in the Residency Program, an elite training environment for the country’s best youth players at IMG Academy in Bradenton, Fla. From 1999-2017.\n\nROAD TESTED\n\nDespite the youth of the USMNT player pool, the U.S. squad earned their stripes during Concacaf’s rigorous 14-game World Cup qualification campaign, the Octagonal. A record-tying 29 players made their first WCQ appearance this cycle in the challenging conditions of Concacaf.\n\nSince qualifying for the World Cup in March, the USMNT has used its four open friendly match dates to challenge itself against fellow tournament participants, lining up opponents from Asia, Africa and South America. The USA topped Morocco 3-0 and battled South American power Uruguay to a scoreless draw in June, before falling 2-0 to Japan and tying Saudi Arabia 0-0 during the team’s final prep matches in September.\n\nBY THE NUMBERS\n\nWith the USA’s World Cup roster officially submitted, a new class will join the illustrious ranks of players to represent the United States on the sport’s biggest stage. With the assignment of jersey numbers, the current USMNT joins the legacy of players to take the field for their country at the USA’s previous 10 World Cup appearances. Goalkeeper Matt Turner joins a proud lineage of U.S. goalkeepers to wear No. 1 from the state of New Jersey, following Tony Meola, Brad Friedel and Tim Howard. Forward Christian Pulisic will wear the hallowed No. 10 shirt like playmakers Tab Ramos, Claudio Reyna and Landon Donovan before him.\n\nBE THE CHANGE\n\nFollowing the death of George Floyd in May 2020 and continuing growth of the important Black Lives Matter movement, the members of the U.S. Men’s National Team were inspired to develop their own mission statement to send and spread a meaningful message. From a diverse and united group, a call to action emerged: Be the Change.\n\nThe spirit of our message is that each and every person has the ability, opportunity and responsibility to make a difference in their own way. The motto has been brought to life in a number of different ways. Last June, the USMNT advocated for stricter gun control with armbands and an imploring letter to Congress to pass legislation.\n\nNow, with the eyes of the world on the 2022 FIFA World Cup, the USMNT and U.S. Soccer will continue to elevate and advance the Be the Change message, inviting everyone on the journey to make a positive and lasting impact.\n\nSPECIAL GUESTS\n\nAs the USMNT prepares to kick off the World Cup in Qatar, the team has welcomed some special guests to its “home away from home” - Al Gharafa Stadium, serving as the U.S. training facility for the month. On Tuesday night, eight players and two coaches hosted 20 migrant workers who helped build the infrastructure behind the World Cup for some fun on the field, playing small-sided games and taking part in a penalty kick shootout alongside the USMNT. Afterwards, the U.S. contingent signed autographs and took photos with workers to thank them for their efforts to make the tournament happen.\n\nTo show their appreciation for all those serving the United States in Qatar, head coach Gregg Berhalter and the USMNT invited servicemen and women, embassy staff and their families to attend practice on Wednesday. Nearly 1,000 U.S. citizens from Camp As Saliyah, Al Udeid Airbase and the U.S. Embassy in Doha came to Al Gharafa Stadium for exclusive access to the session and post-training autographs and photos.\n\nThe son of a U.S. serviceman, Weston McKennie addressed the crowd before practice. Sixteen years ago, McKennie met USMNT legends Carlos Bocanegra and Landon Donovan when the team visited Ramstein Air Base in Germany ahead of the 2006 FIFA World Cup. Now, the Texan will compete on the global stage himself.\n\nUSA ROSTER NOTES\n\nAs of the opening match against Wales on Nov. 21, the 26-player roster will hold an average age of 25 years, 175 days, making it the second-youngest USMNT roster at a World Cup after the 1990 squad (24 years, 24 days).\n\nThe 2022 team also ties the 1990 side for most U-23 players on a USMNT World Cup roster with nine: Tyler Adams (23); Brenden Aaronson, Sergiño Dest, Josh Sargent and Tim Weah (22); Jesús Ferreira (21); Yunus Musah, Gio Reyna and Joe Scally (19).\n\nWith the inclusion of Musah, Reyna and Scally, this is the first USMNT World Cup squad with more than one teenager on the roster, though Gio Reyna turned 20 on Nov. 12 and Yunus Musah will do so on Nov. 29, the day of the USA’s final group stage match against Iran.\n\nOnly three USMNT World Cup players have been younger than the teenage trio for the first game of their respective tournament: Joe Martinelli (17.76; 1934), Julian Green (19.03; 2014), Chris Henderson (19.5; 1990), Joe Scally (19.89; 2022), Yunus Musah (19.98; 2022), Gio Reyna (20.02; 2022).\n\nHead coach Gregg Berhalter will become the first individual to play for and coach the USMNT at a FIFA World Cup.\n\nWith 75 caps, DeAndre Yedlin is the senior-most player and the only one with previous World Cup experience after featuring in three matches during the 2014 tournament in Brazil.\n\nFollowing Yedlin in terms of seniority are Kellyn Acosta (53 caps), Christian Pulisic (52), Jordan Morris (49), Tim Ream (46), Weston McKennie (37), Walker Zimmerman (33), Tyler Adams (32) and Cristian Roldan (32).\n\nAt 35 years old, Tim Ream is the eighth oldest player named to a USMNT World Cup roster, and fifth oldest field player. The current captain of English Premier League side Fulham FC ranks behind Frank Moniz (38.75; 1950), Marcus Hahnemann (37.99; 2010), Fernando Clavijo (37.4; 1994), Thomas Dooley (37.1; 1998), Tom Florie (36.72; 1934), Kasey Keller (36.54; 2006), Tim Howard (35.28; 2014), Tim Ream (35.13; 2022).\n\nPlayers represent clubs in eight different countries: USA (9), England (8), Germany (2), Italy (2), Spain (2), France (1), Scotland (1), Turkey (1).\n\nPlayers have hometowns in nine different states: California (4), New York (4), Georgia (3) Texas (3), Missouri (2), New Jersey (2), Washington (2), Colorado (1), Pennsylvania (1).\n\nFour other players have hometowns in two foreign countries: England (3) and Netherlands (1).\n\nA total of 21 players made at least one appearance for the USA during 2022 World Cup Qualifying. The group accounted for 9,683 minutes (70 percent of total minutes) and 16 of the 21 goals scored (76 percent).\n\nThe five who did not appear in qualifying are goalkeepers Ethan Horvath and Sean Johnson, defenders Cameron Carter-Vickers and Joe Scally, and forward Haji Wright.\n\nFour clubs have two players on the USMNT World Cup roster: Brenden Aaronson and Tyler Adams (Leeds United); Tim Ream and Antonee Robinson (Fulham); Shaq Moore and Walker Zimmerman (Nashville SC); Jordan Morris and Cristian Roldan (Seattle Sounders)\n\nHaving made his international debut at the start of 2021, Matt Turner has 14 clean sheets through his first 20 caps, leading all USMNT goalkeepers in shutouts through their first 20 appearances.\n\nShould Turner appear in a World Cup match, he would become the fourth goalkeeper from the state of New Jersey to play for the USMNT at the tournament, following Jimmy Douglas (East Newark; 1930), Tony Meola (Kearny; 1990 and 1994) and Tim Howard (North Brunswick; 2010, 2014).\n\nDefender Sergiño Dest (AC Milan) and midfielder Weston McKennie (Juventus) are the second and third USMNT players from Serie A clubs to make a World Cup roster, following Oguchi Onyewu (AC Milan) in 2010.\n\nDest will be the second Dutch-American to represent the USMNT at a FIFA World Cup, following current U.S. Soccer Sporting Director Earnie Stewart who took part in the 1994, 1998 and 2002 World Cups.\n\nHaving recently captained Celtic in the UEFA Champions League, center back Cameron Carter-Vickers becomes the first player from a Scottish club named to a U.S. World Cup roster.\n\nCenter back Walker Zimmerman (Lawrenceville), goalkeeper Sean Johnson (Lilburn) and right back Shaq Moore (Powder Springs) all hail from the state of Georgia, with Zimmerman and Johnson both having attended Brookwood High School in the Atlanta suburb of Snellville.\n\nGoalkeeper Ethan Horvath becomes the first player from the state of Colorado named to a USMNT World Cup roster.\n\nMidfielders Luca de la Torre (Celta de Vigo) and Yunus Musah (Valencia) are the first players from the Spanish Primera to make a U.S. World Cup roster. Previously, Tab Ramos made the 1994 squad after playing for Real Betis in the Spanish Segunda.\n\nDefender Joe Scally and Haji Wright both made their USMNT debuts earlier this year in the 3-0 friendly win against Morocco on June 1 in Cincinnati. Wright’s penalty kick in that match made him the 56th player to score in their USMNT debut.\n\nWright (Antalyaspor) also becomes just the second player from a Turkish club to make a USMNT World Cup roster after Jermaine Jones, who was on loan with Besiktas at the time of the 2014 tournament in Brazil.\n\nFourteen players represented the USA in at least one FIFA Youth World Cup: Kellyn Acosta (2011 U-17; 2013, 2015 U-20), Tyler Adams (2015 U-17, 2017 U-20), Cameron Carter-Vickers (2015, 2017 U-20), Luca de la Torre (2015 U-17, 2017 U-20), Sergiño Dest (2017 U-17, 2019 U-20), Sean Johnson (2009 U-20), Shaq Moore (2015 U-20), Christian Pulisic (2015 U-17), Gio Reyna (2019 U-17), Josh Sargent (2017 U-17, U-20), Joe Scally (2019 U-17) Tim Weah (2017 U-17, 2019 U-20), Haji Wright (2015 U-17), DeAndre Yedlin (2013 U-20).\n\nUSA-WALES\n\nMonday marks the third meeting all-time between the USA and Wales.
