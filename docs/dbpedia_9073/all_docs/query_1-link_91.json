        "text": "False eyelashes offer you the option to change your style and add definition to your features. Many people assume that you need lashes to attach false eyelashes to, but this is not the case. False lashes attach to the outside lid of the eye and not to the lash itself. Not only do false lashes offer you a discreet way to keep your treatment and hair loss private, but also helps to protect the eye from dust and irritation.\n\nFalse lashes have never been more in demand and are a current fashion trend. This makes false lashes readily available in many different colours and styles. From high street chemists, online suppliers, salons and department stores to wig suppliers and hair loss clinics, you will find something to suit you.\n\nWith a bit of practice they are easy to use, cost effective and can offer you a great way to feel a bit more like yourself, or maybe offer you a bit of glamour for a night out or special occasion.\n\nWill wearing mascara, false lashes or eyebrow make-up cause my eyelashes and eyebrows to fall out?\n\nVideo suggestion: How to put on False Eyelashes! | Chemotherapy guide – “Sara and I show you step by step.”\n\nWe are often asked if wearing make-up or false eyelashes can cause the hair on eyebrows or lashes to fall out during chemotherapy treatment.\n\nIt’s really important to know that when the hairs fall out during chemo they do so because of two main reasons; 1) as part of the natural hair growth cycle, 2) the main reason – as a side effect to chemotherapy. In other words, hairs are not falling out because you are wearing make-up or a false eyelash and are pulling them out, e.g. with a mascara wand or when removing a false lash.\n\nWhen chemotherapy causes hair loss on lashes and brows this means that at some point, these loose hair will fall out. The loose hair may come out when you apply make-up, apply or remove a false eyelash or could fall out at any time and is likely to come out sooner or later.\n\nHowever, when a loose hair is moved, for example when applying mascara, this will move the already loose hair resulting in that hair falling out, but remember it is not the underlying cause. The underlying cause is the chemotherapy treatment.\n\nWith this in mind, wearing mascara or eyebrow make-up is not going to ‘cause’ the hair to fall out – the cause is the chemotherapy treatment.\n\nMany people try new make-up techniques to create brows, accentuate their eyes or give false eyelashes a try.\n\nA further note about wearing false eyelashes:\n\nFalse eyelashes are designed to be worn by people with all types of hair loss (alopecia) as well as people who wish to enhance their lashes. Some brands have designed false lashes specifically for chemotherapy wearers with some clever improvements on designs, however, you should feel free to choose a lash that suits your style requirements.\n\nMany people worry that false lashes might ‘cause’ their fragile falling lashes or new lashes to fall out. However, when it comes to hair loss due to chemotherapy, it is the chemotherapy that is the underlying cause (see above).\n\nIt’s worth while knowing that false eyelashes are fixed with a glue that is specifically designed for the delicate eye area on the top of your eyelid and is not for use under the eyelid itself.\n\nYou can also buy latex free glues if you are sensitive to latex.\n\nThere are also various clear and coloured (black) glues that can further help to enhance your look.\n\nIt’s a case of trying to see if wearing a false lash is suitable for you.\n\nLash extensions\n\nLash extensions are a different matter and not recommended prior to or during chemotherapy treatment, as the lash is too unstable to attach an extension to. There are also some concerns around infection. Post treatment lashes should be strong, long enough and stable before lash extensions are applied.\n\nTypes of lashes\n\nThere really is a huge range of false lashes available. Depending on what type of definition you are looking for will indicate what type of lashes to invest in.\n\nAs well as temporary lashes that you apply and remove daily (before sleeping) there are also semi permanent lashes that are designed to last anywhere from 2-3 days or longer. You can sleep and swim with them on. At the time of writing, these need to be attached to your own stable and strong lashes, so are not suitable for people during hair loss and treatment. However, once treatment is complete, and sufficient new lash growth is stable (only a very small growth is needed), then semi-permanent lashes may be an option.\n\nNatural look\n\nBecause of the current trend in false lashes you may not be able to see past the rows of dramatic sparkling lashes on offer, but there are many that look very natural.\n\nHere are our top tips for finding natural looking lashes:\n\nLook for lashes that use the words ‘fine’, ‘natural’ or ‘feather weight’\n\nIt’s good to know that you can cut the width of the lashes (not the individual lash but the lid length) to fit your eye.\n\nEven if you normally wear black mascara you may like to opt for a lighter colour such as dark brown, brown or dark blonde.\n\nGlasses wearers may like to choose lashes that are shorter in individual lash length so they feel comfortable close to the\n\nlenses of their glasses.\n\nYou don’t need to wear any other eye make-up when wearing false lashes.\n\nPractice wearing your lashes around the house before wearing them outside for the first time.\n\nGood quality lashes will be re-usable 4 to 5 times with enough adhesive for several applications.\n\nPre-glued options can be great for people new to lash wearing as they are less fiddly.\n\nDramatic\n\nMany women tell us that they decide to take the opportunity to wear dramatic and flamboyant eyelashes as a way of bringing some extra sparkle and style to their look. If you are wearing a headscarf, or beautifully bare, or perhaps looking for something for an extra special occasion then the huge range of lashes to exaggerate and accentuate your eyes is an Aladdin’s cave off creativity and flutter.\n\nIf you are missing the normal volume that your hair on your scalp would give you, opting for some full, long and deep false\n\nlashes can give you new depth to your face shape\n\nFalse lashes with an extra long lash at the edge will elongate your eye shape\n\nTry lashes with jewels and glitter for an extra special sparkle\n\nRemember you can cut the length of the lashes at the edge if they are too long along the eye lid\n\nTips for putting on false lashes and lash care\n\nWhen it comes to putting on false lashes, practice really can make perfect. See our tips below for guidance and ideas.\n\nMake a cuppa! Watch guidance ‘how to video’s’ so that you get an idea of how to attach the lashes\n\nPractice, practice, practice! Make time to practice and wear your lashes – don’t give up, persevere and keep trying\n\nLash buddy – if you are finding it difficult ask a friend to help\n\nMake sure you have clean hands to start with and have some make-up wipes or a damp flannel handy to wipe off any adhesive spillage\n\nEasy option – pre-glued options can be great for people new to lash wearing as they are less fiddly\n\nApplicator – lash applicators can be really helpful as the applicator holds the lash in place and is less fiddly then holding it with your finger tips\n\nClose up – invest in a two sided magnifying mirror that gives you a good close up on your eyes – ideal for those who wear glasses or are partially sited\n\nLash length – it’s really important to get the right lash length (that is the length of your eye lid). If the lashes stick out beyond your eye they may be less well secured. Simply snip off any length that is too long\n\nFinish with lashes – complete your other base and eye make-up first, before applying your lashes\n\nStorage – keep your lash box so that you can re-use your lashes. If you take time to remove and store them, good quality lashes will last for 4 to 5 uses\n\nSensitive skin – some people find that their skin is more sensitive then normal, or may have sensitivity to the latex adhesive glue that is commonly used to attach false lashes. Help is at hand as the brand Eyelure make latex-free lash adhesive. Additionally, do a patch test first to see if you have sensitivity to the glue.\n\nhttp://www.eylure.com/accessories/glues-removers/latex-free-lash-adhesive-clear.html\n\nNext planned review: February 2022"
