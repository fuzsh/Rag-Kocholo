        "text": "With 12 years of experience wearing false eyelashes (thanks to competitive dance for starting me young), I know a thing or two about what makes a good pair.\n\nCurious which fake lashes are the best in today's market, I tried 27 pairs from eight popular brands over the course of several weeks. (And as more launch, I’ll come back and update you on my favorites.)\n\nDeal Alert!\n\nThe Ardell Naked Lashes are not only some of the most natural-looking, but they're currently on sale for $9 at Amazon.\n\nHowever, I didn’t go into this test without some expert guidance. Celebrity makeup artists Ash K Holm, who works with Kim Kardashian, Ariana Grande, and Megan Fox, and Diane Buzzetta, who works with Hailey Bieber and Kendall Jenner, laid the groundwork for what to look for in the world of falsies.\n\nThe best false eyelashes I found — from classic styles like the Ardell Wispies to colorful strip lashes from Halsey’s Walmart beauty brand — ultimately prioritize longevity, comfort, and ease of use.\n\nStar Qualities\n\nInvisible band hides the lash line\n\nSoft lashes look and feel realistic\n\nProvide volume and length without looking unnatural\n\nRed Flags\n\nRelatively expensive (but can be reused 20+ times, making them more affordable overall)\n\nWithout a doubt, Lilly Lashes makes some of the most luxurious-feeling, natural-looking, and highest-quality false eyelashes that I’ve ever tried.\n\nWhen stacked against more budget-friendly options like the classic Ardell Wispies or drugstore Kiss lashes, the quality of these falsies is more noticeable than ever. Not only do these lashes feel like real human hair, but this particular pair is designed to follow the pattern of natural lash growth, just with an extra dose of volume and length. The subtle flare lash gave my eyes a slight cat-eye effect and paired perfectly with both natural daytime glam and sultrier nighttime eyeshadow-and-liner looks.\n\nMaterial: Faux mink | Lash length: 13.5mm | Band: Full-length | Shades: 1 | Look: Flare | Eye shape: Monolid, almond | Reusable: Yes, 20+ wears\n\nStar Qualities\n\nInvisible lashband makes for a seamless blend\n\nThinner lashes look more realistic than the older versions\n\nCheap option at $13 for a four-pack\n\nRed Flags\n\nNot as realistic-looking as faux mink lashes\n\nThe new and improved version of Ardell’s mainstay 420 falsies, the Naked Lashes are a lighter, softer, more undetectable version of the plasticky strip lashes I used to grab for dance competitions in the 2010s.\n\nWhile I distinctly remember how thick the original version used to look on my eyes, thick black lashband and all, I was surprised to see how light and feathery this updated style is. From its transparent lashband to its softer, realistic-looking crossover lashes, this style got the natural makeover it needed while keeping cost relatively low. While a four-pack is just $13, you can grab a singlet for just $5 — making these one of the cheapest of the bunch.\n\nMaterial: Synthetic fibers | Lash length: Not specified | Band: Full-length | Shades: 1 | Look: Rounded | Eye Shape: Round, monolid, almond, hooded | Reusable: Yes, 4-5 times (from personal experience)\n\nPro Tip!\n\n“When picking out a strip lash, I always look at the density and quality of the hair, as well as the band and the shape and design of the lashes. For a more natural look, I always prefer an invisible band because of how beautifully it blends into the lash line.\" —Diane Buzzetta, celebrity makeup artist\n\nStar Qualities\n\nSame quality as best overall lashes\n\nLooks more natural on most eye shapes\n\nFits smaller eyes well\n\nRed Flags\n\nHonestly, we found no faults with these lashes\n\nThe only problem I had when declaring these lashes as the best half-lash was choosing between my favorite styles (its competitor was the Inviting Half Lash, which I decided against because its dramatic flare shape may not be for everyone).\n\nWhat is there to not love about this full-bodied, universally complementary, voluminous lash? These halfies are made from synthetic faux mink fibers and have a lashband length of just 20mm, whereas the full lash reaches 30mm (the shorter style accentuates my rounded almond eye shape beautifully). The artfully placed lashes are thicker at the root to give the appearance of fuller lashes, and each strand is woven onto a sheer band for a look that’s so natural, they’ll look like your own.\n\nMaterial: Faux mink | Lash length: 13mm | Band: Half lash | Shades: 1 | Look: Round | Eye Shape: All | Reusable: Yes, 20+ wears\n\nStar Qualities\n\nEasy to apply with fingers\n\nStuck to both clean and mascara-coated lashes\n\nUnidentifiable lash band due to underlash placement\n\nRed Flags\n\nLess rewears than others we tested\n\nIf the idea of applying lashes, getting near your eyes with tweezers, or accidentally gluing your eyes shut has been a fear of yours, then we recommend these lashes from Kiss.\n\nThough they come with tweezers, these self-adhesive lashes were beyond easy to apply with my fingers. “You press them on and you’re out the door,” Holm tells PEOPLE. The celebrity makeup artist admitted to keeping them in her car for on-the-go glam. “You can even just do two pieces on the outer corners and call it a day.”\n\nThat’s just what I’ve begun doing when I have to run somewhere quick — every cluster is pre-made with adhesive on top of the lashes, which allowed the band to stick to the underside of my lashes with ease. Its pressure-activated glue bonded to my lashes, clean or mascara-ed, for an entire day with zero lifting. Best of all, you can easily remove them at the end of the day and get 1-2 more wears out of them.\n\nMaterial: Synthetic fiber | Lash length: 12, 14mm | Band: Clusters | Shades: 1 | Look: Customizable, wispy | Eye Shape: All | Reusable: Yes, up to 3 wears\n\nStar Qualities\n\nStuck well on clean and mascara-coated lashes\n\nLooked completely natural due to underlash application\n\nVery easy to apply\n\nGreat value, especially since it includes tweezers\n\nRed Flags\n\nLashes could be seen in my peripheral vision (but I soon adjusted)\n\nThese could win so many categories in my book — best cluster lashes, easiest application, the list goes on — but as a former self-adhesive eyelash skeptic, these almost made me toss out my glue.\n\nApply these cluster lashes under the lash line but a bit above the water line to not cause irritation. This also completely hides the lash band and makes them look like your own lashes — but better! An aptly-shaped pair of tweezers, which are included in the kit, help make the placement of these temporary extensions that much easier.\n\nJust like that, the lashes stick to the underside of your lashes, whether clean or mascara-ed (I’ve tried both, and they stay put for a full day either way).\n\nMaterial: Synthetic fiber | Lash length: 10, 12, 14mm | Band: Clusters | Shades: 1 | Look: Customizable, feathered | Eye Shape: All | Reusable: Yes, 4 wears\n\nStar Qualities\n\nStays put despite humidity and sweat\n\nComfortable lash band\n\nHolds curl even after getting wet\n\nRed Flags\n\nLong lash band required trimming\n\nMakeup that stays during a humid day, sweat session, or after getting caught in the rain is a rare feat. But lashes that are designed to thrive in these treacherous conditions are even harder to come by.\n\nOn particularly humid days or during sweaty workouts, you’ve most likely seen your lashes droop and mascara run — a problem that the ever-curly Active Lash is here to solve. These water-resistant lashes thrive in wet conditions, holding their curl and sticking tightly to your lash line with the Active Duo Adhesive (which is also sweat- and water-resistant). Whether you live in a particularly warm place or don’t want to compromise beauty for a workout, these lashes are in it for the long haul.\n\nThe only thing I’d note is that this lash band seems a bit longer than the other Active Lash styles, so it may require some trimming to get your perfect fit.\n\nMaterial: Water-resistant synthetic fibers | Lash length: Not specified | Band: Full-length | Shades: 1 | Look: Rounded, light volume | Eye Shape: All | Reusable: Yes, 4-5 times (from personal experience)\n\nPro Tip!\n\nTrim your fake lashes by snipping the lash band in between a cluster and save the stray clusters to use later as individual lashes.\n\nStar Qualities\n\nNatural, soft look and feel\n\nSuits all hair colors, but especially blondes, well\n\nFlared shape adds an element of glam\n\nRed Flags\n\nLong lash band required trimming\n\nWhile brown mascara isn’t exactly a new concept, it’s been all the rage this year — so it came as no surprise that Ardell had created a brown false lash for the natural lash-lovers.\n\nWhat separated these lashes from their Naked Lash sisters is the softer color scheme and balayage effect that this pair features, layering dark brown and caramel “highlights” to give dimension to your eyes. These lashes made the hazel in my eyes stand out, but I can see these working well on blondes, as black falsies can sometimes look too harsh on people with fairer palettes. Their flared shape brings the glamour without being too overpowering for daytime looks, as the chocolate-brown softens them.\n\nSince the lash band is quite long, you may need to trim the corners to better fit your eye shape. (However, this is an admittedly better problem than having the lashes be too small for your eye.)\n\nMaterial: Synthetic fibers | Lash length: Not specified | Band: Full-length | Shades: 6 | Look: Rounded at center, flared at ends | Eye Shape: All | Reusable: Yes, 4-5 times (from personal experience)\n\nStar Qualities\n\nColorful elements are subtle enough for everyday wear\n\nFaux mink lashes look and feel ultra-soft\n\nVegan and cruelty-free\n\nRed Flags\n\nFlared style might be too dramatic for natural glam-lovers\n\nIt’s not everyday that you see a pair of colorful false lashes that don’t look tacky — so when I first tried this purple-tinted set from Halsey’s budget-friendly beauty brand, AF94, I was shocked at the quality of the color.\n\nNot unlike the brown Ardell Balayage lashes, these volume-boosting wispies are mostly black with swathes of deep purple giving the lashes some dimension. Though this amethyst shade is nearly undetectable in normal lighting, catching them in the sun will illuminate the wisps of violet intertwined within the black lashes. This makes it a fairly neutral option, but the shape itself might be too glam for everyday wear.\n\nMaterial: UV light-activated synthetic fibers | Lash length: Not specified | Band: Full-length | Shades: 3 | Look: Flared | Eye Shape: All | Reusable: Yes, up to 20 wears\n\nPro Tip!\n\nHave green or hazel eyes? Try out this pair to make your eye color pop.\n\nStar Qualities\n\nPlant-based fibers may be gentler on sensitive eyes\n\nUltra-thin, wispy lashes\n\nCan reuse 20+ times\n\nRed Flags\n\nHard to grip onto the hemp lashes during application\n\nThe Velour Second Nature Plant Fibre Lashes are handmade from hemp fibers and threaded individually onto a thin black cotton band — a true testament to “natural” beauty. From the first wear, it was evident how lightweight these felt and how naturally they blended into my own lashes. Its full, wispy look is fitting on every eye shape, though you may need to trim the lash band to get the perfect fit on your eyes.\n\nWhat separates these lashes from others on this list is that these were made from natural materials, which has a different feel during application. The hemp fibers were slightly hard to get a good hold on between tweezers, but the lash band was a bit easier to manipulate. With a bit of practice (and patience), it got easier to manipulate each strip onto my lash line.\n\nMaterial: Vegan hemp fibers | Lash length: 6-9mm | Band: Full length | Shades: 1 | Look: Round | Eye Shape: All | Reusable: Yes, 20+ wears\n\nStar Qualities\n\nLengthy wisps add both volume and height\n\nShaggy mink ends look natural\n\nSheer band is undetectable\n\nRed Flags\n\nMay be too long for everyday wear (but this is a personal preference)\n\nMaybe it’s the result of \"lazy girl\" beauty routines, but the Kiss Lash Couture Rebel line is here to deliver glam lashes in a deconstructed, undone way — and after testing all of the styles in this collection, “Rockstar” is one of the most wearable.\n\nThis wispy style has a rounded shape and slightly unkempt ends — but make no mistake, this is intentional. The spindly lashes create an artfully “smudged” effect to intensify a nighttime smokey eye or add a bold touch to your natural glam. Though high in volume, these lashes are surprisingly lightweight and blend easily with your natural lashes (we recommend applying mascara before, not after).\n\nMaterial: Synthetic fibers | Lash length: 12mm | Band: Not specified | Shades: 1 | Look: Rounded | Eye Shape: All | Reusable: Yes, 4-5 times (from personal experience)\n\nThe More You Know\n\nBecause some people have lower-set brows, longer lashes can hit the base of the eyebrow and result in an uncomfortable wear.\n\nStar Qualities\n\nNoticeably volumizing and lengthening\n\nFaux mink lashes are very realistic-looking\n\nEasy to reuse\n\nRed Flags\n\nRelatively expensive for Ardell\n\nThe lashes that I’ve been using the longest out of all of the above are the Faux Mink Wispies from Ardell — a mainstay in my makeup kit for years on end for their ultra-soft feel, realistic look and blend, and relatively low price.\n\nWhile lashes like the Ardell Active Lash utilize synthetic fibers that can sometimes look plasticky, this real hair (but faux mink) style is a soft and believable drugstore lash option. The style is spiky and round, ascending and descending in volume as the clusters weave in their crisscross pattern. Not only do they blend beautifully with natural lashes, but they hold their curl and easily form to all eye shapes because of the tapered inner and outer corners.\n\nMaterial: 100% natural hair | Lash length: 12mm | Band: Full-length | Shades: 1 | Look: Round, voluminous | Eye Shape: All | Reusable: Yes, 4-5 times (from personal experience)\n\nAdd to Cart\n\nToo Faced Better Than Sex Waterproof Mascara\n\nThe first step before (most) fake eyelashes is a coat or two of a great mascara. Out of 33 tubes of mascara we tested, the Too Faced Better Than Sex Waterproof Mascara topped the charts for its no-budge, volumizing, and lengthening formula.\n\nStila Stay All Day Waterproof Liquid Eye Liner\n\nEyeliners pulls everything together — especially when fake lashes are involved. The Stila Stay All Day Waterproof Liquid Eye Liner was our top choice for the best eyeliners due to its impressive longevity, precise felt-tip pen, and easy removal process. (Plus, a little bit of eyeliner can go a long way to hide lash mistakes.)\n\nPro Tip!\n\nGently crimp your lashes with an eyelash curler to provide a bit of lift.\n\nWhat to Know About False Eyelashes\n\nTypes of False Eyelashes\n\nStrip lashes: These are your typical falsies with a full lash band, like the Ardell Naked Lashes. Lash bands often need to be fit to your eye and trimmed at the corners to get a personalized fit.\n\nHalf-lashes: While not a true half, lashes like the Lilly Lashes Half Lash are typically two-thirds of the size of a full lash band and sit on the outer corners of your top lashes. They create a cat-eye effect and usually fit those with smaller eyes a little better than full lash bands do.\n\nClusters: Also known as individuals, “clusters” are snippets of full lash bands cut into smaller pieces that make them easier to apply and customize to your shape. You can stack up the clusters on top of one another to create volume or space out your lashes for a custom fit.\n\nUnderlash: A newer kind of lash, these clusters are meant to be placed underneath your top lash line, but slightly away from your water line to avoid irritation. These provide a natural effect that hides the lash band, which can sometimes be hard to mask.\n\nVolume and Length\n\nThe layers and density of your own natural lashes are significant when choosing a pair of false lashes. For a pair to match a glamorous makeup look, go for lashes with higher volume, jet-black strands, and tapered edges to create that cat-eye effect. If you’re a false-lash-everyday type of person, choose a pair that’s more sparse but can also be reworn multiple times to get the most use out of your lashes.\n\nAdditionally, most lashes sit between 10 millimeters and 14 millimeters in length, like the Winks by Ardell Press on Lashes. Each individual lash should have alternating lengths to make the lashes appear more natural and blended with your own, but your level of comfort with lash length will depend on personal preference and facial structure.\n\nStyle\n\nThere are several styles of lashes, from wispy to cat-eye to spiky — all which fit some eye shapes better than others or provide artistic effect for more creative makeup looks. While there’s no rulebook as to which styles you have to buy based on your eye shape, we have recommendations depending on what look you’re going for:\n\nFor a more doe-eyed, open effect, grab a round style that has more length in the center of the lash than on the ends. The Ardell Naked Lashes and Lilly Lashes Playful Half Lash are great examples of this style on a full-length and half lash band.\n\nFor a sultry, fox-eyed look, go with a flare style that is shorter in length on the inner and center areas of the band and longer and more voluminous on the outer ends to create a cat-eye effect. You can use the Ardell Ultra Thin Band Balayage Wispies or AF94 False Advertising Faux UV Lashes to get this almond-eyed look.\n\nPrice\n\nThe lashes I tested spanned from $5 to $20 for a single pair, give a few multi-packs that fell in between that range. Our best budget choice, the Ardell Naked Lashes, comes to $13 for four pairs, but with each lash costing a little more than $3, it's a small investment for good lashes. (Better yet, it's currently on sale for just $9.)\n\nIf you're new to falsies and want to pay the least amount possible to try them out, you’ll be happy to know that the AF94 Faux UV Lashes are just $5. On the other hand, our priciest (and best-rated) lashes from Lilly Lashes come to $20 flat.\n\nIdentify Your Eye Shape\n\nEyes are uniquely shaped and equally beautiful, but most shapes fall within these five categories. If you need help visualizing or identifying your own shape, refer to this eye chart from Charlotte Tilbury.\n\nAlmond: This eye shape is generally oval; slimmer in the corners and wider at the center, creating a shape that vaguely resembles an almond.\n\nDownturned: Holding the most space between the bottom of the cornea and the bottom lash line, this eye shape seems to point downwards rather than up, like the almond-shaped eye.\n\nRound: Spherical and nearly equal in width and length, this eye shape has a softer look than the others — think of animated Disney Princess eyes, but on a human scale. The inner corners do not taper into a thinner shape, instead keeping a curved top and bottom lash line.\n\nHooded: This eye shape is slightly similar to the almond shape, except its defining trait is excess skin in the space between the brow and lash line.\n\nMonolid: The monolid eye shape does not have a crease, which makes it similar to the hooded eye.\n\nSteal Kim’s Look\n\nAccording to her makeup artist, Kardashian’s signature lash combo is a “babydoll” style. Holm says you can recreate her look by using cluster lashes — place the longest wisp in the center and then use medium and short lashes toward the inner and outer corners of your eyes.\n\nBehind the Scenes\n\nFor a little over a month, I tried 27 pairs of false eyelashes and reassessed some old pairs that I’ve collected over the years. (Some are written about here, and some I’m still testing in order to make a more informed opinion. Stay tuned for updates!) After days of wearing and nights spent crinkling my eyes in laughter, I stacked each product against each other based on the following criteria:\n\nLongevity: I wore these lashes for different spans of time and while doing different things — sometimes while running around New York City completing errands, going into the office, or attending events. (I even teared up at a concert in the AF94 Faux UV Lashes. No budging!) I took note of which lashes lifted in the corners after just a few hours of wear or which lost their shape as the days progressed.\n\nStyle: As someone who doesn’t have a preference between demure, minimalist lashes for everyday wear and borderline-editorial lashes for nights out, I was fairly open-minded when it came to lash style. But what I judged each pair on was its ability to blend well with my natural lashes yet still have a noticeable look — like the Ardell Faux Mink Wispies, which create a subtly spikey look that makes any eyes look more sensual.\n\nFeel: False eyelashes have often felt spiky and plastic-like to me, so I made it my mission to seek out soft lashes that look and feel like natural lashes, even if they are made from synthetic fibers. Another important aspect was how comfortable each lash was, specifically after gluing the lash down.\n\nWhy Trust PEOPLE?\n\nAlyssa Brascia is a staff shopping writer for PEOPLE with a specialization in fashion and beauty — as well as a self-taught makeup artist.
