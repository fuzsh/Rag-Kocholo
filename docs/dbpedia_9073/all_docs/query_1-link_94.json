If you get extensions or you’re thinking about it, you’ve undoubtedly seen the following terms:\n\nUnlimited Lashes\n\nFull Set\n\nPartial Set\n\nHalf Set\n\nLashes per eye (lash count)\n\n…and I’m sure there are more variations of the above. So, what does it all mean anyway? What should you expect in your set?\n\nIn this post, we're going to provide clarity to this topic.\n\nWouldn’t it be great if an industry-standard existed to answer how many lashes are in a full set of extensions?

So, what does it all mean anyway? What should you expect in your set?\n\nIn this post, we're going to provide clarity to this topic.\n\nIt takes time for an eyelash professional to get good at applying eyelashes. The more clients they serve, the faster they get and the higher quality of their work. Experience working with different types of natural lashes and how many clients they have done (full time, part-time, or occasional) also affects how quickly the eyelash professional becomes adept at applying lashes.\n\nLet’s base the suggested timelines on the following.\n\n50 lashes per eye = 1 hour\n\n100 lashes per eye = 2 hours\n\n150 lashes per eye = 2.5 hours\n\nFor the sake of argument, let’s say that you have 50 natural eyelashes per eye that are extendable and an appointment length of one hour. If 50 extensions are applied to each eye in an hour, it will take one hour to achieve the ‘full set’ of 50 extensions per eye.\n\nIf you have 100 extendable lashes per eye and the same one hour for your appointment, you will receive half of that—or 50 extensions. So by definition, you will get a half set.\n\nHow many lashes in Full Set to one person is a Half Set to someone else.\n\nIt takes time for an eyelash professional to get good at applying eyelashes.

Counting is straightforward to do.\n\nScenario:\n\nTwo friends would book their lashing appointments together for the same “Full Set.” Client 1 has a very dense and full lash line, whereas Client #2 has sparse, thin lashes. The issue: Both clients would end up with two very different results and must pay the same price.\n\nLash counting eliminates this issue and is our way of creating transparency and accountability with clients. It ensures that you always get the lashes you pay for. We count every extension, so no one has to guess what they’re getting for their money.\n\nWe clearly display the number of lashes per eye on our service menu and lookbook. This is our way of communicating openly with our clients, who regularly express their gratitude.\n\nWe have tried several methods since 2008, and we finally settled on counting Lashes Per Eye.

Therefore, the number of extensions applied within that time frame will determine how many lashes are in a full set. Results will vary.\n\nOne size doesn’t fit all. And we hope that everything we discussed above is taken into account and benefits your understanding.\n\nLashing can be tricky business, and we’re happy to assist. Our love of lashes and commitment to the industry has continually grown since 2008!"
