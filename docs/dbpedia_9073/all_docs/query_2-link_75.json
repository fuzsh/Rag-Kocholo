        "text": "Reading Time: 4 mins\n\nEyelash extensions offer a different layer of beauty that brings out the eyes and completes an outfit. But did you know that it’s not a modern trend? The love for eyelashes has been around longer than you may think.\n\nWhether you’ve ever dabbled with the idea of false eyelashes or you’ve never considered giving it a go, it’s still fun to find out the history of falsies. Explore the beginnings of false eyelashes and keep on reading.\n\nThe Real Beginning: Ancient Times\n\nIt was recently discovered that eyeliner, made from kohl and water, was used as early as 7000 BC in ancient Egypt. This was used to draw lines around the eyes representing the crescent moon, which symbolised purity and rebirth. Ancient Egyptians also applied dark-coloured makeup around the mouth to express their feelings of grief and sorrow.\n\nIt was also common for ancient Egyptian women to use kohl around the edge of the eyelids to enhance the fantasy of the eyes.\n\nThe Middle Ages and Eye Beauty\n\nAs people moved from the ancient Egyptian era to the Middle Ages, falsies challenged male dominance. Women in the Middle Ages used false eyelashes to accessorise their outfits and show off their own beauty.\n\nIn ancient times, it was thought that the mouth represented the womb, and the eyes represented the head. Because the mouth was sacred, the eyes were believed to be just as sacred. It was a symbol of beauty and purity for both sexes.\n\nAs the Middle Ages went on, false eyelashes were used in competitive pageants, where each woman was trying to outdo the next with her makeup and eyelashes.\n\nThe 19th Century and the Mascara\n\nIn the 19th century, women began to paint their faces with a technique called “moulage.” This technique involved creating fine curls of hair by using a heated metal rod. These curls would be used to create the false eyelashes look.\n\nThen, a new product entered the stage known as mascara. It was a cosmetic product that was derived from coal tar. The mascara was used to amplify the size of the eyelashes and enhance the look of the eyes.\n\nThe Patent for Artificial Eyelashes\n\nIn 1911, a Canadian inventor named Anna Taylor patented artificial eyelashes. These artificial eyelashes were made from fine human hair, woven onto a metal band, and worn with a headband.\n\nIt was not until 1915 that the company L.F. Gotch & Co. created the first false eyelash strips. Taylor’s patent was no longer her own, even though she had developed the process of creating hair-like strips that would fit on the eyelashes.\n\nThe strips were made from a mixture of human hair, animal hair, or silk, then pressed and heated to create a hard strip. The first strip was very thick and was used to give the look of natural eyelashes.\n\nIt was extremely painful to wear the fake eyelashes, and the glue would often stick the eyelashes to the wearer’s natural lashes. This made the eyelashes fall off very quickly, forcing women to reapply the strips.\n\nThe Power of the Media for False Eyelashes Popularity\n\nIn the 1920s, false eyelashes were not a popular trend, but they would soon become a part of Hollywood’s glamour. Marion Davies, one of Hollywood’s most popular actresses, wore false eyelashes and became known as the “lash queen.” As the movies became more popular, false eyelashes also became a popular item that many women wanted to use.\n\nIn the 1950s, false eyelashes made a comeback in the public eye when Elizabeth Taylor and Marilyn Monroe began to wear the false eyelashes on a daily basis.\n\nIn the 1970s, false eyelashes became popular again as a part of women’s sexual identity. Although false eyelashes have been around for years, they have seen a major comeback in recent years. The popularity of false eyelashes and any type of makeup has continued to grow, and it’s possible that false eyelashes will continue to grow in popularity.\n\nThe Modern Evolution through Semi-Permanent Eyelash Extensions\n\nThe popularity of false eyelashes has continued to grow in popularity, and the creation of semi-permanent eyelash extensions has brought false lashes to a whole new level.\n\nSemi-permanent eyelash extensions have become increasingly popular. This is because they are safer than the old false eyelashes, which required the use of harsh glue and hair strips.\n\nThe semi-permanent extensions are safer because they are made from 100% human hair, making them less adhesive. They fit onto the natural lash line. They are also lightweight, so they aren’t heavy on the eyes. The best part is that the extensions are reusable, so you can enjoy them for months.\n\nThe Eyelashes of Today\n\nToday, people who wear false eyelashes are not trying to put on a big show, but rather enhance their own beauty. Eyelashes help to make the eyes appear brighter, and they are one of the first things that people notice when they look at you.\n\nIronically, false eyelashes were created as a way to show power and independence. False eyelashes were also made to represent a woman’s attractiveness in ancient times. Today, eyelashes represent a woman’s sense of independence, and they are worn to enhance the eyes and show off their beauty.\n\nAdditionally, modern false eyelashes are made from a number of different materials and are more lightweight than ever before. They can be applied in a day, and they can last for up to three to four months, depending on how they are cared for.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThe popularity of false eyelashes has changed over time. While they have been worn since ancient Egypt, they have seen new popularity in the last several years. Now, beauty is more accessible than it was in the past, and people are looking for ways to enhance their appearance. If you’re looking for a fun, new look for your eyes, you might want to consider false eyelashes.
