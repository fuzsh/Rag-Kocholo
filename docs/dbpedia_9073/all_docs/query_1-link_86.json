        "text": "Human lashes are made of keratin, the same protein that makes up our hair and nails. But hair today, gone tomorrow. What can you do when your lashes aren’t delivering in the luscious department?\n\nFalse lashes are a popular way to enhance the look of natural lashes and come in a variety of materials, including synthetic fibers, silk, mink, and even human hair. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore the science behind false eyelashes and what they are made of.\n\nSynthetic Lashes\n\nSynthetic lashes are made from a range of materials, including polyester, nylon, and acrylic fibers. They are typically mass-produced and are the most affordable option for false lashes. While they can be prone to looking artificial, they can still provide a dramatic effect if applied correctly.\n\nMink Lashes\n\nMink lashes are made from the soft fur of minks, and are known for their luxurious and natural appearance. However, if you want to avoid buying lashes that are made of animal products, look for lashes that are labelled either ‘cruelty-free’ or ‘fur-free.’\n\nHuman Hair Lashes\n\nHuman hair lashes are made from real human hair, and provide a natural-looking option for false lashes. They are also lightweight and comfortable to wear, and can be reused multiple times if cared for properly.\n\nSilk Lashes\n\nSilk lashes are made from synthetic silk fibers, and offer a natural-looking option for false lashes. They are also lightweight and durable, making them a popular choice for those who want a longer-lasting option.\n\nThese can be attached individually as in extensions or attached to a band which is then placed over your existing lashes.\n\nThe problem with real silk is that it tends to be too soft and won’t except a curl.\n\nHow are False Lashes Made?\n\nFalse lashes are manufactured through different processes depending on the material used. Synthetic lashes are typically made through molding plastic fibers into the desired shape and size. Mink lashes are made by carefully collecting mink fur, sterilizing it, and then handcrafting it into individual lashes. Silk lashes are made through weaving synthetic silk fibers into the desired shape and size. Human hair lashes are crafted from real human hair, which is collected and then carefully shaped into individual lashes. The manufacturing process for each type of false lash requires unique techniques and skills to produce high-quality lashes.\n\nHow do lash extensions work, and what are they made of?\n\nEyelash extensions are typically made of synthetic fibers, such as polyester or nylon, which are designed to look and feel like natural lashes.\n\nTo get extensions you need to pop down to your local beauty salon and have them glued on top of your existing eyelashes. Since they are attached to your existing lashes, they will fall off with them – usually after about 3 months.\n\nWhy should you run away from the eyelashes glue?\n\nUsing glue is the reason most women avoid false lashes because of the potential mess. Initially they stick well but, in the end, they might not even last the whole day.\n\nWhat about magnetics?\n\nThe magnetic lashes were developed as a simple alternative to glue – which they are. They are typically made of synthetic fibers, such as polyester or nylon and use tiny magnets to adhere to your natural lashes.\n\nThey’re easy to apply and take off, however, they may get heavy after a while.\n\nShould I go with an eyeliner adhesive?\n\nThe eyeliner adhesives are easy to use and quick to stick on your lashes. Besides, that, they work without the addition of any extra weight, it feels like you’re wearing only your natural lashes.\n\nSynthetic Silk lashes and a revolutionary eyeliner!"
