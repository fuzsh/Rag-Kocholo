        "text": "Makeup trends go in waves, and we are currently in the natural, no-makeup makeup direction. Natural means that instead of caking our faces with foundation, concealer, powder, bronzer, highlighter, etc., we let our natural beauty shine. And a big part of this natural beauty is enhanced but beautifully natural eyelashes.\n\nMakeup artists or MUAs will tell you that no look or trend is original and that everything comes back around eventually. So, it's no surprise that natural-looking makeup is doing the rounds again.\n\nNatural Eyelashes Stand the Test of Time\n\nAccording to vox.com, the 'beat boy' look, favoured by Queen B's MUA of choice, @sirjohn, was the first time natural makeup stood out. Shows like Skins popularised the look of the early 2010s. However, if you roll back to the late 1960s and early 1970s, the naked face and the girl next door look was totally in fashion.\n\nRather than out of vogue, looking like you just woke up seems to have always been a thing. The phrase 'I woke up like this' came from an ad campaign in the 1970s, but steam rolled into modern culture with the release of Beyoncé's Flawless in 2013, followed by a makeup trend on socials carrying the hashtag #wokeuplikethis. The natural look has always been there, but it has ebbed and flowed in popularity.\n\nIn 2023, the natural look and natural-looking eyelashes are back with a vengeance. We're seeing more and more people searching for natural false lashes that will give them a full and fluffy lash line without looking like they're wearing falsies.\n\nBeReal - The Natural Lash Trend\n\nLaunched in 2019, BeReal is a social media phenomenon that embraces realness, natural beauty, and self-love. The platform celebrates all things real-life, an antidote to the retouched images that have become the norm. BeReal has quickly become the go-to place for all things natural.\n\nFrom natural makeup tips and tutorials to advice on how to love your natural-looking false lashes, BeReal is the perfect place to get inspiration for your natural look. With over 1 million posts tagged with #naturallashes #bareface #nofilter and #nomakeup, BeReal is leading the charge when celebrating natural beauty.\n\nSo, if you're looking for some real inspiration for your natural look, be sure to check out BeReal. It’s addictive, you won't be disappointed.\n\nThe Best Natural Looking Eyelash Roundup\n\nWe have put together a list of our five favourite natural-looking false eyelashes to help you get the perfect 'no makeup' barefaced look this year:\n\nKiss Falscara - Natural Wispy Wisp - Multipack\n\nArdell Duralash Natural Individual Lashes (medium)\n\nSweed X Nikki_Makeup - No Lash-Lash\n\nHouse of Lashes - Iconic Lite\n\nDoll Beauty - Lashes Kimberley\n\n1. Kiss Falscara - Natural Wispy Wisp – Multipack\n\nThese natural-looking Kiss Falscara wispy lashes are perfect for creating a 'no makeup' makeup look. They are made from fine synthetic strands and have a unique microband, making them incredibly comfortable to wear and super easy to apply.\n\nWho wouldn't want something called Wispy Wisp? The lashes are cruelty-free and come in a multipack, so you can stock up and save. They also have a natural matte finish, perfect for creating that 'I woke up like this', look.\n\n2. Ardell Duralash Natural Individual Lashes (medium)\n\nIf you're looking for natural-looking lashes that will give you more volume and fullness, then these Medium Ardell Duralash Natural Individual Lashes are for you. They are made in lash clusters to promote individualism and come in a natural black shade.\n\nThe lashes apply easily and will last with proper care. Versatile and natural-looking, they will enhance your lashes and give you the extra confidence boost everyone needs now and then.\n\n3. Sweed X Nikki_Makeup No Lash-Lash\n\nSweed's No Lash-Lash is a natural way to get the fuller, longer lashes you desire without using heavy makeup. Sweed makes the product with light and soft fibres that adhere to your lash line to enhance your look naturally. The lashes are easy to remove and won't damage your natural lashes.\n\nThe No Lash-Lash is perfect for those who want natural-looking lashes without all the fuss. Simply apply the fibres along your lash line and let them do their magic.\n\n4. House of Lashes - Iconic Lite\n\nThe House of Lashes Iconic Lite is a natural-looking falsie that will give you the full, fluffy lashes you desire even if you don't have long eyelash genes.\n\nThe Iconic Lite lashes are perfect for creating a makeup-free image or accentuating your natural beauty. They are cruelty-free, lightweight, and easy to apply. The beautifully criss-crossed lashes form a unique pattern and multi-layered dimension that quickly adds texture, volume, and definition to your eyes.\n\n5. Doll Beauty - Lashes Kimberley\n\nDoll Beauty has mastered natural-looking lashes. The false lashes are perfect for achieving the 'no makeup makeup’, look.\n\nKimberley lashes are made with 100% fine synthetic hair and a defined lash band, making them super comfortable to wear, while the alternating length strands add volume for a subtle look that is tasteful and fits into your day-to-night look.\n\nWith so many great natural-looking false eyelashes on the market, it's hard to choose our favourite. We think these five suggestions are a great place to start, but we couldn't resist adding a few more for good measure... beginning with Kiss My Lash - BBB.\n\nKiss My Lash (BBB)\n\nMade by Kiss in a natural style, Kiss My Lash But Better Blessed use a soft criss-cross design making their lashes delicate, but progressive individual lash lengths mean they are not boring.\n\nThese fake lashes are for you if you want volume that you can wear daily, and what’s more, they have a thin lash band, the tiniest band we have ever seen but with the strength of an ultra lash style.\n\nBoldface Lashes - Short and Sweet\n\nBoldface comes to us straight from sunny California, and let's face it, the Californians do barefaced makeup better than anyone. These natural-looking lashes are called Short and Sweet for a reason.\n\nPackaged by Boldface in a sunny yellow case, the lashes add just the right amount of flutter to your natural lashes without looking overdone, thanks to their shorter length and natural curl.\n\nThey are light as a feather and stay put well into the night, so you can go from your desk to dinner and dance on into the night, knowing your lashes will go the course even if you can’t.\n\nEylure Accent Lashes 003\n\nDelicate by nature, Eylure 003 are a great choice - cruelty-free and vegan-friendly. These lashes are a nod to subtlety and quiet glamour.\n\nUse these lashes to accentuate the corners of your eye, create a wing, a flared effect with a graduated style that increases outwards. This classy soft lash style looks beautiful when applied, perfect for those that don’t require a full strip lash or an overly dramatic look.\n\nWho said natural couldn’t be glam? Not us, lash fans. What’s more, these Eylure Accent Lashes 003 are handmade - yes, you heard right - handmade.\n\nBareface vs the Natural Look\n\nWhile applauding the barefaced trend is on-trend, it's not always practical or possible in real life. Whether you're struggling with breakouts, don't have time to apply a full face of makeup or just prefer the natural look, false eyelashes are a great way to enhance your appearance without looking like you're wearing any makeup or trying too hard.\n\nTalented MUAs (makeup artists) on Instagram always extoll the virtues of fake lashes, and there are plenty of natural-looking options to choose from these days. It's a fact that false lashes open up the eyes, making the wearer look fresh and awake; who wants to look tired when you can look refreshed and fabulous?\n\nThere are two schools of thought regarding the natural look: either you love it or hate it. We think there's a place for both, but if you're leaning more toward the natural look, check out online tutorials and if you want something more statement-y, read our blog on the 5 Best Magnetic Lashes of 2023 for Easy Application here.\n\nLash Check - Final Thoughts\n\nThere's no denying that natural-looking false eyelashes are having a moment, and we think they're here to stay. Whether you're looking for an everyday lash or something for a fabulous night out, there's a style for you.\n\nDo you have a favourite natural-looking lash? Do you love the barefaced and the ‘I woke up like this’ style? Do you love a naked face? Or do you prefer a full-face Kim K-style war paint image?\n\nHowever, you feel on this subject, love it or hate the whole thing, let’s hear about it in the comments below - speak up. We want your view."
