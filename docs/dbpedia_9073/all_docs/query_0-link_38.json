        "text": "On June 6, 1911, a Canadian woman named Anna Taylor patented the first artificial lashes, forever changing the beauty landscape.\n\nTaylor's invention paved the way for the mass production of false eyelashes, offering women across the globe access to voluminous lashes previously reserved for the elite. From the stages of Broadway to the silver screens of Hollywood, false lashes would quickly become a staple in the world of entertainment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThroughout history, longer lashes have symbolized beauty and allure. Anna Taylor didn't claim the first patented artificial lashes until 1911, but people were fixated on the idea of making their eyes more appealing long before that.\n\nThe ancient Egyptians, known for their extravagant makeup techniques, sought to achieve mesmerizing eyes framed by long lashes. To adorn their eyes and protect them from the harsh sun, they darkened their natural eyelashes with kohl and other substances. There's evidence that both women and men in ancient Egypt wore cosmetics.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWomen in ancient Rome also used kohl, along with burnt cork, to accentuate their eyes. And in the court of Queen Elizabeth I, women used berries to dye their eyelashes a shade similar to that of the queen's hair, which was a novel shade of red at the time.\n\nPeople were no less obsessed with their lashes when the Victorian era arrived. Eugene Rimmel, Queen Victoria's perfumer and the eventual founder of the Rimmel makeup brand, created the first mascara from coal dust and Vaseline (which, by the way, has been around since 1870).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeople sometimes credit American film director D.W. Griffith with inventing artificial eyelashes, but there's little to no evidence to support this claim.\n\nAs the story goes, Griffith was working on his film \"Intolerance\" in 1916. Known for his attention to detail in important scenes, he recognized the impact of long lashes under electric lights.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo enhance the eyes of actress Seena Owens, he asked the film's wigmaker to glue human hair onto her eyelids using spirit gum, effectively creating a set of false eyelashes.\n\nThis story may or may not be true, but it's certainly false that Griffith invented fake lashes since Taylor had already patented her idea five years prior.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust as the popularity of fake eyelashes was starting to soar in the United States and Canada, people's fascination with makeup was taking off, too. These beauty standards were on display in Hollywood more prominently than anywhere else.\n\nMax Factor, a Russian maker of cosmetics who emigrated to the U.S. in 1914, developed a close relationship with the film industry and was soon supplying the studios with eye shadow, eyebrow pencils and other products. The makeup artists on film sets used these new tools to make their actors and actresses look good on the big screen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 1916, Factor began making his makeup available to the public, transforming the way women of that day and age approached eye makeup. In doing so, he kicked off a beauty revolution and set the foundation (pun intended) for what the beauty industry would become.\n\nBy the 1930s, curling eyelashes was also en vogue. The first device for curling lashes was patented on April 7, 1931, with the design looking virtually no different from the devices you see on the market today.\n\nAdvertisement"
