The glue is soooo good and works in numerous climates. 3. Customer service is top notch! I will now be a loyal Lavish Lashes customer ❤️”\n\nAgatha Valentin\n\n“It’s been a week since I took my first lash training . I was given the option to bring my own model, or one provided for me. It was an amazing experience! My instructor Kasey, is super knowledgeable and patient, thoroughly explaining the philosophy of what we’re doing and the importance of technique. I felt super comfortable and confident in a matter of minutes. I’m glad I got to meet Kasey and highly recommend taking her course.”\n\nCarla Ernest\n\n“Lavish Lashes we’re outstanding and their staff were the nicest ever! I had been thinking about getting eyelash extensions for quite some time but was reluctant to invest when I wasn’t sure I would like what I would got. As a mature woman, I certainly needed some help with my lashes but I didn’t want to look overdone. MJ and her team took the time to listen, explain the process and understand what I was looking for. Kacey did a fantastic job of giving me natural looking lashes while boosting their impact. My lashes look like they did when I was young! I couldn’t be happier and I highly recommend Lavish Lash!”\n\nMariah Sokoloski\n\n“I have now taken two Lavish Lashes classes, Basics & Advanced. I previously had taken a lash training while in cosmetology school, but I had left feeling like there was still so much to learn. Lavish was suggested by a friend who had also taken the class and I am glad that I did. My instructor was extremely knowledgeable and gave me helpful feedback after watching me work. With the small class size it was easy to ask questions and get one on one help when needed. She gave me tips and tricks on placement, speed, how to make a successful start in the industry, and much more. I would suggest this class to anyone that is interested in getting into lashes.”\n\nAutumn Hollingsworth\n\n“Such an amazing lash extension training! Very in depth and you get a lot of hands on practice! The instructor will work with you 1 on 1 and is always there to make sure you thoroughly understand everything! So glad I chose Lavish Lashes to get certified!”\n\nMindi\n\n“I recently switched from another competitor's glue to Lavish Lashes for a few reasons. 1.
