        "text": "In Australia and other countries, mink lashes have become popular. They’re mink fur that’s been shaved off a mink’s body (either right before or directly after the animal is killed on a fur farm) that are then glued in strands to a human’s eyelashes for a “fuller and thicker” look.\n\nMink lashes are often sold as “100 per cent cruelty-free” or “safely collected from a free-range farm” or even “taken only after the minks have been brushed“.\n\nIn fact, though, minks are confined to small, depressing, cramped wire cages in highly unsanitary conditions.\n\nMinks are the most commonly farmed fur-bearing animals in the world. They’re bred and slaughtered on fur farms around the world for their fur, and farmers often kill them in gas chambers. If you purchase a mink fur coat or a set of mink lashes, you’re supporting an industry in which animals endure immense fear, stress, disease, parasites, and other physical and psychological hardships.\n\nFear not, though—cruelty-free false lashes are available everywhere! Not only are they affordable and accessible, they’ll also add the perfect touch to your glam or everyday look.\n\nPETA and its international affiliates have been campaigning against the mink fur eyelash industry, with cosmetics retail giants Sephora and MECCA, as well as eyelash brand Velour announcing bans on fur lashes in 2020.\n\nMeanwhile, beauty company Lilly Lashes is still selling mink lashes, and using false marketing to mislead customers into thinking that they’re buying an animal-friendly product. Please, help animals who are suffering right now by urging Lilly to drop fur lashes immediately!"
