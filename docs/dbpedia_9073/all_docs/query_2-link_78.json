        "text": "Eyelash extensions have been a fashion trend for more time than most people think. The desire to have luscious lashes has transformed dramatically since their beginning in 3500 B.C. While the reasons to have long eyelashes were more symbolic back then, today, they are an indication of beauty.\n\nLet's look at the history of eyelash extensions, where eyelash extensions originate, and what makes them such a popular procedure even today.\n\nThe Origins of False Eyelashes\n\nThe first false eyelashes were nothing like those that are so popular among celebrities and fashion-forward people today. This article will delve into how lush eyelashes became desirable. It will also answer the questions: when were eyelash extensions invented? And, why were eyelash extensions invented?\n\nThe Ancient Beginnings\n\nWhere do eyelash extensions come from? According to beauty magazine, Marie Claire, the Ancient Egyptians began using brushes and ointments to attain fluttery, voluminous lashes in 3500 B.C. In Egypt, it wasn’t only women who sought to extend their eyelashes. Men and women alike used different materials, like malachite, to darken their lashes. It also said that they desired long lashes to protect their eyes from the beating sun.\n\nSome years later, around 753 B.C., the Romans desired luminous lashes. After ancient philosopher Pliny the Elder asserted that short eyelashes were a sign of aging, the Romans adopted eyelash enhancement practices.\n\nThey used materials like burnt cork and coal to achieve such a glamorous look. The Romans also believed long eyelashes were symbols of morality and virginity.\n\nThe Middle Ages\n\nEyelash extensions went in and out of fashion as time continued. In the middle ages, people wanted no part of the false eyelash fad that would soon dominate mainstream culture. Having too much hair was viewed as erotic. Women would pluck out their lashes and eyebrows in an attempt to show off more of their foreheads.\n\nThe methods they used were dangerous because eyelashes serve the important function of keeping dust and debris out of the eyes. Fortunately, this trend went out of style quickly. By the late 19th century, women were seeking out some of the strangest eyelash-enhancement techniques.\n\nThe 19th Century\n\nQueen Victoria's perfumer, Eugene Rimmel, created the first mascara in the mid-1800s. His eyelash concoction contained Vaseline jelly and coal dust. The creation caught on quickly, becoming a staple of fashion in the 1800s and evolved the history of eyelash extensions.\n\nIn 1882, a report showed that Parisian women sewed hairs on their eyelids for enhancement. Later, women began transplanting their hair onto their eyelids, according to an article published in 1899. Around the same time, there were even reports of women getting eyelashes implanted with needles. The transplantation method didn’t seem to catch on. However, by the 20th century, makeup artists began experimenting even more.\n\nArtificial Eyelashes Are Patented\n\nIn 1911, a Canadian inventor named Anna Taylor patented artificial eyelashes. Her invention included glue-on lashes, or strip lashes, that were thought to be made from human hair. A few years later, German hairdresser, Karl Nessler, provided false eyelash services at his New York City salon. According to the New York Times, Nessler advertised his services as “a guard against the glare of electric lights.”\n\nIt wasn’t until 1916, during the filming of the movie, Intolerance, that artificial eyelashes began making waves. After watching clips of Seena Owen’s performance, director D.W. Griffith noticed something was lacking. He decided Owen's eyes didn't stand out enough. He swiftly rectified that by appointing the wig-maker to create larger eyelashes for her.\n\nThe wig maker’s technique included weaving human hair through gauze and gluing them to the actress's eyelids. Owen suffered some mild puffy eyes from the gimmick, but that didn’t stop the eyelash craze that would soon follow.\n\nThe Influence of the Media\n\nAfter Seena Owen’s influential eyelash debut, the bigger eyelashes women could achieve, the better. In the 1920s and 30s, advertisements of women adorned with huge eyelashes and bright colors appeared in Vogue.\n\nMany male reporters scoffed at this trend. They publicly criticized it and proclaimed fake eyelash wearers were “temptresses.” However, movie stars began wearing them with fervor after this. Stars like Marilyn Monroe, Judy Garland, and Rita Hayworth all flaunted their voluminous lashes. Of course, this trend sparked even more popularity for lash enhancement. By the 1950s, fake eyelashes became a staple in Western culture.\n\nEye Makeup manufacturers evolved with growing demand. They swapped hair for the more readily available plastic in the 1950s. After this, the materials began to get even more advanced, and the trend grew. In the 1960s, bold, dramatic eyes, intensified with fierce eyelashes, became the new makeup trend.\n\nWomen sought to look like supermodel Twiggy, known at the time for her doughy, doll-like eyes. Then, in the 70s and 80s, the falsie fad began to fade. However, the brief hiatus of fake eyelashes didn’t last long, coming back full-swing in the 1990s.\n\nModern Eyelash Extensions\n\nDuring the 1990s and 2000s, semi-permanent lash extensions were born. It was at this time that people started seeking more natural lashes. The application methods also became much more precise.\n\nThese methods, popular in Korea many years before, were only introduced to the US in 2004. The new eyelash extensions got applied in small clusters with glue onto existing lashes—this technique allowed for the newly embedded eyelashes to last for weeks until the natural eyelashes fell out.\n\nMany celebrities declared their devotion to using lash extensions, including Jennifer Lopez, Paris Hilton, and Lindsay Lohan. More recently, Kim Kardashian and Katy Perry showed off their love of eyelash extensions. These celebrities have perpetuated the trend in mainstream culture, paving the way for extravagant, eccentric looks.\n\nThe Eyelashes We Know Today\n\nThe semi-permanent eyelashes that are widely used today are made from almost any material you can imagine. Synthetic fibers, silk, and animal hairs are some of the substances used in eyelash extensions today. These materials are much easier to apply and generally more lightweight than their ancestors.\n\nStrip lashes are the temporary, glue-on eyelashes that Anna Taylor invented in 1911. Today, they are made from different materials but still achieve a similar effect. No lash technician is necessary to apply strip lashes, making them a more viable option for many people. They are usually easy to apply and often cost less than a lash extension treatment.\n\nAnother form of strip lashes used today is magnetic lashes. They were invented in 2014 by the founder of One Two Cosmetics, Katy Stoka. Magnetic lash extensions are placed around the natural lashes to cling to each other. The clinging effect often creates a more voluminous look than their glue-on counterparts. Though magnetic eyelashes have become more popular since their invention, glue-on eyelashes are still the most pervasive of the two.\n\nEyelash Extensions today\n\nThe eyelash extension craze is being kept alive today with credit to the social media world. Makeup tutorials have become super popular on Youtube, with many YouTubers sharing videos about how to apply eyelash extensions. Celebrities and influencers have also shared their luscious lash looks with the world on Instagram and other social media platforms.\n\nSemi-permanent eyelashes have allowed people to wake up without worrying about gluing lashes to their lids. Even better, the history of eyelash extensions has evolved from gluing human hair or some other strange material to the eyelids and is no longer necessary to get that luminous lash look.\n\nHowever, thanks to all the past attempts at achieving beautiful eyelashes, so many types of lash extensions persist today, as well as permanent makeup, such as microblading, microshading, powder brows, combo brows and more.\n\nIf you want to continue learning more about lash extensions, check out the “The Ultimate Guide to Eyelash Extensions”.
