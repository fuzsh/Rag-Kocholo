Despite the variation, fake lashes became less popular, as natural lashes were considered more fashionable.\n\n1980s: Return to Glamour\n\nThe 1980s saw a return to more glamorous, exaggerated beauty looks, with false lashes and mascara once again becoming popular. Pop stars like Madonna and Cyndi Lauper helped to popularize these beauty trends.\n\n1990s: Understated Looks\n\nThe 1990s saw a move towards more natural beauty looks, with minimal makeup and natural lashes becoming popular. Supermodels like Kate Moss and Cindy Crawford helped to popularize these beauty trends.\n\n2000s to Now: Bold Lashes\n\nFalse lashes and mascara became popular again in the 2000s, with trends like thick, dramatic lashes and bold, colourful mascaras.
