        "text": "Those who partake in the eyelash salon services couldn’t imagine a world where lash care, lash beauty, and eyelash extensions didn’t exist! As the go-to salon for eyelash extensions in Houston, TX, Chic Lash Boutique is full of staff and artists that love every aspect of eyelash extension craft, including the history! Now, historical lessons are not typically something we write about in our articles. Still, we thought it would be fun to explore some of the histories behind eyelash extensions and look into why the art has lasted so long and continues to be popular today. We promise this won’t be a boring lesson from your 10th-grade global studies class!\n\nBook Your Visit to Houston’s Premier Lash Extension Salon!\n\nEyelash Extensions - Who Started the Movement?\n\nThe history books agree that the Ancient Egyptians were among the first documented cultures to enhance the look of their eyelashes actively. The tools and techniques at the time were limited, compared to today’s standard, but hey, it was 5000 years ago! Ancient Egyptians would line their eyes with a substance called Kohl, which is an eye cosmetic made of salts and earth metals, even lead. The Kohl was mixed with water, and get this, crocodile dung, to create a beauty product applied to the eyelashes to give them volume and length! Although this is not technically lengthening eyelashes with false lashes, it’s an example of beauty products used to change the eyelashes’ look, length, and styling. You could say that the Ancient Egyptians were the pioneers of lash care and beauty.\n\nMicroblading in Houston - Click the Link to Learn About the Service and Get Answers to Your Questions!\n\nEyelash Extensions - The Modern Era of Lashes\n\nThe modern eyelash extension/false lash was invented at the turn of the 20th century. A German inventor named Karl Nessler created a process for weaving artificial lashes, which he patented. Nessler is also credited with inventing the first electric hair-curling machines, which started the popularity of waves, curls, and perms in women’s hairstyles. After Nessler patented his process for making/weaving lashes, a Canadian woman named Anna Taylor soon created her own patent for artificial eyelashes, which were the first to infiltrate the stylings of Hollywood. Beautiful and extravagant eyelashes of the 1910s and 1920s took the beauty world by storm, and this was mostly because Hollywood top stars were receiving eyelash extensions for their on-screen time. Hollywood had set the standard for seductive, sexy eyelashes, and women all around the United States wanted to embody the Hollywood lash look as well! The craze of eyelash extension love would grow even more from the 1930s through the 1960s; who wouldn’t want to look like Elizabeth Taylor in Cleopatra!?\n\nEyelash Extensions Today\n\nThe modern era of eyelash extensions has changed since the 1960s. There are more options for different types of lashes and styles. Now, not every lash extension is meant to be as dramatic as a Hollywood movie star from the 60’s - there are many subtle stylings to fit different needs for different personalities!
