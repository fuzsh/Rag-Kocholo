        "text": "Full, fluttery lashes. They make your eyes pop - with or without makeup - but what if you weren’t blessed with envy-inducing fullness and length? Is the answer lash growth serum? Let’s find out!\n\nHow Lash Growth Serum Works\n\nEyelash growth serums are a lush lash-enhancing combination of ingredients, like vitamins and peptides that work together to improve the condition, strength, and shine of your natural lashes.\n\nJust like moisture is the key to healthy skin, moisture is also crucial for healthy lashes. Without moisture, they’re prone to break easily.\n\nThe most common active ingredient in the best lash growth serums is Biotin. It’s a B vitamin said to improve the health of hair (including eyelashes) by strengthening keratin, the protein that makes up hair.\n\nBasically, lash growth serums help your natural lashes bring their A-game, keeping them strong against external aggressors to limit the number of breakages.\n\nNow, let’s dive into some of the myths and facts about lash growth serum!\n\nYou’ll Get Great Results With Natural Lash Growth Serum (Fact)\n\nIf you’re wondering “What products make your eyelashes grow?” you have a range of options available from natural to synthetic formulations.\n\nThe problem is, some synthetic formulations contain chemical ingredients that are more likely to trigger an adverse reaction to the sensitive eye area.\n\nThe good news? Your eyelash growth serum doesn’t need to be packed with toxic hard-to-read ingredients to deliver gorgeous lash results. Natural serums strengthen the integrity of the hair follicle making them thicker and more resistant to breakage.\n\nIf you’re trying to decide between synthetic and natural serums, it’s important to know that many synthetic serums contain hormone-like ingredients. These ingredients trigger hair growth but it’s usually quite thin and there can be side effects.\n\nSerums made in Australia in TGA approved labs cannot contain any harmful ingredients- they’re generally much safer to use.\n\nPONi’s Lash & Brow Growth Serum is a cruelty-free, vegan formulation free of harmful ingredients. Instead, it’s packed with good-for-lash ingredients like peptides which stimulate thicker and longer lashes, vitamins to strengthen hair, and amino acids and plant oils to help prevent existing lashes from falling out.\n\nThe Results Are Permanent (Myth)\n\nThe best eyelash growth serums can help your lashes reach truly flutter-worthy lengths, but the results aren’t permanent.\n\nYou do need to maintain the use of your lash growth serum application to continue to see the results.\n\nOnce you stop, your eyelashes will gradually return to their previous appearance over several weeks. One of the big benefits of eyelash serum is the moisture it adds to your lashes to prevent brittleness and breakages. It’s like moisturiser for your skin, if you stop using it, your skin - and in this case, lashes - return to a dry state.\n\nYou Must Remove Contact Lenses Before Lash Serum Application (Fact)\n\nDo you wear contact lenses? Remove them before applying the serum to your lash line.\n\nSome formulations contain ingredients, particularly benzalkonium chloride which is used as a preservative, that can be absorbed by the contact lens. Wait 15 minutes before putting contact lenses back in.\n\nThe More Eyelash Serum You Apply, The Better (Myth)\n\nDousing your eyelashes in serum won’t improve their condition any quicker or make them grow faster.\n\nEyelash growth serums are highly concentrated and the best results come from consistent applications rather than the amount of product you use. Applying excess product is simply a waste!\n\nYou Need To Be Consistent To See Results (Fact)\n\nYou don’t hit the gym once and expect to stroll out with killer abs, right?\n\nSame goes for eyelash growth serum. You need to be consistent to see the very best results - and it does take time.\n\nYour dedication and patience will be well worth it when you’re rocking the lushest lashes ever. Most eyelash formulations take anywhere between 3 - 6 weeks to see results.\n\nYou Can't Use Lash Growth Serum with Eyelash Extensions (Myth)\n\nEyelash extensions are high maintenance and yes, they can cause damage to your natural lashes over long periods. Help counteract any possible damage by using eyelash growth serum.\n\nIt will help you maintain the health of your natural lashes by providing some much needed conditioning and strengthening treatment. Don’t forget to check that the eyelash serum you’re using is safe to use with extensions and always wait 24-48 hours after lashes are applied to ensure the glue is completely set.\n\nCan You Use Lash Serum on Eyebrows?\n\nWhile most lash serums are for eyelashes only, the PONi serum is ideal for both nautral eyelash and eyebrow growth. With the PONi Lash and Brow Growth Serum, wave goodbye to sparse lashes and patchy brows with a two-in-one solution. Boost natural growth for thicker, darker and longer lashes and brows.\n\nPONi’s Lash & Brow Growth Serum\n\nIf you’ve got your sights set on lush, long lashes (who hasn’t!?) we recommend PONi’s Lash & Brow Growth Serum - our much loved, natural, lash growth serum we mentioned earlier.\n\nYou’ll get double the results from this little beauty. It boosts natural growth for thicker, darker and longer lashes and brows.\n\nTo use PONi Lash & Brow Growth Serum, remove brush application, and carefully wipe away excess serum on the inside of the tube. Apply to clean, dry skin along the lash line. Repeat on the other eyelid without redipping.\n\nAllow 2-3 minutes for the serum to dry and begin by applying every second day for 2 weeks then follow with daily application.\n\nLearn More About Beauty and Cosmetics\n\nWhat is Tubing Mascara?\n\nThe Best Mascara For Length And Volume"
