This section will highlight the unique characteristics of bulk lash providers in these three manufacturing countries.\n\nThe United States\n\nThe United States is a key player in the global eyelash extension supply chain. This country has a large population of bulk lash production in the North American region. Below are some characteristics of wholesale lash providers in this country.\n\nInfluenced by beauty trends and grooming culture: Bulk eyelash suppliers in the United States can quickly adopt the latest fashion and beauty trends in their production facility. This country also has a strong history of beauty and grooming, with many beauty salons and spas offering lash extension services for various customer bases. This country’s lash and beauty industry is also influenced by influencers and celebrities on social media channels.\n\nBeing innovative in lash products and services: Most bulk lash suppliers in the United States have high consumer awareness.

This market will continue to broaden due to the rising demand for eyelash extensions and the improved income of Chinese people.\n\nMajor industrial hubs: Qingdao in Shandong Province, or the “Eyelash Capital,” is the primary production hub for lash extension manufacturing in China and globally. This region accounts for approximately 70% of global lash production, with various best eyelash suppliers.
