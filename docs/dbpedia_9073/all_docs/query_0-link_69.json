        "text": "Volume Lashes are when 2 or more very thin, individual eyelash extensions are handmade into a fan and applied to each natural lash. We hand make each fan during your appointment and never use pre-made or cluster lashes! Volume sets create fullness and texture that you may not have naturally. This is why it's an amazing option for those of you who have a sparse lash line, fine lashes, or if you just want an extra OOMPH to your beauty look!\n\nHave long lashes, but they all point downwards? This service uses a perm solution to lift and curl your natural lashes, giving them a more open and defined appearance\n\nThe results can last up to 6-8 weeks with very little maintenance required!\n\nAnd as a bonus, it comes with a black tint, leaving you with a more dramatic and defined look. Say hello to beautiful, lifted lashes with our lash lift service!"
