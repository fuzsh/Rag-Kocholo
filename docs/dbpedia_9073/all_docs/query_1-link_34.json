        "text": "Who wouldn’t love having long, fluttering, effortless lashes? As beautiful as eyelash extensions may be, they can cause eye infections, allergic reactions, and in some cases, more serious eye problems. Here are a few things to consider before wearing false eyelashes.\n\nEyelashes Protect Our Eyes\n\nOur natural eyelashes are very important! They are designed to reduce airflow into the eyes, keep out sweat and rain, and filter sunlight. The eye’s moisture is a protective shield, but when too much airflow enters the eyes, the moisture can evaporate, and dust and deposits can blow into the eye. The eyes are vulnerable to bacteria and debris, and you should never touch your eyes with unwashed hands, dirty makeup brushes, or foreign objects if you want to avoid injury or infection.\n\nSo What Are The Risks of Wearing Fake Eyelashes?\n\nIf you wear fake eyelashes or are considering doing so, it is important to know that anytime you have a foreign object near your eye there is a risk factor. The most common problems caused by false lashes are:\n\nEye Infections\n\nInfections can occur when bacteria collect under the eyelash glue and on the false eyelash itself. If you store and reuse your false lashes, or drop your eyelash onto a surface before applying, there is a risk of harmful bacteria and dirt entering the eye. Infections can also result from forgetting to clean your eyelids after removing fake lashes, or from sharing them with a friend, causing cross-contamination, which can lead to styes or conjunctivitis.\n\nAllergic Reactions\n\nSome people have an allergic reaction to the glue used to hold lashes in place, as it often contains formaldehyde, but a small number may actually be allergic to the fiber used to make the fake eyelashes themselves. Allergic reactions to lashes can cause stinging, burning, swelling, or a rash. Severe allergic reactions require a visit to the emergency room, to prevent any loss of vision or further complications.\n\nDamage to Your Natural Lashes\n\nUnfortunately, fake eyelashes may also cause temporary or permanent loss of your real eyelashes. Taking the fake lashes off can break your natural lashes, and even damage the hair follicle. When this happens, your own lashes can fail to grow back.\n\nEye Injuries\n\nPutting small objects near the eye always risks corneal injury. This can be pretty serious if, for example, the fake eyelashes irritate the cornea or if the glue thickens and falls into the eye scratching the cornea.\n\nHow Can I Avoid Eye Problems Associated With False Eyelashes?\n\nThe best solution to avoiding the eye problems associated with fake eyelashes is to choose not to wear them, but if you must, try to keep your eyes safe by:\n\nLimiting the amount of glue used\n\nAvoiding lashes with glitter or jewels\n\nBeing extremely gentle when removing the lashes\n\nCleaning the eyelid after removing the lashes\n\nAvoiding glue with formaldehyde\n\nNever sharing your lashes with others\n\nWhat Are the Signs I Have an Eye Problem?\n\nIf you develop any of the following symptoms after wearing false eyelashes, see an eye doctor immediately for treatment:\n\nPain\n\nRedness\n\nSoreness\n\nSensitivity to light\n\nDischarge\n\nFever\n\nBlurred vision\n\nSwelling\n\nContact Your Austin and Kyle, TX Eye Doctor Today!"
