This scenario spiked the consumer demand for hygiene and grooming products.

For instance, Alibaba.com, a Chinese e-commerce giant, reported 150% growth in its revenues from the eye makeup products category in the week ending 18th February 2020. However, incidents of shutting down lash salons and hypermarkets due to government-imposed COVID-19-related lockdowns and restrictions in many countries impacted the market growth.\n\nFalse Eyelashes Market Trends\n\nRising Demand for Customized Eyelashes is a Prominent Trend\n\nRising consumer preference for customized fake eyelashes is offering newer market growth opportunities.
