        "text": "What are Eyelash Extensions?\n\nEyelash Extensions are the amazing beauty treatment that has taken the world by storm over the past ten years. Imagine greeting each new day by waking up with beautiful, full lashes that will not only look fantastic, but also feel just like your own. Gone are the days of having to apply mascara ever again! Instead, enjoy having beautiful lashes week in and week out.\n\nLash extensions are synthetic fibers that are individually attached to the natural lashes using a professional, medical-grade adhesive. With proper placement, lash extensions can make the eyes appear wider, more open, and lifted. With proper care, lash extensions should last up to six weeks (90 days) before all the extensions shed during your body's natural hair growth / hair shed cycle.\n\n​\n\nWhat takes place during the initial Lash Consultation?\n\nAfter completing your Client Consultation & Consent Form, we'll take time to discuss the lash \"look\" you desire. We'll talk about what lash type (classic or volume) / lash thickness /curl shape you're looking for and I'll suggest the design shape that might work best for you and your eye shape. The options are limitless - everything from naturally understated to extreme glamour is possible - It's all up to you! The best part? No two clients are the same, so I get to custom tailor something specifically for you, to achieve your desired look based on your natural lashes.\n\n​\n\nWhat the difference between Classic Lashes vs Volume Lashes?\n\nFun Fact: The number of eyelashes on each individual's eyelid range widely, but usually range from 150 to 200 individual hairs!\n\nThe “Classic” Lash technique is where one single synthetic lash is applied to each individual natural lash. This technique is also known as the 1 to 1 method.\n\nClassic Lashes are suitable for the following clients:\n\n- Clients that have a good amount of healthy, natural lashes that would like to add length.\n\n- Clients that only have a few gaps in their lashes.\n\n- Clients that desire a natural effect but with added fullness.\n\n​\n\nThe “Volume” (2-3 D) Lash technique is where 2-3 lashes are applied to one natural lash. These lashes are a thin, lighter and fluffier lash giving you a fuller look by adding more volume and texture. This lash look can be achieved without adding additional weight or compromising the integrity of your natural lashes.\n\nVolume Lashes are suitable for the following clients:\n\n- Clients that have a good amount of healthy natural lashes that would like to add fullness/thickness.\n\n- Clients that may have some gaps in their lashes.\n\n- Clients that desire a more dramatic effect, with added fullness.\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nHow do I prepare for the service?\n\nYou should thoroughly clean your lashes with a mild cleanser. Use an oil-free makeup remover to remove any eye makeup and clean your lashes prior to the application. If you regularly wear false lashes or waterproof mascara, spend extra time cleaning your lashes before your service. Try to avoid caffeinated beverages or medications that may cause you to feel jittery, thus causing your eyelid to flutter or pulse during the application.\n\n​\n\nWhat does the Application Process entail?\n\nA new, full set of lashes takes about 2 hours (120 minutes), so please be prepared for that (mentally, physically, your schedule, etc). You'll get to lie down and relax on my memory foam-topped treatment bed... and what happens next is entirely up to you! You can either choose to take a \"lash nap\", meditate, and chill out with the background music, or you can chat with me about anything you want. Many of my clients choose the former, and tell me that they think of our time together as their special \"me\" time in which they can relax and unwind. Please consider my studio a sanctuary from the hustle and bustle of everyday life!\n\n​\n\nHow long do lash extensions last?\n\nEyelash extensions are semi-permanent and I only use professional-grade adhesives specifically designed for lash extension application. The adhesive, while strong, is not super/hair/nail glue and therefore lash extension shedding can and will occur. Additionally, your natural lashes go through a growth cycle (much like the hairs on your head) and will therefore shed. The result is that you'll have a new set of natural lashes every 90-100 days. While your eyelash extensions can last up to 6 weeks, they will become noticeably less full during that time. Therefore, I recommend touch-ups, or a \"Lash Fill\", every 2-3 weeks (depending on your retention) in order to keep the lash set looking full and fabulous.\n\n​\n\nWhat does a Lash Fill Appointment consist of?\n\nFun Fact: The average person sheds 1-4 eyelashes per eye, per day. This natural occurrence is even more noticeable during \"Spring & Fall Shed\".\n\nIt is highly recommended that a Fill Appointment be scheduled every 2-3 weeks in order to maintain the health and integrity of your natural lashes, as well as to ensure that your lash extensions have not grown out more than 2mm from your lash base. If a client waits too long and the lash extensions have grown out past 2mm, the lashes can become \"top heavy\". This can result in eye irritation, possible long term damage to the hair follicle, and even breakage of your natural lashes. During a lash fill, I remove any outgrown lash extensions, replace them with new ones, and add fresh lashes to your new natural lash growth.\n\n​\n\nHow do you Remove lash extensions?\n\nPlease do not attempt to remove your lash extensions by yourself, as you may damage your natural lashes. Come in and let me professionally remove them with a special formulated gel or cream remover. Or, let the eyelash extensions slowly fall out by themselves. ​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nMy customer service promise to you:\n\nYour eye and natural lash health is my top priority. In my studio, you'll find:\n\nEach pair of application forceps are sterilized prior to each application, destroying any potentially harmful organisms\n\nAbsolutely NO double dipping! Disposable applicators and containers are used only once for each product used during services. This prevents any potential for person-to-person contamination.\n\nPillow guards are placed on the pillow and are disposed of and changed between each client.\n\nHands are washed between each client application. Hand sanitizer is also used before touching implements or your face or eye area.\n\nI use lint-free, soothing gel eye pads for your comfort and protection during service.\n\nI only use the highest quality PBT synthetic lashes available on the market today. Even though they are sometimes referred to as \"mink lashes\", this term is used to describe the type of synthetic lash being used. I do not use animal or real human hair products.\n\nI do not \"count\" the number of extensions that I apply on a client. I apply as many lashes as it takes to provide you with the look you desire.\n\n​\n\nYour satisfaction is my #1 goal. If you're not happy, then I'm definitely not happy! If you happen to experience any issues with your lashes after an appointment, please reach out to me within 72 hours, so that I can work to resolve the problem.\n\n​\n\nI am a licensed, insured, and certified trained lash technician. I use only professional-grade products. I choose to work in a safe environment, follow the highest standards in sanitation and hygiene guidelines, and truly care about your eye and natural lash health. Let's work together to give you the lashes of your dreams!​\n\nDownload a copy of the Client Consultation & Consent Form HERE\n\nDownload a copy of Lash Extensions Aftercare Instructions HERE"
