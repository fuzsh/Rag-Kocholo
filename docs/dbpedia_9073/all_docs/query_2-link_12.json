        "text": "Report Overview\n\nThe global false eyelashes market size was valued at USD 1.62 billion in 2021 and is expected to register a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.2% from 2022 to 2030. The growing trend of enhancing beauty through makeup, cosmetics, and beauty products is the factor driving the growth of the market. Moreover, varying fashion trends, increasing personal care consciousness, rising awareness of eye products by beauty experts, urbanization, and promotion on social media platforms by influencers drive market growth. Eye infection and injuries, owing to formaldehyde compound-based eyelashes, are the major restraint of the market. Large competition from local companies and governmental import/export limitations pose challenges to market development globally.\n\nFalse eyelashes are worn by women (sometimes men) to solidify the upper eyelashes. False eyelashes are available in multipack packages with individual lashes, clusters of lashes, or lash strips. Individual lashes or groups of lashes are useful areas that are thin, or at the outside part of the eyelid to accomplish a specific effect. Natural false eyelashes may be applied by a trained beautician and these are typically designed to be semi-permanent.\n\nCompanies have been largely reliant on social media influencers to make their brand image amongst buyers. Public figures on YouTube as well as Instagram frequently endorse these products and even post tutorials on how to properly apply the same. For instance, the Lashify brand has mainly promoted its false eyelash products through social media. Several beauty giants depend on social media influencers to endorse their products. For instance, Estée Lauder spends around 75.0% of its marketing expenditure on such influencers.\n\nThere has been an increase in the use of false eyelashes by millennials and youngsters following the growing fashion trends. In addition, false eyelashes are used by beauty artists as well as salons for wedding makeup. Apart from that, false eyelashes with light and sound sensors are available from several manufacturers meant for party and clubbing get-ups. Companies are offering an innovative range of false eyelashes with a major contribution from China.\n\nCOVID-19 had a negative impact on the global false eyelashes market. Due to the pandemic, the government imposed a strict lockdown and stopped production units. Sales crumpled to the lowest levels during the pandemic, as global demand fell amid the lockdown. Eyelash is a small part of the beauty and personal care industry and is used by people occasionally in case of parties, functions, and other events that were not being held in 2020 owing to the COVID-19 cases, globally, and restrictions on mass gatherings have declined sales in the market.\n\nProduct Insights\n\nThe individual segment is projected to attain the fastest CAGR of 6.6% during the forecast period. Individual false eyelashes are obtainable in single as well as flared forms, reliant on the inclination of the customers, and offer a natural yet dramatic look. Although these false eyelash extensions are accessible as both temporary and permanent alternatives, most consumers choose to wear them for a large time period as they are rather time intensive. Each lash, or cluster of lashes, has to be applied individually and typically needs the help of an expert.\n\nThe strip segment dominated the market in terms of share and is expected to expand at a CAGR of 6.1% during the forecast period. As strip false eyewear is the simplest and easy to wear, they are extremely famous among people who use false eyelashes regularly. These types of products cover the whole lash line in a single application, making it user-friendly. An additional benefit is that their application does not need professional help from salons and makeup artists. Moreover, strip false eyelashes are pre-styled and are available in different designs for a variety of occasions. Therefore, it is largely used all over the world and generated large revenue in 2021.\n\nConstituent Insights\n\nThe natural segment is estimated to expand at the fastest CAGR of 6.5% during the forecast period. These products are manufactured from mink hair, sable hair, human hair, or silk. They are relatively lighter, finer in texture, and very flexible than their equivalents. Their soft quality makes them similar to natural lashes and their lightweight feature makes them easy and suitable for regular use. Users can better avoid incidences of lash irritation by the usage of natural false eyelashes over other constituent types. Therefore, it is expected that the segment will expand at the fastest CAGR during the forecast period.\n\nThe synthetic segment is expected to increase with a CAGR of 6.0% during the forecast period. Synthetic lashes are manufactured from acrylic material, rubber, or polymers, and their supremacy is attributed to their cheapness. They are shinier as well as glossier than their natural counterparts and thus provide a more dramatic look. Owing to their firmness, they hold curls extremely well and are available in a range of thickness, length, curl, and style. Thus, the segment generated large revenue in 2021.\n\nDistribution Channel Insights\n\nThe online segment is projected to develop with the fastest CAGR of 8.1% during the forecast period. These channels have become largely famous among customers, mainly due to the convenience they provide. A number of makeup and beauty product companies have been setting up their websites, to ensure safety from fake products. Numerous websites offer large discounts several times a year, making some expensive products affordable to an extent. Thus, customers can save money while buying products of their choice online within their budget range without compromising on content, brand, and quality which is likely to drive the segment growth during the forecast period.\n\nThe convenience stores segment grabbed a considerable market in terms of share and is expected to expand at a CAGR of 5.4% during the forecast period. Maximum users of false eyelashes are very specific about the shape and make of this product and therefore choose to buy them from the stores instead of buying them online. Convenience stores provide assistance from experts, who not only mention products best suitable to their tastes but also clarify the application and care of the product.\n\nModern convenience stores have become a one-stop shop for an extensive selection of product categories. Therefore, this makes it suitable for consumers and boosts impulse purchases. Common examples of these include 7-Eleven, Family Mart, and Lawson. Therefore, the segment generated large revenue in 2021.\n\nRegional Insights\n\nAsia Pacific is anticipated to attain the fastest CAGR of 6.7% during the forecast period. Rising awareness about developing beauty trends and the availability of new and more effective products in the markets of India, China, South Korea, and the Philippines, among others, will drive the regional market during the forecast period.\n\nIncreasing consumer spending on Japan's and South Korean beauty products is likely to increase the growth of the region during the forecast period. Several leading companies such as MAC, Eylure, Ardell, and Kiss provide false eyelashes meant for a varied audience, smaller brands such as Doux Lashes, House of Lashes, AZLO Lashes, Velour Lashes, and Artémes Lashes are specially designed for Asian target audience. Thus, the region is likely to grow at the fastest CAGR during the forecast period.\n\nNorth America accounted for the highest market share of over 36.0% in 2021. This is attributed to the Celebrities and lash companies largely focused on promoting their products to build their business revenues from the U.S. and Canada. For instance, in May 2019, Kim Kardashian launched 'Mrs. West Bridal', a makeup collection in Los Angeles., A large development in the Hollywood industry led to the use of innovative as well as attractive cosmetic products in North America, which showcase a strong demand for false eyelashes within the region.
