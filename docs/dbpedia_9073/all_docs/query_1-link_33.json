        "text": "The claim: A prostitute invented fake eyelashes to protect her eyes from semen\n\nOn social media, a viral claim is forcing false eyelash wearers to confront the beauty accessory's alleged lewd history: Several popular images inaccurately claim a 19th century prostitute invented the cosmetic accessory to protect her eyes from bodily fluids.\n\n“Did you know ... that in 1882 London prostitute Gerda Puridle invented elongated eyelashes or ‘cumbrellas’ to block semen from getting in working girl’s eyes that are worn today as common fashion?” claims a meme, which was shared as early as Jan. 29.\n\nMore: Fact check: Conspiracy theory about military control of Washington is false\n\nThe false claim is accompanied by an image of contemporary French actress Alice Regnault. Regnault did not invent false lashes and she was not a prostitute.\n\nAnother viral image shows a screenshot of a Google search for “elongated lashes 1882,” which generates results that furthered the false claim. The search results appear to come from the meme website Americas Best Pics and Videos, where the meme was shared in late January.\n\nWhile Googling that phrase may have generated those results, that does not make the meme’s claim true.\n\nMore: Fact check: Biden executive order halts border wall construction, redirects funding\n\nUSA TODAY reached out to several Instagram and Facebook users who posted the claim.\n\nFake eyelashes were patented by Canadian inventor in 1911\n\nThroughout history, societies have coveted long eyelashes, and individuals have tried many techniques to meet these beauty standards.\n\nAccording to Marie Claire magazine, women and men in ancient Egypt darkened their eyelashes with kohl and ointments to protect their eyes from the desert sun.\n\nWomen in ancient Rome followed similar practices, believing long eyelashes indicated virtue.\n\nThe first cosmetic mascara was invented in the Victorian era by Queen Victoria's perfumer Eugene Rimmel.\n\nCanadian inventor Anna Taylor secured a U.S. patent for “artificial eyelashes” similar to those used in cosmetics today on June 6, 1911.\n\nAmerican film director D.W. Griffith was falsely credited with the invention, after he ordered a movie wigmaker to use hair to embellish silent film actress Seena Owen’s eyes during production of the 1916 film “Intolerance.”\n\nUSA TODAY could find no record of Gerda Puridle or any prostitutes using fake eyelashes for the purpose stated in the meme.\n\nMore: Fact check: Decades-old quote misattributed to Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene\n\nOur ruling: False\n\nThere is no evidence to support the tale that a 19th century London prostitute invented false eyelashes. Canadian inventor Anna Taylor patented false eyelashes similar to those worn today in 1911. We rate this claim FALSE.\n\nOur fact-check sources:\n\nNikki Lauria, Jan. 29, Facebook Post\n\nGalleriBalder, accessed Feb. 7, \"Portraits (1885 - 1900)\"\n\nLively Lashes, Feb. 2, Facebook Post\n\npaperboy713, accessed Feb. 7, America's Best Pics and Videos Post\n\nMarie Claire, Mar. 3, 2015, \"The History of Women and Their Eyelashes\"\n\nUnited States Patent Office, June 6, 1911, ANNA TAYLOR, OF OTTAWA, ONTARIO, CANADA.
