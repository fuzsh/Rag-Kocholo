        "text": "Introduction\n\nThe Greek word for eyelid is “blepharon,” from which is derived the prefix \"belpharo,\" which has been in use since antiquity. The Greek for an eyelash is “blepharida” which is not used in medicine today. The Latin for eyelid is “palpebra” and that for eyelash is “cilium” a word only in use since the early 18 century.\n\nEyelashes and eyebrows are important anatomical structures which are central not only in the face but central to all perceived human interactions. Eyebrow movement conveys emotions (sad, happy, angry, surprise, pensive, etc.) and eyebrows protect the eyes by relaxing the “curtain rods” that they effectively are when tired, thereby relaxing the upper eyelid skin and contributing to lid closure and eye protection. Eyebrow hair direction serves to protect the eyes from particulate matter and sweat.\n\nEyelashes and eyebrows have always been an essential part of facial beauty. They have been plucked, accentuated and modified in innumerable ways to enhance the beauty of the face and eyes in particular in many cultures. The Egyptians and the Indians have used materials like kohl to enhance brows and lashes for centuries. The emphasis of the eyes manifests in the modern world through the use of mascara, eyeliner, and eyeshadow. Curlers are used to exaggerate the natural curve of lashes. Although long lashes are prized in most cultures, certain cultures (the Hazda, the last of the hunter-gatherer tribes of Tanzania) trim their lashes.\n\nComparative Anatomy\n\nMammals have eyelashes; some, like the camel, have profoundly long lashes, long used to accentuate features in cartoons. Cows have long straight lashes which are medially oriented. A description of “cow lash deformity” is used when seen as a complication of blepharoplasty, often affecting the lateral third of the upper eyelid.[1] Other large mammals like horses also have similar long, relatively straight lashes.\n\nThe eyelash viper is said by some in South America to wink after striking its victim. The “lashes” are not lashes, but modified scales above the eyes. And, of course, snakes cannot wink as they have no eyelids!\n\nStructure and Function\n\nSurface Anatomy\n\nIn humans, there are 75 to 80 lasheson the lower eyelid., and the upper eyelid has 90 to 160 lashes. Lash length is variable from individual to individual: they do not grow beyond a certain length (usually less than 12 mm) and then fall off by themselves. Current thinking is that lash length is limited because the growth rate and the anagen phase are shorter than scalp hair. Eyebrow hairs may be longer, especially with age (Denis Healey brows). Eyelashes generally do not need trimming unless there is excessive growth (trichomegaly). Ms. You Jianxia of Shangai holds the world record for the longest eyelashes in 2018: her lashes measure 12.40 cm! After lash removal by pulling, it takes about eight weeks to grow back. Eyelash hair is not affected by puberty.\n\nLashes curve in all ethnicities. The curvature has been shown to occur because of asymmetric cell types along the concave and convex sides of the bulb. Similarly, this asymmetry is also present in curly hair. The curve of the lashes is more in Caucasians compared to Asians. Lashes have lift-up and curl-up angles which have been measured photographically producing a phototrichogram.\n\nCross-sectional Anatomy\n\nEach lash has a hair shaft that extends outside the skin, a root which is under the skin and a bulb which is the enlarged terminal portion. The inferior portion of the bulb is in direct contact with the dermal papilla, which has a vascular supply, allowing interactions which lead to follicle cycling. The lash has an inner medulla composed of cells, a surrounding medulla or cortex, which is stiffer and gives the lash strength and rigidity, and the outer concentric layer which is the cuticle. The cuticle, which is impermeable, protects the inner part of the lash.\n\nThe outermost layer, the cuticle is seven to ten layers thick and made up of transparent overlapping scales.\n\nThe next layer, the cortex is the thickest portion of the lash and is composed of keratin.; this layer contains melanin.\n\nThe eyelash follicle (follis, Latin for bag): the term follicle refers to the complex that is responsible for hair growth and is composed of the dermal papilla which is connective tissue with a capillary loop, the germinal hair matrix around the papilla and the lash root or bulb. The germinal layer has dividing cells which give rise to the hair, and the bulb is where the process of keratinization begins. The hair follicle embeds in the dermis of the eyelid (which has two layers, epidermis and dermis, as opposed to the scalp which has an epidermis, dermis and a hypodermis). Eyelash follicles are 2.4 mm deep in the upper lid and 1.4 mm in the lower lid. There are more active lash follicles in the upper lid compared to the lower lid (41% vs. 15%).[2]\n\nThe hair on the body has arrector pili muscles which straighten the hair in the cold or response to a strong emotion (fear, excitement) resulting in what is commonly termed “goose-bumps” or “goose pimples” because of the resemblance to plucked goose skin. The lash follicle has no arrector pili muscles. Therefore, lashes do not change position in these circumstances.\n\nLash follicles connect to two types of secretory glands:\n\nZeiss glands are holocrine glands which liberate the complete cell content, sebum, which acts as a lubricant and has antimicrobial properties.\n\nGlands of Moll are only found in eyelids and are apocrine, which means the cells fragment, thereby producing secretions which are thought to have antimicrobial properties.\n\nEyelash Pigmentation\n\nMelanocytes synthesize melanin by melanogenesis. Lashes seem to become gray or white much later than scalp hair. Continued expression of enzymes such as tyrosinase-related protein 2 (TRP-2), which influences melanocytes, is thought to be the reason. Scalp hair not only suffers depletion of melanocytes by apoptosis and oxidative stress but also reduced expression of enzymes like TRP-2. There has not been adequate study on the changes in lash pigmentation with age in different races.\n\nAerodynamics Around Lashes\n\nEyelashes have an essential role in the protection of the eye. Aerodynamic studies have demonstrated that the ideal lash should be one-third the width of the eye. Besides protecting the cornea from particulate matter, it appears that the aerodynamic flow of air because of the curve and density of lashes plays a role in corneal protection. The exact ways in which evaporation may be increased or decreased by lashes is unknown. Although in vitro studies have been attempted, there have been no in vivo studies performed on human lashes and corneas.\n\nLife Cycle of Lashes\n\nLashes grow at 0.12 to 0.14 mm per day (as compared to scalp hair which grows at 0.2 to 1.1 mm per day). The three phases of lash growth in the eyelash growth cycle are:\n\nThe growth phase when the root of the hair is dividing lengthening the shaft (anagen) which varies from four to ten weeks\n\nThe degradation phase (catagen) during which the lash converts to a club hair as the hair is cut off from the blood supply 15 days\n\nThe resting phase (telogen) which causes shedding of the hair, lasts four to nine months\n\nHalf the eyelashes are in an anagen phase: periocular hair has the lowest anagen to telogen ratio. After the telogen phase, the lash falls out, and the cycle begins anew with the anagen phase. The whole lash cycle is from four to eleven months.\n\nThe stages of the life cycle of lashes compared to the eyebrows and the scalp is as follows:\n\nEyebrows:\n\nAnagen phase, 4 to 7 months\n\nCatagen phase, 3 to 4 weeks\n\nTelogen phase, around 9 months\n\nScalp: genetically determined and varies from person to person\n\nAnagen phase, 2 to 8 years (can be longer)\n\nCatagen phase, 2 to 3 weeks\n\nTelogen phase, about 3 months\n\nLash microflora: Propionibacterium, Streptophyta, Staphylococcus, Corynebacterium, and enhydrobacter are common bacteria found on lashes. In the presence of blepharitis, Staphylococcus, Streptophyta, Corynebacterium, and Enhydrobacter increase. Ineterestingly, Propionibacteriumis often decreased in the presence of blepharitis.\n\nDemodex folliculorum and Demodex brevis are natural parasites which increase in numbers with age. By the age of 70 years, almost 100% of people will have these parasites. D. folliculorum live in eyebrows, scalp hair, ears and eyelashes, whilst D. brevis is found in the sebaceous oil glands in the face and in Meibomian glands. Inflammation of eyelids is caused when the parasite dies (bursts), releasing its contents which is inflammatory. Cylindrical debris is found around the lashes and is pathognomonic of demodex."
