        "text": "Before Your Appointment\n\nPlease arrive with clean lashes. Lashes that require intense makeup removal/cleansing need additional preparation.\n\nShould you need to cleanse your lashes, allow yourself an additional 10 minutes prior to your appointment time to cleanse them at our lash bath station at Hairy Little Things LA.\n\nAftercare\n\nBe gentle. Do not rub or pull on your eyelash extensions.\n\nKeep your extensions/lash lift dry for 24 hours after your appointment.\n\nYou may wash your face in the sink using a washcloth, avoiding the eye area.\n\nKeep all oil-based products away from the eyes and remember that everything on your face will travel to the eye area. Oil WILL breakdown the adhesive and you will have premature lash extension loss.\n\nNo saunas, facials, or swimming within 24 hours of application.\n\nDo not stick your head in the oven when baking, it can singe your extensions! Turn your head away from the oven when putting anything in or pulling anything out.\n\nWash your lash extensions (after the initial 24 hours) three to four days a week. Apply oil-free makeup remover with your fingers, rubbing gently down the lashes or you may apply oil-free makeup remover to your lashes using a disposable mascara wand. Spray onto wand, brush through lashes gently, and rinse with warm water.\n\nMascara should be washable and cannot be waterproof.\n\nDo not attempt to remove any lashes on your own, call us for an appointment.\n\nBrush your lashes daily.\n\nMaintenance\n\nEyelash extensions fills are like touch-ups for your extensions. Performed regularly, they’ll keep your lashes looking full and luscious. You may need them more or less often depending on your aftercare, your natural lash cycle, and the style of your initial set. Typically, clients get fills every 2-3 weeks, however some clients prefer to replace their full set every 4-6 weeks. In order to qualify for a fill, you must have 40% of your lashes remaining, otherwise, you will be re-booked for a full set. It is always recommended to schedule your fills in advance. Lash lift maintenance can be done every 6-8 weeks.\n\n​"
