Biology of the selected endangered species of sea cucumber PRESENTED BY: satyaveer Jr.M.F.SC\n\n2.  Holothurian commonly c/a sea slugs or Sea cucumber.  Sea cucumber is a group of economically important echinoderms.  Sea cucumbers are found on the sea floor worldwide.  The number of holothurian species worldwide is about 1717 with the greatest number being in the Asia Pacific region. INTRODUCTION\n\n3.  sea cucumbers have a soft and cylindrical body, more or less lengthened, rounded off and occasionally flat without solid appendages.  Their body shape is similar to a cucumber, but they have small tentacle-like tube feet that are used for locomotion and feeding.  Length -10 to 30 cm (3.9 to 11.8 in). smallest 3 mm (0.12 in) long, and largest 3 meters (9.8ft)  The body wall consists of an epidermis and a dermis and contains smaller calcareous ossicles. CHARACTERISTICS OF SEA CUCUMBER\n\n4. Longest sea cucumber 3 meter (10 ft.) Synapta maculata (Snake Sea) Thyonina bijui Smallest sea cucumber 2 cm\n\n5.  Most sea cucumber possess five rows of tube feet (called “PODIA“) but Apodida lacks these and moves by crawling. The podia on the dorsal surface generally have no locomotive role,and are transformed into papillae.  The anus is Postero-dorsal.\n\n6. PODIA Apodida\n\n7.  The gut of sea cucumber is long and coiled.  A long gut is advantageous in sea cucumber because they need to remove organic matter from the large amount of sediment they ingest.  Respiratory exchange through body surface.  They have complete digestive system.  Sea cucumbers have no true brain.\n\n8.  Sea cucumbers can be found at deeper in ocean floor. But some some species live on hard substrates like rock, coral reef etc.  Bentho pelagic sea cucumber( Enypniastes) , have webbed swimming structures enabling them to swim up off the surface of the seafloor and journey as much as 1,000 m (3,300 ft) up the water column.\n\n10.  Holothuroidea are generally scavengers.  The diet of most cucumbers consists of plankton and decaying organic matter found in the sea. Diet\n\n11.  Most sea cucumbers reproduce by releasing sperm and ova into the ocean water  Sexes are separate.  Spawning behavior tends to be seasonal.  Sea cucumber breed twice in a year.  Frist spawning season is March to May & 2nd Oct to Dec in Gulf of Mannar. Reproduction\n\n12.  Sea cucumbers have tough skins that probably lessen the risk of predation.  However, they do face the problem of being eaten by large marine fish PREDATORS\n\n13.  Many sea cucumber have evolved novel defensive mechanism that compensate for the lack of a spines.  Some secrete toxic substances when disturbed, some sp.  Discharge sticky filaments through the anus to discourage potential predators. DEFENSIVE MECHANISM Sea cucumber ejects sticky filaments from the anus in self-defense.\n\n14.  The sea cucumber is effective in treating cancer, arthritis, asthma heal internal, hypertension and other diseases.  Sea cucumber species were collected for processing as beche-de- mer (trepang).  Sea cucumber extracts are prepared and made into oil, cream, or cosmetics.  sea cucumber contains all the fatty acids necessary to play a potentially active role in tissue repair. Economical Uses and Biological Significance\n\n16.

Reproduction-  It reproduces annually during the summer dry season (May–August) and reproduction seems to be correlated with bright sunshine days and high phytoplankton productivity.\n\n29. Fisheries:  Parastichopus californicus is exploited in industrial fisheries by hand collection by trawling.  The fishery of this species in Washington (USA) started in the 1970s, later spreading to California, Alaska and Oregon. EXPLOITATION\n\n30.  Kingdom - Animalia  Phylum - Echinodermata  Class - Holothuroidea  Order - Aspidochirotida  Family - Holothuriidae  Scientific Name: Actinopyga agassizi  Common Name/s: Five-toothed Sea Cucumber  Red List Category & Criteria:Least Concern 5. Actinopyga agassizi Classification\n\n31. Size: Maximum length about 35 cm.  Sea cucumber species Nocturnal during the day, and inhabits rocky areas, sea grass beds and coral reefs (including coral reef lagoons) from shallow depths down to 54 m  Feeds on detritus in the seafloor  This species reproduces annually in July and August. Habitat and Biolgy\n\n32. Fisheries:  This species is harvested, without any regulation, with other sea cucumber species.  There is commercial exploitation for bêche-de-mer in Panama and Venezuela. Threats  Actinopyga agassizi is fished, however very little information is known about the areas and quantities in which it is fished.  Another potential threat is destruction of habitat in areas of high coastal development EXPLOITATION\n\n33.  Kingdom - Animalia  Phylum - Echinodermata  Class - Holothuroidea  Order - Aspidochirotida  Family - Stichopodidae  Scientific Name: Apostichopus japonicas  Common Name/s: Japanese Spiky Sea Cucumber  Red List Category & Criteria:Endangered 6. Apostichopus japonicus Classification\n\n34.  Apostichopus japonicus is found in shallow coastal bottom communities from the intertidal zone to depths of 40 m.  It forms aggregations, usually in the upper sub-littoral zone in the subtropics.  Juveniles are often associated with algal/sea grass and oyster beds. Feeding habit  Ingests organic matter, bacteria, protozoa, diatoms as well as plant and animal detritus and re-utilizes residual food and faeces. Reproduction  Matures considerably earlier than other temperate species, at about two years .  Larval duration for this species is 12-13 days .  This species typically grows to 20 cm in four years. Habitat and Biology\n\n35.  Sea cucumbers play a significant role in the ecological system.  They help turn over sand in reef lagoons and sea grass beds.  By feeding on dead organic matter mixed with sand and mud, the nutrients they excrete can be again taken up by algae and corals – a pathway of nutrient recycling on reefs.  Sea cucumbers have also been found to buffer reefs from ocean acidification.  Feeding on reef sand by tropical sea cucumbers increases the alkalinity in surrounding seawater.  This may help to protect corals and other reef organisms from ocean acidification. Ecological Role\n\n36.  sea cucumbers are at risk of extinction from their popularity on dining tables, appreciated for their soft texture, dietary and medicinal properties.  Sea cucumber are facing extinction due to over exploitation.  Due to illegal fishing .  Eutrophication of the water in areas of coastal development is another threat to this species.  An additional threat is the harvesting of mature adults for brood stock in aquaculture THREATS"
