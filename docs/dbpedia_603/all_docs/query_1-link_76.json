        "text": "Scientific Details\n\nScoliorhapis theeli has: 10 tentacles, each with 7 pairs of digits; mouth end of body densely covered with dark brown or purple papillae (small short soft finger-like projections); hook ossicles in clusters under the papillae, hooks 100-240 um (microns) long; body length about 170 mm long. Museum Victoria has many specimens of Scoliorhapis from Victorian waters. These specimens vary considerably and show a range of significant differences to Scoliorhapis theeli, such as being significantly smaller, having fewer tentacle digits, having papillae evenly distributed over the body, having scattered hooks in the body wall, and having smaller hooks.\n\nGeneral Description\n\nBody worm-like with thin soft body wall. No tube feet. Tentacles number 10 or 12 with up to 7 pairs of digits per tentacle. Up to 17 cm long.\n\nBiology\n\nThis is one of only two species from this genus recorded from Australian waters - the type specimens are from Port Jackson in New South Wales. However, the individuals found in Victoria show a range of significant differences from the species description suggesting that the correct identity of these individuals is unknown.\n\nHabitat\n\nSediment areas, to depth of at least 82 m.\n\nSoft substrates\n\nDistribution guide\n\nEastern and southern Australia."
