        "text": "Marine research program JC066 (JC067) in the southwest Indian Ocean on the RRS James Cook in November and December 2011 collected sea cucumbers with an ROV from the Atlantis Bank and Coral Seamount. Three new species are described: Amphigymnas staplesi O’Loughlin sp. nov.; Pannychia taylorae O’Loughlin sp. nov.; Psolus atlantis O’Loughlin sp. nov. Genera Amphigymnas Walsh and Pannychia Théel are reviewed. A lectotype for Pannychia moseleyi Théel is designated.\n\nNew discoveries of articulated partial skeletons of teleosts from Upper Turonian strata in the Bohemian Cretaceous Basin (BCB) are described. The infrequent occurrence of articulated skeletons is discussed and compared with comparable taxa from the same time-equivalent successions in southern England. The similarity suggests links between both regions during the Late Turonian. Some palaeoecological interpretations of the fishes are provided.\n\nFifteen morphotypes of deep-sea holothurians were documented by photography or videography at depths of 596–2,566 m, using Remote Operated Vehicles (ROV) video surveys and towed camera transects, during hydrocarbon exploratory activities in the Colombian Southern Caribbean. Most of the morphotypes were identified to the species level based on the images. The species belong to four orders, Apodida (1 species), Persiculida (3 species), Elasipodida (8 species), and Synallactida (3 species). Four species, three genera, and three families are reported for the first time in the Colombian Caribbean Sea. Some of the reports also represent first records for the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nSeveral surveys were conducted during the period of April, 2009 to July, 2010 at different sites of Andaman and Nicobar Islands to assess the diversity of echinoderms in coral reef enviornments by employing Self Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus (SCUBA) diving and snorkeling. Line intercept transect (Bradbury and Reichelt et.al., 1986), Quadrate methods (Endean and Stablum, 1973), Photoquadrate and underwater video transect method were applied to investigate the diversity and distribution of the Echinoderms. Underwater video sampling provides highly precise quantitative estimate of echinoderms and abundance of common benthic taxa. During SCUBA diving, species recording was made by underwater digital photography (Sony - Cyber shot, Model-T900, marine pack, 12.1 megapixels) for detailed identification."
