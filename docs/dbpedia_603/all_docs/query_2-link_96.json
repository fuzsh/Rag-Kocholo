Taxonomic Retrospect of Echinoderms:\n\n1. The members of the phylum Echino­dermata are known to mankind since an­cient times. Echinoderms were first given the status of a distinct group by Bruguiere in 1791.\n\nADVERTISEMENTS:\n\n2. But Jacob Klein (1734) is credited with coining the name Echinodermata.\n\n3. Linnaeus studied a number of Echinoderms, but placed Echinus, Asterias and Holothuria under Mollusca.\n\n4. Lamarck (1801) included the Echinoderms and medusoid coelenterates under the class Radiata.\n\n5. It was not until 1847 that Frey and Leuckart recognised the Echinoderms as a distinct taxon.\n\nADVERTISEMENTS:\n\n6. Huxley (1875) proposed a new name Deuterostomata and placed all the bilater­ally symmetrical coelomates under the group.\n\n7. The term Enterocoela including Chaetognatha, Echinodermata, Hemi- chordata and Chordata, was also used by many authors. The group Enterocoela seems to be synonymous with Deuterostomata. It is now established that the different groups under Deuterostomata or Enterocoela are widely separated for their structural diversi­ties and there is no justification to include them under one group.\n\n8. Metschnikoff (1881) included the Echinoderms and Hemichordates under Ambulacraria on the basis of striking resem­blances between the Echinoderm larvae and Tornaria larva of Hemichordata.\n\n9. In spite of the similarities between Echinoderms and Hemichordates, they are placed in separate groups.\n\n10. The names of Bather (1900), Mortensen and Lieberkind (1928), Cuenot (1948), Hyman (1955), Moore (1966-78), Barnes (1987) are to be mentioned for their out­standing and extensive treatise on different Echinoderms.\n\n2. Definition and Origin of Echinoderms:\n\nEchinoderms are bilaterally symmetrical (in larval stage) or pentamerous radially symmetri­cal (in adults) having mesodermal calcareous ossicles as exoskeleton, enterocoelom, water-vascular system and without distinct head.\n\nOrigin:\n\nPalaeontological record shows that all groups of modern echinoderms have their origin in early palaeozoic stock (Lower Cambrian) and predominate in Mesozoic and Caenozoic eras (R. C. Moore, 1977).\n\n3. Characteristic Features of Echinoderms:\n\n1. The echinoderms are exclusively ma­rine, non-colonial and largely bottom dwellers.\n\nADVERTISEMENTS:\n\n2. The body exhibits radial and pentemerous symmetry in adult, but the larvae are bilaterally symmetrical.\n\n3. Distinct anterior end or head is lacking.\n\n4. The body is distinguishable into oral (bearing mouth) and aboral surfaces (surface away from the mouth).\n\n5. The surface of the body is covered by calcareous ossicles, warts or spines, derived from mesodermal tissue.\n\nADVERTISEMENTS:\n\n6. The oral surface of the body is marked by five equidistant radiating ambulacra with intervening grooves, called interambulacra.\n\n7. Mutable connective tissue is present.\n\n8. A spacious coelom is present, devel­oped as outgrowths of the archenteron, lined by ciliated peritoneum of meso­dermal origin.\n\n9. The coelom contains a well-developed, mostly coiled digestive tract.\n\nADVERTISEMENTS:\n\n10. A peculiar coelomic water vascular system (briefly called W.V.S.) or ambulacral system is present. Primi­tively the water vascular system prob­ably functioned in collecting and trans­porting food, but now it performs many functions such as feeding, locomotion and respiratory, etc.\n\n11. The nervous system is primitive and consists of radially arranged diffused nerve cords.\n\n12. There are no distinct respiratory and excretory systems in most of the cases.\n\n13. The blood vascular (haemal) system is present in all echinoderms. It becomes highly developed in Echinoids and Holothuroids.\n\nADVERTISEMENTS:\n\n14. Special sense organs are poorly devel­oped.\n\n15. The sexes are separate (mostly larger species) or hermaphrodites (smaller species).\n\n16. Coelomic gonads.\n\n17. Simple gonoducts.\n\n18. Fertilization is usually external.\n\n19. Cleavage is radial and indeterminate type of development.\n\nADVERTISEMENTS:\n\n20. The development of echinoderms in­volves a large number of bilaterally symmetrical, ciliated and free-swim­ming larval forms.\n\n4. Classification of Echinoderms:\n\nClassification in Outline:\n\nThe older classification is presented up, to sub-phylar rank on the mode of existence. So the known members of the phylum Echino­dermata is divided into two subphyla— Eleutherozoa (non-sessile type) and Pelmatozoa (sessile types) which were in vogue for a long.\n\nThe Eleutherozoa includes four classes—Asteroidea, Ophiuroidea, Echinoidea and Holothuroidea, and Pelmatozoa includes only single living class—Crinoidea.\n\nBut H. B. Fell (1948, 1965), the authority on echinoderm taxonomy of Harvard Univer­sity, USA, rejected the older classification as it was an artificial one because it was on the basis of mode of existence.\n\nHe proposed a classification on the basis of palaeontology and comparative morphology and divided into 4-subphyla which are based on more fundamental relationship providing four major patterns of body symmetry, related to the internal organs as well as the skeleton.\n\nADVERTISEMENTS:\n\nThe scheme of classification presented in this book (4th ed.), largely based on the classification plan outlined by Edward E. Ruppert and Robert D. Barnes (1994, 6th ed.).\n\n1. Subphylum Homalozoa:\n\ne.g., Enoploura.\n\n2.

Phylogenetic Considerations of Echinoderms:\n\nThe phylum Echinodermata exhibits va­riety of forms. They differ from one another by specialised features. Despite apparent diversities, they possess striking similarities in development and in their basic structural organisation.\n\nThey have many common features:\n\n1. The eggs are small and yolked.\n\n2. The cleavages are holoblastic and radial.\n\n3. Gastrulation involves invagination.\n\n4. The blastopore has posterior location.\n\n5. The coelom is developed as the outpockets from the archenteron (enterocoelic in origin).\n\n6. The larvae are free-swimming and have bilaterally symmetrical bodies.\n\n7. In all adult Echinoderms, adjacent to the epidermis there exists calcareous ossicles constituting the skeleton of the body. The disposition of the plates varies in different forms.\n\nThese common features suggest the idea that all Echinoderms have emerged out of a common ancestral stock where such struc­tures were present. It is also regarded that the ancestral forms with bilateral symmetry, are the forerunners of the group.\n\nAlthough fossils were quite abundant since Precambrian time, no tangible explanation can be obtained regarding the ancestry of Echinoderms from the palaeontological an­gle.\n\nThe presence of superficial radial sym­metry in adult Echinoderms leads to many confusing issues. Because of radial symme­try, some zoologists have tried to link them with the Coelenterates.\n\nBut the presence of bilateral larval forms and underlying bilat­eral symmetry in some adult Echinoderms suggest that they have arisen from bilater­ally symmetrical ancestor and the radial symmetry in adult is a secondary acquisi­tion (Fig. 21.33).\n\nWith all probabilities, some unknown Precambrian forms with bilateral symmetry are to be regarded as the ancestor of Echinoderms. Eocrinoids with stalk or stalk-less body, five ambulacra at the oral end and pentamerous symmetry give a superfi­cial resemblance to crinoids and forms a sort of ancestor of pentaradiate adult echinoderms.\n\nTwo exactly opposite views exist on this particular issue. According to the first concept the hypothetical ancestor is the Dipleurula larva but other school holds that the Pentactula larva is the ancestor.\n\nDipleurula concept:\n\nThe view that the Dipleurula larva was the hypothetical ancestral form of the Echinoderms was pro­pounded by Bather (1900).\n\nThis larval form has following features:\n\n1. Bilaterally symmetrical body with pre- oral lobe.\n\n2. Absence of skeletal formations.\n\n3. Ventrally placed mouth and anus.\n\n4. Presence of three paired sacs (axocoel, hydrocoel and somatocoel) with two water-pores.\n\nIt has been imagined by many workers that this larva holds the key of Echinoderm ancestry. But it was not possible to explain the derivation of some vital Echinoderm features, viz., the water vascular system and its development from the coelom.\n\nAccording to Bather, water vascular system originates as three ciliated grooves which become five by the subsequent subdivision of the two lateral grooves. The available interpretations on the origin of the water vascular system are not supported by embryological data. Embryological studies showed that the wa­ter vascular system arose as the outgrowths of the body wall in the form of tentacles.\n\nPentactula concept:\n\nThe pentactula con­cept of the Echinoderm ancestry has certain advantages over the dipleurula stage. This idea was first conceived by Semon (1888) and later developed by Burry (1895), Hyman (1955) and many others. According to them the Pentactula larva occupies the next evo­lutionary rank over the dipleurula larva.\n\nThe pentactula larva has five tentacles around the mouth and the hydrocoel becomes sepa­rated from the rest of the coelom to form the water vascular system. The recent inclina­tion is to hold the view that the Echinoderms have descended from a free-swimming com­mon ancestor, possibly the pentactula larva, and from the pentactula stage onwards the divergence has actually started.\n\nAs regards the inter-relationships be­tween the different groups of the phylum Echinodermata, it was suggested by early workers that the subphylum Eleutherozoa consisting of the sea-stars, sea-urchins, sea- cucumbers and brittle-stars has arisen from the subphylum Pelmatozoa which included the crinoids and others.\n\nEarly workers also suggested that the sea-stars and sea-cucumbers had many common features specially at the larval stages. Both of them were held to be related to crinoids more closely and they had possibly diverged very early from the Pelmatozoan ancestor.\n\nOn the other hand, ophiuroids and echinoids were regarded to be closely related with each other due to presence of striking similarities in between their larval forms and also due to the pres­ence of similar sterols (Bergmann, 1949) and creatine phosphate (Yudkin, 1950; Florkin, 1952) in both ophiuroids and echinoids.\n\nSuch similarities led early workers to establish a relationship between ophiuroids and echinoids and both were regarded to have diverged subsequently from the Pelmatozoan ancestor.\n\nEminent palaeontologists like, Bather, Marcus, Mortesen held that all the classes of the subphylum Eleutherozoa arose from Edrioasteroidea, an extinct group of Pelmatozoans, because of similar disposition of ambulacral pores, flexible theca, stalkless body and many other features. Shrock and Twenhofel suggested that only the holothurians and echinoids have evolved from Edrioasteroidea.\n\nBut recent workers, like Fell (1965) Nichols, 1969 and others, have totally dis­carded the views of all early workers and have reported two conflicting views.\n\nOn one-hand, some workers claimed that Ophiuroids and echinoids are closely re­lated due to striking similarities between ophiopluteus and echinopluteus larvae and that asteroids and holothurians are related due to the larval resemblance (see Fig. 21.33) are shown to be in total disagreement with the results obtained from morphological and palaeontological studies.\n\nNichols (1969) also reported that bio­chemical studies of pigments indicate ophiuroid—echinoid and asteroid— holothuroid relationship.\n\nRecent researches show that the larval relationship between ophiuroids and echinoids in one hand and between asteroids and holothuroids and that of the hemichordates on the other are due to con­vergent larval evolution.\n\nModern works advocate that the appar­ent dissimilarities between ophiuroids and asteroids are due to divergent larval evolu­tion. Fell showed that the echinoderms show convergent patterns of development among unrelated groups (Asterozoa, Echinozoa and Crinozoa) and divergent patterns of development among related groups (Ophiuroidea).\n\nIt is also indicated that both ophiuroids and asteroids are closely related to each other and they have certainly de­scended from common ancestors akin to the fossil Eocrinoida. The eocrinoids and crinoids again had a common ancestry. On the other hand Holothuroidea and Echinoidea had a common ancestry.\n\nThus modern researches suggest that the larval affinities cannot act as a guide in establishing the phylogenetic relationships between different classes of surviving echinoderms. Moreover, the superficial bio­chemical similarities between ophiuroids and echinoids may also be a result of physiologi­cal convergence for similar mode of living.\n\nThe origin of and inter-relationship be­tween different classes of echinoderms are shown in Fig. 21.34.\n\nOn the basis of morphology and palae­ontology early ophiuroids can establish the relationship with asteroids rather than echinoids by comparing the skeletal struc­ture. Again early asteroids can show some striking resemblances to crinoids rather than holothuroids on the basis of arm structure. So palaeontological and morphological evi­dence help to construct a classification based on adult animals rather than larval forms.\n\nAccording to Nichols (1969), crinoidea includes the oldest known members and therefore may be considered as the most primitive echinoderms. Asteroids and ophiuroids to be closely related groups on the basis of skeletal structure. Ophiuroids and echinoids may be related on the basis of lacking of open ambulacral groove.\n\n5. Research on Indian Echinoderms:\n\nProf. F. J. Bell (1887-1902) of the King’s College, London who was the first to report on the echinoderms of India along with the Edgar Thurston (1887-1894) of the Madras Museum. Bell (1887) reported 17 holothurian species from the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Koehler and Vaney (1908) reported 51 holothurian species from Andaman and Nicobar Islands.\n\nGravely (1941) listed 21 echinoderm species from the Madras (Chennai) beach. Kurian (1953) reported 4 species from Travancore coast. Chacko et al. (1956) published a list collected from Krusadai Island in the Gulf of Mannar. Grideon et al. (1957) mentioned a few echinoderms only up to genus level from the Gulf of Kutch. Sanne and Chhapgar (1962) listed 15 species from intertidal region of Bombay (Mumbai). Gopalkrishnan (1969) reported species of holothurians from the Gulf of Kutch.\n\nIn the midsixties some work on the reproductive physiology was initiated by Prof. S. Krishnaswamy, Krishnaswamy and Krishnan (1967), K. S. Rao (1965, 68) and Rahman (1966, 1968). Dr. S. Jones initiated work on the associations in general and echinoderms in particular. Jones listed over 100 species known from the Gulf of Mannar and Palk Bay.\n\nNagbhusnam and Rao (1969) listed 6 species from Orissa coast. James (1983) reported nearly 200 species of echinoderms from various places along the east and west coasts of India, the Andaman and Nicobar Islands and the various islands of Lakshadweep.\n\nSoota, Mukhopadhyay and Samanta (1983) listed 18 unnamed holothurian species of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands which were collected by them and some were deposited in the Zoological Survey of India.\n\nBadal Chandra Bharati Goswami (1992) recorded 5 speices from the Digha coast. In India, about 330 species have been recorded from the different coasts. Within this only 50 species have been recorded from the entire west coast. A. H. Clark (1912) reported about 75 crinoid species from the Indian region in his list of Indo-West Pacific species.\n\n6. Habit and Habitat of Echinoderms:\n\nEchinoderms are exclusively marine ani­mals. They inhabit all the seas and in all latitudes. They are usually absent in colder areas, excepting Crinoids which are not un­common in arctic and antarctic regions. Echinoderms are found from the intertidal zone to the depth of about 6,000 m.\n\nAlmost all the Echinoderms are benthonic and live in all types of sea bottoms. Asteroids crawl on the bottom and a few forms, belonging to the family Benthopectinidae, swim by the arms. The Holothurians remain adhered to the rocky bottoms and conceal themselves un­der rocks.\n\nSome Holothurians like Holothuria, Stichopus, Actinopyga, are adapted to the sandy bottom. Some of them remain partly or wholly buried in sandy or muddy bot­toms. Leptosynapta spends entire life being completely buried in soft bottoms and they move under the surface. Echinoids are also benthonic animals and keep the oral surface of the body in contact with the substratum.\n\nSome Echinoids are rock-borers and make bores like honey-combs in the rocky wall. The typical rock-boring Echinoids are Psammechinus miliaris and Paracentrotus livides. The Ophiuroids inhabit all sorts of sea-beds. They usually hide under rocks and sea­weeds. They remain attached to other objects by their flexible arms.\n\nThey exhibit various types of movement by the arms. Some Ophiuroids have the habit of burrowing in sand as seen in Amphiura chiajei. The crinoids are shallow-water inhabitants, except the stalked forms which occur mostly in deep sea ranging from 200-5000 m.\n\nMost of the Echinoderms are sluggish animals and move very slowly. They can either crawl on the surface or may swim in water by the arms. The ophiuroids are the most active forms amongst the Echinoderms. The Crinoids are more or less sedentaric animals.\n\nMost of the adult Crinoids are stalked and remain fastened to the bottom by aboral side of the body directly or through a stalk. The Jeep sea forms are generally stalked. A few Crinoids detach themselves from the stalk in adults and usually lead free and pelagic life.\n\nEchinoderms are gregarious animals and usually live in large groups. They are mostly nocturnal. They are bottom feeders and eat all sorts of food available in the sea bottoms. Most of them are carnivorous but several herbivorous forms are also known.\n\n7. Size of Echinoderms:\n\nThe sizes of Echinoderms are relatively moderate. The largest Asteroid known is Pycnopodia helianthoides which measures about 90 cm. The largest urchin living in the deep sea realms is Echinosoma hoplacantha whose shell is about 31 cm across.\n\nIn another ur­chin, Diadema, the spines are about 30 cm long. Synapta maculata, a Holothurian, has 16 cm long body with the diameter of about 6 cm. The stem of some fossilised Crinoids is about 2 m in length. As regards the small­est representatives of the group, it is seen that some fossil sand dollars measure only 2.5 cm.\n\n8. Shape and Symmetry of Echinoderms:\n\nThe phylum Echinodermata constitutes a very well-defined group. They exhibit dis­tinct radial symmetry in adults, excepting some Holothurians where the radial symme­try is not marked externally. The disposition of both internal and external structures also exhibits radial symmetry in Echinoderms which is an exception among the Coelomata.\n\nThe radial symmetry in adult organisation is acquired at the time of metamorphosis be­cause the larval stages of all Echinoderms have bilaterally symmetrical bodies. All the Echinoderms have a pentamerous body plan and have distinct oral and aboral surfaces. The terms ‘dorsal’ and ‘ventral’ are not ap­plied in Echinoderm organisation.\n\nThe mouth is centrally situated at the oral surface ex­cepting a few Echinoids, Holothurians and Actinometra (Crinoid) where the position of the mouth is slightly shifted from its original place. But the position of anus varies quite greatly (Fig. 21.35) and it is located excentrically. In some Echinoids and Crinoids, the anus is placed on the oral surface. The anus may be totally wanting in a few adult Asteroids and Ophiuroids.\n\nThe symmetry of the body has moulded all the organs of the body. Externally, the radial symmetry is exhibited by radii and inter-radii. The radii are marked by rows of tube-feet and the inter-radii are the portions of the body between the radii. But in some Holothurians, the tube-feet may spread over the inter-radii of the body.\n\nThe tube-feet are usually restricted to the oral surface (except­ing Holothurians and Echinoids where the tube-feet extend up to the aboral side to some extent) which is also called actinal or ambulacral surface. The other side (without tube-feet) is called abactinal or adambulacral surface.\n\nThe body is prolonged into arms in the direction of the radii in Asteroidea, Ophiuroidea and Crinoidea but in roundish Echinoids and sausage-shaped Holothurians, the aboral surfaces are inconspicuous due to the extension of the ambulacral surface.\n\nIn all the members of the subphyla Asterozoa amd Echinozoa, excepting the Holothurians, the mouth is directed down­wards. In Holothurians, the mouth is hori­zontally directed and they apply one side of the body to the ground. But in Crinoids, the mouth is directed upwards.\n\nPresence of tube-feet or podia is the characteristic feature of the phylum. In Asteroidea, Echinoidea and Holothuroidea, the tube-feet are provided with terminal suckers and they help in locomotion. In other forms, they are variously modificed to sub-serve other functions, like respiration, food-collection and tactile sensation.\n\n9. Body Wall and Skeleton of Echinoderms:\n\nThe epidermis is usually ciliated except in Holothuroids and Ophiuroids. The epi­dermis usually contains gland cells and sen­sory cells. The characteristic dermal ossicles vary quite greatly. They may remain scat­tered or may be firmly united so as to form an armour. Despite great diversities in form, they are possibly homologous in all Echinoderms.\n\nThe ossicles are formed as the deposition of calcareous substances in the connective tissue matrix. The dermal plates are spiny in most cases and the spines are mainly protective in function. They may also help in locomotion in some cases. In paxillosids and valvatid sea stars, the raised part of ossicles of the aboral surface is crowned with movable short spines, called paxilla help in burrowing.\n\nThe spines and other processes derived from them are movably placed. In Asteroids and Echinoids, some of the spines become specialised into pedicellariae. The detailed structure of the pedicellariae has been described in the ex­ample part of the phylum. These are nothing but two or three spines arranged as pincers.\n\nThe pedicellariae are primarily protective in function. The dermal plates are quite distinct in some Echinoderms; in others they are not clearly understandable. However, the plates are broadly distinguishable into oral and aboral plates. The oral plates are five in number and are inter-radially placed. They can be easily distinguished in the Crinoids and Ophiuroids.\n\nThe aboral plates are quite distinguishable in early developmental stages (Fig. 21.36). The aboral plates, in typical cases, consist of a central plate which is surrounded by five radially disposed infrabasals and five interradially placed basals.\n\nBeyond the circle, five radially ar­ranged radials are placed. Both the oral and aboral plates are absent in Holothurians. The infrabasals as well as the radials are lacking in Echinoids. Other details regarding the skeletal system are dealt under the different examples of the phylum.\n\n10. Digestive System of Echinoderms:\n\nThe alimentary canal in Echinoderms shows great variation in different groups. The alimentary canal becomes coiled in most forms. In Ophiuroidea and Asteroidea the alimentary canal is axial. The position of the mouth and anus varies greatly in different classes. The anus is usually excentrically placed excepting Holothurians.\n\nIn Crinoids, the mouth and anus are situated on the same side of the body. The anus is lacking in Ophiuroids and in a few adult Asteroids. The alimentary canal bears various diver­ticula, such as siphon in Echinoids, respira­tory trees in Holothurians, cardiac and py­loric caeca in most Asteroids and intestinal diverticula in Crinoids. Lack of separate glandular appendages is the most remark­able feature in Echinoderm anatomy.\n\n11. Coelom of Echinoderms:\n\nThe coelom in the adult Echinoderms is represented as several distinct spaces. It develops from a diverticulum of the embry­onic enteron. The diverticulum subsequently becomes separated from the enteron and forms a number of sacs—the hydrocoel and the splanchnocoel.\n\nThe water vascular sys­tem arises from the hydrocoel, and the splanchnocoel transforms into several sys­tems of spaces:\n\n(1) The body cavity proper or the peri­visceral cavity develops from the right and left posterior coelom in the larva. It has no connection with the exterior except in Crinoids where the water-pores open into it.\n\n(2) The axial sinus varies greatly in devel­opment. It usually develops from the ante­rior larval coelom. The stone canal opens into it and communicates with the exterior through water-pores or with the coelom as in most Holothurians.\n\n(3) The sinus system or the perihaemal spaces. This part develops as out-pushing of the posterior and anterior larval coeloms. This part of the coelom forms a covering of the haemal channels. It consists of a circumoral space and five radially placed tubes. This system is not present in Crinoids. The aboral circular sinus is also included in this system.\n\nThe coelomic spaces have an epithelial lining which is ciliated in most places. It contains albuminous fluid with floating amoebocytes which are phagocytic in func­tion. Several types of amoebocytes of differ­ent sizes and appearances have been distin­guished.\n\nAnother type of corpuscle with vibratile tail is also recorded in the coelomic fluid. They are designated as vibratile cor­puscles. They set forth a constant circulatory movement of the coelomic fluid. In Holothurians, a good number of flattened nucleated cells containing haemoglobin are present.\n\n12. Haemal System or Blood Lacunar System of Echinoderms:\n\nThe existence of blood vascular system in Echinoderm cannot be definitely stated. The haemal system in echinoderm plays the role of blood vessels. But the fluid contained in this system does not show any circulatory movement. This system comprises a peculiar connective tissue of doubtful nature.\n\nThe haemal system is present in all the Echino­derms and is welldeveloped in Asteroidea and Ophiuroidea. The haemal system is greatly reduced in Crinoidea. The haemal system is almost same in all the classes of Echinoderm excepting a few minor modifica­tions regarding positional changes of the madreporite.\n\nIn Echinoderms, the haemal sys­tem consists of an oral ring with five radial canals which terminate blindly at the aboral end. The oral ring gives off a gastro-intestinal system which becomes quite complicated in most of the cases. Conspicuous development of the gastro-intestinal system suggests that its primary function is nourishment.\n\n13. Excretory System of Echinoderms:\n\nThe process of excretion in Echinoderms in not fully known. There is no specialised organ in Echinoderm which can be assigned to be excretory in function. With all prob­abilities, some organs associated with the water vascular system or with the axial sinus are responsible for the elimination of the nitrogenous waste products.\n\n14. Nervous System of Echinoderms:\n\nThe nervous system is modified in differ­ent classes of Echinoderm.\n\nThis system con­sists of:\n\n(1) Ventral nervous system;\n\n(2) Deep oral nervous system and\n\n(3) Apical nervous system.\n\nThe central nervous system is well-developed in different classes of Echinoderms. This system is placed superfi­cially and consists of diffused sub-epithelial nerve plexus which becomes concentrated in the different parts of the body. It is sensory in nature and supplies nerves to the integu­ment, tube-feet and gut.\n\nThe ectodermal part of the plexus is called ectoneural and the endodermal part is designated as endoneural. The ectoneural plexus becomes concentrated around the mouth as the circumoral nerve ring which in turn gives radial nerves along the radii. In Echinoidea, Ophiuroidea and Holothuroidea, the circumoral nerve ring and radial nerves are placed in the wall of the epineural canal.\n\nThe ectoneural plexus prolongs into the tube-feet, spines and pedicellariae. The endoneural plexus is well formed in Asteroidea and forms perioesophageal nerve ring around the mouth opening. The deep oral nervous system consists of two nerve cords (Lange’s cords) in each radius. These two nerve cords lie in the ectoneural system and are separated from the radial nerve by connective tissue layer.\n\nThey are mesodermal derivatives and motor in nature. The apical nervous system consists of a cord situated in the mid-dorsal line of the body. It develops from the dorsal perito­neum. This system is best developed in Crinoidea and is altogether absent in Holothuroidea. It is exclusively motor in nature and mesodermal in origin.\n\nThe sense organs are mainly the tactile organs. The tube-feet are exclusively sensory in function in majority of the Echinoderms. The terminal tentacles are sensory units in starfishes. They are tactile organs situated one at the tip of each arm. This spines are also highly sensitive.\n\nThe pigmented spots situated at the tip of the arms of Asteroidea are probably photosensitive. The shining spots on the skin of an Echinoid, Diadema, are also assigned to be visual in function. The otocysts of Holothuroidea and Sphaeridea (modified spines) of Echinoidea are the or­gans of special sense. Besides these struc­tures, numerous neurosensory cells are scat­tered all over the body which are either tactile organs or chemoreceptors.\n\n15. Reproductive System of Echinoderms:\n\nSexual reproductions:\n\nIn Echinoderms, the sexes are separate except a few hermaphroditic forms, such as Asterina gibbosa, Cucumaria frondosa and Amphiura squamata. The reproductive organs in Echinoderms are quite peculiar in nature. MacBride has shown that the reproductive organs are composed of cells derived from coelomic epithelium.\n\nThe reproductive or­gans are connected with a cellular cord, called genital rachis. Existence of the genital rachis in Holothuroidea is questionable. A cord having germ cells passing along the genital duct towards the body wall is com­parable to the genital rachis of others.\n\nThe reproductive organs consist of tufts of branched, paired and inter-radially dis­posed bodies. They open directly on the sur­face. In Crinoidea, the reproductive organs are contained in pinnules which are devoid of an opening to the exterior. The mode of discharge of genital products in this case is not known.\n\nIn Asteroidea, Ophiuroidea and Echinoidea, the gonads are oriented pentamerously in the inter-radii. In Asteroidea, there are five pairs of gonads which open usually on the aboral surface. In a few genera under the class Asteroidea, the gonads are numerous in number.\n\nIn Holothuroidea there is only one branched gonad which may be imperfectly divided into two. But the single duct from the gonad opens to the exterior on the surface near the mouth. The reproductive cells, when ripe, are discharged directly into the sea.\n\nAsexual reproduction:\n\nAsexual reproductive by fission is ob­served in many Echinoderms, especially in Asteroidea; Ophiuroidea and Holothuroidea, In Asteroidea and Ophiuroidea, a line of fission passes through the central disc, while in Holothuroidea it passes transversely along the axis of the body.\n\nSpontaneous reproduc­tion by fission is reported in Asteriid genera (Coscinasterias, Sclerasterias, Stephanasterias, Linckia and Allostichaster). Crozier (1920) found that in the first animal asexual repro­duction is confined to summer months and normal gametic reproduction occurs in win­ter months.\n\n16. Regeneration in Echinoderms:\n\nThe echinoderms are endowed with re­markable power of regeneration of their lost parts by autotomy (self-mutilation). The power of regeneration is relatively poor in Echinoi­dea, but in Asteroidea and Ophiuroidea, it is quite extensive.\n\nRegeneration of whole body from a single arm is recorded in starfishes. If arms or a portion of the central disc is extir­pated or lost mechanically they can regenerate the lost portions. In Crinoidea and Holothuroidea the power of regeneration is so profound that the internal organs or portions of them are capable of being regenerated.\n\n17. Development of Echinoderms:\n\nIn all Echinoderms, the eggs are fertilized in sea water. Almost all the echinoderms pass through characteristic free-swimming and bilaterally symmetrical larval stages (Fig. 21.39).\n\nIn Asterina gibbosa, free-swimming larva is absent as the development occurs in the brood of the mother. In a few holothurians, development occurs in the coelom and in the genital tubes in Chiridota contorta. Development in Stichaster nutrix takes place in the stomach of the mother.\n\nThe Echinoderms, where free-swimming larval forms are present, have small eggs. But in forms where development occurs in brood or body cavity or in stomach, the eggs are relatively large in size owing to greater quantity of yolk. The fertilized eggs undergo total cleavage (holoblastic) and a large number of cells (blastomeres) are produced. These cells arrange themselves so as to form a hollow one-layered blastula.\n\nThe blastula by invagination at its one pole transforms into a gastrula. The invaginating cells form the endoderm and the outer layer becomes the ectoderm. The archenteron communi­cates posteriorly with the exterior through the blastopore. Mesenchymal networks in the form of nucleated protoplasmic processes are formed between the ectoderm and endo­derm.\n\nThese networks give rise to muscles, connective tissues and calcareous ossicles. The archenteron acquires a new opening to the exterior at the anteroventral side, called larval mouth. As development progresses, the anus is shifted ventrally and the cilia present all over the body become localised into definite bands. The disposition of the ciliated bands differs in different larval forms.\n\nFate of larval mouth and anus:\n\nThe fate of the larval mouth and anus varies quite greatly among the different classes of the Echinodermata. In Asteroidea and Echinoidea, both of these closes and the adult mouth and anus are formed anew. In Holothuroidea, both of these persist in adults. In Ophiuroidea, anus is lacking in adults but the larval mouth persists. In Crinoidea, both larval mouth and anus are absent.\n\n18. Affinities of Echinoderms:\n\nThe echinoderms, especially their larval forms, attract the attention of many Zoolo­gists due to the presence of many striking similarities between themselves and between different other groups of animals.\n\nRelationship with Annelida:\n\nA number of early workers have estab­lished affinities between the trochophore larva of annelids and some echinoderm lar­vae on the basis of the presence of similar ciliated bands and some other superficial similarities.\n\nBut these affinities are not based on any scientific ground because cleavage pattern is spiral in annelida but radial in echinoderms; coelom formation is schizocoelic in annelids but enterocoelous in echinoderms.\n\nRelationship with Brachiopoda:\n\nSome superficial similarities are also noted in between the early developmental stages of Brachiopoda and Echinodermata.\n\nThe similarities are:\n\n1. Cleavage is holoblastic,\n\n2. Blastula is a coeloblastula,\n\n3. The coelom is enterocoelous in the members of the class Articulata of phylum Brachiopoda,\n\n4. The members of class Articulata have free-swimming larval stage. However, these affinities are only superficial.\n\nRelationship with Chordata:\n\nThe most convincing affinities are noted between the echinoderms and the chordates. Hence many workers regarded the echinoderms to be the nearest group to the chordates. However, modern workers do not support the contention and they hold that the echinoderms and the chordates diverged separately from a common basic ancestor.\n\nThe affinities are discussed below:\n\n1. Mesodermal skeletal substance is present in both.\n\n2. Presence of infra-epidermal nervous system in hemichordata.\n\n3. The perforations on the calyx of carpoid echinoderms are compared with pha­ryngeal gill-slits of Amphioxus.\n\n4. Needham (1932) has tried to show a relationship between these two groups by analysing biochemical evidences. Invertebrates have the phosphogen in the form of arginine phosphate whereas chordates usually have creatine phos­phate. But the echinoids among echinodermata and hemichor-dates among Chordata have both arginine phosphate and creatine phosphate.\n\n5. Wilhelmi (1942) has shown similari­ties between the two groups by sero­logical tests as well.\n\n6. Cleavage is radial, holoblastic.\n\n7. Blastopore changes into anus.\n\n8. Enterocoelous mode of coelom forma­tion.\n\n9. The similarities between adult echinoderms and chordates are very few, but the affinities between the lar­val forms are highly notable.\n\nMetschnikoff (1869) tried to show the following affinities between the torn aria larva of Balanoglossus and the bipinnaria and auricularia larvae of the echinoderms:\n\n1. free-swimming and bilateral symmetrical larvae in both,\n\n2. transparent body with similar ciliated bands,\n\n3. enterocoelous coelom with similar disposition,\n\n4. similar lo­cation of mouth and anus,\n\n5. the madreporic vesicles in bipinnaria are thought to be homologous with heart vesicle of Balanoglossus.\n\nSignificance of echinoderm larvae:\n\nBather (1900) claimed common ancestry of hemichordates and echinoderms from the dipleurula larva. The genealogical tree given in 1957 by Anderson and Guthrie and the phylogenetic tree given in 1948 by L. H. Hyman in collaboration with Prof. YV. K. Fischer who also supports the same idea, (vide the phylogenetic trees (Figs. 21.40 and 21.41).\n\nMuller and Bateson again claimed that the tornaria larva and dipleurula larva had evolved form a common ancestral source.\n\nDe Beer and Garstang hold that the tornaria larva, the dipleurula and pluteus larvae are living relics from a very remote period when the echinoderms and chordates were not diverged.\n\nThe neotenous theory propounded by Garstang in 1894, 1928 holds that the chor­dates arose from some neotenous form of auricularia larvae. The sequence is—Auricu­laria larva (Echinodermata) → Tornaria larva (Hemichordata) → Tadpole (Ascidia) → Neoteny → Free swimming Chordates.\n\nThe adoral ciliated band of auricularia presum­ably functions to convey food particles in the oral aperture, and for this it has been con­verted to the floor of the pharyngeal cavity. Garstang suggests that endostyle was de­rived from this loop of the adoral band of the auricularia larva.\n\nAn atrium was developed in course of time to protect the gills. The fish­like swimming larva of tunicates is held by him to be formed from the development of muscles along the sides of the elongated body.\n\nThe ciliary bands were then pushed upwards and subsequently rolled up with the underlying nerve plexus to form the neural tube. Fig. 21.42 shows Garstang’s idea of derivation of the protochordate from echinoderm larva.\n\nMost of the modern workers like Berrill (1955), Bone (1979) have supported the main theory of Garstang but deny the origin of todpole. The tornaria larva of Hemichordate is much more similar to the larvae of echinoderms but differs in its mode of origin and its structure. Young (1981) supported the neotenous larval theory of Garstang.\n\nTherefore, from the above discussion it may be concluded that the phylogenetic relationship between echinoderms, hemichordates and chordates is more con­vincing, and chordates may have evolved from non-chordates, probably the echino­derms.\n\nBut Fell (1963), Pawson and others deny the ancestry of chordates from any form of echinoderms arid they also deny the rela­tionship between the tornaria larva and the echinoderm larvae. Many counter-arguments have been put forward by them.\n\n1. Protocoel is unpaired in Balanoglossus, but paired in echinoderms.\n\n2. Extant echinoderms lack pharyngeal gill-slits.\n\n3. Bipinnaria larva lacks telotroch.\n\n4. The tornaria larva has a characteristic apical plate with eye-spots.\n\nFell and many others hold that the affini­ties between tornaria and echinoderm larvae are not based on any phylogenetic relationship but are merely due to larval convergence for similar mode of life.\n\nIn Fell’s own words “It therefore follows that within the phylum (Echinodermata), larval similarities do not indicate taxonomic af­finities. Extrapolating beyond the phylum, so as to deduce taxonomic affinities on the basis of resemblance between auricularia and tornaria is, therefore, inadmissible. The unreliability of larval structure in the echinoderms as a guide to phylogenetic af­finity is further illustrated by the occurrence of divergent patterns of development within related groups (e.g., Asterozoa, Echinozoa, Crinozoa).”\n\nThe presence of similar biochemical sub­stances may not necessarily speak of any phylogenetic relationship and may be due to convergence for similar modes of physiologi­cal activities. Moreover, creatine phosphate has been found to occur also in other animals phylogenetically remote from the chordates, such as in sponges (Robin, 1954/ and in many polychaetes (Hobson and Recs 1955).\n\nThe study of larval forms and adults of echinoderms reflects a case of retrogressive metamorphosis because the adult echinoderms possess many primitive fea­tures than the larval forms.\n\nThe features of adults are comparable with lower inverte­brates (e.g., Cnidaria), such as radial symme­try, lacking of distinct head, absence of anterior and posterior sides, etc. and the ad­vanced larvae of echinoderms metamorphose into primitive adults. Hence it is an example of retrogressive metamorphosis.\n\nViews regarding the larval phylogeny:\n\nMacBride (1914):\n\nDipleurula larva was of fixed type and gave rise to the free-swimming forms of Antedon or Yolk larva.\n\nHyman’s synthetic view (1955):\n\nDipleurula was remotely related non- echinoderm forms for their bilateral symme­try and went through a sessile stage of radial forms to reach the echinoderm status. This radial form Pentactula stage where reorgani­sation took place and gave rise to free- swimming and attached forms parallely (Fig. 21.43).\n\nH. B. Fell (1963):\n\nSupports free-swimming origin of echinoderm larvae and their phylogenetic correlation through Vitellaria.\n\nParker and Haswell (1972):\n\nDipleurula larva was free-swimming, gave rise to the free-swimming forms through the free-swimming Antedon on one hand and to the fixed type through the fixed Antedon forms, on the other.\n\nBarrington has summarised the work of other workers like Berrill (1955), Bone (1960), Carter (1957), Marcus (1958) and Whitear (1957) and has proposed that the echinoderms, the pogonophores, the hemichordates and the rest of the chordates arose separately but directly from a common bilaterally symmetrical sessile or semi-ses­sile ancestor with tripartite body and coe­lom, ciliated larval stage and ciliary mode of feeding from external source (Fig. 21.44)."
