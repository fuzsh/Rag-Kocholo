        "text": "Historical review\n\nCrinoidea: Six references documented the Crinoidea from the CMP; one during the 19th, one in the 20th, and four in the 21st century. Among the Echinodermata, Crinoidea represents the less studied class of the CMP. The study of the Crinoidea from the CMP began in 1895 when Hartlaub (1895) recorded the species Florometra tanneri (as Antedon rhomboidea) for MAR at 1 236 m depth. Several years later, using a submersible, Roux (2004) collected one specimen of Hyocrinus foelli in COL at 3 030 m depth. Finally, during deep-water dredging by the TALUD cruises aboard the R/V âEl Pumaâ of the Universidad Nacional AutÃ³noma de MÃ©xico, Florometra serratissima was collected in two stations located in COL between 1 040 and 1 106 m depth (ValdÃ©s de Anda et al., 2018).\n\nAsteroidea: 57 references addressed the Asteroidea distributed along the CMP. During the 19th century only two works were published, meanwhile the 20th and 21st centuries presented similar numbers of works, 28 and 27, respectively. The 19th century represents the era with the lowest addition of Asteroidea. The first reported Asteroidea for the CMP were Luidia columbia and Astropecten regalis, both collected in San Blas, NAY (Gray, 1840).\n\nThe 20th century was the period with the highest addition of Asteroidea to the CMP (25 species). Ludwig (1905) described Ampheraster marianus, Henricia gracilis, and Sarkaster validus (= Lophaster furcilliger) for MAR and other areas of the Eastern Pacific. According to samples from the Albatross, Fisher (1911) recorded Hippasteria lepidonotus and Henricia clarki for deep-waters from MAR and REV, respectively. Clark (1916) provided the original descriptions of Saraster insignis (= Nearchaster (Nearchaster) aciculosus) and Cyllaster seminuda (= Henricia seminudus) from Clarion Island, REV. In 1936, the Templeton Crocker Expedition collected echinoderms during the expedition of the Zaca along the north of MÃ©xico and as a result, Ziesenhenne (1937) mentioned Astropecten armatus, Acanthaster ellisii (= Acanthaster planci), Linckia columbiae, Pauliella aenigma (= Paulia horrida), and Sclerasterias heteropaes for shallow-waters (up to 100 m depth) from Clarion Island. During 1937-1938, the Zaca continued performing collections of shallow-water echinoderms, and Clark (1940) reported Luidia bellonae (Manzanillo, COL and Chamela Bay, JAL), Luidia foliolata, Pharia pyramidata, and Phataria unifascialis (Tenacatita Bay, JAL). Later, Caso (1943) reported the species Heliaster microbrachius and Luidia superba for Manzanillo, COL, as well as Nidorellia armata for the same locality and MAR. In later years, the addition of species for the CMP was sporadic, with mentions of just one species per work: Patiria miniata (Socorro Island, REV; Adem et al., 1960), Astropecten californicus (Manzanillo, COL; Caso, 1961), Mithrodia bradleyi (REV; Caso, 1962b), Pentaceraster cumingi (Socorro and Clarion Islands, REV; Hertlein, 1963), and Asteropsis carinifera (REV; Maluf, 1991).\n\nDuring the 21st century, only eight new records for the CMP have been documented. Fuentes-FarÃ­as et al. (2005) provided a list of echinoderms for MICH including the new records of Luidia tessellata and Heliaster helianthus. Two years later, the Mexican government decreed the MAR as a Biosphere Reserve, publishing a management and conservation program (CONANP, 2007a), which provided lists of the marine and terrestrial flora and fauna, and included the record of Echinaster (Othilia) tenuispina for the area. Honey-EscandÃ³n et al. (2008) and SolÃ­s-MarÃ­n et al. (2013b) provided the most-complete checklist of echinoderms for the Mexican Pacific and the Eastern Pacific, respectively, including the new records of Heliaster polybrachius (JAL), Mediaster transfuga and Meridiastra modesta (REV), and Narcissia gracilis (NAY). Recently, Nava-Bravo et al. (2019) included the record of Astropecten verrilli for MICH.\n\nOphiuroidea: 59 references have been published regarding this class. The 19th century was the least productive since only one work was published. During the 20th and 21st centuries, similar numbers of manuscripts were published, 30 and 28, respectively. In 1891, the Albatross conducted an expedition along the Eastern Pacific, and as a result, LÃ¼tken and Mortensen (1899) described the first species and subspecies of ophiuroids from deep-waters of the CMP (MAR): Amphiura serpentina, Astrodia excavata, Dougaloplus notacanthus, Ophiacantha costata, Ophiacantha hirta, Ophiacantha moniliformis, Ophiernus adspersus annectens, Ophiomitra granifera, Ophiomitra partita, Ophiosphalma variabile, and Ophiura (Ophiura) scutellata.\n\nDuring the 20th century a total of 30 species were added to the list of ophiuroids of the CMP, representing the highest number, in comparison to the other two centuries accounted for in this review. DÃ¶derlein (1911) conducted a revision of the worldâs Euryalida, reporting Asteroschema sublaeve for MAR. With specimens collected in shallow-waters of Clarion Island, Ziesenhenne (1937) described Ophiacantha pyriformis, and reported for the first time in the CMP, the presence of Ophiactis savignyi, Ophiocoma aethiops, Ophioderma variegatum, Ophionereis annulata, and Ophiothrix galapagensis. Later, Clark (1940) found the conspicuous Diopederma daniana, Ophiolepis variegata, and Ophiothrix (Ophiothrix) spiculata in JAL and COL. In the same year, Ziesenhenne (1940) published the results obtained by the cruise Velero III performed in 1938, and described Amphichondrius laevis, Amphiodia sculptilis, Ophiolepis plateia, and Ophiophragmus lonchophorus, all of them collected in Tenacatita Bay, JAL. Later, the additions of new records of ophiuroids per work were reduced: Ophiocomella alexandri (REV; Steinbeck & Ricketts, 1941), Ophioderma teres and Ophiolepis pacifica (Puerto Vallarta, JAL; Caso, 1951), Ophioderma panamense (REV; Ziesenhenne, 1955), Ophiomyxa panamensis (REV; Hertlein, 1963), Ophiostigma tenue (ISA; Clark, 1970), Ophiomusa lymani, Ophiothela mirabilis, and Ophiuroglypha irrorata irrorata (JAL and REV; Luke, 1982), Amphichondrius unamexici (= Amphichondrius granulatus; NAY; Caso, 1983a), Amphiura seminuda and Ophiophragmus marginatus (JAL and NAY; Caso, 1986b), Amphiura (Amphiura) assimilis and Gymnophiura mollis (MAR; Maluf, 1988), Ophiactis simplex (REV; Maluf, 1991), and Ophiuroconis bispinosa (REV; Hendler, 1996).\n\nThe addition of new records of ophiuroids (22) during the 21st century has been important. Frontana-Uribe et al. (2000) collected specimens of Ophiocomella schmitti associated with coral rubble in localities from Socorro Island (REV). Fuentes-FarÃ­as et al. (2005) included the record of Ophiothrix (Ophiothrix) rudis for MICH; in the same year, Maluf and Brusca (2005) published a checklist of the echinoderms from the Gulf of California, including the general distribution of the species, and the new records of Amphipholis elevata, Astrocaneum spinosum, Microphiopholis puntarenae, Ophiocomella sexradia, Ophiocnida hispida, Ophiolepis crassa, Ophiopholis bakeri, and Ophiophthalmus diplasia (MAR and REV). The genus Ophiophthalmus is an invalid junior synonym and a new assignment is needed (Hendler, 1996), but in the present work we kept this temporary genus in order to avoid systematic confusions. Later, Honey-EscandÃ³n et al. (2008) reported 33 species of ophiuroids for the CMP, of which, the amphiurids Amphiodia occidentalis, Amphiodia platyspina, Amphiodia violacea, Amphiodia (Amphispina) digitata, Amphiodia (Amphispina) urtica, Amphipholis pugetana, and Microphiopholis platydisca, represented new records in several states and islands from the CMP. In 2011, Astrodictyum panamense (Ayala-Bocos, Reyes-Bonilla, Herrero-PÃ©rezrul, Walther-Mendoza, & CastaÃ±eda-FernÃ¡ndez de Lara, 2011) and Hemipholis gracilis (Hendler, 2011) were reported in REV and JAL, respectively. GarcÃ­a-HernÃ¡ndez et al. (2014) compared the ecological diversity and species composition of benthic macroinvertebrates in rocky reefs of JAL and MAT, finding new records for Amphipholis squamata and Ophionereis perplexa. Finally, Granja-FernÃ¡ndez et al. (2017) provided a checklist of ophiuroids from the CMP, adding the new record of Ophiophragmus papillatus.\n\nEchinoidea: 73 references documented the presence of the Echinoidea from the CMP, representing the major number of works among all the classes. The 19th century is represented only by two publications, the 20th century for 39, and the 21st century for 32 works. In the 19th century all the work regarding Echinoidea was published by Alexander Agassiz whom documented for the first time in the CMP the species Eucidaris thouarsii and Echinometra vanbrunti, both collected in Manzanillo, COL (Agassiz, 1872), and who described Brisaster townsendi and Plexechinus cinctus for stations located in deep-waters of MAR (Agassiz, 1898).\n\nThe 20th century was by far the most productive in terms of new addition of echinoids (27) in the CMP. Clark described Hesperocidaris perplexa and Echinometra insularis (Clark, 1907; Clark, 1912), and reported Echinometra oblonga and Tripneustes gratilla from REV (Clark, 1912). With specimens collected by the Zaca, Ziesenhenne (1937) reported Clypeaster europacificus, Diadema mexicanum, and Tripneustes depressus in shallow-waters of Socorro and Clarion, REV. In 1938, was published an important work regarding fossil and living Echinoidea from the west American Cenozoic, in which were mentioned the new records of Astropyga pulvinata (JAL) and Toxopneustes roseus (ISA) (Grant & Hertlein, 1938). Posteriorly, Clark (1940) added Clypeaster ochrus and Clypeaster speciosus from ISA and NAY, respectively, and Caso (1948a) included Arbacia stellata to NAY. Clark (1948) reported the highest number of new records of echinoids for the CMP (Brissopsis pacifica, Clypeaster rotundus, Encope micropora, Encope micropora insularis, Lovenia cordiformis, Meoma ventricosa grandis, and Rhyncholampas pacificus), based on the collections of the Velero III along the Eastern Pacific during the years 1931-1941; E. micropora insularis was described in this work and its holotype corresponds to Socorro Island, REV. The records in posterior works were sporadic: Hesperocidaris asteriscus (JAL and REV; Caso, 1961), Heterocentrotus mamillatus (REV; Chan, 1974), Dendraster excentricus and Lanthonia longifissa (ISA and COL, respectively; Caso, 1980), Agassizia scrobiculata (NAY; Caso, 1983b), and Mellita notabilis (MICH; Harold & Telford, 1990).\n\nDespite the number of published works during the 21st century is similar to the previous century, only three new records for the area have been documented during the present era. These records correspond to species observed during field work and documented in the management and conservation programs of the National Park ISA (Centrostephanus coronatus; CONANP, 2005) and the Reserve of the Biosphere MAR (Brissus obesus; CONANP, 2007a). Finally, RÃ­os-Jara et al. (2008a) performed collections of echinoderms in ISA at different depths finding Brissus latecarinatus in shallow-waters (< 20 m depth).\n\nHolothuroidea: 53 references mention holothuroids from the CMP. During the 19th century only one work was published, 19 during the 20th century, and 33 during the 21st century. In the 19th century only one work was published and therefore, the number of records was low. Despite, Laetmophasma fecundum (= Pannychia moseleyi), Psolus pauper, and Ypsilothuria bitentaculata were first mentioned in Ludwig (1893), it was until 1864 when Ludwig (1894) provided an extended description of the species, reporting them in deep waters from MAR; moreover, Molpadia musculus was recorded in this work too, for the same locality.\n\nThe 20th century was the most productive in terms of the addition of new records (28). In 1926, the Templeton Crocker expedition aboard the Zaca performed dredges in order to obtain echinoderms along the Eastern Pacific, and collected Holothuria (Cystipus) inhabilis and Holothuria (Platyperona) difficilis in REV (Deichmann, 1937). From 1932 to 1938, the Allan Hancock Expedition aboard the Velero III collected several specimens of holothuroids and Deichmann (1941) found that Thyone bidentata and Thyone parafusus, both discovered in Tenacatita, JAL corresponded to new species, and that Leptopentacta panamica, Neothyone gibber, and Pentamera chierchiae were new records of species for the CMP (JAL and REV). Caso (1954) collected for the first time Holothuria (Selenkothuria) lubrica in Puerto Vallarta, JAL and found a similar species which was designated as a new species: Holothuria (Selenkothuria) portovallartensis. The biggest contribution of new records of holothuroids for the CMP (Holothuria (Halodeima) kefersteinii, Holothuria (Lessonothuria) pardalis, Holothuria (Mertensiothuria) hilla, Holothuria (Mertensiothuria) leucospilota, Holothuria (Semperothuria) imitans, Holothuria (Semperothuria) languens, Holothuria (Theelothuria) paraprinceps, Holothuria (Thymiosycia) arenicola, Holothuria (Thymiosycia) impatiens, and Isostichopus fuscus) was made by Deichmann (1958) which correspond to a continuation and expansion of the material collected by the Velero III and IV in JAL, as well as in ISA, MAR and REV. The new records per work during the rest of this century were reduced: Holothuria (Halodeima) inornata (Caso, 1961), Leptosynapta albicans (Caso, 1962b), Abyssocucumis abyssorum (Luke, 1982), Holothuria (Stauropora) fuscocinerea (Hickman, 1998), all of them collected in REV and NAY. Nepote-GonzÃ¡lez (1998) conducted a research about the diversity of holothuroids of MAT, finding the new records of Chiridota rigida, Holothuria (Cystipus) rigida, Labidodemas americanum, and Pseudocnus californicus. Later, SolÃ­s-MarÃ­n and Laguarda-Figueras (1999) performed collections in several localities of the CMP (COL, NAY, MAT) and described a new species, Cucumaria flamma.\n\nThe addition of new records of holothuroids to the CMP has been important during the 21st century. As part of the first program of management and conservation of REV National Park, CONANP (2004) documented Euapta godeffroyi. Fuentes-FarÃ­as et al. (2005) and Honey-EscandÃ³n et al. (2008) provided one of the most complete checklists of echinoderms in MÃ©xico and added the records of Neothyone gibbosa and Labidodemas maccullochi for MICH, and Euthyonidiella zacae, Holothuria (Halodeima) atra, Holothuria (Mertensiothuria) viridiaurantia (= Holothuria (Mertensiothuria) hilla), Lissothuria ornata, Neocucumis veleronis, and Trachythyone peruana for several areas of the Mexican Pacific. Holothuria (Mertensiothuria) viridiaurantia is a recently described species which was previously assigned to H. (Mertensiothuria) hilla (Borrero-PÃ©rez & Vanegas-GonzÃ¡lez, 2019). According to a preliminary revision of the material (unpublished data) and to Borrero-PÃ©rez and Vanegas-GonzÃ¡lez (2019), in the CMP, H. (Mertensiothuria) viridiaurantia inhabits in NAY, JAL, MICH and MAT. On the other hand, based on a taxonomical review of the material, we confirm that H. (Mertensiothuria) hilla inhabits in REV, but a taxonomic confirmation of the material from ISA and MAR is required (F.A. SolÃ­s-MarÃ­n, personal communication, 01 April 2020). Honey-EscandÃ³n et al. (2011) described Holothuria (Selenkothuria) carere, collected in shallow-waters of MICH and other states of the Mexican Pacific. Santos-BeltrÃ¡n and Salazar-Silva (2011) provided images and an identification key of the holothuroids from BahÃ­a de Banderas, NAY adding the record of Afrocucumis ovulum. RÃ­os-Jara et al. (2013) described the taxonomic composition of the echinoderms from shallow-waters in several localities of BahÃ­a Chamela, JAL, adding Neopentamera anexigua, Pachythyone lugubris, and Pachythyone pseudolugubris to the CMP, and SolÃ­s-MarÃ­n, Arriaga-Ochoa, GalvÃ¡n-Villa, and Laguarda-Figueras (2018) described Lissothuria imbricata after the collection of material from the same area. In recent years, Nava-Bravo et al. (2019) elaborated the most complete checklist of echinoderms from MICH adding the records of Chiridota aponocrita, Epitomapta tabogae, and Thyonella mexicana.\n\nChecklist: The present updated checklist includes 187 species of Echinodermata (three Crinoidea, 35 Asteroidea, 67 Ophiuroidea, 32 Echinoidea, and 50 Holothuroidea; Table 1) resulted from the revision of 137 literature references (3 445 records) and the taxonomic revision of Ophiuroidea deposited at museum collections. Additionally, we detected 57 records in the literature (two Crinoidea, 21 Asteroidea, 14 Ophiuroidea, 15 Echinoidea, and five Holothuroidea) considered as invalid and which were removed from the updated checklist.\n\nInvalid and doubtful records: The records considered as invalid (52) or doubtful (five) are based on: 1) erroneous or doubtful distributions, 2) incorrect taxonomic identifications, or 3) entries in faunal list not backed up by records in the primary literature.\n\nThere are some records considered invalid because of inconsistencies in their geographical distributions. The ophiuroids Ophiocomella ophiactoides and Astrophyton muricatum, and the holothuroid Isostichopus badionotus have been reported in the CMP (Honey-EscandÃ³n et al., 2008; SolÃ­s-MarÃ­n et al., 2016b; CONANP, 2019), yet the species distribution range is exclusively for the Caribbean and the Gulf of MÃ©xico (Hendler, Miller, Pawson, & Kier, 1995; SolÃ­s-MarÃ­n et al., 2013a), meanwhile the echinoids Echinothrix calamaris and Echinothrix diadema inhabits the Indian Ocean, but have been reported in REV (Sotelo-Casas & RodrÃ­guez-Troncoso, 2014). The holothuroid Pentamera chiloensis is reported in Barra de Navidad, JAL (RodrÃ­guez-Troncoso et al., 2013); this species distributes only in South America (PerÃº and Chile; SolÃ­s-MarÃ­n et al., 2013a). Records previously mentioned correspond to erroneous records and must be invalid (R.C. Sotelo-Casas and F.A. SolÃ­s-MarÃ­n, personal communication, 01 March 2020).\n\nThe crinoid Hyocrinus foelli (SolÃ­s-MarÃ­n et al., 2013a; SolÃ­s-MarÃ­n et al., 2013b; SolÃ­s-MarÃ­n, Laguarda-Figueras, & Honey-EscandÃ³n, 2014) and the holothuroid Psychronaetes hanseni (Maluf, 1991; Bautista-Romero et al., 1994; Massin & Hendrickx, 2011) have been reported in Clarion Island, REV, but according to their original descriptions (Pawson, 1983; Roux & Pawson, 1999) and the validation of the geographical coordinates, all the records corresponds to the Clarion-Clipperton Fracture Zone which is located approximately 1 200 km far away from REV. The echinoids Aporocidaris milleri and Kamptosoma asterias were reported in NAY (station 96, 2 988-3 001 m depth) by Parker (1963), yet the validation of the geographic coordinates revealed that this station is located in the entrance of the Gulf of California, and far away from the maritime zone of NAY. Moreover, K. asterias is distributed in the Central Pacific Ocean, Chile and the Antarctica (Mooi, Constable, Lockhart, & Pearse, 2004).\n\nFurthermore, some records had inconsistencies in their taxonomic identifications. Ophionereis albomaculata (ophiuroid) has records in ISA and MAR (Caso, 1961; Maluf, 1991; Maluf & Brusca, 2005; Granja-FernÃ¡ndez et al., 2015a; Granja-FernÃ¡ndez et al., 2017); during our revision of museum collections, we taxonomically reviewed all the material known for O. albomaculata (GalÃ¡pagos Islands and PanamÃ¡), and none corresponded to MÃ©xico. The material identified as O. albomaculata from MÃ©xico must relate to another species of Ophionereis. The collected material of the holothuroid Holothuria (Lessonothuria) pardalis from REV (SolÃ­s-MarÃ­n et al., 2013a; Sotelo-Casas & RodrÃ­guez-Troncoso, 2014), was previously identified as H. (Lessenothuria) pardalis, yet it corresponds to a new species in process of description (F.A. SolÃ­s-MarÃ­n, personal communication, 01 April 2020). It is important to mention that in the CMP, the species only distributes in Tenacatita, JAL (Deichmann, 1958).\n\nMost of the entries are based on unbacked up records of primary references. Bautista-Romero et al. (1994) constructed a checklist of echinoderms from REV according to previous records (Fisher, 1911; Ziesenhenne, 1937; Caso, 1962b; Maluf, 1988), and reported: Florometra serratissima (crinoid); Amphiaster insignis, Astropecten verrilli, Echinaster (Othilia) tenuispina, Heliaster kubiniji, Henricia aspera, Henricia asthenactis, Henricia leviuscula, Henricia polyacantha, Leiaster teres, Luidia foliolata, Luidia phragma, Mediaster aequalis, Narcissia gracilis, Odontaster crassus, Tethyaster canaliculatus, and Thrissacanthias penicillatus (asteroids); Amphiodia (Amphispina) urtica, Amphipholis squamata, Amphiura arcystata, Astrocaneum spinosum, Diopederma daniana, Ophiolepis crassa, Ophionereis eurybrachiplax, Ophiopaepale diplax and Ophiura luetkenii (ophiuroids); and Arbacia stellata (as Arbacia incisa), Centrostephanus coronatus, Encope grandis, Encope micropora, Lytechinus pictus, and Strongylocentrotus fragilis (echinoids). We consulted the previous literature and we did not find these records on them or in other literature references, therefore these records are invalid.\n\nBased on literature records, Lophaster furcilliger (asteroid), Astrocaneum spinosum (ophiuroid), and Centrostephanus coronatus (echinoid) have been recorded in the program of management and conservation of REV (CONANP, 2019). The only records of L. furcilliger in the CMP correspond to MAR (Ludwig, 1905; Maluf, 1988; Maluf, 1991), therefore their inclusion in REV is incorrect. Despite it is very probable that A. spinosum and C. coronatus distributes in REV, we did not find any record in publications to back it up. Other species reported in a program of management and conservation (ISA; CONANP, 2005) are the echinoids Clypeaster europacificus and Lovenia cordiformis, but again no primary references supporting these records were found, and therefore are considered as invalid records.\n\nFinally, based on a revision of literature, the asteroids Paulia horrida and Luidia bellonae were reported in MAR by Maluf (1988) and Maluf and Brusca (2005), respectively; nevertheless, we did not find any record of these species for MAR but for REV. Similarly, the asteroid Cnemidaster nudus has only one mention for COL (SolÃ­s-MarÃ­n et al., 2016b), but it corresponds to an erroneous record (F.A. SolÃ­s-MarÃ­n, personal communication, 01 April 2020). For these reasons, we consider both records as invalid.\n\nThe following records were considered as doubtful. The ophiuroid Amphiodia periercta inhabits in the North Pacific Ocean (from Aleutian Islands, Alaska to central California; Lambert & Austin, 2007), yet it has a report in Clarion Island, REV (Maluf, 1988; Bautista-Romero et al., 1994). Due to the northern affinity of A. periercta, its distribution in REV is unlikely. The record of Hymenaster pentagonalis in REV was obtained by the Expedition Ocean Exploration Trust/Nautilus Live 2017 (CONANP, 2019), yet this species distributes only in Hawaii (Mah, 2020).\n\nThe echinoids Caenocentrotus gibbosus (Clark, 1925; Grant & Hertlein, 1938; Maluf, 1988; Maluf,1991; Bautista-Romero et al., 1994) and Lytechinus semituberculatus (Clark, 1925; Clark,1948; Mortensen, 1943b; Caso, 1962b; Maluf, 1988; Bautista-Romero et al., 1994) have many mentions in Clarion Island, REV, yet in all these references the locality is treated as doubtful. It is important to emphasize that both species inhabit in South America (GalÃ¡pagos Islands, PerÃº, and Chile; Grant & Hertlein, 1938; SolÃ­s-MarÃ­n et al., 2013a), thus their distribution in MÃ©xico is unlikely. Similarly, the holothuroid Holothuria (Selenkothuria) theeli is recorded from REV as doubtful (Hertlein, 1963; Maluf, 1991; Maluf & Brusca, 2005). In the Eastern Pacific, H. (Selenkothuria) theeli inhabits in lower latitudes (i.e. Costa Rica-PerÃº; SolÃ­s-MarÃ­n et al., 2013a) and in MÃ©xico it has been collected only in Guerrero (Honey-EscandÃ³n et al., 2008). For these reasons, we determined these records as doubtful.\n\nNew records: Following review of museum material, we add 16 new records of Ophiuroidea to different states (four NAY, one COL, and one MICH) and islands (two MAR, four ISA, and four REV) from the CMP (appendix 1). All the species were previously recorded in areas from the CMP (Table 1), excepting Amphiodia psara, Amphiodia tabogae, Microphiopholis geminata, and Ophiophragmus paucispinus, which represent new records for the CMP.\n\nAmphiodia psara has previous records in USA (California; Clark, 1935) and MÃ©xico (Gulf of California and Guerrero; Maluf, 1988; Maluf & Brusca, 2005; Granja-FernÃ¡ndez et al., 2015b). After the taxonomic revision of A. psara in different museum collections, we did not find material from Guerrero, but for the Pacific of Baja California and Baja California Sur, the Gulf of California (Ãngel de la Guarda Island, TiburÃ³n Island, Consag Rock, and Sonora), and NAY. The records from Baja California, Baja California Sur and NAY are new, being Punta Mita, Nayarit, the southernmost area of its geographical distribution.\n\nAmphiodia tabogae, M. geminata, and O. paucispinus distribute along the Eastern Pacific (MÃ©xico to GalÃ¡pagos Islands; SolÃ­s-MarÃ­n et al., 2013a). Specifically, in MÃ©xico, the three species inhabit the Gulf of California; A. tabogae has been reported also in Guerrero (Granja-FernÃ¡ndez et al., 2015b). The finding of these species in Punta Mita, NAY (A. tabogae and M. geminata), and in MAR (O. paucispinus), represents new records in the CMP, and fills the distribution gap along the Mexican Pacific.\n\nDiversity and distribution: The diversity of the Echinodermata from the CMP is represented by 187 species of echinoderms belonging to 27 orders, 63 families, 110 genera, and 16 subgenera (Table 2). Compared to the total number of echinoderm species worldwide (7 437 species; WoRMS, 2020), the CMP shelters 2.5 %. The orders with the highest number of species in the CMP were Amphilepidida (Ophiuroidea, 40 species), Holothuriida and Dendrochirotida (Holothuroidea, 21 species, respectively), Ophiacanthida (Ophiuroidea, 16 species), and Valvatida (Asteroidea, 15 species), meanwhile the best represented families were Amphiuridae (Ophiuroidea, 26 species), and Holothuriidae (Holothuroidea, 21 species) (Table 1). On the other hand, the orders Ophiurida (45 species), Aspidochirotida (22 species), and Dendrochirotida (22 species) were the best represented in the Southern Mexican Pacific (SMP; Granja-FernÃ¡ndez et al. 2015b). Differences in the numbers of recorded orders between the CMP and the SMP are due to recent changes in the systematics of the Ophiuroidea (OÂ´Hara, StÃ¶hr, Hugall, Thuy & Martynov, 2018) in which most of the members previously included in the order Ophiurida, now are in Amphilepidida, and in the Holothuroidea, where most of the members of Aspidochirotida were changed to Holothuriida (Miller et al., 2017). If we compare both faunas in the same classification system, similar trends are shown, suggesting that both areas possess similar faunas in terms of orders and families of echinoderms.\n\nIn the CMP, the class Ophiuroidea was the most numerous with 67 species, followed by Holothuroidea (50), Asteroidea (35), Echinoidea (32), and Crinoidea (three) (Table 2). In general, the number of species of Holothuroidea, Asteroidea and Echinoidea were similar between the CMP and the SMP, but Ophiuroidea was represented by more species in the CMP (67) than to the SMP (46); meanwhile, the class Crinoidea had not records in the SMP (Granja-FernÃ¡ndez et al., 2015b). Differences on the Ophiuroidea are related to the recent sampling effort directed in the CMP (Granja-FernÃ¡ndez et al., 2017), and the extensive revision of samples from museum collections (reflected in the new records of species in this work). Nine species of Crinoidea from MÃ©xico to PerÃº (SolÃ­s-MarÃ­n et al., 2013a) and at least seven in the northern part of the American continent (Lambert & Austin, 2007) are reported in the literature therefore, finding crinoids in the CMP and SMP is likely. Despite the above, a null to a scarce number of species of Crinoidea are reported in both areas. We consider that the explanation of this pattern (and in general of the Eastern Pacific) is not due to the natural biogeographic distribution of the Crinoidea in the Eastern Pacific, yet to the scarce prospection in deep waters (the natural environment of the class in the Eastern Pacific), as well as to the low interest and lack of taxonomical specialists in the class.\n\nAs previously mentioned, the CMP is represented by 187 species of echinoderms; of those, 122 inhabit in ~ 640 km of the coastline of the studied states, and 142 in an extensive maritime area of the islands (~ 155 000 km2). The SMP has not extensive islands such as the CMP, therefore if only their coastlines are compared, the latter possesses a lower number of echinoderms species than the SMP (162 species; Granja-FernÃ¡ndez et al., 2015b). In order to have a better comprehension of the number of species between both areas, a standardization per area is required, therefore considering the whole CMP (~ 640 km) has 5.2 species/km, and the SMP (~ 1 200 km) possesses 7.4 species/km. The collecting effort in more areas, habitats, and depths could explain higher biodiversity of echinoderms in the coastline of CMP, but further collections of material and biogeographic analysis are required in order to better understand their distribution pattern.\n\nIn terms of spatial distribution, the coast of the state of JAL presented the highest number of species (84), followed by the coast of NAY (74), MICH (63), and COL (55); among the islands, REV showed the major number of species (85) followed by MAR (81), MAT (48), and ISA (44) (Table 3). Compared to the most complete and recent works of echinoderms by states (Honey-EscandÃ³n et al., 2008; RodrÃ­guez-Troncoso et al., 2013; SolÃ­s-MarÃ­n et al., 2016b; Granja-FernÃ¡ndez et al., 2017; RÃ­os-Jara et al., 2017; Nava-Bravo et al., 2019) and islands (CONANP, 2005; CONANP, 2007a; CONANP, 2007b; CONANP, 2019; Honey-EscandÃ³n et al., 2008; SolÃ­s-MarÃ­n et al., 2013a; Granja-FernÃ¡ndez et al., 2017), this work increases the number of recorded species in 27 % for NAY, 49 % for JAL, 1.5 % for MICH, 70 % for MAR, 64 % for ISA, 48 % for MAT, 38 % for REV, and finally 45 % for the entire CMP region. We found the same number of species for COL as its most recent account of echinoderms (SolÃ­s-MarÃ­n et al., 2016b). Differences in the numbers of species among previous studies and the present one is attributed to a more intense literature review, the validation of geographical coordinates, the correction of records, and the addition of new ones.\n\nJAL, MAR and REV were the areas with the highest number of species and have been prospected in several shallow and deep-water localities/stations since late 1800Â´s by foreign (Albatross, Velero, and Zaca; e.g. Agassiz, 1898; Clark, 1940; Deichmann, 1958) and national expeditions (e.g. Caso, 1943b; Caso, 1961; Caso, 1962b). In contrast, the state of COL, as well as ISA and MAT islands have the lowest number of species, and their poor prospections initiated in the late 1900Â´s (e.g. Caso, 1961; Caso, 1980), and have been mostly performed during the 2000Â´s, strictly in shallow-waters (e.g. ChÃ¡vez-Dagostino et al., 2000; RÃ­os-Jara et al., 2008a, RÃ­os-Jara et al., 2013; Sotelo-Casas et al., 2018). On the other hand, MAR and REV (the unique oceanic islands of the CMP) display unique characteristics such as particular oceanographic and topographic conditions, high productivity, mesophotic reefs, great depths, among others, which promote high levels of general marine biodiversity and endemism (CONANP, 2007a; CONANP, 2019), explaining their highest number of echinoderms in the region. In conclusion, the obtained data shows that the number of species of echinoderms in the CMP region is mostly associated with a sampling effort, yet specific conditions of particular areas (i.e. MAR and REV) can be influencing their high biodiversity, but more collections of material and further biogeographic analysis are required in order to sustain this statement.\n\nFinal considerations: The CMP is located in an oceanographic transitional zone, therefore fauna from the North and South regions of the Mexican Pacific (Arriaga-Cabrera et al., 1998), the Eastern Pacific (e.g. SolÃ­s-MarÃ­n et al., 2013a), and even of higher latitudes (e.g. Lambert & Austin, 2007), can inhabit in the region. In this sense, MAR and REV are important as they are considered a stepping stone to import organisms from the Indo-Pacific species into the Tropical Eastern Pacific (Reyes-Bonilla & LÃ³pez-PÃ©rez, 1998), as well as in the connection for dispersal species to and from northern (Gulf of California) and the mainland CMP (LÃ³pez-PÃ©rez et al., 2015).\n\nAll the islands considered in the present work possess their own programs of management and conservation (CONANP, 2005; CONANP, 2007a; CONANP, 2007b; CONANP, 2019) in which detailed descriptions of geographical, physical, demographical, social and environmental characteristics (among others) are provided. Despite the above, we detected that all these programs underestimated the number of species of echinoderms since they reported 16 species for ISAB (CONANP, 2005), 24 for MAR (CONANP, 2007a), 25 for MAT (CONANP, 2007b), and 52 for REV (CONANP, 2019). The inclusion of all the species reported in the present work on the lists of these natural protected areas will further emphasize the importance of the islands.\n\nDue to the importance of the islands of the CMP, most of the research of echinoderms in the region have been conducted on them (e.g. RÃ­os-Jara et al., 2008a; Sotelo-Casas et al., 2018) relegating the mainland of the states of NAY, JAL, COL, and MICH, which remain almost unstudied and which have a high potential of finding numerous species of echinoderms since they have complex environments (extensive bays, coastal lagoons, estuaries, mangroves and coral reefs; Arriaga-Cabrera et al., 1998). Regardless the differences on the diversity of echinoderms and exploration of the mainland and islands from the CMP, all of them are important due to 34 species collected in the region have been described as new species (five Asteroidea, 16 Ophiuroidea, five Echinoidea, and eight Holothuroidea; Table 4). This highlights the potential of the CMP in finding more new species. Although the present manuscript provides the most-completed checklist of the echinoderms in the CMP, we encourage to intensify research in shallow and deep-waters and across different habitats of all the islands and mainland of the states of the region in order to better understand its biodiversity and distributional patterns. Finally, the preservation of the marine fauna of the entire CMP is key in the maintenance of the entire Mexican and Tropical Pacific; therefore, we encourage ensuring its effective protection through inventories of marine and coastal species.\n\nEthical statement: authors declare that they all agree with this publication and made significant contributions; that there is no conflict of interest of any kind; and that we followed all pertinent ethical and legal procedures and requirements.
