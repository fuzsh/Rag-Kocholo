No.\n\nListen, do you mind filling me in on what I missed?\n\n[Film] Wait for me. No.\n\nTrue Romance was such a pivotal film for me.\n\nTony as a director was kind of the ideal girl dad.\n\nEvery idea I'd have, he'd be like,\n\nThat's a great idea, let's do that.\n\nHe taught me very young, Listen to your instincts\n\nyou have very good ideas.\n\nYou know what your character's doing,\n\nmake suggestions, they're good.\n\nTry them on screen.\n\nAnd it was funny 'cause he wasn't\n\nlike that at all with Christian,\n\nbut I think that that has informed me every single day\n\nof my work ever since.\n\n[soft music] [door slams]\n\n[laughs] Hi. Hi.\n\nThe scene starts with James Gandolfini's character\n\nexplaining to her what it was like\n\nthe first time he killed someone and by the end of the scene\n\nshe's killed someone and it's him.\n\nIt was very early on in my career\n\nand someone said, You should go see it.\n\nIt's playing on Hollywood Boulevard.\n\nSo we went to the back of the theater and these women,\n\nthey're screaming standing on their seats,\n\nKill him, kill him, motherfucker, like whoa.\n\n[Ed] What you making? Booties for my father.\n\nGets cold in the hospital.\n\nMm, has he been here long?\n\nThis is my 13th pair.\n\nI got to meet Kathy O'Hara, who I portrayed in Ed Wood.\n\nMy sister Alexis was already dressing in drag\n\nand doing shows in drag\n\nbut hadn't really come out as transgender.\n\nAnd there was this whole storyline with Ed Wood\n\nwhere he was a cross dresser.\n\nAnd being able to talk to Kathy who accepted Ed, loved Ed,\n\ndidn't judge Ed for being a cross dresser in the 1950s\n\nwas really a beautiful thing.\n\nAnd I remember she said to me,\n\nYou know, Eddie was so funny the way he looked at the world\n\nand he saw beauty in everything.\n\nAnd one day I showed up and I was meeting him\n\nand I was wearing this kind of rust colored suit\n\nand Eddie goes, Stop, stop right there.\n\nI gotta get you something.\n\nAnd ran down the street and then ran back and he's like,\n\nLook at this gardenia.\n\nIt's exactly the color of your suit.\n\nNow, of course that's like a dying gardenia.\n\nIt's like a rotting gardenia.\n\nIt was so beautiful.\n\nLike Eddie didn't realize that it was something\n\nother people would cast away.\n\nHe saw the beauty in this and she saw the beauty at Eddie\n\nseeing the beauty in this thing\n\nand the innocence of his vision of the world.\n\nSo beautiful to see somebody\n\nwho could love people like that.\n\n[Fred] It's nice to know, I can still make you laugh.\n\nI like to laugh, Fred.\n\nAnd there's no filmmaker like David Lynch\n\nand there's no filmmaker that for me as an actor\n\nworked the same way David Lynch did and I'm sure he works\n\nin different ways, but on that particular job, I would say,\n\nAll right David, am I playing two people or one person?\n\nIs one a ghost?\n\nIs this an illusion?\n\nI don't know, what do you think Arquette?\n\nThe tremendous amount of faith and trust that he has\n\nin his talent, his cast is kind of amazing and terrifying.\n\nI knew that he wrote the script during the OJ Simpson trial\n\nand watching OJ Simpson in that trial,\n\nit seemed like all the evidence was pointing to him\n\nkilling his wife.\n\nAnd yet when I'd hear him talk, I didn't believe him\n\nbut I believed he believed him at a certain point.\n\nThe way that I looked at Lost Highway was,\n\nthis man loves his wife\n\nbut he can't admit to himself that he's misogynist.\n\nHe kills her, but he can't remember killing her\n\nbecause he can't see himself\n\nas that guy who would kill his wife.\n\nMy interpretation of it was all the machinations\n\nof the monsters that women were in his mind\n\nand how he killed her and couldn't even admit to himself\n\nhe killed her.\n\nThe windows won't open\n\nand the children and I would enjoy a breeze now and then.\n\nI can fix that.\n\nI got an opportunity to work on Holes\n\nand Andy Davis was our director and he was lovely\n\nand I really love the character of Kissing Kate.\n\nShe loved Sam the Onion man and he loved her.\n\nAnd it was kind of magical being a part of that movie\n\nbecause there's people of a certain age when they come up\n\nand they're like, You are.\n\nI'm like, oh, you saw Holes?\n\nI see the truth. I see it.\n\nIt's like a freaking television show or a dream.\n\nDreams are dreams. Everybody dreams.\n\nWell does everybody see dead people\n\nstanding around their bed?\n\nI kind of saw that movies were going\n\nin this direction already where it was moving towards\n\nthese tent pictures and less art films,\n\nbecause movie actors were not doing TV then.\n\nAnd I decided, let me try to jump into this thing\n\nand see how it is.\n\nGlenn Gordon Caron is really a very talented writer.\n\nJake Weber who played my husband is an incredible actor\n\nand it was really the family story.\n\nThe real challenge of television like that to be the lead\n\nin a one hour that you're in almost every single scene.\n\nIt was utterly exhausting to shoot 22 episodes of something.\n\nIt makes you fast, you learn your lines really fast,\n\nit hones a lot of skills.\n\nYou also have to like jump into things\n\nand that's kind of a great exercise in itself.\n\nA lot of people watch that show with their family.\n\nA lot of people were like,\n\nThat was mine and my mom's show. We'd watch it together.\n\nand that's beautiful to be a part of that.\n\nAnd again, my grandpa was in live TV.\n\nHe was on Hollywood Squares.\n\nTo be a part of the history of television, it's great.\n\n'Turn back, turn back.\n\nI don't wanna talk to Mooning Myrtle.'\n\n'Who?' said Harry as they backtracked quickly.\n\nRichard Linkletter gave me a call once.\n\nI'm thinking about doing this movie, you know,\n\nshoots a week, a year.\n\nI was like, Okay, are you thinking about me for it?\n\nHe was like, Yeah, I'm wondering.\n\nI was like, Yeah man, I'm in like, what's the story?\n\nHe was like, Well it's kind of about this boy.\n\nAnd really him growing up.\n\nAnd I thought first of all, I mean how do you get funding\n\nfor a movie that you're not going to see any returns on\n\nfor it was actually 12 years.\n\nThat's amazing that you've got funding\n\nfor something like that.\n\nI knew that nobody had done it like that.\n\nAnd I always wanted to work with Ethan Hawke.\n\nI always wanted to work with Rick\n\nand to have this opportunity to make this movie was great.\n\nI just thought there would be more.\n\nIt was like one of the greatest experiences of my life.\n\nIt was like going to summer camp every year\n\ngoing to work on Boyhood.\n\nThere'd be people who started, as, you know,\n\nPA's the first year, by the 12th year\n\nthey were first AD's they'd come back as PAs on this.\n\nYou know, people would leave jobs\n\nthat they were in the middle of just to come back.\n\nThey'd take days off.\n\nIt was such an important art project\n\nfor all of us and it was so low key.\n\nIt was like, Oh, there's some cheese whizz and crackers\n\nover on the table. [laughs]\n\nIt was super low-fi.\n\nAt one point Rick was ready to shoot\n\nand he called the the movie company and they're like,\n\nOh, we forgot about it and we've closed our books\n\nfor the year and we don't have money for this year.\n\nHe's like, Well luckily my house just burnt\n\ndown and I just got an insurance check.\n\nSo I'll forward you guys the money for this year.\n\nThere's nobody like Richard Linkletter\n\nand I mean he's a visionary\n\nand if you look at his body of work\n\nI mean he's really a true American original.\n\nI'm lucky to be her mom.\n\nI was born to be her mom.\n\n[Interviewer] And are you excited to be here\n\nand make new friends Gypsy?\n\n[Gypsy] Oh yeah. You bet she is.\n\nMy mom was a therapist\n\nso she would talk about different kind of behavioral traits\n\ndifferent people would have.\n\nSo narcissism, codependence, all kinds of different things.\n\nWhen I was getting ready to play Deedee Blanchard,\n\nI wanted to kind of figure out a way\n\nto understand this lady.\n\nI don't feel like I need to defend my characters.\n\nI feel like as a woman, I've spent a lot of my life\n\ntrying to defend everything and defend my choices\n\nand defend who I am as a person.\n\nI feel liberated from that in acting.\n\nI do need to understand my characters.\n\nI have to have an understanding of them.\n\nThey may be the bad guy, but they don't see it that way.\n\nI don't think she was conscious\n\nthat she had this need to be this codependent\n\nto such a dangerous element.\n\nI think she really did think\n\nshe was smarter than the doctors\n\nand she really did think what she saw on the internet\n\nmust be what's going on.\n\nSelf-deception is a very dangerous thing in its own self.\n\nI think once I find something that feels right\n\nfor the character and it fits into the logic for me\n\nin the way they think, that's all I really need.\n\nOh, a handshake is available upon request.\n\nThank you. May I have a handshake?\n\nBen and I had done a movie called Flirting With Disaster\n\nmany years ago as actors and then he called me to do\n\nEscape at Dannemora and he was such a great director.\n\nAnd then he called me about Severance,\n\nwhich is completely different character,\n\ncompletely different feeling.\n\nBut I really had a lot of faith in Ben as a director.\n\nOkay. [maraca rattling]\n\n[funky music]\n\nYou got it.\n\nI just wasn't sure\n\nif people were gonna wanna watch Severance\n\n'cause it's so claustrophobic\n\nand it's so constrained and contained.\n\nI wasn't sure if people would wanna go into that world\n\nwhen we were all just locked down for a year and a half,\n\nbut I was happily surprised\n\nthat people really responded to it.\n\nIn general, people have grown up very indoctrinated\n\nto certain belief systems and I think Harmony\n\nis one of those people who's really committed to this.\n\nA lot of times institutions,\n\nthey don't really have space for the individual.\n\nIn fact, everything that is the individual,\n\nwhether it's your instincts or your weird choices\n\nor the way you look or any of that\n\nis kind of drilled outta you.\n\nThe only thing that the corporation\n\nor this entity wants you to do is to be like a worker,\n\nto go by the rules to do all of these things.\n\nAnd that's a big component of Mrs. Cobel.\n\nNow when she's Mrs. Selvig,\n\nshe's kind of experimenting with what is it like\n\nfor people to be neighbors with people\n\nand to have friendships and chum around with each other.\n\n[Mark] Mrs. Selvig. Peace offering.\n\nAre we fighting?\n\nI just keep thinking about those dumb bins.\n\nIt's kind of new to her.\n\nShe's kind of trying on what is that like\n\nto not be observed.\n\nAt the same time, she has an agenda\n\nand it is for the corporation\n\nand she is doing this in belief that this is her work.\n\n[truck rumbling]\n\nOh, I'm sorry, would you excuse me?\n\nWhat the hell happened?\n\nHit and run. I'm never going to that Walmart again.\n\nWas inspired by one of our show creators, Nancy Fishman,\n\nher sister Marjorie who was a drug addict and loved opera\n\nand all these different things and was a bit of a hustler\n\nbut who said to her at one point,\n\nYou know what, I should be a P.I.\n\nAnd she was like, Well that's crazy\n\nbut that you would be an incredible pi.\n\nPeggy was running away from a lot of her own pain\n\nand avoiding it and keeping her life chaotic and disastrous.\n\nSo she didn't really have to look or feel all of that\n\nfeelings that she couldn't.\n\nHer self-deception, her conning other people.\n\nShe is in this duality being a lost person, a disaster,\n\na destructive force, and also someone who picks up\n\nbroken birds and is codependent\n\nand wants to take care of people\n\nand make the world a better place\n\nand fix everything for everyone.\n\nShe's both of these things\n\nand doesn't know which one will win.\n\nAnd I've found some of the most beautiful people\n\nthat I ever knew were addicts and that\n\nthey had this illness and they had beautiful qualities\n\nand a lot of them lost their battle and didn't make it.\n\nYou love me, right Denny?\n\nAre you kidding me?\n\nI'm gonna be buried with this.\n\nIf you really love me\n\nyou'll gimme the one thing that I really crave\n\nwhich is freedom, which is a divorce.\n\nIt could be easy to make her not an addict\n\nand all these different things to clean it all up\n\nand homogenize it, but I'm not really interested in that.\n\nMy whole career has been about brave choices,\n\nbrave filmmakers, brave writers,\n\nand something that resonates the truth to me.\n\nAnd while this is a farce and this is a comedy,\n\nit's also based in some kind of reality, loss, pain,\n\na want for connection.\n\nAll these characters want family and connection in some way\n\nbut it is a counterculture comedy\n\nand it is a farce and it is far out.\n\nThat's why I think loving people like that\n\nis pretty beguiling when you have it in your life\n\nand you don't know where they're gonna come out\n\nif they're gonna come out on top or where,\n\nbut they all have beautiful hearts.\n\n[soft piano music]\n\nWhen I was 17, people would say,\n\nWell, what do you wanna be?\n\nI'd say, Well, I really wanna be a midwife or an actor.\n\nAt the end of failing for one year of being an actor\n\nI was gonna go back to school and be a midwife.\n\nI'm gonna give it my all for one year,\n\nflop every day for a year, fail every day for a year.\n\nAnd then I'll know I really tried.\n\nAnd something mysterious happened during that year.\n\nI got jobs and little by little I just got better\n\nand I still kept getting opportunities.\n\nNone of that would've ever happened\n\nif I was too scared to try.\n\nThere's no formula for it.\n\nYou gotta kind of follow your own heart.\n\n[peaceful jazz music]"
