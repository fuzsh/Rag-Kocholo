        "text": "Ever sense I first watched 1993’s “The Nightmare Before Christmas” as a little kid, the name Tim Burton became one that I kept a close eye on, and over time I not only became a fan, but was determined to watch everyone of his films. One that surprisingly went under my radar for many years was his 1994 picture “Ed Wood”, which focused on the real life 1950’s director Edward D. Wood, Jr. … who was branded for making some of the worst movies ever made, and yet has endured over time as a B-Movie cult hero. I first learned of director Ed Wood way back when I was in a high school film class, and I watched some of his most famous stinkers … namely his 1959 Sci-Fi classic “Plan 9 From Outer Space”. It was a perfect time to be introduced to Tim Burtons “Ed Wood” picture, and needless to say, this is one of Burtons best movies. When watching Tim Burton’s films, there’s a day and night difference between the movies he was hired by a studio to direct, and his passion projects he pitched to a studio. “Ed Wood” is a clear passion project right from the heart of the director, and is a loving tribute to people with creative passions. While I wouldn’t call this one of my personal favorite movies, I absolutely would label “Ed Wood” as my personal favorite in the category of “movies about making movies”. It’s the one I’ve watched the most, influenced me the most, and one that I’d encourage anyone to check out.\n\nSet in the backdrop of 1950’s Hollywood, we follow the journey of the young writer Director Edward D. Wood Jr. as he follows his boundless passion for making movies. Unfortunately, he didn’t always have the time or money to make his dreams a reality, and thus he had to work supper fast and supper cheap. With the support of the formerly famous Bela Lugosi of “Dracula” fame, and a devoted cast and crew of show-business misfits who believe in Ed's off-kilter vision, the filmmaker was able to bring his oversize dreams to cinematic life … resulting in some of the most famous, B-grade pictures ever made. The movie fallows his behind-the-scenes miss-haps of his three most famous pictures … the 1953 bio-flick “Glen or Glenda”, his 1955 horror movie “Bride of the Monster”, and of course his legendary 1959 Sci-Fi stinker “Plan 9 from Outer Space”. It should quickly be noted that, despite fallowing a real-life director, there are some historical liberties taken to fit within Tim Burton’s quirky vision, and romanticized presentation. Despite not being a perfect historical retelling, this film is clearly coming from a place of love and affection for the real-life artist, and the exaggerations aren’t too outlandish to throw off the experience.\n\nAside from Burton’s inspired vision, the heart of this movie comes from a young Johnny Depp in the leading role of Ed Wood. This was before he become a famous Hollywood celebrity, and to date … I think it’s one of the greatest performances in his whole career. Of course, it got repetitive that for two decades, Johnny Depp became Tim Burton’s most frequent leading star … but in this film, Depp is perfect for the role, and should have gotten some Oscar recognition for it. The excitement on his face, the energy he displays, and the passion he conveys are absolutely infectious. Along with Depp’s performance, this is just a great character. Despite his quirky nature, this is a guy who playfully encourages the viewer to follow their passions, regardless of the opposition you may face. He’s the kind of guy who’s always excepting of the end result, because regardless of what others may think of his work … he spent his time working on something he was passionate for, and that’s all that matters. There’s a great scene in which Ed sits down at a dinner with legendary filmmaker Orson Wells, and the two have a poignant talk on how one man’s vision is worth fighting for ... which has always stuck with me. Maybe Ed’s direction was misguided, but in the director’s mind, he was living the dream, and following his creative vision to the letter ... and it’s hard to fault someone for that. Obviously, it’s great when an artist creates something that’s meant to appeal to the majority of viewers, but once in a while it’s healthy for a visionary to just make art for themselves.\n\nAnother strength to this film is a dynamite ensemble cast, most of whom became reoccurring talents in a number of Tim Burton productions. Sarah Jessica Parker, who was fresh off of “Hocus Pocus”, plays Ed Woods skeptical first wife, and has a flare being charismatic in her cynicism. Patricia Arquette is naturally lovable as Eddies second wife Kathy O’ Hara. Jeffrey Jones is a perfect match for playing the quirky TV psychic Criswell, as is Lisa Marie as horror host Vampira, and George Steele was perfect for portraying heavy weight boxing co-star Tor Johnson. Of course, Bill Murry is always a welcome presence, even in the small supporting role of Eddies close friend John Breckinridge. However, the big one who steals the show is Martin Landau in the role of horror movie legend Bela Lugosi. Straight to the point, this is one of the all-time greatest portrayals of a real-life actor put to film, and Martin Landau rightfully won the Academy Award for Best Supporting actor. At this time in the setting of the film, Bela Lugosi was addicted to drugs, his career was in the gutter, and he wasn’t expecting to live through the decade. Ed Wood however was a long-time fan of his iconic horror movie portrayals, and gave the struggling actor a chance to feel at home acting in his movies. There’s a great scene in which the two are sitting-down watching one of Lugosi’s early horror movies from 1932 titled “White Zombie”, and it’s not only a great bonding scene for the two, but we also see how Lugosi’s mannerisms became a direct influence in Eddies monster films.\n\nThe look of the movie is also a loving recreation of 1950’s Hollywood, with a gorgeous Black and White pallet, and great attention to detail in replicating the sets from Ed Woods films. Even the replicated look of the characters is perfect, and Rick Backer also rightfully Won the Academy Award for Best Makeup. There’s also an effective use of music, which compliments the characters. Whenever there’s a positive moment with Ed Wood, it’s usually accompanied with the original score from 1953’s “Glen or Glenda”. Whenever it’s a dramatic moment with Bela Lugosi, we hear the “Swan Lake” music, which was featured in the opening of the 1931 “Dracula” classic. Speaking of music, it should be noted that Danny Elfman, who frequently composes the music in Burton’s films, didn’t compose the music for “Ed Wood”. Instead, this score was conducted by Howard Shore, who’s arguably most famous for the music he composed for the “Lord of the Rings” movies. Needless to say, this score is outstanding, and a loving nod to music ques of 1950’s Sci-Fi cinema. Of course, this brings me to my personal favorite scene of the whole film … the opening credits. Tim Burton is no stranger to featuring memorable opening credit sequences to his films, but I’d go so far as to label this opening to “Ed Wood” as my second favorite of his behind “Edward Scissorhands”. It begins with a creepy house in the middle of a stormy night (which is a nod to “Bride of the Monster”), followed by Criswell rising from a Coffin in the same style of Ed Woods early horror productions. The cast names are then presented as carvings in cheap looking grave stones, which is another loving nod to Ed Woods cheap productions. We then get a stop motion octopus, flying saucers, and Howard Shores background music once again is fantastic.\n\nIn the end, “Ed Wood” fits right in with Burtons strange style, and is arguably one of the most inspiring films of Tim Burton's career. There are hardships that come from making movies or pursuing passions, and this movie might just be the confidence boost you need to fallow your dreams, regardless of what the outcome might be. Not only is this movie a great influence on people who aspire to be filmmakers, but anyone pursuing a creative medium can find something to connect to in this film. It goes above typical Tim Burton flare, and I feel should have at least gotten a nomination at the Oscars for best picture. “Ed Wood” was a special discovery back in my high-school years, and it’s one well worth viewing, even if you’re not exactly a fan of Tim Burton’s style."
