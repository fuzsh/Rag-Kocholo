        "text": "Step back in time this week with Tim Burton’s biopic of the worst acclaimed director of all time, Ed Wood, in 1994’s Ed Wood.\n\nThe Plot\n\nIt’s 1950’s Hollywood, and Ed Wood is struggling for success. His play is a bomb, but that doesn’t stop the plucky creative. Trying to break into show business, Ed is rejected by all the major studios.\n\nAfter making friends with the legendary actor Bela Lugosi, Ed uses this friendship to make a film outside the major studio system, Glen or Glenda. With the acclaim of Lugosi as star, the film is made, but Wood is no more successful than he was before.\n\nHis wife Delores has stuck by him since the beginning, but his lifestyle and bad movies are the breaking point. She leaves, sending Ed into despair. When Bela requires commitment to a hospital, it looks as if the world is falling apart for Ed Wood.\n\nIn Bela’s salvation Ed meets Kathy. They connect instantly, and on their first date, Ed shares his love of wearing women’s clothes. This isn’t a deal breaker for Kathy and rejuvenated by his new relationship Ed plunges back into making movies. His biggest film to date Plan 9 From Outer Space is on deck, and with Bela starring in the film it will certainly help the struggling filmmaker breakthrough into mainstream success.\n\nEven the death of Bela Lugosi won’t stop Ed. Using doubles, poor special effects, and some questionable investors (a Baptist Church) Ed completes Plan 9 From Outer Space. The film premieres and flush with the success of completing the film, Ed and Kathy drive off into the hopeful sunset, to get married in Las Vegas.\n\nThe Good\n\nFilming the picture in black and white was a brilliant idea. By doing this it makes the life of Ed Wood seem substantial and glorious, much like the late director would have viewed his own pictures. The black and white style makes me feel like I am watching a film from the 1950s and brings the believability to the scenes that a colorized movie may have lacked.\n\nJohnny Depp is perfect. His style, tone, and performance from the highs and lows of the life of Ed Wood make this one of his most compelling and memorable roles. There is a magnificent sense of naivete/innocence that makes the audience feel for Ed Wood. Depp not being nominated for an Oscar is a shock.\n\nMartin Landau is worthy of his Oscar. I wondered what the big deal was in 1995 when he won all the awards, since I hadn’t seen the film, but now I get it. Landau not only puts on a great performance, but he channels that brilliance of Bela Lugosi in a performance this is one for the ages.\n\nThe Bad and the Ugly\n\nThe fact that the film does not include some relevant facts about the life of Ed Wood is disappointing. As the credits roll, we see a what happens section for each character in real life, and then we see a small mention about Wood’s drinking.\n\nThe real Delores Fuller was upset by her portrayal in the film. In the movie it alludes to her leaving because she thought Ed was a terrible filmmaker, and she couldn’t tolerate his crossdressing. Fuller has publicly stated that Ed’s drinking was the real motivator behind their split.\n\nBeyond the Film Facts\n\nThe Streamy Award\n\n{Watch on your phone (1) Watch on a tablet (2) Perfect travel entertainment (3) Best at home with the biggest screen (4)}\n\nEd Wood is a special film that will certainly not meet everyone’s expectations. Fans of 1950's Hollywood will want to check out this masterpiece from Burton, and fans of cinema should certainly check out this look back to the most popular awful director outside the studio system. Do you need the biggest screen to enjoy this movie? No.\n\nEd Wood gets a “Level 3” ranking on the Streamy Awards. Have a trip coming up and you need to pass the travel time? Download Ed Wood.\n\nCast and Crew\n\nDirected by Tim Burton\n\nProduced by Touchstone Pictures\n\nRelease Date: October 7, 1994\n\nBudget: $18 million\n\nBox Office Gross\n\nDomestic: $5,887, 725\n\nComing Soon"
