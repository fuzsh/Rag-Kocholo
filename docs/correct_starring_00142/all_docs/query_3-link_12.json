        "text": "In the second of numerous projects with Johnny Depp, Tim Burton directs the apparently truthful story of Ed Wood, who has been named as the world’s worst director. While suiting Burton’s trend of dark, quirky films, I found that Ed Wood (1994) was not the same calibre of film I expect to see from Burton. While I appreciated the humour displayed throughout the film, I had the impression that parts were meant to be decidedly more amusing than I found them. Such as Depp’s portrayal of Wood and his personality, I thought was awkward and stereotypical. For instance, during the numerous times Wood receives feedback or criticisms, he is overbearingly cheerful and optimistic in his reply/reaction. There are few times when he shows any doubt, despite his dire situation, and even then they come across as very predictable. Also, the repetition of how, whenever Wood tells anyone of his transvestite tendencies, they always doubt his heterosexuality or think of it as a joke is particularly annoying. Though it may represent the response of people at the time it irked me, as it comes across as trying to get a laugh from the audience. Furthermore, I thought the film lacked any proper depth, or seriousness, as from the wide range of the cast, I found there were few memorable characters such as Bela Lugosi (Martin Landau), Vampira (Lisa Marie) and Ed Wood. Lugosi and the reoccurring issue of his drug addiction is glimpsed at and occasionally seen in a little more depth, such as when Lugosi is tempted to kill himself. That being said, I did enjoy Landau’s depiction of Lugosi, while somewhat cheesy in places, did offer a character that the audience could sympathise with. Vampira was a nice reprieve from Wood’s cheerfulness as she offered dry wit and a dark sense of humour. While being dismissive of Wood at first she eventually joins the cast for ‘Plan 9 from Outer Space’ and then becomes part of Wood’s social sphere – shown frequently with Lugosi and Tor. She is also a contrast with Dolores (Sarah Jessica Parker) and Kathy (Patricia Arquette) as she is independent and very aware of the reality around her, particularly in the entertainment industry. However she is also used in a comical sense, such as when she rides the bus in her full Vampira outfit, getting strange looks from other passengers. There were character’s that seem as though they were involved in the film, purely for their comedic value or to their role is limited, and seen to be used as a tool for the plot. An obvious example of this is Loretta King (Juliet Landau) who Ed assumes is very wealthy, and tries to manipulate her into being the financial backer for his film. Yet, other than providing tension and discourse for Ed and Dolores’ relationship, she is soon cast aside and forgotten in the film. Furthermore Bill Murray’s character, Bunny Breckinridge, is used for his comedic value, such as when Ed Wood convinces his friends to be baptised in order to work on his new project and Bunny flails around in the water. He is also used in the plot to help Wood, with his transvestism and his film career. In addition, the Swedish wrestler – turned actor Tor Johnson (George Steele) is shown as a hulking figure and simple. He is often led around by others and his gigantic stature is shown to his detriment as he needs help – seen by when filming he is ‘given a hand’ by Ed’s production assistants, even when they are acting as police officers fighting against Tor and also when he walks into the set wall during a take, when he had meant to walk through the door. These characters and others were rather flat, with the audience only being able to take them at face value because there was no deeper interaction to glean any depth from, despite the length of the film which could have allowed for it. As such my favourite part of the film was the ending wherein the audience is told of the lives of the rest of the characters, and where Burton reminds the audience that Ed Wood is based on actual people and their lives, if not slightly embellished. Seeing as I started watching the film knowing nothing about director Ed Wood, I can say I know a little more about him, while the cast and their performances made watching the film worthwhile, I doubt I would recommend the film to anyone if they weren’t interested in Ed Wood anyway. Overall, I am hesitant to say the film is anything other than slightly informative, passably amusing and about thirty minutes too long.\n\nPrint this review"
