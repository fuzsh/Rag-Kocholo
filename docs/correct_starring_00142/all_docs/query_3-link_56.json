Oscar–winning actor Michelle Yeoh received the tribute last year. “Being one of Hollywood’s most audacious talents, Patricia consistently challenges conventions and elevates the discourse on salary equity for women through her influential platform,” TIFF CEO Cameron Bailey said Wednesday.\n\nMore from The Hollywood Reporter\n\nSpotify CFO Touts AI DJ, Podcasting \"Evolution\": \"We Are Signing Deals Differently\"\n\nBoy Pursues Late Mother in Hayao Miyazaki's Animated 'The Boy and the Heron' Trailer\n\nWarner Music CEO Says Services Need to Be \"Taking a Page Out of Netflix's Playbook\"\n\nArquette is known for roles in Tony Scott’s True Romance, Tim Burton’s Ed Wood, David Lynch’s Lost Highway and Richard Linklater’s Boyhood, for which she won the best supporting actress Oscar. She also earned one Emmy for Medium and two Golden Globes for Boyhood and Escape at Dannemora.\n\nArquette has also campaigned over the years for equal pay for women, including outside of Hollywood and in the wider economy. She makes her feature directorial debut on Gonzo Girl, which has a world premiere at TIFF and stars Willem Dafoe and Camila Morrone and is based on Cheryl Della Pietra’s semi-autobiographical novel chronicling her time as Hunter S. Thompson’s personal assistant.\n\nOther TIFF Tribute Award honorees this year include Vicky Krieps, Colman Domingo, Andy Lau, Carolina Markowicz, Lukasz Zal, Shawn Levy, Pedro Almodovar and Spike Lee.\n\nThe Toronto Film Festival is set to run from Sept. 7 through Sept. 17, with the TIFF Tribute Awards — an annual fundraiser for the festival and a stop on the awards season circuit — set to be handed out Saturday, Sept. 9.\n\nBest of The Hollywood Reporter\n\nKim Cattrall and Five Actors Who Made Surprising Returns to a Role\n\n10 Times Hollywood Predicted the Scary (or Not So Scary) Future of AI\n\n21 Actors Who Committed to Method Acting at Some Point in Their Career"
