        "text": "ED WOOD\n\nUS, 1994, 127 minutes, Black and white.\n\nJohnny Depp, Martin Landau, Sarah Jessica Parker, Patricia Arquette, Jeffrey Jones, G.D. Spradlin, Vincent D'Onofrio, Bill Murray, Mike Starr, Lisa Marie, George ‘The Animal’ Steele, Juliet Landau, Rance Howard.\n\nDirected by Tim Burton.\n\nEdward D. Wood Jr was once voted the worst director of all time. This is rather unfair as there are many other contenders and possible winners. However, he became famous with the reissue of his Plan 9 From Outer Space and the cult following for his first film, Glen or Glenda. However, if he has some claim to better fame, it is in his Bride of the Monster – which can stand up against several other B-features of the period.\n\nAs played by Johnny Depp, he is the eternal optimist. He writes, produces, directs, all with unbounded enthusiasm and faith in his own abilities which were, to be generous, exceedingly limited. He also has the capacity for supporting rather needy people. In the film, this is very important for his relationship with Bela Lugosi (Martin Landau in an Oscar-winning performance, as well as winning many other awards).\n\nThe film is very interesting in its picture of Bela Lugosi in his down-and-out days, a drug addict and alcoholic, abandoned by his wives. By chance he meets Ed Wood, finds him a friend, agrees to act in his films – and Landau’s rendition of the famous home speech from Bride of the Monster is a masterpiece of interpretation as well as impersonation. Martin Landau creates a three-dimensional character, a strange being, however, he does with great empathy.\n\nThe film has a very strong supporting cast with Sarah Jessica Parker very good as Dolores Fuller, Ed Wood’s first girlfriend, and Patricia Arquette coming in at the end as the woman who became his wife. Jeffrey Jones, who appeared in several of Tim Burtons films, is Criswell, the TV seer. Bill Murray primps and preens as Bunny Breckinridge whose ambition is to have a sex change. Lisa Marie is Vampyra, the television personality who introduced horror films and eventually appeared in Plan 9 From Outer Space. A feature of Wood’s films was the Big Tour Johnson, here played by George Steele.\n\nThere is a cameo by Vincent D'Onofrio as Orson Welles discussing films (with some wry comments on casting Charlton Heston in A Touch of Evil) and encouraging Wood who sees the parallel between the two of them.\n\nThe film spends a great deal of time recreating the making of Glen or Glenda, The Bride of the Monster (initially called The Bride of the Atom) and Plan 9 From Outer Space, which gives a very solid impression of Wood and his film-making.\n\nThe film also recreates the atmosphere of Hollywood in the 1950s, the group on the fringe making B-budget movies (or less) and the money-making hopes of producers.\n\nTim Burton was to make a number of very striking films including Beetlejuice, Batman, Batman Returns, Big Fish. His films with Johnny Depp were very striking indeed beginning with Edward Scissorhands, then Ed Wood, followed by Sleepy Hollow, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, The Corpse Bride and Sweeney Todd.\n\nThis is a very impressive film in all ways and an impressive look at Hollywood – and a strange tribute to an almost talentless film-maker.\n\n1.Audience knowledge of Ed Wood? Of Glen or Glenda, of Bride of the Monster, of Plan 9 From Outer Space? Audience knowledge of Bela Lugosi and Dracula? The reputation of Ed Wood?\n\n2.The film as a tribute, as a critique, as a film of amazement about a man with no talent? His optimism and his achievement?\n\n3.The black and white photography, the 1950s, the world of Hollywood and its atmosphere? Wood’s world? Bela Lugosi’s world? Hollywood? The world of addiction? The world of the studios? Musical score?\n\n4.The making and re-creation of scenes from Glen or Glenda, Bride of the Atom, Plan 9 From Outer Space? The talent of the film in dramatising talentlessness? The effect, the image of Ed Wood, of Lugosi? The dramatic significance of Lugosi’s speech about home – Martin Landau’s delivery and the repetition of the speech? Offering some depth?\n\n5.Johnny Depp as Ed Wood, the background of his war experience, his vision for film-making, being limited and mundane in imagination, his ability to be delighted, excited? Eternal optimism? His relationship with Dolores, their life, his hopes, writing the scripts, her assisting him, his relationship to Bela Lugosi and helping him at the end of his life, with Bunny Breckinridge, with Tor, with Criswell and the coterie? Going to producers, his spiel, trying to raise money? Satisfied with the performances, cutting after one take, his admiration for what he had done?\n\n6.Ed Wood and his pride, his angora fetish, Dolores and her missing clothes, his explanation about his mother, wanting a daughter, dressing up in women’s clothes, not homosexual orientation? The war, what he was wearing in a raid? Dolores’ reaction, her finally accepting the truth? His telling the producer about his life? Directing wearing the clothes? Later wearing them to calm himself down from stress? The Baptists and their reaction? Writing Glen or Glenda, acting in the film, the background of Christine Jorgensen’s sex change, his pitch, performing the role himself? As a means of talking about himself?\n\n7.The scripts, the pitches, the producers, George and his giving him some backing? Mr Feldman, taking the film – and later laughing when screening it? His films and the lowest common denominator? At work, the arguments? His production team, the old men, the two young men and their ingenuous behaviour (and talking Boris Karloff to Lugosi)?\n\n8.Ed passing the shop, the coffin, the encounter with Bela Lugosi, admiration, talk, giving him a lift, phoning him, the meetings, going to his house? Offering him roles?\n\n9.Bela Lugosi and the impact of Dracula, living on that reputation? His career? His drugs, alcohol, wives leaving him? His friendship with Eddie and reliance on him? Discussions, his performances, with the group, the premieres, the autographs? His failure and humiliation on the comedy show on television? The fundraising and his being the name to draw the funds? The failures of these events? His home speech? The nights, ringing Ed, the drugs, on set, weary, getting his fix? His decision to go to rehabilitation, the agony of his drying out? Happy in the final days of his life? His funeral?\n\n10.Criswell, the introduction to the film, his performance on TV, his prophesies about 1970, his praising Ed, going out to dinner, becoming part of the group?\n\n11.Bunny, mournful, wanting the sex change, the visit to Mexico, coming back with the band, his performance in the film?\n\n12.Dolores, strong woman, helping Ed, loving him, the shock about the cross-dressing, her performance, wanting the central role in The Bride of the Monster, Ed and his meeting the actress, Dolores’ small role, her finally leaving?\n\n13.The actress in the bar, Ed talking with her, assuming she had money, her demand for the central role, the performance, the rivalry with Dolores, the irony that she had no money?\n\n14.Tor, Dolores, Bunny and Ed going to the wrestling, Ed imagining Tor in films, the proposal, Tor as a person, the acting, part of the group?\n\n15.Ed waiting at the hospital, the encounter with Kathy, nice, her father, their chatting, going to together, her helping him, the relationship, marriage? The premiere in the rain?\n\n16.The cameo of Orson Welles, Ed’s admiration for him, comparisons with him, Welles and his comments about Charlton Heston, about his films, encouraging Ed?\n\n17.Going to the Baptists, the discussions, the whole group being baptised, Bunny and his awkwardness? The Baptists on set, wanting changes, thinking there was blasphemy, coming up with the title of Plan 9 From Outer Space? Ed’s exasperation and walking out, coming back wearing the clothes?\n\n18.Vampyra, her shows on television, ignoring Ed after his plea at the fundraiser, her being sacked, meeting with Ed, her performing in the film?\n\n19.Doctor Mason, Ed and his vision, having him to substitute for Bela Lugosi? Mr McCoy?, the fundraising pitch, McCoy? wanting his son in the film and changing the ending? Wanting explosions?\n\n20.Ed as a person, with the producers, with people, on set, with his crew, improvising, the streets, stealing the rubber monster for his film, watching the footage and incorporating it, his cutting after one take, zest in writing scripts, feeling that they were improved, his premieres, the booze and mayhem, the premiere in the rain, success?\n\n21.Insights into Hollywood, moviemaking, movie marketing – and the audiences who liked Ed Wood’s films?"
