        "text": "Patricia Arquette (born April 8, 1968, Chicago, Illinois, U.S.) is an American actress whose performance in Richard Linklater’s film Boyhood (2014)—filmed in increments over a 12-year period—was praised for its naturalism and lack of vanity. She won a BAFTA Award, a Golden Globe, and an Academy Award for best supporting actress for her role as a divorced single mother who grows into herself as she raises her children.\n\nArquette was born into a performing-arts family, and all four of her siblings (Rosanna, Richmond, David, and Alexis Arquette) became actors. After an unconventional childhood that included a period spent on a commune, Arquette left home at the age of 15 to move in with her sister Rosanna, who was already an established film actress. Patricia Arquette made her film debut in the horror movie A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors (1987) and worked steadily thereafter, taking guest roles in TV shows and larger parts in minor films. Arquette won praise for her performances as the naïve girlfriend of a former convict in The Indian Runner (1991), Sean Penn’s debut as a director, and as an abused hearing-impaired girl in the 1991 TV movie Wildflower, directed by Diane Keaton, before her breakout role as the charming prostitute Alabama Whitman in True Romance (1993), written by Quentin Tarantino and directed by Tony Scott.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nOscar-Worthy Movie Trivia\n\nArquette played opposite Johnny Depp in Tim Burton’s Ed Wood (1994) and took the lead role in the political drama Beyond Rangoon (1995). She made notable appearances in David Lynch’s Lost Highway (1997), Martin Scorsese’s Bringing Out the Dead (1999), the children’s film Holes (2003), and Linklater’s Fast Food Nation (2006). She acted in the latter film while already working with Linklater on Boyhood. Arquette’s later movies included Permanent (2017), a coming-of-age tale set in 1983, and Otherhood (2019), a comedy in which three empty nesters attempt to reconnect with their adult children."
