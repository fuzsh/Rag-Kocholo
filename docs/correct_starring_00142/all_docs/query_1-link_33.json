        "text": "Patricia T. Arquette Wiki Biography\n\nPatricia Arquette was born on 8 April 1968, in Chicago, Illinois USA, of Jewish and French-Canadian descent. Patricia is an actress, probably best known for being a part of films such as âEd Woodâ, âBringing Out the Deadâ, and âA Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriorsâ. Sheâs also known for being part of the series âMediumâ, and all of her efforts have helped put her net worth to where it is today.\n\nHow rich is Patricia Arquette? As of mid-2016, sources inform us of a net worth that is at $24 million, mostly earned through a successful career as an actress. Sheâs been a part of award-winning films, and has earned her fair share of awards as well. Sheâs also become popular for numerous independent films, all of which have helped ensure her wealth.\n\nPatricia Arquette Net Worth $24 Million Dollars\n\nPatricia is the daughter of actor Lewis Arquette and her grandfather was comedian Cliff Arquette. She and her siblings would eventually become actors and follow the career path of their father. Eventually their father settled in Los Angeles, California where she witnessed him at work.\n\nArquette started working as an actress during the late 1980s, appearing in films such as âDaddyâ and âPretty Smartâ. She would gain a bit of recognition after she became a part of âA Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriorsâ, with Robert Englund reprising the iconic Freddy Krueger. She was also set to appear in the fourth film but later cancelled due to her pregnancy. Her career continued with independent films such as âPrayer of the Rollerboysâ, âThe Indian Runnerâ and âInside Monkey Zetterlandâ. She had a notable performance in the mini-series âWildflowerâ, which earned her a few awards. She was then put into the spotlight through the film âTrue Romanceâ, in which she played the prostitute Alabama Whitman; the film and her performance became critically acclaimed. Afterwards, Patricia became a part of âEd Woodâ by Tim Burton, which was also well-received, portraying the girlfriend of Johnny Deppâs character in the film. Her work continued well into the late 90s with films including âFlirting with Disasterâ, âThe Secret Angelâ and âInfinityâ. Her net worth was rising steadily.\n\nIn 1997, Arquette started to focus on independent films such as âLost Highwayâ, and âVertigoâ. Her performances continued to attract great reviews from critics, though there were some stumbles here and there. Eventually, Patricia returned to the big screen in âStigmataâ which was a huge success at the box office, so she then became a part of Martin Scorseseâs âBringing out the Deadâ. In the 2000s, she became part of the films âHuman Natureâ, and âThe Badgeâ. She was also cast for Disneyâs âHolesâ and the independent film âDeeper than Deepâ, in which she portrayed pornographic actress Linda Lovelace.\n\nIn 2005, Arquette transitioned to television, and had a more consistent role in the show âMediumâ. She portrayed the psychic medium Allison DuBois and her performance would continue to rake in awards over the next few years. Around the same time, she also continued in films and voice work. In 2014, she was in the cast of the movie âBoyhoodâ which received universal praise and acclaim, and her performance was considered one of the best of her career, for which she won numerous awards. She is currently part of the show âCSI: Cyberâ which is another spin-off of the popular âCSIâ franchise.\n\nFor her personal life, it is known that Patricia had a relationship with musician Paul Rossi and they have a son. In 1995, she married actor Nicolas Cage though they separated after just nine months. Eventually they divorced in 2000 and two years later, Arquette became engaged to Thomas Jane. They married in 2006 and had a daughter, but divorced in 2011.\n\nï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿\n\nFull NamePatricia ArquetteNet Worth$24 MillionDate Of BirthApril 8, 1968Place Of BirthChicago, Illinois USAHeight5â² 2â³ (1.57 m)ProfessionActress, Director, ProducerEducationLos Angeles Center for Enriched StudiesNationalityAmericanSpouseThomas Jane (m. 2006â2011), Nicolas Cage (m. 1995â2001)ChildrenEnzo Rossi, Harlow Olivia Calliope JaneParentsLewis Arquette, Brenda DenautSiblingsRosanna Arquette Alexis Arquette Richmond Arquette David Arquette Cliff ArquetteFacebookhttp://www.facebook.com/pages/Patricia-Arquette/107988619229006Twitterhttps://twitter.com/PattyArquetteIMDBhttp://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000099AwardsEmmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama (2005),, BAFTA Award, Criticsâ Choice Award, Golden Globe Award, Independent Spirit Award, SAG Award for Best Supporting ActressNominationsGolden Globe, Emmy AwardMoviesâEd Woodâ, âBringing Out the Deadâ, âA Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriorsâ, âHuman Natureâ, âTrue Romanceâ (1993), âThe Badgeâ, âHolesâ, âDeeper than Deepâ, âBoyhoodâ (2014), âStigmataâ, âLost Highwayâ, âVertigoâ, âBringing out the Deadâ, âFâ¦TV ShowsâCSI: Cyberâ (2015-2016) , âCSIâ, âMediumâ (2005-2011)\n\nTitleSalaryMedium (2005)$225,000 /episode (2009-10)\n\nQuote1The business has changed in every way. Back in the day, when Vivien Leigh was cast as Scarlett OâHara, you know, she was relatively unknown, and every big star in the world wanted to do that part. Now they would just cast the biggest star. Financiers donât support their directors to cast properly. They donât have the vision of an artist, theyâre casting to spreadsheets and itâs making movies very mediocre. The movie business used to just be called the movies. Now it should be the business movies.2[on her vulnerable and melancholy rawness] Every man Iâve loved has tried to find it, fix it, soothe it.3[on her character in Boyhood shutting out her husbandâs abuse] Now, I wouldnât be like that. I would climb across the table and stab him in the head with a fork.4I donât have a goal but I just want to work on movies that I really like.5I donât read my reviews, but I have a bunch of them and I will when Iâm 80.6I find that men are far more vain than women.7I grew up in a hippie commune so I have a real hippie part of me.8Neither of us entered marriage thinking it wouldnât be a strain. Life has strains in it, and heâs the person I want to strain with.9We all have our own little thing, I think.10You want your partner to objectify you.11Hippy people had a hopeful idea of what they wanted the world to be like, then most of them changed into corporate Yuppies. But I still have that hippy thing underneath somewhere.12I liked the premise of this material. I love the marriage relationship. They kind of keep each other honest, and they enjoy each otherâs sense of humor. Kind of a sexy but boring relationship.13[commenting on her role as Allison DuBois in her TV series Medium (2005)] I wanted to play a woman who looks normal. Itâs important for me to be real.\n\nFact1If her acting career didnât work out, her other career desire was to go to college and become a midwife.2Co-founder of âGiveLove,â an organization dedicated to community-led sanitation projects in Haiti since the devastating earthquake of 2010.3Honored with Varietyâs Creative Impact in Cinema Award for her supporting actress role in the film Boyhood at the Texas Film Awards ceremony held on March 12, 2015 in Austin, Texas.4Considered for the role of Honey Bunny in Pulp Fiction.

Womenâs groups say that the only times they have seen more buzz around the topic of income disparity was when Lilly Ledbetter, the activist who sued Goodyear for paying her less than male counterparts, addressed the Democratic National Convention in 2008 and 2012, and when Barack Obama took up the mantle of equal pay in State of the Union address in 2015.9Is the first member of the Arquette family to receive (and ultimately win) an Oscar nomination.10Considered for the role of Dorothy Boyd in Jerry Maguire (1996).11Sister-in-law of Todd Morgan, Rosannaâs 4th husband.12Was set to reprise her role of Kristen Parker in A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master (1988) but was forced to decline because she became pregnant of her son Enzo Rossi.13Gave birth to her first child at age 20, a son Enzo Luciano Rossi (aka Enzo Rossi) on January 3, 1989.

Her father had French-Canadian, English, Swiss-German, German, Scottish, Irish, and Welsh ancestry.
