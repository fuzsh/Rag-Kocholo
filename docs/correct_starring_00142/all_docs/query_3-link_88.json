        "text": "Nicole Richie - 5â1â\n\nNicole Richie first found her fame when she and ex-BFF, party girl Paris Hilton, gave up their lavish lifestyles in turn for a more typical existence on their shared reality show, \"The Simple Life.\" On it, a 5â1â Richie pairs up with a 5â8â Hilton to do things like farming and plumbing. Now that's quite the duo.\n\nThe show focusing on the socialites ran for five years, but Richie moved on to bigger and better things, like playing the hilariously aloof news anchor on the hit comedy, \"Great News.\" The sitcom can be seen on the streaming platform Netflix.\n\nKourtney Kardashian - 5â0â\n\nKourtney may be the eldest Kardashian sister, but sheâs also the shortest. Standing at just five feet tall, she often relies on heels to bridge the height gap between her and some of her siblings, including Kendall Jenner, whoâs nearly 10 inches taller!\n\nLately, Kourtney has been devoting a lot of her time to her website, Poosh. On it, she posts a variety of lifestyle tips, blogs, and tricks, along with selling a variety of wellness products like matcha, kombucha, and more. One of her latest posts reveals how sheâs âbeen making the most of her time at home.â\n\nChandra Wilson - 5â0â\n\nYou may recognize Chandra Wilson from her role as Dr. Miranda Bailey on the hit medical series, \"Greyâs Anatomy\" â a part that has gotten her nominated for an Emmy not once, but four times! Wilson has been acting since the early 90s when she started work on stage. But her role on \"Grey's\" is surely the crowning jewel of her career.\n\nThe Houston-born actress is just 5â0â, but she has made some big waves in Hollywood. Her latest television appearance came in the form of an episode of \"Celebrity Wheel of Fortune,\" on which she appeared as herself. You could catch the show on Hulu if you missed it.\n\nJennifer Love Hewitt - 5â2â\n\nThe ever-adorable Jennifer Love Hewitt rose to fame in the late 90s and early 2000s on \"Party of Five,\" as well as a series of films, including the popular \"I What You Did Last Summer\" movies. She really was the ultimate scream queen for five minutes - and then she moved onto other things.\n\nSince then, the 5â2â actress has starred in a number of films and television shows, including her hit series \"Ghost Whisperer.\" Aside from being talented on-screen, she also has a great voice, which she has used to record a number of albums. She really is a jack of all trades.\n\nLady Gaga - 5â2â\n\nLady Gaga is now perhaps best well-known for her starring role in the award-winning \"A Star is Born,\" in which she played opposite Bradley Cooper. But before that, she emerged onto the music scene as a pop diva with her own twist on the industry â and fashion, especially.\n\nMaybe itâs due to the fact sheâs only 5â2â, but sheâs got a collection of sky-high boots, platforms, and heels, some of which are oddly shaped and seem like theyâd be impossible to walk in! The entertainer even has a documentary on Netflix thatâs called \"Gaga: Five Foot Two.\"\n\nLea Michele - 5â3â\n\nWe couldnât put together a list of the shortest women in Hollywood without including \"Glee\" star Lea Michele. Standing at just 5â3â, sheâs rightfully earned her spot on the list. The actress has been in the industry since she was a kid when she starred in several musicals on Broadway.\n\nBut everything changed for her once she got cast in the life-altering role on the hit Fox show. For her work as Rachel Berry, she earned a number of major nominations for Golden Globes and Emmys, along with winning four Peopleâs Choice Awards and so much more.\n\nSnooki - 4â8â\n\nReality star âSnooki,â also known as Nicole Polizzi, is best known for her stint on the \"Jersey Shore\" TV series. On the show, she and her other housemates ran around the city drinking, clubbing, and causing trouble. It is hard to think someone so tiny (she is just 4â8â) could be so rambunctious! And yet, she is!\n\nThese days, she has calmed down and, like many of her ex-castmates, now has children and leads a much quieter life. She and Jwoww, another Jersey girl on the series, now host a show of their own called \"Snooki & Jwoww.\" Isn't that awesome?\n\nReese Witherspoon - 5â1â\n\nReese Witherspoon holds a lot of talent in a little frame. At 5â1â, the star rose to fame around the late â90s to early 2000s, when she played in the steamy drama, \"Cruel Intentions,\" as well as starring as sorority girl turned skilled attorney Elle Woods in the hit comedy \"Legally Blonde.\"\n\nShe made Time magazineâs list of the most influential people in the world twice, in 2006 and again in 2015. Sheâs been nominated for several prestigious awards, including two Oscars and seven Golden Globes, and has recently been putting her energy into the Draper James Loves Teachers initiative.\n\nSalma Hayek - 5â2â\n\nThe gorgeous Salma Hayek is just 5â2â, but her body has been given its own TV show for how incredible it is â no, seriously. The actress recently announced a new project on HBO in which she plays a 40-year-old woman with a (very) special power.\n\nThe talented actress has no problems making an audience laugh, something she provided in 1997 when she appeared and was nominated for an award in the flick \"Fools Rush In.\" After that, she continued to impress with her wide range of talents that she displayed in everything from \"Dogma\" to \"Frida\" and so much more.\n\nSharon Osbourne - 5â2â\n\nRockstar wife and TV personality Sharon Osbourne may only be 5â2â, but you still would not want to get on her bad side! The wife of Ozzy first came into the public eye on the reality show based on her family life, \"The Osbournes.\"\n\nAfter the world fell in love with her as much as her heavy metal-singing husband, she started to get TV deals of her own. One such role was the host of \"Rock of Love: Charm School.\" After the show, she found herself in some hot water after a sleazy contestant warranted a beatdown live on TV.\n\nPaula Abdul - 5â0â\n\nSinger, songwriter, and TV personality Paula Abdul stands at just 5â0â tall â which is why in many cases, you can catch her wearing a great big pair of heels. Abdul was discovered by The Jacksons when she was working as a Laker Girl. And she never looked back.\n\nHer fame snowballed from that point on, beginning with a series of albums that landed her six number-one singles on the Billboard Hot 100. Since then, sheâs appeared as a judge on a number of hit musical reality shows, including as one of the original \"American Idol\" judges from 2002-2009.\n\nJada Pinkett Smith - 5â0â\n\nThe beautiful Jada Pinkett Smith began her rise to fame in the 90s when she appeared in a number of major films, including playing opposite Eddie Murphy in 1996âs \"The Nutty Professor.\" Since making her motion picture debut, sheâs been in over 20 feature films.\n\nPlus, the 5â0â actress now has a couple more credits to her name in the form of her talented children, Jaden and Willow, whoâve taken the entertainment world by storm as well. Sheâs become a champion of minority filmmakers, which she put to use in 2020âs \"Charm City Kings.\"\n\nAriana Grande - 5â3â\n\nDepending on your age, you may or may not know just how iconic pop singer Ariana Grande really is for her time. The star began her career on Broadway and got launched to fame after landing her breakthrough role on the Nickelodeon series \"Victorious.\" And she has only gotten more iconic with each passing year.\n\nThe entertainer stands at 5â3â but has no problem rocking sky-high boots while she performs her hits on stage for several thousands of her millions of screaming fans. Her work has garnered a number of awards, including two Grammy awards and two Billboard Music accolades.\n\nLucy Liu - 5â3â\n\nYou may recognize 5â3â actress Lucy Liu from her work in one of many major motion pictures such as \"Kill Bill: Volume 1,\" \"Charlieâs Angels,\" or \"Chicago.\" In true fated fashion, the star was discovered by an agent on the subway at 19 and started her career with commercial work.\n\nLucy Liu is very involved in activism of different types and is a big advocate for same-sex marriage, among other noble causes. The actress is also a single mother (by choice) and works to change the outlook on the typical idea of how a family has to look.\n\nKristin Chenoweth - 4â11â\n\nAnd we are back down in the 4â0â range to meet with entertainer Kristin Chenoweth, who stands at just 4â11â with bare feet. Like many of the talented women on our list, Chenoweth packs a powerful punch in a little package, to say the very least.\n\nThe singer and actress started her career in musical theater before transitioning into on-screen work. She appeared in several hits like \"Glee,\" \"Bewitched,\" and \"RV\" in 2006. Her latest project came in the form of 2020âs \"Holidate,\" starring Emma Roberts. In it, she plays quirky Aunt Susan, who has no intentions of settling down!\n\nAlyssa Milano - 5â2â\n\nThe adorable Alyssa Milano is perhaps most well-known for her starring role as Phoebe Halliwell, one of three magical siblings, on the hit series \"Charmed.\" On the show, she is the sister of two other witches who form a powerful trio capable of defeating all sorts of evil â 5â2â height be damned!\n\nMilano has also used her celebrity powers in real life to become a face of the #MeToo movement thatâs taken over social media. Aside from \"Charmed,\" you can catch her in shows like \"My Name is Earl\" and \"Whoâs the Boss?\" It's amazing to think she has been around for more than 40 years!\n\nLil' Kim - 4â11â\n\nLilâ Kim is the only female rapper to have an album rated five out of five mics by \"The Source\" â an honor which occurred when she was serving a year-long prison sentence for covering up for a friend in court.\n\nStanding at 4â11â, the entertainer has sold more than 15 million albums and 30 million singles throughout the world since the start of her career. Aside from her success in music, the star has also appeared in a number of television shows, including \"Dancing with the Stars,\" \"Pussycat Dolls Present: The Search for the Next Doll\" (and later, \"Girlicious.\")\n\nKim Kardashian - 5â2â\n\nSocialite and businesswoman Kim Kardashian first rose to fame alongside former party girl and friend Paris Hilton. Her father was Robert Kardashian, the infamous attorney who defended friend and client O. J. Simpson.\n\nShe now has more than 200 million followers on Instagram, along with a successful line of makeup products. She and her other family members have also famously been involved in their own reality show, \"Keeping up with the Kardashians,\" a show that ran for 20 seasons and aired its final first-run episode in late 2021. Of course, Kim ended up having one of the most highly-publicized marriages in recent memory, to the eccentric musical genius that is Kanye West.\n\nLena Dunham - 5â3â\n\nLena Dunham is best known for her work on HBOâs series, \"Girls,\" which she created, wrote, and starred in for five years from 2012-1017. Her work on the show earned her two Golden Globe awards and multiple Emmy nominations. \"Time\" named the 5â3â powerhouse one of the most influential people in the world in 2013, a title which she continues to work to earn today.\n\nIn 2019, she launched her own production company called Good Thing Going, and the following year, she announced multiple projects, including working as the executive producer on a number of productions for HBO.\n\nVanessa Hudgens - 5â1â\n\nVanessa Hudgens rose to fame as a Disney star in the popular \"High School Musical\" series, which she starred in with Zac Efron. The two had a lot of chemistry on set, which translated to a five-year-long relationship off-screen as well. The talented actress has appeared in a number of productions, from live on stage to major motion pictures.\n\nShe infamously starred in the divisive movie \"Spring Breakers\" and in 2019, she took her talent behind the camera and worked as executive producer (and starred in) the Netflix original film, \"The Knight Before Christmas.\" Then, in 2020, she starred in the third installment of the \"Bad Boys\" franchise.\n\nChristina Aguilera - 5â2â\n\nWhen you hear Christina Aguilera deliver a powerful vocal performance on stage, itâs hard to believe sheâs just 5â2â. The singer took over the industry when she arrived on the scene with her hit, \"Genie in a Bottle,\" a single for which she earned a Grammy Award for Best New Artist.\n\nOf course, the fame wasnât anything new to her since sheâd been performing since 1993 when she joined fellow future superstars Britney Spears and Justin Timberlake on Disneyâs \"The Mickey Mouse Club.\" She most recently worked as a judge on the hit music show, \"The Voice,\" which scouts new megastars.\n\nEmma Roberts - 5â2â\n\nActress Emma Roberts comes from a family of talented entertainers. Just ask her aunt, the incredible Julia Roberts. Her dad is also a talented actor as well. They may share their love and skills for acting, but when it comes to height, theyâre nowhere close. Julia stands at 5â9â, while her niece comes in at just 5â2.â\n\nEmmaâs made quite a name for herself in the industry, where she continues to display her wide range. Sheâs appeared in shows like \"American Horror Story\" and \"Scream Queens,\" as well as films, including the recent romantic comedy, \"Holidate.\"\n\nEva Longoria - 5â2â\n\nEva Longoria met an executive producer at a political reception in 1999, and not long after, she guest-starred in an episode of \"Beverly Hills, 90210.\" The 5â2â star moved on to a regular role on the soap opera series \"The Young and the Restless.\" That led to her starring role on the long-running TV show \"Desperate Housewives,\" for which sheâs most well-known.\n\nBesides her work on camera, sheâs also done some directing, including an episode of \"Jane the Virgin,\" three episodes of \"Black-ish,\" and two episodes of \"The Mick.\" Longoria has been nominated for a number of awards as an actress.\n\nNicki Minaj - 5â2â\n\nFemale rapper Nicki Minaj is another perfect example of big things that come in small packages. The star stands at 5â2â, but she has a big impact on her fans and the hip-hop world at large. Not to mention the fact she is one of the best female lyricists out there. She took the industry by storm when she appeared on the scene with her unique style of performing.\n\nShe has won several awards throughout the course of her career, including twelve BET Awards, eight BET Hip Hop Awards, and nine American Music Awards, just to name a few. Since rising to superstardom, she now earns money through a variety of brand collaborations.\n\nAmy Poehler - 5â2â\n\nFunny woman Amy Poehler is a multi-talented entertainer who became famous for her work on SNL and for her starring role as Leslie Knope in NBCâs \"Parks and Recreation.\" That role really took her fame to another stratosphere.

She reprised her aforementioned role in \"Scream VI,\" which came out in 2023.\n\nShakira - 5â2â\n\nThis sultry Columbian singer may be just 5â2â, but her bodyâs so powerful she delivered an award-winning song about them in the form of her pop hit, \"Hips Donât Lie.\" Sheâs often been referred to as the Queen of Latin Music, thanks to her many worldwide number-one singles.\n\nIn 2020, she performed with fellow superstar Jennifer Lopez at the Superbowl halftime show, which brought in more than 100 million views! Since mid-2020, sheâs appeared to perform on a number of shows, including \"The Disney Family Singalong: Volume II.\" Shakira's love life took the forefront in more recent times, with her highly publicized marriage to Gerard Pique coming to a tragic end.\n\nIsla Fisher - 5â3â\n\nYou may recognize Isla Fisher from her many roles in major films like \"Wedding Crashers,\" \"Confessions of a Shopaholic,\" and \"Now You See Me,\" just to name a few.

In 2005, she was diagnosed with breast cancer and had since become a champion for the cause, inspiring women all over the world with her perseverance.\n\nMary Kate Olsen - 5â2â\n\nThe Olsen Twins (known singularly as Mary Kate and Ashley) got launched to stardom before they even had any clue what was happening to them when they were just babies. That leads to the fact that Mary Kate, 5â2â, and her sister, Ashley, who stands at 5â1â, do everything they can to avoid the spotlight as adults.\n\nThey were working with big TV stars like John Stamos and Bob Saget from basically day one! You wonât catch them on-screen if they can help it â and they usually can. MK remains successful from behind the scenes, thanks to a keen fashion sense and the line of apparel that she launched with her sister.\n\nKristen Bell - 5â1â\n\nIf youâve ever watched Kristen Bell kick butt in the title role in \"Veronica Mars,\" you may find it hard to believe that she is only just over five feet tall.

Duff was the star of the short-lived reboot to \"How I Met Your Mother,\" aptly titled \"How I Met Your Father.\"\n\nScarlett Johansson - 5â3â\n\nPretty much anywhere you looked between 2000-2020, you would see a major motion picture poster with Scarlett Johansson's (ScarJo)âs face on it. The leading lady landed role after role in hits like \"The Black Dahlia,\" \"Girl with a Pearl Earring,\" \"Heâs Just Not That Into You,\" \"Lucy,\" \"Ghost in the Shell,\" and of course, various Marvel films as Natasha Romanoff, AKA Black Widow.\n\nShe was the highest-paid actress two years running, in 2018 and 2019, pulling in more than $55 million from June â18 to June â19. The actress may stand at 5â3â, but she makes big waves in entertainment.\n\nAmerica Ferrera - 5â1â\n\nAmerica Ferrera has had a huge impact on the world, thanks to playing powerful starring roles like the hit series \"Ugly Betty.\" For her work as Betty Suarez on the show, she earned several prestigious awards, including the Best Actress Award at the 2007 Golden Globes and Screen Actors Guild Awards, along with a Primetime Emmy.\n\nHer Emmy made her the first Latin woman to win that title. The same year she won all of those awards; \"Time\" magazine called the 5â1â star one of the 100 most influential people in the world. Ferrera reached new heights when she starred alongside Margot Robbie in the most successful movie of 2023 - \"Barbie.\"\n\nZoÃ« Kravitz - 5â2â\n\nAlthough ZoÃ« Kravitz was born into an insanely talented and famous family, thanks to parents Lenny Kravitz and Lisa Bonet, sheâs made a name for herself in the industry solely based on her own talent. The 5â2â actress made her film debut in 2007 and has since played in several major productions, including \"Dope,\" \"Gemini,\" and \"High Fidelity.\"\n\nThe multi-talented star also has a great voice (I wonder why,) which sheâs used for both voice-acting and recording her own music. Kravitz voiced Catwoman in \"The Lego Batman Movie\" and is now set to play her in 2022âs live-action film, \"The Batman.\"\n\nRachel Bilson - 5â3â\n\nRachel Bilson is proof that you donât have to stand tall to reach the stars. The actress is just 5â2â but has created a nice career for herself in the world of entertainment. The California girl was born in Los Angeles and made her TV debut in 2003. Three years later, she appeared in her first film, \"The Last Kiss.\"\n\nBilson also has an eye for fashion, which sheâs put to good use to team up with DKNY to create the Edie Rose fashion line. Sheâs also collaborated with her designer to launch ShoeMint, which provides a customized, virtual shoe-shopping experience.\n\nLucy Hale - 5â2â\n\nLucy Hale is most well recognized for her starring role in \"Pretty Little Liars,\" a fitting title to launch the 5â2â actress to fame in Hollywood. Sheâs appeared in several films and TV shows, including The Sisterhood of the \"Traveling Pants 2\" and \"Scream 4.\"\n\nIn 2020, she starred in the supernatural Blumhouse horror film \"Fantasy Island,\" which saw enormous box office success despite the fact it opened to collectively horrible reviews. Hale has also dabbled in music and released her own studio album called \"Road Between\" in 2014. She also had a minor role as Robin's sister in \"How I Met Your Mother.\"\n\nMaisie Williams - 5â1â\n\nMaisie Williamsâ acting career really got its start when she landed a starring role in HBOâs hit series, 'Game of Thrones.\" For her work on the show, sheâs received a wave of critical praise and award nominations, including two Primetime Emmy Award nominations for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series.\n\nThe actress, who stands at just 5â1â, starred in her first feature film in 2014 and proved her talent and skills on the screen once again. Several years later, she launched the social media platform and networking app Daisie, which works to connect artists and creators.\n\nEmilia Clarke - 5â2â\n\nAnother famous face that was launched to fame on \"Game of Thrones\" is 5â2â star Emilia Clarke, who plays Daenerys, AKA the Mother of Dragons, which would turn her into an icon. Her work as Daenerys got her nominated for four Primetime Emmys, among a number of other notable accolades. Although she is also short in show, she is the mother of Dragons - be warned!\n\nClarke lives in London and has been recognized for more than just her acting skills. In 2014 and 2015, when she was featured on a number of âsexiest womenâ lists. Then, in 2017, \"Glamour\" named her one of the best-dressed women.\n\nAnna Kendrick - 5â2â\n\nAnna Kendrick is no stranger to the world of entertainment. In fact, she first started acting when she was a kid, and her first real role was in 1998âs Broadway production of \"High Society.\" A few years later, she appeared on-screen, and afterward, her success snowballed, especially with the help of her role in the popular \"Pitch Perfect\" film series.\n\nAnna may be just 5â2â, but sheâs known for her big personality and killer voice, well, along with her range of abilities as an actress. Most recently, she voiced Poppy in 2020âs \"Trolls World Tour,\" along with HBO Maxâs \"Love Life.\"\n\nAshley Olsen - 5â1â\n\nAshley Olsen and her sister, Mary Kate, were famous before they could talk. But one thing they did do on set was cry â a lot â at least, according to fellow former \"Full House\" star John Stamos, who tried to have them replaced.\n\nThese days, the sisters shy away from cameras, and we only see glimpses of them as they make their way to and from fashion shows. The twins celebrated their 34th birthday in 2020, and the pair haven't slowed down since. And of course, their sister Elizabeth Olsen has also hit the dizzy heights of Hollywood, starring as the Scarlet Witch in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n\nAnnaSophia Robb - 5â0â\n\nThe adorable 5â0â AnnaSophia Robb is most well-known for playing the lead role of Carrie Bradshaw on the CWâs \"The Carrie Diaries.\" Then, she took on the part of Lacey, Gypsy Blanchardâs neighbor on Huluâs original miniseries, \"The Act.\"\n\nShe has appeared in multiple films. These include the likes of \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,\" \"Race to Witch Mountain,\" \"Soul Surfer,\" and \"The Crash.\" She got the huge honor of playing the role of Anne Lansky in the biographical film about Meyer Lansky, a gangster known as the âMobâs Accountant.â When you're working alongside legends like Harvey Keitel, you know you're doing something right.\n\nRooney Mara - 5â3â\n\nRooney Mara makes our list coming in at the height of just 5â3â. But she doesnât need those extra inches, as sheâs created a successful career in entertainment since her first acting role in 2009.\n\nThe following year, she appeared in the hit drama \"The Social Network,\" which tells the tale of the truth behind the creation of social media giant Facebook. But in 2011, she really broke through in the industry when she landed the leading part in \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.\" She and fellow star Joaquin Phoenix have been romantically involved since 2016.\n\nNatalie Portman - 5â3â\n\nThe talented Israeli-born Natalie Portman can be seen starring in an array of powerful major productions like the eye-opening dystopian thriller \"V for Vendetta\" and other films, including \"Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace,\" and 2011âs \"No Strings Attached.\"\n\nThe 5â3â entertainer was the first person ever born in the 80s to win the Academy Award for Best Actress, a title she took home for her work in \"Black Swan.\" Portman also has skills behind the camera, which sheâs used in directing a few of her own films, including \"A Tale for Love and Darkness\" in 2015.\n\nMila Kunis - 5â2â\n\nMila Kunis is a huge star today, though the 5â2â actress had to bend the rules a little bit to get her big break. When she auditioned for her breakthrough role as Jackie on the hit comedy series \"That â70s Show,\" she told producers she would be turning 18 since they required all actresses to be of age.\n\nBut she didnât tell them that it would be four more years until that birthday, so she got the job at just 14 years old. Now, sheâs got a recurring voice role as Meg on \"Family Guy\" and acted in countless major films.\n\nJessica Simpson - 5â2â\n\nSinger Jessica Simpson got so comfortable wearing high-heels to boost up her 5â2â stature that sheâs designed a successful line of shoes â among other apparel and gear, which she sells on her own website.\n\nHer products can also be seen in huge stores like DSW and Dillards. She rose to fame around the same time she was in a heavy relationship (and later, marriage) with a fellow singer Nick Lachey. She also had a number of hits herself, including \"Irresistible.\" Aside from her music, sheâs acted in multiple productions, which include playing Daisy Duke in the \"Dukes of Hazzard\" film in 2005.\n\nMegan Fox - 5â4â\n\nBombshell Megan Fox hit the scene in her debut film, \"Holiday in the Sun,\" in 2001. Afterward, she continued to pick up roles in hits like Hope & Faith, Confessions of a \"Teenage Drama Queen,\" and, of course, a couple of titles in the \"Transformers\" film series.\n\nAlthough sheâs on the taller end of the spectrum versus most of the women on our list, sheâs still short in terms of Hollywood standards, standing at just 5â4â. Sheâs widely regarded as a femme fatal, a role which sheâs happily taken by the horns and displayed in magazines like \"Maxim.\"\n\nDakota Fanning - 5â4â\n\nCan you believe that Dakota Fanning has been getting nominated for prestigious acting awards in Hollywood since she was just eight years old? Sheâs the youngest person in history to have been up for a Screen Actors Guild Award, an accolade which she received for her work in 2001âs \"I Am Sam.\"\n\nAfterward, she continued to impress, from her childhood, in tear-jerking films like \"Man on Fire,\" and now the 26-year-old, 5â4â Dakota is still getting nominated for SAGs! Of course, Dakota's sister, Elle Fanning, is also a talented actress who has been extremely successful. Like her sister, she's also pretty short.\n\nLily-Rose Depp - 5â3â\n\nOf course, the 5â3â Lily-Rose Depp would be absolutely gorgeous when she has parents like superstar Johnny Depp and French singer and model Vanessa Paradis.\n\nShe got into acting herself with a short role in the disturbing film \"Tusk\" and has since been nominated for and won a number of awards for her skills on screen, including Best Actress at the 4th Los Angeles Film Awards in 2019. Depp ended up stepping into her father's footsteps, getting the lead role in her very own HBO series, \"The Idol.\" However, due to its divisive reception, the show ended up getting canceled.\n\nLisa Bonet - 5â2â\n\nIf youâve ever wondered where actress ZoÃ« Kravitz gets her stunning beauty, look no further than her mother, Lisa Bonet. Of course, her dad Lenny Kravitz might also have something to do with her looks. Lisa Bonet first became known as Denise Huxtable in 1984âs âThe Cosby Show.â\n\nShe then landed roles in âAngel Heart,â alongside Robert De Niro and Micky Rourke, the hit TV series âA Different World,â and others. Even though sheâs been out of the spotlight for the last few years, sheâs definitely been keeping busy at home with ex-hubby Jason Momoa and their two beautiful children.\n\nRashida Jones - 5â4â\n\nDaughter of legendary record producer Quincy Jones and actress Peggy Lipton, Rashida Jones has proven she has incredible talent on her own. With such a high-profile lineage, and such talent in her own right, this woman doesn't really need to tower over anyone to be noticed. Mostly starring in comedies, Jones has played hilarious characters in âThe Office,â âParks and Recreation,â âBlack-ish,â and âBoston Public.â\n\nBut this petite 5â4â actress hasnât stopped at TV â sheâs also starred in Hollywood films like âOur Idiot Brother,â âI Love You, Man,â âLittle Black Book,â âCop Out,â âInside Out,â and dozens of others.\n\nVictoria Beckham - 5â4â\n\nEx-Spice Girl and current fashion designer Victoria Beckham has impressively managed to remain in the spotlight for over two decades. And she didn't need to be a head taller than anyone else to do that. First for being Posh Spice in the 90s, then for marrying the legendary David Beckham, and ultimately for having her own boutique clothing line.\n\nWe usually see this brunette beauty in very high heels, but sheâs actually 5â4â! Regardless, her petite figure and elegant demeanor perfectly fit her stature. There is nothing that could make Posh Spice look anything other than astonishingly glamorous.\n\nJessica Chastain - 5â4â\n\nApart from being a jaw-droppingly gorgeous redhead, Jessica Chastain is also an incredible actress. She became widely known after portraying Celia Foote in 2011âs âThe Help,â and since then, itâs been all gravy for the California native.\n\nChastain has starred in âInterstellar,â âMollyâs Game,â âIt: Chapter Two,â âMiss Sloane,â and most recently in her award-winning performance as Tammy Faye in âThe Eyes of Tammy Faye.â With such a big on-screen presence, who would have guessed that this impressive woman is only 5â4â? Though, honestly, giving this woman a tall stature as well would have been kind of unfair to the rest of us, mortals.\n\nAmanda Seyfried - 5â3â\n\nThe blonde, and short (sheâs 5â3â!), actress Amanda Seyfried rose to fame after playing Karen Smith, one of Regina Georgeâs friends in âMean Girls,â who was too dumb to understand how dumb she really was. Afterward, she starred in âMamma Mia!â alongside Meryl Streep, Pierce Brosnan, and other A-listers. Her character there was quite an improvement in terms of intelligence.\n\nPerhaps some of her best work was her portrayal of the infamous Elizabeth Holmes in the hit Hulu series âThe Dropoutâ in 2022. Her work in the series earned her an Emmy Award for Best Leading Actress in a Limited Series.\n\nJenna Ortega - 5â1â\n\nNowadays, it seems that young actress Jenna Ortega is everywhere â starring in the hit âAddamsâ Familyâ spinoff series âWednesday,â playing a scream queen in horror hits like âX,â âScream,â âScream VI,â and countless others. Her miniature figure was especially highlighted when she played alongside her \"Wednesday\" castmate Gwendoline Christie, who stands at 6â² 3â³!\n\nBut before she was a big Hollywood star, this petite 5â1â California native was performing roles in Disney specials like âStuck in the Middleâ and The CW comedy series âJane the Virgin.â It seems this versatile young woman can do it all â comedies, horrors, dramas; you name it.\n\nAshley Benson - 5'0\"\n\nThe fact that Ashley Benson is 5â0â and has had such a successful career as a model is admirable. Breaking the mold for what are usually super tall women, Benson signed with Ford Models Agency when she was only eight years old. (To be fair, though, at that age they couldn't have known how tall she would grow up to be.) Sheâs also a jazz, ballet, and hip-hop dancer.\n\nAs for the screen, Benson landed a role in âPretty Little Liarsâ as Hanna Marin. Quite literal with the \"little,\" don't you think? Anyway, the role earned her several awards and nominations. Good on her!\n\nSarah Hyland - 5'2\"\n\nThe 5â2â brunette beauty Sarah Hyland first started acting in small roles in movies like âBlind Date,â âAnnie,â and âPrivate Parts.â However, it was in 2009 that she got her big break after being cast as Haley Dunphy in the hit sitcom âModern Family.â And the rest was history.\n\nThe show lasted nine seasons, which means that the talented actress really grew up on camera and took us all on that journey. This show has earned Hyland four Screen Actors Guild Awards and a nomination for the Criticsâ Choice TV Award. Most recently, you can see her in the 2022 âPitch Perfectâ film.\n\nMadonna - 5'4\"\n\nSheâs been idolized, she's been criticized, and she's been everything in between, but she is and always will be the original Queen of Pop. Singer and songwriter Madonna has been one of the most famous and influential music stars of our time, and the woman is a small 5â4â! Guess it doesn't really matter that much when you're standing on the biggest stages in the world.\n\nThis âMaterial Girlâ has seen it all â the top of the charts, huge controversy for her personal opinions, divorces, love stories, and more. But at over 60, sheâs still rocking the world.\n\nRachel McAdams - 5'4\"\n\nCanadian actress Rachel McAdams first broke out on the screen in the 2002 movie âPerfect Pie.â But it wasnât until 2004 that this brilliant, petite, 5â4â beauty captured all our hearts in âThe Notebook.â McAdams went on to star in big Hollywood films like âMean Girls,â âWedding Crashers,â âSouthpaw,â âSherlock Holmes,â âMidnight in Paris,â and many more.\n\nSheâs certainly earned her spotlight, along with several awards and nominations. We canât wait to see what this gorgeous actress has in store next. Whether it is in high heels or in flats, we are sure it is going to be great to watch.\n\nFreema Agyeman - 5'1Â½\"\n\nSci-fi fans will probably be more familiar with this face than other people might be. British actress Freema Agyeman made her acting debut by portraying Martha Jones in the hit BBC series âDoctor Who.â Soon after, she was cast as Alesha Phillips in the hit crime show âLaw & Order: UK,â and itâs been solid work for the gorgeous actress ever since. This British beauty might be 5â1Â½, but her beauty and acting skills are enough to knock anybody off their feet.\n\nAgyeman has also played Amanita Caplan in the hit sci-fi series âSense8,â and, most recently, in 2023, Dr. Helen Sharpe in the medical drama âNew Amsterdam.â\n\nJhene Aiko - 5'1Â½\"\n\nJhene Aiko rose to fame in 2002 after singing and acting in music videos for B2K, a popular R&B group. Her beautiful voice and poetic lyrics have made her a star in the industry, and this diva is a mere 5â1Â½â. Aiko also branched out to the silver screen with roles in big movies like âCreedâ and âCreed II.â\n\nBranching out into the soundtrack business, she also wrote the score for the animated film âRaya and the Last Dragonâ in 2021. Aiko was previously married to American record producer Dot da Genius, who also helped to advance her career.\n\nDebbie Allen - 5'2\"\n\nDebbie Allen is a well-known actress, choreographer, singer, director, and dancer thatâs had a successful career for over four decades. She was even appointed a member of the Presidentâs Committee on the Arts and Humanities.\n\nAllen made her acting debut in the sitcom âA Different Worldâ in 1987. Those of you who haven't been around then might remember her from one of her more recent roles â she also played Catherine Avery in âGreyâs Anatomyâ for several seasons, and not once was it obvious that this powerhouse of a woman is just 5â2â. Her presence on camera is just that big.\n\nLily Allen - 5â2â\n\nEnglish singer Lily Allen comes from a family of entertainers, so it wasnât so surprising when she broke out on the music scene in 1998. Her father was an actor, and her mother a film producer, so Lily knew her way around Hollywood. (Her brother, actor Alfie Allen of \"Game of Thrones\" fame, is also in show business, but he went into this industry several years after his sister.)\n\nThe 5â2â vocal goddess really started her career in 2005 after posting some of her songs on MySpace. It turns out that BBC Radio picked up the song, and the rest, as they say, is history.\n\nPatricia Arquette - 5'1Â½\"\n\nMost recently, you can see the beautiful blonde, blue-eyed Patricia Arquette in a starring role in the TV series âSeverance.â But her role in that show would never have you guessing how tall she really is. As always, her performance in whatever she's doing is impeccable, and it should be, considering sheâs been around since the 1980s. Her roles in âEd Wood,â âBoyhood,â âBoardwalk Empire,â âTrue Romance,â and âMediumâ have earned her A-list celebrity status.\n\nWhatâs not very tall is her actual status â since the gorgeous Arquette measures 5â1Â½â. A small detail in this brilliant actressâs resume.\n\nAwkwafina - 5'1\"\n\nActress and rapper Awkwafina rose to fame after a song of hers went viral on YouTube in 2012. This native New Yorker, born Nora Lum, adopted the moniker Awkwafina and went on to play supporting roles alongside some of Hollywoodâs biggest stars. Sheâs acted in âOceanâs 8,â âThe Farewell,â and âCrazy Rich Asians.â She's even done some voice acting, dubbing Sisu in the Disney hit \"Raya and the Last Dragon.\"\n\nMost recently, she wrote, produced, and starred in the hit comedy series âAwkwafina is Nora From Queens,â in which itâs clear to see this talented woman is a bit petite. Her 5â1â height hasnât kept her away from the spotlight, though.\n\nErykah Badu - 5â0â\n\nMusical goddess Erykah Badu broke out on the scene after her first album, âBaduizm,â came out in 1997. It was certified triple platinum, and Badu has seen nothing but fame and success since then. She writes, sings, and produces her own albums and those of other musicians. Born in Texas in 1971, she and her two siblings were raised by a single mother, which she still constantly honors on social media.\n\nBadu has also had her share of silver screen success, with roles in âThe Cider House Rulesâ in 1999 and âBlues Brothers 2000â in 1998. Erykah may be 5â0â, but she has the talent and heart of a giant.\n\nFairuza Balk - 5'2\"\n\nAfter her breakthrough role in 1996âs âThe Craft,â California-born Fairuza Balk has steadily climbed the fame ladder. Coming from a family of entertainers, it is not surprising she pursued acting; her father was a traveling musician, and her mother was a belly dancer. Neither of her parents was particularly tall, which makes sense considering she stands at a mere 5â2â.\n\nFairuza (which means âTurquoiseâ in Farsi. The name makes perfect sense when you look at her eyes) has starred in several box-office hits, including a groupie in âAlmost Famous,â a girlfriend in âThe Waterboyâ and âAmerican History X,â and Heidi in âBad Lieutenant,â among dozens of others.\n\nPat Benatar - 5â0â\n\nAmerican singer and songwriter Pat Benatar has been rocking stages worldwide since 1972. With a career thatâs spanned over 30 years, Benatar has certainly made her mark in the music industry. In 1982, she married fellow musician Neil Giraldo, with whom she has two children. Judging by this picture, Giraldo is about a head taller than his wife, meaning their kids could have taken after either of them in terms of height.\n\nSince her 1980s hit âHit Me with Your Best Shot,â this rockstar has been topping charts, and the fact that sheâs only 5â0â hasnât stopped her one bit.\n\nNikki Blonsky - 4'10\"\n\nDefinitely one of the shortest leading ladies on our list, Nikki Blonsky may be 4â10â, but that hasnât kept her from having a successful career as an actress, dancer, singer, and media personality. Her debut gig was playing the role of Tracy Turnblad in the 2007 film âHairspray.â Though, granted, when she acted in that movie, she was sporting 60s-style beehive hair that gave her a few more inches.\n\nThe talented Blonsky received a Golden Globe award for her performance, which logically secured her a role in many future projects, including âUgly Bettyâ and âThe Last Movie Star.â\n\nAlex Borstein - 5â0â\n\nChicago-native comedienne and actress Alex Borstein made a name for herself by voicing Lois from the hit animated series âFamily Guy.â Since then, Borstein has become a Hollywood staple and a respected comedienne in the industry.\n\nBorstein may be shorter than average, with a height of 5â0â, but her talent and sense of humor are as tall as youâll get. Nowadays, you can catch Alex in the famous show âThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,â where she plays the rough yet soulful talent manager Susie Myerson who is also a one-of-a-kind friend to the titular Mrs. Maisel, played by Rachel Brosnahan.\n\nAbigail Breslin - 5â1â\n\nThe fantastic Abigail Breslin first appeared on screen in the hit horror film âSigns,â as Mel Gibsonâs daughter in 2002. But it wasnât until her role as Olive in 2006âs âLittle Miss Sunshineâ that she really earned her place in Hollywood. She was barely ten years old, and her performance was so amazing that she quickly skyrocketed to the big leagues.\n\nThis Academy-Award nominee might be 5â1â, but her career is rising non-stop. If you havenât seen her in 2021âs âStillwaterâ or the series âScream Queens,â we strongly suggest you go to your nearest Netflix right about now.\n\nEmily Browning - 5â1â\n\nAt 5â1â, Australian actress Emily Browning doesnât exactly have supermodel height, but she definitely has enough talent to make it not matter. Born in Melbourne in 1988, Emily started her acting career in a somewhat unusual way.\n\nAs it turns out, she was starring in a school play, and a classmateâs father noticed her skills. Little to no time after that, Browning got her first audition. How cool is that? Being discovered without even trying? Sign us up, please! Since then, sheâs starred in âSleeping Beauty,â âLegend,â âThe Affair,â âA Series of Unfortunate Events,â and a myriad of other very successful projects.\n\nLogan Browning - 5â1â\n\nEverybody remembers the first time they saw the jaw-droppingly gorgeous Logan Browning as the radio DJ in âDear White People.â But before the hit show came out in 2017, Browning had her share of silver screen exposure in the movie âBratzâ in 2007. After all, it doesn't get any more life-like Sasha than her.\n\nAs petite as this Atlanta native looks on screen, measuring 5â1â, sheâs proved her talent time and time again. Most recently, she starred alongside actress Allison Williams in âPerfection.â Browning has also directed and produced movies of her own. Is there anything this woman canât do?\n\nCandace Cameron Bure - 5â2â\n\nFrom 1987 to 1995, the bright-eyed actress Candace Cameron Bure played the lovable DJ Tanner in âFull House.â She recently reprised that role when she starred in the series reboot, âFuller House,â and has appeared in some rom-coms and Hallmark films over the last few years.\n\nThis 5â2â blonde babe was born into an entertainment family in Los Angeles. In fact, you might remember her brother, Kirk Cameron, from his days of playing Mike Seaver in âGrowing Pains.â Other than acting, some of her other passions include fitness, religion, and advocating for various political causes that she believes in.\n\nHelena Bonham Carter - 5â2â\n\nNo introduction is needed for British actress Helena Bonham Carter since sheâs been in major blockbusters like âFight Club,â âSweeney Todd,â âAlice in Wonderland,â and dozens more. Also, she was Tim Burtonâs wife for 13 years, which was a perfect match between two goth geniuses. Fans of the Harry Potter films will also remember her as a perfectly maniacal Bellatrix Lestrange.\n\nThe two-time Oscar nominee might be 5â2â, but her career is anything but small. Most recently, Carter has been in the hit show âThe Crownâ and âEnola Holmes.â We canât wait to see what this interesting woman does next!\n\nLacey Chabert - 5â2â\n\nSome of you might remember Lacey Chabert for her role as Erica Kaneâs daughter in the hit TV show âAll My Children.â And for those that donât, theyâll surely remember Gretchen from âMean Girls.â Lacey has been acting for quite a while, starting her career as a child. Chabert was interested in acting and dancing from a very young age and thus often starred in performances in her hometown of Mississippi.\n\nIt seems she came a long way from the small city of Purvis. This gorgeous 5â2â brunette is of English, French, Italian, and Scottish descent. Talk about a good gene pool.\n\nAnna Chlumsky - 5â2â\n\nAnna Chlumskyâs big acting break came after playing the role of the beloved Vada in âMy Girlâ when she was just eleven years old. The coming-of-age film was a huge hit back in the 90s, so much so that a sequel soon came out in 1994. Ever since this 5â2â acting powerhouse has been on our screens for a variety of roles in film and TV.\n\nChlumsky has starred in horror films like âThe Lady in Whiteâ and award-winning comedy series like âVeep.â It seems that whatever she does, Chlumsky puts her heart into it, and succeeds â big time.\n\nJudi Dench - 5â1â\n\nDame Judi Denchâs career began on stage in 1957 with the Old Vic Theatre Company. Since then, she has won an Academy Award, two Golden Globe Awards, ten BAFTA Awards, seven Laurence Olivier Awards, and even a Tony Award. Her silver screen debut was in 1995, with her astonishing portrayal of Queen Elizabeth I in âShakespeare in Love.â\n\nShe was also the first woman to play James Bondâs boss, M, in seven of the iconic â007â films. Dench continues to take on various challenging roles today, proving that age is no barrier to success. The fact that sheâs a tiny woman of 5â1â makes no difference to this womanâs massive talent."
