        "text": "While Ed Wood probably won't do the kind of business enjoyed by Edward Scissorhands, this deliciously bizarre bio-pic should instantly become a movie cultist's treasure.\n\nJanuary 19, 2024\n\nThe sweet center of the movie is Wood's resurrection of horror actor Bela Lugosi, a despairing drug addict who is played brilliantly by Martin Landau.\n\nJanuary 19, 2024\n\nWhat happens when a good filmmaker tries to make a great film about a terrible filmmaker. In the case of Tim Burton's Ed Wood, you get an odd and oddly unsatisfying film with occasional flourishes of brilliance.\n\nJanuary 19, 2024\n\nIt's pathetic, but Burton does a good job of keeping it entertaining. You might not want to be any of these people, but you don't mind watching.\n\nJanuary 19, 2024\n\nThe film is not only a hilarious satire of Wood and his low-budget antics, but also a loving paean to dreamers everywhere.\n\nJanuary 19, 2024\n\nTim Burton’s best movie, this unique gem is a gentle valentine that celebrates the creative spirit, no matter how misguided that particular spirit happens to be.\n\nAugust 27, 2023\n\nEd Wood doesn’t really give us the inside of Wood’s head, but it does treat imaginatively a number of Wood movies that retain a certain fascination ...\n\nJune 7, 2022\n\nEd Wood is nevertheless one of the most convincing evocations of the old Hollywood, perhaps (paradoxically) because the re-created universe is so marginal, lacking so much of the traditional Hollywood glamour.\n\nMay 3, 2022\n\nOne of the most hilarious and poignant movies of the year. A real surprise.\n\nMarch 14, 2022\n\nWinner of two Academy Awards including Best Supporting Actor and Best Makeup, the irony in Ed Wood is that the worst director of all time brought out the best of the man and what many consider Tim Burtons best film.\n\nJanuary 31, 2023"
