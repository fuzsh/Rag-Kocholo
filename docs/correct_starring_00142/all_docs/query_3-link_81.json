        "text": "Ageism is rampant in Hollywood — and in just about every industry — and more often than not, it is women who suffer the most. Male actors have long been held to a different standard than actresses. They land roles as love interests and action heroes well into their 70s. Meanwhile movies and TV shows with leading women older than 40 are few and far between.\n\nThe result? Absurd casting decisions like having Nicole Kidman play the mom of 12-years-her-junior Jason Momoa in Aquaman, and an ever-growing group of actresses over 50 who are bursting with talent and don’t have the opportunities they deserve available to them.\n\nIn the past few years, though, we’ve seen some of these women taking back the reins, launching production companies or transitioning into directing and teaming up with other women in the industry. And even more female stars are speaking out about the ludicrous treatment of women over 50. Take Meryl Streep, for example, when explaining why she took on the role of a witch in Into The Woods, she made sure to point out that too many women her age are forced into similar roles due to a lack of options.\n\n“I was offered three witches [roles] when I turned 40 – in one year,” she told ABC News in 2014. “And I thought: ‘Oh, this is how it’s gonna go?’ … At this point in my career, I think, I really think hard about: ‘What am I putting into the world with each project?'”\n\nNow, there are more actresses than ever who are over 50 and at the absolute top of their game, from Jennifer Lopez to Robin Wright, Laura Dern, Kelly Ripa, and so many more.\n\nIn fact, when we think about the biggest leading lady stars today, it feels like most of our heavy hitters are in the 50-and-over club — which, by the way, makes perfect sense. After decades honing their craft in the industry, why wouldn’t they be more talented than ever before, more confident and more attuned to the camera? Why on earth have we been sidelining these women who not only have the lived experience to tell more complex stories, but the wherewithal to handle the pressures of such media attention?\n\nThe truth is, those in power in film and TV are only now beginning to recognize the immense star power these actresses hold — and that’s important news for every viewer, actor, or producer out there. These actresses are living proof that age ain’t nothing but a number and talent rises to the top, so read on for our favorite stars over 50 who are taking back the industry.\n\nA version of this story was originally published in 2020."
