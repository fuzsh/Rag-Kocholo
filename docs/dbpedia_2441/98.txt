History

Bennett High School was built in the 1920s. It has four stories with 270,000 square feet (25,000 m2). It is named for Lewis J. Bennett, who donated the land for the school and for All High Stadium. Portions of the 1984 movie The Natural were filmed in All High Stadium, although it was filmed as Wrigley Field.

The school was renovated in the summer of 2005 and the summer of 2006. During this time, some students were housed at Bennett while others were housed at nearby School 63 on Minnesota Avenue.

In 2014, the school began phasing out, not accepting incoming classes, due to low academic performance. The school is being replaced by Middle Early College High School and the new Computing Academy of Technological Sciences.
