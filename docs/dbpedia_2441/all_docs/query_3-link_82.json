        "text": "Bob Stewart has been working with banks as a business person for more than thirty years. He understands better than most people what people need and expect from a quality banking relationship. That is why Bob is excited to put his experience to work as High Plains Bank’s new Bennett Market President.\n\nAsked what he wants people in the I-70 corridor communities to know, Bob responded, “I am available on their hours, not banking hours. My cell phone number is on my business cards and I’m available to customers when they need to talk.” Bob added, “I am excited to help our communities continue to grow in this new role as a banker.”\n\nHigh Plains Bank is excited to have Bob as part of the team. “I can’t think of anyone better for this role,” says John Creighton, High Plains Bank CEO. “Bob has literally helped to build the I-70 corridor communities of Watkins, Bennett, Strasburg, Byers and Deer Trail as a builder, rancher and aviator. He and his wife Sara have been long-term supporters of the bank. We are proud to have a couple who care so deeply about the I-70 communities as part of our team.”\n\nBob will focus on business development and connecting customers with people in the bank who can help them accomplish their goals. “I will be out in the community talking with people to make sure the bank is meeting their needs,” said Stewart. “My wife and I are fortunate to call Bennett and the surrounding area our home. I look forward to visiting with my neighbors and friends about High Plains Bank.”\n\nIn addition to his business and community involvement, Bob is an experienced aviator who uses his love of flying to be of service with Angel Flight, one of the largest air ambulance providers in the United States. Angel Flight transports patients on medically configured jet aircraft equipped with intensive care unit capabilities to ensure every patient receives high-quality care.\n\nTo welcome Bob in his new role and to celebrate 26 years of serving the Bennett and surrounding communities, High Plains Bank Bennett is hosting a community appreciation party on Friday, August 2nd from Noon-4:00 PM complete with hot dogs, beverages, activities for the whole family, and even a doggy pool. The entire community is invited."
