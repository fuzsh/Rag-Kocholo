        "text": "I have really enjoyed the club and extracurricular life at this school. Events like Rock & Rock Revival have really showcased musical and performing talent in a way not available to most students. Compared to other schools in the county there is a surplus of extracurriculars. The safety in the school was a weak point my freshman year. I would love to see more school spirit and a better sports department, specifically in football, seeing as our team has only won twice in the last three years.\n\nJames M. Bennett is an all-round decent school. From academics to sports, Bennett is just good-enough. There is a noticeable lack in resources for research and science fair experiences. Unfortunately, the school is not very safe and has had a lot of bad situations like gun threats."
