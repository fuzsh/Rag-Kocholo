        "text": "Good morning. It’s Thursday. We’ll find out what’s going on at the high school in Queens founded by one Anthony Benedetto. You know him as Tony Bennett. We’ll also get details on what prosecutors say was a murder-for-hire plot directed by an Indian government official against a Sikh separatist in New York.\n\nFor students at a high school rehearsing for a tribute concert tomorrow, there are reminders that Tony Bennett left his heart in Astoria, Queens. There is the striking metal lettering on the school’s marquee that reads “Tony Bennett, Founder.” And there are the charts the band will play — copies of the actual sheet music used when Bennett performed songs like “New York, New York” with Lady Gaga.\n\n“They’re the professional charts,” said Ella Rubin, a trombonist who is in 12th grade at the school, the Frank Sinatra School of the Arts. (Bennett, who died in July at 96, named it for that other great crooner.)\n\n“I have a lot of experience playing jazz,” Rubin said. “I can definitely tell the difference between the average high school piece they would have us playing and these.”\n\nBut the principal, Gideon Frankel, said there would be a difference between this concert and many past performances at the school. “Tony won’t be here,” he said. “We’re used to having him in the audience.”\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
