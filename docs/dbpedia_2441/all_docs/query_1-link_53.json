        "text": "With a high-wind storm expected to hit Brooklyn and parts of Queens on Tuesday night, New York City Emergency Management evacuated the 487 migrant families living at Floyd Bennett Field to James Madison High School in Midwood, Brooklyn.\n\nThe news was first confirmed to The Wave early on Tuesday by NYC Councilwoman Joann Ariola, who received word of the evacuation plans that morning. When the rumors first emerged, Ariola checked with both New York City Emergency Management and Mayor Eric Adams’ office to verify the reports. Upon receiving confirmation that the migrants would be evacuated, she inquired further about evacuation plans for Rockaway residents in the event of flooding from high tides.\n\n“They didn’t have a plan in place,” Ariola told The Wave. “Our evacuation route is now going to be tied up with migrants being taken out,” she added. “I want to know what’s going to happen to my constituents, who are tax-paying citizens of New York City. If they need to be evacuated, where will they go? I am waiting to hear back on that.”\n\nThe migrants first arrived at Floyd Bennett Field in November after months of protests near the site, as well as a lawsuit stemming from a Sept. 19 injunction filed by Ariola, NYS Assemblywoman Jaime Williams, NYS Assemblywoman Stacey Pheffer Amato, and 36 other elected officials and civic leaders that challenges New York State’s authority to use Floyd Bennett Field, a national park site, for migrant housing.\n\nDuring a September press conference, the bipartisan opposition raised concerns about Floyd Bennett Field being located in a flood zone and how that would affect emergency evacuation procedures. Last month, the Floyd Bennett Field shelter tents experienced flooding, and gusts of wind and heavy rainfall caused metal bolts and hinges to fall from the structure’s ceilings.\n\nFearing the effects of 67-70 mph winds near Floyd Bennett Field, the city moved about 1900 migrants to James Madison High School at 6 p.m. on Tuesday. The school’s principal, Jodie Cohen, confirmed the plan was for the migrants to remain in the building as “a temporary overnight respite shelter” equipped with supplies to provide “short-term respite.”\n\n“Throughout this process, our number one priority is, and will continue to be, the safety of our students and our communities,” Cohen said in a statement.\n\nWhile further details from the school were reserved for a 7 p.m. meeting with parents on Tuesday, Ariola confirmed to The Wave that the students of James Madison High School would not have school in person on Wednesday given the time constraints.\n\n“Taxpayers are being overburdened, our students are being inconvenienced, the school that is meant for the students is now going to be packed with just about 2000 people, and the city does not have a really comprehensive plan,” Ariola said. “This is something that could have been prevented because this is what we’ve been saying all along.”\n\nFor Williams, who was in Albany when she learned the news of the evacuation, the decision to move the migrants to James Madison High School was particularly concerning. In addition to Floyd Bennett Field falling within her district, Williams is the parent of a James Madison High School student.\n\n“Our children who attend James Madison H.S., my child included, deserve better,” Williams said. “They are being inconvenienced and their education interrupted, this is not acceptable. Our schools and our children are not expendable and should not be pawns in this migrant shuffle game.”\n\nNYC Councilwoman Inna Vernikov, whose district includes the school, echoed Williams’ sentiments, adding that the building is not a facility “for emergency housing.”\n\n“There are approximately 4,000 students who attend Madison High School. Their parents are rightfully concerned,” Vernikov said. “Our constituents who live in the vicinity are concerned for their safety and wellbeing. This will agitate local residents, disrupt the entire school environment, and place a tremendous burden on our families, students, administrators, and staff.”\n\nBreezy Point’s Col. Thomas Sullivan, who is running for State Assembly, was among the first to announce the evacuation with a statement that went viral on X (formerly known as Twitter). Sullivan referred to the decision as “shocking, but not surprising” in his statement, which was read by 1.8 million people and retweeted by U.S. Senators John Cornyn and J.D. Vance.\n\n“Our community cannot handle this crisis,” Sullivan said. “The fact that we are spending millions for this camp…is a slap in the face to all the hard working families that call Rockaway home.”\n\nShortly after the migrants arrived at James Madison High School, Mayor Eric Adams visited the school. City Hall spokeswoman Kayla Mamelak referred to the evacuation decision as “a proactive measure.”\n\n“The families are already in the process of being temporarily relocated and will continue to be provided with essential services and support,” Mamelak said on Tuesday. “The relocation will continue until any weather conditions that may arise have stabilized and the facility is once again fit for living.”\n\nOn Wednesday, the migrants returned to the Floyd Bennett Field shelter at approximately 4:30 a.m. with no damage reported at the site. Later that day, James Madison High School announced it would return to in-person instruction on Thursday, Jan. 11 after “a thorough safety check” by the NYPD and “deep cleaning” from their custodial staff."
