        "text": "In 1908, the Virginia General Assembly granted money for an agricultural high school for each of the 10 state districts. Manassas was chosen to be home to the agricultural school for the eighth district and also was the first agricultural school to be built from this grant.\n\nDr. Maitland C. Bennett donatedÂ two acres of landÂ for theÂ Bennett School,Â located on a small hill near the existing Manassas Court House. In digging the foundations for the Bennett School, two graves were found.Â They were the graves of soldiers from the Civil War.Â It was decided to leave the graves in place and erect theÂ BennettÂ SchoolÂ as a memorial to those who died in the Civil War.Â\n\nTheÂ BennettÂ SchoolÂ project cost $16,000.Â In 1909,Â Â BennettÂ SchoolÂ opened for elementary students inÂ ManassasÂ who lived within a nine mile radius of the school.Â Due to the large elementary school student population, Bennett was never used as an agricultural high school. The then existingÂ RuffnerÂ SchoolÂ inÂ ManassasÂ wasÂ expanded to accommodate the agricultural and secondary students.Â In 1913, Ruffner was expanded a second time.Â\n\nAs the Ruffner School became overcrowded in the 1920's, theÂ OsbournÂ SchoolÂ was built for secondary education and to house the agricultural school.Â Later a newÂ OsbournÂ SchoolÂ was built and the oldÂ OsbournÂ SchoolÂ became the Bennett Annex.Â Both buildings served asÂ BennettÂ SchoolÂ until 1969.Â A new Bennett school was built in 1969 and theÂ OldÂ BennettÂ SchoolÂ next to the judicial center was used by the Prince William County Police.Â The Old Osbourn was torn down in 1986.\n\nToday Bennett School is managed by Department of Public Works, Buildings and Grounds Division and is not publicly accessible. Its future use is currently under review in the Judicial Center Complex Master Plan.Â"
