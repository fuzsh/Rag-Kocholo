        "text": "School District\n\nFargo Public School District #1\n\nGrades\n\nKindergarten through 5\n\nAverage Enrollment:\n\n536 students\n\nArrival is 8:20 AM\n\nDismissal is 2:42 PM\n\nExisting Conditions\n\nBennett Elementary is a kindergarten through 5th grade school in the Fargo Public School District. It is located approximately six miles south of Downtown Fargo in the city’s Bennett neighborhood. The neighborhood consists primarily of residential single-family homes. Within the Bennett boundaries, per capita income and household income are much higher than the district average. Seventeen percent of Bennett students are eligible for free and reduced lunch programs. Around three percent of students participate in English Language Learners programs.\n\nThe Bennett school facility was constructed in 2000. The campus is bound by 21st Street S to the west, 58th Avenue S to the north, approximately 16th Street S and Sundance Square S to the east, and 60th Avenue S to the south. The surrounding roads are generally low traffic roadways serving the residential developments. However, some speeding was observed during the field review. School speed zones are designated along 58th Avenue S from Bishops Boulevard / 21st Street S to east of Bennett Park, and along 21st Street S from 58th Avenue S to 60th Avenue S. Within the walk zone, there are some sidewalk gaps, mostly associated with undeveloped parcels.\n\nObserved Circulation & Challenges\n\n58th Avenue S, north of the campus, is perceived by caregivers as a barrier to walking and biking. There are sidewalk gaps, observed high speed traffic, and poor yielding compliance. The field review indicated the intersection with 20th Street S has low pedestrian visibility. Drivers along the corridor do not expect\n\nto see pedestrians crossing at this location.\n\n64th Avenue S is outside of the school’s current walk zone but was identified as a potential barrier due to the wide lanes and observed high speed traffic.\n\nThe shared use path along the eastern edge of the property is a primary north-south circulation route for students walking and biking to school. This trail crosses 58th Avenue S and 62nd Avenue S. There is a flashing beacon at the 58th Avenue S crossing and a bicycle crossing sign at the 62nd Avenue S crossing. During the field review, it was observed that drivers were not anticipating trail users to cross at these locations.\n\nOn the west side of the property, incomplete sidewalk networks encourage students to cut across the green space to get to the building.\n\nOpportunities for Improvement\n\nDue to the identified challenges crossing 58th Avenue S, high impact opportunities for improvement were focused along and across this street in order to make crossings more comfortable for students and families walking to Bennett Elementary. By improving visibility, shortening crossing distances and making it clearer and more obvious where drivers should expect to see people crossing, challenges will likely decrease along 58th Avenue S.\n\nAs this area of Fargo grows to the south of school, it will be important to provide comfortable and low stress connections for students and families. In particular, the crossing of 64th Avenue S at 21st Street S should be considered for improvement as more families begin living south of school.\n\nSidewalks should be installed to connect the existing sidewalk on campus to 21st Street S because many students use and will use 21st Street S to access school.\n\nSuggested Safe Route To School\n\nThis map was designed to illustrate suggested routes to school for students based on existing infrastructure. Metro COG is not liable for anyone that uses this map.\n\nLast Updated: February 2020\n\n2000 58th Ave S\n\nFargo, ND 58104\n\n(701) 446-4000\n\nFor more detailed information regarding Bennett Elementary School Challenges and Opportunities for Improvement see the full Bennett Elementary School Chapter below:\n\nHow to Get Involved at Bennett?\n\nI'm a parent...\n\nParents can use this plan to understand the conditions at their children’s school and to become familiar with the ways a SRTS program can work to make walking and bicycling safer. Concerned parents or city residents have a very important role in the Safe Routes to School process. Parent groups, both formal and informal, have the ability and the responsibility to help implement many of the educational and encouragement programs suggested in this plan. Parent groups can also be key to ongoing success by helping with fundraising for smaller projects and programs.\n\nI'm a student...\n\nStudents are perhaps the most influential when it comes to advocating for change at their schools and in their neighborhoods. Student leaders have the capacity to organize programs in their schools to continue momentum of this planning effort.\n\nI am a School Administrator...\n\nSchool administrators have an important role in implementing the recommendations contained within this SRTS plan. For a plan to succeed, the impetus for change and improvement must be supported by the leadership of the school.\n\nSchool administrators can help with making policy and procedural changes to projects that are within school grounds and by distributing informational materials to parents within school publications.\n\nI am a teacher or school staff member...\n\nOther than parents, teachers might interact with students the most. Teachers can include bicycle and pedestrian safety in lesson plans. Sharing books in the classroom that promote walking and biking is a good way to get kids interested at an early age. Teachers can also arrange for field trips within walking distance of school and incorporate informal lessons about safety along the way. In general, being positive and encouraging about walking and biking is a great way to start.\n\nReturn to the 2020 City of Fargo SRTS Plan project page for more information regarding the plan process and further documentation.\n\n2020 City of Fargo Safe Routes to School Plan"
