        "text": "Summary:\n\nMiddle Early College High School is a public high school serving grades 9-12 in Buffalo, New York, with a total enrollment of 314 students. The school is part of the Buffalo City School District, which is ranked 812 out of 866 districts in New York and has a 0-star rating from SchoolDigger.\n\nWhile Middle Early College High School has some positive metrics, such as higher graduation rates (ranging from 85.9% to 94.8%) and lower dropout rates (4.2% in 2022-2023) compared to nearby schools like McKinley Vocational High School (61.6% graduation rate, 14.7% dropout rate) and Academy School (14.8% graduation rate, 55.5% dropout rate), it struggles with high chronic absenteeism rates (ranging from 56.3% to 76.2%) that are significantly higher than the rates of schools like Amherst Central High School (22.6%) and Frederick Olmsted #156 (53.1%). Additionally, the school's test scores on Regents exams are generally lower than the Buffalo City School District and New York state averages, with some exceptions, such as performing better than the district in English Language Arts (76.24% proficient) but lower in Algebra I (46.96% proficient).\n\nThe school's student population is significantly more racially diverse, with 72.61% of students being African American, compared to nearby schools ranging from 31.75% to 62.76% African American students. This, combined with the high percentage of students (84.39%) receiving free or reduced-price lunch, suggests that Middle Early College High School serves a student population facing significant socioeconomic challenges. Addressing these issues, including improving student attendance and academic performance, will likely require a multifaceted approach that considers the unique needs and circumstances of the school's community.\n\nDetail:"
