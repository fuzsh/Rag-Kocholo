        "text": "Dobyns-Bennett is most certainly a very...interesting school. Some teachers are flat out creepy---specifically the art teacher---one of the librarians look like they're apart an adult website, some staff members have obvious favorites---my girlfriends and I always got yelled at for standing in the cafeteria while the group of boys next to us were fine---and a lot of the students are almost completely naked but doesn't get in trouble. A lot of the rooms are either too hot or cold, most bathrooms are treated poorly (this also applies to the cafeteria), and some parts of the school is absolutely wrecked. Overall subject-wise the school is great. There isn't a lot of after school activities, but with the ones that are given, there's a bit of diversity. The food is good on most days, but there's a few cases they served raw/burnt food, which is not worth the 5-10 minute wait. So the school is overall okay, minus the fact you can jump over the railings."
