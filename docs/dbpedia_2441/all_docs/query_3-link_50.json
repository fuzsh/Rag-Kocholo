        "text": "KINGSPORT – Dobyns-Bennett High School has been named by U.S. News & World Report as one of the Best High Schools in the United States and has made the 2015 Americas Most Challenging High Schools list published by The Washington Post.\n\nThe new Best High Schools rankings, which are available online here, are produced in conjunction with RTI International, a global nonprofit social science research firm.\n\nU.S. News has published detailed information on more than 21,150 public high schools, including school-specific data on enrollment, student ethnicity, location, school type and results of state assessments, as well as Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate tests. Using some of these data and a comprehensive methodology, schools were given a College Readiness Index score, with the top-scoring 6,500-plus schools receiving a gold, silver or bronze medal – and in the case of gold and silver schools, a national numerical ranking.\n\nDobyns-Bennett High School is ranked in the top five (5) percent of all high schools nationally at #1,336. This year D-B has placed at the highest state ranking in school history at #7 overall and #3 for non-magnet.\n\nWe are extremely proud that Dobyns-Bennett has once again been recognized as one of Americas best high schools in the nation by U.S. News & World Report, said Dr. Lyle Ailshie, Kingsport City Schools Superintendent.\n\nApproximately 650 Advanced Placement tests were administered to D-B students in 2014. The number of seniors graduating from D-B in 2014 was 431.\n\n76 percent of Dobyns-Bennett High School students who completed an AP test scored at least a three (3) or above. An AP exam score ranging from a three (3) to a five (5) qualifies students for college credit in the subject area.\n\nThis recognition is a celebration of a culture of high expectations, a belief that all students can learn and succeed and a commitment from everyone to always go the extra mile, said Dr. Chris Hampton, Dobyns-Bennett High School Principal.‚ This is a collective recognition, as it takes every single one of our faculty and staff and dedication they put forth every day to provide our students with one of the best educational opportunities in the world.\n\nThe Most Challenging High Schools list can be found here and is based upon the index score of the number of college-level tests given at a school in the previous calendar year divided by the number of graduates that year. Also noted are the percentage of students who come from families that qualify for lunch subsidies and the percentage of graduates who passed at least one college-level test during their high school career, called equity and excellence.\n\nD-B was ranked #1,873 among 2,349 high schools Challenge Index scores listed.\n\nKingsport‚ City Schools (KCS) is a public school district located in‚ Kingsport, Tenn., serving students in Sullivan and Hawkins county.
