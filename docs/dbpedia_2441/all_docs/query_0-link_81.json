Feel free to comment and ask questions as well.\n\nIf anyone wants to speak about the club you can get a hold of me a few different ways too:\n\nMobile: 716 998 1711\n\nemail: rknapp@buffalocityfc.com\n\nmsn: ryaninspain@hotmail.com\n\nskype: ryan.knapp\n\nOverview of the club:\n\nBuffalo City FC was founded in 2008 in Buffalo, New York to bring the most elite soccer training to Western New York and beyond.\n\nOur club has over 30 partnerships with professional clubs all around the world. (EPL, Coca-Cola Championship, League 1 and 2, La Liga, Serie A, Ligue 1)BCFC is a direct link for players who wish to make football their life. This means that if you want to get a trial, you have to be willing to put in the work, end of story.\n\nWe will also be providing second-to-none youth training, headed by head coach Mike Share. Mike has played professionally for PSV Eindhoven, AS Monaco and other clubs in England and also Spain. Mike is touted as one of the best up and coming coaches in the world, having given sessions at some of the biggest clubs in Europe. BCFC will be working with local youth clubs to improve on their training methods to ensure the players are getting the best training possible, also at a price they can afford.\n\nWe will also be hosting European teams coming into Buffalo this summer, as well as organizing teams to play in top European youth and club competitions in the future.\n\nBuffalo City FC will also be working with Carly's Club to raise money for Pediatric Cancer Research done at Roswell Park. We will be working hand in hand with Carly's Club to join in the fight against cancer in our community through weekly visits and a all-star soccer game tenatively scheduled in August to raise money and awareness for Carly's Club.\n\nThe new Buffalo City FC website launched today. A few of the pages are still being updated by myself, but feel free to poke around and explore. News stories will be coming out as they happen (most likely every other day or so) and the site will constantly be updated with sponsors, merchandise as it becomes available, and other signings as they happen.\n\nToday's news:\n\nBuffalo City FC is proud to present two international signings to our front office:\n\nFrancois Glasman (Founder of Shooting Stars Soccer International in Canada and The Hangar in Toronto), as International Development Coach and Advisor.\n\nhttp://www.buffalocityfc.com/news/08/december/francois.html\n\nCraig Mander (Director at AFA Marbella) as European Scout Advisor and Coach.\n\nhttp://www.buffalocityfc.com/news/08/december/Craigmanderannouncement.html\n\nAlso, AFA Marbella has become the Official European Academy of Buffalo City FC. Unlike other teams who are based in Europe and open academies in the US, we've taken on AFA Marbella as our own academy, providing our players with even more opportunity overseas, as well as welcoming our academy players from Spain and Europe to Buffalo this summer to play our first team and train with Buffalo City FC.\n\nYep. Its an interesting model. I noticed this in their sponsor section...\n\nSo they are banking on big crowds and hoping sponsors will pick up the tab.\n\nBCFC Buffalo City Football Club\n\nMEDIA ADVISORY\n\nFOR PLANNING PURPOSES: FOR MORE INFORMATION:\n\nTuesday, February 3, 2009 Scott Frauenhofer, 716-860-3115 ​\n\nNEWS CONFERENCE 3:00 P.M.
