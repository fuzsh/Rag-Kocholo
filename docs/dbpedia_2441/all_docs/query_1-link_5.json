        "text": "I love my school becuase everyone in this school is friendly, and easy to talk with them. All teachers are really good and they all care about each other. The school environment is really nice and I feel too comfortable at school and feel like this school is my home. We have so many activities and clubs to join. I feel like we are all big families.\n\nI like there is an Animation/Design class and art class. I wish freshmen could do Animation/Design since 10-12 grades can. There isn't a music class and I want there to be one. Overall the school is pretty good."
