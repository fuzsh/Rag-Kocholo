        "text": "Parents and pols are outraged that students were booted from a Brooklyn school to make room for nearly 2,000 migrants during Tuesday’s storm — and warned it could become part of the city’s playbook as officials stumble to keep pace with the runaway migrant crisis.\n\n“We never know what’s going to happen with the weather,” state Assemblyman Michael Novakhov (R-Brooklyn) said outside James Madison High School.\n\n“They can be moved here again depending on the weather conditions,” Novakhov said. “If the weather is bad again are migrants supposed to be moved to this school again? Because schools are not the place for migrants — as simple as that.”\n\nThe backlash stems from a last-minute decision by Mayor Eric Adams to bus hundreds of migrant families from a controversial tent shelter at Floyd Bennett Field to the school 5 miles away — with asylum seekers forced to nap on a gym floor before being rustled back to the shelter just hours later.\n\nThe move displaced Madison High students, who were forced into remote lessons on Wednesday.\n\n“The writing was on the wall the minute the city started being inundated with migrants,” said one mother who only gave her name as Maria. “It’s disgusting. It should not be put on us taxpayers.”\n\nHer teen daughter, a student at the school, added, “I do believe they are putting the life of people who are here illegally and not documented over my life. I am a 15-year-old girl at the school who wants to get her education and better her life, and she can’t come to school today because the day was interrupted by people who aren’t supposed to be here.”\n\nMom Elina Bekker called the move to force students to stay home a “horrible decision” during a rally outside the school that began with tense exchanges with a handful of counterprotestors.\n\n“We were concerned how will this affect those students in the future if it’s a one-time thing,” Bekker said. “But if it’s going to be a recurring event, it’s definitely not acceptable.\n\n“The school should not be used,” she added. “Our kids are supposed to be here feeling safe and able to learn. Many of our kids have Regents coming up in February [and] they just lost a day of school, a day of learning.”\n\nCops said the backlash over the brief migrant relocation included bomb threats called in at the school and the Madison Hotel on the Lower East Side — possibly over confusion over the name they share.\n\n“Everybody knew this was going to happen,” City Councilman Michael Reilly (R-Staten Island) said of the migrant move. “If you didn’t see it coming then you were either blind, dumb or just stupid.\n\n“We knew it was going to happen and it is just going to happen again, but it’s going to happen in a school in your neighborhood,” Reilly said.\n\nThe influx of asylum seekers has already put a strain on the school system as thousands of migrant children enrolled in classes — while some schools were used as migrant facilities over the summer.\n\nThe city has also shown a penchant for using shuttered school buildings as full-fledged migrant shelters. A plan to use the former St. John Villa Academy on Staten Island sparked so much outrage from locals that the city eventually dropped the idea.\n\nCity officials on Wednesday defended the decision to uproot the Floyd Bennett Field migrants for several hours after concerns were raised that the tent at the former federal airfield could collapse under torrential rain and dangerous winds that hit the borough late Tuesday and into Wednesday.\n\nThe migrants began arriving at the second-floor school gym shortly before 5 p.m. and were bused back starting at 1 a.m. — with all of them back in the shelter by 4:30 a.m.\n\nPhotos posted on X by Adams showed lines of school desks lined up in the Madison High School gym, with blankets and other supplies strewn about as migrant families napped on the floor.\n\n“Anybody sleeping in an auditorium by definition is never going to be comfortable,” city Health and Hospitals Senior Vice President Theodore Long said Wednesday.\n\n“Our goal was to make you, to do everything in our power to make you as comfortable while having your safety as a top priority,” he said. “That’s why we did things like provide hot meals, blankets, pillows. But safety was of paramount importance to us, given that we want to make sure we’re protecting the children.”\n\nMore than 165,000 migrants from the US border have arrived in the five boroughs since the spring of 2022, with nearly 70,000 currently being housed and fed by city taxpayers.\n\nThe Floyd Bennett Field tent shelter, which was made available after Gov. Kathy Hochul pushed the White House to make the abandoned field available, faced opposition from the beginning.\n\nSeveral elected officials warned that the remote location was ill-suited for migrant families, and concerns over the stability of the tent surfaced during a Dec. 18 storm and again this week.\n\nTwo other tent facilities erected at Randall’s Island in Manhattan and the former Creedmoor Psychiatric Center in Queens are considered more stable than the Floyd Bennett shelter.\n\nHowever, the tents at the field weathered Tuesday’s storm without any reported damage."
