        "text": "BUFFALO, N.Y. (WKBW) — The grace period for school zone speed cameras in Buffalo ends on Monday, March 1st. Up until now, drivers were issued a warning for speeding. Now, if you’re clocked going above 26 miles per hour, you’ll get a $50 ticket.\n\nThe school zone speed camera program was reactivated on February 1st in the following locations\n\nDiscovery School, 911 Abbott Rd.\n\nDr. Blackman, PS 54, 2358 Main St.\n\nEve School, 453 Leroy Ave.\n\nGrabiarz School/West Hertel, 489 Hertel Ave.\n\nOlmsted School, 319 Suffolk St.\n\nHoughton Academy, 1725 Clinton St.\n\nHutch Tech/ Herman Badillo Bilingual Academy, 256 Elmwood Ave. / 315 Carolina St.\n\nMakowski School, 1095 Jefferson Ave.\n\nMcKinley School, 1500 Elmwood Ave.\n\nPorter School/ DaVinci School, 255 Porter Ave. / 320 Porter Ave.\n\nBennett Park Montessori, 342 Clinton St.\n\nPerforming Arts, 450 Masten Ave.\n\nAcademy Middle, 425 South Park\n\nLewis J. Bennett School, 2885 Main St.\n\nHarvey Austin School, 1405 Sycamore St.\n\nThe city says there will also be the same education and warning period in place for the five cameras that were reactivated in the fall to keep the program aligned across the city and avoid confusion.\n\nCanisius High School, 1180 Delaware\n\nNichols School, 1250 Amherst Street\n\nNotre Dame Academy, 1125 Abbott Road\n\nSt. Joseph University School, 3275 Main Street\n\nBuffalo Promise Neighborhood Children’s Academy, 3149 Bailey Avenue\n\nThe city has been collecting data during the warning period.\n\n\"People are changing their culture in the school zone safety camera program areas, I think they're going to continue to change that culture,\" said Kevin Helfer, City Parking Violations Commissioner.\n\nThese cameras aim to keep students safe and improve traffic in the city, according to Mayor Byron Brown. But one Buffalo Common Council member says it's turned into a whole different animal.\n\nOne that’s costing people money when they’re already struggling.Urban planner Peter Rizzo looked into the cameras last month and found the city is disproportionately targeting high-poverty, minority neighborhoods.\n\nHe suggests the city needs to drop the program. Common Council Member Rasheed N.C. Wyatt says people in his district were struggling financially because of these cameras and they’ll start struggling again once they’re back on.\n\n“I think it’s gonna get worse, we didn’t fix the problem, we just put a band-aid over it. This is something we just gotta get rid of and move forward and look at less punitive measures and I think speed humps, crosswalks and those type of things are the right way to go,\" said Wyatt.\n\nWyatt says he’s worried that if things don’t change with this program, the public will completely lose trust in the city. He’s meeting with groups this week to look into different ways to keep children safe and keep money in pockets at the same time.\n\nThe City of Buffalo created an interactive map to help you find each location more easily. You can access that map here.\n\nAnyone who speeds will be issued a $50 fine."
