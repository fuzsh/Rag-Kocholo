The College graduates educated women who are not only academically prepared and serious about learning, but who are also open to intellectual expansion, accepting of diversity, and strong in her determination to serve humanity.\n\nBennett College is the only historically African American college for women in North Carolina and is one of two such HBCUs in the country. Founded in 1873 as a coed institution and reorganized as a college exclusively for women in 1926, today Bennett is a private, four-year liberal arts college affiliated with the United Methodist Church."
