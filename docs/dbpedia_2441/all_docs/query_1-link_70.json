        "text": "Bennett, Wayne E.\n\nWayne Edward Bennett, 71, of Clifton Park, New York left peacefully\n\nwith his wife by his side on August 15, 2017. Born February 26, 1946\n\nto Edward F. Bennett and Eleanor I. Bennett, Wayne was a happy child\n\nwho expressed an early passion for adventure. He was an athlete and\n\noutdoorsman who cherished his time working at his maternal\n\ngrandparent’s farm. As a young boy, Wayne dreamed of becoming a New\n\nYork State Trooper. After graduating from Maple Hill High School,\n\nHudson Valley Community College, and The State University of New York\n\nat Albany, Wayne applied to and was accepted as a recruit in the\n\nprestigious New York State Police Academy. Following his 1969\n\ngraduation with the 115th Basic School Session, Wayne began a career\n\nthat spanned almost 40 years with the New York State Police. Holding\n\nall but three titles in the Uniform Force and Bureau of Criminal\n\nInvestigation, Wayne prided himself on understanding the needs of his\n\nfellow Troopers. In his career, he worked under six New York State\n\nGovernors, performing detail service for Nelson Rockefeller. Wayne\n\nwatched communication systems move from teletypes, to fax machines to\n\nemail, to internet and web-based networks. He celebrated the\n\nadmittance and graduation of the first female class at the State\n\nPolice Academy, and watched as they began their careers as Troopers,\n\npaving the way for generations of women in law enforcement. He watched\n\nhis peers work the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid and understood\n\ntheir joy as the Miracle on Ice sparked pride in US citizens. He\n\nsurvived the sobering experience of working Prison detail when the NY\n\nState Corrections Officers went on strike and troopers needed to guard\n\nthose incarcerated. Wayne also worked Thruway detail and witnessed the\n\nWoodstock Festival overtake Bethel and its surrounding areas. He lived\n\nthe life of an undercover investigator interrupting drug trafficking\n\nin New York City in the late 1970s. As he rose in rank, Wayne learned\n\nhow to work with the media and reporters to ensure the integrity of\n\nthe State Police and the people served by its Troopers. Wayne\n\nwitnessed the conception, birth and opening of the NY State Forensic\n\nInvestigation Center. On September 11, 2001, in the aftermath of the\n\n2001 terrorist attacks at the World Trade Center, Wayne responded to\n\nthe World Trade Center site and coordinated and supervised all NY\n\nState Police rescue and recovery operations. Appointed by Gov. George\n\nE. Pataki, Wayne retired as Superintendent of The New York State\n\nPolice and then continued working with the law enforcement community\n\nby serving as The Commissioner of Public Safety/Deputy Mayor, under\n\nMayor Gary McCarthy, for the city of Schenectady, New York. There, he\n\nworked alongside chiefs of police and fire to support residents of the\n\nElectric City.\n\nWayne was a man of unwavering integrity whose vocabulary did not\n\ninclude “assume” or “maybe.” He developed several passions in his life\n\noutside of law enforcement. He enjoyed hunting, fishing, snowshoeing,\n\nand golf. In his younger years, he mastered the art of working with\n\nstained glass. However, his greatest joy came from being a father to\n\nhis daughters and grandfather to his granddaughters. He made cupcakes\n\nfor his kids, taught them how to fish, change tires, and be master\n\nassistants to home improvement projects. He routinely boasted of his\n\nchildren’s accomplishments after proudly putting his three daughters\n\nthrough college.\n\nWayne is predeceased by his parents, mother and brother in-law. He is\n\nsurvived by his wife, Patricia E. Bennett, twin sister Jean (David)\n\nKaercher of Latham, New York, brother Richard (Carol) Bennett of\n\nRockford, Illinois, and younger sister, Katherine (Edmund) Prescottano\n\nof Medfield, Massachusetts. Wayne leaves behind his loving daughters,\n\nMargaret, Katherine (Russell Bartlett), and Erin. He leaves a legacy\n\nof hard work, commitment, and humor to his granddaughters, Emma\n\nJohnson of Littleton, Colorado, Alexandra Bartlett of Tupper Lake, New\n\nYork, and Charlotte Roberts of Saratoga Springs, New York. Wayne is\n\ngreatly missed by his father-in-law, Dr. Edward Iandoli,\n\nsisters-in-law Helen (John) Walsh of Skillman, NJ and Mary Bates of\n\nKinderhook, NY. Wayne’s smile and “Wayne-isms” will be missed by\n\nseveral nieces, nephews, and friends. The family wishes to extend\n\ntheir deepest thanks to Dr. Lawrence Garbo, Nurse Practitioner Randi\n\nDaniels and the entire staff at NYOH.\n\nNever a person to wallow in regret, Wayne would ask you to consider\n\nthe words of President Theodore Roosevelt, “Do what you can, with what\n\nyou have, where you are.” Move on and speak fondly of him. Keep his\n\nname and his wishes alive by contributing to your families and\n\ncommunities. Be neighborly and take care of those you love.\n\nThose wishing to say farewell to Wayne are encouraged to do so at the\n\nNY State Police Academy 1220 Washington Ave. Building 24, Albany, NY\n\non Friday, August 18, 2017 from 4pm to 8pm. A funeral mass will be\n\nheld at St. Mary's Church 10 Lodge St., Albany, NY on Saturday, August\n\n19, 2017 at 10am. In lieu of flowers, the family respectfully\n\nrequests that you honor Wayne’s memory through a charity of your\n\nchoice, The 9/11 Memorial and Museum, The American Cancer Society or\n\nThe New York State Trooper Foundation, 3 Airport Park Boulevard,\n\nLatham, NY 12110.\n\nService Information"
