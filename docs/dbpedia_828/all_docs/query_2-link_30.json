        "text": "Advertisements\n\nMy wife and I just spent the last 3 days touring the major single family home builders in Market Commons. I haven't been able to find any single-point of discussion regarding them, so I figured I'd do a little write-up to spark discussion. Each of the first 3 are large national builders and you can find numerous negative reports online coming in from across the country. It seems because they have acquired so many different developers in different regions around the country that these reports are seemingly useless if not coming from your specific development area. I've seen very few negative, and a handful of positive reviews for these developers in the Carolinas.\n\nDock Street Communities - Sweetgrass Square\n\nBeazer Homes\n\nLennar - Emmen's Preserve\n\nD.R. Horton - Highlands @ Withers Preserve\n\nHere are some of my observations. We were looking for smaller (by standards of this area) homes - 3 bedroom 2000 sqft - but 2-story designs. As a large portion of the market is retirees, the majority of offerings are single-story residences with no stairs, drastically reducing our model choices.\n\nPreviously occupied homes - Those in the area but outside Market Common, or buildouts west of HWY 17 seemed leagues away from the atmosphere in Market Common. We're moving from Boston but are originally from Pennsylvania and Market Common just has a wonderful buildout with everything you need, and so close to the beach that its hard to compete in our eyes. I also found crossing HWY 17 at Farrow Parkway to be far too busy for my desire to be able to golfcart, bicycle, scooter, or walk to the Beach. I understand they're elevating HWY17 there, but it seems like quite a project: not sure how long its scheduled to take. With the extreme drop in home prices in the past few years, its difficult for these home sellers to compete with the new construction offerings, as they've lowered their prices to what the market will bear at this time, and you're getting a brand new home of your liking. Re-focusing on Market Common developments:\n\nDockstreet Communities - Sweetgrass - We didn't think much of the build quality, home designs, or plot sizes. As an example, its not possible to open and properly re-close windows in the model homes. They are excellently located - just blocks from the Market Common shops and even closer to the beach, than the other developments.\n\nBeazer Homes - We toured at Cameron Village - Very nice looking homes, wonderful sales staff and other employees. They won't have any details on their Market Common offerings until this fall. The only complaint I heard around town was that they skimp on build materials (with 24inches between studs), which is not something you want in a high wind area when Hurricanes are coming through. They may change their build parameters within the Market Common area, to soon to tell. They are open to non-structural modifications during the build process. They don't plan to offer a community pool in Market Commons. This was a negative for us. I also believe that their community's location is bottlenecked road-wise: The only way in and out is through Farrow Parkway. The communities on the south side have numerous roads out.\n\nLennar - Awesome community - supported on both sides by resident activities and planned events by Lennar during the continued buildout. They have stronger construction than Beazer (as confirmed by my own eyes on some houses in the framing stage). Their stance on all the 'upgrades' are standard means you get a good value offering - but with a higher base than competitors. They let you choose only 3 colors/materials. They are totally opposed to even the simplest modifications during the build. Healthy retiree community, but doesn't seem exclusionary. Beautiful Community center with pool, kids play area and exercise room. A little too cookie-cutter for us. Small plots. Their property backs up on a bicycle/walking trail - straight shot to Business 17 where you can cross to the state park for the beach.\n\nD R Horton - Beautiful homes customized to your tailoring. They tour their steal tie-downs build methodology as a big-win in an area with possibility of hurricanes. The tie-downs are epoxy'd into the concrete slab and bolted to the frame every 6 feet to keep your home on the ground, even when winds are pushing it up. They have a home design center where you get to choose every last detail of the inside build, and they're willing to let minor modifications take place during the build process. Their Phase II buildout is starting in the next 6-9 months which includes 16 plots backing up to a lake. I've put myself on the interest list for those. They have a community pool coming, but it doesn't sound as impressive as Lennar's. Their plots are larger - 70ft wide, giving you a little more room between neighbors.\n\nI spoke to homeowners from Beazer, Lennar and D R Horton and all were pleased with their purchases and said they would do so again. For the few who had minor warranty issues, they said builders were responsive in resolving them.\n\nResidents said there are no issues with air traffic overhead - an occasional helicopter or air-force plane mid-day.\n\nWould love to hear others observations - both those touring and those living in these communities.\n\nGlad to see your posting about the Market Commons homes.\n\nI am looking forward myself to the start of the Beazer homes as there is only dirt there now. Sad, to hear that there will be no pool. There are a few communities around for you to see the quality of their buildings. I think they seem to make a solid medium priced home that most can afford.\n\nThe floor plans on Dockstreet are very small. I feel that even retired people need room for guests, and their family visits.\n\nThey are so very charming but are bumped together and extremely close. Most people enjoy a small yard of some type and it isn't built for that need. I found the idea really interesting but the floor plans too small and along with the yard issue not on my favorite list.\n\nLennar, Extremely well built homes and yes, an awesome community. I too don't like cookie-cutter either. I believe people like to have some sort of yard. I , myself don't want a huge yard anymore but enough to feel seperate from my neighbor. However, they did one big fantastic job on a gorgeous pool. A huge asset that many would love.\n\nDR Horton I love how they set themselves just in off the Farrow Parkway. Having a home on the lake would be a joy.\n\nI love living along the lagoon here. I've seen so many interesting birds and wildlife. They are a quality group, and the homes are awesome. On the higher end, but in that location they should loose no value.\n\nI love that the poster did his homework before buying. Your posting is a great help to others heading this way.\n\nMarket Commons is such asset to our area. It is wonderful having everything at your fingertips. Plus, having the ocean nearby. How lucky can one get? Wonderful luck to you and others moving this way."
