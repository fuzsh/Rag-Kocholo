        "text": "So decide on the bed configuration that you want to go with that matches your anticipated guest needs. Of course, the more beds you include, the less room you will have for complementary furnishings. Certainly, make sure that you select a comfortable mattress, since a good night’s sleep is the most important aspect of overnight hospitality.\n\nOutside of the bed and linens, here’s a short checklist of other important furnishings to consider including in the bell tent:\n\nChairs\n\nRugs\n\nLanterns\n\nEnd tables\n\nMirror\n\nWastebasket\n\nRecycling basket\n\nWelcome mat\n\nLuggage rack\n\nCoat rack\n\nGarment rack (short)\n\nBoot tray\n\nTowels\n\nExtra blankets\n\nThrow pillows\n\nHangers\n\nPlants (succulents!)\n\nFor more ideas, Airbnb also provides a checklist for how to keep guests happy through essential amenities, safety features, and more.\n\nPower Up the Bell Tent\n\nFortunately, in today’s world there are many options for providing your guests with electrical power. At minimum you will want to offer a solution to recharge phones so that they can take pictures of your amazing tent and share them with the world. Here are some power solutions to consider:\n\nRechargeable powerbank charger (20,000-30,000 mAh USB charger or an all-in one solution)\n\nRechargeable portable power station (like this one that has an optional solar panel)\n\nRun an extension cord and power strip directly from an outlet\n\nIf you decide to go with rechargeable power stations or a powerbank, consider offering these as an add-on. That way you can check these items in and out and make a few extra bucks.\n\nPrepare your Backyard Tent for cold and wet weather\n\nIt is good to anticipate temperature swings that nature brings so you can help keep your guests as comfortable as possible.\n\nFor chilly evenings, a simple solution to help guard against colder temperatures is to include a few extra blankets that they can use in the bell tent when temperatures drop. But you may also want to consider a heat source.\n\nSmall propane heaters can work well in bell tents, and most come standard with safety features that will shut them off if they tip over or oxygen levels get depleted. You could also go all out and install a wood burning stove in your bell tent so that guests can stay extra cozy.\n\nThe daytime during the summer months will bring with it sweltering summer sun that is difficult to combat inside of any tent. Even with the screened windows and open doors, a breeze is sometimes hard to come by. Fortunately our double wall tents allow you to roll up the lower walls to allow more air in. But you may consider adding a rechargeable fan to your tent to help encourage the airflow.\n\nWe also offer a bell tent fly that can be set-up over the top of the tent to help regulate the internal temperatures within the tent. Once installed, the fly creates a layer of air between the tent that helps to keep the tent cooler in the summer and warmer in the winter. As a bonus, the fly will also keep your tent roof clean from falling debris!\n\nAs for mud, we’d recommend helping to keep your tent floor and rugs clean by including a boot tray that will encourage your guests to take off their dirty shoes in the tent, and an entry mat so that they wipe their feet before entering.\n\nProvide Entertainment Options For Your Guests\n\nYour guests will likely be happy to pass the time with conversation and reflection about their adventures, but anything you can do to help facilitate some extra fun will certainly enhance their stay.\n\nWe suggest adding a few books and magazines that they can leaf through during down time as well as a handful of games such as playing cards, a cribbage board, Exploding Kittens or Cards Against Humanity, which is especially nice for rainy days.\n\nYou will also want to curate a list of local destinations that your guests can experience outside of their campsite. Print out a booklet that includes local hikes, sights, shops and experiences that your guests could consider while they are on their vacation. You can also create a personal digital guidebook for your area and send it to your guests after booking so they can plan for their trip.\n\nWith the overwhelming nature of the internet and its million rabbit holes to get lost in, visitors who are seeking out backyard glamping are most likely into the analog, simple, and personal experiences that come naturally with a backyard tent rental. So, pump up the analog, simple and personal experiences!\n\nPrepare the Bathroom\n\nThe restroom isn’t a sexy amenity, but it is critical to attracting and keeping a fully booked reservation calendar.\n\nToilets\n\nDepending on the infrastructure that is already in place or that you will to invest in, bathrooms can range from rustic to luxurious. Given that your guests are camping, you won’t need to go overboard here, but you do need to be mindful of comfort and privacy. Here are several options that could be implemented:\n\nStand-alone plumbed bathroom with running water\n\nComposting toilet\n\nOuthouse with 4 foot hole dug into the ground\n\nRent a “Port-a-Potty”\n\nRV Toilet\n\nShare your home or office toilet\n\nNo matter the route you go, make sure that you have enough toilets and that they are placed close enough for a midnight run. If you don’t have the luxury of having an onsite sink with running water then we’d suggest including wet wipes and hand sanitizer for your guests.\n\nShowers\n\nA hot shower is one of the best parts about camping, because you come to appreciate it so much more when it’s a luxury. Having a shower available will encourage your guests to stay for multiple evenings. If a fully-functioning bathroom isn’t an option straight away then you could consider a few alternatives:\n\nPropane tankless water heater shower with privacy structure\n\nSolar shower bag with privacy tent or structure\n\nPartner with a local gym to obtain day passes.\n\nBuilding a backyard shower solution can take a bit of work, especially if you want it to function in all seasons. Consider the right solution for you before getting started hosting.\n\nDevelop a plan for coffee\n\nHelping your guests to fuel up first thing in the morning will provide them with positive, lasting memories of their stay. Or at the very least, they’ll remember you as a decent human being who enjoys a good cup of coffee.\n\nYou could go all out and come up with a breakfast offering, but at a minimum we’d recommend giving your guests some caffeinated beverage choices in the morning.\n\nProviding a hot cup of coffee or tea could be a bit tricky if a wired kitchen and plumbed sink isn’t onsite. Here are some options to get around this:\n\nPropane stove + French press + gallon of water\n\nPersonal sized wood burning stove + coffee percolator + gallon of water\n\n12V Electric Kettle + Pour over coffee bags + gallon of water\n\nProvide iced coffee in a cooler\n\nWhatever path you choose, remember that a beverage is only as good as the vessel it comes in. So make sure to provide a mug or cup that represents your backyard tent experience well. For example, a fancy porcelain tea cup may not be entirely appropriate for a glamping experience (or maybe it is?). We’ve got some Life inTents camping mugs available if you’d like to build your backyard guest house experience around our brand.\n\nCreate a guest oasis\n\nSleeping in a bell tent certainly is magical, but your guests will want to spend some time relaxing in some shade, or viewing night time stars. Creating a communal area where your guests can sit, relax, and socialize will enhance their stay. Here are some items that you could include within this oasis:\n\nSitting area\n\nShade\n\nTables\n\nFire pit\n\nLawn games\n\nLighting\n\nTry to make this oasis “Instagramable” by including a unique feature, design, or amenity that is worthy of your guests talking about and sharing with their network of friends and family.\n\nIf you are accustomed to reading reviews about lodgings, guests love to mention the one unique thing that is unmistakably tied to the place, and memorable. Otherwise, most reviews will look nearly identical to every other lodging review.\n\nWhat special feature could you create in your backyard oasis? That’s entirely up to you, but it doesn’t have to be spectacular to create a memorable experience for your guests. A very comfortable fire pit area for nighttime socializing would be a unique draw to your backyard tent rental. A game of Bocce or horseshoes would certainly make it into guest reviews. Or even a backyard swing, vegetable garden, or a shaded sitting area where guests could socialize and reflect.\n\nList Your Tent on Airbnb\n\nYou will get the most eyeballs on your glamping tent by listing your tent on Airbnb. This can translate into the most bookings, and therefore more $$$. Learn how to set up your listing on Airbnb and read tips on how to photograph your space to make your listing stand out. Airbnb also provides many other great guides and resources to help you to get your space ready for guests.\n\nAs you create your listing, you’ll need to determine what your nightly prices will be. Adding up your expenses is a good way to figure out what your bare minimum must be, to break even on your tent guest house. But you also want to make sure you’re in line with your local market by researching comparable stays within 10-20 minutes of your property. Check out this article from Airbnb on how to set a price strategy.\n\nIf the idea of taking in loads of guests day in, day out sounds like another job, you may want to set a minimum night stay. You may lose out on a few visitors who only need one night in your canvas glamping tent, but it could mean the difference between making a profit versus maintaining a side hustle that takes more work than you ever expected. Airbnb gives you full control so you can host only when you want to host. Learn how to master your calendar and booking settings.\n\nIdentify Guest Check-In & Check-Out Procedures\n\nOne of the mainstays of a seasoned lodging destination is the smooth check-in, check-out, and cleaning procedure. The first few times you get a renter, it’s perfectly natural for there to be hiccups. But after a few months into your operation, you shouldn’t have visitors struggle to figure out where you’re located, how to get into your backyard, what to do once they’re settled in, how to deal with the unexpected, and how to check out quickly and smoothly. Check out this article on how to choose the right check-in method for you, and how to make the check-in as simple as possible.\n\nAt the same time, there’s nothing worse than arriving at an overnight rental after a long day of travel, only to find a 10-page document that spells out exhaustive instructions for what should be a simple and peaceful night in a cozy tent. Make sure your house manual is short and easy to understand.\n\nWhen you’re first starting out, it’s helpful to go and checkout what others are doing. In addition to looking at the policies and procedures of other online rental listings, spend a few nights at other backyard guest house rentals and take notes on what you like or what you’d want to improve in your own operation just as these two Airbnb hosts did.\n\nGuest Communication\n\nOutside of the actual stay, there can actually be quite a bit of back and forth communication with guests leading up to their visit. Some guests are planning an elaborate trip that requires some very specific windows of stay, while others want to leave room for flexibility and last minute change. How open you are to either of those types of travelers will determine your style of communication with them up front. Guest communication is key in making guests happy and your life easier - here are some tips to get you started.\n\nWe highly recommend prioritizing responses to any guests messages as quickly as possible - within minutes vs. days. Your guests have graciously selected your property for their rare trip and you don’t want to be responsible for souring their vacation by providing details that would clarify the small or big questions quickly. Your quick responses will set you apart and create some great reviews and referrals.\n\nThen, after your guests have arrived, you’ll want them to have an easy way to contact you - or someone you’ve asked to manage your rental if need be - should there be an emergency or a need to contact you. Of course that’s easy if you’re in the main house - the guests can simply knock on your door. But if you’re out, it’s good to provide guests multiple ways to reach you.\n\nAnd if you’d like, a guestbook can encourage visitors to share some of their most poetic and intimate thoughts during their stay. It’s a way to connect visitors with others who pass through this exact same place, possibly months or years later. And it’s a nice way for you to enjoy some of the reflection that occurs in your backyard. A guestbook is a precious, positive little treasure book and we think it’s one of the best parts about having your own backyard guest house rental.\n\nHousekeeping Plan\n\nIf you’re offering your guests bed sheets and towels, prepare for laundry, and loads of it. You may also need to store a lot more backup sheets, in case you get a buildup of laundry before you can tackle it. And then you’ll want to figure out when and how to clean up after your guests, and prepare for incoming guests if they’re arriving the same day.\n\nHousekeeping may not be a big issue if you only plan on renting your backyard a few times a month at the most, but that could change if you have an unexpected busy season. It’s a good idea to line up someone to help you with housekeeping, like when you’re at your day job, or out of town, so that your tent rental operation can continue to run smoothly even without your absolute attention.\n\nProtect yourself\n\nOf course with any business, there are always unexpected challenges that come up. When you’re dealing with weather, travel logistics, people, and your private property, you want to make sure you’re properly insured in case something goes bad.\n\nIt’s a good idea to review your home insurance policy closely and determine what you need to do to make sure your property is insured against damage caused by - or to - paying guests. There’s always a little line between personal and business liability, so you want to make sure there are no surprises with your home insurance company.\n\nEvery good party has a backup plan\n\nSecond, you may want to set-up an LLC and purchase business liability insurance, to keep everything separate from yourself in case something happens. The alternative is to continue being a sole proprietor and have all the finances and insurance and claims go through you as an individual, which works fine until the day it doesn’t. You don’t necessarily have to have everything figured out right away, but as your rental starts to grow, it’s a good idea to envision a worst-case scenario and get protected properly.\n\nConclusion\n\nWow, that’s a lot that goes into hosting a simple bell tent visitors, isn’t it? Don’t worry, it’s completely up to you to decide how you want to run this little backyard business. It’s your property, and your bell tent, and each market is completely unique. The most important thing is to put yourself in the shoes of your ideal guest and design a space and customer service experience that align.\n\nInterested in becoming a canvas bell tent Airbnb host?\n\nWhatever you do, don’t forget the guestbook. You’ll treasure it for years to come."
