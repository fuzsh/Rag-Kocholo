The systems and structure at JAG allow me to give my clients a high level of service. A team atmosphere where we help each other.\n\nHow Long Have You Called North Carolina Home?\n\nMy family moved from Buffalo, NY to NC when I was in the 2nd grade.\n\nIf You Had Unlimited Time and Resources, How Would You Spend Your Days?\n\nI would still be a Realtor and help people become homeowners. I would volunteer at my local charities. I would also serve in more demanding roles at my Realtor Association and train new agents.\n\nWhat’s Your Favorite Local Restaurant?\n\nRudinos Rooftop. I love sitting on the rooftop on a warm day, enjoying good food and friends.\n\nThe Cesar salad and margarita flatbread pizza are my favorites. They have a good variety of local beers on tap, and everyone knows my name.\n\nHow Would You Describe Yourself in One Word, and Why?\n\nFun- I love having a good time with my friends and family.\n\nAsheville or Wilmington?\n\nWilmington. Blue water, close to the Beach, and sunny days.\n\nWhat Causes/Charities Do You Care About?\n\nDorcas Ministries – sponsor a shelf at their food pantry.\n\nDesigned for Joy – Corporate Sponsor and Shelf sponsor\n\nWho are the People (and Pets) that Keep You Motivated?\n\nMy sons- Aiden and Liam.\n\nRachel was making my selling/buying homes easy and smooth transactions. Carolina T.\n\nRachel was great I have already referred her to others. With my crazy work hours she was always available to answer my many questions. I definitely recommend her. Veronica R.\n\nRachel was fantastic to work with. I've worked with her twice now, once as a first time home buyer then later as a seller to sell that house. Each time she was knowledgable, organized, thoughtful, professional and very patient with my many questions (Sorry Rachel!!!) She also has a fantastic list of contacts and resources I was able to tap into for pre/post sale needs like home inspections, repairs, painting etc. Rachel is an absolute asset.
