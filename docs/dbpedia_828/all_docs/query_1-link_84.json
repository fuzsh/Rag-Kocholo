        "text": "Myrtle Beach Golf Course Homes\n\nHave you ever walked out on your back porch with your morning coffee and gazed at an expansive view of perfectly manicured green grass carpet...with flowers blooming, palmetto trees waving in the breeze, and the smell of magnolias or dogwood in the air?\n\nIf you lived in a Myrtle Beach golf course home, this would be a familiar sight to you. Whether you play the game or just want an awe-inspiring, peaceful, and often secure neighborhood, you'll find a lot to love when you choose to live in a golf community.\n\nMyrtle Beach and the Grand Strand have an average of 100 plus golf courses at any given time, and most all of them have homes and condos woven into the plan. Many are gated, and offer a safety factor you won't find in any other location. Homes can range from the very finest multi-million dollar mansions to golf condos you can buy for under $100,000. Many are outside city limits and offer a much lower property tax and insurance rate, although the ones close to the beach will have amenities that can bring a good rental income if you want that.\n\nIn a word, the variety of homes on a golf course in Myrtle Beach are endless, and all you need to do is tell us what you have in mind. We can just about guarantee that perfect property is waiting patiently for you to find it.\n\nBelow are some distinctions we can offer if you'd like to do the groundwork search yourself:\n\nLuxury Golf Course Homes\n\nGrande Dunes Homes (on and near the beach)\n\nHomes in The Dunes Club (on and near the beach)\n\nArrowhead Golf Course Homes\n\nHome in Pawleys Plantation\n\nWillbrook Plantation Golf Course Homes\n\nLegends Golf Homes\n\nAffordable Golf Homes Near the Beach\n\nBarefoot Resort Homes\n\nHomes in Pine Lakes Golf Course\n\nGreat Golf and Tennis Family Communities\n\nPrestwick Golf and Tennis Homes\n\nPrince Creek Homes for Sale\n\nSearch All Golf Course Condos in Myrtle Beach\n\nMyrtlewood Golf Villas\n\nYacht Club Villas at Barefoot\n\nBarefoot Resort Condos and Townhomes\n\nGive us a call and we'll give you some ideas of the best places to find a golf course home at the beach that best fits your lifestyle and your budget.
