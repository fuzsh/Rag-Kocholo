        "text": "In the pages of this 43rd edition of Resilience, you will find the voices of community members who are living this reality through vulnerability, stark honesty, and self-evaluation. By sharing their passions and pains, they offer us intimate access to their relationships with the land. Through their messages and gifts, we are reminded of what is important in this life and what we stand to lose. As an ecological researcher, I find sanctuary in the pages of this issue of Resilience. After years of quantifying and objectifying biodiversity loss as numbers, figures, and facts, I feel sudden rushes of repressed sorrow and anger as I read this issue’s stories and pour over its artwork. Creating a space for the expression of emotionality around our climate and biodiversity crises is so incredibly important–our selected storytellers in Resilience embody this space. Their narratives and imagery welcome you into their intimate experiences with nature."
