        "text": "Jack Franklin Davis, Sr., age 76, a lifelong resident of Pike County, Alabama, galloped at the gun and crossed the finish line Friday, July 24, 2020, at home surrounded by family. A graveside service will be held, Sunday, July 26, 2020, at 3 p.m. in Green Hills Memorial Cemetery with Pastor Jim Powell officiating. Serving as pallbearers will be Scott Dunn, Dave Sikes, Wayne Davis, Paul Davis, Julius Pittman, and Mitchell Harris. Honorary pallbearers will be Robert “Rob” E. Chancey, III, Bennie “Bo” Lee Pritchett, and members of the Pike County Cattlemen’s Board. Visitation will be Sunday from 1 -3 p.m. at Green Hills Funeral Home.\n\n“Big” Jack leaves big boots to fill. He is appropriately likened to one of his passions ─ the foundation bred, sturdy quarter horse. The legions of quarter horse lineage offer their own traits and talents, similar to the lines of the Davis family. If Big Jack were assigned his own registration it might be true to the traits of an old Harlan horse ─ hardworking with unmistakable grittiness, a big buck, a stout conformation, a likable yet tough disposition, and a calm and easy gait. Big Jack carried on his withers the workload of a determined rancher and farmer from sunrise to sunset. Like a good workhorse, he put his head down and ploughed through the days working chicken houses and raising commercial cattle. Only once did he explore the meaning of vacation, that one time, when he spent a day and night at Panama City Beach. True to the quarter horse breed, Big Jack was loyal and committed to his trade. He was a valued, founding member of the Pike County Cattlemen’s Association and a lifelong member of the American Quarter Horse Association. And in cowboy fashion, with his boots and hat to go, Big Jack is on his “Ride,” as sung by one of country’s greats, “…And I’ll tip my hat and bid farewell. And lift my song into the air that I learned at the dusty fair. Sit tall in the saddle, hold your head up high. Keep your eyes fixed where the trail meets the sky and live like you ain’t afraid to die. And don’t be scared, just enjoy your ride...”\n\nMr. Davis is survived by his wife of 55 years, Judy S. Davis; son, Jack Franklin Davis, Jr.; grandson, Jack “Trey” Franklin Davis, III; step-grandsons, Hunter Motes (Amanda) and Halston Motes; brother, Roy R. Davis (Sandy); sisters, Sarah D. Allen (Joe Bob), Judy Chancey, and Alice Williford; sisters-in-law, Winnie Davis and Willo Jean Davis; numerous nieces, nephews, and cousins; and special family friend, Bennie “Bo” Lee Pritchett. He was preceded in death by his parents, Esker L. Davis, Sr. and Sally C. Davis; son, Jeffrey “Jeff” Davis; and brothers, Esker L. Davis, Jr. and Hubert C. Davis, Sr.\n\nThe family wishes to extend many thanks to the staff of Encompass Home Health and Hospice Care and Nicki Bailey. In lieu of flowers, charitable contributions can be made in his honor to the Pike County Cattlemen’s Foundation (PO Box 1308 Troy, AL 36081) or to Murphy’s Chapel Methodist Church C/O Brenda Peacock (2032 CoRd 7735 Troy, AL 36081). Friends and family can sign the guestbook online at www.greenhillsfuneralhome.net. The staff of Green Hills Funeral Home is honored to serve the Davis family."
