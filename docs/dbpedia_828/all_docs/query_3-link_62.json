        "text": "Immerse yourself in art at Blue Ridge Highlands Arts Depot\n\nFolk art, clay, textiles, portraiture, jewelry, oil, acrylic, watercolor and mixed media painting and more are showcased in this historic 1860-era freight station, and now known as The Arts Depot. Visit three galleries with rotating shows, and seven resident artists in their working studios who invite you to interact with them. The Depot also serves as the home of the Appalachian Center for Poets and Writers.\n\nGet lost, metaphorically, that is, at The Channels State Forest\n\nThe Great Channels are a one-of-a-kind maze of boulders and crevices in the Channels Natural Area Preserve, a Virginia best-kept secret and most singular natural wonders. Hikers can wind their way through a 20-acre sandstone labyrinth formed more than 400 million years ago during the last ice age. Pick up a map at the Abingdon Visitor Center and prepare to be wowed by what you’ll see as you trek through areas that have only been open to the public for little more than a decade.\n\nIt's always game time at JJ’s Restaurant and Sports Bar\n\nWhen it’s time for lunch, head to JJ’s – where you’ll feel like one of the locals. Not just a restaurant, not just a sports bar, JJ’s uses only the freshest locally grown ingredients and prepares comfort food at affordable prices. Try their classic burger, the catfish dinner or one of their vegetarian options, as well as weekend specials that will make your mouth water. A full bar has 21 rotating beers on tap. Dine in – or stop by and pick up one of their mouthwatering Picnic Pick-Ups.\n\nSee the Southwest Virginia Cultural Center & Marketplace\n\nRooted deep in history, this area’s culture is authentic, distinctive, and alive. Experience the birthplace of American Country music at the headquarters of the Crooked Road, Virginia's Heritage Music Trail. Every week, live music takes the center stage and showcases the region’s traditional and mountain music. The Southwest Virginia Cultural Center & Marketplace is your gateway to discovering the unique people, places, and stories of the most beautiful region in America, offering a vibrant culture of tradition, music and craft.\n\nDinner is always a good idea at Bone Fire Smokehouse & Musictorium\n\nDinner plans should include a true smokehouse, offering delicious smoked meats and unique Southern high-country sides. Bone Fire leaves the decision to “sauce or not” up to individual tastes but tempts diners with a variety of homemade original-recipe options. The location, in the former Withers Hardware Store in historic downtown Abingdon, provides a unique setting that complements the quality food, excellent service and great live original music. Popular among residents and tourists alike, Bone Fire has been recognized regionally and nationally for their excellent smoked meats.\n\nGet your rest at The Martha Washington Inn & Spa\n\nEnjoy a complimentary glass of port at the front desk before retiring to one of the 63 rooms and suites at the inn, all featuring their own character and personality. Built in 1832 for General Robert and Sarah Buchanan Preston and their nine children, much of the architectural integrity of this historic landmark has been meticulously preserved for more than 150 years. Don’t miss the rare and elaborate Dutch-baroque grandfather clock, imported from England and measuring over nine feet tall, that now resides in the Edith Wilson Parlor. Check in to the Spa and enjoy a therapeutic float in the indoor saltwater pool for a truly decadent end to a busy day.\n\nDay 2: Explore the region"
