        "text": "It looks like there’s going to be quite a few more heartbreaks on Dan + Shay’s map this summer.\n\nThe country-pop twosome just announced they’re extending their ‘Heartbreak On The Map Tour’ with 30 new concert dates with special guests Jake Owen and Dylan Marlowe from July through September.\n\nThat includes gigs at Syracause’s Empower FCU Amphitheater on Friday, July 26 and Long Island’s Jones Beach Theater on Saturday, Aug. 10.\n\nPrior to that, “The Voice” judges will conduct their previously announced first leg of the tour starting Feb. 29.\n\nOn the initial run, the “10,000 Hours” singers will swing into Newark, NJ’s Prudential Center on Friday, April 12.\n\nHowever, if you prefer your country music outdoors, you can pick up tickets for all summer 2024 ‘Heartbreak On The Map Tour’ concerts as soon as today.\n\nAlthough inventory isn’t available on Ticketmaster for the summer shows until Friday, Feb. 23, fans who want to ensure they have tickets ahead of time can purchase on sites like Vivid Seats before tickets are officially on sale.\n\nVivid Seats is a secondary market ticketing platform, and prices may be higher or lower than face value, depending on demand.\n\nThey have a 100% buyer guarantee that states your transaction will be safe and secure and will be delivered before the event.\n\nDan and Shay 2024 tour schedule\n\nA complete calendar including all tour dates, venues and links to buy tickets for ‘The Heartbreak On The Map Tour’ can be found below.\n\n*Note: All newly announced tour dates are in bold.\n\nDan and Shay set list\n\nPrior to the tour — but after the album release — Dan and Shay played a pair of shows in September 2023.\n\nHere’s what they brought to the stage at their final gig last year, courtesy of Set List FM:\n\n“01.) “10,000 Hours”\n\n02.) “Alone Together”\n\n03.) “All to Myself”\n\n04.) “What Keeps You Up at Night”\n\n05.) “Make or Break”\n\n06.) “Nothin’ Like You”\n\n07.) “Keeping Score”\n\n08.) “From the Ground Up”\n\n09.) “You”\n\n10.) “Lean on Me” (Bill Withers cover)\n\n11.) “Lying”\n\n12.) “Save Me the Trouble”\n\n13.) “Always Gonna Be”\n\n14.) “Steal My Love”\n\n15.) “How Not To”\n\n16.) “Island Time”\n\n17.) “Glad You Exist”\n\n18.) “Bigger Houses”\n\n19.) “I Should Probably Go to Bed”\n\n20.) “Speechless”\n\n21.) “19 You + Me”\n\n22.) “Tequila”\n\nDan and Shay new music\n\nOn Sept. 15, Dan and Shay dropped their fifth studio album “Bigger Houses.”\n\nComprised of 12 radio-friendly tracks, the pair straddle the line of pop and country yet again.\n\nAfter a few listens, our team gravitated toward the feel-good breakup anthem “Breakin’ Up With A Broken Heart,” the endlessly catchy “Save Me The Trouble” and the dance floor ready “Heaven + Back.”\n\nStill, for our money, the boot scooting “We Should Get Married” is easily the album standout you’ll be blasting on repeat once you give it a spin.\n\nWant to check “Bigger Houses” out? You can find the record here.\n\nDan + Shay special guests\n\nOn the winter spring run, the “10,000 Hours” singers will be joined by opening acts Ben Rector and Hailey Whitters.\n\nThen, come summer, Jake Owen and Dylan Marlowe are set to take over feature act duties.\n\nTo acquaint yourself with their sounds, we recommend checking out their most-streamed songs on Spotify here:\n\nBen Rector: “Brand New”\n\nHailey Whitters: “Everything She Ain’t”\n\nJake Owen: “Barefoot Blue Jean Night”\n\nDylan Marlowe: “All About It”\n\nCountry stars on tour in 2024\n\nCountry music fans, this is your year.\n\nHere are just five huge country tours you’ll want to bust your cowboy hat and boots out for these next few months.\n\n• George Strait with Chris Stapleton\n\n• Luke Combs\n\n• Tyler Childers\n\n• Zach Bryan\n\n• Kenny Chesney"
