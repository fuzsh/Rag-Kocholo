        "text": "What was your favorite memory from your Sea Island Wedding?\n\nOh, there are just so many, but we both say our favorite memory is the sparkler exit. It was truly spectacular and a perfect way to end such a wonderful day.\n\nHow did you hear about Sea Island?\n\nI grew up coming to Sea Island.\n\nIf you grew up coming here, what is your favorite past Sea Island memory?\n\nI always loved driving onto Sea Island and seeing The Cloister over looking the marsh. To me, the first glimpse of The Cloister was magical and was a symbol for the fun times and memories that were to come. It still stands true today.\n\nWhat was the inspiration for your décor/theme of your wedding?\n\nWe wanted a wedding that would feel romantic, fun and slightly eclectic. The wedding design team at Sea Island and the floral team at The Vine knew exactly what we wanted and just how to achieve it. The flowers were exquisitely unusual with soft hues of pale peach and blush, greens, and blues, the tables varied in linens, chargers, and décor as to not feel uniform.\n\nAfter the wedding was over, were you pleased with the details? How would you describe your experience at Sea Island?\n\nLooking back, we are very pleased. The details we requested were perfectly implemented, we wouldn’t change a thing!\n\nFrom our first meeting with Kellie Ryan and the Sea Island wedding team, we were confident they would create the wedding day we had envisioned. This confidence made the entire planning process enjoyable and fun. Our wedding day was seamless. The memories Thomas and I have from our day are filled with love and joy!"
