        "text": "Kids Across America (KAA) joined Elevate Branson (a non-for-profit in Branson, Mo., that addresses the root causes of poverty through access to resources, relationships, and a network of support that provides hope, dignity, and meaningful work) for its annual Summer Bash Block Party for the Branson community on June 12. More than 200 attendees enjoyed live music, games, inflatables, a picnic dinner and community fellowship.\n\nStudents from Higher Ground (HG), KAA’s two-year leadership program, served dinner, set up and facilitated the inflatables, games, and a climbing wall for attendees to enjoy. This outreach served as the capstone for the students after a week of servant leadership training.\n\n“The perception is that you have to leave the country to do mission work,” explained Jenson Newton, HG Director. “Through HG, we want to show campers various mission opportunities right here in the US.\n\nStudents going through Year 1 of HG not only take a deep dive into the Bible, but they also learn how to communicate biblical truth with people and learn outreach principles.\n\nPrior to event set-up, 14 HG students toured Elevate Branson and learned about its heart for all people to reach their full potential, as well as the assorted services it offers residents.\n\nHG student Kayden Davis, a high school student from Austin, appreciated the chance to learn and grow through this experience. She connected with one of woman attending and was able to listen to her story, encourage and pray for her.\n\n“My experience at HG and Elevate Branson literally makes me want to do more,” Kayden said.\n\nEven though she had some volunteering and ministry outreach under her belt, Kayden is returning to Austin pumped and ready to serve others in her own community.\n\nMore than 200 volunteers from two churches, James River Church and South Haven Baptist Church, came to Kids Across America on Saturday, April 27, to volunteer prepping camp for summer staff and campers. Volunteers power washed boats and buildings, raked leaves, painted cabins, sanded down vehicles, organized and tagged merchandise in the KAA store—K-Kloset.\n\n“Their service was a tremendous blessing and provided much-needed labor to accomplish tasks necessary to prepare camp for campers,” explained Randy Odom, KAA president and CEO. “When our summer staff arrive, they can focus on programming and ministry, instead of cleaning or raking leaves.”\n\nBoth churches regularly volunteer service hours at schools and area non-profit organizations. “Our goal [at James River Church) is to find a Christ-serving partner in the community to help with time and energy, as well as financially. Our hope would be monthly to bring a $25,000 value in labor and $25,000 in supplies/resources to a need, property, or an opportunity,” shared Chuck Greenway, James River Church community care pastor.\n\nScarlett O’Farrell, a member of Southaven Baptist Church, who assisted with painting cabins says volunteer outings such as this are a great opportunity to fellowship with your church friends. But more than that, they provide a chance to contribute to a place that’s going to change lives.\n\nWhile KAA was blessed by these selfless weekend warriors, we hope their hearts were impacted just as much. Pastor Greenway shared that they hope volunteers leave with an awareness what’s happening in the Kingdom, how families that are being impacted, and how they can be a part of it.\n\n“I had heard about kids across America but never been here,” shared Bryce Hargis, co-director of James River Youth. “It is pretty breathtaking you hear about the history and how many lives it’s touched over the years it’s pretty incredible.”\n\nVolunteering at KAA is just one way individuals, families, churches and businesses can impact lives for Jesus! To learn more about volunteering, please contact Alex Krejci at 417-331-0559 or [email protected].\n\nWhen Niyah came to KAA for the first time three years ago, she felt alone—as if it was on her to figure out life all. She definitely did not know Jesus and certainly did not have time to help others when she was barely keeping her head above water. One of her mentors thought KAA would be helpful. “That was my first time to camp, and it changed me,” reflects Niyah.\n\nShe found so much in that first week at KAA. Niyah found a safety net, and most importantly, she found Jesus. Two years later, her mentor approached her again—this time to encourage her to attend KAA’s leadership development program, Higher Ground (HG).\n\nLast summer, she spent a week at HG 1 learning how to study and seek answers in scripture, communicate biblical truth, share their learning, as well having the opportunity to flex those new skills during local outreach near camp. Through that experience Niyah says she learned that “to be a great leader, first, you have to be a great follower.”\n\nSince returning to her home city, she no longer feels alone. Instead, she goes on outreach trips with her youth group to area neighborhoods to pass out sandwiches, encourage and pray with kids her age, so they know they are not alone. “HG gave me the boldness to serve,” Niyah says.\n\nIn just a couple of weeks Niyah will attend HG 2, where she will spend two full weeks soaking in God’s Word and how to apply it to life, being encouraged by fellow HG students and leadership staff, participating in the new HG Work Program by interning/job shadowing at camp, and assisting with a KAA Connect outreach in Little Rock.\n\nMinistry can be messy—especially youth ministry. First, you are dealing with fallen people. Secondly, you work with young men and women who are still trying to figure things out. Satan will use every trick up his sleeve to keep them fallen. But God’s mercy endures.\n\nDavid Greer from La Habra, in East LA, California has been bringing kids to KAA since 2016, many of them unchurched. This summer, he brought a small group. More than half had never stepped foot in a sanctuary or been exposed to the Gospel.\n\nOne young man, he brought, came with a huge chip on his shoulder. He resisted camp culture, was hot tempered, and stubborn. He was having problems with other campers all week.\n\nDavid sat down to counsel with him, and the young man opened up.\n\n“I’ve never been to a camp,” he explained. “I know it’s supposed to be a Christian camp. I’m having fun, but I don’t think I believe in Jesus. Why should I believe in him? My life is hard.”\n\nDavid listened and let him know that those were valid questions, but the reason life is hard is because he was a byproduct of living a fallen life in the city. He prayed with the young man, asking God to reveal Himself, and reminded him of Roman 8:28—”all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.”\n\nA few hours later, that young man asked Jesus into his heart. Then, Satan tried to disrupt it. Not long after he had accepted Christ, the camper was attacked by some other campers. He couldn’t believe that even though he had just asked Jesus into his life that something awful like that could happen. David reminded him again of Romans 8:28.\n\nFighting is taken seriously at KAA, and camp leadership immediately separated the campers involved from the rest of camp. It seemed as if what was headed toward a great week for that young man and his friends had taken a disheartening left turn. They were, now, not allowed to participate in camp.\n\nThen, God spoke to KAA CEO and President Randy Odom’s heart. He felt called to walk with them and use camp to show them God’s love. He made a deal with them—if they would do what was right, then they would take them on the boats. That afternoon, the staff caring for them met anger and pain with grace and love.\n\nThis young man and his friends needed to be shown mercy and love through this. Camp leadership created a schedule for them–full of opportunities to not only to boat but also swim, use the new weight gym and much more. And the counselors on leadership spent special time ministering to them, loving them, pouring scripture into them, and praying with them.\n\nWhat was a terrible situation became an opportunity for God’s love and blessings. Despite Satan’s attack, at the end of the week, the entire group was ready to sign up for camp next year.\n\nAt the end, they were telling Randy and his staff that they loved them. In turn, the staff told the young men that they loved them, they would be praying for them and as men, are proud of them. God does not disappoint; He does work out things for good for those who love Him. These young men saw His promise come to be at camp.\n\nBefore they drove out of the camp gates, the young man asked David, his Kaleo, “This is an example of how God works things out for the good, isn’t it?”\n\nAddison is building her Kingdom network through KAA! She came for the first time ever to camp, and it is all because her mom heard about KAA and felt God speak to her that she needed to send Addison.\n\nShe LOVED swimming, going through the high ropes course, and tackling the Faith Pole—a 20-foot pole that campers climb and take a leap of faith to grab a trapeze bar.\n\n“Once I got to the top the pole was shaking, and I had trust I’m not going to fall,” Addison reflected. “My thought in that moment was that I am here at a church camp learning to trust God more. I felt like Peter when he took the first step on the water.”\n\nShe didn’t fall! Then she leaped for the trapeze and grabbed on, trusting Him the entire time.\n\nBut that wasn’t the best part of camp for her. Addison loved Cross Talk, worshipping with her fellow campers and seeing other teens her age find Jesus.\n\n“We get to interact with people our age that our fellow believers and that gives us a strong foundation of people we can go to when we need to,” she shared.\n\nCamp does more than present the Gospel to campers. For those who already know the Lord, there are tons of opportunities for growth in their walk, as well as practical life lessons taught by mature Christians strong in faith, living a Christ-like life. Since campers are only a couple of years away from adulthood, KAA 3 welcomes a Christian family, called a Covenant Family, to camp each summer to model and share how to live out your faith as an adult.\n\n“I really got a lot out of the Covenant Family talk on how to walk with Christ when you are dating or married and how to resist temptation,” Addison said.\n\nShe got so much out of one week at camp! The best part is that she is bringing camp back to Dallas. Addison also met four guys and two girls from her area that she didn’t know before camp. They learned that they all live close to one another and have made plans to meet up for fun activities, like bowling, and devotions.\n\n“We are all on the same path with our walk with Christ, so we want to help each other out,” Addison explained. “As a teenager, KAA sets the foundation that you need to walk forward with Christ.”\n\nEven though she is only 15, Addison is already taking college classes and later wants to attend veterinarian school. “I’m waiting to see where God takes me!”\n\nSeeds were planted in her life, and we can’t wait to see where he takes Addison and her new friends!\n\nFrances “Mama” Stone is no stranger in the kitchen. She loves preparing delicious and nutritious meals. For more than a decade, Mama Stone has closed her salon during the summer to serve in one of the four KAA kitchens. The KAA 1 kitchen is her favorite, so she was excited to hear it was reopening (after being closed due to the pandemic for two years).\n\nShe loves the little ones the best. They are precious to her. If they are homesick, she encourages them with motherly love to hang in there. Her kitchen know-how is just as apparent as her “momma” know how. She oversees cooking for 250 as if she were cooking for 2 or 5. Mama Stone and her small kitchen staff understand the importance of food ministry during camp and “keep the joy of the Lord present” while preparing the meals.\n\nShe and her kitchen crew begin around 5 am each day, making breakfast and prepping for lunch and dinner. Thursday lunch serve with fried chicken and mashed potatoes is one of the most lauded camp meals. By 9:30 am on Thursdays, they will have already fried 250 pieces of chicken!\n\nThe result keeps campers and staff coming back for more. For some of our campers, three square meals a day doesn’t happen often. “It is a blessing when they come into the dining hall,” Mama Stone described, “Their eyes get big as they’re looking to see what’s being served. It just blesses my heart!”\n\nWhat our critics say…\n\n“My favorite meal was the pasta!” – Isaac T.\n\n“At KAA, you will have lots of fun and learn more about God and you get to eat a lot good food.\n\n– Dyniah M.\n\n“The food here—don’t even get me started—the Booyah burgers, the pizza, the pasta—so good!” – Domonique S.\n\n“It was like a thanksgiving dinner. We had delicious chicken wings, mashed potatoes, green beans, and bread. Oh! It was so good!!” – Annabelle B.\n\n“KAA is an amazing place to encounter the love of Christ through everything—activities, food and people.” – Maggie L.\n\nCamper Testimony: Brian “JR”\n\nJR wanted to go to a camp but didn’t know of a good one, so he asked his pastor. His pastor could not think of one that came to mind, but “he knew one guy he could ask.” Wink. Wink. He prayed and asked God to lead him to a good camp for JR, and God led him to KAA.\n\nHis pastor told him to look it up online and see what he thought. It was a no brainer—the activities looked amazing—plus JR knew camp was the place to get back to God, shed old bad habits and create new life-giving ones.\n\nBefore he left for camp, he told his church family that he was going to come back as somebody they had never met before and that it was going to be a good thing. His pastor replied, “I’m ready for you to come back as somebody else I’ve never met before.”\n\nWhile JR was ecstatic to come, he was also nervous. He had never been to any camp before. Soon after arriving his worries melted away. God had picked the perfect camp for him! He got to try several new things for the first time—tubing, jumping on the blob, swinging off the trapeze at the pool, conquering the challenge course—plus some his favorite classics, like playing baseball and basketball.\n\nAll the activities were awesome, but it was the interactions he had with his counselors and fellow campers ministered to his heart. The one-on-one conversations about real life struggles softened his heart.\n\nBack home, JR, like many young people are living between two households—dealing with two sets of parents. He hated it, and his relationship with his dad and step-dad were equally lacking.\n\nBut he says, “God put the pieces back together at camp.”\n\nHis counselors spent extra time advising him, pouring scripture into him, praying with him, and encouraging him. Then, at Cross Talk, the last piece was put in place when JR rededicated his life to Jesus!\n\nHe couldn’t wait to go back and give his testimony to his church family. It is something to shout about. “No one knows the future,” JR shares, “but I can tell you right now, it is not going to be like my past. KAA is a place where you take a week out of your life and just give everything to God. Just one week can change you for a whole lifetime.”\n\nTriumph Over Adversity: Marlene Nash’s Breast Cancer Journey\n\nLife has a way of presenting us with unexpected challenges. For Marlene, that challenge came in the form of a breast cancer diagnosis. Below, Marlene shares her personal journey as a breast cancer survivor; sharing her experiences, fears, and victories in the hope that it can provide inspiration and support to those facing a similar battle.\n\nThe Diagnosis\n\nFrom the moment I heard those dreaded words, “You have breast cancer,” to the triumphant moment when I declared victory over this disease, my journey was one of resilience, strength, and unwavering hope.\n\nIt was a summer day in July 2023 when I first discovered something unusual in my breast. The fear that gripped me at that moment was indescribable. I had heard that when a lump feels hard, it’s more likely to be cancer, and that terrified me. I didn’t know what to do, but I knew I had to reach out to my doctor.\n\nHowever, the emotional turmoil left me paralyzed, unable to make that call. It took me a couple of days of prayer and self-reflection to gather the courage to contact my doctor. I realized that I needed to stop dwelling on negative thoughts and place my trust in God.\n\nMy doctor didn’t respond immediately, but that period of waiting allowed me to find some peace and solace. It was a reminder that sometimes we must let go and have faith that things will work out.\n\nAfter the initial contact with my doctor, a series of tests and appointments followed. My diagnosis was early-stage breast cancer, specifically ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Thankfully, it had not spread beyond its initial location, giving me hope for a positive outcome.\n\nDuring this time, I learned the importance of advocating for myself in the medical system. When I was initially scheduled for surgery months down the line, I knew I needed to push for an earlier date. My assertiveness paid off as my surgery date was moved up, emphasizing the significance of being proactive in your own healthcare.\n\nSurgery and Recovery\n\nI underwent a mastectomy, which involved the removal of my entire breast and some lymph nodes for further examination. It was a daunting experience, but I found comfort in the skilled hands of my surgeon, who was not only a medical professional but also a person of faith. His presence and expertise reassured me that I was in capable hands.\n\nThe recovery process came with its own set of challenges. I had to adapt to a new sleep position to avoid straining the surgical site. Activities were limited, and lifting my arms above my head was initially forbidden. It was a gradual journey towards healing, but my support system, including my family and coworkers, played a crucial role in helping me navigate this path.\n\nBreast cancer had touched my family before; my mother and sister had both battled the disease. Their resilience and strength served as a source of inspiration for me. My mother, who had chosen not to undergo breast reconstruction, showed me that beauty is not defined by appearances but by the strength of one’s spirit.\n\nThroughout this journey, I realized the importance of allowing others to support and care for me. My KAA family has been available and encouraging for anything I need and a great reminder to listen to my body and take it slow. Sometimes, we need to let go of our need to be self-reliant and accept help from those who genuinely care.\n\nLessons Learned\n\nReflecting on my breast cancer journey, I’ve discovered valuable lessons. Firstly, I’ve come to understand that our journeys may not be solely for us; they can serve as inspiration and hope for others. Secondly, the timing and outcome of our struggles are ultimately in the hands of God. Lastly, taking time to rest and care for ourselves is essential for healing and growth.\n\nMy breast cancer journey has been a rollercoaster of emotions, but it has also been a journey of self-discovery, strength, and faith. I hope that by sharing my story, I can offer support and encouragement to others who are facing similar challenges. Remember, you are not alone in this fight, and there is hope even in the darkest moments. Let go, have faith, and allow yourself the time to heal and grow. Together, we can triumph over adversity.\n\nKAA Elite was held for the second year at camp during sessions 2 and 8. KAA Elite is a special camp that provides a structured, empowering and encouraging time for coaches and their teams. Darius’s team from Dallas was eager to come again this year, because of the team bonding that took place last year. Not only did it impact his team throughout the year, but it also had a personal impact on him.\n\n“It really brought me closer to God. Some things I thought I couldn’t do I found that I could do here, and it helped me start caring about others on my team,” Darius shared. “I got a better experience with my team, and I left as a man of God and came back a man of God.”\n\nTogether, the team lifted weights, worked out on the field, scrimmaged, and did drills.\n\nIn addition to drills, 7 on 7 scrimmages, teams also go through some challenge courses that build stamina, mental and physical acuity, and maybe most importantly, trust in your teammates and God.\n\nOne such challenge is the Navy Seal Competition that features the quest to move a 35-lb rubber plate the length of the football field without allowing it to touch the ground. Sounds easy, right? Not so much. Members of each team must sit on the ground, passing it to the next. After the first in line hands off the plastic burden, he changes position to last, and it keeps rotating that way until the end zone is reached.\n\nThe weight is carried the entire challenge and cannot touch the ground. If it did, the team had to start over the challenge station where the lapse occurred. Following the plate exercise each team, had to run to two more stations to complete a 200-team push-up challenge, a 200-team squat challenge.\n\nOnce they conquered push-up and squat challenges, they ran back to the football field for the final challenge–to perfectly recite a scripture verse. Sounds easy, again, Right? Breath came a little harder by the time they reached the last challenge.\n\nWhen Davonta first learned what the Navy Seal Competition would entail, he wasn’t sure he wanted to participate. It seemed overwhelming—too hard. There was no way he could finish it. “Then, when we were going through it, we realized we could do it as a team. We could get through it together.”\n\nDavonta really liked working together and encouraging his teammates during KAA Elite.\n\nLike, Darias he’s taking more home than just a team-bonding experience. “KAA helped make me think more about doing better and just bringing my relationship closer to Christ.”\n\n“The vision of Kids Across America is to transform urban youth to impact their communities for Christ, but God’s vision is much grander than we can every conceive.”\n\nTesa’s mom learned about KAA and sent her to camp when she was 12. She remembers the bus ride up from Houston. She arrived and was surprised to learn it was a sports camp, because she didn’t play any sports. However, she discovered there was much more to it and dove into the bible studies, worship, and prayer. And she loved the praise dance team! Camp was a welcomed experience because she had never worshipped with kids her age. The church she attended at the time did not have any other kids her age. While she had a relationship with Jesus, camp sparked a thirst for God’s word.\n\nFast forward 15 years. Tesa earned her degree in veterinarian medicine and moved to Maryland to work at a clinic. There she found her second calling: teaching English as a second language to immigrants from Ethiopia, El Salvador, and Haiti working at the clinic. Tesa didn’t want language to be a barrier for their success. Then she had an opportunity to visit Ethiopia through her church. While there, she felt God tug on her heart that she needed to be there. He gave her the vision to teach English and be a voice for those who do not have one. After much prayer, she stepped out in faith to move to a country where due to the substandard infrastructure, it is not uncommon to lose power and water for hours at a time.\n\nWith only knowing one person there, Tesa moved to Ethiopia in 2018 to teach English—a vital skill to be successful there. In fact, to advance to college after high school students must pass a standard exam in English. She learned that it was taught in the public schools, but the curriculum wasn’t quality and the teachers trying to teach it didn’t speak English either. Since discovering this need, Tesa’s ministry is focused on educating elementary school children and their teachers.\n\nShe launched her ministry All Children Count in 2020 when the public schools closed due the pandemic. All Children Count is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization providing children of low socioeconomic status education equality and equity through financial assistance, tutoring services, technology integration, educational resources, and school support.\n\nThis past year, All Children Count tutored 400 children and 80 teachers on ESL. It also hosts a pop-up library, since books, especially in English, are hard to get, as well as provides clothing, shoes, backpacks, and other essentials to 60 children annually.\n\n“The hope is that they see Christ in us and see the light shining through us,” explains Tesa. “We also want to see a change in the education system.” And Tesa says change is happening, although slowly.\n\nThen, God orchestrated something amazing. This past winter KAA CEO & President Randy Odom and his wife Kelandria traveled to Ethiopia on a mission trip. They happened to attend the church where Tesa goes. It’s unusual to encounter another American there, especially since the village Tesa lives in a remote town away from the capitol. So, after church, she went up to them to introduce herself. Quickly, the discovered the common bond of Kids Across America. It’s incredible to think the probability of this happening! “God had something in mind,” Tesa says. “It had to be something God ordained.”\n\nSince then, Tesa has reconnected with camp. The Odoms keep in contact to encourage and pray with her, and the KAA staff organized a book drive for the pop-up library. “The children will be excited,” she said. “Many people can’t afford to buy books. We’re grateful for KAA thinking of us! These books will give some our children to own a book for the first time.”\n\nOver the summer, Tesa was able to make a trip to the states and visited camp. As soon as she drove through the camp gates, memories began flooding back. She got visit KAA 2, where she was a camper. And as she remembers, “the cabins, the dining hall, everything looks the same.” She even remembered how the benches were stacked on the tables in the dining hall and couldn’t believe they were the same benches.\n\nWhile at camp, Tesa also had the opportunity to see how camp had grown since her time there and share her story of Kingdom impact with Kaleos and counselors. Russia Beaver served as one of her counselors and really had an impact on her. She noticed that Tesa was shy and introverted and helped her to express herself. When Tesa met with the staff, she emphasized the importance of ministering to the “quiet ones” like her. As she put it, “They have a lot to say!”\n\n“Often in life, you stumble into a God moment,” said Randy. “That was such a moment when we met Tessa in Ethiopia. Nothing is by chance. God used this moment to remind me that it might be Kids Across America, but we have an impact across the world. We never know where these kids are going or who they are going to become to change the world. Some plant, some water, but God brings forth the increase.”\n\nThrough this providential connection, Tesa is now connected with another former Higher Ground camper who is also in Ethopia doing mission work. The vision of Kids Across America is to transform urban youth to impact their communities for Christ, but God’s vision is much grander than we can ever conceive.\n\nTo learn more or get involved with All Children Count, you can go to allchildrencountinternational.com and click on “get involved.”\n\nAre you ready for an unforgettable summer?

Last year she came for the first time and loved meeting new friends, the FUN activities and especially Cross Talk. That was her favorite part. In fact, she couldn’t get it off her mind all year long.\n\n“Camp would not get off my mind,” India shared. I was so excited to come back and see Crosstalk and meet new people who love God.”\n\nThis summer she made a BOLD decision for Christ and asked Jesus into her heart.\n\nIndia shared that during a cabin devotional on sin and when Miss Candace, her counselor prayed, she knew then how much she needed Jesus.\n\n“I knew it was time to ask Jesus into my heart, and later that day I rang the bell,” India said.\n\nPraise God for moving in the hearts of kids and teens this summer. Lives are being transformed. Kids are being redirected from the world to the hope of Jesus! She loves learning about her Savior.\n\nThank Him also for canoes, quesadillas, and campfires! India had a week to remember and was surrounded by people who love Jesus.\n\nShe sums up her experience like this: “KAA is a Christian camp with a bunch of kids that want to get closer to God.”"
