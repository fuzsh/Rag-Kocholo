        "text": "On Monday, April 8, 2024, a total solar eclipse will come to North America. This cosmic event will be visible from within a narrow route, called the path of totality, which will extend through Mexico, the United States, and Canada.\n\nA total solar eclipse happens when the moon passes between the sun and earth, completely blocking the face of the sun. People viewing the eclipse from locations where the moon's shadow completely covers the Sun, known as the path of totality, will experience a total solar eclipse. The sky will become dark, as if it were dawn or dusk. Weather permitting, people along the path of totality will see the sun's corona, or outer atmosphere, which is usually obscured by the bright face of the sun."
