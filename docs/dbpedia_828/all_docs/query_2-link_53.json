        "text": "What is it? This expansive garden is home to a cool 8,500 plant species, zen lakes and lush lawns.\n\nWhy go? Melbourne is lucky enough to have its Royal Botanic Gardens smack bang in the middle of the city. Being so accessible, the gardens are ideal for a picnic or even just somewhere different to eat your workday lunch. The expansive grounds means you’re rarely forced to awkwardly face off with someone for a good spot of turf.\n\nDon't miss: Hopping on a boat for Punting on the Lake or having a picnic in the gardens. Around Ornamental Lake seems like the obvious scenic choice for your go-to picnic location, but that’s exactly why you should think again. Explore the gardens thoroughly and we reckon you’ll find your favourite new al fresco nook in no time. If you forget your lunch, make a beeline for Jardin Tan for Vietnamese cuisine.\n\nWhat is it? The National Gallery of Victoria, the grand modernist building that sits pretty on St Kilda Road, is also Australia's oldest and most popular art museum.\n\nWhy go? The NGV brings major international art exhibitions to Melbourne, showcasing classic works of art alongside hot contemporary talents. In the past, we've seen Van Gogh, Hokusai, MC Escher, Dior, Dali, Warhol, works from New York City's MoMA gallery, and the massive free NGV Triennial.\n\nDon't miss: Given the near-constant rotation of fabulous special exhibitions at the NGV, you’d be forgiven for neglecting the equally impressive (free!) permanent collection. Next time you visit, make sure you spend a good few minutes with Dosso Dossi’s portrait of Lucrezia Borgia, Duchess of Ferrara (1519-1530). It’s one of the only known portraits of the illegitimate daughter of Pope Alexander VI, which makes it, as NGV curator Laurie Benson explains, “a unique record of one of the most famous women in history”.\n\nAdvertising\n\nWhat is it? Hot air balloons aren’t just for the countryside – they fly over Melbourne's pretty city too.\n\nWhy go? If you can handle dragging yourself out of bed well before dawn then the flight really is worth it. Unsurprisingly, there are not a lot of people around at sunrise, and drifting over the city in the dawn light feels surreal. Where you start, travel and land in your balloon is always a mystery as the flights are determined by each day’s conditions – meaning you might see some of your favourite Melbourne locations from above or discover some new gems.\n\nDon't miss: A flight over the Yarra Valley is equally as impressive.\n\nWhat is it? Justifiably one of Victoria’s most popular tourist destinations, the Great Ocean Road snakes all along the southwest coast of the state, starting in Torquay (1.5 hours from the CBD) and finishing up just before Warrnambool.\n\nWhy go? This winding stretch of road provides ample opportunity to reconnect with the ocean, the bush and the sounds and sights of nature whether driving, walking, horseriding, surfing, sailing or cycling.\n\nDon't miss: It's about a four-hour drive without stops, but heed our warning: you'll definitely want to stop. There's just too much happening along the coast not to. Take a day trip, stay the weekend or just pack up and move there – there's plenty going on down the Great Ocean Road.\n\nAdvertising\n\nWhat is it? Queen Victoria Market is an open-air market that's packed with veteran stallholders who are passionate about fresh produce (and are happy to tell you about it).\n\nWhy go? It's popular with locals as their go-to for fresh fruit, veggies, meat and an outstanding variety of dairy and smallgoods, but it has also become something of a 'must visit' for tourists. And why not? With a huge number of stalls selling clothes, accessories and other bric-a-brac, the market has evolved into more than just the place to get your weekly shop. Pro-tip: be mindful of the market's opening hours before visiting as it's closed Monday and Wednesday.\n\nDon't miss: Hot jam doughnuts from the American Doughnut Kitchen van. These doughies should be in a museum: they’ve got just the right amount of oily crunch, the dough is stuffed with a sticky and sweet red dollop of rasp-plum jam, and they’re covered quite liberally with sugar.\n\nWhat is it? In a city that's world-famous for its laneways and arcades, Degraves Street is arguably one of the best.\n\nWhy go? It's a Parisian-looking lane that connects Flinders Lane and Flinders Street and boasts a bunch of cafés with on-street dining. We'd suggest settling in for a glass of red before picking up a nifty gift (or something for yourself) from the artisan stationery store Il Papiro.\n\nDon't miss: A scoop of incredibly tasty housemade gelato from Pidapipo.\n\nAdvertising\n\nWhat is it? A massive display of the animal kingdom right outside Melbourne's CBD.\n\nWhy go? You can watch the world flutter by at the butterfly room, visit the colourful residents of the aviary and trek through the Trail of the Elephants to visit the close-knit family of big-eared beauties. Melbourne Zoo has all the animal action. There’s always something going on here, from keeper talks and zoo high teas. Be sure to say hi to the lion pride before you leave (follow the roars).\n\nDon't miss: For the wildest night of your life book in for a Roar ‘n’ Snore – a zoo sleepover where you camp in the historic elephant exhibition.\n\nWhat is it? This glitzy 1920s restaurant by Andrew McConnell in the glamorously retooled Art Deco beauty Cavendish House is serving up sophisticated and delicious versions of its namesake.\n\nWhy go? If you love Gimlets, you likely won't have had one this good before. Made with Tanquerey gin, a three-citrus cordial, a splash of Moscato and Geraldton wax, it's the perfect drink to have in hand while taking in the glittering surrounds and pretending you're in The Great Gatsby.\n\nDon't miss: Grabbing a seat at the bar to head bartender Cameron Parish and his team working their magic. And if you're not sure what to get next, chat to Parish – he'll figure out your perfect next sip.\n\nAdvertising\n\nWhat is it? A venue within Melbourne Museum, Bunjilaka was developed to empower Aboriginal people to interpret their own cultural heritage for both Indigenous and non-Indigenous people.\n\nWhy go? Here you can celebrate the vibrant cultures of Indigenous Australia with exhibitions about traditional performances, storytelling rituals and artworks. It's a museum must-see.\n\nDon'tmiss: The Deep Listening space, where you can listen to Victorian Aboriginal people telling the stories of their culture from the time of creation to today.\n\nWhat is it? Lune Croissanterie's croissants earned the venue the top spot on Time Out Melbourne's best patisseries list, and they were dubbed \"the world's best\" by a writer for the New York Times. Not a bad gig for brother-sister team Kate and Cameron Reid.\n\nWhy go? As with many celebrated Melbourne eateries (ahem, Chin Chin), such high accolades often mean crowds. The lines snake out of the door nearly every day, in fact. But does Lune really cut the mustard? In short, yes. Created in a climate-controlled lab, Lune croissants are almost mathematically perfect: crisp and golden with visible layers of delicate pastry. This isn’t really so unusual when you consider the fact that Kate Reid used to be a racing car engineer.\n\nDon't miss: The plain croissants are the OG, but we're also particularly fond of the almond croissant. Lucky for us, Lune also opened an outpost in Melbourne's CBD.\n\nAdvertising\n\nWhat is it? Luxury hotel Sofitel boasts one of the best views of the city... in its swanky sky-high bathrooms.\n\nWhy go? We're not even exaggerating here. Sofitel's loo is not so much a toilet as a powder room: golden drapes frame the floor-to-ceiling windows, from which you can see all the way out to the Dandenongs, as well as the Royal Botanic Gardens, the Shrine of Remembrance, the 'G and even out to the sea.\n\nDon't miss: While you're up there, consider having a cocktail at the luxe Atrium Bar on 35.\n\nWhat is it? Victoria's premier wine region, the Yarra Valley, is all rolling green hills, swaying vineyards and old farmhouses. Plus, it's less than an hour's drive from the CBD.\n\nWhy go? The cellar doors of the region's famous wineries are open every weekend, and the winery restaurants are becoming some of the most sought-after dining destinations out of Melbourne. Our picks of the region are TarraWarra Estate, Maddens Rise and Rochford Wines, but don't forget to fill up on some cheese from Yarra Valley Dairy while you're there.\n\nDon't miss: The free tastings at the Yarra Valley Chocolaterie and Ice Creamery. Seriously, do not miss this.\n\nAdvertising\n\nWhat is it? The Astor is an Art Deco cinema that's been in operation as a cinema since 1936. It's actually the last single-screen cinema of its kind in continuous operation in Melbourne.\n\nWhy go? Beautiful gold curtains frame the screen, and the entire experience feels like you've flashed back to old Hollywood. The theatre boasts a program of new and classic films in 35mm, 70mm and digital formats, and it's a cultural hub for movie fans, with double features, remastered classics, new and independent movies, film festivals and special events.\n\nDon't miss: Revel in the glory of this beautiful old relic with cheap tickets on special days throughout the week – but check with the venue directly.\n\nWhat is it? When a grand opera hits town, it’s more than likely going to the majestic, underground State Theatre – the stage is so big it’s the equivalent of eight suburban houses.\n\nWhy go? Look, we get it. Opera isn’t for everyone – but we insist you give it a shot. There are often stunning costumes, elaborate set designs and so much drama.\n\nDon’t miss: Trying to count all those tiny brass cups that have been nailed to the theatre’s ceiling. We’re heard there are about 75,000, but good luck fact-checking that.\n\nAdvertising\n\nWhat is it? OK, it seems obvious, but most visitors have never even seen a tram, let alone ridden on one. Melbourne’s tram network is a wondrous beast – the best part of all is that a huge chunk of it is free to ride if you stick to the city.\n\nWhy go? The tram network branches out from the city centre. It’s often easier to use trams than any other form of transport for those hopping between CBD attractions or visiting the inner suburbs.\n\nDon’t miss: Travelling north-south on the Route 96 tram. It’s one of our favourite tram routes, stretching from St Kilda to East Brunswick and going along Bourke Street in the city. At stop 16 (Kay/Nicholson St) you can try the world’s best croissants at Lune, or you can spot fairy penguins at St Kilda Beach at stop 145 (Acland St).\n\nWhat is it? Every year, thousands head to Melbourne Park to watch the superstars of tennis battle it out in the fierce summer heat for the southern hemisphere’s only Grand Slam tournament.\n\nWhy go? Even if you don’t make it to the arena, Birrarung Marr is abuzz with live entertainment and food stalls for the Australian Open Festival, where live screenings of matches are played on big screens.\n\nDon’t miss: If you’re a tennis fan, opt for a Ground Pass. This ticket won’t get you into the big arenas, but you’ll instead get access to all the smaller surrounding courts where up-and-coming tennis stars will play. Plus, the tickets start at only $59.\n\nAdvertising\n\nWhat is it? The pub staple features a crisp chicken schnitty coated in a layer of napoli sauce, slices of smoky ham, topped with a horde of melted cheese and grilled to perfection. Its vegetarian counterpart often substitutes the chicken with meaty eggplant or mock meat, and it's usually served with a side of chips or a salad for the “health-conscious”, or both.\n\nWhy go? The fried bird was actually voted Melbourne's favourite dish by Time Out’s readers in a survey conducted in 2020. Before we get into it though, it’s important to note the correct spelling and pronunciation: it’s parma with an ‘a’, not parmi with an ‘i’ - here’s looking at you Geelong, and the rest of the country. You know you’re all wrong.\n\nDon't miss: Not only is Melbourne now so parma-obsessed that it features on the menus of most pubs, but it’s also home to dedicated parma festivals and awards. Here are more of our favourite venues dishing up Melbourne’s best parmas.\n\nWhat is it? A Magic is the combination of steamed milk and a double ristretto, and it's basically just a flat white with two shots but with a more equal milk to coffee ratio. Be warned that you may get some raised eyebrows or confused looks if you order it anywhere outside of Melbourne.\n\nWhy go? Melbourne is a coffee city, we know this. You're basically guaranteed to never be more than a hundred metres from a good brew. But if you really want a special experience that you won't find elsewhere – and the bragging rights that come with it – getting a Magic is the way to do it.\n\nDon't miss: Trying a Magic from some of the best cafés in Melbourne. You can get them pretty much anywhere, but you might as well try one from the likes of Industry Beans, Captains of Industry or St Ali.\n\nAdvertising\n\nWhat is it? Adelphi Hotel's rooftop pool, which has swiftly become one of the most photographed pools in Melbourne.\n\nWhy go? Well, a glass-bottomed section of the pool actually cantilevers out over Flinders Lane, meaning you can spy all the tiny ant people scurrying along while you're submerged in water. After an upgrade in late 2017, the rooftop pool deck is looking as fresh as ever. You don't have to be a guest of the hotel, though you do have to pay. Grab a spritz and your beach towel, and you'll be golden.\n\nDon't miss: An overnight stay in the hotel itself. Located within a hulking 1938 building on the busy CBD hotspot that is Flinders Lane, the Adelphi Hotel is a nice landing spot for those who value edgy design, location and first-rate service.\n\nWhat is it? Victoria's favourite sport. Australian Rules Football was born here, and to this day the Melbourne Cricket Ground (known more colloquially as the 'G) is the best place to see it all go down.\n\nWhy go? It's a bloody good time, no matter what team you're barracking for. Rug up, get a pie, a hot jam doughnut and a beer, yell like a bastard, heckle the umpires and have a right old laugh at the little tackers having a crack during half-time.\n\nDon't miss: Seeing a game of AFLW, as well. The women’s league of the AFL hit the big time a few years back, and what better way is there to support the athletes than heading along to a game? The AFLW season starts in August and ends in November.\n\nAdvertising\n\nWhat is it? A whisky distillery located in Port Melbourne that’s churning out smooth, easy-drinking flavours that any dram drinker would enjoy.\n\nWhy go? The distillery itself is an airy and open warehouse space within easy walking distance of the city. The bar at the front is open to the public (try a whisky and tonic – you can thank us later) and a great space to catch up with friends. It is whisky-focused, as you'd expect, with Starward as well as other Australian spirits available and a few craft beers.\n\nDon’t miss: You can book tours of the distillery to learn how whisky is made, from barley to bottle. You can taste it at its various stages along the way too, as well as seeing up close the state-of-the-art equipment and hundreds of barrels ageing the precious liquid.\n\nWhat is it? The Toff in Town is one of the swankiest bars in town. Climb the stairs at vertical laneway Curtin House and you'll find a private booth bar to the left and an excellent band space to the right.\n\nWhy go? This cosy little red-curtained room has hosted a wealth of talent, both from home and from far away. It's a fun haunt and one that reeks of character in an already vibrant Melbourne scene. Get right up and sweaty at the foot of the stage or sit back and sample the menu of delicious eats and the extensive range of drinks on offer.\n\nDon't miss: Heading upstairs to the super popular Rooftop Bar for a drink among the city's rooftops.\n\nAdvertising\n\nWhat is it? The Abbotsford Convent began as a convent in the late 1800s and was also a commercial laundry, orphanage and aged care facility. These days, it’s a hub for artists, makers, community radio broadcasters and teachers – as well as a beautiful place to explore.\n\nWhy go? You can feel the weight of the past as soon as you step into the grounds and look up to the gothic spires of the convent. It's also an excellent place to roam, explore or just relax on the green hills and amongst the gardens.\n\nDon't miss: Checking out the work of local artists in the galleries or playing with the gorgeous animals at the Collingwood Children's Farm.\n\nWhat is it? This Diagon Alley-looking laneway boasts great food, shopping and some of Melbourne's best street art.\n\nWhy go? Laneways throughout the CBD regularly get a repaint, so it's worth checking in on some of our favourite street art spots (including AC/DC Lane, Croft Alley and the super popular Hosier Lane) numerous times throughout the year.\n\nDon't miss: Getting the best shot. If you want to take photos without people walking through your shot, we suggest waking up early.\n\nAdvertising\n\nWhat is it?About a two-hour drive from Melbourne is wildlife wonderland Phillip Island. Some 3.5 million people visit the island every year.\n\nWhy go?There are plenty of activities for families, couples and solo visitors, including a chocolate factory, wildlife parks full of native animals and of course, the nightly penguin parade. Motorheads flock to the island in their thousands for the Motorcycle Grand Prix in the spring.\n\nDon’t miss: The fairy penguin parade, when hundreds of the little guys come in from a hard day's fishing and waddle up the beach to their homes in the rocks.\n\nWhat is it? A huge inner-city garden located amidst Melbourne’s busy cityscape\n\nWhy go? You can take a stroll around the park and take in the natural landscape and historic sites, which are located throughout the gardens. There’s a model Tudor Village, Captain Cook’s 1755 family home uprooted from Yorkshire and reassembled here in the 1930s, a collection of similarly strange fountains, memorials and follies accumulated over the park’s 150 years.\n\nDon’t miss: A trip into the Conservatory. This Spanish Mission-style conservatory was opened way back in March 1930. It currently exhibits five floral displays annually, meaning it’s in full bloom all year round with a mix of hydrangeas, fuchsias, begonias, cyclamens and calceolarias all making an appearance at some point.\n\nAdvertising\n\nWhat is it? Australia’s own version of the Northern Lights – the Southern Lights, or the Aurora Australis.\n\nWhy go? Um, have you seen the photos!? The best time of year to see this dramatic light display is during winter and the equinox in September, and you need to go somewhere where 1) there’s an uninterrupted horizon view, and 2) a place that’s away from city lights. So try Point Lonsdale, Cape Schanck, Flinders, the south side of Phillip Island, Tidal River at Wilsons Promontory, Aireys Inlet or Anglesea.\n\nDon’t miss: It! The Aurora Australis, like its northern sister, is very difficult to predict. Patience is key here. Bring your camera (human eyes often can’t see the faint colour changes that happen during an aurora show, but DSLRs can) and wait.\n\nWhat is it? A magnificent old cultural landmark that houses an incredible amount of books, as well as several exhibitions and galleries with a lot of history. The library was established in 1856 and is a grand presence on Swanston Street with interior spaces to match.\n\nWhy go? You don't have to be a student or bookworm to enjoy the State Library. The beautiful building is a wonder just to explore and there's even a two-storey children's space where they can learn and play.\n\nDon't miss: If you want to take that Hogwarts-like photograph of the library head to the La Trobe Reading Room. The six-storey-high domed space is a beautiful sight to behold – head up to the second or third floor to take the best shot.\n\nAdvertising\n\nWhat is it? Westgate Park, located on the edge of the city in Port Melbourne, turns a delicious shade of pink every summer.\n\nWhy go? It’s pink! And before you ask, yes, it’s completely natural. It’s been turning pink every year since the summer of 2012/13, when a collection of hot temperatures, algae combinations, lack of rainfall and excessive sunlight came together like a perfect pink witch’s brew.\n\nDon’t miss: The pink colour. It happens in late summer and the colour can intensify as the water evaporates in the summer heat. Luckily, the pink colour has no impact on birdlife on the lake, who you’ll regularly see frolicking around the shoreline.\n\nWhat is it? A boat hire service out of Docklands that lets you take a five-metre-long boat out on the Yarra River.\n\nWhy go? You don’t need a boating licence to operate one, so it’s fun for all.\n\nDon’t miss: Go Boat is BYO. Boats come equipped with a built-in picnic table in the middle, meaning you can have lunch (and drinks) on the river.\n\nAdvertising\n\nWhat is it? As close as you'll come to a true secret garden, the Alfred Nicholas Memorial Gardens is located deep within the Dandenong Ranges.\n\nWhy go? Take a walk through the park and see the awesome canopy of mountain ash trees or take a picnic by the picturesque lake and quaint boathouse.\n\nDon’t miss: The park is home to a heap of Australian native flora, which changes all year round. In spring, the park is full of colour with flowering azaleas and cherry trees, while in autumn the park turns golden with the changing colours of the maples and beeches.\n\nWhat is it? A tennis ball-sized parcel of meat, cabbage and just the right amount of spice and served two ways: fried or steamed.\n\nWhy go? The South Melbourne Market dim sims are probably the best dim sims in the state. These massive morsels are a huge level up from the average tuck shop dimmie and they’ve become an icon of the southside indoor market, as the stall has been serving them for six decades.\n\nDon’t miss: These dimmies were destined to swim in soy and chilli sauce, so make sure to ask for some with your order and douse them to your heart’s content. No one’s judging you here.\n\nAdvertising\n\nWhat is it? The Bellarine, Melbourne’s “other” peninsula, has quietly transformed into a wine lover’s paradise.\n\nWhy go? The Bellarine has been producing wines since the 1980s, and frankly, we think it’s about time the rest of the world knew about it.\n\nDon’t miss: A stop at the cellar doors of Scotchmans Hill, Curlewis Winery or Basils Farm. There’s also the Whiskery for the spirits fans or Queenscliff Brewhouse for the beer fans.\n\nWhat is it? As the name suggests, Californian redwoods are indigenous to coastal California and the southwestern corner of Oregon in the US. Redwoods were planted down the coast in the Great Ocean National Park in the 1930s as well as a collection in the Warburton Valley.\n\nWhy go? These trees are distinguished by their extreme height (they can reach up to 115 metres tall) and their somewhat horizontal branches. They’re some of the oldest living organisms on Earth!\n\nDon’t miss: Walking through these plantations makes you feel tiny. The grid-like plantation in Warburton includes over 1,400 trees, all up to 55-metres tall.\n\nAdvertising\n\nWhat is it? While Naked for Satan's downstairs is a dark and moody affair, just one elevator ride to its rooftop will bring you to cracking views of the CBD.\n\nWhy go? For a city with such temperamental weather, we sure do love a rooftop bar. Our city is basically covered by them, but if you want to avoid the crowds of the city while still enjoying an incredible views, head up to Fitzroy for this sprawling view while enjoying a delicious tapas menu that's a cut above typical bar bites.\n\nDon't miss: The vast array of infused vodkas made in-house. Play it safe with flavours like blueberry, ginger or peach, or embrace a bit of spice with the Hot Ho (chilli and cinnamon) or Naked Bitch (chilli and cherry) infusions.\n\nWhat is it? Every January or February Melbourne kicks off its Chinese New Year celebrations, which often include traditional live music, food, firecrackers, street performers, martial artists and the traditional lion dance down Little Bourke Street aka Chinatown.\n\nWhy go? Chinese New Year and Lunar New Year is for many a time to get together with friends and family to wish for good luck and a prosperous year ahead. As Melbourne's Asian communities celebrate, everyone is invited to join in the festivities all around the city.\n\nDon’t miss: Tying it in with a visit to Melbourne’s best yum cha eateries. You won’t regret it.\n\nAdvertising\n\nWhat is it?

There’s always a fun story and narration and usually a catchy tune that you’ll have in your head for the rest of the day.\n\nDon’t miss: This isn’t really a “don’t miss” per se, but if you can swing it, visit the windows on a weekday. Weekend visitors swarm Bourke Street Mall, and it’s often tough to get a good view of the windows when you’re being herded like sheep from window to window.\n\nWhat is it? A huge arts and crafts market held every second Saturday of the month.\n\nWhy go? We love our art galleries, we love our markets, but most of all we love it when art galleries host markets. Like when the Heide Museum of Modern Art teams up with Rose Street Artist Markets and has a beautiful stall-and-bunting baby. At the Heide Makers’ Market, you can pick up the wares of those more creative than you. Find art, handicrafts and food at the markets, and once you’ve had your fill and/or run out of money, take a squiz at Heide’s new and permanent collections.\n\nDon't miss: Going for a stroll around the lush sculpture gardens (there are six acres of gardens all up).\n\nAdvertising\n\nWhat is it? This 20-kilometre (or so) trail through suburban greenland is a great way to green up your life on a weekend.\n\nWhy go? It’s fun! There are about a gazillion ways to approach the Yarra Trail (which winds from the mouth of the Yarra River near the Westgate Bridge to Templestowe). Try setting out from Richmond underneath the Swan Street Bridge and ending up at the artificial weir and rock rapids at Dights Falls. Then simply retrace your steps.\n\nDon’t miss: Allow ample time for stops, not because you’ll need them (this is a pretty easy cycle) but because the Yarra Trail covers interesting turf, including New York artist Ugo Rondinone's gigantic and cheerful rainbow sculpture, 'Our Magic Hour', the Collingwood Children's Farm and the Abbotsford Convent.\n\nWhat is it? A staple to the Brunswick Street bar scene, Bimbo was an icon of late-night drinking and debauchery.\n\nWhy go? After a terrible fire, renovation and a change of ownership, the restaurant has changed its name to Kewpie – but the anything-goes vibe remains.\n\nDon’t miss: The $5 pizzas. It’s a full pizza for five dollars. You seriously can’t beat this deal.\n\nAdvertising\n\nWhat is it? The Shrine was built between 1927 and 1934 as a place for Victorians to grieve, honour and preserve the memories of those who lost their lives in World War I. Now it serves as a memorial to all Australians who served in war.\n\nWhy go? Standing atop the steps of the war memorial gives you a commanding view back to the city, with the gloriously green Royal Botanic Gardens to your right.\n\nDon’t miss: A visit inside the memorial. Admission is free, though donations are welcome.\n\nWhat is it?Rein and La Rue – a modern French restaurant and bar that's located in the historic Melbourne Stock Exchange building on Collins Street.\n\nWhy go?To bask in the beauty of the high vaulted ceilings, stained glass windows and limestone walls. And to eat from a curated menu that pays homage to French classics with a distinctly Australian touch, of course. It's also a place where it’s just as easy to pop in for snacks and Champagne at the bar as it is to reserve a cosy booth for an exquisite three-course meal.\n\nDon’t miss:the Jersey milk soft serve. Made from the in-house soft serve machine (amazing, right?), it's served with fresh hazelnuts and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil. Heaven.\n\nAdvertising\n\nWhat is it? A tour of the Victorian pumping station, which handled the sewerage of 19th-century Melbourne\n\nWhy go? We understand a tour of a sewer works might not seem exciting, but just stay with us. You’ll get to really understand what it took to build the extensive pipe tunnels to move all of Melbourne’s waste (and what it meant to ‘lose a man a mile’ during their construction). You’ll see the 19th-century boiler, into which men shovelled coal at a backbreaking pace in blistering heat. The museum includes quite a bit about the history of Melbourne, and why its sewerage needs were so important for a world-class city. What we’re trying to say is: it’s definitely not shit.\n\nDon’t miss: The century-old Austral Otis Engine No. 8. It’s as big as a room and very cool to see in action.\n\nWhat is it? A new mega-venue in Preston with a gaming arcade, beer garden, bar, bistro and 12 bowling alleys.\n\nWhy go? Inspired by the retro aesthetics of the bowling alleys of America, the Keys is here to make bowling cool again – and we've gotta say, it's working. This refurbished warehouse can fit 600 people, and it's pumping on a Friday and Saturday night with DJs spinning tunes 'til late.\n\nDon't miss: Having a bowl! The bowling alley has been crafted from old trimmings of now-closed vintage alleys from across the country, with lanes available to be booked prior to or on a walk-in basis.\n\nAdvertising\n\nWhat is it? In 2013, a team of gardeners became the first Aussies to take out the prestigious Best in Show Award at the Chelsea Garden Show with a display patriotically titled, ‘Australian Garden’. Now, ten years later, that initial landscape concept has bloomed into Chelsea Australian Garden, a real-life, permanent garden that is 20 times bigger than the original.\n\nWhy go?It's home to more than 15,000 plants – including more than 400 native Australian species and endangered varieties like the Wollemi Pine.\n\nDon't miss: the enormous waratah sculpture (which stands at nine metres tall), the waterfall or the billabong. Oh, and keep an eye out for wildlife, including the many frogs, birds and insects that call the site home.\n\nWhat is it? While the distance between Victoria's two peninsulas, from the township of Queenscliff to the township of Sorrento, is only 10 kilometres, it can only be traversed by ferry.\n\nWhy go? This ferry ride is one of the most picturesque (and convenient) ways to travel between Melbourne’s southern coasts. If you're lucky, you might be able to see dolphins hanging out in the bay.\n\nDon't miss: The boat. But don’t worry if you do. Ferries depart Queenscliff harbour and Sorrento pier every hour on the hour, seven days a week.\n\nAdvertising"
