As a yearly subscriber I can’t wait for my new box to arrive and I have been blown away with the bijoux (treasures) inside. I just want to say confidently that if anyone is in doubt please give it a try you will not be disappointed. I have already signed up for another yearly subscription and can’t wait for my next box to arrive, each box is exquisitely put together especially just for me! (or at least that is how I feel) my sister in laws are like little girls who want to look, touch, and smell everything I receive and can’t wait to see what I share with them. Thank you very much Sharon your French boxes bring so much pleasure to me.\n\nKatherin Florio\n\nToronto Canada\n\nDear Sharon,\n\nWhat a joyful 2017 it has been with the French experience of the four My Stylish French boxes over the year. I decided to give a gift box to each of my three daughters for their birthday and one for myself, of course and conveniently, there was a birthday each quarter. After receiving the first box and seeing how gorgeous the items were and how thrilled my daughter was, I decided to order an extra box each quarter to add a French touch to the renovation and addition of four bedrooms to our holiday house and what a wonderful decision that was!\n\nThe boxes are just beautiful and so unique in their array of surprises. Our holiday house will have the lovely water colours in each bedroom and a place for all the fragrances and objets d’art. I am so thrilled I can’t wait for the next four boxes this year as the renovation is not yet finished and I’m sure after it is, there will be plenty of reasons to keep on ordering, they are exquisite with beautiful fragrances that keep on giving…..such a wonderful gift!\n\nKind regards,\n\nWendy Conyers, Australia\n\nAustralia\n\nDear Sharon,\n\nWhat a joyful 2017 it has been with the French experience of the four My Stylish French boxes over the year.

After receiving the first box and seeing how gorgeous the items were and how thrilled my daughter was, I decided to order an extra box each quarter to add a French touch to the renovation and addition of four bedrooms to our holiday house and what a wonderful decision that was!\n\nThe boxes are just beautiful and so unique in their array of surprises. Our holiday house will have the lovely water colours in each bedroom and a place for all the fragrances and objets d’art. I am so thrilled I can’t wait for the next four boxes this year as the renovation is not yet finished and I’m sure after it is, there will be plenty of reasons to keep on ordering, they are exquisite with beautiful fragrances that keep on giving…..such a wonderful gift!\n\nKind regards,\n\nWendy Conyers, Australia\n\nAustralia\n\nI just wanted to let you know that I was one of your very first subscribers , in fact I signed up the day you announced the boxes, and so I received all four boxes last year. I loved them all! So much that I have just taken out a new yearly subscription. Among my favourite items were the Olive en Provence body scrub, the table runner, the Fragonard guest soaps and of course the candles … the Bastide candle in August was truly divine! Thanks to you I have discovered new brands, and I’m looking forward to more deliciousness this year, and of course having a new set of watercolours to frame for my wall! Thank you so much for the care and time you put into every detail, it is SO appreciated, Cheri x\n\nThis is my fourth box and best yet. I have been to Versailles and visited both the royal palace and Marie Antoinette’s “more comfortable area.” It was beautiful, but not me. I was not really thrilled with the theme of this box BUT as always, when it arrived, it was like Christmas! I carefully dissected the box and found so many wondrous items. The petits sables are fantastic – you can smell the butter in them before you bite! Le Soft Pefume – what a fabulous soft and romantic fragrance. The fan, the make-up brushes, body soap and everything else – you have outdone yourself yet again, Sharon!!\n\nAs always, you do not disappoint!! What a wonderful treat to receive. Thank you for looking throughout France for home-made items. The tea in the Christmas box was splendid and I ordered a box for my daughter-in-law as a Christmas gift.\n\nBlessings to you for sharing the best of France!\n\nEllen from Cleveland Ohio\n\nI have been a subscriber to My Stylish French Box since the beginning and have enjoyed it thoroughly until May 2018\n\nI was considering a role as Ambassador but I am a little unsure of the future direction of the Box..\n\nMay’s box included a wreath – which as the representative of something brocante was … disappointing. It did not have much appeal or a sense of something special and is likely not to last long due to its fragile (flimsy) nature. Something truly brocante carries a special history with it – which I think everyone treasures\n\nThe net bag – while a staple of French shoppers is also widely used in the U. S. now – and is one of the lesser attractive choices for bringing your own bag to the store now in the U.S.\n\nI know your prices have risen and that you are hoping to focus on things of value rather than volume… I hope you are able to follow through on this.\n\nThank you for the brilliant concept – just sorry about May\n\nbest\n\nPatricia Margaret\n\n______________\n\nDear Patricia\n\nFirst of all thank you for your custom and for your honest input. We take note of all the comments and feedback from our clients, and we try to build on our experience and do better with each box.\n\nI’m sorry that you didn’t appreciate the wreath. I realise that this was a new twist on the brocante element, but as it is made only with antique engravings, pages from antique books and also antique linen, I thought that it had a charm of its own. To reassure you, in the coming boxes we have individual brocante items lined up for you that I hope you will enjoy.\n\nThe net bag is something that I use myself. I like that I can have it in the bottom of a handbag, or in the car ready to use, and that it never looks creased or ruffled. Also these are very fashionable right now, so we thought that our clients would enjoy this fun item.\n\nI hope that you will reconsider your initial idea of becoming an ambassador for the box, as a longtime client, I’m sure you would be fantastic!\n\nWe are busy preparing the August box now, and I’m happy to tell you that it is all about French cuisine. As usual we aim to bring you uniquely French items, with a US retail value well above the purchase price for the box.\n\nwith warm regards from Normandy\n\nSharon\n\nMy feelings of anticipation rise as I await each new box. They just get better and better! I am really thrilled with the Apicia products as I use all-natural/organic beauty products. I have never had a real French filet bag before. I am devoted to Saint Michael the Archangel and we love ropes and thread and string. This unites us in the never-ending movement of the tides of life. The handmade ring cup is exquisite. I love trinket dishes. This reminds me of a shell polished by the elements resting on a piece of driftwood. I felt the wreath was chosen “just for me”. It is something I would choose if I were out shopping for myself and hoping to find a treasure. The antique linen and pages from books are symbolic for me. The gardenia and the tomato represent Paradise. Some white bead necklaces can look “old lady”. The size of the beads, the string tassel and the gold disk make this one fresh and age-less. The watercolors filled me with a longing to finally fill a home with the treasures from all the boxes.\n\n______________\n\nDear Carol,\n\nWe are so pleased that you enjoyed each and every one of the contents of the May box and love that we are able to meet those expectations each box! Thank you so much for being a client.\n\nWith kindest regards,\n\nThe My Stylish French Box team\n\nOh Sharon! Where to start?! I love love love this box. I have never subscribed to a box before and I was a little nervous, so I just signed up for the one shot Gift box. Now I heading back to sign up for the year!\n\nMy granddaughters helped me open the box and they were as excited as me! My very favorite item is the ring cup, thank you for finding this artist. I also love the hand cream and the string bag, so useful. The candle is burning as I write this comment, and I have to tell you that I am already impatient for August to arrive.\n\nThank you for the care you obviously take to make our experience very special indeed\n\nSandy\n\n______________\n\nDear Sandy,\n\nWe are so delighted to hear that! Thank you so much for being a client. We hope you enjoy the August box!\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nThe My Stylish French Box team\n\nBrilliant & Amazing are the words that come to mind when I think of Sharon of My Stylish french box. My mother had difficulties trying to purchase the Yearly Subscription Box and time was an issue to get the order before the purchase deadline. After several attempts to figure out her technical issue, Sharon reached out to my mother from France to Seattle and walked my mom though the purchase process. I am amazed with the level of customer service and how My Stylish french box went above and beyond the typical customer service standards. I highly recommend My Stylish french box not just for their amazing product but their superb level of customer service and attention to detail. Thank you Sharon for taking such good care of my mother.\n\n______________\n\nMichael,\n\nThank YOU so much. Your kind words were read at one of our team meetings and made our day! We are so happy to have helped, and to have your sweet mom as a client! We hope she enjoys her boxes and all the fun little surprises.\n\nWith kindest regards,\n\nThe My Stylish French Box team\n\nI loved the boxes but the change is price ia rather steep. I think i am not going to be able to afford now wish u had kept the original members at the lower rate so they didn’t have to stop the subscription. Very disappointed!!\n\n_______________\n\nDear Donna, thank you for your feedback and thank you for your custom. We understand that you would have preferred being kept at the original rate, and believe me if we could have done that we would! As a goodwill gesture, all of our original clients benefitted from an additional two boxes at the old price before we changed their subscription to the new price, and as you know we wrote to each person concerned to explain the change before it came into effect.\n\nWe work hard to curate a box of high-end French products for our clients to enjoy. We never include sample sizes or inferior quality items and of course shipping worldwide is included in our sales price.\n\nWe hope that in the future you will feel happy to return either as a subscriber or as a one-off gift purchaser; either way you will always be most welcome.\n\nwith kind wishes\n\nSharon Santoni\n\nI ordered this box at first as a one time thing, I felt it was a little expensive and could not think of a good reason to keep getting it, my first box showed up and then the second, and I was so surprised and taken aback at what was in these boxes, they cover every sense in the human body and the box is so delightful, to open it is a treasure on its own when you open the shipping box and then “THE BOX”, you can’t imagine what could be packed in this little box, but oh my the treasures that await the senses is amazing… and just when you think it can not get any better here comes another box full of sensory pleasures.. there are so many goodies in these little boxes that are worth every penny, In a day and age of getting cookie cutter items, that to be honest don’t really offer a lot this is a true treasure to get in the mail of doom and gloom… If nothing else try this box of goodies at least one time and let your life have a true old world experience, You won’t be sorry and I bet you order again, even if it is only for special occasions or holidays, you really won’t be sorry…..\n\n______________\n\nDear Tammy,\n\nThank you dearly for your review. It is such a pleasure to hear from clients such as yourself. We take pride in finding unique products for the boxes that cannot be found anywhere else and are thrilled to bring these little treasures to you. We are so happy you liked the experience of opening the box too! That is such a big part of it- from the smell to the different textures. Thank you so much for being a client and we cannot wait to bring you even more surprises in the coming months.\n\nWith kind wishes,\n\nThe My Stylish French Box team\n\nSorry Sharon.\n\nI purchased the May box as a present for my sister’s 60th birthday. I was so excited before it arrived, however when I saw what was inside the box I was pretty disappointed and I really don’t feel that it delivered value for money.\n\nThe paper wreath might have been made from old books but that didn’t make it a brocante item, and I can see it getting damaged very quickly.\n\nI’m guessing that the vast majority of people purchasing the boxes have more money than they know what to do with, but for me, I felt that my hard earned cash didn’t purchase very much at all and the experience made my feel quite deflated.\n\n_______________\n\nDear Susan\n\nThank you for taking the time to leave us your feedback. We take note of every single comment and email from our clients, and we are always trying to improve our offer.\n\nI am very sorry that you were disappointed in the wreath that was included in our May box. It was hand made with leaves cut from antique books, antique engravings and antique linen. We have received many positive comments about the wreath from clients who have either hung it on a wall, framed or unframed, or simply propped the wreath on a shelf.\n\nWe are very careful when we choose the products for our boxes that the US retail value is higher than the price paid. Also, as you know the price of the box includes all shipping costs.\n\nThe other items in the box included a hand made porcelain ring cup; two high quality cosmetic products; a very special luxury candle, as well as a necklace and a handy bag. I am confident that our clients got value for their money, as with all of our boxes.\n\nIf ever you wish to come back and try out another box you would be most welcome\n\nwith kind wishes\n\nSharon\n\nMy friend and I have just had a lovely Friday afternoon.\n\nWe have had our November boxes for 2 weeks, waiting for the right moment to open them together. We are both teachers working in a girls school with 5/6 year olds in their first year of school (What joy.) We have 1 more week of the school year to go before our long summer break and had just finished a extremely busy week which had included a very special Nativity play where are gorgeous little angels stole the show, but we were exhausted. Now was the right time! We have had a very cold, wet, windy spring and the thought of the long hot summer to come is a bit daunting. However out Friday afternoon was perfect. We had our glass of cold French rose, our wedge of French cheese, the French doors open with a waft of breeze coming through. We had already had a chuckle, the fact that we thought we had purchased the box in Australian dollars when in fact it was US dollars. Just in case we were disappointed we had an atlas opened to France with a big highlighted dot on Normandy to remind us the box had actually come from France. As we opened each parcel we oohed and aahed. We loved everything, my friend the candle and I just loved the candle holders. The necklace we both were not too sure about but decided with the right outfit it could be perfect after all it was French -from France!!!!\n\nWe are now planning to make this our treat again next year , what fun we had.\n\nThank you Sharon\n\nMerry Christmas to you and your family,\n\nDebbie\n\n________\n\nDear Debbie\n\nThank you so much for your lovely message. I can picture you and your friend sitting together and opening the box with the glass of wine and French cheese! Thank you for painting that image for us, I love it!\n\nI hope that you will both enjoy the February box just as much. It will be called La Parisienne, and will be full of feminine and iconic items to make you and your girlfriend feel very French indeed.\n\nThank you for your custom, and happy Christmas in Australia!\n\nSharon\n\nThe August box was over the top and was such a treat to receive. When I opened the November box I was disappointed beyond words and will not continue to order as the cost it to much for such a let down. Had it contained the quality as the August box I would have continued to treat myself with the little French box.\n\n________\n\nDear Sherry\n\nI am very sorry to read your comment, and to learn that you were disappointed by your box. All of our boxes contain items that total a retail value of well over the cost of the box, and that without the shipping costs.\n\nThe only difference that you may have noticed with the November box, was that because the items were smaller in size (although not in value) the box did not appear to be as full as the August edition.\n\nWe have received many emails and comments from clients who loved the November box, so I think that maybe we simply didn’t hit the right products for your taste.\n\nI hope that you may come back as a client and give us another chance to prove just how much love and attention we put into creating each box. The February 2019 edition will be called La Parisienne, and I can honestly tell you that I am bursting with excitement about this box. We have united some spectacular brands, and the box will be oozing with true Parisian chic and femininity.\n\nwith kind wishes from Normandy\n\nSharon\n\nHi Sharon and team! Your boxes were delivered third week of November, but the three that I purchased were only just opened this weekend. I bought one for myself , one for my mum and one for my daughter, so I had to wait until I got everyone together. What can I say?! I do not know how you do this!\n\nYou curated a box that I love to bits (I’m 56) , but that also made my 81 year old mum very happy AND my 28 year old daughter! We had such a lovely time opening it together. I made a special table with little appetizers, and I even opened a bottle of bubbles! We sat together and opened each item slowly, reading the brochure as we went.\n\nThank you for the care you put into these boxes. This was my third time purchasing, and I love that each box is so different, but each one delightful. You have a client for life!!!\n\nPatricia in Maine, USA\n\n________\n\nDear Patricia,\n\nWe are so thrilled you enjoyed the November box! And what a special moment opening them together :-)We are pleased you enjoyed all the contents. Each is chosen carefully to be an item of quality with high craftsmanship, and a beautiful object that everyone will enjoy- of course with that fun element of surprise too! Thank you so much for being a client and your kind message. We can’t wait for you to receive the next box!\n\nKind wishes\n\nThe My Stylish French Box Team\n\nI was so excited to receive my first stylish French box. My absolute favourite was the scarf’\n\nAlthough I did totally love everything .I love so much the candle holders. I had the perfect spot\n\non the wall to put them. I got so many compliments on them over the holidays. I am over the top excited about receiving\n\nmy February box , as I am a total Paris lover. I am so glad I bought a years subscription.\n\nThe very best in 2019.\n\nRita\n\n________\n\nDear Rita,\n\nMerci beaucoup for your review! We love that you had such a wonderful time over the holidays with decorating and snazzing up outfits with the items from the November box! Thank you so much for subscribing and we hope you enjoy the next box. We cannot wait to send this one out!\n\nKind wishes,\n\nThe My Stylish French Box Team\n\nI enjoyed receiving the November 2018 box. Mine was missing the necklace, but all it took was a quick email to the team and a necklace was mailed to me in time for me to enjoy it for the holidays. Thank you for such great customer service!\n\nThe February box, 2019, however, is a disappointment to me. I don’t particularly like the newest artist’s work so I’m not looking forward to receiving more of his artwork. Unfortunately, two of the items featured that art, the water color and the note cards…note cards with no envelopes, by the way. I’m bothered by scent and this box includes both perfume and a candle. The objet trouvé is a small pasteboard pill box…meh. Lastly, the box includes a beret. Seriously, a beret? It’s not 2016 when berets were a hot fashion item. The best item in the box is the red lipstick. It’s very sheer and will be a good color for most everyone. I subscribed for a whole year. I sure hope the next three boxes are filled with items that delight me.\n\nI so wish I could have received last year’s spring box. I love the idea of a cookbook and copper molds. Anybody want to trade?\n\n________\n\nDear Lisa,\n\nWe are so sorry to hear that you are disappointed with the February box and that some of the items were not your taste. So far we’ve received quite a lot of positive comments from our other subscribers. For the beret, you might be surprised to know that they’re still very much in fashion and are common sights on the streets of Paris!\n\nJean-Jacques Sempé is a very prominent French artist who became famous in the States with his work for the New Yorker, but we can understand how his work may not appeal to everyone.\n\nThank you so much for your yearly subscription, we are sure you will love the boxes for the rest of the year!\n\nKind regards,\n\nSharon & the MSFB team\n\nThank you so much Sharon! This is my fourth box and I absolutely love it! The perfume smells divine and I just love the chic little spray for my handbag. I am a long time admirer of Jean Jacque Sempé’s work, I remember so many of his covers for the New Yorker. I’ve never worn a beret before, and I was hesitant, but now I’ve tried it on, I think it is very cute on me, and I will be wearing it a lot this late winter and spring.\n\nThank you for all the care and planning you put into each of these boxes, they bring me very much pleasure indeed!\n\nwith best wishes from Texas\n\nJudy\n\n________\n\nDear Judy,\n\nWe love that you love the February box! It might be one of our favorites – but it’s hard to say as they are all so unique with different French artisans and creators. Sempé is fabulous and we are so happy you love his work. We see berets in France on women and men of all ages here-enjoy!\n\nKind wishes,\n\nThe My Stylish French Box Team\n\nAfter a crazy Monday at work, it was a Godsend that my French Box arrived yesterday. I had bought one for my sister and she was blown away with it so I finally splurged on me. One point that made me go for it was the mention of Annick Goutal. The fragrance reminds me of my business trips to Paris and the hotel where I stayed and they had the products in their rooms…just lovely. Opening the box it a true experience in itself and it felt like Christmas all over again. The first surprise was the French Beret, I have a small collection of French Beret that I have collected over the years and love my new addition and the bonus bag. The Annick Goutal fragrances in the gold case is a treasure as well. These are my 2 most favorite of the box and everything else just icing on the cake….no misses here, love them all. Thank you for taking me back to Paris and wishing I was there now.\n\n________\n\nDear Debra,\n\nThank you so much for your review! We are so glad this box brought you right back to Paris with the scents and each of the items. And how perfect that the beret will be added to your collection! Merci for being a client!\n\nKind wishes,\n\nThe My Stylish French Box Team\n\nWhat an amazing, incredible treat! Before, I even mention the products, I have to tell you that the box itself is perfection, It can be reused and comes with a magnetic closure with a grosgrain tab to open. Each item was carefully wrapped in tissue paper and was arranged, as if by a close friend with a marvelous eye to detail. As for everything inside, I am over the moon ecstatic and absolutely adore everything. The candle smells divine, the beret is adorable, the pillbox is very cute and clever, the lipstick is a wonderful, soft red, the pochette is beautiful and the fabric is lovely. I love the illustrations of Jean-Jacques Sempes, so I was delighted to receive the notecard in addition to a print. Is it just me, or does anyone else feel like there is something about his work that is a bit reminiscent of Ludwig Bemelmans. The extra annual gift is the most delightfully scented bar of soap. I think I will use it as a sachet, so I can enjoy it even longer. However, my absolute favorite, was the perfumes from Annick Goutal. I am very specific about what scents I will wear, and I love wearing this. I, also, especially love the elegant, vintage type gold case, to store and protect the perfume when it is in your purse.\n\nOver the past few years, I have tried a few different monthly boxes. This one has always intrigued me and for a while I was put off by the price. Well, it is worth every penny. The French Collection Box is even better than I expected. Thank you, Sharon and your wonderful team! You have brightened February in my little corner of the world. ?\n\n________\n\nDear Mary,\n\nWe are so happy that you loved each and every one of the contents, and that the box was over and beyond your expectations! We’re a small team putting care into each product choice and the wrapping of each item and we are so pleased you noticed this! Thank you so much for being a client and we hope you love all the additional boxes you will receive this year.\n\nKind wishes,\n\nThe My Stylish French Box Team\n\nI have received 3 boxes so far and I now have plenty of candles and soap. One of the candles is available at my local Walmart. Many of the items are very cool and are beautifully presented, but the final decision to cancel came in the February box.; it included beautiful note cards, but no envelopes!\n\n__________\n\nDear Denise\n\nThank you for your comment. As you know from our replies to your emails we are always very happy to receive any feedback from our clients, and we take note of everything.\n\nRegarding the candles and soap. One of our criteria when curating the box is that the contents smell divine and include a home fragrance of some kind. Due to shipping restrictions, we are not able to send room sprays or other kinds of perfume, and candles are a great way to perfume your home and of course they can be shipped safely and without hindrance from transport regulations. Personally I always have several candles on the go here at home, and am happy to discover new brands.\n\nI am surprised that you say you can find one of our brands in Walmart. We were certainly unaware of this. When we approach new brands to supply for the box, we always ask whether they are distributed internationally, and if so where.\n\nWe have included soaps in several of our boxes. I see that you received the Savon de Marseille in the August box and in the latest box you received the pretty Savonnerie de la Chapelle product which was the additional gift for our yearly and quarterly subscribers. Again we feel that soaps are something we all use regularly, and they make pretty additions to a guest bathroom, or simply to spoil ourselves.\n\nRegarding the lack of envelopes with the box of notecards illustrated by Jean Jacques Sempé. As we mentioned in our email exchange with you on that subject, the cards are a fairly standard size and it is easy to find envelopes to fit them. With space at a premium in our box, we felt it was preferable to have more of Sempé’s beautiful cards than to replace half of them with envelopes.\n\nI hope that answers your questions, and that in the future you may be tempted to come back and try the box again, you will always be most welcome.\n\nwith kind wishes\n\nSharon\n\nThough Spring is trying to break through here in Pennsylvania, grey skies persist and cold winds are blowing. It snowed overnight.\n\nArriving home from a trip, I couldn’t wait to open what is surely the most stylish French box in existence! An authentic French beret! The scent! I am back in Paris! It is Christmas morning! Every unwrapping is a delight.\n\nTo you and your staff, who perhaps helped gather and pack this wonderful surprise, I send my sincere thanks and good wishes.\n\nWith hopes to visit your charmed part of the world soon,\n\nDottie Monta\n\n__________\n\nDear Dottie!\n\nWe are so happy the box brought you right back to Paris with the smell and products. We hope it was a little sunshine on a snowy day. Thank you so much for taking the time to write a review and for being a customer! Deciding on each of the products is an adventure for each box where each is carefully chosen for their quality, craftsmanship, and part in the boxes theme. Hearing from you makes our day and we are thrilled you loved the contents.\n\nThank you again,\n\nThe My Stylish French Box Team\n\nDear Sharon and Emily,\n\nOur daughter absolutely loves the ‘Daughter’s Box’, as do I.\n\nWatching her open it Christmas morning was more than delightful, as was the magnificent smile on her face. She immersed herself in the masks the following week and talks to herself in French pottering about with the contents today. It is so sweet to watch and listen to.\n\nI can see she feels very special when she receives comments on the pretty necklace and bracelet too.\n\nYou are wonderful ladies with a super team around you both to have taken time to create one more. I cannot thank you enough for the delight you helped bring our daughter.\n\nFondest regards,\n\nEmma and Brad Pears\n\n________\n\nDear Emma,\n\nThank you so much for your review of this very special box. It is so special to read about her opening it! We are so happy she enjoyed all the little presents. Merci beaucoup for your order!\n\nKind wishes,\n\nThe My Stylish French Box Team\n\nI have subscribed since the beginning. I am always so excited to open a new box. i always love candles and soap and the candle in the May 2019 box is especially pretty.\n\nI didn’t mind that the notecards in a previous box didn’t have envelopes because I’ll frame the cards and hang them on the wall.\n\nI don’t know whether I’ll ever wear the beret in a previous box but it’s such a cool thing to have! I just love receiving beautiful things I probably won’t go out and buy on my own . I think my favorite things are items from the brocante! Thank you for doing a great job.\n\n________\n\nDear Dianne,\n\nThank you so much for being a client since the very beginning. We are so pleased that you are such a long-standing client! You’ll have to send us a picture of the cards all framed. I’m sure they will look beautiful! The beret in the February box is certainly a special item, as it is 100% Made in France and beautifully made when so many of them nowadays are not.\n\nThank you again for ordering and for your kind words! We are so thrilled that you enjoy the boxes.\n\nKind wishes,\n\nThe My Stylish French Box Team\n\nDear Sharon,\n\nI received the May box a couple of days ago and waited to open it when I had some quiet time to enjoy. The contents are stunning! As I am a blue and white fanatic, I found all of your choices first rate and beautiful. They are items I will enjoy for years to come (especially the scarf)! And… the magazine. Oh my goodness, it is impressive and also first rate. The photographs are wonderful and the stories look interesting and captivating. I will save it for another day to enjoy at my leisure. Since I have not been able to access the magazine on-line, I am thrilled to have a hard copy in my hands! Thank you Sharon and staff for such thoughtful and amazing gifts and a superior magazine!\n\nKindest regards,\n\nTerri Smith\n\nDallas, Texas\n\n________\n\nDear Terri,\n\nMerci beaucoup! We are so happy you enjoyed all the little gifts in this latest box. Our team has such fun picking out each one for you to enjoy. The magazine is certainly a special and exciting new venture for us! Thank you so much for your words of support and we are so thrilled that you love it!\n\nKind wishes,\n\nThe My Stylish French Box Team\n\nDearest Sharon and your wonderful team,\n\nPlease accept my sincere gratitude for one of the most beautiful and meaningful gifts that I have ever had the pleasure to receive.\n\nEvery single item is exquisite and all my senses are totally indulged by them.\n\nThe magazine is fantastic and some of the photographs are works of art.\n\nI will sign up to receive a subscription within the next few days and I will be looking forward to the next issue.\n\n________\n\nDear Bronwyn L-C,\n\nThank you so much for writing! It is so wonderful to hear from clients like yourself and we are so thrilled that you enjoyed the Blue and White box. It certainly is one of our favorites, but we find ourselves saying that every time! Also, thank you for your kind words about the magazine. It has been an exciting new venture for us and we are so happy you like it.\n\nBest wishes,\n\nThe My Stylish French Box Team\n\nI absolutely love the Blue and White box!! This is my second box (the August kitchen box was the first) and I have not been disappointed in the least. Just sad I did not also get the 9th box. I love the scarf and actually have already worn it as I flew to Philadelphia, I am always cold on planes and this was perfect with navy pants white t-shirt and navy and white jacket. The linen cloth is amazing and to be personally monogrammed is a real bonus. Each of the items are exquisite and truly show that they were thoughtfully chosen. Thank you for spreading a little bit of Paris around the world and especially to Omaha, Nebraska.\n\n________\n\nDear Sandy,\n\nWe are thrilled you enjoyed the Blue and White box! The scarf makes such a beautiful addition to any wardrobe and we are so pleased it’s already flown with you from Omaha to Philadelphia. Thank you so much for being a client and for taking the time to write a review!\n\nKind wishes,\n\nThe My Stylish French Box Team\n\nI do believe this May box is my favorite so far! I love and will use everything in it! When the box arrives I feel like I’m at my own birthday party unwrapping my gifts. The first thing I do when I open the white box is inhale. I know that a delightful fragrance will greet me even before I open the tissue. This sets the mood for opening the contents. Then I go on to discover the treasures inside.\n\nThank you for the time and expertise you put into making these boxes so special.\n\n________\n\nDear Vicky,\n\nThank you so much for sharing your experience receiving the box with us! We’re so glad you love the scent when you open the box, it’s a special little touch that we’ve always made sure to include and it’s so nice to hear that you appreciate it. It’s our absolute pleasure to send you birthday gifts four times a year!\n\nKind wishes,\n\nthe My Stylish French Box team\n\nIt was a treat beyond any I could have imagined – to be able to sample this curated collection of gorgeous French finds, and in my favorite colors, no less! I’ve been a long-time follower of your blog and have watched you grow and prosper, and it has been a delight to vicariously share your journey. My first indulgence was “My Stylish French Girlfriends” – which I love! Then I subscribed to your digital magazine – a delightful peek into the lives of creative and strong French women. And now this wonderful gifted box…. your style, creativity, and ingenuity never disappoint. I am fully enjoying the luscious scent of my candle, the beautiful blue linen scarf, and my morning coffee in my bluebird mug. The lovely antique napkin is actually large enough that it is adorning my nightstand. I can’t wait to travel with my new linen pouches, and I’m searching for a frame for the adorable print. The stationery is getting put to a special use – being mindful of my time to create art in my studio and jotting down ideas as they pop into my head. As for the stunning Bohm necklace….. the admiring eyes of my college-aged daughter were not to be resisted – she is the new lucky owner!\n\nThank you so very much again –\n\n________\n\nDear Jean,\n\nSo very pleased to hear not only how much you loved the May box but also that you were able to share some of the pieces with your own daughter! We are so happy that you were able to receive this box as one of our May giveaway winners and enjoy some beautiful French products in your own home 🙂\n\nKind wishes,\n\nthe My Stylish French Box team\n\nOur rural mailman dropped off my very first Stylish French Box this morning. It is a lovely summer treat to receive during our New Zealand winter!! I have been looking forward to this as it is as close as I will get to France anytime soon!\n\nWhen I purchased the box I did know I would have to pay extra customs duty to allow the box into NZ – I just didn’t realise it would be an extra $156 on top of the box purchase price each time. So as much as I would love to subscribe for a box every quarter I will have to just get the box occasionally.\n\n________\n\nDear Tracey,\n\nThank you for sharing your first box experience, we are so pleased that we could share a little bit of Provence summer with you during your winter months! We completely understand the frustration of the additional customs duty into New Zealand and wish there was something we could do to make it easier for you to receive boxes, but are very happy to hear you wish to continue to receive boxes on an occasional basis 🙂\n\nKind wishes,\n\nthe My Stylish French Box team\n\nBonjour!\n\nI ordered the August 2018 box as a little treat for myself. Just opening it was an experience – the box, tissue, fragrance wafting from the tissue……I was beyond excited to receive it.\n\nI’m in Kansas and was introduced to your book via Nell Hills and thereafter your website. Although the concept of the boxes is fabulous, I had not seen anything that I thought “oh wow, that is something that I would buy and just screams France.” But I took a chance on the kitchen box. Kitchen is the heart of our home and I hoped that I had chosen the correct box. Luckily I had.\n\nI loved pretty much everything in it- the apron, teatowel, copper cannelé molds, the chocolate mix- all Fabuleux!!\n\nThe bowl–I LOVE–use it all of the time for cracking eggs in and to hold my garlic when not in use. It sits on my countertop every day. I love the copper candle container, but NOT the scent. I leave it out, but with the lid on. I was hoping for lavender or a flower or natural scent like cinnamon as opposed to a heavy perfume.\n\nI have continued to view the website and look at the boxes as they come out, but have been disappointed with what I have seen. I was on the fence about the Paris box and actually glad I didn’t order it. ~Sorry~\n\nSharon, please do another kitchen box or something similar–maybe a Provence box – Tuscany – Normandy! ~or other beautiful towns……….. I can only imagine the extraordinary fragrances and soaps….Maybe a beautiful glass brocante dish for rings or soap, brocante linen towels ~more items like the sugar tongs. The artwork is nice, but so small…..the cards lovely, but envelopes would be better- they are harder to find than you might realize. Calendar books, journals, etc would be fabulous….Sweet treats—what girl- from anywhere- doesn’t love a sweet treat!!! OOOOH MACARONS!\n\nThose are some of things I imagine myself purchasing on a fabulous shopping journey in France. They bring a feeling of tranquility, softness, relaxation – a slower paced life……at least to me!\n\nI say this only because I noticed in your last email sent out – that if we had ideas or requests, to forward them to you.\n\nMerci – Bonne Nuit\n\nThank you for letting me get a little bit of France in my home, until I can get there myself (next year – fingers crossed!!~)\n\n________\n\nDear Jennifer,\n\nThank you for your lovely review of our August 2018 kitchen box and for your feedback on what you would like to see in future boxes! We always take our clients’ ideas and opinions into account when curating our boxes so we’re thankful to hear what you think. We hope the next box you choose to receive surpasses all your expectations!\n\nKind wishes,\n\nthe My Stylish French Box team\n\nI love the whole concept of this box. The quality is wonderful and I know you put a lot of thought into it. My biggest concern is the art work as I have no place for any more art and also it is just not my style. Art is extremely personal and I know it is difficult to please everyone. Is it possible to substitute art for something else? I would think it would be fairly easy to offer an alternative. I signed up for the yearly boxes but probably will cancel if we keep getting this in the boxes. Just trying to be truthful!\n\n________\n\nDear Janet,\n\nThank you so much for your review and for your feedback about the art in the boxes! Each year we work with a different artist to create 4 custom prints, exclusive to the box, with the intent that at the end of the year, anyone who has received all 4 boxes will be able to frame them together. We completely agree that art is very personal! Many of our clients give items from the boxes as gifts, which is an option for the art pieces that you don’t wish to keep. Our artist will be changing for the February box so we hope their work is more to your taste. We appreciate your honesty and are sure that you’ll enjoy the pieces that are included in future boxes!\n\nKind wishes,\n\nthe My Stylish French Box team\n\nThis was my first time ordering a box. I really saw it as a treat for myself and boy was it! The whole experience of opening it was delightful. Opening the lid, a beautiful smell of lavender… inside perfectly wrapped little presents to be discovered one by one. I loved everything that was picked and adore the artist that was chosen for this year – Sempe- what a treat!! Get a box! You certainly won’t be disappointed!\n\n________\n\nDear Cindy,\n\nWhat a glowing review, we couldn’t be happier that you loved the box so much! Sempé is one of our favorites too and we feel so fortunate to have been able to commission work from him exclusively for our boxes this year. The scent upon opening the box is a detail we take very seriously- it must smell delicious!- and we’re so glad you liked the lavender scent in our August box. Thank you for being a client and we hope to have you with us for many boxes to come!\n\nKind wishes,\n\nthe My Stylish French Box team\n\nI’ve been ordering the boxes for more than a year now and wanted to take a moment to just say thank you! The selections you make suit my style perfectly. The box is always wrapped beautifully too! Each time a shipment is announced I find myself watching the mailbox waiting for it to arrive.. and it usually only takes a couple of days! Crazy with it coming from France. Another great thing- I love hearing about the brands! I wouldn’t know about these brands unless I subscribed. They’re unique and luxurious, and just simply perfect. Thank you! Looking forward to the November box!!\n\n________\n\nDear Susan,\n\nWow, what a wonderful review! We are just as eager to ship our Boxes, as you are to receiving them. It is such a pleasure to hear that you enjoy the wrapping, it is a special detail that we’ve always made sure to pay close attention to. We take pleasure in bringing France to our clients! Thank you for being a client with us for so long and taking the time to write!\n\nBest wishes,\n\nThe My Stylish French Box Team\n\nTo let you know that in one of the previous boxes I did receive the bowl from the above picture. USE IT is an understatement!! It has been a serving bowl on the table, cooked in, I have sprouted plants in it, held fresh herbs from the farmer’s market and used to hold eggs in the fridge. Of course bowls can be used so many ways but this the one item I probably use the most out of the 12 or so boxes that I have received. Wait—the other item is linen or maybe candles. Candles, always get burned and then used as vases or gifted to friends.\n\nYour boxes are a delight to receive and many of my friends have subscribed because of having received gifts from be from the boxes.\n\nThank you for all the effort that it takes to come up with these treasure boxes. They are appreciated.\n\nBe well and enjoy the Holiday season.\n\nKaren Mpitsos\n\n_________\n\nHi Karen, thank you so much for letting us know how often you use your bowl. We are preparing another cooking themed box for February, and I hope you love the contents every bit as much.\n\nHappy Holidays to you and your family\n\nSharon\n\nI loved getting the French Box but must have been one of the rare few who were not overwhelmed with the November box. I was very disappointed With the custom scarf- I would call it a pocket square or handkerchief- it is not large enough to wear as a scarf? I think you should have made it twice the size to really be useful.I was looking forward to the little box of chocolates that looked so beautiful in the marketing material but was very disappointed when mine contained pastel M&M’s-not very special.I also thought you missed the opportunity to be festive for the holiday- everything was so dark. I took a break from this next box- I loved the concept as I love all things French but felt a bit disappointed with that last box. I have to reconsider the indulgence. Wanted to pass my sincere review for your consideration.\n\n________\n\nDear Tammy,\n\nThank you so much for your input. We listen to everyone’s comments.\n\nWe have offered quite a few larger scarfs in past Boxes and found that a new size would be a fun change.\n\nThis smaller square version is largely popular in Paris at the moment. We thought our clients would enjoy the chicness of this scarf around the neck or tied to a handbag.\n\nThe chocolates in this Box were a very traditional chocolate in France, Dragées. Made by one of the finest confiserie in Paris, Boissier. We would be more than happy to send you the other box of chocolates, we do not want out clients to feel like they have missed out!\n\nWe appreciate you as a customer and welcome you back at anytime!\n\nBest wishes,\n\nThe My Stylish French Box Team\n\nA few months ago when I read that the February box was all about the French cuisine I new I had to order one. Knowing the details and thoughtfulness you and your team put into making these beautiful boxes so special made for such an anticipated surprise and I was very much delighted! As I unwrapped each item I kept thinking, you really accomplished your intent for this box…because in our family, “ma cuisine” (which my kitchen is now going to be referred to:) is the heart of our family and home. I know family and friends will see these gifts dans ma cuisine and I will definitely tell them all about “My Stylish French Box”.\n\nMerci Sharon and staff:)\n\nDonna\n\n________\n\nDear Donna, We love the fact that your kitchen is now your Cuisine! I’m so glad that you like all the contents of the February box, we pour so much love into each edition, it is wonderful for us to hear from happy clients.\n\nWith thanks and kind wishes\n\nSharon\n\nFor months I have been pondering purchasing a Stylish French Box. I bought Sharon Santoni’s books, My French Country Home and My Stylish French Girlfriends and read them from cover to cover. Now being totally intrigued with the French culture, I subscribed to My French Country Home Magazine. Again, I was instantly drawn to the beautiful stories, home, food, and the people of France. How could I not purchase a Stylish French Box after all that! My very first French box arrived last week and I was absolutely delighted with the contents. Now I have a yearly subscription and I am looking forward to my next box arriving in May.\n\nGinger Kinzer\n\nMarch 2020\n\n________\n\nDear Ginger, thank you so much for your kind words, we are very happy that you decided to buy your first box and that it was such a success! The May box is underway already, and we hope you love that one just as much!\n\nKindly\n\nSharon & the MSFB Team\n\nBecause of my French heritage, I have always been drawn to anything related to France, the food, the shopping, the wines and books of history.\n\nI’ve really enjoyed your newsletters and blog, Sharon and was SO thrilled to find that lovely red and black designer scarf\n\navailable in the boutique. I had first spotted it as an item in one of the boxes. It arrived the other day and I’m enjoying it immensely. The order and shipping all went smoothly.\n\nThank you for adding the shopping boutique to your website. It keeps me connected to the country I love so much!\n\n________\n\nDear June,\n\nThank you so much for sharing with us! We are thrilled to know that you are enjoying the new boutique and found an item you were looking for. It is our pleasure to keep you connected with France, check back weekly for new arrivals!\n\nBest wishes,\n\nThe My Stylish French Box Team\n\nI have been receiving and enjoying these wonderful boxes since the beginning,and have never been disappointed with either the contents,the delivery,or a prompt response if I had a question.I especially appreciate the way Sharon and her team listened to my input(ie reducing the number of candles–unuseable for me as my husband has asthma).Also important for me is including items that are not so much in the ‘souvenir`’ vain but things I can really use and treasure….particularly the soaps,perfume,scarf,and especially in the last box,the fabulous Emile H baking dish which I added to my existing collection!\n\nI say each box is my favorite,and then,viola!The next one arrives and goes to the top of the list!!\n\nI must also add how much I enjoyvSharon’s,writings,and gorgeous magazine!!\n\nMerci mille fois por tout!\n\n________\n\nDear Natalia,\n\nThank you for your kind words! We take all of our clients feedback into careful consideration! It is our pleasure that you are enjoying every Box. Just wait until you receive the May Box, it will be absolutely gorgeous! Make sure to share with us on social media how you use the gifts from this Box using #mystylishfrenchbox!\n\nBest wishes,\n\nThe My Stylish French Box Team\n\nI started receiving these lovely boxes as a reward for completing an advanced degree in 2018. The day I submitted my dissertation, I signed up for a year of boxes! I renewed my subscription last summer and have enjoyed every box that has arrived.\n\nWith each box it seems the curators strive to find special pieces and gifts that make a woman feel a little more special than before they opened the box. From scarves, to unique pieces of jewellery and wonderful delights for the kitchen and home, each gift is high quality and made in France. This is what I appreciate most about the boxes: they really do bring you a bit of France with every delivery. I recall last year I received a linen apron, then when travelling in France last summer, I recognized the fields of linen growing, with its little blue flowers, and had I not read the article in the lovely magazine that is also on offer for purchase, I would never have known what the field of lovely blue flowers was. To this day the apron hangs in my kitchen and I use it almost daily!\n\nThese little insights into France and living there, are what I really love too. Keep up the great work, each box is a delight!\n\nLouise Hastie\n\nWhitby, Ontario, Canada\n\n________\n\nDear Louise,\n\nThank you for you custom with us! It brings us so much joy to know that we can add some sparkle in your day with our beautiful French items.\n\nWe take great care when selecting our products and are so humbled to know you appreciate that 🙂 We appreciate you sharing this with us and look forward to bringing you the August Box!\n\nKindly,\n\nThe My Stylish French Box Team\n\nI did not realize there was a MFCH boutique until I received the news in a recent newsletter. I immediately purchased two sets of lavender wands! For many years I have wanted these to scent my linens and woolens. I am utterly delighted with these beautiful handmade, beribboned wands. Now that they have arrived, I find they are too pretty to be tucked away in the linen cupboard so I have them on display in a pedestal bowl on the dining room table. They give me such pleasure every time I glance at them in passing. Come the Fall, they will go to their rightful place amongst the linens. Many thanks!\n\n________\n\nDear Karen,\n\nWe are so happy to know that you are enjoying the MFCH Boutique! The lavender wands are one of our favorite products, they are absolutely divine. Putting them in with your linens in the fall is a great idea 🙂\n\nEnjoy!\n\nKindly,\n\nThe My Stylish French Box Team\n\nThese boxes are wonderful! Sharon and her staff do a magnificent job curating beautiful items for these boxes. Being an ardent Francofile and having been to France over 50 times, I must say these boxes truly represent the essence of France. I use all the items….and smile while using them. The staff is very attentive to their customers. I recently had a broken item (despite careful packaging mishaps can happen during shipping). I immediately emailed MSFB, the next day I had a reply and a week later a replacement arrived. Great customer service. By the way, the presentation is glorious…I have saved all the empty boxes as they are great for storing things. While writing, I must also mention that the magazine is great and I love the Boutique! Do yourself a favor and have a little bit of a France left on your doorstep.\n\n________\n\nDear Gladyce,\n\nThank you so much for your kind words! We are happy to share our bit of France with you 🙂\n\nOur apologies for the broken oil jug, but we are happy that you have received your replacement and can now enjoy!\n\nWe appreciate you sharing this wonderful review!\n\nKindly,\n\nThe My Stylish French Box Team\n\nI have been a subscriber from the second box. Each and every box is a delight and I so look forward to receiving them. It’s like Christmas morning and one’s birthday all rolled into one gorgeously wrapped package. I cannot even say which one is my favorite. You can tell that each item has been picked with care and thought.\n\nThis last box was stolen from the courier warehouse in Toronto (a first for me) and I was so disappointed when I thought I would miss out on the August box. Within a couple of days of notifying Sharon and her team so they could make the claim as the shipper, they had a replacement box sent back out to me. I was like a little kid opening the box last night and I adore everything that was in it. I cannot wait to have friends for dinner, in my little COVID bubble and enjoy the lovely items.\n\nI can barely wait for the November box.\n\nThank you Sharon for your wonderful boxes, the amazing treasures enclosed inside and the joy that you bring every quarter in brightening our days.\n\nMerci\n\nDeborah\n\nI signed up for the boxes after seeing them on the une Femme d’un certain âge. It is so much fun to open the box and see what wonderful surprises are within. I love the different themes for each one. Besides the contents, those white boxes are much too nice to throw away, so I am finding uses for them all around the house.\n\nTheir customer service is top-notch as well. When the olive jug arrived broken, they replaced it and even gave me a choice of color.\n\nThanks for an excellent product and bringing so much joy!\n\n________\n\nDear Carillon,\n\nWe are thrilled to know that you enjoyed the contents in the August Box!\n\nEach is chosen carefully to be an item of quality with high craftsmanship, and a beautiful object that everyone will enjoy- of course with that fun element of surprise too!\n\nThank you so much for being a client and your kind message. We can’t wait for you to receive the next Box!\n\nBest wishes,\n\nThe My Stylish French Box Team\n\nHave been receiving Sharon’s boxes for 2 years now and I love them all.\n\nThis was the first box with 2 problems. It seems like many of us have expressed that the spout does not fit in the olive oil jug. I even paid to order another kind from Amazon and that one is too large as well. It seems as though the openings to these bottles are just a bit too small. Truly disappointing as the bottle is quite lovely. Also, my antique brooch is missing a rhinestone. Since it sounds like you tried to restore them I’m guessing but this one was either missed or the stones came dislodged in shipping although I don’t see it in the box anywhere.\n\nAgain I still love everything and I’m overall pleased but just a bit disappointed.\n\nIt is such a joy to receive and open My Stylish French Box each time they arrive. My husband gave me a year subscription as part of my Christmas gift, and I absolutely love all the wonderful French items in each box. For me the joy of Christmas continues throughout the year.\n\nI love all things French – my friends tell me that I have a French soul – I would love a box based around my favourite French lady – Madame de Pompadour.\n\nThank you to MSFB’s faultless customer service – a broken espresso cup in the May box was replaced so quickly that it is hard to believe there were any postage delays due to COVID-19.\n\nMany thanks to Sharon and the whole team at My Stylish French Box – you provide a truly amazing service under normal circumstances, and now under the restrictions of COVID-19, you provide a bright and happy occasion every couple of months.\n\nWishing you all the best during these troubling times.\n\nMerci beaucoup.\n\nNarda\n\n________\n\nDear Narda,\n\nThank you so much for your support and for such a wonderful idea!\n\nWe love sharing our adoration of France with you, and we are so glad we were able to make you happy!\n\nBest wishes,\n\nThe My Stylish French Box Team\n\nMy December box arrived a couple of weeks ago – my very first! It was wonderful to open and discover each treat included and the fragrance upon opening was divine. Each item was beautifully presented and of very high quality. Sadly, the lipstick was a bit of a disappointment as it was dry and not a pleasant aroma. Perhaps out of date? I was so looking forward to wearing the rouge shade over the holidays. The French have a wonderful way of designing items with such practical purposes such as the pouchette. The cashmere blend scarf has been a constant companion since shoulder surgery last week. Since travel has been impossible in 2020, the box was a good way to feel connected to France. I look forward to the spring box and new discoveries.\n\n________\n\nDear Lynda,\n\nThank you so much for your support! We are so glad you loved the box so much to leave a review!\n\nBest wishes,\n\nThe My Stylish French Box Team\n\nDear Sharon and MFCH team,\n\nIt was with great delight that I opened the latest box, #16, a surprise anniversary gift from my husband. Totally unexpected as we usually don’t exchange gifts on this occasion just before Christmas. In the past I have treated myself to the occasional box and without fail it makes me feel totally spoiled every time! It is as if you know me, the colours of the scarves, pouches and jewelry are always perfect. It is as if we are all dear friends and you even knew that I wrote a final dissertation on Madame de Sévigné in university!\n\nSo thank you, Sharon! You have created a niche where you make lots of us happy, together with a dedicated team who pride themselves in providing great service. In this extraordinary pandemic year your gifts and creations have been a soothing reminder of life as we knew it and to which we will hopefully return soon.\n\nAnd I mustn’t forget to thank you also for the fantastic magazine! I look forward to it with impatient anticipation and I hope to plan my next trip to France around several of the featured locations such as the galleries in and around Paris……..where my soul lives. The photography is stunning and the contributions are always enlightening and interesting.\n\nI hereby send my best wishes and gratitude to you all.\n\nBonne Année!\n\nJuliette\n\nVancouver, B.C.\n\n________\n\nDear Juliette,\n\nThank you so much for your support and such lovely words! It’s thanks to your continuous support that we are able to keep the movement going and being able to bring such joy is a massive priority!\n\nWe hope to see you in France some time soon!\n\nBest wishes,\n\nThe My Stylish French Box Team\n\nAs soon as I receive the email saying the boxes have been shipped, the anticipation rises!! I received the February box on Friday as I was taking my dog out for a walk. I just about mugged the delivery driver when I saw what he was bringing up the drive! My poor pup really needed his walk so I had to put off opening it until we got back from our jaunt around the block, but it was worth the wait. Since it hasn’t been revealed yet, I won’t say anything to spoil the surprise, but I will say…it is one of my favorite boxes ever!! It was packed to the brim and I will joyfully use every single item in it!\n\nThank you MSFB staff for always bringing a smile to may face!!\n\nBetsy Scott\n\nThis is my first-ever box. I have nothing to say but WOW! Upon receiving the box, I opened it to find a broken dish. But, I emailed customer service and within days I had a replacement! I was blown away by the incredible customer service. And the items in the box? Even my husband got excited seeing all the goodies! It’s been fun to start using the new products, tasting the delicious jams and dreaming about what I will cook first from the cookbook! I think I am really going to enjoy the quarterly boxes – I know I am really enjoying this first box!\n\n________\n\nDear Belinda,\n\nThank you so much for your support and for your understanding once again regarding the broken dish. How fun that everyone gets excited haha!\n\nIt is our pleasure to share our bits of France with you and we look forward to sharing more 🙂\n\nBest wishes,\n\nThe My Stylish French Box Team\n\nI just got my first box and I was so pleased with it. Opening the box was such a delight. The presentation was so lovely and everything inside just gorgeous. The Fragonard soap smells heavenly and I love the matching dish which I will probably repurpose as a dish for my rings after I use the soap. The antique serving fork, small ceramic serving dish, the waxed linen bag-they are all so beautiful. It’s like having a friend in Paris go shopping for you. I have been hesitant to order a subscription box in the past as I wondered if I would really want any of it even if the value was there. Well, this box is different. Everything is gorgeous and they are the types of things you might buy on your next trip to Paris but you won’t have to figure out a way to get it all home in your luggage. I had one small issue with my box-the outer box had gotten wet so the magazine inside had also gotten wet and the pages had stuck together. It was not a big deal and I wasn’t complaining as I could still read it. But thought I would mention in case they might want to put the magazine in a waterproof sleeve of some kind in case the outer box gets wet. A few days later a replacement magazine arrived. I was so surprised! Not necessary but so nice. I look forward to my next box which should ship around my birthday. It will be the perfect birthday gift. Thank you so much for putting these boxes together and sharing a little bit of France with us.\n\n________\n\nDear Joan,\n\nThank you so much for your support and sharing your experience with everyone. We are glad to have been able to change your mind on subscription boxes, and glad we were successful in luring you into our little world.\n\nWe look forward to hearing from you in the future!\n\nBest wishes,\n\nThe My Stylish French Box Team\n\nI can not begin to describe my delight with my very first box. Almost every night for the last two weeks I have cooked and baked new recipes from Miss Maggie’s Kitchen cookbook and they are all INCREDIBLE! The flavours are exquisite! This is my new go to cookbook and I am so thankful for it being added to this box. It’s such a hit in my home that I was able to convince my husband that I should get the next box as well! Thank you so much for all the thought and attention to detail that you put into each and every box.\n\n________\n\nDear Ashley,\n\nThank you so much for your kind words! You must share some photos of your dishes with us!\n\nBest wishes,\n\nThe My Stylish French Box Team\n\ni recieved My Stylish French Box today; WOOHOO!!! At last!!! Merci, merci, merci beaucoup!! i feel like i have waited a lifetime.\n\nOMG and what a surprise i got -PERFECT in everyway. From the neatly folded white satin ribbon to the white soft tissues and perfectly designed box; I am sold!!! before i delve into each individually wrapped or boxed gift – i feel like a small child opening a very special birthday gift.\n\nThe colour matching on the Sham cover and flowers on the magazine evoke perfumes of country gardens wafting in the air\n\nThen shock horror!! a very fragile wee Limouges tea cup and saucer managed to travel all the way to New Zealand without gaining even a wee chip. There is just so many beautiful surprises in this Box which i thought would be much smaller than what i recieved.\n\nA few more tissues and wee boxes later and behold Kumesi Green Tea with Rose -perfect for my 6:30am cuppa -hubby stops to inhale the perfume of the tea mixed with hot water and can’t resist the temptation to sample a cup.\n\ni am so engrossed in this box i don’t see the wee gold brooch or serum till later – every piece so well thought out and now i can’t wait to get home this evening to go over my little treasures again.\n\ni have just one small problem – can i get my next box tomorrow please?? :):):)\n\n________\n\nDear Edwina,\n\nThank you so much for your support! It means the world to us that the box means so much to you, and that you adore it this much!\n\nPlease stay in touch, and let us know what you think of the future boxes too, and hopefully one day we’ll be lucky enough to meet you in France!\n\nBest wishes,\n\nThe My Stylish French Box Team\n\nI have received two subscription boxes thus far, and this is one of my favorite subscription box services.\n\nThe highlights of my first box, February Box No. 17, include the Guy Degrenne cheese plate, the Fragonard soap dish, the Miss Maggie’s Kitchen cookbook, the Jacquard Français towel, and the delicious jams from Confiture Parisienne. Not a usual fan of orange marmalade, I was pleased to discover this is the best marmalade I have ever tasted!\n\nIn my second box, May Box No. 18, the Kusmi Tea, the headband from Marlo & Marius, the serum by Mademoiselle Saint Germain, and the French Country Home Magazine were fantastic. Furthermore, I look forward to trying the madeleine cookie mix as I have a madeleine pan which has not yet been used.\n\nThe items in My French Country Home Box are so well curated, the customer service is impeccable, and the packaging is done with a great deal of care. So far, most of the food items have been organic with high quality ingredients, and the boxes do not include too many skin care or perfumed items, which can be an issue with many subscription services and especially for people with allergies. Moreover, if ever an item arrives damaged, the team is quick to respond to customer concerns and to quickly replace the items. If you are looking for a wonderful subscription box experience, this could be the one for you.\n\nI’ve never had the good luck to visit St. Tropez, but opening this box gave me all the feels. Just the sight of the raspberry fouta made me smile. Such a pretty, bright color and so summer-y. Then there was the nougat. I opened it immediately and cut myself a nice slice. Delicious! You’d do the same, I’m sure.\n\nThe box was filled with delightful treasures: my hand cream and body wash were especially appreciated. I loved the scent, “Corsica”, perfect for someone who knows she’d enjoy a yacht trip to that island. The lovely blue floral scarf would a great enhancement to my white yachting clothes. Well, I can dream. I also converted the sunglasses chain to a necklace. Easy to do and far more useful for me. So pretty, too!\n\nThe little porcelain pot I put to use immediately, along with a white plate from the French Country Kitchen box. I added a vase of white mini-mums and it made a perfect late summer accent for my living room.\n\nThe St. Tropez box brought me many moments of joy and I thank Sharon and her team.\n\n_____\n\nDear Mary,\n\nThank you for such an incredibly lovely note from you in regards to our August box. Whenever we read such positive feedback, it brings us as much joy as it does for you when you receive the box. We are so glad you loved the contents, and we hope to keep surprising you in the future boxes.\n\nSending lots of love from France,\n\nSharon and the MFCH team x\n\nYour packaging and style choices are impeccable! Living in California during this COVID era makes France seem so far away. Receiving these boxes gives me the feeling that France is just next door, and I’m so thankful.\n\nThe chain for my glasses is a far more stylish option than having them perched on the end of my nose. The Corsica fragrance of the bath products is beautiful! I would be hard-pressed to want to try the other two, although I’m sure they smell good too.\n\nThe scarf is incredible! The colors are so vibrant and do remind me of the Mediterranean!\n\nEvery piece in the box—the beach wrap, the porcelain—was lovely! Thank you so much!\n\nJ.\n\n______\n\nThank you ever so much for such kind words. It means the world to us that we are able to spark so much joy all the way in California!\n\nMerci from Sharon and the MFCH team x\n\nAfter a busy summer of entertaining family and friends I decided it was time to treat myself to another Stylish French Box. The boxes always exceed my expectations. My husband enjoys the treasures as much as I do and follows me into the living room to partake in the special champagne we purchase to accompany my box opening event.\n\nThis August Box was my favorite! The canvas and leather bag is a treasure. I’ll be using it in the spring. I couldn’t put the waterlily scarf away. I can’t bear to have it our of my sight. I have loved Monet’s water Lillies since I was introduced to them in high school. I have a couple other foutas and just had to have this one in raspberry to add to my collection. They’re so versatile. The sunglasses holder/necklace is another favorite. It’s just the right, light glitter I need this month to wear with my white linen tunic as we move into cooler days here in northern Washington State in the US. The little white vase is perfect for my nightstand with a single bloom of whatever I bring home from the grocery store on Fridays. My husband isn’t into strong scents but we both sincerely appreciate the lovely natural scent of the mint hand lotion and liquid soap. I’m so happy my box came with the mint option. The water color is a special little treat as is the nougat. It will be perfect with a cup of tea. I’m happy I ordered the magazine to accompany my box. It reminds me that I must get a yearly subscription.\n\nThank you so very much for providing this kind service of specially chosen, high quality gifts from France that I will cherish always, along with my other special items I have purchased from you in the past. You are truly thoughtful and kind to share such joy with those of us unable to pop over for a day of sightseeing and shopping.\n\n________\n\nDear Jane\n\nThank you so much for your message. It makes us so happy to hear that clients enjoy all the details of our boxes. Curating each collection is a labor of love, and messages like yours make it all worth while.\n\nKindly\n\nSharon & the MFCH Team\n\nI have now received several boxes from My French Country Home and have been delighted every single time. I opened my February 2022 box today and could not stop smiling as I unwrapped one item more wonderful than the last. I have purchased items after having been introduced to them via the boxes and today received a perfect salt cellar that was exactly what I had been looking for….and had been unable to find on my own! What delight!! It is hard to be surprised once one has passed childhood so the surprises I find in these boxes is just such a gift! Thank you for having such a wonderful product!\n\n*****\n\nBonjour!\n\nThank you ever so mcuh for your message ! The fact you like the items from this bo so much is such a pleasure. Happy Cooking !\n\nWith love from France,\n\nThe MFCH Box Team x\n\nI have been an annual subscriber of the box for a couple of years, and I am typically quite pleased with the items. They are usually quite luxurious and fabulous pieces.\n\nBox21 has many lovely pieces, and overall I am very happy with them. However, please do not send just one teacup that requires a matching cup to be truly useful. This is the second time I have received just one tea cup in my box, and I do not want to buy another matching cup from the boutique. It feels like a blatant effort to get me to buy more. If you are just going to send one item that requires matching pieces then perhaps over the course of the year send the annual subscriber more matching items.\n\nAgain, overall the box is lovely and worth my investment, but I would ask that pieces that are sent to be “stand alone” pieces or send multiples so they can be used.\n\nThank you!\n\n*****\n\nBonjour!\n\nThank you ever so much for your feedback. We take care when selecting items for our boxes, and this is definitely something we’ll be taking note of.\n\nThis is very much appreciated, and we do hope you are looking forward to our future boxes.\n\nWith love from France,\n\nThe MFCH Box Team x\n\nSadly, the only useful items for me in this box are the apron and wicker tray. I did not need any of the other items, they were not particularly special, and the teacup is too heavy/thick. The salt cellar is very nicely made but again, not something I will use. Even the artwork was not as lovely as last year.\n\nAlso, I subscribe to the magazine with my boxes and received an email saying I would get a credit back to my account for the free issue included in Feb. 2022 box. That did not happen.\n\nIt is always so much fun to unwrap each months’ box and discover the items! They are very nicely packaged. My favorite and I think the best box was the 2021 November/December. It had so many useful and lovely items.\n\n*****\n\nBonjour,\n\nThank you for your honest review, it always means a lot to us to read our client’s opinions.\n\nWe have just emailed you, and we hope we can help you resolve this matter quickly.\n\nWith love from France,\n\nThe MFCH Box Team x\n\nTo open my boxes, to me, is like a wonderful dream. I’m very sensitive and appreciate beautiful things. Being in the US now, forgive my fellow Americans, is pretty gloomy. To have such a lovely gift now is uplifting. Also, May is my birthday. I like to unwrap first, then go into the details of the gifts. I’m totally a pen and paper person so much appreciated the pen/pencil holder and the pad. I always try to get French paper when I can. The magazine is so well done. Work of art, as is the box. Please keep the magazine coming with the box. Barnes and Noble, I frequent, doesn’t always have the issues. Please continue with this wonderful idea of gifting the best of France to us. I SO look forward to the next box. My best to you Sharon and your whole, very special staff. You make the world a more beautiful place. We SO need it more than ever now.\n\nI have two friends who are so dear that thanks for all they do can never be enough. I wondered what I could do for them. I decided to buy two August boxes as a special thank you for everything they have done to help with the upcoming marriage of my daughter. We are the intrepid Mother Maids making each of our kid’s weddings extra special with our unique touch which ranges from the “Mother Maids Advice Table” at the rehearsal dinner to outfitting the wedding night hotel room…(yes, we’re a little naughty).\n\nI had them come over, popped a bottle of champagne and watched them open their boxes. They were floored and so was I. It was the perfect special gift and geared the Mother Maids up for a future trip to France – maybe we can convince one of our ten kids to get married overseas…\n\nI eagerly anticipate my box. But have been disappointed lately. Books do not seem to be consistent with the French only theme. The lavender infuser did not work, the exfoliate gel had a horrible fragrance.\n\n_______\n\nDear Cindy\n\nThank you for taking the time to leave your message. We are very sorry if you didn’t like this box, which has been probably our most popular so far!\n\nThe book was all about the experience of arriving and settling into life in France. It’s true that the author, Jamie Beck, is American, but we also announced well ahead of time that we were collaborating with Jamie, and so we thought it would be clear that there was an american element to curating this box.\n\nI’m very sorry to hear that the diffuser didn’t work. All you need to do, is apply a couple of drops of the lavender oil to the ceramic disc, and place in a cupboard or drawer. I think you’ll find that the scent diffuses in a pleasant but not overpowering manner. Please let us know if you still have a problem with this.\n\nFinally, for the body scrub. We deliberately search out high quality products, using natural ingredients. It’s true that there is no overpowering. ‘perfume’ to the scrub, but we love the way it leaves skin so soft and smooth. Allowing you to apply your own scent, without worrying about it conflicting with the fragrance of the scrub.\n\nLike all our clients, your custom is precious to us. I sincerely hope that I have addressed some of your concerns and that you will enjoy the other boxes planned for the year ahead.\n\nKindly\n\nSharon\n\nI have had this subscription for several years. I am stopping now because I have collected too many things that I need to store away that I do not want or can’t use or cannot give away. I am taking a break. Maybe I will resubscribe in the future but for now I have enough things that I need to figure out what to do with.\n\n________\n\nBonjour,\n\nThank you for your support over the years, and we understand your decision to take a break from your subscription.\n\nWe appreciate your honesty about the challenges of accumulating items, and we respect your need to manage your belongings.\n\nShould you decide to resubscribe in the future, we’ll be here to welcome you back with open arms.\n\nIn the meantime, we wish you all the best in finding the perfect solution for your collection.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nThe My French Country Home Box Team\n\nI started with the magazine and decided to try subscribing to the boxes. While a little expensive and indeed an indulgence… it really does feel like a box of beauty… made with love and good old fashioned attention and care for detail.\n\nThe service is fantastic; Sarah/Sharon are always so helpful and accommodating.\n\nI love the element of surprise and the themes for the year echo what I love and appreciate about nature and life. It is a moment to pause… to reflect … be with myself and read the magazine… to give thanks and gratitude. Sometimes I gift on pieces from the box to share with dear friends and family! I love that I know that I am also supporting women and a small business while getting introduced to even more wonderful products and people.\n\nIf you love all things French, appreciate beauty and authentic art… then what is not to love ?! I highly recommend it. Treat yourself!\n\n________\n\nBonjour,\n\nThank you immensely for your heartfelt email!\n\nWe’re thrilled to hear that you’ve found joy and beauty in our subscription boxes.\n\nYour kind words about our service and attention to detail truly mean a lot to us. It’s wonderful to know that you enjoy the element of surprise and that our themes resonate with you.\n\nWe’re grateful for your support and for sharing the experience with your loved ones.\n\nYour recommendation is greatly appreciated.\n\nHere’s to many more moments of beauty and reflection together!\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nThe My French Country Home Box Team\n\nI ordered a beautiful linnen runner and matching napkins that I needed for a special wedding in short notice\n\nThe parcel arrived a week later amazing.\n\nUpon opening I found a beautiful chic white box of great quality the items inside were loving packaged in white tissue and lovely white bow all ready for me to wrap in wedding paper and bow and ready to go .\n\nI am very impressed with total experience of this order but knowing what MFCH stands for trough the magazine that gets better and better all the time it should not have come as a surprise.\n\nTime to start ordering one of the monthly boxes.\n\nThank you to all who made this possible\n\nEllen de Man\n\n________\n\nBonjour,\n\nThank you for your wonderful feedback!\n\nWe’re delighted to hear that you were impressed with your order experience, from the prompt delivery to the beautifully packaged items.\n\nIt’s fantastic to know that our commitment to quality and attention to detail shone through.\n\nWe’re thrilled that you’re considering ordering one of our monthly boxes and we look forward to delighting you further.\n\nThank you for your support and kind words.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nThe My French Country Home Box Team\n\nI recently ordered a pair of espadrilles. They arrived with damaged stitching on the toe. It looked like the person just didn’t finish the design, strings hanging. I looked at my statement and it said no returns or exchanges. Don’t order if you aren’t able to chock up the price of the item plus $25.00 shipping.\n\n________\n\nDear Kathryn,\n\nWe appreciate you taking the time to write a review and we have also contacted you by email.\n\nIt is true that we do not accept returns or exchanges and this is due to expensive import taxes.\n\nHowever, for items damaged or for items that never show up, we have a 10-day policy for our clients to reach out to us to have the problem resolved.\n\nAlthough the 10 days have passed, we would be happy to receive a photo of the espadrilles you received to see what we can do for you\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nThe My French Country Home Box Team\n\nThank you for another wonderful box! The contents were so unique and I know I will enjoy each one. We have a large family so that when I have dinner alone with my husband I like to use all the small special pieces… the little bee butter dish, the salt and pepper cellars… each is a beautiful addition to my table. I love getting my box and opening each gift. Your beautiful wrapping and elegant presentation make it a special time just for me!\n\n________\n\nBonjour,\n\nWe’re thrilled to hear that you enjoyed our latest box!\n\nIt warms our hearts to know that our unique pieces have found a place of honor on your table, adding beauty to your meals with your husband.\n\nYour appreciation for the elegant presentation and the joy you find in opening each gift is exactly what we strive for.\n\nThank you for allowing us to bring a touch of elegance into your home.\n\nWe look forward to continuing to delight you in the future!\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nThe My French Country Home Box Team\n\nWhy did I ever leave?\n\nI’m not sure , but I’m so glad I returned.\n\nMy very favourite item this box has to be the the snail pots, which are now being used for salt and peppers. My poor husband is adjusting to them slowly but surely\n\nThank you Sharon and crew, and it was lovely to meet your beautiful Nina..\n\n________\n\nBonjour,\n\nWelcome back!\n\nWe’re thrilled to have you return to our community. It’s wonderful to hear that the snail pots have become a favorite in your household, even if your husband needs a little time to adjust!\n\nThank you for your kind words, and we are delighted you had the chance to virtually meet Nina.\n\nHere’s to many more delightful moments together!\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nThe My French Country Home Box Team\n\nI love to cook and travel. Prior to purchasing this box, I just went to Paris for the first time and my favorite part of the trip was getting up early in the am and I would walk over to the second arrondissement to cooking shops such as E Dehillerin and G Detou. This box truly captured the experience that I had.\n\nPlease consider having the snack tubes of salted caramel creme in a future. That was the best souvenir that I ever bought for my friends and loved ones.\n\n________\n\nBonjour,\n\nThank you for sharing your wonderful experience with us!\n\nWe’re happy to hear that our box captured the essence of your trip to Paris and brought back fond memories of exploring cooking shops in the second arrondissement.\n\nYour suggestion for the snack tubes of salted caramel creme is duly noted, and we’ll certainly consider it for future boxes.\n\nWe appreciate your support and look forward to continuing to provide you with delightful experiences.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nThe My French Country Home Box Team\n\nI really loved the November box! I have been a subscriber for several years now, and it is definitely one of my all time favourites! I especially appreciated the beautiful cape being 100% viscose as I am allergic to wool which includes cashmere unfortunately.\n\nMy only issue is with the guide that accompanied it. Some of the descriptions were difficult to read. Some of the background photos prevented the text from being clear-the cape, the leather pouch, earrings , lipsticks, Maxim’s pages were especially challenging.\n\n________\n\nBonjour,\n\nThank you for your continued support and kind words about the November box!\n\nWe’re delighted to hear it’s one of your favorites, and we’re thrilled you appreciated the 100% viscose cape, which suits your needs perfectly.\n\nWe apologize for the readability issues with the guide and will take your feedback into consideration for future editions.\n\nYour satisfaction is our priority, and we’re committed to improving your experience.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nThe My French Country Home Box Team\n\nThis is my first MFCH Box, and I am thrilled with it. From the packaging to the items held within, everything felt so elegant! I was surprised at how excited I was to open the box and discover its treasures. My favorite thing was the cape. It is simply beautiful, and I know I will use it often. The earrings are gorgeous but not over the top, just as I like my earrings to be. The liquor glasses are unpretentious and a welcome addition to my dinnerware collection. And what could be more perfect than chocolate? Those little chocolate pearls are to die for! The change purse, the lotion, and the lip liners will all be used well. I am already looking forward to my next MFCH Box!\n\n________\n\nBonjour,\n\nThank you for your glowing review!\n\nWe’re thrilled that your first MFCH Box exceeded expectations and brought you such joy. It’s delightful to hear that every item, from the elegant packaging to the carefully curated treasures inside, resonated with you.\n\nYour enthusiasm for the cape, earrings, liquor glasses, and chocolate pearls warms our hearts.\n\nWe can’t wait to continue surprising and delighting you in future boxes.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nThe My French Country Home Box Team\n\nSharon and Team surpassed my expectations of the Elegant Soiree Box. If pressed hard to pick a favorite item, it would have to be the wallet. I’m thrilled to have received the taupe and the leather is soooo buttery, with that unmistakable smell. I can’t stop touching it. I’ve changed it to my everyday one, who doesn’t need a bit of daily elegance?? I look forward to wearing the cape, also “taupy”, so a great match. The lotion was an extra little unexpected bit of glamor and the earrings are weighty and quality. Even the chocolate was elegant, coming in pearls!!\n\nI agree with another reviewer, some parts of the brochure were quite hard to read but I’d forgotten all about it, being so enamored with the contents. I would have loved to have a maker’s stamp or little tag on the wallet and cape, so I could remember where they are from. Even if it said “made for MFCH by….”\n\nThank you, Sharon and Nina for braving the wind to capture that Nice sunset for us, how thoughtful! Always love the detailed and intimate feel of your unboxings.\n\nThis was my first subscription box and I absolutely cannot wait for the next one. Counting down to February!! Thank you for the joy and anticipation this (and your gorgeous magazine) has brought to my life.\n\n________\n\nBonjour,\n\nYour kind words warm our hearts!\n\nWe’re thrilled that the Soiree Elegant Box surpassed your expectations and brought you such joy.\n\nIt’s wonderful to hear that the taupe wallet has become a daily companion and that every item, from the lotion to the earrings, added a touch of glamour to your life.\n\nYour feedback about the brochure’s readability and the suggestion for maker’s stamps are duly noted, and we’ll strive to improve.\n\nThank you for your appreciation of our efforts, and we can’t wait to continue delighting you in February and beyond!\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nThe My French Country Home Box Team\n\nThis was a good box, not my favorite but still nice.\n\nI love the print! I loved the artwork this year and that they were exclusive to the boxes.\n\nI liked the lip crayons and very happy I got the red set. The wrap was lovely. The earrings were a surprise. I didn’t like them until I put them on. They look very nice with the pearl necklace from several boxes ago, which I wear all the time.\n\nThe antique glasses were sweet!\n\nIndifferent about the body lotion- I wish I had gotten a different color.\n\nNot every item appeals to everyone but that is the beauty of these.\n\nThank you for the thoughtfulness that goes into them.\n\n________\n\nBonjour,\n\nThank you for sharing your thoughts on the latest box.\n\nWe’re glad to hear you enjoyed the exclusive print and found the lip crayons and wrap to your liking. It’s wonderful to know that even the earrings grew on you, complementing your existing pieces beautifully.\n\nWe appreciate your honest feedback and understand that not every item will resonate with everyone.\n\nRest assured, we’ll continue striving to curate boxes that delight and surprise. Thank you for being a part of our community!\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nThe My French Country Home Box Team\n\nI have been enjoying this year’s advent box. Early in the morning before everyone else is up, opening up one of these gifts has been such a happy moment of the day. The product selection is beautiful curated and I am inspired to make a similar gift box for other family members and friends. Count me in for next year.\n\n________\n\nBonjour,\n\nWe’re thrilled to hear that our advent box has been bringing you joy each morning!\n\nIt’s wonderful to know that our curated selections have inspired you to create similar gifts for your loved ones.\n\nWe’re grateful for your support and enthusiasm, and we can’t wait to have you join us again for next year’s advent box.\n\nThank you for being a part of our community!\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nThe My French Country Home Box Team\n\nI have always loved anything that is French. When I discovered this outlet that actually sends authentic French things – I knew I had to splurge on me! I just love each box that comes. There is always something that is fabulous and fancy. I think I equate French things with fine things. You do not disappoint with your boxes. Thanks for giving me that unique experience of having a few fine things in my personal life her in Alaska.\n\n________\n\nBonjour,\n\nThank you for your glowing review!\n\nWe’re delighted to hear that our authentic French selections bring you joy and elegance.\n\nYour appreciation for the fine things in life resonates with us, and we’re thrilled to provide you with a unique experience right in Alaska.\n\nYour support means the world to us, and we’re committed to continually delighting you with each box.\n\nMerci beaucoup for being a part of our community!\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nThe My French Country Home Box Team\n\nIt is so nice to receive nice surprises. There are so many surprises in the world that are not so nice, so it’s great when you can give yourself a gift every few months that is always a charming welcome. I smile whenever I open these boxes. many times I will take things from it and gift them to others for birthdays or special occasions. Or if going to lunch with a special friend who is a great cook or entertains, there is always a part of these gifts that will truly be loved by the receiver.\n\nThis month, the book by Marin Montagut, is just so much fun to look through. I always tease that ‘my boyfriend’ has left a gift for me, or comment when I see his picture from the emails. How many emails do we put in the trash? Lots! The MFCH emails are always a refreshing welcome with many tips for entertaining and garden. I get the magazine each month and love to sip a cup of tea in my garden while reading it. The long stem candles by Maison Pechavy are gorgeous. The floral glass tumbler, perfectly classy with a flower from my garden happily giving a nice pop of color to my countertop. The hand-soap, super fragrant. The lovely antique cutlery, going to a French lady friend as a thank you for lunch. Too many things to list in each box, but if you have never purchased one, you won’t be disappointed. Gift cards from wonderful curators as well. I look forward to the next box! Thank you Sharon!\n\n________\n\nBonjour,\n\nYour heartfelt words truly resonate with us!\n\nWe’re thrilled to bring you joy and charming surprises with each box. It’s heartening to hear how you share the delight with loved ones, making each gift a cherished memory.\n\nYour enthusiasm for our curated selections, from Marin Montagut’s book to Maison Pechavy’s candles, inspires us to continue delivering exceptional experiences.\n\nThank you for being a valued part of the MFCH community.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nThe My French Country Home Box Team\n\nThis was my first box and i was really excited to see what delights were inside. I was happy with most of it. I could smell the insides before I opened the box. A couple things were too perfumed-I prefer more natural smells, like FRENCH LAVENDER! Even honey or something that smelled like the ocean around Nice! I guess I would be happiest picking the things that came in options, like the hand soap in a couple scents, the glass that had 3 different floral designs, the dessert utensils, etc. I guess the best thing for me is to wait until some of the things are offered individually since I am on the picky side!!!\n\n________\n\nBonjour,\n\nThank you for sharing your thoughts on your first MFCH Box.\n\nWe’re delighted that most of the items brought you joy! We appreciate your feedback regarding scent preferences and will strive to offer more natural options in the future.\n\nYour suggestion for customizable options is noted, and we’ll explore ways to accommodate individual preferences.\n\nWe look forward to continually improving and hope to exceed your expectations in the future.\n\nThank you for choosing MFCH!\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nThe My French Country Home Box Team\n\nBeing a long time subscriber, as a perk, I would love to have the option for subscribers of say 5 years or so be given a palate choice. I much prefer items of color to be in the pastel range, esp the pinks and purples. Often on looking through the booklet I see an item in another color and wish I had received that one. Sometimes I have ordered the different color as I did recently on the small leather pouch with zipper and snap closing. I realize you have many subscribers and it would be impossible to suit everyones color choice. It would certainly be a lovely bonus for those of us long time subscribers to have a general palate choice.\n\nThank you\n\n________\n\nBonjour,\n\nThank you for your loyalty and insightful suggestion.\n\nWe appreciate your feedback and understand the desire for personalized color choices. While accommodating individual preferences for every subscriber is challenging, we’ll certainly explore options to enhance your experience, perhaps through occasional palette choices for long-time subscribers.\n\nYour satisfaction is important to us, and we’ll strive to make each box a delightful surprise tailored to your tastes.\n\nThank you for being a cherished part of our community.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nThe My French Country Home Box Team\n\nI agree that it would be nice to make some personal choices but that would eliminate the element of surprise, which is one of the greatest charms of this box. It would be hard to know scent preferences anyway, without the ability to give them all a sniff. That being said, I was mostly enchanted with the contents. The color scheme is beautiful! I’m pleased to receive a book. Fortunately, I like all the scented items and they’re all out for use already! Even if I don’t care for a particular scent there’s always something about the beautiful packaging and the fact that it was flown to me from France with great care and selection by Sharon that still makes it so special. The tapers have already graced a dinner, what an elegant perk up that was! I originally wished I’d received the pinks and blues but the greens and neutrals are quite versatile and equally stunning.\n\nI was a little disappointed in the print that started the year. I thought it would be a bigger size and have more embellishment on the card, like his chair print I see online. I love the choice of envelope color but would have preferred the green to surround the card, as a sort of matting I guess? I might try to cut and create my own frameable piece. I’m not sure what size/type of frame the existing card would need. I did think the box would have more elements of his style and aesthetic but I understand space is limited.\n\nThank you, Sharon and MFCH team, always a delight.\n\n________\n\nBonjour,\n\nThank you for your thoughtful feedback!\n\nWe’re glad you appreciate the element of surprise in our box. Your satisfaction is our priority, and we’ll take your suggestions into consideration for future editions.\n\nIt’s heartening to hear that despite minor preferences, you found joy in our carefully curated selections.\n\nWe aim to continue delighting you with each delivery.\n\nThank you for being a part of MFCH!\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nThe My French Country Home Box Team\n\nI just opened my February box. I loved everything that arrived in the box! I can’t wait to sit down and peruse the Extraordinary Collections book. Everything in the box is useful and beautiful. I especially loved the candles and holders. I am looking forward to using the hand soap on my sourced from Provence sink in my “fancy” powder room! It is so fitting along with my Fragonard hand towels from a previous box.\n\nReceiving the box is such a special treat for me. We have visited France three times and most recently biked through Normandy and Brittany! We biked through Provence several years ago and I reminisce often about that trip as well. The box is a great way to receive thoughtful and beautiful French brands.\n\nIn our most recent trip (Normandy & Brittany) we flew in and out of Paris. My husband is the flight and hotel reservation guy of the two of us. The George V is typically our go to hotel, and we again stayed there upon arrival. He was having trouble coming up with an alternative hotel on our return to Paris (heading to states). I pulled out a recent MFCH magazine that had listed some of your favorite Paris hotels. The Lutetia was on the list. We booked it and it most certainly did not disappoint. So much so that my very picky husband said that it has replaced his favorite George V hotel. He especially liked the location as it much less touristy than being around the Champs. Thank you so much for your recommendations in the MFCH magazines.\n\nSincerely,\n\nDebby Rauh\n\n________\n\nDear Debby,\n\nThank you immensely for your glowing review!\n\nIt’s wonderful to hear that each item in the February box brought joy, especially the candles and holders. Your fond memories of France resonate deeply, and we are delighted the MFCH magazine recommendations enhanced your Paris experience. Your support means the world to us. Here’s to many more delightful moments with MFCH!\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nThe My French Country Home Box Team\n\nSeveral months ago, I saw a beautiful soap from La Maison Godet in Saint-Paul de Vence that "
