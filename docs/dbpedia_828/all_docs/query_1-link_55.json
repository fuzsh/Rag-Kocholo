        "text": "Brooklyn artist Margaret Withers presents her fascinating collection of “Curious American Landscapes.” Enjoy, and visit her website for more about her mixed media artwork.\n\nMy father worked for different Texas oil companies in the 1970’s and 80’s, and because of the nature of the work, every two or three years my family was uprooted, moved across county lines, and resettled – from Hays County to El Paso County, then to Nueces, Harris, and Bexar Counties.\n\nThis series of paintings depict the emotional landscape of my childhood as I remember it; a blur of color and movement flashing by the static iconography of the past of those tiny company houses where the roughnecks lived and old-style telephone poles.\n\nAnd sometimes, enveloping this landscape, out of balance in scale, space, and perspective, are these figures that seem to dominate and subdue, not with violence, but with curiosity and playful interaction.\n\nIncluding undertones of play and humor is my way of engaging the viewer, extending an invitation to spend some time in this space, to figure out the story, or to pretend a new one. Besides a narrative element, I’m also trying to capture a fluid emotional response to nature and to time.\n\nWhat I love about painting is the discovery of how art progresses, so my goal is to be further along, closer to some truth, and to have my current style tightened and expanded.\n\nMy business goal is be brave and bold and to get my art out there for people to see it and to adopt it into their own constantly changing family narrative.\n\nI’m in a group show this summer at The Drawing Center in New York City where the phrase I was invited to respond to is warm::silence, and it’s been a lot of fun for me to puzzle out how to communicate warm::silence in my own style.\n\nOut of this I’ve also started working in 3-dimensional paper-fold art and I have some ideas for small sculptures that I hope to start working on."
