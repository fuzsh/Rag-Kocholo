        "text": "Trip planning technology (the integration of transit route and schedule data on a map) enables riders to determine how to use transit to get where they need to go. General Transit Feed Specification, more commonly known as GTFS, is the world standard format for uploading schedule and geographic data (route alignment and bus stops) to trip planners, such as Google Transit, Apple Maps, Bing and Transit App, etc.\n\nTo get started with GTFS Builder, click the Download button in the banner above. For more introductory information, see the “Tools that Connect: Online Trip Planners and GTFS Builder” technical brief.\n\nIn support of the National Transit Database (NTD) GTFS reporting requirements for fixed and deviated fixed route service, National RTAP is offering GTFS Office Hours on Thursdays at 1:00-1:30 PM ET. Meet with our instructor, share your screen, and ask questions. Use this link to join via Zoom – no need to register.\n\nAnyone with a willingness to learn can build GTFS data files. National RTAP offers free, expert and personalized support through the process. GTFS Builder is a free Microsoft Excel-based web application which assists rural and tribal transit agencies to develop and generate fully valid GTFS for their bus routes. National RTAP partnered with Marcy Jaffe from Transnnovation, Inc. to develop GTFS Builder.\n\nGTFS Builder consists of two Excel files including the ImportExport file and the Schedule Generator file. Using the ImportExport file, data which defines the attributes of agencies, service days, fare types, routes, stops and others are entered using one of the 12 data tabs.\n\nThe Schedule Generator file is used only to input trip schedules and generate trips and stop_times information. The Schedule Generator file can also be used independently to generate an agency’s schedule or table to be uploaded to an agency website.\n\nThe GTFS Builder Guidebook provides a simple step by step instructions for entering data into each tab of the ImportExport and Schedule Generator files. The Guidebook also includes a checklist to help estimate the time to complete each step and track your progress. The Guidebook is included in the GTFS Builder download file or can be downloaded separately here:\n\nFinally, when data entry is completed in the ImportExport file, data in each tab is exported into separate text files using an automated process. A GTFS data file is the result of compressing or “zipping” these text files together. GTFS data can be posted to a URL, and that URL is then shared with trip planners, such as Google Maps. National RTAP offers free and secure hosting of a URL which contains the GTFS data. This is available on your GTFS Builder Dashboard, which becomes visible once you have signed into your Cloud account.\n\nAgency Website with Schedules\n\nIf your agency plans to publish its GTFS data at Google Maps, Google Inc. requires an agency have a website and that the website accurately displays routes and schedules that exactly match those represented by GTFS data. National RTAP can help! Build your own website using Website Builder 3.0 or contact us for further assistance (support@nationalrtap.org).\n\nLicense Agreements\n\nAt this time, many trip planners do not require signing a formal licensing agreement. However, for your trip data to be available on Google Maps, Google Inc. requires an agency to agree to the terms of its License Agreement. The agreement is provided by Google Inc. as part of the Google Transit Program. There is no fee to sign the agreement. The agreement must be digitally signed by an authorized representative of your agency. A sample agreement can be reviewed here: Sample Agreement.pdf\n\nSome agencies find understanding and signing the Google License Agreement difficult. A practicing attorney provides a detailed explanation of terms of agreement in this video. Otherwise, consider publishing to many other trip planners and re-evaluating Google Maps at a later date.\n\nHardware/Software Requirements\n\nA Personal Computer (PC) or Mac operating with Bootcamp or Parallels\n\nMicrosoft Excel, version 2010 or more recent (macros enabled)\n\nGoogle Earth Pro on Desktop. A free version of Google Earth Pro can be downloaded here.\n\nSkill and Time Requirements\n\nBeginner to intermediate level Microsoft Excel skills\n\nBeginner familiarity with Google’s My Maps\n\nBeginner familiarity with Google Earth\n\nInitial Data Input - Average 4 hours per route\n\nMaintenance: Approximately 4 hours per year, assuming minor route or stop changes"
