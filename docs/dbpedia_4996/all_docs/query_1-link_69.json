It will typically contain the name of the site from which the cookie has come, the 'lifetime' of the cookie, and a value, usually a randomly generated unique number. It allows a website to remember things like your preferences or what's in your shopping basket.\n\nHow does Glasgow Science Centre use cookies?\n\nCookies enable us to remember your device, or you when you have logged in. When you visit our website we send you cookies which may be used in the following ways:\n\nTo remember that you have logged in or that you have added items to your shopping basket, and to personalise the pages that you view based on this information.\n\nTo compile anonymous, aggregated statistics that allow us to understand how users use our site and to help us improve the structure of our website. We cannot identify you personally in this way.\n\nTwo types of cookies may be used on this website: session cookies, which are temporary cookies that are retained by your browser until you close it, and persistent cookies, which remain in the cookie store of your browser between successive visits to the site.\n\nWe don't sell the information collected by cookies, nor do we share the information with third parties, except where required by law as per our Privacy Policy.\n\nDetails of the exact cookies our website uses are available in the table below.\n\nMore about Google Analytics Advertising Features and Google Signals\n\nWe use Google Signals, a feature of Google Analytics, to enable cross-device remarketing and advertising reporting. This feature allows Google to collect data about users across multiple devices, using techniques such as device graphs and anonymous identifiers.\n\nGoogle Signals respects the privacy settings of users and does not collect any personally identifiable information. It also provides users with the option to opt-out of cross-device tracking by turning off ad personalization in their Google Account settings.\n\nHow can I control cookies?\n\nIf you don't want to receive cookies, you can change your web browser's settings so that it notifies you when cookies are sent to it or you can refuse cookies altogether. You can also delete cookies that have already been set.\n\nYou can choose whether to accept cookies that are set by Glasgow Science Centre through your browser's cookie settings. More information on what this entails is available from the Information Commissioner's Office.\n\nMost of our site will work without cookies, but you will lose some of the interactive features and functionality of our site if you choose to disable cookies, notably those related to logging in and purchasing tickets.\n\nYou have the right to opt-out of Google Analytics Advertising Features and Google Signals by using the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on or by adjusting your ad personalization settings in your Google Account."
