        "text": "In 1892 it was announced that the final route of the Highland Railway would pass through Tomatin. With this, local man John MacDougall, born and bred in Tomatin, began planning his distillery. The Tomatin Spey District Distillery was registered on 8th June 1897, however unfortunately it was closed in 1906.\n\nLuckily, the company was purchased by experienced wine and spirits merchants and reopened as the New Tomatin Distillers Company Ltd. in 1909, bringing the distillery back into operation with 2 stills capable of producing 225,000 litres of alcohol per year.\n\nFollowing the Second World War, demand for Scotch whisky boomed globally. To meet this demand new distilleries were built, closed distilleries reopened and established distilleries expanded, but nobody expanded to the same scale of Tomatin. By 1974 Tomatin had 23 stills capable of producing 12.5 million litres of alcohol per year, making it the largest malt distillery in the world.\n\nThe recessions of the 1980s and early 1990s saw the closure of several, now celebrated, distilleries but Tomatin’s closure stood out from the rest. The majority of distilleries that closed at this time were deemed to be inefficient or outdated. Not only was Tomatin the largest and most efficient malt distillery in Scotland but was full of state of the art technology.\n\nAs a result, it did not stay closed for long, and in February 1986 two Japanese companies, Takara Shuzo and Okura & Co., purchased the distillery to form the Tomatin Distillery Co. Ltd., of which Takara Shuzo proudly remains the majority shareholder to this day.\n\nWe took the decision to remove some of our unused stills, reducing the total number from 23 to 12 (which remain in situ today) which marks the change in business focus from the mass production for the blended Scotch whisky market to growing our range of single malts.\n\nRecognising the excellent quality of our lightly peated single malt which we had been producing for one week each year since 2005, the Cù Bòcan single malt brand is launched. Focusing on unusual cask maturations, this brand has gone from strength to strength.\n\nA change in packaging and a new marketing style allowed the Tomatin Single Malt brand to truly shine and more accurately reflect its deserved place in the crowded whisky market. With a top class wood policy in place, Tomatin has become known for taking whisky lovers on an inimitable journey of age and cask maturations, each one bursting with flavour and unique characteristics while showcasing the classic Tomatin house style; unpeated, light, soft and fruity.\n\nThe world has been through a lot in recent years, and we continue to face uncertainty and unrest. But with the unity we have seen from our partners around the world, the devotion from our team and growing support from our loyal customers, we are reminded of what really matters. Our people matter. Our community matters. Our product matters. So we raise a toast to you from Tomatin. To what matters."
