        "text": "When Scott Jenkins and James McDiarmid go for a run they juggle all the way.\n\nThey are among the growing number of people who practise joggling - a competitive sport that combines juggling with jogging.\n\nThe pair admit that they get some funny looks and comments when they are training in Edinburgh.\n\nBut Scott says: \"I know it's all in good jest. I would love people to know it's not just us showing off but that it's actually a very fun sport.\"\n\nThe 27-year-old data scientist, who is originally from Somerset, had taught himself juggling and then started joggling in 2018.\n\nScott said his running performance had plateaued so he needed to find something else to motivate him.\n\n\"I was getting bored of running and then I found out that joggling only slows you down by between 5% and 10%, so I thought this would be my new fun challenge in races.\n\n\"It was slow going to start with. I didn't start doing races but instead did lots of training runs.\n\n\"Then I dared to enter my first park run as a joggler. I was nervous at the start and a bit self-conscious because I didn't know what people would think.\n\n\"But that soon went away when I saw how supportive everyone was and then I just caught the joggling bug.\"\n\nJogglers can use any set of three or more objects, but juggling balls are the most common.\n\nIn competitions or long-distance events, most jogglers prefer to use palm-size beanbags stuffed with birdseed because they are light enough for the challenge but heavy enough to withstand winds.\n\nThe rules state that a juggling pattern must be kept while running. If an object is dropped, the joggler must return to that point before they continue.\n\nAfter six months of practice, Scott had mastered the art of running for miles without dropping three balls.\n\nHe said: \"People say it's really difficult but if you can juggle three balls and you are physically fit then you can do it.\n\n\"The trick is not to look at your hands and to look through the pattern of the balls at the road ahead.\"\n\nScott and James can each juggle five balls while running, but three is the optimum number while racing.\n\nScott has created a website to showcase joggling results from around the world, and has found nearly 600 jogglers from 26 countries across the globe.\n\nHis own joggling career has included five half marathons and the Abingdon marathon in Oxfordshire last October.\n\n\"I was super pleased to cross the finish line, after four hours I could finally give my arms a rest,\" he said.\n\n\"I had one drop, at mile 21. That was pretty crushing. One lapse of concentration and gravity took back control.\n\n\"I remember standing by the side of the road for a minute to regroup and get my head back in focus.\n\n\"Otherwise, I loved it. Most people have never seen it before so I guess it'd a bit of a spectacle.\"\n\nScott's personal best time for a half marathon is one hour and 22 minutes - and he can joggle the same distance in one hour and 27 minutes.\n\nHe will team up with James in May to tackle the Edinburgh Marathon.\n\nJames, who is originally from Inverness, works as a teaching assistant in Edinburgh.\n\nThe 35-year-old only started joggling eight months ago, although he has been juggling for 12 years as a circus performer and magician.\n\n\"I have the joggling bug now, absolutely,\" he said.\n\n\"I do 90% of my runs joggling now and feel odd if I'm running without them.\n\n\"It's added 30 minutes to my marathon time but that's fine.\"\n\nJames says that joggling gives him an ache in his shoulders and a sore neck.\n\nBut he added: \"It's fun when you see runners feeling like they have to try to pass you because you're juggling.\n\n\"I especially love the banter from people and the funny looks.\""
