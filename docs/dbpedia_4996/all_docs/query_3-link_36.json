        "text": "This summer marks 10 years since Glasgow hosted the 2014 Commonwealth Games - an event that could return to the city in 2026.\n\nCommonwealth Games Scotland has offered Glasgow as a back-up plan if games organisers cannot find another host nation.\n\nBut with tighter public budgets, a cost of living crisis and the challenges of putting on a major event like this, do Glaswegians really want the games to come back?\n\nThe Commonwealth Games has faced considerable difficulty in recent years.\n\nThe 2022 edition was moved to Birmingham after South African hosts Durban were stripped of the event after a series of missed deadlines and financial problems.\n\nThen Victoria in Australia pulled out as 2026 hosts also citing financial issues.\n\nIt left games organisers trying to find another location at short notice.\n\nWith a number of venues already built and the 2014 games well attended, Glasgow could appeal as a quick and safe solution.\n\nIt was hailed by organisers as a \"stand-out\" games in the event's history.\n\nIt was a sporting success for Scotland too, with the hosts landing 53 medals - the nation's highest ever tally.\n\nThe 2014 edition featured 18 sports, and just under 5,000 athletes in the city.\n\nThis would not be replicated, as Commonwealth Games Scotland has proposed a stripped back edition to save on costs.\n\nTheir initial proposal suggested 10 to 13 sports would be held.\n\nOf that number, both athletics and swimming are guaranteed to be on the list with the remainder chosen at the discretion of the hosts.\n\nThat could see a sport like hockey selected, given Glasgow has the National Hockey Centre in place, while cycling would almost certainly be picked and held at the Emirates Arena.\n\nThe East End venue could hold indoor athletics as well, having welcomed the World Athletics Indoor Championships in March.\n\nTrack and field could be a trickier sport to solve, as the 2014 edition used a revamped Hampden Park - a transformation that took considerable time and cost to achieve.\n\nExperts have also stressed that other aspects would be scaled down.\n\nProfessor Gayle McPherson is director of the Centre for Culture, Sport and Events at University of the West of Scotland, and also served as a member of the Glasgow 2014 bid committee.\n\nShe said: âWeâd be looking at a very different games to 2014, though â almost a reset of what the games are. As we live through a cost of living crisis, thereâs much more of an appetite to do things differently.\n\nâFor example, we might see a pared back opening and closing ceremony, hosted somewhere like the Hydro - and we wouldnât have dedicated games lanes on the roads as we did last time.\"\n\nThis is arguably the biggest question of all.\n\nThe 2014 edition saw an estimated 96% of tickets sold, with the city blessed with good weather throughout.\n\nHowever, 10 years later many Glaswegians are grappling with the ongoing cost of living crisis.\n\nGlasgow City Council is facing the possibility of years of budget cuts, with a reduction in the number of teachers and care workers and a rise in school meal prices among the ways the local authority are seeking to save money.\n\nOrganisers say they have undertaken a feasibility study but how much of that involved gauging public opinion?\n\nBBC Scotland News found a variety of views in Glasgow.\n\nLily McColm, an activity instructor, said: \"The funding, depending on where it comes from, will be a concern for a lot of people given the state of the economy at the moment.\n\n\"But I think it's important to take part in things like that when the world is rubbish and when times are hard. It's something that can foster a bit of hope.\"\n\nJohn Dempsey said: \"I think it's a good idea as long as we can afford it.\n\n\"Right now the government keep telling us that there's cutbacks. I'd be all for it if it was within a budget we could afford.\"\n\nAlison Cairns felt the previous Glasgow Games was a \"positive experience\".\n\nShe added: \"I think having large events, and sporting events that are not just football, would be a good thing.\"\n\nUltimately this rescue plan will live or die on whether the people of Scotland, and Glasgow in particular, have an appetite for something that appears unpalatable to so many others.\n\nCommonwealth Games Scotland says the event would possess \"no significant ask of public funds\".\n\nTheir proposal uses a \" significantly reduced budget costing Â£130 to Â£150m\", with Â£100m from the Commonwealth Games Federation.\n\nThe balance would be made up through commercial income, such as ticketing, sponsorships and broadcasting rights.\n\nIn contrast, the budget for 2014 was Â£543m, with Â£425m from the Scottish government and from Glasgow City Council.\n\nThis time the council seems to be keeping a safe distance until more is known.\n\nIt said there was no Glasgow bid at this stage, and that the proposal had come from Commonwealth Games Scotland - although the council was providing support and technical advice.\n\nIan Reid CBE, the chair of Commonwealth Games Scotland, said that there was a need for a model that did not rely on large public investment.\n\nHe added: \"We believe our concept provides the CGF with a viable, cost effective and exciting solution which importantly wonât involve significant sums of public funding.\"\n\nOne way to help save on costs would be to use existing infrastructure, but questions remain regarding other aspects of the plan.\n\nThe athletes village built for 2014 has been converted into housing, so another location would be required.\n\nA wider issue is that while potential organisers could sell the prospect of another big sporting event to the public, itâs more difficult to sell an obvious legacy this time around.\n\nThere will be no building of new venues, no new housing for an athleteâs village and no huge infrastructure investment for the city.\n\nIf the city council is to give the kiss of life to an event many see as in terminal decline, they will have to be creative in explaining why.\n\nThe Commonwealth Games Federation says it is working with a number of Commonwealth Games Associations (CGAs) over \"further detailed assessments\" of possible hosts.\n\nThe organisation declined to reveal who the possible hosts were, saying the associations had asked for confidentiality.\n\nThey added that a decision could come in May.\n\nHowever, the frontrunners for the 2030 edition, Canada, have already seen two possible bids, from the province of Alberta and the city of Hamilton, scrapped.\n\nThe fact that nobody seems keen on hosting even a streamlined version is ringing alarm bells within the organisation and throwing up questions about the eventâs long term future."
