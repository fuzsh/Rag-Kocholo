        "text": "G'night!\n\nFT: Glasgow Warriors 38-26 Zebre\n\nGlasgow don't make things easy on themselves and tonight proved that but a bonus point win puts them in good standing as they have the painful wait to see where the finish in the top four.\n\nFor now they are second behind Leinster but with Munster to face Ulster and Bulls to face Sharks tomorrow, it could all change.\n\nWe will be back tomorrow afternoon with coverage of Benetton v Edinburgh, hope to see you all then!\n\nStay safe and have a good weekend!\n\n'I hate that word complacency'\n\nFT: Glasgow Warriors 38-26 Zebre\n\nGlasgow Warriors head coach Franco Smith tells Premier Sports at full time: \"I never expected Zebre to roll over to be honest. We made it loose and the boys wanted to get a lot of it done in the first half but there were just too many soft turnovers. It's the first time in a long time that the sun was shining and there wasn't the same pressure as next week will have. We will take the win but it will be very different next week.\n\n\"I hate that word complacency because it's got no smell, no taste, no foot prints but it's always present. We try and fight that and it slipped in tonight. Next week is obviously a different challenge, it's an opportunity at home and there's a lot to come from this team. Maybe tonight we weren't as accurate as we should've been.\n\n\"It is going to be important to understand that ability in a play off game. Most of the time we are our own worst enemy. What's fantastic is that tonight the season is done, we draw a line under 2024 and we focus on play-off rugby only. It's a completely different mind set.\"\n\nGlasgow 'possess quality'\n\nFT: Glasgow 38-26 Zebre\n\nChris Paterson\n\nFormer Scotland international on Premier Sports\n\nYou can see the quality that Glasgow possess. They have to improve of course. They'll be happy with the scrum, they'll be happy with the victory and of course the bonus point but they'll be frustrated with the number of turnovers.\n\nSome of the attack they were second guessing themselves which comes with a bit of nerves. I think Franco [Smith] will be pleased in some ways that it was far from perfect because the step up that's going to be needed in the next two, three, four weeks is evident and almost frustration of a performance will allow them to be hard on each other.\n\nPost\n\nFT: Glasgow Warriors 38-26 Zebre\n\nChris Paterson\n\nFormer Scotland international on Premier Sports\n\nIt'll be interesting how many games Zebre had like that all season. I think it would be six, seven, eight that they lose in the last 20 minutes. Maybe one or two heavier defeats they were never in the game but if Zebre can turnaround one or two of those results then it's a completely different picture.\n\nIf they're not used to winning that's where they lose it.\n\nGlasgowâs defence is going backwards\n\nFT: Glasgow Warriors 38-26 Zebre\n\nTom English\n\nBBC Scotland's chief sports writer on Sportsound\n\nGlasgow beat Zebre by 31 points in Parma last month. Tonight, at home, they had to fight hard to put them away. Fair play to Zebre, but you have to be worried about Glasgowâs turnovers and the weakening of their defence in their last three games. Theyâve lost their way. 110 points conceded in three games. They have a massive amount of to do before the quarter-final. Probably going to be against the Stormers.\n\nPost\n\nFT: Glasgow Warriors 38-26 Zebre\n\nPlayer of the Match Rory Darge tells Premier Sports; \"From us it was some game, a bit nervy towards the end. I think that's because of how well Zebre play, they put us under a bit of pressure so we're delighted to get the win in the end.\n\n\"We were under no illusions as to what kind of team we were up against today. You watch all their games and they're right in it until the last 20. We knew it was going to be a tough one and we're delighted to be on the right end of the result.\n\n\"The last game of the regular season at home, off the back of two losses it's good to get the win going into the play offs. We've got the confidence that we can win those gritty games that you expect in the play offs. We're delighted to show that sort of character and get the win.\n\n\"Obviously we've got to take it one game at a time.\"\n\nConverted try GLASGOW WARRIORS 38-26 Zebre\n\nTom Jordan\n\nGlasgow are looking to get one more score before the final whistle and this Zebre defence are throwing the kitchen sink at them trying to keep them out.\n\nThey fall short as Euan Ferrie and Tom Jordan link up nicely on the far side and Jordan wriggles over for the score.\n\nThe fly-half has been everywhere since he came on.\n\nGeorge Horne adds the extras and Glasgow have done it!"
