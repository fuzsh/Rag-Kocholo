        "text": "Thirdly, recent reports have suggested that millennials in particular are turning away from alcoholic tipples and looking for low or no-alcohol options, with the result that more bars, pubs and restaurants than ever are now choosing to stock kombucha as part of their soft drink offering.\n\nWe taste-tested over 30 varieties of kombucha to bring you our top buys, from plain options to interesting flavours (ginger, pink grapefruit and more) and options that can even replace sparkling wines. For more drinks inspiration, visit our product review section and discover over 400 round-ups, guides and mocktail recipes on our alcohol-free drinks hub.\n\nMore like this\n\nBest kombucha to buy at a glance\n\nBest sweet kombucha: Momo raspberry hibiscus kombucha, £45 (12 x 330ml)\n\nBest spiced kombucha: No.1 Living Ginger kombucha, £5.25 (4 x 250ml)\n\nBest easy-drinking kombucha: Remedy kombucha, from £18.49 (12 x 250ml)\n\nBest ethical kombucha: HOLOS Citra Hops kombucha, £33.99 (12 x 330ml)\n\nBest passion fruit kombucha: Jarr kombucha passion fruit, £24.52 (8 x 330ml)\n\nBest pink grapefruit kombucha: Equinox Organic Kombucha Pink Grapefruit & Guava, £2.20 (275ml)\n\nBest plain kombucha: Left Field Sencha Green kombucha, £34.80 (12 x 330ml)\n\nBest tropical kombucha: L.A Brewery tropical ginger kombucha, £35 (12 x 330ml)\n\nBest sparkling wine alternative: Real Kombucha Dry Dragon, £9.48 (750ml)\n\nBest sour kombucha: Real Kombucha Royal Flush, £9.50 (750ml)\n\nBest ginger kombucha: Blighty Booch kombucha organic ginger, £38 (12 x 330ml)\n\nBest rosé alternative: L.A Brewery sparkling English blush, £12 (750ml)\n\nBest smooth kombucha: You + I Kombucha Original, £35 (12 x 330ml)\n\nBest champagne alternative: L.A Brewery Sparkling English Rose Kombucha, £12 (750ml)\n\nWhat is kombucha?\n\nTo make kombucha, firstly, the tea is brewed and sweetened with sugar to help feed the fermentation process. Next, a scoby is added (an acronym that stands for 'symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast') along with some starter liquid.\n\nA permeable lid is attached and the mixture left to ferment for several days – this is the primary fermentation. When the kombucha is bottled for its secondary fermentation, flavourings can be added, including fruit, herbs, spices or other ingredients such as coffee, coconut water or rose petals.\n\nThe end result? A live, fermented drink that is effervescent, slightly sour, and can be flavoured with a huge variety of ingredients. Just like wine or beer, every kombucha recipe is unique, with the flavour profile, appearance and level of fizz depending on which ingredients and methods have been used during the brewing and fermentation process.\n\nBest kombucha to buy 2024\n\nMomo raspberry hibiscus kombucha\n\nAvailable from Momo (£26.50, 6 x 330ml bottles), Amazon (£45, 12 x 330ml bottles)\n\nBest sweet kombucha\n\nWe love all four flavours from Momo, but this combination of tangy raspberry and floral hibiscus is a firm favourite. It's delightfully fruity, with only a touch of sweetness and none of that funky flavour you might expect from kombucha. Momo goes above and beyond to make the best raw, unfiltered kombucha, and we think you can taste that. Not to mention, the bottles look lovely in your fridge.\n\nAvailable from:\n\nMomo £26.50 (six 330ml bottles)\n\nAmazon (£45, 12 x 330ml bottles)\n\nNo. 1 Living Ginger kombucha\n\nAvailable from Sainsbury's (£5.25, 4 x 250ml), Amazon (£19.99, 12 x 250ml)\n\nBest spiced kombucha\n\nYou get a real stem ginger aroma with a heady base of turmeric on opening this kombucha. It has a great balance of flavours – a subtle sweetness, a tang of acidity and a gentle heat from the ginger with a peppery finish. Pale yellow and translucent, its robust fizz really adds to the warming effect with each sip. A flavour-packed treat.\n\nAvailable from:\n\nSainsbury's (£5.25, 4 x 250ml)\n\nAmazon (£19.99, 12 x 250ml)\n\nRemedy\n\nAvailable from Remedy (from £18.49/12 x 250ml), Amazon (from £15.72/12 x 250ml), Holland & Barrett (£7/4 x 330ml)\n\nBest easy drinking kombucha\n\nLight and refreshing, Remedy is relatively sweet, without any of the funky taste of some kombuchas. It’s likely to be a hit with kids and, as it’s sugar- and allergen-free, with parents, too. There’s a good range of flavours to appeal to kombucha newbies, including ginger lemon, raspberry lemonade, wild berry, orange squeeze, mango passion, cherry plum and peach.\n\nAvailable from:\n\nRemedy (from £18.49/12 x 250ml)\n\nAmazon (from £15.72/12 x 250ml)\n\nHolland & Barrett (£7/4 x 330ml)\n\nHOLOS Citra Hops kombucha\n\nAvailable from Amazon (£33.99, 12 x 330ml)\n\nBest ethical kombucha\n\nWest Sussex-based HOLOS makes fantastic-tasting kombucha while doing good – in partnership with two UK charities, it employs survivors of slavery, providing training and job opportunities. We enjoyed all its flavours but found the zesty, tropical notes of the Citra Hops blend particularly bright and refreshing. A worthy recipient of three stars from the Great Taste Awards, this kombucha is an excellent substitute for beer and has a satisfyingly crisp, dry finish. HOLOS is available for purchase in M&S stores nationwide.\n\nAvailable from:\n\nAmazon (£33.99, 12 x 330ml)\n\nJARR passion fruit kombucha\n\nAvailable from Dry Drinker (£24.52/8 x 330ml), Amazon (£39.99/12 x 330ml)\n\nBest passion fruit kombucha\n\nThis super-funky kombucha boasts a tangy passion fruit scent which balances well with the green and oolong blends of tea. We thought it was reminiscent of a fine scrumpy cider – great bubbles and ideal to refresh and revitalise you on a hot summer's day.\n\nAvailable from:\n\nDry Drinker (£24.52/8 x 330ml)\n\nAmazon (£39.99/12 x 330ml)\n\nEquinox Pink Grapefruit & Guava kombucha\n\nAvailable from Waitrose (£2.20, 275ml), Abel & Cole (£2.20, 275ml), Amazon (£6.08, 275ml)\n\nBest pink grapefruit kombucha\n\nBold, bright and confident, this Equinox kombucha is one for fans of strong, citrussy flavours. Brilliant pink in colour, it packs a really punchy grapefruit scent. On tasting, an enjoyable sharp and sour tang awaits beneath the fruity top notes. Vividly tropical and truly moreish.\n\nAvailable from:\n\nWaitrose (£2.20, 275ml)\n\nAbel & Cole (£2.20, 275ml)\n\nAmazon (£6.08, 275ml)\n\nLeft Field Sencha Green kombucha\n\nAvailable from Left Field (£34.80, 12 x 330ml)\n\nLeft Field pride themselves on their unfiltered, raw kombucha, unadulterated with juices or flavourings, and it's easy to understand why – this green-tea-based brew is really something special. In the glass, it's pale, effervescent and almost champagne-like in appearance. The light aroma is delicate on the nose, with hints of apple and honey. To drink, it's clean and crisp with just the right amount of fizz. Full marks for this one and well worthy of a toast.\n\nAvailable from:\n\nLeft Field (£34.80, 12 x 330ml)\n\nL.A Brewery tropical ginger kombucha\n\nAvailable from L.A. Brewery (£35, 12 x 330ml), Amazon (£35, 12 x 330ml)\n\nBest tropical kombucha\n\nGet a taste of the tropics all year round with this wonderfully zingy tropical ginger kombucha from L.A Brewery. Infused with an aromatic blend of ginger, hops and yuzu, their latest flavour creates a rich base balancing notes of tropical fruits and fresh citrus. Based in Suffolk, all of L.A brewery's drinks are inspired by founder Louise Avery's love of foraging and using local fruits, herbs and botanicals. Other flavours we love from this brand include their fresh lemongrass kombucha and the unusual combination of strawberry and black pepper which leaves a satisfying kick on the palate.\n\nAvailable from:\n\nL.A. Brewery (£35, 12 x 330ml)\n\nAmazon (£35, 12 x 330ml)\n\nReal Kombucha Dry Dragon\n\nAvailable from Waitrose (£9.50, 750ml), DryDrinker (£9.48, 750ml)\n\nDeliberately targeting the discerning drinker, Real Kombucha now find themselves on the drinks menus of some of the best bars and restaurants in the UK, including The Fat Duck, L'Enclume, The Hand and Flowers and Le Manoir. Their Dry Dragon kombucha is particularly delicious – delicate, bright and sparkling, with a dry finish. Walking the tightrope between acidity and sweetness with ease, it's a well-balanced flavour profile with lovely lemony notes. A great alternative to sparkling wine with a meal.\n\nAvailable from:\n\nWaitrose (£9.50, 750ml)\n\nDryDrinker (£9.48, 750ml)\n\nReal Kombucha Royal Flush\n\nAvailable from Waitrose (£9.50, 750ml), Dry Drinker (£9.48, 750ml)\n\nThis variety is brewed using first flush Darjeeling, which is hand-picked early in the spring for a delicate flavour – and it really shines in this kombucha. Pale yellow and lightly sparkling, it has a soft, peachy scent with a tangy undertone. It's more sour than some – but not in a bad way – with a crisp, dry finish that's altogether extremely enjoyable.\n\nAvailable from:\n\nWaitrose (£9.50, 750ml)\n\nDry Drinker (£9.48, 750ml)\n\nBlighty Booch Kombucha Organic Ginger\n\nAvailable from Blighty Booch (£38, 12 x 330ml), Amazon (£38, 12 x 330ml)\n\nBest ginger kombucha\n\nThis North Wales-based brewery ferments premium quality organic whole leaf and bud tea from China in small batches to produce with a light and fruity beverage with a delicate effervescence. We love the ginger flavour especially, whose well balanced sweetness and warming, punchy flavour has earned it a coveted three stars from the Great Taste Awards.\n\nAvailable from:\n\nBlighty Booch (£38, 12 x 330ml)\n\nAmazon (£38, 12 x 330ml)\n\nL.A Brewery Sparkling English Blush\n\nAvailable from L.A Brewery (£12), Ocado (£10, 750ml), Amazon (£14.95, 750ml)\n\nBest rosé alternative\n\nA fragrant kombucha inspired by summer Rosé wines, L.A Brewery's latest flavour balances floral hops with tangy rhubarb, elderflower and seasonal fruits such as strawberry and peach. Initially dry on the palate, this refreshing kombucha releases layers of soft fruitiness, ending with a touch of acidity from the rhubarb. Ideal for sipping on lazy summer afternoons or cracking open for a special occasion.\n\nAvailable from:\n\nL.A Brewery (£12)\n\nOcado (£10, 750ml)\n\nAmazon (£14.95, 750ml)\n\nYou + I Kombucha Original\n\nAvailable from You + I, (£35, 12 x 330ml)\n\nBest smooth kombucha\n\nBrewed in Glasgow, You + I Kombucha is currently available in four flavours – but the original was our pick of the bunch, brewed with Assam tea in oak barrels. In the glass, it's a bright, golden colour, with a very unusual scent reminiscent of demerara sugar. Fine, delicate bubbles give a gentle burst in each sip, and stay stuck to the glass as it's swirled – if it were a wine, you'd say it 'has legs'. On the palate, it's oaky and full-bodied, with an almost alcoholic kick that makes you think of dark rum. There's very little acidic aftertaste, so if you prefer your kombucha with less 'tang', this might be a winner for you.\n\nAvailable from:\n\nYou + I, (£35, 12 x 330ml)\n\nL.A Brewery Sparkling English Rose kombucha\n\nAvailable from L.A Brewery (£12), Ocado (£10, 750ml)\n\nBest champagne alternative\n\nIf you are celebrating a special occasion, this champagne-inspired kombucha makes the perfect swap for a fine bottle of bubbly. Tangy assam and white monkey green tea provide a delicate base for floral infusions of organic white rose petals and wild elderflower. We enjoyed the gentle effervescence of this drink along with the fine balance of fresh citrus flavours and wildflowers on the nose, culminating in a crisp, dry finish\n\nAvailable from:\n\nL.A Brewery (£12)\n\nOcado (£10, 750ml)\n\nHow we tested kombucha\n\nAs kombucha is a live product that continues to ferment once it's bottled, it's important to store it correctly to slow the fermentation process and to avoid changes in taste – so all the samples were chilled immediately on delivery.\n\nOn the testing day, all samples were served chilled and poured into wine glasses with nothing added – no ice, lemon or straws. Notes were taken on the packaging, appearance, smell, taste and fizz and a score given to each kombucha. We included 33 samples from a variety of price points and brands for this review.\n\nHow to make your own kombucha\n\nThe health benefits of kombucha\n\nA beginner's guide to fermented foods\n\nThe best non-alcoholic beer\n\nThe best non-alcoholic champagne and sparkling wines\n\nThe best non-alcoholic wine\n\nThe best no and low-alcohol drinks\n\nNon-alcoholic cocktail recipes\n\nAre you a fan of kombucha?
