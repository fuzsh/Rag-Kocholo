        "text": "Information for patients\n\nInformation for patients\n\nNutrition and Dietetic Department\n\nPIL.LOWRES.56025.L\n\nLow fibre diet\n\nYou have been advised to follow a low fibre diet.\n\nThis means you should:\n\nAvoid or limit foods containing a lot of fibre. For example fruit, vegetables, nuts, wholegrain cereals and bran\n\nTry to drink a variety of fluids including water, tea, coffee, milk, smooth fruit juice and squash. Aim to have 1.5 – 2 litres (6-8 mugs or glasses) each day. Unless specific fluid restriction advised by medical team.\n\nWhy is a low fibre diet necessary?\n\nCertain foods cannot be completely digested by the human body. One example is fibre which helps to bulk up your stools. This helps with regular bowel movements and keeps your bowel healthy.\n\nHowever, there are cases when it is better to reduce stool volume as much as possible in order to keep the bowel clear or help to settle symptoms.\n\nHow long will I need to follow a low fibre diet for?\n\nThis depends on the reason for which you have been asked to follow such a diet.\n\nIn some cases where inflammation in the bowel is suspected then a few weeks on a low fibre diet may be necessary.\n\nThe need for a low fibre diet is usually temporary but in some cases it may be required for longer. Your dietitian/doctor/nurse will advise if this is needed on a more long-term basis and whether a multivitamin may be required.\n\nHelpful Hints\n\nCanned/stewed fruits can be blended further and passed through a sieve to remove seeds/pulp\n\nSoups can be blended and passed through sieve also\n\nA multi-vitamin may be required, this should be discussed with the IBD Nurse, Consultant or Dietitian.\n\nIt is important that you include a small glass of smooth fruit juice without pulp (e.g. orange juice) to ensure you have a source of Vitamin C in your diet.\n\nAlthough meat, dairy, fats and oils do not contain fibre, these foods can be difficult to digest. Avoid tough and fatty cuts of meat and very fatty/fried foods.\n\nIf dairy foods are poorly tolerated, eat/drink in small amounts and spread intake of dairy foods throughout the day.\n\nRemember:\n\nTake time to eat meals\n\nEat regularly throughout the day\n\nDrink plenty of fluids throughout the day\n\nEat ‘Little and Often’ – eat smaller amounts more often during the day\n\nThe following table will help you choose lower fibre foods.\n\nIn your daily diet, try to include a variety of foods from the food groups listed.\n\nSuggested meal plan\n\nBreakfast\n\nA bowl of cornflakes or rice krispies with semi-skimmed milk\n\nWhite bread or white rolls (you can toast them if you like) with eggs\n\nA glass of smooth fruit juice\n\nSmooth yoghurt (with no fruit pieces)\n\nMid-morning\n\nHot beverage\n\nPlain biscuit or plain scone (made from white flour)\n\nLunch\n\nClear soup\n\nWhite toast/bread/crackers or jacket potato (no skin) with toppings e.g tuna mayo, cheese, eggs, chicken etc.\n\nRice pudding or jelly\n\nMid-afternoon\n\nHot beverage\n\nPlain shortcake or a slice of Madeira cake, cheese and plain crackers\n\nDinner\n\nA portion of tender lean meat, or fish, or chicken with skin removed, with gravy\n\nA portion of white pasta, or white rice, or boiled potatoes without skins\n\nSmall portion of well boiled veg e.g cauliflower /swede/carrots/deskinned and de-seeded tomatoes\n\nA small pot of plain low fat natural yoghurt or smooth Formage Frais\n\nTinned /stewed fruit without seeds, skin, pith\n\nSupper\n\nA cup of Oxo or Bovril or Drinking Chocolate\n\nA slice of white bread with spread\n\nNote: The above menu is provided to illustrate how low fibre foods can be used. It is not intended as and should not be relied upon as the only menu choice.\n\nPrint this leaflet"
