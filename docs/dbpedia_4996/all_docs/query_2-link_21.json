        "text": "Launched in 1901 in Scotland, IRN-BRU is a carbonated soft drink made to an original secret recipe, which contains 32 flavours.\n\nIn 1901, steel workers working on the re-building of Glasgow Central Station were drinking too much beer to quench their thirst. So, a local soft drinks manufacturer named AG Barr brought to them a tonic-like drink that could get the workers through a hard day's graft. ‘Iron Brew’ was born and a long history of it getting Scots through tough situations began."
