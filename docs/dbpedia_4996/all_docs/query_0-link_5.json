Love Music.\n\nairdate = March 26 2007\n\nfrequency = 105.2 MHz\n\nshare = 6.0%\n\nshare as of = September 2007\n\nshare source = [http://www.rajar.co.uk/listening/quarterly_listening.php]\n\nformat = Oldies\n\nowner = Guardian Media Group\n\n105.2 Smooth Radio is a Scottish based Independent Local Radio station broadcasting to Glasgow, and replaced Saga 105.2 FM at 6am on Monday 26 March 2007, launching with John McCauley at Breakfast. The station competes with BBC Radio 2, aiming its music at listeners aged 45 and over, and is part of the national Smooth Radio network, which encompasses London, the East Midlands, the West Midlands and the North West of England.\n\nAs well as being carried on FM in the Glasgow area, the station is also broadcast on DAB digital radio to the East of Scotland and online via a streaming service.\n\nOrigins\n\nThe station came into being following GMG Radio's purchase of the Saga Radio Group in December 2006, and the granting of permission from the regulator Ofcom to change the format of its Smooth FM stations in London and the North West. The decision was made to change both the Smooth FM and Saga stations to Smooth Radio and Saga 105.2 FM was closed at 6pm on Friday 23 March 2007. This was then followed by a preview weekend for the new Smooth Radio giving listeners the opportunity to hear the presenters and music which would be featured on the new station.\n\nStation Format\n\n105.2 Smooth Radio plays adult contemporary music, aimed at listeners aged 45 and over. It bears very few similarities to its predecessor. Though some of the presenters who worked on Saga 105.2 FM now host shows on 105.2 Smooth Radio, very few of the specialist shows from the Saga days have survived, and Smooth's initial slogan \"Your life, Your music.\", which was used on Saga stations, has now been modified to \"Love Life, Love Music\"\n\nPresenters\n\n*John McCauley and Sharon Oakley - \"Smooth Breakfast\"\n\n*Mark Goodier - \"Smooth Mid-Mornings\"\n\n*Dave Marshall - \"Smooth Afternoons\"\n\n*Dougie Jackson - \"Smooth Drivetime\" and \"Smooth Saturday Afternoon\"\n\n*Steve Wells - \"Smooth Evenings\"\n\n*Steve Phillips - \"Smooth Nights (Tuesday-Wednesday)\"\n\n*Glen Morris - \"Smooth Nights\" (Thursday-Monday)\"\n\n*Tony Blackburn - \"Smooth Weekend Breakfast\"\n\n*John Darroch - \"Smooth Saturday and Sunday Morning\"\n\n*Andy Peebles - \"Andy Peebles' Soul Train\"\n\n*Fiona Phillips - \"Smooth Sunday Afternoon\"\n\n*Bill Black - \"Classic Country\"\n\n*Alex Dickson - \"Smooth Bookcase\"\n\n*Gerry Burke\n\nJohn McCauley at Breakfast\n\nThe breakfast show on 105.2 Smooth Radio is broadcast weekdays from six o' clock until ten o' clock and is hosted by John McCauley with Sharon Oakley, both formerly of Radio Clyde.\n\nIt features music, talk and phone calls from listeners. The Smooth Effect is played at ten minutes past eight every morning with the actual sound effect being played twenty minutes earlier at ten to eight. Cash prizes can be won on this competition.\n\nOther\n\n* Mark Goodier's Mid Morning Show, Tony Blackburn's Weekend Breakfast Show, Andy Peebles' Soul Train and Fiona Phillips' Sunday Afternoon show are simulcast from London and can be heard on several other stations in the Smooth Network. Evening and overnight shows are also simulcast with some other Smooth stations. All other output is produced locally.\n\nExternal links"
