        "text": "On June 18, 2024, Thailand's Senate approved a landmark marriage equality bill, making Thailand the first ASEAN country to legalise same-sex marriage. This progressive move marks a significant advancement in LGBTQ+ rights in the region. Despite Thailand's leadership, Southeast Asia remains largely hostile towards SOGI minorities, with many countries enforcing laws that criminalise non-hetero-cis identities. The article highlights the historical and political context influence of these laws that shows the role that colonial legacies and contemporary Western influences have in the life of queer people in the region. It also underscores the urgent need for broader regional reforms and the potential for Thailand to inspire similar advancements in neighbouring countries.\n\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine has significantly impacted its influence in the Central Asian Republics (CARs), altering the geopolitical landscape and shifting perceptions among the region’s five key states: Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. Historically, Russia has been the dominant external player in the region, but the ongoing conflict has led to a reassessment of this relationship. In contrast, this situation has created opportunities for other powers, particularly China. Through its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), China has exemplified soft power by positioning itself as a generous donor and investor. This not only enhances regional connectivity but also strengthens China's influence by promoting infrastructure development and economic integration in the CARs. The growing alignment between Russia and China in the territory is perceived as a threat, contributing to a complex security environment in Central Asia. This situation raises concerns over sovereignty, potential instability from Afghanistan, and increased military dependence.The Russian invasion of Ukraine has significantly impacted its influence in the Central Asian Republics (CARs), altering the geopolitical landscape and shifting perceptions among the region’s five key states: Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan.

The current engagement of the Israeli Defense Forces in the Gaza Strip has introduced measures that define a distinct approach along legal, methodological and tactical considerations. Further, the combination of new technology, new ideas and the same old battlefields and problems justifies further research into this matter. This article aims to offer a brief overview of the realities of urban warfare in the 21st century, highlighting key insights that the current conflict in Gaza may be revealing.\n\nPassenger Information Units (PIUs) are specialised entities within aviation security that collect and analyse passenger data, primarily to identify potential threats such as serious crime and terrorist plots. They utilise the Passenger Name Record (PNR), a vital six-digit code on each ticket, to track and scrutinise passenger information. Operating quietly and invisibly, akin to clouds hovering in the sky, PIUs gather data from various sources, detecting patterns and anomalies that could indicate security risks. This article aims to shed light on their discreet yet vital surveillance, which plays a crucial role in safeguarding air travel, providing an essential but often unnoticed layer of security.\n\nIn recent years, the Kremlin has intensified its campaign against Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity (SOGI) minorities, identifying them as Western propaganda. However, this rhetoric has an old origin that started with the criminalisation of “sodomy” done by Iosif Stalin. Recently, tactics of attacking the LGBTQ+ community have evolved into designating it as Western propaganda. This has led to an increasing criminalisation of the community, which has become a systematic technique that involves all the elites and powers of the Russian state from Putin to Kirill and running through the judicial system. Moreover, this propaganda has spread outside the country's borders, with anti-LGBTQ+ disinformation being spread in the former Soviet space and globally, reproducing similar anti-Western rhetoric. In this environment, the condition of SOGI minorities in Russia is worrying, and the situation will likely become worse in the future.\n\nEritrea has been one of the world’s largest producers of refugees since the country’s struggle for independence in the early 1960s. While the nation’s wars have contributed to this exodus, the root cause lies within the authoritarian government under the leadership of Isaias Afwerki, and the technically mandatory indefinite national service for all citizens.\n\nIf fortunate enough to survive or avoid getting injured by shots from the security forces at the border, migrants undergo perilous journeys to escape repression and forced labour. Obligated to follow irregular routes because of the government’s impediments, they risk being victims of human trafficking by criminal networks. Even after fleeing, evaders of the national service face ongoing fears of the consequences their families left behind will have to suffer."
