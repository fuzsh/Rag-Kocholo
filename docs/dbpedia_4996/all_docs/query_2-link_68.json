        "text": "1. What is wellness tourism?\n\nIt's often described as travel that allows people to improve their physical or mental wellbeing.\n\nWhat makes the concept interesting is that it has different connotations for different people.\n\nFor some it will be a direct definition and maybe the sole purpose of trip (encompassing yoga retreats, spa breaks). Others may take part in outdoor or creative activities to improve their wellbeing as part of a trip or just seek out moments of uplift or peace during their breaks.\n\nWellness as a holiday\n\nMore and more, we see health and wellness becoming an integral part of all travel. Visitors seek to get away from stressful lives to re-connect with nature and with family and friends. Some even take opportunities to disconnect from the digital world.\n\nWellness tourism can be seen as the primary or secondary element of a trip. This offers the potential to be relevant to a breadth of people, of all ages and life stages as wellbeing can be important to all.\n\nAdvice for tourism businesses\n\nResearch tells us that key drivers for taking holiday or short break include connecting with nature and getting away from it all. We see that escapism and de-stressing are seen as one of the key benefits of taking a holiday in Scotland.\n\nConsider wellness as a holistic and central part of the tourism offering, rather than just a \"wellness add on\".\n\n3. VisitBritain MIDAS research 2022\n\nIn 2022, our partner, VisitBritain, undertook comprehensive research with international leisure travellers. They spoke to global and prospective tourists from many markets around the world.\n\nThe research looked at international tourist motivations and decision making. It also explored the relevance of wellbeing as it applies to holidays and short breaks.\n\nKey insights\n\nIndividuals are acutely aware of the connection between breaks and holidays, and their own personal wellbeing.\n\nWellbeing is of emerging importance amongst visitors from around the world.\n\n77% net agree \"taking breaks or holidays abroad is good for my physical, mental and emotional wellbeing\".\n\n68% net agree that \"since the pandemic began, I have become more appreciative of the importance of breaks and holidays for my personal wellbeing\".\n\nTourists from Oceania, Americas, South Asia, and the Middle East are the most likely to associate breaks and holidays with personal wellbeing. Although, there is also still a strong wellbeing opportunity from Southern and Western Europe.\n\nRead the full VisitBritain Midas research"
