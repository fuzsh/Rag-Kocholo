        "text": "If you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, The Hollywood Reporter may receive an affiliate commission.\n\nFresh off winning Grammy and Oscar awards for her Barbie track, Billie Eilish is dropping a new album and hitting the road.\n\nHit Me Hard and Soft dropped on May 17, and the singer will embark on an international tour in October to support the new album. Eilish announced more than 70 dates in North America and Europe for the Hit Me Hard and Soft Tour, and the general sale began on May 3 at Ticketmaster.\n\nEilish is also taking steps to ensure that her fans can buy tickets fairly. According to Ticketmaster, all tickets are only available in mobile format and will be “restricted from transfer.”\n\n“The artist wants to give fans, not scalpers, the best chance to buy tickets at face value,” notes Ticketmaster Eilish’s concert ticket pages. “To help achieve this, the tour will be using Ticketmaster’s Face Value Exchange where, if needed, you can resell your ticket to other fans at the original price paid.”\n\nBelow, keep reading for more on where to find sold-out tickets to Billie Eilish’s Hit Me Hard and Soft tour.\n\nBillie Eilish’s Hit Me Hard and Soft Tour: Where to Buy Sold-Out Tickets, Best Promo Codes\n\nRegular and Face Value Exchange tickets for select dates of Billie Eilish’s Hit Me Hard and Soft Tour are available at Ticketmaster.\n\nFans can find sold-out Billie Eilish tickets at third-party resale platforms including Gametime, SeatGeek, StubHub, Ticket Liquidator, Ticket Network and VividSeats. Pricing ranges from $88 for tickets in Denver to $416 and up for floor seats in Los Angeles.\n\nThose looking for the best promo codes for Billie Eilish tickets can get discounts at SeatGeek (use THR‘s exclusive code HOLLYWOOD10 for $10 off eligible purchases of $250 and up), VividSeats (use code THR2024 for $20 off), Ticket Liquidator (use code TLSummer15 for 15 percent off) and Ticket Network (THR150 for $150 off orders of $500 and up or THR300 for $300 off purchases of $1,000 or more).\n\nHit Me Hard and Soft: The Tour U.S. and International Dates\n\nBillie Eilish’s Hit Me Hard and Soft international tour kicks off in Canada before making its way through the East Coast to Baltimore, Philadelphia, Detroit, Boston, Pittsburgh, New York and more. Midwest dates include Chicago, Omaha, Cincinnati, Kansas City and others, while one of the few Southern stops (so far) is Atlanta. For now, there are no stops in Texas or Florida, and fans are speculating that the singer is avoiding those states due to their anti-abortion laws. The singer then heads to Australia in February 2025, followed by shows across Europe through July 2025, including in Paris, London, Berlin, Prague, Dublin, Bologna and others.\n\nBelow, keep reading for the full list of cities and dates for Billie Eilish’s 2024/2025 Hit Me Hard and Soft world tour, and buy tickets at Ticketmaster.com.\n\nSeptember/October 2024 Billie Eilish Hit Me Hard and Soft World Tour Dates\n\nNovember 2024 Billie Eilish Hit Me Hard and Soft World Tour Dates\n\nDecember 2024 Billie Eilish Hit Me Hard and Soft World Tour Dates\n\nFebruary 2025 Billie Eilish Hit Me Hard and Soft World Tour Dates\n\nMarch 2025 Billie Eilish Hit Me Hard and Soft World Tour Dates\n\nApril 2025 Billie Eilish Hit Me Hard and Soft World Tour Dates\n\nMay 2025 Billie Eilish Hit Me Hard and Soft World Tour Dates\n\nJune 2025 Billie Eilish Hit Me Hard and Soft World Tour Dates"
