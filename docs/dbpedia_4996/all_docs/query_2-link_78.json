Its website has more information including a map of all the locations (currently 28). Some of the libraries listed above are in this network.\n\nLend and Mend hubs in Scottish public libraries\n\nIn 2023 nine public libraries in Aberdeen, Angus, Edinburgh, Inverclyde, Midlothian, Orkney, Perth, North and South Ayrshire established Lend and Mend Hubs to help their communities to repair, reuse, rent and upcycle everyday items. The library services will offer free access for everyone to keep items in use for longer, rather than them being thrown away.\n\nEach library hub is also introducing an education programme to support new skills development, helping to reduce inequality through equitable access to resources.\n\nThe project is funded by The John Lewis Partnership’s £1 million Circular Future Fund and is being managed by the Scottish Library and Information Council (SLIC) where you can find a list of the new Lend and Mend hubs.\n\nWales\n\nBarry Benthyg\n\nWebsite: barry.benthyg.cymru\n\nWhat do they lend?: Camping, DIY, Entertainment, Events, Garden, Hobbies, Homeware, Kitchen, Sports, Tools, Travel,\n\nAddress: Eto, 83 Holton Rd, Barry, CF63 4HG\n\nEmail: barry@benthyg-cymru.org\n\nBenthyg Abergavenny\n\nWebsite: monmouthshire.benthyg.cymru/sites\n\nWhat do they lend?:\n\nAddress: Abergavenny Community Centre, Old Park Street School, Merthyr Road, Abergavenny, NP7 5BY\n\nEmail: benthygabergavenny@gmail.com\n\nBenthyg ACE (Two locations and mobile)\n\nWebsite: ace.benthyg.cymru\n\nWhat do they lend?: Camping, Car, DIY, Garden, Homeware, IT, Kitchen, Maternity, Sports, Tools, Travel\n\nAddress: Dusty Forge, 460 Cowbridge Rd West, Ely, Cardiff, CF5 5BZ; and College Road, Llandaff North, Cardiff, CF14 2HU\n\nEmail: acebenthyg@aceplace.org\n\nBenthyg Chepstow\n\nWebsite: monmouthshire.benthyg.cymru\n\nWhat do they lend?: Camping, DIY, Entertainment, Garden, Hobbies, IT, Kitchen, Toys, Travel\n\nAddress: Monmouthshire Upcycle, Station Yard Industrial Estate, Chepstow, NP16 5PF,\n\nEmail: benthygabergavenny@gmail.com\n\n*Benthyg Cymru\n\nWebsite: www.benthyg-cymru.org (includes map directory with locations or all linked schemes)\n\nEmail: info@benthyg-cymru.org\n\n*Benthyg Cymru is the national body in Wales for lending schemes.
