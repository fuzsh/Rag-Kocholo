        "text": "1830\n\n1830\n\nCORK CUTTING\n\nRobert Barr, the fourth son of a farming family from Beith in Ayrshire, started a cork cutting business in Falkirk in 1830. In 1875 Robert’s son, also called Robert, added a soft drinks business, which quickly grew to become the only activity.\n\n1875\n\n1875 – 1900\n\nTHE EARLY YEARS\n\nRobert Barr set the family cork cutting business on an exciting new course when in 1875 he started producing and selling aerated waters, as soft drinks were then called. Within a generation his sons Robert F. Barr and Andrew G. Barr in Falkirk had established a second, independently run, Barr aerated waters business in Glasgow. Andrew developed a successful range of soft drinks which led to the expansion of his Glasgow business and the creation of a purpose built factory complex in the east end of the city. Both Barr Falkirk and Barr Glasgow were among hundreds of soft drinks businesses operating in Scotland towards the end of the nineteenth century. At the time the growing population of the industrial towns in Scotland had problems with poor sanitation, poor quality drinking water and poor diets. Soft drinks became popular because they were not only a treat, as they are today, but they also guaranteed people a safe quality drink combined with a ‘dose’ of energy through their sugar content.\n\n1887\n\n1887\n\nR.F. BARR LABEL\n\nIn 1887 Robert Barr’s son, Robert F. Barr, left Falkirk to set up his own soft drinks business in Great Eastern Road, Glasgow (later renamed Gallowgate). His labels bore the new business name R.F. Barr's Glasgow.\n\n1887\n\n1887\n\nESSENCE BOOK\n\nMany flavours of soft drinks are derived from the essences added to the syrup. It was common at that time for manufacturers to make their own essences from fruit oils and Robert Barr developed his own unique flavours for his growing range of soft drinks.\n\n1892\n\n1892\n\nAG BARR & CO LABEL\n\nIn 1892, five years after getting his Glasgow business off the ground, Robert F. Barr decided to seek new challenges and moved to Ireland. It was left to his brother, Andrew G. Barr, to take over as sole proprietor. The name on the labels became AG Barr & Co.\n\n1899\n\nPre-1900\n\nFALKIRK PREMISES\n\nRobert Barr’s Falkirk factory (pictured) where he started the soft drinks business in 1875. The number of horse drawn lorries in the picture indicates a growing and prosperous operation. Deliveries to shops were restricted to 10 miles out and back each day – the distance a horse could travel.\n\n1900\n\n1900\n\nRECIPE BOOK\n\nThe first step in manufacturing a carbonated soft drink is to prepare a syrup containing all the ingredients of the finished product other than the carbonated water. The lists of ingredients were laid down in recipe books used by syrup room staff.\n\n1900\n\nEarly 1900s\n\nQUALITY CONTROL EQUIPMENT\n\nHydrometers were used to check the density of first the syrup and then the finished product – ensuring that the right amount of sugar was present. A pressure gauge, when attached to the top of the bottle, indicated how much carbon dioxide (CO2) was contained in the finished drink. The final check on the quality of the product was a simple taste test!\n\n1901\n\n1901\n\nIRON BREW IS LAUNCHED\n\nBoth Barr businesses, Robert Barr, Falkirk and AG Barr & Co. Glasgow, jointly launched their own original recipe ‘IRON BREW’ soft drink on Monday 15th April 1901. Adam Brown, a famous highland athlete from Shotts, featured on the label design.\n\n1901\n\n1901\n\nA DEVELOPING RANGE\n\nBarr’s IRON BREW joined an established and popular range of products including ‘Wee Macgregor Brew’, ‘Japanese Plum’ and ‘Raspberry Cider’. Many of the products were still brewed with the fermentation being cut at the point where the resultant drink was below the maximum alcohol level for sale as a non-alcoholic beverage – in those days 1.1% alcohol, these days it has been reduced to 0.5%.\n\n1903\n\n1903\n\nANDREW G. BARR DIES SUDDENLY\n\nTragically, in December 1903, Andrew died within three weeks of contracting Glanders Virus. Following his untimely death, his younger brother, 24-year-old William Snodgrass Barr, took over the management control of AG Barr & Co. Glasgow.\n\n1905\n\n1905\n\nRETURNABLE GLASS BOTTLE DEPOSITS INTRODUCED\n\nThe Glasgow and West of Scotland Association members introduced bottle deposits owing to ‘…the great loss and damage sustained by them through the non-return of bottles and syphons...they have found it necessary in the interest of the Aerated Water Trade, to institute a Bottle Deposit System delivered with their goods to customers, at One Halfpenny per bottle and Two pence per Syphon…’\n\n1905\n\n1905\n\nEARLY PRESS ADVERTISING\n\nThe company starts to advertise in local newspapers. The adverts feature testimonials from the sporting heroes of the day. Donald Dinnie, All-round Champion Athlete of the World and Alex Munro, Champion Caber Tosser of the World and Undisputed Champion Wrestler of Great Britain, are two athletes featured.\n\n1918\n\n1918\n\nSTANLEY STEAMER\n\nThis was the first mechanised vehicle owned by the company. It was powered by steam and needed many bags of fuel to keep the boiler well stoked.\n\n1922\n\n1922\n\nIRON BREW LABEL CHANGE\n\nA Cambridge rower replaced Adam Brown on the IRON BREW labels. In the original picture his right hand had held an upright oar, but this was substituted by a glass of IRON BREW\n\n1924\n\n1924\n\nTIZER LAUNCHED\n\nFred Pickup launched Tizer, coined from the word ‘Appetizer’. Barr acquired Tizer Ltd in 1972.\n\n1938\n\n1938\n\nSIGNED TESTIMONIAL BY BENNY LYNCH\n\nAfter the company started selling IRON BREW it engaged many sporting heroes of the day to endorse the brand. Benny Lynch, a Glaswegian, became World Flyweight Champion in 1935 and is widely regarded as one of the finest boxers that Britain has ever produced.\n\n1942\n\n1942-1947\n\nIRON BREW REMOVED FROM SALE DURING SECOND WORLD WAR\n\nThe Second World War quickly resulted in shortages of raw materials. The Government had little choice but to ‘concentrate’ the soft drinks industry across the UK. It shut down many manufacturers, and those that remained were given a production number – AG Barr’s was No.6. Each was only allowed to produce six ‘standard drink’ recipes like lemonade. IRON BREW was not a designated ‘standard drink’ and so the brand went off sale for the remainder of the war and beyond.\n\n1947\n\n1947\n\nIRN-BRU WAS BORN\n\nIn 1946 the industry was making preparations for the end of Government control. Concern mounted that the name IRON BREW would no longer be permitted as a result of proposed new food labelling regulations. The proposed regulations stipulated that brand names should be ‘literally true’. Barr’s IRON BREW did contain iron but it was not brewed. As it turned out the regulations were modified when they finally went through in 1964, but the company had gone ahead with their plans to change the name and launched the phonetic respelling of the brand as IRN-BRU. The new IRN-BRU trademark was first registered on Thursday 18th July 1946, although we believe that the new IRN-BRU brand name wouldn’t have appeared in the market until 1947 when the ‘concentration’ of the soft drinks industry during the war ended.\n\n1953\n\n1901-1953\n\nA BRAND IS BORN\n\nIn this period Barr wrote themselves into Scottish history with the launch in 1901 of their original recipe IRON BREW. Through the success of the brand AG Barr quickly became the No.1 soft drinks business in Scotland. Barr was a pioneer in these early days of marketing, promoting Barr’s IRON BREW as a brand and building the reputation of the unique beverage with testimonials from famous athletes of the day. After the Second World War, in anticipation of changing food labelling regulations, Barr re-launched IRON BREW as IRN-BRU onto the UK national stage and beyond.\n\n1954\n\n1954\n\nBARR ‘INVADE’ ENGLAND\n\nBarr set out to ‘conquer’ England with the acquisition of John Hollows, Bradford.\n\n1954\n\n1954\n\nEARLY ENGLAND IRN-BRU SIGN\n\nA unique find, this IRN-BRU metal sign can be dated by the bottle and label design depicted. We know that the bottle dates from 1947, which was when Barr’s IRON BREW changed its name to the phonetic spelling IRN-BRU. The bottle type is an internal screw cap. These were replaced around 1952 with the first generation of the closures we have today, so we can date this sign from between 1947-mid-1950s. It’s likely this sign was produced to help market IRN-BRU in England when the drink was introduced in England. A similar sign in Scotland from that time would have featured advertising cartoon characters Ba-Bru & Sandy (which would have been unknown south of the border). Photograph reproduced by kind permission Mr A. Dolan.\n\n1969\n\n1969\n\nIRN-BRU ENGLAND LABEL\n\nIRN-BRU introduce a ‘Tartan’ inspired label design in England only.\n\n1972\n\n1972\n\nTIZER LTD IS ACQUIRED BY BARR FOR £2.5m\n\nBarr achieved national distribution throughout Scotland, England and Wales as a result of the purchase of Tizer, which was started by the Pickup family in Bristol in 1907 and became a public company in 1936.\n\n1973\n\n1973\n\nBARR RELAUNCH TIZER\n\nBarr relaunched Tizer after then Chairman Robert Barr insisted that the company’s chemists reproduce a formula as near to the original 1924 Tizer as possible\n\n1974\n\n1974\n\nIRN-BRU 330ML CAN DESIGN\n\nThe purchase of Stotherts Ltd. Atherton in 1967 brought soft drinks cans into the Barr portfolio for the first time. In 1974 a new IRN-BRU design was introduced across the range of packs including 330ml cans. This design was replaced in 1988.\n\n1975\n\n1975\n\nBILLY CONNOLLY RECORD\n\nIRN-BRU is known for its apparently magical restorative powers as a hangover cure. Billy Connolly wrote and released an ode dedicated to Mr and Mrs Barr “for saving my life on so many Sunday mornings” in his 1975 album 'Cop Yer Whack For This'.\n\n1976\n\n1976\n\nNON-RETURNABLE 1 LITRE PLASTISHIELD BOTTLE\n\nPlastishield covered glass bottles enabled the supermarkets to sell large bottles of soft drinks for the first time. The covering made it safe to sell glass although the maximum pack size was only 1 litre.\n\n1978\n\n1978\n\nROBERT BARR RECEIVES O.B.E\n\nThe picture shows Robert Barr with his wife Dorothy and son Robin at Buckingham Palace where he received an O.B.E. (Order of the British Empire) for services to the soft drinks industry.\n\n1979\n\n1979\n\nTHE FIRST PLASTIC BOTTLES GO ON SALE IN SUPERMARKETS\n\nIn the late 1970s PET (Polyethylene Terephthalate) packaging was introduced and quickly replaced Plastishield glass bottles since 2 litre, or even 3 litre, bottles could be manufactured and distributed with no safety issues.\n\n1980\n\n1980\n\nALAN WELLS VISITS BARR TWICE IN A DAY\n\nOlympic 100m Gold medalist Alan Wells officially opened two new Barr Warehouses on the same day – one in Glasgow and one in Atherton, near Bolton, England.\n\n1980\n\n1830-1980\n\n150-YEAR CELEBRATION\n\nA special brochure was produced to mark the Barr family’s 150 years in business.\n\n1984\n\nMid-1980s\n\nHOME BRU KIT\n\nOne of IRN-BRU’s ‘Made in Scotland from Girders’ posters.\n\n1985\n\n1985\n\nIRN-BRU LOW CALORIE 330ML CAN\n\nIn 1979 a new low-calorie IRN-BRU variant had been launched in glass and plastic bottles. Low-calorie IRN-BRU became available in 330ml cans from 1985.\n\n1988\n\n1988\n\nMANDORA ST. CLEMENTS LTD. ACQUISITION\n\nBarr purchased Mandora St. Clements Ltd. for £21.5million, diversifying into high juice-based drinks. In addition the acquisition brought the KA brand into the product range.\n\n1989\n\n1954-1989\n\nA NATIONAL DRINK\n\n1959 heralded a key period of acquisition and consolidation after Barr became one company with the purchase by AG Barr & Co. Ltd. of Robert Barr Ltd. Falkirk. The company stepped up its expansion into England and became a public company in 1965. From the 1960s onwards a series of innovative advertising campaigns resulted in a period of rapid sales growth across the range of Barr brands. One of the most memorable: ‘Your other national drink – made in Scotland from girders’ confirmed IRN-BRU’s popular status as a national brand. This iconic TV and poster advertising campaign (which ran from the mid-1970s to the early 1990s) is still recalled with fondness by the Scottish public. In 2007 the ‘Made in Scotland from Girders’ campaign was awarded ‘Best Advertising Strapline Of The Last 21 Years’ at the Scottish Advertising Awards.\n\n1993\n\n1993\n\nNEW AG BARR LOGO DESIGN\n\nA new corporate logo, designed by Coley Porter Bell, was introduced in 1993 with the launch event taking place in the yard of our Gallowgate site at Great Eastern Road, Glasgow.\n\n1993\n\n1993\n\nBARR’S D’N’B\n\nBarr’s dandelion and burdock flavour, previously part of the Barr flavour range, was relaunched as D’N’B in 1993 and became the first branded dandelion and burdock product on the market. In 2008 D’N’B announced a new two-year sponsorship deal and became the official soft drink of the Rugby League, the Super League and the National League. In 2008 D’N’B also sponsored Team England in the year of the Rugby World Cup in Australia.\n\n1995\n\n1995\n\n10-YEAR AWARD-WINNING IRN-BRU POSTER CAMPAIGN\n\nA poster campaign was launched in Scotland in 1995 highlighting individuals’ relationships with IRN-BRU. The campaign established a unique tone of voice and an accessible irreverent sense of humour, which has come to be synonymous with the brand. The campaign won many awards over the years including the prestigious Scottish Advertising Awards 2007 ‘Best Poster of the last 21 years’ award for the ‘Bitches’ poster.\n\n1996\n\n1996\n\nCUMBERNAULD FACTORY OPENS\n\nAll Barr soft drinks production in Scotland was centralised at a new location in Cumbernauld in this year. The opening ceremony was carried out by three times Formula One World Racing Champion Sir Jackie Stewart. Then, as now, the factory produced Barr 250ml, 500ml and 2 litre plastic bottles as well as 750ml glass returnable bottles. In the later development of the site a new 330ml canning line was installed in 2007 capable of producing 690 million cans per year.\n\n1997\n\n1997\n\nIRN-BRU TARTAN\n\nOur IRN-BRU tartan received its certificate of accreditation (No.97017) on 12th September 1997 from the Council of the Scottish Tartans Society. The tartan substantially incorporates the IRN-BRU orange and IRN-BRU blue colours.\n\n1998\n\n1998\n\nRUSSIAN IRN-BRU\n\nIRN-BRU was first manufactured in Russia in 1998. IRN-BRU was marketed and distributed by partners Moscow Brewing Company (MBC) who manufactured the brand in Russia. Thanks to MBC’s extensive production and distribution network IRN-BRU was widely available in Russia. In 2022 we took the decision not to fulfill further orders to this market as a result of Russia's actions in Ukraine.\n\n2001\n\n2001\n\n100 YEARS OF IRN-BRU\n\nAs part of the IRN-BRU centenary celebrations in 2001 the company produced a book ‘Robert Barr to AG Barr PLC. 1875 to 2001\n\n2004\n\n2004\n\nIRN-BRU PHENOMENAL CAMPAIGN\n\nThis campaign was launched in Scotland and the North East with a full programme of promotional activity and media support.\n\n2005\n\n2005\n\nDIET IRN-BRU IS RELAUNCHED\n\nDiet IRN-BRU becomes a brand in its own right with new packaging and a new TV Campaign which introduces the world to Raoul ...‘Hey Ladies!’\n\n2006\n\n2006\n\nSTRATHMORE ACQUISITION\n\nThe Forfar-based Strathmore Spring water business was acquired by AG Barr for £15.5m in 2006. Strathmore Spring water is rich in beneficial minerals and is created by a 50-year filtration process through the sandstone layers of the Vale of Strathmore. The water is drawn by us for bottling from an aquifer deep underground. The most famous building in the Vale is Glamis Castle which appears on every bottle of Strathmore Spring. The Castle is famous for its Royal connections as well as being one of the locations in Shakespeare’s ‘Macbeth’.\n\n2006\n\n2006\n\nIRN-BRU 32 LAUNCHED\n\nDerek the Cuckoo, played by Scottish actor Brian McCardie was created to launch a new energy drink brand - IRN-BRU 32 - onto TV screens across Scotland in 2006. IRN-BRU 32, launched in 250ml cans, was developed to compete in the fast growing energy drinks market. The brand won the ‘Top Campaign of the Year 2006’ award from leading trade magazine ‘The Grocer’ and was also awarded J Sainsbury’s ‘Best Promotional Launch of the Year 2006’.\n\n2006\n\n2006\n\nIRN-BRU SNOWMAN ADVERT\n\nThe IRN-BRU ‘Snowman’ Ad was the first-ever Christmas TV advert produced by the brand. Inspired by Raymond Briggs classic 1982 animated film ‘The Snowman’ it gave a very funny twist to this traditional Christmas tale. ‘The Snowman’s’ famous soundtrack ‘Walking in the Air’ by Howard Blake was re-written with alternative IRN-BRU lyrics. The advert was first screened in Scotland during Christmas 2006 and has since become very popular with the Scottish public, who have viewed it over 1 million times on YouTube. In 2007 it was also screened in England.\n\n2007\n\n2007\n\nNEW’ TIZER\n\nThe Tizer brand was relaunched in 2007 with a new logo, packaging and formula based on the original 1924 recipe. The new recipe contains 10% fruit juice with no artificial flavourings, artificial sweeteners or artificial colours to appeal to more health conscious consumers.\n\n2007\n\n2007\n\nCUMBERNAULD FACILITY NEARS COMPLETION\n\nAG Barr operations in Scotland are centralised into a new £37million production, warehousing, distribution and Head Office facility located at Cumbernauld, nine miles east of Glasgow.\n\n2007\n\n2007\n\nSTRATHMORE ‘MORE SPRING’ TV ADS\n\nAG Barr’s first advertising campaign for Strathmore Spring Water was launched in 2007 as part of a £1million marketing drive in Scotland. The new advert brought a vibrant, modern focus to the brand with an exciting urban dance sequence set to an uplifting soundtrack. Amazing digital images of the water itself also made for a memorable advert. Popular with consumers the advert was also used for the brand’s 2008 TV campaign.\n\n2008\n\n2008\n\nTHE PRINCE’S TRUST\n\nBarr signs a partnership agreement with The Prince’s Trust. Barr will support the work of The Trust by investing in a number of its core community programmes across the UK, with a particular focus on Scotland.\n\n2008\n\n2008\n\nACQUISITION OF GROUPE RUBICON LTD\n\nAG Barr PLC. announced on 5th August 2008 that it had entered into a conditional agreement to purchase Groupe Rubicon Limited for a total initial cash consideration of £59.8 million. The Rubicon Group is a UK-based manufacturer and distributor of branded exotic juice drinks.\n\n2008\n\n2008\n\nSTRATHMORE IS RELAUNCHED\n\nStrathmore, the No.1* water brand in the on-trade introduced a new label design. The new label design built on Strathmore’s brand strengths of purity, contemporary Scottishness and quality, placing Glamis Castle at the core of the design because its location at the heart of the Vale of Strathmore marks the source of the water.\n\n2009\n\n2009\n\nIRN-BRU SPONSORS RUGBY LEAGUE AND SKY SPORTS SUPER LEAGUE COVERAGE\n\nIRN-BRU becomes the official soft drink sponsor of the Rugby League until 2010 and the broadcast sponsor of Sky Sports’ Super League coverage for 2009. The sponsorship with Sky Sports and the Rugby Football League raised the profile and visibility of IRN-BRU reaching over 10 million viewers through the 60 live games broadcast during the season.\n\n2009\n\n2009\n\nROBIN BARR RETIRES AS CHAIRMAN\n\nRobin Barr (71), steps down as Chairman at the Company's AGM in May 2009. Robin held the position of Chairman for 31 years and was a director of AG Barr for 44 years. Robin agrees to remain on the Board in a non-executive role. Ronnie Hanna (61) who served as a non-executive Director on the AG Barr Board for the last five years becomes non-executive Chairman in May. Jonathan Warburton (51), Chairman of Warburtons Ltd., is appointed as independent non-executive Director.\n\n2009\n\n2009\n\nIRN-BRU MUSICAL\n\nOn Tuesday 5th May the 60-second IRN-BRU Musical TV advert was premiered on STV as part of the brand’s £2million summer campaign. Set in the corridors and grounds of the fictional ‘Auchendookit Senior High’, IRN-BRU Musical shows the school’s students performing their own very Scottish musical number, ‘It's Fizzy, It’s Ginger, It’s Phenomenal’. The campaign featured a then 18-year-old Jack Lowden who has since gone on to success on the big screen - but he started with IRN-BRU!\n\n2009\n\n2009\n\nIRN-BRU WORLD RECORD BREAKER\n\nNearly 10,000 people attended the IRN-BRU Can Clan event held on Sunday 13th September 2009 in Glasgow Green as part of Scotlands ‘Homecoming’ year. Hosted by popular actor and writer Sanjeev Kohli with music from ‘The Zutons’ and ‘Pearl And The Puppets’ IRN-BRU smashed the world record for the cancan dance. An official adjudicator from Guinness World Records, Jack Brockbank, confirmed that the new record had been set after the required five minutes of cancan moves.\n\n2009\n\n2009\n\nIRN-BRU HERITAGE CAN\n\nFive million IRN-BRU heritage cans – enough for everyone in Scotland – were produced as part of ‘Homecoming’. They featured the IRN-BRU logo that was first introduced in 1947, when the spelling of Barr’s IRON BREW was changed to Barr’s IRN-BRU for the first time.
