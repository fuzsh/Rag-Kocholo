        "text": "Introduction\n\nThe Student Teacher Placement process is a national placement programme that includes a system that enables the automatic matching of student teachers to school placement offers throughout Scotland.\n\nGTC Scotland operates and maintains the Student Placement System on behalf of Higher Education Institutions (HEIs), local authorities and schools. The system is funded by HEIs and Local Government and has been contracted to GTC Scotland to manage since 2013.\n\nThe current system is now reaching the end of life. Originally intended to be replaced after six years, technical support for the current system will be withdrawn in June 2024 due to the age of the system and its ability to adapt to changing requirements. The recently published Measuring Quality in Initial Teacher Education Final Report (Kennedy, Carver & Adams, 2023), references how the current system can be a source of frustration and the way in which the system allocates placements, without being able to fully recognise and accommodate variability of programmes, being problematic.\n\nWe have been considering the suitability of us hosting the Student Placement System as we also have a statutory accreditation responsibility for Initial Teacher Education.\n\nDeveloping our new strategic plan, Trusted Teaching, has given us the opportunity to review our work and we believe that we need to focus our resources on expertly delivering our core functions of registration and regulation over the next five years. The Register of Teachers now contains almost 82,000 individuals and it is important that we focus on working with the profession to maintain high standards and enhance trust in teaching.\n\nWe have therefore shared our intent with the Student Placement Management Group to withdraw from administering the Student Placement System from June 2024 in line with the current systemâs end of life.â¯In discussion with our SPMG partners and our system supplier, we have confirmed that until the end of June 2024, we will assist in preparation for what is likely to be an interim year of arrangements in 24/25.\n\nWe will work with partners to ensure a smooth transition to the new system operators and we hope that we will be also able to use our experiences from the last ten years of operating the system to suggest improvements for the next phase of the Student Teacher Placement process."
