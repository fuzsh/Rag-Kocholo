        "text": "Why is the recycling service changing?\n\nWe're changing the way you recycle at home to bring Glasgow's recycling services in line with Scottish guidance (Code of Practice, which supports the Charter for Household Recycling) and to align with changes introduced by other councils. These changes will make it easier for you to recycle and make a big difference to the quality of recycling we collect.\n\nWhat's Changing?\n\nWe are providing kerbside properties with a new grey bin for recycling plastics, metals, cartons, soft plastics and film. As well as plastic bottles you can now also recycle other types of plastic in your new grey bin. This includes yoghurt pots, margarine tubs, food trays, soft plastics and film, such as plastic wrapping, carrier bags, and film lids.\n\nYour blue bin should now only be used to recycle paper, card and cardboard.\n\nThe Council is trialling service changes to flats within three different areas in the city, but widespread change to all flats is not anticipated until completion of the roll out to all kerbside properties.\n\nWill my collection day change?\n\nYour collection days are not changing. Please see check your collection calendar provided with your information pack. If you have not received this please email twinstreamrecycling@glasgow.gov.uk.\n\nWhen will the new service start?\n\nNorth West grey bin deliveries: Phases 1 and 2 Dark Grey Recycling Bin Delivery Dates (arcgis.com)\n\nSouth West grey bin deliveries: Phase 3 Dark Grey Recycling Bin Delivery Dates (arcgis.com)\n\nSouth East grey bin deliveries: September 2024 to November 2024 (link to follow)\n\nNorth East grey bin deliveries: November 2024 to March 2025 (link to follow)\n\nHow often will my bins be collected?\n\nYour bins will be collected as follows:\n\nGrey bin - every 4 weeks\n\nBlue bin - every 4 weeks\n\nGreen bin - every 3 weeks\n\nPurple bin - every 8 weeks\n\nBrown bin - every 2 weeks\n\nWe currently collect your green non-recyclable waste bin every 3 weeks and blue recycling bin on alternate weeks.\n\nThere will be no change to the collection frequency for green, brown or purple bin collections.\n\nYou will be provided with a calendar which shows when each of your bins will be collected.\n\nHow will you let residents know about the new service?\n\nResidents will receive a letter approximately four weeks in advance of the grey bin being delivered. Thereafter, a leaflet and collection calendar will also be provided, approximately two weeks before delivery of the grey bin, which explains how to take part in the new service.\n\nWe will be running community drop-in events before the new service is introduced to your area. Details of these will be provided in the letter and promoted on social media. At these events the range of recycling bins will be displayed, along with examples of the types of materials that can be recycled in each container. These sessions will also allow residents to have their questions answered and learn more about the new service.\n\nHow big are the new grey bins?\n\n240 litres - this is the same size as your existing blue, green and brown bins.\n\nWhat are the benefits of recycling?\n\nAs well as preserving natural resources, recycling can help to reduce carbon emissions - it takes less energy to make recycled products than using raw materials.\n\nIn addition, Glasgow is aiming to become a zero-waste city. Having declared a climate emergency in May 2019, the city is committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2030.\n\nWe can help achieve these goals by recycling more of our waste. It's therefore never been more important to recycle.\n\nDo I have to recycle?\n\nSection 46 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 requires householders to use the bins or containers provided by the council for waste and recycling collections and for the householder to place the correct waste material in the correct bins.\n\nWhere does my recycling go?\n\nPlastics, metals, cartons and soft plastics collected in your grey bin are sorted, baled and sent for reprocessing into new products.\n\nPaper, card and cardboard collected in your blue bin is baled, pulped, and turned into new paper and cardboard products.\n\nGlass collected in your purple bin is taken to processing facilities where it is crushed, colour sorted, melted, and turned into new glass bottles and jars.\n\nFood and garden waste collected in your brown bin is treated at an In Vessel Composting (IVC) facility and turned into compost.\n\nNon-recyclable waste from your green bin is sent to the Glasgow Recycling and Renewable Energy Centre where is it treated and diverted from landfill.\n\nYou can find out more about what happens to your waste and recycling here.\n\nHow are the Council funding this Service Change?\n\nWe have been awarded £21.2 million from the Scottish Government Recycling Improvement Fund (RIF) to substantially change and improve how recycling services are provided.\n\nThe RIF award has been split into two areas: £4.2 million to assist in changes to the kerbside recycling collection service, and £17 million for the development of a Materials Recycling Facility (MRF). The new MRF, due for completion in 2026, will sort the contents of the blue and grey bins prior to sending the material to re-processors to be recycled into new products. This new plant will replace the council's existing MRF, located at Blochairn.\n\nWhat if I don't have space for another bin?\n\nHouseholds should be able to accommodate an additional bin however we do realise that some households may have space constraints. This is an opportunity to participate in our new recycling service and will allow residents to support the aims of the City by recycling more, improving recycling quality and positively contributing to our environmental and carbon targets.\n\nThe new bin is for recycling plastics, metals, cartons, soft plastics and film. As well as plastic bottles you can also recycle other types of plastic in your new grey bin. This includes yoghurt pots, margarine tubs, food trays, soft plastics and film such as plastic wrapping, carrier bags, and film lids.\n\nAs we are also introducing our One Green Bin Policy. and Contamination Policy, each resident will require the new bin to enable the household to place these items in the correct bin; in addition, the new bin will be collected every 4 weeks (our blue bin service will also move to a 4 weekly collection).\n\nIf you continue to have issues storing a bin, please Email Us and a member of the team will be in contact to discuss your issues.\n\nI don't want another bin?\n\nA The Council is bringing Glasgow's recycling services in line with Scottish guidance (Code of Practice, which supports the Charter for Household Recycling).\n\nEvery kerbside property is being provided with a new grey bin for recycling plastics, metals, cartons, soft plastics and film. As well as plastic bottles you can now also recycle other types of plastic in your new grey bin. This includes yoghurt pots, margarine tubs, food trays, soft plastics and film, such as plastic wrapping, carrier bags, and film lids.\n\nAs we are also introducing our One Green Bin Policy. and Contamination Policy,', each resident will require the new bin to enable the household to place these items in the correct bin; in addition, the new bin will be collected every 4 weeks (our blue bin service will also move to a 4 weekly collection).\n\nThis is an opportunity for every resident to participate in our new recycling service and will allow residents to support the aims of the City by recycling more, improving recycling quality and positively contributing to our environmental and carbon targets.\n\nWhat if I have too many bins already?\n\nWe can remove additional green or blue bins, however they must be empty and presented at the kerbside for removal. We do not remove brown bins as brown bins are used for food waste, which is a statutory service; brown bins must remain at the property. To have an additional green or blue bin uplifted please fill out our online form.\n\nCan I leave extra waste beside the bins for collection?\n\nNo. It is council policy that we cannot take extra bags beside a bin. If you cannot keep it until the next time your bin is due to be emptied, excess waste can be taken to any one of four household waste recycling centres (HWRC) across the city. Additional non-recyclable and recyclable waste can be disposed at the HWRC or you can arrange for a bulky uplift.\n\nWill my assisted pull-out service continue for my new bin?\n\nYes, if you already have an assisted collection then the new grey bin will be included in this service.\n\nHow do I receive information in a different format?\n\nThis information can be made available in a variety of alternate formats and community languages on request. If you would like more information about this or would like to request an alternative format or language, please contact us on 0141 287 9700 or by email.\n\nWhat if I miss a collection?\n\nIf you miss a bin collection, you will have to wait until the next scheduled collection date to have your bin emptied. If possible, take some of your waste to one of our household waste recycling centres, or wait until your next collection day or perhaps, with permission, try to use a neighbour or relative's bin.\n\nWhy bother about recycling when you can just burn the waste and get energy out of it?\n\nRecyclables have a value attached to them as a resource - the longer they stay in use, the better for the environment, the taxpayer and the local community.\n\nThe law in Scotland prevents anything else other than waste that cannot be recycled from going through an energy from waste plant. Recycling is a priority with the Scottish Government having a recycling target of 70% by 2025.\n\nI live in a flat - is my service changing?\n\nWe are trialling a new approach to the collection of household waste from tenement flats that will involve placing new, purpose-built bin-hubs at the front of properties.\n\nThe new approach will see bins emptied more frequently and we believe it will reduce missed bin collections while also helping residents to keep their back courts in better condition.\n\nParts of Pollokshields, Haghill and Berkeley Street have already received this new service and work is ongoing to provide it to the rest of the city over the next few years.\n\nYou can find out more information here.\n\nWhat if I have more recycling than will fit in my grey or blue bin?\n\nThe capacity provided for the grey and blue bin over a four-week provided will be sufficient for the vast majority of households. Please ensure all card and cardboard is flat packed to maximise space within your blue bin. In addition, squashing any plastic bottles, cartons, and cans will minimise the space they take up in the grey bin\n\nLarger recycling bins will not be provided.\n\nI want to report a missed collection\n\nIf your bin was tagged by our collection crew, it may have been contaminated or if your additional green bin was tagged it will not be collected as we only collect one green bin every 3 weeks. If your bin was presented on time and not contaminated, please follow this link for reporting a missed collection.\n\nWhat is your new contamination policy?\n\nYou can find more information on our contamination policy by following this link.\n\nWhat is your new green bin policy?"
