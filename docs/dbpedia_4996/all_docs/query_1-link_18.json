Occurring with a regular or predictable time relationship.\n\nT\n\nTelnet\n\nIn the Internet suite of protocols, a protocol that provides remote terminal connection service. It allows users of one host to log on to a remote host and interact as directly attached terminal users of that host.\n\nTimeout\n\nAn event that occurs at the end of a predetermined period of time that began at the occurrence of another specified event. A time interval allotted for certain operations to occur; for example, response to polling or addressing before system operation is interrupted and must be restarted.\n\nTitle bar\n\nThe area at the top of each window that contains the system-menu symbol, a small icon, a window title, and the maximize, minimize, and restore buttons.\n\nToken-bus network\n\nA bus network in which a token passing procedure is used.\n\nToken passing\n\nIn a token-ring network, the process by which a node captures a token; inserts a message, addresses, and control information; changes the bit pattern of the token to the bit pattern of a frame; transmits the frame; removes the frame from the ring when it has made a complete circuit; generates another token; and transmits the token on the ring where it can be captured by the next node that is ready to transmit.\n\nToken-ring network\n\nA ring network that allows unidirectional data transmission between data stations, by a token passing procedure, such that the transmitted data return to the transmitting station. A network that uses a ring topology, in which tokens are passed in a circuit from node to node. A node that is ready to send can capture the token and insert data for transmission.\n\nTopology\n\nIn communications, the physical or logical arrangement of nodes in a network, especially the relationships among nodes and the links between them.\n\nTransmission Control Protocol (TCP)\n\nA communications protocol used in the Internet and in any network that follows the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) standards for internetwork protocol. TCP provides a reliable host-to-host protocol between hosts in packet-switched communications networks and in interconnected systems of such networks. It uses the Internet Protocol (IP) as the underlying protocol.\n\nTransmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)\n\nThe Transmission Control Protocol and the Internet Protocol, which together provide reliable end-to-end connections between applications over interconnected networks of different types.\n\nThe suite of transport and application protocols that run over the Internet Protocol.\n\nTree network\n\nA network in which there is exactly one path between any two nodes\n\nTree structure\n\nA data structure that represents entities in nodes, with at most one parent node for each node, and with only one root node.\n\nU\n\nUniform resource locator (URL)\n\nA sequence of characters that represent information resources on a computer or in a network such as the Internet. This sequence of characters includes (a) the abbreviated name of the protocol used to access the information resource and (b) the information used by the protocol to locate the information resource. For example, in the context of the Internet, these are abbreviated names of some protocols used to access various information resources: http, ftp, gopher, telnet, and news; and this is the URL for the IBM home page: http://www.ibm.com. The address of an item on the World Wide Web. It includes the protocol followed by the fully qualified domain name (sometimes called the host name) and the request. The Web server typically maps the request portion of the URL to a path and file name. For example, if the URL is http://www.ibm.com/e-business/info/, the protocol is http; the fully qualified domain name is www.ibm.com; and the request is /e-business/info/.\n\nUser\n\nAny person or any thing that may issue or receive commands and messages to or from the information processing system.\n\nAnyone who requires the services of a computing system.\n\nV\n\nVirtual address\n\nThe address of a location in virtual storage. A virtual address must be translated into a real address in order to process the data in processor storage.\n\nVirtual store\n\nAn interactive simulation of a store on the World Wide Web.\n\nVisual Basic Script (VBScript)\n\nA scripting language that was developed by Microsoft for use with the Internet Explorer browser.\n\nW\n\nWeb browser\n\nA client program that initiates requests to a Web server and displays the information that the server returns.\n\nWebmaster\n\nThe person who is ultimately responsible for managing and maintaining a particular Web site.\n\nWeb page\n\nAny document that can be accessed by a uniform resource locator (URL) on the World Wide Web. A server that is connected to the Internet and is dedicated to serving Web pages.\n\nWeb site\n\nA Web server that is managed by a single entity (an organization or an individual) and contains information in hypertext for its users, often including hypertext links to other Web sites. Each Web site has a home page. In a uniform resource locator (URL), the Web site is indicated by the fully qualified domain name. For example, in the URL http://www.ibm.com/e-business/info/ the Web site is indicated by www.ibm.com, which is the fully qualified domain name.\n\nWide Area Network (WAN)\n\nA network that provides communication services to a geographic area larger than that served by a local area network or a metropolitan area network, and that may use or provide public communication facilities.\n\nA data communication network designed to serve an area of hundreds or thousands of miles; for example, public and private packet-switching networks, and national telephone networks.\n\nZ"
