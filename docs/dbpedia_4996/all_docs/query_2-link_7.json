        "text": "One ton at a time, we move our freshly milled grist through to our mash tun. As we add our grist, we pump water into the mash tun where the two elements meet in mid-air before filling the tun using a total of 9000 litres of water. Our mash tun is a stainless steel semi-lauter tun that features internal rotating rakes and a false floor bed.\n\nThe water that is added turns the starchy insides of the malt into soluble sugars that later in the process are turned into alcohol. To ensure we’re getting as much sugar as we can from the grist, the water is added at three different stages, increasing the temperatures of the water at each stage: 70 degrees, 80 degrees and the third and final water at 85 degrees Celsius.\n\nAfter the first run of water, the rakes inside the mash tun halt to allow the grain bed to set, acting as a filter for the water coming through.\n\nThe resulting sugary water that has been collected is known as wort. The wort from the first and second water is moved into a fermentation tank for the next stage of the process. The third and final water is separated into a hot water tank and used as the first water of the next run, recycling the water and residual sugars to ensure as little waste as possible.\n\nOnce fermented, the distillation process comes into play.\n\nThe 8% ABV wash is split equally into our two 2500 litre Wash Stills; these stills are named Tara and Margaret. Tara is our original Wash Still (installed in 2014) and is named after one of our founders' daughters.\n\nMargaret, an identical replica of Tara that was installed in 2019 as part of expanding our production capacity, is named after Margaret Macdonald Mackintosh the influential artist known for her work with metal and for helping to create the iconic Glasgow Style alongside her sister, Francis. Margaret married Charles Rennie Mackintosh and the two, alongside Margaret's sister Frances and her husband Herbert Mcnair were known as 'The Glasgow Four'.\n\nWithin our Wash Stills our wort is distilled slowly over 6 hours to create a 20-25% ABV spirit known as the Low Wines.\n\nAfter this, the low wines go through a second distillation over five hours in our spirit stills, Mhairi and Frances.\n\nThe low wines now get broken into three sections, the foreshots, the middle cut and the feints. With our hands-on approach here at The Glasgow Distillery, we use time, sight, smell and taste to distinguish between each.\n\nWe run our stills at a very slow pace; this ensures the spirit within has as much contact with the copper insides of the stills as possible. Increased copper contact naturally removes undesirable impurities and sulphates from the spirit, leaving us with a lovely sweet and fruity spirit character.\n\nAs spirit starts to come off the stills, it is split into three sections; the foreshots, the middle cut and the feints.\n\nThe foreshots, also known as the heads, are a little bit herbal and too sweet for what we would like and potentially contains harmful non-ethanol chemicals, so we run this off before the desired middle cut is taken - this middle cut is what will be captured and used to fill our casks and is known as the Hearts.\n\nOur Hearts are captured at different strengths for our three different distillation styles. Our unpeated triple distilled spirit starts to be captured from approximately 81% ABV to 75% ABV to give us fresh and wonderfully smooth hearts.\n\nThe unpeated double distilled runs from 72% ABV to 63% ABV providing us with intensely fruity and well-balanced hearts.\n\nOur double distilled peated spirit runs from 72% ABV and is then cut at 57% ABV to give us heavier and waxier robust smoky hearts.\n\nAs the hearts come to an end, we begin to nose the spirit as the sweetness begins to fade and becomes slightly oily, we head into the feints. The feints, also known as the tails, is the spirit that is not quite fruity and sweet enough to become our single malt scotch whisky.\n\nWe combine the heads and the tails of the run and will add them to our next distillation of low wines in a continuous circle of recycling.\n\nThe hearts from each spirit run is the spirit we use to fill our casks.\n\nJust like all distilleries, the shape and size of our stills are unique to us and have a great impact on our spirit. Our wash stills have a capacity of 2,500 litres each with steam coils as their heat source and a moderate decline in the lyne arm angle which is attached to shell and tube condensers.\n\nOur spirit stills are very similar to our wash stills but with a slight difference in size holding a capacity of 1,500 litres. The shape and size of our stills allow us to produce a wonderfully fruity spirit that will mature nicely in oak casks. The stills we have at The Glasgow Distillery are shaped so that they allow us to make our three styles of new make spirit using the same equipment.\n\nOur original wash and spirit stills are named Tara and Mhairi. In 2019 we installed Margaret and Frances – identical replicas of the original set and named after two Glaswegian artists, and sisters, Margaret and Frances McDonald. Both were prominent members of 'The Glasgow Girls', a group of pioneering female artists who forged the iconic art nouveau style which the city still celebrates to this day.\n\nNow that we have our new make spirit, we move onto the final part of the process: maturation.\n\nWe combine our hearts into our spirit tank, where roughly one week’s production is combined at any one time. Within the spirit tank, we bring the alcohol percentage of the new make spirit down to 63.5% ABV which is the strength we will fill our casks at.\n\nThe majority of our unpeated spirit, both double and triple distilled, is filled into casks which have previously held Bourbon, which come to us from various well know producers from the USA.\n\nThe majority of our peated spirit is filled directly into virgin American white oak barrels, shipped to us from Kelvin Cooperage. Kelvin Cooperage was set up in the 60's on the banks of the river Kelvin that runs through the heart of Glasgow. In the 90s they relocated to Kentucky to be closer to the Bourbon and wine industry. We’re proud to be bringing their quality craftmanship back to the city the Cooperage originally called home.\n\nEvery year, we also fill a wide selection of speciality casks; be that wine, sherry, port, beer, tequila, Moscatel, Marsala, Tokaji, rum, and more. We fill these speciality casks with each of our three new make spirit styles. The interaction between the different spirit types and cask styles provides us with a wide variety of interesting flavour characteristics and potential releases.\n\nThese casks are sampled on a regular basis in our distillery Tasting Room and are released as Limited Editions or as part of our experimental Small Batch Series."
