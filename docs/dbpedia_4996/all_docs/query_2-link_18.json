        "text": "Meet the Experts in Residence: Lincoln IP\n\n13 May 2024\n\nInformation Officer Savannah McKibbin introduces us to another of our Experts in Residence, Daniel Coward, our Intellectual Property Expert from Lincoln IP\n\nThe final expert we will talk to in this series is Daniel, our IP Expert in Residence from Lincoln IP. Daniel runs very popular confidential advice clinics in the Mitchell Library. If you’d like free professional advice on any aspect of Intellectual Property, book a space on Eventbrite https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/o/bipcglasgow-14999039432\n\nCan you tell us a little bit about yourself?\n\nI’m a patent attorney based in Lincoln IP’s Glasgow office. I started in the IP profession in 2018 after completing an undergraduate degree in Natural Sciences (Chemistry and Mathematics) at Durham University and a PhD in Chemistry at the University of Edinburgh. It was towards the end of my PhD that I realised that lab life wasn’t for me, but that I enjoyed the learning, reading and writing aspects of science – which led me perfectly to a career as a patent attorney!\n\nOutside of work, I’m a football fan – albeit one with a severely limited playing ability, so I tend to stick to watching games across the UK and internationally. I’m more adept on the badminton court and have been playing from a young age.\n\nCan you tell us about Lincoln IP?\n\nLincoln IP is a firm of patent and trade mark attorneys. Our delivery of intellectual property services supports the innovation and flair of businesses across the UK and around the world. We are headquartered in the UK, with offices in Aberdeen and Glasgow. Within our team, there’s a mix of both patent attorneys and trade mark attorneys. We work together to provide a personalised approach to delivering clear, strategic advice on patents, trade marks and designs across a broad range of sectors.\n\nMy expertise is in the fields of chemistry, green technology and life sciences. My colleagues are experts in the other scientific disciplines – including physics and engineering.\n\nFavourite topics to discuss?\n\nOnce I start talking about IP, it’s difficult to get me to stop and my IP Clinic appointments often overrun! As a patent attorney, I love walking people through the intricacies of the patent system and explaining what an invention needs to be patentable.\n\nThat being said, I also love the challenging questions that make me scratch my head and require me to go and research further into the statutes and case law. Copyright questions typically fall into this category, as it’s a highly subjective area which is guided by cases that have gone to court. It also has relevance to almost all businesses, because it includes everything from technical drawings to marketing materials. I’ve learnt a lot about copyright through the IP Clinic!\n\nWhat do you enjoy most about working with BIPC Glasgow?\n\nIP can typically be quite expensive to pursue, and so BIPC Glasgow provide a fantastic service in making IP advice accessible to all.\n\nI’ve been working with BIPC Glasgow since November 2022, and it’s been great to get to speak with so many different people whose ideas and businesses cover such a wide spectrum, and to see first-hand the entrepreneurial spirit that so many people in Glasgow and across Scotland have.\n\nIt means a lot to me that everyone I’ve spoken to at the IP Clinic has taken a genuine interest in IP, and I’ve done my job well if people leave appointments having learnt something new with an enthusiasm to explore how IP can help their business to develop and grow.\n\nWhat is one piece of advice you would give to someone starting off on their IP Journey?\n\nThink about IP early! There are several IP strategies that one can adopt, and there is no “one-size-fits-all” model. For example, it may be that you decide not to file a patent application for an invention – be it for technical, commercial, or financial reasons. However, at least you’ve actively made that decision with all the facts laid out in front of you. With IP, there’s lots of opportunities for mistakes that can’t be undone (such as telling people about an invention before filing a patent application). Thinking about IP early is the best way to avoid these mistakes.\n\nFollowing on from this, having a good relationship with your IP advisor is so important. The better they understand your business, the better they can advise on IP and devise a strategy that works best for your particular business needs.\n\nGetting Inspired to Start Up in the Fitness Industry\n\n29 April 2024\n\nInformation Officer Alistair McCafferty-Bain looks at the BIPC resources which can help support the Fitness Industry\n\nWe’ve been lucky enough this year to be able to run some fantastic events with the support of the British Library. Looking back, I was really inspired by the Wellness Warriors screening event for International Women's Day. BIPC Glasgow even managed to get a shout out on the live stream, and it was great to have a member of the panel answer one of our questions. It’s great when technology works! With the UK fitness industry valued at just over £3 billion last year (Statista, December 2023) there’s lot of opportunity out there to get started, whether that’s establishing innovative brands, using health technology, or creating inclusive fitness communities.\n\nHaving a start-up idea: Personal Trainer\n\nSpeaking to BIPC customers at the event it was interesting to learn the type of support they needed to set up in this industry, so here I am a few months later putting those lessons into practice. I learnt that one aspect which often isn’t covered is intellectual property (IP) around fitness, so using my knowledge I thought coming up with some starting points might be useful. Rather than go through all the possible examples I’m going to focus on how IP might relate to one of the most common start-up ideas, becoming a Personal Trainer (PT). So here we go, time to flex my IP muscles!\n\nSource: Andrea Piacquadio via Pexels\n\nWhere do I start with intellectual property for a personal trainer?\n\nIP is sometimes associated with big innovative companies such as Apple or Dyson, but it’s important to consider this aspect of your business from the very start. It applies to all start-ups, no matter the scale of ambition or the industry, it’s just a matter of knowing how it applies to you. If you were thinking of becoming a PT then here are some places to start.\n\nBrand name, logos and slogans – If you’re using a brand name, logo or slogan for your PT services then these are all aspects which fall under trade marks. Trade marks are simply visual identifiers which let customers know where the goods or services they buy are coming from. These can grow in value as your reputation increases and can be used to generate income through licencing and franchising. You should check no one is using any of the elements you want to use for your business and then you can secure them with a registered trade mark if it’s considered distinctive. The Intellectual Property Office is a great source of information on this topic.\n\nMusic – If you plan to use music in your classes then look at any licenses for copyright permission that you may need. If you’re running a class in a gym then they may already have a licence such as TheMusicLicence provided by PPL PRS. If you’re planning on using a venue without a license then you can look into obtaining one. There’s also separate guidance for running online classes.\n\nExercise routines – Your unique selling point as a PT might be the routine you create. Protecting a routine itself is a grey area as copyright only protects specific works listed under the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act. This includes the expression of routines in a fixed form such as videos (as films) and live streams (as broadcasts). You will need to consider ownership of the work (whether you created it independently or in work under an employment contract for example), whether music is included (see licence information above), and the rules of the platform you upload or stream it from (YouTube users can share and download videos without infringing copyright for example). There’s a useful article on Lexology called ‘Stretching Copyright: Protecting online fitness workouts’ if you’d like some further reading.\n\nSupport for intellectual property at BIPC Glasgow\n\nIf you’re thinking of starting up in the fitness industry (or any industry!) and need support with intellectual property then BIPC Glasgow is here to help. We offer 1:1 appointments with the team to take you through the basics, and we also partner with two local IP Attorneys who can offer expert information during free monthly IP Clinics. Our workshops and events are updated every month and always include chances to learn about IP. You can always email the BIPC Glasgow team if you’d like to arrange an appointment outside the schedule at business@glasgowlife.org.uk\n\nSource: Mintel Reports\n\nSource: Overdrive eMagazines\n\nFurther BIPC support for the fitness industry\n\nHopefully I’ve been able to give some good starting points for IP within the fitness industry. Remember IP is just one aspect of planning your business we can support you with. We have some fantastic market research eResources available at BIPC Glasgow too such as Mintel which is regularly updated with industry, consumer and trend reports for the fitness industry, and ProQuest which is a database containing business articles and reports.

There’s also additional start-up finance support if you need it.\n\nFavourite topics to discuss?\n\nI love the initial conversations with the young people that come onto the Enterprise programme.\n\nFinding out about their business, listening to their ideas and making plans for the future.\n\nSpeaking with many innovative and creative young people on a daily basis means no two days are the same.\n\nLooking back on these conversations and seeing how far people have come when they reach the point of launching their business will always be my favourite part of the job.\n\nWhat do you enjoy most about working with BIPC Glasgow?\n\nWorking with BIPC opens up the opportunities available to our young people in Glasgow.\n\nThe team are dedicated to supporting businesses in Glasgow and have so many resources available that are invaluable to our young people.\n\nWhat is one piece of advice you would give to someone thinking of starting a business?\n\nPlan, Plan, Plan…\n\nTake time to research your business, competitors, suppliers, the market, costs, pricing.\n\nUse all the resources available to you to help you in this process to ensure you are making informed decisions moving forward.\n\nReviews and Previews\n\n2 April 2024\n\nInformation Officer Kavan Stafford looks back on BIPC events 2023-24\n\nFor businesses all over the country April doesn’t just mean the approach of warmer Spring weather, it is also the end of the financial year and the beginning of the next. The challenges of last year are over and the opportunities of the next are approaching. It’s a time to take stock and to reflect on what came before, as well as to look forward to and plan an exciting year ahead.\n\nLooking Back\n\nOne of the things we have been proudest of here at BIPC Glasgow over the past year has been how many networking opportunities we have provided for Glasgow businesses. Our new Networking Coffee Mornings offered the chance for business owners and prospective entrepreneurs to get to know each other in a relaxed and informal setting while having a cup of tea or coffee and a fantastic breakfast roll provided by the Mitchell Café completely free. These have quickly become one of our most popular events and are regularly sold out. Part of the reason these events are so valuable for small businesses is that they provide the rare opportunity to build support networks and to get to know others in the same position as you. The chat often goes on long after the events end, moving out into the library space, and the relationships formed hopefully last for even longer.\n\nFood and networking have been a feature of many of our events this year. We have been offering some of our most popular workshops, including “Plan Your Business with COBRA” and “How to Make the Most Out of Your Hobbies with a Side Hustle”, as “Learning Lunches” and “Teatime Talks”. These events offer our usual fantastic workshops along with sandwiches, soup and refreshments as well as an opportunity before and after to speak with the other attendees about your business. We know how busy small business owners are, and so we have been very excited to offer the chance to combine learning with having a lovely snack at the library.\n\nOf course, this past year wouldn’t have been the same without our brilliant partners who worked with us throughout. As well as helping us to offer our ever-popular “Experts in Residence” series, we had some fabulous one-off events including “Wellness Warriors” from BIPC London for International Women’s Day and “Social Enterprises: Legal Structures and Start Up Funding” from our partners at Glasgow City Council.\n\nFinally, one of the best things we’ve introduced at BIPC Glasgow this year have been our hybrid workshops. The pandemic taught us all the power of using technology to reach each other when being together physically wasn’t possible, and the new world since has been all about the ability to choose between physical events and simultaneous virtual events. We at BIPC Glasgow have been so excited to be able to join this trend, allowing you to join us for our workshops wherever you are in the city.\n\nLooking Forward\n\nThe new financial year is going to bring some exciting changes with it. We will be continuing with all the great things we put into place last year, like our coffee mornings, and building upon them to give you an even better service going forward.\n\nOne of the things we are looking forward to sharing with you are our brand new Intellectual Property workshops. IP has always been a key part of the BIPC Glasgow offer, but now for the first time we are going to be running separate workshops covering Copyright, Patents and Trademarks. These workshops will give these topics the time they deserve and hopefully show you how IP can add value to your business. We start off with a workshop focussing onTrademarks and Branding.\n\nOur partners will be back with some new workshops too. Our first will be a special workshop on the 18th of April from our long-time accountancy partners Paris & McNally, “Start-Up for the Self Employed”, a one-off half-day event aiming to ensure you leave with an understanding of the skills you need and the actions you need to take to start your business, but there will be plenty more to come.\n\nThere is also one more change coming this year. After almost five years of working at BIPC Glasgow, I will be off to pastures new. I’ve learned a lot working here and met a lot of wonderful entrepreneurs and worked with some fantastic people. I’ll miss it all. But don’t forget that the rest of the BIPC Glasgow team will still be there six days a week to answer all your business queries. Just email business@glasgowlife.org.uk or visit https://libcat.csglasgow.org/web/arena/business for more information.\n\nKavan Stafford is an Information Officer at BIPC Glasgow. Best of luck in the future Kavan!\n\nMeet the Experts in Residence: Parris & McNally\n\n18 March 2024\n\nInformation Officer Savannah McKibbin finds out more about our Chartered Accountant Expert in Residence\n\nCan you tell us a little bit about yourself?\n\nI was born and grew up in Ayrshire before moving to University to Study Business Studies, and then joined the Global Drinks Company Diageo Plc, working for most of my twelve years delivering financial management and control for Global IT projects. Leaving Diageo in 2008 I founded CJM which is a project financial management company. This has developed to be a National provider of Business Advisory and Consultancy to many organisations including The Scottish Government, Business Gateway, Highlands and Islands Enterprise, Glasgow Council and Just Enterprise.\n\nCan you tell us about Parris & McNally?\n\nParris & McNally was born out of CJM, we needed a very distinctive company to support SME's and their accountancy needs. Along with my Business Partner Lucy Parris we have founded and built up Parris & McNally to be a highly focused digital specialist accountant to a range of micro, small and medium sized enterprises. We are Xero Gold Partners, and focus very much on Cloud Accounting, alongside bookkeeping, payroll, tax, self assessments, forecasting, management accounting and Limited companies. We are delighted to be part of the BPIC programme and support many business and business owners with their accountancy requirements.\n\nFavourite topics to discuss?\n\nWe love a good chat about accountancy systems and to see how they can provide efficiency to business, reviewing management accounts and developing reporting and cost control measures, to advising start up businesses to set up and register correctly, from Self Assessment to setting up a Limited company.\n\nWhat do you enjoy most about working with BIPC Glasgow?\n\nThe opportunity to work within a team who are focused on delivering support and assistance to business in Glasgow, to have the opportunity to work with a variety of clients with such a wide range of business and to see then flourish on our advice.\n\nWhat is one piece of advice you would give to someone starting off on business journey?\n\nPlan....One key thing I have learned is that setting up a business is not easy, it takes more time than you think, and no matter how hard you think it through something will come in from the side and knock you off track. So plan the business from day one, what do you need to buy, how do I register, plan the bank account you need, do a cash flow, know what funding you require. In then end preparation and planning does prevent poor performance.\n\nParris & McNally BIO\n\nOver the last decade the senior partners of Parris & McNally have built a solid reputation for providing the highest standard of accounting and financial management services to its clients throughout the West of Scotland. Their mission is to provide a flexible, approachable, one-stop service for all of your accounting needs.\n\nDuring the One-to-One session you can discuss a range of topics including HMRC and Tax requirements, bookkeeping and the basics of writing a good business plan.\n\nScaling up with the BIPC network\n\n4 March 2024\n\nKaryn Don, Librarian with the BIPC, explains some of the advantages of being part of the BIPC network\n\nGlasgow Business and Intellectual Property Centre is the only Scottish member of the BIPC network, based in the British Library. Being part of this network brings lots of benefits with access to a whole range of webinars, screenings and support to supplement our own offer.\n\nEvery 3 months, applications open for the next cohort to join the ‘Get Ready for Business Growth’ scale up programme. This programme is a fantastic opportunity for any Scottish business who match the following criteria:\n\n· Your business has a turnover of £100,000 or more\n\n· Your business is based in England or Scotland\n\n· You can commit to a minimum of 20 hours over three months\n\n· You have big ambitions to scale and grow your business.\n\n· Your business falls into one of the following categories:\n\n· Advertising and marketing\n\n· Architecture\n\n· Crafts\n\n· Design\n\n· Fashion\n\n· Film, TV, video, radio and photography\n\n· IT, software and computer services\n\n· Publishing\n\n· Museums, galleries and libraries\n\n· Music, performing and visual arts\n\n· Bookshops\n\nEach intake of 25 high-growth businesses take part in a series of online one-to-one meetings experts. Nine modules are followed covering the following topics:\n\n· Getting the growth mindset\n\n· Good governance & building purpose into your organisation\n\n· Refining your business model & growth strategy\n\n· Product & service innovation\n\n· Maximising your intellectual property (IP)\n\n· Building your brand\n\n· Creating a marketing strategy\n\n· Financial planning for growth\n\n· Business and & IP research\n\nEach module adds to the Business Model Canvas as you work through the programme.\n\nIf you’re not convinced it is for you, maybe the words of Damien Mosley, founder of independent publisher Indie Novella, will help convince you.\n\nGet Ready For Business Growth has been extremely helpful and has provided so much clarity on what we need to focus on to make our business grow and adapt to the current market place. The resources on branding and experience of the staff when it comes to marketing has given us a clear plan of what our priorities should be now and where to focus our time.\n\nThe support had given us confidence to go bigger and bolder and bring forward initiatives such as engaging with larger clients and explaining the value we offer in a far clearer manner. Later this month we are running our biggest project to date - The Alternative Book Fair London - which is a week of author events and a full day of stalls and exhibits by leading publishers.\n\nThe best piece of business advice I’ve ever been given is to understand who you are and what you are passionate about. It was not to worry about the term USP in its literal sense as nothing these days is 100% unique, but rather think about what makes 'you' you, and then be true to that in your branding and messaging. Have that passion pitch written out and ready to tell people.\n\nEmail scaleup@bl.uk to express your interest and to find out next steps.\n\nKaryn Don is a Librarian with BIPC Glasgow\n\nMeet the Experts in Residence: Gilson Gray\n\n19 February 2024\n\nInformation Officer Savannah McKibbin finds out more about our legal Expert in Residence\n\nPerhaps one of the most exciting programmes that we run here at BIPC Glasgow is our Experts in Residence Programme. This programme of free, confidential, 30 minute sessions allows individuals to access advice on matters ranging from accountancy to Intellectual Property to general legal advice. To enable this, BIPC Glasgow partners with various local firms to ensure that the people of Glasgow have the best possible start on their business journey and have access to the professional advice they require.\n\nThe purpose of this blog will serve as an introduction to the individuals and the companies we partner with and give you a better understanding of the support they can offer.\n\nThe first partner that we will find out more about is our Legal Expert in Residence: Daniel Sinclair from Gilson Gray LLP.\n\nCan you tell us a little bit about yourself?\n\nI am a Corporate Solicitor based in Edinburgh and Glasgow. I studied my undergraduate law degree, and Postgraduate Certificate in Financial Markets and Banking in Edinburgh. I studied my Diploma in Legal Practice, and my Corporate and Financial Law masters at Glasgow Uni. I qualified as a Solicitor in September 2023. My traineeship was split into Commercial Real Estate and Corporate and Commercial practice.\n\nOutside of work, I like to learn new skills and hobbies. I am a keen football player and play regular kickabout football in Edinburgh on Saturdays. I like to travel and visit new places. I am currently learning Italian and will be looking to start a night school course to learn more and hopefully become fluent one day.\n\nFrom a relatively young age, I have always been fascinated by business and commerce. From how businesses function, to how they overcome challenges, and what drives entrepreneurship and innovation have always been interesting to me.\n\nMy favourite films are Good Will Hunting, The Great Gatsby, Great Expectations, and Liar Liar.\n\nMy favourite books are The Shawshank Redemption, and Barbarians at the Gate.\n\nCan you tell us about Gilson Gray LLP?\n\nGilson Gray LLP are a full service law firm with offices in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen, Dundee, North Berwick, and Lincoln. We provide advice on almost every aspect of legal practice (excluding criminal legal advice).\n\nWe are known as the challenger law firm because we are only 10 years old but have grown faster than any other law firm in Scotland. Fundamental to that growth is that we challenge the norm. We are by no means a stuffy old fashioned law firm. We go beyond the black letter law and adopt a commercial approach at the heart of our advice to our clients. We go beyond the short term and look to build lasting relationships with our clients to assist whenever they need us.\n\nFavourite topics to discuss?\n\nMy favourite topics to discuss with clients always have a flavour of corporate and commercial legal practice. I often advise clients on corporate structures, incorporating a new company, terms and conditions for the provision of goods or services, employee share schemes, M&A activity, corporate and loan financing, partnership agreement structures, and issues to consider for family businesses.\n\nI also provide commercial advice for clients that go beyond the black letter law. Sometimes a client may have a legal right, but it doesn’t serve them commercially to invoke it. For me, it’s about seeing the bigger economic and practical picture when providing legal and commercial advice. This serves to help clients make the best decision for their business.\n\nWhat do you enjoy most about working with BIPC Glasgow?\n\nI have worked with the BIPC for almost a year now. I enjoy meeting each new member at my monthly appointment afternoon sessions. You tend to never get two businesses the same. The same can be said for each legal session appointment I take with a respective BIPC member. It’s always a new issue, or business idea that I have to think about providing a solution to from a legal and commercial perspective. This keeps me on my toes and often lets me consider commercial issues in a refreshing new way.\n\nWhat is one piece of advice you would give to someone starting off on their business journey?\n\nThis might sound clichéd but do your homework. Look at the market you are trying to operate in, what the competition is doing, and how you can improve on what they are doing. Is there a gap in the market you can provide a solution to? Is there a problem that you can solve? And how are you going to monetise it?\n\nDevelop a good relationship with a lawyer and an accountant. Their advice is invaluable and can often save you a lot of money, hassle, and grief in the long run.\n\nThink about where you want the business to go early. Set out a plan for where you want it to be next year or in five years’ time and be ambitious – “shoot for the moon and you might hit the stars”.\n\nLastly and most importantly, each day is a school day in terms of learning and progressing to get better at what you do. Mistakes are the most powerful learning tools, so never be afraid to make them. You will learn more from your mistakes than your successes – enjoy the journey!\n\nGilson Gray LLP BIO\n\nGilson Gray is a multi award winning full-service law firm with offices in Edinburgh, Glasgow and East Lothian. They offer specialist legal, property and financial* services. Their partner-led teams include accredited specialists and award-winning individuals. They are focused on you and your goals.

If anyone mentioned any of these foods to you then I imagine you’d think of one place – Scotland. Food is a huge part of our culture and daily lives, and one of the largest industries in the country. To put it into perspective, here are some fact and figures about the Scottish food manufacturing industry:\n\nFood is Scotland’s largest manufacturing sector, accounting for 33%\n\nEmploys 48,000 people\n\nHas a turnover of £10.3 billion\n\n95% of Scottish food manufacturing businesses are SMEs.\n\nSource: Food & Drink Federation, 2022\n\nIt’s interesting that such a huge sector is made primarily from SMEs, with plenty of thriving small businesses being part of this. Manufacturing sits alongside other related food sectors such as growing, retailing and foodservice, so there’s lots of opportunity out there. So how do you get started? How do you grow your food business? How do you keep up to date with food trends? Well doughnut worry, we have egg-cellent information about the food industry available through BIPC Glasgow resources that can help you out.\n\nPlan Your Food Business with COBRA\n\nFor anyone that’s just at the start of their food business journey COBRA offers introductory profiles that can help you research your idea, decide, and plan your next steps. Their business opportunity profiles (BOPs) range from:\n\n‘BOP085 Fast Food Takeaway’ to…\n\n‘BOP074 Independent Brewery’ and…\n\n‘BOP016 Caterer/Buffet Service’\n\n…and many more. COBRA also offers business information factsheets (BOPs) that take you through the legal aspects such as labelling requirements, hygiene regulations, food safety, and any additional licences and inspections.\n\nSource: COBRA Foodservice Industry Snapshot SYN010, 2023\n\nCOBRA also has useful links to further sources of trusted industry data and the main industry regulators and professional bodies in the UK as part of their sector research guides:\n\n‘SRG011 Food and Grocery Retail’\n\n‘SRG003 Hospitality’\n\n‘SRG014 Manufacturing’\n\nSome sectors such as foodservice even have an Industry Snapshot which is a great tool for taking a quick look at some of the current trends. There’s no reason not to go to COBRA if you’re looking for anything food business related, especially as it’s available to access anywhere with a Glasgow Library membership!\n\nResearch Your Food Business with Mintel\n\nSource: Mintel, 2024\n\nIf you need a market analysis then Mintel is a great place to start. Their reports include research on products, consumers, and global trends that affect the food industry. If you’re planning on designing or selling a successful product then you’ll want to know who you’re selling to and what drives their attitudes towards food and purchasing behaviour. You might want to find out what your competitors are offering and how you can stand out from the competition. Mintel is a great source of inspiration too, but also perfect for getting the facts and figures needed to back up your plan. This resource is only available at the Mitchell Library so why not come in and visit and take a look, with staff available to guide you if you need a little help.\n\nFood Industry News with The Grocer\n\nSource: www.thegrocer.co.uk\n\nIf you’re looking to keep up to date with food industry news then The Grocer is a leading UK source of information. Through Glasgow Libraries you can access physical copies of this weekly publication, as well as their online service.

In this particular case it all started with a simple invitation. Back in August I was invited to the official launch of Smart Works Glasgow after we learned all about them when a member of their team attended one of our networking coffee mornings. Smart Works is a UK wide charity that gives unemployed women the clothes (for free and to keep!) and also the coaching and confidence to help secure employment and change their lives. The service is run by a team of staff and volunteers who are passionate about empowering women. They also offer a virtual service for anyone who would find it difficult to visit them in person. You can find out more on their website scotland.smartworks.org.uk\n\nVisiting Smart Works\n\nTheir Glasgow office is based right in the heart of the Merchant City, and during my visit I was lucky enough to get a tour. I was amazed by what was on offer, the main space filled floor-to-ceiling with clothes, shoes, and accessories to match every individual personal style. I also got to hear about their ScottishPower Foundation project which has been set up to reach ethnic minority communities in and around Glasgow, and to support more women from these backgrounds into employment offering a new interpreting service.\n\nI met some great people at the event, finding out about the work of other business support organisations in the Glasgow area. I heard from CEMVO Scotland and their work helping to develop businesses with a more diverse workforce. I would recommend getting in touch with them if you want to find way to promote opportunities to ethnic minorities. I also heard from Amina - The Muslim Women's Resource Centre, a Scottish charity which doing great work to support Muslim and BME women to build employability skills and provide peer to peer support.\n\nBIPC eResources for employability and recruitment\n\nGoing out and seeing what support is out there on our doorstep is an important part of our centre’s learning. BIPC Glasgow provides more than business and intellectual property information, we also want to build an extended support network through partnerships and expertise just like those seen at Smart Works. As a result, we can now offer referrals to the service for any eligible women we meet at BIPC Glasgow. It’s also offered a new perspective on how our own resources can be used.\n\nEmployability is a different approach to using the BIPC Glasgow eResources. If you have an upcoming interview just like someone using Smart Works, then our FAME company information database can give you an inside look at your possible new employer. Understanding the company and your potential position allows you to see how you might fit in, and what their aims and values are. You could also try our Mintel resource too and take a look at how the industry is performing, checking out the latest news and trends. It might help you prepare questions that demonstrate your interest and stand out from other candidates.\n\nPerhaps you’re the one in a position to be looking for new staff, then our COBRA resource can provide guides such as BIF213 Employers' Checklist for Job Interviews. You could also keep up to date with legislation using BIF473 A Guide to the Equality Act 2010 to make sure you’re getting this aspect right for your business too. Whatever the situation, there’s usually something useful at hand on COBRA.\n\nWhere can I find further information?\n\nIt’s inspiring to see the work going on to make Glasgow businesses diverse, and to be able to play a in supporting this too. If you’re eligible for Smart Works and interested in their offer then let us know and we can refer you on to their fantastic service, or if you’d like to know how to use any of our BIPC resources for employability or recruitment then simply email the team at business@glasgowlife.org.uk.\n\nAlistair McCafferty-Bain is Information Officer at BIPC Glasgow\n\nA Little Help\n\n6 November 2023\n\nInformation Officer Kavan Stafford explains the help out there for start-ups\n\nStarting a business can feel like a lonely endeavour. It can be hard to find help when you need it, especially locally. The truth is, however, that there is a great deal of help available for small business owners right here in Glasgow, from information to advice and even potential funding. In this post, we are going to look at some of the best providers of help in Glasgow and highlight the different things they all provide.\n\nBIPC Glasgow\n\nOf course, we have to start with ourselves! We at BIPC Glasgow are based in the Mitchell Library just outside of the city centre and we can give you information to help you with your business at all stages. We can help you with planning, with information about intellectual property like trademarks and patents, and offer free one-to-ones and workshops to help you make the best use possible of our many fantastic online resources such as MINTEL and FAME. We have access to half an hour of free professional advice from Chartered Accountants, Legal Advisors, and Intellectual Property Solicitors. We also run regular networking events like coffee mornings and event screenings and, since we are part of Glasgow Libraries, we can also offer quiet working spaces and access to computers so you can get out of the home office. You can find out more about us at our website here.\n\nBusiness Gateway\n\nWhile we at BIPC Glasgow can offer an information service to help you make the most of our resources, Business Gateway take a more advice-focused approach. Through their Planning to Start tool, they can help you validate your idea and then research, price, plan and market your new business. They have experienced advisors who can help you avoid common pitfalls and make sure you know what you need to do in the early months of your business. They also run some fantastic workshops on useful topics like social media marketing, finances and more.\n\nScottish Women in Business\n\nIf you are a woman starting out in business, then the leading networking group for businesswomen in Glasgow can help! They are a welcoming and diverse group of businesswomen, offering a wealth of experience from many different sectors – from sole traders to charities to corporate high fliers. They offer a chilled-out networking format with great dining venues and impressive speakers. You can attend up to three events as a non-member to see if it works for you before joining.\n\nBarclays Eagle Labs\n\nBased just across the river from the city-centre, Barclays Eagle Labs have a fantastic offer available. They can help start-ups by giving you access to other entrepreneurs and like-minded business experts to help you along your journey, can put you in touch with a trusted network of potential investors if you’re in need of funding, and can, for a varied membership fee, offer fast wifi, free refreshments, event spaces, a development suite and content lounge. To find out more, check out their Glasgow website here.\n\nCo-Working Spaces\n\nIf your business is online, or is not yet at the size at which you would need a dedicated office, but you still want to get out of the house and meet new people, or even just a place to meet clients in person, co-working spaces could be an answer. There are a variety of these, at a variety of prices from free onwards, around Glasgow, most of which are aimed at small businesses. Some of these include The Glasgow Collective, The Distillery, East Campbell Street, Collabor8te, but there are many more all around the city for all kinds of budgets.\n\nAll of these organisations and more can be found in BIPC Glasgow’s COBRA resource, in the Glasgow “Local Area Profile”. You can access this for free in library and from home using your library card and selecting COBRA from our list of online resources here.\n\nRemember, if you need any help with this or any other resource, all you have to do is email us at business@glasgowlife.org.uk or call 0141 287 2904 to speak to a member of staff and we would be glad to help.\n\nKavan Stafford is Information Officer at BIPC Glasgow\n\nMarket Research for Christmas\n\n24th October 2023\n\nInformation Officer Alistair McCafferty-Bain explains all we might want for Christmas.\n\nWhen I say Christmas market, I wonder what springs to mind? Could it be the familiar sound of well-known carols, the aroma of mulled wine in the air, or the twinkling lights and decorations adorning wooden stalls. What if I said Christmas market research? With Christmas being one of the most profitable times of the year for many businesses it’s important to think ahead, and market research can help you plan well in advance and make the most of the holiday season.\n\nSource: Unsplash (Christmas market in Edinburgh)\n\nWhere to start my Christmas market research?\n\nWith so much to think about, where’s a good place to start? Why not start with Mintel, a global market intelligence and research agency you can access for free through BIPC Glasgow eResources. It covers industry reports, news, insights and trends. There are a number of general reports which can be useful for many different businesses, looking at consumer behaviour, spending habits, and the retail landscape. Using these will help you understand your customers, which is often this first goal of market research. Here are a couple of examples:\n\nConsumers and the Economic Outlook Q3 2023 (Includes: current financial situation and planned spending activity)\n\nUK Retail Trends: Autumn 2023 (Includes: market environment, retail sales performance, shopping behaviour)\n\nThere’s a great section in the Mintel UK Retail Trends: Autumn 2023 report which focusses on Christmas predictions. It looks at areas such as when best to start selling your festive products, what products might be best sellers, and what retail experiences might boost sales. Their three key findings are less is more, keep it special, and dictate demand. You can dive into the detail of the report through access at the Mitchell Library.\n\nSource: Mintel UK Retail Trends: Autumn 2023\n\nGetting your business ready for Christmas\n\nYou may also have some practical requirements that need research.

Using the creative works of others\n\n9th October 2023\n\nInformation Officer Kavan Stafford explains some of the tricky issues of copyright ownership\n\nA common theme we see in copyright-related questions we receive at BIPC Glasgow is about using the copyright of others. Business owners ask if it’s possible, how to do it, and whether they need permission. The answers to this can be complex and will always depend on the individual situation but, hopefully, this blog will go some way to answering some of those questions.\n\nWhat is copyright?\n\nTo begin with, it’s important to be clear as to what copyright is. Copyright is the intellectual property protection afforded to creative works of the mind. Creative here is defined in the broadest possible sense. It includes the kinds of things you might imagine, such as books, music and paintings. But it can also include things we may not typically regard as creative works such as instruction manuals or PowerPoint presentations. Even the blog you are reading right now is covered by copyright. Copyright is an automatic right, meaning you do not need to apply for it to be covered, and allows the individual who owns it control of the creative product. You can find out more about copyright from the Intellectual Property Office of the UK.\n\nWho owns copyright?\n\nGenerally speaking, copyright is owned by the principal creator. In the case of a novel, it would be the author. In a case of a painting, the artist. This can become slightly more complicated when, as is very likely, a business hires someone to created creative material of some kind for them. At BIPC Glasgow, we are often asked who would own the copyright in that scenario.\n\nThere are two possible scenarios in the case of a business engaging an individual to create work for them. The first is the most simple. If a creative work is created by an employed individual in the course of their employment and is a reasonable part of their role, then the business would own the copyright. I have mentioned already that this blog is protected by copyright. However, though it was written by me, the copyright is in fact owned by my employer, Glasgow Life, as work such as this is an expected part of the role they are paying me to perform.\n\nSo far, so straight-forward. But what happens when a business contracts an outside worker to create copyrighted material? In this case, the copyright would automatically remain with the individual who created it. If you, as a business owner, would like to own the copyright of material created by a contractor, you must make this clear in the terms of your initial contract with them. Only then would you own the work outright.\n\nCan you use the copyright of others?\n\nThe short answer is yes! Copyright, like all Intellectual Property, operates in the same way as physical assets. It can be bought, sold or licensed for use as long as you have permission from the copyright holder. All you have to do is get in touch with the copyright holder to arrange terms and you are perfectly fine to use copyright owned by others. This goes both ways; licensing your own copyright for use by others can be a lucrative endeavour if done properly. The important thing is to make sure that the contracts involved are as clear as possible. For this, you may want to consult a lawyer. If so, BIPC Glasgow can offer free half-hour sessions with expert IP attorneys at Lincoln IP and Murgitroyd to help you on your way.\n\nRemember, though, that you must get permission from the copyright holder in order to use their material. Using copyrighted material without permission could result in legal action being taken against you so it’s important to make sure you do everything right. However, if you are unable to find the copyright owner, don’t panic! You can make use of the IPO’s “Orphan Works” scheme. This allows you to pay a small fee to the IPO in order to use a work for which you cannot trace the original owner. In the event that the original owner comes forward, the IPO will pass that fee on to them. That keeps you right legally and allows you to use the material you need.\n\nThat’s all a lot to go into in such a short blog post but don’t worry if you’re still confused or if your specific question hasn’t been answered. Like I said at the start, we at BIPC Glasgow are well used to answer questions on this subject. Just email us at business@glasgowlife.org.uk and we would be glad to help. You can also come along to our “Introduction to IP” webinar to find out more.\n\nKavan Stafford is Information Officer at BIPC Glasgow\n\nMeet the BIPC Information Officers\n\n25th September 2023\n\nInformation Officer Savannah McKibbin introduces the rest of the BIPC Team\n\nThis week we will look at the Information Officers with BIPC Glasgow.

The variety – no two days are alike in any way!\n\nNext week we will look at the Information Officers!\n\nSavannah McKibbin is Information Officer with the BIPC\n\nSlaying the Patent Dragon\n\n4th September 2023\n\nInformation Officer Kavan Stafford explains some of the intricancies of Patents.\n\nWe’ve all seen it. The business owner swaggers onto Dragon’s Den or The Shark Tank (other investment-based reality TV shows are available), product in hand. She answers the initial questions ably enough, but eventually one of the investors, it’s usually Deborah Meaden, asks the dreaded question:\n\n“What’s to stop me copying this product and under-cutting you?”\n\nBut the business owner is always ready:\n\n“I’ve applied for a patent.”\n\nFurther inspection, however, almost invariably reveals a problem. Most often, the patent doesn’t cover what the business owner thinks it does or, sometimes, it isn’t even a patent at all but is in fact, for example, a trademark or a registered design. But how do business owners get so mixed up when it comes to patents? And how can you avoid falling into the same traps? Read on to find out.\n\nWhat is a patent?\n\nA patent is, to put it simply, a form of intellectual property protection which protects inventions and new and inventive steps on previous inventions. In applying for a patent, you disclose exactly how your invention is created and this is made available on public databases. In return for this, you gain exclusive use of your invention for up to twenty years assuming you pay the appropriate fees. This is in contrast to trademarks, which protect your brand, and registered designs, which protect the aesthetic appearance of your product.\n\nWhere do people go wrong?\n\nPatents are tricky things, and people often don’t realise how complicated they can be. If we look at an example patent, GB2480573A, “A Media Player with Image-Based Browsing” owned by Apple, Inc, we can see that the documents supporting the patent are extensive, with many detailed drawings outlining how the invention works and how to replicate it. As you might imagine, producing such a document is a difficult and time-consuming task even for a company as large as Apple, and it is doubly so for an individual with a small business.\n\nThe result is that business owners produce documents which are not adequate to be accepted as patent applications or end up having a patent granted which does not cover the function of their product that they thought it did. Additionally, business owners can be confused by the whole process and end up thinking they are covered through applying for the (much cheaper) trademarks or registered designs, only to find that this IP protection, though useful when used correctly, does not protect their invention from being copied by someone else as trademarks only protect brands and registered designs cannot be used to protect the function of a product from being copied.\n\nWhat can I do to make sure my patent is successful?\n\nThe first thing to do to make sure that your patent is successful is to email BIPC Glasgow at business@glasgowlife.org.uk. This first step will ensure that you are armed with the information you need in order to make your patent application a success. We can help you understand how patents work, make sure they are the right option for you and walk you through the general application process and fees.\n\nYour next step is to get in touch with a patent attorney. Very few applications are successful without the assistance of a patent attorney and, of those which are, many are inadequate for the needs of the business. The fact is that the assistance of an IP legal professional is key to the success of your patent. Not only can they help you with the ins and outs of the application itself, but they can also help you with your product drawings and descriptions to ensure that the patent adequately covers every aspect of your invention.\n\nIP attorneys, like any other kind of legal aid, do not come cheap, but BIPC Glasgow can help with that too. We work closely with two IP firms, Murgitroyd and Lincoln IP, who offer free half hour sessions through BIPC Glasgow to give some initial advice to business owners considering applying for a patent. From there, you can make an informed decision as to the best course for you and your business.\n\nPatents are tricky, there’s no getting around that, but by working with us at BIPC Glasgow, you can make sure you are well prepared to show the Dragon’s Den investors of the world that you know what you’re talking about when it comes to protecting your product’s IP.\n\nFor advice on patents, trademarks and more, contact the BIPC Glasgow team at business@glasgowlife.org.uk, or call 0141 287 2904 to speak to a member of staff.

Clarke’s Space Odyssey series, to Ridley Scott’s Blade Runner replicants and the more recent killer doll M3GAN. This often dystopian view tends to show Artificial Intelligence developing self-awareness, inevitably leading to it seizing control of humans.\n\nRecently one of the ‘godfathers’ of AI, Professor Yoshua Bengia spoke out of his fears for the future stating “If they’re smarter than us, then it’s hard for us to stop these systems or to prevent damage”.[1] He urges caution and is fearful of a future where AI is controlled by people wishing harm on others.\n\nSome feel that rather than focus energy on Doomsday scenarios, we should concentrate on what might be seen as more mundane aspects of AI: misinformation on chatbots such as ChatGPT, inbuild AI bias, further societal inequalities, and questions about who owns the creations of AI.\n\nThe last is of particular interest to those of us working in the Business Information world. If an Artificial Intelligence creates a story, song or other creative works, who owns the copyright?\n\nHere in the UK, we protect work generated by a computer with the author defined as ‘the person by whom the arrangements necessary for the creation of works are undertaken’[2] The 2021 ‘National AI Strategy’[3] attempts to set out the framework for the UK.\n\nIn the USA, Spain and Germany, the decision has been made that copyright can only be owned by a human being. Ultimately creations are required to be ‘the author’s own intellectual creation’.\n\nThis was perfectly illustrated in the case of David Slater and the monkey selfies. These were a selection of photos taken on Slater’s camera in an Indonesian reserve by macaque monkeys who triggered the remote shutter. This began a series of legal disputes to determine whether an animal can own the copyright of its creation. Wikimedia Commons stated that an animal could not do so, and that the images were in the public domain.\n\nSelf-portrait by the depicted Macaca nigra female, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons\n\nSo, if a monkey can’t hold copyright, can an Artificial Intelligence? The illustrations in comic book ‘Zarya of Dawn’ were produced by Midjourney’s AI technology and as such were deemed unable to be protected by copyright by the US Copyright Office, leaving only the text protected.[4]\n\nThere is a danger that AI generators will steal creative works and generate cheaper copies or manipulations, taking business away from the creative industries.\n\nIn April 2023, a TikTok user cloned the voices of Drake and The Weeknd to create music which led the BPI to state that copyright protection should only be for music created by humans, joining the Human Artistry Campaign in fighting to ensure that performers’ voices and likenesses can only be used with their consent and that they should be recompensed for usage.\n\nAgain, in April 2023, Boris Eldagsen refused to accept his award in the creative open category at the Sony World Photography Award as he admitted his entry was created using AI, claiming that he wanted to discuss whether we consider AI generated images as photography and his actions were to ‘speed up this debate’ [5]\n\nSome say that the quality of AI generated work will inevitably be inferior to that of humans, meaning that human creative work will always be chosen over that of Artificial Intelligence, but if AI generated art is cheaper and more accessible, will that always be the case? Tom Hanks thinks that “people will be able to tell [that it’s AI], but the question is will they care?”.[6] Hanks understands that his voice and image could be manipulated in the future and that he could be ‘appearing’ in new movies well after his death.\n\nRules surrounding AI and Intellectual Property need to be established now as no matter whether you believe in utopia or dystopia, AI is going to become an ever more integral part of our society. We need to work out at what stage if any AI becomes capable of ‘intellectual creation’.\n\nKaryn Don is Business Librarian at the BIPC Glasgow\n\nA few of our Favourite Things\n\nAnniversaries are always a time for reflection and that’s never been truer than it is for the fifth anniversary of the BIPC network. That’s right, it’s been half a decade since BIPC Glasgow opened to the public on the first floor of the Mitchell Library and began our mission of helping small businesses across the greater Glasgow area get started with resources, one to one help and networking opportunities.\n\nYou may have noticed on the BIPC Glasgow Twitter for the past few weeks that we have been taking the opportunity to highlight some of our favourite things we have on offer, as well as some of the things we’ve been doing through the years. So, in a similar fashion, for this blog I thought I would highlight the five key aspects of BIPC Glasgow that I think makes us so special.\n\n1. The Staff\n\nYes, I’m going to start by blowing our own trumpet a little bit (but if you can’t do that on your anniversary, when can you?). The BIPC Glasgow Staff, Karyn, Alistair, Savannah and myself, are one of the things that makes our service what it is. We’re available six days a week to answer all your business questions, we are constantly upskilling and training to make sure we keep abreast of the latest developments to help you with your business. We are also IP experts, always ready to help you with queries about trademarks, copyright and more! We’re also very easy to speak to. To book a one-to-one with the team, all you have to do is email business@glasgowlife.org.uk and we would be happy to help.\n\n2. The Online Resources\n\nWe just wouldn’t be BIPC Glasgow without our online resources. From market research from MINTEL, to business basics with COBRA, we have something which can fit every business need. All of our resources are free to access, and our staff can give you expert help in finding the right resources for you, as well as making the best use of them when you do so. We can help you use our resources by email, through one-to-one meetings and, of course, through our fantastic workshops and webinars.\n\n3. The Experts in Residence\n\nOf course, we don’t do it all ourselves. One of the best things about the BIPC Glasgow is how much we work with businesses and public organisations all around the city. Some of these organisations and businesses help us by operating as our experts in residence. Experts in residence help to provide information and assistance to business of a more technical nature. Right now, we have Gilson Gray, our legal experts in residence, Paris and McNally, our accountants in residence, and Lincoln IP, our IP attorneys in residence. We also work closely with the Prince’s Trust. Sessions with all of these organisations can be booked through our Eventbrite page and, of course, they’re all free!\n\n4. The Book Collection\n\nIt should come as no surprise that, as a service based in one of the biggest libraries in Scotland, BIPC Glasgow boasts a huge book collection as part of our offering. We have books about entrepreneurialism, developing your business, marketing, and almost any other subject you can think of, and our collection is updated regularly. You’ll find most of these books on the first floor of the Mitchell Library at the BIPC area, but you can also access some from home through our eBook platforms, Libby and Borrowbox.\n\n5. The Events and Workshops\n\nOne thing we love to do at BIPC Glasgow is to put on events. Some of these we run ourselves, like our “How to…” series which teaches you how to use all our excellent resources, others we run alongside guest speakers like Barclays Eagle Labs, the Prince’s Trust and many more. As well as these, we of course have our fantastic networking events, including our coffee mornings. Our events are always free and always available to all, with a mix of online and in-person formats.\n\nOf course, these are only our favourite things so far. That’s the most exciting part about an anniversary – it’s not just about what came before, it’s also about what is to come – and 2023 looks set to be one of our biggest years yet. Remember, you can keep track of all of our events and projects on our Eventbrite page and on our website and, if you ever have any questions throughout the next five years of BIPC Glasgow, all you have to do is email us at business@glasgowlife.org.uk\n\nKavan Stafford is Information Officer at BIPC Glasgow\n\nHow to Create Your Business Model Canvas\n\n8th May 2023\n\nAlistair McCafferty, Information Officer, shows us how to create a Business Model Canvas to visually represent your business ideas\n\nSeeing the bigger picture is always important, especially when planning a business or testing an idea. Getting all the information you need on to one sheet of paper is a great way to see all your key points all at once. This can help keep you on track throughout your business planning and reaffirm the strategy needed to increase your chances of success.\n\nOne tool that help you with this is the Business Model Canvas (BMC). Created by Alex Osterwalder of Strategyzer, the BMC is made up of nine building blocks which cover three areas that a business model should think about: desirability, viability and feasibility. By filling out all these building blocks you’ll end up with a clear way to describe any business, from companies with thousands of employees, to a self-employed one person setup.\n\nValue proposition\n\nSo where to start? I think a good place is finding out where you create value and this can be done through the Value Proposition. Ask yourself the question, “what problems I am solving for my customers?” or “what needs are my business fulfilling?” In other words, what are the pains that I’m solving, or the gains that I’m adding for the customer. If you’re finding it diffiult to define here are some examples:\n\nMaking something completely new or disruptive that has never existed before\n\nCreating a product or service that already exists but with added performance\n\nA completely customisable offer taliored to the needs of individual customers\n\nCreating a brand that customers want to display and be associated with\n\nOffering similar value at a lower price, or even with free aspects\n\nMaking things more convenient or usable for your customers\n\nDesirability\n\nThe Value Proposition fits into the desirability section of the canvas. To complete this section you’ll also need to fill in all the blocks associated with your customers and how you interact with them, which together with your Value Proposition explores whether people want you have to offer.\n\nThe customer segments block looks at the different groups of people you aim to create value for. These may be mass market, other businesses, or based on different ages, behaviours, or needs. You’ll also need to fill in your customer relationships block, which describes the types of relationships you want to have with your segments. These could be personal, automated, transactional or long-term. Your channels look at how you communicate with your segments.\n\nFeasibility\n\nWhen you’ve worked at creating an offer that works for your customers you can ask yourself the next question, “can I deliver it?” To do this, start by looking at the key resource block which looks at the assets needed to operate your business. These could be physical such as premises, sales systems, or logistics, they could be based on intellectual property such as copyright and patents that you own or licence, or they could be human resources such as needing a skilled workforce.\n\nThese go alongside your key activities, which look at the actions needed for your business to run successfully. These could be production to manufacture goods, problem solving for the customer, or maintaining platforms such as your website or online networks. Together, your resources and activities allow to deliver your Value Proposition, maintain customer relationships, and make revenue.\n\nThe key partnership block looks at the suppliers and partners you need. These could be suppliers, alliances or joint ventures. Think about who you need to work for key reasons such as reducing costs, reducing risk, or outsourcing resources or skills from outside your business. Putting these three blocks together shows how feasible your business model is.\n\nViability\n\nTo work out if your business model is viable you can start by looking at the revenue streams block. There are lots of different ways to generate revenue such as selling assets, charging for usage, subscriptions, leasing, or even offering advertising.\n\nCreating your Value Proposition will incur costs, and the cost structure block records all the costs needed to operate your business model. These are usually associated with your feasibility section so these are easier to work out once you have that filled in. Once you have these blocks in place you’ll start to understand what your business is worth and you should have a completed BMC!\n\nWhat to do next?\n\nTo show you how easy is to do, here’s a BMC I’ve made to describe the BIPC Glasgow business model (see the picture above). Although the BMC is a simple tool to use you’ll want to make sure you capture everything accurately, so here are a few resources to go to if you’d like more information on this topic:\n\nStrategyzer Business Model Canvas building block guide\n\nOnline Business Model Canvas tool\n\nBIPC Glasgow 'Create Your Own Business Model Canvas' Session\n\nIf you’d like to arrange a one-to-one appointment with BIPC Glasgow staff outside our session time to can help signpost information and help you research all the building blocks then email business@glasgowlife.org.uk for more information. If you’d prefer to have a written guide then why no come and visit us in the Mitchell Library and browse through our Strategyzer book series which you can borrow with a free library membership.\n\nAlistair McCafferty-Bain is Information Officer at BIPC Glasgow\n\nPassion and the Side Hustle\n\nInformation Officer Savannah McKibbin introduces us to our newest workshop on The Side Hustle\n\nPassion is the making of a successful business. Passion and time. It is important to have passion, particularly if you already have a nine to five job. Passion = Success is one of the topics we discuss in our newest workshop ‘The Side Hustle: Making the Most Out of Your Hobbies’. The workshop is designed to help you understand what to consider when starting up a side business and is split into to four parts.\n\nThe first section discusses considerations, this looks at key things to think about before starting a business from the original idea to the day-to-day practicalities of setting up a side hustle.\n\nThe second section goes through the eResources that we have here at BIPC Glasgow with particular emphasis on the resource COBRA, which can be accessed anywhere with a Glasgow Library card.

COBRA can help you find out all about your chosen business and provides practical advice on how to set up and expand your business successfully.\n\nLooking at the most popular resources gives an insight into the type of information Glasgow Libraries users who make use of our service want to read. Business Information Factsheets (BIFs) are the most popular resources – they give all the information you might need about the industry you’re interested in, list any pros and cons, and give links to websites and other factsheets to help you on your way.\n\nThese are our top 10 titles from 2022-2023\n\nBIF004 Writing a Business Plan\n\nBIF006 Insurance Cover for Business\n\nBIF032 Choosing the Right Business Legal Structure\n\nBIF017 Legal Guide to Running a Business from Home\n\nBIF363 Setting up in Business as a Sole Trader\n\nBIF219 Registering a Trade Mark in the UK\n\nBIF157 Using the Copyright of Others\n\nBIF442 Support for Social Enterprise\n\nBIF098 Could You Run Your Own Business?\n\nBIF044 Developing a Marketing Plan\n\nThe most popular resources are those which help people decide how to set up their business and answer questions such as ‘How do I write my business plan?’, ‘What legal structure is the right one for me?’ and ‘How do I develop a marketing plan?’\n\nIntellectual Property questions such as ‘How do I register my Intellectual Property?’ and ‘How do I make sure I’m not using other people’s work?’ are also answered in this fantastic resource.\n\nAs well as BIFs, COBRA has lots of BOPs (Business Opportunity Profiles) covering such diverse industries such as Children’s Entertainer, Handbag Designer, Tiler and Guest Home Proprietor. The profiles outline the qualifications and skills needed, key market issues and trends, main trading issues and relevant legislation, and a guide to sources of further information.\n\nLooking through our most common searches gives an insight into the most popular BOPs and it’s all the C’s – café, consultant, cleaning and craft. In addition, beauty, food, dog walker, artist and restaurant are all popular too.\n\nSo, whichever question you might have about your business, you’re likely to find the answer somewhere in the COBRA resource.

You would think that’s an easy question to answer, but when your home is in a building as big as the Mitchell Library then we thought a walkthrough might be helpful in case it’s your first time visiting us. Plus it’s also an excuse to show off some interesting facts about the library and our brand new (and very comfy) furniture!\n\nEntering from North Street\n\nFirstly, let's make sure that everyone knows where the Mitchell Library is. It’s located in North Street, near Charing Cross station, and it has been here since 1911! You can enter the library through the door under the building’s most striking feature, the green copper dome. Fun fact, for a long time it was thought that the statue standing on top of the dome depicted Minerva, goddess of Wisdom, but from photographs held in the library’s Strong Room it was discovered that it was the statue of Literature by Thomas John Clapperton.\n\nOnce you’re inside the building, look up to admire the inside of the dome. Turn left and you’ll find yourself in the black and white corridor, aptly named because of its checkerboard appearance. Follow this corridor and turn the corner to the right, and then go straight ahead. Keep going through two sets of double doors and you’ve arrived! You’ll be greeted by a member of staff at the BIPC desk.\n\nEntering through Granville Street (Accessible)\n\nYou can also enter the library through a second entrance at Granville Street. This is our accessible entrance. If you see the distinctive sculptures on the façade (featuring Homer, Dante and Shakespeare no less) then you know you’re in the right place. Did you know, this façade was originally part of the St. Andrews Halls which once stood on the site? When you enter the building you’ll be on the ground floor of the new extension, and you’ll see an information desk straight ahead. Keep going past the information desk (on your right), and the steps to the theatre (on the left), and on past the café. You’ll notice the new extension features lots of glass and carpeted floors, a contrast from the green marble and wooden flooring of the older building.\n\nYou’ll arrive at the main staircase and lifts, and you can use either to make your way up to Level 1. Once you arrive at the Level 1 lobby you’ll get a great view over the café and information desk, but don’t get too distracted, you’re almost there! Stay on Level 1 and make your way along the walkway which gives another great view, this time over the Leisure & Lifestyle department.\n\nWelcome to the Business & Intellectual Property Centre!\n\nOnce you make it to the end of the walkway and turned right you’ve arrived at the Business & Intellectual Property Centre. Let’s go through all the different things you can do here:\n\nPick up and industry guide or COBRA start-up guide from our shelves\n\nBrowse our newest business books from the bookshelves or displays\n\nTake a seat and read one of our periodicals, or find a space for a one-to-one meeting\n\nHave a look at soft seating area perfect for group work or a BIPC Glasgow workshop\n\nBook on to one of our PCs and access our eResources\n\nOr simply find a desk, set up your laptop, and settle down to work.\n\nSo now you know how to find us, why not come in and see the Business & Intellectual Property Centre for yourself. Well worth the visit even if I do say so myself. To find out any other information about your visit such as opening hours take a look at the Mitchell Library FAQs.\n\nAlistair McCafferty-Bain is Information Officer at BIPC Glasgow"
