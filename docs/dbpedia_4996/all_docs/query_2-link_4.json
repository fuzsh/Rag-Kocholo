        "text": "In the last month I’ve written a couple of posts aimed at preparing first-time travelers to Scotland for a wonderful trip. I’ve tackled Scotland’s incredible right-to-roam policy and renting a car, and today I continue this so-called “Know Before You Go” series with another practical topic: Voltage, adapters, and things electrical. This is far from the sexiest thing to write about, but, since I can’t seem to travel without lugging around at least four devices, getting it wrong hurts.\n\nThere are two main areas you need to consider when ensuring your devices will work in other countries: Voltage and outlet adapters. Voltage is the “power” of the electricity coming through the outlet to devices. In most of the world (including Scotland), outlets are calibrated to 220v-240v. In the United States, however, our outlets are calibrated for 120v. The higher voltage in Scotland and other places is the result of a more modern electrical infrastructure that provides greater flexibility and nominally better energy efficiency. The United States’ more archaic system is simply the cost of being a pioneer.\n\nWhat does this mean for travelers? Every device that can be charged via outlets is built to accept a certain voltage range. You need to ensure that your device can handle the higher voltage in Scotland. For example, though it’s a bit hard to see, the iPhone plug below lists the input as 100-240v. This means you can plug it into Scottish outlets with just an adapter (see below). It does not require a voltage converter.\n\nVoltage converter? Some older devices and appliances like hair dryers and curling irons may only accept 120v. If you tried plugging those into Scottish outlets you’d risk frying the device. In this situation, you need an adapter AND a voltage converter (pictured below). The converter steps down the voltage to the lower American voltage of 110v/120v. These days, most devices like laptops, smartphones, surfaces, etc. do not require a voltage converter, and truthfully I can’t remember the last time I brought one on a trip. The key here is to check all your devices to see what voltages they accept. If any list only 110v/120v, then you need to bring a converter.\n\nAdapters are the other main concern. Outlet sockets in Scotland and the UK are different from the rest of the world. Everyone is different from everyone, really. As you can see in the pictures of UK adapters below, the adapters you need to use in Scotland have three massive, rectangular prongs spaced fairly far apart. The backsides of these adapters fit just about every other plug configuration on the planet. The number of adapters you want to bring depends on the number of devices you have, but trust me when I tell you that you don’t want to be fighting with your significant other for charging time. Just think of all the things you might need to charge: Laptop, phone, iPad, kindle, camera batteries, etc.\n\nImportant note: If you have any grounded, three-prong plugs, be sure to purchase an adapter that accepts three-pronged plugs. You can’t see it in the photo below, but the beige adapter accepts three-pronged plugs and the blue one does not. It seems obvious, but I made this mistake on a recent trip to Switzerland.\n\nIt’s as simple (and complicated) as that. To summarize:\n\nGather together the devices you intend to bring.\n\nCheck what voltages they accept.\n\nIf necessary, purchase a voltage converter (for those devices that only accept 110v/120v).\n\nPurchase UK outlet adapters for both grounded and non-grounded plugs.\n\nYou will now never be without sweet electricity on your trip to Scotland. Just don’t forget to flick on the switch on the outlet first! Questions? Throw them in the comments!"
