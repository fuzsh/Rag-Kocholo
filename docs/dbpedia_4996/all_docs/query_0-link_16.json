Perhaps away from the gaze of students, academics and teachers will also find the book a useful source of up-to-date information about contemporary journalism; as might working journalists in search of a more theoretical evaluation and explanation of their daily professional practice. Members of the broader reading public will also hopefully find something of interest here in the discussion of agony aunts, cartoons, Gonzo journalism, readers’ letters, spin doctors and media scrums. Written by experienced academics, journalists and teachers, the book identifies, analyzes and presents key concepts in journalism studies, explores their interconnections and offers recommendations for further reading and study. The book examines journalism across all media platforms embracing print, radio, television and online journalism. An initial question is obvious: how is this field of journalism studies to be understood? Others soon follow. What parameters define its limits? How does this fledgling discipline connect to the concerns of other arts and social science subjects such as media studies, sociology and linguistics? Browse through the alphabetical listing of concepts and page 128 delivers one answer to these questions and outlines the essential features of journalism studies. Contrary definitions of the field undoubtedly exist: so much the better. It is contested accounts rather than unwarranted certainty that prompt further reflection and intellectual development. Journalism studies is the multidisciplinary study of journalism as an arena of professional practice and a subject focus for intellectual and academic inquiry. More specifically, it entails the critical analysis of the various processes involved in gathering, evaluating, interpreting, researching, writing, editing, reporting and presenting information and comment on a wide range of subjects (including business, fashion, news, politics, sport and travel), that are disseminated via an expansive range of mass media (including the Internet, magazines, newspapers, radio and television) to diverse audiences (distinguished by culture, introduction\n\nJournalism Studies\n\nintroduction\n\nxv\n\nkey concepts\n\nKey Con Journalism\n\nxvi\n\n26/4/05\n\n1:14 pm\n\nPage xvi\n\nidentity and intellectual interests) resident in local, regional, national and international settings. Sources, of course, are invaluable to journalists and central to journalism studies; they are also important to students of journalism studies. Routinely or one-off, sources provide journalists with possible stories, exclusive insider information and authoritative quotations. Whistleblowers, leaks and spin-doctors’ press briefings have the added advantage that they come for free, but they bring their own dangers. The growth in chequebook journalism, moreover, means that journalists increasingly need to dip into their back pockets and expense accounts to access sources’ deep well of information. But sources’ real value for journalists depends on how they are used. Journalists need to reflect on the information which sources provide, assess its accuracy and relevance, interpret its meaning, adjudicate between contested and contradictory information delivered by different sources, consider the relationship between them and, finally, use a diverse range of sources to construct a balanced and even-handed argument or account of events. The same requirements should steer the use of this book by students of journalism, media and communication studies who are also reliant on sources. Open the book at the entry for Sources and that message is underscored. Sources are ‘the people, places and organizations that supply journalists with ideas and general information for news stories and features . . . Cuttings, archival material, broadcast recordings and a variety of documents and websites provide further useful sources of information.’ All these sources of information, data and documentation are available in Key Concepts in Journalism Studies. The health warnings posted in the same entry about journalists’ use of sources, apply with equal force to readers’ use of this book. Journalists, for example, risk their independence being ‘compromised by an overreliance’ on sources or their use of ‘a limited number of news sources’. Journalists’ reliance on significant and authoritative sources, moreover, may offer the latter too great an influence on ‘how stories are reported and debated’. The dangers of getting too close to sources should be as apparent to journalists as students of journalism studies. But readers of Key Concepts in Journalism Studies differ markedly from journalists concerning the ‘need to protect the identity of sources’. Journalists traditionally guarantee their sources absolute anonymity while the protocols of scholarly research and writing insist on openness and honesty in the use of academic sources. introduction\n\nKey Con Journalism\n\n26/4/05\n\n1:14 pm\n\nPage xvii\n\nintroduction\n\nJournalism Studies\n\nWhat connects the ways that readers should use the sources of information in this book with journalists’ use of sources of news is the simple observation that these ‘key concepts’, like journalists’ sources, are intended to provide the starting point, not the terminus, of any inquiry. Their purpose is not to serve as a surrogate for further reading or critical reflection: unattributed sources to be ‘glued’ together into an illconsidered and intellectually inadequate pastiche. Key Concepts is not a simple dictionary that delivers uncontested ‘meanings’ or a précis of complex ideas. On the contrary, each concept should trigger thoughtful reflection about its meaning, prompt readers to explore the cognate concepts and, where meanings and interpretations collide, to strive for and achieve some new synthesis and understanding. Like journalists, readers, who wish to maximise the benefit to be derived from the sources provided here, should consult the widest possible range of sources, follow the recommendations for further reading which accompany entries and use the extensive bibliography to explore more widely, but in closer detail, the literature of this field of scholarly inquiry. See how useful this book can be? The book has been clearly structured into two broad parts to facilitate readers’ access to information and source materials. Part I contains the substantive listing of key concepts in journalism studies, which is ordered alphabetically. Entries range from absence and agenda setting through to uses and gratifications and yellow journalism. Along the way censorship, discourse analysis, news values and tabloid journalism are discussed and analysed. Entries embrace consideration of both theoretical and practical concerns and, where appropriate, try to reconcile differences arising from this mix of theory and practice. The book makes explicit the interconnections between key concepts and highlights them by using bold type ‘hyperlinks’ across the alphabetically listed entries, but also seeks to whet readers’ appetites for further reading by providing extensive and explicit bibliographical guidance to a wide range of primary and secondary literature to facilitate further study. Articles in newspapers, academic journals, books and a range of online sources offer readers opportunities to follow up particular interests. We have tried to include every concept which is relevant and useful, but if we have missed anything, please write to us c/o Sage, and we will attempt to make good the omission in any subsequent edition. Part II offers a listing of journalism organizations and institutions selected according to two criteria: first, their significance to the structures and processes of journalism; second, the extent to which they illustrate\n\nxvii\n\nkey concepts\n\nKey Con Journalism\n\nxviii\n\n26/4/05\n\n1:14 pm\n\nPage xviii\n\nthe institutional form through which particular concepts find organizational expression in the UK or European setting. Consequently, the discussion of the key concept regulation in Part I finds a complementary and companion discussion in the entries in Part II on the Press Complaints Commission, Ofcom and the BBC Board of Governors. Concepts such as news management and agenda setting will similarly find institutional illustration through the entries concerned with the Government Information and Communication Service (GICS) and the Central Office of Information (COI). Organizations identified for inclusion range across a broad spectrum including regulatory bodies (Ofcom), press agencies (Reuters), trade unions (National Union of Journalists, NUJ), journalists’ professional organizations (Women in Journalism), government news management organizations (the Government News Network, GNN) and journalism educational organizations (Broadcast Journalism Training Council, BJTC). Towards the end of the book, there is a glossary listing key technical terms and phrases commonly used in print, broadcast and online journalism. Entries here include actuality, copy taster, corpsing, freelance and piece to camera. The book also explores the complex relationship between journalism studies and the connected disciplines of media, communication and cultural studies, seeking to resolve boundary disputes where they break out. The various entries also indicate the multidisciplinary character of journalism studies and the degree to which it builds on the traditional social science and humanities disciplines of sociology, politics, economics, history, psychology, literature and linguistics. Key Concepts in Journalism Studies illustrates the plurality and range of theoretical frameworks which deliver explanatory accounts of structures and processes in journalism studies, as well as identifying the characteristic methodological approaches which inform the knowledge base of the discipline and steer further research inquiries. It also introduces readers to the significant debates within the discipline, by outlining the arguments and positions of key protagonists and by offering summaries and evaluations of academics’ and journalists’ critical assessments of recent developments in journalism studies. Finally, Key Concepts in Journalism Studies outlines the impact of recent policy developments on the organizational structures, financial arrangements and regulatory environment of the media within which journalism is conducted as well as their consequences for journalism products. These are giddy ambitions. We hope we have achieved some of them. introduction\n\nKey Con Journalism\n\n26/4/05\n\n1:14 pm\n\nPage xix\n\nBob Franklin Martin Hamer Mark Hanna Marie Kinsey John E.

We have tried to provide a useful but critical source of information and ideas about journalism studies. Use it wisely. To get the best from the book, readers, like journalists, must approach this source with appropriate scepticism, an open mind, a genuine spirit of inquiry and a desire to learn. Return to the entry on Sources on p. 248. Remember always to avoid the dangers involved in getting too close to a source or becoming overly reliant on a single source. But also remember that sources provide an extremely valuable fund of ideas, information and authoritative quotations. Significantly, they provide the starting point for an inquiry, but it is for the reader to evaluate, compare and reflect on the information and ideas delivered by multiple sources to arrive eventually at the terminus of that inquiry.

In fact, textual meaning is communicated as much by absence as by presence; as much by what is ‘missing’ or excluded, as by what is remembered and present. Though it’s perhaps slightly ironic to start this glossary with such an entry, it is important (although rather difficult) to consider what/where/who is not included, as well as what/where/who is included, in reporting. Absence can occur in two inter-related ways: first, absence of content, by which an individual, group, idea, etc. is totally excluded from a report, leaving no reference or discernible trace. Van Leeuwen (1996) refers to this as suppression and its importance to the study of journalism is clear: under current reporting practices, access to the news is a power resource in itself and the frequency of inclusion provides us with an index of social power. Second, absence of form or expression, wherein an individual (or group, or idea, etc.) is not explicitly named or referred to, but their presence may nevertheless still be inferred. This absence in expression can occur through presupposition, through euphemism, or by a syntactic transformation (see transitivity) such as active agent deletion. The work of critical linguists (Fowler et al., 1979; Kress, 1994) argues that while certain syntactic structures play an important role in the ideological (re)construction of social reality, they are ignored by content analysis since their importance lies in textual absence. JER\n\nAccessibility Businesses and organizations in many countries are legally obliged to ensure that their services can be accessed by everybody, including disabled people.

The inventor of the world wide web, Tim Berners-Lee, insists: ‘The power of the Web is in its universality. Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect’ (World Wide Web Consortium, 2004). He says this is ‘irrespective of hardware or software platform, network infrastructure, language, culture, geographical location, or physical or mental impairment’ (Schofield, 2003). Certain design and content features can help to make websites globally available to anyone regardless of ability or disability. To be more accessible, for example, website designs can accommodate the use of tools such as screen readers, which read text to blind users, and be navigable with only a keyboard, allowing people with restricted movement to navigate via hypertext links using the tab key rather than a mouse. The degree of accessibility, which is closely related to website usability, depends on many factors including, for example, whether descriptive and meaningful alternative (alt) text tags are used for graphical elements like images and navigation buttons (Royal National Institute of the Blind, www.rnib.org.uk). The alt text appears when the cursor moves across an image, etc, allowing it to be read out by the screen reader. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), of which Berners-Lee is a director, has laid down universal standards in its Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) which has published the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (World Wide Web Consortium, 2004). The WAI, working with organizations around the world, pursues web accessibility through five main areas of work: technology, guidelines, tools, education and outreach, and research and development. The EuroAccessibility Consortium is one such organization (EuroAccessibility Consortium, 2004). Further reading Schofield J.

Accountability\n\nKey Con Journalism\n\n26/4/05\n\n1:14 pm\n\nPage 5\n\nAccountability\n\nJournalism Studies\n\nThey are accountable to the law courts, for example, if they libel someone or commit contempt of court. In Britain, the Office of Communications (Ofcom) has responsibility for the statutory regulation of the broadcast sector. Its scope includes programme quality and ethics. Journalists in the BBC, a public service broadcaster, are accountable to the BBC Board of Governors. The BBC itself is accountable, in some respects, to Ofcom and ultimately, despite structural safeguards to protect its day-to-day independence, to the British Government under the terms of the BBC Agreement. The British Press (the newspaper and magazine section) is not accountable to any statutory regulator (except in the field of competition, i.e. proposed takeovers or mergers of newspaper companies). In ethical matters, the press is governed by self-regulation, administered by the Press Complaints Commission, which holds editors accountable by means of its ability to ensure critical adjudications are published. Media organizations stress that they are also held accountable by their audiences (and advertisers). Readers, viewers or listeners can be lost if there is adverse public reaction to particular conduct or content. Various factors usually stop consumer action being effective (Gibbons, 1998: 46–54). However, in 1989 the Sun lost thousands of Merseyside readers outraged because of inaccurate coverage of the Hillsborough football stadium disaster (Chippindale and Horrie, 1992: 276–93). In recent years some British newspapers have each appointed a senior executive to be the ‘readers’ editors’ or ‘an ombudsman’, to bolster their accountability to readers or anyone else aggrieved by particular coverage, with such executives having power to publish corrections and adjudications (Sanders 2003: 155–8). The term ‘media accountability systems’ has been coined to describe the variety of means and methods – including press councils, ombudsmen, training in ethics, readership surveys – which can encourage ethical conduct in the media (Bertrand 2000, 2003). Critics of the British media – for example, the Campaign for Press and Broadcasting Freedom and MediaWise – argue that the huge expense of libel and privacy litigation, weaknesses in the regulatory and self-regulatory systems, the market dominance of a concentrated number of powerful media corporations, and the reluctance of successive governments to attempt radical reform in these fields, mean that journalists are not sufficiently accountable to the public. With rare exceptions (e.g. the BBC, which is a purely public service broadcaster, and the Guardian and Observer newspapers, which are owned by a trust), media corporations are also accountable, structurally,\n\n5\n\nkey concepts\n\nKey Con Journalism\n\n6\n\n26/4/05\n\n1:14 pm\n\nPage 6\n\nto their shareholders to make good profits.

MNH\n\nAccuracy Irrespective of the extent to which any piece of journalism can be held to exhibit objectivity, or otherwise pay heed to the wider contexts in which news occurs, it can be judged at a basic level on matters of accuracy. At this level, the term accuracy means, for example, that the names of those featured in the piece are spelt correctly, that quotes are reproduced in direct form, or in précis which preserves their meaning, and that events are clearly related. The term encompasses the ethical principle that a news journalist should take all reasonable steps to corroborate any version of events likely to be disputed, if he/she has not witnessed those events, and indicate, in what is published, any such dispute. If the public interest merits it, the airing of uncorroborated facts is ethically justifiable, but the lack of corroboration must be made explicit. The term ‘accuracy’, if used in isolation, is of limited value. Journalism usually involves summarizing events or arguments. Good journalism exhibits fairness in the summary. British law, when conferring ‘privilege’, i.e. protection against defamation lawsuits, on certain types of media reports – for example, coverage of court cases, council meetings or Parliamentary proceedings – specifies such protection will only exist if the reports are accurate and fair (Welsh and Greenwood, 2003: 259–72). The statutory regulation of broadcasting in Britain requires, under the terms of licences to be awarded by Ofcom, and those awarded by predecessor bodies, that news be presented ‘with due accuracy’, fairness and impartiality, and this requirement is reflected in codes of ethics, issued by those bodies, and in the BBC’s Producers’ Guidelines. Clause 1 of the Code of Practice used by the Press Complaints Commission concerns accuracy, fairness and the need for prompt corrections. The majority of complaints ruled on by the PCC – e.g. 53 per cent of its rulings in 2003 – concern alleged breaches of Clause 1.

But there was also increased soul-searching about ethics. Some commentators began to warn that reporters who were overlyhostile to and cynical about politicians, public institutions and business risked alienating the public from journalists, or could erode public faith in democracy. In 1982 Michael J. O’Neill, then editor of the New York Daily News, condemned the increase in ‘adversarial mindset’ among journalists. Despite these concerns, research suggests only a small minority of American journalists consider they have an adversarial mindset (Weaver and Wilhoit, 1996: 134–5, 139–40). A survey in the 1990s suggested that, compared to their US counterparts, British journalists are more likely to declare an adversarial scepticism of the pronouncements of public officials and businesses. This is a reflection, perhaps, of the tougher legal environment, in terms of defamation and the culture of official secrecy, in which British journalists operate (Henningham and Delano, 1998: 153). The terms ‘adversarial’ and ‘hyperadversarial’ have also been used, negatively, in Britain and America to describe journalistic interviewing techniques deemed aggressive and dramatic which, though they may help inflate the interviewer’s ego, are essentially ritualistic, and superficial in terms of helping the public consider social issues (Keeble 2001: 4 and 6). Adversarial journalism is sometimes compared unfavourably with public journalism or civic journalism. Further reading Fallows (1997) Breaking the News: How the Media Undermine American Democracy.

They provide a large part of the income of these media and, in the case of newspapers and magazines, offset the purchase cost for the consumer. Tabloid newspapers receive approximately 30 per cent of their income from advertising while for broadsheets it rises to 70 per cent (Baistow, 1985: 33). The figures for local daily (60 per cent ) and weekly newspapers (80 per cent) are similarly high while local free newspapers are wholly reliant on advertising revenues for their income (Franklin, 2005). Levels of advertising expenditure in UK media are considerable and expansive. In 2002, advertising revenues for UK media totalled £13,666 million. Television digested the largest portion (26 per cent or £3553 million) of the advertising cake with local and regional newspapers in second place with 21 per cent (£2870 million) of aggregate advertising income. National newspapers (14 per cent or £1913 million), magazines (13 per cent or £1776 million), radio (4 per cent or £546 million), cinema (1 per cent or £136 million), and the Internet (1 per cent or £136 million) displayed varying degrees of reliance on advertising revenues to fund their activities (ibid.). Different media sectors face highly variable prospects with national press advertising revenues declining by 14.5 per cent between 2000 and 2002 while local newspaper revenues expanded by 3.9 per cent across the same period. In the USA levels of advertising income are predictably higher with television ($47 billion) leading newspapers ($43 billion), magazines ($15 billion) and radio ($13 billion) (Applegate, 2000: 285–6). Competition for these considerable advertising revenues is fierce and newspapers’ reliance on advertising impacts significantly on all aspects of their production and distribution. Free local newspapers simply would not exist without it. The expansion of colour supplements in Sunday newspapers in the 1970s, the development of supplements in the Saturday broadsheets in the 1990s, the expansion of pagination and the variability of pagination across the news week, along with the growth in financial sections in the 1990s each reflect the impact of advertising revenues (Franklin, 1997: 93–4). The most controversial aspect of the relationship between advertisers and newspapers is the suggestion that advertisers might influence editorial content. Although McGregor’s Press Commission argued for little advertiser influence on the press, academics like James Curran have demurred, Advertising\n\nKey Con Journalism\n\n26/4/05\n\n1:14 pm\n\nPage 9\n\nFurther reading Applegate, E.

Advertisers exert pressure on journalists, although quantifying how often this happens is difficult. The issue is seldom aired in the UK. But some advertisers, when lobbying for favourable publicity in news coverage, remind journalists of past and potential advertising patronage. Threats to withdraw advertising are made in efforts to suppress unfavourable coverage. At UK national newspaper and broadcast network level, such pressure – although it does occur (see Willcock, 1999; Robertson and Nicol, 2002: 640) – should be easily resisted because of the dominant market position of these media. Advertiser threats are more likely to be effective when made to the local/regional media. But advertiser influence is typically subtle. A publication’s news agenda is influenced by its need to target a particular audience for advertisers. A relationship between a niche publisher and advertisers can be so financially symbiotic that self-censorship is likely to dilute journalistic principles; fashion magazines, for example, are unlikely to campaign vigorously against the high prices of top brand perfumes. But if a media organization is too readily supine to advertisers in editorial matters, it risks compromising its credibility with its audience. In America, research reveals that most journalists did not perceive advertiser pressure as a major problem (Pew Research Center, 1999) although varying degrees of self-censorship were admitted (Pew Research Center, 2000). Advertiser pressure is usually inimical to good journalism, but not always. The sacking of Mike Gabbert as editor of the Daily Star in 1987 was attributed, at least in part, to British supermarket chains withdrawing their advertising after he plumbed new depths of salaciousness in the tabloid’s news agenda (Chippindale and Horrie, 1992: 226–7). Advertising may, moreover, be seen historically as the bulwark of the free press, freeing it from economic dependence on the state, though this view is open to challenge (Curran and Seaton, 1997). Alternative media campaigning against multinational companies, of course, do not expect to receive advertising revenues from such sources.\n\n9\n\nkey concepts\n\nKey Con Journalism\n\n10\n\n26/4/05\n\n1:14 pm\n\nPage 10\n\nFranklin, B.

BF and MNH\n\nAdvertising codes The largely self-regulatory system, used by the mass media industries, to ensure that any advertising they include is ‘legal, decent, honest and truthful’ (Radio Authority www.radworth.org.uk: 7). There are four main codes which offer guidelines on advertising practice: the British Codes of Advertising, Sales Promotion and Direct Marketing (the CAP Code) covering non-broadcast advertising such as the press; the ITC Advertising Standards Code, covering television advertising; the Radio Authority Advertising and Sponsorship Code, covering radio advertising; and the Direct Marketing Association Code of Practice, covering direct marketing.Although the Radio Authority and the ITC have now been superseded by the Office of Communications (Ofcom), the RA and ITC Codes remain in operation. With all broadcast media, it is the responsibility of the broadcasters to ensure the advertising they transmit complies with both the spirit and the letter of the relevant Code – although broadcasters are entitled to request copy clearance for specific adverts from the Broadcast Advertising Clearance Centre (BACC) or the Radio Advertising Clearance Centre (RACC). Fundamentally, the Codes demand ‘There must be a clear distinction between programmes and advertisements’ (ITC, www.ofcom.org.uk/codes: 12). Therefore, advertising must not ‘use a situation, performance or style reminiscent of a programme in a way that might confuse viewers as to whether they are watching a programme or an advertisement’ (ibid.). Further, the Codes contain detailed and specific guidance, including the products and services which it is unacceptable to advertise (for example, tobacco, pornography and ‘bodies with political objectives’), misleading advertising (for example, on the use of the word ‘free’ or ‘environmentally friendly’) and avoiding offence and harm, particularly to children.

More specifically, it is a paid advertisement masquerading as editorial which risks misleading readers into the belief that they are reading a straight news story or feature rather than an advertisement (Franklin and Murphy, 1998: 13, 245–7). For the company or individual buying the advertising space, the advertorial has the advantage of conferring the authority and truth claims associated with news on the advertisement. For the newspaper selling the space, advertorial allows the editor to allocate a greater part of the paper to advertising copy which typically generates up to half the newspaper’s revenues (for free local newspapers which are wholly reliant on advertising, advertorial assumes an even greater economic significance). Advertorials have become increasingly popular in the past two decades (Eckman and Lindlof 2003: 66) with one study revealing that advertorial revenues in USA print media doubled in the second half of the 1980s to more than an estimated US$200 million in annual profits (Cameron et al. 1996). In summary, advertorial reflects ‘the rising pressure to find new ways of getting cash from advertisers’ but significantly and worryingly, ‘the once sacred split between editorial and advertising is now being sewn together’ (Smallman, 1996: 11). Advertorial is evident in both the local and national press: in both settings, the format of these advertising features is highly stylized. In a local newspaper, for example, advertorial may feature a local business which is perhaps celebrating a centenary or opening new premises. A formulaic article applauds the company’s achievements (typically in rather glowing terms) while the newspaper, on the strength of the article, solicits further advertising, usually in the form of good wishes messages, from the company’s major suppliers and Advertorial\n\nJournalism Studies\n\nCompliance with broadcast Codes is now enforced by Ofcom, though day-to-day responsibility for regulating broadcast advertising content is, since November 2004, overseen by the Advertising Standards Agency (ASA).

BF\n\nAgenda setting 12\n\nThe basic premise of agenda-setting theory is that the way in which news media report particular issues influences and helps to shape public awareness and debate (McCombs and Shaw, 1972). In much the same way that a committee agenda ranks items to reflect their significance, with the least consequential matters receiving only scant attention or not being discussed at all, media agendas reflect a process of selection (prioritizing) with certain issues enjoying sustained and prominent coverage in news reports while others are relatively marginalized or ignored (Weaver et al., 1981; McCombs et al., 1997). In this sense, agenda-setting theory has clear affinities with news framing and media effects. But in agenda setting, the influence claimed for the media is less certain than in some theorizing of media effects and eschews implications of propaganda. In a classic formulation of agenda setting, the suggestion is that while the media do not tell us what to think, they may tell us what to think about. Agenda setting, however, does not posit a simple uni-directional model in which news media set the priorities for public debate, but suggests that typically a number of contesting agendas vie for prominence. Extensive research on agenda setting during election periods, for example, has illustrated the distinctive agendas which politicians and journalists bring Agenda setting\n\nKey Con Journalism\n\n26/4/05\n\n1:14 pm\n\nPage 13\n\nFurther reading Blumler, J.

The agony aunt and her male equivalent, the agony uncle, are a mainstay of newspapers, magazines, radio and television and there are thousands on the Internet. Their trenchant advice to the lovelorn and generally wretched on emotional, sexual and health problems, as well as much else has poured out in the past 50 years or so. Advice columns have been around since the 1930s, but the term itself did not gain currency until the 1970s, with the first citation in the Oxford English Dictionary in 1975. One of the best-known columns, Ann Landers, was in the Chicago Sun-Times. According to her obituary in the Chicago Tribune, ‘Dear Ann’ began running in the early 1950s and by 1993 was appearing in 1,200 newspapers around the world with an estimated 90 million readers. But the relatively tame columns of the 1950s and 1960s gave way to a new breed of agony aunt with the launch of a new wave of womens’ magazines such as Cosmopolitan. These columns pulled few punches in the way they dealt with stories of sexual angst and emotional dysfunction. In Britain the doyenne of agony aunts was Marje Proops, who wrote a column in the Daily Mirror and died in 1996.

MK\n\nAlternative media This blanket term is used to describe various forms of publication, containing news, general information and features, which are not produced or distributed by the mainstream, corporate media organizations, but by individuals, or by small, non-hierarchical collectives. These seek not profit but to represent particular interest groups – e.g. community or subcultural or political – who feel their ideas, concerns and viewpoints are neglected, marginalized or suppressed by the institutionalized news agendas of professional journalists in the mainstream. Thus, the term ‘alternative’ can be used of the community-based, investigative newsletters published in British cities in the 1970s to challenge local politicians and expose corruption; pioneering magazines written by feminists, e.g. Spare Rib and/or gay rights activists; the music ‘fanzines’ which flowered with punk rock; the irreverent, grass-root soccer fanzines which scrutinize British professional football clubs; SchNEWS, the ‘direct action’ collective embracing a wide range of protest and campaign causes, including ecological, anti-racist and anti-globalisation groups, which has a website but also distributes news on A4 paper and by email (see http://www.schnews.co.uk) Chris Atton, in his ‘typology of alternative and radical media’, lists several elements including ‘politically radical, socially/culturally radical content’; de-professionalization of journalism and printing, e.g. use of voluntary labour and photocopiers to achieve cheap production; transformed roles and responsibilities, e.g. readers are encouraged to become writers; and horizontal networks of research and distribution, rather than the vertical ‘top-down’ processes of the mainstream media (2002b: 27). He takes issue with John Fiske’s assertion that much of the alternative media ‘circulates among a fraction of the same educated middle classes as does official news’ (ibid.: 13).

But the grass-root nature of their experiences and contacts, their specialized pool of knowledge and unconventional ‘take’ on the world mean those involved in alternative media sometimes uncover scandals or raise broad issues subsequently pursued by mainstream media. The Internet has greatly aided alternative publishers to reach audiences cheaply.\n\nMNH\n\nAmbient news A phrase used by Ian Hargreaves in his book Journalism: Truth or Dare? to signal that the availability of relatively cheap digital technology, combined with the growing economic, political and cultural value of information, have made news more accessible to audiences, to the point where it is omnipresent or ‘ambient’ (Hargreaves, 2003: 3). Audiences’ greatly enhanced access to news reflects: (1) the increased number of media platforms, especially the development of the Internet; (2) access to approximately 250 digital radio and television channels with the consequent increase in news provision; (3) the greater range of news and depth of journalistic analysis offered by the Internet and online newspapers; (4) the availability of news for 24 hours each day instead of being limited to the set times of the evening television news bulletins or the publishing schedules of newspapers; and (5) the relatively cheap cost – and widespread use – of information technologies such as personal computers and mobile phones. Ambient news\n\n15\n\nkey concepts\n\nKey Con Journalism\n\n26/4/05\n\n1:14 pm\n\nPage 16\n\nThe cumulative consequence of these changes is ‘the age of ambient news’ where the prevalent assumption is that ‘news is something available free of charge and even free of effort’ (Hargreaves and Thomas, 2002: 5). ‘News which was once difficult and expensive to obtain,’ Hargreaves argues, ‘today surrounds us like the air we breathe. Much of it is literally ambient: displayed on computers, public billboards, trains, aircraft and mobile phones’ (2003: 3). But, paradoxically, because so much news is available, people are not always able to discriminate between the good and the bad. The perception that news is ‘free’, moreover, means that audiences tend to value it less and certain forms of costly, resource intensive journalism may be undermined. While ‘we have more news and more influential journalism . . . than at any time since the birth of the free press in the eighteenth century . . . journalism is also under widespread attack from politicians, philosophers, the general public and even from journalists themselves’ (ibid.: 2).\n\nFurther reading Hargreaves, I.

We Were Hoaxed’ on 15 May 2004 the Daily Mirror joined a select group of publications to make a front page apology. And it lost an editor in the process. Two weeks previously, the paper had printed photographs it claimed showed British soldiers abusing prisoners in Iraq. The front page of that Saturday edition admitted they were fakes. ‘So to you today we apologise for publishing pictures which we now believe were not genuine.’ Apologies feature in both press and broadcasting codes of practice but there’s nothing in either that directs offenders on when an apology should be given. Much, however, is said about how quickly something should be corrected. And printing or broadcasting a correction doesn’t necessarily go hand in hand with an apology. Increasingly newspapers are appointing readers’ editors who are responsible for ensuring that mistakes are corrected quickly, and they’re sometimes brought together in a particular section of the paper. In the case of broadcasters, the regulator Ofcom has the power to direct broadcasters to publish a correction, or all of its adjudication in cases where Apologies\n\nKey Con Journalism\n\n26/4/05\n\n1:14 pm\n\nPage 17\n\nMK\n\nApril fool Putting a fake story in newspapers and broadcast news on 1 April each year has a long and honourable history. According to a 2002 study of such hoaxes by Alex Boese, a 1957 spoof by the respected BBC news programme Panorama tops the list of all-time greats. With his characteristic genial gravitas, presenter Richard Dimbleby reported that thanks to a mild winter and the virtual elimination of the dreaded spaghetti weevil, Swiss farmers were enjoying a bumper spaghetti crop. Hundreds of viewers rang in asking how to grow the trees and were advised ‘place a sprig of spaghetti in a tin of tomato sauce and hope for the best’ (BBC, 2002). In fact, cameraman Charles de Jaeger, while working on another story, had draped 20 pounds of cooked spaghetti on a cluster of laurel bushes and then filmed the locals apparently ‘harvesting’ them. Even the BBC’s then director general Sir Ian Jacob admitted he’d consulted three different reference books before being reassured it was a hoax (Lindley, 2002: 50). The Guardian is credited with firing the enthusiasm of the newspapers for April Foolery with its 1977 seven-page supplement marking the tenth anniversary of San Seriffe, a small republic located in the Indian Ocean made up of several semi-colon-shaped islands. Articles described its geography and culture; how its two main islands were called Upper Caisse and Lower Caisse, its leader was General Pica and the capital Bodoni.

It can also direct the broadcast of an apology, as it did with Central Television over the reconstruction in the documentary The Connection (1996). Its radio code says apologies should be broadcast ‘where appropriate’. Clause 1 of the Press Complaints Commission Code of Practice asks for prompt corrections and an apology if appropriate when it is recognized that ‘a significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or distorted report has been published’. It asks that such corrections are given ‘due prominence’. As in the case of the Mirror, sometimes they are. The decision to apologize is never taken lightly, particularly if libel either has been or could be involved. They are carefully worded, finely crafted and stick in editors’ throats.\n\n17\n\nkey concepts\n\nKey Con Journalism\n\n18\n\n26/4/05\n\n1:14 pm\n\nPage 18\n\n1985), the Japanese marathon runner who thought he had to run for 26 days not 26 miles (Daily Mail, 1981), smellovision (BBC, 1965), changing the value of pi (New Mexicans for Science and Reason, 1998) and the man who flew by his own lung power (Berliner Illustrierte Zeitung, 1934).

MK\n\nAudience At bottom there is an assumption by most journalists that news is for people, that out there are readers, viewers and listeners. Editors, circulation managers and advertisers care greatly about the number of people who buy a publication, listen or watch at particular times. They also care about whether they’re reaching the target audience and worry greatly about audience fragmentation and audience segmentation. Audience measurement has become more sophisticated in the past 20 years. Not only are numbers gathered by the Audit Bureau of Circulations (for newspapers and magazines), BARB (for television) and RAJAR (for radio), but surveys and focus groups also generate information on the profile of the audience; their age, their interests, their habits. Measurement systems carefully define words such as ‘listener’, ‘viewer’ and ‘reader’ (Kent, 1994). The relationship between journalists and their audience has been described in several different ways with many writers (Gans, 1980; Schlesinger, 1987; Harrison, 2000) observing that at grass-roots level journalists have little knowledge of their audience and may not even be very interested. Harrison (2000: 116) notes that when asked about audience, individual television journalists didn’t respond with numbers, but with a more ‘organic and emotional’ view, referring to types of people. Allan (1999: 109–10) makes the same point about newspaper journalists and also that audience feedback seems to have little impact as it is deemed to come from cranks. But he also suggests that the appointment of readers’ editors, or Ombudsmen, is developing the relationship between the news providers and the news consumers. The growing awareness of who is listening, watching or reading has meant a more sophisticated visualization of Mr, Mrs or Ms Audience\n\nKey Con Journalism\n\n26/4/05\n\n1:14 pm\n\nPage 19\n\nFurther reading Allan, S.

This has led to newsrooms trying to make their news service more distinctive by running the types of stories they think the audience want. Journalists, however, are acutely aware that they ignore their audience at their peril, as the Sun found to its cost on 19 April 1989. Under the banner headline ‘The Truth’ the paper reported that anonymous police officers were accusing Liverpool football fans of ‘robbing the dead and attacking rescue workers’ during the Hillsborough disaster, in which 95 Liverpool fans died. Chippendale and Horrie (1992) described how all over the city copies of the paper were ripped up, banned in pubs and from newsagents. Sales crashed by a third. And memories are long. Fifteen years later, on 9 July 2004, Merseysiders were outraged when former Everton footballer Wayne Rooney sold his story to the Sun and the paper tried to apologize for its previous story.\n\nMK\n\nAudience fragmentation The division of the available audience between ever increasing numbers of media options. Faced with more and more choices, the audience has a tendency to disperse among the different media options, leaving each option with a smaller share of the audience. And, since the amount that advertisers are willing to pay is directly linked to audience share, the fragmentation of audiences has a knock-on effect, reducing revenue and resources. Audience fragmentation has not affected all news media equally. Television is particularly affected, with hundreds of channels, in many different languages, now available via satellite, digital and cable in addition to domestic analogue transmission. In contrast, the share of the readers is relatively stable across and between newspaper titles, due in part to the costs inherent in launching and establishing a new paper and in part to the bounded distribution of specific titles. This stability has led John Audience fragmentation\n\n19\n\nkey concepts\n\nKey Con Journalism\n\n26/4/05\n\n1:14 pm\n\nPage 20\n\nHonderich, the publisher of the Toronto Star, to claim ‘more and more, newspapers are becoming the sole mass medium, particularly for advertising’ (www.mediainfo.com). Drawing these two points together, the worry is that greater fragmentation of the television audience will adversely affect programme quality. Simply put, advertisers will not subsidize a channel without an audience. This pushes broadcasters towards either increasing light, entertaining programmes at the expense of more weighty (and expensive) documentaries, or towards attracting a wealthy audience segment at the expense of poorer viewers. But not everyone offers such a pessimistic evaluation. Indeed, Janeway (2000) claims that ‘audience fragmentation also means, for those prepared to think about it, a new niche, however modest in size, for quality, for seriousness of purpose’. Early reports suggest that the greater corporatization of news media, particularly in the USA, has pushed audiences towards ‘alternative’ news providers on the Internet, such as Common Dreams, Democracy Now, FAIR and Z-Net (Hightower, 2004). JER\n\nAudience segmentation 20\n\nThis is the more worrying corollary of audience fragmentation. While audience fragmentation occurs ‘bottom-up’ as a result of increased choice between media options, audience segmentation occurs ‘top-down’ when media producers attempt to corral a target audience (defined by age, gender, ethnicity, class or some other group characteristic) in order to attract advertising revenue. Of course, advertisers are not interested in the size of an audience per se, nor in the share (or ‘fragment’) of the total audience that a newspaper or television station attracts. Certain products only sell to certain segments of the population and hence only need to be advertised to these segments: BMW cars need only be advertised to the rich, while dodgy loan companies need only be advertised to the poor. News organizations that conform to the ‘marketing requirements of advertisers’, producing news that can be shown to attract (or generate) a desired target audience, obtain large external subsidies which they ‘can then spend on increased editorial outlay and promotion in order to attract new readers’ (Curran and Seaton 1997: 37). Schement (1998: 93) argues that ‘in the calculus of modern media, ethnicity has emerged as a potent determinant for organising media Audience segmentation\n\nKey Con Journalism\n\n26/4/05\n\n1:14 pm\n\nPage 21\n\nFurther reading Gandy, O.

JER\n\nBad News This was the title of the first book, in a pioneering series of books, produced by the Glasgow Media Group which explored the way in which television journalists reported contemporary industrial relations (GMG, 1976). The Bad News studies (Bad News, 1976; More Bad News, 1980; Really Bad News, 1982; War and Peace News, 1985; and Bad News from Israel, 2004) rejected the ‘common-sense’ view that television news coverage of the economy, industrial relations and war was balanced or neutral, arguing that news was simply an artifice which systematically articulated a partial viewpoint reflecting the special status and credibility afforded to certain sectional interests (Eldridge, 2000: 114). The Bad News series, which aimed ‘to examine how news bulletins were organised and constructed in general’ as well as ‘in particular . . . what it meant in practice to treat a controversial matter [industrial relations] in a way that claimed to be impartial’ (Eldridge, 2000: 116), suffered a hostile reception from news organizations such as ITN (which funded Martin Harrison’s alternative study Whose Bias? (1985)) and the BBC (Hoggart, 1993: 258). The Bad News research was unprecedented in scope, analyzing all television news content for five months: its conclusions were highly Bad News\n\nJournalism Studies\n\nsegments’. In every Western country, without exception, Black communities are significantly over-represented in the impoverished and ill-educated social strata. Media organizations earn more money by supplying a product that attracts the richer strata of the audience and therefore ‘content of interest to smaller, or minority, audiences will not be produced in amounts that will satisfy the preferences of that minority’ (Gandy, 2000: 47). And, while racial or ethnic identity can never be used as a fail-safe basis for predicting wealth and status, it remains true that ‘[m]edia produced for the poor folks at or near the bottom of the racial hierarchy will be of the lowest quality, and will most often be financed by the sale of dangerous, debilitating or worthless goods and services’ (Gandy, 2001: 10).\n\n21\n\nkey concepts\n\nKey Con Journalism\n\n26/4/05\n\n1:14 pm\n\nPage 22\n\ncritical. The study revealed similarities, rather than differences, between BBC and ITN news bulletins, in terms of the frequency and ordering of items, the selection of stories, the use of sources and the news values reflected in news programming. In brief, the study identified a common journalistic culture with shared routines of news production. The study also cast doubt on the widely held assumption that television news was in some way ‘objective’, offering a yardstick against which to measure ‘bias’. The redefined task became to reveal what was produced ‘in the name of objectivity and impartiality and to consider what evaluation could be made of that product’ (Eldridge, 2000: 115). Significantly, the research posed a crucial question: ‘does the way television news is constituted help to explain and clarify events in the world or does it mystify and obscure them?’ The response was highly critical, claiming that news production was ‘a process of mystification’ with the media researcher fulfilling the function of ‘dispelling illusions’. Moreover, ‘since there is a distinction between illusion and reality this was one reason for calling the work Bad News . . . the implication was that bad news could be better’ (ibid.: 115).

Newspapers are not bound in the same way, although they would certainly claim to take a balanced approach to reporting. References to ‘unbalanced reporting’ underpin many complaints to broadcasters. But while the emphasis these days has shifted to ‘due impartiality’ in all Ofcom radio and television news codes of practice and the BBC Producers’ Guidelines, balance seems to serve a purpose in defining impartiality itself. Balance\n\nKey Con Journalism\n\n26/4/05\n\n1:14 pm\n\nPage 23\n\nFurther reading Harcup, T. (2004) Journalism: Principles and Practice. London: Sage. Ofcom (2003) Programme Code, Section 3.7. London: Ofcom. Wilson, J. (1996) Understanding Journalism. London: Routledge.\n\nJournalism Studies\n\nThe narrowest interpretation is that balance simply means saying ‘on the one hand x and the other hand y’, an even-handedness of approach. There is also the ‘stop-watch’ definition (Wilson, 1996; Harcup, 2004) which means 30 seconds for one view, 30 seconds for its opposite. The Ofcom television news code is clear on this point: ‘While broadcasters should deal even-handedly with opposing points of view in the arena of democratic debate, it does not mean that “balance” is required in any simple mathematical sense or that equal time must be given to each opposing point of view’ (Ofcom, 2003). Similarly for radio: ‘Whilst balance, in a mathematical sense of equal time, is not always necessary, programmes should not be slanted by the concealment of relevant facts or by misleading emphasis’ (ibid.). And while impartiality in news broadcasting is a legal requirement, enshrined in the Broadcasting Acts of 1990 and 1996, balance doesn’t feature in the same way, although it could be argued that impartiality entails balance. For Wilson (1996: 45), balance means ‘exploring issues in an uncommitted way so that viewers, listeners and readers appreciate all the important arguments, including the weight of support they enjoy’.\n\nMK\n\nBandwidth In electronic communication terms, bandwidth is the difference in the range of frequencies used on a particular transmission channel. Signal frequency is measured in hertz, which is the number of cycles of change per second (searchNetworking.com, 2004). Bandwidth is also used in computer terminology as the amount of digital data, measured in bits (short for binary digits) per second (J. Hall, 2001: 247), that can be transmitted along a network. It ranges from narrowband (the conventional dial-up method on a computer) to highspeed delivery known as broadband which allows users to view pages on the world wide web faster, send and receive emails without delay, download files quicker and always-on access to the Internet (BBCi, 2003). Feldman and De Wolk both use the common analogy of a pipe when discussing bandwidth – the width of the pipe determines how much Bandwidth\n\n23\n\nkey concepts\n\nKey Con Journalism\n\n26/4/05\n\n1:14 pm\n\nPage 24\n\ninformation can be sent and at what speed; the fatter the pipe, the greater the bandwidth, hence the larger amount of information that can be conveyed at a higher speed. Digital information can also be compressed to fit more into the same physical space, effectively widening the width of the pipe (De Wolk, 2001: 94; Feldman, 1997: 7). The various types of broadband Internet access include an Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL), using existing telephone networks, and cable, wireless or satellite connections, although all these vary in availability, the quality of service and cost (BBCi, 2003; Whittaker, 2000: 29). The first decade of the world wide web did not witness extensive use of multimedia content by the major news providers like the BBC and CNN, due almost entirely to capacity issues relating to bandwidth (De Wolk, 2001: 94; J. Hall, 2001: 17–18; Ward, 2002: 22; Whittaker, 2000: 64). See Digitization Further reading De Wolk, R. (2001) Introduction to Online Journalism. Boston: Allyn and Bacon. Feldman, T.

Scargill’s certainty in recognizing and denouncing media bias is typical of the term’s more frequent usage in popular and public, rather than academic, discussions of the alleged distortions and misrepresentations in media content; especially news and current affairs. The notion of bias is significant and enjoys affinities with the cognate concepts of objectivity, impartiality, balance and truth, but there is no reference to bias in the BBC’s Producers’ Guidelines which set out the ‘editorial and ethical principles that drive the BBC’ (BBC, 1994, Introduction).

The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary reveals the word’s origins in the game of bowls where it describes the ‘bias’ a player places on the bowl to make it ‘swerve from the right line’. But in popular use, bias has come to mean a particular ‘inclination, predisposition, leaning or bent’ (1973: 188). Typically the disposition or leaning that triggers complaints of bias is political. Throughout the 1980s, for example, the disposition of the Murdoch press (especially the Sun) to favour successive Conservative administrations in the paper’s political coverage was widely recognized. (Franklin, 2004: 142–3). A number of journalists and editors similarly acknowledged the extensive influence of Rupert Murdoch’s political principles in shaping editorial even in papers of record such as The Times (Evans 1984: 4; Neil 1996). Since 1997, the Murdoch press has supported Labour (Franklin, 2004a: 130–2). Alternatively viewers and readers may complain about the metropolitan dominance or bias of news and other programming, despite the existence of regional centres of broadcasting in ITV and BBC and recent emphases on ‘regionalizing’ editions of national newspapers (McNair, 2004: 206). Bias may be conscious, reflecting journalists’ undue emphasis on a particular interpretation of events or their marginalizing or neglect of certain stories or sections of opinion and interest. But such crude and deliberate bias is rare; typically bias is attributed to structural or systemic relations and factors (Glasgow Media Group, 1976, 1980). McNair, for example, suggests ‘there is a link between the power structure of a society and its journalistic output; that journalism is part of a stratified social system; part of the apparatus by which that system is presented to its members in terms with which they can be persuaded to live’ (2003: 46). This structural bias is functional. In the words of the Glasgow Media Group, it secures ‘the cultural legitimation of the consensus and the status quo’ (1976: 15).\n\n25\n\nkey concepts\n\nKey Con Journalism\n\n26\n\n26/4/05\n\n1:14 pm\n\nPage 26\n\nBi-media In the cost- and efficiency-conscious BBC of 1990 the idea that journalists could work for both radio and television had an irresistible appeal. Working practices within both media were becoming more multi-skilled and this was part of the same process. The idea was simple: whatever story a journalist was working on, they could file for both radio and television. The concept was first rolled out in the regions, with a swathe of appointments of specialist correspondents in areas like health, business and local government. The brief was to break stories, cover them for both regional television news programmes and for local radio in a particular area. Critics pounced on the idea, saying it didn’t take into account the fundamental differences between radio and television reporting. There were fears that radio would be ignored as the more glamorous and timeconsuming television hogged the journalists. Radio risked becoming a ‘bit part player’ (Karpf, 1996 in Franklin, 1997: 137). Many journalists themselves found the sheer practicalities of the job unwieldy and the conflict was more between meeting the on-air demands of several outlets and finding time to break stories, rather than the inherent differences of the media. Bi-media journalism stayed and developed. BBC World Affairs Correspondent John Simpson (2002) describes how he covered the eviction of the Taliban from Kabul for radio and television. BBC network reporters move between both media. Within ITN, journalists will file material for both the television news bulletins and the radio news service IRN. Similarly at Sky. But if bi-media was the buzz word of the 1990s, tri-media and multiskilling are those of the early twenty-first century. With the growth of online reporting and technological advance, increasing numbers of journalists find themselves needing to pat their heads and rub their stomachs at the same time.

It changed the relationship between what had been thought of as ‘private’ and what was ‘public’ and brought a new social dimension to communication which is still developing. But the innovators of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century could not have foreseen the social impact of their early experiments in the recording, playback and transmission of sound and pictures. The first developments in what came to be called radio – wireless telegraphy and wireless telephony – tried to send messages from one fixed point to another, a feat accomplished by the Italian-born scientist Guglielmo Marconi in 1901. At first it was seen as a means of communicating between individuals and the idea that it could be used as a way of talking to large groups, and that the medium had social possibilities, was relatively slow to take hold. The idea that the audience might like to talk back was an even later phenomenon and had to wait for further technological advances. In Britain in 1922, the body responsible for the control of wireless telegraphy, the Post Office, drew for the first time a distinction between technology that could allow communication between individuals and technology that ‘addressed all and sundry’ (Crisell, 1994). Between 1909 and 1927 broadcasting began to establish itself all over the world. Radio was an instant hit. It gripped the public imagination with its ability to bring events, people and music into the home. By 1928 British audiences were as high as 15 million (Black, 1972: 26). But it was nothing compared to the impact of television which brought the pictures as well as the sound. The box in the corner of the room had been in development since the 1880s and no single person can be said to have ‘invented’ it. Test transmissions were underway in the late 1920s in America and Britain, but television broadcasting really took off after the Second World War. While radio is not television without pictures, television is not radio with pictures. But both address a perceived audience and Briggs (1965: 6) identified the relationship between the broadcaster and the audience as key to understanding broadcasting. Further reading Black, P.

MK\n\nBroadloid A neologism, coined by Alan Rusbridger (the current editor of the British broadsheet newspaper the Guardian) to describe a growing tendency of broadsheet newspapers to adopt the stories and styles of tabloid reporting. Franklin (1997) argues that this transformation is observable in four principal ways: first, broadsheets now ‘contain less news, especially foreign news, parliamentary news and investigative stories’ (ibid.: 7), preferring photographs to these expensive reporting formats. Second, ‘views have increasingly replaced news’ (ibid.: 8), with broadsheets choosing to fill the pages emptied of international and investigative reporting with engaging opinion from columnists. Third, Franklin suggests that broadsheets are increasingly ‘allocating a high news priority to stories which until recently would have been dismissed and disdained as merely tabloid stories’ (ibid.: 9). Thus, coverage of the Royal Family (particularly Diana, years after her death), stories recycled from the tabloids, celebrity tittle-tattle and popculture musings now regularly find their way into the main ‘news’ sections of broadsheet newspapers. Fourth, broadsheets are increasingly likely ‘to include many editorial features which previously were the exclusive preserve of the tabloids’ (ibid.: 9), such as problem pages (suitably disguised of course). Indeed, whole supplements have been designed and introduced with an eye to including formats more typical of tabloid reporting. Sticking with the Guardian, Peter Preston (editor 1975–95) has described the daily G2 tabloid section of the paper, which he introduced, as an opportunity for a change of pace. No more indigestible broadsheet pages dominated by a single picture and piles of text. Natural opportunities for what we call ‘furniture’ – the little bits of fun such as Note and Queries. . . The ability to take important subjects and run them on and on across spreads. . . Tabloids, I knew from my travels, didn’t equal dumbing down. On the contrary, many of Europe’s finest papers were tabloid. (Quoted in Cole, 2002: 55–6)\n\nThis quote suggests a number of objections to the critics of ‘broadloid newspapers’. Franklin’s (1997) critique implicitly, and at points explicitly, suggests that tabloid reporting is inferior reporting and that the inclusion Broadloid\n\nKey Con Journalism\n\n26/4/05\n\n1:14 pm\n\nPage 29\n\nFurther reading\n\nJournalism Studies\n\nof ‘tabloid stories’ or ‘tabloid formats’ represents a degradation of the broadsheet newspaper. Preston disagrees with this argument and points to the ‘quality tabloids’ of the continent such as El País: a tabloid format and tabloid (popular) styles by no means denote dumbing down. Second, the introduction of daily tabloid supplements may arguably have protected the serious reporting and punditry, since they allow the more irreverent, popular (tabloid?) content to be siphoned off into a separate section. Third, and related to this point, we need to consider the space afforded to journalists within the modern broadsheet newspaper. Franklin’s third and fourth criticisms lament the increasing inclusion of tabloid stories and tabloid styles. Assuming that this is accurate, does this content replace more traditional broadsheet content or sit side by side with it? Increased pagination in both main section and tabloid supplements have offered journalists the opportunity to write at length on a range of subjects ‘from the inconsequential celebrity talking point to the human take on an international tragedy. A writer could be sent out to “live on the minimum wage” or to explore the Israeli-Palestinian conflict’ (Cole, 2002: 56). From such a perspective, the broadloid newspaper represents a democratized rather than dumbed-down news agenda.\n\nFranklin, B. (1997) Newszak and News Media. London: Arnold. JER\n\nBroadsheet A broadsheet is a large format newspaper, written and distributed for a national audience on the basis of a national news agenda. (The many local newspapers printed in a broadsheet format are therefore rightly categorized as ‘local’ rather than ‘broadsheet papers’.) Broadsheet news values traditionally favour a mix of politics-plus-diplomacy-plus-war with sport on the back page; broadsheets aim at in-depth and comprehensive coverage; and are written using moderate and emotionally controlled language (assumedly) typical of the middle classes. Broadsheets tend to lead on the ‘issue’, or the substantive consequences, of a story rather than first-hand human interest approach more typical of tabloids; they tend to be ‘print heavy’ rather than the more pictorial tabloids; and are less inclined to use more ethically dubious reporting practices, such as doorstepping or paying sources for stories. Broadsheet\n\n29\n\nkey concepts\n\nKey Con Journalism\n\n26/4/05\n\n1:14 pm\n\nPage 30\n\nFurther, the readership profiles of broadsheet newspapers are heavily skewed in favour of society’s more powerful middle and upper classes. In the case of British broadsheet newspapers, Worcester has claimed: ‘Hardly anything so divides the British by class as does their newspaper reading habits. [In] 1993, of the middle class households, eight in ten (79 per cent) read the so-called “quality” papers and only one in five (21 per cent) working class adults did’ (1998: 41). As a consequence of their coverage, tone and readers, broadsheet newspapers have historically been regarded, both by journalists and readers, as the epitome of journalistic excellence.

JER\n\nCalcutt\n\n30\n\nThe late 1980s was a time of feverish competition between national tabloid newspapers for sensational stories which resulted in a heightened concern among British Members of Parliament about press behaviour; including intrusion into the privacy of individuals. In 1989 the Conservative Government formed an advisory group, the Committee on Privacy and Related Matters, to inquire whether reforms, regulatory or otherwise, were needed to further protect privacy and improve, for ordinary citizens, rights of recourse against the press. The eminent lawyer, David Calcutt QC, chaired it and it became known as the Calcutt Committee. Later in 1989 the then Home Office Minister David Mellor, referring to the mood of some MPs that new laws were needed to curb press excesses, made his famous remark on Channel 4’s Hard News programme: ‘I do believe the press – the popular press – is drinking in the Last Chance Saloon’. (Snoddy, 1993: 101) The Committee’s report, published in June 1990, recommended, inter alia, the abolition of the discredited Press Council and its replacement by a more streamlined body, to be called the Press Complaints Commission (Calcutt, 1990). This would administer a complaints system which remained self-regulatory. But the report also recommended that if such reforms failed to curb Press excesses within a probationary period Calcutt\n\nKey Con Journalism\n\n26/4/05\n\n1:14 pm\n\nPage 31\n\nJournalism Studies\n\n(eventually set at 18 months), then the industry should be made subject to statutory regulation. The Press, to blunt this threat of new legislation, quickly scrapped the Press Council, replacing it on 1 January 1991 with a Press Complaints Commission, though the PCC it created – and the Code of Practice on which its adjudications were to be based – differed in some key respects from the system proposed by the Calcutt Committee. Subsequently the government asked Sir David Calcutt – this time without a committee, but with a knighthood – to consider the probationary performance of the PCC. In his review he was scathing about the effectiveness of the PCC, and said it was unable to command public confidence (Calcutt, 1993). He recommended a statutory tribunal should replace it. However, the government was by then unpopular because of economic downturn and the involvement of Conservative Ministers in financial and adultery scandals exposed by the press, e.g. the married Mr Mellor’s affair with an actress. Despite further proposals for statutory controls, this time made by backbench MPs in the National Heritage Committee in 1993, the government decided not to risk antagonizing editors with an election looming, and – in the report Privacy and Media Intrusion, published in July 1995 – rejected the idea of proceeding with statutory regulation of the press (Department of National Heritage, 1995). The Calcutt Committee report of 1990 is sometimes referred to as Calcutt I and Sir David’s 1993 Review as Calcutt II. See Accountability, Ethics, Self-regulation. Further reading Gibbons, T.

Similar to editorials, newspaper cartoons tend to be a regular size and routinely located on the same page in each edition. Their presence in newspapers is relatively recent. In the eighteenth century, the age of Hogarth, cartoons were typically published as prints, while during the nineteenth century magazines such as Punch provided the setting for the satirical cartoon. The first newspaper cartoonist Francis Carruthers Gould (FCG) was appointed in 1888 by the Pall Mall Gazette, but the cartoon quickly became established as an editorial format alongside the emergence of a national popular press exemplified by Harmsworth’s Daily Mail in 1896. By the 1930s the Daily Mail, the Daily Express and the Daily Herald enjoyed circulations in the millions and their proprietors wanted their papers to be entertaining and well illustrated. Cartoons fall into two broad categories. First, there is the humorous cartoon strip which features in tabloid rather than broadsheet newspapers and which typically revolves around a central character such as Andy Capp (Daily Mirror). The humour of these cartoons derives from the sideways glance they offer on the everyday lives of the paper’s readers. Second, there is the explicitly political cartoon which features in both tabloid and broadsheet papers but predominates in the latter: in 1998, for example, of the 1,635 cartoons published in the national press, 1,132 featured in broadsheets with 503 in tabloids (Seymour Ure, 2003: 235). The presence of cartoons in newspaper is paradoxical in three ways: they are essentially graphic in a verbal medium; they exaggerate and distort while newspapers typically stress factual accuracy and impartiality, and, finally; they often play on readers’ emotions while journalists and editorial offers evidence and reasoned argument. Consequently, the cartoon sticks out like ‘a sore thumb’ among standard newspaper editorial formats (Seymour Ure, 2001: 333). The ‘cartoonist’s armoury’ (Gombrich, 1978) is crammed with the weapons of exaggeration, distortion, simplification, caricature and ambiguity. This last is useful since it allows cartoonists to be more critical ‘in pictures’ than law and editorial judgement allow in words. ‘My get out clause’ cartoonist Martin Rowson claims ‘will always be that anyone who doesn’t like it “can’t take a joke’’’ (Rowson, 2000: 26). Steve Bell’s caricature of John Major illustrates the point. In 1990, shortly after he became Prime Minister, Bell caricatured Major in a two-page spread as an incompetent superman (‘super-uselessman’) replacing the original superman briefs with Cartoons\n\nKey Con Journalism\n\n26/4/05\n\n1:14 pm\n\nPage 33\n\nJournalism Studies\n\na pair of cellular underpants (Bell, 1999: 112–13). Later, Bell took this image one step further and began to draw Major with his pants worn outside his trousers and ‘proceeded to flog the motif for all it was worth’ (ibid.: 111) and to ‘devastating effect’ (Plumb, 2004: 436). Such imagery can prove tenacious in the public mind and serve as an instantly recognizable symbol for the politician. In 2002 when Edwina Currie disclosed details of her longstanding affair with John Major, the front cover of Guardian 2 featured a Bell cartoon of Currie with a pair of ‘John Major’ pants over her head. Three final points about cartoonists. First, they have traditionally been very well paid. In 1933, for example, Beaverbrook doubled George Strube’s salary to £10,000 to prevent him being ‘headhunted’ from the Express to the Daily Herald, while Vicky at the Daily Mirror was earning ‘a great deal of money’ (Cameron, 1967: 45). Second, they begin young. Scarfe was 24 when he began working for the Evening Standard: Gibbard started at the Guardian at 24. Finally, cartoonists work long and tend to stay loyal to a single paper. Cummings, for example, retired at 77 having worked for the Daily/Sunday Express for 47 years (Bryant, 2000); Trog (short for troglodyte, a name given to clarinet player Wally Fawkes by Humphrey Lyttleton, reflecting his love of playing in cellars) retired from the Daily Mail at 72 after 35 years drawing the Flook cartoon strip (Melly, 2004).

BF\n\nCensorship Woolmar defines censorship broadly to include the control of information that is given out . . . censors are not just people with big black pens cutting out information which they don’t like from books or letters, or with scissors chopping out bits of film or video. As well as government officials, they can be owners of publications, judges, editors, advertisers or even the writers themselves. Nor are they always in far-off countries ruled by dictatorships. (Woolmar, 1990)\n\nWoolmar’s definition highlights three interesting features of censorship. First, Censorship\n\n33\n\nkey concepts\n\nKey Con Journalism\n\n34\n\n26/4/05\n\n1:14 pm\n\nPage 34\n\ncensorship is usually understood negatively to involve the withholding or limiting of information, whereas Woolmar’s phrase ‘control of information that is given out’ implies censorship may involve the distribution as well as restriction of information. The ‘over-provision’ of information as much as its restriction can be used as a strategy in information and news management. According to an apocryphal story, a KGB officer commented to a CIA agent, ‘We keep our people in the dark by telling them nothing, you keep yours in the dark by telling them everything.’ Second, censorship is not limited to governments and public authorities but can result from the actions of private individuals and organizations: indeed, journalists’ self-censorship illustrates precisely this. Political economy theorists like Herman and Chomsky, moreover, argue that the corporate and monopoly ownership of media institutions, along with the actions of powerful advertisers, serve not only to limit the diversity of expressed views but construct a ‘manufactured consent’ among readers and viewers, although such media are not officially censored (Herman and Chomsky [1988] 1994, Chapter 1). Finally, Woolmar’s definition notes that censorship is a function of all governments no matter how Liberal, especially in times of war (Miller, 2003). In the UK context, such censorship involves the system of D Notices (www.dnotice.org.uk/system.htm, and Sadler, 2001), the restrictions imposed by the Official Secrets Act (Ponting, 1988: 15) and, occasionally, the formal censorship of news agencies forbidding them from reporting particular events and processes such as the political problems and paramilitary campaigns in Northern Ireland. On 19 October 1988, the Home Secretary announced that 11 political and paramilitary groups in Northern Ireland, including the legally constituted party Sinn Fein, were to be banned from television and radio but, curiously, not from newspapers (Article 19, 2000). Notices were issued to the BBC and the IBA requesting that they ‘refrain at all times from sending any broadcast matter which consists of or includes any words spoken . . . by a person who . . . represents an organisation specified . . . below, or when the words support or solicit or invite support for such an organisation.’ The ban applied retrospectively and resulted in the absurdity of broadcasters having to re-edit educational programmes to remove footage of the Nationalist politician Connelly. The ban was eventually lifted in 1994. Further reading Miller, D. (2004) Tell Me Lies: Propaganda and Media Distortion in the Attack on Iraq. London: Pluto. Sadler, P.
