        "text": "Global equity in scholarly journal publishing: collaborating toward practical mechanisms to remove barriers for readers and authors - Colleen Campbell, Max Planck Digital Library\n\nThrough transformative agreements and other open access publishing frameworks, libraries and consortia worldwide are repurposing their former investments in subscription paywalls to enable immediate open access publication of hundreds of thousands of peer-reviewed research articles, so that no reader is excluded from access based on their financial status, and researchers everywhere can freely build on the new knowledge. But how can we equally ensure that authors do not encounter financial barriers as journals transition to OA business models and open access becomes the default in scholarly publishing?\n\nOA2020 has partnered with UNESCO, the International Science Council, cOAlition S, EIFL and other international organizations on a series of regional workshops to identify the financial barriers that authors encounter and hear the challenges they face, particularly in resource-limited contexts, in order to develop actionable plans and practical mechanisms that ensure no author is limited in their opportunity to publish their accepted articles open access in the journals of their choice. In this talk, Colleen Campbell, Strategic Advisor to the Max Planck Digital Library and coordinator of the Open Access 2020 Initiative (OA2020), will share insights gained in the workshops and the proposals that emerged.\n\nIncreasing the visibility of African sustainable research: The potential of Open Science, Mac-Anthony Cobblah, University of Cape Coast\n\nThis paper will explore the new approaches to research and innovations in Africa and focus on the potential of open science in sustainable and innovative research. The paper will further evaluate notable open science initiatives in Africa including the EIFL/CARLIGH open access project in Ghana and make suggestions on how to address the implementation challenges of open science practices, particularly how to equip researchers and scientists with skills and incentives to practice open science\n\nIndigenous Knowledge Preservation as a sign of respect for culture: Concerns of libraries, archives and museums - Adetoun Oyelude, University of Ibadan.\n\nIndigenous or traditional knowledge (IK) holders face a lack of respect and appreciation for such knowledge. Respect for culture means following protocols, accepting diversity, and recognizing indigenous cultures as living and continuously evolving. This article advances understandings to allow libraries, archives and museums to respect, affirm, and recognize indigenous ownership of traditional and living indigenous knowledges and respect protocols for their use. Preserving IK in academic libraries, using new technologies and how to respect indigenous culture in the preservation process will be explored. Intellectual property rights of knowledge holders, respect for the rights and adopted procedures will be described, with IK preservation activities assessed. Recommendations for more efficiently handling IK preservation as respect for culture are made\n\nOpen Publishing UK: Introducing a New Community of Practice - Kate Petherbridge, White Rose University Press, Dominque Walker, Scottish Universities Press\n\nThis Talk will update UKSG on the establishment of a new Association for UK-based institutional publishers (‘new’ university presses, library-led publishing ventures etc) who are either fully or partly open access. We will set out why the Association is being set up, its aims and next steps in its development. Institutional publishers face specific challenges and coming together will ensure the success and continued growth of this fast-emerging new sector within scholarly publishing. We will invite input from attendees about what is needed in this space and look to raise awareness amongst those who might find membership beneficial in developing their own publishing ventures.\n\nGuiding students through a shifting landscape: integrating Open Research topics into information literacy training at the University of Strathclyde - Karen Veitch, University of Strathcycle\n\nAs a member of the Scholarly Publications and Research Data team, I have worked collaboratively with colleagues in Research and Learning Support to integrate key concepts and information about developments within Open Research into an online Academic Library Skills course. I will speak about my experience of working on this project, which sits at the intersection of information literacy instruction and scholarly communications, bringing together aspects of librarianship which often remain distinct. The themes of the intersection of information literacy instruction and scholarly communications and collaborative working across teams are what I will focus on during this lightning talk\n\nWhere are we with operationalising DEIA within the scholarly ecosystem post-pandemic? - Rebecca Moakes, Maverick Publishing Specialists\n\nExploring the journey from submission through to publication (the blockers and enhances), we will be conducting quantitative and qualitative research to gain a high-level understanding of the current landscape, including examples of innovation in this space, positive impact on students and researchers and improvements to the diversity, equity and accessibility of the research output. Reviewing what the adoption curve looks like and practical recommendations for moving the pendulum in the right direction. Research will be conducted by Maverick Publishing Specialists.\n\nBlack and Minority Ethnic experiences in higher education: social justice, inclusion and white privilege - Kalwant Bhopal, University of Birmingham\n\nThis lecture will examine how Black and minority ethnic staff and students remain marginalised in higher education. It will provide statistical data on the inequalities experienced by staff and students, followed by empirical research on Black and minority ethnic academics in UK and US higher education. By drawing on empirical research, the lecture will also explore how processes of whiteness and white privilege work to perpetuate the white space of higher education. The lecture will conclude by examining possible ways forward for higher education to engage with a socially just agenda for the inclusion of all groups.\n\nA post-pandemic leadership model in a fractured world - Masud Khokhar, University of Leeds\n\nThe pandemic has had a significant impact on the motivation and health of organisations. Individuals and teams are tired, unsure, fatigued, and increasingly more polarised than ever before. The complexity and severity of the events unfolding around us is further perpetuating the feeling of learned helplessness. A systemic rebuild process is needed for organisations to move towards learned optimism, to return back to a steady and ultimately a thriving state. This presentation will focus on the observations and systems analysis of the current state, and will discuss recovery and rebuild approaches that can help us reach our goals and be optimistic about our future together.\n\nThe Role of Digital Publishing in Inclusive Practice - Laura Pacey, McGraw Hill\n\nThere is more content and more ways to access content than ever before, but the way disciplines are taught, and knowledge is held is not neutral. We need to reconnect, reorder and reclaim knowledges and teaching methodologies that have been submerged, hidden or marginalised. In this lightning talk, we explore ways to curate literature that reflects the global majority, while recognising that leading franchises are still dominated by senior, white, male academics. What role can digital publishing play in showcasing the voices of marginalised academics? Where can multimedia and simulations highlight relevancy for all those who want to engage?\n\nLeveraging an open infrastructure and tapping into an open service: examples of established workflows and approaches for open access books - Tom Mosterd, Community Manager DOAB & OAPEN\n\nAs Scholarly Communications is amidst a transition to Open Science – resulting in the more widespread availability of open content, data and infrastructure - the scientific community itself become increasingly adept at engaging with 'open'.\n\nTwo examples of 'open infrastructure services' are the Directory of Open Access Books (DOAB) and the OAPEN Library – both running on an open source version of DSpace with its metadata freely available under CC 0. The Directory of Open Access Books (DOAB) indexes over 60,000 open access books, whereas the OAPEN Library provides a structured and premium hosting environment for over 25,000 OA books.\n\nIn practice, how are these open infrastructures being used? What workflows, services and use-cases have been built on top of these open platforms by its community? In this Lighting Talk we will highlight several practical examples of workflows that have been established by librarians, service providers and other stakeholders that tap into this open service: how they use this to their local benefit, how having an open infrastructure service enables this, and invite others to think creatively about how to make the most use of these types of services – now and in future as they continue to grow\n\nFour Years of ROR: The Current State of the Research Organization Registry - Amanda French\n\nROR, the Research Organization Registry, does for organizations what ORCIDs do for scholars and DOIs do for research outputs: it identifies unique entities in an open, standard, and machine-readable way. Many repository and publishing systems allow the authors of articles and other research outputs to enter their university affiliations and funders as text strings, which makes for very messy data even within systems, let alone between systems. By producing clean, consistent affiliation information, ROR IDs can not only make it easier for universities and research institutes to track their impact in the context of the Research Excellence Framework, but can also create greater interoperability between and better affiliation searches within all manner of discovery systems. In this lightning talk, Amanda French, Technical Community Manager for ROR, will go over the value proposition of ROR; describe the initiative's history, governance, and plans; explain ROR's community-driven metadata curation process; and highlight some key implementations of ROR.\n\nSo …what next? The impact of Plan S for scholcomm stakeholders in 2025 and beyond - Roheena Anand, PLOS, Anna Vernon, Jisc, Robert Kiley, cOAlition S, Wilhelm Widmark, Stockholm University, David Armstrong, ACS Publications\n\nWith its announcement in Autumn 2018, cOAlition S’ Plan S sent the academic publishing ecosystem into a tailspin. Stakeholders, including publishers, libraries, and researchers, scrambled to understand the mandate, its timeline, what journals would be impacted, and how revenue and collections strategies would have to change to adjust to this new reality.\n\nThe scope and ambition of the mandate has fuelled ongoing debates about its fairness, in(or ex)clusivity, feasibility, timeline, and longer term, unintended impacts. Would it disadvantage European researchers? Would commercial publishers really comply? How would small nonprofit and society publishers make the transition? How could it work in H/SS fields with no funding? Should such a small group of influencers have such outsized power on global research networks?\n\nThis panel discussion, with representatives from cOAlition S, publishers, library consortia, and libraries will tackle this question in a moderated discussion format with opportunity for direct engagement with audience member questions.\n\nUniversity of Birmingham has always worked closely with academics to identify and purchase key databases outright, to own the content and avoid the risk of rising recurring costs. However, what happens when interest in the resource starts to fade, and when it is no longer new and exciting?\n\nIn this talk I will cover the different ways we have been tackling the issue of less visible, owned-outright electronic resources, and how we have worked to reposition them with the aim of higher usage and greater academic engagement. I will explain how we identified our under-used resources, and will use case studies to demonstrate the different routes we used to spark interest in these resources, and to raise their usage – such as engaging academics in curriculum mapping and asking for short story submissions for National Storytelling Week. I will also discuss how we are measuring impact, along with lessons learned so far, and planned next steps.\n\nThe [in]discoverability of open access books, taking action to improve the OA ebook supply chain - Tom Mosterd, DOAB Foundation, Open Access Books Network, Rupert Gatti, Thoth\n\nThe transition to open access for scholarly content such as books and journals enables research to be widely and freely available to readers worldwide. As publishers, funders, libraries and researchers are increasingly engaged in making scholarly books available open access (OA), how do these OA versions find their way through the supply chain for scholarly books? Which, for a large part, is built around print and digital (non-OA) books.\n\nAs part of this session we will hear from the OAPEN & Thoth team – two open metadata service providers that are part of the Open Book Collective and work together to increase discoverability for open access books. Jointly, we’ll take a closer look at the OA ebook supply chain and how these solutions contribute to bringing OA books to their readers, the challenges along the way and how we can ensure, collectively, that OA books are as (or more) discoverable compared to their closed counterparts.\n\nStreamlining monograph metadata supply with BDS - Heather Sherman, Bibliographic Data Services\n\nThe 2020 NAG Quality of Shelf Ready Metadata report and Jisc’s work on Plan M both highlighted that the monograph metadata supply chain is costly, inefficient, and not fit for purpose. To address this, BDS consulted with the entire monograph supply chain – publishers, suppliers, purchasing consortia, system providers and libraries to create a radically new service - the BDS Academic Library Licence.\n\nThe Breakout session will explore how BDS and libraries such as Imperial College have partnered on a cost-effective, completely hands-off solution for the creation, curation, supply and sharing of high quality records that realises the aims of Jisc’s Plan M and brings about much needed change to the metadata marketplace which is resulting in service improvements and cost savings.\n\nGender and ethnicity productivity patterns in the scientific literature - Gali Halevi, Clarivate\n\nEvidence shows that women in academia are more likely to publish sole-authored papers than men and our findings add the additional insight that this occurs predominantly early in a woman’s career. There are several possible explanations. Earlier in their careers, women often seek tenure, and sole-authored publications are very important for promotion. Moreover, younger women may also have young children: family obligations can impede collaboration or travel. Women have been shown to have smaller networks than male counterparts, and this may reduce possible partnership opportunities. Further, collaboration can result in second or third authorship, which would reduce the impact of women’s contribution; women may be unwilling to receive less credit. Other reasons may be discrimination and bias, but these are less likely than the reasons suggested above.\n\nAdvancing DEI in research publishing – putting strategy into practice - Thea Sherer, Springer Nature Group\n\nIn September 2021, we made our formal commitment to Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DEI) across our external Research & Solutions activities. Since then, our journals, books and magazines are elevating issues of diversity, representation, equity, justice and much more in both their content and their processes. From launching the industry’s first guide to content that may be harmful to human population groups, a new approach to ethics dumping and helicopter research, a transgender name change policy and Nature’s first ever guest edition on racism in science: we’ve taken steps to integrate DEI into the way we work and the content we create. In this session, we’ll talk about our experience so far turning strategy into practice, and the projects we’re planning for the near future from language guides to data collection\n\nArts scholarship is tough in the current landscape, working under a government that increasingly values STEM and in a culture that has increasing requirements in open research. Research data management, born of engineering disciplines, is not easily applicable to visual or performing arts and nor should it be. Significant changes in the language, approach, infrastructure and drivers or goals need to happen in any research data management intervention in order to provide arts research with the support it needs, not for it’s data to yield maximum impact, but for it’s compost to turn into the brightest blooms.\n\nLancaster University has a small but impactful research output in this discipline, and it can be difficult to engage researchers in the sharing and publishing of research data when they are incredibly unfamiliar with the process and in most cases do not consider themselves creators of data at all. In this paper, 5 key challenges are presented as a way of articulating the complexity in this area, and arguments are presented that maintain that research data management is entirely relevant for the arts. This contextual understanding combined with upskilling has begun to develop relationships at Lancaster, resulting in effective publishing of the following dataset in our institutional repository: https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/news/life-survey-helping-shape-the-future-of-our-region\n\nUN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): Mapping Institutional Research/SDG’s in Research Portal Denmark – providing insights on a national level\n\nNicola will talk about how Lancaster has mapped scholarly output onto the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) using SciVal and Altmetric Explorer data. She will present an overview of Lancaster’s research, exploring subject differences and areas of strengths/for improvement. She will also detail how this information has been used across the University, including at different levels of seniority. Attendees will leave with an understanding of how Lancaster has contributed to the SDGs, as well as potential methodology to use at their own university.\n\nSDG’s in Research Portal Denmark – providing insights on a national level - Karen Hytteballe Ibanez, Technical University Denmark, DTU, NORA Team/Mogens Sandfaer, National Open Research Analytics\n\n​​​​​​​Abstract Research Portal Denmark collects and exhibits data from global, national, and institutional sources for Danish research in four parallel databases, including publications which have been mapped to one or more of the 17 SDGs. Unsurprisingly, the portal's databases show that due to the sources' SDG mapping methods, there is a big difference in the number of SDG tagged publications from different sources, as well as which- and how many SDGs the respective publications have been mapped to. The presentation will discuss how – and whether you can handle this inconsistency in an analytical context in a responsible way.\n\nAs a department of the University of Cambridge, Cambridge University Press and Assessment shares the University’s aim of contributing to a sustainable future for all. Setting a target of reducing our energy-related carbon emissions to zero by 2048 is one way in which we aim to add social and environmental value to the world and minimise impact on the environment and the communities where we operate.\n\nMany other universities represented at UKSG will have similar targets and we have much to learn from each other about how to achieve them. Working collaboratively with our partners, suppliers and stakeholders is essential to scale up global progress.\n\nFind out how we are addressing the challenge of environmental sustainability at CUP&A, including how we are decarbonising buildings, analysing our own Scope 3 data and tackling the knotty problems of reducing emissions associated with both print and the digital hosting of publications.\n\nWith the growth of E-Books and online learning platforms, more data is generated by Libraries every day. We want to start a discussion that increases awareness and knowledge of the varied kinds of data that libraries and users are generating and uncover the benefits and the harms that unregulated, unknown, data processing can lead to. This is an opportunity to develop cross-sector knowledge about publisher/supplier requirements whilst also learning how to prioritise data security and protection for our users. The generation of data has largely been taken for granted and as a sector we have failed to engage critically with the implications of large-scale sets of non-GDPR data and how this can affect the adoption of learning resources. We are concerned that information about our users and their activities are being increasingly used in ways that disadvantage Libraries and want to expand our collective knowledge to ensure that we are not being taken advantage of. This session seeks to bring together participants from across the sector to explore ways we can all benefit from data use.\n\nIn October 2022, as part of a strategic commitment to Open Research, Sheffield Hallam University’s new institutional policy for research publication and copyright, based on rights retention, came into effect.\n\nAs part of its role to provide access to knowledge, Hallam’s library led a partnership between the University’s research community and professional services to develop this new policy and implement rights retention as a new practice. This transformation in Hallam’s approach to copyright and scholarly communication took place alongside the development of UK HE sector requirements for transitional agreements and negotiation with publishers.\n\nIn this presentation, Nick Woolley (Director of Library and Campus Services) will share how the policy was developed and implemented and what the experience has been so far, including insight from the first six months of activity and data. Nick will show how Hallam’s policy is already making a positive impact on scholarly communication and argue why rights retention as disruptive innovation is relevant for all institutions who create knowledge."
