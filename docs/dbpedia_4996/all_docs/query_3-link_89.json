        "text": "Destination Management Organisations (DMOs)\n\nEngland’s destinations are disparate and multifaceted, host to numerous stakeholders with their own specific needs. The DMOs responsible for the local visitor economy can also be varied: they might be public sector bodies such as local authorities with definitive boundaries, private companies or partnerships between the public and private sector.\n\nWell-managed destinations are more likely to sustain investment, business growth and employment without a detrimental effect on the environment or local population. The best-managed destinations are also likely to attract inward investment across a broader range of sectors, as well as value-added jobs and new talent. This makes them great places to live, work and visit.\n\nFrom promotional activity to research and insights, we help destinations grow their economies through tourism. Of the various tools, the most effective are Destination Management Plans and Tourism Growth Plans, which create an integrated and long-term approach to destination management.\n\nLocal Visitor Economy Partnerships (LVEPs)\n\nFollowing the de Bois review of the structure, funding and function of DMOs, we are creating an additional portfolio of nationally supported, strategic and high-performing Local Visitor Economy Partnerships (LVEPs), which represent their destination at local and national level.\n\nThese LVEPs lead, market and manage tourism within their area, working in partnership with other destination organisations, local government and businesses. They provide strong local leadership and governance, and deliver robust destination management and planning – ensuring all key public and private sector partners are integrated into the development of the plan and its implementation.\n\nAt VisitEngland, we provide targeted support, advice and guidance; we expect there will eventually be around 40 LVEPs across England.\n\nLearn more about Local Visitor Economy Partnerships.\n\nLocal Enterprise Partnerships (LEPs)\n\nLocal Enterprise Partnerships (LEPs) are voluntary collaborations between local authorities and businesses.\n\nThey were first formed in 2011, and there are currently 39 LEPs in operation. Their primary function is to determine economic priorities and lead economic growth and job creation within local areas. Where tourism is a recognised tool for driving growth, they work on specific projects and initiatives in partnership with DMOs.\n\nAll LEPs have developed a Strategic Economic Plan and European Investment Strategy, which sets out priorities for how their government funding will be targeted to deliver growth and jobs. This funding is used to leverage further public and private sector investment into their areas.\n\nLEPs play an important role in the growth of the local visitor economy by encouraging and reducing barriers to inward investment, developing infrastructure projects, supporting businesses and up-skilling the local population.\n\nLearn more about Local Enterprise Partnerships."
