Body of Evidence is a 1993 American erotic thriller movie starring Madonna, Willem Dafoe, Joe Mantegna, Anne Archer and Julianne Moore. The movie was written by Brad Mirman, directed Uri Edel and produced by Dino De Laurentiis.[2] It was given an "NC-17" rating[3] because it showed female nudity, sex scenes, and vulgar language. The movie performed very poorly at the box office and was rejected by critics; the New York Times described it as a "sluggish courtroom melodrama."[2] The 99 minute long movie was released by MGM.
