This is an original, rolled, one-sheet movie poster from 1993 for Body of Evidence starring Madonna, Willem Dafoe, Joe Mantegna, Anne Archer, Julianne Moore, Jurgen Prochnow, Michael Forest, and Charles Hallahan. Uli Edel directed the crime thriller.

The double-sided poster measures 27" x 41" and is in very good condition with a few, small spots of faint discoloration in the top-right white border. It has never been folded. Like many theatrical movie posters printed after 1990, this poster is double-sided. The image on the back of the poster is a mirror image of the front.

Please look closely at the photos (this is the exact poster you are buying). The black squares in the corners of the poster are magnets and not pins.

This collectible poster, printed in 1993 to promote the theatrical release of Body of Evidence, is not a reproduction or a reprint.
