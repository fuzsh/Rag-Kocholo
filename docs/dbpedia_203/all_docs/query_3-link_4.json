The movie was written by Brad Mirman, directed Uri Edel and produced by Dino De Laurentiis.[2] It was given an \"NC-17\" rating[3] because it showed female nudity, sex scenes, and vulgar language. The movie performed very poorly at the box office and was rejected by critics; the New York Times described it as a \"sluggish courtroom melodrama.\"[2] The 99 minute long movie was released by MGM.\n\nRebecca Carlson (Madonna) is on trial in Oregon for murder. The district attorney Robert Garret (Joe Mantegna) is sure she used her body as a weapon, causing her victim to die from a heart attack while having sex. She will inherit eight million dollars from the victim. She hires a good lawyer, Frank Dulaney (Willem Dafoe) to defend her in court.\n\nOther websites\n\n[change | change source]"
