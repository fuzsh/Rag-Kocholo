        "text": "BODY OF EVIDENCE is a courtroom drama built around the charge that a sadomasochist used her body as a deadly weapon to fornicate an elderly millionaire into the grave. The story begins with the death of millionaire Andrew Marsh. He dies of heart failure in his bedroom, with a vial of cocaine on his night stand and a pornographic video playing in his VCR. When investigators discover handcuff marks on his bedpost, they suspect his kinky mistress, Rebecca Carlson (Madonna), killed him in a marathon sex session in order to inherit his estate. At the trial, attorney Frank Dulaney (Willem Dafoe) defends Ms. Carlson. After exhausting day in court, Frank takes Rebecca home. Although he is a happily married man, Frank commits adultery with Rebecca. In their bizarre interludes, Rebecca handcuffs Frank to her bed and drips hot candle wax on his genitals. In another episode, Frank and Rebecca break a light bulb inside a parking garage and fornicate on top of the broken glass. Back in court, the person who actually committed the murder goes unpunished, and freely walks away from the trail.\n\nAlternating between courtroom and bedroom scenes, the movie’s main focus is “dangerous” sex, yet ends up being more idiotic than erotic in the final reel. Overall, the movie violates justice and perpetuates violent sexual acts against women."
