It’s an excruciatingly incompetent entry in the Basic Instinct genre, filled with lines that only a screenwriter could love, and burdened with a plot that confuses mystery with confusion.\n\nThe movie stars Madonna, who after Bloodhounds of Broadway, Shanghai Surprise and Who’s That Girl? now nails down her title as the queen of movies that were bad ideas right from the beginning. She plays a kinky dominatrix involved in ingenious and hazardous sex with an aging millionaire who has a bad heart. He dies after an evening’s entertainment, and Madonna is charged with his murder.\n\nToday in Madonna History: January 17, 1993\n\nOn January 17 1993, it was announced that Body Of Evidence, starring Madonna and Willem Dafoe, grossed a mere $6.5 million at the US box-office during its opening weekend. Here’s a great quote from Rebecca Carlson (Madonna’s character):\n\nI don’t know why men lie; they just do. Men. Lie.\n\nToday in Madonna History: January 15, 1993\n\nOn January 15 1993, Body of Evidence was released across North America. The erotic thriller was produced by Dino De Laurentiis and directed by Uli Edel. The film starred Madonna and Willem Dafoe, with Joe Mantegna, Anne Archer, Julianne Moore and Jürgen Prochnow in supporting roles.\n\nThe theatrical release for the film received the rare NC-17 rating (“No Children Under 17 Admitted”).\n\nSex was a game to her. She got off on the control. She always used to tell me it had to be her way.\n\nWhen was the last time you watched Body of Evidence?
