        "text": "Nancy Cartwright’s Spotted Cow Entertainment has acquired worldwide motion picture and television rights to Rachel Grant’s thriller novel “Body of Evidence.”\n\nThe film will be produced by Cartwright, alongside fellow Spotted Cow executives Peter Kjenaas and Monica Gil, and is currently out to writers to adapt. It is scheduled for a 2017 production start.\n\nCartwright, best known as the voice of Bart Simpson on “The Simpsons,” launched Spotted Cow as a film/television finance and production company at Berlin.\n\n“Body of Evidence” centers on an archaeologist and a U.S. attorney find themselves on a globe-spanning chase full of political intrigue and legal drama.\n\n“We see, in this extraordinary novel, an entertaining, wild ride of passion and courage,” Kjenaas said. “Rachel has elevated the genre by rooting it in her deep knowledge of archaeology and this gives it an authenticity that is unique. Behind the truly threatening action of a thriller is the even more threatening risk of giving in to desire.”\n\nSpotted Cow’s first project, “In Search of Fellini,” recently wrapped production in Italy. The coming-of-age drama starring Ksenia Solo, Maria Bello and Mary Lynn Rajskub. The film was directed by Taron Lexton and written by Cartwright and Kjenaas.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nThe company is also producing the one-woman stage show “24 Hours with Mary Lynn Rajskub.”\n\nGrant is repped by Elizabeth Winick Rubinstein at McIntosh & Otis, Inc.\n\nThe project is not related to MGM’s 1993 erotic thriller of the same name, which starred Madonna and Willem Dafoe."
