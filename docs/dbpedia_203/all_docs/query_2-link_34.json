        "text": "What to do about poor Madonna? After gaining screen credibility with sharp, funny performances in smallish roles in \"Dick Tracy\" and \"A League of Their Own,\" and as the great mocking Queen Bee in her own documentary, \"Truth or Dare,\" she lands back at square one in \"Body of Evidence,\" a sluggish courtroom melodrama relieved only by unintenional laughter. As major corporate decisions go, \"Body of Evidence\" ranks with the Edsel. It's not going anywhere. As a movie, it looks as if it wanted to be \"Basic Instinct,\" though it winds up more like \"Ilsa, She-Wolf of the SS.\"\n\nIt's easy to understand why the actress thought there might be Madonna-like possibilities in Brad Mirman's screenplay. She plays Rebecca Carlson, a woman on trial for a murder in which she allegedly used her body as the lethal weapon. Her victim, who is seen only as a wide-eyed, somewhat surprised-looking corpse in the opening sequence, is a rich old fellow with an unreliable heart and a fondness for sex toys.\n\nRobert Garrett (Joe Mantegna), the district attorney, is sure that Rebecca did willingly, and with full knowledge of the victim's frail ticker, have intercourse with him to the point of his death in a session that involved homemade porn videos, handcuffs and nipple clamps. There's also the matter of the $8 million Rebecca stands to inherit. When questioned about these embarrassing facts by Frank Dulaney (Willem Dafoe), the crackerjack lawyer she hires to defend her, all Rebecca can say is, \"They've taken something good between two people in love and made it dirty.\"\n\nRebecca has an explanation for everything. When confronted by a witness who claims to have seen her sniffing cocaine, she proves that the white powder was really Chinese peony roots, which, as everyone within the film knows, are a naturally buffered asprin substitute.\n\n\"Body of Evidence\" demonstrates the same teasing, rather parochial obsession with sadomasochistic game-playing that dominates the fantasies of Madonna's 1992 best-selling publishing phenomenon, \"Sex,\" though without the book's redeemingly childlike, go-for-broke smuttiness. \"Body of Evidence\" is not a star's cannily packaged reveries. It means to be coherent both as a mystery story and as an odyssey of sexual liberation, but works as neither. It's not even blatant as a star vehicle. \"Body of Evidence\" is a movie that might actually have been better if the star had been more demanding. Perhaps the camera would have been more kind to her. Perhaps not.\n\n\"Body of Evidence\" is not a movie for which the blame can be assigned by anyone who was not on hand before, during and after production. A lot of good people were involved, including Uli Edel, the German-born director who was responsible for the fine screen adaptation of \"Last Exit to Brooklyn.\" His work here makes Paul Verhoeven, the man who directed \"Basic Instinct,\" seem the equal of Orson Welles.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
