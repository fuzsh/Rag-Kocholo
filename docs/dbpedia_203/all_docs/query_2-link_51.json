        "text": "This is an original Japanese lightly three folded poster printed in 1993 for the first release of Body of Evidence.\n\nBody of Evidence is a 1993 American erotic thriller film produced by Dino De Laurentiis and distributed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. It was directed by Uli Edel and written by Brad Mirman. The film stars Madonna and Willem Dafoe, with Joe Mantegna, Anne Archer, Julianne Moore, and Jürgen Prochnow in supporting roles.\n\nIt originally received the rare NC-17 rating. The first theatrical release was censored for the purpose of obtaining an R rating, reducing the film's running time from 101 to 99 minutes. The video premiere, however, restored the deleted material. Madonna's performance in the film was universally derided by film critics and it marked her fourth film acting performance to be widely panned, following Shanghai Surprise, Who's That Girl, and Bloodhounds of Broadway.\n\nIn France and Japan, the film was released under the name Body. In Japan, Madonna's other 1993 film Dangerous Game was released there as Body II even though the films have nothing in common nor are related to each other in narrative.(Source Wikipedia)\n\nThis poster is in a very good condition and has never been folded. Please refer to the imagery as this is the exact poster that is for sale.\n\nIt is 27 years old!\n\nIt is not a reproduction or a reprint.\n\nCertificate of Authenticity included."
