The tick-borne illness known as Lyme disease is everywhere: on the news, on social mediaâ¦ but is it really near you? Dr. Love separates facts from fiction when it comes to Lyme disease, both the acute infection and the alleged chronic condition.\n\nCorrection (2024/07/24):Â Dr. Love wanted to correct a statement she made. She said that tick-borne relapsing fever does not occur in the U.S., but she meant that it did not occur in the eastern U.S. It does occur in western U.S. states but is caused by a different BorreliaÂ species and spread by different ticks, so there is no overlap with Lyme disease.Â\n\nÂ\n\n* Theme music: âFall of the Ocean Queenâ by Joseph Hackl.\n\nTo contribute to The Body of Evidence, go to our Patreon page at: http://www.patreon.com/thebodyofevidence/.\n\nPatrons get a bonus show on Patreon called âDigressionsâ!
