The movie was written by Brad Mirman, directed Uri Edel and produced by Dino De Laurentiis. It was given an \"NC-17\" rating because it showed female nudity, sex scenes, and vulgar language. The movie performed very poorly at the box office and was rejected by critics; the New York Times described it as a \"sluggish courtroom melodrama.\" The 99 minute long movie was released by MGM.",
