        "text": "Starring: Madonna, Willem Dafoe, Joe Mantegna, Anne Archer, Julianne Moore, Frank Langella\n\nCo-hosted by Joe Berger (The Deuce Film Series); sponsored by MUBI\n\nWhen an old wealthy man suddenly dies in flagrante delicto, his lover Rebecca Carlson is charged with his murder. Blunt about their robustly kinky sex life, she is believed to have taken advantage of his fragile health in order to collect on his fortune, left to her in his will. She easily convinces lawyer Frank Dulaney (Willem Dafoe) of her innocence, and he agrees to represent her. Her allure is undeniable, and he can’t help but sample what she has to offer, professional ethics be damned.\n\nAnother delectable exercise in excess from producer Dino De Laurentiis, Body of Evidence is fully Madonna’s show; she’s at the height of her powers, so as ridiculous as the movie can get, one can’t help but marvel at the audacity.\n\nKeep track of the erotic thriller tropes with your Nitehawk Diaries Bingo card!"
