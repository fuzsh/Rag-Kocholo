You will learn what GPA means in a patient chart and how menstruation can be used to judge the health of a country, while Chris tries to figure out what is wrong with this tiny but ferocious patient.\n\nAlso: an announcement that will change The Body of Evidence forever….\n\nWarning: this episode contains medical discussion of genitals.\n\nA Block: The Case of the She-Hulk Toddler\n\n(0:58) She has the strength of two toddlers! Also, puberty seems to have kicked in. What is going on with her?\n\nB Block: Announcement\n\n(32:29) Chris and Jonathan announce something.\n\n* Theme music: “Fall of the Ocean Queen“ by Joseph Hackl\n\n* Assistant researcher: Aigul Zaripova\n\nTo contribute to The Body of Evidence, go to our Patreon page at: http://www.patreon.com/thebodyofevidence/.\n\nTo make a one-time donation to our show, you can now use PayPal! https://www.paypal.com/donate?hosted_button_id=9QZET78JZWCZE\n\nPatrons get a bonus show on Patreon called “Digressions”! Check it out!\n\nJonathan and Chris speak to Dr. Andrea Love, a microbiologist, immunologist, science communicator, and the director of the American Lyme Disease Foundation. The tick-borne illness known as Lyme disease is everywhere: on the news, on social media… but is it really near you? Dr. Love separates facts from fiction when it comes to Lyme disease, both the acute infection and the alleged chronic condition.\n\nCorrection (2024/07/24): Dr. Love wanted to correct a statement she made. She said that tick-borne relapsing fever does not occur in the U.S., but she meant that it did not occur in the eastern U.S. It does occur in western U.S. states but is caused by a different Borrelia species and spread by different ticks, so there is no overlap with Lyme disease.\n\n* Theme music: “Fall of the Ocean Queen“ by Joseph Hackl.\n\nTo contribute to The Body of Evidence, go to our Patreon page at: http://www.patreon.com/thebodyofevidence/.\n\nPatrons get a bonus show on Patreon called “Digressions”!
