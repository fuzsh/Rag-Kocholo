        "text": "Unreleased\n\nMADONNA - FROM GENESIS TO REVELATIONS by Bruce Baron\n\nfrom http://www.buysellmadonna.com/bruce.htm\n\nCollaborations with Shep Pettibone however, continued with the album \"Erotica\". It is rumored that some of the songs from this album started out as demo productions with her DJ and remixer Junior Vasquez including a title called \"Love Hurts\". This song is said to have evolved into the Madonna-Pettibone song \"Erotica\" which became the album title track. Copyright records do not support this claim, but handwritten alternate lyrics (said to be Madonna's) did appear on the auction block featuring this alternate chorus:\n\n\"Sometimes you cross that line - Love Hurts- You gotta be cruel to be kind - Love Hurts-Tell me whats on your mind-Love stings- Love burns- Love sings- Love yearns- But most of all love hurts.\"\n\nThere are also other unreleased orphans from the \"Erotica\" period. These include \"Actions Speak Louder Than Words\" which is copyrighted separately from the released \"Words\". Another title called \"Cheat\" appears to contain a line that was used in \"Thief Of Hearts\", but the copyright records also refer to the alternate title for \"Cheat\" called \"Drunk Girl\" which may have some connection to the released song \"Bad Girl\" which does appear on the album. \"Deeper And Deeper\" also started out with alternate arrangements and lyrics according to reports that Pettibone gave to EQ magazine. Two other tunes \"Shame\", and \"You Are The One\" have never seen the light of day in any form, but do have copyright registrations. In fact, \"Shame\" has an original Madonna demo on file at the Library Of Congress.\n\nEvidence does not support the other rumored titles from the \"Erotica\" sessions which include \"Freak\", \"No Entry\", and \"Throb\" even though they appeared in trusted media publications. Early press for this album also spoke of \"Show And Tell\", \"Eating Out\", and \"Out To Lunch\" which have not surfaced, and they do not appear in the copyright records. They may be early re-writes of the released \"Where Life Begins\", or media error. Another title which was called \"Queens Pearls\" or \"Queen Of Pearls\" by the media eventually turned up as the club hit \"Queens English\" by former 1990 Blonde Ambition Tour dancers Luis and Jose. This song features Madonna backing vocals and was produced by Junior Vasquez. Alternate Madonna versions of this song could not be confirmed to exist.\n\nJust after Erotica Madonna gave a demo of \"Just A Dream\" co-written and produced with Patrick Leonard to Blonde Ambition Tour dancer and backing vocalist Donna DeLory. Donna used the song on her MCA Records debut, but the Madonna lead vocal recording remains unreleased. Today, Donna is the vocalist in the duo group Bliss.\n\nhttp://s3.invisionfree.com/Madonna_Dot_Refugees/ar/t144.htm\n\nErotica\n\n1991 ACTIONS SPEAK LOUDER THAN WORDS Registered seperately from \"Words\" at Library Of Congress. PAU-1-605-641. Bruce Baron recently visited the Library of Congress in Washington DC, and he had a chance to hear this track. He writes: I always thought that \"Words\" and \"Thief Of Hearts\" were two overlooked potential singles from the \"Erotica\" album, and I was pleased to find a few alternate mixes on Shep Pettibones copyright submission from Feb 11th, 1992. Date of creation 1991. He sent in several songs on two tapes (track list to follow). The copyright office calls this the \"Rain\" album because it was the first song listed on the first tape. I was able to review alternate mixes that I had not requested because they were all together. The \"Rain\" title was written centered on the title card, while the others below it where written to the left margin of the card. This makes it look like the title of the collection. I will reference his demo this way in the future because of this registration. This \"Actions Speak...\" registration is not exactly a different song than \"Words\". It is the original title name from the handwritten title card that was used to label the cassette. It is actually the same song. Two similar versions of \"Actions Speak...\" were provided. Both were without the repeating indian instrument that eight years later seems so annoying in the released version. Instead the synth keys that we are used to hearing only at the end of the song are used in chorus sound in each chorus. There is also a subtle guitar-like sound. The vocal take seemed a little different that the released recording. It must have been re-recorded later. Additional lyrics include \"Your love is for fools\", and \"You're so cruel\". The backing vocals and bridge arrangements are slightly different. These were good !\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------ --\n\n1991 CHEAT (aka DRUNK GIRL) Library Of Congress PAu-1-605-639. Contains part \"Theif Of Hearts\" lyric, and \"Bad Girl\". Written by Madonna, Pettibone, Shimkin. Here are Bruce Baron's research notes on this track: This submission is from a cassette tape sent in by Shep Pettibone which features several songs and alternate mixes from the \"Erotica\" album. I will provide a complete track listing later. From what I can tell this is exactly the same version as the released version of \"Bad Girl\". I didn't notice any changes. The name of the song comes from the hand written tittles on the tape and is not a typo. This indicates to me that this is the original song tittle of \"Bad Girl\" which must have been changed prior to it's release on \"Erotica\".\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------\n\n1991 GET OVER Madonna demo written & produced with Stephen Bray given to Nick Scotti to record on his debut Reprise album. Existence confirmed.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------ --\n\n1991 SHAME Never released written by Madonna, Shep Pettibone and Tony Shimkin. Existence confirmed at Warner-Chappell Publishing website. Also at Library Of Congress PAU-1-605-637. Bruce Baron notes that this totally unreleased song is from the \"Erotica\" sessions with Shep Pettibone. It's actually very good. It's similar in dance style to that of \"Deeper And Deeper\", and \"Vogue\", Perhaps a little slower. This demo is high enough quality that it could have been sent to another artist to use (like \"Love Wont Wait\"). If it had been included on the album, it would have been too similar in sound to have enough variety on the album with the other tracks. I guess this made room for the Andre Betts collaborations. In the song Madonna talks down to the object character of the song (or perhaps the listener). This is part of the developing Dita persona that we did not get to see. The song opens with a spoken intro: \"Look what you have done with your life, it's such a shame\". Later she says \"anyone can learn to fly\" as if she is asking why haven't you learned yet ? She also says \"you're the one to blame\". The chorus starts with \"It's a Shaaaaaame\" which sounds an awful alot like the song of the same title by Monie Love. This is probably the source of the old rumour that they were going to do something together. The similarity ends there, and then it breaks off into it's own unique melody. It's hard for me to remember the rest of the lyric for the chorus, because my brain tries to fill in the memory with the rest of it from the Monie Love song. It sounds that close in that first line only.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------ --\n\n1991 WHY ITS SO HARD Original versions included rap by Jamaiki according to Shep Pettibone article.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------ --\n\n1991 YOU ARE THE ONE PAU-1-605-636. Written by Madonna, Shep Pettibone, Tony Shimkin. Bruce Baron has listened to this track at the Washington DC Library of Congress, and he notes that this is another unreleased song from the \"Erotica\" sessions found on the \"Rain tapes\". This one could use some more work. It's not that good, and no surprise that it was abandoned at the demo stage. The sound is very dance/club/house. As with \"Shame\" it would have been redundant to include it on the album. That sound would get old with \"Deeper And Deeper\", \"Fever\", \"Words\", and \"Thief Of Hearts\" on the same album. It's sound it remotely similar to the released versions of \"Goodbye To Innocence\". The lyrics a rather forgettable. The ones I do recall are \"You are the one for me\", \"I have chosen you\".\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------ --\n\n1992 DEEPER AND DEEPER PAu-1-605-634. According to a Shep Pettibone (Erotica album collaborator) recording industry article , first versions recorded used alternate lyrics. Bruce Baron notes that this one isn't all the different from the released version. Again there is a great deal of recorded distortion. Surprising for the head of Mastermix productions. This version is missing the latin guitar break which Shep told EQ magazine that Madonna insisted on. This one must be closer to his original vision with the house pattern. In that same EQ article Shep also mentioned that \"Fever\" grew out of the arrangement from the developing \"Goodbye To Innocence\" which was later abandoned. The great demos of GTI don't sound anything like the versions of \"Fever\" that we know. According to the \"Rain tapes\", that report does not match up to the evidence that I heard. There must be additional versions of GTI? The end of \"Deeper And Deeper\" is also a little different using the same lines. It also goes on for a longer period. Unused lyrics in an unreleased version of \"Deeper And Deeper\" include: \"I can't keep from falling in love, and you know it.....I can't keep from falling in love, so I show it.\"\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------ --\n\n1992 EROTICA / YOU THRILL ME PAu-1-605-642 (Shep Pettibone Demo Version). These Pettibone demo versions of \"Erotica\" are very different from the released album version. The verse lyrics are mostly the ones that we know from \"Erotic\" which was included in the book \"Sex\". The chorus is totally different. There is no trace of \"Erotic, Erotic, put your hands all over my body\" that we all know so well. Instead madonna sings a different line with a different melody in the same type of voice. She sings, \"You are who your are (and I) wouldn't want to change a thing (in spite of) all the pain that love can bring (tell me) what can I do? I'm so in love with yooouuuuu thrill me, surround me you fill me....you send me...you put me in a trance...you fill me, inside me you take me....you thrill me, you put me in a trance...\" At another time she says \"you upset me\". The word \"Erotica\" appears only in the intro. This is a darker S&M theme than the version that became the final cut. The instrumentation is approximately the same, but everything is mixed in a different proportion than the released version. This makes it sound kind of odd, and it's a little more generic sounding. The released mix is more unique sounding, more exotic.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------ --\n\n1992 THIEF OF HEARTS (Alternate mixes, PAu-605-643). Bruce Baron notes that this song was not part of his original request of songs to listen to, but was included on the same tapes as some of those that he did request. It was a nice surprise to find. These alternate mixes are not that different from the released verions. It does seem to be a different vocal take. Some of the backing vocals are in a different proportion which sounds kind of funny. This is common on several of the \"Rain tape\" demos. It's kind of like when comparing Shep's released remixes of \"Rescue Me\" when he reverses the dominance of the high vocal part and the low vocal part from one mix to the other. Most of the difference is in the arrangement of the intro, the middle break and the ending. In one version the Madonna spoken \"sit your ass down\" ending is at the begining. In another mix that line is at the end like we are used to, but it is spoken by the voice of a southern black woman (probably a sample from a movie). The recordings of this song have way too much input on the copyright demo and there is a lot of distortion on this copy. The scale was way into the red. It's probably not from the master tape, just the way it was copied. The \"new music\", \"old music\" descriptions on the title card on two of the mixes didn't sound all that different from eachother to me. The changes were subtle. It could have been labeled incorrectly?\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------ --\n\n1992 EATING OUT Unconfirmed outtake of released \"Where Life Begins\" aka \"Out To Lunch\" Media Rumor. Supposedly, \"Out To Lunch\" was the original title of the \"Erotica\" song \"Where Life Begins\". A later title for the song was \"Eating Out\" (as mentioned in 'Smash Hits' magazine). The original version of \"Out To Lunch\" was said to be about lesbian lust so could be quite different to the used version of \"Where Life Begins\".\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------ --\n\n1992 FREAK \"Erotica\" album outtake. Media rumor.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------ --\n\n1992 GOODBYE TO INNOCENCE - PAu-1-605-640. Bruce Baron writes: The versions submitted by Shep Pettibone on the \"Rain\" demo tapes are TOTALLY, TOTALLY different from the release versions that we know of from the \"Just Say Roe\" collection, and the \"Rain\" B-side remix - TOTALLY different !! They are better !! This was a great surprise because it was not one of the recordings I requested to pull! The released versions sounded dated back at the time of release with 80's house being taken over by harder techno like \"James Brown Is Dead\" in American clubs at the time. It's also hard to understand the words that Madonna is singing. The demo versions use the same theme and many of the same lyrics, but everything is switched around. It's a different vocal recording (strong and clear). Much of the song's melody is different including the chorus. The arrangement is pure pop-funk-dance, no club remix style here. It's very catchy ! It could use a little fixing here and there, but when I heard it, I couldn't believe that they didn't finish it up and use it on the album. Madonna is credited for words alone, and Pettibone/Shimkin are credited for music alone as is the rest of the \"Rain\" demo collection.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------ --\n\n1992 LOVE HURTS Unconfirmed early version of \"Erotica\" with different lyrics produced with Junior Vasquez. From what I've heard, the track is called \"Love Hurts\" and all the music is different -- except the verses are the same as \"Erotic\" (the Sex book version). The chorus is \"Love Hurts, Love Hurts...Do you remember the time, Love Hurts, Love Hurts, when we -- fell in love...\" (or something like that.). Then she does this sing-songy \"La-Da-Da-Dee-Da-Da-Da-Da-Da...\" I'm sure it'll never see the light of day, which is a shame because it sounds pretty cool.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------ --\n\n1992 NO ENTRY Unconfirmed throw-a-way from \"Erotica\" album. Supposedly, Madonna recorded this before the \"Erotica\" album and she is said to have even made a video with Patrick Swayze and Michael J.Fox. The song was dropped after the \"Erotica/Sex/Body Of Evidence\" project got under the way. It was due for Christmas release. One source claims that a 15-track promo-CD album for \"Erotica\" exists, and contains this track, but was never officially released, not even to promote the EROTICA album. A 15-track \"Erotica\" album is physically imposible though, because the 13-track (\"clean\" version) has a total disc time of 70:30, and the 14-track \"nasty\" version (with \"Did You Do It?\") has a total disc time of 75:24). Since the maximum recording time on a CD is 74 minutes (even though some albums out there, such as the 14-track \"Erotica\" push the limits by a minute or two, it is physically impossible for a 15th track to fit on this album, unless it was literally 30 or 40 seconds in length, which doesn't make sense. And 80-minute CDs didn't \"come out\" until years later. Anyhow, this song (\"No Entry\") was supposedly meant to be released on the \"Erotica\" album, but it was rejected or deleted at the very last minute before the release of promos. If this CD really does exist, it would most likely be the all-time rarest and most valuable Madonna CD - EVER!\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------ --\n\n1992 DEAR FATHER \"Dear Father\" is confirmed (yes that old rumor) to exist as an unreleased co-write with Andre Betts (Erotica period). Not to be confused with the Like A Prayer era \"Oh Father\".\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------ --\n\n1992 QUEENS PEARLS Unconfirmed early version of \"Queens English\" recorded by Luis & Jose and released w/ Madonna backing vocals. Media rumor.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------ --\n\n1992 SHOW AND TELL Unconfirmed throw-a-way from \"Erotica\" album. Media rumor. However, Peter Magennis <peter_magennis@hotmail.com> mentions that in 1992, NME magazine had a two-part interview for the release of 'Erotica'. The journalist visited Madonna at her New York apartment and listened to some tracks from the (then still unreleased) album. One of the tracks was confirmed as 'Show And Tell' and was described as a ballad. Perhaps it didn't finish up on the album because it didn't fit the mood. Madonna can be very selective and quality tracks can be easily discarded if they don't fit in with the tone of the album. A prime example of her rejection of recorded songs is her last album 'Music' as confirmed by William Orbit and Madonna herself. So perhaps this is what happened with 'Show And Tell'. This is a pity as Madonna obviously liked it enough to chose it as one of the few taster tracks for the lucky journalist.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------ --\n\n1992 THESE BOOTS ARE MADE FOR WALKIN Rumoured Nancy Sinatra Madonna cover circa 1992, demo existance not confirmed, possibly produced with Patrick Leonard. Media rumor.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------ --\n\n1992 THIS USED TO BE MY PLAYGROUND According to a Shep Pettibone interview, Madonna did a second vocal at the last minute, leaving the 1st version unreleased.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------ --\n\n1992 THROB Unused throw-a-way from \"Erotica\" album (existence unconfirmed). Supposedly Written and Produced by Madonna and Shep Pettibone. News of this track surfaced around the same time as the \"No Entry\" track but again it was not released or put on the \"Erotica\" album. Chances of a release now are unlikely because of Janet Jackson stole the title for a track on her latest album. It had been strongly denied by Janet Jackson that she stole the whole song from Madonna and insists that she wrote her own version.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------ --\n\n1992 JITTERBUG - Bruce Baron recently listened to this track at the Library of Congress, and he notes that JITTERBUG has no official copyright registration This one was a major surprise !! In addition to the songs I requested, the tape contained alternate mixes of several songs (to be discussed later) and about 30 sec to the end of a song called JITTERBUG. It was mostly taped over, but showed up between two of the tracks. It is listed on the handwritten label to the whole tape, but it has no copyright registration of it's own. No song writer is listed. It was originally spelled with a \"G\", but was written over darker with a \"J\" in blue ink. It's typical generic Shep dance music with Madonna finishing up with \"Jitterbug, Jitterbug\". Perhaps it's a cover ? There is not enough to tell... She stops but the music continues. She says \"Ya that one has some good ideas to it\". The music continues, and she says \"How long is this one going to go on\"?. The music continues and she say \"Isn't anyone going to turns this damn thing off\"? It abruptly ends. It seems to just silly studio fun, and not really \"Erotica\" album material but there was more before Shep recorded over it. He might have a longer copy on file ?\n\n1990\n\nMay 27-29, 1990: The backing track for \"Thief of Hearts\" can be heard coming from a tape player briefly in Truth Or Dare during the backstage Toronto footage. The intro can be heard briefly in \"Truth Or Dare\" movie at the part when Madonna's brother goes to her to inform about the Canadian Police in Toronto being there to arrest her.\n\nFall (probably late November): Judith Regan, an editor at Simon & Schuster/Pocket Books has an idea for a book of erotica and sexual fantasies which she felt would be ideal for Madonna. She sends an imaginative box of material to Freddy DeMannâ€™s office in which includes erotic photos and the kind of text she thought would be appropriate. In a matter of weeks, Regan scores a meeting with Madonna and Freddy DeMann in his Los Angeles office. In the meeting, Madonna demands 100% control over the project and says she will not even think of doing it if it was already offered to another celebrity. She is quoted as saying, \"It has to be unique to me.\" By the end of the meeting, Madonna agrees to do the book, â€œin principleâ€ and they agree to call it: Madonnaâ€™s Book of Erotica and Sexual Fantasies. Six months later, Regan learns Madonna has used her very same pitch to secure a deal with Warner Books for the same concept. (paraphrased from Madonna: An Intimate Biography by J. Randy Taraborrelli who interviewed Judith Regan) https://books.google.com/books?id=yj1PTnse9-gC&pg=PA221&lpg=PA221&dq=Madonna%E2%80%99s+Book+of+Erotica+and+Sexual+Fantasies&source=bl&ots=nprpqecJaJ&sig=uxkd4vu8qx4EOETDxgk03Wl7nqA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjOj6qwpZrVAhXCbT4KHbnsDMMQ6AEIRDAG#v=onepage&q=Madonna%E2%80%99s%20Book%20of%20Erotica%20and%20Sexual%20Fantasies&f=false\n\nLATER:\n\nIn an interview to promote Erotica with the UK's Jonathan Ross (in November 1992), she admits that soon after \"Justify My Love\" was released, she received several offers to write erotic prose for a book.\n\n1991\n\nMarch: Madonna does an interview with Carrie Fisher for the June 13, 1991 issue of Rolling Stone. In the interview, she mentions she is using the nickname 'Dita' which will later become her persona for the album. The name is drawn from a German actress, Dita Parlo, who gain fame starring in German and French films in the 1930's.\n\nhttp://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/carrie-fisher-interviews-madonna-about-men-sex-drugs-death-w457927\n\nShe also does a photoshoot with Steven Meisel which may serve as a dry-run of sorts for the\n\nSEX\n\nbook. This is what was written about the photospread for RS:\n\nThe pictorial, \"Flesh and Fantasy,\" casts Madonna as a seductive member of the Paris demimonde of the '30s. Inspired by the work of Brassai, the pictures show bordello scenes, cross-dressing, women lying together and kissing. These are, according to Brassai, \"The Secret Paris\" and his pictures of these subjects were not published until the '70s. Unfortunately, these scenes of a hidden alternative are not presented as a part of the history of sexual minorities, although most of us would identify them as such. Instead, according to Madonna, \"It was a great chance to re-create an era that I feel I would have really flourished in, that nothing I would have done would have been censored.\" This statement is certainly mysterious. First, how could Madonna be more accepted than she already is? Second, this is certainly a romanticized view of the culture of Paris in the '30s, which marginalized rather than accepted the behaviors of the underworld members portrayed by Brassai. However problematic the motivations, the pictures are charming and I still give Madonna points for yet another great performance.\n\nMarch 20: (20) USA TODAY: Madonna and Michael Team Up\n\nCall it Blond Ambition meets the Man in the Mirror.\n\nMadonna and Michael Jackson have decided to mix their professional magnetism. â€œThey're working on a musical project,â€ say Madonna's spokeswoman Liz Rosenberg.\n\nRecord? Video? Concert?\n\nâ€œI can't elaborate,'' Rosenberg says. They don't even know if they'll work for her label, or his.\n\nThey have been friends for a long time, Rosenberg says, but the decision to mesh musicalities was â€œfairly recent.â€\n\nSaturday night, the duo was spotted having dinner together at Los Angeles' Ivy restaurant.\n\nJackson is ``just finishing'' his long-overdue album, says his manager Bob Jones, who expects it in stores by June. Could Madonna be in there? ``If (he) comes up with something great, it could be,'' Jones says.\n\nMay 7: From an interview with The Advocate to promote Truth or Dare:\n\nhttps://allaboutmadonna.com/madonna-library/madonna-interview-advocate-may-7-1991\n\nMADONNA: I keep telling Michael Jackson, \"I'd love to turn Jose and Luis on you for a week (her lead dancers Jose Gutierez and Luis Camacho).\" They pull you out of the shoe box you're in. Anybody who's in a shoe box in the closet cannot be in one after hanging around with Luis and Jose. Or me, for that matter.\n\nI have this whole vision about Michael. We're considering working on a song together. I would like to completely redo his whole image, give him a Caesar - you know, that really short haircut - and I want to get him out of those buckled boots and all that stuff. What I want him to do is go to New York and hang out for a week with the House of Xtravaganza {a group of drag queen performers and their coterie}. They could give him a new style. I've already asked Jose and Luis if they would do it. They're thrilled and ready.\n\nDon Shewey: Is he up for it?\n\nMADONNA: I don't know. He's up for a couple of things that surprise me. The thing is, I'm not going to get together and do some stupid ballad or love duet - no one's going to buy it, first of all. I said, \"Look, Michael, if you want to do something with me, you have to be willing to go all the way or I'm not going to do it.\" He keeps saying yes . . .\n\nMay 15: Any musical collaboration between Madonna and Michael Jackson reportedly is off. \"He ran away from me,\" the Material Girl told reporters Monday at the Cannes Film Festival. \"When I was 8 or so, I wanted to be Michael Jackson. Not the Michael Jackson that we know now.\"\n\nMay 25: He [shep Pettibone] is mulling over offers to write and produce songs for several platinum artists, as he is slated to work on forth-coming albums by Madonna and Liza Minelli. The future looks bright. (Billboard)\n\nJuly 8: Shep Pettibone began putting tracks together with his assistant Tony Shimkin. Today, he gives Madonna a cassette of three songs (instrumental demos) when he visits her in Chicago (where she is filming A League of Their Own). Madonna listens to the material and calls him a few days later to say she likes all three songs â€“ so he decides to work on more. (The Erotica Diaries, Shep Pettibone) https://allaboutmadonna.com/madonna-library/madonna-erotica-diaries-shep-pettibone-icon-magazine-1992'>https://allaboutmadonna.com/madonna-library/madonna-erotica-diaries-shep-pettibone-icon-magazine-1992'>https://allaboutmadonna.com/madonna-library/madonna-erotica-diaries-shep-pettibone-icon-magazine-1992\n\nLATER: These 3 songs were probably \"Erotica,\" \"Deeper and Deeper\" and/or \"Rain\" or \"Thief of Hearts.\" At least judging by Shep's later comments that those were the first songs they did together.\n\nShep: I remember when Madonna and I first started working together on Erotica. We were listening in my home studio to one of the first songs and I turned to her and said Itâ€™s great, but itâ€™s no Vogue. She told me that not every song could be Vogue â€“ not every cut could emerge as the top-selling record of all time. She was right, but I pressed my case anyway: I guess Iâ€™m always trying to out-top myself, I told her, the next thing should be bigger than the last. Madonna just turned and looked me straight in the eye. It had been a long time since Iâ€™d been star-struck by her, but she was glowing differently now. Shep, she began, no matter how fierce something is, you canâ€™t ever do the same thing twice. She sat down to record the final vocals on Erotica and looked out onto the terrace and into the New York City night. Ever, she repeated.\n\nThe Erotica Diary (July-August 1991)\n\nhttps://allaboutmadonna.com/madonna-library/madonna-erotica-diaries-shep-pettibone-icon-magazine-1992\n\nI wanted to start writing again. The last project I had worked on with Madonna was The Immaculate Collection but that was just a month and a half of working with that QSound stuff. I knew I could do something great after Vogue and Rescue Me so I just started putting tracks together with my assistant, Tony Shimkin. I wanted to have a few songs for Madonna to listen to when I went out to Chicago, were she was filming A League Of Their Own. I had no idea that she was planning to do an album at that time, but then again, neither did she. I arrived in Chicago on July 8th and gave Madonna a cassette. I told her to give it a listen and tell me what she thought. She said sheâ€™d listen to it in the car, in the trailer, wherever she could. A few days later, I heard back from her. Madonna liked all the songs â€“ three out of three. I decided to work on a few more.\n\nUsually, when I sit down to write, it isnâ€™t as if I have a specific person in mind for any one song. By the time I get to a certain place in the music, it begins to mold itself an identity and I think, Hey, this person would like that. At the time, Cathy Dennis, Taylor Dayne, or Madonna were the primary inspirations for a variety of songs.\n\nOct 9: Truth Or Dare is released on home video.\n\nOct 27: Madonna wins Best Female Solo Singer and Most Fanciable Female at the 4th annual Smash Hits Awards in London, England.\n\nOct 30: Madonna completes filming A League Of Their Own in Evansville, IN.\n\nOct 31: Madonna attends Sandra Bernhard's Halloween show in NYC. She has just returned from filming in Indiana today.\n\nMadonna returns to NYC and she begins working on demos with Shep in his apartment/penthouse studio. Their initial work is sporadic as Madonna would work with Pettibone for a week and then go off with Steven Meisel to work on her SEX book. Occasionally, she meets with AndrÃ© Betts, her co-producer on â€œJustify My Love.â€ (The Erotica Diaries, Shep Pettibone) -\n\nShep indicates they started working in October, but all the press reports I dug up indicate Madonna was in Evansville, Indiana for the entire month - except for a few days around October 12 when she attended a wedding of her accountant, Allen Grubman, in NYC.\n\nLATER: Madonna does a unreleased demo called â€œYou Thrill Meâ€ with Shep Pettibone that winds up being an alternate version of â€œErotica.â€ An acappella version of the demo vocals will surface on the Internet later on.\n\nMadonna also did a demo called â€œLove Hurtsâ€ with Junior Vasquez (a protÃ©gÃ© of Shep Pettibone) which contains similar lyrical content as â€œEroticaâ€ and is an early version of that recording. Madonna reportedly intended to work with Vasquez as a producer on this album but changed her mind to Shep Pettibone for unknown reasons.\n\nThe Erotica Diary (October-November 1991)\n\nhttps://allaboutmadonna.com/madonna-library/madonna-erotica-diaries-shep-pettibone-icon-magazine-1992\n\nMadonna returned to New York and we began to work on demos in my apartment. Itâ€™s cool working at home. Itâ€™s convenient, cozy and thereâ€™s no studio time ticking by. Plus, if you wake up in the middle of the night and have an idea, you just go upstairs, turn on the equipment, and go. Our schedule was kind of sporadic in the beginning. Iâ€™d work with her for a week and then sheâ€™d go off to work with Steve Meisel on her book (Sex) for two weeks. Occasionally, Madonna would meet with Andre Betts, her co-producer on Justify My Love. While she was away, I would spend time coming up with other tracks or work on Cathy Dennis and Taylor Dayne material. At this point, I wasnâ€™t working on any remixes â€“ just writing.\n\nDeeper and Deeper, Erotica, Rain and Thief of Hearts made up the first batch of songs we worked on together. I did the music and she wrote the words. Sometimes Iâ€™d give her some ideas lyrically and sheâ€™d go: Oh, thatâ€™s good, or That sucks. I remember when I gave her some ideas lyrically for Vogue and she said, very curtly, Thatâ€™s what I do. Essentially, her songs are her stories. Theyâ€™re the things she wants to say.\n\nI did everything upstairs in my home studio: keyboards, bass lines, and vocals. Depending on the mood I was in, I chose from an Oberheim OB8, Korg M3, or a Roland D-50. On the sampling side, the Akai S1000 was our prime workhorse. We used it to sample snake charms for Words and Kool & The Gang horns for Erotica.\n\nWhen it came time to record demos, we laid down a track of SMPTE on the last track of my 8-track Tascam 388 Studio 8 reel-to-reel, which has dbx. Usually weâ€™d put the track down on tracks 1 and 2 in a stereo mix, and then bring Madonnaâ€™s vocals in on 3 through 7 â€“ a lead, a double lead, the harmonies, and the background parts. Ninety-eight percent of the time, the vocals recorded in my apartment were the keeper vocals, the ones you hear on the album. It took about two or three days to write a song from beginning to end. Still, sometimes even after they were done weâ€™d want to change the flow of the song and ask the song a few questions: Where should the chorus hit? Should it be a double chorus? Sometimes Madonna would call me in the middle of the night and say Shep, I think the chorus should go like this, or I hate this verse, fix the bass line. Deeper and Deeper was one of those songs she always had a problem with. The middle of the song wasnâ€™t working. We tried different bridges and changes, but nothing worked. In the end, Madonna wanted the middle of the song to have a flamenco guitar strumming big-time. I didnâ€™t like the idea of taking a Philly house song and putting La Isla Bonita in the middle of it. But thatâ€™s what she wanted, so thatâ€™s what she got.\n\nNovember 3: While shooting her MTV 10 spot in Los Angeles with Alek Keshishian, Madonna does a brief interview with Australian Molly Meldrum. In the interview, Madonna says of starting a new album:\n\nâ€œWell, Iâ€™m gonna go to New York next week and start writing again. Thank God. Iâ€™ve missed it.â€\n\nNovember 13: Madonna records the final demo for â€œDeeper & Deeperâ€ and new vocals for the first demo of â€œRainâ€ today with Shep Pettibone.

(this could be when she decides to use the space for her upcoming book or maybe she was scouting locations).\n\n(sometime in November): The Erotica Diary (October-November 1991)\n\nShep says Deeper and Deeper, Erotica, Rain and Thief of Hearts made up the first batch of songs they worked on together.\n\nHe says they sampled horns from Kool & the Gang for â€œEroticaâ€ and snake charms for \"Words.\"\n\nShep says Madonna always had a problem with â€œDeeper & Deeper.â€ They tried different bridges and changes but nothing worked. In the end, Madonna wanted a flamenco guitar in the middle of the song â€“ a decision Shep did not like as he felt the tune should stay â€œa Philly house song.â€ (The Erotica Diaries, Shep Pettibone)\n\nNovember 23: Madonna is named Most Popular International Solo Female Artist at the 1st annual Australian Music Awards.\n\nNovember 27: Madonna contributes a pre-taped monologue on ABC-TV special MTV 10.\n\nThe Erotica Diary (December 1991)\n\nhttps://allaboutmadonna.com/madonna-library/madonna-erotica-diaries-shep-pettibone-icon-magazine-1992\n\nI hate them. Thatâ€™s what she said to me when we listened to the first bunch of songs weâ€™d recorded. I thought it sounded great beacause some of the songs had a New York house sound and some of them had an L.A. vibe. If I had wanted the album to sound like that, Iâ€™d have worked with Patrick Leonard in L.A., she told me. I got the point pretty fast. Madonna wanted Erotica to have a raw edge to it, as if it were recorded in an alley at 123rd street in Harlem. She didnâ€™t want some light glossy production to permeate her sound. I got back into my usual style of mixing, which is pretty bass oriented, analog, hit-you-over-the head kind of stuff. When youâ€™re recording songs for Madonna, the attitude is: Either make a song work, or itâ€™s not going to be on the album. Thetâ€™s that.\n\nTypically, Madonna would get over to my place by one in the afternoon and weâ€™d work until eigth or nine at night. Improvising vocals took one or two passes and by the time the third pass came around, sheâ€™d get on the mic and say Letâ€™s go. Madonna has an incredible mind; she locks the melody into her head and memorizes the words immediately. She doesenâ€™t even have to read the words off the paper when sheâ€™s singing.\n\nThe only problems were during sequencing, when we had to do something on the Mac that would take some time. Two minutes into it, Madonna would ask us: What are you guys doing thatâ€™s taking so long! â€“ and this was just after the first few minutes. Weâ€™d tell her to go downstairs and make some popcorn or phone calls so that we could put the song together and sheâ€™d do that for about five minutes before screaming: Come on, guys, Iâ€™m getting bored! I had to keep things moving as fast as possible beacause itâ€™s one of my jobs to keep Madonna from losing interest in what sheâ€™s doing. As far as the music went, it was getting a little melancholy by that point. It definitely wasnâ€™t up-and-happy music. Maybe I inspired songs like In This Life and Bad Girl beacause they were written in a minor key. But Madonnaâ€™s stories were getting a lot more serious and intense and she was definitely driving the creative direction of the songs into deeply personal territory.\n\nDecember 4: The Immaculate Collection is certified 3x platinum (3 million units). A rumor is announced that Madonna has tested HIV positive for AIDS: a statement denying the rumor is released by her representatives.\n\nDecember 6: Today, Madonna records final demo vocals and new harmonies for â€œRain.â€ (The Rain Tapes)\n\nmid-December: Madonna ends up disliking the first bunch of songs recorded. Shep says he liked them because some tracks had a NY house sound and others had an L.A. vibe. Madonna didnâ€™t want the L.A. vibe â€“ she wanted a raw sound. She wanted it to sound like it was recorded in an alley at 123rd St. in Harlem. She didnâ€™t want any glossy production. Shep went back to his usual style of mixing â€“ bass-oriented, analog, hit-you-over-the-head stuff.\n\nHe says that Madonna was coming over to his apartment by 1PM and they would work until 8 or 9PM. During the sequencing (putting the song together) Madonna would get very impatient and yell at Shep. He recalls that this was about the time the music he was writing became more melancholy and written in minor keys â€“ songs like â€œBad Girlâ€ and â€œIn This Life.â€ He also says Madonna was driving the creative direction into personal and intense territory. (The Erotica Diaries, Shep Pettibone)\n\nDecember 8: In a TV Guide magazine interview, Madonna causes a controversy when she complains about filming A League Of Their Own in Evansville, IN: she calls the town \"boring\", complains that the house she rented didn't have cable and says, \"I may as well have been in Prague\" - the citizens of Evansville are enraged by her comments: 300 townspeople gather in a parking lot to spell her name inside a circle with a line through it and send her a televised message: \"Madonna, get a life!\".\n\nDecember 10: Madonna is honored with the Award Of Courage by the American Foundation For AIDS Research (AMFAR) at a Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel dinner, Beverly Hills, CA.\n\nDecember 23: What Madonna did for vogueing, she may soon do for stripping.\n\nEarly next month, the superstar films her next music video - in Times Square's Gaiety Male Burlesk Theater, with the X-rated guys doing PG versions of their stage acts.\n\nâ€œThree weeks ago on a Friday night, Madonna went to the Gaiety and was entranced - she stayed and watched for three hours,'' says Ken Graziano, one- half of the gay performance duo, Bone Boyz.\n\nâ€œStrippers are very in vogue right now,â€ he says.\n\nThe Bone Boyz, based in Miami, were hired to coordinate last week's stripper auditions at the Gaiety. â€œWe had to have 25 guys there at 10 a.m. for (fashion photog) Stephen Meisel and (Madonna's Truth or Dare director) Alek Keshishian,'' adds Scott Drnaerz, the other Boyz.\n\nâ€œThey were looking for guys who had the best act in terms of costume, dancing ability and specific burlesque routine, not necessarily the best bodies,'' Graziano says. â€œMost of them were Latin go-go boys. It was easily the most exciting thing that's ever happened to them.'' (USA Today)\n\nDecember 25: Shep spends Christmas vacation in Jamaica. (The Erotica Diaries, Shep Pettibone)\n\n1992\n\nIn 1992, Madonna founded her own multi-media entertainment company, Maverick, consisting of a record company (Maverick Records), a film production company (Maverick Films), and associated music publishing, television broadcasting, book publishing and merchandising divisions. The deal was a joint venture with Time Warner and paid Madonna an advance of $60 million. It gave her 20% royalties from the music proceedings, one of the highest rates in the industry, equaled at that time only by Michael Jackson's royalty rate established a year earlier with Sony. Madonna said that she envisioned the company as an \"artistic think tank\" and likened it to a cross between the Bauhaus, the innovative German arts institute formed in Weimar in 1919, and Andy Warhol's New York-based Factory of artists and assistants. She stated: \"It started as a desire to have more control. There's a group of writers, photographers, directors and editors that I've met along the way in my career who I want to take with me everywhere I go. I want to incorporate them into my little factory of ideas. I also come in contact with a lot of young talent that I feel entrepreneurial about.\" The first two projects from the venture were her fifth studio album, Erotica, and a coffee table book of photographs featuring Madonna, entitled Sex.\n\nJanuary: Madonna and photographer Steven Meisel begin work on a book of erotica and sexual fantasies in Miami, FL.\n\nJanuary 2: Pettibone returns from vacation in Jamaica with a reggae sound in his head. He put it down on tape and Madonna took to it â€“ this song became â€œWhyâ€™s It So Hard?â€\n\nWhen the song was completed they had the idea of bringing in a Jamaican rapper to do some stuff on the record. They found a guy named Jamaiki who ran a Jamaican record store uptown. He was this big guy with real deep-ass voice. When we they trying to explain the song to him, he just looked at them and said, \"Do you have any rum, man?\" By the time Jamaiki was laying down the tracks in my studio, he was dancing around swigging rum and spilling it everywhere. They ended up not using the track beacause it sounded too rough for the song. (The Erotica Diaries, Shep Pettibone)\n\nJanuary 11: Madonna is involved in another project with her photographer that reportedly seeks to reveal more of her inner secrets -- Entertainment Weekly says the collaboration is rumored to be an illustration of Madonna's sexual fantasies. (Miami Herald)\n\nJanuary 15-16: Madonna records the final demo vocals for â€œErotica.â€ (the Rain Tapes)\n\nShooting Madonna: Is Madonna playing truth or dare again? We hear her next stab at attention-grabbing headlines will be with a book of pornography that she's collaborating on with photographer Steven Meisel. \"It's definitely hard-core,\" one source said. Meisel and Madonna have been working on the book for the past couple of months. (Last week, they reportedly took over the male theater, The Gaiety, for a shoot.) \"There was one image,\" we're told, \"that was shot with a knife at Madonna's vagina.\" \"Was she wearing the nun's habit?\" spokeswoman Liz Rosenberg asked. Then she said: \"Madonna and Steven are working together on a series of portraits of personalities from the past. What form it's going to take has not been determined. It may be a book, it may be a magazine layout.\" Yes, and about the pornography? \"I just don't know,\" Rosenberg said. \"I haven't been at the shoots.\" In the meantime, Madonna was on her way to a recording studio - or was it a photo shoot? - the other day when fans, two boys and a girl who were stationed outside her apartment, followed her limo in a cab. (Inside New York, Jan. 15 edition)\n\nJanuary 17: Madonna, who trades in nothing if not shock, is involved in a photo project designed to \"turn on the Sapphic and sadomasochistic sets,\" reports the New York Post. In one scene, Madonna supposedly is tied to a chair while two confederates cut off her duds and do unmentionable things with a knife. The paper says the pop star is having secret sessions with fashion photog Steven Meisel that feature whips and chains and all those things. (Liz Smith)\n\nJanuary 21: A lawsuit is filed against Madonna by 3 ex-dancers: Oliver Crumes, Kevin Stea and Gabriel Trupin - they are charging her with invasion of privacy, fraud and deceit, intentional misrepresentation, suppression of fact, and intentional infliction of emotional distress for exposing their private lives in her 1991 film documentary Truth Or Dare.\n\nThe Erotica Diary (January-February 1992)\n\nhttps://allaboutmadonna.com/madonna-library/madonna-erotica-diaries-shep-pettibone-icon-magazine-1992\n\nI spent the Christmas on vacation in Jamaica and when I got back on January 2, I was like Oh man, I am not ready for this. There were a lot of intense songs to work on for Madonna, but all I had was this reggae-ish vibe going around in my head. Jamaica had really had an impact on me. I put the vibe down on tape and played it for Madonna, who immediately took to it. Once she got all the lyrics down, the song became Why Is It So Hard.\n\nAfter it was done we thought: How about if we get a male Jamaican rapper in here to do some stuff on the record? We found this guy, Jamaiki, who runs a jamaican record store uptown. He was this big guy with real deep-ass voice. When we were trying to explain the song to him, he just looked at us and said, Do you have any rum, man? By the time Jamaiki, was laying down the tracks in my studio, he was dancing around swigging rum and spilling it everywhere. We ended up not using the track beacause it sounded to rough for the song, but it was a very fun day â€“ completely different.\n\nBy this point, people had begun to realize that Madonna was recording in my penthouse. All her fans would wait outside, even though it was freezing, just to catch a glimpse of her or take a picture. One particular day, when I walked her down to her car, the lobby was filled with building residents getting the mail, hanging out at the front desk, sitting on benches. It was weird beacause usually the place is empty. After I walked her outside and ran across the street to get the dayâ€™s newspaper, I came back to find nobody there. People were comming downstairs to the lobby just to get a look at her, even if it was out of the corners of their eyes.\n\nFebruary 11: Shep Pettibone registered a number of songs with the U.S. copyright office today. The 2 tapes he submitted was titled â€˜The Rain Albumâ€™ and featured â€œRain,â€ â€œWordsâ€ and â€œThief of Hearts.â€ The song â€œWordsâ€ was originally called â€œActions Speakâ€¦â€ and had several different mixes and incarnations. One mix did not feature the Indian-sounding instrument on the released version, and instead used guitar. Also, synth keys (used at the end of the song) were repeated in the chorus. The lyrics also included: â€œYour love is for foolsâ€ and â€œYouâ€™re so cruel.â€ The vocal is different than the one on the album release, so they must have been re-recorded at some point.\n\nThe songs were all created in late 1991.\n\nTape# 1\n\n1) Rain (final demo w/new harms) 12/6/91 5:14\n\n2) Rain (new vocal) 11/13/91 5:27\n\n3) Deeper And Deeper (final demo) 11/13/91 5:29\n\n4) Bye Bye Baby (first day ruff) 5:44\n\n5) Bye Bye Baby (second day ruff)\n\n6) You Are The One (final edit demo) 4:15\n\n7) Shame (final demo) 4:30\n\n8) Shame (straight pass) 6:02\n\n9) In This Life (edit) 6:29\n\n10) Cheat(Drunk Girl) edit 6:15--------------------------------this became â€œBad Girlâ€ most likely\n\n11) Goodbye To Innocence (final edit) 5:25\n\n12) Goodbye To Innocence (straight pass) 6:00\n\n13) Goodbye To Innocence (madedit/Sheps neck(choice)5:22\n\n14) Actions Speak Louder Than Words (final edit)\n\n15) Erotica (final demo) 1/16/92 5:05\n\nTape# 2\n\n1) Actions Speak Louder Than Words (1st day)\n\n2) Actions Speak Louder Than Words (final edit)\n\n3) Erotica (rough mix) 1/15/92\n\n4) Erotica (final demo) 1/16/92\n\n5) Thief Of Hearts 1/17/92\n\n6) Jitterbug 1/17/92\n\n7) Thief Of Hearts (new music) 1/20/92\n\n8) Thief Of Hearts (old music again) 1/22/92\n\nS.Pettibone/M. Ciccone/T.Shimkin - Madonna is credited for all the lyrics on the tapes, while Shimkin/Pettibone are credited with the music.\n\nâ€œSHAMEâ€ - The totally unreleased song is from the \"Erotica\" sessions with Shep Pettibone. It's actually very good. It's similar in dance style to that of \"Deeper And Deeper\", and \"Vogue\", Perhaps a little slower.\n\nThis demo is high enough quality that it could have been sent to another artist to use (like \"Love Wont Wait\"). If it had been included on the album, it would have been too similar in sound to have enough variety on the album with the other tracks. I guess this made room for the Andre Betts collaborations.\n\nIn the song Madonna talks down to the object character of the song (or perhaps the listener). This is part of the developing Dita persona that we did not get to see. The song opens with a spoken intro:\n\n\"Look what you have done with your life, it's such a shame\".\n\nLater she says \"anyone can learn to fly\" as if she is asking why haven't you\n\nlearned yet ?\n\nShe also says \"you're the one to blame\".\n\nThe chorus starts with \"It's a Shaaaaaame\" which sounds an awful a lot like the song of the same title by Monie Love. This is probably the source of the old rumour that they were going to do something together. The similarity\n\nends there, and then it breaks off into it's own unique melody.\n\nGOODBYE TO INNOCENCE is completely different than the version released later as the B-side to â€œRain.â€ This original version is considered better. Itâ€™s pure pop-funk-dance and the vocal is stronger and the melody different. The theme is the same and many of the lyrics remain intact.\n\nEROTICA in its original version, contained the verse lyrics found in the â€œEroticâ€ song included with SEX. The choruses were also different using the â€œyou thrill me, fill me deep insideâ€ instead of â€œerotic, erotic put your hands all over my body.â€ The mix is more generic and the released version is definitely more exotic and unique.\n\nTHIEF OF HEARTS did not change too much from beginning to end of creation. The â€œsit your ass downâ€ line at the end of the song was originally used in the beginning and was a sample of a Southern black woman. There were also subtle modifications to the bridge.\n\nDEEPER & DEEPER: This track also did not change much from its original demo. The Spanish guitar bridge (which Madonna insisted upon) is not present and the song follows its typical house pattern. The demo version is a little longer with the ending lines slightly different.\n\nYOU ARE THE ONE: This demo is reportedly not that good and was abandoned for good reason. The music is very house/dance and remotely similar to the released version of GOODBYE TO INNOCENCE. The lyrics are forgettable â€“ â€œYou are the one for meâ€ and â€œI have chosen you.â€\n\nJITTERBUG: It's typical generic Shep dance music with Madonna finishing up with \"Jitterbug, Jitterbug\". Perhaps it's a cover? There is not enough to\n\ntell...\n\nShe stops but the music continues. She says \"Ya that one has some good ideas to it\". The music continues, and she says \"How long is this one going to go on\"?. The music continues and she say \"Isn't anyone going to turns this damn thing off\"? It abruptly ends.\n\nIt seems to just silly studio fun, and not really \"Erotica\" album material but there was more before Shep recorded over it.\n\n(Bruce Baron article)\n\nFebruary 14-16: Madonna is reportedly in Miami this weekend - with Vanilla Ice no less.

We had fifteen songs demoed and she liked them all. The last song we did was for the movie, A League Of Their Own. Madonna just started singing a melody over and over again into the Shure SM57 microphone while the Mac with Vision was playing strings, organ, piano and a basic rim-shot loop. It sounded really timeless, very nostalgic. I spent all night filling in the verses and the song became This Used To Be My Playground.\n\nThe day after Playground was finished, Madonna went to Oregon to work on her next film Body Of Evidence, with Willem Defoe. This gave me some time to wrap up some work on some songs with Cathy Dennis and Taylor Dayne at Soundworks Studios in New York. The workload had grown quite intense since the beginning of the year and it showed no signs of letting up. Thanks to my manager Jane Brinton, we were able to coordinate all the ongoing projects without a hitch.\n\nMarch: Pettibone knew by now that they were doing an album.

She works very hard, takes big risks and stays at the cutting edge of whatâ€™s happening.â€\n\nCharles Koppelman, the chief operating officer of EMI Records North America, had this to day:\n\nâ€œIf anyone is going to get a deal of this magnitude, she is the kind of artist to give it to, sheâ€™s the exception: someone who taps into artists and musical genres before the rest of the world does. In other deals where artists get their own labels, such perks are usually window dressing to satisfy their egos. Madonnaâ€™s different.

We had to record a string arrangement â€“ something I was excited about but had never done before. Madonna chose Jeremy Lubock to do the arrangements beacause he had done such a good job with her Iâ€™m Breathless Material and came highly recomended. Everything went fine until the point when the orchestra played their parts; we didnâ€™t like what we heard. Madonna and I had to change the whole arrangement, right there in the studio, with a full orchestra sitting there getting paid for taking up space â€“ around $15,000 for three hours, $3000 for every half hour over that. And of cource, Lubbock was talking to two people who didnâ€™t know a C from a B natural. The pressure was on.\n\nI can only sing the notes I hear at the moment, so thatâ€™s what I did. Madonna and I stood there over my little Mac, singing the notes, and Lubbock would go, Oh, thatâ€™s a G; Oh,thatâ€™s a B and thatâ€™s how it got done. We completed the session in 2 hours and 58 minutes â€“ two minutes away from another three grand. The last day of recording fell on Memorial day. Madonna wanted to do the lead vocals again, insisting that it would sound better. It did.

The orchestra cost $15,000 for the first 3 hours and $3,000 for each half hour after that â€“ the strings were done in 2 hours and 58 minutes.

(The Erotica Diaries, Shep Pettibone)\n\nJune 14: MADONNA INTERVIEW : YOU (JUNE 14 1992)\n\nJune 16: \"This Used to Be My Playground\" is the theme for the film A League of Their Own, which starred Madonna, and portrayed a fictionalized account of the real-life All-American Girls Professional Baseball League.\n\nMadonna was asked to record a song for the film's soundtrack. At that time she was busy recording her fifth studio album, Erotica, with producer Shep Pettibone. They had just completed working on the ballad \"Rain\". Madonna admitted that she did not have any material for the film and Lars explained that Marshall wanted only a ballad. Pettibone composed a track the same night and Madonna had some ideas she wanted to incorporate. During an interview with The Guardian, Madonna described the process as \"assignment writing\" since it was completely separate from her Erotica sessions. It took them two days to write and produce the song, and the final version was submitted to Marshall's team. Lars recalled that they \"immediately loved it... We all thought it would be a very successful record and we knew right away it would be perfect.\"\n\nOnce presented to director Penny Marshall's team, the song was released as a standalone single on June 16, 1992, by Warner Bros. Records. However, it was not available on the film's soundtrack due to contractual obligations and was later added to the Olympics-inspired Barcelona Gold compilation album, released that summer. The song was included on Madonna's 1995 ballads compilation Something to Remember.\n\nWritten and produced by Madonna and Pettibone, \"This Used to Be My Playground\" was the first time that Pettibone worked with live string arrangement. Madonna recorded the song on a Shure SM57 microphone, with instrumentation from piano, organ, strings and a basic drum sounds. During the final recording, the duo had to redo the whole orchestra section to tailor it for the song. \"This Used to Be My Playground\" starts with a keyboard introduction and strings, with Madonna singing in expressive but subdued vocals. Its verse and chorus merge into each other for having a continuity in the song, but the track ends abruptly. Lyrically it discusses visiting one's childhood places and not letting go of the past.\n\nRecording the track was a new experience for Pettibone since it was the first time that he worked with live musicians and arrangements. Pettibone took the demo of the song, and added live drums, piano and strings to it. They did not have any strings written originally for the song, and chose composer Jeremy Lubbock for the music arrangement; Lubbock had previously worked with Madonna on her soundtrack album I'm Breathless (1990). Madonna recorded the song on a Shure SM57 microphone, with the melody being played over and over again, accompanied by the piano, organ, strings and a basic rim-looping sound on a portable Macintosh computer. Pettibone spent the rest of the recording session working on the verses and final structure of \"This Used to Be My Playground\" was completed. The day after the song was finished, Madonna traveled to Oregon to work on her next film, Body of Evidence, giving Pettibone the time to finish off the songs for Erotica.\n\nThe duo met again in May 1992 at Oceanway Studios in Los Angeles to complete the orchestration of the song. Lubbock's arrangement was chosen for adding the final touches and the recording started. However, Madonna and Pettibone did not like the orchestra parts and wanted to redo the whole composition. The producer recalled, \"Madonna and I had to change the whole arrangement, right there in the studio, with a full orchestra sitting there getting paid for taking up spaceâ€”around $15,000 for three hours, $3000 for every half-hour over that. And of course, Lubbock was talking to two people who didn't know a C from a B natural. The pressure was on\". So they stood near Pettibone's Mac and sang the notes, with Lubbock correcting them. The total recording was finished off in 2 hours and 58 minutes, thereby saving to pay the orchestra the extra fees. The last recording of the song was on Memorial Day where Madonna re-did the lead vocals and improved them. Together they did some final edits of the track and finished it.\n\nJune 15: Shep does 8-track dumps with no time-code.

Madonna contributes a remixed version of \"Supernatural\" (originally released on B-side of \"Cherish\" single in 1989) to AIDS benefit CD Red Hot & Dance.\n\nThe accompanying music video, directed by Alek Keshishian, was filmed in June 1992 at Raleigh Studios in Hollywood, California and Malibu Beach. It premiered on MTV on June 30, 1992, a day before the release of A League of Their Own. The video shows a man viewing a photo album, as Madonna sings in different settings from within the various pictures. Scenes from A League of Their Own also appear on the album during the song's instrumental break. As the video ends, the man having reached the end of the album, then scrolls backwards through the previous pages. The video was commercially released in 2004 as a bonus feature on the 2-disc special edition DVD of A League of Their Own. According to Rettenmund, unlike most music videos related to film soundtracks, \"This Used to Be My Playground\" did not give emphasis on having shots from the film in the video itself. Instead Keshishian and Madonna chose introspection as the theme, with simple images to portray them. Rettenmund notes, \"At the end, the man who has been looking back at his scrapbook of Madonna lays his head down, sealing the video with the perfect bit of sadness to resonate with Madonna's ennui.\"\n\nThe video has been compared to Boy George's video for his 1987 single, \"To Be Reborn\", released less than five years before \"This Used to Be My Playground\". In George's video, he also appears on pages of a photo album, performing the song. George himself stated in his autobiography that he was \"furious\" after watching Madonna's video and renamed it \"This Used to Be My Video\"\n\nJune 30: The video for \"This Used to be My Playground\" debuts on MTV. Directed by Alek K.\n\nThe Erotica Diary (June-July 1992)\n\nhttps://allaboutmadonna.com/madonna-library/madonna-erotica-diaries-shep-pettibone-icon-magazine-1992\n\nThe schedule for recording at Soundworks in New York went something like this:\n\nJune 8 â€“ Erotica\n\nJune 9 â€“ Words; Whyâ€™s It So Hard\n\nJune 10 â€“ Whyâ€™s It So Hard; Thief Of Hearts\n\nJune 11 â€“ Thief Of Hearts; Goodbye To Innocence\n\nJune 15 â€“ 8-track dumps w/no time-code\n\nJune 16 â€“ Deeper And Deeper\n\nAnd so on, and so onâ€¦\n\nWe transferred everything we had on the Tascam 8-track onto 24-track. I decided to produce the tracks 15 ips with Dolby SR beacause it has this warm bottom in the bass and I wanted to capture that for Erotica. Plus, I was listening to some of my old remixes, which were recorded at 15 ips, and was amazed at how much more you could feel the music. Compact discs seem to move you one step away from the music, while records put you right in the mix. So I figured that if I overemphasized that LP feeling, it would rub off on the CD, which is the primary format manufactured for American audiences today. Strangely enough, our country canâ€™t get any LPâ€™s of Erotica, while the rest of the world can.\n\nOn July 7, we did the mixing for Erotic the ode to S & M that Madonna wanted to include in her book, Sex. She felt it should sound the same as Erotica (the song on the album), with just a bass line, her voice and some sensuous Middle Eastern sounds. But by then I had seen the book and had come up with an interesting idea.\n\nYou have all these great stories in the book, I told her, Why donâ€™t you use them in the song? I knew that Madonna was developing a 1930s dominatrix look for Erotica, but I didnâ€™t realize how far she was willing to go before I saw Sex. It contained stories authored by her mysteriously dark alter, Dita. Madonna took the book and walked out of the room and didnâ€™t come back until about half an hour later. Suddenly she was on the mic, speaking in this very dry voice. My name is Dita, she said, and Iâ€™ll be your mistress tonight. I knew that the original Erotica would never be the same again, and it wasnâ€™t. The chorus and bridge were changed entirely and the whole psyche of the song became sexier, more to the point. It seemed as if Dita brought out the best in her, actually serving as a vehicle for the dangerous territory she was traveling. Actually, it was the same name Madonna used when sheâ€™d stay in hotels around the world. Not anymore.\n\nWhen July 10 came, I felt my thirty-something years hit me full force. It was the day of reckoning â€“ my birthday, and yet I was stuck in the studio with Madonna, Tony Shimkin, and an animal-ballon-twisting clown to celebrate it with. It was fun for about five minutes, until Madonna said, Shep, you gotta get back to work.\n\nJuly 1: A League of Their Own is released nationwide.\n\nJuly 4: In the United States, \"This Used to Be My Playground\" debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 chart at number 35, for the week of July 4, 1992. The debut was aided by just airplay points which enabled it to enter the Hot 100 Airplay chart at number 14. The song received immediate heavy rotation in US radio stations like Hot 97 in New York and Wild 107 in San Francisco. One week later, the song jumped to number 17 on the Hot 100, having had the largest sales and airplay points of any record on the chart.\n\nIn Canada, the song debuted at number 60 on the RPM Top Singles chart on July 4, 1992. After seven weeks it reached the top of the chart and was present for a total of 19 weeks. It also reached number two on the RPM Adult Contemporary chart.\n\nJuly 7: Madonna contributes \"This Used To Be My Playground\" to Special Olympics benefit CD Barcelona Gold.\n\nJuly 7: Madonna & Pettibone did the mixing for â€œEroticâ€ the ode to S&M that Madonna wanted included in her Sex book. Madonna wanted it to sound just like â€œEroticaâ€ but just a bassline, her voice and some sensuous Middle Eastern sounds. Shep gave her the idea to use the ideas and stories in the book in the song and this is when Madonna started using â€œMy name is Dita, Iâ€™ll be your mistress tonight.â€ The chorus and bridge of the original changed completely. (The Erotica Diaries, Shep Pettibone)\n\nJuly 10: Today was Pettiboneâ€™s 30-something birthday and he spent it working in the studio with Madonna, Tony Shimkin and an animal-balloon-twisting clown.\n\nJuly 29: Liz Smith reports that Madonnaâ€™s new album will be titled Erotica.\n\nAugust 8: \"This Used To Be My Playground\" hits US #1.\n\nOn August 8, 1992, the song reached the top of the chart for one week, becoming Madonna's tenth number one single, breaking her tie with Whitney Houston as the female artist with the most number one singles at that time. The song replaced \"Baby Got Back\" by Sir Mix-a-Lot although it was number three on the Hot Singles Sales and Hot 100 Airplay charts. According to Michael Ellis from Billboard, the song edged out \"Baby Got Back\" by a small margin of chart points. The song spent a total of 20 weeks on the chart and ranked at number 21 on the Hot 100 year end chart for 1992.\n\n\"This Used to Be My Playground\" also reached peak positions of number two on the Hot 100 Airplay and number four on the Adult Contemporary charts.\n\nAugust 14: Madonna attends a Peggy Lee cabaret show at Club 53 in the NY Hilton tonight (Liz Smith).\n\nThe Erotica Diary (August 15, 1992, MOâ€™s Birthday)\n\nhttps://allaboutmadonna.com/madonna-library/madonna-erotica-diaries-shep-pettibone-icon-magazine-1992\n\nOne of the tracks, Godbye To Innocence, just wasnâ€™t working. There was something about the song that didnâ€™t grab Madonna, so we had to fix it. I worked overnight in my studio and came back to Soundworks with a brand new bass line that seemed to do the trick. Madonna put on headphones and got ready to lay down the vocals for Goodbye To Innocence. But instead of singing the original words, which were written last year, Madonna started toying with the lyrics, singing the words to the lounge-lizard act staple, Fever. At first we thought: This is cool, and it was. It sounded so good that we decided to take it one step further and actually cover the tune. Too bad no one knew the words. What we needed was a copy of Fever if we were going to record it that day. So, Madonna got on the phone with Seymour Stein at Sire Records, and within an hour, we had the lyric sheets, the Peggy Lee version, and the original version of the song in our hands. I was really impressed by how quickly we got it all. That was the last track on Erotica and we finished mixing it just in time to celebrate another birthday â€“ Madonnaâ€™s.\n\nThat night, she had a birthday party on a boat circling Manhattan. Picture about 50 people dancing on a boat with disco blasting out of the portholes and you get the idea. In between dancing and celebrating, I spent the time reflecting on the album. I was confident that it was a great compilation of songs, but I was wondering how people would react to it. It was definitely a different album for her in that it was a dance/pop album, instead of a guitar-laden pop album designed just for top 40. That was a conscious decision on her part beacause it seemed that the more pop she went, the fewer of her albums people were buying. This time, sheâ€™s giving the people what they want.\n\nAugust 15: Pettibone says that â€œGoodbye to Innocenceâ€ wasnâ€™t working. He worked overnight on a new bassline that he brought into Soundworks (NYC) today and it seemed to fix the problem. However, when Madonna started putting down the vocal track, she started toying with the lyrics and started singing the words to â€œFever.â€ He says it sounded so good they decided to actually cover the tune. Madonna called Seymour Stein and in less than an hour, they had the lyrics to the Peggy Lee original. This was the last track they did for Erotica. (The Erotica Diaries, Shep Pettibone)\n\ninteresting...she attends a Peggy Lee show the night before and the next day - bam! - \"Fever\" is reborn as a Madonna track.

The video intercalates scenes of Madonna, dressed as a masked dominatrix with a gold tooth, with actual footage of the making of her Sex book; in these scenes Madonna is seen sitting topless in the lap of an older man, kissing model Naomi Campbell, wearing BDSM gear and riding a bicycle in the nude. The video also counts with cameos by celebrities such as Isabella Rossellini, and Big Daddy Kane. Shooting for the footage of Madonna singing the song, took place on August 22, 1992 at The Kitchen in New York City while shootings for Sex took place at Hotel Chelsea and Times Square's all-male burlesque Gaiety Theatre. In order to imitate the look of old home movies and stag films, the entire video was shot with super 8 mm film.\n\nAugust 25: In the United Kingdom, the song TUTBMP debuted at number five on the UK Singles Chart, and reached a peak of number three the week of August 25, 1992, and was present on the top 100 for a total of 9 weeks. It was certified silver by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) on September 1, 1992, for shipments of 200,000 copies. The single has sold over 275,000 copies as of October 2010. The song also achieved great success across Europe, hitting number one in various countries including Italy, Finland, and Sweden and charting within the top ten in other countries. It resulted in the song achieving a peak of number two on the European Hot 100 Singles chart. In Australia the song reached a peak of number nine on the ARIA Charts and received a gold certification from the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) for shipment of 35,000 copies.\n\nSeptember: This will be the first release on Madonna's new MAVERICK label.\n\nSeptember 10: \"This Used To Be My Playground\" single is certified gold (500,000 units).\n\nOn September 10, 1992, it was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments of 500,000 copies. Billboard ranked it at number 22 on their list of \"Madonna's 40 Biggest Hits\" on the Hot 100.\n\nSeptember 12: Pettibone leaves Soundworks (NYC) with the completed master for Erotica. He said they spend three and a half months in the same recording studio to complete it.

(The Erotica Diaries, Shep Pettibone)\n\n1.8 million copies of the album are already advanced ordered in the U.S. (Billboard)\n\nMadonna says Shep Pettibone is more commercial and dance-oriented while Andre Betts has a more street vibe, jazzy, hiphop feel. Shepâ€™s production is more heavily synthesized while Betts features more live drums, acoustic piano and saxophone.

It was later included on her greatest hits albums GHV2 (2001) and Celebration (2009).\n\nThe song was written by Madonna, Shep Pettibone and Anthony Shimkin, while production was handled by the singer and Pettibone. The track continued Madonna's exploration of potent spoken-word vocals, which she had previously introduced in \"Justify My Love\". The song contains a sample of Kool and the Gang's \"Jungle Boogie\". It also samples \"El Yom 'Ulliqa 'Ala Khashaba, by Lebanese singer Fairuz. This sample caused controversy after Fairuz claimed her vocals had been used without her consent, and said the lyrics \"he crucified me today\", which are sung in Arabic, are taken from a religious song that is traditionally heard during Easter services. This led to a lawsuit that was settled out of court.\n\nMusically, \"Erotica\" contains spoken word vocals, and is an ode to S&M, with Madonna using a pseudonym called \"Dita\". She invites her lover to be passive while making love to her and leads him to explore boundaries between pain and pleasure. In 1992, Madonna founded her own multi-media entertainment company, Maverick, consisting of a record company (Maverick Records), a film production company (Maverick Films), and associated music publishing, television broadcasting, book publishing and merchandising divisions. The first two projects from the venture were her fifth studio album, Erotica, and a coffee table book of photographs featuring Madonna, entitled Sex. For the album, Madonna primarily collaborated with producer Shep Pettibone. Pettibone first began working with Madonna during the 1980s, providing remixes for several of her singles. Alongside Pettibone, Madonna enlisted help from producer AndrÃ© Betts, who previously co-produced \"Justify My Love\" for The Immaculate Collection. Madonna said that she was interested to work with Pettibone and Betts due to their ability to remain plugged into the dance underground, \"They come from opposite ends of the spectrum in terms of their music style and approach to music, but they're both connected to the street and they're still young and hungry\".\n\nAccording to Pettibone in an article \"Erotica Diaries\" published on Madonna's Icon magazine, he produced a tape with four songs, for Madonna to listen to, before he traveled to Chicago, where she was filming A League of Their Own. She listened to the songs and liked all of them. After filming was complete, Madonna met Pettibone in New York City to start working together in November 1991. Their schedule was sporadic in the beginning. They were in the studio for a week and then she would work with Steven Meisel on Sex, for two weeks. Occasionally, Madonna also would meet AndrÃ© Betts. The first batch of songs Madonna and Pettibone worked on were \"Erotica\", \"Deeper and Deeper\", \"Rain\" and \"Thief of Hearts\"; she would write the lyrics as Pettibone worked on the music. Pettibone recalled that the singer preferred to be in control of the writing process because \"her songs are her stories. They're the things she wants to say\". While they were mixing a song called \"Erotic\", which was released as promotional single on her Sex book, Pettibone recalled:\n\n\"You have all these great stories in the book,\" I told her, \"Why don't you use them in the song?\" I knew that Madonna was developing a 1930s dominatrix look for Erotica, but I didn't realize how far she was willing to go before I saw Sex. It contained stories authored by her mysteriously dark alter, Dita. Madonna took the book and walked out of the room and didn't come back until about half an hour later. Suddenly she was on the mic, speaking in this very dry voice. \"My name is Dita,\" she said, \"and I'll be your mistress tonight.\" I knew that the original \"Erotica\" would never be the same again, and it wasn't. The chorus and bridge were changed entirely and the whole psyche of the song became sexier, more to the point. It seemed as if Dita brought out the best in her, actually serving as a vehicle for the dangerous territory she was traveling. Actually, it was the same name Madonna used when she'd stay in hotels around the world.

Everything went smoothly except the last two songs, Whyâ€™s It So Hard and Words, both of which we had to recall for changes. On September 12, I walked out of Soundworks with the completed master of Erotica in my hands.\n\nA month later, I went to the Sex party. The Erotica blitz was about to hit in music, video, and book form and a variety of stars were coming out for the party. Madonna herself surveyed the scene during the midnight hour. I walked over to meet her in the DJ Booth.\n\nThere was all this wild stuff going around us: people tattoing one another, couples simulating sex â€“ it was crazy. And when I went to talk to Madonna, who was in the middle of it all, our conversations turned to music. For all the multimedia extravaganzas that were braying for her attention, it was still the music that mattered and it was the record that we fawned over. I realized that no matter how far Iâ€™ve come, I still feel the same way that I always did.\n\nAnd then she put the handcuffs on me.

Both passed away from AIDS-related illnesses.\n\nIt shipped 4 million units worldwide prior to its release. (Entertainment Weekly, October 1992)\n\nThe video had its world premiere on MTV, on October 2, 1992. Upon its release, it was met with controversy; Susan Bibisi, from Los Angeles Daily News, called it a \"virtual advertisement\" for Sex\". Entertainment Tonight had previously reported that Madonna herself had initiated the mayhem surrounding the video by walking bare breasted at designer Jean Paul Gaultier's fashion show and posing nude in Vanity Fair magazine. Richard Harrington from The Washington Post wrote:\n\n\"In the video, Madonna becomes Dita Parlo, a masked, gold-toothed dominatrix from an indeterminate age, ready to help us cross the street at the corner of Pleasure and Pain [...] assuming different dominatrix roles and investigating assorted bondage scenarios before finishing up with some nude hitchhiking on a street remarkable free of pile-ups. Shot in grainy black and white, 'Erotica' has the feel of a stag film, though its quick cuts keep the viewer from seeing all that much\".\n\nAfter its release, it was aired by MTV a total of three times, all of these after the 10pm watershed, due to its highly charged sexual content, before being permanently banned; this made it Madonna's second video to be banned from airing by the channel, after \"Justify My Love\" in 1990. MTV spokeswoman Linda Alexander said, \"The themes of the video are clearly aimed at a more adult audience. It is not appropriate for a general viewing audience\". Madonna herself said she understood the channel's ban on the video; \"MTV plays to a huge audience and a lot of them are children, and a lot of themes I'm exploring in my videos aren't meant for children, so I understand that they say I can't show it [...] I accept it\". Rolling Stone's Anthony DeCurtis said that \"This is pretty much normal Madonna fare, [...] But how much longer can you continue mining sexuality? In checking off your list of taboos, how far can you take them? At what point does it just stop being interesting?â€ Similarly, David Browne from Entertainment Weekly, asked \"Havenâ€™t we seen most of this stuff before? Can we be bored with the subject matter already? [...] no emotion is attached to the mechanics of these acts, so itâ€™s difficult to identify with or care about the characters\". The video was nominated for the 1993 Billie Awards in four categories: Consumer print, trade print (music) and consumer print (retail), the most for a single entry. It also was ranked at number 16 on VH1's \"50 Sexiest Video Moments\".

During the party, Madonna showed up dressed as Little Bo Peep and even carried with her a stuffed toy lamb. Madonna's publicist Liz Rosenberg showed concern at first due to \"what the parents of America's impressionable teens will soon be thinking\" but later said that it \"all depends on your idea of lovemaking, which in Madonna's case, should give new meaning to the word erotic\". Both Waldenbooks and Barnes & Noble prepared corporate statements that the managers could share with customers who are offended by Sex. (Both statements defended the right of bookstores to provide \"diversity and choice\" to customers and say censorship is not the role of bookstores.) Many book stores, too, stated that the book would not be sold to anyone under 18 and that it would be for display only behind the cash register. Bookstore owner David Epstein stated that \"The feeling of most people who have ordered the book is that Madonna is something special, that this is cutting-edge art, [...], they're not the kind of people who are buying it because it's smut and dirty pictures. People are interested in it as art.\"\n\nOctober 17: On October 17, 1992, \"Erotica\" debuted at number 13 on the Billboard Hot 100, which at the time of its release placed Madonna in a fifth place tie with Mariah Carey's rendition of \"I'll Be There\" as the highest debut for a song in the history of the Billboard Hot 100. The song ultimately peaked at number three on the week of October 24, 1992. It eventually received a gold certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on December 10, 1992, for shipments of 500,000 copies. \"Erotica\" also had the highest debut in the history of the Hot 100 Airplay chart, entering at number two, on October 17, 1992.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, \"Erotica\" debuted at number 11 in the UK Singles Chart, the week of October 17, 1992, ultimately peaking at the third position. The song was present a total of 9 weeks on the chart. As of 2008, the single has sold over 270, 800 copies in the United Kingdom. In France, the song debuted at number 30 of the SNEP Single Charts, on the week of November 11, 1992, before peaking at number 23. The song was successful in Italy, where it topped the FIMI Single Charts. On the year-end Italian charts, the song was ranked at number 13. The track was also commercially successful in other places such as Spain, Ireland and Sweden, where it managed to peak within the top five of the charts. \"Erotica\" also reached the top spot of the European Hot 100 Singles, the week of October 23, 1992\n\nOctober 20: The Erotica album is released. One day later, SEX is released.\n\nOn October 20 1992, Madonnaâ€™s fifth studio album, Erotica was released by Maverick Records.\n\nMusic critic Sal Cinquemani commented on the albumâ€™s impact:\n\nBy 1992, Madonna was an iconâ€”untouchable, literally and figurativelyâ€”and Erotica was the first time the artistâ€™s music took on a decidedly combative, even threatening tone, and most people didnâ€™t want to hear it. Eroticaâ€™s irrefutable un-sexiness probably says more about the sex=death mentality of the early â€™90s than any other musical document of its time. This is not Madonna at her creative zenith. This is Madonna at her most important, at her most relevant. No one else in the mainstream at that time dared to talk about sex, love, and death with such frankness and fearlessness.\n\nErotica is the fifth studio album by American singer and songwriter Madonna. It was released on October 20, 1992, by the Maverick and Warner Bros. Records. The album was released simultaneously with Madonna's first book publication, Sex, a coffee table book containing explicit photographs featuring the singer. It marked Madonna's first release under her own multimedia entertainment company, Maverick. Erotica is a concept album about sex and romance; she incorporated an alter ego named Mistress Dita, inspired by actress Dita Parlo. Some songs also take on a more confessional tone, influenced by the loss of Madonna's two close friends to AIDS.\n\nAccording to Pettibone in \"Erotica Diaries\" published on Madonna's Icon magazine, he produced a tape with three songs for Madonna to listen to, before he traveled to Chicago, where she was filming A League of Their Own. She listened to the songs and liked all of them. After filming was complete, Madonna met Pettibone in New York City to start working together in November 1991. Their schedule was sporadic in the beginning. Madonna and Pettibone were in the studio for a week and then she would work with Steven Meisel on Sex, for two weeks. Occasionally, Madonna also would meet AndrÃ© Betts. At first, Madonna did not like the first group of songs she had recorded. She wanted Erotica to have a raw edge to it, as if it were recorded in an alley in Harlem, and not a light glossy production to permeate her sound, according to Pettibone. \"Deeper and Deeper\" was not working for Madonna. Pettibone said they tried different bridges and changes, but in the end, Madonna wanted the middle of the song to have a flamenco guitar.\n\nThey had problems during sequencing and had to repair the songs, taking some time. Pettibone had to keep things moving as fast as possible as he did not want Madonna to lose interest in the music. At this point, as far as the music went, it was getting a little melancholy. However, as Pettibone explained, Madonna's stories directed the creative direction of the songs into deeply personal territory as they were more serious and intense. Madonna left th"
