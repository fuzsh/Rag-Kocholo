Qualitative analysis is performed considering the AHRQ required and additional domains. The table below provides an outline of the method used to determine the final SoE.\n\nStrength of Evidence for Existing Systematic Reviews\n\nLevel of evidence ratings for Cochrane reviews and other systematic reviews are assigned a baseline score of HIGH if RCTs were used, LOW if observational studies were used. The rating can be upgraded or downgraded based on adherence to the core criteria for methods, qualitative, and quantitative analyses for systematic reviews (there is a reference/evaluation table for this).\n\nThe following four possible levels and their definition are reported:\n\nHigh: High confidence that the evidence reflects the true effect. Further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect.\n\nModerate: Moderate confidence that the evidence reflects the true effect. Further research may change our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate.\n\nLow: Low confidence that the evidence reflects the true effect. Further research is likely to change the confidence in the estimate of effect and likely to change the estimate.\n\nInsufficient: Evidence either is unavailable or does not permit a conclusion.\n\nAll AHRQ “required” and “additional” domainsa are assessed. Only those that influence the baseline grade are listed in table.\n\nBaseline strength: Risk of bias (including control of confounding) is accounted for in the individual article evaluations. HIGH = majority of articles Level I/II. LOW = majority of articles Level III/IV.\n\nDOWNGRADE: Inconsistencyb of results (1 or 2); Indirectness of evidence (1 or 2); Imprecision of effect estimates (1 or 2); Sub-group analyses not stated apriori and no test for interaction (2)\n\nUPGRADE: Large magnitude of effect (1 or 2); Dose response gradient (1)\n\nOutcomeStrength of evidenceConclusions and commentsBaselineDOWNGRADEUPGRADEOutcome HIGH Summary of findings HIGH\n\nLevel I/II studies NO\n\nconsistent, direct, and precise estimates NO Outcome MODERATE Summary of findings LOW\n\nLevel III studies NO\n\nconsistent, direct, and precise estimates YES\n\nLarge effectOutcome LOW Summary of findings HIGH\n\nLevel I/II studies YES (2)\n\nInconsistent\n\nIndirect NO\n\nDefinitions of the Different Levels of Evidence for Reliability Studies\n\nLevelStudy typeCriteria1Good quality study• Broad spectrum of persons with the expected condition\n\n• Adequate description of methods for replication\n\n• Blinded performance of tests, measurements or interpretation\n\n• Second test/interpretation performed independently of the first2Moderate quality• Violation of any one of the criteria for a good quality study3Poor quality study• Violation of any two of the criteria4Very poor quality study• Violation of all three of the criteria\n\nArticles from Evidence-Based Spine-Care Journal are provided here courtesy of Thieme Medical Publishers"
