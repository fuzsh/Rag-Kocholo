Pyar Ki Gawahi | Full Eng Hindi Dubbed Hot Movie | Madonna , Wiliiam Dafor Body of Evidence is a 1993 American erotic thriller film produced by Dino De Laurentiis and distributed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and originally had the rare NC-17 rating.[2] It was directed by Uli Edel and written by Brad Mirman. The film stars Madonna and Willem Dafoe,[3] with Joe Mantegna, Anne Archer, Julianne Moore and Jürgen Prochnow in supporting roles. The first theatrical release was censored for the purpose of obtaining an R rating, reducing the film's running time from 101 to 99 minutes.[4] The video première, however, restored the deleted material. Madonna's performance in the film was universally derided by film critics and it marked her fourth film acting performance to be widely panned, following Shanghai Surprise, Who's That Girl and Bloodhounds of Broadway.[5] In France and Japan, the film was released under the name Body. In Japan Madonna's other 1993 film Dangerous Game was released there as Body II even though the films have nothing in common nor are related to each other in narrative.
