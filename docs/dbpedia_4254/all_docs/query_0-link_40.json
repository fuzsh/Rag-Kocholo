Russia’s Modernisation: Main Policy Challenge ‖In our work to make our economy radically In the twenty-first century, our country once again more effective we also need to put in place needs to undergo comprehensive modernisation. incentives and conditions for progress in a whole […] We have a duty to heed the lessons of recent number of different directions [...] This calls for events. So long as oil prices were growing many, large-scale modernisation of production facilities almost all of us, to be honest, fell for the illusion in all economic sectors. This requires a that structural reforms could wait and that what completely new quality of business was important now was to make maximum use of management and completely new technology, the high prices. The priority was on pushing ahead above all machines and equipment. In most the old raw materials economy, while developing cases, the best technology is energy effective unique technology and innovative products was the and energy conserving technology, economical subject of only random individual decisions. But we and environmentally friendly technology‖. can delay no longer. We must begin the modernisation and technological upgrading of our entire industrial sector.
