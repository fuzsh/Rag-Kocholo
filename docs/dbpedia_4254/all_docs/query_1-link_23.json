        "text": "European aerospace and defense group EADS and Russian Nanotechnology Corp. will cooperate in the research and development of new technologies.\n\nThe cooperative agreement was signed by Rusnano Chief Executive Officer Anatoly Chubais and EADS Chief Technical Officer Jean Botti.\n\nAs a first step, the partners will identify relevant patents in EADS's portfolio that could be suited to develop new business in the Russian industry.\n\n\"As a global leader in aerospace and defense, EADS has technologies that can help our partners maintain their competitive edge,\" Botti said. \"Today's agreement establishes the ground for cooperation in different areas through the use and transfer of intellectual property and technology.\"\n\nAdded Chubais: \"The advanced technologies of EADS complement well with the RUSNANO's strong position in the Russian high-tech market.\n\n\"Our cooperation paves the way for the progress in nanotech-related fields, including energy efficiency, new materials, life science and security.\"\n\nThe technology licensing procedures in place at EADS reduce the time required for implementation, minimize risk of patent infringement and ensure that all controls and processes are applied, EADS said.\n\nTo facilitate the application and use of licensed technologies, the company offers training, engineering support and assistance in the establishment of processes and procedures.\n\nEADS said it sees Russia as a major cooperation partner in the technology area. In 2003, the company established a technology office to facilitate collaboration with the Russian research and development community. Since its opening, the RTO has managed more than 100 cooperative research and technology programs between EADS and Russian institutions.\n\nEADS is also participating in the Skolkovo Innovation Center.\n\nRusnano was founded in March as an open joint stock company through reorganization of the state corporation, Russian Corp. of Nanotechnologies.\n\nRusnano's mission is to develop the Russian nanotechnology industry through co-investment in nanotechnology projects with substantial economic potential or social benefit. The Russian government owns 100 percent of the shares in Rusnano.\n\nWork to establish nanotechnology infrastructure and training for nanotechnology specialists, formerly conducted by the RCN, has been entrusted to the Fund for Infrastructure and Educational Programs, a non-commercial fund also established through reorganization of the RCN.\n\nEADS is a global leader in aerospace, defense and related services. In 2010, the group - comprised of Airbus, Astrium, Cassidian and Eurocopter - generated revenues of more than $62.9 billion and employed a workforce of nearly 122,000.\n\nEADS Innovation Works, the corporate research network of EADS, operates research and technology laboratories that promote the group's technical innovation potential with a focus on long-term research.\n\nEADS Innovation Works has two main sites -- in Munich, Germany, and Paris -- and employs more than 700 people. Proximity centers are maintained in Spain, Britain, France and Germany.\n\nEADS Innovation Works also operates research and technology centers in Moscow, Singapore and Bengaluru, India."
