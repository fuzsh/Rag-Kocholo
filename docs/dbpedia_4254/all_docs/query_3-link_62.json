We are considering a project worth $900m. This will be the largest project in Russiaâ€™s pharmaceutical business,\" Chubais said.\n\nRusNano was created in 2007 with an aim to commercialise developments in nanotechnology.\n\nAll Rusnano projects can be grouped into six clusters: solar energy and energy saving, nanostructured materials, medicine and biotech, mechanical engineering and metal working, optoelectronics and nanoelectronics, and infrastructure projects."
