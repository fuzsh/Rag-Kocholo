The Subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:05 a.m. in room SR-253, Russell Senate Office Building, Hon. Bill Nelson, Chairman of the Subcommittee, presiding. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. BILL NELSON, U.S. SENATOR FROM FLORIDA Senator Nelson. Good morning. We are really looking forward to this hearing. Senator Boozman and I are quite honored to have the senior leadership of the full Commerce Committee here with us. And so I want to turn it over first to the Chairman of the Committee, Chairman Rockefeller, and then recognize the Ranking Member, Senator Hutchison. Mr. Chairman? STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER IV, U.S. SENATOR FROM WEST VIRGINIA The Chairman. A most courteous gesture. I want to repeat what Senator Nelson said. I think the depth of knowledge that you have--I prepared for this hearing, and it was brilliantly prepared for me by a woman sitting behind me, and it was one of the best briefings I've ever gotten. And what it basically does is--because we were doing this 12 years ago, if you can remember. We had little demonstrations out here on the floor, and we didn't know what we were looking at. And the people who were explaining it didn't know how to explain it. And then here you come absolutely brilliant, top people in the country. So we're at a place today where big advances in technology are happening at a very small level, stunningly small. Everything from biotechnology tools to detect early stage Alzheimer's disease, which is extraordinarily interesting, to soon reducing your computer's entire memory to the size of a single tiny chip. I can't believe that. And, Dr. Mirkin, you're going to tell me why it's true. Just over ten years ago, the government created the National Nanotechnology Initiative to focus on this issue, and that was a very wise move. That early and sustained commitment has translated into U.S. global leadership in nanotechnology research, for the moment, and development and commercialization. So there are very significant economic incentives to maintain our lead in this field. We have had lots of leads in lots of areas, math and science and all kinds of things. But we don't have it any longer, and we don't want this to follow that path. Others are very aggressive on their own projections for commercialization of this technology. It was about $200 billion in 2009. You're projecting a trillion dollars by 2015. That's actually just two and a half years from now, maybe a little bit more than that. Nanotechnology has the potential to revolutionize such areas as health care, which is incredibly important to me, information technology; energy, also important; homeland security; food safety; and transportation. At a time when Americans and American businesses are struggling financially, we've got to do whatever we can. And all of a sudden, we're presented with this enormous gift which could employ millions of people, if they were trained to so do. Now, if Dow Chemical is telling me that they can't--because their engineers are retiring and that they can't replace them, in a chemical company, then that makes me really worry about nanotechnology and what we're actually doing about that in this era of budget cuts. And I want us to talk about that. Germany and Japan are hot after all of this. So are China and South Korea. They're commercializing investments to take advantage of this growing nanotechnology product market. I really look forward to hearing from you. I always say that every time I chair a hearing. But I really mean it. You're extraordinary people in your backgrounds and in the knowledge that you have. I have to put a plug, obviously, in for West Virginia, and I can do that very easily through Dr. Diandra Leslie-Pelecky, who is here, and has a whole group of researchers all over the state of West Virginia helping her on this subject. And she leads something called the West Virginia Nanotechnology Initiative, WVNano, which started back in 2004. It was started back in 2004, and the program focus is on stimulating research in nanoscience. I couldn't be more pleased to welcome the new director with us here today. She's an expert in the use of magnetic nanoparticles for medical diagnosis, treatment, and drug delivery. And one of the things which perks my imagination-- she's also known for making science accessible to everybody and, therefore, has even written a book called ``The Physics of NASCAR,'' which has to do with nanotechnology, I assume. In any event, I'm really proud that you're here representing our state. Mr. Chairman, I thank you for your more than good courtesy. [The prepared statement of Senator Rockefeller follows:] Prepared Statement of Hon. John D. Rockefeller IV, U.S. Senator from West Virginia I want to thank you all for being here today to discuss what some have referred to as ``the next industrial revolution.'' We are at a place today where big advances on technology are happening at a very small level--everything from bio-technology tools to detect early stage Alzheimer's disease, to soon reducing your computer's entire memory to the size of a single tiny chip. Just over 10 years ago, the government created a National Nanotechnology Initiative to focus on this issue. That early and sustained commitment has translated into U.S. global leadership in nanotechnology research and development and commercialization. There are significant economic and societal incentives to maintain our lead in this field. The global market for nanotechnology-related products was more than $200 billion in 2009, and projections suggesting that it will reach $1 trillion by 2015. With this growth, comes demand for workers with nanotechnology-related skills. Nanotechnology has the potential to revolutionize such areas as health care, information technology, energy, homeland security, food safety, and transportation. At a time when Americans and American businesses are struggling financially, we must do whatever we can to stimulate the economy. This Committee has spent a lot of time this Congress focusing on job creation and manufacturing. I believe nanotechnology plays a key role in boosting the economy and creating jobs. Like all science and technology efforts, however, our international competitors are catching up and increasing their investments in this area. China, South Korea, Germany, Japan and others are commercializing their investments to take advantage of the growing nanotechnology product market. If we wait too long, these countries will surpass us. I look forward to hearing from our witnesses on the best ways to turn our nation's early research lead into successful commercialization to create businesses and jobs here in the United States. Realizing the potential of nanotechnology, my own state of West Virginia established the West Virginia Nanotechnology Initiative--or WVNano--back in 2004. The program focuses on stimulating research in nanoscience, and I couldn't be more pleased to welcome the new director here with us today. Dr. Diandra Leslie-Pelecky is an expert in the use of magnetic nanoparticles for medical diagnosis, treatment, and drug delivery. In her role as director of WVNano, she works with about 40 researchers throughout the state at West Virginia University, Marshall University, and West Virginia State University to advance nanoscale science, engineering, and education. Dr. Leslie-Pelecky is also known for making science accessible everyone--including explaining physics through a book she authored titled, The Physics of NASCAR. As I'm sure you know, not every student is found in a classroom, and I think you will find my colleagues and I ready to learn from you today. I'd like to thank you all again for being here today and look forward to your testimony. Senator Nelson. My pleasure. Senator Hutchison? STATEMENT OF HON. KAY BAILEY HUTCHISON, U.S. SENATOR FROM TEXAS Senator Hutchison. Well, thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, for recognizing Chairman Rockefeller and me. And I hope you realize that holding this hearing means we think it is a real priority for this Committee to reauthorize the National Nanotechnology Initiative. Nanotechnology is one of the few growing sectors of the economy. And the United States must do more to take advantage of this great growth and our own leadership in this field. For example, the Nobel Laureates who discovered the buckyball molecule, which is a building block of nanotechnology, were Rice University professors Dr. Richard Smalley and Dr. Bob Curl. And so I am very pleased that we have with us today the Provost of Rice University, Dr. George McLendon. And thank you, Mr. Chairman, for granting my request to have him come and testify, because I do feel like Texas has taken a leadership role in this field. I hope that we can go forward and reauthorize the National Nanotechnology Initiative with the same spirit that we have had in Texas. We must share information and collaborate with the different centers of excellence to go into the many different fields of nanotechnology. And if we prioritize the consortia and the collaboration, that's how we will really keep our preeminence in this vital field. Just as an example, Rice University houses the Consortium for Nanomaterials for Aerospace Commerce Technology which includes other universities such as the University of Texas. And it is developing nanotechnology applications to recharge personal digital assistants and to power unmanned aerial vehicles, which are increasingly used by our military. And so these are some of the outgrowths of this nanotechnology research that have come about through a consortium of engineers as well as scientists coming together to make the products with the research. But as we are going forward on the National Nanotechnology Initiative, we've got to realize that America led because of our pro-innovation incentives. We started the R&D tax credit that has really put America in the forefront. But other countries have now adopted our successful formula, and the R&D tax credits in other countries are now stronger and better than America's. Ours is more incremental and is not permanent. So every couple of years, we have to come back and reauthorize the R&D tax credit. One of the things that we should recommend out of this committee is that we make the R&D tax credit permanent, because it has been a foundation of our innovation and has helped us so much. So I look forward to working with all of you on this. I thank you, Senator Nelson, for making it a priority for your Subcommittee to hold this hearing so we can gain the knowledge from the researchers on the ground to know how better to utilize our resources and what the future promises. Thank you. Senator Nelson. Senator Boozman? STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN BOOZMAN, U.S. SENATOR FROM ARKANSAS Senator Boozman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I am very much looking forward to hearing from these witnesses and working with you on this important issue of nanotechnology research and development. There's no doubt that advances in science and engineering are essential for ensuring America's economic growth and global competitiveness. Amongst these advances, the Federal investment in basic research in nanotechnology has been a striking success story. From its original beginnings as a niche science, nanotechnology R&D now spans across disciplines and has a burgeoning global market. The field continues to have great potential in addressing some of the grand challenges facing our Nation in energy, defense, healthcare, water, and agriculture. Both industry and academia have acknowledged the effectiveness of the National Nanotechnology Initiative. And over time, the NNI has established a track record and reputation as a successful and cooperative organization. A great part of that success is that the NNI has leveraged the strengths of our scientific agencies, focusing primarily on the development of fundamental scientific knowledge through basic research while at the same time interfacing with industry and universities. The NNI's effectiveness is increasingly necessary. Analysts have forecast that by 2014, products incorporating nanotechnology will rise to 15 percent of all global manufacturing, worth $2.6 trillion. All states, big and small, should be able to supply the growing market for nano-enabled products. And while nanotechnology R&D is more broadly distributed geographically than other scientific disciplines, the growth in nanotechnology R&D in EPSCoR states should be, and could be, greater. Fortunately, my home state of Arkansas has laid the groundwork of research infrastructure to take advantage of market growth. The University of Arkansas system now has a nationally recognized Nanotechnology Center and Institute for Nanoscience and Engineering. And the university system has committed to build a regional institute for nanoscale material science and engineering in the near future. The university system helped to develop NanoMech, whose primary products, TuffTek, which allows tools to last three times longer, and NanoGlide, which makes oil 30 to 50 times more efficient, are part of the $20 billion market Arkansas will now have access to. Furthermore, considering that Arkansas is home to major business entities, corporate, agriculture, and retail that would be excellent customers for nanotechnology businesses, it becomes clear that any state, regardless of their size, should be capable of building their innovation infrastructure to be able to conduct cutting edge nanotechnology R&D. The President's proposed signature initiatives in solar energy, nanomanufacturing and nanoelectronics should not become bi-coastal research and commercialization consortia. The very interdisciplinary nature of the nanotechnology research suggests that signature initiatives should be national collaborations involving a wide variety of research institutions. In fact, in the report on the NNI, the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology acknowledged the need for the NNI to improve its outreach to states, stating the need for engaging in closer and more frequent interactions with states which could provide important leverage of resources for the NNI. As competition for leadership in nanotechnology has intensified with Brazil, Russia, India, China, and the EU all matching U.S. investments in nanotechnology research, we must align nanotechnology R&D stakeholders and use our Federal dollars efficiently and effectively. Ultimately, we all want the U.S. to continue to be a nanotechnology leader and a place where talented people engage in cutting edge research, where companies can develop products, and where graduate students can learn. I very much look forward to hearing from the witnesses. We appreciate you being here. We appreciate the hard work and the fact that today we truly are going to hear about a success story. Thank you. And with that, I yield back, Mr. Chairman. Senator Nelson. It's my understanding that Senator Ayotte wants to make a comment. Please. STATEMENT OF HON. KELLY AYOTTE, U.S. SENATOR FROM NEW HAMPSHIRE Senator Ayotte. Thank you Mr. Chairman for calling this hearing. In my state of New Hampshire, we are fortunate to have two companies doing innovative work in the nanotechnology field. Nanocomp Technologies in Concord is the nation's leading manufacturers of advanced carbon nanotube materials. They are leveraging Federal and private dollars to build the Nation's leading center for the manufacturing of 21st century products. In the next 2 years, the company expects its workforce to increase by a factor of seven. For the past 14 years, Swanzey, New Hampshire has been the home of Moore Nanotech, which has quickly become a leader in state-of-the-art, ultra-precision manufacturing systems and advanced optics. With so much innovation in my state and across the country, I'm excited about this hearing today. I want to drill down on this rapidly growing field and have a discussion about how our Federal research dollars are being invested, so that we can help continue to foster a positive climate to create jobs in this exciting field. I also want to align myself with the comments of Ranking Member Hutchison regarding the R&D tax credit. I firmly believe we should make them permanent and would further encourage investment not only in this field but in other fields of manufacturing across this country. So thank you for being here today. I look forward to hearing the witnesses. Senator Nelson. Senator Blunt? STATEMENT OF HON. ROY BLUNT, U.S. SENATOR FROM MISSOURI Senator Blunt. Thank you, Chairman. I'm glad to be here. I'm looking forward to the witnesses. We do have a significant nanotech effort in Missouri at Missouri State University in Springfield, where I live, and, in fact, at the Jordan Valley Innovation Center, lots of nanotech work focused on seeing what we can do to harden our satellites and other things that may be able to replace big equipment that would be really hard to replace, square inch for square inch, with equipment that does the same job that's much more resistant to electro pulse, magnetic pulse attacks and things like that. This is an important hearing, and I'm glad to be here to listen and learn. And thanks for holding it. Senator Nelson. Thank you, Senators. And I've reserved my comments, mainly to introduce our very distinguished panel. But this is quite extraordinary. We're talking about gold nanoparticles that can detect prostate cancer. We're talking about ``buckypaper'' that can end up being 250 times the strength of steel and 10 times lighter. We're talking about carbon nanotubes put directly on a metal surface that results in much longer life batteries and powerful energy storage devices. And so what we want to do is examine--now that we have this interagency initiative called the National Nanotechnology Initiative--what we need to do to keep this going so that the genius of America can blossom to continue this research, and then so the genius of America can be encouraged to take that research and development and get it out into the commercial sector. And we want to look at things like international standards, understanding that the absence of standards could also be a hindrance to commercialization, because if venture capitalists don't have something that they consider to be certain, then that could delay the commercialization of these products. This is a distinguished panel. I'll take the parochial privilege of pointing out Dr. Tom O'Neal from my home area of central Florida, from our university there, that heads up the business incubation program, and they're just doing great things there. We also have the jurisdiction under this subcommittee of America's space program. We know that the space program is transitioning, and we're going from one set of rockets that have been so reliable for us called the Space Shuttle for 30 years, not without tragedy. Now we're going to two new different lines of rockets, one to and from the Space Station, and another, the big rocket. But in the process, we're going to be more efficient, and what we need to do is diversify. This subject area of nanotechnology is another opportunity, Dr. O'Neal, of taking your expertise in your incubator and expanding a lot of the role in and around the Kennedy Space Center with the extraordinary talent that is available to put them to use on this. Dr. Chad Mirkin is the Director of the International Institute for Nanotechnology at Northwestern and a member of the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology. He's the founder of three nanotechnology companies that are commercializing the fruits of his research. Dr. Charles Romine is the Acting Associate Director for Laboratory Programs and the Principal Deputy in the Office of the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology. And we want you to talk about those standards, Dr. Romine. And he's going to discuss the work of the NIST Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology and NIST's broader role. And then Dr. Diandra Leslie-Pelecky who Senator Rockefeller has already introduced--she is the Director of the West Virginia Nanotechnology Initiative and a professor of physics. We're looking forward to your testimony. Dr. George McLendon is the Hughes Provost and Professor of Chemistry at Rice. His testimony will discuss how nanotechnology can help address our nation's challenges in energy independence--does that sound familiar?--healthcare-- does that sound familiar?--economic growth--does that sound especially sound familiar?--and, of course, keeping America competitive in a changing global marketplace. So we welcome all of you here. I thank the chairman and the ranking member for their presence. And shall we just start from that side of the table and just go right on down? Instead of just sitting there and reading a speech, as much as you can, talk it. And then keep it about 5 minutes so that we can really get into some good give-and-take. Dr. Mirkin? STATEMENT OF CHAD A. MIRKIN, DIRECTOR, NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR NANOTECHNOLOGY, RATHMANN PROFESSOR OF CHEMISTRY, PROFESSOR OF MEDICINE, PROFESSOR OF MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING, PROFESSOR OF BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING, PROFESSOR OF CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING Dr. Mirkin. Thank you. Chairman Nelson, Ranking Member Boozman, and members of the Committee, thanks for the privilege and honor to provide testimony today regarding the NNI. As Chairman Nelson said, I come from Northwestern University, where I run one of the largest institutes for nanotechnology in the country. We have hundreds of students and post-docs working in this area and contributing to the development of the field. In addition, I have been involved in two of the largest policy reports that evaluated the NNI and also the U.S.'s position in the world in nanotechnology. We just finished a very large study where we traveled all over the world--to four different countries, where we brought together 35 different countries, or representatives from 35 different countries, to tell us about what they've been doing, some of the strategies they've been taking, and we learned a lot from that. And we learned a lot about where we stand compared to them and how far we have to go and some of the great things that are happening not only in the U.S. but also in the rest of the world. I've also been involved in starting three companies, one of which has gone public--it's traded on the NASDAQ--called NanoSphere. The other two are private companies, AuraSense and NanoInk. They employ hundreds of people and, hopefully, 1 day soon, thousands of people. And they represent, I think, some of the first real dividends from the early investments in the NNI, and I'm very proud to be a part of them. Consequently, I have a pretty broad view of the field and an understanding of some of the issues facing it. If we step back and look at what's happened over the last decade, I don't think anybody would argue that the first 10 years of the NNI has been an overwhelming success. The visibility and societal importance of nanoscale science and engineering and technology have been confirmed, while extreme predictions--and I'm sure you remember in the early days, they were extreme, both pro and con--they've receded. And so we've gotten down to the serious business of real science, finding out what we can really do with this field and making real advances in the development of important technologies. The field has been recognized as revolutionary and comparable with the introduction of the biotechnology and digital information revolutions. And the U.S. is positioned to make extraordinary strides over the next 10 years. But, as I said, it's clear the rest of the world now understands the importance of the field, and many countries are building efforts that rival what has been established by the NNI. This includes dozens of institutes throughout Asia, the Mideast, and Europe. If the United States does not act now and aggressively pursue development of nanoscience and nanotechnology, we will lose our position as a global leader in this transformative field. Moreover, and maybe more importantly, we will lose the opportunities it can afford us to build our economy and new manufacturing base. So why is there so much interest in nanotechnology? The reason is simple and we've heard allusions to it: it really has the potential to transform almost every aspect of our lives by providing rapid routes to addressing some of the most pressing problems in healthcare, electronics, energy, and the environment, just to name a few. Anywhere where materials are important, nanotechnology is going to play a big role. Take, for example, a technology like gene regulation. A few decades ago, this technology held the promise of treating and potentially curing some of the most debilitating diseases, including cardiovascular disease, neurological disorders like Alzheimer's disease, and many forms of cancer. As scientists and doctors, we have learned that it is not an easy technology to implement and requires materials that can deliver the genetic drugs effectively and without toxicity. The good news is that researchers are now discovering all sorts of nanomaterials through NNI funded efforts, like the National Cancer Institute's Centers of Cancer Nanotechnology Excellence, that show extraordinary promise for the effective use of such therapies in humans. I'm convinced that nanotechnology will play a lead role in finding the cures to many of these diseases and not just in the long term--but in the short term. I think there are real major inroads that have been made in the last decade that will contribute to that goal. On the diagnostic side, meaning medical diagnostics, the NNI funded efforts like the NSF's Science and Engineering Centers have discovered powerful new ways of detecting and tracking disease markers at very early stages, stages that cannot be detected with conventional tools and when therapeutics can be more effective. Several of these technologies are FDA cleared and commercialized. And after only a decade, it is just simply remarkable to see what scientists would call basic science, the early stages of science, already transitioned into meaningful commercial successes. That is an incredible feat, to do that in only 10 years. If you follow technological development and commercialization, it usually takes much longer. Innovation and the related job creation will likely continue at an accelerated rate if we maintain a well coordinated and implemented NNI. What are the challenges going forward? In my opinion, we should not be discussing the renewal of the NNI but rather its expansion. That's a tough but critical decision in troubled economic times. The United States simply cannot afford to lose its competitive edge in nanotechnology over the next decade. There are three primary areas which need to be addressed over the next decade, and they pertain to management of the NNI, which is a big beast to navigate and steer, and to do it effectively; developing strategies for future investment in both research and education and training--that's really the core; and then dealing with environment, health, and safety (EHS) issues potentially posed by nanotechnology. I'm going to only share my recommendations with respect to one of these. We have other experts that are going to talk about the EHS issues, and I've testified in my written testimony on some of the management issues. With regard to strategies for future investments, the NNI should maintain a parallel focus on basic research, the discovery part of research, and its translation into commercializable products and processes. You can't have the latter without the former. So it would be crazy to not invest heavily in basic research while we begin to translate the early fruits of that basic research into commercializable technologies that can lead to companies that will create jobs and build our economy. With a budget planning process coordinated by OSTP, each agency should continuously reevaluate its NNI balance of investments among the program component areas. There are several program component areas if you look at the reports. Each area should enhance its focus on commercialization and-- this is key--double its investment in nanomanufacturing over the next 5 years, while maintaining the current level of investment in basic research. So, again, we harvest what we initially planted a decade ago. The NNI should have a focus on signature initiatives in areas such as nanomedicine, advanced nanomanufacturing, nanoelectronics and photonics, nanomaterials for energy applications, and environmental monitoring and remediation. Each signature initiative's lead agency should develop coordinated milestones, promote strong educational components, and create public-private partnerships to leverage the outcomes of the initiatives. The opportunities in this field are immense, but we need a way to identify and coordinate national centers of excellence to act as international hubs to attract and keep the best and the brightest in the field and train the next generation of workers and leaders in nanomanufacturing in the U.S. That's central here, taking advantage of the whole pool, in this case. In conclusion, advances in nanotechnology will continue to play a critical part on the world economic stage. And it is imperative that the U.S. continue to support, strengthen, and expand the NNI in order to maintain its competitive edge. I thank you for your time, attention, and service to the country, and I'm happy to answer any questions that you may have. The prepared statement of Dr. Mirkin follows:] Prepared Statement of Chad A. Mirkin, Director, Northwestern University International Institute for Nanotechnology, Rathmann Professor of Chemistry, Professor of Medicine, Professor of Materials Science and Engineering, Professor of Biomedical Engineering, Professor of Chemical and Biological Engineering Chairman Nelson, Ranking Member Boozman, and Members of the Committee, Thank you for the privilege and honor to provide testimony today regarding the National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI). This testimony provides my personal perspective on the issue that is the subject of this hearing, and does not necessarily reflect that of any organizations with which I affiliated. I am Chad Mirkin, a Professor at Northwestern University and Director of the Northwestern University International Institute for Nanotechnology, one of the largest university nanotechnology centers in the world. I also am a member of the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) and contributed to their report titled, ``Report to the President and Congress on the Third Assessment of the National Nanotechnology Initiative.'' In addition, I served as a co- chair on the science policy report committee, coordinated by the World Technology Evaluation Center, which produced ``Nanotechnology Research Directions for Societal Needs in 2020,'' an analysis of world accomplishments in nanotechnology during the first ten years of the NNI and an assessment of the prospects for the next ten years. This report had input from leading experts from academia, industry, and government from over 35 countries in forums held in four different countries last year. In addition, I have started three nanotech companies, Nanosphere, NanoInk, and AuraSense, which have commercialized NNI-sponsored university-based inventions, generated hundreds of new jobs, and begun to build a new economic and manufacturing base for the Nation. Consequently, I have a fairly broad view of the field and an understanding of some of the issues facing the United States as it tries to maintain a leadership position within it. The first ten years of the NNI have been an overwhelming success. The visibility and societal importance of nanoscale science, engineering, and technology have been confirmed, while extreme predictions, both pro and con, have receded. The field has been recognized as revolutionary and comparable to the introduction of the biotechnology and digital information revolutions. The worldwide market for products incorporating nanotechnology is significant and reached about a quarter of a trillion dollars in 2009. This is just the ``tip of the iceberg'', and the U.S. is positioned to make extraordinary strides over the next ten years. However, the rest of the world now understands the importance of this field, and many countries are building efforts that rival what has been established by the NNI. This includes dozens of institutes throughout China, Japan, Singapore, Taiwan, Saudi Arabia, and many countries in Europe, including Germany, Switzerland, and Great Britain. If the United States does not act now and aggressively pursue the development of nanoscience and nanotechnology, we will lose our position as the global leader in this transformative field; moreover, we will lose the opportunities it can afford us to build our economy and new manufacturing base. Why is there so much interest in nanotechnology? The reason is simple; it has the potential to transform almost every aspect of our lives by providing rapid routes to addressing some of the most pressing problems in health care, electronics, energy, and the environment. One of the lessons learned over the first ten years is that every material, when miniaturized, has new properties, and many of these properties can be used to create applications and technologies that solve these problems. Take for example, a technology like gene-regulation--a few decades ago, this technology held the promise of treating and potentially curing some of the most debilitating diseases, including cardiovascular disease, neurological disorders like Alzheimer's disease, and many forms of cancer. As scientists and doctors, we have learned that it is not an easy technology to implement and requires materials that can deliver the genetic drugs effectively and without toxicity. The fastest way to new materials is through the miniaturization of existing materials (a tenet of nanotechnology). Researchers are now discovering all sorts of nanomaterials (through NNI-funded efforts like the National Cancer Institute's Centers of Cancer Nanotechnology Excellence) that show extraordinary promise for the effective use of such therapies in humans. I am convinced that nanotechnology will play a lead role in finding cures for these diseases. On the diagnostic side, NNI-funded efforts like the National Science Foundation's Nanoscale Science and Engineering Centers have discovered powerful new ways of detecting and tracking disease markers at very early stages--stages that cannot be detected with conventional tools and when therapeutics can be more effective. They have created ways of differentiating patient populations to determine which ones will respond to a given therapeutic and which ones will not. This not only improves patient care but also substantially lowers the cost of healthcare, since many costly therapeutics are now often broadly (and needlessly) distributed to the American population, when their effectiveness is in question for a significant portion of it. In the area of energy, we need new advances in solar energy technologies, batteries, and biofuels. Meaningful advances in these areas have been hampered over the last decade because existing materials do not offer the properties required for a given application. Again, nanotechnology is leading the way to solving these problems. New plants are being built and jobs are being created. Companies like A123 have used nanotechnological approaches to create powerful new batteries that are being built in Michigan and will go into some of the current and future lines of electric cars and commercial vehicles. After only a decade, it is simply remarkable to see basic science already transition into meaningful commercial successes. Innovation and the related job creation will likely continue at an accelerated rate if we maintain a well-coordinated, and implemented NNI. What are the challenges going forward? Based upon my personal observations and the Committee that wrote the world overview report, we should not be discussing the renewal of the NNI but rather its expansion--a tough but critical decision in troubled economic times. The United States cannot afford to lose its competitive edge in nanotechnology over the next decade, and an expanded, well-coordinated and targeted NNI is the only effective way to accomplish this objective. There are three primary areas, which need to be addressed, including: 1. Strengthening the NNI management structure, 2. Developing strategies for future investment in both research and education/training, and 3. Dealing with environment, health, and safety (EHS) issues potentially posed by nanotechnology. I would like to share with you my recommendations in two of these three areas. I will not focus on EHS since we have other experts providing testimony on this topic. In the management area, the National Nanotechnology Coordination Office (or NNCO) should broaden its impact and efficacy and improve its ability to coordinate and develop NNI programs and policies related to those programs. The OSTP should facilitate these improvements by taking the following actions: First, require each agency in the NNI to have senior representatives with decision-making authority participate in coordination activities of the NNI. Second, strengthen the NNCO to enhance its ability to act as the coordinating entity for the NNI. Third, mandate that the NNCO develop metrics for nanotechnology-specific program outputs and that it work with the Bureau of Economic Analysis to develop meaningful metrics and to collect data on the economic impacts of the NNI. PCAST estimated that 0.3 percent of NNI funding should be dedicated to the NNCO in order to ensure the appropriate staffing and budget to effectively develop, monitor, and assess NNI programs. With regard to strategies for future investments, the NNI should maintain a parallel focus on basic research and its translation into commercializable products and processes. We cannot have the latter without the former. With a budget planning process coordinated by OSTP, each agency would continually re-evaluate its NNI balance of investments among the Program Component Areas. Each area should enhance its focus on commercialization and double its investment in nanomanufacturing over the next five years, while maintaining the current level of investment in basic research. The NNI should have a focus on signature initiatives such as the development of nanomaterials to enable the development of nanomedicine, advanced nanomanufacturing, and nanomaterials for environmental monitoring and remediation. Each Signature Initiative's lead agency should develop coordinated milestones, promote strong educational components, and create public-private partnerships to leverage the outcomes of the Initiatives. Each lead agency also should develop strategies for monitoring, evaluating, and disseminating outcomes. The opportunities in this field are immense, but we need a way to identify and coordinate national centers of excellence that act as international hubs to attract the best and the brightest in the field, and train the next generation of workers and leaders in nanomanufacturing. In the area of education, the agencies of the NNI should continue making investments in innovative and effective education, and the NNCO should consider commissioning a comprehensive evaluation of the outcomes of the overall investment in NNI education. As products are being commercialized and nanotech industries are being built, we must have a parallel effort in student training and education. These are the folks who will become the workers and leaders in these new companies. I just visited one of our companies, NanoInk, and they are producing products that are very important to the pharmaceutical industry for high throughput drug screening applications. Pharmaceutical companies want to use these tools in-house immediately, but they do not have a competent workforce available to handle them. Universities need to train a new workforce and retrain an old one, so that these positions can be filled with highly qualified individuals at the pace of the nanotechnology industry development. The NNI should play an important role in making this happen for the field at large. In conclusion, I strongly believe that advances in nanotechnology will continue to play a critical part on the world economic stage and that it is imperative that the U.S. continue to support, strengthen, and expand the NNI in order to maintain its competitive edge. I thank you for your time, attention, and service to the country, and am happy to answer any questions that you may have. Senator Nelson. Thank you. Dr. Romine? STATEMENT OF DR. CHARLES H. ROMINE, ACTING ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR, LABORATORY PROGRAMS, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF STANDARDS AND TECHNOLOGY, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE Dr. Romine. Chairman Nelson, Ranking Member Boozman, and members of the Subcommittee, thanks for the opportunity to appear before you today to testify about NIST's role in nanotechnology and nanomanufacturing. The administration has aggressively worked to promote the growth of basic and applied nanotechnology. In February 2011, the National Science and Technology Council released the National Nanotechnology Initiative Strategic Plan. NIST has a key role in this initiative. As the benefits of the NNI continue to accrue, the role of NIST and the breadth of its innovation-related programs will become even more important in ensuring that the end results match the promise in terms of new jobs and revolutionary technologies that benefit the Nation's economy and the American people. NIST is uniquely equipped to develop the improvements in measurements and standards that are essential for the adoption of advanced technologies needed by U.S. manufacturers to compete more effectively in the global technology-intensive products market. The nanotechnology-related research conducted in NIST's laboratories and user facilities develops measurements, standards, and data crucial to a wide range of industries and Federal agencies. NIST has a history of serving the needs of manufacturing sectors. One high-profile area of current support is in the measurements of a nanoscale material, graphene. Graphene, the subject of the 2010 Nobel Prize in Physics, is one of the most promising materials for the next generation of semiconductor devices needed to make electronic devices ever smaller and faster. Working closely with academic and industrial partners, NIST has recently completed the most advanced ultra-low temperature scanning probe microscope in the world, allowing an international team of researchers to measure key properties of graphene. As a result of NIST research, multiple components of this microscope are now products being sold by U.S. companies. NIST has a history of working with industry through public- private partnerships and other consortia. For example, NIST's partnership with the Nanoelectronics Research Initiative, the NRI, a consortium that brings together the semiconductor electronics industry, government agencies, and universities, has leveraged a modest NIST investment, $2.75 million per year, by $5 million per year from industry partners and $15 million per year from states to support projects at 30 universities to work in 4 regional centers. The partnership has attracted state and private funding to support business development and commercialization. NIST-NRI interactions are currently supporting over 100 graduate students and have produced scientific publications as well as patented technologies. The President's 2012 budget request outlines nanomanufacturing research priorities at NIST that include developing measurement capabilities for large-scale nanomanufacturing and the manufacture of cost-competitive solar technologies that incorporate nanoscale structures. As part of the Materials Genome Initiative announced recently by the President, NIST will work together with other agencies to develop the design tools needed to accelerate materials development for industry. NIST will also continue close and targeted interaction with other agencies in NNI's signature initiative, Sustainable Manufacturing. In February 2011, NIST hosted a workshop in support of this initiative on the topic of technical challenges to the commercial development of high-performance carbon-based nanomaterials. Nanotechnology standards foster greater industry and consumer confidence, resulting in accelerated deployment of new products. NIST actively leads the development of international nanotechnology standards and guidelines. An understanding of the environmental, health, and safety of nanomaterials and nanotechnology-based products, known as NanoEHS, is critical for the responsible development and oversight of nanotechnology. NIST research in NanoEHS provides the underpinning science and measurement needed for a science-based approach to risk management. In Fiscal Year 2012, NIST plans to further develop validated measurement methods, tools, standards, and protocols that help to enhance understanding of the safety of nanomaterials. NIST's Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology is the nation's only nanotechnology user facility established with a focus on commerce. An important goal of the NIST's CNST is to reduce measurement barriers to innovation by providing access to world-class nanoscale measurement and fabrication methods and technologies. Industry access to these resources will help accelerate nanotechnology transfer to the marketplace. The number of commercial users has roughly doubled on an annual basis over the past three years. The nanofabrication facility at the CNST is a world-class shared resource, home to major commercial measurement and processing tools. The NanoFab has streamlined the process to obtain access to the facility. In Fiscal Year 2010, the CNST hosted nearly a thousand researchers, including a small company whose entrepreneur needed the tools to turn an invention into a working prototype, to a large company, using the CNST resources to develop future supercomputing technologies. The President's 2012 budget request includes $5.18 million to replace and update the equipment in the CNST so that it can continue to meet the needs of growing numbers of industry customers and other stakeholders. In conclusion, the breadth of the programmatic activities uniquely positions NIST to provide the underpinnings that will foster the transfer of new technologies into products for commercial and public benefit. Thank you for the opportunity to discuss NIST's nanomanufacturing activities, and I'm happy to answer any questions you may have. [The prepared statement of Dr. Romine follows:] Prepared Statement of Dr. Charles H. Romine, Acting Associate Director, Laboratory Programs, National Institute of Standards and Technology, U.S. Department of Commerce Introduction Chairman Nelson, Ranking Member Boozman, and members of the Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today to testify about the Department of Commerce's National Institute of Standards and Technology's (NIST) role in nanotechnology and nanomanufacturing. The Administration has aggressively worked to promote the growth of basic and applied nanotechnology. In February 2011, the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) released the National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI) Strategic Plan. The goals of this plan are to advance a world-class nanotechnology research and development program, move nanotechnology discoveries from the laboratory into new products for commercial and public benefit, encourage more students and teachers to become involved in nanotechnology education, create a skilled workforce and the supporting infrastructure and tools to advance nanotechnology and to support the responsible development of nanotechnology. NIST has a key role in this initiative, consistent with its mission to promote U.S. innovation and industrial competitiveness by advancing measurement science, standards, and technology in ways that enhance economic security and improve our quality of life. Specifically, in the area of nanotechnology, NIST has a number of existing and planned programs that support the development, adoption, manufacture, commercialization, and use of nanotechnology-based innovations and products. Furthermore, the NIST efforts in the area of nanotechnology have been a key element of the NNI, of which NIST is one of 25 participating agencies. As the benefits of the NNI continue to accrue, the role of NIST and breadth of its innovation-related programs will become even more important in ensuring that the end results match the promise in terms of new jobs and revolutionary technologies that benefit the Nation's economy and the American people. Providing Industry with the Measurements and Technology to Support Innovation NIST is uniquely equipped to develop the improvements in measurements and standards that are essential for the adoption of advanced technologies needed by U.S. manufacturers to compete more effectively in the global technology-intensive products market. The nanotechnology-related research conducted in NIST's laboratories and user facilities develops measurements, standards, and data crucial to a wide range of industries and Federal agencies. NIST has a history of serving the needs of manufacturing sectors. NIST's work with the semiconductor electronics industry provides one compelling example. The 2007 ``Economic Impact of Measurement in the Semiconductor Industry'' report estimated that the $12 billion spent on advancing measurement capabilities during the decade beginning in 1996 will have saved that sector more than $51 billion in scrap and rework costs by 2011--a net benefit of $39 billion \\1\\. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\1\\ http://www.nist.gov/director/planning/upload/report07-2.pdf --------------------------------------------------------------------------- One high-profile area of current support to this industry is in measurements of the nanoscale material graphene. Graphene, the subject of the 2010 Nobel Prize in Physics, is one of the most promising materials for the next generation of semiconductor devices needed to make electronic devices ever smaller and faster. Working closely with academic and industrial partners, NIST has recently completed the most advanced ultra-low temperature scanning probe microscope in the world, allowing an international team of researchers to measure key properties of graphene with unprecedented resolution. This unique instrument includes multiple components developed jointly with NIST that are now products being sold by U.S. companies. Measurements and modeling by NIST researchers are helping electronics industry manufacturers to develop improved and new processes for the nanofabrication of electronics components like microprocessors and memory chips. For example, following on a semiconductor industry roadmap determination that copper interconnects would be needed to manufacture smaller and faster devices, NIST researchers identified critical technical barriers and developed a new predictive modeling tool. The model helped lower the cost of R&D and reduced the time to production, resulting in an estimated NIST benefit- to-cost ratio of 5.8 and a net benefit for industry of over $9 million, according to a NIST 2008 economic analysis.\\2\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\2\\ http://www.nist.gov/director/planning/upload/report08-1.pdf --------------------------------------------------------------------------- NIST employs a number of tools to enable technology and knowledge transfer from NIST to promote U.S. competitiveness, including cooperative R&D agreements, facility use agreements, and intellectual property tools such as NIST inventions, patents, and licenses. NIST is home to a significant number of Associates and Guest Researchers, including summer undergraduate students and postdoctoral researchers, who develop technical expertise at NIST before continuing in their scientific careers. NIST has a history of working with industry through public-private partnerships and other consortia. These groups help drive manufacturing research priorities and leverage investments. For example, NIST's partnership with the Nanoelectronics Research Initiative (NRI), a consortium that brings together the semiconductor electronics industry, government agencies, and universities, has leveraged a modest NIST investment ($2.75 million per year) by $5 million per year from industry partners and $15 million per year from states to support projects at 30 universities to work in 4 regional centers. The partnership has attracted $110 million over 5 years in state and private funding to support business development and commercialization. NIST/NRI interactions are currently supporting 111 graduate students and have produced 159 scientific publications as well as patented technologies (3 issued and 2 filed). NIST is also engaged with industry consortia in the areas of flexible electronics and neutron-based measurements for the manufacture of soft materials such as chemicals, petroleum products, and pharmaceuticals. The President's 2012 budget request outlines research priorities at NIST that are specific to needs in nanomanufacturing. This includes developing the measurement knowledge and capabilities to enable cost- effective in-line measurement techniques for closed-loop process control, thereby overcoming a major obstacle to large-scale nanomanufacturing. In addition, NIST researchers are planning to develop and demonstrate measurement capabilities required to overcome barriers to the manufacture of cost-competitive third-generation solar technologies, which incorporate molecular films, quantum dots, nanoscale crystals, and other nanoscale structures. As part of the Materials Genome Initiative announced recently by the President, NIST will work together with other agencies to develop the computational and design tools needed to accelerate materials development for industry. Also in Fiscal Year 2012, NIST will continue close and targeted interaction with other agencies in the three NNI Nanotechnology Signature Initiatives: Sustainable Nanomanufacturing, Nanotechnology for Solar Energy Collection and Conversion, and Nanoelectronics for 2020 and Beyond. In February 2011, NIST organized and hosted a workshop in support of the Sustainable Nanomanufacturing initiative, on the topic of carbon nanostructured materials. This event brought together stakeholders from industry, academia, and government to identify the technical challenges to the commercial development of high-performance, carbon-based nanomaterials, and discuss potential pathways to establishing a public-private consortium to address these challenges. Providing the Scientific Basis to Support the Safe and Responsible Deployment of Nanotechnology Nanotechnology standards foster greater industry and consumer confidence, resulting in accelerated deployment of new products. NIST staff members actively lead the development of international nanotechnology standards and guidelines conducted through international fora and coordinated with other agencies through the NSTC. Altogether these activities create favorable conditions for the responsible transfer of nanotechnologies into products for commercial and public benefit. An understanding of the environmental, health and safety aspects of nanomaterials and nanotechnology-based products (NanoEHS) is critical for the responsible development and oversight of nanotechnology. NIST research in NanoEHS provides the underpinning science and measurement needed for a science-based approach to risk management. Policymakers and regulators can use the information to ensure that the U.S. is supporting innovation, encouraging new technologies, and not creating trade barriers. NIST's NanoEHS activities provide information and data for research institutions, regulatory agencies, the public, and industry. NIST activities include the development of reference materials for widely produced nanomaterials used in a broad range of applications, including electronics, personal care products, and construction materials. Examples include the first gold nanoparticle standard reference material; providing technical support and help to lead development of documentary standards that enable consistent and reproducible measurements of nanomaterial properties; and developing instruments and transferable methods to measure key properties of nanomaterials as needed by industry and regulatory agencies to make sound, science-based risk assessments. NIST's Fiscal Year 2012 request will increase NIST's ability to further develop validated measurement methods, tools, standards, and protocols that help to enhance understanding of the safety of nanomaterials and their mechanisms of interaction with the environment and humans with a focus on nanomaterials of greatest concern based on such factors as production volume, widespread use in products, and the potential for hazard or likelihood of exposure. NIST will continue to coordinate its NanoEHS program with other Federal agencies' activities through the nanotechnology subcommittee of the NSTC, using the 2011 NNI Environmental, Health and Safety Research Strategy \\3\\ as a framing document. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\3\\ Draft publicly available; awaiting final clearance. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Providing Industry and Academia Access to Advanced Nanofabrication Facilities NIST's Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology (CNST), is the Nation's only nanotechnology user facility established with a focus on commerce. An important goal of the NIST CNST is to reduce measurement barriers to innovation, by providing industry, academia, and other government agencies with access to world-class nanoscale measurement and fabrication methods and technology. NIST has undertaken a sustained effort to reach out to industrial researchers whose access to these resources will help accelerate nanotechnology transfer to the marketplace; the number of industry users has roughly doubled on an annual basis since Fiscal Year 2008. The NIST CNST mission is guided by an understanding that rapid commercial development of nanotechnology--in particular, the speed with which industry can bring a specific new nanotechnology from discovery to production--depends critically on the availability and efficacy of applicable metrology tools and processes at each stage of the transition. Developing these tools and processes will have an immediate and significant impact on the commercial viability of nanotechnologies in a diverse array of fields, such as electronics, computation, information storage, medical diagnostics and therapeutics, and national security and defense. The Nanofabrication facility (NanoFab) at the NIST CNST is a world- class, 60,000 square foot shared resource for nanofabrication and measurement--with over 19,000 square feet of cleanroom laboratory space and over 90 major commercial measurement and processing tools. To meet specific needs of industry, the NIST NanoFab has created a rapid, easy process for users to obtain equitable access to the facility, whether or not they are doing proprietary research. Research at the NIST NanoFab can be done by individual users or alongside a technical expert from the NIST NanoFab staff, imparting flexibility to industry users depending on the nature of the research and individual competencies. In the few years since its inception, the NIST CNST has become a major national resource for nanoscale science and the development of nanotechnology. Having now completed its initial ramp up in staff, equipment, facilities, and processes, the NIST CNST is continuing to expand on its strategic relationships and collaborations with industrial and academic partners. In Fiscal Year 2010 the NIST CNST hosted nearly 1,000 researchers from companies, government institutions, and universities from across 39 states and the District of Columbia; during the same period NIST NanoFab tool use increased by 90 percent. Corporate researchers ranged from a small company, needing the tools to turn an invention into a working prototype, to a large company, using the NIST CNST resources to reduce the development cycle time of future supercomputer technologies. The President's Fiscal Year 2012 Budget Request includes $5.18 million for the recapitalization of the NIST CNST. This funding is needed to replace and update the equipment and instrumentation in the NIST CNST so that it can continue to meet the nanoscale measurement and fabrication needs of growing numbers of industry customers and other stakeholders. Accelerating the Development of Transformational Technologies NIST external partnership programs provide a coordinated set of activities to meet manufacturing challenges. The Technology Innovation Program (TIP) funds small companies and joint ventures comprised of businesses, institutions of higher education and other organizations such as national laboratories or nonprofit research institutes to support high-risk transformational R&D. The 2010 TIP competition focused on manufacturing technologies, resulting in awards to small companies and joint ventures producing a range of nanotechnology- enabled products in areas including flexible liquid crystal displays, organic photovoltaics, and lithium-ion batteries. In its Fiscal Year 2012 budget request, the Administration proposed the creation of the Advanced Manufacturing Technology Consortia Program (AMTech) at NIST. AMTech was also included in the President's recent Advanced Manufacturing Partnership (AMP) initiative that is aimed at strengthening support for U.S. manufacturing. The AMTech program will address a critical need for early stage technology development by providing incentives for the formation of, and providing resources to, industry-led consortia that will support precompetitive R&D, thereby enabling technology development and creating the infrastructure necessary for more efficient transfer of technology. AMTech builds on lessons learned from NIST's partnership with the NRI, which I mentioned previously. In addition, although similar to TIP in the pursuit of high-risk, high-reward research, the AMTech program brings together multiple players in the innovation cycle, under a single consortium, to accelerate the pace of innovation in a particular industry sector. This strategy has the potential to drive economic growth, enhance competitiveness and spur the creation of jobs in high-value sectors of the U.S. economy. Finally, the nationwide network of Hollings Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) centers helps small and medium manufacturers strengthen their competitive positions. The MEP system does this by accelerating the adoption of technological innovations, facilitating the adoption of environmentally sustainable business practices, providing training and assistance to increase exports, promoting renewable energy initiatives, fostering market diversification, and connecting domestic suppliers to manufacturers. All of these services are to assist manufacturers in successfully competing over the long term in today's complex global manufacturing environment. Conclusion In conclusion, there is a breadth of programmatic activities at NIST covering scientific discovery, measurement science, standards development, and technology transfer relating to nanomanufacturing. NIST programs span all stages of the innovation ecosystem that enable the development and implementation of advanced technologies. These programs will help U.S. industry become more efficient and competitive. NIST is uniquely positioned to provide the scientific underpinnings for these emerging technologies that will foster the transfer of new technologies into products for commercial and public benefit. I thank the Subcommittee for allowing me to discuss NIST's nanomanufacturing activities and I welcome the opportunity to answer any questions you may have. Dr. Charles (Chuck) H.

Senator Nelson. Thank you. Dr. Leslie-Pelecky? STATEMENT OF DIANDRA L. LESLIE-PELECKY, Ph.D., DIRECTOR, WEST VIRGINIA NANO INITIATIVE; PROFESSOR OF PHYSICS, WEST VIRGINIA UNIVERSITY Dr. Leslie-Pelecky. Thank you very much. I'd like to echo my colleagues' thanks for the invitation to testify here today. And I want to emphasize this really isn't an abstract thanks, because the NNI has had a huge impact on moving my own research from very fundamental to more applied. Just to give you an idea of what I do, I think most of you in the room are old enough to remember a toy called Wooly Willy. It's a picture of a guy's face with iron filings. You use a magnet to make a beard and hair and things. I do the same thing with magnetic nanoparticles. What we do is we attach chemotherapy drugs to the magnetic nanoparticles. We inject them, and then I use a magnet to hold them where I want them, which is near cancer tumors. By doing this, we concentrate the chemotherapy drugs. That allows them to be more efficacious and also decreases side effects. Now, our work has been funded by the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health. We've also run into situations where our work is too disease-focused for NSF but not quite disease-focused enough for NIH. Funding agencies have started having coordinated funding--calls for funding, but more coordination is necessary to ensure that these ideas that are sort of out of the funding box don't get lost and they can move from that eureka moment to actual applications. One of those interesting concepts that I've been learning about is called bioactivity. And that characterizes how nanomaterials interact with living organisms in the environment. It should seem like bioactivity of a nanomaterial is something we really ought to be able to predict. But it turns out that the same surprising properties of nanomaterials that make them so useful often sometimes surprise us when we look at how they interact with the biological systems. We can create new nanomaterials in a matter of days. It can take us up to months to really understand the bioactivity of those materials. We've developed an amazing ability to make new materials. Now we need to advance the understanding of bioactivity to catch up with our ability to make materials. I moved to West Virginia recently in part because of the proximity of West Virginia University to the National Institutes of Occupational Safety and Health. Collaborations between our two organizations are making exciting progress on understanding the bioactivity of nanomaterials. One of those lines of research is developing microfluidic devices for real- time analyses. These devices could allow a researcher or a company to learn within minutes how a brand new nanomaterial would interact with different types of cells. These sensors could be used to monitor the presence of nanoparticles in the work environment. They could be used for homeland security purposes. There are really exciting opportunities for companies that are capable of doing rapid, accurate bioactivity screening. This knowledge is extremely valuable for industries. Companies need the data to convince them to invest in new technologies. They want to know that their products are safe, and they want to know how to keep their workers safe. Even more importantly, those companies which are developing new nano- enabled products would benefit from better guidance as to the likely bioactivity of new materials. Now, the situation of not being able to predict bioactivity greatly complicates regulation. It's basically like being asked to referee a game for which you didn't know all the rules. Consequently, nanomaterials have to be regulated on a case-by- case basis according to their actual properties, not some potentially superfluous characteristic such as size. That means the regulatory agencies must be nimble and able to adapt as our knowledge changes. Let me conclude by briefly addressing a topic that sometimes gets lost in all of our excitement about the possibilities of nanomaterials, and that's the need for education. So when I was in graduate school, I studied physics. I worked with physicists. Now I study nanomedicine. I work with medical doctors, biologists, toxicologists, pathologists, not to mention chemists, engineers, and occasionally the odd physicist or two. Nanomaterials transcends boundaries. It's a very different type of training than the discipline-based education that all of us went through. We need to invest in developing the most effective and efficient ways of educating the next generation of scientists and engineers who will lead the way. But we also need to educate lawyers and business people, elected officials, regulatory officers, and venture capitalists about the realities of nanotechnology, especially as they pertain to specialized sectors of the economy, like energy, health, and the environment. Most importantly perhaps, in my view, is educating all citizens to be able to make informed decisions about nanotechnology. Nanomaterials will eventually affect all facets of our lives, and some of them have been pointed out-- everything from medical care to the cars we drive and the food we eat. Consumer understanding of nanomaterials is a prerequisite to their acceptance and thus realizing the huge potential of nanotechnology to improve our country, our economy, and our quality of life. The NNI has facilitated the growth and development of this very important field. Reauthorization of the NNI must include coordination of effort among multiple government agencies; increasing understanding of nanomaterials bioactivity to facilitate safe and responsible use; and supporting infrastructure necessary for future research, development, and commercialization. Finally, the NNI must promote education at all levels, from the future scientists and engineers that will enable us to maintain global leadership in nanotechnology to helping the public make informed decisions about the role nanotechnology will play in their lives. Thank you again for the opportunity to address you about this very important issue. [The prepared statement of Dr. Leslie-Pelecky follows:] Prepared Statement of Diandra L. Leslie-Pelecky, Ph.D., Director, West Virginia Nano Initiative; Professor of Physics, West Virginia University The National Nanotechnology Initiative has had a tremendous impact in producing new materials for potential commercial applications, advancing fundamental knowledge, and developing a scientific and engineering workforce that has made the United States a global nanotechnology leader. Re-authorization of the NNI will ensure that the U.S. retains this leadership and will promote the transfer of basic knowledge to applications with important economic and societal impacts in energy, health and medicine, environmental monitoring and remediation, and homeland security. Nanotechnology is highly interdisciplinary and ranges from basic research to applications, making it critical for funding agencies to coordinate their efforts. Recent interagency calls for proposals in targeted areas involving nanotechnology must be continued and expanded upon to ensure that important research areas receive the necessary support. Realizing societal and economic benefits depends critically on establishing scientifically valid principles for responsibly developing and using nanotechnology. We have much to learn about nanomaterial bioactivity: how a material interacts with biological organisms and the environment. In particular, we need to understand the relationships between physicochemical properties of nanomaterials and their bioactivity to enable ``safety by design''. Regulation of nanomaterials is important to corporate and consumer adoption of this new technology. Companies need confidence that their products and manufacturing methods are safe for consumers and workers, while the development of new nanomaterials and nanotechnologies will benefit from being able to focus effort in the directions that are most likely to produce safe products. Nanomaterials are a unique form of matter and we do not yet have all the knowledge we need to develop complete regulations for nanomaterials. Acquiring this knowledge must be a priority and nanomaterials regulation must remain flexible enough to adapt to our evolving understanding. A potentially large market exists for products and services that determine nanomaterial bioactivity quickly and precisely. Sectors that would benefit include nanomanfacturing, homeland security, health and medicine, and a wide spectrum of basic and applied research. Nanotechnology research requires significant infrastructure for its continued development. Once-exotic instruments like electron microscopes are now basic tools for research and development. Funding opportunities to acquire these basic tools (some of which cost a half-million to a few million dollars) need to be developed. New state-of-the-art tools need to be invented and made available on a regional basis. Education is a priority to ensure our continuing world leadership in nanotechnology, to transfer basic discoveries to applications, and to ensure public acceptance of nanotechnology. Educating the next generation of scientists and engineers requires new models at undergraduate and graduate levels that focus on integrating diverse fields without sacrificing depth of knowledge in core disciplines; Lawyers, businesspersons, venture capitalists, elected officials, and government regulators need to acquire knowledge about specific nanomaterials and their applications to allow informed decision making; Basic science and engineering education at the K-12 level is a pre-requisite for future scientists and engineers--but more importantly, it is critical for all citizens to develop fundamental scientific literacy so that they can make informed decisions about the roles nanomaterials will play in their lives. Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee, my name is Diandra Leslie-Pelecky and I am the Director of the West Virginia Nano Initiative and Professor of Physics at West Virginia University. Thank you for the opportunity to testify today regarding the impact of the National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI) and its reauthorization. This is not an abstract thanks, as I am one of literally thousands of scientists and engineers who have had the opportunity to contribute in some small way to the huge advances in our understanding of nanomaterials because of the government's commitment to nanotechnology and its potential impact on our country's future through the NNI. Reauthorization of the NNI will further our basic understanding of nanomaterials, and help transform that knowledge into products and services that will benefit the people of the United State and our economy. The idea that one can change the basic properties of a material simply by changing its size introduced a major paradigm shift in science and engineering. The possibilities for using nanomaterials to solve some of the country's most important problems--like more efficiently transforming and storing energy, or detecting diseases like cancer when there are only a few cancerous cells present--are moving ideas from the realm of science fiction to reality. Despite having worked in nanomaterials my entire career, I had a very traditional preparation to become a physicist. I started out studying the fundamental properties of magnetic nanoparticles-- particles about a thousandth the width of a human hair--trying to understand how their magnetism changes as their size varies. About eight years ago, I was inspired to consider how these magnetic nanoparticles might be applied. You may remember a toy called Woolly Willy--a drawing of a man's face in a container that also contained iron filings. You use a magnet to move the iron filings around to create a beard or hair. I do something analogous with magnetic nanoparticles. I attach chemotherapy drugs to the nanoparticles, inject them, and then use magnets outside the body to hold the nanoparticles where I want them--which is at cancer tumors. This magnetic targeting approach allows us to concentrate the chemotherapy drugs near the tumor, increasing efficacy and decreasing side effects. This is how I entered the field of nanomedicine, which uses the unique properties of nanomaterials to detect and treat disease. Like many of the hybrid fields that have evolved from nanomaterials research, nanomedicine sometimes finds itself at the edges of two or more funding agency mandates. Our work has been funded by the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health, but we've also found that some aspects of the research are too disease focused for NSF, but not focused enough for NIH. Funding agencies have started to issue joint calls for proposals in the last few years, but more coordination is necessary to ensure that ideas that don't fit neatly in a funding ``box'' can still move from the eureka moment to application. It is especially important to address the gap between the basic research pursued in most universities and the very applied work that immediately precedes commercialization. As I continued working in nanomedicine, I've learned about a concept called `bioactivity', which characterizes how nanomaterials interact with living organisms and the environment. My nanoparticles are designed to enter the body, locate near the tumor and release their chemotherapy drugs. After their mission is accomplished, the nanoparticles are metabolized by the body into oxygen and iron, both of which can be used or easily removed by the body. We do extensive tests to ensure that our nanoparticles' bioactivity is limited to cancer cells. It might seem like the bioactivity of a material is something that we ought to be able to predict; however, the same surprising properties that we want to utilize to treat diseases and use energy more efficiently also sometimes surprise us when we look at how the materials interact with biological systems. Some materials have a threshold size, below which they start having undesired consequences. We can combine two materials that are fine on their own, but produce an undesired bioactivity when combined. Bioactivity has to be experimentally determined nanomaterial by nanomaterial. We can create new nanomaterials in a matter of days; however, it takes several months for us to investigate and really understand the bioactivity of just one of those nanomaterials. Nanomaterials have turned the basic tenets of toxicology on their heads. We must support the basic research necessary to develop predictive capabilities for nanomaterials bioactivity. We have exceptional abilities in producing new nanomaterials of all kinds. Now, we need to advance our understanding of bioactivity to catch up with the rapid development of new nanomaterials. I moved to West Virginia last year in part because of the proximity of West Virginia University to the National Institutes of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). Collaborations between our organizations are producing some of the most exciting progress on understanding the bioactivity of naturally occurring and human-made nanomaterials. As the production of nanomaterials increases from lab quantities to nanomanufacturing-scale amounts, companies and regulatory agencies are going to need the type of information we collect on the intended and unintended environmental, health and safety impacts of nanomaterials. Companies are uneasy about investing in new technologies that have so many unanswered questions. Companies need to know that their products are safe, and what steps they need to take to ensure that their workers have a safe environment. Even more importantly, companies developing new products would benefit significantly by being able to access a broad database of knowledge of environmental health and safety effects that could help predict the behavior of new nanomaterials and combinations of nanomaterials. The ability to develop appropriate guidelines and regulations are hampered by lack of basic knowledge about nanomaterials bioactivity. Imagine being asked to referee a game for which you didn't know all the rules. The rules for nanomaterials are not likely to be simple, either. Nanomaterial bioactivity doesn't depend simply on size or shape or chemical composition. Nanomaterials must be regulated on a case-by-case basis according to their actual properties, not simple and possibly superfluous characteristics such as size. Regulatory agencies must be knowledgeable and nimble, willing to change as our knowledge increases. There's an unfortunate perception that emphasis on understanding the environmental health and safety aspects of nanomaterials is a hindrance to using nanomaterials to drive the economy. Understanding nanomaterials bioactivity is a critical component of developing safe products and building consumer confidence in nanotechnology. It's also a potential business opportunity. For example, researchers at West Virginia University and NIOSH are working on a microfluidic device that uses different types of cells as sensors to perform a real-time analysis of nanomaterials bioactivity. This device could allow a researcher or a company to learn within minutes how a new nanomaterial interacts with each different type of cell. There are industrial possibilities for developing sensors that monitor the presence of nanoparticles in the work environment or for homeland security purposes, and opportunities for companies capable of doing rapid, accurate bioactivity screening. Realizing these opportunities requires advancing our basic understanding of nanomaterials bioactivity, which in turn requires infrastructure. The multifaceted nature of nanomaterials demands multiple characterization measurements, many of them pressing at the boundaries of what we are able to measure. The government has done an outstanding job making high-cost instrumentation available on a regional basis at national laboratories, such as the NSF-funded National Nanotechnology Infrastructure Network. These facilities make important contributions to research, but also provide unique educational opportunities for nanotechnology students. Once-exotic instruments like electron microscopes are now basic tools that are required for nanomaterials research. There are a very limited number of funding opportunities for universities to acquire instruments in the half-million dollar to few million dollar range. These instruments do far more than facilitate research--they provide training opportunities for the next generations of nanotechnology researchers and developers. Let me conclude by briefly addressing an aspect of nanotechnology that often gets lost: the need for education at many different levels. In graduate school, I studied physics and I worked with physicists. Now I study nanomedicine and I work with medical doctors, biologists, toxicologists, and pathologists--not to mention chemists, engineers and other physicists. I've learned almost an entirely new vocabulary in the last eight years. The undergraduate and graduate students working in my labs need to learn very different things than I learned when I went through school. Nanomaterials transcends disciplinary boundaries, requiring students to develop breadth of knowledge while still gaining expertise in their core discipline. Today's students won't be working in a small group of like-minded people in a single lab: they need to learn how to work with groups of people from very different backgrounds, on a wide spectrum of instrumentation. They need to learn about the importance of fundamental research, but they also need to learn about industrial applications of nanomaterials and entrepreneurship. This is a major departure from the discipline-based education most of us are used to and we need to invest in developing the most effective and efficient ways of educating the next generation of scientists and engineers. Perhaps more importantly, we need to educate lawyers and businesspeople, elected officials, regulatory officers and venture capitalists about the realities of nanotechnology, especially as they pertain to specialized sectors of the economy like energy, health, and the environment. They need to utilize a principle of science that we often fail to communicate: cutting-edge scientific knowledge is dynamic and constantly evolving. Patent examiners, policy makers and the government scientists responsible for creating a stable and predictable regulatory climate will have learn how to adapt to our changing knowledge in a proactive and not reactive way. Most importantly, in my view, is educating all citizens to make informed decisions about nanotechnology. This education starts in the K-12 system by building fundamental science and math literacy-- something we are not doing very well at present. Our efforts need to be focused beyond developing curricula that define and explain nanomaterials. We need to emphasize the more fundamental objective of teaching people how to think critically. We need to switch the focus of education from memorizing information that any teenager can pull up in a microsecond from her phone to teaching that student how to synthesize and use that information to make valid decisions. As the author of a science book written specifically for non- scientists, I have a lot more contact with the public than your average physics professor. What surprised me most was how hard the average person is willing to work to learn about science--if you can show them how it affects something they care about. Nanomaterials will eventually affect all facets of our lives, from our medical care to the cars we drive and the food we eat. Consumer understanding of nanomaterials is a pre-requisite to realizing the huge potential of nanotechnology to improve our country, our economy and our quality of life. The National Nanotechnology Initiative has facilitated the growth and development of this very important field. Re-authorization of the NNI must include coordination of effort among multiple government agencies, increasing understanding of the environmental health and safety impacts of nanomaterials to facilitate their safe and responsible use in consumer products, and supporting the infrastructure necessary for future research and development. Finally, the NNI must promote education at all levels, from the future scientists and engineers that will enable us to maintain global leadership in nanotechnology, to developing the scientific literacy of the public so that they can make informed decisions about the role of nanotechnology in their lives. Thank you again for the opportunity to provide input on this very important issue. Senator Nelson. Thank you. Dr. O'Neal? STATEMENT OF DR. THOMAS O'NEAL, ASSOCIATE VICE PRESIDENT OF RESEARCH, OFFICE OF RESEARCH AND COMMERCIALIZATION, UNIVERSITY OF CENTRAL FLORIDA Dr. O'Neal. Let me echo my thanks for the opportunity to speak with you, Mr. Chairman, and the Committee about this very important issue. Again, I'll state from the start that I'm fully in support of renewing and expanding the National Nanotechnology Initiative. And I think that it has made us a global leader in the development of nanotechnology, and I really think we need to maintain that effort. I'm from UCF. It's a growing university. If you're not familiar with it, we're actually the second largest university in the country now, just over 40 years old. So we're a new growing entity, if you will, and we've done a lot of experiments. One thing we did was take a look at our ecosystem in terms of how to commercialize technologies and realized, in one sense, there were a lot of resources on land or air, but we're kind of like a sixth grade dance where all the girls and boys shut up and nobody's really dancing. So we try to figure out ways to bring people together. And we created our incubator initially to commercialize technology. But we ended up doing a whole lot more than that. We ended up being the neutral site, if you will, for folks to come together and kind of act like a magnifying glass, if you will, to bring the community together to commercialize technologies. I want to certainly say today that I think we need to continue this investment. It will keep us competitive and dominant in the world for years to come. And by that, I mean, you really need to almost consider doubling the university--the Federal investment in research. We need to make sure we have the dominant supply of intellectually derived raw materials to supply our commercialization stuff. Then we need to create the commercialization stuff with the same kind of excitement we get about the science. And it really has the same challenges, if you will. There's tremendous scale-up properties that are problems that nano people face when they're taking things off the bench top, if you will, into commercial productivity. So what can we do? I have some suggestions. Certainly, we need to really encourage universities and industry to partner more. Maybe we can increase the amount of the small--the STTR portion of the Small Business Innovative Research Program that requires universities and industry to partner before they can do Federal research. That would be an incentive for folks to start learning how to work together. We could consider stipends, if you will, for really profound research that would go toward the commercialization and any kind of gap found of a really promising technology being developed in the research lab. We can also begin to think about an open call for the SBIR program, so we can do funding in real time, if you will, to companies that really have great discoveries they need to commercialize. We have a matching grants program in Florida, High Tech Corridor, that provides additional money for when universities and industry do research together, and with the industry providing research, so we know it's something that's important to them--but additional money to help the faculty, incentivize them to work with things. I would consider creating proof of concept centers, where faculty and industry can come work together, share equipment, share space, share stuff with investors--really to figure out how we're going to get the commercialization out in the marketplace. They also need help with the manufacturing, and the scale-up issues we talked about earlier need to be addressed and, hopefully, some help to do that. I'd offer that we provide help with compliance, too, for these entrepreneurs. Make it user friendly, you know. These-- it's very daunting for faculty to start companies when they have to figure out all this compliance stuff and in real time. And it's a mine field, so, again, maybe a tour guide to help them get through that stuff would be great. Industry can share space in each place. It can--when you think about ways to enhance university tech transfer, funding for university tech transfer offices and commercialization is sparse, usually taken out of the F&A recovery--cost recovery from the university--so ways to help them get the commercialization out of the technology, in supplements, maybe, again, from really exciting research to do the commercialization part, or they can go directly to a te"
