        "text": "In 2023, the Russian electricity retailing sector faced a significant downturn, with market value decreasing by 16.7% to $25.7 billion. This contraction reflects broader economic challenges, but with a projected growth rate of 12.5%, the sector is expected to surge to $28.9 billion by 2028. The market’s resilience is underscored by a modest increase in electricity consumption, which grew by 1.1% in 2023, reaching a volume of 1,018.7 TWh.\n\nThe industrial sector, which consumes 36.5% of the market’s total volume, remains the largest segment, evidencing the critical role of energy in powering Russia’s manufacturing and industrial activities. Despite global economic fluctuations, Russia accounts for a significant 4% of the European electricity retailing market value, highlighting its substantial contribution to the region’s energy landscape.\n\nMarket Dynamics and Strategic Shifts\n\nRosatom announced on March 4, 2024, the commissioning of the second stage of the Trunovskaya Wind Power Plant in Stavropolsky Krai, adding 35 MW to Russia’s renewable energy capacity. This achievement brings Rosatom’s total installed wind power capacity to over 1 GW, emphasizing its commitment to technological sovereignty and sustainable development. The Trunovskaya wind farm, now with a total capacity of 95 MW from 38 wind turbines, underscores Stavropolsky Krai’s growing role in green energy and Rosatom’s leadership in Russia’s wind power development.\n\nOn March 1, 2024, the capacity of the Ezminskaya Hydroelectric Power Station in North Ossetia was significantly increased by 15 MW, reaching a total of 60 MW. This enhancement was achieved through the replacement of all three hydraulic units at the station with modern, more efficient equipment, as part of RusHydro’s Comprehensive Modernization Program (CMP). The modernization process included the installation of new hydraulic turbines, generators, pre-turbine disk valves, control systems, and auxiliary equipment.\n\nOver the past five years, the Russian electricity retailing market has recorded moderate growth but experienced a significant slowdown in 2020. However, the market recovered with strong growth in 2021, and this growth is expected to accelerate further in 2022 and beyond.\n\nThe market had total revenues of $28.1 billion in 2021, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.8% between 2016 and 2021.\n\nThe slowdown in growth in 2020 was mainly due to the recessionary impacts of COVID-19, including lockdown measures and social distancing regulations that reduced business activity. On the supply side, the fall in Russia’s gas and oil production was the largest of any single country in 2020, according to BP. Additionally, exports fell by 11% due to lower worldwide demand.\n\nOn October 8, 2020, Rosatom completed the establishment of the Nuclear Industry Integrator Company for business development in the field of energy storage.\n\nRENERA is founded by Cathode Materials LLC, a subsidiary of the TVEL Fuel Company of Rosatom.\n\nThe company will develop and distribute modular lithium-ion traction batteries for electric vehicles, as well as energy storage systems for emergency power supply, renewable energy, and balancing demand.\n\nThe current portfolio comprises more than 120 ongoing and completed projects for the supply of lithium-ion energy storage. TVEL previously made contract with several companies including Cathode Materials, NPO Centrotech, and the Novosibirsk Chemical Concentrates Plant. Many contracts have been signed to upgrade electric logistics vehicles and to equip substations and uninterruptible power systems with lithium-ion energy storage systems.\n\nFour wind turbine farms in the Stavropol region are to be connected to the grid by the end of 2021, according to plans by the regional Energy Ministry announced on October 5, 2020. These include the Kochubeyevskaya wind farm with an output of 210 MW in the Kochubeyevsky district, the Bondarevskaya wind farm with an output of 120 MW in the Ipatovsky district, the Karmalinovskaya wind farm with an output of 60 MW in the Novoalexandrovsky district, and the Medvezhinskaya wind farm with an output of 60 MW in the Trunovsky district.\n\nNovaWind, a wind energy subsidiary of the state-owned Rosatom Group, will implement the projects.\n\nOne year has passed since the floating power unit Akademik Lomonosov arrived to Pevek.\n\nOn October 7, 2020, the town of Pevek (Chukotka AR) celebrated its one-year anniversary of the floating power unit’s (FPU) arrival to its port. The Akademik Lomonosov FPU operates as a part of the floating nuclear thermal power plant (FNPP, a project of the Rosatom State Atomiс Energy Corporation).\n\nA modernized hydropower plant no. 4 with a modernized hydro generator was put into operation at the Cheboksarskaya power plant, RusHydro reported on October 5, 2020. As part of RusHydro’s comprehensive modernization program (PCM), nine of the station’s 18 generators have already been modernized.\n\nAs part of the upgrade, a new generator stator from the Russian Power Machines Group was installed, which improved performance. The automatic control of the hydraulic unit has also been improved and the hydraulic turbine overhauled. Specialists from RusHydro’s subsidiary, JSC Gidroremont-VKK carried out the installation.\n\nOn September 22, 2020, GE Renewable Energy was awarded the contract to supply its 110 kV Gas Insulated Switchgear (GIS) for the Arctic LNG-2 project, a large liquefied natural gas development on the Gydan Peninsula in Western Siberia, Russia. The delivery of GE’s GIS equipment is planned for 2020-2021.\n\nGE’s F35 gas-insulated switchgear is one of the most compact GIS solutions in its class. Aluminum housing elements ensure low thermal and electromagnetic losses due to induced currents and considerably simplify assembly work. Furthermore, the F35 has an advanced SF6 sealing system.\n\nViktor Kamyshev, GE’s Russia and C.I.S. general manager for Grid Solutions, said, “GE’s Grid Solutions is proud to be part of the important Arctic LNG 2 oil and gas project in Russia. Our compact, gas-insulated switchgear will help ensure a reliable power supply for the project’s production trains.”\n\nThe Ministry of Energy of the Russian Federation proposes modifying the selection procedure for projects under the Renewable Energy Program in the period of years from 2025 to 2035, in the amount of 400 billion rubles, as stated in the Russian government’s draft resolution of October 2, 2020.\n\nThe Ministry considers it necessary to depart from its prior practice of considering projects in terms of unit capital costs to evaluating the minimum price per kilowatt hour (including investment and operating costs). Under the new rules, the first selection round could take place in early 2021.\n\nThe Inter RAO Group presented the company’s development strategy until 2025 with an outlook for 2030, which was endorsed by the PJSC Inter RAO board on July 31, 2020. The adoption of the new strategy marks a new phase of development aimed at ensuring efficient management of energy facilities and maintaining a leading position in the Russian energy sector.\n\nThe Russian energy holding company Inter RAO is reportedly planning to invest 580 million dollars in a gas turbine joint venture with General Electric, which the company announced on October 1, 2020.\n\nReuters reported that the investment comes at a time when Western gas turbine manufacturers are investing in the country as it plans to modernize a quarter of its thermal power plant capacity.\n\nNo Russian company is currently engaged in the production of medium or large capacity gas turbines. The Russian government, however, wants such turbines to be produced locally.\n\nThe move opens up new opportunities for Western turbine manufacturers, as demand for such turbines has recently declined on world markets.\n\nOn September 24, 2020, work to install a circular pipeline for primary cooling water has started at the turbine building of the Kurskaya-2 nuclear power plant (NPP). The pipeline enables water circulation between the turbine condenser and the cooling tower used to cool the steam in the turbine. The Kursk-2 nuclear power plant will have a circular pipeline with the largest diameter of all Russian nuclear power plants: 3,128 mm. It is three times the size of all active Russian nuclear power stations.\n\nPJSC Inter RAO announced financial results for the nine months of 2019 prepared according to the Russian Accounting Standards (RAS). The revenue of PJSC Inter RAO for the first nine months of 2019 amounted to 40.0 billion rubles, up 4.8 billion rubles (13.7 percent) as compared to the first nine months of 2018. Power export revenues totaled 33.6 billion rubles, up 8.9 billion rubles (35.9 percent) in comparison with the corresponding period of the previous year. This change is primarily attributed to an increase in electricity exports and the selling price to Lithuania and Finland.\n\nThe revenue from WECM (wholesale electricity and capacity market) electricity and capacity sales decreased by 4.1 billion rubles (39.9 percent), amounting to 6.2 billion rubles in the first nine months of 2019. This decrease in revenue on the wholesale market for electricity and capacity is related to the absence of commercial electricity imports from Kazakhstan.\n\nRosatom’s first-of-a-kind floating power unit connects to isolated electricity grid in Pevek in Russia’s Far East.\n\nOn December 19, 2019, the floating power unit (FPU) Akademik Lomonosov established a connection with the grid in Pevek, Chukotka, for the first time producing nuclear-generated electricity in that remote area of the Russian Far East. This happened after the Russian regulator Rostekhnadzor issued an operations permit, as well as a permit to connect to the Northern electricity grid maintained by JSC Chukotenergo.\n\nPevek residents marked this symbolic day by turning on the fairy lights on the town’s Christmas tree.\n\nRusHydro announces 9M 2019 IFRS results.\n\nOn December 12, 2019, the RusHydro group announced its condensed consolidated interim unaudited financial information prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) for the third quarter and the initial nine months of 2019.\n\nQ3 & 9M 2019 key highlights\n\nTotal revenue in the first nine months of 2019 was flat to the first nine months of 2018 and came in at RUB287,620 million (minus 0.4 percent). In the third quarter of 2019, total revenue was RUB87,486 (plus 0.1 percent).\n\nThe EBITDA in the first nine months of 2019 was RUB70,429 million (minus 13.1 percent year-on-year); in the third quarter of 2019, it reached RUB19,659 million (minus 6.7 percent year-on-year).\n\nThe revenue of PJSC Inter RAO for 2018 amounted to 53.9 billion rubles, up 12.9 billion rubles (31.5 percent), as compared to 2017. Power export revenues amounted to 38.5 billion rubles, up 11.1 billion rubles (40.8 percent), as compared to 2017. This change is primarily attributed to an increase in the ruble equivalent of the sales price related to the price increase on the Nord Pool power market in Lithuania and Finland, the growth of the euro exchange rate, and exports increases in these directions.\n\nFrom January 15 to 16, 2019, a delegation comprised of the representatives of TENEX and its subsidiary TENAM Corporation participated in the Nuclear Fuel Supply Forum in Washington. The event was organized by the Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI).\n\nAt the seminar, particular emphasis was placed on the U.S.-based uranium mining companies’ endeavors to secure the protection from foreign imports of uranium into the country, as well as the prospects of future development. Negotiations with business partners dedicated to the issues of medium-term and long-term partnership took place.\n\nNEI is a U.S.-based association of nuclear industry organizations founded in 1994. NEI’s members include major players of the U.S. nuclear market, as well as most of the international companies participating in the global nuclear fuel cycle products market. TENEX is a member of NEI since 2008.\n\nOn February 28, 2019, PJSC RusHydro announced its non-consolidated financial results under Russian Accounting Standards (RAS) for the full year ended December 31, 2018.\n\nIn 2018, revenue increased by six percent or RUB7,079 million (mln), as electricity production by PJSC RusHydro’s HPPs increased on the back of higher inflows to reservoirs of the Volga-Kama cascade in the first half of the year and to reservoirs in Siberia in the second half of the year.\n\nThe leading equipment manufacturers and suppliers of power generation equipment intend to take part at Heat & Power expo from October 22 to 24, 2019. Participants will include such companies as AB Group, Aprovis, Bertuzzi Implanti, Gmgen Power Systems, MTU Onsite Energy, Liebherr, Man, Mas Energy, MT Group, MWM, Riello Ups, RS Motor, Vorotinsky Power Generation Plant, and more.\n\nThe power industry becomes more important with production growth, mechanization, and automation, as envisioned by the development plan for the national economy. One of the most critical parts of the enterprises’ power facilities are industrial power generators, a large number of which are directly connected with district power stations and power systems. Industrial power generators used in various industries are alternative sources of heat and electric energy.\n\nFortum-Rusnano investment fund has taken the investment decision for a 100-megawatt (MW) wind power project in Russia. It is the third project of the total 1,823 MW awarded to the fund in the Russian wind auction in 2017 and 2018.\n\nThe wind farm is expected to start production during the first half of 2020. The previous 50-MW and 200-MW projects are expected to start production during the first half of 2019 and the first half of 2020 respectively. The Fortum-Rusnano wind investment fund is a 50/50 owned investment partnership to invest in wind power in Russia. The investment decisions related to the renewable capacities won by Fortum and the Fortum-Rusnano wind investment fund in 2017 and 2018 will be made on a case-by-case basis. Fortum’s maximum equity commitment is RUB15 billion. In the longer term, Fortum seeks to maintain an asset-light structure by forming potential partnerships and other forms of cooperation.\n\nSpanish company Windar Renovables has brought the manufacturing of wind turbine towers to Russia, where a plant run by WRS Towers, a partnership which includes the Russian groups Rusnano MC and Severstal PSJC and is led by the Spanish company, will soon begin operations.\n\nIt is the first production center for this type of equipment to be established in the country, where an ambitious land farm installation program is to begin immediately. The factory, which is located in Taganrog in Rostov, was opened by the governor of the region Vasily Golubey, who was accompanied by the Deputy Minister for Industry, Vasily Osmakov. Both were received by the president of Rusnano MC Anatoly Chubais, the managing director of Severstal Alexander Shevelev, and the executive president of Windar Renovables Orlando Alonso.\n\nOn April 6, 2018, Russia’s biggest company in electricity transmission and distribution Rosseti announced its IFRS consolidated financial results for the Rosseti group of companies for 2017.\n\nThe group’s consolidated revenues in 2017 came to RUB948.3 billion, a figure reflecting a 5.3-percent increase on 2016. The net profit rose almost 40 percent to RUB137.1 billion year-on-year. The group’s profitability reached 14.5 percent, a 3.6-percentage-point increase over 2016.\n\nOn May 24, 2018, Rosseti and ABB agreed to cooperate in implementing projects in Russia to create digital networks of a new generation, taking into account advanced digital technologies for automating power grid management processes.\n\nThe agreement was signed by Rosseti’s director general Pavel Livinskiy and the president of ABB Irina Kozlova at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum. As part of the agreement, ABB will develop the concept of a 110-kV digital substation and design a technological model of the digital network. In collaboration with Rosseti, ABB will prepare a proposal for the implementation of pilot projects to run a digital substation and a digital power distribution zone based on ABB technologies.\n\nThe agreement will ensure a high level of digitalization, reliability, and efficiency of power grid facilities.\n\nOn April 19, 2018, Dmitry Medvedev held a meeting on creating a digital network in Russia by the year 2030. Launched in pursuance of the Russian President Vladimir Putin’s initiative to have the country’s power industry transition to digital operations, the network is expected to function with the use of domestically-produced equipment and technologies. In order to implement this initiative, the government envisions establishing joint ventures between the Rostec state corporation and Rosseti with the goal of developing a smart power grid complex. Dmitry Medvedev instructed the relevant ministries and departments, as well as the appropriate stakeholders, to work out the details regarding the size of Rostec’s investment in Rosseti for implementing this project.\n\nThe German company believes that a Rostec subsidiary had no right to install turbogenerators on the Crimean Peninsula.\n\nOn July 11, 2017, the German concern Siemens Aktiengesellschaft has filed in the Moscow Arbitration Court a claim against Technopromexport (TPE), the engineering subsidiary of Rostec, relative to installing a gas turbine in the Crimea.\n\nSiemens’ press representative Wolfram Trost stated that the claim is directed against those who bear responsibility for the unauthorized shipment of the turbines.\n\nOne day earlier, on July 10, Siemens threatened Technopromexport with a criminal prosecution for the delivery of the turbines to the Crimea. Siemens stated that it obtained information that two of the four turbines that Siemens made for a Taman Peninsula power plant ended up in Crimea, against the commitments made to the German company."
