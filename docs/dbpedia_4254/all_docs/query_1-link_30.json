        "text": "The European Aerospace and Defense Co. (EADS) and Russian Nanotechnology Corp., RUSNANO, said yesterday they plan to cooperate in the research and development of new technologies.\n\nAs a first step, the partners will identify relevant patents in EADS’s portfolio that could be suited to develop new business in the Russian industry.\n\n“As a global leader in aerospace and defense, EADS has technologies that can help our partners maintain their competitive edge,” EADS Chief Technology Officer (CTO) Jean Botti said. “Today’s agreement establishes the ground for cooperation in different areas through the use and transfer of Intellectual Property and technology. We are pleased to partner with RUSNANO, a corporation at the forefront of innovation in Russia.”\n\nRUSNANO CEO Anatoly Chubais said, “The advanced technologies of EADS complement well with the RUSNANO’s strong position on Russian high-tech market. Our cooperation paves the way for the progress in nanotech-related fields including energy efficiency, new materials, life science and security.”\n\nThe two men signed the agreement yesterday in Moscow.\n\nThe technology licensing procedures in place at EADS reduce the time required for implementation, minimize risk of patent infringement and ensure that all controls and processes are applied. To facilitate the application and use of licensed technologies, the company offers training, engineering support and assistance in the establishment of processes and procedures.\n\nEADS sees Russia as a major cooperation partner in the technology area, a statement said. In 2003, the company established a Technology Office to facilitate collaboration with the Russian research and development community. Since its opening, the RTO has already managed more than 100 cooperative research and technology programs between EADS and Russian institutions. EADS is also participating in the Skolkovo Innovation Centre.\n\nRUSNANO was founded in March 2011 as an open joint stock company through reorganization of state corporation Russian Corporation of Nanotechnologies. RUSNANO’s mission is to develop the Russian nanotechnology industry through co-investment in nanotechnology projects with substantial economic potential or social benefit. The Government of the Russian Federation owns 100 percent of the shares in RUSNANO."
