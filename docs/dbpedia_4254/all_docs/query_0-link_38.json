        "text": "A July 24, 2024 news item on phys.org highlights research into regenerating bone and skin, Note: A link has been removed,\n\nResearchers are exploring new nature-based solutions to stimulate skin and bone repair.\n\nIn the cities of Trento and Rovereto in northern Italy and Bangkok in Thailand, scientists are busy rearing silkworms in nurseries. They’re hoping that the caterpillars’ silk can regenerate human tissue. For such a delicate medical procedure, only thoroughbreds will do.\n\n“By changing the silkworm, you can change the chemistry,” said Professor Antonella Motta, a researcher in bioengineering at the University of Trento in Italy. That could, in turn, affect clinical outcomes. “This means the quality control should be very strict.”\n\nSilk has been used in surgical sutures for hundreds of years and is now emerging as a promising nature-based option for triggering human tissue to self-regenerate. Researchers are also studying crab, shrimp and mussel shells and squid skin and bone for methods of restoring skin, bone and cartilage. This is particularly relevant as populations age.\n\n…\n\nA July 23, 2024 article by Gareth Willmer for Horizon Magazine, the EU (European Union) research & innovation magazine, which originated the news item, provides more details,\n\n‘Tissue engineering is a new strategy to solve problems caused by pathologies or trauma to the organs, as an alternative to transplants or artificial device implantations,’ said Motta, noting that these interventions can often fail or expire. ‘The idea is to use the natural ability of our bodies to rebuild the tissue.’\n\nThe research forms part of the five-year EU-funded SHIFT [Shaping Innovative Designs for Sustainable Tissue Engineering Products] project that Motta coordinates, which includes universities in Europe, as well as partners in Asia and Australia. Running until 2026, the research team aim to scale up methods for regenerating skin, bone and cartilage using bio-based polymers and to get them ready for clinical trials. The goal is to make them capable of repairing larger wounds and tissue damage.\n\nThe research builds on work carried out under the earlier REMIX [Regenerative Medicine Innovation Crossing – Research and Innovation Staff Exchange in Regenerative Medicine] project, also funded by the EU, which made important advances in understanding the different ways in which these biomaterials could be used.\n\nBuilding a scaffold\n\nSilk, for instance, can be used to form a “scaffold” in damaged tissue that then activates cells to form new tissue and blood vessels. The process could be used to treat conditions such as diabetic ulcers and lower back pain caused by spinal disc degeneration. The SHIFT team have been exploring minimally invasive procedures for treatment, such as hydrogels that can be applied directly to the skin, or injected into bone or cartilage.\n\nThe approaches using both silkworms and some of the marine organisms have great potential, said Motta.\n\n‘We have three or four systems with different materials that are really promising,’ she said. By the end of SHIFT, the goal is to have two or three prototypes that can be developed together with start-up and spin-off companies created in collaboration with the project.\n\nOne of the principles of the SHIFT team has been been exploring how best to harness the concept of a circular economy. For example, they are looking into how waste products from the textile and food industries can be reused in these treatments.\n\nYet with complicated interactions at a microscale, and the need to prevent the body from rejecting foreign materials, such tissue engineering is a big challenge.\n\n‘The complexity is high because the nature of biology is not easy,’ said Motta. ‘We cannot change the language of the cells, but instead have to learn to speak the same language as them.’\n\nBut she firmly believes the nature-based rather than synthetic approach is the way to go and thinks treatments harnessing SHIFT’s methods could become available in the early 2030s.\n\n‘I believe in this approach,’ said Motta. ‘Bone designed by nature is the best bone we can have.’\n\nSkin care\n\nAnother EU-funded project known as SkinTERM [Skin Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine: From skin repair to regeneration], which runs for almost five years until mid-2025, is also looking at novel ways to get tissue to self-regenerate, focusing on skin. To treat burns and other surface wounds today, a thin layer of skin is sometimes grafted from another part of the body. This can cause the appearance of disfiguring scars and the patient’s mobility may be impacted when the tissue contracts as it heals. Current skin-grafting methods can also be painful.\n\nThe SkinTERM team are therefore investigating how inducing the healing process in the networks of cells surrounding a wound might enable skin to repair itself.\n\n‘We could do much better if we move towards regeneration,’ said Dr Willeke Daamen, who coordinates SkinTERM as a researcher in soft tissue regeneration at Radboud University in Nijmegen, the Netherlands. ‘The ultimate goal would be to get the same situation before and after being wounded.’\n\nResearchers are studying a particular mammal – the spiny mouse – which has a remarkable ability to heal without scarring. It is able to self-repair damage to other tissues like the heart and spinal cord too. This is also true of early foetal skin.\n\nThe team are examining these systems to learn more about how they work and the processes occurring in the area around cells, known as the extracellular matrix. They hope to identify factors that might have a role in the regenerative process, and test how it might be induced in humans.\n\nKick-start\n\n‘We’ve been trying to learn from those systems on how to kick-start such processes,’ said Daamen. ‘We’ve made progress in what kinds of compounds seem at least in part to be responsible for a regenerative response.’\n\nMany lines of research are being carried out among a new generation of multidisciplinary scientists being trained in this area, and a lot has already been achieved, said Daamen.\n\nThey have managed to create scaffolds using different components related to skin regeneration, such as the proteins collagen and elastin. They have also collected a vast amount of data on genes and proteins with potential roles in regeneration. Their role will be further tested by using them on scar-prone cells cultured on collagen scaffolds.\n\n‘The mechanisms are complex,’ said Dr Bouke Boekema, a senior researcher at the Association of Dutch Burn Centres in Beverwijk, the Netherlands, and vice-coordinator of SkinTERM.\n\n‘If you find a mechanism, the idea is that maybe you can tune it so that you can stimulate it. But there’s not necessarily one magic bullet.’\n\nBy the end of the project next year, Boekema hopes the research could result in some medical biomaterial options to test for clinical use. ‘It would be nice if several prototypes were available for testing to see if they improve outcomes in patients.’\n\nResearch in this article was funded by the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions (MSCA). The views of the interviewees don’t necessarily reflect those of the European Commission. If you liked this article, please consider sharing it on social media.\n\nInteresting. Over these last few months, I’ve been stumbling across more than my usual number of regenerative medicine stories.\n\nI live in a coastal region and a few months ago our local municipal voted down an initiative that included some mitigation for beach erosion. So, this research caught my eye.\n\nAn August 22, 2024 news item on phys.org announces an unexpected approach to dealing with coastal erosion,\n\nNew research from Northwestern University has systematically proven that a mild zap of electricity can strengthen a marine coastline for generations—greatly reducing the threat of erosion in the face of climate change and rising sea levels.\n\n…\n\nAn August 22, 2024 Northwestern University news release (received via email and also found on EurekAlert) by Amanda Morris, which originated the news item, delves further into the topic, Note: Links have been removed,\n\nIn the new study, researchers took inspiration from clams, mussels and other shell-dwelling sea life, which use dissolved minerals in seawater to build their shells.\n\nSimilarly, the researchers leveraged the same naturally occurring, dissolved minerals to form a natural cement between sea-soaked grains of sand. But, instead of using metabolic energy like mollusks do, the researchers used electrical energy to spur the chemical reaction.\n\nIn laboratory experiments, a mild electrical current instantaneously changed the structure of marine sand, transforming it into a rock-like, immoveable solid. The researchers are hopeful this strategy could offer a lasting, inexpensive and sustainable solution for strengthening global coastlines.\n\nThe study will be published on Thursday (Aug. 22 [2024]) in the journal Communications Earth and the Environment, a journal published by Nature Portfolio.\n\n“Over 40% of the world’s population lives in coastal areas,” said Northwestern’s Alessandro Rotta Loria, who led the study. “Because of climate change and sea-level rise, erosion is an enormous threat to these communities. Through the disintegration of infrastructure and loss of land, erosion causes billions of dollars in damage per year worldwide. Current approaches to mitigate erosion involve building protection structures or injecting external binders into the subsurface.\n\n“My aim was to develop an approach capable of changing the status quo in coastal protection — one that didn’t require the construction of protection structures and could cement marine substrates without using actual cement. By applying a mild electric stimulation to marine soils, we systematically and mechanistically proved that it is possible to cement them by turning naturally dissolved minerals in seawater into solid mineral binders — a natural cement.”\n\nRotta Loria is the Louis Berger Assistant Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Northwestern’s McCormick School of Engineering. Andony Landivar Macias, a former Ph.D. candidate in Rotta Loria’s laboratory, is the paper’s first author. Steven Jacobsen, a mineralogist and professor of Earth and planetary sciences in Northwestern’s Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences, also co-authored the study.\n\nSea walls, too, erode\n\nFrom intensifying rainstorms to rising sea levels, climate change has created conditions that are gradually eroding coastlines. According to a 2020 study by the European commission’s Joint Research Centre, nearly 26% of the Earth’s beaches will be washed away by the end of this century.\n\nTo mitigate this issue, communities have implemented two main approaches: building protection structures and barriers, such as sea walls, or injecting cement into the ground to strengthen marine substrates, widely consisting of sand. But multiple problems accompany these strategies. Not only are these conventional methods extremely expensive, they also do not last.\n\n“Sea walls, too, suffer from erosion,” Rotta Loria said. “So, over time, the sand beneath these walls erodes, and the walls can eventually collapse. Oftentimes, protection structures are made of big stones, which cost millions of dollars per mile. However, the sand beneath them can essentially liquify because of a number of environmental stressors, and these big rocks are swallowed by the ground beneath them.\n\n“Injecting cement and other binders into the ground has a number of irreversible environmental drawbacks. It also typically requires high pressures and significant interconnected amounts of energy.”\n\nTurning ions into glue\n\nTo bypass these issues, Rotta Loria and his team developed a simpler technique, inspired by coral and mollusks. Seawater naturally contains a myriad of ions and dissolved minerals. When a mild electrical current (2 to 3 volts) is applied to the water, it triggers chemical reactions. This converts some of these constituents into solid calcium carbonate — the same mineral mollusks use to build their shells. Likewise, with a slightly higher voltage (4 volts), these constituents can be predominantly converted into magnesium hydroxide and hydromagnesite, a ubiquitous mineral found in various stones.\n\nWhen these minerals coalesce in the presence of sand, they act like a glue, binding the sand particles together. In the laboratory, the process also worked with all types of sands — from common silica and calcareous sands to iron sands, which are often found near volcanoes.\n\n“After being treated, the sand looks like a rock,” Rotta Loria said. “It is still and solid, instead of granular and incohesive. The minerals themselves are much stronger than concrete, so the resulting sand could become as strong and solid as a sea wall.”\n\nWhile the minerals form instantaneously after the current is applied, longer electric stimulations garner more substantial results. “We have noticed remarkable outcomes from just a few days of stimulations,” Rotta Loria said. “Then, the treated sand should stay in place, without needing further interventions.”\n\nEcofriendly and reversible\n\nRotta Loria predicts the treated sand should keep its durability, protecting coastlines and property for decades.\n\nRotta Loria also says there is no need to worry negative effects on sea life. The voltages used in the process are too mild to feel. Other researchers have used similar processes to strengthen undersea structures or even restore coral reefs. In those scenarios, no sea critters were harmed.\n\nAnd, if communities decide they no longer want the solidified sand, Rotta Loria has a solution for that, too, as the process is completely reversible. When the battery’s anode and cathode electrodes are switched, the electricity dissolves the minerals — effectively undoing the process.\n\n“The minerals form because we are locally raising the pH of the seawater around cathodic interfaces,” Rotta Loria said. “If you switch the anode with the cathode, then localized reductions in pH are involved, which dissolve the previously precipitated minerals.”\n\nCompetitive cost, countless applications\n\nThe process offers an inexpensive alternative to conventional methods. After crunching the numbers, Rotta Loria’s team estimates that his process costs just $3 to $6 per cubic meter of electrically cemented ground. More established, comparable methods, which use binders to adhere and strengthen sand, cost up to $70 for the same unit volume.\n\nResearch in Rotta Loria’s lab shows this approach also can heal cracked structures made of reinforced concrete. Much of the existing shoreside infrastructure is made of reinforced concrete, which disintegrates due to complex effects caused by sea-level rise, erosion and extreme weather. And if these structures crack, the new approach bypasses the need to fully rebuild the infrastructure. Instead, one pulse of electricity can heal potentially destructive cracks.\n\n“The applications of this approach are countless,” Rotta Loria said. “We can use it to strengthen the seabed beneath sea walls or stabilize sand dunes and retain unstable soil slopes. We could also use it to strengthen protection structures, marine foundations and so many other things. There are many ways to apply this to protect coastal areas.”\n\nNext, Rotta Loria’s team plans to test the technique outside of the laboratory and on the beach.\n\nThe study, “Electrodeposition of calcareous cement from seawater in marine silica sands,” was supported by the Army Research Office (grant number W911NF2210291) and Northwestern’s Center for Engineering Sustainability and Resilience.\n\nHere’s a link to and a citation for the paper,\n\nElectrodeposition of calcareous cement from seawater in marine silica sands by Andony Landivar Macias, Steven D. Jacobsen & Alessandro F. Rotta Loria. Communications Earth & Environment volume 5, Article number: 442 (2024) DOI: https://doi.org/10.1038/s43247-024-01604-3 Published: 22 August 2024\n\nThis paper is open access.\n\nA June 26, 2024 news item on ScienceDaily describes the research, which resulted in the graphic you see in the above,\n\nNew analyses from the Annenberg Public Policy Center find that public perceptions of scientists’ credibility — measured as their competence, trustworthiness, and the extent to which they are perceived to share an individual’s values — remain high, but their perceived competence and trustworthiness eroded somewhat between 2023 and 2024. The research also found that public perceptions of scientists working in artificial intelligence (AI) differ from those of scientists as a whole.\n\n…\n\nA June 26, 2024 Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania news release (also on EurekAlert and also received by email), which originated the news item, describes a series of surveys, how the information was gathered, and offers more detail about he results, Note 1: All links removed; Note 2: You can find links and citations for papers mentioned in the news release at the end of this posting.\n\n…\n\nFrom 2018-2022, the Annenberg Public Policy Center (APPC) of the University of Pennsylvania relied on national cross-sectional surveys to monitor perceptions of science and scientists. In 2023-24, APPC moved to a nationally representative empaneled sample to make it possible to observe changes in individual perceptions.\n\nThe February 2024 findings, released today to coincide with the address by National Academy of Sciences President Marcia McNutt on “The State of the Science,” come from an analysis of responses from an empaneled national probability sample of U.S. adults surveyed in February 2023 (n=1,638 respondents), November 2023 (n=1,538), and February 2024 (n=1,555).\n\nDrawing on the 2022 cross-sectional data, in an article titled “Factors Assessing Science’s Self-Presentation model and their effect on conservatives’ and liberals’ support for funding science,” published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (September 2023), Annenberg-affiliated researchers Yotam Ophir (State University of New York at Buffalo and an APPC distinguished research fellow), Dror Walter (Georgia State University and an APPC distinguished research fellow), and Patrick E. Jamieson and Kathleen Hall Jamieson of the Annenberg Public Policy Center isolated factors that underlie perceptions of scientists (Factors Assessing Science’s Self-Presentation, or FASS). These factors predict public support for increased funding of science and support for federal funding of basic research.\n\nThe five factors in FASS are whether science and scientists are perceived to be credible and prudent, and whether they are perceived to overcome bias, correct error (self-correcting), and whether their work benefits people like the respondent and the country as a whole (beneficial). In a 2024 publication titled “The Politicization of Climate Science: Media Consumption, Perceptions of Science and Scientists, and Support for Policy” (May 26, 2024) in the Journal of Health Communication, the same team showed that these five factors mediate the relationship between exposure to media sources such as Fox News and outcomes such as belief in anthropogenic climate change, perception of the threat it poses, and support for climate-friendly policies such as a carbon tax.\n\nSpeaking about the FASS model, Jamieson, director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center and director of the survey, said that “because our 13 core questions reliably reduce to five factors with significant predictive power, the ASK survey’s core questions make it possible to isolate both stability and changes in public perception of science and scientists across time.” (See the appendix for the list of questions.)\n\nThe new research finds that while scientists are held in high regard, two of the three dimensions that make up credibility – perceptions of competence and trustworthiness – showed a small but statistically significant drop from 2023 to 2024, as did both measures of beneficial. The 2024 survey data also indicate that the public considers AI scientists less credible than scientists in general, with notably fewer people saying that AI scientists are competent and trustworthy and “share my values” than scientists generally.\n\n“Although confidence in science remains high overall, the survey reveals concerns about AI science,” Jamieson said. “The finding is unsurprising. Generative AI is an emerging area of science filled with both great promise and great potential peril.”\n\nThe data are based on Annenberg Science Knowledge (ASK) waves of the Annenberg Science and Public Health (ASAPH) surveys conducted in 2023 and 2024. The findings labeled 2023 are based on a February 2023 survey, and the findings labeled 2024 are based on combined ASAPH survey half-samples surveyed in November 2023 and February 2024.\n\nFor further details, download the toplines and a series of figures that accompany this summary.\n\nPerceptions of scientists overall\n\nIn the FASS model, perceptions of scientists’ credibility are assessed through perceptions of whether scientists are competent, trustworthy, and “share my values.” The first two of those values slipped in the most recent survey. In 2024, 70% of those surveyed strongly or somewhat agree that scientists are competent (down from 77% in 2023) and 59% strongly or somewhat agree that scientists are trustworthy (down from 67% in 2023). (See figure 1 [see the first item in this post], and figs. 2-4 for other findings.)\n\nThe survey also found that in 2024, fewer people felt that scientists’ findings benefit “the country as a whole” and “benefit people like me.” In 2024, 66% strongly or somewhat agreed that findings benefit the country as a whole (down from 75% in 2023). Belief that scientists’ findings “benefit people like me,” also declined, to 60% from 68%. Taken together those two questions make up the beneficial factor of FASS. (See fig. 5.)\n\nThe findings follow sustained attacks on climate and Covid-19-related science and, more recently, public concerns about the rapid development and deployment of artificial intelligence.\n\nComparing perceptions of scientists in general with climate and AI scientists\n\nCredibility: When asked about three factors underlying scientists’ credibility, AI scientists have lower credibility in all three values. (See fig. 6.)\n\nCompetent: 70% strongly/somewhat agree that scientists are competent, but only 62% for climate scientists and 49% for AI scientists.\n\nTrustworthy: 59% agree scientists are trustworthy, 54% agree for climate scientists, 28% for AI scientists.\n\nShare my values: A higher number (38%) agree that climate scientists share my values than for scientists in general (36%) and AI scientists (15%). More people disagree with this for AI scientists (35%) than for the others.\n\nPrudence: Asked whether they agree or disagree that science by various groups of scientists “creates unintended consequences and replaces older problems with new ones,” over half of those surveyed (59%) agree that AI scientists create unintended consequences and just 9% disagree. (See fig. 7.)\n\nOvercoming bias: Just 42% of those surveyed agree that scientists “are able to overcome human and political biases,” but only 21% feel that way about AI scientists. In fact, 41% disagree that AI scientists are able to overcome human political biases. In another area, just 23% agree that AI scientists provide unbiased conclusions in their area of inquiry and 38% disagree. (See fig. 8.)\n\nSelf-correction: Self-correction, or “organized skepticism expressed in expectations sustaining a culture of critique,” as the FASS paper puts it, is considered by some as a “hallmark of science.” AI scientists are seen as less likely than scientists or climate scientists to take action to prevent fraud; take responsibility for mistakes; or to have mistakes that are caught by peer review. (See fig. 9.)\n\nBenefits: Asked about the benefits from scientists’ findings, 60% agree that scientists’ “findings benefit people like me,” though just 44% agree for climate scientists and 35% for AI scientists. Asked about whether findings benefit the country as a whole, 66% agree for scientists, 50% for climate scientists and 41% for AI scientists. (See fig. 10.)\n\nYour best interest: The survey also asked respondents how much trust they have in scientists to act in the best interest of people like you. (This specific trust measure is not a part of the FASS battery.) Respondents have less trust in AI scientists than in others: 41% have a great deal/a lot of trust in medical scientists; 39% in climate scientists; 36% in scientists; and 12% in AI scientists. (See fig. 11.)\n\nThe data from ASK surveys have been used to date in four peer-reviewed papers:\n\nUsing 2019 ASK data: Jamieson, K. H., McNutt, M., Kiermer, V., & Sever, R. (2019).

These waves of the Annenberg Science and Public Health (ASAPH) knowledge survey were fielded February 22-28, 2023, November 14-20, 2023, and February 6-12, 2024, and have margins of sampling error (MOE) of ± 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4 percentage points at the 95% confidence level. In November 2023, half of the sample was asked about “scientists” and the other half “climate scientists.” In February 2024, those initially asked about “scientists” were asked about “scientists studying AI” and the other half “scientists.” This provided two half samples addressing specific areas of study, while all panelists were asked about “scientists” generally.

Briefly, the Canadian government (led by the newly elected Justin Trudeau and his Liberals) implemented a new pay system for the entire federal civil service in 2016. A disaster from Day 1, the system is still not properly functional as of this writing.\n\nDaniel LeBlanc’s May 16, 2024 article for the Canadian Broadcasting (CBC) news online site gives a bit more detail about the debacle and a proposed remedy,\n\nThe federal government is accelerating plans to put the Phoenix public service pay system out of its misery.\n\nLaunched in 2016, the system — which cost taxpayers nearly $4 billion — has failed regularly [emphasis mine] to deliver public servants’ paycheques on time, or in the right amounts.\n\nAccording to the government’s latest tally, more than 300,000 of 425,000 Phoenix transactions had failed to meet service standards as of last month — including 213,000 that were more than a year late.\n\nAlex Benay, the federal official responsible for the file [Associate Deputy Minister of Public Services and Procurement (Enterprise Pay Coordination)], said $135 million set aside in this year’s budget will give a big boost to the development of Dayforce, the system which is expected to replace Phoenix in the coming years.\n\n…\n\nOttawa didn’t make any specific announcement related to Phoenix when the new spending was made public. It’s still a major increase in funding for the Dayforce project, which was launched in 2018 with an average annual budget of $25 million.\n\nDayforce is a payroll and human resources management system already in use by 6,000 organizations, including the governments of Ontario and California.\n\nThe federal government plans to make Dayforce its new pay system in the coming years, after conducting a series of tests that concluded in February [2024?]. Ottawa pays $36 billion a year in salaries to 420,000 people.\n\nBenay struck a cautious note, pointing out that there’s still a lot of work to do before the transition to the new system. But Ottawa has abandoned all hopes of trying to salvage Phoenix for the long term.\n\n…\n\nA major problem with Phoenix is that it needs to operate in tandem with more than 30 distinct human resources management systems in various departments and agencies, as well as more than 100 collective bargaining agreements.\n\nA large number of payroll officers are needed to perform different calculations for each department. And when civil servants change departments, Phoenix struggles to overcome a series of technological challenges.\n\nThe federal government’s hope is that Dayforce will allow it to rely on a single tool for both payroll and managing employees’ personnel files at all stages, from hiring to retirement.\n\n“We have no intention of disintegrating [the payroll and human resource management systems] a second time and making the same mistake,” Benay said. [Comment: A mistake that should never have been made in the first place. Even the contractor {IBM} warned that Phoenix wasn’t ready when it was implemented.]\n\n…\n\nAccording to Public Services and Procurement Canada, Phoenix initially cost taxpayers $300 million and the federal government has spent another $3.5 billion on it since.\n\n…\n\nAs it prepares to transition to a new payroll system, the government says it will use artificial intelligence tools [emphasis mine] to clean up the data in the Phoenix system and reduce the number of late payments.\n\nThe plan is to introduce Dayforce gradually in several federal departments [that’s what should have happened with Phoenix], so that when Phoenix is finally ​​scrapped, the new system can take off as smoothly as possible.\n\nThe Public Service Alliance of Canada said certain compensation rules could be standardized across government to ease the transition to a new pay system. However, it insisted that unions should help design and test the new system.\n\n“If the members don’t suffer, we’re ready to co-operate in setting up a payroll system that works,” said spokesperson Yvon Barrière. “But we need to be certain that the system will work, and that it will not disadvantage our members under collective bargaining agreements.”\n\n…\n\nIt would have been nice to get more information about the artificial intelligence tools they propose using, especially in light of the many problems associated with those tools. (See my December 29, 2020 posting, “Governments need to tell us when and how they’re using AI (artificial intelligence) algorithms to make decisions.” Also, Associate Deputy Minister of Public Services and Procurement (Enterprise Pay Coordination), Alex Benay is mentioned in the post as he was leaving his job as Canada’s Chief Information Officer, a position created after the Phoenix Pay System debacle.)\n\nSo who is Alex Benay?\n\nSince Benay was first mentioned here in a June 19, 2014 posting, “Canada Science and Technology Museums Corporation welcomes Alex Benay as president and chief executive officer (CEO),” I was quite curious as to what he’s been doing since returning to the federal government civil service,\n\nFirst, there’s the May 11, 2023 Government of Canada news release announcing Mr. Benay’s latest appointment to the civil service,\n\nThe Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, today announced the following changes in the senior ranks of the Public Service:\n\n…\n\nAlex Benay, currently Vice-Chair of the National Arts Centre and Senior Partner, Levio Business and Technology, becomes Associate Deputy Minister of Public Services and Procurement (Enterprise Pay Coordination), effective June 26, 2023.\n\nBiographical Notes\n\n…\n\nAlex Benay\n\n…\n\nIf you click on Alex Benay, you’ll find this,\n\nEducation\n\nBachelor of Arts, History, University of Ottawa\n\nProfessional Experience\n\nSince April 2023\n\nSenior Partner, Levio Business and Technology [emphasis mine]\n\nSince May 2022\n\nVice-Chair of the National Arts Centre\n\n2020 – 2022\n\nGlobal Lead, Government Azure Strategy, Microsoft\n\n2019 – 2020\n\nPartner, KPMG Canada\n\n2017 – 2019\n\nChief Information Officer, Government of Canada\n\n2014 – 2017\n\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer, Ingenium Corporation\n\n2011 – 2014\n\nVice-President, Open Text Corporation\n\n2010 – 2011\n\nSenior Director, Industry Marketing, Open Text Corporation\n\n2009 – 2010\n\nSenior Director, Customer Enablement, Open Text Corporation\n\n2004 – 2009\n\nDirector, Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada\n\nOne comment: it seems odd to leave off your master’s degree in your official government of Canada biographical notes. This contrasts somewhat with the Alex Benay profile on Boardroominsiders.com,\n\nAlex Benay\n\nAssociate Deputy Minister, Enterprise Pay Coordination, Public Services and Procurement Canada\n\nGovernment of Canada\n\n…\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nAlex Benay is an Associate Deputy Minister of Enterprise Pay Coordination for Public Services and Procurement Canada at the Government of Canada, a role to which he was named in June 2023. Most recently, he served as Head of Program Management at Microsoft Corporation. [emphasis mine] Prior to that, Benay was a Partner of Digital and Government Solutions at KPMG Canada and Chief Client Officer at MindBridge Analytics Inc. Before joining MindBridge, Benay was Chief Information Officer of Canada and Deputy Minister at the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat. He also served as President and Chief Executive Officer at Canada Science and Technology Museum Corporation. Earlier in his career, he held leadership and marketing roles at Open Text Corporation. He holds a BA in History from the University of Ottawa and a Master’s Degree in History from Athabasca University.

This partnership started in April 2023 (govt. profile), a scant two months before his move (?) to his current government position. Consequently, it makes sense that the Boardroom profile lists Benay’s most recent role as “Head of Program Management at Microsoft Corporation.” As noted earlier, there’s the addition of a master’s degree to the Boardroom profile. Let’s see what’s next in an Alex Benay profile on FWD50.com,\n\nAlex Benay (he/him)\n\nAssociate Deputy Minister, Enterprise Pay Coordination\n\nAlex Benay became Associate Deputy Minister of Enterprise Pay Coordination in June 2023.\n\nPrior to this appointment, Alex was [emphasis mine] a senior partner with Levio Business and Technology and Vice Chair of the National Arts Centre. From 2020 to 2022, he served as the Global Lead of Government Azure Strategy at Microsoft where he helped governments around the world adopt cloud technologies.\n\nFrom 2019 to 2020, Alex was a partner with KPMG where he led the digital transformation of governments and Fortune 500 companies in the areas of technology, people and strategy.\n\nAlex was a Deputy Minister at the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat from 2017 to 2019 where he served as Chief Information Officer. In this role, he oversaw key information technology initiatives in service modernization, legacy system management, good governance, and open and transparent government.\n\nAlex was also the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Canada Science and Technology Museums Corporation (Ingenium) where he oversaw the transformation of the country’s national museums. In addition, he is a former Global Affairs Canada executive.\n\nAlex is the author of 2 books: Canadian Failures and Government Digital. He holds a bachelor of arts in history from the University of Ottawa.\n\nNothing jumps out other than the past tense used to describe Benay’s partnership at Levio.\n\nThoughts\n\nThe omission of a master’s degree from Benay’s list of educational accomplishments seems odd but inconsequential. The mention of his two month long (?) partnership at Levio is a little more than odd especially with the confusion over his status as a partner (is or was?). Here’s why it seems concerning to me, Levio Business and Technology, from tho company’s homepage,\n\nLevio is a digital native business and technology consulting firm.\n\nAs a true partner from start to finish, our goal is a long-lasting transformation that’s right for your business model. We provide a tailored approach, streamlined execution and a commitment to deliver digital transformation ventures that create value and measurable achievements.\n\n…\n\nIt seems as if Mr Benay’s firm (past or present?) could be a good fit as a contractor for Dayforce as would one or more of his previous employers.\n\nThat said, it would be impossible to find anyone with the experience necessary to properly oversee the transition from Phoenix who does not have many connections within the industry. It’s a very incestuous business.\n\nI trust Mr. Benay is aware of and taken steps to deal with a federal government that has a notably poor record with implementing technology and dealing with contractors.\n\nThe Canadian federal government and a problem with contractors\n\nHere’s an example of the Canadian federal government’s problem with contractors, from a February 12, 2024 article by Darren Major for CBC news online,\n\nThe final cost of the controversial ArriveCan app is impossible to determine due to poor financial record-keeping, a new auditor general report has found.\n\nIt is just one of the findings that Canada’s Auditor General Karen Hogan highlighted in a damning report about the pandemic-era tool.\n\nOverall, Hogan found that the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA), the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) and Public Services and Procurement Canada “repeatedly failed to follow good management practices in the contracting, development and implementation of the ArriveCan application.” [emphasis mine]\n\n“This is probably the first example that I’ve seen such a glaring disregard for some of the most basic and fundamental policies and rules,” Hogan told the House public accounts committee on Monday [February 12, 2024].\n\n…\n\n“I have to say I am deeply concerned by what this audit didn’t find,” she told MPs on the committee.\n\n“We didn’t find records to accurately show how much was spent on what, who did the work, or how and why contracting decisions were made — and that paper trail should have existed.”\n\nCBSA said previously the development and operation of the app cost an estimated $54 million.\n\nHogan estimates the project cost was $59.5 million — but, as the report notes, she was only able to arrive at that figure based on the information available to her.\n\n…\n\nCBSA depended heavily on third-party contractors [emphasis mine] to develop the app. The report cites that reliance as a major factor in its ballooning costs.\n\nHogan’s report suggests that a reduction in the use of outside contractors could have lowered costs and “enhanced value for money.”\n\n…\n\nNDP Leader Jagmeet Singh blamed the rise in government outsourcing on both Liberal and Conservative governments.\n\n“This is the result of years of Conservatives and Liberals creating a system that allows wealthy consultants to procure government contracts and make millions in profits at the expense of our professional public service and Canadian taxpayers,” he said in a media statement.\n\n…\n\nThere is also little documentation to show why or how the biggest contractor — GC Strategies — was chosen for the project. [emphasis mine]\n\nThe company is a two-person consulting firm that advertises itself as being able to help companies navigate the government’s procurement process.\n\nGC Strategies was given a sole-source contract in April 2020 despite a lack of evidence that the firm provided a proposal document for the project, [emphasis mine] the report says.\n\nHogan notes that at least one other firm provided an initial proposal for the same contract.\n\nThe report indicates that the auditor general couldn’t determine which government official made the final decision to select GC Strategies for the April 2020 contract.\n\nAnd Hogan also found that GC Strategies was later involved in developing requirements that were later used for a competitive contract. That contract — valued at $25 million — was awarded to GC Strategies, the report says.\n\n…\n\nWhat you might call a boondoggle from beginning to end.\n\nJuly 2024 update\n\nA July 10, 2024 article by Emma Weller for CBC news online notes this,\n\nA payroll system for federal workers intended to replace the much-maligned Phoenix platform is still years away from being fully implemented, according to a senior government official.\n\n…\n\nAt a new conference on Tuesday [July 9, 2024], Alex Benay, associate deputy minister of Public Services and Procurement, said testing began on Phoenix’s replacement, Dayforce, in 2022.\n\n“This is the year that we are building Dayforce as a replacement system for HR and pay and determining if it is a feasible solution for the Government of Canada,” Benay said.\n\nBenay said the switch won’t happen overnight, however, and cautioned it may take years until the new system is fully implemented. In the meantime, Phoenix will remain in use.\n\n“In order to do this well and steadily, there will be a world where we continue to see an IBM Phoenix contract and a Dayforce contract for the foreseeable future in order to make sure that we don’t replicate the mistakes that we did in 2017,” he said.\n\n…\n\nWhen launched in 2016, Phoenix initially cost taxpayers about $300 million. The cost has now ballooned to $3.5 billion.\n\nThe federal government expects to spend an additional $936 million over the 2024-2025 fiscal year. Benay said half of that will be allocated to Phoenix while the other half will go toward the transformation to a new system.\n\nMuch of the Phoenix costs are directed at managing and reducing a serious backlog of transactions waiting to be processed.\n\nAccording to the Public Service Pay Centre dashboard, 416,000 transactions were waiting to be processed on June 19 [2024].\n\nBenay said the goal is to process them all by March 2025. To achieve that goal, he said 200 compensation advisers have been specifically tasked with helping resolve those outstanding cases, and they’ll have artificial intelligence (AI) tools at their disposal for support. [emphasis mine]\n\n…\n\nWeller’s July 10, 2024 article doesn’t offer any details about the AI tools but she does include comments, which indicate that I’m not the only AI skeptic,\n\nMixed reaction from unions\n\nEva Henshaw, acting president of the Professional Institute of the Public Service of Canada (PIPSC) said knowing a new system is in the works gives her members some hope.\n\n“This might be the concrete commitment that we were looking for, but we will have to see,” Henshaw said.\n\nShe added that she wants to see greater consultation, and for the unions and their members to be part of the solution.\n\nHenshaw said she remains skeptical of integrating AI into the operations and would like to see a risk plan. [emphasis mine]\n\n“AI in itself may be very helpful and be a lot faster, but we have to make sure that AI doesn’t create other problems for our members,” she noted.\n\nSharon DeSousa, national president of Public Service Alliance of Canada, agreed and added that the country’s largest employer has failed in its most basic task.\n\n“We live in a world where the principle is simple — you go to work and you get paid,” DeSousa said.\n\n…\n\nHopes and dreams\n\nI’m really hoping that the government has addressed the issues revealed by the Auditor General and that all contracts including those associated with Dayforce will be carefully vetted, that financial records will be properly kept, and that there will be conscientious oversight.\n\nMost of all, I hope Canadian federal employees will finally get some stability with regard to their paycheques. It’s past due.\n\nA June 3, 2024 news item on phys.org announces research into making platinum catalysts reusable, Note: Links have been removed,\n\nChemists at the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Brookhaven National Laboratory, Stony Brook University (SBU), and their collaborators have uncovered new details of the reversible assembly and disassembly of a platinum catalyst. The new understanding may offer clues to the catalyst’s stability and recyclability.\n\nThe work, described in a paper just published in the journal Nanoscale, reveals how single platinum atoms on a cerium oxide support aggregate under reaction conditions to form active catalytic nanoparticles—and then, surprisingly, fragment once the reaction is stopped.\n\nFragmentation may sound shattering, but the scientists say it could be a plus.\n\n…\n\nA June 3, 2023 Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) news release (also on EurekAlert), which originated the news item, provides more detail, Note: Links have been removed,\n\n“Such reversible fragmentation of a platinum nanocatalyst on cerium oxide could be potentially useful for controlling the catalyst’s long-term stability,” said Anatoly Frenkel, a chemist at Brookhaven Lab and professor at SBU who led the research.\n\nWhen the platinum atoms return to their starting positions, they can be used again to remake active catalytic particles. Plus, the post-reaction fragmentation makes those active particles much less likely to fuse together irreversibly, which is a common mechanism that ultimately deactivates many nanoparticle catalysts.\n\n“Part of the definition of a catalyst is that it helps disassemble and reassemble reacting molecules to form new products,” Frenkel noted. “But it was shocking to see a catalyst that also assembles and disassembles itself in the process.”\n\nAssembly/disassembly\n\nThe paper describes how the scientists observed the nanoparticles forming as single platinum atoms aggregated on the cerium oxide surface at 572 degrees Fahrenheit (300 degrees Celsius) — the temperature of the reaction they were studying.\n\n“After the reaction, we expected that these nanoparticles would stabilize once back at room temperature in whatever particle size they reached when they were activated,” Frenkel said. “But what we observed was a reverse process. The particles began fragmenting into single atoms again.”\n\nThe team had a hypothesis to explain what they were seeing, which was confirmed by thermodynamic calculations performed by theory colleagues at Chungnam National University in Korea. Carbon monoxide, one of the products of the reaction — often considered a “poison” for catalysts — was actively tearing the nanoparticles apart.\n\n“Carbon monoxide molecules have a very strong repulsive interaction when they are next to each other,” Frenkel explained. During the “reverse water gas shift” reaction, which converts carbon dioxide (CO2) and hydrogen (H2) into carbon monoxide (CO) and water (H2O) at high temperatures, the CO typically leaves the catalyst surface as a gas. But once the heat is turned off, the CO molecules bind strongly to the platinum atoms of the catalyst. This brings the CO molecules closer to each other as the system cools down and their numbers rise.\n\nThat is a perfect storm,” said Frenkel.\n\n“When the CO molecules find themselves very close together on the surface of the nanoparticles, they repel. And, when they repel, because they are strongly bound to the platinum atoms, they sort of pull the least-tightly bound platinum atoms from the perimeter of the nanoparticle and drag them onto cerium oxide support,” Frenkel said.\n\nMultimodal imaging\n\nThe scientists used a combination of atomic-level spectroscopic and imaging techniques to make these observations.\n\nOne technique used bright X-rays at the Quick x-ray Absorption and Scattering beamline of the National Synchrotron Light Source-II (NSLS-II) to produce a spectrum of the energy absorbed by the atoms that make up the catalyst. The scientists used this technique to study the catalyst at different temperatures and stages of the reaction. These X-ray absorption spectra are strongly influenced by the electronic states of the atoms and can be used to decipher which atoms are nearby.\n\n“This technique can tell us that the platinum atoms have oxygen neighbors from the cerium oxide particles of the catalyst support, carbon monoxide neighbors from the reaction products, or other metal neighbors — more platinum atoms,” Frenkel said. But it “lumps together information from many platinum atoms and only gives average information,” he noted.\n\n“It can’t tell us whether all platinum atoms have the same environment or whether we have different groups of atoms — some dispersed on the support and some within the nanoparticles. We needed additional tools to unravel the possibilities,” he said.\n\nInfrared spectroscopy, performed in Frenkel’s Structure and Dynamics of Applied Nanomaterials (SDAN) laboratory in the Brookhaven Lab Chemistry Division, revealed the presence of two distinct groups —single atoms with no metal neighbors and nanoparticles made only of platinum. The scientists used the technique to track the relative abundance of each group as the reaction progressed.\n\n“This technique tells us how molecules such as CO interact with our platinum atoms. Do they show features of single atoms only or nanoparticles only or both?” Frenkel said. “During the cooling down after the reaction, we observed that CO was interacting with single atoms again.”\n\nElectron microscopy, performed by Lihua Zhang of Brookhaven’s Center for Functional Nanomaterials (CFN), produced nanoscale images of both species — single atoms and nanoparticles. These images show that, at room temperature before the catalyst is activated, there are no nanoparticles, and after the reaction, “we saw both nanoparticles and single atoms,” Frenkel said.\n\n“These techniques together tell us that, once the reaction stops and the temperature drops, the nanoparticles have started to fragment into single atoms,” Frenkel said. “Each measurement independently would not have given us enough data to understand what we are dealing with. We couldn’t have done this work without our collaborators at NSLS-II and CFN and without the capabilities at these DOE Office of Science user facilities.”\n\nChange and disorder\n\nUnderstanding these differences at stages of the reaction is critical to understanding how the catalyst works, Frenkel said.\n\n“In our experiment, we deliberately went from one extreme to the other. We went from only single atoms to only nanoparticles. In the process, we had them coexist at different fractions so we could systematically investigate how the catalytic activity changes, how the structure changes,” he said.\n\nFrenkel noted that the nanoparticles don’t assemble perfectly. They have more defects — irregular atomic sites — compared to nanoparticles synthesized by commonly used methods. These defects could turn out to be another feature that improves catalytic performance. That’s because disorder, or strain, can contribute to the alignment of the electronic levels of chemical reactants and metal atoms in the catalyst so they can interact more easily, he explained.\n\n“People try to design catalysts with these types of imperfections deliberately; our method incorporates strain naturally,” he said.\n\nIn addition, due to these relatively disordered structures, nanoparticles assembled from single atoms might not be as tightly bound as a perfect array of atoms would be. That could make it easier for them to disassemble for reuse when the reaction turns off.\n\nThis work was funded by the DOE Office of Science and by the National Research Foundation of Korea. In addition to making use of capabilities at NSLS-II and CFN, the scientists used computing resources at the Scientific Data and Computing Center, a component of the Computational Science Initiative at Brookhaven Lab.\n\nBrookhaven National Laboratory is supported by the Office of Science of the U.S. Department of Energy.
