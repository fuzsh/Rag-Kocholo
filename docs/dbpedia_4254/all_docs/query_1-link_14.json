        "text": "There are 138 enterprises in Russia engaged in nanotechnology production, said Deputy Prime Minister Sergei Ivanov during the third international nanotechnology forum Rusnanotech 2010. Sergei Ivanov stressed that nanotechnology is a major industry and that it can be used in virtually every sector: in aircraft engineering, the space industry, construction, etc.\n\nThe deputy prime minister noted that prototypes of batteries for electric cars are now made in Russia with the use of nanotechnologies. The deputy prime minister drove through the exhibition in one such car, Hyundai Porter, with RusNano head Anatoly Chubais. One charge of the carâ€™s battery, which was made at the Liotech company, established by RusNano and Thunder Sky Limited (China), can last for 350-400 km.\n\nThe deputy prime minister said that financing of RusNano management companies would reach 300 billion roubles a year by 2015."
