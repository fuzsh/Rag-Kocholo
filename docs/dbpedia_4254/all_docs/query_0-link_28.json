        "text": "In recent years, nanotechnology has risen on the Russian policy agenda and it has often been mentioned as a key factor in the process of modernisation and innovation. Undoubtedly, nanotechnology is promising for science, industry and society, but to what extent will Russia be able to benefit from a national effort in this field? The main purpose of this study is to provide an assessment of Russian achievements in the field of nanotechnology research and development up to 2010 and its plans for the coming decade. The report provides an overview of the expanding field of nanotechnology in general and in Russia in particular. First government initiatives are described. Second an assessment of Russian nanotechnology capability is made, by comparing Russian investment, research publications and patenting activity with a sample of other countries. Third, Russia’s potential for innovation and commercialisation of nanotechnology is assessed and the prospects of intelligence service support ...\n\nIn 2007, nanotechnology became the buzzword in Moscow whenever innovation policy was on the agenda. Undoubtedly, nanotechnology has considerable promise for the future, but will it be a panacea for furthering Russia’s interests? Will nanotechnology salvage Russian science and industry and become an engine for innovation driving the economy? Will it give Russia an edge in defence research and in the decades to come improve Russian security policy standing? The main purpose of this report is to provide an assessment of Russian nanotechnology up to 2010 and of Russia’s plans for the coming decade. There are three central research questions in this study. a) How extensive, in absolute and relative terms, is the Russian nanotechnology effort regarding investment, research, innovation and commercialisation? b) What are Russia’s strengths and weaknesses in the field of nanotechnology? What obstacles are there and what are the opportunities for boosting nanotechnology development in Russia? c) How feasible are its current plans? The report provides an overview of the expanding field of nanotechnology in general and in Russia in particular. First government initiatives are described. Second an assessment of Russian nanotechnology capability is made, by comparing Russian investment, research publications and patenting activity with a sample of other countries. Third, Russia’s potential for innovation and commercialisation of nanotechnology is assessed and the prospects of intelligence service support to the Russian nanotechnology effort are discussed. Finally, the feasibility of the Russian nanotechnology effort is assessed on the basis of its identified strengths and weaknesses, followed by tentative conclusions on the future impact of Russian nanotechnology on security policy\n\nThis working paper presents findings from analyses of Russian nanotechnology outputs in publications and patents focusing on developments over the period 1990 through to 2012. The investigation draws on bibliometric datasets of scientific journal publications and patents and on available secondary English-language and Russian sources. The document provides both an overview and detailed analyses of nanotechnology research and innovation in Russia. The examination of publications highlights sectoral trends, leading authors and organizations, and acknowledgements to funding sources. The analysis of patents adds further evidence about patterns of invention and ownership of intellectual property emanating from research and development in Russian nanotechnology. The analyses in this paper have been undertaken to provide an information base for further research on the current state and trajectory of nanotechnology in Russia and on the broader development of Russia’s innovation system. Comparisons with Chinese publication and patent outputs can be seen in a parallel report on Nanotechnology Research and Innovation in China (2014).

The younger the technology in question, the more difficult it is to find the right indicators for the measurement of its innovative power at a time when such measurement is most needed, in order to evaluate the efficiency of policy making regarding this technology. The measurement of the innovative power of a General Purpose Technology (GPT), like nanotechnology, can benefit from adoption of commonly accepted economic indicators, such as intellectual property creation, creation of enterprises, manufacture of value-added products and supply of relevant services, but new indicators need to be proposed, in order to specifically grasp the disruptive and revolutionary power of the GPT. This study aims to stress-test the use of traditional indicators for the measurement of nanotechnology innovation, in order to specifically allow for comparison with other technological developments and between economic markets, while gaining insight into the shortcomings of these traditional indicators and aiming to identify needs for better suited future indicators to be created\n\nAims: In the conditions of advanced countries industrial markets' competition escalation the issue of creating new economy on the basis of nanotechnologies as Nano-bio-info and cogno(NBIC)-technologies is becoming more and more important. As all developed countries, Ukraine conducts fundamental and applied research in the field of nanotechnologies, and the research priorities to be agreed with solving both global and specific national problems in view of building-up a modern NBIC-civilization. Short Research Article Kyzym et al.; BJEMT, 13(2): 1-24, 2016; Article no.BJEMT.24812 2 The main purpose of the research is to analyze the modern perspectives and to perform benchmarking study of the Global and Ukrainian trends in nanotechnologies development as part of NBIC-technologies' scientific domain to identify priority areas of scientific and technical policy of Ukraine. Study Design: The reviews were carried out in the period 2010–14 on the basis of studying the world countries nanotechnologies development trends as well as on the basis of the research results obtained by Ukrainian academic institutions. Methodology: Content analysis and bibliographic retrieval have been used as the main methods of research, which allowed making a meaningful analysis of classic papers and researches of modern economists-practitioners devoted to the peculiarities of the Global and Ukrainian trends in NBIC-civilization emergence. Models of time series, including also trend analysis, were used for forecasting. Computations were performed in Application Software Package \" Statistica 8 \". Results: The article demonstrates main practical results of various economic sectors development achieved through implementing comprehensive scientific-technical programs to develop nanotechnologies during 2010–2014 in Ukraine. Benchmarking analysis of the researchers' publishing activity in the field of nanotechnology in the leading world countries and in Ukraine has shown that in general, the dynamics of research in Ukraine correspond to the global trends, but is much slower. Development of nanomaterials, nanobiotechnology and nanoelectronics are the main fields of nanoscience research. Nanomedicine & nanobiology are specific features of Ukrainian research field that allows us to consider those areas to have competitive advantages of nanotechnology development in Ukraine. At the same time a very small number of publications in the field of nano-electronics and nano-energy engineering testifies of a substantial lagging behind the main global trends. The low level of patenting in nanotechnology development in Ukraine satates the need, on the one hand, to stimulate applied research, and on the other hand, to improve procedures for obtaining intellectual property rights protection. Conclusion: The priorities of Ukrainian nanotrechnology studies, as part of NBIC-technologies' scientific domain, need to be clarified in accordance with the global problems to be solved by any country and in accordance with the existing potential and possibilities of nanotechnology research as regards the emergence of NBIC-society. In order not to lose the existing potential in the field of nanoelectronics and nano-energy engineering the government should support the local development, especially at the stage of basic research. Institutional support to the interaction of science and business is required at the stage of applied research. Consequently, to revitalize high-tech engineering, the developments in the field of nanoelectronics should become a priority for the government support. Lack of international patents in Ukraine speaks of the need to ensure more active cooperation between Ukrainian, European and international patent organizations, particlualry under the Patent Cooperation Treaty."
