        "text": "Home > Press > RUSNANO Supervisory Council approves the next generation flexible packaging industrial production project\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe project application was submitted by Danaflex CJSC, Kazan, Tartarstan, which will be main contractor and co-investor. Research and development was provided by Kazan State University and Kazan State Technological University. The full title of the project is \"High Barrier Polymer Film Technology Implementation and Production Setup to Expand Flexible Packaging Production\".\n\nRUSNANO Supervisory Council approves the next generation flexible packaging industrial production project\n\nMoscow, Russia | Posted on May 5th, 2009\n\nThe project will be realized within the RUSNANO (49%) and Danaflex (51%) joint venture. RUSNANO's share of the investments totals 1,200 million rubles and comes as a contribution to the portfolio company share. Danaflex will contribute a production facility located in Tartarstan and a total of 1,250 million rubles in cash.\n\nThe company's products, high-barrier polymer film and flexible packaging materials, will be used primarily for packaging food, household goods, beauty and animal food products. High-barrier flexible film allows heating of food in microwave ovens without the need to remove the package. Another advantage is that it may significantly reduce the amount of preservatives used in food, and increase the shelf life of the foodstuff and other products packaged in the film. According to Dionis Gordin, RUSNANO's Managing Director, the process equipment involved in the package production meets the best world practices. This type of high quality barrier film is now vigorously winning the foreign markets, whereas such production is not available in Russia. RUSNANO and Danaflex joint venture output will replace imported packaging in this segment, targeting both Russian and foreign customers, primarily the manufacturers of products that require packaging. According to Airat Bashirov, Danaflex Director General, this joint project will become a new step in developing flexible packaging market in Russia. In 2016 nano-packaging sales are expected to reach 20 thousand ton.\n\nThe Project execution timeframe is 2009-2016.\n\n2009-2011 - Acquire and install the process equipment.\n\n2011 - Commissioning and starting up the production.\n\n2011-2013 - Running commercial production. Payback limit is 2016.\n\nRussian multilayer flexible packaging market in 2008 is estimated to be 184 thousand tons (33.2 billion rubles). Imported products make 10% of the Russian market, and this is mostly hi-tech packaging, not currently produced in Russia. By 2016, experts expect 14% annual growth in flexible multilayer packaging consumption.\n\n***\n\nToday, the packaging can be divided into two types - rigid and flexible. Rigid packaging is well-established but less functional. Flexible packaging is booming due to a wide range of properties and diverse applications.\n\nThe term flexible packaging includes production, delivery, and processing of polymer films, aluminum foil and paper to be used together and separately. Basic products in this segment are thin-layered (mono-films) or combined polymers for obtaining multilayer structures containing cellulose (paper and hard paper) or thin aluminum layers, along with plastic.\n\nThe main advantages of the flexible packaging are its low weight, user-friendliness and greater power-efficiency during manufacturing compared to other packaging materials (metal, glass, etc.). In addition, flexible packaging requires less storage space, and transportation expenses are much lower as compared to traditional types of packaging.\n\nThe barrier properties of the film protecting from moisture, oil, grease, and petroleum products, domestic chemicals, gases, bacteria, and UV light, ensure food quality preservation.\n\nApplication: foodstuff retail packaging; modified atmosphere packaging, food preservation, consumer goods, hygienic products, domestic detergents, special-purpose non-food packaging for healthcare, pharmaceutics, etc.\n\nDanaflex CJSC was founded in 2001 in Kazan. The main line of business is production of flexible packaging materials. The company is the largest flexible packaging manufacturer in the Russian market, it has offices in Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Novosibirsk.\n\nDuring its life, Danaflex has developed and introduced innovation packaging that became segment leaders, and also have won renowned international and Russian awards. At 2008 year end, Danaflex sales totaled 12.5 thousand ton of packaging.\n\n####\n\nAbout Russian Corporation of Nanotechnologies\n\nThe Russian Corporation of Nanotechnologies (RUSNANO) was established in 2007 by the Federal law â„– 139-FZ to enable Government policy in the field of Nanotechnology.\n\nTo accomplish this task, RUSNANO co-invests in nanotechnology industry projects that have high commercial potential or social benefit. Early-stage investment by RUSNANO lowers the risk of its investment partners from the private sector.\n\nRUSNANO participates in building nanotechnology infrastructure, which includes the nanotechnology centers of excellence, business incubators and early stage investment funds. RUSNANO provides scientific and educational programs that are required for its investment projects to succeed, and also supports the popularization of nanoscience and nanotechnology. RUSNANO selects promising spheres for investment based on longer-term foresight created by the leading Russian and world experts.\n\nTo assist the Russian nanotechnology industry advance to the global market and strengthening of its international links RUSNANO develops partnerships with the leading nanotechnology centers in the world and organizes the annual Nanotechnology International Forum in Russia.\n\nFor more information, please click\n\nContacts:\n\nNametkina Street, 12A, Moscow, Russia 117420\n\nPhone: +7 495 542 4444\n\nFax: +7 495 542 4434\n\nCopyright Â© Russian Corporation of Nanotechnologies\n\nIf you have a comment, please us.\n\nIssuers of news releases, not 7th Wave, Inc. or Nanotechnology Now, are solely responsible for the accuracy of the content.\n\nBookmark:\n\nRelated News Press\n\nNews and information\n\nAugust 16th, 2024\n\nAugust 16th, 2024\n\nAugust 16th, 2024\n\nAugust 16th, 2024\n\nVC/Funding/Angel financing/Loans/Leases/Crowdfunding\n\nFebruary 10th, 2023\n\nMay 11th, 2021\n\nMarch 26th, 2021\n\nFebruary 22nd, 2021\n\nAnnouncements\n\nAugust 16th, 2024\n\nAugust 16th, 2024\n\nAugust 16th, 2024\n\nAugust 16th, 2024\n\nFood/Agriculture/Supplements\n\nJanuary 12th, 2024\n\nNovember 17th, 2023\n\nNovember 17th, 2023\n\nMay 12th, 2023\n\nAlliances/Trade associations/Partnerships/Distributorships\n\nApril 14th, 2023\n\nSeptember 23rd, 2022\n\nJune 17th, 2022\n\nJune 10th, 2022"
