        "text": "BOX 5.1\n\nSustainable Nanomanufacturing Signature Initiative\n\nThe overarching goal of the Sustainable Nanomanufacturing signature initiative is to “establish manufacturing technologies for economical and sustainable integration of nanoscale building blocks into complex, large-scale systems.”1 The key requirement of the initiative is the development of manufacturing processes that are\n\n• Scalable.\n\n• Precise, controllable, and sustainable.\n\n• Safe and produce nanotechnology-based products that perform to specifications throughout their life cycle without harm to the environment or human health.\n\nDuring the first year (2011), the initiative was funded at $61million. It is estimated that expenditures will be $73 million in 2012, and $84 million has been proposed for 2013.2\n\nThe initiative has two thrust areas:\n\n1. Design of scalable and sustainable nanomaterials, components, devices, and processes.\n\n2. Nanomanufacturing measurement technologies.\n\nThe initiative is supported by many federal agencies, whose roles include basic research and applied research (e.g., NSF, USDA, and DOE), metrology (e.g., NIST), manufacturing development (e.g., NSF and NIST), EHS (e.g., OSHA and NIOSH), and technology transfer and commercialization support (e.g., EPA and DOD).\n\nMetrics and timelines have been developed for both thrust areas. Initial focus areas are carbon nanomaterials (NIST), optical metamaterials (NSF), and cellulosic nanomaterials (USDA).\n\nFor thrust area 1, success will be realized if within 2 years consortia (academic, industry, and government partners) have been established for the purpose of coordinating research on manufacturing methods; if within 4 years there has been a successful demonstration of processes that are scalable, sustainable, and safe; and if within 8 years materials and processes that are appropriate for production have been identified and technology transfer or adoption by U.S. manufacturers has occurred.\n\nFor thrust area 2, the initial focus area is roll-to-roll manufacturing. This thrust will be deemed successful if within 2 years, a consortium focused on metrology roll-to-roll processing has been formed, if within 4 years a real-time in-line measurement system has been demon-\n\nstrated, and if within 8 years a benchmarking of measurement systems has taken place with industrial partners to allow technology transfer.\n\nTo date, the signature initiative is on track to meet its goals. USDA has developed roadmaps and awarded $6.7 million for public–private collaborative research at seven universities for cellulosic-nanomaterials research and has installed a cellulose-nanomaterial pilot plant in the Forest Service Forest Products Laboratory in Madison, Wisconsin. NIST has held a workshop on carbon-based nanomaterials; there were participants from industry, academe, and government, and measurement barriers were identified. A cooperative research and development agreement is in place with Applied Nanostructured Solutions to understand the effect of growth conditions on the structure of carbon-based nanomaterials. The NSF Nanoscale Science and Engineering Center for Hierarchical Manufacturing is focused on advancing technologies for roll-to-roll processing. The center also supports the community through coordination of the National Nanomanufacturing Network and roadmap development.3\n\nInteragency coordination is active. The NNCO staff person who supports the signature initiatives facilitates extensive and frequent interactions among the participating agencies.\n\nThe initiative participants interact regularly in person, via telephone, or via e-mail to share the scientific details of agency programs to identify opportunities to leverage activities and expand interagency collaboration.\n\nThe signature initiative Sustainable Nanomanufacturing has several participants in common with the Nanomanufacturing, Industry Liaison, and Innovation (NILI) Working Group, and communication between the two groups is strong. The co-chairs of NILI take strong personal interest in the initiative’s goals and objectives. An update on the initiative is provided to the co-chairs of NILI, which has been helpful in identifying potential industry and academic partners. NILI has also provided outreach to the nanomanufacturing stakeholders in the industrial community.\n\nBOX 5.2\n\nNanoelectronics Research Initiative Model of Industry, Government, and University Collaboration\n\nOne industry that already is designing and manufacturing nanotechnology-based products is the semiconductor industry. The trend known as Moore’s law states that the number of transistors (the devices that store and manipulate digital information) on a computer chip about the size of a fingernail will double every 18 to 24 months. Scaling has enabled the steady increase in performance and decrease in cost of integrated circuits (ICs) for everything from smart phones to credit card scanners. Cutting-edge ICs made today using silicon complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology have patterned features with a dimension of just 22 nm and require deposition of layers of materials that are only a few atoms, or about 1 nm, thick.\n\nContinued improvement in performance and cost, which is vital to the competitiveness of the U.S. semiconductor industry and to technological leadership in support of national security, will require a new technology beyond CMOS. In 2005 a group of semiconductor companies formed a consortium—the Nanoelectronics Research Initiative (NRI)—to fund precompetitive university research in partnership with government with the mission to demonstrate the next logic switch. NRI awards research contracts based on competitive solicitation processes and to date has supported research at 57 universities involving more than 250 faculty researchers and 430 students.\n\nNRI provides a model for industry collaboration and for public–private partnership. In addition to industry support, NRI research is funded by NIST, NSF, universities, and state/local governments. The collaborative industry investment would not be possible without the substantial NNI investment in nanoelectronics, e.g., the NSF program Science and Engineering Beyond Moore’s Law. A key driver for other government agencies at all levels is economic development and the desire to see that the nanoelectronics industry takes hold in the United States or in their jurisdiction.\n\nNRI employs a number of metrics with which to gauge success. Of greatest interest to industry members is progress toward the technical goal of demonstrating a superior logic switch. A set of parameters has been developed to compare the respective performance of each technology under investigation. Results of this benchmarking are used to guide research during the course of the project and to identify the most promising new devices. Other measures of NRI output include number of students supported and career positions following graduation; numbers of and citations to publications and patents/patent applications; and spin-off/start-up companies based on NRI research. An NRI metric that is perhaps unique for such an industry consortium is member company satisfaction with the program, based on annual surveys.\n\nNRI is a research initiative, but its outputs eventually may play a role in the economic success of the semiconductor industry and of other industries that utilize semiconductor-powered technologies. One measure is based on sales. The U.S. semiconductor industry accounts for nearly half of the $300 billion world market and is the largest U.S. export over the past 6 years. A study of the economic impact of semiconductors over the past several decades based on data collected by the Department of Commerce concludes that the semiconductor industry grew 25 times faster than the U.S. economy as a whole between 1960 and 2007, and between 2000 and 2007 semiconductors accounted for 15 percent of the growth in sectors as diverse as motor vehicles and communications equipment.1 Such quantitative estimates may not be possible for nanotechnology as a whole without modification of the data that are collected. However, the semiconductor industry can continue to be tracked and used as an example of the economic impact of nanoscale science and engineering.\n\nBOX 5.3\n\nSuggested Definitions of Success and Metrics for EHS and NEHI\n\nIf one reflects on NNI Goal 4, which is “to support the responsible development of nanotechnology,” it is clear that it encompasses the goals that the Nanotechnology Environmental and Health Implications (NEHI) Working Group sets and some aspects of other working groups. Responsible development of nanotechnology is central to advancing a world-class research and development (R&D) program (NNI Goal 1), educating the workforce and engaging the public (NNI Goal 3), and all aspects of nanomanufacturing and product commercialization (NNI Goal 2). Because of the complexity of Goal 4, related definitions of success (outcomes) are particularly challenging to summarize, but they may include the following:1\n\n• NNI develops, updates, and works to implement a coordinated program of environmental, safety, and health (EHS) research that will develop tools and methods for risk characterization and assessment in general—including both hazard and likelihood of exposure—and support expanding understanding of potential risks of broad classes of nanomaterials. Publicly available results of EHS research worldwide are made available broadly to researchers and users of nanomaterials.\n\n• Businesses of all sizes are aware of potential risks of nanomaterials and know where to obtain current information about properties and best practices for handling.\n\n• Regulatory agencies have sufficient information about risks of new nanomaterials to enable sound risk assessment that promotes innovation.\n\n• NNI supports research to assess the societal impacts of nanotechnology in parallel with technology development.\n\n• The general public has access to information about nanotechnology and a growing percentage is familiar with the fundamental precepts.\n\n• NNI includes R&D aimed at applying nanotechnology to solve societal challenges such as affordable access to clean water, safe food, and medical care\n\nPossible metrics for Goal 4 could include the following:1\n\n• EHS collaborations and projects/centers funded.\n\n• Number of NNI EHS research results that are made easily accessible, e.g., through an NNI-managed clearinghouse or in cooperation with international organizations.\n\n• Publicly available guidance documents developed.\n\n• Number of faculty/students supported for research in these areas.\n\n• Number of K-12 students and educators engaged by NNI-related funded researchers, including Department of Energy laboratory outreach and National Science Foundation-funded researchers, and the impacts.\n\n• Data from NNI-related funded research on public awareness and attitude regarding nanotechnology.\n\n• Analysis of online information and news items related to nanotechnology.\n\n• Evidence that NNI agencies are engaged in international forums discussing and developing standards, norms, and strategies for responsible development of nanotech.\n\n• Number of NNI agency representatives to various international forums.\n\n• Compilation of commercialized or commercializable technologies.\n\n• Number of companies offering EHS, nanotoxicity, and/or nanotechnology safety services.\n\n• Evolution of outcomes and impact resulting from sustained funding in EHS and the social dimensions of NNI."
