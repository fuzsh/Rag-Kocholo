Classically, we all sit in a square and type words onto a keyboard that then get turned into a \"computerized program\". It's a good chance to work on your personal projects, learn what your peers are up to (computer-wise), figure out what the best programming language is, and/or say the words \"I don't have anything to work on\" or \"I forgot my laptop\". This event is very informal, and there is no specific project we'll be focusing our efforts on.\r\n\r\nFood and refreshments are served. RSVPing to ssw@rentrakmail.com is appreciated, but not required.\r\n\r\nCome check out Rentrak's new downtown office. Everyone is welcome to join us!",
