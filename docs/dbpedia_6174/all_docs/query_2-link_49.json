Not only do movies that open in more locations gross higher dollars, those movies also earn higher per theater dollars. The studios, in partnership with the theater chains, are making sure that the maximum amount of revenue can be gained at both the gross and per capita level. The two graphs below illustrate this point. Graph 1 shows how gross dollars move as more theaters are included. Graph 2 shows how per capita theater dollars increase as super hero movies play in more theaters.\n\nGraph 1: Opening Weekend Gross Dollars and Locations for Super Hero Franchises:\n\n(Link to graph: http://www.rentrak.com/images/superhero_01.jpg)\n\nGraph 2: Per Theater Revenue- Opening Weekend Super Hero Dollars:\n\n(Link to graph: http://www.rentrak.com/images/superhero_02.jpg)\n\nAction hero movies also do well in the home entertainment market.
