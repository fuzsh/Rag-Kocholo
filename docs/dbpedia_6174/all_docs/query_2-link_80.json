        "text": "Media research firm Rentrak today released its list of the top 10 on-demand and DVD/Blu-ray movie rentals and sales for the week of Aug. 12 to Aug. 18, and Sony Picture's Olympus Has Fallen, the newly released to video action thriller following the exploits of a former white house guard as he tries to save the kidnapped U.S. president, took the top spot on all three lists for the week. The thriller boasts a cast that includes Gerard Butler and Morgan Freeman.\n\nComcast's Universal Studios held three of the 10 spots on Rentrak's list of on-demand sales, more than any other studio, led by the week's second most popular movie-on-demand, Oblivion. Universal's The Place Beyond the Pines and Identity Thief held the seventh and ninth spots, respectively.\n\nRounding out the top five movies consumers ordered on-demand for the week of Aug. 12 to Aug. 18 were Lionsgate in third place with The Big Wedding, followed by its fourth-place title Mud. Paramount's G.I. Joe: Retaliation finished as the fifth most popular on-demand movie, according to Rentrak, and was the third most purchased, and fourth most popular rental DVD/Blu-ray title for the week.\n\nOblivion held on for the No. 3 spot on the DVD/Blu-ray sales chart in its second week of release, but didn't crack the top 10 for DVD/Blu-ray rentals in the week, Rentrak said.\n\nUniversal's Despicable Me, released to video 140 weeks ago, is easily the oldest movie on Rentrak's movie tracking lists. It ranked seventh in last week's list of top 10 DVD/Blu-ray sales, according to Rentrak's data.\n\nlink\n\nThe article \"Olympus Has Fallen\" Is Most Popular Outside of Theaters originally appeared on Fool.com.\n\nFool contributor Tim Brugger has no position in any stocks mentioned.
