        "text": "RESTON, Va., and PORTLAND, Ore., Oct. 8, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- comScore, Inc. (NASDAQ: SCOR) and Rentrak Corporation (NASDAQ: RENT) today announced that clients and the media industry are demonstrating broad support for the announcement of the merger of comScore and Rentrak.\n\nInitially announced on Tuesday, September 29, 2015, comScore, Inc. and Rentrak Corporation have entered into a definitive merger agreement under which the companies will combine in a stock-for-stock merger. The transaction is subject to shareholder approval of both companies, along with customary regulatory closing conditions, and is expected to be completed by early 2016.\n\nBy combining the companies' products, talent and information assets, the new company will have an improved ability to deliver what the media industry have long been asking for â€“ a comprehensive cross-platform measurement system that accounts for all the ways in which content is consumed.\n\nIndustry Support for the comScore and Rentrak Merger\n\nContent Owner Support\n\n\"The combination of these two solid, complementary companies with experienced research leadership is a positive development as the advertising industry confronts the formidable task of building the analytical infrastructure required in the increasingly complex media environment.\"\n\nDavid Poltrack, CRO, CBS Corporation\n\n\"Competition in the measurement space offers the opportunity to foster greater innovation among all the players. The introduction of a new measurement service which would offer a different way to crack the cross-platform code would be enormously beneficial to the entire media industry and can't come too soon.\"\n\nAlan Wurtzel, President of Research and Media Development, NBC Universal\n\n\"Measurement of viewing needs to evolve quickly to match the rapid pace of change in our industry. We look forward to seeing how the combination of comScore and Rentrak is able to solve some of the longstanding challenges of measuring content in an unduplicated fashion across time and media platforms.\"\n\nLisa Heimann, VP of Multiplatform Research, ABC\n\n\"This merger is welcome news, as the industry needs speedier progress and increased innovation in cross platform measurement. Consumers are watching TV on every screen and platform, and we all need measurement to catch up.\"\n\nColleen Fahey Rush, EVP and Chief Research Officer, Viacom\n\n\"This merger represents a huge advancement for TV and cross-platform measurement. Project Blueprint helped make the industry's first syndicated cross-platform measurement service a reality. By augmenting that work with tens of millions of set-top boxes and more granular reporting from Rentrak, this is a meaningful step forward to closing the measurement gap.\"\n\nArtie Bulgrin, SVP of Global Research and Analytics, ESPN\n\n\"The increasingly complex media environment has created an ongoing measurement challenge that demands constant innovation to keep pace with the evolving multiplatform consumer. The combination of Rentrak's set-top box data and comScore's digital expertise offers exciting possibilities for the advancement of cross-platform measurement in our industry.\"\n\nRobin Garfield, SVP of Research and Scheduling, CNN\n\n\"With the continued progression of consumer behavior across multiple screens, distribution services and platforms, it's a priority for Turner to support improved cross-platform measurement tools, with the goal being better ad sales, marketing and programming insights. The Rentrak and comScore merger offers greatly needed competition and is a significant step forward for the measurement capabilities of our industry.\"\n\nHoward Shimmel, CRO, Turner Broadcasting\n\n\"Traditional television ratings don't account for all the viewing that's happening across screens today, meaning that a new approach to cross-platform audience measurement is needed. We welcome developments, such as the merger of comScore and Rentrak that will put pressure on the industry to catch up with real viewing behavior.\"\n\nChris Ryan, VP Sales Research, Scripps Networks\n\n\"As we meet viewers' desires to consume content whenever and wherever they want we need more precise and holistic cross-platform measurement offerings to match. The comScore and Rentrak merger is a giant move forward. Greater competition in the audience measurement field means more innovation and ultimately better solutions for all involved. Bravo!\"\n\nDomenic Venuto, General Manager of AdFX, Weather\n\n\"Person-level cross-screen measurement is the proverbial holy grail and it feels like it might finally be within reach. The sooner we get there, the better it will be for all players in the media ecosystem. We're optimistic that the merger between comScore and Rentrak will accelerate the pace of innovation.\"\n\nJeff Levick, CRO, Spotify\n\nAdvertiser & Agency Support\n\n\"Increasingly fragmented viewership of TV requires a cross-device system built on big data that can deliver precision planning, buying and evaluation of media. This means better accounting for the valuable viewing that happens on long-tail networks, in local markets, and across digital platforms. We applaud the merger of comScore and Rentrak as a major step toward realizing this vision.\"\n\nIrwin Gotlieb, Global Chairman, GroupM\n\n\"A siloed media planning and buying environment not only produces less efficient media spend but also prevents measurement of basic KPIs like unduplicated reach and frequency. This effort to join forces between comScore and Rentrak can help break down these walls and create a more seamless system for planning and evaluation across TV and digital.\"\n\nKeith Camoosa, EVP and Managing Director of Research, IPG Mediabrands\n\n\"We could not be more excited to see comScore and Rentrak come together. The introduction of new cross-platform measurement solutions will create a more innovative and accountable environment that will drive incremental value for clients and agency partners.\"\n\nLori Hiltz, CEO, Havas Media NA\n\n\"Given the emphasis Kellogg Company places on measurement of our media investment, any advancement in cross-platform measurement is a win.\"\n\nChris Osner-Hackett, Senior Director North America Media, Kellogg Company\n\nLeading Industry Organization Support\n\n\"The merger of comScore and Rentrak will help bring needed competition into the field of cross-platform audience measurement. Certainly, this is a field undergoing significant pressure to innovate in response to quickly evolving consumer content consumption habits. It is the proliferation of measurement options available to the industry that will help breed much needed innovation.\"\n\nJane Clarke, CEO, Coalition for Innovative Media Measurement\n\n\"The merger between comScore and Rentrak signals an important step forward to address the measurement mandate: a call for investment in common GRP and ROI metrics across all platforms, from time shifted viewing to mobile. It's very encouraging to see investment in innovation for speed to solution to advance insight for advertisers, who lack the time and resources to stitch together their own data management platforms. The industry has much to gain from these partnerships.\"\n\nGayle Fuguitt, President and CEO, Advertising Research Foundation\n\n\"Amongst the top issues I hear about when speaking to Smart Data Marketers is how media innovation has outpaced available measurement offerings. The merger of comScore and Rentrak represents a huge opportunity to connect the silos, providing the true picture of media consumption across screens.\"\n\nAndreas Cohen, Chairman, I-COM Global\n\n\"Enhanced competition in the audience measurement arena will spur much-needed innovation, which makes the comScore and Rentrak merger welcome news among the entire advertising community. We look forward to seeing what new solutions the combined company can bring to the industry.\"\n\nNancy Hill, President and CEO, American Association of Advertising Agencies\n\nData Platform & Provider Support\n\n\"The market needs combined TV and digital measurement and the merger will benefit the entire media ecosystem. The Oracle Data Cloud has partnerships with both Rentrak and comScore and we look forward to seeing what enhanced solutions they will bring to market.\"\n\nOmar Tawakol, SVP and GM, Oracle Data Cloud\n\n\"With TV and video content viewing crossing screens at such a tremendous pace, it's critical that measurement keeps pace with these changes. comScore and Rentrak have each done an admirable job of innovating in their respective segments of the market, and we applaud all efforts to bring further innovation to the industry as cross-platform measurement continues to escalate in importance.\"\n\nScott Ferber, Chairman and CEO, Videology\n\n\"Siloed measurement systems aren't sufficient for measuring cross-platform campaigns -- the industry needs a scalable and holistic measurement system that can help brands and agencies achieve their advertising objectives. Both comScore and Rentrak have already taken steps toward building a comprehensive cross-platform measurement offering, and we look forward to seeing what the companies can do together.\"\n\nBrett Wilson, CEO, TubeMogul\n\n\"We have entered a new era of media accountability where massive data sets are unlocking more detailed insights about how advertising exposure influences in-store purchase. The comScore-Rentrak merger amplifies the power of census data in person-level television and digital media measurement, and IRI looks forward to continued partnership with these industry leaders in advancing the ability to measure cross-screen sales lift.\"\n\nAndrew Appel, President and CEO, SymphonyIRI Group\n\nAbout comScore\n\nFounded in 1999 and headquartered in Reston, Virginia, comScore, Inc.
