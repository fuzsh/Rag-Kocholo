BrandStar encourages parents and legal guardians to monitor their children’s Internet use. Also, BrandStar strongly encourages parents to help BrandStar enforce its Privacy Policy by instructing their children never to provide personal information on the Website without permission.\n\nIt is possible that due to fraud or deception by others, BrandStar may unknowingly receive information pertaining to children under the age of 13. If BrandStar is notified of this, once BrandStar has verified the information, BrandStar will promptly obtain parental consent or otherwise delete the information from its servers.

If you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. As these forums are public and open for users to interact with each other, BrandStar expects all its users to respect the rights of others. By using these forums, you agree that BrandStar is not responsible for any information that you disclose or communicate in such forums, and any disclosures you make are at your own risk.\n\nIt is possible that due to fraud or deception by others, BrandStar may unknowingly receive information pertaining to children under the age of 13.
