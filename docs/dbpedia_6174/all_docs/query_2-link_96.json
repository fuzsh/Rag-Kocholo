        "text": "Background\n\nActive Home Video was a video distributor based in Los Angeles, California and owned by media research company Rentrak. Active was shut down in the late 90s, and in 2016, Rentrak was bought out by analytics company comScore.\n\n1st Logo (1985-1987)\n\nVisuals: On a black background, a large abstract \"A\" is seen to the left, with a segmented white TV tube shape acting as the crossbar. To the right of it, \"ACTIVE HOME VIDEO\" can be seen. The tube flashes, the logo shine wipes from left to right, and then glows until the end of the logo.\n\nTechnique: Camera-controlled animation.\n\nAudio: A FM synth tune that starts with a long note, followed by a 7-note tune with a held-out last note, and a final rising note when the logo fades to black.\n\nAvailability: Seen on many B-movies on VHS, such as Strike Force, Club Med, Death Curse of Tartu, and Premonition.\n\n2nd Logo (1987-1993)\n\nVisuals: On a black background, a light streaks out multiple blue bars in a triangle formation, the lines near the center thinner than the ends, while the entire thing zooms out and rotates counterclockwise. After the triangle is formed, the triangle fades to a metallic silver color as it shines from top to bottom, and the background gains a blue gradient. Below the triangle, \"ACTIVE HOME VIDEO\" is seen in a chrome font, and then shines from left to right. All of the logo has a drop shadow.\n\nTechnique: Computer animation.\n\nAudio: A THX-like synth riser theme."
