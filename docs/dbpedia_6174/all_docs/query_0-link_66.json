Even though I absolutely don't have anything to hide, it made me uncomfortable. Anyone can see our Facebook page without liking it, so it's not like I can prevent it. I also can't think of a specific bad thing that might arise from this situation, but nothing surprises me in this business. If this happened to you, would it cause any heartburn?\n\nMaybe she's just a big fan of movie theaters and enjoys my super creative Facebook posts. LOL. I asked out booker to check into it, too. I don't mind finding out I'm too paranoid.\n\n| IP: Logged\n\nFrank Cox\n\nFilm God\n\nPosts: 2234\n\nFrom: Melville Saskatchewan Canada\n\nRegistered: Apr 2011\n\nposted 02-24-2013 04:38 PM Um... so what? If you don't want people reading the stuff that you post on the Internet, don't post that stuff on the Internet.\n\nI don't use facebook myself, but I do have a (surprisingly busy) webpage. I've talked to film bookers and company reps who mention in passing that they noticed this or that on my webpage.\n\nOk. Somebody cares enough to check my webpage. Good for them; that's what it's there for.\n\n| IP: Logged\n\nMike Frese\n\nMaster Film Handler\n\nPosts: 465\n\nFrom: Holts Summit, MO\n\nRegistered: Jun 2007\n\nposted 02-24-2013 04:59 PM Rentrak does not have any real audit ability or way to get you into trouble. If do not report you nightly grosses in a timely manner they might be using FB to track you down. If you do report in a timely manner you have nothing to worry about.\n\nYou have plenty of other things to worry about. This is not one of them.\n\n| IP: Logged\n\nSusan Hoffmann\n\nFilm Handler\n\nPosts: 6\n\nFrom: Armour, SD, USA\n\nRegistered: Mar 2012\n\nposted 02-24-2013 11:09 PM Thanks, Mike. That's what I was wondering. I appreciate that you answered without snide remarks.\n\nThis is such a friendly place. I remember why I don't post more.\n\n| IP: Logged\n\nJustin Hamaker\n\nFilm God\n\nPosts: 2253\n\nFrom: Lakeport, CA USA\n\nRegistered: Jan 2004\n\nposted 03-27-2013 03:39 AM The main thing is studios and other segments of the exhibition industry are going to utilize Facebook and other social media to keep track of theatres. I have had questions and comments come back to me from studios - through our booker - about our schedules. It's always been about the distribution of shows when two titles are splitting a screen.\n\nThe studio exhibitor relations people have also liked our FB pages. Presumably so they can track whether we are actually giving away provided materials.\n\n| IP: Logged"
