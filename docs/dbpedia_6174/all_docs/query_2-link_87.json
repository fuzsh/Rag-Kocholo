Installed it on a Windows 7 Professional box. Stand alone workstation not connected to a Domain or anything. Copied a user profile into the Default profile. Created a new test user account to see if it would work. Logged out of the machine. Now NONE of the ID's can login! I'm at the Windows 7 login screen. The icons for the local users are on the screen waiting to be clicked. When I click on any of them, the account name just under the account icon disappears....and that's it......nothing else happens! WOW! This is just a testing workstation so I didn't lose any data or anything, but now I'm stuck and have to reload the O/S.\n\nCommon event? Or this just a fluke?\n\nThanks\n\nDean Waters\n\nRentrak Corporation\n\nSupport\n\nModerator Group\n\nJoined: 09 Nov 2006\n\nLocation: United Kingdom\n\nStatus: Offline\n\nPoints: 1890 Post Options Thanks(0) Quote Reply Posted: 12 Mar 2010 at 3:54am\n\nHi Dean,\n\nI'm sorry that you have had this problem. The problem occurs if you do not assign the user account(s) a password. User Profile Manager needs users to have passwords in order to manage the profiles on the machine. Now what should happen is that you should get a polite message telling you this. Unfortunately there appears to be a bug where you don't see anything. We will work urgently to get this fixed.\n\nYou do not need to reload the O/S. Just reboot the machine in safe mode and either assign a password to the accounts, or uninstall the software.\n\nThank you for bring this to our attention.\n\ndeanwaters\n\nNewbie\n\nJoined: 11 Mar 2010\n\nLocation: Portland, OR\n\nStatus: Offline\n\nPoints: 2 Post Options Thanks(0) Quote Reply Posted: 12 Mar 2010 at 2:59pm"
