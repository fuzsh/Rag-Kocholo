        "text": "SANTA MONICA, Calif. — Twice in the last few months, there was a faint knock on the door of American supremacy in the global film market.\n\nIn early September, a Chinese-language fantasy, “The Monkey King,” climbed to No. 21 at the worldwide box office, with $186.1 million in sales. A few weeks later, a Chinese comedy, “Breakup Buddies,” shot to No. 22, with $143.1 million in ticket sales as of last week.\n\nAs competitive threats go, that isn’t much. But Hollywood can always find something to fret about.\n\nOn Wednesday, when roughly 8,000 foreign and domestic film buyers, sellers and producers converge here at the annual American Film Market, domestic film officials will be worrying mostly about subtle shifts and distant footsteps in an international industry that is still dominated by American studios, talent and tastes.\n\nAccording to Rentrak’s box-office tracking service, United States companies and their partners backed the top 20 performers at the world box office every year for the last five. A rare standout was “Intouchables” in 2012, from France, ranked 16th, with $432.6 million in global sales, just behind Universal Pictures’ British-created “Les Misérables,” with $442 million.\n\nWhile the domestic box office has faltered — after a soft summer it is down 3.8 percent for the year, to about $8.5 billion, according to Rentrak — the United States has scored new triumphs abroad. To date, Rentrak’s data shows, the year’s best performer is Paramount Pictures’ “Transformers: Age of Extinction,” with about $1.1 billion in world sales, much of that in China.\n\nIn all, markets outside the United States accounted for roughly $25 billion of $35.9 billion in worldwide box-office sales last year, according to the Motion Picture Association of America. Precisely what share of international sales was captured by American-based companies is unclear, but they remained dominant.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
