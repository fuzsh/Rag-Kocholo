The terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy shall apply regardless of the means by which the Website was accessed, including but not limited to through the URL, electronic mail or links from other sites. Please read on for details.\n\nThis Privacy Policy covers how BrandStar treats information that BrandStar collects and receives about you via the Website, including information related to your past use of the Website. BrandStar has prepared a detailed policy in order for you to know as much as possible about BrandStar’s practices so that you can make informed decisions. By using the Website and thereby agreeing to this Privacy Policy, you expressly consent to BrandStar’s use and disclosure of automatic and personal information provided to BrandStar when you interact with the Website, as described in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy does not apply to: (i) the practices of companies or other third parties that BrandStar does not own or control, or people that BrandStar does not employ or manage; or (ii) any offline matters, activities or information that BrandStar or any affiliate collects about you or anybody else.\n\nTHE INFORMATION WE GATHER.\n\nThe information learned from the Website’s users, members and customers helps Brandstar personalize and continually improve your experience at the Website. Brandstar receives and stores certain types of information automatically whenever you interact with the Website. Here are the types of information Brandstar gathers and how it is used:\n\nA. Voluntarily Provided Information.\n\nPersonal: Brandstar receives and stores information that personally identifies you. The types of personally identifiable information that may be collected at the Website include: name, address, email address, phone number, fax number, billing address, shipping address, product selections, order number, referring URL, IP address, password, username, how you got to know about the Website, gender, occupation, personal interests, your age and information about your interests in and use of various products, programs and services. You voluntarily provide this personally identifiable information when you enter it on the Website to sign up as a member of Brandstar, whether in connection with a newsletter subscription, when you enter a sweepstakes, promotion or contest and/or other special benefits.\n\nReferred Person: At the Website, you can submit personally identifiable information about other people. For example, you might submit a person’s name and email address to send a website referral or to email a Brandstar news story. The types of personally identifiable information that may be collected and stored about other people at the Website include: recipient’s name, address, email address and telephone number. Brandstar does not share with, rent, transfer or sell personally identifiable information that you submit about other people to any third parties or nonaffiliated entities.\n\nPayment: If you are located in the United States and make a purchase or payment on the Website, Brandstar will collect and store your personally identifiable information. When processing an order or payment on the Website, Brandstar needs to know your name, mailing address, billing address, email address, telephone number, product selection, order number, credit card number and expiration date. This information is necessary to process your order or payment. Although Brandstar transmits your credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing, Brandstar does not rent, transfer, sell or share your credit card issuer, credit card number or expiration date with any nonaffiliated entities.\n\nRegistration: Registered Website members, users who sign up for Brandstar newsletters and users who enter sweepstakes or contests on the Website will receive occasional marketing materials or surveys from Brandstar and/or its trusted marketing partners at the email address provided at sign up. If you would like to opt out from receiving these materials, please email webmaster@brandstar.com.\n\nInteraction with us via our social media profiles\n\nB. Automatically Provided Information.\n\nNon-Personal: Like most website operators, Brandstar collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Brandstar’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Brandstar’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Brandstar may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.\n\nGoogle Analytics: Brandstar also collects potentially personally-identifying information that is collected by Google Analytics. The analytics feature Brandstar has implemented is based on Display Advertising (e.g., Remarketing, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, the Doubleclick Campaign Manager Integration, or Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting). Visitors can opt-out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising and customer Display Network ads using Ads Settings. Brandstar will not facilitate the merging of personally-identifiable information with non-personally identifiable information previously collected from Google Display Advertising features that is based on the DoubleClick cookie unless Brandstar has robust notice of, and the user’s prior affirmative (i.e., opt-in) consent to, that merger. At any time, visitors may choose to opt-out of Google Analytics tracking with the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on. Brandstar uses the Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting feature to identify trends in the usage of its website which may be published in reports for internal use.\n\nIP Address: Your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address is a unique identifier used to connect your computer to the Internet. Your IP address also is stored in Brandstar’s user registration databases when you register with Brandstar. IP addresses may be used for various purposes, including to: (i) help Brandstar identify you and your shopping cart and to gather broad demographic information; (ii) diagnose service or technology problems reported by Brandstar users or engineers that are associated with the IP addresses controlled by a specific Web company or ISP; (iii) estimate the total number of users visiting Brandstar from specific areas; and (iv) help determine which users have access privileges to certain content that Brandstar hosts.\n\nCookies: Brandstar uses a feature of your Internet Web browser called a “cookie,” a small piece of information stored on your hard drive that uniquely identifies your intra- and inter-requests on the Website. Cookies may be used for various purposes, including to keep track of preferences you specify while you are using Brandstar’s services and the Website. We also use cookies to help us compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future.\n\nWe use cookies to:\n\nUnderstand and save user’s preferences for future visits.\n\nKeep track of advertisements.\n\nCompile aggregate data about site traffic and site interactions in order to offer better site experiences and tools in the future. We may also use trusted third-party services that track this information on our behalf.\n\nYou can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser (like Internet Explorer) settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser’s Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies.\n\nIf you disable cookies off, some features will be disabled It won’t affect the user’s experience that make your site experience more efficient and some of our services will not function properly. If you disable cookies, some features and services may not function properly, however it will not affect the overall user experience.\n\nWhat types of cookies do we use?There are a number of different types of cookies, however, our website uses:\n\nFunctionality— BrandStar uses these cookies so that we recognize you on our website and remember your previously selected preferences. These could\n\ninclude what language you prefer and location you are in. A mix of first-party and third-party cookies are used.\n\nAdvertising— BrandStar uses these cookies to collect information about your\n\nvisit to our website, the content you viewed, the links you followed and information about your browser, device, and your IP address. BrandStar sometimes shares some limited aspects of this data with third parties for advertising purposes. We may also share online data collected through cookies with our advertising partners. This means that when you visit another website, you may be shown advertising based on your browsing patterns on our website.\n\nTracking “pixels.” A tracking pixel (also known as a web beacon) is a small image file or link to a JavaScript code file embedded in a website, video, email, or advertisement that sends information about your browsing activity to a server. When you access a website, video, email, or advertisement that contains a tracking pixel, it may allow us or a third-party to drop or read cookies in your browser, and may be used in combination with cookies to track activity by a particular browser on a particular device. Our site uses tracking pixels from third parties (including Google, Microsoft and Facebook) that allow us to track your browsing activity and purchases, display our ads when you are on other websites, and provide you with additional functionality. Some third-party tracking pixels used on our site are also used on a variety of other websites, so they may continue to track you when you leave our site and visit other sites. We have no control over nor are responsible for tracking that happens on other websites.\n\nDevice “Fingerprinting”. Device fingerprinting involves analyzing and combining sets of information from your device’s browser, such as JavaScript objects and installed fonts, in order to create a “fingerprint” of your device and uniquely identify your device. We do not do fingerprinting ourselves, but our partners may.\n\nWeb Beacons: Web pages may contain electronic images (called a “single-pixel GIF” or “Web beacon”) that allow a Website to count users who have visited that page or to access certain cookies. Brandstar uses Web beacons (i) in order to count users and to recognize users by accessing Brandstar cookies, (ii) to count and recognize users who have read emails sent by Brandstar, and (iii) to personalize your experience when you visit the Website.\n\nMobile Device Unique Identifier: Brandstar provides services that allow users to access and customize Internet content through mobile phones, PDAs and other alternative devices. These devices may collect different information than what is collected by computers. When connecting to Brandstar using a mobile device that provides Internet access, if the mobile device service provider uniquely identifies the device, Brandstar will receive this information. Brandstar may use this unique mobile device identification information to offer extended services and/or functionality. Certain Brandstar services may require collection of the phone number for your device. Brandstar may associate that phone number to the mobile device identification information.\n\nPhysical Location: Some mobile phone service providers in the United States are required to operate a system that will pinpoint the physical location of devices that use their service. Depending on the provider and if you are located in the United States, Brandstar may automatically receive this information. Brandstar may use and store this information to provide enhanced location-based services as well as to serve location-targeted advertising.\n\nC. Use of Third Parties to Collect Information.\n\nThird Party: Brandstar may use a third party (such as Nielsen or Rentrak) to collect information on the Website for market research purposes, including through the use of cookies and web beacons. In addition, Brandstar allows other companies that are presenting advertisements on some of Brandstar’s Website pages to set and access cookies on your computer. The use of advertising cookies sent by third-party servers is standard in the Internet industry. Brandstar does not control cookies from third-party advertisers. Other companies’ use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies and not the Privacy Policy of Brandstar.\n\nOnline Advertising, Remarketing, and Third-Party Tracking\n\nWe use Google, Google AdWords, Microsoft’s Bing Ads, LinkedIn, Taboola, StackAdapt and Meta, and may use other advertising platforms, to serve online ads promoting our business and travel products, both in search engines and on other websites. Some of this is done through “remarketing”, which displays advertisements relevant to pages or products you have previously viewed on our website. We do this to offer tailored advertisements that may be of interest to you if you have shown an interest in our products.\n\nTo do this, our site utilizes tracking scripts and may utilize tracking pixels and scripts from other third parties, to collect information about your use of our website over time in order to display remarketing ads relevant to your interests and/or to measure the success of our advertising campaigns. These third-party tracking pixels and scripts may set cookies on your browser and use various tracking technologies, as described above under Information that may be automatically collected.\n\nThe information collected by Google, Microsoft, LinkedIn, Meta, Taboola, StackAdapt, and other third parties through their tracking pixels and scripts is stored and processed by them and is subject to their own policies and practices. We encourage you to familiarize yourself with their privacy policies and terms of use. For information on your rights and choices regarding tracking and online advertising, including how to block or opt-out of such tracking, see What privacy choices are available to you? below.\n\nLookalike Audiences\n\nFor advertising purposes, we occasionally use information about our customers to generate a “lookalike audience” or similar audience of prospective customers through the Meta or Google advertising platforms. This allows us to target advertisements on their networks to potential customers who appear to have shared interests or similar demographics to our existing customers, based on the platforms’ own data. We typically do this by uploading a list of email addresses. Meta’s policy is to irreversibly hash (encrypt) such lists prior to uploading, match the hashed data against their own customers, generate the lookalike audience, then delete the uploaded list and use it for no other purpose. We do not have access to the identity of anybody in the lookalike audience, unless they choose to click on the ads. Based on this, we believe that generating lookalike audiences poses little or no threat to the privacy of our customers. If you wish to opt out of “similar audiences” in Google, you can do so through your Ads Settings; see Online Advertising below for more information.\n\nWebsite Analytics\n\nWe use Google Analytics and may use other third-party analytics tools to help us collect data and measure traffic and usage trends for our website; to understand more about the interests and demographics of our users as a whole; to measure the performance of various marketing campaigns and channels; to understand how people are using our website; and to continually improve our website, booking process, site content, accessibility, and customer experience. In general, this is aggregate data that does not personally identify individual users and simply measures overall trends. To further ensure the privacy of our users, we have enabled an optional feature in Google Analytics to anonymize IP addresses, so that your IP addresses is not stored or processed.\n\nAggregate and Non-Identifying Information\n\nWe may use aggregate data and information that does not personally identify you (including information that has been de-identified) for various purposes, share this information with third parties and affiliates, and store this information indefinitely, without obligation to you except as prohibited by applicable law.\n\nGeographic Information\n\nWe may occasionally use location data automatically collected by Mailchimp or HubSpot to send targeted emails for promotional or legal reasons. We generally do not use this information for any other purpose.\n\nInformation Provided by Others\n\nWhen somebody provides us your personal information as an emergency contact, as a referral to us or somebody who referred you to us, as the recipient of a gift certificate, or as a reference when applying for a job, we shall only use your personal information for that purpose alone.\n\nWhat should you know about our social media profiles?\n\nWe maintain profiles or accounts on Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, Twitter, LinkedIn, TikTok and other social media sites. We encourage you to interact with us on these platforms. However, your use of these platforms, any content you post there, and any information collected by them, is governed by their own terms of use and privacy policies, which we encourage you to review.\n\nSome pages on our site include social media features and widgets, including features to “like” or share specific travel products or pages from our site on Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, Twitter, LinkedIn, TikTok or other social media sites. These features may collect information such as your IP address and which page you are visiting on our site, or set a cookie to identify you or enable the feature to function properly. These features are hosted by third parties, and your interactions with them are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.\n\nWith your permission, we may use comments about our service and products that you have provided on our social media profiles in our advertising or on our website.\n\nINFORMATION SHARING.\n\nBrandstar may disclose information about you to those whose practices are not covered by this Privacy Policy. Due to the existing regulatory environment, Brandstar cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personal information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. By way of example (without limiting the foregoing), third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. If you do not want us to use or disclose personal information collected about you in the ways identified in this Privacy Policy, you should not use the Website or related services.\n\nA. Contests; Sweepstakes; newsletters.\n\nBrandstar may provide personal information provided when you register or when you sign up for a newsletter, sweepstakes or contest to trusted partners who work with Brandstar. These companies may use your personal information to communicate with you about offers or surveys from Brandstar and/or our marketing partners. However, our partners do not have any independent right to share this personal information with third parties. If you would like to opt out from receiving these materials, please email webmaster@brandstar.com.\n\nB. Agents; Contractors.\n\nBrandstar occasionally has third party agents, subsidiaries, affiliates and partners that perform functions on Brandstar’s behalf, such as marketing, analytics, research, credit card processing, shipping or stocking orders, providing customer service, fraud protection, etc. These entities have access only to the personal information needed to perform their functions. They are restricted from using, selling, distributing or altering this data in any way other than to provide the requested services to the Website.\n\nC. Legal Reasons.\n\nBrandstar may disclose and release information in response to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise Brandstar’s legal rights or defend against legal claims. Additionally, Brandstar may share information in order to investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Brandstar’s terms of use or as otherwise allowed by law.\n\nD. Sponsors; Advertisers.\n\nBrandstar may collect personal information about you and share it with third parties to the extent that you give us permission at the time of collection. For example, Brandstar may display targeted advertisements based on personal information provided when you register. Advertisers (including ad serving companies) may assume that people who interact with, view or click on targeted ads meet the targeting criteria (for example, women ages 18-24 from a particular geographic area). By interacting with or viewing an ad you are consenting to the possibility that the advertiser will make the assumption that you meet the targeting criteria used to display the ad. Brandstar also sometimes gathers personal information on behalf of a sponsor in association with a promotion. In such a case, Brandstar will provide you notice at the time of collection that the information is being collected on the sponsor’s behalf and link to the sponsor’s privacy policy.\n\nE. Within the Company.\n\nBrandstar may share your personal information with any of our subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under common control. Additionally, in the event Brandstar goes through a business transition such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your personal information may be among the assets transferred. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur and are permitted by this Privacy Policy.\n\nCalifornia Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)\n\nThe CCPA protects consumers from the collection, use, dissemination, and sale of their personal information without their knowledge.\n\nUsers who are residents of California have the following rights under the CCPA:\n\nRight to Access Your Information\n\nRight to Disclosure of Categories of Information—you have the right to request that we provide the following disclosures covering the 12-month period preceding our receipt of your request.\n\n1. The categories of Personal Information we have collected about you\n\n2. The categories of sources from which Personal Information is collected\n\n3. Our business or commercial purposes for collecting or selling personal\n\ninformation\n\n4. The categories of third parties with whom we share Personal Information\n\n5. The categories of Personal Information we have sold and the categories of\n\nthird parties to whom the Personal Information was sold\n\n6. The categories of Personal Information we have disclosed for a business purpose\n\nRight to Access Specific Pieces of Information—You also have the right to request access to the specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you in the preceding 12 months, which we will deliver to you electronically, in a portable format where feasible.\n\nHow do we protect your information?\n\nWe use industry standard physical, electronic, and organizational safeguards to protect your personal information against loss, theft, unauthorized access, or disclosure. We employ many different security techniques to protect your data.\n\nData Breaches\n\nShould we become aware of any breaches of security (either on our server or with one of the third parties we employ) that may have exposed your personal information, we shall notify you as soon as reasonably possible about the breach and let you know what information might have been exposed. If you are concerned that your privacy may have been breached, please contact us.\n\nWhat privacy choices are available to you?\n\nModifying or Deleting your Information\n\nIf you have any questions about reviewing, modifying, correcting, deleting, or obtaining a copy of information you have provided to us, or if you want to remove your name or comments from our website, social media profiles, or advertising, please contact us. We may not modify or delete your information in all circumstances, unless required by law.\n\nTracking Technology:\n\nCookies & Tracking pixels\n\nMost web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser settings to display a warning before accepting a cookie, to accept cookies only from certain websites, and/or to block or refuse all cookies. You may also clear existing cookies for specific websites, or for all websites. If you use multiple browsers or devices, you will need to adjust the settings in each browser separately. Note that if you choose to block or limit the ability for websites to set all cookies, you may worsen your overall online experience, lose the ability to access some services or features, and/or be unable to save some customized settings, like login information. (For example, you will not be able to make a booking on our website without cookies enabled.)\n\nMany browsers also have a privacy mode (such as Google Chrome’s Incognito mode or Microsoft’s InPrivate mode) that accepts cookies during your browsing session but erases them when you close your browser. For more information or to see if cookies are enabled in your browser, visit this checker.\n\n“Do Not Track” (DNT) is a browser setting that requests that a website or application disable its tracking of an individual user. If you turn on the DNT setting in your browser, your browser sends a special signal to websites, analytics companies, ad networks, and other web services to not track your activity. As our website does not track personal information about your browsing activities over time, our website does not respond to Do Not Track signals; but the third-party tracking pixels used on our site should. To learn more about DNT, to see if you are being tracked, or to change your settings, visit AllAboutDNT.com. Or learn how to enable DNT in Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge.\n\nGoogle Analytics\n\nYou can specifically prevent your data from being collected and used by Google Analytics by downloading and installing the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on.\n\nOnline Advertising\n\nGoogle, Microsoft, Meta, and other ad networks may tailor the ads they serve based on your interests, sites or pages you have visited, web searches you’ve done, and other data they gather while you browse sites they manage or that use their tracking pixels.\n\nTo modify your interests or turn off personalization for ads served by Google, you can visit Google’s Ad Settings. You can also turn off ad personalization with Google’s “Interest-Based Advertising Opt-out” browser plug-in, which opts you out of the advertising cookie that Google uses to show you interest-based ads.\n\nTo turn off personalization for ads served by Microsoft, you can visit Microsoft’s Ad Settings.\n\nTo modify your preferences or turn off personalization for ads served by Meta, you can visit Meta’s Ad Preferences.\n\nIn addition, on your iPhone, iPad or Android, you can change your device settings to opt out of interest-based ads.\n\nMany of the companies that display interest-based advertising are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) and/or Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”). To learn more about interest-based advertising and how you may be able to opt-out of interest-based advertising, tracking, and/or sharing of tracking data by their members, visit their online resources at www.networkadvertising.org/choices and www.aboutads.info/choices, respectively. Other resources (not affiliated with NAI or DAA) include http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/, or for EU residents, www.youronlinechoices.eu.\n\nPlease note that if you opt-out of interest-based advertising using any of these methods, the opt-out may only apply to the specific browser, device or account from which you opt-out. Further, opting-out only means that the selected advertising platform(s) should no longer deliver certain interest-based advertising to you, but does not mean you will no longer see any online ads or stop seeing targeted content and/or ads from other ad networks. We cannot be responsible for effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third-parties’ opt-out options or programs.\n\nEmail List\n\nTo unsubscribe or request deletion from our email list contact us and we will proceed.\n\nPrinted Advertising\n\nIf you wish to opt-out of receiving printed catalogs or other printed advertisements via postal mail, please contact us to request removal from our mailing list.\n\nEuropean Privacy Rights\n\nWe are a U.S.-based business that does not target European residents or consumers (though we do not prohibit European residents from visiting our website, subscribing to our mailing list, or purchasing our products). If you are a “data subject” in Europe as defined by the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation, you may have additional rights in regard to your personal data. If you wish to discuss or exercise any of these rights, please contact us.\n\nRight to Deletion\n\nYou have the right to request deletion of the personal information about you that we have collected from you. Please note that we are unable to delete information needed to:\n\n1. Complete the transaction for which the Personal Information was collected.\n\n2. Detect, prevent or prosecute security incidents, fraud, or other misuse, or prosecute those responsible for such activity.\n\n3. Comply with legal or reporting obligations, including to pursue or defend legal claims, exercise, or enable others to exercise any rights provided by law, enforce or comply with contractual obligations, respond to valid requests for information, and comply with or enforce the applicable laws and regulations;\n\n4. Enable other internal uses consistent with your expectations based on your relationship with us or the context in which you provided the information; or\n\n5. Exercise or enforce any other exceptions provided by CCPA\n\nSubmitting Requests\n\nRequests for information on the disclosure of your Personal Information, and requests for deletion of your Personal Information must each be submitted separately. You can submit up to two requests for information on the disclosure of your Personal Information and up to four requests to delete your Personal Information within a 12-month period. To submit a request, contact us at webmaster@brandstar.com.\n\nTo protect your information from inadvertent deletion or disclosure, and to ensure the integrity of our systems and the proper fulfillment of your request, we cannot simultaneously process requests for access and deletion. Please wait until your pending request for access or deletion has been completed before submitting a subsequent request.\n\nVerification of your identity is required to process a request. In order to process your request, you must provide sufficient information to verify your identity. You may authorize someone to act as your agent and submit a CCPA request on your behalf. You must supply your agent with written permission to act on your behalf, and your agent must provide proof of such authorization before we will act upon the request. If you are submitting a request to access or delete through an authorized agent, you must verify your identity, unless your agent is acting pursuant to a power of attorney under the California Probate Code.\n\nIf you have any questions about any of the information on this page, contact us at webmaster@brandstar.com.\n\nNondiscrimination\n\nIf you exercise any of your rights under CCPA, you have the additional right not to be discriminated against, including by our (a) denying you goods or services, (b) charging you different prices or rates, including through the use of discounts or imposing penalties, (c) providing you a different level or quality of goods or services, or (d) suggesting that you will receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services if the differential treatment is reasonably related to value provided to us by your data.\n\nLINKS TO OUTSIDE THIRD PARTIES\n\nBrandStar may establish relationships with business partners by creating a link between their sites and the Website. BrandStar is not, however, responsible for the content, maintenance or privacy policies of those sites. Once you click over to a third party site, BrandStar encourages you to check its privacy policy.\n\nThe Website may contain links to other sites whose information practices may be different than the information practices of BrandStar. Users who click over to a third party site from a link on the Website must be aware that BrandStar makes no warranties with regard to that site’s policies or business practices. BrandStar is not responsible for any transactions that occur between the user and the third party site. Please consult the other sites’ privacy policies, as BrandStar has no control over information that is submitted to or collected by these third parties. Should a user purchase any products or services from that third party site, the user must contact the third party site directly regarding any disputes that might occur, including but not limited to delayed shipping, missing products, damaged goods or pricing and billing discrepancies. BrandStar is not responsible for the actions of any third-party site.\n\nCHILDREN’S GUIDELINES\n\nThe Website is not directed at or intended for children under 13 years of age. BrandStar does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13, nor does it contact children under the age of 13 about special offers or for marketing purposes without a parent’s permission. BrandStar encourages parents and legal guardians to monitor their children’s Internet use. Also, BrandStar strongly encourages parents to help BrandStar enforce its Privacy Policy by instructing their children never to provide personal information on the Website without permission.\n\nIt is possible that due to fraud or deception by others, BrandStar may unknowingly receive information pertaining to children under the age of 13. If BrandStar is notified of this, once BrandStar has verified the information, BrandStar will promptly obtain parental consent or otherwise delete the information from its servers. If you want to notify BRANDSTAR of its receipt of information in relation to children under the age of 13, please email webmaster@brandstar.com.\n\nCOPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)\n\nWhen it comes to the collection of personal information from children under 13, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, the nation’s consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children’s privacy and safety online.\n\nWe do not specifically market to children under 13.\n\nFair Information Practices\n\nThe Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.\n\nIn order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:\n\nWe will notify the users via in-site notification within 30 business days\n\nWe also agree to the Individual Redress Principle, which requires that individuals have a right to pursue legally enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.\n\nPUBLIC FORUMS\n\nThe Website may have chat rooms, forums, message boards and newsgroups available to its users. Please remember that any information disclosed in these areas becomes public information. Exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information. If you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. As these forums are public and open for users to interact with each other, BrandStar expects all its users to respect the rights of others. By using these forums, you agree that BrandStar is not responsible for any information that you disclose or communicate in such forums, and any disclosures you make are at your own risk.\n\nCONSENT TO INTERNATIONAL INFORMATION TRANSFERS\n\nThe Website is operated in the United States.

BrandStar is able to keep your personal information safe and secure by utilizing the industry standard technology, including password protected member records, firewalls, secure servers and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption technology.
