        "text": "Multi-screen measurement specialist Rentrak has partnered with product placement analysis firm iTVX, to help brands and programmers understand the impact on audiences when a TV show uses a brand in a story line.\n\niTVX analyses the value, performance quality and audience impact of product placement on TV, film and web video. Through the partnership, the firm will combine Rentrak's TV Essentials second-by-second audience demographics and viewing information with its own Branded Engagement metrics.\n\nFrank Zazza, CEO of iTVX, says the deal will provide advertisers and broadcasters with '360 degree solutions and insights' for analysing, implementing and measuring placements.\n\nRentrak CEO Bill Livek adds: 'Similar to Rentrak's exact commercial ratings, clients can now measure the exact number of viewers while their product is exposed during a telecast. No other product in the marketplace is capable of providing this type of industry solution, on this scale and level of sophistication and actionability.'\n\nWeb sites: www.rentrak.com and www.itvx.com ."
