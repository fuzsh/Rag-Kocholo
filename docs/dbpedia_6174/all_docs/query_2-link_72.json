The addition of Cinepolis, gives Rentrak a huge boost in its efforts in India, where Rentrak has just launched its services to track movie box office revenues with the Rajkumar Hirani and Vidhu Vinod Chopra’s film PK starring Aamir Khan.\n\n“India is one of the fastest-growing theatrical markets and our measurement is vital to helping serve their clients, we look forward to our partnership with Cinepolis and expanding as they continue to add more screens,” said Rentrak worldwide movie measurement business president Ron Giambra.\n\nCinepolis India managing director Javier Sotomayor added, “India is a very exciting market with tremendous passion for cinema. When this passion can be measured accurately in real time and understood in terms of box-office analytics, it will pave way for greater growth in the industry and better movie products for the country as a whole.”\n\nRentrak's Box Office Essentials and International Box Office Essentials are the movie industry's source for comprehensive global box office intelligence and are used as the currency by every studio in the United States as well as distribution entities around the world.
