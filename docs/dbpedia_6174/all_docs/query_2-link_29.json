        "text": "Entertainment industry researcher Rentrak has formed an alliance with online ticket seller MovieTickets.com to co-develop data products for the movie and TV industries.\n\nUnder the partnership, unveiled Thursday, Rentrak will link its merged TV viewing and box office sales information with MovieTickets.com’s individual-level ticket purchasing information. That data will be used to help studios and TV programmers better target TV advertising and interpret the effectiveness of their ad campaigns.\n\nThe companies did not reveal a timetable for their new products. They touted the upcoming offerings as including a combination of movie data and demographic household information that will allow distributors, theater owners, movie studios, advertising agencies and television programmers to more precisely target audiences.\n\n“As MovieTickets.com continues to build out and focus on research initiatives, Rentrak is a perfect fit for us,” said Joel Cohen, CEO of MovieTickets.com. “We’re combining our strengths to deliver authoritative solutions that will contribute to an improved media planning process.”\n\nRentrak CEO and vice chairman Bill Livek said: “This partnership combines two of Rentrak’s areas of expertise: Movies and Television. Combined with our other analytics, these products further strengthen our ability to help the movie and television industries.”\n\nMovieTickets.com touts itself as the largest online ticket provider with access to 28,000 screens."
