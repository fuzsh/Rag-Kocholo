        "text": "Josh Chasin, Comscore’s chief research officer, explains how the media measurement firm is continuously adapting in an era of multi-screens, cross-platform media consumption.\n\nIn his long industry experience in media and advertising, Josh Chasin has seen many changes in the measurement landscape. Probably the most profound one is the migration of media measurement from panel-based to multi-sourced; from sample to census; from survey research to data science.\n\n“Audience measurement is now about amassing the best data assets available, building data assets in-house, and using new techniques to integrate it all into a seamless, granular, flexible whole. We can no longer meet measurement needs with a single ‘magical’ panel.”\n\nAs an example he names Project Dovetail by BARB (the UK’s Broadcasters’ Audience Research Board), which addresses the rise of online delivery of programmes and commercials with multiple-screen viewing figures. Comscore’s own cross-platform measurement solutions in the US include return path data from about 30 million households, digital census data from publishers that tag web properties, a national panel of persons-level TV viewing, as well as panels covering computers, mobile phones and tablets. “We have also built a Total Home Panel in which we measure all digital activity by metering the household router. Panels like this enable us to train, calibrate and inform larger big data assets.”\n\nGoogle\n\nComscore measures audiences, brands and consumer behavior using proprietary digital, TV and movie intelligence with demographic details to quantify consumers’ multiscreen behavior. The question is whether this will be affected by the new partnership between Nielsen, Facebook, Google, Twitter and WPP-owned Kantar Media. This collaboration aims to build a standardised cross-media brand measurement model. Interestingly, WPP also has a 20 per cent stake in Comscore.\n\nAs a reply Chasin quotes Sam Walton, the founder of Wal-Mart. “He used to say: ‘You take care of the customer, and let the customer take care of the competition.’ In a market where consumer behavior is changing as quickly and dramatically as the media landscape, it’s best to focus our energy and innovation on how we can provide solutions that address our customers’ challenges.”\n\nIn a market where consumer behavior is changing as quickly and dramatically as the media landscape, it’s best to focus our energy and innovation on how we can provide solutions that address our customers’ challenges.\n\nThe aforementioned Google recently decided to remove all third-party tracking pixels from its advertising, meaning it is the only company that can now provide an ad-effectiveness measure on any of its channels. Comscore works extensively with Google, comments Chasin. “While we cannot speak for them, I sense they fully understand the value and importance of third-party measurement while needing to mediate that with their concern for consumer privacy. I suspect that Google will find the best technical solution to manage both of these priorities. And I’m optimistic we’ll be a vital part of that solution.”\n\nGlobal scale\n\nFor many years cross-media brand measurement has been the Holy Grail for brands. To measure and understand campaign impact across different media is as crucial as it is complicated. Adding to the challenge is the fact that most media measurement practice is entrenched and siloed, something Chasin acknowledges.\n\n“There’s no doubt that the industry is fragmented. You have a proliferation of walled gardens, a lack of standardised metrics and nomenclature, and media being transacted on and evaluated in siloes.”\n\nBut he also believes that it is possible to come up with a reliable and comprehensive system. “There has been much innovation in the last ten years, and frankly, we’ve been behind a lot of it. Comscore pioneered the integration of census measurement with panel measurement on a global scale, this is now accepted as state of the art. Rentrak, one of our predecessor companies, pioneered the incorporation of return path data at massive scale in the delivery of local and national TV ratings. We’re seeing other audience measurement companies slowly come to rpd.”\n\nLive-tweeting\n\nLooking ahead, Chasin expects much from further collaboration with partners on both the buy and sell side. “Together, we will continue to innovate and co-create comprehensive cross-platform measurement.”\n\nAs an example, he names last year’s US beta launch of the new cross-platform video advertising measurement solution, Comscore Campaign Ratings, in partnership with 12 leading media companies. Most recently, CNN moved from the beta to the commercial use of this solution. “This is just the first step in a broader company initiative to develop comprehensive and unduplicated measurement across all platforms and content types. We will continue to work closely with both sides of the industry to make sure we’re creating solutions that meet the needs on both sides of the buy/sell transaction. This has been our strategy the past year and will continue to be a major focus for the company.”\n\nAdding to the cross-media challenges are the continuous changes in screen usage. To come up with a reliable measurement when so many people are using at least two screens simultaneously, seems a particular obstacle. “The key,” says Chasin, “is to keep the consumer at the center of the measurement equation. The trend today is to measure ad delivery onto the screen; viewability. Once the ad is on the screen, advertisers will want to understand how consumers are engaging with that ad, and if that ad is driving real-word outcomes. The interesting thing about simultaneous media usage is that it opens the door for two-screen experiences. For example, the star of a show live-tweeting during the premiere. As long as we can understand the consumer’s experience, we can endeavor to measure it reliably. The industry – and Comscore specifically – is making inroads and there is still more to come.”\n\nTransparency\n\nMeanwhile there is growing concern for privacy, with a lot of negative coverage about companies surreptitiously gathering consumer information. Chasin concurs there’s currently a trust gap between audiences and the advertising industry.\n\n“Consumers are rightfully wary of brands, big tech and data companies, given the negative press around the lack of transparency in data collection and sharing.” He believes there are two ways to rebuild and retain consumer trust: transparency and empowerment. “It’s important to make sure consumers are fully aware of privacy policies and terms of service. Individuals should be able to opt-in or out, and consent to data collection before any information is collected. And all data collected should be aggregated so that an individual’s anonymity remains intact, be it from a panel or census. In addition, consumers should be empowered with respect to how their data is used, and by whom. As we find ways to empower consumers with choice, they will be more comfortable with the ways in which businesses use data.”\n\n“It’s important to make sure consumers are fully aware of privacy policies and terms of service. Individuals should be able to opt-in or out, and consent to data collection before any information is collected.\n\nHe welcomes the recent focus on data privacy and data governance. “It is encouraging other businesses, who might not have held the same standard, to join us in being open and honest. Our clients rely on us to achieve the highest standards of data privacy, so they have complete trust in us.” Chasin feels that industry bodies can play a role in this too. “They are a voice of authority that help the sector stay ahead of the curve, recognise and inspire innovation, and share best practices. In terms of legal issues relevant to the sector, it is important for ESOMAR and other industry bodies to provide guidance and advice to help organisations navigate new regulations and laws, as well as help hold businesses accountable if they slip below these standards.”\n\nEditor’s note: Amy Yeung, VP and Deputy General Counsel, Comscore is a member of ESOMAR’s Legal Affairs Committee.\n\nUnlocking the power\n\nAs for the future, Chasin is excited about the technological changes he sees on the horizon. “Marketing strategies have grown increasingly sophisticated and refined, but for years all that great thinking has fallen apart at the media execution level as agencies have had to translate their true targets into age/gender targets. But the big data assets enable us to finally unlock the power of what’s being called advanced audiences.”\n\nIn the next few years, he expects to see an increase in addressability, whilst TV will get more like digital, moving from spots to impressions. “This will accelerate the ability of advertisers to deploy precise, advanced audiences in TV. We see TV and digital converging as cross-platform, transacted at the impression level based on precise, advanced audiences. And we’re excited to be supporting that revolution.”"
