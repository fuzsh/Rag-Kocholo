        "text": "Rentrak Corporation and Concurrent announced a partnership agreement to offer cross-platform services. Rentrak is a Portland, Oregon-based media measurement and research company and Concurrent is a provider of video and media systems.\n\nAs part of this agreement, Concurrent will collect and correlate data across multiple services, while validating the integrity and timing of the data at the source level. In turn, Rentrak will ingest the consolidated data and apply measurement, analytics and reporting services across operators for networks and advertisers.\n\nConcurrent said that, this partnership would help operators, networks and advertisers to use their data management and reporting model to address advertising offerings across converging platforms, including television, mobile devices and the internet. With this approach, the operators and content providers are also expected to have the ability to monetise media information with advertisers.\n\nBoth the companies have collaborated indirectly to expand their support to cross-platform data collection and analytics.\n\nPaul Haddad, vice president and general manager of media data and advertising solutions at Concurrent, said: “This partnership directly aligns with Concurrent’s commitment to help our customers better deliver and monetise high-quality video across the three screens through an open, commercial and intelligent model.”"
