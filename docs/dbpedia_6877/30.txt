Leap Year is something that only comes around once every 4 years and to celebrate there’s many leap day deals around Southwest Florida.

I’ve always wondered for those born on a leap year when they celebrate their birthday. If it’s on the 28th or March 1st. But today is the day to really go all out. For the first time in 4 years we have a February 29th! And even if it’s not your birthday, it’s still a bonus day for the rest of us, so there’s a lot of places that have fun deals going on today.

Krispy Kreme– buy a dozen of any regularly priced donuts and get a dozen original glazed donuts for $2.29. Also, if today is your birthday, you’ll get a free dozen original glazed donuts (no purchase necessary)

Chipotle– rewards members today can get a free side of guac if you place an order online or in the app

Wendy’s– get a free Cinnabon Pull-Apart in the drive-thru or dining room

Staples– Staples is giving away 29,000 passport photos to rewards members today
