BEFORE your daily work is dominated by the minutiae required to run a business, go find someone who is gifted at: - execution - managing people - driving accountability - staying focused on a limited set of priorities i.e., an Integrator. Your investors, leadership team, employees, family and friends, and the quality of your sleep will thank you for it! #leadership #management #entrepreneurship\n\nI've always considered myself a bit of a rebel. You have to be an entrepreneur for over a decade, helping people strategize through their most significant business challenges. But I will NEVER not be stunned by a face tattoo. This morning, I saw a certain celeb with a face tattoo of her kids' names. I thought, \"Okay, cute,\" but wow, she really said, \"I want this on my forehead forever.\" It got me thinking: if I absolutely had to get a face tattoo, what would it be? As a strategist, people tell me everything. I am an information sponge, absorbing every detail our clients share. However, I find one question very effective in cutting through the noise and getting to the heart of any obstacle. I borrowed it from a fantastic book called 'The Coaching Habit' by Michael Bungay Stanier, and have been using it for years. That question is: \"What is the real challenge here?\" and it's what I would have tattooed on my forehead. üòÖ This question helps people focus on what they can control and what's actionable. It opens up our work together to find what will actually move the needle forward and have an impact. So, next time you feel stuck or are spinning your wheels, ask yourself: 'What's the real challenge here?' You might be surprised by the clarity it brings. #businessgrowth #businesstrategy #strategist #entreprenuership #Leadership #TheCoachingHabit #StrategicThinking\n\nIf you are a company founder, odds are that you are: - a strategic thinker - a creative problem solver - awesome at owning big relationships - have 20 ideas before you finish your first cup of coffee In other words, a textbook Visionary.

Yesterday for me, it was time to review February! I reviewed 1Ô∏è‚É£things that went well, 2Ô∏è‚É£things that I want to improve and 3Ô∏è‚É£build a bit of a go forward plan for March. Incorporating my #personal and #professional life As a typical type A #entrepreneur, I‚Äôm always going and not good at reflecting, reevaluating and repurposing, so I‚Äôm trying to get better at this in 2024 I have a great structure I have implemented for a personal monthly review that takes about one hour allows you to really think about the previous month. Give me a comment below üëá if you would like a copy of the template.

(Luckily, all three are easy to avoid with the right guidance.) Here they are. üëá At the end of the day, we are all human. And all humans make mistakes. However, after working with many business owners over the years, I‚Äôve found there are common mistakes many business owners make‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ ones that stifle their growth, and they don‚Äôt even realize they‚Äôre making them! But these can be avoided with the support of an advisor or CFO. Here are a few of these common mistakes ‚¨áÔ∏è ‚ùå Not outsourcing or delegating soon enough ‚ùå Spending too much time on activities that don‚Äôt grow the business ‚ùå Avoiding investing in the people and resources that are needed to succeed Without an advisor or a CFO, it can be challenging to recognize when you are making mistakes that could be stunting your company's success. This is one of the reasons I always tell business owners to work with an advisor! üëâ So they can help you spot these red flags early on. Have you ever made any of these mistakes in your business? If you answered yes, then maybe it‚Äôs time for us to chat about how having an advisor could help. DM me today! #entrepreneurship #management #leadership #future #success"
