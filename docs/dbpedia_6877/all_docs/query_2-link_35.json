(May 23, 2023) – The48th Annual Gracie Awards, presented by the Alliance for Women in Media Foundation (AWMF), illuminated the night with an extraordinary celebration of women in media held at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel. The evening honored the exceptional talent that have left an indelible mark on the industry, inspiring audiences, and revolutionizing storytelling.\n\nInside the gala, a powerful atmosphere prevailed, showcasing stories of triumph, civil rights activists, and women who are actively shifting culture through their narratives. The winners of this year’s Gracie Awards embody the spirit and courage exemplified by Gracie Allen, and they serve as a reminder of the invaluable contributions women make in shaping our media landscape.\n\nMarlo Thomas, renowned for her groundbreaking role as television’s first independent single woman in “That Girl” and revered as a Founding Mother of the Ms. Foundation for Women, was honored with the distinguished Lifetime Achievement Award. Tony Thomas, brother of Marlo and an Academy Award nominated television and film producer, presented the award to her.\n\nAdditional presenters and attendees included influential figures such as Atsuko Okatsuka, Jodi Balfour, Bishop Briggs, Keltie Knight, Kerri Kasem, Ellen K, Hallie Sahar, Harriet Dyer, Julie Carmen, Lily Moore, Rose McIver, Terri J. Vaughn, Chelsea Gilligan, Sharon Carpenter, and Medalion Rahimi. A special musical performance by 14-time Oscar nominee Diane Warren and Shayna Zaid, enthralled the audience, reminding everyone of the power of music in storytelling. EXTRA’s correspondent, Rachel Lindsay, served as the Gracie Awards social media ambassador, and the ceremony was executive produced by Vicangelo Bulluck.\n\nThis year’s Gracies Awards also shined a spotlight on the incredible achievements of women directors and writers. Their talent and dedication were celebrated, emphasizing the critical roles they play in shaping the cultural landscape through their storytelling.\n\nNOTABLE MOMENTS\n\nMarlo Thomas during her lifetime award acceptance speech said: “All of these memories are nutrition for the soul. And events like this one created by women and recognizing women are our nutrition. You see examples of others who are finding their voices. We hear their dreams and share their stories. They give us life.They give us enthusiasm that we can continue to make new dreams.”\n\nMiranda Kwok (The Cleaning Lady), winner of the Writer Scripted – Drama category, said: “I stand here in solidarity with my fellow writers as we fight for fair treatment and compensation and the simple recognition that the soul of a writer cannot be replaced with Artificial Intelligence. As writers, our goal is to enlighten and inspire, to reach hearts and minds, to build compassion and understanding, and to effect change for the betterment of humanity.”\n\nPresenter Rachel Lindsay introduced the women directors moment with a powerful tribute, recognizing their vital role in shaping on-screen stories following an unprecedented number of submissions saying, “An interesting fact, most people don’t know that women directors were vital to the beginning of cinematic storytelling. But when movies became big business in the 1920’s, the male dominated studio system created monopolies that pushed out female and minority led independent film companies.”\n\nMichelle Miller (48 Hours: “Katrina Brownlee: The Good Cop”), News Magazine [TV – National] category, said: “I want you to know I’m not old enough to remember Gracie Allen, but I am old enough to remember her husband, George Burns. I remember him telling stories of this incredible woman, his late wife, adoring stories, but also kind of mischievous ones. And I thought she’s been dead 20 years, and yet he still talks about her like she’s here in this moment. She had to be one heck of a fine lady. One heck of a fine lady. One heck of an extraordinary lady…”\n\nAt its core, the Gracie Awards Gala supports AWMF’s charitable efforts. As a non-profit organization, AWMF is dedicated to creating educational programs, charitable activities, and scholarship initiatives that benefit women in the media.

The Gracies Lifetime Achievement Award honors a woman in media who exemplifies and embodies the essence of the late, great media trailblazer Gracie Allen, the namesake of the Gracie Awards.\n\n“Marlo Thomas is not only a true icon of the entertainment industry, but a visionary whose work has left a lasting impact on society,” said Becky Brooks, President of the AWMF. “Her groundbreaking role as Ann Marie in ‘That Girl’ shattered stereotypes and opened doors for women in television. Furthermore, Marlo’s charitable and activist work with the Ms. Foundation for Women and St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital has transformed countless lives, making her a beacon of hope and inspiration to us all. She truly exemplifies the ethos of AWMF. We’re proud to honor her with this year’s Lifetime Achievement Award.”\n\nThomas is an award-winning actress, author and activist whose body of work continues to impact American entertainment and culture. She has been honored with four Emmy Awards, the Peabody, a Golden Globe and a Grammy, and has been inducted into the Broadcasting Hall of Fame. In November 2014, she was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom—the highest honor a civilian can receive—by President Barack Obama at a White House ceremony.\n\nShe burst onto the scene as television’s That Girl, which broke new ground for independent women everywhere, and which she also conceived and produced. Her pioneering spirit continued with her creation of the children’s entertainment project, Free to Be…You and Me, which became a platinum album, best-selling book, Emmy Award-winning television special and a stage show. In March of 2021, the original recordwas entered into the National Recording Registry of the Library of Congress to underscore its cultural significance. Proceeds from Free to Be…You and Me went toward the formation of the Ms. Foundation for Women, which was co-founded by Marlo, Gloria Steinem, Letty Cottin Pogrebin and Pat Carbine. They also created Take Our Daughters to Work Day.\n\nHer body of work on television has consistently won her both popular and critical acclaim. In the 2022 holiday season, she co-starred in Hallmark’s A Magical Christmas Village (her first holiday movie since her classic It Happened One Christmas). Additionally, she has lent comedic turns to the Netflix miniseries Wet Hot American Summer:Ten Years Later and Warner Brothers’ Ocean’s 8. Other notable television appearances include her portrayal of a mentally ill woman in Nobody’s Child, for which she won the Emmy for Best Dramatic Actress, and numerous guest appearances on popular series, including Friends, in which she was nominated for an Emmy for her portrayal of Jennifer Aniston’s mom. She has won glowing reviews on stage, most recently in Elaine May’s 2012 Broadway comedy-drama, Relatively Speaking; and in Tony Award-winning playwright Joe DiPietro’s 2015 dark comedy, Clever Little Lies.\n\nFor her activism, Thomas has been honored with the Helen Caldicott Award for Nuclear Disarmament; the ACLU’s Thomas Paine Award; the American Women in Radio and Television Satellite Award; the William Kunstler Racial Justice Award; The National Civil Rights Museum Freedom Award; and The Jefferson Award for Public Service, which she received along with Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.\n\nAt its core, the Gracie Awards Gala supports AWMF’s charitable efforts.

is the largest fundraiser of the Alliance for Women in Media Foundation which advances women in media through educational programs and scholarships. The Gracie Awards honors exemplary programming and individual talent created by, for and about women. The Alliance for Women in Media Foundation has created partnerships and joint initiatives with the Emma Bowen Foundation, the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB), NCTA – The Internet & Television Association and other organizations that are philosophically aligned with the mission of the Foundation.

Who would have ever dreamed it would take this long to consistently connect again? In March of 2020, many of us thought we needed to stay at home for a few weeks – three years later, we’re back-ish.\n\nWhile we still must take precautions and there’s a hint of uncertainty, there is also a willingness to gather at the risk of staying isolated any longer. 2022 was unpredictable and created inherent hesitancies after a two-year separation.\n\nThis was a year where COVID vaccines became widely available, where we learned more about “supply chain” than ever thought possible, where we paid attention to gasoline prices and felt the pain of grocery bills. All the while, there were enjoyable and even epic moments like seeing the world come together for the World Cup, unite behind causes like women’s rights in countries where they are suppressed and find reasons for hopefulness such as recent protections secured for equality in marriage.\n\nAs we say every year, through it all, media was there, on the frontlines, to tell the stories. You were there when others couldn’t be so our communities could see and hear first-hand accounts of life in their backyards and around the world.\n\nBrave journalists were the feature of this acknowledgement at the Gracie Awards Gala this year, which focused on war correspondents — throughout history and this year on the frontlines in Ukraine and elsewhere.\n\nAt the end of every year, I reflect on the bravery of the women signing AWM into existence more than 70 years ago and then creating an awards program 50 years ago to celebrate the programming and individual talent created by, for and about women. This year, we continued that tradition through gatherings at the NAB Show, our Gracie Awards, the first Gracies Leadership Awards in three years and the second AWM Connects where those newer to the industry are connected to executives.\n\nAs we move forward, our leadership is focused squarely on a phrase that encapsulates who we are – advancing women in media. This will continue through our existing programs and scholarships as well as additional opportunities added following the recent Strategic Planning session. This is only possible through the engagement of our media community. You can make this possible through a donation (Venmo @AWM-Foundation), join AWM and enter outstanding content and programming for the Gracie Awards.\n\nOn a personal level, it was so good to be back “in-person” across the board. I thrive being around people and get energy from events and experiences. Our kids started high school and middle school in an actual building, which was so refreshing (of course, with its own set of “special” at those ages.) And as so many who read this note can appreciate, balancing work-life with family and work is fulfilling and exhausting. I’m a better mom and steward to AWM with organized chaos.\n\nI’m finishing 2022 cautiously hopeful for next year. We know things can change on a dime and value the connections and work of our industry and know there is more we can do together.\n\nAs we say at the close of our events\n\nGood night Gracie!\n\nBecky Brooks\n\n(Proudly) President, AWM & Foundation\n\nAlliance for Women in Media to Honor Seven Female Leaders at Gracies Leadership Awards\n\nOctober 4, 2022 (New York) – The Alliance for Women in Media (AWM) is pleased to announce the seven honorees for the Gracies Leadership Awards on Monday, November 14, 2022, at Tribeca 360 in New York, New York.

The organization also announced investing in the next generation of women in media through partnerships with Google News Initiative and Mattel creating two unique fellowship programs for students pursuing a career in either journalism or media.\n\n“It is an exceptional honor to recognize and celebrate this strong lineup and powerhouse of women leaders in our industry,” said Becky Brooks, President, Alliance for Women in Media. “Soledad O’Brien as our keynote speaker will undoubtedly create an unforgettable event for everyone in attendance,” added Brooks.\n\nSpecial thanks to sponsors of the Gracies Leadership Awards including Google News Initiative as a presenting sponsor, ABC News, American Urban Radio Network, Clear Channel Outdoor, Disney Media & Entertainment, Hallmark Media, Katz Media Group, Mattel, and NCTA – The Internet & Television Association.
