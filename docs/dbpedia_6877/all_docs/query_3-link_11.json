        "text": "Chaos Results as a Snake Invades the B1039 studio…\n\nActually, it’s the most basic of tasks. Don’t prop the door open if you’re about to let someone inside the building. The radio station is very near to a wooded area, so don’t prop the door open out of worry for safety. Many animals live in this part of the woods. On your commute to work some days, you might encounter some wildlife. I’ve seen turtles, gators, lizards, and rabbits. I could go on forever.\n\nI’ve seen everything you can think of. Today’s Man Panel segment features guests on the show. Every week we provide relationship advice to our listeners via the Panel. Booger is one of the regular guests. I’ve known Booger for a very long time. In addition, He has also gained a lot of notoriety around the building. primarily because of the issues he causes.\n\nIt doesn’t happen often that your body crashes through the office ceiling during a crucial business meeting. He did that, indeed. Why? He was locked in a closet. Booger made the decision to flee by scaling the ceiling vents. Not a smart move Booger. It was the same this week. He was warned not to prop the door open when getting the other guests, but he did so nevertheless, allowing animals inside. At first, we assumed it was only a toad, but it turns out he was accompanied by a companion, a snake.\n\nNaturally, Booger was forced to go get the snake on his own, and we gave him clear instructions to take it out, put it in a box, and put it back outside where it belongs. Sounds simple enough, no? Yet again, Booger is in the picture. Booger needed to use the restroom thanks to drinking too much coffee, so he placed the snake inside the box and left it unattended instead of taking it outside, where it later escaped once more.\n\nThis time into the office of our general manager. The meeting after the show wasn’t the best, to put it mildly. Booger may have fallen through the ceiling once before, so it could have been worse. Booger may cause chaos in our lives. But he has good intentions. However, most of the time his tasks turned into epic fails. What do you expect with the misadventures of Booger?\n\nMeet Budman, dynamic host of Marconi Award winning radio station WXKB's WiLD Bunch Morning Show, on B1039. Budman likes to write about funny news, a good Florida man story, stupid criminals or anything involving a superhero. Budman, a comic book and pop culture enthusiast, even named his daughter Kara Zor-El, after Supergirl. His only child is his true passion beyond the mic. Being a dad is his favorite role. Budman, a true family man, balances his love for radio with quality time spent with loved ones and his trusty dogs."
