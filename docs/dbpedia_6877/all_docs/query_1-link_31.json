        "text": "The entire Book of Daniel is saturated in eschatological revelation especially in our focal passage of Dan. 9:24-27 which speaks of the “seventy weeks” which is better rendered as “units of seven” that scholars agree refers to time periods of seven years each. This prophecy of seventy weeks is in regard to when Daniel prays to God to act on behalf of his people (Israel) and receives a detailed but ambiguous prophecy from God through the angel Gabriel. This exegetical analysis provides relevant contextual/background information about the entire Book of Daniel. It then transitions to explaining the meaning of the given passage in light of four different views: Liberal, Conservative (Historical Christian), Contemporary Christian (Evangelical), and Jewish.\n\nThe volume contains seven original studies, each of which focuses on a different chapter or central passage in Daniel and offers a new interpretation or reading of the passage in question. The studies span the Danielic tales and apocalypses, offering innovative analyses that often challenge the scholarly consensus regarding the exegesis of this book. The eight chapters relate to Daniel 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, Susanna, and the conception of angelology in Daniel. The studies are all based on careful textual analysis, including comparison between the Hebrew/Aramaic and Greek versions (especially regarding Daniel 4–6), and, in each case, the larger arguments are built upon solid philological foundations. Many of the insights proposed in this volume are based upon the realization that the authors of Daniel were frequently interpreters of earlier biblical books, and that the identification of these intertextual clues can be the key to unlocking the meaning of these texts. In this sense, Daniel is similar to other contemporaneous works, such as Jubilees and Qumran literature, but the extent of this phenomenon has not been fully appreciated by scholars of the book. This volume therefore contributes to the appreciation of Daniel as both the latest book in the Hebrew Bible, and a significant work in the landscape of Second Temple Judaism."
