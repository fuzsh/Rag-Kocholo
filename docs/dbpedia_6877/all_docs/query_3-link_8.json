        "text": "If owning a private island paradise sounds like a dream, you can own a Florida island for $1000.\n\nOne of my favorite things is going to the beach. Whether it’s Fort Myers Beach, out to Sanibel, Bonita Beach or Naples, we’re so lucky in Southwest Florida to have lots of options. But let’s face it. Parking can be a pain between having to find a spot and then have to pay for it. Screaming kids can put a damper on a relaxing day. And if you want to pack a cooler with some adult beverages, some beaches don’t allow it. So having a private island with a beach to yourself sounds pretty good right? But when I hear private island, all I see are dollar signs. But in this case, you can own a Florida island for $1000.\n\nYou Can Own A Florida Island For $1000\n\nIn the Tampa Bay area there’s an island known to the locals as “Beer Can Island”. The island is formally known as Pine Key on Paradise Island. It’s a very popular destination for boaters, and it’s the boaters that gave it it’s nickname due to lots of beer cans littering the island. The man-made island was made back in the early 40’s. According to News6, the island was used for dredging up until 2017 when a man by the name of Richard Loomis purchased the island with some friends. Over time, they added some fun features for visitors like tiki bars and porta potties. Needing more money and time to keep it up, Loomis decided to put the island up for sale for $14 million. While $14 million may be a little too much for most, there is a way to get in on it for much less. You can own a Florida island for $1000.\n\nHow You Can Own A Florida Island For $1000\n\nNick Lipidarov is the CEO of Children of Faith, Inc. and he’s creating a project that will allow people to co-own the island together. The project is called “Save Beer Can Island” and you can pledge $1000 to be a partial owner of the island. On their website, it explains that the money will go toward the purchase of the island, plus taxes, fees, website and other costs to keep it running. You’ll also be able to vote on what should be done with the island once it belongs to you. This could be your chance to own an island! If you’re interested, pledges must be made by April 30th.\n\nMarija is a morning show host on WXKB/B1039 and midday host on WRXK/96KRock.
