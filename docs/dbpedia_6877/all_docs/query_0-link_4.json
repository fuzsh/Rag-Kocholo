        "text": "There’s a lot of prestigious clubs here in Florida and one golf course in South Florida has a $1 million membership fee.\n\nWhen it comes to golf, there’s a lot of money spent on either the HOA’s to live in neighborhoods that have them or the green fees themselves. A lot of clubs are private and come with very hefty memberships like Old Collier in Naples that has a $310,000 initiation fee. And other courses are public and just to play one round can be pricy. Tiburon in Naples for example can run you anywhere from $99-$289. I know some people that have even chosen where to live based on the course that’s literally in their backyard.\n\nA Golf Course In South Florida Has a $1 Million Membership Fee\n\nYes, you read that right, a $1 million membership fee.\n\nThe Shell Bay Club in Hallandale Beach just opened on Tuesday featuring an 18-hole private golf course designed by Greg Norman. Not only as a member can you enjoy the golfing, but there’s also a racquet center and a private yacht club. Residents will pay a pretty penny for their real estate. CBS News reports the minimum unit price is $3 million. Penthouses start at $11 million. But homes do come with butler service, so that’s a nice perk.\n\nThe 9 Best Public Golf Courses in Southwest Florida: Ranked\n\nMarija is a morning show host on WXKB/B1039 and midday host on WRXK/96KRock. She loves to write about food, travel, and things to do around the state of Florida."
