        "text": "When it comes to road rage, some people might honk their horn, give you a one-finger salute, or unleash a symphony of expletives. But Wayne Perry, a 62-year-old resident of Cape Coral, took road rage to a whole new level. He went full-on Happy Gilmore with a golf club!\n\nAccording to NBC2, the unlucky victim, just trying to enjoy his drive, found himself in Perry’s crosshairs. Perry decides that he’s had enough of polite merging, and in a fit of rage, he cuts the poor driver off. Cue the eye roll and head shake from the victim. You know, the universal language of “Really, dude?”\n\nBut this isn’t your everyday road rage incident. Wayne “Golf Club” Perry took offense to that head shake. He wasn’t having it. Instead of letting bygones be bygones, Perry decides to play the part of a modern-day Sherlock Holmes. He tails the driver all the way home.\n\nGolf Club Attack:\n\nAs the situation escalates, Perry grabs his trusty golf club, which, for some reason, he just happened to have in his car. Perhaps he thought he’d spontaneously stumble upon a golf course on his way to the grocery store. Or maybe he wanted to beat the daylights out of something? In any case, he starts swinging like he’s in a angry round of mini-golf, and our victim decides to defend himself.\n\nMiraculously, both the victim and Perry manage to dial 911, but not before they’ve turned their little corner of Cape Coral into a golf course of chaos. One broken finger, a cut above Perry’s eyebrow, and one memorable phone call to the police later, our golf enthusiast found himself in handcuffs.\n\nSo the next time someone gives you the stink eye on the road, keep your golf clubs at home and maybe just let it slide. You don’t want people to think you’re a violent a hole-in-one.\n\nThe 9 Best Public Golf Courses in Southwest Florida: Ranked\n\nMeet Budman, dynamic host of Marconi Award winning radio station WXKB's WiLD Bunch Morning Show, on B1039.
