        "text": "American youth-focused radio network (1996–2021)\n\nFor the currently operating Latin American division, see Radio Disney Latin America.\n\nRadio Disney was an American radio network operated by the Disney Radio Networks unit of Disney Branded Television within Disney General Entertainment Content, headquartered in Burbank, California.\n\nThe network broadcast music programming oriented towards children, pre-teens and teenagers, focusing mainly on current hit music and a heavy emphasis on teen idols (particularly those signed with Disney Music Group record labels, such as Hollywood and Walt Disney); compared to most CHR stations, Radio Disney was far more aggressive in playing only current hits and eschewed recurrent rotation.[1]\n\nFor many years Radio Disney affiliated with stations in markets of varying size, mainly large and mid-sized markets; however, by the early 2010s, Disney had begun to phase out the network's affiliations with terrestrial radio stations, and sold its owned-and-operated Radio Disney stations (with the exception of KDIS in Los Angeles) to third-parties, in order to focus more on its programming, marketing, creating revenue producing events and distribution of Radio Disney as an internet radio outlet on digital platforms.[2]\n\nIn 2015, Radio Disney partnered with iBiquity to distribute the network terrestrially via its HD Radio platform, and with iHeartRadio for further digital distribution.[3] In the same year, Radio Disney launched a spin-off service, Radio Disney Country, which carried a country music format catered towards a similar audience; in 2017, this service replaced the main Radio Disney service on KDIS, which was renamed KRDC. The network also lent its name to the Radio Disney Music Awards, an annual music awards presentation broadcast on television since 2014 by Disney Channel.\n\nOn December 3, 2020, Disney announced that Radio Disney and Radio Disney Country would be shut down in the first quarter of 2021.[4][5][6] On April 14, 2021, Radio Disney ceased broadcast when its last remaining terrestrial station, KRDC in Los Angeles, was quietly changed to a simulcast of KSPN 710 AM, an ESPN Radio frequency.\n\nBackground\n\n[edit]\n\nDisney had for a long time been involved in the music business, building off its success in movies and TV shows, which later became Disney Music Group. However, with radio, Disney was not committed to the medium only doing a few shows. Radio Disney is Disney's third foray into radio. In late 1955, Walt Disney started The Magic Kingdom radio show—running Monday through Fridays and which was heard on ABC Radio.[7] Even before the 1996 Disney-CC/ABC merger, Disney and ABC Radio considered as early as 1991 planned for a children's radio network but dropped the idea.[8] Starting on July 31, 1994, Disney started a weekend radio show, Live From Walt Disney World, that originated from both Disney World and Disneyland on Radio AAHS.[8][9]\n\nIn November 1995, ABC Radio Networks and Children's Broadcast Corp. reached an agreement for ABC Radio to provide marketing and sales to Radio AAHS. After Disney's acquisition of CC/ABC, Disney had ABC Radio cancel the agreement in August 1996 plus announced the start of its own children's network and ended AAHS's Disney World broadcasting rights.[10]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nABC Radio Networks (1996–2006)\n\n[edit]\n\nRadio Disney was test launched at 5 a.m. on November 18, 1996, in four markets, Minneapolis, Atlanta, Salt Lake City, and Birmingham, Alabama by ABC Radio Networks. On March 8, 1997, a fifth test market was added, Seattle on former KidStar station KKDZ.\n\nPleased with the results in those four test markets, ABC Radio Networks announced on May 8, 1997, that Radio Disney would begin a nationwide rollout, starting on October 1, 1997.[11] On August 26, 1997, Radio Disney was launched in Los Angeles on KTZN/710, and by the end of the year, the network had 14 affiliates.[12]\n\nBy August 1998, 28 stations had affiliated with Radio Disney, with an expected 63 stations by the end of 1999. Radio Disney purchased KAAM (AM) (Plano, Texas) for $12 million and switched the station to the network in August.[13] In 1998, the network was based out of its Dallas station.[14]\n\nOther than music, the network aired other programs such as \"Mickey & Minnie's Tune Time\", a two-hour weekday toddler program, and two 60-second features per hour which included contests, \"ABC News for Kids\" and \"Gross Me Out\".[13] The network ran its Radio Disney Project Family Initiative from July 1 to September 15, 2003, with family-themed programming and events to get family to sign on to the Radio Disney Family Pledge.[15]\n\nRadio Disney would later begin being carried on XM Satellite Radio in 2001,[16] with the station launching on Sirius Satellite Radio in 2002.[2] Disney entered a joint venture to launch Capital Disney digital radio channel in Britain and operated from 2002 until June 29, 2007.[17] In 2004, Disney paid the former Children's Broadcasting Corporation (which operated children's radio network Radio Aahs) $12.4 million in a lawsuit settlement.[18]\n\nIn April 2002, Radio Disney began using a new logo, which was followed by the network redesigning its website, and changing its slogan to \"Your Music, Your Way\" on May 28, 2002.[19][20]\n\nOn July 30, 2003, ABC Radio Networks founded the Radio Disney Group, who took over operations of most of Radio Disney's stations.[21]\n\n2006 marked the network's 10th anniversary; Radio Disney rebroadcast its first hour of programming from November 18, 1996, on June 6, 2006, at around 4:58 pm. ET on stations in selected markets, such as WQEW.[citation needed] Also, as part of the 10th anniversary, Radio Disney held the \"Totally 10 Birthday Concert\" on July 22, 2006, at the Arrowhead Pond in Anaheim, California.[22] It also included a simultaneous live webcast on the Radio Disney website. A second concert was held in Dallas, Texas, on November 18, 2006, at the Dallas Convention Center.[citation needed]\n\nDisney Channels Worldwide (2006–2014)\n\n[edit]\n\nIn August 2006, operational duties of Radio Disney were transferred to the company's Disney–ABC Cable Networks Group (currently d.b.a. Disney Channels Worldwide), which otherwise operates Disney's cable television properties, except for ESPN.[23]\n\nOn June 12, 2007, Disney spun off and merged its ABC Radio Networks with Citadel Broadcasting into Citadel Communications while retaining its ESPN Radio and Radio Disney networks and stations.[24][25]\n\nIn March 2008, Radio Disney and Gracenote signed a licensing agreement starting immediately that allowed the lyrics to be seen along with the song online on Radio Disney Internet Radio Player.[26] The channel began streaming live on iTunes Radio Tuner in August 2008.[27] In November 2008, Radio Disney relocated its main operations from Dallas to Los Angeles.[14] The former radio studio that housed Radio Disney in Dallas began to be used by The Kidd Kraddick Morning Show in 2008.[14]\n\nOn October 8, 2008 the network launched the Next Big Thing feature which allowed listeners to vote on young unsigned artists' songs to be played.[28] In 2013, the Radio Disney Music Awards began airing on the Disney Channel.[29]\n\nSometime in April 2009, Radio Disney changed its logo to the one used until the station's closure.[30]\n\nBy 2009, Radio Disney was starting to reduce its station footprint to the larger markets to make the network more profitable. In January 2010, Radio Disney Group requested permission from the FCC to \"silence\" five of its owned-and-operated stations (along with a sixth station operating under a local marketing agreement with another company) while the stations were being sold.[31] Disney sold six AM stations and one FM station that year.[2] In June 2013, Disney announced the sale of seven owned-and-operated stations in medium-sized markets, in order to refocus Radio Disney's broadcast distribution on the top-25 radio markets.[32]\n\nOn April 10, 2014, it was announced that Radio Disney's Top 30 Countdown would become a syndicated radio show, distributed by Rick Dees's Dees Entertainment.[33] Aha Radio, Slacker and ShowMobile signed online carriage agreements with the network in mid-2014.[2]\n\nShift to HD Radio and digital (2014-2020)\n\n[edit]\n\nOn August 13, 2014, Radio Disney's general manager Phil Guerini announced plans to sell all but one of its remaining owned-and-operated stations on or before September 26, 2014, in order to focus more on the network's programming, co-branded events, and digital outlets. Listenership reports indicated that the majority of Radio Disney's audience listened to the network via satellite radio and other digital platforms, and only 18% via terrestrial AM/FM radio. KDIS remained operational to serve as the originating station for the Radio Disney network,[2][34] while the remaining stations would continue carrying Radio Disney programming until their respective sales were completed.[35] The last five Radio Disney owned-and-operated stations for sale were sold on September 15, 2015, to Salem Media Group (who was the largest purchaser of the stations) for $2.225 million.[36]\n\nOn April 13, 2015, Disney announced that the Radio Disney network would move to HD Radio subchannels; the network would be distributed by iBiquity via deals with broadcast companies (CBS Radio, Entercom, Cumulus Media, etc.) with ad sales handled by its HD Radio Digital Network. A network representative stated that the move was intended to target families as in-car listeners. Eventually, those deals ended quietly after a few years.[37] On August 6, 2015, Radio Disney was made available for listening on iHeartRadio.[3][38][39]\n\nIt was announced that on November 25, 2019, Disney had secured a deal with Entercom to bring Radio Disney and Radio Disney Country to the company's Radio.com platform.[40]\n\nDecline and closure (2020–2021)\n\n[edit]\n\nOn December 3, 2020, Disney announced that both Radio Disney and Radio Disney Country would shut down in the first quarter of 2021 as part of its restructuring plan to focus more on producing content for the television networks and Disney+, with KRDC being put up for sale.[4][5] Radio Disney began to wind down operations on December 31, 2020, as their DJ's hosted their final shows, and was discontinued on SiriusXM on that same date. Radio Disney Country was completely shut down at noon Pacific Time on December 31; KRDC subsequently returned to the main Radio Disney feed. On January 1, the station ceased its Top 40 format and switched to an automated throwback playlist which mainly consisted of songs from throughout the 24-year history of the network.[6] The Radio Disney app and website shut down on January 22, 2021, while the station continued to broadcast on iHeartRadio until it was removed sometime during March.[41] At that point, the station was only heard in the Greater Los Angeles Area and San Diego County on terrestrial radio until April 14, 2021, at 10 am PT, when it was quietly discontinued and switched to a simulcast of sister station KSPN. The final song Radio Disney played prior to being switched was “Unwritten” by Natasha Bedingfield.\n\nDespite the station now being defunct, Radio Disney’s Instagram and Twitter remain active to promote other Disney movies and TV shows, mainly those airing on Disney+.\n\nReplacement services (2021–present)\n\n[edit]\n\nOn March 25, 2021, Disney launched Disney Hits, at the time exclusively on SiriusXM. Unlike Radio Disney, Disney Hits only includes music from The Walt Disney Company's productions.[42]\n\nIn August 2022, Disney announced a partnership with Audacy Inc. to launch nine additional Disney-branded audio feeds through the Audacy mobile app, in addition to making Disney Hits available on that platform. The nine channels include jazz, a sing-along channel, decades channels devoted to the 1990s, 2000s and 2010s, a \"Disney Reimagined\" channel, a Spanish language channel, a channel devoted to music from Disney Channel, and an LGBTQ-oriented \"Disney Pride\" channel. The announcement noted that additional Disney channels, including at least one Christmas music channel, would be added later in 2022.[43]\n\nProgramming\n\n[edit]\n\nRadio Disney played a large selection of songs from stars and programs on Disney Channel, along with popular songs from mainstream pop and R&B artists that are found on conventional radio stations. The network aired edited versions of some Top 40 songs (which remove profanity and any other suggestive content, and in most cases replaces it with re-recorded lyrics specifically for the station) to make them appropriate for younger listeners.\n\nList of former programs broadcast by Radio Disney\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Wakey Blakey Show – hosted by Blake Kuhre from 2007-2013, was the longest-running and most successful morning show in Radio Disney history.

Playhouse Disney was originally a two-hour block, but was later reduced to one hour; segments featured in the block included Circle Time Story (originally \"Mickey and Minnie's Storytime Theatre\" from 1998 to 2001), which featured read-along stories from Disney movies. Like the now-defunct Playhouse Disney block (succeeded by Disney Junior) on Disney Channel, it was targeted towards preschoolers. Songs for young children were played along with trivia contests.\n\nSerial radio\n\n[edit]\n\nIn July 2010, Radio Disney debuted its first scripted serial called My Dream, a contemporary story utilizing a format reminiscent of serials from the 1940s. Unlike Depression-era radio serials that typically featured episodes lasting 15 to 30 minutes, episodes of My Dream runs for only 90 seconds and play multiple times throughout the day.[46] My Dream stars Daphne Blunt as a 14-year-old girl trying to make a name for herself in the music industry while dealing with the usual struggles, responsibilities and emotional ups and downs of an everyday teen.[47]\n\nFeatures and contests\n\n[edit]\n\nRadio Disney carried a number of features from interactive contests to informational programs.\n\nFinal features\n\n[edit]\n\nMusic Mailbag – The hour-long Saturday program.

Radio Disney is also a monitored reporter on the Mediabase 24/7 Top 40 panel.[citation needed] The network is headquartered in Burbank, California.\n\nRadio Disney Junior was available via the Watch Disney Junior app in August 2014.[2] On November 4, 2015, Radio Disney Networks launched a country music-focused internet radio station, Radio Disney Country.[49] Disney Channels Worldwide replaced its Watch app series with the singular, DisneyNow, which combines its TV and radio channels the week of September 29, 2017.[50] On November 13, 2014, Radio Disney and Radio Disney Junior became available on Slacker Radio with Radio Disney's Top 30 Countdown starting on November 15, 2014.[51]\n\nRadio Disney Country\n\n[edit]\n\nRadio Disney Country was a country music focused internet radio network that launched on November 4, 2015, and was initially exclusive to Radio Disney's own digital platforms.[49] The service focused upon current songs, current and past material from popular artists, and pop songs featuring country musicians. Guerini explained that the format of the channel was meant to allow it to draw from a wider range of songs than traditional country radio stations, owing to the format's \"embrace\" of rock, hip-hop and pop-oriented songs (with Rolling Stone noting its airplay of Lil Nas X's Western-trap song \"Old Town Road\" in 2019 as an example of this strategy).[52] The network's launch coincided with the 2015 CMA Awards.[49][53] Like its sister station, Radio Disney Country emphasized current hits and used little recurrent rotation.[1]\n\nOn June 9, 2017, Disney announced that it would expand the network's distribution to include other digital platforms, such as iHeartRadio and TuneIn, as well as curated playlists on Apple Music and Spotify, and terrestrial radio with the flip of KDIS to the network as KRDC 99.1 FM and AM 1110 (the main Radio Disney network continued to be carried locally on a subchannel of KRTH until late 2018 when its contract to carry the network expired).[54]\n\nThe station's Let the Girls Play segment premiered on December 5, 2018.[55] In July 2019, Radio Disney Country opened a Nashville Music Row based studio.[56] In July 2019, Disney agreed to license Radio Disney video content to Sheridan Broadcasting Corporation to telestream via a patented process the content to the web and the audio to a radio station, WIGO-AM, as The Radio Disney Hour (working tile).[57]\n\nRadio Disney Country's targeted audience was women aged 18 to 34 years old.[56] The network's mix of music would be every thing with 60% popular artists and 40% up and coming artists.[53] It ceased in the afternoon of December 31, 2020.[6]\n\nRadio Disney Junior\n\n[edit]\n\nOn February 14, 2011, a Radio Disney Junior block was launched in tandem with the Disney Junior on Disney Channel block. The hour long block focused on music for the preschool age plus fun \"audio theater\" with Disney Junior characters.[58]\n\nProgramming\n\n[edit]\n\nMagical World of Disney Junior, Disney and Pixar movies music\n\nPirates & Princesses, themed songs\n\nGet Up and Move, dedicated to health and wellness[51]\n\nStations\n\n[edit]\n\nDespite being music-oriented, the network was carried primarily on AM stations. The Walt Disney Company owned most of the network's affiliates, though some stations were operated through local marketing agreements that had varying degrees of local management. The last separately-owned Radio Disney affiliate, WOLF in Syracuse, New York, left the network on February 1, 2014.\n\nOn August 13, 2014, it was announced that all of Radio Disney's remaining stations, excluding KDIS, were to be sold in an effort to focus more on digital distribution of the Radio Disney network. KDIS would be retained to serve as the originator of Radio Disney's programming, and its operations was assumed by the network's national staff.[2][34] However, Disney later announced that it would syndicate Radio Disney through affiliations with HD Radio subchannels.[37][59]\n\nA gray background indicates a station which was directly operated by the Walt Disney Company.\n\nAM Station FM Station\n\nCity of license / Market Station Years affiliated Current ownership Denver, CO KADZ 1550 1998−2003 Defunct, shut down in 2003 Albuquerque–Santa Fe, NM KALY 1240 2003–2010 KDSK, owned by KD Radio, Inc.

On October 21, 2010, Radio Disney launched in Brazil. From October 1, 2013, to July 28, 2022, Radio Disney was available in Russia via Disney.ru.[84] It plans to broadcast in the Philippines and Sweden in the near future.\n\nLatin America\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Radio Disney Latin America\n\nRadio Disney is available in Latin America via terrestrial broadcast. Similar to Radio Disney in the U.S., it broadcasts in Spanish to Argentina,[85] Bolivia, Chile,[86] Nicaragua,[87] Ecuador,[88] Guatemala, Paraguay,[89] Uruguay,[90] Dominican Republic, Panama, Costa Rica,[91] Mexico,[92][93] Peru[94] and in Portuguese to Brazil.[95] Radio Disney Latin America is a separate operation and won't be affected by the decision to shutter Radio Disney in the United States.[5]\n\nEurope\n\n[edit]\n\nRadio Disney planned to begin broadcasting on the digital radio platform in the United Kingdom by the end of 2008.[96] On July 6, 2007, Ofcom, the communications regulator of the United Kingdom, announced that the 4 Digital Group, a consortium headed by Channel 4 and featuring Emap, UTV, British Sky Broadcasting, Global Radio, Carphone Warehouse and UBC, had been awarded a license to run a new digital radio multiplex which would include Radio Disney as one of ten new national radio stations. On October 10, 2008, Channel 4 withdrew plans to launch 4 Digital, ending the probability of Radio Disney launching on the service.[97]\n\nA similar station, Capital Disney began broadcasting in 2002 on the DAB digital radio network, on Sky Digital (Digital Satellite) and various digital cable television providers in the UK. The station was a joint venture between the UK's Capital Radio Group and Disney. The idea was to use Capital Radio's programming experience to assist Disney in launching a radio station in the UK. In early 2007, both Capital Radio (by now called GCap Media) and Disney agreed to pursue different goals, and as a result, Capital Disney closed down on June 29, 2007.\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nRadio Disney Group\n\nCumulus Media Networks (formerly ABC Radio Networks and Citadel Media)\n\nList of children's radio networks\n\nESPN Radio\n\nNick Radio (a similar radio network launched by Nickelodeon and iHeartMedia in 2013)\n\nTeen pop\n\nBubblegum pop\n\nRock music\n\nHip hop music\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
