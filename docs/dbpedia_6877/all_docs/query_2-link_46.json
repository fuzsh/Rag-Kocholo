        "text": "Attended the launch party of Rockwater Branksome on Saturday (or rockwatervillagepoole on Insta if you want a snoop). Liked these 2 pieces of artwork on the stairs that perfectly demonstrate my 2 hairstyles (how my hairdresser can make it look vs left to do its own thing!) 💇♀️ 😆 Someone I met there asked my opinion on the ‘free everything’ approach to the launch party once he found out my thing was marketing. It’s an interesting one, and while my expertise is firmly B2B not B2C same principles apply. So my answer was… 🤔 Trial- one of the steps in the sales process that can make a big difference - getting to ‘experience’ the product/service before buying. And if the canapés were anything to go buy I’m all in for brekkie/lunch/dinner. Staff were also fab. 📝 Evidence - see note above - literally got to form my own opinion and ask others around me if they liked the place. I did and they did. 😍 Loyalty - this isn’t just a restaurant it’s also a ‘club’ offering membership, so by inviting people to come along now for free it’s easier to ask them to pay as they’ve already been welcomed. Obvs I was a bit more chatty in my reply (it was a Saturday night out so I wasn’t in full ‘work mode’). But it was a good example of how a free trial done well can work. Because I’m still talking about it on Monday (and looking to book to eat soon 🍽️ ).

The brand is Alcohol Free’s official beer of Dry January, with 9m Brits claim to be taking part this year. Working with esteemed photographer Rankin, the ads can be seen throughout London with 6 sheets, cross-track 48 sheets and bus T-sides. Why we love it! Described by the Lucky Saint CMO as ‘fresh consistency’, the campaign reuses distinctive brand-led creative for a second year with tweaked copy, focusing on building a high frequency to embed the brand in people's memory and increase purchase intent as a result. The third year in a row as Dry January's official beer, they’ve evolved the partnership with new touchpoints including a Strava challenge and free pint giveaway to get punters into pubs in January, prompting product trial without the need for product-focused ads. About Media Positive: At Craft Media, we're passionate about strategic comms planning, so much so that we celebrate other agency's amazing work! While we didn't plan this campaign it's a great example of advertising that cuts through. Great job Lucky Saint and the teams that worked on this! #mediapositive #luckysaint #commsplanning\n\nA few last minute tweaks on a delayed late train to Leeds 🚂 for a 20 min pitch tomorrow/today with the team at Asda. I think we’ve got a really great initiative and concept to roll with, spread over a range of our beers so let’s see what tomorrow brings🤞 Whichever way it goes it’s great to just be in the mix but it’s been a really valuable process for me to go through and just focus back in on things from a brand perspective. It’s not just about the beer…it never has been. It was always about giving a little bit of something back and instilling the social cause ethos as part of our brand identity has become more and more important to me recently. But it’s also been really difficult…difficult to focus on that because it’s tough out there - on many different levels and for one reason or another it feels like it’s just been survival mode for longer than I care to remember. Socials might look great…The reality is shit. Really shit. But that’s the perils of running your own business. But I also know that at some point, things will come good and sometimes it’s the bad things that force you to step back, reassess, pivot, go again - whatever it is that you need to do. So fingers crossed there’s something positive that comes out of tomorrow but like I said, if not, it’s great to be in the mix and have a clearer plan now for where we need to go to and let’s see what happens #huglife #beerwithacause #community #everylittlehelps\n\nThe little design firm we founded in 1999, straight out the uni gates, is now 25. Together we’ve gone from green newbies to the guys with less hair but design smarts that only time can buy. We’ve achieved some big wins and survived hairy moments and a certain pandemic. We’ve clocked a helluva lot of hours (70,000-ish!!) together, pushed every design frontier, learnt, grown, evolved. We’ve played witness to each other’s lives as they unfolded, welcoming three beautiful daughters between us and supporting one another through life’s many curveballs. 25 years is epic, but there will be no big birthday party for us this year—we’ve been too busy giving ourselves a facelift. Without further ado, meet the new us. Our name hasn’t changed, but after 25 years, 580 SKUs and 300+ awards, we thought it was high time we raised our hands as the drinks design experts we are. We’re Voice. Drinks Branding and Packaging Design Specialists. It’s good to finally say it out loud. We’ll be taking a few special trips down our drinks memory lane over the coming year. In the meantime, check out our new website for more behind why we decided to narrow our lane. https://voicedesign.net/ Anthony and Scott. #drinksbranding #packagingdesign #wine #spirits #beer #winemarketing #spiritsmarketing #whiskymarketing #whiskeymarketing #beermarketing #craftbeverages\n\nWhen was the last time a business, brand or product created the type of mass hysteria and frenzy currently enjoyed by Buc-ee's, Ltd.? Admittedly, they have brilliantly clever outdoor advertising and a cute mascot, but their meteoric rise is driven largely by a passionate and devoted customer base helping spread the good word. They've harnessed this consumer advocacy to the point that people happily sit in lines extending back down off ramps and onto the interstate in exchange for high-quality products, service and an overall excellent customer experience. It's a proven and powerful recipe--look no further than Chick-fil-A Restaurants, down to the outdoor advertising and mascot--so why don't more companies follow this playbook? I don't have the answer, but here's to Buc-ee's being the next Amazon and not the next Peloton. #branding #marketing #outdooradvertising #PublicRelations #PR\n\n✨ Cracking the Holiday Code with Snyder's Pretzel Cabin! ✨ Snyder's has turned the snack game into a festive fiesta with their Gingerbread Pretzel Cabin Campaign – a genius move that's as delicious as it is brilliant! 🎄🥨 Why is this ad working its magic? 🪄 By infusing humor into their holiday campaign, Snyder's has us all saying, \"Move over, gingerbread; pretzels are the new stars of the season!\" It's a smart way to boost sales in Q4 and establish new family traditions for consumers, making them want to deck the halls with pretzels galore, year after year. Kudos to Snyder's (and the team at Saatchi & Saatchi) for turning an everyday snack into a seasonal sensation! #SnydersMagic #PretzelPerfection #HolidayHumor #creativity #digitalmarketing #marketingcampaigns"
