        "text": "It’s not very often that you come across anything out of the ordinary while in the water, but a human skull was found in a Cape Coral canal.\n\nOne of my favorite things to do is going kayaking. Not only do I go often here in Fort Myers, but wherever I travel, I try to get some kayaking in. Just recently I went to the Bahamas and went kayaking around a reef on Grand Bahama. One of the coolest things I’ve done, and under the water I saw plenty of coral, turtles, fish and other sea life. But imagine going kayaking and coming across a human skull? Could you imagine? Well, that’s exactly what happened for one kayaker in Cape Coral.\n\nHuman Skull Found In Cape Coral Canal\n\nYou may remember back in November, there was a human skull found in a thrift store in North Fort Myers. Now, another one has been found. This time in a Cape Coral canal. According to NBC2, Cape Coral teenager Thomas Sands was out kayaking in NE Cape Coral and came across something very interesting. A human skull. This canal is right at NE 19th Place and Kismet Parkway. I’m sure he was even more surprised to find it as I am hearing about and called the authorities.\n\nI have so many questions. Where did this skull come from? Who does it belong to? Is there a cold case from years ago that could possibly be solved with this discovery? Has there been someone missing that we can finally get answers about? Only time will tell. But it’s a very interesting discovery nonetheless.\n\nAt this point in time, there is no further information. But, the medical examiner now has the skull in their possession and the Cape Coral Police Department will conduct forensic testing.\n\nMarija is a morning show host on WXKB/B1039 and midday host on WRXK/96KRock.
