The Gracie Awards’ Lifetime Achievement Award recognizes a woman whose work in media honors the legacy of Gracie Allen, a pioneering force in the industry and the award’s namesake. Additionally, Emmy Award-winning artist, Rachel Platten, will be performing at the gala, adding to the evening’s celebration. A full list of this year’s winners can be found here.\n\n“Carol Burnett is a true icon of television and entertainment, whose impact spans decades and resonates with audiences of all ages. Her groundbreaking work on ‘The Carol Burnett Show’ set a standard for excellence in comedy and storytelling, earning her countless awards and accolades,” said Becky Brooks, president of the AWMF. “We are truly privileged to recognize her outstanding contributions to the industry and celebrate her remarkable career at the Gracie Awards Gala, where the talented Rachel Platten will also be inspiring us with a special performance with her unforgettable female anthems.”\n\nBurnett, an award-winning actress and bestselling author, is widely recognized by the public and her peers for her work for her comedic and dramatic roles on television, film, and Broadway, most notably “The Carol Burnett Show.” Named in 2007 by TIME as one of 100 Best Television Shows of All Time, “The Carol Burnett Show” ran for 11 years, averaged 30 million viewers per week, and received 25 Emmy Awards, making it one of the most honored shows in television history. It was recently announced that NBC’s “Carol Burnett: 90 Years of Laughter + Love” will receive a Gracie Award for Special or Variety (TV, national).\n\nAs a highly acclaimed actress, she has been honored with Emmys, Golden Globes, People’s Choice Awards, the Horatio Alger Award, an ACE Award, the Peabody, and a Grammy. A Kennedy Center Honoree, the recipient of the Kennedy Center Mark Twain Prize for Humor and the Presidential Medal of Freedom; was inducted into the Television Hall of Fame, and has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The City of Los Angeles named the intersection of Highland Avenue and Selma directly adjacent to Hollywood High School, Burnett’s alma mater, Carol Burnett Square and CBS Studios dedicated “The Carol Burnett Artist Entrance” in her honor. Burnett was celebrated by her colleagues and fellow actors with the Life Achievement honors at the 2016 SAG Awards. In 2019, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association created The Carol Burnett Award which is an honorary Golden Globe to celebrate outstanding contributions to television on or off the screen. Burnett was the first recipient in its inauguration, followed by Ellen DeGeneres this year.\n\nCurrently, Carol is in a new series for Apple TV that premiered this past March 20th entitled, “Palm Royal.” The setting for the comedy is 1969 Palm Beach, Florida and its high society life of inclusion vs. exclusion. Carol plays the matriarch in that world. Cast includes Kristin Wiig, Allyson Janney, Laura Dern, Ricky Martin, Josh Lucas.\n\nPlatten catapulted to fame with her anthem “Fight Song,” a global sensation that has left an indelible mark on modern culture with over billions of streams. Beyond her chart-topping success, Rachel’s journey as a mother of two and a multifaceted artist continues to evolve, as she tours the world and prepares to release a new album in Fall 2024. Her first track, “Girls,” from her forthcoming album is already topping the charts. With her upcoming release, Rachel aims to deepen her connection with audiences by exploring themes of honesty in her personal struggles, and the art of healing thru her heartfelt songwriting.\n\nThe Gracie Awards Gala is fundamentally rooted in supporting AWMF’s charitable endeavors. As a non-profit organization, AWMF is committed to developing educational programs, charitable activities, and scholarship initiatives that directly benefit women in the media. Through these investments, AWMF remains steadfast in its mission to cultivate growth, empowerment, and leadership opportunities for women throughout the industry.\n\nHenry Dry Goods confirmed to create custom Gracies Gift Bag with included gifts.

(May 23, 2023) – The48th Annual Gracie Awards, presented by the Alliance for Women in Media Foundation (AWMF), illuminated the night with an extraordinary celebration of women in media held at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel. The evening honored the exceptional talent that have left an indelible mark on the industry, inspiring audiences, and revolutionizing storytelling.\n\nInside the gala, a powerful atmosphere prevailed, showcasing stories of triumph, civil rights activists, and women who are actively shifting culture through their narratives. The winners of this year’s Gracie Awards embody the spirit and courage exemplified by Gracie Allen, and they serve as a reminder of the invaluable contributions women make in shaping our media landscape.\n\nMarlo Thomas, renowned for her groundbreaking role as television’s first independent single woman in “That Girl” and revered as a Founding Mother of the Ms. Foundation for Women, was honored with the distinguished Lifetime Achievement Award. Tony Thomas, brother of Marlo and an Academy Award nominated television and film producer, presented the award to her.\n\nAdditional presenters and attendees included influential figures such as Atsuko Okatsuka, Jodi Balfour, Bishop Briggs, Keltie Knight, Kerri Kasem, Ellen K, Hallie Sahar, Harriet Dyer, Julie Carmen, Lily Moore, Rose McIver, Terri J. Vaughn, Chelsea Gilligan, Sharon Carpenter, and Medalion Rahimi. A special musical performance by 14-time Oscar nominee Diane Warren and Shayna Zaid, enthralled the audience, reminding everyone of the power of music in storytelling. EXTRA’s correspondent, Rachel Lindsay, served as the Gracie Awards social media ambassador, and the ceremony was executive produced by Vicangelo Bulluck.\n\nThis year’s Gracies Awards also shined a spotlight on the incredible achievements of women directors and writers. Their talent and dedication were celebrated, emphasizing the critical roles they play in shaping the cultural landscape through their storytelling.\n\nNOTABLE MOMENTS\n\nMarlo Thomas during her lifetime award acceptance speech said: “All of these memories are nutrition for the soul. And events like this one created by women and recognizing women are our nutrition. You see examples of others who are finding their voices. We hear their dreams and share their stories. They give us life.They give us enthusiasm that we can continue to make new dreams.”\n\nMiranda Kwok (The Cleaning Lady), winner of the Writer Scripted – Drama category, said: “I stand here in solidarity with my fellow writers as we fight for fair treatment and compensation and the simple recognition that the soul of a writer cannot be replaced with Artificial Intelligence. As writers, our goal is to enlighten and inspire, to reach hearts and minds, to build compassion and understanding, and to effect change for the betterment of humanity.”\n\nPresenter Rachel Lindsay introduced the women directors moment with a powerful tribute, recognizing their vital role in shaping on-screen stories following an unprecedented number of submissions saying, “An interesting fact, most people don’t know that women directors were vital to the beginning of cinematic storytelling. But when movies became big business in the 1920’s, the male dominated studio system created monopolies that pushed out female and minority led independent film companies.”\n\nMichelle Miller (48 Hours: “Katrina Brownlee: The Good Cop”), News Magazine [TV – National] category, said: “I want you to know I’m not old enough to remember Gracie Allen, but I am old enough to remember her husband, George Burns. I remember him telling stories of this incredible woman, his late wife, adoring stories, but also kind of mischievous ones. And I thought she’s been dead 20 years, and yet he still talks about her like she’s here in this moment. She had to be one heck of a fine lady. One heck of a fine lady. One heck of an extraordinary lady…”\n\nAt its core, the Gracie Awards Gala supports AWMF’s charitable efforts.

The Gracies Lifetime Achievement Award honors a woman in media who exemplifies and embodies the essence of the late, great media trailblazer Gracie Allen, the namesake of the Gracie Awards.\n\n“Marlo Thomas is not only a true icon of the entertainment industry, but a visionary whose work has left a lasting impact on society,” said Becky Brooks, President of the AWMF. “Her groundbreaking role as Ann Marie in ‘That Girl’ shattered stereotypes and opened doors for women in television. Furthermore, Marlo’s charitable and activist work with the Ms. Foundation for Women and St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital has transformed countless lives, making her a beacon of hope and inspiration to us all. She truly exemplifies the ethos of AWMF. We’re proud to honor her with this year’s Lifetime Achievement Award.”\n\nThomas is an award-winning actress, author and activist whose body of work continues to impact American entertainment and culture. She has been honored with four Emmy Awards, the Peabody, a Golden Globe and a Grammy, and has been inducted into the Broadcasting Hall of Fame. In November 2014, she was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom—the highest honor a civilian can receive—by President Barack Obama at a White House ceremony.\n\nShe burst onto the scene as television’s That Girl, which broke new ground for independent women everywhere, and which she also conceived and produced. Her pioneering spirit continued with her creation of the children’s entertainment project, Free to Be…You and Me, which became a platinum album, best-selling book, Emmy Award-winning television special and a stage show. In March of 2021, the original recordwas entered into the National Recording Registry of the Library of Congress to underscore its cultural significance. Proceeds from Free to Be…You and Me went toward the formation of the Ms. Foundation for Women, which was co-founded by Marlo, Gloria Steinem, Letty Cottin Pogrebin and Pat Carbine. They also created Take Our Daughters to Work Day.\n\nHer body of work on television has consistently won her both popular and critical acclaim. In the 2022 holiday season, she co-starred in Hallmark’s A Magical Christmas Village (her first holiday movie since her classic It Happened One Christmas). Additionally, she has lent comedic turns to the Netflix miniseries Wet Hot American Summer:Ten Years Later and Warner Brothers’ Ocean’s 8. Other notable television appearances include her portrayal of a mentally ill woman in Nobody’s Child, for which she won the Emmy for Best Dramatic Actress, and numerous guest appearances on popular series, including Friends, in which she was nominated for an Emmy for her portrayal of Jennifer Aniston’s mom. She has won glowing reviews on stage, most recently in Elaine May’s 2012 Broadway comedy-drama, Relatively Speaking; and in Tony Award-winning playwright Joe DiPietro’s 2015 dark comedy, Clever Little Lies.\n\nFor her activism, Thomas has been honored with the Helen Caldicott Award for Nuclear Disarmament; the ACLU’s Thomas Paine Award; the American Women in Radio and Television Satellite Award; the William Kunstler Racial Justice Award; The National Civil Rights Museum Freedom Award; and The Jefferson Award for Public Service, which she received along with Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.\n\nAt its core, the Gracie Awards Gala supports AWMF’s charitable efforts.
