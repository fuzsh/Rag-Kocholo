        "text": "When you see something cute, you want to take a pic and Florida drivers have been trying to take selfies with a depressed black bear.\n\nI’m the biggest animal lover ever, so I get it. Though even I know when to draw the line. When I see any kind of wildlife, the first thought that comes to mind is that I want to snuggle it. I’m talking raccoons especially, but I can’t help but melt a little bit when I see cute squirrels, possums and even larger creatures like panthers and bears. But the realist in me knows that snuggling these wild animals probably won’t end well. And I’m sure these Florida drivers think the same, but in this case thought “but a selfie is ok, right?”\n\nFlorida Drivers Trying To Take Selfies With Depressed Black Bear\n\nWe live in a world now where we take pictures of and with anything. All the time we hear of these influencers or wanna-be internet stars taking pictures that land them in serious trouble, either with the law or with severe injuries. In this case, it seemed innocent enough that Florida drivers were trying to take selfies with a depressed black bear.\n\nAccording to the Walton County Sheriff’s Office Facebook page, the black bear was spotted on Highway 98 near County Round in Santa Rosa Beach. And the reason for the selfies is that this bear looked a little down on his luck. So maybe they thought taking pics to post on the internet would cheer him up? Wonder what happened? Did he get lost? Lose his pot of honey? Stressed out? Ahh..to get inside the head of a black bear.\n\nWhile selfies from afar may be ok, the sheriff’s office is reminding everyone to NOT approach black bears at any time. Yes, they may be cute, but they also might be aggressive, and I’m pretty sure none of us want to experience what that may be like.\n\nAnyone who sees a bear is asked to contact FWC’s Wildlife Hotline at 888-404-3922.\n\nMarija is a morning show host on WXKB/B1039 and midday host on WRXK/96KRock.
