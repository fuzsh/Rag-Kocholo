Review

Digital Fortress is my first step into the mind and works of Dan Brown.

Was I impressed? Most certainly.

This was the author’s debut. I’m late to the party I know but better late than never.

What we get is a very good story of deception and intrigue based around the release of a piece of code which has been introduced into a top secret code-breaking machine designed to crack any code.. but it can’t crack this one.. it’s stuck.

Susan Fletcher is caught up in the all mess when she notices the machine has been working on cracking the code way longer than it should. Susan’s partner is also sucked into this mess when he is sent off to find the code that will kill the program.

There’s some very good twists to this plot in my opinion. I always felt I had an idea of what was happening until the author throws in a spanner to twist the tale in another direction. You never quite know who is behind everything until the end.

Honestly within the first few chapters I made assumptions on how the plot would develop.. How wrong was I? Very..

Pleasantly surprised indeed. I tend to read more self-published/ Indie authors so this was a break to my norm but it was well worth reading and I’ll make sure to follow up on the authors subsequent books.
