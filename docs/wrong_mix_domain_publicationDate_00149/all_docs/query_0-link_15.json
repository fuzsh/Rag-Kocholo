        "text": "American science fiction author (1923–2020)\n\nFor other uses, see James Gunn (disambiguation).\n\nJames Edwin Gunn (July 12, 1923 – December 23, 2020) was an American science fiction writer, editor, scholar, and anthologist. His work as an editor of anthologies includes the six-volume Road to Science Fiction series. He won the Hugo Award for \"Best Related Work\" in 1983 and he won or was nominated for several other awards for his non-fiction works in the field of science fiction studies.[3] The Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America made him its 24th Grand Master in 2007,[4] and he was inducted by the Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame in 2015.[5][6] His novel The Immortals was adapted into a 1970–71 TV series starring Christopher George.[2]\n\nGunn was a professor emeritus of English and the founding director of the Center for the Study of Science Fiction, both at the University of Kansas.[7][8]\n\nEarly life, family and education\n\n[edit]\n\nGunn was born in Kansas City, Missouri,[9] on July 12, 1923 to Jesse and Elsie Mae (née Hutchison) Gunn. He came from a publishing family: his father was a printer, two uncles were pressmen, another uncle was a proofreader, and his grandfather was a newspaper editor. His grandfather, Benjamin Gunn, appeared in Ripley's Believe it or Not. As a Masonic representative, he had visited every county in every state in the country and could name them all, including where he had spent the night.\n\nGunn served for three years in the U.S. Navy during World War II[9] but never saw combat. With several months of Japanese language training and a few hours spent learning to fly an airplane, he was sent to Truk Island, now known as Chuuk Lagoon, to be adjutant to the commanding officer. He then attended the University of Kansas, earning a Bachelor of Science in Journalism in 1947 and a Masters of Arts in English from Northwestern University in 1951.[10]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nBy 1958, Gunn was managing editor of University of Kansas Alumni Publications.[10] He became a faculty member of the university, where he served as the director of public relations and as a Professor of English, specializing in science fiction and fiction writing. He was a professor emeritus and founding director of the original Center for the Study of Science Fiction,[11] which awarded the annual John W. Campbell Memorial Award for best novel and the Theodore Sturgeon Memorial Award for best short fiction.\n\nHe served as President of the Science Fiction Writers of America[12] from 1971–72 and was President of the Science Fiction Research Association from 1980–82. SFWA honored him as a Grand Master of Science Fiction in 2007.[13]\n\nOn June 12, 2015, Locus announced the selection of Gunn and four others for induction into the Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame, along with \"a 'lightning-fast' fundraiser to cover [Gunn's] travel expenses so he can attend the June 27, 2015 induction ceremony in Seattle\".[5][6]\n\nWriting\n\n[edit]\n\nGunn became a professional writer in 1947 when he wrote a play produced by the University of Kansas, Thy Kingdom Come, then wrote newspaper articles and radio scripts.[10] Although he considered moving to New York to become a playwright, he began his career as a science fiction writer in 1949, making his first short story sale to Thrilling Wonder Stories.[13] He has had nearly 100 stories published in magazines and anthologies and has written 28 books and edited 10. Many of his stories and books have been reprinted around the world.[8]\n\nIn 1948, Gunn wrote his first science fiction, ten short stories, and published nine from 1949 to 1952 as \"Edwin James\", a pseudonym derived from his full name James Edwin Gunn.[10][8] The first two in print, \"Communications\" and \"Paradox\" (the first sale), were published in September and October 1949 by editor Sam Merwin in Startling Stories and Thrilling Wonder Stories respectively.[1] Gunn's master's thesis, a critical analysis of the genre, was also published in a professional magazine.[10] His novels were first published by Gnome Press in 1955, Star Bridge, written by Gunn and Jack Williamson, and This Fortress World.[1]\n\nScribner's published Gunn's novel The Listeners in 1972[14] and it was runner-up for the first annual John W. Campbell Memorial Award for Best Science Fiction Novel.[3] Carl Sagan called it \"one of the very best fictional portrayals of contact with extraterrestrial intelligence ever written.\"[citation needed] According to the publisher of a 2004 edition, \"this book predicted and inspired the creation of the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI)—the organization dedicated to the search for extraterrestrial life.\"[15]\n\nIn 1996, Gunn wrote a Star Trek novel that was a novelization of \"The Joy Machine\", an unproduced episode of the first Star Trek series that was scripted by Theodore Sturgeon.[16][citation needed][clarification needed]\n\nPersonal life and death\n\n[edit]\n\nGunn married Jane Frances Anderson on February 6, 1947, at Danforth Chapel in Lawrence, Kansas. They had two sons, Christopher, born in 1949, and Kevin, born in 1954. Christopher died on St. Patrick's Day, 2005. Jane died September 27, 2012. Kevin is still living.[9][when?]\n\nGunn died in Lawrence, Kansas, on the morning of December 23, 2020, at age 97[17] of natural causes after a brief hospitalization.[9]\n\nAdaptations\n\n[edit]\n\nHis stories also have been adapted into radio plays and teleplays.\n\nNBC Radio's X Minus One – \"Cave of Night\", February 1, 1956; \"Wherever You May Be\", June 26, 1956\n\nDesilu Playhouse's 1959 \"Man in Orbit\", based on Gunn's \"The Cave of Night\"\n\nABC-TV's Movie of the Week \"The Immortal\" (1969) and an hour-long television series The Immortal in 1970, based on Gunn's The Immortals[8]\n\n\"Psychodynamics of the Witchcraft\", an episode of the USSR science fiction TV series This Fantastic World (filmed in 1989) was based on Gunn's 1953 story \"Wherever You May Be\".[18]\n\nMystery drama If the bride is a witch (Russia, 2002) was based on \"Wherever You May Be\".\n\nBibliography\n\n[edit]\n\nA more-complete bibliography of Gunn's works is available on Christopher McKitterick's site[19] (maintained since 1992; McKitterick worked closely with Gunn and his SF center from 1992 until his death in 2020, and wrote extensively on Gunn, his original Center for the Study of Science Fiction, and his work).\n\nNovels\n\n[edit]\n\nStar Bridge, Gunn and Jack Williamson (Gnome Press, 1955)\n\nThis Fortress World (Gnome, 1955)\n\nThe Joy Makers (Bantam, 1961)\n\nThe Immortals (Bantam, 1962), which was adapted for an ABC Movie of the Week in the fall of 1969 and turned into an ironically short-lived TV series in 1970.\n\nThe Listeners (Scribner's, 1972), stories[14][15] – October 1972 collection of six novelettes, five previously published (September 1968 to September 1972); \"The 'Computer Run's between each story average 8 pages long\"[20]\n\nThe Magicians (Scribner's, 1976) – expanded from a novella, \"Sine of the Magus\" (Beyond Fantasy Fiction, May 1954)[1]\n\nKampus (Bantam, 1977)\n\nThe Dreamers (Simon & Schuster, 1981)\n\nCrisis!
