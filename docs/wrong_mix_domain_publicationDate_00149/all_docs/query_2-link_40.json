Once I got used to the reader's voices and got through the first part I was hooked. I think it would be better if you could rewind a bit or fast forward a bit if you wanted to, but putting that aside the reader actually sounded like Ray Milland when he did his British accent which I quite liked actually. The story was sort of predictable with some surprises at the end but not really in the same class as either Angels and Demons or The DaVinci Code so as long as you don't expect that kind of writing you wont be disappointed. A good read but not worth so much money - it should have been way cheaper as it certainly doesn't deserve the price that it costs and I probably would have given it a higher rating if it had been cheaper. But I did like it and really like listening to books on my Ipod.\n\nDan is on a Roll\n\nFrom this book began a string of books that lay the foundation of sequels and masterful writings that I have ever read by this gentle soul! This book cannot be explained - it must be listen to as the reader is soo good! Danger, intrigue, love, sex and deception - all in a book! It is amazing what the pen can do!\n\nI loved this book and Dan once again is a master of the written word! A must read - even better when it is listened to! A most exciting and delicious book!"
