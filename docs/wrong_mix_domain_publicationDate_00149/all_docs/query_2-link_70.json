        "text": "Title – Digital Fortress\n\nAuthor – Dan Brown\n\nGenre – Thriller\n\nLength – 512 Pages\n\nPublication – July 2004\n\nMy Rating – 5/5 Stars\n\nSynopsis\n\nWhen the NSA’s invincible code-breaking machine – encounters a mysterious code it cannot break, the agency calls in its head cryptographer, Susan Fletcher, a brilliant and beautiful mathematician. What she uncovers sends shock waves through the corridors of power. The NSA is being held hostage…not by guns or bombs, but by a code so ingeniously complex that if released it will cripple U.S. intelligence.\n\nReview\n\nDigital Fortress is my first step into the mind and works of Dan Brown.\n\nWas I impressed? Most certainly.\n\nThis was the author’s debut. I’m late to the party I know but better late than never.\n\nWhat we get is a very good story of deception and intrigue based around the release of a piece of code which has been introduced into a top secret code-breaking machine designed to crack any code.. but it can’t crack this one.. it’s stuck.\n\nSusan Fletcher is caught up in the all mess when she notices the machine has been working on cracking the code way longer than it should. Susan’s partner is also sucked into this mess when he is sent off to find the code that will kill the program.\n\nThere’s some very good twists to this plot in my opinion. I always felt I had an idea of what was happening until the author throws in a spanner to twist the tale in another direction. You never quite know who is behind everything until the end.\n\nHonestly within the first few chapters I made assumptions on how the plot would develop.. How wrong was I? Very..\n\nPleasantly surprised indeed. I tend to read more self-published/ Indie authors so this was a break to my norm but it was well worth reading and I’ll make sure to follow up on the authors subsequent books."
