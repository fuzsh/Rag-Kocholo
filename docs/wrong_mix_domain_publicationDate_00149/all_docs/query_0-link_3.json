He watches over us. He ain't the God who share's his bread ans save us from calamity but the God who steals our digital cookies and sells us bread online. \n.\nThis happens to be the first book I have read in life. I cherished walking this alley. Thanks to Dan Brown who pulled me with his mysterious strings held me with his nerve tingling plots. \n.\nThe book revolves around Narional Security Agency's(NSA) digital decoder TRANSLTR which spies over the internet gets it's first unbreakable code along with a threat from an individual who supposedly knows how TRANSLTR works and it can't break his code. He threatens the NSA to reveal TRANSLTR to public in return to keep him from auctioning the unbreakable code's algorithm online to let everyone use it for free. The plot then moves gets racy with the characters pulling their moves to tackle the Nation's threat. \n.\nThe tech flavour has been garnished over the plot with a gripping path of twists and turns in the story. I couldn't help myself but awe at ending which made me read twice. thrice to digest the f had just happened. The book has got the usual Dan Brown magic of thrilling finds which will keep us in the edge of seat. \n.\nFavourite line from the book: \n \"Force a hand, and it will fight you. But convince and mind to think as you want it to think, an you have an ally\"\n .\n .\n .\n .\n .\n .\n .\n .\n .\n .\n #book #bookstagram #booklover #books #reading #read #bookworm #bookaddict #instabook #bookstagrammer #booknerd #bookish #bookphotography #bookshelf #reader #booklove #bookaholic #booksofinstagram #bibliophile #booklovers #readersofinstagram #bookblogger #igbooks #bookrecommendations #library #bookcommunity #readersofinstagram #bookishaesthetic #fiction #danbrown\".",
