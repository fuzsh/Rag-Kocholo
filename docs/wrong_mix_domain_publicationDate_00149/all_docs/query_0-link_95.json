After that I read classics, young adult novels, and science fiction books. Gradually over the years, my interests shifted from fiction to non-fiction.\n\nThis is an attempt to keep a log of the books I've read over the years.\n\nThis page is heavily inspired by Patrick Collison's Bookshelf and other similar reading lists by Aaron Swartz, Tiger Shen and Bill Gates. The data behind this page is from Goodreads, without which creating this page would not have been possible.\n\nOver time, this page will (hopefully) be more detailed – where I not only list down the books I've read – but also write about the learnings from them."
