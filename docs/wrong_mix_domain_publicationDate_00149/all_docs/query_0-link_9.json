Jeffrey Archer! Have read all of his books except the prison series and the 2005 one - False Impression. My favourite Archer book has to be a toss up between Kane and Abel and First among Equals.\n\nviralbug\n\ntR0ll bUg\n\nMessages\n\n2,759\n\nLocation\n\nNA\n\nISP\n\nMTNL Triband 1333 2mbps night 1mbps day\n\nAug 26, 2007\n\n#6\n\ndont read actually, but did like dan brown a lot.\n\ngregory house\n\nphilosopher-in-chief\n\nMessages\n\n1,855\n\nLocation\n\nNA\n\nISP\n\nReliance Dialup\n\nAug 26, 2007\n\n#7\n\nWhich Dan Brown book?

The Foundation Series is awesome; all his books have very believable future tech, that's one of the best things about them.\n\nYou feel something he's explained will be invented in the next few years, or can be done already\n\nAnybody looking for a good and long fantasy read can try A Song of Ice, Wind and Fire (series still being written, 4 books out) by G.R.R. Martin.\n\nSpeaking of fantasy, J.R.R. Tolkien isn't on the initial list? The Nazguls are coming for you..."
