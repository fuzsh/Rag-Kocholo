The NSA is being held hostage - not by guns or bombs, but by a code so complex that if released would cripple U.S. intelligence.\n\nCaught in an accelerating tempest of secrecy and lies, Fletcher battles to save the agency she believes in. Betrayed on all sides, she finds herself fighting not only for her country but for her life, and in the end, for the life of the man she loves...\n\nEngaged me instantly...keeps up a cracking pace as the mystery deepens and disaster follows disasterFast paced with plenty of twists and turns...the reader remains gripped, trying to guess where its going next...one of the best thrillers on the bookstands.
