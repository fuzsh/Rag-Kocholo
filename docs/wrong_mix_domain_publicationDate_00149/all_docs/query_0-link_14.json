        "text": "#Celebrate Sci-Fi Day\n\nDo you like exploring strange new worlds with your favorite away team? Do you dress up as one of those space wizards with laser swords from a galaxy far, far away? Do you like time travel, alternate universes, steampunk, AI, and robots?\n\nNational Science Fiction Day is celebrated (unofficially) every January 2 by fans across the U.S. The date, of course, corresponds with the birthdate of writer Isaac Asimov - considered one of the \"Big Three\" science fiction writers, along with Robert A. Heinlein and Arthur C. Clarke.\n\nIf you're looking for your next escape into fantastical, futuristic worlds filled with advanced technology, we've got some great recommendations to get you started! You might even find a few options that work for the 2024 Jax Stacks Reading Challenge for adults. Why not go ahead and cross \"A sci-fi or alternate history book set in Asia\" off your list early?\n\nBooks for Children\n\nTeen Reads\n\nRecommendations for Adults"
