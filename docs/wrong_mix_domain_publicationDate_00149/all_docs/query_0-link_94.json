Then how come he and Ryan and Alok roamed about in Ryan's Kinetic?\n\nI know! I know! this is a work of fiction, but just a thought. What say?\n\nTeam-BHP Support\n\nJoin Date: Feb 2005\n\nLocation: San Jose, CA\n\nPosts: 23,724\n\nThanked: 22,938 Times\n\nIt does, but still students keep bikes. When there is a raid they have to pay fine, but mostly people who are on good terms with security get to know of the raids in advance and temporarily take the bikes outside\n\nBHPian\n\nJoin Date: Feb 2006\n\nLocation: pune\n\nPosts: 41\n\nThanked: 3 Times\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by v1p3r\n\nAnything by Forsyth, Archer, Grisham. I love Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged, both very powerful. I know all the Sherlock Holmes series by heart. Pretty much similar with the Potter books. Wodehouse is a favourite, though I've never read too much. I worship Isaac Asimov, and I've read nearly everything he wrote, except the Black Widow series. Like reading JC's collections of writings. Dan Brown is also an interesting read. Archie comics are always fun.\n\nayn rand and forsyth are the people i personally started my \"serious\" reading with and surprisingly it wasnt the usual forsyth i read .......v1p3r if you liked atlas shrugged and fountainhead have you read \"the pillars of the earth and/or a place called freedom by ken follet ???? those are must reads for an ayn rand fan !\n\ntry em out and lemme know ...!\n\nLast edited by stararmour : 2nd March 2006 at 23:29.\n\nBHPian\n\nJoin Date: Sep 2005\n\nLocation: BLR / Lucknow\n\nPosts: 595\n\nThanked: 834 Times\n\nMy top 5 would be:\n\n1. In Search of Schrodinger's Cat - by John Gribbin. The most IMPORTANT book I have read in my life. Makes you wonder if the entire universe is 'maya' after all. Wonderfully, it does so through quantum physics!\n\n2. The Foundation Series - by Issac Asimov. It is a series of 7 books. If you are about to try it, read it in the order it was written (and not in the order of events in the story). To classify it under science fiction would be a shame. It is more about sociology and cultural change. Most importantly, it makes our endeavours seem of little consequence in view of the infinity of time.\n\n3. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy/The Restaurant at the end of the Universe - by Douglas Adams. Totally oulandish.\n\n4. Pre-foundation novels by Issac Asimov (from 'The Caves of Steel' to 'Pebble in the Sky')\n\n5.Julius Caesar/Hamlet by William Shakespere - amazing atmosphere\n\nBHPian\n\nJoin Date: Feb 2006\n\nLocation: pune\n\nPosts: 41\n\nThanked: 3 Times\n\nmy favourite books would have to be\n\n1..the lord of the rings ( i can read that book cover to cover and then cover to cover again !!! )\n\n2..next would probably be richard bach's livingston seagull and the alchemist by paul coelho\n\n3..hmmmm lets see in third comes the ayn rands fountainhead and ken follet's place called freedom and pillars of the earth (though both need a second read it's been years !)\n\n4..of course all wodehouse (keeps me falling off my bed !!!)\n\n5..and not to forget all of harry potter i love em ! wish i could live in such a crazy world !\n\nthis is actually very unfair cos i love every book i read ( well almost) from isaac asimov to eric van lustbader to stephen king even the \"eragon\" series ..... !!!"
