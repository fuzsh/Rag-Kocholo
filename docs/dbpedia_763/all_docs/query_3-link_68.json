        "text": "The present study places the analysis of mass media in Cuba, the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico within a continuous process of transition and transformation towards democratization, interlocked to current international forces of neoliberal-globalized financial and economic structures and the cultural transformations this entails. As the three islands approached the end of 21st century second decade, Antonio Benitez Rojo's Plantation culture-repeating island system of thought allows for understanding of the course taken by mass media industries within each island context, as well as that of Caribbean neoliberalism. Since 1990 Cuba has been undergoing a continuous transition-like state, of an authoritarian socialist-state in a process of re-articulating socialism in the new international neoliberal context, with no provisions for a market economy or pluralization within the society. The International Monetary Fund finds the Dominican Republic a regional star growth performer with averaged unemployment rate of 15.40%, as well as and eroding rule of-law. Puerto Rico finds itself trapped as “[…] a territory appurtenant and belonging to the United States, but not a part of the United States within the revenue clauses of the Constitution […]”, ruled since June 30 2016 by a Financial Oversight and Management Board whose supremacy “reaches over any general or specific provisions of territory law, State law, or regulation that is inconsistent with [the Board]”, and is plagued by corruption and an unpayable government debt.\n\nThis book presents the analysis of the journalistic culture of Ecuador as representative of the Andean region and Latin America. Since the last two decades of the twentieth century, a steady increase in research in journalism has focused on the analysis of the journalist and their products – contents. However, it is only relatively recently that it has also taken into account the context in which the environment and the various systems – political, economic, social, cultural, media, technological, etc. – surrounding the journalists and the media are present. This decontextualized perspective has been, and is being, much criticised for being reductionist, partial and homogeneous. For these reasons, and for others which will be discussed throughout the book, this study includes the work of journalists, their perceptions and their professional practices as integrated activities in a characteristic context and with a unique idiosyncrasy. Based on this idea, it attempts to show a vision, as closely as possible, of the journalistic culture of Ecuador and the professionals who are immersed in it. To this end, from a multilevel analysis, we analyse the dimensions of 1) self-perception of the professional role, 2) idea of objectivity, 3) ethical guidance, 4) perception of autonomy, 5) trust level in institutions, and 6) assessment of the influencing factors. The study is based on theoretical foundations, in order to subsequently focus on the “operationalizing” – how to empirically measure the theoretical proposals – and the “empirical conceptualisation” – how to theoretically explain the practices and standards – of the journalistic culture of Ecuador. The book is structured in three parts. In the first of them (chapters I and II) the concept of Journalistic Cultures and its implications to the communication and studies in the area is developed and an approach to the concept and the reality of the journalistic culture characteristic of Latin America as a region is carried out. The second part of the work (chapters III to VI) begins with the location and contextualization of our object of study, the journalistic and communicative reality of Ecuador. Not only some of the great features that define the journalistic culture of the Andean country, but also the media system in which it is encompassed and its implications for our subject of study are analysed on these pages. In this regard, it is important to mention the new Ecuadorian law (Law of Communication, June 25, 2013), since it has come to change the communication system of the country and its relationship with both the political power and the society itself. These chapters also develop two of the current debates in Ecuador: the professionalization process on which journalism has been embarked and the proposal to incorporate communication as a public service. This theoretical basis will allow the reader to reach the third part of the book (chapters VII to XIII) with sufficient conceptualizations and context management to delve into each of the dimensions of the journalistic culture addressed. After a methodological and conceptual framework explanation of this Journalistic Cultures of Ecuador project, the results of the same are thoroughly analysed in each of the following chapters. Thus, the project addresses the main factors that Ecuadorian journalists perceive to be the most influential in their daily work and the performance of the functions of the media in which they work; the perception that they have of the roles and functions that their profession meets today; ethical guidelines that lead their profession; the degree of autonomy with which they feel they develop journalism in Ecuador and the level of trust that the various public and private institutions in Ecuador deserve, analysed in relation to public (dis)trust in these institutions."
