        "text": "He was an illegal immigrant making a living picking tomatoes.\n\nNow Alfredo Quiñones-Hinojosa excels in a different field\n\nas a top brain surgeon\n\nHopping the Fence\n\nThe hot sun seared his skin as Alfredo Quiñones-Hinojosa bent in the field to pick tomatoes. It was work few Americans would do for just $155 a week, and most of his co-workers on this 10,000-acre farm in central California were, like Quiñones, illegal Mexican immigrants. It was a grim existence: He lived in a decrepit truck camper -- without the truck -- in the middle of a field.\n\nOne day the farm owner's son came by. \"He looked at us like we were less than dirt,\" recalls Quiñones. Other workers were only too happy to be disdained by wealthy Americans who could have them deported, but not Quiñones. He carried an English dictionary in his pocket and studied it every day. He was studying to become an American.\n\nIt had been a year since Quiñones jumped the fence in Calexico. His cousin was supposed to be waiting for him on the American side. Instead he was met by the U.S. Border Patrol. Half an hour later, Quiñones was back in Mexico .\n\nFiguring the border police would never expect the same guy to cross in the same spot on the same night, he went over the fence again. This time, his cousin was there. Quiñones hopped in his car, and the two roared off into the night toward El Centro . It was January 2, 1987, Quiñones's 19th birthday.\n\nThe oldest of Sostenes Quiñones and Flavia Hinojosa's five children, Alfredo began work at age five, pumping gas at his father's Pemex station, where the family also lived, on a dusty road 37 miles south of the border town of Mexicali. It was hard work, but Quiñones didn't mind. He also got to drive the cars now and then, perching on a stack of pillows.\n\nBy Mexican standards, the Quiñones family was almost middle-class. But in 1976 the Mexican government devalued the peso, throwing the country into turmoil. \"We lost everything, just like that,\" Quiñones says with a snap of his fingers. \"I remember going to the back of the house to find my father crying.\"\n\nSostenes turned to his brothers, who were working in the United States as migrant farmworkers. They supplied the family with sacks of potatoes and beans. Quiñones helped bring in extra money by working at a taco stand.\n\nStill, he kept up with school. \"My father kept telling me, 'You want to be like me? Just never go to school.' And I was not going to follow the same path.\" At age 14, Quiñones qualified for an accelerated program in Mexicali that prepared students for jobs as elementary school teachers. Each morning, he rose at 4:30 to take a bus to the school. There was no bus home in the afternoon, so he hitchhiked -- or walked -- in the blistering heat.\n\nHe graduated near the top of his class. But because his family had no political connections, he says, he was assigned a teaching job at a remote school far down the Baja peninsula. \"I wasn't willing to put up with that injustice,\" he says.\n\nShortly after, he decided to leave Mexico in search of better options. He had been to America twice before, doing summer labor. So on his arrival, Quiñones headed with his cousin for the San Joaquin Valley to work in the fields. \"I picked tomatoes, cauliflower, broccoli, corn, grapes.\"\n\nAfter a year, he had saved $8,000 -- almost all of his pay. \"I ate what I was picking,\" he says. \"I wore the same pair of jeans the whole year.\"\n\nWhen Quiñones looked up from the dirt, the best job he could see was driving the big tractors. The drivers were skilled, and they supervised crews. He was told it took ten years of fieldwork to land such a promotion, but Quiñones was soon behind the wheel of sophisticated plows and ditchdiggers. He learned how to service the engines and qualified for a temporary work permit. \"I had that hunger in my gut,\" he says.\n\nLivin' La Vida Loca\n\nA few months later, Quiñones told his cousin he was going to leave the farm. His response was, \"What are you talking about? If you keep working here, one day you'll be the foreman!\"\n\n\"Sometimes you have to be willing to risk,\" Quiñones said.\n\nHe moved to Stockton and took a job in a rail yard so he could attend night school at San Joaquin Delta College , learning English. His first job, shoveling sulfur, was the worst of his life -- smelly and filthy. Once again, he scrambled to acquire new skills, this time as a welder repairing valves on tank cars. Within a year, he'd become a foreman.\n\nWith his English improving, Quiñones switched to the night shift and began full-time studies in science and math. To make ends meet, he also tutored other students.\n\nOne day, outside the school cafeteria, he met Anna Peterson, an American student. \"I was fresh out of high school,\" she says. \"Alfredo was this fascinating guy, always in a hurry. He had long, curly hair and earrings. I walked up and introduced myself. We became friends.\"\n\nAfter graduating with an associate's degree in 1991, Quiñones was accepted to the University of California , Berkeley . He moved to a low-rent district in Oakland , getting by on a combination of scholarships, loans, a small grant and, as always, work. He became a teacher's assistant in three departments and also took a job at a men's clothing store.\n\nPeterson stopped by the store one afternoon. The two had lost touch, but the reunion was fateful. Soon they fell in love.\n\nQuiñones excelled in the competitive environment of Berkeley, getting straight A's in advanced classes, writing his honors thesis on the role of drug receptors in the brain and teaching calculus on the side -- not that he paid much attention to his standing. In the spring of 1993, his mentor, Hugo Mora, looked over his transcripts and told him he stood a good chance of getting into Harvard Medical School . \"I thought,\" recalls Quiñones, \"number one, this guy is very nice, and number two, he's clearly living la vida loca.\" Quiñones had been to a doctor only once in his life.\n\nThen he thought some more. \"My grandmother was a curandera, a town healer,\" he says. \"I saw the respect that she had. I decided to give it a shot.\"\n\nHarvard accepted him, and Quiñones moved East in the fall of 1994. Peterson followed, and they married in '96. A year later, Quiñones became a U.S. citizen. \"I'm sitting there, ten years after hopping the fence, and it hits me how fast I came up.\"\n\nQuiñones says he understands why people might resent him for entering the country illegally. His only excuse is that he was a brash and desperate teenager. \"The last thing I was thinking was that I was going to break the law,\" he says. Once he arrived, Quiñones says, the United States \"opened its doors to me\" -- a welcome, he adds, that would be unlikely today given the heated immigration debate. He offers no solution but suggests it will not come from higher walls. \"As long as there is poverty in our neighboring countries, there will continue to be this influx.\"\n\nQuiñones gave the commencement address when he graduated from Harvard Medical School and continued his training, in neurosurgery, at the University of California , San Francisco . It was an exciting but daunting prospect. Could an illegal Mexican fieldworker become a brain surgeon? It didn't seem possible.\n\nResidency turned out to be a low point in Quiñones's American journey. \"Neurosurgery has been reserved for people who come from a long pedigree of medicine,\" he says carefully. \"It's rare that you have someone like me go into this highly demanding field, where lots of patients die.\" He'd experienced prejudice before -- the farm owner's son who looked right through him, a former girlfriend whose mother disdained him for his nationality. \"They just ignited my fire even more,\" he says.\n\nHe admits there were times, working 130 hours a week for $30,000 a year, when he considered quitting. \"I felt what my father felt, not being able to put food on the table for my family,\" he says. \"But I had a dream.\"\n\nA grateful grandmother embraces Dr. Q after surgery on patient Maggie Bull.\n\nPhotographed by Stephanie Kuykendal\n\n\"Are we ready to rock and roll?\" Dr. Quiñones, now 40, sits on the edge of a patient's bed. It's a Friday morning at Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center in Baltimore , and this will be Quiñones's second brain surgery patient of the day. The woman, who's in her 60s, has two tumors; one is in the highly sensitive part of the cortex that controls motor movements. Quiñones holds her hand and looks into her eyes. \"I walk a fine line every day between good and bad outcomes, and bad outcomes can mean life or death,\" he tells her frankly. \"Also, there is a chance that you will be paralyzed on the right side.\" She nods. Dr. Q, as everyone calls him, believes patients deserve both compassion and honesty. \"That is the risk,\" he concludes. \"So we're set. You and I have a date.\"\n\nAn hour later, in operating room five, surrounded by six attendants and an anesthesiologist, Dr. Q cuts through the woman's scalp to expose her skull. Using a whirring tool, he carves out a two-inch-wide section of bone and pops it off like a manhole cover. He carefully cuts back the dura, a leathery layer of tissue under the skull, and the brain is exposed.\n\nDr. Q specializes in a high-tech form of brain surgery called motor mapping, in which an electrical stimulator is used to locate sensitive areas. \"Let's have complete silence, please,\" he says, and the room falls quiet. He touches the stimulator to the brain surface, and the woman's arm twitches -- a spot to avoid. Eventually he determines a safe path to the tumor, which he painstakingly removes, piece by piece, with an electrical forceps that cauterizes as it dissects. The doctor conducts brain motor mapping.\n\nPhotographed by Stephanie Kuykendal\n\nThe four-and-a-half-hour procedure goes well -- the patient comes to with no loss of motor function -- and Dr. Q is ecstatic. \"Holy guacamole, that was a great day!\" he says, shedding surgical garb as he heads to a meeting with the family of a man who recently suffered a massive brain hemorrhage.\n\nAlthough Dr. Quiñones is a relatively young doctor, his colleagues are already impressed. \"Not only is he a talented and conscientious surgeon, but he's very sensitive to the needs of patients,\" says Dr. Henry Brem, director of neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins. \"And he's a joyous person -- full of enthusiasm and the mission to do good for the world.\"\n\nIt's now after seven, and Dr. Q has been working for 12 hours. Other surgeons are going home for the weekend, but he is headed for his research laboratory in downtown Baltimore . The lab is an extension of his operating room: Cancerous tissue that he removes in surgery is studied with the goal of finding new therapies. \"One hope is that we can make brain cancer a bit more chronic, like diabetes, instead of a devastating lethal disease,\" he explains.\n\nDr. Q joins more than a dozen med students and residents from around the world at a table with a projector.

However, the nature of these actions almost exclusively asserted only one of the rights guaranteed specifically to the Mexicans who elected to stay on this side of the new border, the first Mexican Americans.\n\nTHE EARLY LITIGATION\n\nThe Tre at y of Guadalupe Hidalgo, in spite of its years, is a living document. It provides guarantees which are protected not only on a domestic level but internationally as well. Within a relatively new human rights system, the Treaty represents a valuable and practical tool in seeking redress for viol at ions of these rights. Unfortunately, the Treaty has been relegated to a land grants document rather than pursued as a viable alternative and foundation for sound human rights assertions in domestic and international tribunals.\n\nFrom the earliest cases which ensued almost from the moment the Treaty was signed until the more recent cases which deal with American Indian claims,2 the right to property has been the dominant focus in challenging or citing to the Treaty. The ownership of land, for a number of reasons, was uppermost in the minds of the inhabitants in the lands taken from Mexico by the United States . Land meant a livelihood, if not wealth, prestige, a patrimony, certainly the means to sustain life itself.\n\nThe Mexican Americans, robbed, cheated, taxed, beaten, murdered and lynched, or otherwise driven off their lands (See Appendix A), went into the U.S. courts only to find either that they had no protected titles where Texas was concerned3 or that the\n\nTreaty, instead of validating previous land claims had only given claimants the right to seek validation or clarification in U.S. tribunals.4 As one court saw it, Mexicans in the ceded territories got merely the status of citizenship under the Treaty; they gained no special guarantees under it.5\n\nArticle IX of the Treaty specifically cites the right to liberty and property.6 At the time, the right to challenge land claims or validate titles was an important and perhaps the crucial issue, often a life-and-death matter, to the early Mexican Americans. However, we assert that the Treaty conveyedunder the rubric of the right to liberty and by virtue of other documents specifically incorporated into the Treatya whole range of values and individual guarantees which apparently were not then considered assertable theories in litigation but which have since become both national and intern at ional standards of law.\n\nMoreover, while the right to property and claims stemming from it exclude Texas , U.S. citizenship was afforded all Mexicans within the territories who did not elect to retain Mexican citizenship by the end of one year. The other rights, to life and liberty, in other words, adhered to all Mexicans who remained on the U.S. side of the new border: in effect, these guarantees were extended not only to individuals but to the group clearly identifiable by their n at ional origin as Mexican/Americans. The significance of this factor will become clearer in the light of subsequent developments in the law.\n\nBecause land constituted the very sustenance of life in the society of the 1800s, it is understandable th at claims to property depended on assertions of title, adverse posses­sion, riparian rights, community ownership, and the like. In time, the significance of land has given way to the right to life and liberty as the primary values in affecting redress for wrongs against civil and human rights, for example, where denial of ones civil rights results in de at h at the hands of another, code law supplants the direct murder charge. See 18 U.S.C.A. §242.\n\nChicano claims for justice are basically at an impasse. Claims related to property rights obviously have faltered not only in the courts but also in the public conscience. The efforts of Reies Tijerina and the Alianza Federal de Mercedes Libres in the 1960s land claims movement in New Mexico sought redress in the courts and in public opinion, even in the halls of the United Nations7to no avail.\n\nWhat this paper urges is a new approach, retracing many of the same documents, but reexamining them in light of the development of intern at ional systems for the protection of human rights. The inter-American system, in particular, did not exist as a forum even two decades ago. Now, by reviving the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo along modern conceptual lines of human rights, Mexican Americans may, in fact, have a new opportunity to redress decades-old grievances.\n\nTHE RIGHT TO LIFE AS A PROTECTED HUMAN RIGHT\n\nWe present here a review of the basic documents providing us with the framework to understand th at life and liberty were perceived as human rights, each part of the other, at the time of the signing of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo with the goal in mind of bridging these views with the modern documents on human rights. The purpose, of course, is to provide an overall analysis of U.S. and Mexican documents, with greater attention paid to the Mexican sources which are less known in the United States .\n\nAmerica s commitment to basic individual rights is embodied first in the Declaration of Independence, al­though these principles also appear in the earlier Declarat ion and Resolves of the First Continental Congress.8 The second paragraph of the\n\nDeclaration of Independence asserts that ,\n\nWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty , and the Pursuit of Happiness.9\n\nNot till 1868, however, did the United St at es constitu­tionally bestow upon the concept of life, liberty and property the status of protected individual rights, interdependent facets of the fundamental equality and worth of the human person. The 14th Amendment reads:\n\n§1. All persons born or nationalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No\n\nState ... shall ... deprive any person of life, liberty or property, without due process of law, nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.10 (Emphasis added.)\n\nThese two tenets, taken together with Article 11 §2 (2) which places tre at y making authority in the President11 and Article VI (2) which asserts th at the Constitution of the United States and its laws and Treaties shall be the supreme law of the land ...12\n\nindicate that pre-1848 in the United States, life, liberty and property were understood as a whole, each element complementing and encompassing the other. Later Statutes, such as 18 U.S.C.A. §242 and 42 U.S.C.A. §1983, reinforce, this view.13 Under these laws, a U.S. citizen may seek redress in court against viol at ions of Constitutional and Treaty rights involving Government officials or agents.\n\nMEXICAN PERCEPTIONS OF BASIC RIGHTS\n\nMexican views on the right to life and liberty are well-rooted in official documents of the Republic both prior and subsequent to 1848. Citing the seminal nature of the\n\nDeclaration of Rights of Man and Citizen by the National French Assembly in 1789 to Mexican constitutional thought, Noriega, in tracing the sources of individual rights in the Mexican Constitution of 1917, says,\n\n... the Law, and for that matter, the laws, enacted in chapter one of our Constitution, make crystal clear the challenge stemming from that great dynamic of the natural law of a\n\nNation: that law which has been evolving in the heat of the struggle begun in 1810, which fomented in 1814 and became incorporat ed in 1824 in the life of the Republic; felt and absorbed in 1847 and which became flesh and spirit in 1857.14\n\nNoriega reinforces the notion posited herein, that life, liberty and property are essentially interrelated to each other and to the derivative rights which become successively more specific to social, economic and cultural needs of an increasingly complex world.\n\nNoriega states,\n\n... I shall seek to enumerate the most salient rights which the St at e should recognize and protect: the right to life, to existence; the right to physical freedom, the right to bodily integrity, the right to be master of ones own destiny.15\n\nIn the prior quote, Noriega referred to a series of historic documents, for one, the Constitution of 1824, which averred in Article 24,\n\nThe happiness of a people and of each individual consists in the mutual enjoyment of equality, security, property, and liberty. The preservation as a whole of these rights is the goal of Government and the only objective of political bodies.16\n\nFurthermore, in the Actas de Reformes of 1847, Article 5 asserts, ...the declaration that a single law would insure the guarantees of liberty, security, and equality in favor of all citizens of the Republic...17 (Emphasis added.)\n\nFinally, in the Constitution of 1857, Article 14 stipulates,\n\nNo one shall be deprived of life, liberty or property without (due process) before tribunals already established which conform with the essential procedural steps and comply with the laws previously enacted toward that end.18\n\nThe Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo incorporates language reflecting much the same conceptual framework of these Mexican documents and by reference those Statutes and Treaties more familiar to the United States . Further on, a review of the inter-American human rights documents demonstrates that an unbroken line exists between the Guadalupe Hidalgo and 20th century human rights law, a fact that has yet to be tested after nearly a century and a half.\n\nTHE RIGHT TO LIFE IN THE TREATY OF GUADALUPE HIDALGO\n\nThe formulation of the Treaty, as early and then revised texts indicate, progressed from a full recognition of inalienable rights of those already on the northern side of the new border, citing longstanding intern at ional agreements, to a well-excised document, grudgingly granting the new Mexican/Americans the most minimal protections.\n\nHowever, as we shall see, by reference to U.S. documents, other treaties, the Treat y of Guadalupe Hidalgo itself, and to some extent a suppressed protocol, the full scope of rights encompassed in the Treaty will become apparent.\n\nMoreover, a review of the inter-American human rights documents demonstrates that an unbroken line exists between the Treaty and today. This fact has not been recognized nor, consequently, put into practice in litigation since 1848.\n\nArticle VIII, in para. 1, identifies as a group, Mexicans now established in territories previously belonging to Mexico ... and adds in para. 2, ...who have remained in the said territories (beyond the year from the date ratifications were exchanged) without having declared their intention to retain the character of (citizens of Mexico ) shall be considered citizens of the United St at es .19\n\nThe grant of citizenship, therefore, is not made with regard to propertied st at us or place of residence: that group of persons of Mexican origin who simply decided to stay behind the new boundary line became citizens by operation of Treaty law.\n\nHowever, Article IX declares that ,\n\n(These) Mexicans... shall be incorporated into the Union of the United States and be admitted, at the proper time (to be judged by the Congress of the United States) to the enjoyment of all the rights of citizens of the United St at es according to the principles of the Constitution; and in the meantime shall be maintained and protected in the free enjoyment of their liberty and property, and secured in the free exercise of their religion without restriction.20 (Emphasis added.)\n\nBoth conditions, the tacit election to assume U.S. citizenship after one year and the admission of the territory into statehood, are since fully complied with by operation of law, although in the case of New Mexico, it took more than half a century before it was finally admitted as a state. Congress, in effect, withheld full citizenship from the Mexican/Americans by setting a vague point in the future ( at the proper time) for grant of citizenship.21 Congress fears are clear from a reading of the original text of Article IX, as follows:\n\nThose Mexicans (who by operation of law become U.S. citizens under Article VIII) will be incorporated into the Union of the United St at es and will be admitted as soon as possible in conformity with the Federal Constitution and to the enjoyment of full rights of U.S. citizens and meanwhile shall be maintained and protected in the enjoyment of their liberty, their property and of the civil rights which they now have according to Mexican law.22 (Emphasis added.)\n\nArticle IX originally also provided:\n\n... with respect to political rights, their condition shall be on an equality with that of the inhabitants of the other territories of the United States (and at least equally as good as th at of the inhabitants of Louisiana and the Floridas ) when (they) became territories of the United States .23\n\nThus, the explicit extension of protections already in effect by virtue of Mexican law as to personal (human), property and civil rights were diluted. And, by deleting reference to the Floridas  treaties, Congress also sought to curtail extension of treaty precedents by reference to the Louisiana and Floridas  treaties. The words in Article IX, as to equality with that of the inhabitants of the other territories, and  at least as good, apparently appeared too generous.\n\nHowever, two U.S. and one Mexican commissioner drafted and signed a protocol on May 26, 1848 , setting forth the understanding which each side had of the revised document. The protocol stipulates that Article IX reflects and in effect incorporates Article III of the Louisiana Treaty (April 30, 1803) as well as the intent of Article VI in the Floridas Treaty (February 27, 1819). 24 The three commissioners affirmed that the U.S. Congress, by substituting Article III of the Louisiana Treaty for Article IX of Guadalupe Hidalgo,\n\n... has in no way sought to diminish what was agreed to in Article IX. ...As a consequence, all the freedoms and guarantees of a civil, political, and religious nature which the inhabitants of the ceded territories would have under Article IX, the same without difference are contained in the substituted article.25\n\nControversy surrounds the drafting of the Treaty as well. N. Trist, the U.S. negotiator, had been deprived of portfolio before entering into negotiations with Mexican authorities. The protocol itself was suppressed and never made a part of the Treaty. Despite this questionable genesis, the Treaty was accepted by Congress, amended, and\n\nratified on U.S. Independence Day, July 4, 1848 . All but one question is moot: Does the Treaty contain protections of relevance to current human rights issues or is it a dead letter?\n\nTHE RIGHT TO LIFE IN INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS DOCUMENTS\n\nThe concept that life itself is a right inherent in the nature of human beings seems so obvious th at it hardly requires documentat ion. Yet, from this essential notion are derived, as Contardo indicates, so many related protections that human existence as a value in itself becomes the starting point for the projection of a whole series of affairs and conditions within a number of intern at ional documents.\n\nContardo, writing in the Revista Chilena de Derecho, notes how often the right to life is omitted as a specific reference in many if not most constitutional documents: though it seems so apparent, the right to life, as the most immediate possession of oneself, must be memorialized, especially in light of the new multiple forms of at tack humanity now faces.\n\nContardo adds, As a consequence of (the right to lifes) gaining constitutional recognition, there may be derived numerous legal means to protection this right, to sanction its unjust violation, and to create proper conditions for its exercise.26\n\nFrom this root sprout other concerns, (De alli brotan otras exigencies) Contardo asserts, which demand the creation of structures within society to protect and augment the assurance and protection of human rights such as medical care, social security, police protection, employment, even economic stability:\n\nNo one can be barred from the exercise of these rights, because to do so indirectly at tacks ones right to life.27\n\nThe United Nations Charter, that momentous document in the whole history of world affairs, itself does not specifically assert a right to life, rather it characterizes its\n\nStates Party to the Charter as, Determined ... to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights and in the dignity and worth of the human person.28\n\nMore to the point is the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, a derivative document of the UN Charter. Several articles specify that life is a protected value and elaborate its many ramifications into society.\n\nArticle 3 cites the right to life, liberty and the security of person; 4, denounces slavery and any form of forced servitude; 5, condemns ...torture, cruel, inhuman or de­grading treatment or punishment; 7, entitles the person to equal protection of the law; 8, 9, and 10, assert rights to effective remedies before competent tribunals, fair and public hearings by impartial tribunals, and freedom from arbitrary arrest, detention or exile; 25, promotes the right to a decent standard of living, and 27, seeks progress for all by participation in or benefiting from cultural, artistic and scientific progress.29\n\nOf immediate relevance to human rights in the Americas is the Declaration of Rights and Duties of Man, adopted by the Organization of American States in Bogotá in 1948, which is also quite explicit. The introductory paragraphs assert basic assumptions about the dignity of the individual and the generic nat ure of life in human society... The Preamble adds substance and depth to the life value, promoting culture as the highest social and historical expression of ... spiritual development ...it is the duty of man to preserve, practice and foster culture by every means within his power.30\n\nSeveral articles assert a series of related rights: I, life, liberty and security of person; II, equality of all persons before the law without distinction; XI, preservation of health and well-being; XIII, the benefits of culture; XVII, the recognition of a juridical personality and of civil rights; XVIII, the right to a fair trial; XXV, protection from arbitrary arrest, and XXVI, due process of law.31\n\nIn the Statute of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights which was approved in 1960, Article 2 assumes by reference the listing of rights as set forth in the American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man. In Article 9 and 9 (bis), among the functions and powers vested in the Commission is th at it pay particular attention to observance of certain of the rights cited in the American Declaration, including the ones cited in the preceding paragraph (except for Articles XI and XIII which the author added).32\n\nFinally, the Regulations of the Commission, approved in October 1960, places the Commission under the governance of the OAS Charter with its functions determined by the Statute while its scope of goals and activities derive from the American Declaration of Rights and Duties of Man. The full impact of the Commissions powers is spelled out in following sections. The significance to Mexican American needs and aspirations will also become apparent.33\n\nReflecting its derivation from the American Declaration and other human rights documents, the American Convention on Human Rights further enhances the understanding of right to life as an inherent human value and societal goal. The Convention, of course, is of crucial importance, as we shall discuss, with respect to the procedural, administrative and juridical system now established in the Americas .\n\nBecause of the particular focus of this paper on inter-American human rights, specific references within the American Convention which fall into the general penumbra of life-related rights are reviewed as follows:\n\nPreamble ...the essential rights of man are not derived from ones being a n at ional of a certain stat e, but are based on at tributes of the human personality; and they justify international protection...complementing the protection provided by the domestic law of the American states.\n\nArticle 4.1. Every person has the right to have his life respected...No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his life.\n\nArticle 5.1. Every person has the right to have his physical, mental and moral integrity respected.\n\nArticle 7.1. Every person has the right to personal liberty and security.\n\nArticle 8.1. Every person has the right to a hearing... for the determination of his rights and obligations of a civil, labor, fiscal, or any other nature.\n\nArticle 11.1. Everyone has the right to have his honor respected and his dignity recognized.\n\nArticle 24. All persons are equal before the law. Consequently, they are entitled, without discrimination, to equal protection of the law.\n\nArticle 25. Everyone has the right to simple and prompt recourse, or any other effective recourse, to a competent court or tribunal for protection against acts that\n\nviolate his fundamental rights.34\n\nUnder the American Convention, Article 41 reflects the same functions as Article 9 and 9 (bis) in the St at ute, with an important distinction between communications (complaints) and petitions. Submission of communications to the Commission and cases to the Court of Human Rights vary decidedly in regard to restrictions.\n\nUnder Article 44, Any person or group of persons, or any non-Governmental entity legally recognized in one or more member states of the Organization, may lodge petitions with this Commission containing denunciations or complaints of violatin of this Convention by a State Party.35 (Emphasis added.) To submit a case before the Court, however, only a State Party or the Commission has such right under Article 61.36\n\nWhere communications involve allegations by one St at e Party against another, Article 45 requires that at the time a State Party files its instrument of ratification of the Convention, it include a statement recognizing the competence of the Commission to consider such communications before the Commission will accept a State Party communication against another stat e party; similarly, under Article 62, the competence of the Court of Human Rights must be recognized by a State Party before decisions of the Court become binding upon th at State Party.37\n\nAn Article 44 petition has a series of hurdles to over­come before receiving full Commission attention. Article 46, §1, requires the exhaustion of domestic remedies and submission of the petition within six months of the date the party alleging viol at ion of his rights was notified of the final judgment.38\n\nAn Article 44 petition must contain the name, nationality, profession, domicile, and sign at ure of the petitioners or the legal representative. The requirements for exhaustion and six months period need not apply where, under Article 46, §2, there are no domestic remedies nor due process afforded by the state concerned in regard to the right allegedly violted, the party making the allegation has been denied access to the remedies or prevented from exhausting them, or there has been unwarranted delay in obtaining a final judgment.\n\nIf Article 46 requirements are not met, the facts do not tend to establish a violation, or the petition is manifestly groundless or substantially like another case already studied by the Commission or another international body, Article 47 provides for the Commission to find the petition inadmissible.39\n\nHowever, once these barriers are overcome, a petition then undergoes a series of procedures under Articles 48 to 50: the cause may be settled or submitted to the Court of Human Rights, or the Commission may vote to take appropriate measures such as making recommend at ions to the state concerned or publishing a report on the matter.\n\nBecause only a State Party or the Commission may approach the inter-American Court, who that complainant would be becomes the paramountand extremely politicalquestion. Two state parties have clear standing to sue: the United States and Mexico . It is doubtful that the U.S. Government would implicate itself on a charge of a human rights violation. (In one of the first cases before the Court, however, Costa Rica itself initiated an inquiry. Government of Costa Rica, In the matter of Viviana Gallardo, et al. Inter-American Court of Human Rights, Decision of Nov. 9, 1981, No. G101/81.) Mexico would face enormous political and economic considerations before taking action. Most likely, only the Commission would approach the Court.\n\nAnother approach involving the Court involves recourse to the advisory function of the Court. In order to determine the validity of issues stemming from interpretative problems related to internal domestic law or inter-American agreements, Article 64 specifically provides that any member State or the Commission ...may consult the Court regarding the interpretation of this Convention or of other treaties concerning the protection of human rights in the American States.40 (Emphasisadded.) Such advisory jurisdiction may be invoked with regard to any state whether or not it recognizes the Courts competence. Buergenthal, a member of the Court, asserts that , though not binding, states may find it as difficult to disregard an advisory opinion as they would a judicial decision.41 In the realm of international affairs, the publicity such an event can generate might prove an effective means of seeking redress.\n\nAs a treaty, then, which falls clearly within the purview of American documents establishing obligations among nations, the Treat y of Guadalupe Hidalgo must also be considered an inter-American document ...concerning the protection of human rights and thus within the jurisdiction of the Commission and the Court. Certain questions need to be raised and resolved, such as: what is the nature and extent of the Treatys human rights protections, can Chicanos in fact have standing as claimants, and where do remedies lie, within the jurisdiction of the Commission, the Court or the OAS General Assembly? An American forum exists in which to do so and a document exists, however old, which warrants renewed attention and review with respect to the deprivation of human rights which the Mexican American is now experiencing in the United States.\n\nTHE CASE FOR CHICANO HUMAN RIGHTS\n\nAgainst this background of human rights thought and practice, the case of the Mexican American provides an unusual perspective for understanding and testing of the inter-American human rights system.\n\nThe Mexican American or Chicano was born on February 2, 1848 , taking for his birth\n\ndate the day on which the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo was signed by U.S. and Mexican ambassadors in Mexico . The Chicano was a party, albeit a silent third party, to this international agreement whereby those Mexicans choosing not to elect formally the retention of Mexican citizenship obtained the full guarantees of U.S. citizenship. It was by virtue of the Treaty, through the operation of law, not birth, ownership of land,\n\nnaturalization, or any other way, that the Mexican American came to be.\n\nThe Chicanos juridical personality, then, stems from an international agreement: at the very least, this would confer upon the Chicano a rare if not unique status among inhabitants of the Americas. The scope of this paper did not permit inquiry into whether other identifiable racial/ethnic groups have come into existence in a similar way. The Treaties of Louisiana and the Floridas refer only to the inhabitants of the territories;42 the U.S. Supreme Court has found that American Indians, while U.S. citizens, have distinct juridical st at us as parties to treaties with the U.S. Government (U.S. v. Sandoval, 198 F.540 (1912).\n\nVigil v. U.S. , 293 F.Supp. 1178 (1968), at tempted to draw on civil rights statutes to regain control of land grants in New Mexico, but the claim was dismissed for failure to state a claim. The complaint cites the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo outside any human rights context and otherwise fails as vague and general, at 1183.\n\nThe distinctiveness of the Chicano person was alluded to in In Re Rodriguez,43 one of less than a handful of cases cited in Shephards under the Tre at y (9 St at . 922) reaching the Supreme Court or District Courts based on other than a property claim. Rodriguez application did not fit the description of either a white or African as the immigration laws required. The Court noted that color or race had not been a condition for becoming a citizen; rather it had merely been used to distinguish the nature of rights permitted.\n\n(Statutory exclusion of Asians from becoming citizens through the naturalization process was upheld in In re Ah Yup, 5 Sawyer. 155, 1 Fed Cas. 22.) Rodriguez was granted citizenship essentially, the Court held, because under the Tre at y of Guadalupe of Hidalgo, Mexicans were granted citizenship stat us without regard for color or race and besides, Rodriguez had been a model American for more than 10 years as a resident of San Antonio .\n\nA more famous case, for different reasons, provides another perspective on the Chicano person. In Dred Scott v. Sandford, 60 U.S. 586 (1856), the Treaty was cited to show that the Constitution had not excluded colored aliens from citizenship, i.e., color of a certain kind was not a necessary quality to obtain citizenship. The grant or withholding of citizenship is the prerogative of Congress. In the case of the Mexican American, he obtained citizenship by virtue of Treaty powers, without regard to color or race, but certainly with regard to his identificion with a national origin. Cases which have since sought to establish the character of the Mexican American as an identifiable ethnic group took no cognizance or had no knowledge of this fact, e.g., Hernandez v. Texas, 347 U.S. 475, 74 S.Ct. 667, L.Ed. 866 (1945); U.S. v. Texas , (E.D.Texas) 342 F.Supp. 24 (1971).\n\nWhat this line of thought suggests, then, is that the Chicano may have special status with regard to domestic forums, but certainly should have special standing in international ones dedicat ed to the protection of human rights. Such a theory, of course, has yet to be tested in a domestic or international forum.\n\nWith regard to the lat ter avenues, the thrust of the analysis here suggests that the\n\ninternational character of the harm inflicted upon Chicanos would constitute a basis for submitting proposals for study by the Commission as well as petitioning the Commission for redress of alleged violations. The doctrine of exhaustion, moreover, would indicate that redress of grievances in the area of human rights within the Americas be instituted in the inter-American arena before recourse to other international bodies.\n\nBesides, while the United States is not technically bound by the Convention, it is not free of public scrutiny: the Convention having gone into effect July 18, 1978 , the United States cannot simply ignore the findings of a body duly established by the Convention. The inter-American system is designed as a forum for bringing world scrutiny and opinion to bear in as many ways as possible on the preservation and extension of human rights to all persons in the Americas .\n\nIf, in fact, Chicanos are victims of conduct proscribed by treaty, they should have full recourse to its protections. In short, the inter-American system of human rights may constitute the next step in Mexican Americans continuing pursuit of the right to life and liberty.\n\nMexican Americans could gain access to inter-American forums through three principal means:\n\n· under the Statute of the Commission on Human Rights, seek consideration of Chicano rights as topics for Commission study,\n\n· under the Regulations, file petitions, and,\n\n· under the Convention, have the Commission conduct investigations and submit and/or publish reports of a public nature, or bring a specific case before the Court of Human Rights.\n\nBecause domestic remedies must be followed through to some final judgment under the doctrine of exhaustion, cases must be carefully selected which in fact have reached a final determination or have been stymied or delayed at some point in the adjudicatory system within the United States (Article 46, §2) before a petition or case may be found admissible and either dealt with by the Commission or passed on to the Court.\n\nAn additional hurdle exists where the St at e Party must have filed, either with their instrument of ratification or some time since, a statement acceding to the competence of the Commission and the Court before communications related to that State Party may be accepted for consider at ion. The United States has signed and r at ified the OAS Charter and is thus bound by the American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man. However, it is only a signatory at present to the American Convention (signed June 1, 1977 ). Until ratification, it need not submit itself to adjudicatory proceedings under the Court but it is still open to studies by the Commission and to submittal of petitions alleging human rights violat ions.\n\nA CASE HISTORY: RICHARD MORALES\n\nIn order to give substance to the theory and analysis behind treaty and case law, philosophical and historical literature, at least one case should serve to indicate within the scope of this paper, the nature of Mexican American claims for redress of violations of their human right to life and liberty.\n\nTo provide some context for a lengthier recital of a specific case, the following is a brief chronological account of nine incidents which took place between 1973 and 1978 in cities, both large and small, throughout Texas :\n\nNov. 15, 1973 - Santos Rodriguez, 12, shot once in the head while a police officer held a revolver to his head inside a police squad car during questioning about a burglary. The officer, Darrell Cain, was convicted and sentenced to five years in prison.\n\nSept. 14, 1975 - Richard Morales, the case history, will be described in detail below.\n\nMay 5, 1977 - Joe Campos Torres, 23, Houston , death by drowning while in the custody of Houston police officers. Two officers, Terry Denson and Stephen Orlando, were convicted in state court of criminally negligent homicide, a misdemeanor, after being tried for murder. In a district court trial, these two and a third officer, Joseph Janish, were found guilty of civil rights violations and sentenced to 10-year suspended sentences (maximum penalty for such violations is life in prison); each had to serve one year for misdemeanor violat ions.\n\nMay 18, 1977 - Juan Deloz Zuniga, 33, a Mexican national in Odessa, killed in the Hudspeth County jail when struck by a homemade club made from a pool cue. The grand jury no billed Sheriff Clayton Hutchins in the incident.\n\nNov. 6, 1977 - Tiburcio Santome, in his early 30s, Garden City, shot four times while in the custody of sheriffs officers, after being arrested for drunk and disorderly conduct at a church festival. The grand jury did not return an indictment against either Sheriff Royce Pruitt or a friend, G.B. Thurwanger, who fired the pistol.\n\nDec. 8, 1977 - Juan Galaviz, 19, Big Spring , shot once in the head, after allegedly at tempting to abduct the wife of a college basketball coach during a game. The grand jury did not return an indictment against Sgt. LeRoy Spires, who fired the gun.\n\nJan. 22, 1978 - Larry Ortega Lozano, 22, Pecos , dead of a crushed larynx while in the Ector County jail. a six-member jury panel ruled the death an accident and the Ector County grand jury took no action against any of the officers implic at ed, Sheriff Elton Faught and his deputies.\n\nJan. 22, 1978 - Danny Vasquez, 17, Moon City ( El Paso County ), shot once by a shotgun in the hands of Deputy Sheriff Sergio Guzman. The grand jury returned a no bill in the case.44\n\nThe case of Richard Morales, a resident of Castroville, a small town just west of San Antonio across the Bexar County line into Medina County, is cited in U.S. v. Hayes, 589 F.2d 811 (1979). Perhaps it suffices as an introduction to the incident to quote the opening sentence of 5th Circuit Judge Fays opinion: This case involves an outrageous episode in law enforcement. at 815.\n\nAlthough the events leading to Morales death began at 10:30 PM on Sept. 14, 1975 , with a call by Frank Hayes, then Castroville Chief of Police, to an officer, Donald McCall, to pick up Morales on misdemeanor arrest warrants, the background dates back much longer.\n\nMorales had been in trouble with Castroville police before. The warrants Hayes referred to (actually satisfied by Morales by an appearance at a court hearing two days ear­lier) were on charges of failure to deliver several cows he had sold. Hayes suspected Morales of having stolen a stereo and television set and sent McCall to get the serial numbersactually Morales had rented the items in San Antonio. In short, Hayes had already been at odds with Morales, and perhaps for some time.\n\nThis hostility was borne out when Hayes, arriving at Morales home in his personal car accompanied by Dennis Dunford, his brother-in-law, called Morales, according to witnesses, a thieving son of a bitch, told him he was going to kill him and struck him in the stomach several times with his fist. at 815.\n\nFinally, after a ride of several miles out to a deserted gravel road in Hayes own car, Hayes, with Dunford still in tow, stopped his car, obtained a 12 gauge shotgun from McCall and struck Morales with the breach of the shotgun. All the while, Hayes kept telling Morales he was going to kill him. Hayes sent McCall away, back up the road. Reportedly, then, Hayes shoved the shotgun at Morales again, Morales pushed it away and stepped back. The shotgun discharged, killing him.\n\nHayes then went back up the road to McCall, told him Morales had escaped and to inform the Sheriffs office. Hayes returned to the scene and, with Dunfords help, loaded the body onto the rear floorboards of his car. Hayes drove to his home, picked up his wife, Alice Foley Hayes (also a de­fendant), who with Haves and Dunford drove outside of Castroville, placed the body in the car trunk and returned home.\n\nMrs. Hayes daughter then joined her mother in driving to San Antonio where they picked up her sister, Alice Baldwin, also a defendant. All three then drove some 400 miles to Panola County near the Louisiana border, where after buying some shovels on the way, they buried Morales body in a shallow grave. By the time they returned to Ms. Baldwins home in Llano County , local authorities arrested them as they were trying to dispose of bloody garbage bags and shovels.\n\nTried January 1976 in San Angelo, Tom Green County , after a change of venue, on a charge of murder, Hayes was found guilty of aggravat ed assault and sentenced to 10 years in prison, of which he might have served a minimum of 18 months.\n\nHowever, on a Federal Grand Jury indictment, Hayes was tried in September 1977, having been charged with viola­tion of 18 U.S.C. §242 by depriving Richard A. Morales of the right to liberty by due process of law, resulting in his deat h. After a change of venue from the San Antonio Division of the Western District of Texas to the Waco Division, he was found guilty on Sept. 19, 1977 , and sentenced to life imprisonment.\n\nOn appeal, perhaps the most telling affirm at ion by the 5th Circuit was its upholding of the rule that no constitutional bar exists to successive state and federal prosecutions for the same criminal conduct, the dual prosecution or Petite Policy rule. Under this policy, the Justice Department provides that defendants will not be prosecuted for federal offenses arising from the same act except when there is a compelling federal interest and approval of an Assistant Attorney General.\n\nThen Attorney General Griffin Bell had decided at one point not to prosecute Hayes in federal court but had reversed his decision. The Court held that this did not constitute discriminatory prosecution against Hayes, noting:\n\nThose individuals caught in the net of increased awareness and sensitivity to particular classes of crimes cannot justify their conduct by noting that at the time of their illegal activity, the community was more tolerant of similar transgressions. at 818.\n\nWh at had happened during the period of Morales death and the case reaching the Circuit Court was th at Chicano and general public pressure had forced Attorney General Bell into reviewing the Petite Policy and public awareness had indeed forced closer attention to the administration of justice in Morales behalf.\n\nSimilarly, appellant Hayes argued that the disparity between his sentence and that of others in factually similar cases mandated a reduction of his sentence. The Court held\n\nthat , unless abuse of discretion by the district is shown, the sentence would stand. And it did.\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nIn light of the continual violence being inflicted on Mexican Americans throughout the Southwest, the most significant finding posited by this paper is th at the Tre at y of Guadalupe Hidalgo is in fact an intern at ional human rights document, extending guarantees through the decades which have not been asserted on an intern at ional level. Moreover, for the first time in the Americas a system for addressing viol at ions of basic individual rights is in place which provides several means by which persons in the Americas can seek redress.\n\nThe Chicano community, by virtue of its origins in an international agreement in which it had no say at the time may not only hold U.S. citizenship, but a form of standing in certain international forums. Whether the Mexican American may seek redress in intern-American forums by virtue of this dual status has yet to be tested. Thus, while the doctrine of exhaustion may apply to the Chicano domestically, his international status may suggest a way to short-circuit a judicial system which has failed to address his claims against injustice except when a judge faces a situation so outrageous that it cries for vindication.\n\nMany questions have been raised in this paper, which suggest various courses of action. The American Convention on Human Rights through its operational branches, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, holds the answer to many of these questions. Finding the suitable case, the most fitting approach, and the appropriate forum to deal with a petition or issue will require considerable effort on the part of many persons.\n\nMany areas of research, moreover, have been indicted in this paper as well which would provide information on related facets of the history of the Mexican American from a juridical standpoint. Legal research into the land grants issue, educational\n\ndeprivation, employment exploitation, and other elements of the Mexican American experience should help fill out what is known about those Mexicans who stayed on this side of the new border with Mexico 134 years ago.\n\nThe more that is discovered about the international as well as domestic stat us of the Chicano the great er will be the opportunity to redress the kinds of injustice inflicted on a Richard Morales. While Morales death has been vindicated at one level, the cases of many more Moraleses have not, nor have their families gained restitution, nor has the community of Mexican Americans obtained full redress. Perhaps it is only at the\n\ninternational level that such redress can be obtained for the Chicano, this offspring of war and Treaty."
